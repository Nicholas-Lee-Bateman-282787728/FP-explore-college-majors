468643,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,6305537801,absent_minded_prof,"[4, 4]","In ""A Walk on the Moon,"" Diane Lane and Liev Schrieber are fantastic as a moderately stodgy, 30-ish couple, whose placid, hobbit-like life together suddenly feels incredibly boring to Diane Lane. Her early mid-life crisis is pronouncedly exacerbated by the fact that she is experiencing it during the completely insane summer of 1969, right down the road from Woodstock. Due to this personal/marital crisis, she permits the advances of ""the blouse man,"" a local travelling salesman (no smirks, please) to get bolder and bolder. She even starts initiating situations herself, which ineluctably lead to an illicit tryst, and then another, and another... This eventually blows up in her face, of course, and results in a very serious, intelligent look at a troubled marriage in troubled times, and makes the viewer think HARD about what they have in their lives that they feel lucky about, or ought to. There's also a nice little subplot about the daughter in the family coming of age, and how this dovetails with Diane Lane's own awakening.I have to ask right off the bat -- why isn't Diane Lane better known? It makes no sense at all. I know a number of guys about my age (33) that have harbored a crush on her for decades, ever since ""A Little Romance"" in 1979. Any directors or producers out there -- what gives?!?! Keep her working! It's nice that director Tony Goldwyn took notice of her -- I believe he got his own acting start as one of Jason's victims in ""Friday the 13th, Part 6,"" so I imagine he must have a pretty well-developed sympathy gland, for fellow struggling thespians. Anyway, she's beautiful, highly gifted in her ability to communicate with gestures, and an able imitator of accents. I'm not sure what it is about her that makes her so hard to forget, visually -- she has an ability to simultaneously look shrewd and kind. That could be it. Hollywood being what it is, that shrewd look might be what gets her in trouble. She LOOKS very intelligent. Not that there aren't plenty of highly intelligent actresses out there, but intelligence isn't always one of the very first things you think of when you see them. It just doesn't lend itself to playing starry-eyes ingenues. Actually, I remember seeing in a movie once that there are three ages for actresses in Hollywood -- 1.)Babe, 2.)District Attorney, and 3.)Driving Miss Daisy. Diane Lane has one foot in each of the first two of those stages. Let's hope she sees more work.Okay, enough gushing. Liev Shrieber is really terrific too, as the beleaguered husband Marty. I first saw Liev on film as a psychotic cop who gets possessed by a sort of demonic oil slick (yes, I'm serious) in an adaptation of a Dean Koontz book, ""Phantoms"" -- so, I wasn't expecting much here. I was very pleasantly surprised, however -- the man has range. Marty is a believable, likeable, well-developed character. Let's hope Liev keeps working, too... The supporting cast is solid as well -- Viggo Mortensen is pretty cool as a sort of free-wheeling 60s guy, who looks like a Doobie Brother who took an unfortunate career detour into apparel sales. He has a better role than you might expect -- more complex. He's a human being, not just an excuse for Diane Lane to run amok for a few weeks... Anna Paquin is terrific too -- I'm pretty sure she won an Oscar when she was about 10 or 11, so perhaps competence is not so startling coming from her.Anyway, this is just a really nice, mature movie all around. Two thumbs up.",5,This is what movies SHOULD be,985305600,"03 23, 2001",2001,3470,"['A', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'are', 'fantastic', 'moderately', 'stodgy', '30-ish', 'couple', 'placid', 'hobbit-like', 'life', 'together', 'suddenly', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'early', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'pronouncedly', 'exacerbated', 'fact', 'experiencing', 'completely', 'insane', 'summer', '1969', 'right', 'road', 'Woodstock', 'Due', 'personal/marital', 'crisis', 'advances', 'blouse', 'man', 'local', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'smirks', 'please', 'get', 'bolder', 'bolder', 'even', 'initiating', 'situations', 'ineluctably', 'lead', 'illicit', 'tryst', 'then', 'eventually', 'up', 'face', 'course', 'results', 'very', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'look', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'troubled', 'times', 'viewer', 'think', 'HARD', 'what', 'have', 'lives', 'feel', 'lucky', 'ought', 'also', 'nice', 'little', 'subplot', 'daughter', 'family', 'coming', 'age', 'how', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'own', 'awakening.I', 'have', 'ask', 'right', 'bat', 'why', ""n't"", 'Diane', 'Lane', 'better', 'known', 'sense', 'know', 'number', 'guys', 'age', '33', 'have', 'harbored', 'crush', 'decades', 'ever', 'A', 'Little', 'Romance', '1979', 'directors', 'producers', 'out', 'there', 'what', 'Keep', 'working', 'nice', 'director', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'took', 'notice', 'believe', 'got', 'own', 'acting', 'start', 'one', 'Jason', 'victims', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '6', 'imagine', 'must', 'have', 'pretty', 'well-developed', 'sympathy', 'gland', 'fellow', 'struggling', 'thespians', 'Anyway', 'beautiful', 'highly', 'gifted', 'ability', 'communicate', 'gestures', 'able', 'imitator', 'accents', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'so', 'hard', 'forget', 'visually', 'ability', 'simultaneously', 'look', 'shrewd', 'kind', 'could', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'what', 'shrewd', 'look', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'trouble', 'very', 'intelligent', 'Not', 'are', ""n't"", 'plenty', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'actresses', 'there', 'intelligence', ""n't"", 'always', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'things', 'think', 'when', 'see', 'just', ""n't"", 'lend', 'playing', 'starry-eyes', 'ingenues', 'Actually', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'once', 'are', 'three', 'ages', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', '1', 'Babe', '2', 'District', 'Attorney', '3', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'one', 'foot', 'first', 'two', 'stages', 'Let', 'hope', 'more', 'work.Okay', 'enough', 'gushing', 'Liev', 'Shrieber', 'really', 'terrific', 'too', 'beleaguered', 'husband', 'Marty', 'first', 'saw', 'Liev', 'film', 'psychotic', 'cop', 'who', 'possessed', 'sort', 'demonic', 'oil', 'slick', 'yes', ""'m"", 'serious', 'adaptation', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'book', 'Phantoms', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'however', 'man', 'range', 'Marty', 'believable', 'likeable', 'well-developed', 'character', 'Let', 'hope', 'Liev', 'working', 'too', 'supporting', 'cast', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'pretty', 'cool', 'sort', 'free-wheeling', '60s', 'guy', 'who', 'Doobie', 'Brother', 'who', 'took', 'unfortunate', 'career', 'detour', 'apparel', 'sales', 'better', 'role', 'might', 'expect', 'more', 'complex', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'just', 'excuse', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'run', 'amok', 'few', 'weeks', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'terrific', 'too', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'won', 'Oscar', 'when', 'was', 'about', '10', '11', 'so', 'perhaps', 'competence', 'not', 'so', 'startling', 'coming', 'her.Anyway', 'just', 'really', 'nice', 'mature', 'movie', 'around', 'Two', 'thumbs', 'up']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

468645,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305537801,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","After I had seen and raved Lane's dynamic performance in `Unfaithful' I was told by many a friend to check out her riveting portrayal of, you guessed it, a cheating spouse in `A Walk on the Moon'.  My friends all claimed that she is just as impressive and just as Oscar worthy here as well, but really, all they had to do was say Diane Lane and I was sold (I just love her).  I don't know how this movie passed me by, but then again, 1999 was such a rich year for film that it is almost impossible to lay claim to seeing all of them.  `A Walk on the Moon' may be a tad predictable (okay, a lot predictable) and it may be formulaic, but the rich performances and the nicely developed script help elevate this film higher than the subject necessarily calls for.The film tells the story of Pearl Kantrowitz, a young mother of two who is taking the summer vacation with her family to the Catskills.  Her husband Marty can only stay in segments for his profession is in high demand (he is a television repair man) beings that Armstrong is about to land on the moon and everyone and their mother wants to watch it on television.  While Marty is away, Pearl finds herself falling for Parker, a hippie `blouse salesman' who is spellbound by Pearl's good looks and obvious charm.  While Pearl struggles with her own desires she has to try and reel in her fourteen-year-old daughter Alison while avoiding the watchful eye of her mother-in-law Lillian.`A Walk on the Moon' unfolds rather predictably, with Pearl engaging in an affair, her daughter testing the boundaries of rebellion and her poor husband uncovering the lines of deceit and falling to pieces over it all.  The script does contain some inconsistencies and improbabilities (the whole Woodstock thing, while a nice touch, was a tad unbelievable) but the wonderfully fleshed out performances and the overall honesty of the films conclusion make this a very well done film.Diane Lane is Oscar worthy as Pearl, such a warmly constructed performance that is almost as brilliant as her `Unfaithful' turn.  In all honesty I can't for the life of me understand who she was Oscar snubbed for Meryl Streep's mediocre turning in `Music of the Heart' or Julianne Moore's overrated and boring turn in `The End of the Affair'.  Lane towers over both of those performances by creating a real woman who is devastated and confused and liberated all at the same time.  Live Schreiber, an actor for whom I am steadily becoming more and more impressed with, is amazing as Marty.  As the film progresses and he uncovers the truth we can feel his emotions crush inward, and the way he goes from one extreme to the next is believable and heartbreaking.  Anna Paquin is sensational as Alison, really matching Lane's ferocity, and Tovah Feldshuh is flawlessly moving as Marty's worrisome mother.  Viggo Mortensen, who has turned himself into a fine actor, is less than engaging here.  I've never seen the physical attraction there, so maybe that's why his character didn't sell me (in my opinion Schreiber is a much better looking man) but overall I found him underwhelming.  He didn't charm me or fascinate me as he should have in order to sell his character.As a whole I think that `A Walk on the Moon' works very well indeed.  Sure, the script could have been tightened a bit, and Viggo could have been replaced, but almost every other element is right in line with where they should be.  Lane is a revelation (why is she Oscarless?) and Schreiber is flawless.  The honesty that `Unfaithful', the film, lacked (delving into the whole murder-thriller business was a big mistake) `A Walk on the Moon' has in spades.",4,This is a walk to remember...,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,3644,"['had', 'seen', 'raved', 'Lane', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'Unfaithful', 'was', 'told', 'many', 'friend', 'check', 'out', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'guessed', 'cheating', 'spouse', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'friends', 'claimed', 'just', 'impressive', 'just', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'say', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'sold', 'just', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'passed', 'then', 'again', '1999', 'was', 'such', 'rich', 'year', 'film', 'almost', 'impossible', 'lay', 'claim', 'seeing', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'may', 'be', 'tad', 'predictable', 'okay', 'lot', 'predictable', 'may', 'be', 'formulaic', 'rich', 'performances', 'nicely', 'developed', 'script', 'help', 'elevate', 'film', 'higher', 'subject', 'necessarily', 'for.The', 'film', 'story', 'Pearl', 'Kantrowitz', 'young', 'mother', 'two', 'who', 'taking', 'summer', 'vacation', 'family', 'Catskills', 'husband', 'Marty', 'can', 'only', 'stay', 'segments', 'profession', 'high', 'demand', 'television', 'repair', 'man', 'Armstrong', 'land', 'moon', 'everyone', 'mother', 'watch', 'television', 'Marty', 'away', 'Pearl', 'falling', 'Parker', 'hippie', 'salesman', 'who', 'spellbound', 'Pearl', 'good', 'looks', 'obvious', 'charm', 'Pearl', 'own', 'desires', 'try', 'reel', 'fourteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'Alison', 'avoiding', 'watchful', 'eye', 'mother-in-law', 'Lillian.', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'unfolds', 'rather', 'predictably', 'Pearl', 'engaging', 'affair', 'daughter', 'testing', 'boundaries', 'rebellion', 'poor', 'husband', 'uncovering', 'lines', 'deceit', 'falling', 'pieces', 'script', 'contain', 'inconsistencies', 'improbabilities', 'whole', 'Woodstock', 'thing', 'nice', 'touch', 'was', 'tad', 'unbelievable', 'wonderfully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'performances', 'overall', 'honesty', 'films', 'conclusion', 'make', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film.Diane', 'Lane', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Pearl', 'such', 'warmly', 'constructed', 'performance', 'almost', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Unfaithful', 'turn', 'honesty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'understand', 'who', 'was', 'Oscar', 'snubbed', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'mediocre', 'turning', 'Music', 'Heart', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'overrated', 'boring', 'turn', 'End', 'Affair', 'Lane', 'towers', 'performances', 'creating', 'real', 'woman', 'who', 'devastated', 'confused', 'liberated', 'same', 'time', 'Live', 'Schreiber', 'actor', 'whom', 'am', 'steadily', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'impressed', 'amazing', 'Marty', 'film', 'progresses', 'truth', 'can', 'feel', 'emotions', 'crush', 'inward', 'way', 'one', 'extreme', 'next', 'believable', 'heartbreaking', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'sensational', 'Alison', 'really', 'matching', 'Lane', 'ferocity', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'flawlessly', 'moving', 'Marty', 'worrisome', 'mother', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'who', 'turned', 'fine', 'actor', 'less', 'engaging', 'here', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'physical', 'attraction', 'there', 'maybe', 'why', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'opinion', 'Schreiber', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'man', 'overall', 'found', 'underwhelming', 'did', ""n't"", 'charm', 'fascinate', 'should', 'have', 'order', 'sell', 'character.As', 'whole', 'think', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'works', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'Sure', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'bit', 'Viggo', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'almost', 'other', 'element', 'right', 'line', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'Lane', 'revelation', 'why', 'Oscarless', 'Schreiber', 'flawless', 'honesty', 'Unfaithful', 'film', 'lacked', 'delving', 'whole', 'murder-thriller', 'business', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'spades']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

It has a story that is not simplistic or overwrought but has the feel of looking back and inward. Walk on the moon as a title works because the nation was held in wonder mirroring the way both Pearl and her 14 year old daughter are at the way their life is turning.  It is a pivotal point for the main characters in this gentle movie. The main review states ""Although its tale of marital crisis unfolds a bit too cleanly...""  You know, I don't find it difficult to believe that there are some people left in America that are able to go beyond a crisis and find a way to reach out and hold on....that not everyone thinks a talk show or reality show way of handling life is the only way.  I will admit this is a bit of a feel good movie that allows us to walk on the wildside and still have the security of home and hearth.

468647,A1SSA0MF161794,6305537801,Ava Barbi,"[6, 7]","I get an emotional kick out of A Walk on the Moon, its double-entendre title aside.  For me, the DVD is a winner for three reasons: 1) Viggo Mortensen plays a romantic (OK, lusty) leading man; 2) Diane Lane does her unfaithful best three years before her Academy Award-winning turn opposite Richard Gere in Unfaithful; and 3) I get to experience, albeit vicariously, a smidgen of the goings-on at summertime resorts in the Catskills. Let me work my way backward. ...As a tween living on the East Coast in the mid-'70s, I recall my cousins' families and mine driving upstate to Sullivan County, New York, several weekends out of every summer.  Destination: Great big country house a la The Waltons. With my cousins and I belting out every lyric to sunny songs such as The Captain and Tennille's ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" and Elton John's ""Philadelphia Freedom"" as their melodies bounced around the car and out of the open windows, life felt as if it could not get any better. Approaching the Catskills, we would read aloud the colorful billboards announcing the different summer resorts. One time I got up the nerve to ask the adults in the car why we never went to any of those resorts and was told matter-of-factly that we would not be accepted there. So as I got older, I always fantasized that the Catskills resorts had to be boatloads of fun to be so exclusive and all.Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition), while fictional, definitely gave me a glimpse into the exciting lifestyle behind those wonderful billboards. All of this to say that when watching A Walk on the Moon, I feel like an outsider looking into a life I never had the privilege to enjoy. ...A Walk on the Moon also has many cinematic elements in its favor: breathtaking cinematography, a painstaking attention to time and place, and authentic regional dialects and vernacular.  For those viewers who perceive the film's pacing as long and drawn-out, I challenge them with this paradigm shift: Think of the slow pacing as a metaphor for lust's fever running its course amid summer's sweltering heat. ...Diane Lane is a force to be reckoned with when she portrays a character whose marriage just isn't working out. A Walk on the Moon predatedUnfaithful (Widescreen Edition)by three years, so we viewers get a chance to see how she has perfected acting out the visceral female erotic response that perhaps many women envy. That pivotal scene at the rear of the bus, in which she and the Blouse Man seem totally oblivious to a major milestone in world history -- hence, the film's title -- is no less intense than the scene in Unfaithful when she is on the train reminiscing about quivering beneath (hunka-hunka-burnin'-love luscious) Olivier Martinez hours earlier. Watching her squirming in her seat on that train, as she alternates between bliss and angst, I felt as if I had experienced the affair! In fact, I have had to hit the Pause button on the remote, leave the room and ice down my forehead.Lane knows how to embody a free spirit, whether in Unfaithful, in which her character double-crosses her attorney husband -- who ironically stakes his career on loyalty -- inUnder the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition), where American divorcee meets Fellini'sLa Dolce Vita (Deluxe Collector's Edition), or here, in A Walk on the Moon. ...Lastly, the No. 1 reason I love A Walk on the Moon is Viggo Mortensen in the role of the Blouse Man. His gaze alone is intense. He possesses a certain je ne sais quoi, an erotically hypnotic, intangible quality that actors such as Clark Gable, Marlon Brando and Steve McQueen translated very well on screen.  Serving as brilliant contemporary examples would be Robert DeNiro, Idris Elba and Clive Owen.  Oh, and Daniel Sunjata (oh, sing a joyous, sweetNoel). Female actors who also have that seductive quality include Kathleen Turner and Faye Dunaway as past examples; Jessica Lange, Angelina Jolie and Vivica Fox as current examples.This DVD, A Walk on the Moon, has the starpower and emotional depth of a retro classic.  Oh, and by the way, if the Blouse Man does not inspire you to go shopping, please check your pulse.",5,Petting and Pawing in the Catskills,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,4132,"['get', 'emotional', 'kick', 'A', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'double-entendre', 'title', 'aside', 'DVD', 'winner', 'three', 'reasons', '1', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'romantic', 'OK', 'lusty', 'leading', 'man', '2', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'unfaithful', 'best', 'three', 'years', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'turn', 'opposite', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Unfaithful', '3', 'get', 'experience', 'vicariously', 'smidgen', 'goings-on', 'summertime', 'resorts', 'Catskills', 'Let', 'work', 'way', 'backward', 'tween', 'living', 'East', 'Coast', ""mid-'70s"", 'recall', 'cousins', 'families', 'mine', 'driving', 'upstate', 'Sullivan', 'County', 'New', 'York', 'several', 'weekends', 'summer', 'Destination', 'Great', 'big', 'country', 'house', 'la', 'Waltons', 'cousins', 'belting', 'out', 'lyric', 'sunny', 'songs', 'such', 'Captain', 'Tennille', 'Love', 'Will', 'Keep', 'Us', 'Together', 'Elton', 'John', 'Philadelphia', 'Freedom', 'melodies', 'bounced', 'car', 'open', 'windows', 'life', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'Approaching', 'Catskills', 'would', 'read', 'colorful', 'billboards', 'announcing', 'different', 'summer', 'resorts', 'One', 'time', 'got', 'up', 'nerve', 'ask', 'adults', 'car', 'why', 'never', 'went', 'resorts', 'was', 'told', 'matter-of-factly', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'there', 'got', 'older', 'always', 'fantasized', 'Catskills', 'resorts', 'had', 'be', 'boatloads', 'fun', 'be', 'so', 'exclusive', 'all.Dirty', 'Dancing', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'fictional', 'definitely', 'gave', 'glimpse', 'exciting', 'lifestyle', 'wonderful', 'billboards', 'say', 'when', 'watching', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'feel', 'outsider', 'looking', 'life', 'never', 'had', 'privilege', 'enjoy', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'also', 'many', 'cinematic', 'elements', 'favor', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'painstaking', 'attention', 'time', 'place', 'authentic', 'regional', 'dialects', 'vernacular', 'viewers', 'who', 'perceive', 'film', 'pacing', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'challenge', 'paradigm', 'shift', 'Think', 'slow', 'pacing', 'metaphor', 'lust', 'fever', 'running', 'course', 'summer', 'sweltering', 'heat', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'when', 'character', 'marriage', 'just', ""n't"", 'working', 'out', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'predatedUnfaithful', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'three', 'years', 'viewers', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'perfected', 'acting', 'out', 'visceral', 'female', 'erotic', 'response', 'perhaps', 'many', 'women', 'envy', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'rear', 'bus', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'seem', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'major', 'milestone', 'world', 'history', 'hence', 'film', 'title', 'less', 'intense', 'scene', 'Unfaithful', 'when', 'train', 'reminiscing', 'quivering', 'beneath', ""hunka-hunka-burnin'-love"", 'luscious', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'hours', 'earlier', 'Watching', 'squirming', 'seat', 'train', 'bliss', 'angst', 'felt', 'had', 'experienced', 'affair', 'fact', 'have', 'had', 'hit', 'Pause', 'button', 'remote', 'leave', 'room', 'ice', 'down', 'forehead.Lane', 'how', 'embody', 'free', 'spirit', 'Unfaithful', 'character', 'attorney', 'husband', 'who', 'ironically', 'career', 'loyalty', 'inUnder', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'where', 'American', 'divorcee', 'meets', ""Fellini'sLa"", 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'Deluxe', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'here', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'Lastly', 'No', '1', 'reason', 'love', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'role', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'gaze', 'alone', 'intense', 'certain', 'je', 'ne', 'sais', 'quoi', 'erotically', 'hypnotic', 'intangible', 'quality', 'actors', 'such', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'translated', 'very', 'well', 'screen', 'Serving', 'brilliant', 'contemporary', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Oh', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'oh', 'sing', 'joyous', 'sweetNoel', 'Female', 'actors', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'seductive', 'quality', 'include', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'past', 'examples', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'current', 'examples.This', 'DVD', 'A', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'starpower', 'emotional', 'depth', 'retro', 'classic', 'Oh', 'way', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'not', 'inspire', 'go', 'shopping', 'please', 'check', 'pulse']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

468649,A3C54XWT93R2WY,6305537801,"Been around this block, several times over","[1, 1]","It was very late Saturday night, I happened to be home alone and very tired, and I wasn't at all sure that I would want to see this movie enough to remain awake past the opening few minutes.  Funny, though, I don't quite know from exactly where I got my second wind (AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF).  I've been on both sides of the main guy parts of this movie at different points in my life, and I've got to tell you that THIS FLICK HITS HOME!!!  Even the atmosphere of the wife on vacation in the mountains with the kids, while the husband has to get back to the city to work-- leaving the wife just lonely and complaining enough to feel vulnerable-- was a reality I experienced in real life, and re-experienced just as realistically while watching this movie.The negative reviews threw me off completely--as a movie lover, as a man with a reasonably rich sexual history to look back on, and as a clinician helping others through their own times of crisis (or LACK OF CRISIS when they should be feeling themselves in one).  In both real-life ""perpetrator"" and ""victim"" roles, I was discovering the broader reaches of joy.  I also remember undergoing the encounter with the other man, or with the man when I was the other man.  I remember how hard I struggled for that same sort of respectfulness with which the characters in this movie tried desperately to reach out to each other, and how hard it was to live up to it while I was in such pain . . . or having caused such pain.From having been on both sides I learned:(1) that the ""other man"" is never victorious over the man, because the ""other man"" usually represents only the exclusive freedom of indulged fantasy for the woman; and(2) that the ""victim"" has to come to the decision to compete with the other man for his woman's affections as a lover, not as a punitive moralistic whiner.The lover in this movie seems to have known the first part from the git-go; the husband, on the other hand, took a while (and some memory-jogging help from a microscope his wife sent him) to warm up to that second point.  Taming jealousy (the green eyed monster) turns out to be more a matter of taming one's own, as well as everybody else's, INSECURITY.Even when it didn't hurt, both sides of the experience were nevertheless scary to go through--and under both circumstances, it was ridden with guilt and uncertainty about where ultimately this would all be going.  I just saw the film for the first time on Netflix, and I have promptly bought six copies for me and to share.  While over half the marriages end in divorce, Americans remain a determinedly marrying and RE-marrying people, leaving a great many of us to make our way in blended family situations.These days, couples are bombarded with the hollow promises of fantasy entertainment garnered  from cheap TV melodramas, which invariably leave them hard up to distinguish reality from common yearning.  Just saw on WebMD advice delivered by a supposed sexuality expert about marriage--5 ways to keep sensuality strong--and it seemed like she was cooking Hamburger Helper (in the end, offering more explanations for why we shouldn't expect mutual climax than how to reach it with each other).There is a vast mystery in love, which this movie seems to capture (without ever trying to bring it all down to some sort of stupid easy solution by the time the credits start rolling).  In actual point of fact, there are as many different types of love as the Eskimos have words for snow, but we nevertheless think about it as only a unidimensional topic: and that's also how we tend to talk about it, or (worst of all) do it.  It is ultimately more art than science, and one can only be taught to take the time to explore and connect with one's own inner vision for how to go about it.  That is the gift we offer to the other party in any genuinely honest embrace, and thus the conversation is on (hopefully in responsively negotiated back and forth fashion).I loved the movie's keen sense of proportions: the wife achieved intense frolicking with her lover, but we leave the husband and wife back together having barely achieved clumsily dancing the twist with one another--which is exactly how new beginning proceed (when we first meet our other, or when we become REacquainted with him or her).  And all this was done so tastefully in the movie, which provides role models which are sure to keep couples caught in similar dilemmas from having to seek feeling excitedly XXX ""dirty"" in order to get it on.Hard to believe, but cynical old Hollywood SOMETIMES DOES GET IT RIGHT!!!  Cheap-shots-from-left-field/low-ball criticisms will only set the moguls back on their heels, and back to offering us Pabulum and Silly-Putty versions of life.  When a cultural objet-d'art like this comes along, give it it's due, or shut up and get out of the way.  If we fail to exercise the discipline and generosity to do this, remember that audiences invariably get the crap they deserve.  I highly recommend this film, for its near-documentary verite as well as for its most gratifying savoir faire.",5,Sometimes old Hollywood gets it right!!!,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,5073,"['was',

468652,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,6305537801,Charismatic Creature,"[14, 21]","Maybe it's just some quirk of fate that I seem to have watched so many films where Diane Lane was playing basically the same role -- the seemingly happily married housewife who has a hot n' sexy love affair and then returns to her loving and basically decent husband. The most famous of these is obviously ""Unfaithful"", for which she justifiably won an Oscar. But Ms. Lane had a lot of practice, because she did two nearly identical roles just a couple years before ""Unfaithful""...little known indies. One is ""Gunshy"" where her hottie lover is CSIs William Petersen...the other is this movie, ""Walk on the Moon"" with LOTRs Viggo Mortensen.So if you dug Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful"", here is another shot to see her in basically the same situation and expressing much of the same emotion. What is it about this actress that just screams to casting directors ""Cheatin' spouse""? I have no idea...Ms. Lane is a good actress, with a nice look of faded prettiness, like a slightly over the hill cheerleader, and I liked her work in ""Unfaithful"" very much. But there she was playing a rich waspy housewife...here we are expected to accept her blonde patrician looks as a working class Jewish housewife from 1960s Brooklyn. Sorry, this does not fly. Diane Lane is the antithesis of such a character...she's physically all wrong (the attempt to give her ""kinky"" wavy dark hair is particularly off base) and she is not Meryl Streep with the accent, so it comes off forced and awkward...she goes in and out of dialect. (She has the same problem in ""Gunshy"", where she is supposed to be New Jersey mobster's gun moll.)There is a potentionally interesting story here in the parallel between the mother's sexual awakening with her hippie lover and her 14 year old daughters sexual awakening, but the daughter (the very talented Anna Paquin from ""The Piano"") and her story are severely short-shifted in order to give maximum screen time to Lane and Mortensen. Viggo Mortensen, who comes off very wooden here although he's awesomely handsome, is basically fulfilling the part of ""bimbo boyfriend"". (Oh well, it's fair enough when women get so many bimbo roles in the movies.) There is certainly no sign of the Aragorn to come, because he's so vague, unfocused and bland that he basically registers as having no personality...this makes it very clear that he's just a sexy body for Pearl (Lane) to screw.That leaves Liev Shrieber, the husband, as the sole sympathetic character and he does well with it. The story cuts out early enough that the audience doesn't have to deal with what will certainly be chapter two -- the bitter residue that an affair leaves even when both parties promise to forgive and forget. (And would you want to be Liev Shreber trying to compete with your wife's sexy memories of Viggo Mortensen?)The background of a Jewish family summer camp in the Catskills is interesting but this was much better done in ""Dirty Dancing"". The real lame spot in this movie is the attempt to have the mother & lover meet up with the daughter & boyfriend at Woodstock. Actually the whole plot and setting is contrived around this point, i.e., that hippie Woodstock was actually held in the vicinity of these tacky family vacation camps. Obviously being a low budget indie, there is no ability to recreate ANYTHING about the crowds, bands, atmosphere, rain, mud or period ambiance of Woodstock...it would strain the abilities of a big budget film. So it's kinda embarassing to see them even try. It takes whatever credibility we have given the situation and basically blows it. It might have worked better and been cleverer just to have the characters talk about having BEEN at Woodstock, rather than trying to show something so enormous on such a tiny budget.(...)Utlimately, this comes across as a sort of Lifetime TV movie and I don't mean that in a good sense. There are lots of interesting intentions here that don't work, and a LOT of excruciating dialogue between the characters...the kind that I imagine sends most male viewers to the fridge for a beer. This isn't a movie that your husband or boyfriend will enjoy or even tolerate.Pretty much just a chance to pant over Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen a couple years before they became big stars and not a whole lot else.

Its hook at keeping me interested was Olivier Martinezs raw sexiness.  Walk on the Moons story is so much more interesting, erotic and poetic in obvious as well as subtle ways.  1st, Viggo Mortenson is a worthy temptation to stir the waters of doubt.  The writers and actors present more conflict articulating a marriage at crossroads of changing times and a couple that married too young.  There are also more interesting subplots. The husband (wearing toy cowboy attire or trying to dance to Jimi Hendrix), mother-in-law (strong and loving) and kids all add more interesting dimensions to the infidelity Diane Lane brings to the screen.  She is not all selfish addiction and has more rounded reasons for seeking really rockin bons temps with the blouse man. This added more suspense and satisfaction at the end.

But I wonder what kind of a review I would have given it if I had seen this movie first.  It deals with the same topic, played by the same actress.  Diane Lane is in a relatively stable marriage, but gets into a situation where she, let's say, wanders a bit.  Which is followed by the inevitable discovery and dilemma of ""What's next?"".""Unfaithful""'s final third had an issue that I thought made it less of a good movie.  In that one, an act of violence happens between two of the three of the triangle, and I thought too much time was spent focusing on that, instead of the meat of the story, which was the infidelity.  This movie has no such problem.  In both, the straying is discovered, and in both, there are decent ""What now?"" scenes.  But this movie I think is better because there is no act of violence that becomes the unifying focus.  The infidelity remains the main issue, and it's a greater writing challenge to settle the issue without the distractions the later movie brought.So this is the better Diane Lane infidelity movie.  You also get to see Viggo Mortenson in a role drastically different from ""G.I. Jane"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"".

Kudos to the writer and director.The movie made me mad, sad, and glad, bringing out all three different emotions. At times in our lives, we all are tempted to be someone we're not; and to do things we would not when our emotions get in the way. If we're mad we do one thing; if we're disappointed with life, we may take a selfish turn and do something ordinarily unthinkable, which is what happened with the character Pearl.This movie portrays very well the emotions of daughter against mother, the emotions of this young teen experiencing the entry into womanhood, the emotions of a father and husband toward his family and his sacrifices for such. The emotions of a family unit seen in 1969 is no different than any family today.I loved the movie. I would definately have it in my movie library. I give it two thumbs up!

But this movie, which suggests that producer Dustin Hoffman misses the halcyon late-Sixties Catskills, goes on to offer some wonderful portrayals and convincing dialogue. Housewife/mother Pearl (Lane) is suffering ennui as only a middle-class homemaker can, and unexpectedly finds comfort in the arms of the traveling blouse salesman (Mortensen). Her confusion, coupled with the turbulence of the encroaching Seventies (""Couldn't you set aside your beliefs for one day?"" she pleads with her activist daughter [Paquin]) is completely believable, although I was a little disconcerted by the ease with which I accepted the idea that middle-class angst is an important issue.Meanwhile, Paquin undergoes her own adolescent revolution; her trials are understood within a larger, supportive Jewish community and its members' obvious, unreserved affection for one another.As for Schreiber, his youth only occasionally betrays itself, and his acting keeps pace with Lane's and Paquin's (maybe my resistance to his casting is due to the lasting strength of his character in _Daytrippers_, a writer-wannabe who earnestly clings to an idea for an existential novel about a half-man, half-dog. Why he agreed to _Kate & Leopold_ is beyond me, though.)The friend who accompanied me to _A Walk on the Moon_ was clearly bored, suggesting that this movie might unfairly become lumped into that nefarious genre of ""chick flick.""

Remember Woodstock, the Jewish summer retreats in the Catskills, hippies, face and body painting, threats from the Vietnam era and promises of space habitation by the famous first walk on the moon?  It is all faithfully created here as the background for a lovely little sentimental tale about family and fidelity.The Kantrowitz family - Pearl (Diane Lane), Marty (Liev Schreiber), Alison (Anna Paquin), Daniel (Bobby Boriello) and Marty's mother Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh) - are spending their usual summer away form New York in a Catskill settlement bungalow along with other Jewish families of the same ilk.  All seems swell, except that Marty must spend the weekdays returning to his job as a TV repairman, leaving the family under Pearl's and Lilian's care until his weekend visits.  A hippie blouse salesman Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen) peddles his wares to the settlement and casually but inevitably Pearl feels an attraction to Walker, the man of adventure who represents all the lost dreams of becoming a mother  and wife at the too early age of 17.  Life has slipped her by but feels salvageable in Walker's advances.Woodstock is close by and Pearl and Walker spend a day of hippie love-in in the crowd, not knowing that teenage Alison is also there observing their free love antics.  This crisis event affects the family's unity and the way Pearl faces her moment of indiscretion with Marty and her children builds to a terrific climax.Diane Lane, Viggo Mortenson, Liev Schreiber and Tovah Feldshuh completely inhabit these simple characters and pull us into accepting all aspects of the predicament of this family crisis.  The confrontation among Lane, Schreiber and Mortenson is a trio of acting not to be forgotten.  Tony Goldwyn has paced his film beautifully and proves that he has as great skill as a director as well as an actor.  The cinematography by Anthony B. Richmond  is as recreative of a special time on our history as has been captured.  This little film will stay with you long after the credits are over.

And it does work incredibly well.  One thing I liked about it is that the performances are realistic  and it doesn't smack of Hollywood.  It left me with more of a tragic feeling than a romantic one.  You can only shake your head over the complexity of the human heart and society that it exists within.  They should have included Crosby, Stills and Nash's ""Find the Cost of Freedom"" in there just for good measure, as this movie certainly explores that.  OK, that song is not really about love affairs and their effect on families but about war..  Still, the effect of the affair on her family (the cost of freedom?) is obviously one of the themes in this movie and is in fact part of the price she (and her family) pays.  For better or for worse.I wanted to see this after catching Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful"", which was a rollarcoaster ride.  ""A Walk On The Moon"" better fits the drama catagory, and doesn't have the edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting impact of ""Unfaithful"" though it does gently but surely pull you into its world.  Thus we care about the characters and become quite interested in the story.And yes, it was great to see the legend of Woodstock and the late 60s play into the personal life of one family.  Neither over nor under-done, the final effect is a beleivable and involving movie that didn't exactly have me yearning for those times, but certainly gives a sense of appreciation and understanding for where people were.  While styles and current events have changed, issues of the heart perhaps haven't changed all that much.

As a BIG fan, I saw this movie just because of Diane Lane but was so blown-away at the performances of Liev  Schreiber(husband), Viggo Mortensen(&quot;blouse man/lover&quot;) and an  all-grown-up Anna Paquin who plays a typical rebellious teen. Together the  typical Jewish family experiences the angst of every family living in 1969-  teen sexuality, for a girl-getting your period, a love affair, and the bond  of traditions and true love.  For those of us not familiar with the Jewish  way of community, it is a very touching and endearing story.  Diane Lane  continues to be the best kept secret in Hollywood, but, I am sure, she,  herself keeps it that way, holding no &quot;STAR&quot; attitude such as  other actors making the big bucks.  You can always expect a great  &quot;walk on the moon&quot; from Diane and this movie doesn't disappoint!

468677,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6305537801,K. Boullosa,"[1, 1]","This tender film revisits the Summer of Woodstock (1969), as well as a slice of New York Jewish life from that era (the family summers in bungalow colonies in upstate New York).  If you lived through the Sixties as a teen, just the background music may make you weep.  Diane Lane is genuine and affecting as Pearl Kantlowitz, a Bronx housewife who married and had children too young, and at 32 is wondering if this is all life will ever hold for her.  Pearl is going through a bad patch, exacerbated by seeing societal changes and possibilities erupting around her.  Her rebellious 14-year-old-daughter, newly menstrual and blossoming sexually, is also going through a bad patch, which doesn't help matters, especially as Pearl can see that her daughter will likely have wider horizons than she herself did.  Pearl's loving, but somewhat stolid husband, Marty, sympathetically played by Liev Schreiber, is either unable or unwilling to address her increasingly urgent needs.  He too is trapped by their humdrum lives and early parenthood.  As was typical of the era, husbands went back to the city during the week and came back on the weekend, and wives were left alone during the week to play mah-jong and cards, look after youngsters, and spend hours at the lakeside.  This existence only throws Pearl's restless questioning into sharper relief.Into this volatile emotional atmosphere steps a bohemian peddler called ""The Blouse Man"" (the film's original title), also sympathetically played by Viggo Mortensen.  The Blouse Man (who actually has a name, Walker Jerome) visits the bungalow colony periodically, selling clothing and odds and ends to the women out of his bus.  Walker's character could easily have degenerated into a sleazy drifter taking advantage of a disaffected housewife.  Mortensen gives Walker gentle dimension - he is truly attracted to Pearl and falls in love with her, he is intelligent, and he honestly believes in the values of the emergent counterculture - he has lost a brother in Vietnam and has reasons for distrusting the establishment.  Walker is very much the ""other"" - a kind of Golden Shaygetz (gentile man in Yiddish), blonde and extraordinarily handsome, who couldn't present more of a contrast to Pearl's nice but dull Jewish husband.  Mortensen handles this role with sensitivity - he does not pursue Pearl, it is she who makes the first move toward him, and he leaves her to set the pace of the affair.  The scene in which Walker and Pearl first have sex in the back of his bus is both erotic and touching.Complicating matters is the presence of Pearl's mother-in-law, who lives with the family, but with whom Pearl has an affectionate, not adversarial relationship.  Played by Tovah Feldshuh, the mother-in-law (something of a local psychic who gives card- and tea-leaf readings) discerns the relationship between Pearl and Walker, and reveals it to Marty during the week by telephone, telling him to ""get your tuchas up here no matter what you gotta do"".  Whether she was right to interfere, the individual viewer may decide, but she precipitates a crisis in which Pearl and Marty must make decisions about their lives.Some may find the tie-up here a bit too pat - but this really is a charming film, well-produced with attention to period detail, including the music (e.g., Richie Havens, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Janis Joplin).  You can tell that the writers felt real affection for the characters, exposing their foibles and errors in a detached yet humane way.  The ensemble work is fine, and that includes the children, especially Anna Paquin as Allison, the sullen teenager.  This is a quality film, worth repeat viewings and with many quietly memorable moments.",4,"A Thoughtful,  Lovely Film",1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,3735,"['tender', 'film', 'Summer', 'Woodstock', '1969', 'as', 'well', 'slice', 'New', 'York', 'Jewish', 'life', 'era', 'family', 'summers', 'bungalow', 'colonies', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'lived', 'Sixties', 'teen', 'just', 'background', 'music', 'may', 'make', 'weep', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'genuine', 'affecting', 'Pearl', 'Kantlowitz', 'Bronx', 'housewife', 'who', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'too', 'young', '32', 'wondering', 'life', 'will', 'ever', 'hold', 'Pearl', 'going', 'bad', 'patch', 'exacerbated', 'seeing', 'societal', 'changes', 'possibilities', 'erupting', 'rebellious', '14-year-old-daughter', 'newly', 'menstrual', 'blossoming', 'sexually', 'also', 'going', 'bad', 'patch', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'especially', 'Pearl', 'can', 'see', 'daughter', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'wider', 'horizons', 'did', 'Pearl', 'loving', 'somewhat', 'stolid', 'husband', 'Marty', 'sympathetically', 'played', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'address', 'increasingly', 'urgent', 'needs', 'too', 'trapped', 'humdrum', 'lives', 'early', 'parenthood', 'was', 'typical', 'era', 'husbands', 'went', 'back', 'city', 'week', 'came', 'back', 'weekend', 'wives', 'were', 'left', 'alone', 'week', 'play', 'mah-jong', 'cards', 'look', 'youngsters', 'spend', 'hours', 'lakeside', 'existence', 'only', 'Pearl', 'restless', 'questioning', 'sharper', 'relief.Into', 'volatile', 'emotional', 'atmosphere', 'bohemian', 'peddler', 'called', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'film', 'original', 'title', 'also', 'sympathetically', 'played', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'who', 'actually', 'name', 'Walker', 'Jerome', 'bungalow', 'colony', 'periodically', 'selling', 'clothing', 'odds', 'women', 'bus', 'Walker', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'degenerated', 'sleazy', 'drifter', 'taking', 'advantage', 'disaffected', 'housewife', 'Mortensen', 'Walker', 'gentle', 'dimension', 'truly', 'attracted', 'Pearl', 'love', 'intelligent', 'honestly', 'values', 'emergent', 'counterculture', 'lost', 'brother', 'Vietnam', 'reasons', 'distrusting', 'establishment', 'Walker', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'kind', 'Golden', 'Shaygetz', 'gentile', 'man', 'Yiddish', 'blonde', 'extraordinarily', 'handsome', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'present', 'more', 'contrast', 'Pearl', 'nice', 'dull', 'Jewish', 'husband', 'Mortensen', 'role', 'sensitivity', 'not', 'pursue', 'Pearl', 'who', 'first', 'move', 'set', 'pace', 'affair', 'scene', 'Walker', 'Pearl', 'first', 'have', 'sex', 'back', 'bus', 'erotic', 'touching.Complicating', 'matters', 'presence', 'Pearl', 'mother-in-law', 'who', 'family', 'whom', 'Pearl', 'affectionate', 'not', 'adversarial', 'relationship', 'Played', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'mother-in-law', 'something', 'local', 'psychic', 'who', 'card-', 'tea-leaf', 'readings', 'relationship', 'Pearl', 'Walker', 'Marty', 'week', 'telephone', 'telling', 'get', 'tuchas', 'up', 'here', 'matter', 'what', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'was', 'right', 'interfere', 'individual', 'viewer', 'may', 'decide', 'crisis', 'Pearl', 'Marty', 'must', 'make', 'decisions', 'lives.Some', 'may', 'find', 'tie-up', 'here', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'really', 'charming', 'film', 'well-produced', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'including', 'music', 'e.g.', 'Richie', 'Havens', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'can', 'tell', 'writers', 'felt', 'real', 'affection', 'characters', 'exposing', 'foibles', 'errors', 'detached', 'yet', 'humane', 'way', 'ensemble', 'work', 'fine', 'children', 'especially', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Allison', 'sullen', 'teenager', 'quality', 'film', 'worth', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'many', 'quietly', 'memorable', 'moments']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

Marty (Liev Schreiber), who works in a television repair shop, is going to have to go back to work because Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are going to be walking on the moon later that month and everybody and their uncle wants to make sure they can see the big moment on their television. That means his wife, Pearl (Diane Lane), and mother, Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh, in another fine turn as a Jewish mother almost as good as her exquisite portrayal in ""Kissing Jessica Stein""), will stay at the bungalow watching over the kids, Alison (Anna Paquin) and Daniel (Bobby). Alison ""becomes a woman,"" a fact cheerfully announced over the public address system (by Julie Kavner), and goes off in search of her first kiss, her first date, and her first leaving the house to go attend a three day festival of rock music. But Alison is not the only one looking for trouble.We learn later in ""Walk on the Moon"" that the first time Pearl and Marty made love when they were teenagers, Pearl got pregnant with Alison. Marty was going to go to college, but that dream ended and he got married and went to work. Now it is fourteen years later and when Pearl sees her daughter running off to have fun and then notices that the ""Blouse Man"" (Viggo Mortensen), announced that way when he arrives to sell blouses out of a converted bus, is noticing her, she becomes painfully aware that she has only been with one man in her entire life. Now her husband is away, and while the rest of the world is watching images being beamed back from the moon, Pearl takes her own giant leap.The ""Blouse Man"" is really named Walker Jerome, a name, it is pointed out, that is backwards. But that hardly matters because he is, as you can plainly see, played by Viggo Mortensen, and that means Marty is going to need some help. At least he has the love and support of his mother, who makes it clear that no matter how bad the traffic is between the city and the Catskills because of the concert at Woodstock, Marty needs to get back up to the bungalow (the time it takes Marty to get from the city to the bungalow is mentioned every time he shows up). Eventually Pearl will discover that while she can run off to Woodstock or a secluded waterfall for her fun with her new lover, the world in which she lives not only has a moon on which men have walked, but a husband, a daughter, and a son. She also finds that not only does she have to explain her infidelity to those who have a right to know, but her marriage as well.The moment of crisis in ""A Walk on the Moon"" has to do with Pearl's decision as to what she will now do with the rest of her life. Does she attempt to reconcile with her angry husband or does she live the life she never had with the new guy? My problem is not with Pearl's choice, but rather the idea that changing the music that you listen to can make everything better. I might be willing to buy that deus ex musica if it did not work so quickly, although this 1999 film has a pretty good soundtrack that features Judy Collins singing ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes?"" (for rather obvious reasons given the plot). But I end up rounding down on this one because while the script by Pamela Gray (""Music of the Heart"") finely defines the female characters and their motivations, I find Marty's actions to be motivated more by the requirements of the resolution than anything else.

468681,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6305537801,Linda Linguvic,"[42, 58]","It's 1969 in a bungalow colony near Woodstock where husbands come up weekends to visit their wives and kids. Pearl Kantrowitz,  at 32 is the mother of a 14 year old daughter and a 5 year old son.  When a hippie salesman comes to the bungalow colony to sell blouses, she's drawn into an affair with him.  This is a time period that I'm familiar with.  I, myself, was only 30 years old then.  I, too, had children.  I also looked at the hippie world as an adventure that was somehow passing me by.  I remember those feelings and those wonder years.Diane Lane, cast as the mother, with her confusion and mixed loyalties, played her part well.  So did the hippie lover, Viggo Mortensen, who has the kind of good looks that are sketched on the covers of romance novels.  Anna Paquen is superb as the 14 year old daughter, coming of age herself, who goes to Woodstock and sees her mother there with the hippie.  And the husband, played by Liev Shreiber is wonderful as he tries to cope with his wife's changes and his love for his family.  Cast as Pearl's Jewish mother-in-law, Tovah Feldshuh should have been better.  The role is a good one, but the Yiddish words as written in the script were awkward.One of the reasons I hesitate to recommend this video is that the setting was artificial.  For example, in the few Woodstock scenes, the sun was always shining and it seemed to last just one short afternoon.  The real Woodstock lasted 3 days and it rained constantly.  I also thought the Jewishness and silliness of the bungalow colony was overdone.  Every single cliche and Yiddish expression were thrown in.  I found this distracting from the central human story of a family trying to cope with a changing world.  The scenes were much too long and the story moved too slowly.  Too many scenes were just talking and no action.  The plot was predictable and there were no surprises.  And I kept looking at my watch every ten minutes.The title refers to the moon walk by the astronauts,  watched on flickering black and white television sets that summer.  It's a big theme reflecting a changing world.  But in spite of good acting and interesting story, this film tried hard, but just didn't make it.",3,"Good concept, but the script should have been better",976924800,"12 16, 2000",2000,2196,"['1969', 'bungalow', 'colony', 'Woodstock', 'where', 'husbands', 'come', 'up', 'weekends', 'visit', 'wives', 'kids', 'Pearl', 'Kantrowitz', '32', 'mother', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '5', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'When', 'hippie', 'salesman', 'bungalow', 'colony', 'sell', 'blouses', 'drawn', 'affair', 'time', 'period', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'was', 'only', '30', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'too', 'had', 'children', 'also', 'looked', 'hippie', 'world', 'adventure', 'was', 'somehow', 'passing', 'remember', 'feelings', 'wonder', 'years.Diane', 'Lane', 'cast', 'mother', 'confusion', 'mixed', 'loyalties', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'So', 'did', 'hippie', 'lover', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'who', 'kind', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'sketched', 'covers', 'romance', 'novels', 'Anna', 'Paquen', 'superb', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'coming', 'age', 'who', 'Woodstock', 'mother', 'hippie', 'husband', 'played', 'Liev', 'Shreiber', 'wonderful', 'cope', 'wife', 'changes', 'love', 'family', 'Cast', 'Pearl', 'Jewish', 'mother-in-law', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'role', 'good', 'one', 'Yiddish', 'words', 'written', 'script', 'were', 'awkward.One', 'reasons', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'video', 'setting', 'was', 'artificial', 'example', 'few', 'Woodstock', 'scenes', 'sun', 'was', 'always', 'shining', 'seemed', 'last', 'just', 'one', 'short', 'afternoon', 'real', 'Woodstock', 'lasted', '3', 'days', 'rained', 'constantly', 'also', 'thought', 'Jewishness', 'silliness', 'bungalow', 'colony', 'was', 'overdone', 'Every', 'single', 'cliche', 'Yiddish', 'expression', 'were', 'thrown', 'found', 'distracting', 'central', 'human', 'story', 'family', 'trying', 'cope', 'changing', 'world', 'scenes', 'were', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'moved', 'too', 'slowly', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'talking', 'action', 'plot', 'was', 'predictable', 'were', 'surprises', 'kept', 'looking', 'watch', 'ten', 'minutes.The', 'title', 'refers', 'moon', 'walk', 'astronauts', 'watched', 'flickering', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'sets', 'summer', 'big', 'theme', 'reflecting', 'changing', 'world', 'spite', 'good', 'acting', 'interesting', 'story', 'film', 'tried', 'hard', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make']",A Walk on the Moon VHS
468682,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,6305537801,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[9, 13]","There are many similarities between this movie and the first Dirty Dancing movie. Both involve up-tight, conservative families off for a summer of fun in a New Yorky style getaway location. Both involve a female visitor becoming fond of a male worker who is much more laid back and free. Where Dirty Dancing focussed just on the young girl and how she 'became a woman', this movie focusses on the mom (Diane Lane) and how she 'regains her childhood'.The beginning of the movie is sort of clunky, setting the stage. The family with unappreciative kids. The husband who has become boring - he doesn't even want or understand a desire to try new sexual positions. He doesn't want to talk about what is going on at work or make waves there asking for more time off. The mom sees her daughter finding a voice, flirting with guys, doing all the things she missed out on herself. They set this up rather stick-figuredly, but I get and understand the general gist. Woman trapped in her role. See the Hours movie.Then along comes the 'blouse man', Viggo. I have a big issue with how they managed this relationship. Viggo is a friendly hippy who sells blouses to the Jewish resort inhabitants. He's equally friendly to everyone. Sure, the mom craves affection. Sure, Viggo talks to her 2 or 3 times. But then she calls him up for sex - and he shows up to be her 'back door man' without a blink? He brings her right into his back room and, even though she's talking loudly about her family and obviously having second thoughts, all he says is ""want me to stop?"" It was very artificial feeling. And almost immediately we are launched into montages of them having sex everywhere - in streams, in dales, in fields. Sure, he gets her to jump into the water. But it really seems to be all about sex.I'm all for sex, I think sex is great. But I think it really diminishes the story. The story began as a mom who was accused of ""having no causes"" and who missed out on her childhood of flirting. So as a result she goes out for lots of sex with a guy whose name she doesn't even know until they're halfway into it? Then then crank it into overdrive with a sequence of bizarre coincidences. The daughter, running off to Woodstock (which is very poorly replicated), sees her half naked mom kissing Viggo. Later, the mom is off chatting with Viggo when her young son is almost slain by wasps, and of course Viggo shows up to take care of the kid. And we top off with the contrived-and-tense scene of the betrayed dad having to thank Viggo for that work.I think contrived is really the word that comes to mind for most of this. There are some really meaningful nuggets in here - the talk that mom and daughter finally have, where they both become more human for a while. The fact that the daughter wants to be ""the wild teenager"" and needs the mom to be a stable force in her life, even while the daughter says she hates the mom. The dad's hurt anger at being betrayed, and the fact that he has in fact been very disappointed with his life as well but did not act out as a result. The environment is also very realistic - I remember those styles of cabins, those types of pillows and decorations. The over-use of Yiddish sayings was a little much, but they were trying to bludgeon it into our heads that this was an ethnic group of people.Even more contrived is the finale. The movie was very Hollywood - there really was little doubt that this is how it would end up.On the positive side, the soundtrack here is just AMAZING and right on. Diane really does a good job with the script she was given, on showing the pulls and tugs in her life, her attempts to have something more and how she is pushed back into place at each turn. To be fair, the husband does say near the end that she COULD have pushed harder if she really wanted to, to make her needs known. But she was pushing hard already and was in return being pushed down into place. Is he really saying that it's her own fault for not pushing *really* hard? Isn't that what she in fact did with Viggo, just pushed hard for something she wanted? In any case, you do see that angst and desire for fun and desire to do the right thing all conflicting within Diane.How about Viggo? Again, this script didn't really give him much to work with. How many lines does he really get? A few ""this looks nice on you"" lines, then he shows up to be a call-on-demand gigilo, then lots of scenes of sex. A few hokey lines about ""here's the cool way to cure wasp stings"", one or two lines about travelling across the US, and it's over. There was no construction of a relationship, no sharing of ideas, no melding of minds. No staring at the stars discussing infinity. I realize romance doesn't have to be esoteric. But if it was just about wham-bam sex, the story looses a lot of its meaning. It would have been SO much more gripping if he had dreams as well, and shared those dreams with her, and those dreams were incredibly similar. It would have meant something then, that they had considered running off hand in hand.A nice watch, but many other movies tackle this same theme with a MUCH more realistic and involving

Lane and family got to camp but Lane's husband, Liev Schrieber(Scream 1,2,3, Spring Foward), has too work all the time so he cant be there all the time. Lane get's lonely, so when the new ""blouse man"", played by Aragorn, no I mean Viggo Mortensen (A Perfect Murder, Albino Alligator) comes to camp, she starts to fall for his good looks and his blouses (tee-hee)and she does end up sleeping with the man. Meanwhile, her hormonal daughter, Anna Paquin (X-Men 1,2), starts to gets signs of becoming a woman. Viggo and Lane's passion becomes more and Lane's mother finds out she is schtupping the blouse man. Her husband, Schrieber finds out and that's when it starts to become intense. A little bit slice of life, a little big of family problems, spun together into a directing debut for Tony Goldwyn (Kiss The Girls, Ghost) which can only goes so far but doesnt happen for me.

Is that what the sixties was really like?This is a charming film about the people we  used to be back when you could still smoke cigarettes, have a cocktail  after a hard day at the office and fool around without much chance of  getting a deadly disease. Although this film has a slightly serious side to  it, it is in the main, a sort of look back at those years which flew past  all too quickly and took a great many people along with them, in a sort of  flood of home improvements and cheap mountain holidays. It was all a bit of  a whirl. And then there was Woodstock and this guy walking on the moon and  things were starting to somehow, unaccountably, come apart.Tony Goldwyn  deserves a lot of credit for even attempting to make a film like this, let  alone succeeding on his first attempt at directing. It's a very pleasing  result from A to Z and the great thing about it, apart from the absence of  gratuitous Hollywood muck, is that it just gets on with the story, with  nobody's ego getting in the road and spoiling its simplicity. Diane Lane  and Viggo Mortenson are well matched as the couple about to discover  Woodstock and experience some of its encroaching peace and love. Anna  Paquin is perfectly believable as a young kid trying to catch up with mum,  and having her eyes opened to more than the usual extent. Leif Schreiber is  possibly the best of them all in this interesting cast, as he renders a  very strong cuckolded 1960s male of the macho variety, and does so very  sensitively. Tovah Feldshuh is also very strong as his all-knowing,  all-seeing mother.

Their charm and beauty together with the lovely title promise a magical story that unfortunately doesn't develop. The script is terribly hackneyed and predictable and it's filled with tiresome cliches.  We've seen this plot over and over. ""Marjorie Morningstar"" did it very well....the Nice, middle-class Jewish girl who was angaged to a Nice, steady boy but then was entranced by an exciting show business type,(""Noel Ehrman"", played by Gene Kelly) but eventually came to her senses and settled down to the Nice doctor. It was interestng back in the 50's but now....not-so-much.Here we don't have Gene Kelly but we do have Viggo Motensen and that's not bad. As another reviewer wrote, ""Who wouldn't want to go to Woodstock with Viggo Mortenson?""  Poor Pearl (Diane) got pregnant the first time she slept with a boy and was trapped into marriage.  Marty, who wanted to go to college, was trapped and, being a Nice boy, gave that up, just as he gave up his microscope to help out his widowed mother years earlier....gave it all up to hack away in the back of a tv repair shop for the rest of his life.  His name reminds me of another very good 50's movie, starring Ernest Borgnine...another blue collar, dull guy stuck in a boring life somewhere out in the Boroughs.  I think these films have already been made and Mr. Goldwyn should have tried for some new material.  Sprucing it up with the moon walk was a nice try but really didn't work.I could rant on about poor Pearl's plight...stuck there in this summer camp in the Catskills with two kids and her mother-in-law! Where the most exciting thing that happened was the visit of the Blouse Man.  Her Marty, an archetypal Nice Boy, is too weak to dare to ask for a few days off from work, although a co-worker, the one with sexy wife, gets a whole week off.  And no one could ever imagine Marty standing up to his Mamma.  And just think....just down the road...what's happening but the cultural phenomenon of the Century....Woodstock!It is a good idea and it could have made a better movie if it hadn't been so mired down in all the cultural cliches and the stultfying sentimentality.  There are a few good scenes....of Diane and Viggo frolicking in the waterfall and at Wookstock.  Viggo looks great in green paint!

468698,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305537801,Reviewer,"[4, 11]","The universal theme of coming to terms with the loss of youth and accepting a life of unfulfilled hopes and dreams is explored in ""A Walk On the Moon,"" directed by Tony Goldwyn.  Diane Lane stars as Pearl Kantrowitz, a thirty-one year old mother of two, the oldest of whom, Alison (Anna Paquin), is fourteen; her husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), is a square shooter who loves his wife and family and provides for them by working long hours in a shop repairing television sets.  It's the summer of `69, and while on the family's extended vacation-- during which Marty must return to work for the week-- Pearl falls into discontent, and with Woodstock about to happen a mere stone's throw from the campground/resort at which they are staying, she soon succumbs to the siren's song of the `60s:  The inhibition, freedom and free love-- all of which have been denied her since giving birth to her daughter at age seventeen.  There's an honesty to Goldwyn's film, and though he captures the sense of the times in which the story is set fairly well, he nevertheless fails to elicit much sympathy for his leading lady, Lane.  Perhaps it's because, though there is much about Pearl with which to identify, her story is just too familiar; her situation is far from being unique, and she has a decent, upper middle-class life, with a loving husband and two great kids.  The fact that she started young and that her dreams were never realized is a shame, but it's not like she's the only one to whom such a fate has befallen.  And her futile attempt at regaining her lost years comes across as somewhat shallow and decidedly unsympathetic; and without that sympathy the film sputters and finally stalls, even as Neil Armstrong is beginning his historic walk on the Moon.  There's no question that Lane is attractive, and physically she fits the role of Pearl perfectly.  But she simply doesn't possess the wherewithal to sell her character in this film.  The emotional turmoil of what Pearl is experiencing seems restricted to the surface, and she never manages that depth of feeling that would've made the necessary connection with the audience.  It's not that Lane is bad in this role, it's just that she's not that good.  There are just too many gaps in credibility and too many false moments to be overlooked.  It's as if the character throughout remained just beyond her grasp.  Liev Schreiber, on the other hand, is outstanding as Marty.  You have no trouble believing he is exactly who and what he is supposed to be.  This is a character to whom most people will be able to relate, and if only Lane had been able to evoke the same kind or response as Schreiber, it would've made a tremendous difference in the overall aspect of the film.  Anna Paquin gives a noteworthy performance as well, successfully capturing the angst of puberty while coping with an ever-changing world.  The supporting cast includes Viggo Mortensen as Walker Jerome, the traveling salesman with whom Pearl attempts to reconcile her lost youth; Tovah Feldshuh (Lilian Kantrowitz); Bobby Boriello (Daniel); Stewart Bick (Neil); Jess Platt (Herb); Star Jasper (Rhoda) and Julie Kavner (Voice of the Social Director).  There are some poignant moments in Goldwyn's film, and it does generate a certain sense of loss and longing;  but overall, ""A Walk On the Moon"" is at best a momentary diversion that comes across like a finger painting on an impressionist's canvas.  That is stays afloat at all is due mainly to Schreiber and Paquin's performances.  Other than that, this is-- unfortunately-- a rather forgettable film that never quite attains the level of drama to which it aspires.",2,More Of A &quot;Saunter&quot; On The Moon,984268800,"03 11, 2001",2001,3650,"['universal', 'theme', 'coming', 'terms', 'loss', 'youth', 'accepting', 'life', 'unfulfilled', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'explored', 'A', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'stars', 'Pearl', 'Kantrowitz', 'thirty-one', 'year', 'old', 'mother', 'two', 'oldest', 'whom', 'Alison', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'fourteen', 'husband', 'Marty', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'square', 'shooter', 'who', 'wife', 'family', 'working', 'long', 'hours', 'shop', 'repairing', 'television', 'sets', 'summer', '69', 'family', 'extended', 'vacation', 'Marty', 'must', 'return', 'work', 'week', 'Pearl', 'discontent', 'Woodstock', 'happen', 'mere', 'stone', 'throw', 'campground/resort', 'are', 'staying', 'soon', 'succumbs', 'siren', 'song', '60s', 'inhibition', 'freedom', 'free', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'denied', 'giving', 'birth', 'daughter', 'age', 'seventeen', 'honesty', 'Goldwyn', 'film', 'sense', 'times', 'story', 'set', 'fairly', 'well', 'nevertheless', 'elicit', 'much', 'sympathy', 'leading', 'lady', 'Lane', 'Perhaps', 'much', 'Pearl', 'identify', 'story', 'just', 'too', 'familiar', 'situation', 'far', 'being', 'unique', 'decent', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'life', 'loving', 'husband', 'two', 'great', 'kids', 'fact', 'started', 'young', 'dreams', 'were', 'never', 'realized', 'shame', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'whom', 'fate', 'befallen', 'futile', 'attempt', 'regaining', 'lost', 'years', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'decidedly', 'unsympathetic', 'film', 'sputters', 'finally', 'stalls', 'even', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'beginning', 'historic', 'walk', 'Moon', 'question', 'Lane', 'attractive', 'physically', 'role', 'Pearl', 'perfectly', 'simply', ""n't"", 'possess', 'wherewithal', 'sell', 'character', 'film', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'what', 'Pearl', 'experiencing', 'restricted', 'surface', 'never', 'depth', 'feeling', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'necessary', 'connection', 'audience', 'not', 'Lane', 'bad', 'role', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'gaps', 'credibility', 'too', 'many', 'false', 'moments', 'be', 'overlooked', 'character', 'remained', 'just', 'grasp', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'other', 'hand', 'outstanding', 'Marty', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'exactly', 'who', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'character', 'whom', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'only', 'Lane', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'evoke', 'same', 'kind', 'response', 'Schreiber', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'tremendous', 'difference', 'overall', 'aspect', 'film', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'successfully', 'capturing', 'angst', 'puberty', 'coping', 'ever-changing', 'world', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Walker', 'Jerome', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'whom', 'Pearl', 'reconcile', 'lost', 'youth', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Lilian', 'Kantrowitz', 'Bobby', 'Boriello', 'Daniel', 'Stewart', 'Bick', 'Neil', 'Jess', 'Platt', 'Herb', 'Star', 'Jasper', 'Rhoda', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'Voice', 'Social', 'Director', 'are', 'poignant', 'moments', 'Goldwyn', 'film', 'generate', 'certain', 'sense', 'loss', 'longing', 'overall', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'best', 'momentary', 'diversion', 'finger', 'painting', 'impressionist', 'canvas', 'stays', 'afloat', 'due', 'mainly', 'Schreiber', 'Paquin', 'performances', 'Other', 'unfortunately', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'level', 'drama']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

468702,AWUUMER0F3WF4,6305537801,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","It's Summertime and the living is slow, hot and easy on the yearly vacation in the Catskills for the Jewish Kantrowitz family.  A young wife and mother, Pearl (Diane Lane), who was married at 17, expends an emotional lifetime during the coarse of weeks after meeting someone new that breathes new life into her very domestic life.  Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), 'The Blouse Man' who sells his clothing to the campground bungalow's wives and daughters, finds a kindred soul in Pearl and slowly leads her on a sensual journey back to what she had thought was long gone in her marriage or progressing for her life.  In the summer of 1969, Neil Armstrong takes his historic walk on the moon while Pearl remembers that her circumstances haven't left her lacking but awaken to make her feel youthful all over again. She feels young, sensual and attractive, just not for her husband any longer, just sort of there for the family and definitely not special.Tony Goldwyn takes a break from acting and nicely segues into this, his directing debut.  Adding just the right cinematography of the area Catskills and a gorgeously alive soundtrack which brings the late sixties music scene right to the film seemingly without effort.  The music studies the era with the sounds of Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Janis Joplin and Jefferson Airplane, among many other song choices.  'The times they are a changin'.  Pearl was just seventeen when she married husband Marty (Liev Schreiber), it was a different time that had very structured roles for women.  They were totally domestic, fulfilling family duties leaving little to no time for herself without complaint.  Pearl gave up her younger years to have their daughter, now fourteen year old Alison (Anna Paquin), then followed up with a young son, Daniel (Bobby Boriello).  Alison is quite rebellious being a part of this newer generation, the hip scene and is ready to stretch out her arms to embrace life, if a bit too early.  She is planning to go with a boy she has met there at the Catskills town to a festival that no one really knows too much about; Woodstock.  It is the place to be, the place to hear the bands, the place where the young go to hang out.  Her grandmother, Marty's mother Lillian (Tovah Feldshuh, who is so good in this), aids Alison in getting around and helps with their care while she is there each summer.  She is very insightful and intuitive, picking up on a budding attraction between Walker and Pearl while son Marty is away repairing televisions at his workplace during the week.  She is neither condescending nor shaming of Pearl, only reminds her where her devotion should be and that is with her family, her priorities are not in question.By this time Pearl and Walker are embroiled in a torrid, steamy, and loving affair. They cannot ignore their mutual yearning for each other. Their attraction jumps off of the screen and is almost tangible to the viewer, it is that well shown.  Pearl is leaving the children with her mother-in-law to meet her lover, and the two are sharing a symbiotic relationship.  He is fully able to fill the need that Pearl has for being young and being fully herself.  She is just as caught up in this heady atmospheric time of being uninhibited and mutually loving freely.  Pearl and Walker attend Woodstock together and end up discovered by the wandering eyes of Alison who becomes unhinged by seeing her mother's hazy and drug induced behavior.  Trouble is, Alison does not confront her mother yet because she is so dazed by viewing what she has seen.  More trouble being that there is no 'bad guy' here with Walker or Marty.  They are both good guys, understanding, and loving in their own ways although when Marty discovers Pearl's betrayal, he is torn apart by his wife.There is much solid love between Marty and Pearl, along with their children, and a history together.  There is love between Walker and Pearl along with sensuality and newfound life.  Pearl is caught in love with these two men of different generations, totally enjoying herself with a giving man in Walker and a loving husband in Marty.  It is Pearl's time to decide how she should live her life.  Pearl is overwhelmingly torn.  Can she walk away from her family to the strong and overwrought desire and a lustful sweetness she has for Walker and feel young and intoxicatingly free?  Does she remain with Marty in what has become reliant, steadfast and predictable?  Or, can she put aside everyone's feelings and finally act on her own. Pearl has a magnanimous decision to make which could hurt many people, but could satisfy her own desires for her life.  A lifetime that is not domestic but could offer her complete freedom.",4,"""Summertime, And The Livin' Is Easy ..."" - Janis Joplin (Big Brother And The Holding Company)",1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,4702,"['Summertime', 'living', 'slow', 'hot', 'easy', 'yearly', 'vacation', 'Catskills', 'Jewish', 'Kantrowitz', 'family', 'young', 'wife', 'mother', 'Pearl', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'who', 'was', 'married', '17', 'emotional', 'lifetime', 'coarse', 'weeks', 'meeting', 'someone', 'new', 'new', 'life', 'very', 'domestic', 'life', 'Walker', 'Jerome', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'who', 'clothing', 'campground', 'bungalow', 'wives', 'daughters', 'kindred', 'soul', 'Pearl', 'slowly', 'sensual', 'journey', 'back', 'what', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'long', 'gone', 'marriage', 'progressing', 'life', 'summer', '1969', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'historic', 'walk', 'moon', 'Pearl', 'remembers', 'circumstances', 'have', ""n't"", 'left', 'lacking', 'awaken', 'make', 'feel', 'youthful', 'over', 'again', 'young', 'sensual', 'attractive', 'just', 'not', 'husband', 'longer', 'just', 'sort', 'family', 'definitely', 'not', 'special.Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'break', 'acting', 'nicely', 'segues', 'directing', 'debut', 'Adding', 'just', 'right', 'cinematography', 'area', 'Catskills', 'gorgeously', 'alive', 'soundtrack', 'late', 'sixties', 'music', 'scene', 'right', 'film', 'seemingly', 'effort', 'music', 'studies', 'era', 'sounds', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'many', 'other', 'song', 'choices', 'times', 'are', 'changin', 'Pearl', 'was', 'just', 'seventeen', 'when', 'married', 'husband', 'Marty', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'was', 'different', 'time', 'had', 'very', 'structured', 'roles', 'women', 'were', 'totally', 'domestic', 'fulfilling', 'family', 'duties', 'leaving', 'little', 'time', 'herself', 'complaint', 'Pearl', 'gave', 'up', 'younger', 'years', 'have', 'daughter', 'now', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'Alison', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'then', 'followed', 'up', 'young', 'son', 'Daniel', 'Bobby', 'Boriello', 'Alison', 'quite', 'rebellious', 'being', 'part', 'newer', 'generation', 'hip', 'scene', 'ready', 'stretch', 'out', 'arms', 'embrace', 'life', 'bit', 'too', 'early', 'planning', 'go', 'boy', 'met', 'Catskills', 'town', 'festival', 'one', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'Woodstock', 'place', 'be', 'place', 'hear', 'bands', 'place', 'where', 'young', 'go', 'hang', 'out', 'grandmother', 'Marty', 'mother', 'Lillian', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'aids', 'Alison', 'getting', 'around', 'care', 'there', 'summer', 'very', 'insightful', 'intuitive', 'picking', 'up', 'budding', 'attraction', 'Walker', 'Pearl', 'son', 'Marty', 'away', 'repairing', 'televisions', 'workplace', 'week', 'condescending', 'shaming', 'Pearl', 'only', 'where', 'devotion', 'should', 'be', 'family', 'priorities', 'are', 'not', 'question.By', 'time', 'Pearl', 'Walker', 'are', 'embroiled', 'torrid', 'steamy', 'loving', 'affair', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'mutual', 'yearning', 'other', 'attraction', 'screen', 'almost', 'tangible', 'viewer', 'well', 'shown', 'Pearl', 'leaving', 'children', 'mother-in-law', 'meet', 'lover', 'two', 'are', 'sharing', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'fully', 'able', 'fill', 'need', 'Pearl', 'being', 'young', 'being', 'fully', 'just', 'as', 'caught', 'up', 'heady', 'atmospheric', 'time', 'being', 'uninhibited', 'mutually', 'loving', 'freely', 'Pearl', 'Walker', 'attend', 'Woodstock', 'together', 'end', 'up', 'discovered', 'wandering', 'eyes', 'Alison', 'who', 'unhinged', 'seeing', 'mother', 'hazy', 'drug', 'induced', 'behavior', 'Trouble', 'Alison', 'not', 'confront', 'mother', 'yet', 'so', 'dazed', 'viewing', 'what', 'seen', 'More', 'trouble', 'being', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'here', 'Walker', 'Marty', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'understanding', 'loving', 'own', 'ways', 'when', 'Marty', 'Pearl', 'betrayal', 'torn', 'apart', 'wife.There', 'much', 'solid', 'love', 'Marty', 'Pearl', 'children', 'history', 'together', 'love', 'Walker', 'Pearl', 'sensuality', 'newfound', 'life', 'Pearl', 'caught', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'different', 'generations', 'totally', 'enjoying', 'giving', 'man', 'Walker', 'loving', 'husband', 'Marty', 'Pearl', 'time', 'decide', 'how', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'Pearl', 'overwhelmingly', 'torn', 'Can', 'walk', 'away', 'family', 'strong', 'overwrought', 'desire', 'lustful', 'sweetness', 'Walker', 'feel', 'young', 'intoxicatingly', 'free', 'remain', 'Marty', 'what', 'become', 'reliant', 'steadfast', 'predictable', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'everyone', 'feelings', 'finally', 'act', 'own', 'Pearl', 'magnanimous', 'decision', 'make', 'could', 'hurt', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'satisfy', 'own', 'desires', 'life', 'lifetime', 'not', 'domestic', 'could', 'offer', 'complete', 'freedom']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

What do you do?

468704,A14HHOT9999Z22,6305537801,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[14, 16]","Goldwyn, with platinum Hollywood credentials courtesy of being the grandson of Samuel Goldwyn (as in Metro-*Goldwyn*-Mayer), is relatively new to the directing business - this is his debut, and he's directed two others since. He is better known as an actor for his roles in *Ghost*, *The Pelican Brief* and *Nixon."" In the HBO miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon, "" Goldwyn played astronaut Neil Armstrong, first man to walk on the moon, and perhaps was inspired to base this film, called *A Walk on the Moon*, on unrelated events that occur on that famous night. Goldwyn also seemed to take a good long look at *Dirty Dancing* before he made this film - unarguably a dangerous proposition - but he seemed to be able to determine what parts of it were charming and which parts were schlock. He, thankfully, left most of the schlock on the cutting room floor. Like *Dirty Dancing*, it is the story of a Jewish family spending the summer at a resort in upstate New York. Where *Dirty Dancing* took place in 1963 as the world was just beginning to notice the changes, *Moon* is set in the summer of 1969 and the world's already on fire, but these people don't know it. Diane Lane and Liev Schreiber play Pearl and Marty Kantrowitz, a young blue-collar couple who began having children at a very young age, missing out on their own youth. As their daughter, Alison (Paquin), comes of age, she faces the inevitable gulf that separates her from her parents - it was a requirement that children felt estranged from their parents in 1969 - but her parents simply aren't that much older than she is. Life is pretty dull at the resort, with the highlights being visits from the ""Knish Man,"" the ""Ice Cream Man"" and the ""Blouse Man."" Pearl, who finds herself alone during the week while Marty goes back into the city to work, falls hard for the ""Blouse Man,"" a hippie who lives life on his own terms (the movie had the regrettable working title of *Blouse Man*). The entire resort is excited about the impending moonwalk, but Marty won't be able to make it back in time to see it with Pearl. Pearl spends the night in her own world of celestial bodies and shooting stars as she gives herself to the hippie blouse man. Meanwhile, not far away, is this event happening - no one really knows what it's about - it's called ""Woodstock."" Daughter Alison wants to go, but is forbidden to. She runs away and goes anyway, running into - who else? - her mother who has been taken there by the Blouse Man. Mom inadvertently gets dosed with acid and trips out, and daughter comes unglued over it, screaming, ""I'm the teenager! Not you! You're my mom!"" The story gets a little messy here and there, as daughter comes to terms with the fact that she may not be quite so different from her parents, and the parents come to terms with the fact that modern life has just about left them in the dust. It is a touching ending as the parents are trying to work it out between them, which seemed somehow unusual - it the Sixties most parents would have split up to ""find themselves."" It is a refreshing film, nonetheless, with a very good performance from Lane and a number a good performances from lesser-known cast members.",3,Not bad at all...,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3196,"['Goldwyn', 'platinum', 'Hollywood', 'credentials', 'courtesy', 'being', 'grandson', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'Metro-*Goldwyn*-Mayer', 'relatively', 'new', 'directing', 'business', 'debut', 'directed', 'two', 'others', 'better', 'known', 'actor', 'roles', '*Ghost*', '*The', 'Pelican', 'Brief*', '*Nixon', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'Earth', 'Moon', 'Goldwyn', 'played', 'astronaut', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'first', 'man', 'walk', 'moon', 'perhaps', 'was', 'inspired', 'base', 'film', 'called', '*A', 'Walk', 'Moon*', 'unrelated', 'events', 'occur', 'famous', 'night', 'Goldwyn', 'also', 'seemed', 'take', 'good', 'long', 'look', '*Dirty', 'Dancing*', 'made', 'film', 'unarguably', 'dangerous', 'proposition', 'seemed', 'be', 'able', 'determine', 'what', 'parts', 'were', 'charming', 'parts', 'were', 'schlock', 'thankfully', 'left', 'most', 'schlock', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', '*Dirty', 'Dancing*', 'story', 'Jewish', 'family', 'spending', 'summer', 'resort', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'Where', '*Dirty', 'Dancing*', 'took', 'place', '1963', 'world', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'notice', 'changes', '*Moon*', 'set', 'summer', '1969', 'world', 'already', 'fire', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'play', 'Pearl', 'Marty', 'Kantrowitz', 'young', 'blue-collar', 'couple', 'who', 'began', 'having', 'children', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'missing', 'out', 'own', 'youth', 'daughter', 'Alison', 'Paquin', 'age', 'inevitable', 'gulf', 'parents', 'was', 'requirement', 'children', 'felt', 'estranged', 'parents', '1969', 'parents', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'older', 'Life', 'pretty', 'dull', 'resort', 'highlights', 'being', 'visits', 'Knish', 'Man', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'Man', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'Pearl', 'who', 'alone', 'week', 'Marty', 'back', 'city', 'work', 'hard', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'hippie', 'who', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'movie', 'had', 'regrettable', 'working', 'title', '*Blouse', 'Man*', 'entire', 'resort', 'excited', 'impending', 'moonwalk', 'Marty', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'make', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'Pearl', 'Pearl', 'night', 'own', 'world', 'celestial', 'bodies', 'shooting', 'stars', 'hippie', 'blouse', 'man', 'Meanwhile', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'event', 'happening', 'one', 'really', 'what', 'called', 'Woodstock', 'Daughter', 'Alison', 'go', 'forbidden', 'away', 'anyway', 'running', 'who', 'else', 'mother', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'there', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'Mom', 'inadvertently', 'dosed', 'acid', 'trips', 'out', 'daughter', 'unglued', 'screaming', ""'m"", 'teenager', 'Not', ""'re"", 'mom', 'story', 'little', 'messy', 'here', 'there', 'daughter', 'terms', 'fact', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'different', 'parents', 'parents', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'modern', 'life', 'just', 'about', 'left', 'dust', 'touching', 'ending', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'seemed', 'somehow', 'unusual', 'Sixties', 'most', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'split', 'up', 'find', 'refreshing', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Lane', 'number', 'good', 'performances', 'lesser-known', 'cast', 'members']",A Walk on the Moon VHS

As for the movie itself, it takes on the theme of adultery, growing pains and family life set against the backdrop of Woodstock and man's landing on the moon.Diane Lane plays Pearl Kantrowitz who married young [to her high school sweetheart] and her husband is played  by Liev Schreiber, a T.V. repairman. They lead a typical middle-class life with their two children, 14-year-old daughter [Anna Paquin] and a young son. It is the summer of 69 and the Kantrowitz family, including grandma Bubbie[Tovah Feldshuh], head off to the Catskills where they join a bungalow colony of similar working class Jewish people and everything seems idyllic on the surface except for Pearl's dissatisfaction with her humdrum existence [""I haven't made a decision in ten years, except whether to shop at A&P; or Waldbaum's""] and things are not helped by her husband's long working hours and absence.Enter the ""Blouse Man"" aka Walker Jerome [played by pre-LOTR and Eastern Promises Viggo Mortensen] who stirs something primitive and dormant in Pearl and both engage in a summer of forbidden passion. When Pearl's husband eventually finds out, all hell breaks loose, and Pearl  has some tough decisions to make.I felt that the script itself needed some tweaking as it often felt like a melodrama that seemed to drag in parts. What lifted the movie above melodrama however was the fine cast - Diane Lane's Pearl is well-defined as the bored and jaded housewife seeking some form of self-actualization, even if it takes the form of adultery. Viggo Mortensen brings some depth to the character of the 'other' man, Liev Shreiber does a pretty decent job as the confused and hurt husband, and there are also some other strong supporting roles. Anna Paquin plays an angry adolescent who rages against her parents yet is quite vulnerable, and Tovah Feldshuh deserves special mention as the 'all-seeing' Bubbie who can spot a disaster from miles away.All in all, this is a pretty decent drama that could have been great if it had a stronger script. The theme of adultery is inadequately dealt with, yet on the whole, it is entertaining and the scenes of Woodstock etc make for a fun watch.",3,The Blouse Man & the Unfulfilled Wife,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2310,"['other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'felt', 'title', 'A', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'suited', 'theme', 'movie', 'just', 'opinion', 'movie', 'theme', 'adultery', 'growing', 'pains', 'family', 'life', 'set', 'backdrop', 'Woodstock', 'man', 'landing', 'moon.Diane', 'Lane', 'Pearl', 'Kantrowitz', 'who', 'married', 'young', '[', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', ']', 'husband', 'played', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'T.V', 'repairman', 'lead', 'typical', 'middle-class', 'life', 'two', 'children', '14-year-old', 'daughter', '[', 'Anna', 'Paquin', ']', 'young', 'son', 'summer', '69', 'Kantrowitz', 'family', 'including', 'grandma', 'Bubbie', '[', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', ']', 'head', 'Catskills', 'where', 'join', 'bungalow', 'colony', 'similar', 'working', 'class', 'Jewish', 'people', 'everything', 'idyllic', 'surface', 'Pearl', 'dissatisfaction', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'decision', 'ten', 'years', 'shop', 'A', 'P', 'Waldbaum', ']', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'helped', 'husband', 'long', 'working', 'hours', 'absence.Enter', 'Blouse', 'Man', 'aka', 'Walker', 'Jerome', '[', 'played', 'pre-LOTR', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', ']', 'who', 'stirs', 'something', 'primitive', 'dormant', 'Pearl', 'engage', 'summer', 'forbidden', 'passion', 'When', 'Pearl', 'husband', 'eventually', 'out', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Pearl', 'tough', 'decisions', 'make.I', 'felt', 'script', 'needed', 'tweaking', 'often', 'felt', 'melodrama', 'seemed', 'drag', 'parts', 'What', 'lifted', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'however', 'was', 'fine', 'cast', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Pearl', 'well-defined', 'bored', 'jaded', 'housewife', 'seeking', 'form', 'self-actualization', 'even', 'form', 'adultery', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'depth', 'character', ""'other"", 'man', 'Liev', 'Shreiber', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'confused', 'hurt', 'husband', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'angry', 'adolescent', 'who', 'parents', 'yet', 'quite', 'vulnerable', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'special', 'mention', ""'all-seeing"", 'Bubbie', 'who', 'can', 'spot', 'disaster', 'miles', 'away.All', 'pretty', 'decent', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'had', 'stronger', 'script', 'theme', 'adultery', 'inadequately', 'dealt', 'yet', 'whole', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'Woodstock', 'etc', 'make', 'fun', 'watch']",A Walk on the Moon VHS
