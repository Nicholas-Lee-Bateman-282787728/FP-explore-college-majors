140462,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792838327,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I had heard many good things about `Six Degrees of Separation', especially when in regards to Will Smith's performance.  Finally, a few nights back, I had the chance to check it out and I must say that Will Smith is not the only reason to watch this fantastic film; in fact there is so much good going here I'm shocked the only recognition the film received was a mere Best Actress nomination for Stockard Channing (who is phenomenal).The film follows Louisa (Ouisa) and John (Flan) Kittredge as they recount their dealings with con-man Paul, a young African American who claims to be school friends with their children, and son of the famous Sidney Poitier.  Paul shows up at their front door claiming to have been mugged.  He's bleeding and says that his dear friends, Woody and Tess, told him that their parents were the kindest souls in the world, and so he knew where he needed to go.  Ouisa and Flan immediately drop their plans for the evening and allow Paul to cook for them and shower them with stories of his life.  They are fascinated by this young man, so much so that they offer him a room for the night; but upon their waking in the morning they find that Paul is not all that he seems.What is so wonderful about this movie is that it brilliantly captures the root of the characters actions.  It fleshes out the emotional turmoil these different class distinctions go through.  It's not about money though; it's about that feeling of belonging.Paul, a young troubled man, just wants to feel as though he has a family, people who love him, and so he cons wealthy parents who barely speak to their own children into speaking to him.  He thrives off of their company, and he knows that they thrive off of his.  Ouisa and Flan hardly see their own children, and this is especially difficult on Ouisa.  She finds in Paul a part of herself, a parental longing, that she has been waiting to express for so long, and this becomes apparent even after Paul's faade is broken.  Paul knows what he must do to gain her affection, and she is desperate to express it.Some have baulked at the performances, claiming that they are over-the-top and unrealistic, but I think that those critics (see, I refer to my fellow reviewers as critics because in all honesty, that's what we are here) are missing the point.  This is a film adaptation of a stage-play, and stage acting is much more theatrical than screen acting.  `Six Degrees of Separation' carries the same feel as the play as apposed to keeping the story but changing the atmosphere (ala `Proof' or the recent `Bug').  When you watch `Six Degrees of Separation' you might as well be sitting in the theater, for the performances are as richly fulfilled as if they were performing for a live audience.On that note.Yes, Will Smith is fantastic.  He really captures the air of someone who is faking his way into our hearts.  I never once thought that his faade was real, and I think this helps add weight to the fact that these parents are desperately seeking his form of attention.  They are longing for some interaction with their own children that they overlook any and all of inconsistencies in Paul's story just to keep him near to them.  Channing is utterly brilliant here as well, truly capturing the plight of her character.  Sutherland is also great as Flan, offsetting Ouisa's sentiment with that strong male logic that clouds over his emotional state.  The supporting cast is fine indeed, Ian McKellen has a nice small role, but the three leads are truly the most memorable and make the biggest impression.`Six Degrees of Separation' is a marvelous character study, a film that allows us to peer inside ourselves and find the parts of us that long to belong, and ultimately ask ourselves how far we'd be willing to go to attain the attention we so desperately desire.",5,How far would you go to feel that connection?,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,3828,"['had', 'heard', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'especially', 'when', 'regards', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance', 'Finally', 'few', 'nights', 'back', 'had', 'chance', 'check', 'must', 'say', 'Will', 'Smith', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'fantastic', 'film', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'going', 'here', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'only', 'recognition', 'film', 'received', 'was', 'mere', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'who', 'phenomenal', '.The', 'film', 'Louisa', 'Ouisa', 'John', 'Flan', 'Kittredge', 'recount', 'dealings', 'con-man', 'Paul', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'who', 'be', 'school', 'friends', 'children', 'son', 'famous', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Paul', 'up', 'front', 'door', 'claiming', 'have', 'been', 'mugged', 'bleeding', 'dear', 'friends', 'Woody', 'Tess', 'told', 'parents', 'were', 'kindest', 'souls', 'world', 'so', 'knew', 'where', 'needed', 'go', 'Ouisa', 'Flan', 'immediately', 'drop', 'plans', 'evening', 'allow', 'Paul', 'cook', 'shower', 'stories', 'life', 'are', 'fascinated', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'room', 'night', 'waking', 'morning', 'find', 'Paul', 'not', 'so', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'root', 'characters', 'actions', 'out', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'different', 'class', 'distinctions', 'go', 'not', 'money', 'feeling', 'belonging.Paul', 'young', 'troubled', 'man', 'just', 'feel', 'family', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'so', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'who', 'barely', 'speak', 'own', 'children', 'speaking', 'company', 'thrive', 'Ouisa', 'Flan', 'hardly', 'see', 'own', 'children', 'especially', 'difficult', 'Ouisa', 'Paul', 'part', 'herself', 'parental', 'longing', 'been', 'waiting', 'express', 'so', 'long', 'apparent', 'even', 'Paul', 'faade', 'broken', 'Paul', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'gain', 'affection', 'desperate', 'express', 'it.Some', 'have', 'baulked', 'performances', 'claiming', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'unrealistic', 'think', 'critics', 'see', 'refer', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'critics', 'honesty', 'what', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'film', 'adaptation', 'stage-play', 'stage', 'acting', 'much', 'more', 'theatrical', 'screen', 'acting', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'same', 'feel', 'play', 'apposed', 'keeping', 'story', 'changing', 'atmosphere', 'ala', 'Proof', 'recent', 'Bug', 'When', 'watch', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'sitting', 'theater', 'performances', 'are', 'richly', 'fulfilled', 'were', 'performing', 'live', 'audience.On', 'note.Yes', 'Will', 'Smith', 'fantastic', 'really', 'air', 'someone', 'who', 'faking', 'way', 'hearts', 'never', 'once', 'thought', 'faade', 'was', 'real', 'think', 'add', 'weight', 'fact', 'parents', 'are', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'form', 'attention', 'are', 'longing', 'interaction', 'own', 'children', 'overlook', 'inconsistencies', 'Paul', 'story', 'just', 'keep', 'Channing', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'truly', 'capturing', 'plight', 'character', 'Sutherland', 'also', 'great', 'Flan', 'offsetting', 'Ouisa', 'sentiment', 'strong', 'male', 'logic', 'emotional', 'state', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'indeed', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'nice', 'small', 'role', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'truly', 'most', 'memorable', 'make', 'biggest', 'impression.', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'marvelous', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'peer', 'find', 'parts', 'long', 'belong', 'ultimately', 'ask', 'how', 'far', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'attain', 'attention', 'so', 'desperately', 'desire']",N/A

140465,APP5MBH2BSX6I,0792838327,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[3, 5]","This little film is fascinating almost beyond words.  It plumbs beneath the veneer of such subject matter as wealth, liberalism, sexuality, morals, and power, without leaving New York's upper east side except for one scene.Will Smith was just a fresh rappa/prince when he scored this role, and is mesmerizing as a young man of mysterious means and background.  He arrives at the fashionable doorstep of socialites Donald Sutherland & Stockard Channing (Oscar winner in this role, having also won a Tony for her stage version of the same part) and charms them, and us, in ways that surprise them, and us.I really am loath to give away much more than that.  Suffice to say that all the primary actors are perfect beyond words in their roles, and Smith is an absolute revelation, his character blossoming and then unraveling in fascinating ways.  The script from which these characters spring is pure prose, a lovely experience for anyone who loves the language.My only real problems with the film are its sometimes graphic moments in terms of sex and language (although it's admitted that these are jarring and graphic for valid artistic reasons) and the fact that the children of these socialites (and the children of their upper-class friends) are played way, way overly shrill and over the top.

Their investigations are intriguing and lead temaet to re vurdering their straight.Six Degrees of Separation stars Will Smith, in a role he was born to play. It was a challenging role for Will Smith; you might even say it was a stretch. Why was Will Smith born to play Paul, a homosexual con man who has conned people for so long that he has almost conned himself that he is the son of Sidney Poi tier. The Fresh Prince of Bel Aire was Will's first acting role. Before that, he was only a rapper with a few novelty songs in heavy rotation on MTV. In a recent interview Mr. Smith confided that he attacked his acting, and learned not only his own lines by heart, but the entire script, and if you watch him closely, you'll see his lips move, lip synching the lines of the other actors. He has come a long way since then, but this early performance is really where you see the talented actor emerge. It is a quiet, subtle, nuanced breakthrough, but a breakthrough, nonetheless.The talented Mr. Smith is on two parallel journeys: The first journey is Will Smith, The Actor, honing his craft--but also ACTING! as Jon Lovitz's overblown thespian used to say. Meanwhile, his character is on a similar odyssey. His character, Paul, is practicing his pronunciation of the word: ""bottle."" He is saying ""Hello"" as if rehearsing for a job interview. Trent (The venerable Anthony Michael Hall) proves a veritable Professor Henry Higgins to young Paul, his Eliza Doolittle, and his Pygmalion.Cuts between Paul, rehearsing 'Hello,' and Flan and Ouisa, are yet another example of the artful editing that makes this film so delightful. As the art dealers, Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing turn in great performances both, but it is Stockard who really steals the show. Her take on the liberal, though shallow, Ouisa is breathtaking, as she takes her character on a journey of discovery, gradually gaining awareness, even if her new insight now allows her to see through the fraud and self-delusions of Paul.Yet they do make a connection. They bond closer than she has bonded with her own children. She gives Paul an old pink shirt, and when her son hears of it he flies into a tirade. How could she? How dare she! But the louder his tantrums, the more we sympathize with his long suffering mom. Tess, Doug, and Woody, are horrible children.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tess: He offered you parts in Cats? I thought you hated Cats. You said it was an all time low in a lifetime of theatre going. You said, ""Aeschylus did not invent the theatre to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids in cat suits prancing around wondering which of them will go to kitty-cat heaven.""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tess: I will not be part of this conspiracy!Flan: It's not a conspiracy, it's a family!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Woody: That was my first shirt for my new body!The shallow Ouisa, from the first part of the film, says the most inane things. Like when she makes the observation that whenever she hears a phrase like ""striking miners"" she pictures miners modeling the fall fashions, looking striking as they stroll the catwalk. ""Chaos, control. Chaos, control. You like, you like?"" she says, while displaying a two-sided Kandinsky, their set piece when hawking their wares. Later, somehow it seems like somewhere along the line she has gone through a metamorphosis, and will never be the same.She and Flan live a high-powered, jet set kind of life, but they are also fragile humans, and some of the most touching scenes are where Donald Sutherland shows his soft white underbelly, and confesses to his deepest darkest fears. He loves the life they live in New York, but they are always just one painting away from being thrown out on the streets. New York is expensive, and the money can run out quickly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ouisa: I am a collage of unaccounted for brush strokes. I am all random.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ouisa Kittredge: There is so much you don't know.

He paints and paints, works on a canvas for months, and then one day he loses it - loses the structure, loses the sense of it. You lose the painting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul: The imagination. It's there to sort out your nightmare, to show you the exit from the maze of your nightmare, to transform the nightmare into dreams, that become your bedrock. If we do not listen to that voice, it dies, it shrivels, it vanishes. The imagination is not our escape. On the contrary, the imagination is the place we are all trying to get to.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ouisa Kitteridge: I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation between us and everyone else on this planet. The President of the United States, a gondolier in Venice, just fill in the names. I find it extremely comforting that we're so close. I also find it like Chinese water torture, that we're so close because you have to find the right six people to make the right connection... I am bound, you are bound, to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul: Every moment in life is a learning experience. Or what good is it, right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ouisa Kittredge: Don't think about elephants.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Flan Kittredge: Why do you stay in South Africa?Geoffrey: One has to stay there.

I wish you'd come and visit.Ouisa Kittredge: Oh, would we visit you and sit in your gorgeous house, planning visits to the townships, demanding to see the poorest of the poor? ""Oh, are you sure they're the worst off? I mean, we've come all this way. I mean, we don't want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid. We demand shock."" You know it doesn't seem right, sitting on the East Side, talking about revolution.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ouisa Kittredge: Chaos, control. Chaos, control. You like, you like?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Flan Kittredge: Having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes lifeboats.Ouisa: Only your friend gets very touchy if you say one word: lifeboat.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul: I believe the imagination is the passport that we create to help take us into the real world. I believe the imagination is merely another phrase for what is most uniquely us. Jung says, ""The greatest sin is to be unconscious.""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Trent: When rich people do something nice for you, you give 'em a pot of jam.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul: Did you see Donald Barthelme's obituary? He said that collage was the art form of the 20th century.Ouisa Kittredge: Everything is somebody else's.Paul: Not your children. Not your life.Ouisa Kittredge: No, you got me there. That is mine. That is nobody else's.Paul: You don't sound happy.Ouisa Kittredge: There is so much you don't know. You are so smart and so stupid.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul: Always remember the wine from the even numbered years is superior to the wine from the odd numbered years.The ending is suitably ambiguous.Bravo, John Guare, who wrote the play that it was based on, as well as the screenplay. His dialogue sizzles, and he doesn't stint on the high concept, either. The premise of the play, that this is a small world and we are all connected, has resonance and ramifications, especially in the new Information Age, what with Social Networking and the web of information on the Internet all the rage.Kevin Bacon, in a 1994 Premiere interview for the film The River Wild, while talking about his fame and career, comments that he's worked with everybody in Hollywood or someone who's worked with them.[citation needed]Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon first surfaced at about the same time.[citation needed] On April 7 1994, a lengthy newsgroup thread headed ""Kevin Bacon is the Center of the Universe"" appeared.The game was created in early 1994 by three students at Albright College, Craig Fass, Brian Turtle, and Mike Ginelli. According to an interview with the three in the Spring 1999 issue of the college's magazine, The Albright Reporter, they were watching Footloose during a heavy snowstorm. When the film was followed by Quicksilver they began to speculate on how many movies Bacon had been in and the number of people he'd worked with.In the interview Brian Turtle said, ""It became one of our stupid party tricks, I guess. People would throw names at us and we'd connect them to Kevin Bacon.""The trio wrote talk show host Jon Stewart a letter telling him that ""Kevin Bacon was the center of the entertainment universe"" and explaining the game.[citation needed]They appeared on The Jon Stewart Show and The Howard Stern Show with Bacon to explain the game. Bacon admitted that he initially disliked the game because he believed it was ridiculing him, but he eventually came to enjoy it. The three inventors of the game released the book Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon (ISBN 9780452278448) with an introduction written by Bacon; and a board game based on the concept was released by Endless Games.By the 2000s, the game was familiar enough to be referred to in United States popular culture. For example, In an episode of NBC's Will & Grace titled ""Bacon and Eggs"", Bacon makes a guest appearance, playing himself. During this episode, he makes an obvious reference to the game when talking with Will (played by Eric McCormack):Will: You-- you did a movie with Val Kilmer?Kevin: No, but Val was in Top Gun with Tom Cruise, and Tom was in A Few Good Men with me. Huh, that was a short one.Bacon also appeared in a commercial for the Visa check card that parodied the game. In the commercial, Bacon wants to write a check to buy a book, but the clerk asks for his ID and he does not have it. He leaves and returns with a group of people, then says to the clerk, ""Okay, I was in a movie with an extra, Eunice, whose hairdresser, Wayne, attended Sunday school with Father O'Neill, who plays racquetball with Dr. Sanjay, who recently removed the appendix of Kim, who dumped you sophomore year. So you see, we're practically brothers.""The concept was also presented in an episode of the TV show Mad About You dated November 19, 1996 in which a character expressed the opinion that every actor is only three degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon.Bacon provides the voice-over commentary for the NY Skyride attraction in the Empire State Building in New York City. At several points throughout the commentary Bacon alludes to his connections to Hollywood stars via other actors he has worked with.The Bacon number of an actor or actress is the number of degrees of separation they have from Bacon, as defined by the game. This is an application of the Erdos number concept to the movie industry. The higher the Bacon number, the farther away from Kevin Bacon the actor is.The computation of a Bacon number for actor X is a ""shortest path"" algorithm:If the lowest Bacon number of any actor with whom X has appeared in a movie is N, X's Bacon number is N + 1.Kevin Bacon himself has a Bacon number of 0.Here is an example, using Elvis Presley:Elvis Presley was in Change of Habit (1969) with Edward AsnerEdward Asner was in JFK (1991) with Kevin BaconTherefore Asner has a Bacon number of 1, and Presley has a Bacon number of 2.As of December 2007, the highest finite Bacon number reported by the Oracle of Bacon is 8.The American Civil War general William Rufus Shafter is frequently cited as having a Bacon number of 10, but his number is in fact only 7.Notable Bacon numbersRonald Reagan (Bacon number: 2)Ronald Reagan was in The Young Doctors (1961) with Eddie Albert.Eddie Albert was in The Big Picture (1989) with Kevin Bacon.Pope John Paul II (Bacon number: 3)Pope John Paul II was in Padre Pio -- Tra cielo e terra (2000) with Giovanni Lombardo Radice.Giovanni Lombardo Radice was in The Omen (2006) with Vee VimolmalVee Vimolmal was in Where the Truth Lies (2005) with Kevin BaconPaul Erdos, who is the centre of a similar network for mathematicians, had a Bacon number of 4 in 2007,[2] due to his appearance as himself in the 1993 film N Is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdos.Paul Erdos was in N is a Number with Gene Patterson.Gene Patterson was in Box of Moon Light (1996) with Catherine Keener.Catherine Keener was in Friends with Money (2006) with Marin Hinkle.Marin Hinkle was in Rails & Ties (2007) with Kevin Bacon.Once Frost/Nixon has been released, currently scheduled for late 2008, Paul Erdos will have a Bacon number of 3.Paul Erdos was in N is a Number with Gene Patterson.Gene Patterson was in Box of Moon Light (1996) with Sam Rockwell.Sam Rockwell will be in Frost/Nixon (2008) with Kevin BaconUndefined Bacon numbersA few actors have an undefined Bacon number, meaning that they cannot be linked to Bacon in any number of connections at all. According to the Oracle of Kevin Bacon website, approximately 12% of all actors cannot be linked to Bacon using their criteria. [4]The center of the Hollywood universeWhile at the University of Virginia, Brett Tjaden created the Oracle of Bacon, a computer program that uses information on some 800,000 people from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The algorithm calculates ""how good a center""[5] an individual IMDB personality is, i.e. a weighted average of the degree of separation of all the people that link to that particular person. The site returns an average personality number, i.e. for Clint Eastwood, it returns an average ""Clint Eastwood Number"". From there the Oracle site posits ""The Center of the Hollywood Universe"" as being the person with the lowest average personality number. Kevin Bacon, as it turns out, is not the ""Center of the Hollywood Universe"" (i.e. the most linkable actor). In fact, Bacon does not even make the top 1000 list of average personality numbers.[4] Since average personality numbers are dynamic (mercurial) and can change with each new film made, the Center can and does shift. ""Centers"" have included Rod Steiger, Dennis Hopper, and Donald Sutherland. Karen Black has been the highest ranked actress in the list.Photography bookInspired by the game, the British photographer Andy Gotts tried to reach Bacon through photographic links instead of film links.He wrote to 300 actors asking to take their pictures, and received permission from one, Joss Ackland. Ackland then suggested that Gotts photograph Greta Scacchi, with whom he had appeared in the film White Mischief. Gotts proceeded from there, asking each actor to refer him to one or more friends or colleagues. Eventually, Christian Slater referred him to Bacon. Gotts's photograph of Bacon completed the project, eight years after it began. Gotts published the photos in a book, Degrees (ISBN 0-9546843-6-2), with text by Alan Bates, Pierce Brosnan, and Bacon.Additional references in pop culture[Trivia sections are discouraged under Wikipedia guidelines].The article could be improved by integrating relevant items and removing inappropriate ones.In an episode Family Guy entitled ""Road to Rhode Island"", Stewie and Brian play the game.In the ""Mad About You"" episode ""Outbreak"", Season 5, episode 7, the character ""Paul Buchman"" uses the game to exemplify unforseen connections between a stranger from the elevator and his parents. At the end of the episode Kevin Bacon has a cameo as the boyfriend of the woman in the elevator.In the ""Spin City"" episode ""Hello Charlie"", Season 5, episode 1, the character ""Paul"" tries to stall a press-conference by linking different actors to Kevin Bacon.In the third episode of the second season of Joey, Joey's agent, Bobbie admits to love the game. She says ""lets see how many steps it takes to connect him to me. We did it on a boat.

It is strange to think that not only in big cities where people are anonymous or across rural hinterlands but all across the globe, thanks to internet and ease of travel, we are all far more intimately connected than ever before. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. The perils and glories of this interconnectedness form the plots of the film Six Degrees of Separation.The PlotsThe primary plot turns around a couple who are upper-middle-class New Yorkers, John Flanders 'Flan' and Ouisa Kittridge. They are upper-middle-class, but really live a very fragile existence. As one character puts it, 'they live hand-to-mouth, just on a higher plateau'. We experience some of the opulence and the tenuousness of their Upper East Side existence. Flan is an art dealer dealing in the gray market of shuffling unknown pieces between anonymous buyers and sellers, a human ebay portal for expensive works of art.One evening as Flan and Ouisa were planning to seduce a wealthy foreign friend into an investment scheme, the doorbell rings and an injured young man of colour wanders in. In the melee of getting him cleaned and bandaged, the conversation takes wild turns toward art, philosophy, literature, and culture. The couple and their guest are mesmerised by the talented young Harvard-educated son of Sydney Poitier. The evening is a success, the art deal is closed successfully, and all go their separate ways to sleep for the night, but not before extracting promised from the young Paul Poitier to be extras in the filming of 'Cats'.The next morning, however, the couple are surprised by another houseguest - a male prostitute picked up by the dapper young man from the night before. They are shocked, astonished, and throw the pair out of the house.Not long after this, Flan and Ouisa encounter more and more people who have 'entertained' the son of Poitier, who, as it turns out later, in fact has no sons, only daughters. As the growing band of the duped search out the mystery, they finally discover that Paul is in fact the gay pick-up of one of their children's misfit friends; he has been coached in the ways of society and most of the personalities so that he can slide in without giving a hint of his true origins, and his charm propels him the rest of the way, until finally his deceptions cost a young man his life. Paul, or whatever his name is, is arrested and sucked into the system, and the Kittridges cannot find him, because they cannot tell the police his name. He disappears as completely as before he came into their lives, destined to be for most, but not all, a story to dine out upon.Meanwhile, a line from early in the film, 'Chaos, control; chaos, control: you like? you like?' uttered by Ouisa as they foursome look at a Kandinsky painting becomes a motif for the entire film, as it alternates between chaos and control, much like life. Also much like life, one never knows where the chaos stops and the control begins, and vice versa.The CastingAgain, the casting was inspired. Will Smith, prior to this film best known for being the Fresh Prince of Bel Air or a rap artist, carries the male-hustler-turned-society-gallant role off to near perfection. Donald Sutherland is a perfect Flan, with a nervousness and not-so-subtle ambition well done in his usual manner. Ian McKellan gives a great cameo as the South African businessman who is in America briefly, who opines that he is merely serving his role in history to educate and raise up the black Africans, 'and we'll know we've done our jobs when they kill us.' A nice supporting cast carry the various encounters with other families caught in the web of deception, including the required brat-pack reference of Anthony Michael Hall, proclaimed the Henry Higgins of their day. But the true gem of this film is Stockard Channing, who played the role on stage. Her facial expressions, subtle and emotional reactions to the world around her as she reacts to the growing sense of reality that overtakes Ouisa as she realises the limitations of her own world, are almost flawlessly executed on screen. Her energy and physical presence is truly perfect for this role.Overall ImpressionsI always feel a bit of a chill when watching this film. Can my life be construed as equally phony? Not phony like Paul's, mind you, but phony like the Kittridges and all the other upper-middle-class pretenders? Aren't we all living hand-to-mouth in some respects? Don't we all long for escape. And indeed, the idea of six degrees of separation is very true to me. I have no degrees of separation between heads of state Europe and African tribesmen, corporate lawyers in America and Marine Corps riflemen in Saudi Arabia, missionaries and clerics in South America and near the North Pole, Japanese educators and Pakistani students. Of course the whole world is connected to me. But what good comes of this as I sink into bankruptcy? Have I been living the Kittridge's life, and am now to experience Paul's pre-Poitier existence?This is a film to make you think. You will be astonished at the sheer elegance and style, done with economy and opulence simultaneously. The same is true for the full menu of food for thought.

Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is brilliant.  It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow.Essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence.  Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble.  There are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made.

That is the theory behind this film directed by Fred Schepisi (""A Cry In The Dark"")and based on a play by John Guare. Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing are sophisticated New Yorkers who befriend a young man who maintains that he is the son of Sidney Poitier and that he is friends of their children who are away at college. Sutherland and Channing soon find out that they, along with other New Yorkers, have been conned by the fast-talking Paul played by Will Smith. And fast talker he is since he obviously convinced the director to cast him although, according to rumor, he was too uptight to kiss another man since he plays a homosexual in this film. We can all rest a little easier knowing that he kept his manhood intact.Both Sutherland and Channing give fine performances. She is a much underrated actress who can play a lot of different characters very well. The photography is excellent.

The point of the report was how dissociated or at least unaware the parents were of what their adolescent children were up to.This wonderful film is about in part spoilt children and the huge gap that exists between them and their parents - or at the least the horror the parents experience when the children mirror their values.  There is a wonderful scene when the wealthy Kitteredges (played by the SUPERB Mr Sutherland and Ms Stockard Channing) are abused for giving away their son's pink shirt to a wounded stranger.  Or the horror they experience when the children DON'T mirror theirb values.  Another scene features a telephone call from a student who tells her parents that she is getting married and going to Afghanistan to help the peasants in revenge against her parents for her highly privileged upbringing.In this fine film, Paul (Will Smith was BORN to play this role) brings joy to the people her interacts with and actually changes the life of some, especially Mrs Kitteridge.  Playing a ... black who is talented but poor, Mr Smith makes being an outsider in a materialistic hypocritical society a glamorous and attractive thing.  Good or bad?  It is also ravishingly photographed which fits one of its major themes - Western societies obsession with appearances - as well as fitted with excellent soundtrack.

This is one of the best films I have seen. It belongs to my favorite ""category"" of movies. I'm talking about movies where the dialouge IS the story. No special effects or great scenery is needed. Usually these types of films come from plays, for obvious reasons. If you still dont know what I mean by the dialouge does the work, check out a movie like ""12 Angry Men"".I have to say that the casting director for this movie did a wonderful job. The acting was suburb. My one complaint on the acting was Will Smith's lack of believeability as a homosexual man. He plays it well enough for the movie, but I assume the play presented this aspect of his character much better. I still can not believe that this film wasn't showered with Oscars, but at least the statues were saved for a movie that needs them to have people still renting the movies that won.Also, to the people like me who like to read all the bad reviews, before the good, let me tell you about the 3bad reviews somewhat. The one that was posted twice was written by a person who called both this is ""The Great Gatsby""(the book) boring. So, that may give you a clue that this movie is aimed for a more intellectual crowd. Another bad reviewer siad they enjoyed Smith only is such movies as ""Men in Black"", and ""Independence Day"". This again should show you the movie requires you to think. The other 1 star review I give a bit more credit. They didn't just say the movie was boring. They did not understand it. I think you should watch the movie at least twice (trust me, you'll want to watch it more) to understand it completely. Anyways, my point in that was showing you that was to let you know that this movie definately requires thought, and you WILL be dissappointed if you rent it expecting regular Will Smith movie.All and all, I loved this movie, and highly reccomend it. My only other complaint has to do with the DVD. The only ""Special Feature"" as they call it now on DVDs was the original trailer. I hope they eventually come out with another DVD with cast interviews, or something. Maybe talking with actors from the play. It would help a lot.

Donald Sutherland's character is insipid, which is, I suppose, what he is supposed to be, so I can't hold that against the actor.  Stockard Channing is very real in her role, and Will Smith basically carries the movie on his shoulders even though he isn't in all of the scenes.  He plays the role of an insane young man who pretends to be Sidney Poitier's son in order to wedge his way into the homes of wealthy people.  He gives them quite a ride, and gives himself one as well.  Obviously the story is farfetched, but not so farfetched as to be impossible.  Perhaps someone from an inner city background could pull that off, though I doubt it.  At the end we are informed that the Will Smith character is insane, as shown in a pathetic phone call from him to Stockard Channing in which he makes it clear that he actually believes himself to be who he is pretending to be.  His deepest, and pathetic, desire is to be a member of that wealthy society.This is a 4 or 5 star performance that ran into one of my biggest pet peeves in theatre, thereby dropping it to only 2 stars.  It failed to tie up loose ends and give us an ending.  We aren't told how it all turned out.  We aren't told if Will Smith is even alive at the end, and we're led to believe he may have committed suicide.  That's too big a loose end to leave dangling.  We aren't told if Stockard Channing is able to re-establish contact with him.If the movie industry wasn't in the habit of doing that to us, I'd perhaps consider it creative and original of them to leave us hanging on the ending, but they do it so often that it has become a cliche, and an annoying one.  In that final scene, when Stockard Channing finally walks away from her empty shell of a husband, I realized that ""they were doing it again"" about the loose ends and failure to provide an ending, and I just said ""roll the credits"" because I knew they would.  It was one of those scenes where they always roll the credits, in this case with Stockard Channing walking down a New York City street, away from her husband.  It was such a predictable cliche.In their sorry attempt at being creative with the ending, all they did was fall into a timeworn and extremely uncreative cliche.  You just want to slap the director for pulling that nonsense on us.  We have just given the director a couple of hours of our leisure time, and in turn we just received a slap in the face ourselves, not told how the story ends, not told if the character we have grown to care about is dead or alive.Not good work.

140493,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,0792838327,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[2, 16]","""Six Degrees of Separation"" was not the movie I expected.  I was hoping for some real laugh out loud comedy, not the affected, dry wit and snobbery of the New York class culture.  The dialogue was more like a Broadway play framing each character's obsession with obtaining fame and rubbing elbows with celebrities.The premise bored me, although I admit each actor did their best to keep the dialogue and the ""effervescence"" going.  Part of my issue is that I mistakenly thought that the Six Degrees of Separation dealt with ancestry.  Stockard Channing as Ouisa Kittredge explained what it means in one scene with her daughter.  Apparently you can connect with anyone on the planet by going through no more than six people.  For example, if you wanted to talk to President Obama (1) you can call an Aunt, who will  (2) call her best friend (3) who knows the Press assistant at the White House (4) whose boss (5) knows the president (6).How this connects with the movie was vague, other than Paul was part of the linkage.The movie looks at two arts and culture socialites, Ouisa Kittredge and her husband Flan (Donald) Sutherland, who are parents of children at Harvard and Groton.  Ouisa and Flann live like hermits in their Upper East Side apartment.  They have a doorman and worry constantly that their artwork or valuables will be stolen.  The children ignore their parents and they are pretty much schmoozing most of the time to get profitable art deals and this has been emotionally and financially draining.  They have a distorted view of the world as mean and they try to say inside an ""inbred"" society.Paul (Will Smith) is a con man who has studied to get into their world.  He finds sources to give him intimate details of the upper crust life and personal information.  Paul arrives in the Kittridges life, poses as the son of Sidney Poitier,  and worms his way into their hearts.  He does not seem to want any of their art or valuables but to be cared for and a part of their existence.  His shrewd con helps Flan seal an art deal and the Kittridges are giddy with the success and relief the deal brings.

Later on, i came to realize how important those draggy moments were.  This is a movie that got progressively better and better, and kept me engaged to the very end.  In a nutshell: Flan (what a name!) and Ouisa Kittredge are art dealers living in posh East Side and are entertaining a guest when this young black man drops by their apartment, victim of muggers.  He claims to be not only the son of Sidney Poitier, but also friends with the couple's children at Harvard.  He is so well spoken, exotic, fascinating, flattering, that soon he has everyone in that apartment wrapped around his little finger.  When you finally get to meet the children, you quickly understand the reason for that.  Paul Poitier is a classy con-artist that makes people fall in love with him.  For example, after explaining what his thesis is about (stolen by muggers), Flan Kittredge throws a passionate and outraged &quot;I hope your robbers read every page of it!&quot;  It is impossible not to like him.  After Paul does the rounds among the Kittredges' friends, he becomes cocktail party anecdote.  Ouisa is the one who eventually admits how much she cares for this boy and becomes incredibly guilty for not having helped him enough.  The best metaphor in the movie is represented by the Kandinski painting, the chaos-control canvas, because while on the surface it seems that Oiusa has her life under control with lots of money, powerful friends and poshy luxurious lifestyle, in fact she has another side where there is little sense of meaning.My biggest objection is the title music.  Somehow that chintzy violin tune clashed with the story big time.  The acting is magnificent, the NY shots beautiful, and there are some hilarious moments in the film, like the scene at The Rainbow Room.  This movie is a 10, a must-see, a masterpiece.

The film deals with the Kitteridges, Flan and Ouisa, and what happens to them when a gay hustler tricks his way into their lives one night. It forces Ouisa to re-evaluate what is really important to her; is their art-dealer existence, while affording them some degree of luxury, truly as satisfying as it seems? Or is it that she realises how truly superficial and empty their lives have become, every day filled with trivialised anecdotes and empty gallery talk.The actors here are mostly exceptional, Stockard Channing receiving an Oscar nomination for her zesty, sharp performance. Perhaps the only problem is Will Smith, who during production refused (apparently at Denzel Washington's request) to perform the gay kiss with Anthony Michael Hall. The resulting shot, with the kiss happening out of sight, is unsatisfying as it is unconvincing.Nevertheless, as the Kandinski references and Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful themes reflect, there is more to these characters than initially appears. The changes that are put in motion by the arrival of Smith's characters provoke a searching re-examination of the lives of the families who encounter him. It's hard to explain a film that requires so much thought, so I'll give up now. Needless to say, the acting and direction are top notch, and the script is as sharp as the dialogue is delivered.The transfer for the DVD is good, if not great.

The film is poetic in it's composition, and captivating in it's dialogue. &quot;The imagination - that's God's gift, to make the act of self-examination bearable.&quot;",5,Six Degrees is a masterpiece,997920000,"08 16, 2001",2001,563,"['Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'excellent', 'film', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'amazing', 'role', 'Ouisa', 'Kittredge', 'woman', 'who', 'outlook', 'life', 'be', 'profoundly', 'changed', 'chance', 'encounter', 'con', 'man', 'profound', 'film', 'idea', 'life', 'experiences', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'surface', 'learn', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'interconnected', 'how', 'much', 'affect', 'one', 'film', 'poetic', 'composition', 'captivating', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'imagination', 'God', 'gift', 'make', 'act', 'self-examination', 'bearable.', 'quot']",N/A

140509,A387BD735MI50R,0792838327,R. Schultz,"[3, 5]","This movie invites you into the conversation of New York's literati. In particular, we are invited into the living room of a couple who make their money by flipping paintings. Instead of flipping real estate properties, they flip valuable works of arts - buying what they can and reselling to higher bidders. This occupation may not seem to contribute much to society, but these aren't shallow, leeching people. They are fascinating to be around.It is very rare in modern movies to hear any sustained, interesting exchange of ideas. But this script made the transition from John Guare's stage play to the screen without being dumbed down. And viewers are treated to an intellectually and emotionally engaging drama as a result.But it is also just sheer enjoyment to inhabit the world of these characters. These are good, heartening people to hang out with. They truly listen to each other, and learn, and are sparked - by hearing each other's ideas and experiences. Most of all, they are sparked by the opinions of the young man who seems to land so fortuitously, so mysteriously in their midst, claiming to be Sidney Poitier's son.That's what sets this movie apart from virtually all others I've seen that feature the rich and favored. Instead of being miserable, depressed villains, these wealthy people are actually happy. Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland have wonderful chemistry together. They are delightful and delighted, almost innocently joyous. Most remarkable of all, they appreciate their wealth and do no harm with it. Where have you ever seen that before?!They have created a gracious, convivial life with their good fortune. So I can't really agree with Stockard Channing's concluding concern about turning the presumptive young Poitier into ""simply another anecdote."" She and her set may actually have turned the anecdote into a valuable art form, making it their unique contribution to the world. And perhaps the people who become the grist for these anecdotes, including the troubled young man, could aspire to nothing better than to live and be relived in perpetuity in the dinner table conversation of these celebratory people.You will walk away from this movie feeling better about humanity.

Halkin ""Tim""","[5, 7]","I saw Stockard Channing in John Guare's hit play ""Six Degrees of Separation"" on London's West End, and she (and of course the play) so blew me away, I couldn't get out of my seat afterwards.  I just remember going home with my friend, Maggie, and opening the first bottle of scotch we could find to ease the emotional disarray we were in.That said, you will not need that bottle of scotch after this film.  Even though it doesn't stray too far from the original script, the piece just doesn't work as well on film as it does on stage.  But we're not all so lucky as to live in a city that has major theatre productions, or the means to travel to such cities.  Hence, thank God for such attempts to film theatre masterpieces (i.e. Richard Burton in ""Equus"").Now to the film:  perfect cast!  Stockard Channing is one of the greatest actresses this generation has had the privilege of experiencing.  Her power is stronger live in a theatre, but she is still mesmerizing on screen; Donald Sutherland is the perfect choice for the role of her husband, but the big surprise is Will Smith.  Thank God that Denzel Washington couldn't talk him out of doing the role (according to an interview I read with Smith, Washington told him that he would have major career problems if he played the role of this emotionally disturbed homosexual youth - given Smith's career path, I'd say that Washington doesn't have a career as a fortune-teller).  It was Washington, however, who convinced him not to do the kiss scene that was in the original play (and originally in the screenplay, too).  Kiss or no kiss, Will Smith took a major chance, pulled it off beautifully, proved to the world that he really can act and moves you to the point of tears with his sensitive performance.This piece is base on a true story of an emotionally disturbed youth claiming to be the son of Sydney Poitier.  But if you didn't know that, you'd swear it had to be made up.  Sometime reality is truly better than fiction!

The man who says his name is Paul, claims to be friends of the Kittredge children. Over the evening Paul flatters the couple and a buisness guest they are hosting with his exotic tales and fascinating life stories. However, things aren't always what they seem to be. Like the painting in the movie, what is chaotic on one side, may be controlled on the other and vice versa.This was the first major film breakthrough for Will Smith, proving that he isn't just the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and is a serious actor. Donald Sutherland does a superb job as the stuck-up art dealer who makes millions of dollars but spends more than he can make. However, the real star of the movie is Stockard Channing. Her performance is perfect and her portrayal of Ouisa's self-disovery, realization, and spiritual redemption could not have been better.SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION has become a part of the American pop conscience (thanks largely to the Kevin Bacon game). However, the movie is much more than a pop cultural reference. It is a movie for the critical movie viewer.
