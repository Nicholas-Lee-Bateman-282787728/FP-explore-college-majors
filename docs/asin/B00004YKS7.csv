559370,A2XWMCSWQLT6VS,B00004YKS7,Alfredo,"[1, 1]","Blind, American bluesman Paul Pe&ntilde;a was going through a very tough period of his life, particularly after having lost his wife, when he came across a CD of Tuvan throat singing, with which he fell absolutely in love. (Tuva is a region in southern Siberia, just north from Mongolia.) Pe&ntilde;a not only taught himself throat singing and incorporated it to his blues, but also began to learn the Tuvan language by translating words from a Tuvan dictionary into Russian and then English, as he couldn't find a Tuvan-English dictionary. He then made contact with the Tuvan music community and flew there to join them. He might as well have traveled across the galaxy.It's amazing how, despite the language and cultural barriers, Pe&ntilde;a was able to establish a deep connection with his Tuvan hosts through a shared passion for music, particularly with the celebrated throat singer Kongar-ol Ondar, who took him under his wing during the visit. Seeing these two men jam and interact with each other, I had to wonder whether perhaps they'd been brothers in a previous lifetime! To think that they came from opposite sides of the world!Like Pe&ntilde;a, the film's audience is treated to the generous spirit of Tuvan society. What hospitality! While the region wouldn't seem to offer much in terms of material luxury, their culture puts things into perspective and raises questions regarding our own values. As clich&eacute; as it might sound, they show there's nothing in life like shared joy, human warmth and communication. And that's pretty much what this film is all about!It's true that one may find more sophisticated photography and editing in other documentaries, but what this one lacks in technical virtuosity, it more than makes up for in the amount of heart that it displays.

I had a nagging suspicion that I would become part of the small, dissident group of people who did not find this to be the uplifting, inspiring story that so many hail it as being.Not that I didn't want to love it.  The story fascinates me, and I didn't find Paul Pena to be as irritating as some reviewers did.  One can understand his frustration at being so disoriented, out of his element, and totally dependent on others.  If he is whiny, he has good reason to be.  However, I agree that some of his friends come across either as jerks or flakes, and that does tend to make the touring group as a whole less sympathetic.Mostly, I think the fault lies with Roko & Adrian Belic, who simply seem unable to sustain a coherent narrative.  A story like this should have been easily knocked out of the ballpark, but somehow the Belics managed instead to craft a meandering, poorly assembled story which repeatedly loses momentum.  At points (the vignette with the cursed shamanistic drum), the film wanders off into the downright flakey & lost my interest once and for all.  By that stage of the movie, I was just ready for it to be over with.The Belics had an opportunity to make a really really great documentary & fumbled it away.

What a beautiful story it is!  Not unlike the fictional protagonist in ""Schultze gets the Blues,"" Paul Pena, a blind musician living in San Francisco, was fiddling with his short-wave radio one day and came across some Mongolian music which turned out to be Tuvan throat singing, a fascinating art form virtually unknown in the United States.  Through long and exhaustive study (which included the laborious translation of songs from Tuvan to Russian to English, because there is no Tuvan-English dictionary, using Braille), Pena taught himself this genre and mastered the art to the point where he was invited to travel to Tuva and compete in the national throat singing competition.  The film includes a delightful cast of characters (""characters"" as in: unique individuals) who travel with Pena, and a fascinating look at the handsome and deeply spiritual Tuvan people, who welcomed Pena with incredible warmth and kindness -- to the point where he actually felt a stronger bond with them than with his community back in the U.S.  Truly a special film not to be missed.

559379,A1A535W556ROBQ,B00004YKS7,James Ferguson,"[39, 39]","This is a scenario not even Richard Feynman could have imagined when he helped to form Friends of Tuva. Thanks to this group's effort to bring Tuvan throat singers to San Francisco, Paul Pena was able to realize a dream that lifted him out of the depths of dispair and take part in the tri-annual Tuvan throat singing competition in Kyzyl.  This remarkable story not only tells the tale of Paul Pena, best known for penning Jet Airliner, but of the unconquerable spirit of Tuvans who for centuries were subjected to Chinese and Russian rule.  Deep in their throats they came up with a harmony that has beguiled musicians the world over.  But, it was Paul Pena who seemed to unlock the mystery to the western ear and not only take part but win over the Tuvan audience with his brand of kargyraa style singing.  The most amazing part of the story to me is that in order to learn Tuvan, Paul had to learn Russian in Braile in order to translate the words into English, since Tuvan was so rarely heard beyond the steppes of Asia.This film is so deeply satisfying in its honest presentation of events by the Belic brothers.  The enormity of such an undertaking hit them like a thunderbolt when Mario Castella, one of the few other Americans to appreciate Tuvan throat singing had a heart attack, and Paul was running low on medication to treat his depression.  Worried that it might be the drum the crew had bought as a souvenier, Kongar-ol Ondar, who had befriended Paul, had the evil spirit removed by a shaman.  The storm passed and Paul and the crew were able to enjoy the remaining days in Tuva with Kongar taking them to his home village where he was finally able to get Paul up on a horse and complete this incredible journey.This is a film you will want to purchase so that you can watch it again and again.

After reading Ralph Leighton's book ""Tuva or Bust!"", they contacted the author, who then introduced them to the blind blues guitarist Paul Pena.Mr. Pena had taught himself to throat sing Tuvan music while listening to the CD ""Tuva - Voices from the Centre of Asia"".  This was around the year 1991, during a period in which Paul was grieving the death of his wife.  Alone, in a small apartment in San Francisco, the process of learning Tuvan multiple overtone vocal music provided some much needed distraction from his personal troubles.Ralph Leighton was also an organizer of the group Friends of Tuva, which he co-founded with Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman.  The Friends of Tuva had invited some Tuvan musicians to America to sing as part of a cultural exchange program. During this visit, Mr. Pena formed friendships with the Tuvan vocalists and the idea for ""Genghis Blues"" was conceived.Every three years, a throat singing competition is held in Tuva's capital, Kyzyl.  Mr. Pena was invited to compete in a contest held there during the year of 1998.  This film follows Paul Pena and his new friends on their journey to that remote land, which remains mostly untouched by Western Civilization. The resulting documentary is a story of the hardship of foreign travel, the rewards of cultural exchange, the shared love of music and the creative pursuit of filmmaking.Though the film is often about experiencing atypical realities, in the closing performance of the blues standard, ""You Gotta Move"", we can also hear just how talented Paul Pena is in his native tongue.  ""Genghis Blues"" is a film for all who strive to maintain enthusiasm for relating with new people, hearing different points of view, and becoming involved with unique modes of shamanic cultural expression.",5,A Story About The Power of Music and Friendship,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,2057,"['Filmmakers', 'Roko', 'Adrian', 'Belec', 'graduated', 'college', 'desire', 'Never', 'work', 'real', 'job', 'life', 'extraordinarily', 'low', 'budget', 'decided', 'make', 'documentary', 'film', 'land', 'Tuva', 'country', 'north-western', 'border', 'Mongolia', 'reading', 'Ralph', 'Leighton', 'book', 'Tuva', 'Bust', 'contacted', 'author', 'who', 'then', 'introduced', 'blind', 'blues', 'guitarist', 'Paul', 'Pena.Mr', 'Pena', 'had', 'taught', 'throat', 'sing', 'Tuvan', 'music', 'listening', 'CD', 'Tuva', 'Voices', 'Centre', 'Asia', 'was', 'year', '1991', 'period', 'Paul', 'was', 'grieving', 'death', 'wife', 'Alone', 'small', 'apartment', 'San', 'Francisco', 'process', 'learning', 'Tuvan', 'multiple', 'overtone', 'vocal', 'music', 'provided', 'much', 'needed', 'distraction', 'personal', 'troubles.Ralph', 'Leighton', 'was', 'also', 'organizer', 'group', 'Friends', 'Tuva', 'co-founded', 'Nobel', 'prize', 'winning', 'physicist', 'Richard', 'Feynman', 'Friends', 'Tuva', 'had', 'invited', 'Tuvan', 'musicians', 'America', 'sing', 'part', 'cultural', 'exchange', 'program', 'visit', 'Mr.', 'Pena', 'formed', 'friendships', 'Tuvan', 'vocalists', 'idea', 'Genghis', 'Blues', 'was', 'conceived.Every', 'three', 'years', 'throat', 'singing', 'competition', 'held', 'Tuva', 'capital', 'Kyzyl', 'Mr.', 'Pena', 'was', 'invited', 'compete', 'contest', 'held', 'there', 'year', '1998', 'film', 'Paul', 'Pena', 'new', 'friends', 'journey', 'remote', 'land', 'mostly', 'untouched', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'resulting', 'documentary', 'story', 'hardship', 'foreign', 'travel', 'rewards', 'cultural', 'exchange', 'shared', 'love', 'music', 'creative', 'pursuit', 'film', 'often', 'experiencing', 'atypical', 'realities', 'closing', 'performance', 'blues', 'standard', 'Got', 'ta', 'Move', 'can', 'also', 'hear', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'Paul', 'Pena', 'native', 'tongue', 'Genghis', 'Blues', 'film', 'who', 'strive', 'maintain', 'enthusiasm', 'relating', 'new', 'people', 'hearing', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'becoming', 'involved', 'unique', 'modes', 'shamanic', 'cultural', 'expression']",N/A

This is a powerful story told in the spirit of Richard Feynman's life, which was also spontaneous and full of meaning.  The tuvan throat singing is simply amazing; I still have no idea how they do it.  Paul's live performance in the concert is astounding, especially because he winged the whole thing!  If you don't appreciate something this good, I don't know what to say.
