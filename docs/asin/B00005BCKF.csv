Look, those of you who liked the movie, please don't get angry. I know how mad I get when someone lets the air out of a movie I love. But, this movie needs some opposition. I was content to keep my mouth shut... I pinched my lips together when otherwise I would have been up on a soap box petitioning this trash. Ouch, what a flick.BUT! A big but. I love nearly every actor in this movie. They have all managed to find their way's into my top favorite movies. (Ex. Green Mile, Beautiful Mind, City of Angels) Unfortunately though, this movie rubbed me the wrong way. Saying this movie is great is like saying opie doesn't have freckles. (Pardon, Mr. H)Meg Ryan plays a woman who is insecure about her marriage. Why this? Her husband (David Morse (Hearts in Atlantis) - a.k.a. awesome actor in everything he does) is a captured dam builder. The Latino army sees his dam operation as a nuisance. Russell Crowe (a.k.a. cool as peanut butter in everything he does) hop's on the scene to woo the unfortunate. That's about it. Some decent action is the only thing that makes this worth your time.

The film was supposed to tell the story of Crowe falling into a deep affair with Ryan's character after her husband (Morse) is kidnapped. But due to test audiences hating the chemistry and idea of an affair between the Crowe and Ryan characters it was edited out! And the film seems half made, they had two options to redeem themselves; focus the action on Morse and Crowe's characters, as Crowe's character tries to rescue him, which would have made a truly great conflict film or focus on the affair and turn the film into a story of moral inbalance between Ryan's character wanting lust or the loyality she should feel for her husband and the abscence of a structured relationship. But instead we get odd dialogue and weird glares between Crowe and Ryan which feels only half complete.

580825,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005BCKF,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Do people ever just watch movies anymore?  I mean, really, can anyone say that they judge a film strictly on its artistic merit and not on the trash the media is feeding us on the films stars?  I personally try to cast aside my personal feelings for an actor, director or film subject in order to give an honest opinion of a film, but sadly it seems that many people will jump at the chance to hate something because of the personal lives of the stars.  I remember when Eddie Murphy was up for Oscar in 2006 and many critics were saying he didn't deserve to win because of his off-screen antics.  Seriously, what does his personal life have to do with his performance?  Same with Crowe in 2001, or Polanski in 2002, or, take for instance Amy Winehouse's gigantic sweep of the Grammy's last year and the uproar that caused.She makes good music, end of story.So, that brings me to the bad press that this film received, and the reason I feel so strongly is because `Proof of Life', while not perfect, is far better than one would expect.  Yes, critics, fans and movie goers all but destroyed this film with cluttered bad reviews all because of their personal feelings towards the off-screen romance that blossomed between Russell Crowe and the then married Meg Ryan.  I'll say it; it is wrong to cheat on your spouse.That said, celebrities do it all the time, so why should I really care?I'm not handing them awards for Miss America or electing them into political office (although they may be better fit), I'm grading their film, and their film was actually pretty decent.  Why should I allow my feelings towards their bedside manner impress my feelings towards their work?`Proof of Life' tells the story of Alice Bowman who finds out that her husband has been kidnapped by rebels in the fictional Latin American country of Tecala.  In her delicate state she finds herself being taken advantage of, and she would continue to be if it weren't for negotiator Terry Thorne who swoops in to save the day.  Thus sums up the film you are about to experience.Sure, the film is not perfect, and it really could have used some tightening up (I really feel that Taylor Hackford has an issue with tightening up his films) but in the end there is not a whole lot to hate about this film.  Sure, parts seem very improbable, and the implied romance between Terry and Alice can leave the audience frustrated (I would have much rather had their romance be more explicit in the sense that it is explored, for it may have brought some closure to the ending) but the action scenes are well filmed and the acting is well done and the script, overall, is nicely constructed.  It makes sense, even if it isn't totally believable (I know you know what I mean).  David Caruso and David Morse do wonderful supporting work, but the film is all about Ryan and Crowe.  I adore Meg Ryan, and she nails her performance, manipulating her emotions to show us an unhappy woman in love with a man who cannot satisfy her; and Crowe, while not at the top of his game, is still effortlessly captivating.Truth be told; Crowe at his worst is better than many at their best.So, in the end I must urge you to disregard your preconceived notions, and everyone else's for that matter, and just see this movie.  It is exciting, engaging and rewarding.  It may not be award worthy, but as far as these types of genre films go it is just about top notch, and without doubt far better than many would have you believe.",4,Unfairly maligned due to an off-screen romance...,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,3470,"['Do', 'people', 'ever', 'just', 'watch', 'movies', 'anymore', 'mean', 'really', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'judge', 'film', 'strictly', 'artistic', 'merit', 'not', 'trash', 'media', 'feeding', 'films', 'stars', 'personally', 'try', 'cast', 'aside', 'personal', 'feelings', 'actor', 'director', 'film', 'subject', 'order', 'give', 'honest', 'opinion', 'film', 'sadly', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'jump', 'chance', 'hate', 'something', 'personal', 'lives', 'stars', 'remember', 'when', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'up', 'Oscar', '2006', 'many', 'critics', 'were', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'win', 'off-screen', 'antics', 'Seriously', 'what', 'personal', 'life', 'have', 'do', 'performance', 'Same', 'Crowe', '2001', 'Polanski', '2002', 'take', 'instance', 'Amy', 'Winehouse', 'gigantic', 'sweep', 'Grammy', 'last', 'year', 'uproar', 'caused.She', 'good', 'music', 'end', 'story.So', 'bad', 'press', 'film', 'received', 'reason', 'feel', 'so', 'strongly', 'Proof', 'Life', 'not', 'perfect', 'far', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Yes', 'critics', 'fans', 'movie', 'goers', 'destroyed', 'film', 'cluttered', 'bad', 'reviews', 'personal', 'feelings', 'off-screen', 'romance', 'blossomed', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'then', 'married', 'Meg', 'Ryan', ""'ll"", 'say', 'wrong', 'cheat', 'spouse.That', 'said', 'celebrities', 'do', 'time', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'really', 'care', ""'m"", 'not', 'handing', 'awards', 'Miss', 'America', 'electing', 'political', 'office', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'fit', ""'m"", 'grading', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Why', 'should', 'allow', 'feelings', 'towards', 'bedside', 'manner', 'impress', 'feelings', 'towards', 'work', 'Proof', 'Life', 'story', 'Alice', 'Bowman', 'who', 'out', 'husband', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'rebels', 'fictional', 'Latin', 'American', 'country', 'Tecala', 'delicate', 'state', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'would', 'continue', 'be', 'were', ""n't"", 'negotiator', 'Terry', 'Thorne', 'who', 'save', 'day', 'Thus', 'up', 'film', 'are', 'experience.Sure', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'tightening', 'up', 'really', 'feel', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'issue', 'tightening', 'up', 'films', 'end', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'hate', 'film', 'Sure', 'parts', 'seem', 'very', 'improbable', 'implied', 'romance', 'Terry', 'Alice', 'can', 'leave', 'audience', 'frustrated', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'had', 'romance', 'be', 'more', 'explicit', 'sense', 'explored', 'may', 'have', 'brought', 'closure', 'ending', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'filmed', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'script', 'overall', 'nicely', 'constructed', 'sense', 'even', ""n't"", 'totally', 'believable', 'know', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'David', 'Caruso', 'David', 'Morse', 'do', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'work', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Crowe', 'adore', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'performance', 'manipulating', 'emotions', 'show', 'unhappy', 'woman', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'satisfy', 'Crowe', 'not', 'top', 'game', 'still', 'effortlessly', 'captivating.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Crowe', 'worst', 'better', 'many', 'best.So', 'end', 'must', 'urge', 'disregard', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'everyone', 'else', 'matter', 'just', 'see', 'movie', 'exciting', 'engaging', 'rewarding', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'award', 'worthy', 'as', 'far', 'types', 'genre', 'films', 'go', 'just', 'about', 'top', 'notch', 'doubt', 'far', 'better', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'believe']",Proof of Life

Russell looked tired, and we didn't get to see him in action (and see the arms) until the end of the film.  By that time, I was really tired of watching Meg Ryan display her extensive wardrobe and demonstrate how appealing she looks when she cries.  She was sad because her husband was kidnapped-I got it- and she was feeling guilty because she was attracted to Russell Crowe's Terry Thorne.  The storyline involving the romance between those two was thoroughly telegraphed by the public romance, and I have to agree with the director that it hindered efforts to advertise the movie. In fact, the bad publicity aimed at Crowe almost cost him the Academy Award that he so richly deserved for Gladiator.  I can see why he was drawn to this character- he excels at playing tough guys with a heart of gold.  But we couldn't root for him in this film because we knew from the start that he was not going to end up with Meg.The script-at least as much of it as appeared on the screen- was weak.  The motivation of Thorne to take on Meg Ryan as a client for no charge could have been explained better.  It appeared that his company wanted to promote him out of operations, and he was not ready to leave the field operations to others.  That makes more sense then some sappy instant attraction between this hardened veteran and the hippie queen.The ending was thoroughly disappointing.  There is a fake-out about Thorne being blinded, then we see the restrained good-bye between Thorne and Meg's character, and then we see the genuine side of Thorne's character:  the male bonding at the end.  The best chemistry in the movie was between David Caruso and Russell Crowe.  As the credits rolled, I thought to myself:  Russell, you are our newest sex symbol, and you've made another movie where you don't get the girl.  And now he's making a film about a schizophrenic mathematician.

I've got news for him: what ruined this film is that it is not very well done and he can squarely lay that at his own door.  However, you can really tell how good some actors are when you see them in a mediocre movie and they  nevertheless manage to stand out and shine.  There is such an actor in this movie and it is Russell Crowe.  He is the hostage negotiator with kidnappers around the world for getting back the victims in exchange for a ransom.  Typically, insurance taken out my major corporations covers both his fee and the ransom.  He is very convincing in this role and you learn something about how such a person has to operate to get the job done.  The rest of the movie just plods along though.  Meg Ryan mainly cries and gets upset over her husband's loss.  She's had better roles.  This may have been her swan song...[T]hey are both forced to act noble throughout since her husband has been kidnapped.  This movie may have been a heck of a lot better if they had been allowed to act with a lot less nobility in the movie instead. Put them in an affair while the husband is being held hostage and I, for one, would have been more glued to the screen.",3,Russell Crowe Is Best Part of Ho-Hum Movie,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,1317,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'Crowe', 'Ryan', 'real', 'life', 'romance', 'ruining', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'ve"", 'got', 'news', 'what', 'ruined', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'squarely', 'lay', 'own', 'door', 'However', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'how', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'when', 'see', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'nevertheless', 'manage', 'stand', 'out', 'shine', 'such', 'actor', 'movie', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'kidnappers', 'world', 'getting', 'back', 'victims', 'exchange', 'ransom', 'Typically', 'insurance', 'taken', 'out', 'major', 'corporations', 'fee', 'ransom', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'learn', 'something', 'how', 'such', 'person', 'operate', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'plods', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'mainly', 'cries', 'upset', 'husband', 'loss', 'had', 'better', 'roles', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'swan', 'song', '[', 'T', ']', 'hey', 'are', 'forced', 'act', 'noble', 'husband', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'act', 'lot', 'less', 'nobility', 'movie', 'instead', 'Put', 'affair', 'husband', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'glued', 'screen']",Proof of Life

Ebeling ""ctlpareader""","[6, 8]","Decades ago, my mother used to say we should never know anything about a performer's personal life or opinions because that gets in the way of clear-eyed enjoyment or assessment of his or her work.  When it comes to PROOF OF LIFE, that is notoriously the case.  This movie deserves better than it got.  It easily makes a place in that wide-open space in our culture for generally well-made entertainment that isn't gunning for awards.Inspired by actual circumstances, the story cuts back and forth between an American executive kidnapped in a South American country by a guerilla band hoping to ransom him for high stakes insurance dollars and the rescue efforts engaged by the man's wife and sister.  The pacing is appropriately tense and sprite, and there are some embellishments and complications, not really whole subplots, that keep it varied and interesting.  The rules of hostage holding and negotiation are not what one unfamiliar with such activity would expect.  This action unfolds across a few months' time, and the filmmaker maintains suspense until the last.The dialogue is decent, the characters almost all filled out by strong direction and acting.  Russell Crowe brings his usual level of commitment to his role as the leader of the rescue effort.  David Caruso is fine as his back-up, and he has the most memorable line in the film.  David Morse, as the role of the kidnapped executive requires, turns in a performance as weighty as Crowe's. Pamela Reed is enjoyably original as the abrasive sister-in-law, sort of a snapping terrier backing up Meg Ryan's vulnerable wife. I hated to see her character leave in the middle, though it made plot sense. Much criticism has been leveled at Ryan and I think the problem is that her role as written and directed is more ing&eacute;nue-ish and thus, played off the more character-driven parts, it pales.  Some of her comedic tics come through in a few spots, which the director should have corrected--the wave of the hand, the wag of the head, the loose gait.  That said, she's not terrible and I can't think of anyone else at the moment who could have done much better with the material handed her.This is an intelligent action film.  There is violence appropriate to the story line but the filmmaker does not indulge in gratuitous blood baths.  Nor does he use nudity or profanity to replace visual interest or strong dialogue.  No cop-outs here.  The DVD is not overloaded with many features, and that's okay.

Russell Crowe gets the blood pumping every time, and &#34;Proof of Life&#34; was definitely a heart-pounder for me, not only because RC was in it, but also because it was an edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckle adventure that was made absolutely believable by RC, Meg Ryan, David Morse and even David Caruso. There was quite a bit of 'sexual tension' involved here between the lead characters, Terry Thorne (RC) and Alice Bowman (MR) which keeps one wondering if they'll forget about Alice's hubby, Peter Bowman (DM), and just run off together.The story is set mostly in the Andes Mountains which are absolutely stunning in their stark, unforgiving beauty, and quite a challenge to Terry and his crew when the go to rescue Peter and the rest of the captives being held there. I'll not go into the storyline to any extent here, as you can read that for yourself here on IMBD. What I will attest to is that this film is definitely worth watching and will not fail to please those of you who enjoy a good adventure laced with sexually charged scenes which never culminate in actually engaging in the act. The dialogue between Terry, Alice, and Dino (David Caruso) is engaging, fraught with innuendo and with sinister undertones regarding the actual rescue of poor hubby Peter. I particularly enjoyed the fact that RC was allowed to use his natural Aussie accent in this one. Gotta love them Aussies!! And, let us not forget the 'supporting cast'; a small group of tough-assed ex-military men with whom Terry and Dino had worked before, and who are definitely up to the task at hand.One of the best movies I've seen in quite some time!

It still baffles me that 'Dukes of Hazzard' can overtake 'Cinderella Man' in the box office, all because Russell Crowe has a temper.  WHO CARES!!!  Cinderella Man was and is a far better movie.  Now this brings me to 'Proof of Life' which failed in the box office mostly due to the offscreen affair between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.  Now rumers circulated that it was Russell Crowe who ended the marriage of Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, although Ryan claims that their marriage was already on shakey grounds.  Again, WHO CARES!!!  This movie is still a great movie, a great plot and some equally impressive acting.  WHile not Crowes best performance he still puts his heart and soul into Terry, a H&R negotiator (Kidnap and Ransom)...anyways...the story is like this.  Alice (Ryan) and Peter have a rocky marriage.  They are at ends with each other because Peter is to involved in his work that he neglects his wife.  he's never around and when he is he's always preoccupied with getting his dam built.  That is all until he is kidnapped and held ransom by a group of terrorists in South America.  That is where Terry comes into play.  He is sent to help negotiate Peters safe return.  There are a few plot twists and it ends up that Terry is doing this mission seperate from his company (kinda probono).  The movie realy revolves around the emotions of the charactors.  You know, I feel it's unfair to feel that Meg Ryans charactor is unsympatetic because of the assumed affair between Alice and Terry.  As the beginning of the film helped us see, her husband didn't pay any attention to her, and that is one of the main reasons that women leave their husbands in the first place, not because they don't love their husbands but because they don't feel their husbands love them and find that love in the eyes of a strager who gives them attention.  Like Terry did, just by asking the name of her dead daughter, like she says ""no ones ever asked me that before"".  I thought that this movie was very well done, and is worth a watch even if you aren't pleased with the off screen lives of the actors, it doesn't change the fact that they deliver above par on screen.  The only, and I mean only, reason that I did not give this movie 5 stars is the fact that it is all to common to rate a movie R for no apparent reason.  This movie has very little violence and NO sex (although a sex scene between Crowe and Ryan would have been welcome) and the only reason for an R rating is the unnessisary F-Word use...if only these words were ommited then my children could watch this great film!",4,A very under-rated film!,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2675,"['hate', 'when', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'due', 'off', 'screen', 'antics', 'versus', 'actually', 'sucking', 'still', ""'Dukes"", 'Hazzard', 'can', 'overtake', ""'Cinderella"", 'Man', 'box', 'office', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'temper', 'WHO', 'CARES', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'Now', ""'Proof"", 'Life', 'failed', 'box', 'office', 'mostly', 'due', 'offscreen', 'affair', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Now', 'circulated', 'was', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'ended', 'marriage', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Ryan', 'claims', 'marriage', 'was', 'already', 'shakey', 'grounds', 'Again', 'WHO', 'CARES', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'plot', 'equally', 'impressive', 'acting', 'not', 'Crowes', 'best', 'performance', 'still', 'heart', 'soul', 'Terry', 'H', 'R', 'negotiator', 'Kidnap', 'Ransom', 'anyways', 'story', 'Alice', 'Ryan', 'Peter', 'have', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'are', 'ends', 'other', 'Peter', 'involved', 'work', 'wife', 'never', 'around', 'when', 'always', 'preoccupied', 'getting', 'dam', 'built', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'ransom', 'group', 'terrorists', 'South', 'America', 'where', 'Terry', 'play', 'sent', 'help', 'negotiate', 'Peters', 'safe', 'return', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'up', 'Terry', 'doing', 'mission', 'seperate', 'company', 'kinda', 'probono', 'movie', 'realy', 'emotions', 'charactors', 'know', 'feel', 'unfair', 'feel', 'Meg', 'Ryans', 'charactor', 'unsympatetic', 'assumed', 'affair', 'Alice', 'Terry', 'beginning', 'film', 'helped', 'see', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'women', 'leave', 'husbands', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'husbands', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'husbands', 'love', 'find', 'love', 'eyes', 'strager', 'who', 'attention', 'Terry', 'did', 'just', 'asking', 'name', 'dead', 'daughter', 'ones', 'ever', 'asked', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'worth', 'watch', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'off', 'screen', 'lives', 'actors', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'deliver', 'par', 'screen', 'only', 'mean', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'fact', 'common', 'rate', 'movie', 'R', 'apparent', 'reason', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'NO', 'sex', 'sex', 'scene', 'Crowe', 'Ryan', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'only', 'reason', 'R', 'rating', 'unnessisary', 'F-Word', 'use', 'only', 'words', 'were', 'ommited', 'then', 'children', 'could', 'watch', 'great', 'film']",Proof of Life

His very presence virtually guarantees a film worth seeing.  Nevertheless, &quot;Proof of Life&quot; was definitely  not a box office winner.  It may even have lost money.  Why did this happen?  After all, &quot;Proof of Life&quot; was released later in the same year as the fabulously  successful ""Gladiator"" and also co-starred a number of notable actors like Meg Ryan, David Morse, and David Caruso.  How much blame should be directed at  screen writer Tony Gilroy who insulted the audiences intelligence with the infantile character portrayed by Meg Ryan?Crowe's 1999 film ""The Insider"" focussed solely upon the immorality of the companies marketing tobacco products.  The movie was fair and balanced, and  definitely not a per se attack upon our capitalist economy.  This, however, is regretfully not what occurred in ""Proof of Life."" The wife of the kidnapped victim is  depicted as an pampered former hippie who embraces an immature and unsophisticated grasp of economic reality.  She utterly fails to comprehend how the expansion  of capitalist investment is mandatory if poverty is ever to be eradicated in the Third World.  Throughout the film we had to endure the wife's mindless comments on  matters she knew little about.  I personally got to the point where I cringed every time Meg Ryan came onto the screen.  The very premise of &quot;Proof of Life&quot; seems to  imply that oil companies are innately evil.  This supposed fact is so self explanatory that nothing further needs to be added.  Tony Gilroy apparently believes that  politically correct hitting below the belt extremist Liberalism is the appropriate way to create a film script.  That movie goers stayed away in droves should give Gilroy  and the producers of ""Proof of Life"" something to think about.Why didn't David Morse receive an supporting actor's Academy Award nomination for his splendid performance of the kidnapped husband?  It irritates me to no end  to see great work ignored likely because the film failed to attract long lines at the box office.  Meg Ryan did the best she could considering the awful lines provided to  her by Gilroy.  David Curuso filled in admirably as Thorne's (Crowe) mercenary comrade.  Why is Curuso unable to make the leap as a leading man?  I can't put my  finger on it, but so far Caruso does much better as a supporting actor.  The subject matter of hostage taking is also very timely.  This is a growing crisis in every area  of our planet.  It is a relatively easy way for criminals and political ideologues to acquire substantial funds.  &quot;Proof of Life&quot; does a fine job in revealing the mindset of  these despicable groups.  I have no problem recommending this movie.  One must merely grit their teeth whenever the Alice Bowman character makes an appearance.  This film is unfortunately doomed to be seen only by the true fans of Russell Crowe.  It deserves far more adulation and respect, but the damage resulting from Tony  Gilroy's ultra left-wing script is too overwhelming.  Is &quot;Proof of Life&quot; a five star movie?  No, but it still earns four stars because of the acting greatness of both Russell  Crowe and David Morse.",4,Screenwriter Tony Gilroy Insulted Audience's Intelligence,987811200,"04 21, 2001",2001,3231,"['Russell', 'Crowe', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'era', 'very', 'presence', 'virtually', 'film', 'seeing', 'Nevertheless', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'winner', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'lost', 'money', 'Why', 'did', 'happen', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'was', 'released', 'later', 'same', 'year', 'fabulously', 'successful', 'Gladiator', 'also', 'co-starred', 'number', 'notable', 'actors', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'David', 'Morse', 'David', 'Caruso', 'How', 'much', 'blame', 'should', 'be', 'directed', 'screen', 'writer', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'who', 'insulted', 'audiences', 'intelligence', 'infantile', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Crowe', '1999', 'film', 'Insider', 'focussed', 'solely', 'immorality', 'companies', 'marketing', 'tobacco', 'products', 'movie', 'was', 'fair', 'balanced', 'definitely', 'not', 'per', 'se', 'attack', 'capitalist', 'economy', 'however', 'regretfully', 'not', 'what', 'occurred', 'Proof', 'Life', 'wife', 'kidnapped', 'victim', 'depicted', 'pampered', 'former', 'hippie', 'who', 'immature', 'unsophisticated', 'grasp', 'economic', 'reality', 'utterly', 'comprehend', 'how', 'expansion', 'capitalist', 'investment', 'mandatory', 'poverty', 'ever', 'be', 'eradicated', 'Third', 'World', 'film', 'had', 'endure', 'wife', 'mindless', 'comments', 'matters', 'knew', 'little', 'personally', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'cringed', 'time', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'came', 'screen', 'very', 'premise', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'imply', 'oil', 'companies', 'are', 'innately', 'evil', 'supposed', 'fact', 'so', 'self', 'explanatory', 'nothing', 'further', 'be', 'added', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'apparently', 'politically', 'correct', 'hitting', 'belt', 'extremist', 'Liberalism', 'appropriate', 'way', 'create', 'film', 'script', 'movie', 'goers', 'stayed', 'away', 'droves', 'should', 'give', 'Gilroy', 'producers', 'Proof', 'Life', 'something', 'think', 'about.Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'David', 'Morse', 'receive', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'splendid', 'performance', 'kidnapped', 'husband', 'end', 'see', 'great', 'work', 'ignored', 'likely', 'film', 'failed', 'attract', 'long', 'lines', 'box', 'office', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'considering', 'awful', 'lines', 'provided', 'Gilroy', 'David', 'Curuso', 'filled', 'admirably', 'Thorne', 'Crowe', 'mercenary', 'comrade', 'Why', 'Curuso', 'unable', 'make', 'leap', 'leading', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'so', 'far', 'Caruso', 'much', 'better', 'supporting', 'actor', 'subject', 'matter', 'hostage', 'taking', 'also', 'very', 'timely', 'growing', 'crisis', 'area', 'planet', 'relatively', 'easy', 'way', 'criminals', 'political', 'ideologues', 'acquire', 'substantial', 'funds', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'fine', 'job', 'revealing', 'mindset', 'despicable', 'groups', 'have', 'problem', 'recommending', 'movie', 'One', 'must', 'merely', 'grit', 'teeth', 'Alice', 'Bowman', 'character', 'appearance', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'doomed', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'true', 'fans', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'far', 'more', 'adulation', 'respect', 'damage', 'resulting', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'ultra', 'left-wing', 'script', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'Is', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'No', 'still', 'four', 'stars', 'acting', 'greatness', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'David', 'Morse']",Proof of Life
580839,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005BCKF,Deborah Earle,"[4, 4]","I'll be tactful enough to refrain from discussing the real-life drama surrounding Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe that began on the set of this movie, as there has been more than enough said. The storyline and acting were believable, the scenes of Ecuador lush and beautiful, and the sexual tension between Ryan's frail-looking but steely Alice Bowman and Crowe's cool-as-a-cucumber Terry Thorne is the engine that makes this story run.The story centers on the kidnapping of Alice's engineer husband Peter in the fictional country of Tecala, and on Thorne's attempts to retrieve him. It is a journey that an audience  can feel they have taken along with those involved, and it makes us wonder how we'd fare in similar circumstances.As the victim, David Morse is frightened and cautious, but doesn't always refrain from expressing hostility towards his captors. Helped by a crazed missionary, he proved to be plucky and rescourceful.David Caruso's Dino is  the comic relief of the movie but smooth as cream when assisting Terry.Pamela Reed is  Peter's anxious sister who comes to Tecala to lend support to her sister-in-law. Interestingly, she and Peter didn't get along, but we see the strenghth of family ties in a moment of crisis from watching her.Sarahi Echverria's Cinta is the emotionally fragile housekeeper who is instrumental in identifying the  the mastermind behind the kidnapping.The casual chatter between Terry and Alice is a pleasant and poignant diversion. Crowe displays a certain strength when consoling women and a certain pensive charm when listening to Alice's story of a personal loss. When Caruso mentions a comical incident involving Terry, Crowe momentarily lights up with laughter, flashing pearl-like teeth from a delicately crafted mouth, almost lighting up the room a bit more brightly than the candles being used to combat a power failure. Ryan's amusement at that moment has a frail majesty to it.Apparently, at some point in a Crowe flick, there is usually an obligatory display of his powerful looking arms that are as thick as tree trunks. Scenes of him in his black tank top were/are used to hawk this movie, of course, and they were brief, but very effective.We follow the movie to its poignant and slightly humourous conclusion, during which Thorne once more proves to be an astute miltary man, and Bowman gets to take a shot at his tormentors.Ultimately, Thorne proves to be an honorable man as well, renouncing Alice once he completes his task.I have to wonder about the accuracy of this movie as far as the kidnap and ransom trade is concerned.

580842,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005BCKF,D. Litton,"[21, 28]","Just when it seems like the action genre off moviemaking is about to be played, another movie comes out with a ridiculous plot, over-the-top characters who are unfamiliar with the situation, and suspenseful action sequences, some of which have nothing to do with the story at hand. &quot;Proof of Life,&quot; starring Russell Crowe, Meg Ryan, and David Morse, jumps over all of these hurdles and manages to come out 90% unblemished. The story is unique and somewhat original, the characters are involving and intelligent, and there are no unneeded setpieces that clog up most other thrillers.In the (fictional) country of Tecala, located in Latin America, Alice and Peter Bowman live out their lives. Peter heads up the construction of a dam to stop the flooding of small towns; she is just basically his wife throughout the movie, never really having a job or doing anything except shopping at the local outdoor market for fresh food. On his way to work one day, Peter takes a shortcut on a low mountain road, which is blocked off by a traffic jam. Soon, masked men with machine guns start jumping out of the woods, and everyone is taken from their vehicles and put into covered trucks, transported to an unknown stronghold in the mountains. Their motive: the dam project was taken over by another company in order to build a running oil pipeline through the superstructure, therefore pissing off the rebels, who now hold these people in return for some heavy-duty money.Alice, learning of the kidnapping, employs the services of Terry Thorne, a former soldier who is now a kidnap-and-ranson negotiator for a firm that collects commissions for successful rescues. At first, he is hesitant to take the project, but later returns to it out of the goodness of his heart, despite his son that he has not spent any time with in months. He begins making contact with the kidnappers, bartering over the price that he must pay in order to receive a &quot;proof of life,&quot; or solid confirmation that Peter is still alive. Soon, the show starts hitting too close to hom, and he realizes the only way he is going to rescue the man, and put to rest his yearning for Alice, is to find Peter and bring him back alive.The movie proves that it fits into the suspense/thriller genre, even if it does fall a little short on its action sequences. Bowman's kidnapping and constant transfers across the mountains keep the tension building, and when he starts to yell and demand things of his captors, there is an incredible degree of intensity where the roles of preditor and prey are switched. This will prove to be one of the most thrilling moments of the movie; after that, the suspense does drop a few degrees to allow for the development of each character's attitude and emotion.Another good aspect of the film is the minute yet unignorable spark of interest between Alice and Terry. Alice does not think anything more of him than the fact that he is the man who is helping her get her husband back. Terry, however, begins to develop feelings for her through the remorse he feels over her situation, and there are moments where you can see it in him that he just wishes to reach out and console her. This is where screenwriter Tony Gilroy and director Taylor Hackford are able to play on Alice's emotions; we know that she is moved by his feelings once they are revealed in the film, and whether or not she will do anything about them lets down on the emotion we feel for her, shifting that focus onto her captive husband.The actors cast for this film all have a wonderful chemistry whne onscreen, whether it be romantic or moving. Russell Crowe is the perfect choice for agent Thorne. He is able to play out each move of his character, and each line of dialogue, with an elevated level of authenticity and believability. Meg Ryan, as usual, sparkles in her role of Alice Bowman, shifting from the supportive wife to the emotional would-be widow. In this kind of movie, you would expect Alice to become disheartened and overly emotional in the crucial moments of the film. Instead, the film gives Ryan a chance to play her character as powerful and with an emotion that reaches over sadness for strength and determination. It is David Morse, who plays Peter Bowman, that is the truly impacting character of the entire story. His performances, especially in the scene of conflict with his captor, make him the character to pull for in the end. By the time the action truly sets in, all you will want is to see him make it out alive and reunite with his wife, whom he truly loves.While the suspense does tend to fall out in certain moments, it does not ruin the overall impact &quot;Proof of Life&quot; has to offer its viewers. Everything falls into place at the right time: the action, the budding yet doomed &quot;romance&quot; between Thorne and Alice, and the struggle of a man to simply make it in one of the most extreme situations imagineable. A very nice action thriller for fans of the stars involved and those looking for intensity and excitement.",4,"More intense than you'd think, with credible performances.",979862400,"01 19, 2001",2001,5045,"['Just', 'when', 'action', 'genre', 'off', 'moviemaking', 'be', 'played', 'movie', 'out', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'situation', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'hand', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'starring', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'David', 'Morse', 'hurdles', 'manages', 'come', 'out', '90', '%', 'unblemished', 'story', 'unique', 'somewhat', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'involving', 'intelligent', 'are', 'unneeded', 'setpieces', 'clog', 'up', 'most', 'other', 'thrillers.In', 'fictional', 'country', 'Tecala', 'located', 'Latin', 'America', 'Alice', 'Peter', 'Bowman', 'live', 'out', 'lives', 'Peter', 'up', 'construction', 'dam', 'stop', 'flooding', 'small', 'towns', 'just', 'basically', 'wife', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'having', 'job', 'doing', 'anything', 'shopping', 'local', 'outdoor', 'market', 'fresh', 'food', 'way', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'Peter', 'shortcut', 'low', 'mountain', 'road', 'blocked', 'off', 'traffic', 'jam', 'Soon', 'masked', 'men', 'machine', 'guns', 'start', 'jumping', 'woods', 'everyone', 'taken', 'vehicles', 'put', 'covered', 'trucks', 'transported', 'unknown', 'stronghold', 'mountains', 'motive', 'dam', 'project', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'company', 'order', 'build', 'running', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'superstructure', 'therefore', 'pissing', 'off', 'rebels', 'who', 'now', 'hold', 'people', 'return', 'heavy-duty', 'money.Alice', 'learning', 'kidnapping', 'services', 'Terry', 'Thorne', 'former', 'soldier', 'who', 'now', 'kidnap-and-ranson', 'negotiator', 'firm', 'commissions', 'successful', 'rescues', 'first', 'hesitant', 'take', 'project', 'later', 'returns', 'goodness', 'heart', 'son', 'not', 'spent', 'time', 'months', 'making', 'contact', 'kidnappers', 'bartering', 'price', 'must', 'pay', 'order', 'receive', 'quot', 'proof', 'life', 'quot', 'solid', 'confirmation', 'Peter', 'still', 'alive', 'Soon', 'show', 'hitting', 'too', 'close', 'hom', 'only', 'way', 'going', 'rescue', 'man', 'put', 'rest', 'yearning', 'Alice', 'find', 'Peter', 'bring', 'back', 'alive.The', 'movie', 'suspense/thriller', 'genre', 'even', 'fall', 'little', 'short', 'action', 'sequences', 'Bowman', 'kidnapping', 'constant', 'transfers', 'mountains', 'keep', 'tension', 'building', 'when', 'yell', 'demand', 'things', 'captors', 'incredible', 'degree', 'intensity', 'where', 'roles', 'preditor', 'prey', 'are', 'switched', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'movie', 'suspense', 'drop', 'few', 'degrees', 'allow', 'development', 'character', 'attitude', 'emotion.Another', 'good', 'aspect', 'film', 'minute', 'yet', 'unignorable', 'spark', 'interest', 'Alice', 'Terry', 'Alice', 'not', 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'fact', 'man', 'who', 'helping', 'get', 'husband', 'back', 'Terry', 'however', 'develop', 'feelings', 'remorse', 'situation', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'reach', 'out', 'console', 'where', 'screenwriter', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'are', 'able', 'play', 'Alice', 'emotions', 'know', 'moved', 'feelings', 'are', 'revealed', 'film', 'not', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'down', 'emotion', 'feel', 'shifting', 'focus', 'captive', 'husband.The', 'actors', 'cast', 'film', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'whne', 'onscreen', 'be', 'romantic', 'moving', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'perfect', 'choice', 'agent', 'Thorne', 'able', 'play', 'out', 'move', 'character', 'line', 'dialogue', 'elevated', 'level', 'authenticity', 'believability', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'usual', 'sparkles', 'role', 'Alice', 'Bowman', 'shifting', 'supportive', 'wife', 'emotional', 'would-be', 'widow', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'expect', 'Alice', 'become', 'disheartened', 'overly', 'emotional', 'crucial', 'moments', 'film', 'Instead', 'film', 'Ryan', 'chance', 'play', 'character', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'over', 'sadness', 'strength', 'determination', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'Peter', 'Bowman', 'truly', 'impacting', 'character', 'entire', 'story', 'performances', 'especially', 'scene', 'conflict', 'captor', 'make', 'character', 'pull', 'end', 'time', 'action', 'truly', 'sets', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'reunite', 'wife', 'whom', 'truly', 'suspense', 'tend', 'fall', 'out', 'certain', 'moments', 'not', 'ruin', 'overall', 'impact', 'quot', 'Proof', 'Life', 'quot', 'offer', 'viewers', 'Everything', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'action', 'budding', 'yet', 'doomed', 'quot', 'romance', 'quot', 'Thorne', 'Alice', 'struggle', 'man', 'simply', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'extreme', 'situations', 'imagineable', 'very', 'nice', 'action', 'thriller', 'fans', 'stars', 'involved', 'looking', 'intensity', 'excitement']",Proof of Life
580843,A1H52G478ZXLFX,B00005BCKF,D. Richardson,"[0, 1]","""Proof of Life"" has most of the ingredients for a psychological thriller/hot action film but it fails miserably in several areas.  Crowe as Terry Thorne plays the part of a Kidnap/Ransom negotiator perfectly but Meg Ryan as Alice Bowman was a poor choice as the female lead; she is not believable in her role. The film is extremely long due to the constant cut aways to her kidnapped husband, Peter. These cutaways give the impression that his kidnappers took him on a trek to Tibet and they add at least 15-18 minutes of running time, bringing the total up to 135 minutes! The sub plot of Terry Thorne falling for Alice during the time he is trying desperately to save her husband's life is so subtle it is almost non existent. Thorne gives one brief indication of his inner (romantic)conflict to Alice in the last 20 minutes of the film. Before this, he has been living in her house for months negotiating the return of her husband. He has been in intimate contact with her every day and yet none of his feelings for her are revealed until that one ten second scene near the end of the film! Not very believable! The husband, Peter Bowman, is played as an unlikable **** from the start of the film so it is very hard to develop empathy for him in his plight. I was actually starting to hope that he WOULD get bumped off by the kidnappers. The ending of the film is disappointing and lacks any feeling of satisfying conclusion to the story but does leave a very obvious clue that there may be sequels!

580844,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00005BCKF,Duane Thomas,"[16, 20]","I've made my living since 1992 testing and evaluating guns, and writing articles for gun magazines. Gun people tend to loath most action movies, since they rarely get the technical details correct. Proof of Life is an exception to that rule.To start with, Proof of Life totally avoids one of my biggest pet peeves about guns in movies, what I call the ""aiming indicator,"" that ka-chack! sound guns make every time they're aimed at anyone. The director and sound people obviously feel this is very dramatic, and says, ""Hey! Someone is actually aiming a gun here!"" In real life, guns don't do that. And they don't in Proof of Life, either.Terry Thorne's (Russell Crowe's) carry gun is a compact 1911 .45 auto (I'm morally certain it's a Kimber Ultra Compact, he said in full gun geek mode), a bit of an unusual choice for an ex-SAS guy. The SAS have traditionally been poster children for the Browning Hi-Power, and then transitioned over to the SIG P226. Granted, Terry's now a civilian so he can carry anything he wants (and at least the 1911 has much same manual of operations as the Hi-Power) but it's not a situation where you instantly look at the gun the character's carrying and say, ""Ah yes, these people got it right."" But hang in there, good stuff is to come.When Terry finds Peter in the base camp, he gives him his 1911 for protection, telling him, ""Okay, here's the safety, up is Safe, down is Fire."" This is totally correct. Later, Peter tries to shoot a terrorist who's threatening Terry but can't make the gun fire. After Terry deals with the bad guy, he walks up to Peter, reaches around to the side of the gun, flicks off the thumb safety, and says, ""Now the safety's off."" Excellent! What a pleasure to see a scene in a Hollywood movie revolve around a decent knowledge of a gun's technical features.Later, Peter actually uses Terry's 1911 to save both their lives. He can do this because Terry's placed the gun off-Safe. We have sound effects for eight shots. Again, this is correct. This sort of gun does hold eight rounds. The only small goofs here I might point out are that we hear the sound of the eighth shot while the camera angle shows Peter from behind, and the gun's slide is already locked to the rear; obviously the piece is empty. This is a problem. Then a moment later, we transition to a face-on shot to see Peter's expression - and now the slide is forward. A little sloppy, but still small stuff compared to the overall excellence of the scene.In the firefight at the base camp, even one of the good guy team, with a far higher level of training than the bad guys, begins firing his assault rifle full auto. By contrast, Terry, ex-SAS, and Dino (David Caruso in fine form), ex-Delta Force, maintain fire discipline and fire their M4s in one- and two-shot bursts. In his director's commentary, Taylor Hackford mentions that Russell Crowe is very weapons knowledgeable, and had definite opinions on how he should handle his M4 in these scenes. It shows.Though not gun-related, allow me to mention one other small thing I truly enjoyed. There are two moments in the base camp firefight scene where we see people killed with knives. One of Dino's mercenaries has to use a knife on a guy, and his weapon is what we'd expect from Hollywood, a big, macho, serrated blade fighting knife. By contrast, watch Terry (Russell) do the same thing, notice what he uses: the knife blade from a Leatherman Tool. Low-key, no-BS, effective. What do you want to bet that little detail came from Russell Crowe, as well?

Unfortunately the film is hamstrung by a weak screenplay, vapid dialogue and mediocre performances by the some of the cast.Director Taylor Hackford (""Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Devil's Advocate"") has difficulty keeping the story interesting despite some great locations and photography, and other than Crowe and Caruso, he is unable to get the cast revved.  We are not given enough reason to care about Peter Bowman's (David Morse) rescue for two reasons: Bowman is not a particularly attractive character and Alice Bowman (Meg Ryan) seems clearly ambivalent about her husband.  This leaves the viewer with the hope that Bowman gets snuffed by the terrorists so Terry (Russell Crowe) can run off with Alice.  Of course, that would leave Crowe without a search and rescue mission and there isn't much point having him in the film without the commando scenes.  So the story just limps along without much verve, toward an ending that is predestined to be unfulfilling due to the screenplay's flawed design.Hackford is successful at creating some very effective suspense, but digresses into useless character development of the terrorists (who everyone knows will be bullet magnets by the end of the film).  Many of the scenes with Bowman and the terrorists are laughable.  I couldn't count the times that he provoked them to the point that any reasonable terrorist (how's that for an oxymoron?) would have riddled him with bullets and moved on to another ransom deal.The acting falls into two categories, excellent and mediocre.  In the excellent category we have Crowe and Caruso.  Russell Crowe keeps getting better at playing the tough guy with a heart.  He single handedly keeps this film from imploding under the weight of the ponderous script.  He comes across as smart, tough and sympathetic, which is a tricky combination.  David Caruso delivers the hard as nails character for which he is famous, which is exactly perfect for his role in this film.And then there is Meg Ryan.  Ryan is really out of her element playing a straight dramatic role like this.  She doesn't seem to take her character seriously.  She plays her cavalierly, more like a spoiled brat than a woman buckling under the pressure of a six month hostage ordeal.  It is hard to believe that she actually dated Russell Crowe given the complete lack of chemistry they display on the screen.  Ryan is a fabulous actor in the right role, namely romantic comedy.  She is naturally breezy and lovable, characteristics that impede her from succeeding in more serious roles.  She is miscast here, pure and simple.David Morse gives an uneven performance as Bowman, which is powerful at times and wooden at others.  Morse is good in the tough guy scenes, but falters in scenes that require any depth or range outside that type.  His acting is one dimensional and his character needs more complexity than he is able to deliver.  Pamela Reed is abrasive and obnoxious as Bowman's sister.  Her part is superfluous to begin with and Reed makes the film seem longer every time she has a line.Overall, this film is a disappointment except as a showcase for Crowe, whose stock keeps rising with each new film.  I rated it a 6/10.

There is addedtension between the two because of something that keeps being brought upconcerning their time in Africa.After a particularly nasty fight, Morse's character leaves early one morningand is stopped in a traffic jam.  Suddenly gun shots are heard and menliterally start running down the side of the mountain. People are beingthrown out of their cars and herded hastily across a bridge.

580853,A1FY8NNI6PLI4Z,B00005BCKF,Gunny Mac,"[5, 6]","I don't undersand why this movie was mutilated so badly by the critics...it's not a bad movie!  I'm not saying that it is perfect.  In fact I'm not even saying its great, but it is still more intelligent and interesting than most of the stuff that's out there nowadays.  I'm going to try to explain the levels at which this movie works well and the levels at which it fails.First off, it fails as a love story.  It tries to develop the forbidden love relationship between Crowe and Ryan but falls flat in that regard.  Their feelings for one another are never truly portrayed in depth enough to make an effective love story.  And personally I find it ridiculous that they could have Meg Ryan's character so distressed and preoccupied with saving her beloved husband who is in dire jeopardy while at the same time falling for Russell Crowe.  Can you imagine having the state of mind and desire to cheat on your spouse when he/she is being held hostage by terrorists and you are the only person who can do anything to get him/her back safely?  Its possible I guess, but it seems unlikely.  But this is the only major criticism I have of this movie.  Now, let me tell you why its good!  First of all, it gives a very interesting and accurate portrayal of the turbulent nature of certain areas in the world today.  It gives the viewer a very up close taste of third world terrorism and violence.  What &quot;Traffic&quot; did to portray the North American narcotics trade, &quot;Proof of Life&quot; does for Kidnap &amp; Ransom terrorism.  This is one of those films I think people should see if for nothing else, then as an informative portrayal of some of the uglier aspects of our world as it is today.  It even takes a bit of time to explain that much of the increased corruption and instability is a result of the Cold War ending.  I found these aspects of the film very interesting.  David Morse's desperate situation as the terrorists' hostage is portrayed very well.  Although this film isn't intended as a pure action movie at all, it culminates in a high risk covert rescue mission led in by Russell Crowe once it becomes obvious that all other options to save Morse's life are gone.  And this was definitely my favorite part of the movie!  From a military perspective, the planning, insertion and tactical execution of a covert operation is one of the best, most accurate portrayals I've seen in a modern film.

In my opinion, and I base this on the fact that I am in fact a practicing screenwriter, Proof of Life contains some of the most trite, worthless dialog I've ever seen.  But it is given with such conviction by David Morse and Russell Crowe that they sometimes make it fly.  I myself have written a film based on a magazine article, so I know how hard it can be to complete the amount of research that is needed to pull something like this off, and more research is exactly what was needed to help get this film truly moving.  After a brilliantly staged opening, the film moves off by trying to show how much knowledge Tony Gilroy thinks he has on the K&amp;R subject.  However, it never takes off and ends up being stuck in fourth gear and not shifting into overdrive until the absolutely amazing climax.The action scenes are extremely well done, and this is thanks to Hackford's great eye and not Gilroy's script at all.  By trying to create the tension of a romantic triangle, the film pulls away from the action that it could've had and joins the other &quot;Almost&quot; films that could've been brilliant, but never quite made it.  After seeing a sound byte that called the film &quot;Casablanca with firepower,&quot; I was psyched to see how this was done, but nothing never really meets this expectation.  Whole parts of this film are lifted straight out of Casablanca and you can tell that Gilroy was really trying to prove he was original and smart.  However, the parts that everyone will notice feel cheap and detract from the film.If this had been a straight action film, it could've been really great, but instead it gets stuck in mediocrity in its own pretentiousness.  The performances are very good, especially Crowe and Morse, but the only actor that is truly annoying is Meg Ryan as Alice.  You can tell that the filmmakers were hoping that the off-camera romance between Ryan and Crowe qould help fuel what happens on screen, but it doesn't really matter because the scenes involving the blossoming romance come out of nowhere and feel completely out of place.  If this film had better cohesion and pacing, it could've been a monster of a good film.  Instead, it slips into that &quot;okay&quot; state that crushes so many films of this kind.",3,Better research maybe?

A Kidnap & Rescue negotiator arrives to help, only to discover Peter was a subcontractor and therefore, the company he was contracting for is not responsible for his return (summary: the company's insurance did not cover his safety, therefore will not pay for the expert Kidnap & Rescue negotiator to attempt to save Peter; leaving Alice to hire a negotiator with little to no experience, and try and raise money for the ransom).However, Thorne (K&R; negotiator) leaves Tecala, only to return again, just in time before Alice trusted a huge amount of money to the inexperienced negotiator and lost everything - even her husband.Though it seems unlikely that a romance would blossom out of such a tragedy, the movie carefully shows where feelings begin to take root.  Thorne returned to save Peter out of his strong attraction to Alice.  Alice feels nothing except fear for her husband, but as time goes on and the ups and downs of each phase in the rescue, Alice and Thorne open up a little at a time to each other about all aspects of their lives - until a natural care for each other develops.  With Thorne being basically Alice's ""knight in shining armour,"" and the close friendship they develop together for the next several months... it's only natural that strong emotions and thoughts of love seap into the minds of both Alice and Thorne.  However, though the attraction is great, Alice realizes her true love is Peter and doesn't waver from that fact.  Thorne, realizes too, that his goal of returning Peter will in fact mean he will never have Alice - however, he cannot sacrifice another good person, so he can have his wife.  This will leave you feeling good about being an American for one thing!!

The latter which becomes painfully apparent for the viewer when she is running through a plaza. Watch, you'll know what I mean. Seriously, where were the good actresses when they started calling people about this part? What were they doing?

580871,A42QN9MM6LKKM,B00005BCKF,Lee in S.F.,"[7, 7]","With my Amazon Prime membership, if a movie doesn't grab me soon after opening--bye bye.  Here, the opening segments pulled me into the movie quickly and deeply, due to amazing action sequences that were ""edge of the seat"" gripping.  That initial promise was real, because more of the same was delivered royally for the movie's entirety.  Beautiful scenery and top stars aside, if you like fast-moving plots, interesting and unpredictable characters, and a story line that keeps you guessing, then you'll love this movie!The three lead characters share the load of carrying the film.  Russell Crowe's character is a professional hostage negotiator, who travels the world arranging high-level, often dangerous, extractions.  David Morse's character works as an engineer for humanitarian projects, and that involvement has taken him and his wife (Meg Ryan) to a country called Tecala in the South American highlands.  This couple is situated in a mountainous area filled with cocaine farms and the criminals who run them--criminals who happen upon Morse, and see him as easy money.Just prior to Morse's kidnapping, we're clued in to the loose ends in the Morse-Ryan  marriage.  Of course, these ends are left flapping by the unexpected and horrendous kidnap.The way Morse portrays his character is appealing.  He comes across as a decent, grounded man who's deeply committed to humanitarian work, but who's also nobody's fool. In the early part of the movie, I expected to also like Morse's wife (Ryan), but I didn't.  Instead, Ryan's character seemed immature, inconsistent, and off balance. I knew the movie blurb had given away that the negotiator falls in love with the wife, so in the early parts, I often thought to myself: he falls in love with that??Pamela Reed (as Morse's older sister) flies down from the States after her brother's capture.  She adds even more distress to the situation with her controlling, annoying behaviors.  (I found myself wondering how she and her brother could have come from the same family--but then I remembered, oh yah, I've seen that happen!)  I suppose her slot in this plot was to contribute to a potential solution.  Except for that, however, she didn't add much.  It seemed like a less than optimal use of an otherwise fine actress.As for the negotiator, Crowe is on screen awhile before his character actually commits to helping with this rescue.  The way his involvement was finalized seemed improbable to me.  (Besides Crowe, there were a few other minor aspects where I also winced over improbabilities.)  Even so, in a fast-moving action and suspense story like this one, details that raise one's eyebrows, can easily become forgivable bumps in the road as the story hurtles forward.Crowe's characterization of the negotiator was subtle and compelling.  Often Crowe is cast as a macho figure, but here, his persona was nuanced.  OK, the story did call for him to be a fearless action hero a few times (thrilling!).  Even so, his character's personality was primarily revealed in his quiet control--in his ability to ever be the masterful center of calm in the chaos.David Morse's character showed what he was made of by how he responded to imprisonment, where he dealt with crude accommodations, wounding, danger, and uncertainty.  A key focus strengthened Morse through-out his ordeal (and you'll see what that was when you watch the video).  In the prison camp, Morse meets a fascinating captive who is other than he initially seems.  This captive strengthens the plot well, ultimately becoming essential to the forward movement of the story.The pacing was indeed artful--something I was vaguely aware of while watching, but which grows in my appreciation now the more I reflect on it.  Often the pacing subtly reiterated the content of a scene, which was particularly true for Crowe's character's unfoldment. Because the story delivers twists and turns right through to the final scenes, you definitely won't notice time passing, and this makes the movie fabulous escapism.Beyond that, I won't give away more, except to say that the ending was genuinely satisfying.  Some movies disappointingly ""stop,"" but without actually concluding.  In lieu of a conclusion, the credits roll, and loud music is the signal that the film is over.  To me, this is a mindless way to end which blows off the viewer. This movie, however, respects its characters, as well as the audience, because it never goes for cheap ground.  Consequently, by wrapping up key threads, it lands soundly on its finale (and you might even realize later that the ending was subtly foreshadowed.)  It's definitely a conclusion that will stay with you.",4,Fantastic escapism!,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,4664,"['Amazon', 'Prime', 'membership', 'movie', ""n't"", 'grab', 'soon', 'opening', 'bye', 'bye', 'Here', 'opening', 'segments', 'pulled', 'movie', 'quickly', 'deeply', 'due', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'edge', 'seat', 'gripping', 'initial', 'promise', 'was', 'real', 'more', 'same', 'was', 'delivered', 'royally', 'movie', 'entirety', 'Beautiful', 'scenery', 'top', 'stars', 'aside', 'like', 'fast-moving', 'plots', 'interesting', 'unpredictable', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'guessing', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'three', 'lead', 'characters', 'share', 'load', 'carrying', 'film', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'character', 'professional', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'who', 'world', 'arranging', 'high-level', 'often', 'dangerous', 'extractions', 'David', 'Morse', 'character', 'engineer', 'humanitarian', 'projects', 'involvement', 'taken', 'wife', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'country', 'called', 'Tecala', 'South', 'American', 'highlands', 'couple', 'situated', 'mountainous', 'area', 'filled', 'cocaine', 'farms', 'criminals', 'who', 'run', 'criminals', 'who', 'happen', 'Morse', 'see', 'easy', 'money.Just', 'prior', 'Morse', 'kidnapping', ""'re"", 'clued', 'loose', 'ends', 'Morse-Ryan', 'marriage', 'course', 'ends', 'are', 'left', 'flapping', 'unexpected', 'horrendous', 'kidnap.The', 'way', 'Morse', 'character', 'appealing', 'across', 'decent', 'grounded', 'man', 'who', 'deeply', 'committed', 'humanitarian', 'work', 'who', 'also', 'nobody', 'fool', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'expected', 'also', 'Morse', 'wife', 'Ryan', 'did', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'Ryan', 'character', 'seemed', 'immature', 'inconsistent', 'balance', 'knew', 'movie', 'blurb', 'had', 'given', 'away', 'negotiator', 'love', 'wife', 'so', 'early', 'parts', 'often', 'thought', 'myself', 'love', 'Pamela', 'Reed', 'Morse', 'older', 'sister', 'down', 'States', 'brother', 'capture', 'even', 'more', 'distress', 'situation', 'controlling', 'annoying', 'behaviors', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'brother', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'same', 'family', 'then', 'remembered', 'oh', 'yah', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'happen', 'suppose', 'slot', 'plot', 'was', 'contribute', 'potential', 'solution', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'seemed', 'less', 'optimal', 'use', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'actress.As', 'negotiator', 'Crowe', 'screen', 'awhile', 'character', 'actually', 'helping', 'rescue', 'way', 'involvement', 'was', 'finalized', 'seemed', 'improbable', 'Crowe', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'minor', 'aspects', 'where', 'also', 'winced', 'improbabilities', 'Even', 'so', 'fast-moving', 'action', 'suspense', 'story', 'one', 'details', 'raise', 'one', 'eyebrows', 'can', 'easily', 'become', 'forgivable', 'bumps', 'road', 'story', 'forward.Crowe', 'characterization', 'negotiator', 'was', 'subtle', 'compelling', 'Often', 'Crowe', 'cast', 'macho', 'figure', 'here', 'persona', 'was', 'nuanced', 'OK', 'story', 'did', 'call', 'be', 'fearless', 'action', 'hero', 'few', 'times', 'thrilling', 'Even', 'so', 'character', 'personality', 'was', 'primarily', 'revealed', 'quiet', 'control', 'ability', 'ever', 'be', 'masterful', 'center', 'calm', 'chaos.David', 'Morse', 'character', 'showed', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'how', 'responded', 'imprisonment', 'where', 'crude', 'accommodations', 'wounding', 'danger', 'uncertainty', 'key', 'focus', 'strengthened', 'Morse', 'ordeal', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'watch', 'video', 'prison', 'camp', 'Morse', 'fascinating', 'captive', 'who', 'other', 'initially', 'captive', 'plot', 'well', 'ultimately', 'becoming', 'essential', 'forward', 'movement', 'story.The', 'pacing', 'was', 'indeed', 'artful', 'something', 'was', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'watching', 'appreciation', 'now', 'more', 'reflect', 'Often', 'pacing', 'subtly', 'reiterated', 'content', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'true', 'Crowe', 'character', 'unfoldment', 'story', 'delivers', 'twists', 'turns', 'right', 'final', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'time', 'passing', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'escapism.Beyond', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'genuinely', 'satisfying', 'movies', 'disappointingly', 'stop', 'actually', 'concluding', 'lieu', 'conclusion', 'credits', 'roll', 'loud', 'music', 'signal', 'film', 'over', 'mindless', 'way', 'end', 'viewer', 'movie', 'however', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'never', 'cheap', 'ground', 'Consequently', 'wrapping', 'up', 'key', 'threads', 'soundly', 'finale', 'might', 'even', 'realize', 'later', 'ending', 'was', 'subtly', 'foreshadowed', 'definitely', 'conclusion', 'will', 'stay']",Proof of Life

In the midst of this it's refreshing to have at least one actor of Crowe's ability around.Having said that, I must say I do like Meg Ryan, and she and Crowe make a great on-screen pair here, as she turns in a fine performance herself as the wife of the kidnapped engineer and dam builder.I won't go much into the plot, as others here have already done so, except to say that the movie, once it gets going (and it gets off to a quick start) is an intense, powerful, interesting, and believeable drama from beginning to end.All in all a fine movie.

Peter's wive Aloce Bowman (Meg Ryan) is beginning to develop something more than sympathy for Terry, while her husband is being tortured in the mountains.THE CAST: Russell Crowe saved this movie as far as it was possible. His presence on the screen is charismatic and energetic. You simply believe that he is capable of all the heroic stuff. David Morse is one of my favourite supporting actors. But his character is too flat to give him any chance to create depth and credibility. Meg Ryan's attempt to act in a dramatic role is failing. Her lines are delivered with more hysteria than necessary. But the worst acting is presented by Pamela Reed who plays Peter's sister who's alway crying and yet she is making you laugh.DIRECTION: The movie begins promising with beautiful cinematography and a slow but interesting build up to the story. From there it goes downhill. The movie stays slow and never really begins before it ends. The action sequence in the end is not spectacular at all and director Hackford seems obsessed with landscapes, which as the story moves on is unnecessary slowing it down.THE DVD: The Making Of documentary is interesting because Russell Crowe has got a cool haircut but it is way too short to give any real insights. The commentary by Taylor Hackford would be more interesting if the movie would be..

580884,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005BCKF,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","Writer Tony Gilroy took his inspiration for &quot;Proof of Life&quot; from a 1998 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article entitled &quot;Adventures in the Ransom Trade&quot; by William Prochneu. About 25,000 people are kidnapped and held for ransom every year. It's big business is some parts of the world. And just as there are professional kidnappers, there is a counter-industry of professional kidnap and ransom (K&amp;R) consultants who specialize in getting the kidnap victims back at a (sort of) reasonable price. That's fascinating, and it sounds like an ideal subculture in which to situate a movie. Unfortunately, &quot;Proof of Life&quot; gives us little insight into the kidnap and ransom business and a whole lot of weak story.Peter Bowman (David Morse) is an idealistic engineer who is in a fictional South American country to build a dam for an oil company that wants to barter the humanitarian project for permission to build an oil pipeline. When he is kidnapped and held for ransom by a guerilla group, a kidnap and ransom specialist named Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) is retained by Bowman's employer to secure his release. Bowman's wife Alice (Meg Ryan) works closely with Thorne through the ups and downs of complicated negotiations designed to secure her husband's safe return.&quot;Proof of Life&quot;s &quot;hook&quot; should be in the details of the &quot;K&amp;R&quot; business. But, instead, the film tries to make the supposed tension between Alice and Terry Thorne its emotional focus. Trouble is, there is no tension. In spite of their much-publicized on-set romance, Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan have absolutely no on-screen chemistry. The script is terrible, and  Meg Ryan isn't up to the task of making it work. She is utterly unconvincing as a distraught wife. If Alice isn't distraught, then perhaps she feels guilty for not missing her husband enough. Nope. Alice doesn't even come across as being stressed. The only thing notable at all about this character is her coiffure. Meg Ryan's 20 different shades of blonde, strategically placed among her never-a-hair-out-of-place 'do give the impression that this woman is coping with her husband's abduction by sitting in a chair at the beauty parlor 4 hours a day. I have nothing against movie stars looking like movie stars, but Ryan's hair style is so conspicuous that it made me laugh. Some natural-looking tousled curls would have been more keeping with her &quot;little hippy&quot; character and supposedly aggrieved state of mind. On a more positive note, David Morse is convincing as a kidnap victim. And Russell Crowe gives a fine performance in spite of weak dialogue. He is wonderfully charismatic as SAS veteran Terry Thorne, a consummate professional who feels unusually conflicted on this case. David Caruso is spotty in his supporting role as a fellow K&amp;R guy. And Pamela Reed gives a nice performance as Peter's overbearing sister.I hope that someone in Hollywood comes up with a good K&amp;R script at some point. I'd love to see the movie. But I can only recommend &quot;Proof of Life&quot; to big Russell Crowe fans.  I think his performance here is more imposing than in &quot;Gladiator&quot;, although it's simply not as nuanced a role as in &quot;L.A.

For an action movie, Russell Crowe is a natural choice, even though he's playing a less brutal role here than he usually does. But Meg Ryan? Generally she works best in romantic comedies, and while there's no comedy in Proof of Life, the screenwriters do attempt to insert some romance here... which leads to the major downfall of this movie-- romance has no place in this action film.Why is this? Well, for one thing, Meg Ryan's character is married. For another thing, Russell Crowe's character is married. And the movie gives us little indication that, overall, either of these two characters are unhappy with their marriages. On the contrary, Russell Crowe's character is shown to be unhappy that his job sends him away from home-- a plot vein that is quickly cut and discarded in order to put his character together with Meg Ryan for the rest of the movie, whether it makes sense or not.Russell Crowe plays Terry Thorne, prime-time hostage negotiator sent in to manage the case of Peter Bowman (David Morse), an oil executive abducted by a South American terrorist faction. When Bowman's employer divests itself of him following his abduction and the ensuing ransom, Terry's job is done and he returns home. What follows is one of the most inexplicably ridiculous plot devices I've ever seen, and if not for it (and a contrived Ryan/Crowe scene later in the film), Proof of Life would have been rated higher.This is an entertaining film with a good bit of action. It's suspenseful, the direction is effective, and the soundtrack is very good. The DVD is a no-frills package unlike Crowe's previous film, but the quality is good in terms of both audio and video.

580891,A10ZE8HITPZ503,B00005BCKF,"oamaz ""oamazonka""","[1, 1]","This movie about the negotiator Therry Thorne who, to clear his conscience, undertakes to rescue desperate Alice Bowman's husband, who is being held hostage by some South American guerrillas, has been eagerly anticipated by Crowe's fans (and not only by them) and deserves especial scrutiny after Gladiator's overwhelming success. However, I've nothing new to say about the Gladi-actor: Crowe's set of facial expressions may be limited (as some critic said), but he's got enough of them to show his character's tough and reserved exterior, as well as sensitive, tender hidden feelings, mostly betrayed through his eyes. The story is pushed along by Crowe's charisma and persuasive performance. True, the movie drags slowly for the first 40 minutes, but as Thorne steps into business, things start rolling. And it's always a treat to see Crowe in action scenes.D Morse's performance has won much praise and I can only join my voice to them: the audience roots for him - courageous and suffering Peter Bowman.As to Alice Bowman, some reviewers critisized her harshly and called her bad names, but I'd not judge her so harsh: we can't blame her for falling for Thorne (hey, girls, wouldn't you?), considering his charm and her despair and need for support. The problem is that M Ryan succeeds in showing she's falling for Thorne much more convincingly than showing she still loves her husband and wants him back (she should seriously concentrate her acting efforts on that). I sincerely tried to like her, but Ryan simply is not the actress to reflect her Alice pulling out such moral dilemma. While Crowe easily keeps distance (although his eyes betray reflection of hidden feelings), his Therry being supportive and compassionate, delightful glitter in Alice's eyes says &quot;I can't wait to be left tete-a-tete with this guy&quot; (like in a scene in the airport, when Peter's sister is leaving). While captive Peter's reminiscences of Alice are touching and she remains his only hope to keep himself sane, her direct stares at Thorne and lame theatrics are unsettling and annoying. This plot line is a complete dead-end.To sum up, it's a good thriller about patience, courage, self-sacrifice and dangers of working in Equador, spoiled by hit-and-miss attempts to water it with lame romance.

580896,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005BCKF,Reviewer,"[40, 44]","The inherent dangers of living in a country in which political agendas have been compromised, and where wealth takes precedence over integrity, are made brutally clear to an American engineer who takes a job in South America, only to become the victim of a kidnapping for ransom in ""Proof Of Life,"" directed by Taylor Hackford and starring Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan.  Peter Bowman (David Morse) is hired by an oil company to build a dam that will facilitate the construction of a pipeline, but is kidnapped at random by a band of guerrillas whose political agenda has long since given way to the more lucrative business of terrorism purely for the sake of capital gains.  When it happens, the London based insurance company whose business it is to underwrite conglomerates around the world to cover this particular kind of situation sends in it's ""K&amp;R"" (Kidnap and ransom) man, Terry Thorne (Crowe), to negotiate the release of Bowman.  And it quickly becomes a game in which most of the participants, including Bowman's wife, Alice (Ryan), would rather not participate; the catch is, you play the game, or one of the principles involved-- in this case Peter Bowman-- dies.  Hackford's drama examines what it is like to face the reality of a situation over which you have neither experience nor control, and looks at it from the perspective of the victim, as well as that of those dealing with it on the other end.  How does one respond to the kind of circumstances previously known only from news reports and movies, the things that only happen to others, but never to you.  What would it be like to have to put your life, or the life of a loved one (as in this case), in the hands of a total stranger?  It's thought provoking, sobering material that drives home the rather tentative state of the world in which we live.  Crowe turns in a dynamic performance here as Thorne, the professional negotiator who of necessity forms a strong bond with the wife of the man whose freedom he is attempting to secure, and he very subtly keeps the conflict within him apparent, while maintaining the integrity of the character on the surface.  A terrifically expressive actor, Crowe credibly conveys the complexity of his situation while exhibiting a stoic exterior strength, and it's his ability to give depth (aided in no small part by his magnetic screen presence) to what could easily have been a one-dimensional character that makes him believable, and makes Thorne memorable.  Meg Ryan lends emotional depth to Alice, though it's not a part that realizes nor utilizes the best of her abilities as an actress.  She does manage to bring some insight to the character, mainly through allusions to recent events in her life, though because of the story she is necessarily kept in the present and concerned with the immediate situation.  The relationship between Thorne and Alice is handled delicately and quite skillfully; that there would be a mutual attraction between them is believable, given the lack of intimacy in Thorne's life (which is succinctly established) and the emotional needs of Alice's current condition.  The impropriety of any possible relationship at this juncture is never verbalized but is entirely understood; and that Hackford never gives in to the temptation of sensationalizing their feelings for one another is significant, in that it ultimately heightens the emotional impact of the climax.  David Morse gives an accomplished performance as Peter Bowman, with his emotional development over the length of his captivity especially well expressed and realized, and he is responsible for many of the very ""real"" moments throughout the film.  His reactions during the kidnapping sequence, for instance, give it an added intensity that make it all the more believable.  In a smaller role, David Caruso (Dino) gives a passable performance, but can do little more than create a character that is, in essence, a shallow imitation of Thorne (which makes you appreciate Crowe's performance all the more).  Hackford has an eye for detail and tells his story with a very deliberate pace and includes some stunningly expansive visual shots, but allows the overall intensity to wane a bit, which somewhat mitigates the emotional involvement of the audience, though the drama remains intact.  In the end, however,  ""Proof Of Life"" is tightly wound and delivered and will hold your interest while bringing you face to face with just how fragile life can be; powerful food for thought that refuses to let you off the hook even as you leave the theater or click off the video.",4,Good Drama,977097600,"12 18, 2000",2000,4583,"['inherent', 'dangers', 'living', 'country', 'political', 'agendas', 'have', 'been', 'compromised', 'where', 'wealth', 'precedence', 'integrity', 'are', 'made', 'brutally', 'clear', 'American', 'engineer', 'who', 'job', 'South', 'America', 'only', 'become', 'victim', 'kidnapping', 'ransom', 'Proof', 'Life', 'directed', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'starring', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Peter', 'Bowman', 'David', 'Morse', 'hired', 'oil', 'company', 'build', 'dam', 'will', 'facilitate', 'construction', 'pipeline', 'kidnapped', 'random', 'band', 'guerrillas', 'political', 'agenda', 'long', 'given', 'way', 'more', 'lucrative', 'business', 'terrorism', 'purely', 'sake', 'capital', 'gains', 'When', 'London', 'based', 'insurance', 'company', 'business', 'underwrite', 'conglomerates', 'world', 'cover', 'particular', 'kind', 'situation', 'sends', 'K', 'amp', 'R', 'Kidnap', 'ransom', 'man', 'Terry', 'Thorne', 'Crowe', 'negotiate', 'release', 'Bowman', 'quickly', 'game', 'most', 'participants', 'including', 'Bowman', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Ryan', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'participate', 'catch', 'play', 'game', 'one', 'principles', 'involved', 'case', 'Peter', 'Bowman', 'dies', 'Hackford', 'drama', 'what', 'face', 'reality', 'situation', 'have', 'experience', 'control', 'perspective', 'victim', 'as', 'well', 'dealing', 'other', 'end', 'How', 'one', 'respond', 'kind', 'circumstances', 'previously', 'known', 'only', 'news', 'reports', 'movies', 'things', 'only', 'happen', 'others', 'never', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'put', 'life', 'life', 'loved', 'one', 'case', 'hands', 'total', 'stranger', 'thought', 'provoking', 'sobering', 'material', 'home', 'rather', 'tentative', 'state', 'world', 'live', 'Crowe', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'here', 'Thorne', 'professional', 'negotiator', 'who', 'necessity', 'forms', 'strong', 'bond', 'wife', 'man', 'freedom', 'attempting', 'secure', 'very', 'subtly', 'conflict', 'apparent', 'maintaining', 'integrity', 'character', 'surface', 'terrifically', 'expressive', 'actor', 'Crowe', 'credibly', 'conveys', 'complexity', 'situation', 'exhibiting', 'stoic', 'exterior', 'strength', 'ability', 'give', 'depth', 'aided', 'small', 'part', 'magnetic', 'screen', 'presence', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'believable', 'Thorne', 'memorable', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Alice', 'not', 'part', 'best', 'abilities', 'actress', 'manage', 'bring', 'insight', 'character', 'mainly', 'allusions', 'recent', 'events', 'life', 'story', 'necessarily', 'kept', 'present', 'concerned', 'immediate', 'situation', 'relationship', 'Thorne', 'Alice', 'handled', 'delicately', 'quite', 'skillfully', 'would', 'be', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'believable', 'given', 'lack', 'intimacy', 'Thorne', 'life', 'succinctly', 'established', 'emotional', 'needs', 'Alice', 'current', 'condition', 'impropriety', 'possible', 'relationship', 'juncture', 'never', 'verbalized', 'entirely', 'understood', 'Hackford', 'never', 'temptation', 'sensationalizing', 'feelings', 'one', 'significant', 'ultimately', 'emotional', 'impact', 'climax', 'David', 'Morse', 'accomplished', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Bowman', 'emotional', 'development', 'length', 'captivity', 'especially', 'well', 'expressed', 'realized', 'responsible', 'many', 'very', 'real', 'moments', 'film', 'reactions', 'kidnapping', 'sequence', 'instance', 'give', 'added', 'intensity', 'make', 'more', 'believable', 'smaller', 'role', 'David', 'Caruso', 'Dino', 'passable', 'performance', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'create', 'character', 'essence', 'shallow', 'imitation', 'Thorne', 'appreciate', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'more', 'Hackford', 'eye', 'detail', 'story', 'very', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'stunningly', 'expansive', 'visual', 'shots', 'overall', 'intensity', 'wane', 'bit', 'somewhat', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'audience', 'drama', 'intact', 'end', 'however', 'Proof', 'Life', 'tightly', 'wound', 'delivered', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'bringing', 'face', 'face', 'just', 'how', 'fragile', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'powerful', 'food', 'thought', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'even', 'leave', 'theater', 'click', 'off', 'video']",Proof of Life

It has recently taken them to the Latin American country of Tecala. On his way to work one morning, Peter runs into a road block and is pulled from his car by rebels who make money by kidnapping executives who have Kidnap and Ransom insurance. Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) shows up to take the case but has to leave when they find out that Peter Bowman wasn't insured by his firm. Terry returns a few days later and takes the case with no promise of getting paid for mysterious emotional reasons. He works side by side with Alice (Meg Ryan) fighting to reach a deal that will bring Peter home.My Opinion:  This movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I found it to be very gripping and exciting. I liked both Peter's plot line and Alice and Terry's. The contrast of the two situations was quite interesting. Peter in the mountains with no comforts, injured feet, and constant stress never knowing if he'll be killed and Terry and Alice in the city with the comforts, injured hearts, constant stress, and never knowing if Peter is alive. I would have liked the deleted love scene to be included as an extra feature on the DVD. I'm not sure if I would have liked the movie more or less with it in it. There is something compelling about unfulfilled forbidden love. What I do know is that David Caruso gives and awesome performance.

Terry immediately takes charge of the situation and gives Alice hope that her husband will soon return to her.  However, Terry has barely started working on the case when he is pulled.  Turns out Peter's company was trying to cut costs so they cut the hostage insurance.  With no means to pay Terry's exorbitant fee, Alice is left on her own.  Burned out and disillusioned, Terry just wants a well-deserved break, but he cannot leave Alice to fight for her husband on her own, so he returns and takes the case for nothing.Terry's hopes for a quick resolution are now gone because he doesn't have a corporation's money to rely upon.  Instead, he has to rely on whatever cash Alice and Peter's family can raise and deal with the kidnappers on his own.  As Alice and Terry struggle to come up with a plan to get Peter back safely, Peter is fighting just to stay alive.  He is forced to hike over barren vistas and eventually ends up in a small encampment where other wealthy hostages are kept awaiting their paid ransoms.  As the weeks stretch into months, Peter almost gives up hope of ever being rescued, his worn picture of Alice his only lifeline.  Back in the city, Alice is desperately trying to fight her attraction to Terry and feeling guilty about it, especially with Peter's life on the line...Proof of Life was an enjoyable film, but emotionally lacking.  It was the premise of the movie that drew me in, the idea that there are still groups of people out there in third world countries who rely on kidnapping wealthy foreigners to make a living is just astonishing.  I was a bit disappointed that there was not more background information and such included in the film as I think that would have made it more interesting.  The actors did a fine job, for the most part, but I felt that there was no emotional connection between any of them.  Russell Crowe was superb in his role as a kidnap &amp; ransom negotiator and I totally bought him as an ex-soldier.  He was definitely calm under pressure and I could even understand why he would not let himself get involved with Alice, even though he clearly wanted to.  As another reviewer mentioned, there are lots of little details surrounding Crowe (his use of guns &amp; knives) that made him seem like the real deal, even though he isn't.  I didn't find myself feeling a whole heck of a lot for Meg Ryan or David Morse.  Meg Ryan was just kind of empty for me.  She was there, she took up space and was breathing, but I didn't ever connect with her character and the whole love triangle thing was hinging on her and she just didn't pull it through so I never really bought it.  David Morse I flat out disliked at the beginning and, though I grew to like him more as the film progressed, I never really liked him all that much.  It would have been better if director Taylor Hackford had gone in the action-adventure direction instead of a character-driven direction because these actors just weren't able to pull it off.  Still, this movie has some stunning vistas of Ecuador and a few interesting moments with a great rescue scene at the end.  Rent it at a time when nothing new has come out just so you can say that you've seen it...",3,Just Keep Your Eye on Russell Crowe &amp; Ignore the Rest,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,4182,"['Peter', 'Bowman', 'David', 'Morse', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'have', 'spent', 'years', 'living', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'first', 'Alice', 'loved', 'immersed', 'different', 'cultures', 'trying', 'learn', 'language', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'people', 'was', 'living', 'starting', 'resent', 'life', 'Peter', 'engineer', 'building', 'dam', 'fictional', 'country', 'Tecala', 'South', 'America', 'running', 'lot', 'problems', 'site', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'deal', 'Alice', 'insecurities', 'time', 'relationship', 'stretched', 'breaking', 'point', 'ready', 'snap', 'moment', 'when', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'Peter', 'kidnapped', 'busy', 'street', 'group', 'guerillas', 'broad', 'daylight.Panic', 'stricken', 'Alice', 'immediately', 'Peter', 'corporation', 'help', 'send', 'Terry', 'Thorne', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'ex-soldier', 'turned', 'kidnap', 'amp', 'negotiator', 'global', 'firm', 'commission', 'rescued', 'hostages', 'Terry', 'immediately', 'charge', 'situation', 'Alice', 'hope', 'husband', 'will', 'soon', 'return', 'However', 'Terry', 'barely', 'started', 'working', 'case', 'when', 'pulled', 'out', 'Peter', 'company', 'was', 'trying', 'cut', 'costs', 'cut', 'hostage', 'insurance', 'means', 'pay', 'Terry', 'exorbitant', 'fee', 'Alice', 'left', 'own', 'Burned', 'out', 'disillusioned', 'Terry', 'just', 'well-deserved', 'break', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'Alice', 'fight', 'husband', 'own', 'case', 'nothing.Terry', 'hopes', 'quick', 'resolution', 'are', 'now', 'gone', 'because', ""n't"", 'have', 'corporation', 'money', 'rely', 'Instead', 'rely', 'cash', 'Alice', 'Peter', 'family', 'can', 'raise', 'deal', 'kidnappers', 'own', 'Alice', 'Terry', 'struggle', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'get', 'Peter', 'back', 'safely', 'Peter', 'fighting', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'forced', 'hike', 'over', 'barren', 'vistas', 'eventually', 'up', 'small', 'encampment', 'where', 'other', 'wealthy', 'hostages', 'are', 'kept', 'awaiting', 'paid', 'ransoms', 'weeks', 'stretch', 'months', 'Peter', 'almost', 'up', 'hope', 'ever', 'being', 'rescued', 'worn', 'picture', 'Alice', 'only', 'lifeline', 'Back', 'city', 'Alice', 'desperately', 'trying', 'fight', 'attraction', 'Terry', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'especially', 'Peter', 'life', 'line', 'Proof', 'Life', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'emotionally', 'lacking', 'was', 'premise', 'movie', 'drew', 'idea', 'are', 'still', 'groups', 'people', 'there', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'who', 'rely', 'kidnapping', 'wealthy', 'foreigners', 'make', 'living', 'just', 'astonishing', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'such', 'included', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'was', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'superb', 'role', 'kidnap', 'amp', 'negotiator', 'totally', 'bought', 'ex-soldier', 'was', 'definitely', 'calm', 'pressure', 'could', 'even', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'get', 'involved', 'Alice', 'even', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'are', 'lots', 'little', 'details', 'surrounding', 'Crowe', 'use', 'guns', 'amp', 'knives', 'made', 'seem', 'real', 'deal', 'even', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'feeling', 'whole', 'heck', 'lot', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'David', 'Morse', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'empty', 'was', 'there', 'took', 'up', 'space', 'was', 'breathing', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'connect', 'character', 'whole', 'love', 'triangle', 'thing', 'was', 'hinging', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'so', 'never', 'really', 'bought', 'David', 'Morse', 'flat', 'out', 'disliked', 'beginning', 'grew', 'like', 'more', 'film', 'progressed', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'that', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'had', 'gone', 'action-adventure', 'direction', 'instead', 'character-driven', 'direction', 'actors', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Still', 'movie', 'stunning', 'vistas', 'Ecuador', 'few', 'interesting', 'moments', 'great', 'rescue', 'scene', 'end', 'Rent', 'time', 'when', 'nothing', 'new', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Proof of Life
580903,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005BCKF,S. Schell,"[0, 1]","Based upon a Vanity Fair article (""Adventures In The Ransom Trade"" by William Prochnau) and a man's personal account of an abduction by Colombian guerillas (Tom Hargrove), ""Proof of Life"" sports an exclusive cast and talented filmmakers but retained the misfortune of unfavorable media prior to its release.  This $70 million escapade from director Taylor Hackford (Ray) began screening in December of 2000 after much-publicized debate on the relationship between leading lady Meg Ryan and co-star Russell Crowe.  Hackford was dismayed by the predatory slant of the press, remarking that ""people put a huge amount of time, effort and talent into this and it's being usurped by the tabloids.  They say there's no publicity that's bad publicity, but I'm not so sure.""  Over 20 people reportedly left the production because of altitude sickness (filming took place in the Ecuadorian mountains) and the set was plagued by the death of stuntman William Gaffney, an automobile plunge off a cliff during a routine shot killing him instantly.Most of the story is set in a fictionalized South American country called Tecala, Alice Bowman (Ryan) currently residing there with her industrial engineer husband Peter (Morse).  Peter's job has required him to consistently relocate and Alice has grudgingly packed her bags each time, resentful of their inability to root themselves in one place.  Tecala is a state known for its high rate of kidnapping and one morning as Peter braves a jungle roadway, he encounters a guerilla barricade and is taken hostage, his captors hiding him away in the misty and suffocating atmosphere of the Andes.  Any hope that Alice had of peace and quiet is shattered, Peter's captors demanding thousands of dollars in ransom for his return.  She is well lacking of their demands and becomes desperate for a solution, her sister-in-law Janis (Reed) her only solace.  A couple of phone calls later, Terry Thorne (Crowe), a trained negotiator, is brought to the scene and the negotiation process for Peter commences.  During his arduous parleys with Peter's captors, Terry's relationship with Alice becomes more than platonic and he is faced with a moral dilemma.  It is at this point that the movie loses a little credibility, its histrionic excitement forfeited for the divulgence of forbidden romance.This is the third collaboration for Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the two having worked together previously on ""The Devil's Advocate"" and ""Dolores Claiborne"".  Hackford admitted during an interview that he had filmed a more explicit love scene between Crowe and Ryan but it didn't make the final cut, stating that it was solely his decision to remove it and that ""too much romance detracts from the action-adventure; I wanted the relationship between the characters to be tenuous and ambiguous "".  This was a wise choice on Hackford's part because even the desperate kiss that Crowe steals from Ryan before heading out into combat is somewhat superfluous and baffling (yet it remained in the film, a small and enigmatic remnant of Hackford's missing footage).Morse underwent the grueling task of slimming down for his scenes in the misty mountaintops, getting gaunt on a diet prepared by the doctor who thinned down Tom Hanks for ""Cast Away"".  This guy rarely gives a bad performance (The Green Mile, Hearts In Atlantis, Dancer In The Dark, etc.) and is equally impressive here as the stonewalling Peter.  Ryan has the potential to be a great dramatic actress (When A Man Loves A Woman, City of Angels) but because of her numerous roles in romantic comedies, there is the feeling that she is miscast.  Ridley Scott's Greco-Roman juggernaut ""Gladiator"" was released over six months prior to ""Proof Of Life"", creating a nice buzz for Crowe and giving the film a beneficial boost in ticket sales.  It certainly didn't hurt either that Crowe garnered an Academy Award nomination the year prior for the role of Jeffrey Wigand in ""The Insider"".  It's just as well that he gives a good performance here as Terry Thorne.  David Caruso makes an appearance in a small role - with what little times he gets, I believe it's the most entertaining performance I've ever seen from him.Bottom line: If you see ""Proof of Life"", go for the suspenseful storytelling and remember that it's not very far removed from what happened to a real guy (Tom Hargrove).

Unfortunately, the thing most remembered about this movie is the real life romance between he and his costar Meg Ryan. I believe this is why the movie was never really seen for what it was - a well made drama with action that is done realistically and with intensity.The two stars of this film are Crowe and David Morse. Crowe is the K&R; (kidnap and ransom) man - a professional hired by insurance companies that specialize in negotiating for victims of kidnapping. The term ""proof of life"" is one those in Crowe's profession use when negotiating so they know their ""client"" is still alive. Morse plays an idealistic engineer who is working to build a damn that he thinks will save the impoverished lives of those in the mythical country of Tecala (which represents Columbia). He ends up getting kidnapped by the local ""revolutionaries"" who earn their money by growing cocaine and ransoming their victims.Both of these men are excellent actors in their own right, and have an intensity about them that gives the film a slow burn throughout the film. David Caruso also plays a memorable part as  Dino, Crowe's partner throughout most of the film. With the power Crowe, Morse, and Caruso deliver, Meg Ryan sadly lacks in this film, and brings nothing interesting to the role.Taylor Hackford (director of such films as ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and ""Ray"") had real K&R; consultants as well as military advisors to train the actors in the film. This is clearly evident as Crowe and Caruso make their way through the story with incredible nerve and professionalism. Meanwhile Morse delivers the emotional punch that makes the film and the story that much stronger.The relationship between Crowe and Ryan can be ignored.

I believe all the bad publicity circling around the so-called affair between he and Meg Ryan really overshadowed this fine film. It is a very good film and very enjoyable and well acted.

I enjoyed this film because of the male stars and in spite of the female ones. Crowe, Morse, and Caruso are completely believable and intriguing. Ryan and Reed (who played her sister-in-law) are so bad they kept reminding me I was watching acting. The men could have acted opposite styrofoam dummies and done as well. It's amazing to see Crowe's Terry Thorne yearn for Ryan's Alice Bowman, whose own facial expressions reflect an awkward, gassy discomfort. Loved the film's climactic scene--excellently written, choreographed, filmed, and acted. Worth watching. The three stars are for the men.

If you have the DVd edition then you also get a detailed commentary by the director which, in my opinion, really adds to one's understanding of the movie and why it was made. It is based on the real-life kidnap experience of a westerner in Colombia. It is a fascinating look into the life of kidnap and ransom experts. This film has something for everyone - drama, suspense, just enough action to stop it becoming a war-film, and even a little romance, or the hint of it. What I really like about this movie is that there is no sex scene. I am sure that a lot of reviewers would have condemned this film for not having one, but I commend the director for not putting one in (actually there was one made for it but due to the real life relationshop between Ryan and Russal at the time, it was thought that it was in bad taste). You don't need to have a sex scene to pander to the audience and, after all, what is so wonderful about adultery anyhow??? I'm no prude.

What happened with this movie is that someone signed Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe to the deal and said &quot;this movie will make itself,&quot; but found out that movies need a story and character developement to make them successful. So, what the viewing audience got was a thrown together sloppy romance movie advertised as an action thriller.

Not even an Adam Sandler movie makes me want the main characters to be finished off by terrorists.

I had also heard that this movie was strictly an action.  I didn't know what to believe.  Proof of Life stars Meg Ryan, Russell Crowe, David Morse, and David Caruso.  Ryan plays Alice Bowman, a horrified wife who is trying to save her kidnapped husband from a band of South American terrorists.  Crowe plays Terry Thorne, the designated KNR (kidnap and rescue) consultant who is trying to negotiate the ransom of Morse.  The movie is a compilation of drama and action, with a hint of romance between the two main characters.  It's a rather good story with semi-good acting by Crowe and Ryan.  What really surprised me about this movie was the great acting by David Morse and David Caruso.  It was an interesting sight to see Morse's character go from a very clean shaven human being to a hardened survivor.  Caruso adds a bit of comedy to this movie and plays Crowe's friend and also doubles as another KNR consultant.  Usually Caruso gets stuck with a bad roll, but in this movie he really shines and shows his true acting capability.  I enjoyed this movie mainly beacuse of the gripping and intersting story it showed.  After watching it, one can imagine the horror of being abducted.
