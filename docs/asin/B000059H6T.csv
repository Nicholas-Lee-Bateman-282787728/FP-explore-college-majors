572131,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000059H6T,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","This adoption of a lesser-known 19th century novel delivers the goods in reliable BBC fashion. This story of a young middle class girl's sentimental education features two tremendous performances. Michael Gambon brings to life the strong-willed squire full of prejudice and spleen but nonetheless with a heart of gold. Francesca Anis is wonderful as Claire, aka Hyacinth, the silly, selfish,snobby stepmother.Justine Waddell is also good as Molly, the central character, who speaks her mind with commendable directness. The surrounding performances are also very good, which makes this series excellent viewing. But it's not as compelling as some of the other dramatizations of Austen, Bronte or Dickens, probably because the source material is simply not as good.Elizabeth Gaskell was very popular in the 19th century and well-known as the first biographer of Charlotte Bronte. Her milieu is the subtle divide between the emerging industrial bourgeoisie and the fading landed aristocracy. Yet the producers of this series insisted in placing it in Austen-land, which does no service either to Gaskell or to the immortal Jane. Thus we have the obligatory dance scenes in which the characters twirl around to 18th century minuets which by the time of this novel's setting were as ancient and outmoded as the charleston is for us today.I said the source material is not as strong as Austen because the plot meanders a little too much and because the characters, apart from Claire and the old squire, are simply not as compelling. Molly is a bit too much of a goody-goody, her beloved Roger is a total goody-goody and their love never got my pulse racing.Still this series is good stuff -- lovely scenery, nice music, great costumes especially hats and veteran British actors doing their thing.",4,Reliable BBC costume drama,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,1791,"['adoption', 'lesser-known', '19th', 'century', 'novel', 'goods', 'reliable', 'BBC', 'fashion', 'story', 'young', 'middle', 'class', 'girl', 'sentimental', 'education', 'features', 'two', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'life', 'strong-willed', 'squire', 'full', 'prejudice', 'spleen', 'nonetheless', 'heart', 'gold', 'Francesca', 'Anis', 'wonderful', 'Claire', 'aka', 'Hyacinth', 'silly', 'selfish', 'snobby', 'stepmother.Justine', 'Waddell', 'also', 'good', 'Molly', 'central', 'character', 'who', 'mind', 'commendable', 'directness', 'surrounding', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', 'other', 'dramatizations', 'Austen', 'Bronte', 'Dickens', 'probably', 'source', 'material', 'simply', 'not', 'good.Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'was', 'very', 'popular', '19th', 'century', 'well-known', 'first', 'biographer', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'milieu', 'subtle', 'divide', 'emerging', 'industrial', 'bourgeoisie', 'fading', 'landed', 'aristocracy', 'producers', 'series', 'insisted', 'placing', 'Austen-land', 'service', 'either', 'Gaskell', 'immortal', 'Jane', 'Thus', 'have', 'obligatory', 'dance', 'scenes', 'characters', 'twirl', '18th', 'century', 'minuets', 'time', 'novel', 'setting', 'were', 'ancient', 'outmoded', 'charleston', 'said', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'Austen', 'plot', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'characters', 'apart', 'Claire', 'old', 'squire', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'compelling', 'Molly', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'goody-goody', 'beloved', 'Roger', 'total', 'goody-goody', 'love', 'never', 'got', 'pulse', 'racing.Still', 'series', 'good', 'stuff', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'nice', 'music', 'great', 'costumes', 'especially', 'hats', 'veteran', 'British', 'actors', 'doing', 'thing']",Wives and Daughters

572134,A1E5RX20ZJNFWJ,B000059H6T,Amazon Customer,"[50, 53]","After seeing the mini-series on PBS, I just had to read the book and buy the DVD! The same production team that made the wonderful 1996 adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; did a superb job in adapting &quot;Wives and Daughters.&quot; The cast also does justice to the way the characters were written by Mrs. Gaskell -- my only reservations were Keely Hawes as the beautiful Cynthia (her hair style was very unappealing; in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; she is ten times more good-looking), and Anthony Howell as Roger had to grow on me after a few viewings to be fully appreciated. But Justine Waddell just shines as Molly, and Bill Paterson as Mr. Gibson and Sir Michael Gambon as Squire Hamley are in top form (the latter justly deserving all the kudos and awards he received in the UK).I was immensely pleased with the 3-disc DVD. The first two have each two episodes, as shown on TV, with scene selection capabilities (my only complaint is that they do not have any subtitles available). The picture is crystal clear and very sharp. Other BBC productions, such as P&amp;P and Emma, which are much darker, don't age particularly well, but the brightness in Wives and Daughters makes it fresh and the quality equals that of a feature film.The third disc is reserved for the extra features: cast bios (the print could have been a bit larger) and two &quot;featurettes&quot;, &quot;Who the Dickens is Mrs. Gaskell?&quot; and the &quot;Making-of&quot; of Wives and Daughters. The Making-of is just delightful. It runs 20 minutes long, and shows a lot of cast-member interviews (some in modern clothes, which is a real kick -- Anthony Howell in jeans and t-shirt! Justine Waddell in a bath robe!) and they all provide a lot of valuable insight into the characters. The documentary on Mrs. Gaskell is interesting, but the first 15 minutes (out of 50) are the best, as they again show more behind-the-scenes of Wives and Daughters. The rest mostly follows a group of Gaskell enthusiasts as they visit the places she lived in and discuss her other works.If you enjoyed the book and the mini-series, buy the DVD -- it is worth every penny!",5,Delightful DVD extras!,989193600,"05 7, 2001",2001,2143,"['seeing', 'mini-series', 'PBS', 'just', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'buy', 'DVD', 'same', 'production', 'team', 'made', 'wonderful', '1996', 'adaptation', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'adapting', 'quot', 'Wives', 'Daughters.', 'quot', 'cast', 'also', 'justice', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'Mrs.', 'Gaskell', 'only', 'reservations', 'were', 'Keely', 'Hawes', 'beautiful', 'Cynthia', 'hair', 'style', 'was', 'very', 'unappealing', 'quot', 'Mutual', 'Friend', 'quot', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'good-looking', 'Anthony', 'Howell', 'Roger', 'had', 'grow', 'few', 'viewings', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'just', 'shines', 'Molly', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Squire', 'Hamley', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'latter', 'justly', 'deserving', 'kudos', 'awards', 'received', 'UK', '.I', 'was', 'immensely', 'pleased', '3-disc', 'DVD', 'first', 'two', 'have', 'two', 'episodes', 'shown', 'TV', 'scene', 'selection', 'capabilities', 'only', 'complaint', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'subtitles', 'available', 'picture', 'crystal', 'clear', 'very', 'sharp', 'Other', 'BBC', 'productions', 'such', 'P', 'amp', 'P', 'Emma', 'are', 'much', 'darker', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'particularly', 'well', 'brightness', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'fresh', 'quality', 'feature', 'film.The', 'third', 'disc', 'reserved', 'extra', 'features', 'cast', 'bios', 'print', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'larger', 'two', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Who', 'Dickens', 'Mrs.', 'Gaskell', 'quot', 'quot', 'Making-of', 'quot', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'Making-of', 'just', 'delightful', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'lot', 'cast-member', 'interviews', 'modern', 'clothes', 'real', 'kick', 'Anthony', 'Howell', 'jeans', 't-shirt', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'bath', 'robe', 'provide', 'lot', 'valuable', 'insight', 'characters', 'documentary', 'Mrs.', 'Gaskell', 'interesting', 'first', '15', 'minutes', '50', 'are', 'best', 'again', 'show', 'more', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'rest', 'mostly', 'group', 'Gaskell', 'enthusiasts', 'visit', 'places', 'lived', 'discuss', 'other', 'works.If', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'mini-series', 'buy', 'DVD', 'worth', 'penny']",Wives and Daughters

572144,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B000059H6T,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[18, 19]","Simply glorious adaptation of the Mrs Gaskell's unfinished Novel - and although the story has been finished for us by Andrew Davies (who adapted Pride and Prejudice for the Screen) I didn't feel he did anything more than tie up one loose end - that of Molly - the rest of the story was left relatively untouched.This is the story of poor motherless Molly and her devoted father. He decides to remarry and the choice of wife does not prove to be wise for his new wife (and step-daughter) bring with them varying degrees of selfishness and vanity. Mrs Gaskell has imbued Molly's step-mother (Played perfectly by Francesca Annis) with a character who has a sense of superiority, complete selfishness  and an utter blindness to her own faults. Her daugther has a self-confidence and self-indulgence that makes her both adored by all and almost machiavellian in achieving her own ends.In the background are Molly's old friends, the Squire, his wife and the Squire's two sons - one of whom she loves the other of whom she wishes and tries to help.

I like to see the dresses, watch the way people interacted and here the way people spoke. There is so much more depth in these stories than in the ones today. So I enjoyed this movie for that. The acting and scenery are all wonderful, and the story is very full, with lots of characters and lots of stuff happening.I did not read the book before I watched the movie, as I do most older novels that become movies, I was so caught up in the clips I'd seen in Youtube montages (a guilty pleasure I have some people are really talented) that I couldn't wait to read the book (it's really hard finding it in mass market size), so I was somewhat unaware at how small a part of the story the romance is. I had anticipated that like other adaptations at the center of the story would be a love story, and while in a sense that is the case, it's a very internal one because the hero / heroine are seperated through out most of the movie, Roger, the romantic lead spends all but the last 20 minutes or so of the last episode in Africa, and you know as you watch the movie that he will not have any idea of Molly's feelings for him, or a chance to develop his own until he returns, I found myself becoming anxious for his return for that reason alone.

572157,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000059H6T,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","In 1999, the BBC almost singlehandedly revived interest in the neglected works of Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell with their dramatization of her final novel, WIVES AND DAUGHTERS.  Often forgotten amongst her contemporaries, Gaskell wrote with a deft insight into the social classes and invested her characters with strong moral cores.In WIVES AND DAUGHTERS, Gaskell created the closest she ever came to what could be described as a ""fairytale heroine"" - Molly Gibson.  Molly (played with great feeling and sensitivity by Justine Waddell) lives with her widowed father Dr Gibson (Bill Paterson) in the tight-knit village of Hollingford.  Molly's secure, sheltered world comes to an end when her father announces that he is to marry Hyacinth Kirkpatrick (Francesca Annis), a widowed former governess whose employment at The Towers, the estate of Lady Cumnor, will soon be surplus to requirements.Hyacinth brings with her her own capricious daughter, Cynthia (Keeley Hawes), who is quite close in age to Molly, but her exact opposite in every other respect.  As the two girls find themselves unwitting rivals in love, Molly is increasingly drawn to the two sons of Squire Hamley (Michael Gambon), who'se ill wife (Penelope Wilton) Molly helped nurse in her last months.  Eldest son Osborne (Tom Hollander) is bookish, frail and hides a heavy secret, whilst younger son Roger (Anthony Howell) shares Molly's fascination with science and geography.  Molly is heartbroken when Roger pursues an engagement with Cynthia, before leaving on an African expedition.  To Molly's frustration, Cynthia doesn't seem interested in Roger's activities, leaving Molly to keep up the correspondence.  Cynthia's indifference, as Molly will soon learn, seems to be tied up in the figure of Mr Preston (Iain Glen), a local overseer, and it's not long until Molly (operating as Cynthia's ""cat's paw"") and Preston become targets of gossip within the Hollingford community when their ""trysts"" are discovered...WIVES AND DAUGHTERS presents a wide variety of roles, all meaty assignments for the incredible roster of talents that the BBC has brought together.  Justine Waddell (""Great Expectations"", ""The Mystery of Natalie Wood"") wisely underplays her Molly Gibson, contrasting beautifully with Keeley Hawes' (""Tipping the Velvet"", ""Upstairs Downstairs"") vivacious, enchanting Cynthia.  Francesca Annis (""Partners in Crime"", ""Cranford"") is ideal as the preening, insufferably snobbish Hyacinth.Screenwriter Andrew Davies has leisurely plotted this version in four 75-minute episodes.  Davies beautifully captures the array of fascinating characters and their respective locales.  The events in WIVES AND DAUGHTERS take place in a variety of locations (and their respective class divides) from the village of Hollingford, to the estate of Lady Cumnor and the grounds of Hamley Hall.  The art design and photography is effective in its effort to delineate the boundaries of these different ""worlds"", by casting the Hollingford scenes in soft, natural shades, the mansion of Lady Cumnor in steely greys and whites; and Hamley Hall in earthy browns and reds.  Mrs Gaskell would have been delighted with this production.There is also a 1971 BBC miniseries which I sincerely hope sees the light of day on DVD in the future (that is, if it survived the extensive ""BBC archive purge""), but until then this is the most delightful, skilful screen version of Gaskell's final great work.",5,"Gaskell's final great work, a masterpiece from the BBC",1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,3438,"['1999', 'BBC', 'almost', 'singlehandedly', 'revived', 'interest', 'neglected', 'works', 'Mrs', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'dramatization', 'final', 'novel', 'WIVES', 'AND', 'DAUGHTERS', 'Often', 'forgotten', 'contemporaries', 'Gaskell', 'wrote', 'deft', 'insight', 'social', 'classes', 'invested', 'characters', 'strong', 'moral', 'cores.In', 'WIVES', 'AND', 'DAUGHTERS', 'Gaskell', 'created', 'closest', 'ever', 'came', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'fairytale', 'heroine', 'Molly', 'Gibson', 'Molly', 'played', 'great', 'feeling', 'sensitivity', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'widowed', 'father', 'Dr', 'Gibson', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'tight-knit', 'village', 'Hollingford', 'Molly', 'secure', 'sheltered', 'world', 'end', 'when', 'father', 'announces', 'marry', 'Hyacinth', 'Kirkpatrick', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'widowed', 'former', 'governess', 'employment', 'Towers', 'estate', 'Lady', 'Cumnor', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'surplus', 'requirements.Hyacinth', 'brings', 'own', 'capricious', 'daughter', 'Cynthia', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'who', 'quite', 'close', 'age', 'Molly', 'exact', 'opposite', 'other', 'respect', 'two', 'girls', 'find', 'unwitting', 'rivals', 'love', 'Molly', 'increasingly', 'drawn', 'two', 'sons', 'Squire', 'Hamley', 'Michael', 'Gambon', ""who'se"", 'ill', 'wife', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Molly', 'helped', 'nurse', 'last', 'months', 'Eldest', 'son', 'Osborne', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'bookish', 'frail', 'heavy', 'secret', 'whilst', 'younger', 'son', 'Roger', 'Anthony', 'Howell', 'shares', 'Molly', 'fascination', 'science', 'geography', 'Molly', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'Roger', 'engagement', 'Cynthia', 'leaving', 'African', 'expedition', 'Molly', 'frustration', 'Cynthia', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'Roger', 'activities', 'leaving', 'Molly', 'keep', 'up', 'correspondence', 'Cynthia', 'indifference', 'Molly', 'will', 'soon', 'learn', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'figure', 'Mr', 'Preston', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'local', 'overseer', 'not', 'long', 'Molly', 'operating', 'Cynthia', 'cat', 'paw', 'Preston', 'become', 'targets', 'gossip', 'Hollingford', 'community', 'when', 'trysts', 'are', 'discovered', 'WIVES', 'DAUGHTERS', 'wide', 'variety', 'roles', 'meaty', 'assignments', 'incredible', 'roster', 'talents', 'BBC', 'brought', 'together', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Mystery', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'wisely', 'Molly', 'Gibson', 'contrasting', 'beautifully', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'Tipping', 'Velvet', 'Downstairs', 'vivacious', 'enchanting', 'Cynthia', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'Partners', 'Crime', 'Cranford', 'ideal', 'preening', 'insufferably', 'snobbish', 'Hyacinth.Screenwriter', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'leisurely', 'plotted', 'version', 'four', '75-minute', 'episodes', 'Davies', 'beautifully', 'array', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'respective', 'locales', 'events', 'WIVES', 'DAUGHTERS', 'take', 'place', 'variety', 'locations', 'respective', 'class', 'divides', 'village', 'Hollingford', 'estate', 'Lady', 'Cumnor', 'grounds', 'Hamley', 'Hall', 'art', 'design', 'photography', 'effective', 'effort', 'delineate', 'boundaries', 'different', 'worlds', 'casting', 'Hollingford', 'scenes', 'soft', 'natural', 'shades', 'mansion', 'Lady', 'Cumnor', 'steely', 'greys', 'whites', 'Hamley', 'Hall', 'earthy', 'browns', 'reds', 'Mrs', 'Gaskell', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'delighted', 'production.There', 'also', '1971', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'light', 'day', 'DVD', 'future', 'survived', 'extensive', 'BBC', 'archive', 'purge', 'then', 'most', 'delightful', 'skilful', 'screen', 'version', 'Gaskell', 'final', 'great', 'work']",Wives and Daughters

572161,AB34G6VKP28L,B000059H6T,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[10, 10]","An acclaimed award-winning British miniseries comes to America at last in this intriguing and heartfelt story of romance, mischief, and heartbreak. The tale begins with Molly Gibson, the only child of a well-known and beloved country doctor, whose mother died when she was very young. Spirited and often outspoken, Molly is a vastly different person of society than you might anticipate. With a passionate love for her father, and an undying fascination with bugs, her happy, glittering little world soon comes tumbling down when her father announces his engagement to Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Soon her life has changed dramatically with the introduction of two fascinating young men, a past full of scandal and secrets... and a stepsister that is a glittering social butterfly to her quiet and demur solitude.The mini-series is excellently filmed and timed, from the writers and producers of Pride &amp; Prejudice. The costuming is absolutely breathtaking, the characters well-portrayed and deep, and it stays faithful to the original adaptation right down to the dialogue. Its only flaw, if any, is that the first hour rather lags, but picks up more swiftly as the plot moves into the second part. In true form, the BBC gives us a glittering array of gowns, horses, sprawling estates, and fashionable arrangements; as well as with a host of humorous side trails and dialogue. It's serious and yet comical; reaching into both areas with great success.They've packed this release with plenty of &quot;goodies,&quot; from a long biography/documentary on the author to interviews with the cast and crew. I found that the featurette was somewhat well done but that the opinions of the actors differed from their characters. Their regards to Cynthia and her mother were more sexual appeal, while I found the film very clean and without any suggestive material. Perhaps I was reading it wrong, or perhaps they overlooked the film's own high points, but in all, a very nice DVD release.",4,A Charming Adaptation,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,1973,"['acclaimed', 'award-winning', 'British', 'miniseries', 'America', 'last', 'intriguing', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'romance', 'mischief', 'heartbreak', 'tale', 'Molly', 'Gibson', 'only', 'child', 'well-known', 'beloved', 'country', 'doctor', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Spirited', 'often', 'outspoken', 'Molly', 'vastly', 'different', 'person', 'society', 'might', 'anticipate', 'passionate', 'love', 'father', 'undying', 'fascination', 'bugs', 'happy', 'glittering', 'little', 'world', 'soon', 'tumbling', 'down', 'when', 'father', 'engagement', 'Mrs.', 'Kirkpatrick', 'Soon', 'life', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'introduction', 'two', 'fascinating', 'young', 'men', 'past', 'full', 'scandal', 'secrets', 'stepsister', 'glittering', 'social', 'butterfly', 'quiet', 'demur', 'solitude.The', 'mini-series', 'excellently', 'filmed', 'timed', 'writers', 'producers', 'Pride', 'amp', 'Prejudice', 'costuming', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'characters', 'well-portrayed', 'deep', 'faithful', 'original', 'adaptation', 'right', 'down', 'dialogue', 'only', 'flaw', 'first', 'hour', 'rather', 'lags', 'up', 'more', 'swiftly', 'plot', 'second', 'part', 'true', 'form', 'BBC', 'glittering', 'array', 'gowns', 'horses', 'sprawling', 'estates', 'fashionable', 'arrangements', 'as', 'well', 'host', 'humorous', 'side', 'trails', 'dialogue', 'serious', 'yet', 'comical', 'reaching', 'areas', 'great', 'success.They', ""'ve"", 'packed', 'release', 'plenty', 'quot', 'goodies', 'quot', 'long', 'biography/documentary', 'author', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'found', 'featurette', 'was', 'somewhat', 'well', 'done', 'opinions', 'actors', 'differed', 'characters', 'regards', 'Cynthia', 'mother', 'were', 'more', 'sexual', 'appeal', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'clean', 'suggestive', 'material', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'reading', 'wrong', 'perhaps', 'overlooked', 'film', 'own', 'high', 'points', 'very', 'nice', 'DVD', 'release']",Wives and Daughters

572168,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B000059H6T,CoffeeGurl,"[11, 12]","I love Elizabeth Gaskell, a Victorian author that was sadly overshadowed by the likes of the Bronte sisters and Charles Dickens.  She was a talent in her own right and I enjoyed reading her novels.  North and South and Wives and Daughters were her most successful novels and two of my favorites of all time, which is why I had to watch the BBC adaptations of the same.  The adaptation of Wives and Daughters is beautifully done -- it kept (almost) true to the novel and I enjoyed all four episodes.  The fact that the adaptation was written and produced by the same creators of the A&E;/BBC Pride and Prejudice makes things all the better.  Molly Gibson lives a content life with her father, a respectable doctor, in the countryside.  But things change when, after spending many years alone as a widower, Mr. Gibson decides to remarry.  Molly's new mother, Claire, is a governess Molly had met briefly when she was a little girl.  The woman is self-absorbed, pompous, selfish and has airs of grandeur.  When Claire's daughter, Cynthia Kirkpatrick, moves in with them, Molly likes to have a new sister and they get along well, but when Roger Hamley, her friend and love of her life, falls for the flirtatious, attention-getter, much prettier Cynthia, Molly is heartbroken.This wonderful series set in the late Regency/pre-Victorian era is full of Gaskell's mixture of romance and poignancy.  The subplot centered on the Hamley family was my favorite in the book and it is my favorite here.  This is the storyline with the most poignancy, and some scenes moved me to the core.  The central story is of course wonderful and the actors brought the characters to life in more ways than one.  At first, I thought Justine Waddell's portrayal of Molly Gibson was kind of bland, but later I realized that simplicity was the best bet here, especially in the scenes with her stepmother and stepsister.  Bill Patterson as Mr. Gibson was great, but I enjoyed Michael Gambon as Squire Hamley (such a talented actor) and Tom Hollander as Osborne Hamley the most.  Keeley Hawes is quite good as Cynthia and she is very pretty.  Her face looks familiar, but I cannot remember where I'd seen her before, if it was in a movie or on television.  As for the production, I love the wardrobe, it captured the somewhat extravagant and elaborate fashions and hairstyles of the early 1830s.  I also loved the sets and the backdrop of the English countryside.  The cinematography isn't as impressive as the one in North and South, but some of the locations reminded me of Pride and Prejudice and that was a great treat for me.  I enjoyed this adaptation.  As for the DVD, I enjoyed the third disk containing the special features.  You appreciate a production like this all the more when you watch behind the scenes footage and learn more about the actors.  There is also some information about Elizabeth Gaskell that I found very insightful.  The one disappointing thing is that the actual series is viewed in full screen instead of wide screen.  That almost ruined the pleasure of watching this program.  Anyway, the Wives and Daughters mini-series has become one of my favorites.  This is one DVD box set that I will watch again and again!",5,Beautiful!

572169,A23UB49EG29MVT,B000059H6T,Commenter77,"[1, 1]","Where has this film been or where have I been concerning this film?  I found it in passing in a library period film search and then got busy and almost didn't play it.  So very glad I did.  I understand the author is a lesser known for some reason, and there is a move to bring her works to the forefront.  If this isn't the cream of her crop, it is likely close.  This film stands up against the most popular period presentations of the last several decades.  Excellently produced, spot-on casting and portrayals, overall even pace.  The surpassing feature, however, is the emotional depth of the characters.  These people come to life in full dimension.  There's an even flow of them, without so much extreme bad or good. Along with that, characters embody weaknesses and vulnerabilities along with their strengths. It's an effective and affecting film experience.I ran into something on this one that happens with me from time to time on this type of film, and that is the variance between my taste in looks and beauty and those of the time.  For example here, between the two son, Osbourne is said to be the handsomest and Roger to be plain in looks.  I find it the opposite.  Found this in ""Pride & Prejudice"" as well, preferring Elizabeth Bennett's looks over her sister, Jane, who is credited the beauty in the film.Regardless, this is a super outstanding period film I will be ready to share with all my friends who enjoy these and definitely add to my favorites.  It conveys its characters and the story gently, but very effectively.  There is much of interest and variety.  It is realistic in showing flaws in persons and customs, who change in some respects, but do not undergo unbelievable transformations.  I like it that the film demonstrates the reward of patience and endurance and the folly of self-indulgence and stubborn prejudice.  There is wit, humor, depth and shallowness of character, joys and sorrows, generosity and self-centeredness, wisdom and frivolity.Dr. Gibson may well become one of my all-time favorite male characters from fiction.  He is gratifying throughout, though tried and vexed, weighs in like gold in the punches.  While open and accommodating to his new female household additions, he never compromises his tender watch care for his own beloved daughter.  I love it when he tells the squire that she needs to come home now and receive some cossetting herself.  And that he calls her ""Goosie"" so affectionately.  He holds his own with the gentry along with the regular folk.  He and his faithful girl are two of the most valued and respected members of their community. The new wife and step-mother is also a remarkable character, for a different reason, with her unrelenting zeal to tweak all about her.  I love it that, though giving her proper place, the two girls do not allow her to ""live in their place,"" but make their voices heard with spirit.  She was entirely well played here, giving much interest throughout. Though we see her some mollified at the end by life's vicissitudes, we also sense she will definitely rise again.  I really enjoyed the two girls hitting it off.  Though light weight on steady character, Cynthia brings some playfulness and fun in needed relief to Molly's older-than-her-years intensity.I definitely want to read the book and will likely purchase both.  Many of these characters have a classic quality about them, the kind that becomes a type of reference.  I'll also be seeking out this author's other works and will likely find them keepers as well if they are anything like this marvel.",5,Wonderful Discovery,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,3569,"['Where', 'film', 'been', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'concerning', 'film', 'found', 'passing', 'library', 'period', 'film', 'search', 'then', 'got', 'busy', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'So', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'understand', 'author', 'lesser', 'known', 'reason', 'move', 'bring', 'works', 'forefront', ""n't"", 'cream', 'crop', 'likely', 'close', 'film', 'up', 'most', 'popular', 'period', 'presentations', 'last', 'several', 'decades', 'Excellently', 'produced', 'spot-on', 'casting', 'portrayals', 'overall', 'even', 'pace', 'surpassing', 'feature', 'however', 'emotional', 'depth', 'characters', 'people', 'come', 'life', 'full', 'dimension', 'even', 'flow', 'so', 'much', 'extreme', 'bad', 'good', 'characters', 'embody', 'weaknesses', 'vulnerabilities', 'strengths', 'effective', 'affecting', 'film', 'experience.I', 'ran', 'something', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'type', 'film', 'variance', 'taste', 'looks', 'beauty', 'time', 'example', 'here', 'two', 'son', 'Osbourne', 'said', 'be', 'handsomest', 'Roger', 'be', 'plain', 'looks', 'find', 'opposite', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'as', 'well', 'preferring', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'sister', 'Jane', 'who', 'credited', 'beauty', 'film.Regardless', 'super', 'outstanding', 'period', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'ready', 'share', 'friends', 'who', 'enjoy', 'definitely', 'add', 'favorites', 'conveys', 'characters', 'story', 'gently', 'very', 'effectively', 'much', 'interest', 'variety', 'realistic', 'showing', 'flaws', 'persons', 'customs', 'who', 'change', 'respects', 'do', 'not', 'undergo', 'unbelievable', 'transformations', 'like', 'film', 'reward', 'patience', 'endurance', 'folly', 'self-indulgence', 'stubborn', 'prejudice', 'wit', 'humor', 'depth', 'shallowness', 'character', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'generosity', 'self-centeredness', 'wisdom', 'frivolity.Dr', 'Gibson', 'may', 'well', 'become', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'male', 'characters', 'fiction', 'gratifying', 'tried', 'vexed', 'like', 'gold', 'punches', 'open', 'accommodating', 'new', 'female', 'household', 'additions', 'never', 'tender', 'watch', 'care', 'own', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'love', 'when', 'squire', 'come', 'home', 'now', 'receive', 'cossetting', 'Goosie', 'so', 'affectionately', 'own', 'gentry', 'regular', 'folk', 'faithful', 'girl', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'valued', 'respected', 'members', 'community', 'new', 'wife', 'step-mother', 'also', 'remarkable', 'character', 'different', 'reason', 'unrelenting', 'zeal', 'tweak', 'love', 'giving', 'proper', 'place', 'two', 'girls', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'live', 'place', 'make', 'voices', 'heard', 'spirit', 'was', 'entirely', 'well', 'played', 'here', 'giving', 'much', 'interest', 'see', 'mollified', 'end', 'life', 'vicissitudes', 'also', 'sense', 'will', 'definitely', 'rise', 'again', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'girls', 'hitting', 'off', 'light', 'weight', 'steady', 'character', 'Cynthia', 'playfulness', 'fun', 'needed', 'relief', 'Molly', 'older-than-her-years', 'intensity.I', 'definitely', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'likely', 'purchase', 'Many', 'characters', 'have', 'classic', 'quality', 'kind', 'type', 'reference', ""'ll"", 'also', 'be', 'seeking', 'author', 'other', 'works', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'keepers', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'anything', 'marvel']",Wives and Daughters

Generally a bit slow mvoing, it still held your interest. The costumes, locations and sets were gorgeous. Filled with pathos, touchy social situations, and your differing social levels or places in society it moved along steadily and kept your interest with a good script, hilarious dialogue and rich, beliveable characterizations. You could empathize readily with the main character and you wanted to see what would happen to this innocent young woman.Although I mentioned that the pace was a bit slow, I found it enjoyable. Through the slower pace you felt the tensions, the romantic longings and the supressed feelings. You could actually feel the hardship Molly suffered in silence and the pain of her bottled feelings. The actress who played Molly was superb and you found yourself rooting for her while everyone around her seemingly calm presence went a bit batty. I guess we all feel like Molly from time to time! Again, the locations and the clothing added to the drama immensely.  Most incredible! If you love period pictues, you will love this one.Reading the other commentators I must say:I don't think it is even reasonable to compare Wives and Daughters with A&amp;E's Pride and Prejudice. Let's face it, P&amp;P was amazing. This series has it's own charms as well, but it is an altogether different story with a different theme and tonality. Give credit where credit is due. As much as we all love Pride and Prejudice, we should give other &quot;period &quot; pictures credit without constantly holding it up to the light of A&amp;E's wonderful Pride and Prejudice. I know it is hard not to, I have caught myself doing the very same thing!The author of W&amp;D, Gaskell, really was quite a different writer than Jane Austen. Although many of us find it hard to believe, there are other authors out there beyond the wonderful Jane Austen!

This allows enough time to develop Elizabeth Gaskell's themes about 18th Century social and economic realities; the changes in men's and women's relationship to the land; and the impact of science and the industrial revolution on the arcane ins and outs of the English class system.  Sounds really dull!  But it also works as just a really good romance.  As usual, Gaskell's points are made using realistic, fully developed, complex characters.  This production is also wonderfully cast (the actors are good-looking even by Hollywood movie standards and great actors) and beautifully filmed.  It's a good story without any additional context, but it is gets even better with a bit of reading about the period and about Gaskell's life and philosophy.

Literary critics do not consider Mrs. Gaskell's writing to be as accomplished as Jane Austen's. Gaskell wrote &quot;best sellers&quot; during her day (19th Century approximately 50 years after Austen), but unlike her counterparts of the 19th Century - Austen, the Bronte Sisters, and George Eliot, Gaskell's books did not stand the test of time. It is a credit to Andrew Davies that he has been able to take the wide range of material he has and transform it into perfection. The BBC adaptation of WIVES AND DAUGHTERS IS PERFECTION. First, the DVD itself is clear and beautifully articulated. The sound and color are precise. This is a first class work of art comparable to adaptations of classics such as JEWEL IN THE CROWN and ROOM WITH A VIEW. Second, the lush settings, costumes, and other aspects of scenery and background are extremely realistic and accurate. This is not a tinsel-town sound stage rip-off, this is the real thing. WIVES is comparable to the Merchant-Ivory films. Third, the actors are superb. There isn't a dud in the bunch. As a BBC junkie, I am familiar with most of the actors, and was bowled over by the star power. The casting of Ian Carmichael (Lord Peter Wimsey) and Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Darby's Aunt in 'Pride and Prejudice') as Lord and Lady Cunmore is a fine example of the thought that went into choosing who should play whom. Francesca Annis is fabulous as Molly's very proper new step-mother. The Browning sisters are marvelous (Mystery fans will recognize both of them). And, last but not least, Justine Waddell is a great actress whom I must liken to the young Wendy Hiller. Waddell has one of the most expressive faces around and she plays it well. This young woman is destined to be a Dame of the British Empire. WIVES - as adapted by Davies - is tight, coherent, and flows logically (unlike Mrs. Gaskell's book). Characters behave in predictable but interesting ways. There are no &quot;bad guys&quot; or &quot;good guys&quot; everyone is very human. Even the wonderful Molly is not perfect and I for one would find her unbelievable if she were. Neither Molly's stepmother Hyacinth, nor her stepsister Cynthia are &quot;bad&quot; -- they are beautiful, charming, and self obsessed. Mrs Gaskell was clear and Davies keeps this bit in ... poverty does not make people nice. Molly is a better person because she has always had a loving father on hand to admonish her when she misbehaved whereas Cynthia was forced to fend for herself as her mother tended other people's children. Cynthia has learned some not so gentle survival techniques. I love this story because the people and the events depicted in it are based on real events. Molly is a fictional character but many of the episodes about her life are drawn from Mrs. Gaskell's own experiences and knowledge of other's lives. And, although she may not have used her as a role model, there was a young woman named Eleanor Omerod who became one of Britain's leading agricultural entemologists during the time when WIVES takes place. Eleanor began studing insects casually in 1852 when she observed an unusual locust which she wrote about in her diary. Later, she discovered a rare beetle on her father's estate in Gloucestershire which brought her to the attention of Professor C.G.B. Daubeny at Oxford. Thus she began a life long interest and career in a field few women entered. As a member of the Royal Botanical Society, Omerod was responsible for placing entemologists in Kenya and elsewhere. Fans of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE will enjoy this DVD, but it is not like Jane Austin's tales. Mrs Gaskell was not an accomplished ironist. Much of the tongue-in-cheek humor found in Austin's books is missing. However, Austen made fun of those she deemed pretentious to an excess and as a result, some of her characters are almost two-dimensional. Mrs. Gaskell's characters are developed, even those who might fall into the category of &quot;pretension&quot; in an Austin book. Mrs. Gaskell was concerned with the plight of &quot;fallen&quot; women and their redemption by nonjugmental folks.

The story is engaging, if a little long-winded for the essentially simple tale it has to tell, and the characters are all three-dimensional, finely-drawn people, not the costume drama stock characters that are often found in lesser productions.  The screenplay is well done, as is the music (by the same composer as the Horation Hornblower series, and often reminiscent of that music).  Above all, however, the cast are a joy to watch.  The older cast--Michael Gambon, Francesca Annis, Ian Carmichael, Barbara Flynn, and especially Bill Paterson--are excellent, and it is testament to the talent of the younger group that they consistently draw our attention to themselves.  Justine Wadell turns in another flawless performance, and carries the weight of the whole production in the central role of Molly Gibson.  Keeley Hawes is unexpectedly great as a flake with some deeper problems.  Anthony Howell is charismatic as Roger Hamley, and Tom Hollander is especially good as Osborne (you can also see him in a great little part in Gosford Park).

Based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of the same name, Wives and Daughters is a gorgeous costume drama of love and class that becomes more rich, suspenseful and layered with each episode. The story is centered around Molly Gibson, the lively, unaffected daughter of the town doctor, who's a widower. Their lives are turned topsy turvy when the father marries a Mrs. Bennett like widow with a daughter of her own who's just about Molly's age but as flighty as Molly is reliable. Even though the girls are a study in contrasts they love each other, and when they fall for the same man they both, in their own way, try to do the right thing--the plot is too layered to make the stepsister a villain. Mrs. Gaskell was unable to finish the novel before her death, but the miniseries conclusion is satisfyingly sigh inducing.

Due to the limitations of conversion to screen, some things were cut - such as Mollys missing Cynthias wedding due to lingering cold/flu and her resulting stay in The Towers, and a few other things.I think Mrs Gibson comes off as a bit more of a twit in the book, and Cynthia as more of a twit in the film. The film also left out the whole storyline about Rogers wranglership - which came with a stipend (or fellowship) that allowed him to finance his brothers clandestine marriage & travel, and that Rogers whole trip to Africa was a way to make money to allow his father to continue with a project to improve the property - thus improving his fathers feelings about himself as able to provide work for his tenants. There are some things that the film does which surprised me and which I thought were really good - such as Lady Cumnors speech impediment - not written into the book (in my memory) but which is entirely possible and highly amusing. I also adore the way that they dramatized Cynthias teenage outbursts, running out of rooms and door slamming - and the Miss Brownings voices and reactions.I do wish Roger wasn't quite so handsome in the film, as he was not described as such in the book. The film talks about several classes in the social hierarchy - focusing more on the classes which are seen more or less as social equals - with the words, deeds, feelings & lives of servants noticeably absent.Overall - its quite a good production and its telling a time old tale of the conflicts of teenagers with their parents over who they want to date, young men striving to make their own ways while remaining close to their fathers.",4,Faithful interpretation of a complex book,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,1736,"['production', 'tremendously', 'well', 'acted', 'fairly', 'closely', 'original', 'story', 'Due', 'limitations', 'conversion', 'screen', 'things', 'were', 'cut', 'such', 'Mollys', 'missing', 'Cynthias', 'wedding', 'due', 'lingering', 'cold/flu', 'resulting', 'stay', 'Towers', 'few', 'other', 'things.I', 'think', 'Mrs', 'Gibson', 'off', 'bit', 'more', 'twit', 'book', 'Cynthia', 'more', 'twit', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'left', 'out', 'whole', 'storyline', 'Rogers', 'wranglership', 'came', 'stipend', 'fellowship', 'allowed', 'finance', 'brothers', 'clandestine', 'marriage', 'travel', 'Rogers', 'whole', 'trip', 'Africa', 'was', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'allow', 'father', 'continue', 'project', 'improve', 'property', 'thus', 'improving', 'fathers', 'feelings', 'about', 'able', 'provide', 'work', 'tenants', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'surprised', 'thought', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'such', 'Lady', 'Cumnors', 'speech', 'impediment', 'not', 'written', 'book', 'memory', 'entirely', 'possible', 'highly', 'amusing', 'also', 'adore', 'way', 'dramatized', 'Cynthias', 'teenage', 'outbursts', 'running', 'rooms', 'door', 'slamming', 'Miss', 'Brownings', 'voices', 'reactions.I', 'do', 'wish', 'Roger', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'handsome', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'described', 'such', 'book', 'film', 'talks', 'several', 'classes', 'social', 'hierarchy', 'focusing', 'more', 'classes', 'are', 'seen', 'more', 'social', 'equals', 'words', 'deeds', 'feelings', 'lives', 'servants', 'noticeably', 'good', 'production', 'telling', 'time', 'old', 'tale', 'conflicts', 'teenagers', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'date', 'young', 'men', 'striving', 'make', 'own', 'ways', 'remaining', 'close', 'fathers']",Wives and Daughters

As someone put it in a review of ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", ""BBC is a dab hand at period dramas."" They certainly are. This drama is based on a book by Elizabeth Gaskell, a contemporary of Charlotte Bronte and CharlesDickens. Her characters generally are more middle class rather than landed gentry and this story is no different; we follow the coming-of-age of Molly Gibson, who is the daughter of a physician. Molly's honesty and simplicity are in contrast to that of her new stepmother, Hyacinthe, who is a nasty piece of work cloaked in genteel words and acts that mask a viperish selfish nature and cruelty. Her daughter promises to be a carbon copy of her nature but lo, she is as put upon by her mother as Molly is. The two become friends.The story has characters of contrast; the good Molly and Cynthia, the feckless Osborne, the mean Hyacinthe and Mr. Preston. There are plenty of scandalous secrets. Mrs Gaskell did not finish this novel before her death, but it's been admirably adapted with hints from Gaskell's notes by Andrew Davies, screenwriter.

She was still writing the book in 1865 when she died unexpectedly at the age of 55.  The last few pages of the story were completed from her notes.In this miniseries the protagonist, Molly Gibson, is played by Justine Waddell who we also see in The Woman in White, based on the Victorian novel by Wilkie Collins.  Molly was living a pleasant and simply life with her widowed father (Bill Paterson), the area doctor, until he decides to remarry.  The new wife brings her daughter into the marriage and thus begins the heart of the story.Wives and Daughters is set in the early Victorian period.  Some have criticized this production as slow and stiff but I believe it compares well with the 1996 BBC/A&E; version of Pride and Prejudice and surpasses the 1985 BBC version.  Even a good modern book is difficult to adapt to a movie.  Victorian literature, written for a slower period and for people who had the leisure to read, took time to develop plots and characters.  This four episode, 375 minute, miniseries takes that time.  Also, we must remember that this is not a miniseries about the Victorian era, it is a largely faithful adaptation of a Victorian novel.  Elizabeth Gaskell was Victorian and she was writing about Victorians.  These people were more reserved, at least in public, than we are today.The novel leaves much of the future unresolved.  Today we would say there is ample room for a sequel.  However, the miniseries ends the story in the style of Jane Austen.  Having said that I will conclude with, if you like adaptations of Jane Austen novels you should enjoy Wives and Daughters.This is an excellent adaptation of Gaskell's novel.

Cynthia and Molly become fast friends, while Molly barely tolerates her nigh intolerable step-mother.The series really revolves around Molly's relationships with all the characters in the production and her handling of the various everyday situations in which she finds herself. Richly drawn, memorable characters, as well as intrigues, secrets, and romance, make this a highly absorbing drama and one that those who love period pieces and lush, well acted costume dramas will enjoy. It is simply a masterpiece.With stunningly crisp visuals and beautiful clarity of sound, the production value of this three disc, five hour DVD is simply first rate. It is also value laden with some very interesting features. There is an engaging fifty five minute portrait of Elizabeth Gaskell, the author of the novel upon which this mini-series is based. There is a also a twenty minute documentary on the making of the film which is entertaining, as it gives a bird's eye view of the thought that went into the making of the film and the development of the characters. There is also a who's who guide to the performers. This DVD is well worth having in one's collection.",5,A MASTERPIECE...BRAVO!,1009756800,"12 31, 2001",2001,2079,"['superlative', 'period', 'piece', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', '1865', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'superb', 'costume', 'drama', 'stellar', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Set', 'rural', 'England', 'film', 'centers', 'Molly', 'Gibson', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'country', 'doctor', 'Richly', 'drawn', 'portraits', 'Molly', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'quickly', 'emerge', 'weave', 'absorbing', 'tapestry', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'life.Molly', 'father', 'widower', 'most', 'Molly', 'life', 'have', 'exceptionally', 'close', 'loving', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'marry', 'widow', 'former', 'governess', 'Hyacinth', 'who', 'pretentious', 'self', 'absorbed', 'ridiculous', 'woman', 'grown', 'daughter', 'named', 'Cynthia', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'close', 'Molly', 'age', 'different', 'Molly', 'night', 'day', 'Cynthia', 'best', 'described', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Victorian', 'age', 'Cynthia', 'Molly', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'Molly', 'barely', 'nigh', 'intolerable', 'step-mother.The', 'series', 'really', 'around', 'Molly', 'relationships', 'characters', 'production', 'handling', 'various', 'everyday', 'situations', 'Richly', 'drawn', 'memorable', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'intrigues', 'secrets', 'romance', 'make', 'highly', 'absorbing', 'drama', 'one', 'who', 'love', 'period', 'pieces', 'lush', 'well', 'acted', 'costume', 'dramas', 'will', 'enjoy', 'simply', 'masterpiece.With', 'stunningly', 'crisp', 'visuals', 'beautiful', 'clarity', 'sound', 'production', 'value', 'three', 'disc', 'five', 'hour', 'DVD', 'simply', 'first', 'rate', 'also', 'value', 'laden', 'very', 'interesting', 'features', 'engaging', 'fifty', 'five', 'minute', 'portrait', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'author', 'novel', 'mini-series', 'based', 'also', 'twenty', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'entertaining', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'thought', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'development', 'characters', 'also', 'who', 'who', 'guide', 'performers', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'one', 'collection']",Wives and Daughters

Although it is not as stunning and breathtakingly dramatic as North & South - of course the topics handled are very different -, it is a masterpiece of its own right with wonderful cast& crew.Jusitne Waddel (Molly) and Bill Patterson (dr Gibson)play daughter and father very convincingly: you can feel their down-to-earth, but strong and heart-warming affection for each other. Nothing superficial or pretentious. Francesca Annis (Clare Gibson) and Keely Hawes (her daughter, Cynthia) are perfectly suited as mother and daughter: you can grasp the physical and characteristic similarities. One of the most annoying and at the same time most delightful scenes is when Mr Gibson gives a piece of her mind to Cynthia for putting Molly's good reputation at stake and both Cynthia and Mrs Gibson are crying, feeling they've been sadly abused & misunderstood while Molly - the only person having ground to feel injured - is standing there patiently, not saying a word. Their carelessness and selfishness is featured wonderfully in that scene.Justine Waddel was a fresh and lively Molly. Keely Hawes was a wondeful Cynthia: you couldn't help liking and disliking her at the same time. Iain Glen's acting was also very good: he was good-looking, but repulsive at the same time.

Molly is the happy, though motherless, daughter of the village doctor, and she and he enjoy an idyllic family life, toasting cheese by the fireside when he returns home late from his calls. However, sometimes we try to fix what ain't broke. Thus the father determines that his girl ought to have a mother again, and so he marries a widowed governess with a half-grown daughter of her own away at school. Hyacinth, the governess cum stepmother, is a vain selfish woman who is behaving in a haughty fashion now that she finally has a home of her own and a better social standing than that of a hated governess. Molly tries to make the best of a very trying circumstance. Relief comes in the form of her new stepsister Cynthia, who is bubbly and flirtatious. The two girls pledge friendship and have a genuine affection for each other. The problem though--and it's a big one--is that the local squire's second son, the one with whom Molly is smitten, is quite bowled over by the beauty of Cynthia, and Molly recedes into the &quot;just friends&quot; category. Like a Jane Austen novel, seems like a hopeless business, no? Ah, but the same magic will be at work here, to demonstrate how hopeless situations can be resolved to just about everyone's satisfaction.The acting and scenery are first rate, and although I believed there would be a happy ending, I was darned if I could figure out how they were going to get there. In the tradition of Austen and Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell weaves a splendid tale of a long-suffering heroine who is finally vindicated in every way.

Andrew Davies is hitting on all cylinders here once again and the cast is uniformly fantastic, but it is Justine Waddell that puts it over the top.  P&P is funnier and cleverer and slightly more polished, but W&D is richer and deeper.  A lot of this is due to Gaskell v. Austen, of course.  Waddell as Molly is so perfect a fit that a viewer is often left breathless at the sympathy created by the character and by the actress.  Waddell is such a mixture of ethereal beauty and homespun Scottish girl in this role that it is almost impossible not to fall in love with her.  She is so charming that it is quite possible to forget that her sister is supposed to be the greater beauty (although the directors somehow convince us of this at the proper times and in the proper ways).  The character of Molly's stepmother is also acted with astonishing precision and imagination.  The role is brought to life in many ways that exceed the book, which is the highest praise an actress can achieve, I think.

Each woman had her own voice, and their stories are different, but equally satisfying. This production is visually beautiful and the acting is superb.  The first time I watched it, nothing much seemed to be happening, until it was over. Life is like that I suppose; it happens while you're looking somewhere else.  I can not praise this enough. It is just beautiful, and resonates on many levels.  The producer and screenwriter are the ones who gave us the delicious Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  The humor in this story is more subtle and sometimes unexpected, so it hits you harder.  Gaskell's people are more human and more lovable than Austen's, who are more like sketches and caricatures.  These seem more like real people.  I love this more each time I see it.  Much as I adore Austen, I would have worried about what she thought of me.

And the cast surrounding her is full of memorable character actors, including MICHAEL GAMBON who almost steal the show single-handedly with his gruff interpretation of the frustrated country squire, and BILL PATERSON as Molly's wise and sympathetic father.FRANCESCA ANNIS is a revelation as the giddy step-mother from hell, anxious to see her vain and shallow daughter (KEELEY HAWES) married to a man of wealth and position no matter what the circumstances are. But the flaw in the cast comes with Miss Hawes, who is seriously in need of dubbing to make her dialog clear to American viewers. She drops her voice mid-sentence in many a scene, barely above a whisper, and her enunciation is enough to drive Professor Higgins to distraction. No subtitles on the DVD I purchased.She is the only element in the large cast that is worthy of any criticism. IAIN GLEN makes an impression as Mr. Preston, the mysterious figure in the story whose attraction to the shallow Cynthia (KEELEY HAWES) is hard to understand given that Justine Waddell is so enchanting as the ""plain"" heroine.Wonderfully produced in the best British tradition and based on the book by Elizabeth Gaskell, it's visually striking and set against backgrounds and settings that perfectly capture the period atmosphere.

Good production, acting (if sometimes flowery,) and story that has firm morals to boost it. Look at it carefully, and you will notice that this is essentially a story about women. The love story that comes with it plays second fiddle. Young people will do well to learn a thing or two from Molly Gibson, and from the other ladies as well. Overall, a winner that can never pale to BBC's other production, ""Pride and Prejudice.""Michael Gambon (the new Hogwarts headmaster) is a pleasure to watch. During a deathbed scene, you can see him drool in grief and understand why he garnered a Best Actor Award from BAFTA. Justine Waddell is perfect and beautiful for the leading role of virtuous Molly. Keeley Hawes (whom you can also see in BBC's nice rendition of Dickens' ""Our Mutual Friend"") is also good as the tortured stepsister that must escape from her past when it came looking for her. Francesca Annis is simply superb. Penelope Wilton (of ""Calendar Girls"") has a short role as Mrs. Hamley whose character departed all too early.Some of the sceneries of the English countryside are quite breath-taking; makes one want to take a hike through the forests. This production is never poor in color. And, who can let that original music by John Keane pass by??!! One of the things I love about this DVD is that it has a special 30-minute section devoted just for Mr. Keane&iexcl; music. It is very good, no kidding.I understand that this was originally an unfinished (almost-finished) novel by Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell.

This is where the rich, the poor and the middle class all merge together and form a wonderful mix of love, and struggles with mixed up people and their affections. Once again, the old familiar theme of a vituous man (Roger) and a very vituous and good young girl (Molly), are obviously meant for each other, but do not discover it till late in the story.

Even the very rich and elite of the village, come to the aid of Miss Molly and in a round about way, help Roger further his career.

Made by the same winning team who brought us 1995's Pride and Prejudice, the temptation to compare the two series was too great to resist...And that is where I think I went wrong.  While there was definitely a familiar &quot;feel&quot; to this mini-series in that the costumes and dialogue were fairly reminiscent of P&amp;P, the story was completely different--not that that's a bad thing.  However, at the end of the day, I simply felt the Wives &amp; Daughers storyline was less riveting and, ultimately, less interesting, than P&amp;P.  Of course, the fact that I consider P&amp;P to be the best movie/mini-series of all time may have unfairly prejudiced me against Wives and Daughters, but I started out with very good intentions.  I really did want to love this movie as much as I love P&amp;P!The story centers around Molly Gibson, a young lady whose widower father decides to remarry when Molly is 17 so that she will have a mother.  Unfortunatley, his choice of bride is a rather silly woman for whom one feels as much sympathy as Mrs. Bennet of P&amp;P.  The stepmother has a daughter who, like her mother, is incredibly self-absorbed, but, unlike her mother, also at least TRIES to be a good person.  The two stepsisters, although completely different, actually care very much for each other, and this was nice to watch.  Of course, there's a male romantic interest, but he spends so much time off-camera that I didn't develop any particular attachment to him.  Accordingly, when he comes back after a long absence pining after Molly (after first pining for someone else because she's prettier), I felt very little compassion for him.  All in all, the story really is about Molly and how she handles the various situations in her life.  She's the only person you really care about (well, she and Osborne Hamley, but only because his life is so tragic).  And although that's nice, I don't think it warranted five hours.  For five hours, I was hoping to develop more attachment to more characters.  I was hoping that it would center more around the interactions and dynamics between various characters, rather than simply be &quot;the world of Molly Gibson.&quot;In sum, it is fine entertainment, and something I enjoyed watching, but it is no P&amp;P.  I think if I hadn't read all these comparisons between the two series, I would've enjoyed Wives &amp; Daughters more.  As it is, though, I found it enjoyable, but not amazing. That said, I did find it compelling enough to watch all five hours in one sitting...So while I definitely recommend watching this, I recommend even more that you resist the temptation to compare this to P&amp;P.  This will save inevitable disappointment if you, like me, loved P&amp;P and are looking for another period piece to love just as much.",4,"It's no P&amp;P, but pretty fine entertainment in its own right",997574400,"08 12, 2001",2001,2890,"['bought', 'dvd', 'based', 'solely', 'rave', 'amazon', 'reviews', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Made', 'same', 'winning', 'team', 'who', 'brought', '1995', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'temptation', 'compare', 'two', 'series', 'was', 'too', 'great', 'resist', 'where', 'think', 'went', 'wrong', 'was', 'definitely', 'familiar', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', 'mini-series', 'costumes', 'dialogue', 'were', 'fairly', 'reminiscent', 'P', 'amp', 'P', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'However', 'end', 'day', 'simply', 'felt', 'Wives', 'amp', 'Daughers', 'storyline', 'was', 'less', 'riveting', 'ultimately', 'less', 'interesting', 'P', 'amp', 'P.', 'course', 'fact', 'consider', 'P', 'amp', 'P', 'be', 'best', 'movie/mini-series', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'unfairly', 'prejudiced', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'started', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'intentions', 'really', 'did', 'want', 'love', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'P', 'amp', 'P', 'story', 'centers', 'Molly', 'Gibson', 'young', 'lady', 'widower', 'father', 'remarry', 'when', 'Molly', '17', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'mother', 'Unfortunatley', 'choice', 'bride', 'rather', 'silly', 'woman', 'whom', 'one', 'much', 'sympathy', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'P', 'amp', 'P.', 'stepmother', 'daughter', 'who', 'mother', 'incredibly', 'self-absorbed', 'mother', 'also', 'least', 'TRIES', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'two', 'stepsisters', 'completely', 'different', 'actually', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'was', 'nice', 'watch', 'course', 'male', 'romantic', 'interest', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'off-camera', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'particular', 'attachment', 'Accordingly', 'when', 'back', 'long', 'absence', 'pining', 'Molly', 'first', 'pining', 'someone', 'else', 'prettier', 'felt', 'very', 'little', 'compassion', 'story', 'really', 'Molly', 'how', 'various', 'situations', 'life', 'only', 'person', 'really', 'care', 'well', 'Osborne', 'Hamley', 'only', 'life', 'so', 'tragic', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'warranted', 'five', 'hours', 'five', 'hours', 'was', 'hoping', 'develop', 'more', 'attachment', 'more', 'characters', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'center', 'more', 'interactions', 'dynamics', 'various', 'characters', 'rather', 'simply', 'be', 'quot', 'world', 'Molly', 'Gibson.', 'quot', 'sum', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'something', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'P', 'amp', 'P.', 'think', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'comparisons', 'two', 'series', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Wives', 'amp', 'Daughters', 'more', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'amazing', 'said', 'did', 'find', 'compelling', 'enough', 'watch', 'five', 'hours', 'one', 'sitting', 'So', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', 'recommend', 'even', 'more', 'resist', 'temptation', 'compare', 'P', 'amp', 'P.', 'will', 'save', 'inevitable', 'disappointment', 'loved', 'P', 'amp', 'P', 'are', 'looking', 'period', 'piece', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much']",Wives and Daughters

Molly finds herself chafing under the Victorian strictures imposed by her stepmother, and finds some relief with the arrival of her glamorous step-sister, Cynthia [Keeley Hawes]. Both Molly and Cynthia form a friendship though their personalities are polar opposites. Cynthia is vivacious and a social butterfly, and very aware of her charms and effects on the opposite sex whereas Molly is unassuming and possesses a more natural sort of beauty.The Hamley brothers, Osborne[Tom Hollander] and Roger [Anthony Howell] add romantic interest and Molly is dismayed by Roger's infatuation with Cynthia, as she herself harbors romantic feelings for him. Meanwhile Squire Hamley [Michael Gambon] plays an ambitious man who wishes to see his sons married into the 'right' family, i.e. with proper connections and wealth. The rest of the story deals with what happens to these young people with some revelations to spice things up!This is one of my favorite BBC period dramas and Andrew Davies' screenplay is fantastic, bringing to life the intricacies of human relationships during Victorian times.
