1435179,A367A53PGB7RH8,B00508W3M0,Chazermann26,"[0, 0]",Here is a movie that's fun to watch based on actions during civil war that really bears little toward the history of that war? But for entertainment it's a great comedy with great acting by a hollywood legend! Glenn Ford provides the acting the script is so so but all in all not a bad movie! Amazon provides me the ability to continue my hobby that of collecting great movies at a reasonable price!Sandy Manson,5,Advance to the rear Glenn Ford,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,411,"['Here', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'based', 'actions', 'civil', 'war', 'really', 'little', 'history', 'war', 'entertainment', 'great', 'comedy', 'great', 'acting', 'hollywood', 'legend', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'acting', 'script', 'so', 'so', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'ability', 'continue', 'hobby', 'collecting', 'great', 'movies', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Sandy', 'Manson']",Advance To The Rear

Not very surprisingly, I loved the movie, too.  With a cast that included Glenn Ford,  Joan Blondell, and all the other talented actors, how could you go wrong?  The plot was good, and didn't  cause the old I've-seen-this-before feeling that a lot of comedies do.  Enjoyed every minute of it.  My only quibble with it (and the reason it didn't get five stars)  is that for some inexplicable reason it was filmed in black-and-white.  It would have been fantastic in color.  But don't let that stop you from seeing it---I just ordered a copy anyway, and will be watching it again.",4,Cute and funny!,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,700,"['Actually', 'heard', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'TODAY', 'New', 'Christy', 'Minstrels', 'quite', 'while', 'ever', 'saw', 'movie', 'Not', 'very', 'surprisingly', 'loved', 'movie', 'too', 'cast', 'included', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'other', 'talented', 'actors', 'how', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'cause', 'old', ""I've-seen-this-before"", 'feeling', 'lot', 'comedies', 'do', 'Enjoyed', 'minute', 'My', 'only', 'quibble', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'was', 'filmed', 'black-and-white', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'color', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing', '-I', 'just', 'ordered', 'copy', 'anyway', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again']",Advance To The Rear
