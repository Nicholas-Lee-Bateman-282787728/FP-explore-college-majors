761621,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B0000A2ZU9,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 3]","If you saw the episode of the Muppet Show where John Denver was the guest, you know he was trying to get the muppets to go on a camping trip with him, but it was not to be. (Well, at least until some years later.) It is virtually impossible to not see this special as a sequel to that episode. John Denver and the muppets go to the Colorado mountains. Overall, there is a good combination of story and music. John and the muppets begin their walk to the campgrounds; Fozzie has some typical mishaps. (But nothing too dangerous.) Statler and Waldorph are present to provide some heckling. John and Floyd go fishing. There is one sad moment in how John asks Robin to do something he is too short to do. (Setting up the clothes line.) John for a moment gets frustrated, but of course, they reconcile, and Robin is able to tie the clothes line if  John can hold him high enough. This is one of the few Muppet gatherings that does not include Miss Piggy. But in her absence, there is a comical flashback of her trying to bring her photographers, flatterers, and hair dressers on a previous camping trip. (If you saw the episode with John Denver, then you will recall she was planning to go camping in a high fashion outfit, and a gold plated backpack.) The story is charming enough, and of course John Denver's songs are in their element with the background of the wilderness. To top of this gathering, there is a climactic (but still hilarious) moment when John tells the story of a man eating chicken who might be roaming the area. Some of the muppets begin to fear that the story is true. This does of course sound silly. And even John (the story teller) tries to explain that it was just a story. But Gonzo finds some evidence that would suggest the story is true. Overall, this is a good story that has comedy, a touch of drama, nice scenery, some of John Denver's great acting and musical skills, and just the right touch of suspense. If you liked the episode of the Muppets with John Denver as the guest star, you will not want to miss this special.",3,Better A Few Years Later Than Never.,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2051,"['saw', 'episode', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'where', 'John', 'Denver', 'was', 'guest', 'know', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'muppets', 'go', 'camping', 'trip', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Well', 'least', 'years', 'later', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'not', 'see', 'special', 'sequel', 'episode', 'John', 'Denver', 'muppets', 'go', 'Colorado', 'mountains', 'Overall', 'good', 'combination', 'story', 'music', 'John', 'muppets', 'begin', 'walk', 'campgrounds', 'Fozzie', 'typical', 'mishaps', 'nothing', 'too', 'dangerous', 'Statler', 'Waldorph', 'are', 'present', 'provide', 'heckling', 'John', 'Floyd', 'go', 'fishing', 'one', 'sad', 'moment', 'how', 'John', 'Robin', 'do', 'something', 'too', 'short', 'do', 'Setting', 'up', 'clothes', 'line', 'John', 'moment', 'frustrated', 'course', 'reconcile', 'Robin', 'able', 'tie', 'clothes', 'line', 'John', 'can', 'hold', 'high', 'enough', 'one', 'few', 'Muppet', 'gatherings', 'not', 'include', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'absence', 'comical', 'flashback', 'trying', 'bring', 'photographers', 'flatterers', 'hair', 'dressers', 'previous', 'camping', 'trip', 'saw', 'episode', 'John', 'Denver', 'then', 'will', 'recall', 'was', 'planning', 'go', 'camping', 'high', 'fashion', 'outfit', 'gold', 'plated', 'backpack', 'story', 'charming', 'enough', 'course', 'John', 'Denver', 'songs', 'are', 'element', 'background', 'wilderness', 'top', 'gathering', 'climactic', 'still', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'when', 'John', 'story', 'man', 'eating', 'chicken', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'roaming', 'area', 'muppets', 'begin', 'fear', 'story', 'true', 'course', 'sound', 'silly', 'even', 'John', 'story', 'teller', 'explain', 'was', 'just', 'story', 'Gonzo', 'evidence', 'would', 'suggest', 'story', 'true', 'Overall', 'good', 'story', 'comedy', 'touch', 'drama', 'nice', 'scenery', 'John', 'Denver', 'great', 'acting', 'musical', 'skills', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'suspense', 'liked', 'episode', 'Muppets', 'John', 'Denver', 'guest', 'star', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'special']",John Denver and the Muppets - Rocky Mountain Holiday

While Miss Piggy only shows up in a cameo, the rest of the core gang is here...including Kermit's nephew Robin. It's a mix of campfire classics and some wonderful John Denver songs.

761626,A3TLY2LWGRULDQ,B0000A2ZU9,Karen K. Hart,"[3, 5]","I've loved this movie since I was a little kid and was thrilled to get it on DVD, since our old taped copy wasn't in the greatest condition and was missing some portions.  The special effects aren't that amazing--Fozzie is attacked, at one point, by ""wasps"" that look like drawn-on yellow blobs, and some of the backgrounds look pretty disconnected from the action--but some of the little details are fantastic!  The trees, the lake, and Robin's movement are examples of the implementation of impressive forethought.Rocky Mountain Holiday is not nearly as cheesy as the John Denver & the Muppets Christmas movie, and there's so much to love about it.  Highlights include a Ford truck, a giant maneating chicken, a disgustingly pink Jeep for Miss Piggy to ride in, hilarious jokes, a cozy campfire scene, lovely scenery, enjoyable songs (some of them John's, others not), and the opportunity to see the familiar Muppet characters in flannel and down.  John is completely natural with the Muppets--he doesn't seem to be one of those people who's uncomfortable around puppets.I am kind of disappointed that the scene where John took Rowlf up in a plane to cure his hiccups was removed.  Still, it wasn't my favorite part of the movie, and we still have our old copy, so I guess it's not that big a deal to me.  Plus, after watching that bit again, I guess I can see why it was taken out.  Rowlf mentions ""Amelia Airedale,"" and his fear of flying just isn't as funny given the way John died.The DVD presentation is simple but effective.

761628,A3FWZ99GUDAJ3L,B0000A2ZU9,"sillygirl412 ""sillygirl412""","[38, 38]","John Denver and Jim Henson were good friends in real life and teamed up on several occasions (Muppet Show episode, John Denver and the Muppets Christmas Special, and Rocky Mtn. Holiday) to produce some good old fashioned family entertainment.  In fact, according to Jim Henson's son, Brian, the story line for this movie stemmed from the episode of the Muppet Show that starred John Denver, in which he spends the entire show trying to convince the gang to go camping with him (note: this is according to the bonus features on the John Denver episode of the Muppet Show on DVD).Rocky Mtn. Holiday contains the typical Muppet one-liners (John: &quot;The mosquitos aren't bad&quot;, Kermit: &quot;Aren't bad?!  They're delicious!&quot;) and Muppetisms (Fozzie, claiming to speak 'Bearish' had a miscommunication problem with a wild bear thanks to dialect issues - she speaks Grizzlie, he speaks Paddington!) that make Muppet productions enjoyable.  Although this movie was produced in 1982, it is timeless thanks to the natural beauty of the scenery and the ageless Muppets themselves.For a tv movie that was produced in the early 80's, I am rather impressed with it's transfer to DVD.  There are no special features, unless you count trailers for other Muppet movies or scene selection capabilities, BUT... the color is bright and the sound is well balanced.  At a mere 47 minutes (thanks to tasteful selective editing out of the Rowlf / John flying scene), I am not sure this qualifies as a &quot;movie&quot; exactly, but it is a worthwhile purchase nonetheless, if only for nostalgia reasons.  And, for those of you patiently (or impatiently?) waiting for the JD &amp; Muppets Christmas to come out on DVD, you'll be pleased to know that the song &quot;It's In Every One of Us&quot; is also in THIS movie.Enjoy!",4,a little known Muppet &quot;movie&quot; deserving of attention,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,1812,"['John', 'Denver', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'were', 'good', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'teamed', 'up', 'several', 'occasions', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'episode', 'John', 'Denver', 'Muppets', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'Rocky', 'Mtn', 'Holiday', 'produce', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'family', 'entertainment', 'fact', 'according', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'son', 'Brian', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'stemmed', 'episode', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'starred', 'John', 'Denver', 'entire', 'show', 'trying', 'convince', 'gang', 'go', 'camping', 'note', 'according', 'bonus', 'John', 'Denver', 'episode', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'DVD', '.Rocky', 'Mtn', 'Holiday', 'typical', 'Muppet', 'one-liners', 'John', 'quot', 'mosquitos', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'quot', 'Kermit', 'quot', 'Are', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'re"", 'delicious', 'quot', 'Muppetisms', 'Fozzie', 'claiming', 'speak', ""'Bearish"", 'had', 'miscommunication', 'problem', 'wild', 'bear', 'thanks', 'dialect', 'issues', 'Grizzlie', 'Paddington', 'make', 'Muppet', 'productions', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', '1982', 'timeless', 'thanks', 'natural', 'beauty', 'scenery', 'ageless', 'Muppets', 'themselves.For', 'tv', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'early', '80', 'am', 'rather', 'impressed', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'count', 'trailers', 'other', 'Muppet', 'movies', 'scene', 'selection', 'capabilities', 'BUT', 'color', 'bright', 'sound', 'well', 'balanced', 'mere', '47', 'minutes', 'thanks', 'tasteful', 'selective', 'editing', 'Rowlf', '/', 'John', 'flying', 'scene', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'exactly', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'nonetheless', 'only', 'nostalgia', 'reasons', 'patiently', 'impatiently', 'waiting', 'JD', 'amp', 'Muppets', 'Christmas', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'song', 'quot', 'Every', 'One', 'Us', 'quot', 'also', 'THIS', 'movie.Enjoy']",John Denver and the Muppets - Rocky Mountain Holiday
