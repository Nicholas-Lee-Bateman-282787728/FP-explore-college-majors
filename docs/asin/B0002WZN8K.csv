Some big changes in season 8, Monica and Chandler are married and Rachel is pregnant! But who's the father of her baby? It's Ross of course and halfway through the season lovable but fickle Joey starts to have feelings for Rachel. I don't think that was a good idea for the show, Joey and Rachel have no chemistry whatsoever. Jennifer Aniston won an Emmy for this season, she deserved it!

So I bought anyway because I love Friends that much. Boy, were people right. Its not that Season 7 ""sucked"", but 98% of the material just wasnt funny. Granted the cast did the best they could with what they were given, I was pretty disappointed with the season.But in came Season 8! Right off the bat with the first episode gives us the witty ""Friends"" that we all know and love.

I'll stop talking about the wedding and get on to Rachel's big news as the cast gears up for the eighth season.Picking up at Monica and Chandler's reception, where they take pictures with Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey, Monica tries to figure out how a pregnancy test turned up in her bathroom. Phoebe tries to explain why she thought that. Phoebe then says, ""...If you are not the one who's pregnant, then...it's because I am"". She was about to ask who is the one, but Rachel looks at Phoebe with a concerned look. Knowing it is Rachel, Phoebe quickly covers for Rachel. She claims that actor James Brolin is the father, but James is married to Barbra Streisand. Phoebe tells Monica that she was pregnant, so she wouldn't still her thunder on her wedding day. At the reception hall, Ross meets Mona, a friend of Monica's. Ross changes his table, to Mona's table, #6. But Ross read it upside down. Mona is sitting at tabel 9. Ross is stuck at the kiddie table. Monica sits down next to Rachel and talks about Phoebe being pregnant. She points out that it should be difficult, with Phoebe being single. Rachel starts worrying about those expectations. She takes a glass of champaign and begins to sip it, but before she swallows, she spits the champaign back into the glass. Monica wonders what that was about and learns that Rachel is really the one who is pregnant. Monica tells Phoebe that she knows the real deal. But Phoebe points out that it could have been a false positive, so she runs out and buys a pregnancy test. She takes the test and Phoebe looks at the result, for Rachel is nervous. Phoebe reveals that it's positive. Rachel starts to cry, upset, for she was going to keep the baby. But Phoebe only wanted to see how Rachel actually felt, where she told Rachel that the test is positive. Rachel definitely decides on keeping the baby. But still will not reveal the father's identity. Ross is dragged back up to his hotel room in pain, for everytime he tried to dance with Mona, the girls from the kiddie table danced with Ross, standing on his feet.The next day, Joey finds out about it and offers to marry Rachel, but Rachel refuses, for she'll be fine. She wants to tell the father, but can't, for she is nervous of his reaction. Joey comes in with a red sweater he found in his apartment. The sweater was worn by the father. Ross comes in for a few minutes and leaves, but stops when he finds his ""red sweater"" on the table. Shockingly, Ross is the father of Rachel's child. At first, he is mortified, but he calms down in knowing that this will be great, for the baby is also Rachel's. During the pregnancy, Joey is always around when the exciting things happen like the baby kicking. Ross desperately wants to be around more. Rachel knows what he means and decides to move in with Ross. Monica and Phoebe throw Rachel a baby shower, but unintentionally had forgotton to invite Rachel's mother. At the last minute, Monica calls Rachel's mother and invites her. She apologizes deeply for forgetting to invite her, but Mrs. Green will not accept her apology. During the shower, Rachel opens up her presents. She pulls out a breast pump and mistakes it for a beer dispenser for babies. She has no idea that babies go in their diapers at least ten times a day. She has no idea that leaving a baby alone just to throw a diaper in the garbage bin downstairs is dangerous. Rachel accepts her mother's offer to move in with her and Ross during Rachel's five month maternity leave. But Ross reveals that there is no need for her mother, since he knew what he was doing with Ben when Ben was a baby. Monica immediately snaps out on Mrs. Green for being a b*tch.Rachel finally goes into labor, after being overdue for a week. The labor is taking an awfully long time. Three woman had gone into Rachel's room, sharing it, while waiting. Those three women then left when it was time. The fourth woman is none other than...Janice. Janice is in labor with her second child, but her first with her second husband. While waiting, Monica and Chandler try to conveive in the hospital. They find an empty room next door to Rachel. While beginning to conceive, they hear Janice next door. Janice becomes the fourth woman to have her baby before Rachel. Rachel is finally ready to deliver. The reason for the long labor is that the baby was breech. Rachel gave birth to a baby girl, who she named Emma. Joey finds a ring in Ross' pocket. Thinking he is proposing, Rachel accepts. But Joey has not proposed, but Rachel thinks he did.This is definitely the most joyous season out them all. Buy the complete eighth season and watch how their lives change again, as Rachel gives birth to Ross' second child.

848367,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0002WZN8K,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 1]","The 8th season of Friends really turns the corner from stand-alone stories that anyone flipping channels would likely enjoy, to depending more on continuing storylines and depending on the core audience's investment in the characters.  In other words, the emotional payoffs rely on the audience caring about the characters and being invested in their lives.  I'm not saying that it's bad or good, but the last few seasons of Friends are more like a comedic soap opera rather than a sitcom.  Fortunately for this season, there are many very funny moments and shows.  Unfortunately for the viewer of this DVD, they are clustered near the beginning of the season.  I'd say that the shows at the end don't hold up as well, because they have fewer jokes and more emotion, which was very effective (for me) on first viewing, but are not as quotable/interesting on repeated viewings with fewer stand-alone jokes.Having said that, this season includes my single favourite episode: The One with the Videotape, where it's revealed that Ross accidentally taped the night where Rachel got pregnant.  There are also two of the greatest one-off guest-star performances: Brad Pitt as a high school friend of Ross (and co-founder of the ""I Hate Rachel Green"" club), and Sean Penn as Phoebe's potential future brother-in-law.  The former is flat-out slapstick, the latter is touchingly sweet, but both are definite highlights of the season (and, in fact, of the whole series).There are few extras - a couple commentaries and the usual Gunther-hosted promo for an upcoming season, but collectors of the Friends series already know this (none of these discs have a lot of extras).  The price that Amazon is offering these discs for is very low, and the number of laughs to be had in this season far exceeds the sticker price.",3,The One With Rachel's Pregnancy,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,1806,"['8th', 'season', 'Friends', 'really', 'corner', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'anyone', 'flipping', 'channels', 'would', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'depending', 'more', 'continuing', 'storylines', 'depending', 'core', 'audience', 'investment', 'characters', 'other', 'words', 'emotional', 'payoffs', 'rely', 'audience', 'caring', 'characters', 'being', 'invested', 'lives', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'good', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'are', 'more', 'comedic', 'soap', 'opera', 'rather', 'sitcom', 'Fortunately', 'season', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'shows', 'Unfortunately', 'viewer', 'DVD', 'are', 'clustered', 'beginning', 'season', ""'d"", 'say', 'shows', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'fewer', 'jokes', 'more', 'emotion', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'first', 'viewing', 'are', 'not', 'quotable/interesting', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'fewer', 'stand-alone', 'jokes.Having', 'said', 'season', 'single', 'favourite', 'episode', 'One', 'Videotape', 'where', 'revealed', 'Ross', 'accidentally', 'taped', 'night', 'where', 'Rachel', 'got', 'pregnant', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'greatest', 'one-off', 'guest-star', 'performances', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Ross', 'co-founder', 'Hate', 'Rachel', 'Green', 'club', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Phoebe', 'potential', 'future', 'brother-in-law', 'former', 'flat-out', 'slapstick', 'latter', 'touchingly', 'sweet', 'are', 'definite', 'highlights', 'season', 'fact', 'whole', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'usual', 'Gunther-hosted', 'promo', 'upcoming', 'season', 'collectors', 'Friends', 'series', 'already', 'know', 'none', 'discs', 'have', 'lot', 'extras', 'price', 'Amazon', 'offering', 'discs', 'very', 'low', 'number', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'season', 'far', 'sticker', 'price']",N/A

Season 8 showed a natural and very realistic progression in the lives of Monica, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe.  Episodes 171-194 covered the first year of Monica and Chandler's married life together, Rachel finding out she was pregnant with Ross's baby, Joey showing some maturity as he deals with his deepening feelings for Rachel, and Phoebe still trying to find her true love (boyfriends included guest stars Sean Penn and Alec Baldwin).We had watched our ""Friends"" transition from their 20's into their 30's and came to know and love them even more in Season 8.  We could sense the end was coming though--we thought it would be Season 9 but were treated to an additional (although shortened) Season 10.Season 8 wasn't all just growing up and getting serious though.  Hysterical highlights from this year included Rachel crying out ""I don't see it!"" when trying to spot her baby on the sonogram, Chandler's claw hand after playing Ms. Pac-Man for hours, finding out Monica's secret - her closest full of junk in her otherwise obsessively-clean apartment, and Chandler discovering the joys of a scented bubble bath.Seasons 5, 6, and 7 were released just a few months apart from each other, and I was hoping Warner Bros. would continue on the fast-track with seasons 8, 9, and 10 so I could finally complete my collection.  It's been an agonizing summer of waiting for news of Season 8's release date (checking Amazon every day waiting for the announcement).

848376,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0002WZN8K,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[7, 7]","During the seventh season, many people thought that Friends was near the end. The comedy that existed in the beginning seemed to be a little stale, yet it was still one of the best shows on television. There was talk that season eight would be the final one for the six friends.Then came Sept. 11.Following the horrific events of that day, people began turning to comfort items and Friends was certainly that. Rejuvenated by higher ratings the show took off again and enjoyed quite possibly one of the finest years in the ten year run.The eighth season journeyed down a number of roads, with the two predominant ones being Ross and Rachel's baby and Chandler and Monica as newlyweds.Matthew Perry's Chandler went through a lot of changes during the course of the show, probably the most of any of the characters. Seeing him as a newlywed brings a whole new side to his comedy. He was certainly funny as a single guy living with Joey, but this newlywed Chandler is a different kind of funny.Courtney Cox Arquette is great as the neurotic Monica, finally in a marriage, but with someone she may never have guessed only a few short years ago, before the whole London thing. In this season she attempts to stick it to a reviewer who disses her restaurant, talks Chandler into taking baths and tries to impress her parents with a toast involving a dead dog. Once again, her comedy with Chandler takes on a whole new level.The storyline involving Ross and Rachel's baby is a great one and the episode where everyone finds out exactly how it ""happened"" is one of the best of the season. As a viewer, most people have been rooting for the two to get together, and this season does that, but at the same time begins to pull them apart.The very beautiful Jennifer Aniston pulls off a pregnant Rachel very well. The nerves, the mood swings, the food aversions, and the actual birth itself are all well done. This is her moment to shine on this show and she takes it and runs with it.As Ross, David Schwimmer continues to be the ""divorced guy."" He meets Mona at Monica and Chandler's wedding and begins dating her then tries to explain the whole Rachel pregnancy thing to her. He talks himself into many ridiculous situations throughout the course of the season.Matt LeBlanc's Joey gets a great storyline in the season as well, as he realizes he is falling in love with Rachel. This plays out through the season as Rachel moves in with Ross, then after having the baby, says yes to Joey's ""proposal"", leaving the viewer hanging until the start of season nine.As Phoebe, Lisa Kudrow is often on the outside, but she presents a unique angle on many of the situations. Her stories this year include dating her twin sister's fiancee (Sean Penn), giving Monica a massage and a variety of other strange situations.This season featured some great episodes, as mentioned. One of the great episodes of the ten seasons was the Thanksgiving episode featuring Brad Pitt. He plays a high school friend of Ross who was a founding member of the ""I Hate Rachel Green Club"". His loathing of her makes for an interesting Thanksgiving for everyone. And it is actually kind of funny to watch him despise his real life wife.All in all, this season was one of the best seasons of the show. Viewers got to see new sides to many of the characters, yet the old back stories that made them who they are still are relevant. The ending to the season was a great one, leaving a viewer hanging on until season nine (Which is due out in a few months).Obviously any fan of Friends is going to want this set, but anyone who is a fan of the sitcom in general and wants to see what good writing and good acting look like, this, or any set from the Friends series, is a good bet.

I love the arcs of this season between the characters. This was the best season, and season 9 was a close second.REVIEW OF ARCSMonica and Chandler: The arc for Monica in this season was very passive, probably because last season was all about her.Phoebe: Phoebe doesn't really have an arc this season, which is common for PhoebeJoey: I love that Joey is in love with Rachel, but feels he can't be because of his friendship to Ross. However, I feel that because Ross and Rachel are not a couple, regardless of her having Ross' baby, that Joey should be allowed to go for it.Ross: I hated Ross' arc this season, I felt that he was unreasonable in many fronts this season. He didn't want Rachel to date because she was having his baby, but was dating another girl himself. He didn't want Joey to date Rachel, regardless that he wasn't planning to date Rachel himself until the last episode.Rachel: I love how much Rachel grew up this season, I wish that she would have realized she and Joey were perfect for one another this season.I am a huge fan of the Joey and Rachel relationship, mainly because it makes more sense than Ross and Rachel, and I was sick and tired of all the Ross and Rachel back and forth junk.EPISODE REVIEWS&#34;The One After ' I Do'&#34; I liked this episode, it was the start of a really great season. It wasn't the funniest, probably a 3 or 4, but the emotional situations with Rachel were great&#34;The One with the Red Sweater&#34; This episode wasn't very good. I was predictable and didn't have many funny moments&#34;The One Where Rachel Tells Ross&#34; This episode was pretty funny, the new story with Monica and Chandler wasn't very funny, The story line with Joey and Phoebe was passively okay. The story between Ross and Rachel was what was funny&#34;The One with the Videotape&#34; A great friends episode, laughing non-stop.&#34;The One With Rachel's Date&#34; Not a fan, mainly because Ross goes from not wanting Rachel to date because she is having his baby to dating someone else himself. I found that it made me not like Ross at all this season&#34;The One With the Halloween Party&#34; It was funny. I'm not an Ursula fan, though. Sean Penn guest stars, and they consider him to be a fox, but I don't. Chandler and Ross have the funniest outfits. Joey and Monica have no real arc. Rachel's arc is reasonable, and that little kid at the end that demands the money and is a brat, I would have turned him over my knee, little spoiled brat.&#34;The One with the Stain&#34; Monica's story-line is so funny. She started assuming crazy things because she didn't want a maid that badly. The  story with Joey starts to show that Joey and Rachel would make a good couple. I feel like after Season 5 Joey and Rachel started having a great relationship and became like best friends&#34;The One with the Stripper&#34; OMG, you'll die laughing!&#34;The One with the Rumor&#34; Two words: Brad Pitt! Not a funny episode, unless you think about how much fun Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt had pretending to hate each other since they were happily married at the time in real life.&#34;The One with Monica's Boots&#34; Funny but unreal. I would have sold them to Rachel who wanted them and got some money back and Chandler would have been happy instead of losing all the money when the boots disappear&#34;The One With Ross's Step Forward&#34; So Funny. David is a great actor. I don't like Mona though.&#34;The One Where Joey Dates Rachel&#34; Loved! I was so happy I was jumping up and down when Joey realized he likes Rachel&#34;The One Where Chandler Takes a Bath&#34;. We'll have a little baby ruth! This episode is so funny, but only between Ross and Rachel&#34;The One With the Secret Closet&#34; Totally funny, but it would never have happened with Monica, unrealistic&#34;The One with the Birthing Video&#34; So funny, but scary to all future mothers&#34;The One Where Joey Tells Rachel&#34; I cried so hard when Rachel didn't just grab him and kiss him&#34;The One with the Tea Leaves&#34; Joey is a great friend, but kind of dumb. He really shows it in this episode, but it is totally funny&#34;The One in Massapequa&#34; I love Parker, I just love him! So funny, but only between Phoebe and Parker (Alec Baldwin)&#34;The One with Joey's Interview&#34; Not too good, I don't like Flash Back episodes of material I've already seen. Flash back into the past and alternate worlds are okay, and so fun, though.&#34;The One with the Baby Shower&#34; So-So. The game show is super funny and I want to play it!&#34;The One with the Cooking Class&#34; Totally funny, and I've done what Monica did before&#34;The One Where Rachel is Late&#34; Funny, great fake belly, but I wanted to kill Rachel&#34;The One Where Rachel has a Baby&#34; Funny, great episode!REVIEW OF CASEI have a cardboard flip open case. I hate it.

With Rachel's pregnancy, the characters of the show were forced to ""grow up"". Adding a child into the mix will do that. Even the childish Joey was hit with an emotional wave when he actually falls in love for the first time with Rachel. Falling in love is no stranger to the characters on Friends, but it was different this time because it was more of a soap opera kind of situation...you know, falling for your best friend's girl. That story was a bit more lighthearted for the 8th season, but it paved the way for the less funnier 9th and 10th seasons. Also at this point, the show was starting to show it's age. Overall, the 8th season is hilarious and if you've enjoyed the first 7 seasons, then you can't go wrong with this one.As for the DVD features, I'm still disappointed in the commentaries. I haven't listened to them, but I really wish they would include some cast members. It's so much more enjoyable to hear a couple of actors laughing their way together through an episode rather than the behind the scene's people...at least for this type of show. I also wish they would start dividing the episodes into scenes so you don't have to fast forward your way through it to get to where you last left off. There aren't really that many extras this time around. There's another ""Friends of Friends part 3"" 19 minute installment. I also did enjoy the ""Bamboozled"" trivia game (played like the episode where Joey auditions for the game show) which also is a little short with the questions, but it was fun to play nevertheless. I think the shining moment for extra features would be the 8 minute gag reel. I could watch those all day long. I just wish they would include more footage! So in conclusion, buy the collection!

I have grown up with this series on TV and have remained loyal even through the most mediocre of seasons (6,9 and parts of 10 spring to mind) but after watching the finale of season 8, I was just floored by how good the season had been. It was funny again, not just the kind of funny that makes you smile but makes you laugh out loud. My favorite episode from this season, other than the finale, has to be the one where Ross and Rachel pretend to be married. It not only provided us with some of the funniest moments of the season, but this episode like most others really delved into the relationship between Ross and Rachel. I think that relationship was the key ingredient to the season and it was really bittersweet. All that 'we were on a break' stuff was water under the bridge and all was good in Ross and Rachel Land again.I will be at the store when it opens on Nov. 9 to buy this classic season.

Unfortunately, I sensed a slight decline in seventh season (which is still good). So, I was not prepared to the real show that season eight is.The writers were totally in top form. Almost all the lines, all the jokes, were brilliantly written. It's a ""tour de force"", because you will want to watch all the episodes in a row. Also, all the characters found new depths to their presonalities, aminly Joey and Phoebe. LeBlanc and Kudrow are breathtaking in their up-revved characters, Joey being more kind and sensitive, and Phoebe even more determined, outspoken and independent. As for Aniston, no wonder she got the Emmy. She's marellous here.

The series started picking up near the end of season seven with Monica (Courtney Cox) & Chandler's (Matthew Perry) wedding and the cliffhanger of one of the girls being pregnant.  Season eight opens with the wedding reception in progress and it is discovered that Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) is the one pregnant.  Rachel's pregnancy is the main storyline for the season.  It is determined that Ross (David Schwimmer) is the father and this creates complications with Joey (Matt Le Blanc) who after living with Rachel develops feelings for her.  The season's finale episode where Rachel finally has the baby has gone down as one of the best, if not the best episode, in the series' history.  There are other hilarious episodes along the way including one where Chandler finds the soothing qualities of a bath with scented oils, one where Rachel tells Joey her boss is trying to buy her baby and Ross tries to retrieve his favorite shirt from his ex-girlfriend's apartment, the one where Joey & Rachel go on a date and Monica gets Chandler a Ms. Pac Man machine and the annual Thanksgiving episode in which Ms. Aniston's real life husband Brad Pitt guest stars as a fellow classmate and friend of Ross' from high school who started the We Hate Rachel club in high school.

848391,A27XLRTG0ZIDNO,B0002WZN8K,"Roy ""mmm_chicken""","[7, 7]","Friends is one of my favorite shows because it gets better with repeat viewings. A few years ago when this season was on it was obvious that it would wind up being the best season of the show and several years later after repeat viewings that assumption rings true.At the end of the seventh season, the Friends writers revealed a twist that blew everyone away: Rachel was pregnant. The eighth season is pretty much all about that, but the ways the writers keep this SL from becoming cliched is truly amazing. Although at the time it was frustrating that they just wouldn't put Ross and Rachel back together, watching now it's cool to realize that Ross and Rachel were only a couple for a short period of time and spent the rest of the series apart even though fans wanted them together. The writers did this because it's what kept most people watching.Not surprisingly, most of the best episodes revolve around the aftermath of Rachel's discovery. I especially like the episode where we get to see the videotape of Ross and Rachel's fateful night. More strong episodes come when Joey ends up falling for Rachel. Even though I didn't want them to get together, it was still great to see Matt LeBlanc do some very good acting. The only thing I didn't like was Mona, but that was probably because the actress had the thankless job of trying to come between Ross and Rachel, a role very similar to that of Julie in Season 2.Another thing that works about this season is the minimum of big guest stars. The fact that they didn't overdo it makes the few guest spots work very well.I highly recommend this DVD set. Friends found the perfect balance of drama and comedy once again and almost all of the episodes are fun to watch over and over. This was the year Friends started to get the respect it deserved. It's no surprise it won all those Emmys for this season, so do yourself a favor and get the greatest season of one of the best shows you could ever hope to watch.",5,Quite possibly the best season of a great series,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,1964,"['Friends', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'better', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'season', 'was', 'was', 'obvious', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'assumption', 'rings', 'end', 'seventh', 'season', 'Friends', 'writers', 'revealed', 'twist', 'blew', 'everyone', 'away', 'Rachel', 'was', 'pregnant', 'eighth', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'ways', 'writers', 'keep', 'SL', 'becoming', 'cliched', 'truly', 'amazing', 'time', 'was', 'frustrating', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'back', 'together', 'watching', 'now', 'cool', 'realize', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'spent', 'rest', 'series', 'apart', 'even', 'fans', 'wanted', 'together', 'writers', 'did', 'what', 'kept', 'most', 'people', 'watching.Not', 'surprisingly', 'most', 'best', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'aftermath', 'Rachel', 'discovery', 'especially', 'episode', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'videotape', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'fateful', 'night', 'More', 'strong', 'episodes', 'come', 'when', 'Joey', 'up', 'falling', 'Rachel', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'together', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Mona', 'was', 'probably', 'actress', 'had', 'thankless', 'job', 'trying', 'come', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'role', 'very', 'similar', 'Julie', 'Season', '2.Another', 'thing', 'season', 'minimum', 'big', 'guest', 'stars', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'few', 'guest', 'spots', 'work', 'very', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'Friends', 'found', 'perfect', 'balance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'once', 'again', 'almost', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'over', 'was', 'year', 'Friends', 'started', 'get', 'respect', 'deserved', 'surprise', 'won', 'Emmys', 'season', 'so', 'do', 'favor', 'get', 'greatest', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'watch']",N/A

It reminds of of Cheers' long run on TV, then 'Fraiser' (a Cheers spin-off) started its 10-year run (or something like that)I've watched Friends on and off throughout the years, but the show's really not for me.  The jokes are too woman-oriented, the guys are too woman-oriented (three wusses), it's a woman-oriented show, and women happen to be the show's leading viewers. Hum.  But that's okay with me, women always seem to get the last word on any sitcom you see.In this season, the question is asked:  who is the father of Rachel's baby?  I'm sure this storyline became a problem with some of the viewers (the heavy church-go-ers) because Rachel had pre-marital sex, ooh.  I remember on the last episode the season before this one, they led you to believe that it was going to be Monica who was having a baby.  It seemed alright because she was about to marry Chandler, right?  And then we find out the baby is Ross's.

The show was reinvigorated by Rachel's unexpected pregnancy thus producing some of the most watched episodes of the show's history. The show ended the season as the number show on TV for the first time in its run.Jennifer Aniston dominated the season and there was no doubt that she was great in it. She was great in such episodes like TOW After I Do, TOW Rachel Tells, TOW Joey Dates Rachel, TOW Rachel is Late and TOW Rachel has a baby (the episode that won her the Emmy). It was such a character growth for her, she gets to be funny and dramatic and she really nailed that season.But of course Jennifer can't do it alone, the other five Friends had some great episodes of their own that really cemented season 8 as one of the show's best. David Schwimmer was great in TOW Rachel Tells and TOW Ross Step Forward. Lisa Kudrow in TOW Monica's Boots, TOW the Red Sweater, and TOW the Rumor. Matt le blanc showed the other side of Joey with episodes like TOW Joey Dates Rachel and TOW Joey Tells Rachel. Some of the best episodes of Cox and Perry are usually with each other like TOW the Stripper, TOW Chandler Takes a Bath, TOW the Birthing Video, TOW the Halloween Party, and TOW the Baby Shower.And of course season 8 wouldn't be complete without me mentioning the TOW the Rumor, probably one of the most well liked and popular recent episodes of the show. Brad Pitt did a great job jiving with the cast, he seemed very at home and relaxed. But this episode is a great ensemble episode. Everyone was just funny, full of great one-liners (I think it would better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other)Season 8 is a triumphant season.
