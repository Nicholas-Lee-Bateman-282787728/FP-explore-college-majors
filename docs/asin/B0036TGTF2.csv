Couldn't be happier with the service and quality of Amazon and their products and how quickly they ship to my home. It's so nice to get the same quality or better from Amazon that I have to pay so much more for in the stores and I don't have to leave home to do all my shopping. He has wanted this series for quite sometime however the prices in the stores for one season ran from $29.00 and up and to have the same product delivered to my home for a much cheaper price is something I will always love not to mention, I don'thave to use my gas, time, and deal with cranky salespeople because with Amazon, I can do it all right from my home when I want. The fact that I can place my order when everyone is sleeping or out and I'm not trying to hide things in a cart in a crowded store. Amazon is great with keeping my personal information personal and I have never had one problem with any services I have used. Great products at great prices and I dont' have to worry about returns if any because it's all well taken care of quickly and efficiently. Resuce me is a series that I've been able to buy because of the great prices and a gift that he didn't expect to get and will get. There are many series that we now own because we can afford to buy them all at once if we want and not have to pay what they expect you to pay in stores.

1329176,A3FJ9H7MZKPWF6,B0036TGTF2,baceman007,"[0, 1]","Perhaps this should be said for half of season 5 and all of season 6. Tons of horrific s*** happens in this series, but it is also a series that shows us a very relevant view into the lives of our heroes from the FDNY and how we (meaning mostly privileged people) tend to forget them, and for those of us that grew up listening to ""No Cure for Cancer"" it is always nice to get some more Denis Leary comedy. Still, the series would have done better wrapping everything up in about 5 seasons.(****SPOILER ALERT****)Having something terrible happen to Jimmy's son on top of everything else, and having Janet repeat herself about restarting the relationship and testing Tommy with booze yet again, after an uncomfortable restaurant fight the episode before, is just redundant to say the least. Also, Janet and Shiela's characters went from being interesting to just bitchy back in the season 5 episode when they visit the mom with the dead baby to try and get Tommy back. I mean really, they did every over the top thing they could in this series, and it just gets ridiculous at this point. For example, Lou quit your damned job. You have a bad heart and it's going to get people killed. It's not interesting to watch, it's just annoying.
