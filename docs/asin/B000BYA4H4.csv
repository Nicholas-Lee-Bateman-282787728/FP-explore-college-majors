952542,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BYA4H4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","One of my favorite films from the 30's (but I LOVE the 30's so, you know), `The Champ' is one of those teary-eyed father/son films that really knows how to tug at those heartstrings.  With sentiment that seems natural as apposed to manipulated (although there is a fair share of manipulation if you really look at it), `The Champ' is an unforgettable film that is as funny as it is touching.You have to love that solid mix of humor and heart.The film takes a look at a down and out, washed up boxer who goes by the title `The Champ' who is struggling to take care of his young son Dink.  They don't have much, and The Champ has quite a few vices (like alcohol for starters), but there is a genuine admiration found in Dink's eyes, and a sincere warmth of father toward son.  When Dink's mother comes back into the picture, complete with new husband, daughter and wealth, The Champ feels pressured to get back in the ring in order to provide his son with the life he deserves.Insert waterworks.The story is one that has been built off of for years now.  It is a model for all dramatic sports movies made today (and of yesteryear) for it is a marvelous example of sports related excitement and poignant family drama.  You can see this films influence in many related dramas today, recently in films like `Cinderella Man'.The performances are really very well done across the board.  Some have found Irene Rich to be a little `all over the place' with her theatrical performance, but part of me found her very appropriate for the character (finding her long lost son so-to-speak).  Wallace Beery won the Oscar (shared with Frederick March) for his beautifully sincere portrayal of The Champ.  It was a truly deserved award, one that I can completely rally behind.  He expresses a somberness that really reaches to the heart of the film.  The star for me though is young Jackie Cooper.  Cooper is just brilliant here, delivering one of my favorite child performances of all time and quite frankly should have won the Oscar.  He was phenomenal here, evoking such natural emotions from us with his completely realized and genuine performance.  You believed every word and action that came from this kid.And he wasn't even nominated!In the end I have nothing but praise for this wonderful film.  It is a moving cinematic experience that the entire family can enjoy.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer...and yes, you will cry some more.  It is a full circle of emotional reactions that leave the audience feeling completely rewarded.",5,This one is a champion alright!,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2530,"['One', 'favorite', 'films', '30', 'LOVE', '30', 'so', 'know', 'Champ', 'one', 'teary-eyed', 'father/son', 'films', 'really', 'how', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'sentiment', 'natural', 'apposed', 'manipulated', 'fair', 'share', 'manipulation', 'really', 'look', 'Champ', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'as', 'funny', 'touching.You', 'have', 'love', 'solid', 'mix', 'humor', 'heart.The', 'film', 'look', 'down', 'out', 'washed', 'up', 'boxer', 'who', 'title', 'Champ', 'who', 'struggling', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'son', 'Dink', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'Champ', 'quite', 'few', 'vices', 'alcohol', 'starters', 'genuine', 'admiration', 'found', 'Dink', 'eyes', 'sincere', 'warmth', 'father', 'son', 'When', 'Dink', 'mother', 'back', 'picture', 'complete', 'new', 'husband', 'daughter', 'wealth', 'Champ', 'feels', 'pressured', 'get', 'back', 'ring', 'order', 'provide', 'son', 'life', 'waterworks.The', 'story', 'one', 'been', 'built', 'years', 'now', 'model', 'dramatic', 'sports', 'movies', 'made', 'today', 'yesteryear', 'marvelous', 'example', 'sports', 'related', 'excitement', 'poignant', 'family', 'drama', 'can', 'see', 'films', 'influence', 'many', 'related', 'dramas', 'today', 'recently', 'films', 'Cinderella', ""Man'.The"", 'performances', 'are', 'really', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'board', 'have', 'found', 'Irene', 'Rich', 'be', 'little', 'place', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'part', 'found', 'very', 'appropriate', 'character', 'finding', 'long', 'lost', 'son', 'so-to-speak', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'won', 'Oscar', 'shared', 'Frederick', 'March', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'portrayal', 'Champ', 'was', 'truly', 'deserved', 'award', 'one', 'can', 'completely', 'rally', 'behind', 'somberness', 'really', 'heart', 'film', 'star', 'young', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'Cooper', 'just', 'brilliant', 'here', 'delivering', 'one', 'favorite', 'child', 'performances', 'time', 'quite', 'frankly', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'evoking', 'such', 'natural', 'emotions', 'completely', 'realized', 'genuine', 'performance', 'believed', 'word', 'action', 'came', 'kid.And', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'end', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'wonderful', 'film', 'moving', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'cry', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'yes', 'will', 'cry', 'more', 'full', 'circle', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'leave', 'audience', 'feeling', 'completely', 'rewarded']",N/A

His son (Jackie Cooper) lives with him and idolizes him. Beery accidentally runs into his ex-wife one day - she's now rich - and she convinces him that Cooper would be better off with her. (Child custody ""laws"" were quite different back then.) He reluctantly goes with his mother, but before long runs away back to dear old dad. The climax comes during a boxing match in which Beery, after being terribly pummelled by his younger opponent, miraculously wins with his last punch, only to die in the dressing room a short while later.Beery is engrossing - the role fits him like a glove, and Cooper isn't too bad either (except for the long crying jag at the end, which tore audiences up back then, and may still do so today). The technical limitations of 1931 contribute a great deal to the overly theatrical and somewhat wooden acting styles, but the movie is not afraid to wear its emotions on its sleeve, which was always its great appeal.

952544,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000BYA4H4,Buenoslibros.es,"[9, 10]","This is a wonderful drama, social, human and familial. As all good classics there's more to the story than just surface plot. You can see it from multiple perspectives, among them the social one is always very present in Vidor's films.But first of all this is a great, great movie. One of those that will make you cry in a couple of scenes at least; if you don't, you'd better check your pulse.Now, here are the subterraneous plots that I see:1) The familial, the relation between a divorced father and his little son, whom he loves immensely and by whom he is likewise corresponded. This, actually, is not a plot but a naturalistic depiction of this relationship thru story details and characterization.2) The social. The incompatibility between high-class minded people and simple minded/humble people.3) The individual relationships between the three main characters or roles: the uneducated and loving father, the apparently educated and classy mother and the innocent child. This triangle gives a lot of food for thought about the mysteries of the human soul. And every viewer will have his own take on this side of the story.I hope we'll be able to see soon on dvd more of Vidor's great classics, like ""The Crowd"", ""The Fountainhead"", ""Our Daily Bread"", or the great ""The Big Parade"".One more thing: The quality of the dvd is exeptional.

952545,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000BYA4H4,calvinnme,"[0, 0]","This almost eighty-year old film will bring both a tear and a smile. It is the story of washed-up and somewhat alcoholic boxer Andy Purcell, just known as ""Champ"" to everyone, including his adoring little son, ""Dink"", played by Jackie Cooper. It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status. The only thing that continues to give his life meaning is his son. The Champ isn't exactly providing a wholesome environment for Dink. Dink hangs out in pool halls with his Dad, isn't enrolled in school, and sits up nights alone in their dingy room waiting for the Champ to come home when he is out on a drinking binge. Champ's ex-wife, socialite Linda, sees Andy and Dink at the racetrack one day and tries to convince Andy that Dink would be better off with her. At first the Champ is unpersuaded. However, when he gets a hold of a good sum of money and gambles it away and winds up in the drunk tank overnight he decides that maybe it is for the best if Dink goes with Linda.Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them. He won a well-deserved Best Actor award for his role, but if there had been a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1931 it would have gone to nine-year old Jackie Cooper. He is comic as the street-wise kid meeting his half-sister for the first time - ""The d ame is goofy"" he remarks. He is heart-rending when the Champ tells him he doesn't want him around any more, that he's tired of feeding him, just so he'll go with his mother.A minor point that made this film so refreshing for me is that nobody tries to ""lawyer up"" or turn Dink's fate into a courtroom battle. Everyone deals with everyone else in this film on decent human terms. In the end the Champ tries to regain the championship so he can provide a good life for his son and so that his son can respect him, not so that he can win a custody fight.There are two extras on the DVD. One is the 1930 two-strip Technicolor short Cr azy House, the other is a radio production of The Champ with Wallace Beery. Cr azy Horse was a pleasant surprise. It stars comic Benny Rubin and Vernon Dent, the heavyset member of the Columbia comic shorts department that starred in so many Three Stooges shorts. While Rubin tours a sanitarium it doesn't take him long to realize that the staff is as insane as the patients. It's a fun little piece and also stars Karl Dane, Cliff Edwards, Polly Moran, and  dancer Snake Hip. It's odd to see Karl Dane in a talking short, and this was one of his last at MGM. He had a successful silent career, but his thick Danish accent made him unintelligible in talking pictures.The whole DVD is a very entertaining way to spend some time, and I highly recommend it.",5,A three hankie movie that will also make you laugh,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,2880,"['almost', 'eighty-year', 'old', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'smile', 'story', 'washed-up', 'somewhat', 'alcoholic', 'boxer', 'Andy', 'Purcell', 'just', 'known', 'Champ', 'everyone', 'including', 'adoring', 'little', 'son', 'Dink', 'played', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'life', 'really', 'ceased', 'have', 'meaning', 'Champ', 'ever', 'lost', 'championship', 'status', 'only', 'thing', 'give', 'life', 'meaning', 'son', 'Champ', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'providing', 'wholesome', 'environment', 'Dink', 'Dink', 'out', 'pool', 'halls', 'Dad', ""n't"", 'enrolled', 'school', 'up', 'nights', 'alone', 'dingy', 'room', 'waiting', 'Champ', 'come', 'home', 'when', 'out', 'drinking', 'binge', 'Champ', 'ex-wife', 'socialite', 'Linda', 'Andy', 'Dink', 'racetrack', 'one', 'day', 'tries', 'convince', 'Andy', 'Dink', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'first', 'Champ', 'unpersuaded', 'However', 'when', 'hold', 'good', 'sum', 'money', 'gambles', 'away', 'up', 'drunk', 'tank', 'overnight', 'maybe', 'best', 'Dink', 'Linda.Wallace', 'Beery', 'had', 'lean', 'times', 'motion', 'pictures', 'transitioned', 'sound', 'however', 'got', 'new', 'lease', 'career', 'MGM', 'turned', 'out', 'coarse', 'voice', 'attracted', 'fans', 'rather', 'repelled', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', '1931', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'nine-year', 'old', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'comic', 'street-wise', 'kid', 'meeting', 'half-sister', 'first', 'time', 'd', 'ame', 'goofy', 'remarks', 'heart-rending', 'when', 'Champ', ""n't"", 'want', 'around', 'more', 'tired', 'feeding', 'just', 'so', ""'ll"", 'go', 'mother.A', 'minor', 'point', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'refreshing', 'nobody', 'lawyer', 'up', 'turn', 'Dink', 'fate', 'courtroom', 'battle', 'Everyone', 'deals', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'decent', 'human', 'terms', 'end', 'Champ', 'tries', 'regain', 'championship', 'can', 'provide', 'good', 'life', 'son', 'so', 'son', 'can', 'respect', 'not', 'so', 'can', 'win', 'custody', 'are', 'two', 'extras', 'DVD', 'One', '1930', 'two-strip', 'Technicolor', 'short', 'Cr', 'azy', 'House', 'other', 'radio', 'production', 'Champ', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'Cr', 'azy', 'Horse', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'comic', 'Benny', 'Rubin', 'Vernon', 'Dent', 'heavyset', 'member', 'Columbia', 'comic', 'shorts', 'department', 'starred', 'so', 'many', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'Rubin', 'sanitarium', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'staff', 'as', 'insane', 'patients', 'fun', 'little', 'piece', 'also', 'stars', 'Karl', 'Dane', 'Cliff', 'Edwards', 'Polly', 'Moran', 'dancer', 'Snake', 'Hip', 'odd', 'see', 'Karl', 'Dane', 'talking', 'short', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'MGM', 'had', 'successful', 'silent', 'career', 'thick', 'Danish', 'accent', 'made', 'unintelligible', 'talking', 'pictures.The', 'whole', 'DVD', 'very', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Possibly, but if you're going to be manipulated at least have it done by the best.  There is nothing slick here.  Director King Vidor vividly captures the desolate seediness of Depression-era Tijuana.  The film's climactic fight scene is very realistic.

The chemistry is dynamic between the lovably grizzled Beery and the heart-rending Cooper.  The formula here is timeless so the story doesn't date in the least.

952548,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B000BYA4H4,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","""The Champ"" is a film icon - one of the best films to come out in the early 30s and clearly a blockbuster. It starred Wallace Beery who was at the top of his game, and little Jackie Cooper who set a standard for all future child actors with a performance that is the equal of any by Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, etc.Berry won the Oscar for Best Actor and Francis Marion won for Best Story. King Vidor was nominated for Best Director (he lost to Frank Borzage) and the film was nominated as Best Picture (it lost to ""Grand Hotel"" in which Beery also starred).Marion was the first woman to win an Oscar for writing, which she did the year before for ""The Big House"" that starred Beery.  She was the favorite writer for such well known actors as Mary Pickford, Marion Davies, and Marie Dressler.Beery had been in desperate need of a chance, his career in jeopardy after being released from his contract with Paramount and spending more than a year without a film offer prior to working on the ""Big House"". His role as Butch in that film, coupled with ""Min and Bill"" the same year (also written by Marion) and ""Billy the Kid"" (he played Pat Garrett), followed with the best actor award in 1931 for ""The Champ"" elevated Beery to the A list where he remained and made such memorable films as ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""Viva Villa"" (1934), and ""China Seas"" (1935). He continued to work through 1949, but his heyday was the 30s.Jackie Cooper started acting at age 3 and by the time he was 9 and appeared in ""The Champ"" he had been in 19 films, mostly shorts. His appearance in ""Skippy"" (1931) earned him a nomination as Best Actor (he lost to Lionel Barrymore), his first and only nomination, and following the success of ""The Champ"" he had a solid career as a child star, appearing in several films with Beery (""The Bowery"", ""Treasure Island"").Throughout the film, Beery and Cooper alternate in small solo performances that are outstanding. Of particular note is Cooper's fidgeting outside his mother's hotel room that ends up with a trip to the roof, and Beery's morning hygiene routine in his hotel room. These sequence are mostly silent, as we were only a few years outside the silent era in which everyone on this film worked.Roscoe Ates co-stars. He was best known for his stutter, which was real, and he used it to comic advantage in over 100 films, mostly  westerns. From 1946 to 1948 he appeared as ""Soapy Jones"" in 15 films. In the 50s he made the transition to TV, and was a regular in ""The Lawman"" (1959-60).King Vidor directs. Vidor was nominated for an Oscar in 1928 (""The Crowd""), 1929 (""Hallelujah""), 1931 (""The Champ""), 1938 (""Citadel"") and 1956 (""War and Peace""). He never won. He is listed in the Guinness Book as having the longest career as a film director (67 years).The film is melodramatic and some have criticized it for not being very subtle - aka a tearjerker. That criticism notwithstanding, it is a beautiful film and the chemistry between Beery and Cooper has rarely been matched in cinema history. Cooper is particularly adept at appearing to be the true son of Beery in adopting his speech, his mannerisms, and his walk. Beery shows what a good actor he was by seeming to care about Cooper, while Cooper later is life says that off screen Beery treated him ""like a dog"".The film has been re-made several times (e.g., ""The Clown"" in 1952, ""The Champ"" in 1979 by Zeffirelli) but none of these can match the original.Apart from the excellent performances, the good direction and the excellent photography given the time period, the film has lots of interesting bits about the way that people in the early 30s lived. Scenes in the hotels and restaurants are particularly revealing of the depression.You'll want to see this film and be sure to have a hankerchef at your ready.",5,Classic,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,3811,"['Champ', 'film', 'icon', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'early', '30s', 'clearly', 'blockbuster', 'starred', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'who', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'little', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'who', 'set', 'standard', 'future', 'child', 'actors', 'performance', 'equal', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'etc.Berry', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Francis', 'Marion', 'won', 'Best', 'Story', 'King', 'Vidor', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'lost', 'Frank', 'Borzage', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'lost', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Beery', 'also', 'starred', '.Marion', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'win', 'Oscar', 'writing', 'did', 'year', 'Big', 'House', 'starred', 'Beery', 'was', 'favorite', 'writer', 'such', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'Marion', 'Davies', 'Marie', 'Dressler.Beery', 'had', 'been', 'desperate', 'need', 'chance', 'career', 'jeopardy', 'being', 'released', 'contract', 'Paramount', 'spending', 'more', 'year', 'film', 'offer', 'prior', 'working', 'Big', 'House', 'role', 'Butch', 'film', 'coupled', 'Min', 'Bill', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'written', 'Marion', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'played', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'followed', 'best', 'actor', 'award', '1931', 'Champ', 'elevated', 'Beery', 'A', 'list', 'where', 'remained', 'made', 'such', 'memorable', 'films', 'Treasure', 'Island', '1934', 'Viva', 'Villa', '1934', 'China', 'Seas', '1935', 'continued', 'work', '1949', 'heyday', 'was', '30s.Jackie', 'Cooper', 'started', 'acting', 'age', '3', 'time', 'was', '9', 'appeared', 'Champ', 'had', 'been', '19', 'films', 'mostly', 'appearance', 'Skippy', '1931', 'earned', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'lost', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'first', 'only', 'nomination', 'following', 'success', 'Champ', 'had', 'solid', 'career', 'child', 'star', 'appearing', 'several', 'films', 'Beery', 'Bowery', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'film', 'Beery', 'Cooper', 'alternate', 'small', 'solo', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'particular', 'note', 'Cooper', 'fidgeting', 'mother', 'hotel', 'room', 'up', 'trip', 'roof', 'Beery', 'morning', 'hygiene', 'routine', 'hotel', 'room', 'sequence', 'are', 'mostly', 'silent', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'silent', 'era', 'everyone', 'film', 'worked.Roscoe', 'co-stars', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'stutter', 'was', 'real', 'used', 'comic', 'advantage', '100', 'films', 'mostly', '1946', '1948', 'appeared', 'Soapy', 'Jones', '15', 'films', '50s', 'made', 'transition', 'TV', 'was', 'regular', 'Lawman', '1959-60', '.King', 'Vidor', 'directs', 'Vidor', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '1928', 'Crowd', '1929', 'Hallelujah', '1931', 'Champ', '1938', 'Citadel', '1956', 'War', 'Peace', 'never', 'won', 'listed', 'Guinness', 'Book', 'having', 'longest', 'career', 'film', 'director', '67', 'years', '.The', 'film', 'melodramatic', 'have', 'criticized', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'subtle', 'aka', 'tearjerker', 'criticism', 'notwithstanding', 'beautiful', 'film', 'chemistry', 'Beery', 'Cooper', 'rarely', 'been', 'matched', 'cinema', 'history', 'Cooper', 'particularly', 'adept', 'appearing', 'be', 'true', 'son', 'Beery', 'adopting', 'speech', 'mannerisms', 'walk', 'Beery', 'what', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'seeming', 'care', 'Cooper', 'Cooper', 'later', 'life', 'off', 'screen', 'Beery', 'treated', 'dog', '.The', 'film', 'been', 're-made', 'several', 'times', 'e.g.', 'Clown', '1952', 'Champ', '1979', 'Zeffirelli', 'none', 'can', 'match', 'original.Apart', 'excellent', 'performances', 'good', 'direction', 'excellent', 'photography', 'given', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'lots', 'interesting', 'bits', 'way', 'people', 'early', '30s', 'lived', 'Scenes', 'hotels', 'restaurants', 'are', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'depression.You', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'hankerchef', 'ready']",N/A

952552,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B000BYA4H4,Green Manalishi,"[4, 7]","Don't beleive the hype on this site.  This movie doesn't come close to the 1970s version with Jon Voight and Ricky Schroeder.  It's like comparing a treatment to a full-blown screenplay, a rough draft to a finished novel.  I watched both movies with different groups of people, and I can tell you there was barely a dry eye after the 70s version finished, whereas watching this 1931 version didn't leave a huge impression on the viewers - didn't see anyone covertly reaching for the tissue when the lights came on!  There are some obvious reasons why this original version is nowhere near as good.The first and foremost reason is that the boy who idolizes 'The Champ' (Jackie Cooper), doesn't evoke much sympathy.  He's loud mouthed and kind of coarse. When with his other friends, he comes off as kind of a brat.  He brazenly steals from his mother the first time he visits her, and it's almost as if he's too big for the role - he's just not that cute.  And how could you be with a name like 'Dink'?  Compare this to the Schroeder version.  Schroeder, a virtual unknown when he did the picture, was tough, a back-talker, yes, but charming.  His idolatry of his father, the Champ, generated genuine pathos, time after time and scene after scene.  Without a sympathetic child character the movie has lost most of its might.Second reason this picture fails by comparison is ""The Champ"" himself - played by Wallace Beery.  Beery doesn't have anything of the elegant wasted charm or the sophistication of Jon Voight's portrayal of a drunken gambler with a love for his child.  Granted these two pictures are from vastly different eras, but whereas Voight came off as a father whose vagabond charm just seems convincing enough to warrant A) the boys idolatry and B) the audiences sympathy, the Beery portrayal is almost silly.  Beery looks like he'd never spent 10 minutes in a real boxing ring.  His boxing antics are reminiscent of the 3 Stooges.  To be blunt, he's fat and clumsy looking.  He's still more likeable than the boy though, which is saying very little, regardless of whether Jackie Cooper was at one time a Little Rascal.Then there's the setting.  I could be wrong but I thought the 70s version took place in Miami or something.  The film was drenched in a world of horseracing, gambling and boxing.Finally, there's t the acting which comparatively comes off flat and wooden (especially if you've seen the 70s version before to this).  The 1931 version reflects a different time and mentality, not only in culture and acting standards, but in direction and movie production.  Movie stars and movies hadn't reached the level of realism and maturity that was standard fare by time Schroeder's ""The Champ"" was released.  It is unfair to compare the sophistication of late-70s movie-making, acting and direction with that of 1931.  But make no mistake about which is the better movie if we do compare.After reading all the glowing reviews on this listing, I came to this movie with high hopes, if not a certain amount of disbeleif that ANY version could be better than the one with Voight and Schroeder at the peak of their powers. Better not set the bar so high. By comparison, this movie suffers from lack of pathos and sympathy for the two main characters.  Without that, the film just isn't a masterpiece, though the basic formula of the storyline was still probably enough to go over well with 1931 audiences.",3,Doesn't hold a candle to the Voight/Schroeder version,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,3421,"['Do', ""n't"", 'beleive', 'hype', 'site', 'movie', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', '1970s', 'version', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Ricky', 'Schroeder', 'comparing', 'treatment', 'full-blown', 'screenplay', 'rough', 'draft', 'finished', 'novel', 'watched', 'movies', 'different', 'groups', 'people', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'barely', 'dry', 'eye', '70s', 'version', 'finished', 'whereas', 'watching', '1931', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'huge', 'impression', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'covertly', 'reaching', 'tissue', 'when', 'lights', 'came', 'are', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'why', 'original', 'version', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good.The', 'first', 'foremost', 'reason', 'boy', 'who', 'Champ', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', ""n't"", 'evoke', 'much', 'sympathy', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'kind', 'coarse', 'When', 'other', 'friends', 'off', 'kind', 'brat', 'brazenly', 'mother', 'first', 'time', 'almost', 'too', 'big', 'role', 'just', 'not', 'cute', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'name', ""'Dink"", 'Compare', 'Schroeder', 'version', 'Schroeder', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'when', 'did', 'picture', 'was', 'tough', 'back-talker', 'yes', 'charming', 'idolatry', 'father', 'Champ', 'generated', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'time', 'time', 'scene', 'scene', 'sympathetic', 'child', 'character', 'movie', 'lost', 'most', 'might.Second', 'reason', 'picture', 'comparison', 'Champ', 'played', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'Beery', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'elegant', 'wasted', 'charm', 'sophistication', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'portrayal', 'drunken', 'gambler', 'love', 'child', 'Granted', 'two', 'pictures', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'eras', 'whereas', 'Voight', 'came', 'off', 'father', 'vagabond', 'charm', 'just', 'convincing', 'enough', 'warrant', 'A', 'boys', 'idolatry', 'B', 'audiences', 'sympathy', 'Beery', 'portrayal', 'almost', 'silly', 'Beery', ""'d"", 'never', 'spent', '10', 'minutes', 'real', 'boxing', 'ring', 'boxing', 'antics', 'are', 'reminiscent', '3', 'Stooges', 'be', 'blunt', 'fat', 'clumsy', 'looking', 'still', 'more', 'likeable', 'boy', 'saying', 'very', 'little', 'regardless', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'Little', 'Rascal.Then', 'setting', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'thought', '70s', 'version', 'took', 'place', 'Miami', 'something', 'film', 'was', 'drenched', 'world', 'horseracing', 'gambling', 'boxing.Finally', 'acting', 'comparatively', 'flat', 'wooden', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', '70s', 'version', '1931', 'version', 'different', 'time', 'mentality', 'not', 'only', 'culture', 'acting', 'standards', 'direction', 'movie', 'production', 'Movie', 'stars', 'movies', 'had', ""n't"", 'reached', 'level', 'realism', 'maturity', 'was', 'standard', 'fare', 'time', 'Schroeder', 'Champ', 'was', 'released', 'unfair', 'compare', 'sophistication', 'late-70s', 'movie-making', 'acting', 'direction', '1931', 'make', 'mistake', 'better', 'movie', 'do', 'compare.After', 'reading', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'listing', 'came', 'movie', 'high', 'hopes', 'not', 'certain', 'amount', 'disbeleif', 'ANY', 'version', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'one', 'Voight', 'Schroeder', 'peak', 'powers', 'Better', 'not', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'comparison', 'movie', 'lack', 'pathos', 'sympathy', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'basic', 'formula', 'storyline', 'was', 'still', 'probably', 'enough', 'go', 'over', 'well', '1931', 'audiences']",N/A

Down in Tijuana, Mexico, the Champ is a washed up boxer training for a big comeback but having a hard time getting an actual fight set up. He's just too out of shape and too hooked on drinking and gambling, and the only thing he loves as much as his vices is his 8-year-old boy, Dink, who basically takes care of him. When Dink's mother surprisingly turns up in town at the horse races and discovers her boy for the first time since he was a baby, she immediately wants custody restored to her and her wealthy husband, but Dink and the Champ are a pair that just can't be broken up. The film plays out one very charming, often funny, but very powerfully heartbreaking drama throughout as the Champ struggles to prove himself in the eyes of his son, while the boy's mother tries desperately to be rejoined with him.I have to admit that I resisted seeing this film for a long time because I expected a sports/boxing movie, and I'm just not into sports. However, I always enjoyed Jackie Cooper in the Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts and had heard so much about this one that I knew I had to see it. I caught it one night, not so long ago, on a TCM airing, and I had to buy the film right away! It's truly a masterpiece. Wallace Beery (The Champ) and Jackie Cooper (Dink) are magic together! It's no wonder the film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1931 (and Best Director, King Vidor) and Beery won for Best Actor (the film also got Best Story)! And, being a Disney fanatic, I was immediately reminded of Baloo and Mowgli in Disney's take of ""The Jungle Book"", one of their most beloved animated features. There's no way the makers of that movie weren't playing off this movie. Baloo IS Wallace Beery's ""The Champ"", and even the story plays out similarly. In fact, while everyone should see this film, I especially recommend it to fans of Disney's animated ""The Jungle Book"". Having said that, this film is just beautiful and the final scene... wow, it's the tearjerker of tearjerkers.The DVD is very nice with its selection of extras: Theatrical Trailer, full hour-long Lux Theater Radio Production, and a live-action comedy short, ""Crazy House"" (though it's pretty awful, ha).

952560,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B000BYA4H4,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[0, 0]","Frances Marion wrote scripts for three movies of Wallace Beery and this was her best script for which she won an Academy award. The story is about a down and out boxer who is at the bottom end of the society makes come back for the sake of his idolizing son brilliantly played by Jackie Cooper. This nine year old star of ""Our gang"" got bigger praise than Beery from the critics, and loud sobbing from the audience. The friendship between Dink (Jackie Cooper) and his black friend Jonah (Jesse Scott) is color blind and another touching part of the movie. This true tear jerker was directed by King Vidor and excellent supporting roles played by Irene Rich, Jesse Scott and Roscoe Ates. The story has an interesting end when Dink finds his real mother who only happens to be wealthy and too willing to care for him. This movie was done with such professionalism in all departments that it was the biggest box office hit in 1931 for MGM studios; much needed revenue for the studio to stay alive at the height of great depression.Another movie inspired by Cooper's ""You can do it, dad,"" phrase of this movie was the ""O'Shaughnessy's boy."" The script for was pretty much the Jackie Cooper - Wallace Beery formula but their ""Champ"" box office hit was not repeated. In 1978, 47 years after this movie, Champ was remade starring Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway, which also did not repeat the success of the original Champ.1.Treasure Island DVD (1934) Wallace Beery, Jackie Cooper Region 1 U.S. & Canada2.Treasure Island3.TV Classics - Our Gang",5,Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper are true champions of this movie,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,1533,"['Frances', 'Marion', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'three', 'movies', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'was', 'best', 'script', 'won', 'Academy', 'award', 'story', 'down', 'boxer', 'who', 'bottom', 'end', 'society', 'come', 'back', 'sake', 'idolizing', 'son', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'star', 'gang', 'got', 'bigger', 'praise', 'Beery', 'critics', 'loud', 'sobbing', 'audience', 'friendship', 'Dink', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'black', 'friend', 'Jonah', 'Jesse', 'Scott', 'color', 'blind', 'touching', 'part', 'movie', 'true', 'tear', 'jerker', 'was', 'directed', 'King', 'Vidor', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'played', 'Irene', 'Rich', 'Jesse', 'Scott', 'Roscoe', 'Ates', 'story', 'interesting', 'end', 'when', 'Dink', 'real', 'mother', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'wealthy', 'too', 'willing', 'care', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'professionalism', 'departments', 'was', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'hit', '1931', 'MGM', 'studios', 'much', 'needed', 'revenue', 'studio', 'stay', 'alive', 'height', 'great', 'depression.Another', 'movie', 'inspired', 'Cooper', 'can', 'do', 'phrase', 'movie', 'was', ""O'Shaughnessy"", 'boy', 'script', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'formula', 'Champ', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'was', 'not', 'repeated', '1978', '47', 'years', 'movie', 'Champ', 'was', 'remade', 'starring', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'repeat', 'success', 'original', 'Champ.1.Treasure', 'Island', 'DVD', '1934', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'Region', '1', 'U.S.', 'Canada2.Treasure', 'Island3.TV', 'Classics', 'Gang']",N/A
952561,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B000BYA4H4,Randy Keehn,"[4, 5]","I was very familar with the reputation of the movie ""The Champ"" but never saw it until last night.  I was prepared for a film heavy on sentimentality, a fair amount of action (in the ring), and a cute child actor.  I got all of that but in a better package than I had expected.  Although I was hesitant to give the movie a 5 Star rating, I did so on the exceptional acting from the two stars.I have seen a number of other films with Wallace Beery and his character is generally the same in every movie; a sort of Victor McLaughlin with a lower voice.  He's quite the likable character but what impressed me the most was the many times he spoke his lines as though they were an ""in-character"" ad lib offering.  As I noticed those scenes, I saw others in which he seemed to speak as though from a script.  However, his ""aw shucks"" style never varied and the way the words flowed seemingly spontaneously is probably the reason he won the Best Actor Oscar for ""The Champ"".Beery had real competition for that award from young Jackie Coogan.  I was equally impressed with his acting and I felt that there were parts of the movie that the director may have turned him loose to do his own ad-libbing.  His emotions were very effective and never overdone, even at the end.  The scene where he discovers that the drunk being brought to jail in the paddy wagon is actually his father is outstanding.  There were many other noteworthy scenes of his as well.  The supporting cast is rather standard fare and serves only to fill in the roles necessary for Beery and Coogan to strut their stuff.The plot is rather predictable and you could sense the ending almost from the beginning.  Much of the plot is there to enhance our appreciation of this father/son relationship.  At times the scenes let us know how bad a father Beery is while other scenes (often the same ones) let us know how devoted a son Coogan is.  I usually succumb to a good tear-jertker but ""The Champ"" left me more inspired by the acting than teary-eyed from the plot.  Either way, this is a worthwhile movie to see.",5,A Classic,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,2070,"['was', 'very', 'familar', 'reputation', 'movie', 'Champ', 'never', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'prepared', 'film', 'heavy', 'sentimentality', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'ring', 'cute', 'child', 'actor', 'got', 'better', 'package', 'had', 'expected', 'was', 'hesitant', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'Star', 'rating', 'did', 'so', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'two', 'stars.I', 'have', 'seen', 'number', 'other', 'films', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'character', 'generally', 'same', 'movie', 'sort', 'Victor', 'McLaughlin', 'lower', 'voice', 'quite', 'likable', 'character', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'was', 'many', 'times', 'spoke', 'lines', 'were', 'in-character', 'ad', 'lib', 'offering', 'noticed', 'scenes', 'saw', 'others', 'seemed', 'speak', 'script', 'However', 'aw', 'shucks', 'style', 'never', 'varied', 'way', 'words', 'flowed', 'seemingly', 'spontaneously', 'probably', 'reason', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Champ', '.Beery', 'had', 'real', 'competition', 'award', 'young', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'was', 'equally', 'impressed', 'acting', 'felt', 'were', 'parts', 'movie', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'turned', 'loose', 'do', 'own', 'ad-libbing', 'emotions', 'were', 'very', 'effective', 'never', 'overdone', 'even', 'end', 'scene', 'where', 'drunk', 'being', 'brought', 'jail', 'paddy', 'wagon', 'actually', 'father', 'outstanding', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'rather', 'standard', 'fare', 'only', 'fill', 'roles', 'necessary', 'Beery', 'Coogan', 'strut', 'stuff.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'predictable', 'could', 'sense', 'ending', 'almost', 'beginning', 'Much', 'plot', 'there', 'enhance', 'appreciation', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'times', 'scenes', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'bad', 'father', 'Beery', 'other', 'scenes', 'often', 'same', 'ones', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'devoted', 'son', 'Coogan', 'usually', 'succumb', 'good', 'tear-jertker', 'Champ', 'left', 'more', 'inspired', 'acting', 'teary-eyed', 'plot', 'way', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'see']",N/A

What a tragic movie! A comeback boxer and his son are the main charaters. A boxer raising his son by himself after his wife leaves him. He's a loser drunk that provides love, and understanding to his boy. Later the boy's mother finds out that her son is living close to where she lives (she's remarried with a daughter), and persues a relationship with him. Very good movie, but is sometimes over-acted, as most movies are in that era. The overall thought of this movie is, watch it, you won't be sorry.
