1540457,A7P9LPMSBAAME,B00803PGGM,Holly,"[0, 0]","The worst of the 3 is Blaze. A sad vehicle for the aging actor, Paul Newman. It is billed as a comedy. it is not, even, mildly amusing. A real waste of time. Dumb. I will give this movie 2 stars.Dustin Hoffman is an acting icon (as are all 3 actors starring in these movies), But, even though he was not bad in this role, it just didn't seem to be a right fit for him. The acting, through out, is good and the story is OK.. I give this movie 3 1/2 stars. Just a little bit better than OK.The best of the 3 is Nixon. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Nixon. He really captured him. The movie plays, somewhat, as a documentary..I think there was an element of editorial in the story, but it, basically, played true. This director's cut version has an additional 28 minutes added to a very long movie. I liked it, but I don't think it is for everyone. Anthony Hopkins gets 5 stars for his performance. I give the movie 4 stars.",3,3 movies starring 3 brilliant actors.

1540459,A2EW64WI4R74Z8,B00803PGGM,RestlessBoomer,"[1, 1]","....of these three movies.  ""Billy Bathgate"" is passable with Dustin Hoffman playing a very mean Dutch Schultz with great panache.  Bruce Willis is his usual swaggering self as the guy who gets ""in dutch with Dutch"" and pays the consequences.  Nicole Kidman is, well....Nicole Kidman.  A pretty fair movie--far better than ""Blaze"" with Paul Newman appearing to struggle speaking with new false teeth,  This one was so lame and crude I didn't even get through the first half.""Nixon"" is the gem here and Anthony Hopkins is at the top of his game portraying that ""scoundrel President"" and actually evoking sympathy for his character.  He is both hateful and pitiable and you end of with a very different impression of Nixon after Hopkins' portrayal.  Granted, it's not an accurate presentation but it does give one pause to consider what was going on inside of Nixon's head and what he struggled with in his past that made him the man he turned out to be.  This movie is very well done.",4,Nixon's the best....,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,983,"['.of', 'three', 'movies', 'Billy', 'Bathgate', 'passable', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'playing', 'very', 'mean', 'Dutch', 'Schultz', 'great', 'panache', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'usual', 'swaggering', 'self', 'guy', 'who', 'dutch', 'Dutch', 'consequences', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'well', '.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'A', 'pretty', 'fair', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'Blaze', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'appearing', 'struggle', 'speaking', 'new', 'false', 'teeth', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'lame', 'crude', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'first', 'half', 'Nixon', 'gem', 'here', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'top', 'game', 'portraying', 'scoundrel', 'President', 'actually', 'evoking', 'sympathy', 'character', 'hateful', 'pitiable', 'end', 'very', 'different', 'impression', 'Nixon', 'Hopkins', 'portrayal', 'Granted', 'not', 'accurate', 'presentation', 'give', 'one', 'pause', 'consider', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Nixon', 'head', 'what', 'struggled', 'past', 'made', 'man', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done']",Billy Bathgate & Blaze + Nixon - Triple Feature
