867684,A20NTWL30HBNYE,B0006GY1QW,"Chris B ""Kuklapolitan""","[1, 1]","Clay Aiken happens to be one of my all time favorites that came through the American Idol wringer and gave us the opportunity to listen to his awesome range of voice and feeling.  I would have tagged this DVD with 5 Stars as a rating but for two things.  This Christmas special was done in a cozy atmosphere which was presumably a living room with fireplace, tree and goodies placed everywhere.  At the same time there were tables outside of that living room area where people sat to listen, almost a cabaret like setting.  While I find nothing at all wrong with Clay's voice and selections of Christmas material to sing for us, I find it odd that so little interaction went on between his ""guests"" and himself!  His musical guests, on the other hand were warm and friendly but it was Clay's show and I believe it was his responsibility, in such an intimate setting to interact just a bit more with his living room kids and adult listeners at the tables.  He also needs a dresser...badly!",4,Clay Has A Gift!,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,988,"['Clay', 'Aiken', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'came', 'American', 'Idol', 'wringer', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'listen', 'awesome', 'range', 'voice', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'tagged', 'DVD', '5', 'Stars', 'rating', 'two', 'things', 'Christmas', 'special', 'was', 'done', 'cozy', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'presumably', 'living', 'room', 'fireplace', 'tree', 'goodies', 'placed', 'everywhere', 'same', 'time', 'were', 'tables', 'living', 'room', 'area', 'where', 'people', 'sat', 'listen', 'almost', 'cabaret', 'setting', 'find', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Clay', 'voice', 'selections', 'Christmas', 'material', 'sing', 'find', 'so', 'little', 'interaction', 'went', 'guests', 'musical', 'guests', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'warm', 'friendly', 'was', 'Clay', 'show', 'believe', 'was', 'responsibility', 'such', 'intimate', 'setting', 'interact', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'living', 'room', 'kids', 'adult', 'listeners', 'tables', 'also', 'dresser', 'badly']",N/A

I'll watch The Exorcist to make up for it. &lt;grin>This was a rather interesting show. The set was absolutely gorgeous, and made me want to drag out all of my Christmas decorations and start hanging them up. They really did a terrific job.But the best job had to be Clay. His voice was pitch perfect, and I was a little surprised that I found his to be the most enjoyable of the three performers. I wondered what he would sound like next to Barry Manilow, and frankly, I think he had the better voice. I'm not knocking Barry in any way - I've been a big fan of his for a long time.

Clay has created an instant classic Christmas DVD that will be enjoyed for many many years. In his casual, warm and inviting style, we join him in his living room for an evening as he honors the songs of Christmas that represent timeless values in his beautiful, pure, pitch perfect voice.I was moved by the consciousness of spirituality that infuses but never overwhelms the production. I loved the fade to black following Clay's glorious rendition of ""Mary Did You Know"" and the moment of silent reverence it implied. The windows-within- windows concept along with the work in progress format of this DVD will never become boring because it is continually evolving in visually gorgeous, interesting and entertaining streams on so many levels.  There is logic to the way each song lead to the other and I was impressed with the smooth and easy transitions in the overstructure.I loved Yolanda Adams inspired gospel rendition of ""O Holy Night"". The brilliant Barry Manilow added style and class to the production with his timeless voice and charming manner.  Quiana Parler did a wonderful job on her duet with Clay.Clay provided an abundance of dazzling eye candy and childlike wonderment for kids of all ages with a toy train chugging along under the tree covered with myriad lights and glistening ornaments that were used at times as a glittering framework for the scene unfolding.The set decoration was perfect, classy and inviting and the camera operator kept the production visually fascinating by attention to all the artistic details and visual treats that continued to unfold as christmas wrappings to reveal hidden treasures inside. Aiken has gifted us with a top quality, family inclusive Christmas present that all ages can enjoy for a very long time.It is easy to grade this DVD with 5 stars.  I wish there were more stars to show Clay and others that we appreciate quality and tastefulness in media and that we will continue to support Clay because he has earned it and he is worth it.",5,INSTANT CLASSIC  & EMMY  WORTHY!!!!,1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,2131,"['Elegant', 'classy', 'dazzling', 'heartwarming', 'humble', 'great', 'So', 'many', 'elements', 'make', 'A', 'Clay', 'Aiken', 'Christmas', 'totally', 'EMMY', 'WORTHY', 'Clay', 'created', 'instant', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'casual', 'warm', 'inviting', 'style', 'join', 'living', 'room', 'evening', 'songs', 'Christmas', 'represent', 'timeless', 'values', 'beautiful', 'pure', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'voice.I', 'was', 'moved', 'consciousness', 'spirituality', 'never', 'overwhelms', 'production', 'loved', 'fade', 'black', 'following', 'Clay', 'glorious', 'rendition', 'Mary', 'Did', 'Know', 'moment', 'silent', 'reverence', 'implied', 'windows-within-', 'windows', 'concept', 'work', 'progress', 'format', 'DVD', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'boring', 'continually', 'evolving', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'streams', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'logic', 'way', 'song', 'lead', 'other', 'was', 'impressed', 'smooth', 'easy', 'transitions', 'overstructure.I', 'loved', 'Yolanda', 'Adams', 'inspired', 'gospel', 'rendition', 'O', 'Holy', 'Night', 'brilliant', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'added', 'style', 'class', 'production', 'timeless', 'voice', 'charming', 'manner', 'Quiana', 'Parler', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'duet', 'Clay.Clay', 'provided', 'abundance', 'dazzling', 'eye', 'candy', 'childlike', 'wonderment', 'kids', 'ages', 'toy', 'train', 'chugging', 'along', 'tree', 'covered', 'myriad', 'lights', 'glistening', 'ornaments', 'were', 'used', 'times', 'glittering', 'framework', 'scene', 'unfolding.The', 'set', 'decoration', 'was', 'perfect', 'classy', 'inviting', 'camera', 'operator', 'kept', 'production', 'visually', 'fascinating', 'attention', 'artistic', 'details', 'visual', 'treats', 'continued', 'unfold', 'christmas', 'wrappings', 'reveal', 'hidden', 'treasures', 'Aiken', 'gifted', 'top', 'quality', 'family', 'inclusive', 'Christmas', 'present', 'ages', 'can', 'enjoy', 'very', 'long', 'time.It', 'easy', 'grade', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'stars', 'show', 'Clay', 'others', 'appreciate', 'quality', 'tastefulness', 'media', 'will', 'continue', 'support', 'Clay', 'earned']",N/A

I would have been happy just to see Clay sitting on a stool all night crooning out the songs. And after hearing Clays rendition of ""The Christmas Waltz,"" (you know, the song that starts out ""Frosted window panes...""), it made me wish they had put that song on Clays Christmas cd instead of ""The Christmas Song (Chesnuts roasting on an open fire)."" What do you other Clay fans think?I think that Clay did a great job! As time goes by, Clay becomes more and more comfortable in front of the cameras, and it shows. He was relaxed and at ease with the material and he obviously loved the presence of all the children in the audience.I think Yolanda Adams looked and sounded wonderful.

The wait was worth it.I have one complaint about this Christmas special.  It is way too short.  I would have loved to see more of Clay, Barry, Yolanda Adams, and Clay, Clay, Clay!  And what happened to Megan?  I would have loved to watch and hear her sing.This Christmas special and the way it was done made the show somewhat more real, the behind the scenes, the chatting that took place between the performers, etc, allowed viewers to have a more intimate experience of the show.  As Clay said he wanted us to sit back and enjoy the songs and he will show us how the show is made.  This Christmas DVD did exactly that.  A not so traditional format of a traditional Christmas show.I thought that using the choir as part of the audience was a brilliant idea.
