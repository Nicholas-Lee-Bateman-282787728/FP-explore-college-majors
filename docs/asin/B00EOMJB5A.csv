1668384,A446PJ96JQX4X,B00EOMJB5A,Sonya@Hollywood,"[7, 7]","""Bonnie & Clyde: Real Story"" gives the viewer a better look and insight into two of America's most interesting gangsters. While their crimes are not glamorized, this documentary gives the viewer real insight into their unusual story and why after decades people are still fascinated.  Bonnie Parker was a young waitress when she met Clyde Barrows already with a record and a penchant for robbery.  I don't believe they knew at the time, their eventual historical notoriety.  In many ways they were a product of their time. The 1930's was a period of great economic strife for many, but hardship was already embedded in Clyde Barrow's young life.  Clyde started stealing at an early age and his record had police monitoring him even when he tried working legitimately. Ironically, In some ways the constant presence of the police might have helped Clyde steer into criminal behavior. According to the biography, Clyde couldn't hold jobs for long with the police coming around to question him all the time.  This documentary offers compelling commentary from Marie Barrow (Clyde's sister) and excerpts from letters between Bonnie and Clyde and from Blanche Barrow's memoirs. The viewer gets a detailed glimpse of personal moments as well as harrowing events of their two year crime spree.  Bonnie  tried to get Clyde to ""go straight"" at the beginning of their relationship and her letters are quoted. But after Eastham prison, Clyde was visibly hardened and his crimes seemed to reflect that change. In a rush to escape one of their hideouts, Bonnie and Clyde left behind a camera with the now, famous poses of the young attractive couple. After photos made the newspapers, Bonnie and Clyde became popular and peaked public interest. However, too many mistakes and unfortunate associations and ""misfires"" that left a  trail of grisly murders, their life on the run led to a violent end. ""Bonnie and Clyde: Real Story"" is an excellent documentary!",5,"Bonnie & Clyde, Lovers on the Run",1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1944,"['Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Real', 'Story', 'viewer', 'better', 'look', 'insight', 'two', 'America', 'most', 'interesting', 'gangsters', 'crimes', 'are', 'not', 'glamorized', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'real', 'insight', 'unusual', 'story', 'why', 'decades', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'fascinated', 'Bonnie', 'Parker', 'was', 'young', 'waitress', 'when', 'met', 'Clyde', 'Barrows', 'already', 'record', 'penchant', 'robbery', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'knew', 'time', 'eventual', 'historical', 'notoriety', 'many', 'ways', 'were', 'product', 'time', '1930', 'was', 'period', 'great', 'economic', 'strife', 'many', 'hardship', 'was', 'already', 'embedded', 'Clyde', 'Barrow', 'young', 'life', 'Clyde', 'started', 'stealing', 'early', 'age', 'record', 'had', 'police', 'monitoring', 'even', 'when', 'tried', 'working', 'legitimately', 'Ironically', 'ways', 'constant', 'presence', 'police', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'Clyde', 'steer', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'According', 'biography', 'Clyde', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'jobs', 'long', 'police', 'coming', 'around', 'question', 'time', 'documentary', 'offers', 'compelling', 'commentary', 'Marie', 'Barrow', 'Clyde', 'sister', 'excerpts', 'letters', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Blanche', 'Barrow', 'memoirs', 'viewer', 'detailed', 'glimpse', 'personal', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'harrowing', 'events', 'two', 'year', 'crime', 'spree', 'Bonnie', 'tried', 'get', 'Clyde', 'go', 'straight', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'letters', 'are', 'quoted', 'Eastham', 'prison', 'Clyde', 'was', 'visibly', 'hardened', 'crimes', 'seemed', 'reflect', 'change', 'rush', 'escape', 'one', 'hideouts', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'left', 'behind', 'camera', 'now', 'famous', 'poses', 'young', 'attractive', 'couple', 'photos', 'made', 'newspapers', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'became', 'popular', 'peaked', 'public', 'interest', 'However', 'too', 'many', 'mistakes', 'unfortunate', 'associations', 'misfires', 'left', 'trail', 'grisly', 'murders', 'life', 'run', 'led', 'violent', 'end', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Real', 'Story', 'excellent', 'documentary']",Bonnie & Clyde: The Real Story
