So I watched it and now I have up in the pentheon of movie greats. My favorite character is Jackson because he's cool and someone that most of us guys can relate to. He is also responsible and consciensous and the man that everyone can count on. His parents count on him despite their divorce, his sister counts on him even though she just graduated, and his friends count on him because they have problems and they know Jack always has their backs. But what happens when Jackson runs into a serious problem of his own which is finding out his girlfriend Denise dated his father? And who does he turn to when he breaks up with Denise and later regrets it? The answer is his three friends Derrick, Brian, and Terry. Together they set out to help one another with the problems they encounter such as Derrick's impending divorce from his wife, Brian's bad luck with women and his family crisis, and Terry's reservations about marriage along with what Jackson has to deal with. They are known as ""The Brothers"", four close friends who stick with each other and help each other out through thick and thin.

662420,A1XI5UAJE5Z6KN,B00005LB86,bordersj2,"[1, 1]","I saw this movie years ago and found it almost forgettable.  I say 'almost' because there was one theme in it that for whatever reason I couldn't forget; because it was kind of goofy.  The 'piece of food' gesture, where you just know he cares abotu you if he gives you the last piece of pizza, chicken wing, cookie, piece of cake, etc.  Real words to live by....The Amazon recap captures it pretty well.  4 yuppies come to terms with relationships and family issues.  Morris Chestnut plays the lead with unresolved issues with his father that spills into his relationship with the new woman of his dreams (played by Gabrielle Union).  Bill Bellamy's character has a problem with women in general, and then there's the one that's getting married.  Finally, DL Hughely rounds out the cast as someone that's already married, only he struggles to get his wife to give... a different form of intimacy.  There are some funny moments, some interesting twists and it's not a negative movie.Spoilers follow:  After seeing the movie again, I must admit that I found it more entertaining - but in a bad way.  It almost flows like a poorly written novel loaded with cliche's.  The worst?  Let's be honest here - one character had wedding jitters.  And he was probably a little dumb with the way he talked to his fiance.  But did it really warrant, no matter how stupid he may have been, for her to run over to the house, in her wedding dress, and pump it full of bullets?  They went ahead with the wedding but c'mon!  The only 'committment' needed there was her and a psychiatric ward.  Maybe him as well since he went ahead and married her... Heaven forbid he refuses to take the trash out one night; his morning coffee might be laced with cyanide - assuming he lived to see the morning light.  So that's one example of the ridiculous spots in the movie, and that was perhaps supposed to be the climax.  If beyond entertainment it's about relationships as well, it's a type of movie that would make me think: ""You know, maybe it's less stressful (and not to mention healthier) being single.""  So this movie has 2.5 stars, rounded up to three because it wasn't terrible.  It just wasn't that good either.

You can have a love life and still have time for your boys. ""The Brothers"" is a movie that combines elements of The Wood and Waiting To Exhale. The Brothers paled by Morris Chestnut(Jackson), D.L.Hughley(Derrick), Bill Belamy(Brian) and Shemar Moore(Terry) each have a quality that makes them special to the movie. Jackson is the commitment phobic brother who's scared to get involved with a women because of his parent failed marriage that is until he meets Denise played by the sexy Gabierlla Union. Derrick is the married one whose wife won't perform oral sex on him. Brian is the ulimate player whose can't find joy in black women so he turns to white women and Terry is a playboy who decides to go staright and marry his girlfriend. The movie is very real in it's portrayal of what black men go through when it comes to women. I related the most to Jackson though. I highly recomend this movie.

Jeter ""DwayneJ""","[0, 0]","I never saw the promo for this movie, I happened to catch it on Hi-Def Satellite and it is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The direction was on the mark, the plot was the usual fare of ""afraid to give my heart"" but it clearly shows that the universal theme of men vs women is always an enjoyable one to watch.  I was skeptical about this movie at first thinking this was just another, (excuse me ladies), ""chick flick"" but the intricacies of black relationships and friendships and family interplay were as genuine as a Tyler Perry play or movie.  The characters were well developed the guys and especially the ladies were of todays' best young and mature actors and the feeling of the movie was contemporary and it felt real especially the funny parts.  D. L. Hughley was hilarous, Angelle Brooks & Gabrielle Union were incredibly hot, it was great to see Marla Gibbs again on the screen, the little girl from ""Fresh Prince"" Tatyana Ali did a great job, and Jenifer Lewis as always stole the show.  Being a black man I especially identify with the male characters in that we have a unique  place that society has placed us in that we must use to our advantage to build up not tear down as long as it doesn't hurt or destroy the lives of others.  There is a lot of bad press out about black men today because of a few bone heads so when a movie like this comes along it is fun, funny, heartfelt and genuine to experience.

That's what's love: something unique for each pair, couple or even group of people who experience it. Then why four men, with one father and one mother (in fact with a slight appearance of a second mother and a slightly less slight appearance of a third mother) behind? Four men like the four evangelists, the four gospels, the four cardinal points, the four winds, the four elements composing the universe, so many other four whatever. Four is a cultural structure that conveys in our civilization the idea of balance, equilibrium and perfection, and yet also that of a certain crucifixion, which is in its turn the promise of a resurrection and even farther off the promise of the final end of our world of tears and the eternal emergence of the messianic Jerusalem, the fulfilling of the millenium long prediction. Four men, thus, but one of them is different, the little young John, the visionary and apocalyptic one, three synoptic ones and one who stands apart. Patterns cannot evade our subconscious, and quite often conscious, way of thinking and imagination. For these men, the group, the brotherhood is the base to which you go back when you are disoriented. In our world and in African tradition it is not any more or has never been the family, at least certainly not the cellular family, a 19th century invention that is plainly exploding today when one adult buries his parents at the same time as he retires from his job and when his children are already raising their own children into teenage and high school. What they experience is love, manly love as Walt Whitman used to call it. But for their own sake they need procreative love that is hormonal, heterosexual and family-line forming. Black men are more advanced than white men, though their experience would look messy to white men: that is the kind of mess awaiting white men in the near future: they will have to live up to it or retire into oblivion. For white men it sounds like castration, frustration, and some other perversions. In fact it is looking for love where it is: everywhere. Love for procreation and physical pleasure that goes through sex, love for life experience and spiritual or professional performance and perspective, love for intimate sharing and interlacing of feelings, emotions and reflections. The latter two types have no obligation to be heterosexual since they are not sexual. The first type has to be sexual but is open today to personal and private choices. The film deals with this issue without any discretion at all with a wife refusing, being unable to give head to her husband - note well it is because her mummy told her it was disgusting. What her mummy told her definitely was disgusting and mean and coming from a time when sex was not pleasure but only a duty to be performed in order to continue the biological race and the blood line of the family. Finally note the director is very careful to avoid any ambiguous situation among these four men and even the father who is a fifth man, the fifth branch of a pentacle. No ambiguity, not even a hint, though of course we could see a lot of symbolic nuances and innuendo. But who understands symbolism in our world of direct and immediate real time communication: symbolism is indirect, delayed and slowed down communication, the food for the thinking of intellectuals.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne",4,Give me head or I'll give you hell.,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,4165,"['film', 'black', 'men', 'nothing', 'black', 'men', 'black', 'men', 'USA', 'due', 'African', 'heritage', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'way', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'European', 'western', 'surroundings', 'have', 'not', 'chosen', 'whatsoever', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'evade', 'slightest', 'way', 'imaginable', 'black', 'men', 'represent', 'what', 'white', 'men', 'are', 'already', 'living', 'will', 'eventually', 'soon', 'live', 'due', 'white', 'women', 'liberation', 'Black', 'women', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'slaves', 'men', 'ever', 'particularly', 'not', 'much', 'as', 'far', 'white', 'women', 'just', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'relations', 'black', 'men', 'black', 'women', 'have', 'be', 'built', 'personally', 'chosen', 'terms', 'have', 'vary', 'one', 'pair', 'partners', 'what', 'love', 'something', 'unique', 'pair', 'couple', 'even', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'experience', 'Then', 'why', 'four', 'men', 'one', 'father', 'one', 'mother', 'fact', 'slight', 'appearance', 'second', 'mother', 'slightly', 'less', 'slight', 'appearance', 'third', 'mother', 'Four', 'men', 'four', 'evangelists', 'four', 'gospels', 'four', 'cardinal', 'points', 'four', 'winds', 'four', 'elements', 'composing', 'universe', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'four', 'Four', 'cultural', 'structure', 'civilization', 'idea', 'balance', 'equilibrium', 'perfection', 'yet', 'also', 'certain', 'crucifixion', 'turn', 'promise', 'resurrection', 'even', 'farther', 'off', 'promise', 'final', 'end', 'world', 'tears', 'eternal', 'emergence', 'messianic', 'Jerusalem', 'fulfilling', 'millenium', 'long', 'prediction', 'Four', 'men', 'thus', 'one', 'different', 'little', 'young', 'John', 'visionary', 'apocalyptic', 'one', 'three', 'synoptic', 'ones', 'one', 'who', 'apart', 'Patterns', 'can', 'not', 'evade', 'subconscious', 'quite', 'often', 'conscious', 'way', 'thinking', 'imagination', 'men', 'group', 'brotherhood', 'base', 'go', 'back', 'when', 'are', 'disoriented', 'world', 'African', 'tradition', 'not', 'more', 'never', 'been', 'family', 'least', 'certainly', 'not', 'cellular', 'family', '19th', 'century', 'invention', 'plainly', 'exploding', 'today', 'when', 'one', 'adult', 'parents', 'same', 'time', 'job', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'already', 'raising', 'own', 'children', 'teenage', 'high', 'school', 'What', 'experience', 'love', 'manly', 'love', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'used', 'call', 'own', 'sake', 'need', 'procreative', 'love', 'hormonal', 'heterosexual', 'family-line', 'forming', 'Black', 'men', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'white', 'men', 'experience', 'would', 'look', 'messy', 'white', 'men', 'kind', 'mess', 'awaiting', 'white', 'men', 'near', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'up', 'retire', 'oblivion', 'white', 'men', 'castration', 'frustration', 'other', 'perversions', 'fact', 'looking', 'love', 'where', 'everywhere', 'Love', 'procreation', 'physical', 'pleasure', 'sex', 'love', 'life', 'experience', 'spiritual', 'professional', 'performance', 'perspective', 'love', 'intimate', 'sharing', 'interlacing', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'reflections', 'latter', 'two', 'types', 'have', 'obligation', 'be', 'heterosexual', 'are', 'not', 'sexual', 'first', 'type', 'be', 'sexual', 'open', 'today', 'personal', 'private', 'choices', 'film', 'deals', 'issue', 'discretion', 'wife', 'refusing', 'being', 'unable', 'give', 'head', 'husband', 'note', 'mummy', 'told', 'was', 'disgusting', 'What', 'mummy', 'told', 'definitely', 'was', 'disgusting', 'mean', 'coming', 'time', 'when', 'sex', 'was', 'not', 'pleasure', 'only', 'duty', 'be', 'performed', 'order', 'continue', 'biological', 'race', 'blood', 'line', 'family', 'Finally', 'note', 'director', 'very', 'careful', 'avoid', 'ambiguous', 'situation', 'four', 'men', 'even', 'father', 'who', 'fifth', 'man', 'fifth', 'branch', 'pentacle', 'ambiguity', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'course', 'could', 'see', 'lot', 'symbolic', 'nuances', 'innuendo', 'who', 'symbolism', 'world', 'direct', 'immediate', 'real', 'time', 'communication', 'symbolism', 'indirect', 'delayed', 'slowed', 'down', 'communication', 'food', 'thinking', 'intellectuals.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', 'Pantheon-Sorbonne']",N/A

This friends coming of age theme has been done to death, and has been handled far better in other flicks than it is here. Ostensibly, this film is about 4 upwardly mobile young black males and their relationships -- with women and each other -- but most of what we see is flexing and preening and a lot of chit chatting without enough story development. How does Jack go from jumping in the bed with Denise the first day that they meet, to being on the verge of making some type of committment? How long ago had she dated his father? How long were they dating? The other relationships are not nearly interesting enough to comment on, but I will say that Bill Bellamy was particularly loathsome. Ugh! There are few things worse than bitter, self-hating dudes. And a whole subplot about  the lack of head? Tres tacky.This movie is weak, and one of my greatest complaints is that the audience is not given any sense of how much time is supposed to have elapsed. One minute, Jack's parents are divorced, but still getting it on on the DL, but somehow they wind up getting remarried. Terry dumps his fiance 2 weeks before the wedding, but they manage to stay together. Puhleeze. It does have its funny moments thanks to the hilarious D.L. Hughley, but I was disappointed in the overall product.And finally, why is it that Black films have to be so extreme? We either get the hood flicks filled with povert and despair, or the buppie flicks where everyone is gorgeous, professional, paid and shallow. How about something about the bulk of us who are somewhere in the middle?Memo to Hollywood: no more Black wedding flicks please. Some of us have exhaled and are ready to go the next level. There is more the life than chasing tail, obsessing over relationships and hanging with the fellas/girls.

662444,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005LB86,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[7, 9]","The Brothers tries to copy Waiting to Exhale. However that film adaptation made the same mistake this film makes: The four men do not become characters who tell their own stories; they become caricatures of types of black men we all know. These stereotypes include the misogynist, the womanizer, the family man and the nice guy who finishes last. If these are the good brothers then I'm worried. Most of these guys only cared about money, clothes, cars and sex. I wanted some dimension to their personalities that would make them into real people onscreen.There was a great story here sadly, the writer couldn't tell it because the shallow producers decided to show pretty pictures of handsome actors wearing expensive designer clothes driving nice cars living in the lap of luxury. I wondered where the character development was. The relationships the Brothers have with the each other seemed contrived. These actors never bonded like ""Brothers."" There was no chemistry between them; the only thing they had in common was the paycheck they got for this film. ""Brother"" means someone you're very close to; I didn't get that feeling watching these four guys onscreen.The relationships these ""Brothers"" have with the women in their lives seemed convoluted as well. Falling in love in this film happens overnight; there is no natural progression to the romance. Morris Chestnut's character meets Gabrielle Union in the park, in one frame they meet and the next they're in bed and in another they're in love. Their big conflict: She used to date his Father-come on! Shemar Moore's character is saying he's a reformed womanizer and is getting married after having a two-month relationship! He gets cold feet and his jilted lover comes back to attack him with a gun in the climax of the film. DL Hughley says he wants to divorce his wife for not orally pleasuring him. Bill Bellamy's character is a misogynist because his mother treated him badly. I kept waiting for the stories of these brothers to get interesting but they went nowhere at all.I found a surprising amount of misogyny in the undertones of this movie. Why were all the women dressed in low-cut belly baring shirts? Why did the DL Hughley character feel he should divorce his wife because he wanted oral sex? Why were all the girlfriends dressed so sexy in most of the scenes? Where was the respect for the sisters? I'd like to have seen some balance in this film; show us some positive images of strong black women standing next to the images of positive black men.I hate to give this film a bad review. I know everyone who worked on it was trying to create a positive message about responsible black men. However the whole movie comes off as shallow and half-hearted. I give props to DL Hughley, Shemar Moore Morris Chestnut, Bill Bellamy, Gabrielle Union, Tamala Jones, Marla Gibbs and the rest of the cast for their work on this film, but I really expected the writer, producers and director to do a better job with this film.

I pretty much thought of the movie as a Male version of Waiting to Exhale.  Jackson (Morris Chestnut) has major commitment problems.  Brian (Bill Bellamy) you will eventually figure out his relationship woes are due to the relationship he had with his mom giving him his jaded views on love. Terry (Shemar Moore) finally decides to settle down, and right before the big day, he let's his commitment phobia shine through.  Derrick (D.L. Hughley), is married and devoted to his family.  His problem?  His wife refuses to have oral sex with him, and it's causing serious isses with their relationship.

Morris Chestnut and DL Hughley give performances good enough to redeem the film of its predictable script. So why the 4 stars? Because the DVD is packed with a decent bunch of extras! We get a nice running commentary by the director, deleted scenes, a featurette, a music video, and, of course, the trailer for this film and other Sony releases. The best of these features is the &quot;Conversation with Director Gary Hardwick.&quot;  He gives a very informative look at the movie; this guy is so laid back and down-to-earth, he looks like he could be your next-door-neighbor.
