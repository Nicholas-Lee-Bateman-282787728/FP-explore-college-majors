Sheryl gives a very lack-luster performance here, making me believe she was forced into doing this performance. Also, I'm quite sure she is lip-synching which for me, is the greatest sin for a &#34;live&#34; performance. I also later purchased her Wildflower Tour: Live from New York, and am greatly satisfied with that one. My opinion, if you don't already have the Wilflower Tour, or any other by Sheryl Crow, buy that one instead of this one- Sheryl Crow: Live",1,Sheryl Crow: Live,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,515,"['should', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'others', 'reviews', 'one', 'Sheryl', 'very', 'lack-luster', 'performance', 'here', 'making', 'believe', 'was', 'forced', 'doing', 'performance', 'Also', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'lip-synching', 'greatest', 'sin', '34', 'live', '34', 'performance', 'also', 'later', 'purchased', 'Wildflower', 'Tour', 'Live', 'New', 'York', 'am', 'greatly', 'satisfied', 'one', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'Wilflower', 'Tour', 'other', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'buy', 'one', 'instead', 'one-', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Live']",N/A

Look carefully at the covers of both the newer release and the older release.  Both have the exact same image of Sheryl Crow and her guitar on the cover which is the clue to indicate that they both contain the exact same concert.Pre-orders (I pre-ordered my now 2nd identical copy) may contain very little information on what the exact concert contains, so you may want to wait and check it out carefully before you order.",5,A re-release,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,627,"['Sheryl', 'Crow', 'band', 'performed', 'quite', 'well', 'Chicago', 'concert', 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'that.But', 'just', 'let', 'know', 're-release', 'previous', 'blu-ray', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'Look', 'carefully', 'covers', 'newer', 'release', 'older', 'release', 'have', 'exact', 'same', 'image', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'guitar', 'cover', 'clue', 'indicate', 'contain', 'exact', 'same', 'concert.Pre-orders', 'pre-ordered', 'now', '2nd', 'identical', 'copy', 'may', 'contain', 'very', 'little', 'information', 'what', 'exact', 'concert', 'contains', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'check', 'out', 'carefully', 'order']",N/A
