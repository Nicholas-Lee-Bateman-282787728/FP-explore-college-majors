For many people, we think about the road not taken...or the man we didn't marry etc...  This movie is amazing in that you get to see Demi live two different lives and you don't know which one is real.  They are both perfect lives in their own right and you struggle along with the characters.  This is a great chick flick and also a great movie for men who want to earn bonus points with their girlfriends (if the women are sentimental).  Get this movie and watch it with your girl...she'll adore you for it.",5,Perfect Chick Flick,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,561,"['absolutely', 'rank', 'top', '5', 'favorite', 'movies', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'marry', 'etc', 'movie', 'amazing', 'get', 'see', 'Demi', 'live', 'two', 'different', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'real', 'are', 'perfect', 'lives', 'own', 'right', 'struggle', 'characters', 'great', 'chick', 'flick', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'earn', 'bonus', 'points', 'girlfriends', 'women', 'are', 'sentimental', 'Get', 'movie', 'watch', 'girl', ""'ll"", 'adore']",Passion of Mind VHS
486451,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,6306005153,atmj,"[0, 1]","This when I read the description seemed very much like a movie that I saw several years ago by Kathleen Turner called Julia Julia.  However it was not.The basic story is that a young woman is a widow in France with two young daughters and a close neighbor friend.  She each night while sleeping lives a dual life in New York as a high powered executive.  Besides the obvious time discrepancy (you only sleep about 8 hours and kids that get sick wake you up in the night) it seems unlikely that the logic works to support this.It is a compelling story none-the-less if you want to suspend logic for the hour and 45 minutes.  She in both lives meets someone and then tells the significant other of her dream life.  This was why she could not sleep overnight with either of her significant others, so she told them why.  Of course they become jealous of the &quot;other&quot; man.  She sees shrinks in both lives for this duplicity, she seems to be living.  The shrink in New York seems aghast that he might be considered a figment of her imagination.Without giving the story line away, it is an interesting movie.  I found the views in France to be breathtaking.  I would love to visit there.  They even made NY city look good. I'm not much of a city person, so this took alot.If you like romanitic movies this one is definitely in that genre.  However, it gets confusing towards the end and the director does not wrap things up in a fashion where you can understand quickly what is going on.  In fact after musing about the movie for a little while there is still some loose ends hanging in my mind about what different things meant.Demi Moore's character Marty/Marie comes across at some point as a very self absorbed character expecting people to dote on her problems and concerns.  It is amazing how little with the exception of the birthday celebration, that she offers to the people around her.  Her &quot;friend&quot; in France and her love interests seem quite content to indulge her excentricities and ignore their own needs.  Not very realistic, but then this is a movie.It was an interesting movie, no more no less.",3,"Intriguing movie, but could have been better",975801600,"12 3, 2000",2000,2124,"['when', 'read', 'description', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'saw', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'called', 'Julia', 'Julia', 'However', 'was', 'not.The', 'basic', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'widow', 'France', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'close', 'neighbor', 'friend', 'night', 'sleeping', 'dual', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'high', 'powered', 'executive', 'obvious', 'time', 'discrepancy', 'only', 'sleep', '8', 'hours', 'kids', 'get', 'sick', 'wake', 'up', 'night', 'unlikely', 'logic', 'support', 'this.It', 'compelling', 'story', 'none-the-less', 'want', 'suspend', 'logic', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'lives', 'meets', 'someone', 'then', 'significant', 'other', 'dream', 'life', 'was', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'sleep', 'overnight', 'significant', 'others', 'told', 'why', 'course', 'become', 'jealous', 'quot', 'other', 'quot', 'man', 'shrinks', 'lives', 'duplicity', 'be', 'living', 'shrink', 'New', 'York', 'aghast', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'figment', 'imagination.Without', 'giving', 'story', 'line', 'away', 'interesting', 'movie', 'found', 'views', 'France', 'be', 'breathtaking', 'would', 'love', 'visit', 'there', 'even', 'made', 'NY', 'city', 'look', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'city', 'person', 'took', 'alot.If', 'romanitic', 'movies', 'one', 'definitely', 'genre', 'However', 'confusing', 'end', 'director', 'not', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'fashion', 'where', 'can', 'understand', 'quickly', 'what', 'going', 'fact', 'musing', 'movie', 'little', 'still', 'loose', 'ends', 'hanging', 'mind', 'what', 'different', 'things', 'meant.Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'Marty/Marie', 'across', 'point', 'very', 'self', 'absorbed', 'character', 'expecting', 'people', 'dote', 'problems', 'concerns', 'amazing', 'how', 'little', 'exception', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'people', 'Her', 'quot', 'friend', 'quot', 'France', 'love', 'interests', 'seem', 'quite', 'content', 'indulge', 'excentricities', 'ignore', 'own', 'needs', 'Not', 'very', 'realistic', 'then', 'movie.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'more', 'less']",Passion of Mind VHS

She never has, but I'll always be willing to give her another chance because I believe it's only a matter of time before every actor and actress releases SOMETHING good.Well, maybe that golden moment for Demi is coming up ahead, or maybe not.  With a boring movie like Passion of Mind, I hope she eventually does something captivating and forgets all about this snorefest of a typical love story (or ""light"" mystery if you prefer... yeah right).This movie is totally not what I was expecting going by the description.  A woman has trouble knowing what's real and what's a dream, and has to go through life that way.  She wakes up and you're not sure if what she's experiencing is all a dream or reality.  Sounds like a perfect mystery or drama to me... unfortunately it's nothing like that at *all*.Instead it's basically a love story between two people that enter her lives and it's extremely difficult to pay attention to THIS kind of dream or reality. The storyline that had so much potential originally has now been reduced to nothing more than a mediocre love story.The two men in her life are very dull.  Dreadfully dull in fact.  They are almost completely pointless because both characters are *that* boring.That's not the only problem.Sometimes a storyline focuses on the main character of the film constantly (in fact, that's how it should be).  This movie is more about focusing on Demi Moore and nothing else.  Forget about the fact you're watching a movie- the camera has to be on Demi Moore all the time because she likes the attention.  So that's another problem I have with the film- it's basically the Demi Moore Show taking place.Just a very very below average movie that could have been a heck of a lot better.",1,very very bad,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,1861,"['give', 'boring', 'piece', 'garbage', '1', 'star', 'hesitation.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'Demi', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'never', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'believe', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'actor', 'actress', 'releases', 'SOMETHING', 'good.Well', 'maybe', 'golden', 'moment', 'Demi', 'coming', 'up', 'ahead', 'maybe', 'not', 'boring', 'movie', 'Passion', 'Mind', 'hope', 'eventually', 'something', 'captivating', 'snorefest', 'typical', 'love', 'story', 'light', 'mystery', 'prefer', 'yeah', 'right', '.This', 'movie', 'totally', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'going', 'description', 'woman', 'trouble', 'knowing', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'dream', 'go', 'life', 'way', 'up', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'experiencing', 'dream', 'reality', 'perfect', 'mystery', 'drama', 'unfortunately', 'nothing', '*all*.Instead', 'basically', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'enter', 'lives', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'pay', 'attention', 'THIS', 'kind', 'dream', 'reality', 'storyline', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'originally', 'now', 'been', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'more', 'mediocre', 'love', 'story.The', 'two', 'men', 'life', 'are', 'very', 'dull', 'Dreadfully', 'fact', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'pointless', 'characters', 'are', '*that*', 'boring.That', 'not', 'only', 'storyline', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'constantly', 'fact', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'movie', 'more', 'focusing', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'nothing', 'else', 'Forget', 'fact', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie-', 'camera', 'be', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'time', 'attention', 'problem', 'have', 'film-', 'basically', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Show', 'taking', 'place.Just', 'very', 'very', 'below', 'average', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'heck', 'lot', 'better']",Passion of Mind VHS

486456,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6306005153,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 2]","How much one enjoys this film depends greatly on how much of Demi Moore you can stand.  If you like long drawn out schmaltzy romances with Demi as the romantic heroine, you will love this film times two.  Otherwise, hide any weapons lest you begin attacking your screen.This film was toasted by the critics, but I didn't think it was that bad.  In fact, I liked it.  I guess I fall more into the first (sucker for schmaltz) category.  The story was criticized as being a contrived version of ""Me, Myself I"", where a woman is torn over the choice between life as a professional and the family shtick.  That criticism really misses the point.  This is a story about a woman's psychological attempt to deal with her traumatic past and has nothing whatever to do with lifestyle choices.I found this to be an intelligent and complex character study of a woman who seems to be two people living two lives, but really isn't.  If that seems cryptic, see the film and it might become clearer.  When she goes to sleep from her life with her children in France, she wakes up to her high-powered career in New York and vice versa.  She can't determine which is real and which is a fantasy.  She has a lover in each life and both seem very real to her.  As the story unfolds, she and we try to figure out which is her real life and which is the dream.The trouble with the presentation is that its real intrigue lies with the psychodrama.  Unfortunately, neophyte director Alain Berliner pushed that element to the background and cranked up the schmaltz machine, centering the story on the romances instead.  That wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't so interminable.  Scene after scene retraced the same romantic theme, until it became frayed.Other than the misplaced emphasis, the film was well crafted.  There were subtle hints throughout about which was the real life, but they were far from obvious tip-offs.  However, when we finally discover the truth, it takes forever to wrap up the loose ends.  To Berliner's credit, the locations were breathtaking, in both France and New York.  It is easy to find beauty in the French countryside, but these were some of the most wonderful film perspectives I have ever seen of New York's skyline and street vistas.After enjoying a few years as one of the highest paid entertainers on the planet, Demi Moore disappeared for three years.  This was probably not the best vehicle for her return.  Her performance was strongly emotional but one-dimensional, failing to differentiate the characters sufficiently.  She played the high-powered NYC girl to be just as wimpy as the insecure girl in France.  To be fair however, she created two very appealing and vulnerable romantic characters and deserved better notices than she received.William Fichtner was not the greatest choice for her NY love interest.  Fichtner is better at abrasive antagonist roles and his attempts at sensitivity came across as far too pathetic.  Stellan Skarsgard was much better and made a dashing and attractive romantic figure.This was a good story that took a sentimental detour under the guidance of an inexperienced director.  Still, it was engrossing and even touching at times.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you like sentimental pieces and subtract at least two if you aren't a Demi Moore fan.",4,Misguided presentation of an interesting psychodrama,970704000,"10 5, 2000",2000,3314,"['How', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'greatly', 'how', 'much', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'can', 'stand', 'like', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'schmaltzy', 'romances', 'Demi', 'romantic', 'heroine', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'times', 'two', 'Otherwise', 'hide', 'weapons', 'lest', 'begin', 'attacking', 'screen.This', 'film', 'was', 'toasted', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'fact', 'liked', 'guess', 'fall', 'more', 'first', 'sucker', 'schmaltz', 'category', 'story', 'was', 'criticized', 'being', 'contrived', 'version', 'Me', 'Myself', 'where', 'woman', 'torn', 'choice', 'life', 'professional', 'family', 'shtick', 'criticism', 'really', 'point', 'story', 'woman', 'psychological', 'attempt', 'deal', 'traumatic', 'past', 'nothing', 'do', 'lifestyle', 'choices.I', 'found', 'be', 'intelligent', 'complex', 'character', 'study', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'two', 'people', 'living', 'two', 'lives', 'really', ""n't"", 'cryptic', 'see', 'film', 'might', 'become', 'clearer', 'When', 'sleep', 'life', 'children', 'France', 'up', 'high-powered', 'career', 'New', 'York', 'vice', 'versa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'determine', 'real', 'fantasy', 'lover', 'life', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'story', 'unfolds', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'dream.The', 'trouble', 'presentation', 'real', 'intrigue', 'psychodrama', 'Unfortunately', 'neophyte', 'director', 'Alain', 'Berliner', 'pushed', 'element', 'background', 'cranked', 'up', 'schmaltz', 'machine', 'centering', 'story', 'romances', 'instead', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'interminable', 'Scene', 'scene', 'retraced', 'same', 'romantic', 'theme', 'became', 'frayed.Other', 'misplaced', 'emphasis', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'crafted', 'were', 'subtle', 'hints', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'far', 'obvious', 'tip-offs', 'However', 'when', 'finally', 'discover', 'truth', 'forever', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Berliner', 'credit', 'locations', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'France', 'New', 'York', 'easy', 'find', 'beauty', 'French', 'countryside', 'were', 'most', 'wonderful', 'film', 'perspectives', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'New', 'York', 'skyline', 'street', 'vistas.After', 'enjoying', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'highest', 'paid', 'entertainers', 'planet', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'disappeared', 'three', 'years', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'vehicle', 'return', 'performance', 'was', 'strongly', 'emotional', 'one-dimensional', 'failing', 'differentiate', 'characters', 'sufficiently', 'played', 'high-powered', 'NYC', 'girl', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'wimpy', 'insecure', 'girl', 'France', 'be', 'fair', 'however', 'created', 'two', 'very', 'appealing', 'vulnerable', 'romantic', 'characters', 'deserved', 'better', 'notices', 'received.William', 'Fichtner', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'choice', 'NY', 'love', 'interest', 'Fichtner', 'better', 'abrasive', 'antagonist', 'roles', 'attempts', 'sensitivity', 'came', 'far', 'too', 'pathetic', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'made', 'dashing', 'attractive', 'romantic', 'figure.This', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'took', 'sentimental', 'detour', 'guidance', 'inexperienced', 'director', 'Still', 'was', 'engrossing', 'even', 'touching', 'times', 'rated', '7/10', 'Add', 'point', 'like', 'sentimental', 'pieces', 'subtract', 'least', 'two', 'are', ""n't"", 'Demi', 'Moore', 'fan']",Passion of Mind VHS

I certainly don't think so. While it is true the dialog was somewhat mundane and the leading men unsexy, the film really seemed to focus on the question of &quot;what is reality?&quot;The premise of a woman who fragments her personality in her dreams to the point of psychotic delusion is fascinating. Fully functional when awake in either world, at first it is hard to tell which woman, New York Marty or Provence Marie, is the &quot;real&quot; one. But the director carefully controls the colors and temperature of the light. At first, Provence is sunny, warm and misty, New York is blue and cold. Even the skin tones of the actors change with the venue. But as Marty/Marie begins to integrate her personality, the colors shift in the cinematography. Moore is careful not to overact--her Marie or Marty is rather equivocal in her madness or sane-ness. Perhaps the critics wanted more ravings from her.This is a cerebral film; no mad fugues with wild yelling and screaming and blood and guts. Instead, you have to see if you can psychoanalyse the fragmented mind of Marty/Marie and come up with a plausible explanation. If you get it right, you meet the end of the film with cries of &quot;Ha, I knew it!&quot; If you don't get it right, you get a pleasurable surprise.

486459,A3RBIL77ES85WQ,6306005153,Jrobby,"[2, 2]","I bought this movie on the spur of the moment -because my favorite actor, William Fichtner, is in it- and actually enjoyed it. The plot (other reviewers have done a great job of describing it) is developed slowly and methodically, which gives the viewer time to care about the characters and their choices. I have never seen Demi Moore in this type of role (the last movie I saw her in was ""G.I. Jane"") and I think she did a pretty good job. I normally have zero patience for female characters who have the ""problem"" of deciding between two men but ""Passion of Mind"" had such an interesting twist that I didn't mind. The scenery of France is absolutely gorgeous and made the slooooowwww scenes set in France a little easier to sit through. Of course, in the real world a choice between any other man and William Fichtner is a no-brainer, but in this case, I'll make allowances for mental illness, scarred childhoods, and parallel universes. I would recommend ""Passion of Mind"" if you enjoy movies that take a while to unfold and if you are more interested in psychology of love than the usual zippy romantic comedies. If you are looking for a more fast-paced, less psychological romance, definitely pass this one by for ""Sliding Doors"" with Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah.",4,Definitely worth a look,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,1273,"['bought', 'movie', 'spur', 'moment', 'favorite', 'actor', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'it-', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'developed', 'slowly', 'methodically', 'viewer', 'time', 'care', 'characters', 'choices', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'type', 'role', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'G.I', 'Jane', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'normally', 'have', 'zero', 'patience', 'female', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'problem', 'deciding', 'two', 'men', 'Passion', 'Mind', 'had', 'interesting', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'scenery', 'France', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'made', 'slooooowwww', 'scenes', 'set', 'France', 'little', 'easier', 'sit', 'course', 'real', 'world', 'choice', 'other', 'man', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'no-brainer', 'case', ""'ll"", 'make', 'allowances', 'mental', 'illness', 'scarred', 'childhoods', 'parallel', 'universes', 'would', 'recommend', 'Passion', 'Mind', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'take', 'while', 'unfold', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'psychology', 'love', 'usual', 'zippy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'fast-paced', 'less', 'psychological', 'romance', 'definitely', 'pass', 'one', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'John', 'Hannah']",Passion of Mind VHS

Jane and Deconstructing Harry (both 1997) represent the longest amount of time she's ever been away from the big screen.  The good news is that Passion of Mind represents something of a change of pace; the bad news is that it doesn't fulfill the promise of its intriguing premise or the potential of Belgian director, Alain Berliner, who made such an impression with his Golden Globe winning debut, Ma Vie En Rose (1997).Like Sliding Doors (1998), Passion of Mind is about a woman living two lives.  The twist is that she's living both of them at the same time.  In one, she's a single Manhattan businesswoman; in the other, a widowed mother living in the French countryside.  Neither can tell which life is real and which is the dream (and both are so idyllic, it's hard to believe either could be real).  And so Marty/Marie starts seeing a therapist in each life.  She also meets and falls in love with a businessman in New York (William Fitchter) and a writer in France (Stellan Skarsgard).Screenwriters Ron Bass (Snow Falling on Cedars, Entrapment) and David Field have basically written a Hollywood version of a European art house drama and, just as Marty/Marie is unable to reconcile the two halves of her life -- until the end of the movie -- Passion of Mind never quite comes together either as a splashy romance (there's little chemistry between Moore and her on-screen paramours) or as a serious examination of psychological/philosophical dislocation.

But the woman stands slightly apart in each world, never really giving herself over to it.  As if by detaching, she will not be hurt.Demi Moore's performance inPassion of Mindwas truly captivating.  She is believable, vulnerable, and fascinating.Sometimes I hoped that she would finally resolve the fragmentation and end up as ""Marie"" in France, while other times I was rooting for ""Marty,"" the Manhattan career woman.In the end, the pieces gradually fall into place until you wonder why you didn't suspect that everything would turn out this way.As you can tell, I liked it well enough to watch it again and again.

She also writes stories, but hides them from the world. She is living one life in reality and one in her dream world. She alternates between living in N.Y. and France. In France she is Marie. In N.Y. she is Marty. At first, not even the viewer can figure out which life is real.When Marty/Marie falls asleep, she enters a fantasy land of her dreams, fears, sorrows and past pleasures. At some point she looses track of which world is a dream and which one is reality. She wants to live in both worlds because in each she finds significant fulfillment. She wants to figure out which world is real and says:""I don't know how to get back to the way I used to be.""Her fantasy world does not seem to be harming her real life, but her real life seemsto be slowly destroying her fantasy/dream world. In both worlds, she falls in love with a caring man. In France, Marie falls for a writer (Stellan Skarsgard) who says he will fight for her, but keeps reminding her of when she gave his book a bad review. His theory of life is to always do what you wish you could. He wants Marie to love what he writes and to have her think he is amazing.In New York, Marty is a business woman in love with a man (William Fichtner) who says he doesn't want to date her, he just wants to be interested in who she is and enjoy her. Marty asks him if he could ever care about anyone enough to save them from themselves and he proves he can by accepting her totally for who she is.  She finally realizes that he is the man she has been writing all her stories for and gives them to him to read.A beautiful thoughtful movie, especially the scenes in France! To me, this is about women who feel they have too many responsibilities and feel the need to escape to a more peaceful and romantic existence.Anyone who didn't enjoy this movie, has never dreamed about living in France.
