The most obvious and glaring problem with this movie is the ridiculously poor theme song. I've heard a lot of annoying theme songs, but this one is so bad that I just can't fathom how anyone could have allowed it in the movie. The other main flaw has to do with casting. The actors playing the kids do a good job and the actors playing the Japanese soldiers do a good job, but the two leads just don't cut it. It may be poor acting, bad script writing, or bad directing, but something just doesn't click when the two lead actors engage in any kind of dialogue. Every word they say comes across as awkward and unnatural. All that being said, the kids and the actors playing the Japanese soldiers do come through with strong performances, it's just too bad that the two leads couldn't support their efforts a little more. Actually, the director should have just focused more on the kids and left the adults in the background. This movie really deserves to be remade (or if there is enough extra footage, re-edited!).

This is a good movie and we enjoyed it, but I came close to stopping it.  The language is mild by today's non-standards.  To put it in perspective for those like myself searching for entertainment that doesn't teach your children foul language the word ""Hell"" is used 4 times by Elliot Gould which is a pity because that is the only thing that flawed the movie.

807220,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0001I55XS,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 2]","A down on his luck pilot named Noah Dugan, in need of some fast cash to pay off a dangerous gambling debt, takes on the job of flying a wreck of a plane loaded with animals, a female missionary, and two stowaway orphans to a remote island. The group's plans are changed, however, when they end up straying off course and are forced to land on an uncharted island inhabited only by a pair of forgotten Japanese soldiers lost for 35 years and under the impression that WWII is still going on. Befriending the soldiers and learning to get along themselves is only the first part of their struggle, as the group from the ""Noah's Ark"" also must find a way to get back to civilization with only their now permanently grounded plane to use as transportation.Elliott Gould stars as Dugan and Bernadette Lafleur his unlikely love interest in this Disney family adventure from 1980. It also co-starred a very young Ricky Schroeder and Tammy Lauren as the two children taken under Noah's wing. John Fujioka and Yuki Shimoda round out the main cast as the pair of eventually friendly Japanese soldiers. ""The Last Flight of Noah's Ark"" is a film loved by many Disney fans and not so praiseworthy to others. I am afraid I have to fall in the latter group. I happen to be a huge fan of Disney, especially classic Disney, unquestionably including classic Disney live-action. There aren't a lot of classic Disney bigscreen releases I haven't seen yet nor that I haven't seen in a LONG time. When I finally got around to putting in my newly acquired DVD of Disney's Last Flight of Noah's Ark though, I hadn't seen it since I was a child and really didn't have much of an idea what to expect. I was optimistic. I usually love Disney live-action pre-dating the late-90's. There are rare exceptions though when a film is just okay and not, in my opinion, endowed with much ""Disney Magic"". This is one of those times when the film I was watching was definitely just okay. It has its good points, and it has definitely low points. I was very turned off early on by the fact that I didn't really like any of the characters. All they did was bicker. It was flat out irritating. I realize the point of the plot is seeing how all these very different people end up forming a little family when they have no choice, but I just didn't enjoy hearing these people complain constantly, particularly the main stars, Gould and Lafleur. The pair didn't really have much chemistry to me either. The kids at least were great actors (though I still found Schroeder's bickering irritating, while I normally don't like Lauren but she is a total sweetheart here), and the Japanese soldier characters were both excellent actors and fun characters. They definitely added a lot to this movie. There are fun and exciting moments too, including a part with a shark, but there were also times when I felt I didn't get enough info. The situation with the gambling debt is never resolved. There's a scene where they are about to kill a pet steer to put him out of his misery, but he is fine moments later after the execution is thankfully interrupted. And I'm forgetting some stuff as well, I'm sure. The worst thing about ""Last Flight of Noah's Ark"" though, is the horrible late 70's/early 80's theme song. Ugh. It is painful to endure. Frankly, after seeing this, I'm very worried about how I'm going to feel when I finally acquire and view Gould's other Disney film from a year later, ""The Devil and Max Devlin"". At least that one co-stars a young Bill Cosby though.The DVD release of Last Flight of Noah's Ark doesn't fair much better in my review. The print is too dark and there are no bonus features unless you count the option of fullscreen or non-anamorphic widescreen. At least we do get a widescreen option. I've actually seen worse Disney live-action catalog releases.When all is said and done, this isn't an unwatchable film. As I said, it has its good points, but as a Disney live-action classic, for me it's near the bottom of the list. Pros: A good message, some good acting, a few good scenes and ideas. Cons, a difficult to believe romance between stars I found irritating (it seemed like they were going for a Han Solo kinda thing with Gould's character, but it just wasn't working for me, nothing against him), a story that felt a little anticlimactic and had some holes, and an absolutely horrendous theme song. I'd say give this one a watch if there is something drawing you to it, whether it's a cast member, the fact that it is a Disney film, or whatever else. There is a fair chance you will be in the group that loves this film. It seems to be an even split. But, I don't think you will find it anything groundbreaking at any rate. It's fair enough as simple but not too fantastic family entertainment, but there are much better out there under the Disney name. Try a Dean Jones, Hayley Mills, Tommy Kirk, Kurt Russell, or Fred MacMurray selection instead. Save this one for after you've seen all those Disney classics.",3,"One of the less satisfying Disney live-action ""classics"".",1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,4996,"['down', 'luck', 'pilot', 'named',
