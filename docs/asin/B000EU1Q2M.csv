People who are expecting stunning visual effects should just stick with the feature films.  The show was meant to just be an entertaining romp of fun.  I liked all the characters.  I love the fact that they honored the creators of Superman in the series going to Schuster University.  John Haymes Newton seriously looks the part and I think plays the part well.  Regardless that he got replaced in season 2, he still got the series off to a good start.  The Salkinds are the masterminds behind the Superman movies and this series.

The writing and acting are uniformly mediocre, with only a handful of decent shows spread throughout the season.  Yes, the flying effects are usually on par with the Christopher Reeve films, but the rest of the effects are embarassingly low-budget, largely comprised of obvious animation added to the live action.Like I said, I'm a fan.

978727,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000EU1Q2M,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 5]","Many people nowadays who are fans or are familiar with the decade long running series ""Smallville"", may not know that another series about the exploits and adventures of Superman as a teen beat them to the punch some 13 years earlier. Premiering in 1988, ""Superboy"" ran for 4 seasons and had over 100 episodes.The series takes place at Shuster University(named after one of Superman's creators, Joe Shuster) and follows the lives of a young Clark Kent(John Haymes Newton), his childhood friend from Smallville Lana Lang(Stacy Haiduk), and his friend T.J. White(Jim Calvert), son of Daily Planet editor Perry and the show's obvious 'Jimmy Olsen'. Clark/Superboy and his friends fight different kinds of bad guys, all the while attending school with Supes' biggest future enemy, Lex Luthor(Scott James Wells).""Superboy"" was a syndicated show, so the budget for the series was probably not very high. Unfortunately, this made for some weak special effects and some cheap looking sets. Everything got better as the series went on, but the early stages of the show definitely had some kinks still to undo. The writing was not always up to par either. Some of the dialogue could be quite stilted and obvious, and you could see the pained reaction on some of the actors' faces. Acting-wise, the show was kind of wobbly there too. John Haymes Newton passes with flying colors though. Christopher Reeve is and always will be Superman, but Haymes Newton does an admirable job in the dual roles of Clark and Superboy. He looks great in both parts and does a good job of seperating the two in his scenes as the two. It's too bad he was replaced after this season. Gerard Christopher, who replaced him, was good, but Haymes Newton was a lot better. Stacy Haiduk does what she can with what is essentially the ""girl"" of the group who gets into trouble. Seeing this show again for the first time in nearly 20  years brings back memories of how she was one of my childhood crushes. She did give off a great vibe of sweetness and being innocent, but strong and flirty/sexy as well. Plus, she has the most amazing eyes. Wells, however, comes off quite hammy as Luthor, as if he is acting in an overdramatic school play. The show was produced by the Salkinds, who brought us the Christopher Reeve movies, so some of the physical flying of Superman is still cool. Done like in the Reeves movies. Nothing beats a real human on wires. I'm looking at you today's CGI!Some of the highlights of season 1 include the two part episode ""Revenge Of The Alien"", which features Jonathan Kent being taken over by a being from outer space. Michael J. Pollard as classic comic book villain Mr.Mxyzptlk in the episode ""Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk"". Joaquin Phoenix, going as 'Leaf', appears as a child genius in ""Little Hercules"". A return to 1939 Hollywood in, well, ""Hollywood"". A classic telling of how Lex becomes bald and his vengeance on Superboy in ""Luther Unleashed"". Another good one is a thief committing crimes as Superboy in ""The Beast And Beauty"". 26 episodes in all. The DVD set also comes with an 11 minute documentary with the three main stars and producer Ilya Salkind. This could of been longer and much better. Plus, you get John Haymes Newton's screen test.""Superboy"" will probably not go down as a huge shining beacon in the legacy of Superman. Can I recommend this a strong addition to the superhero sci-fi/adventure genre? Not exactly. Like I said earlier, the writing is weak at times, some of the acting questionable, and a lot of the effects leave a lot to be desired. But still, I am a fan and a Superman fan. What I can do is recommend this as a fun, amusing, campy piece of entertainment in the long history of Superman. Come on Warners!

978728,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000EU1Q2M,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[16, 18]","""Superboy"" has been a long-neglected chapter of the 'Superman' saga, due, in large part, to Warner Bros., who refused, with a few exceptions, to allow the four-season series to be re-syndicated or marketed for 14 years (after winning a court ruling against Alexander and Ilya Salkind, long-time 'Superman' franchise producers). Fortunately, the WB has finally released the first season on DVD (in conjunction with the release of ""Superman Returns""), and, despite some obvious 'growing pains' in plot and execution, the series certainly is a worthy addition to any fan's library!Filmed at the Disney/MGM Studios in Orlando, the first season of the half-hour series offered hunky John Haymes Newton, 22 (cast because of a resemblance to Christopher Reeve), as the Shuster University Journalism student/Superhero, with wholesomely sexy Stacy Haiduk, 20 (Newton's offscreen girlfriend) as his friend (who could be more), Lana Lang. Rounding out the 'regulars' was mop-topped Jim Calvert as 'Jimmy Olsen'-like T.J. White (nephew of Perry), who provided some welcome lightness and humor to the proceedings.The first episodes appear rushed and routine (the introduction of occasional guest star Scott Wells as snobbish, evil 'frat boy' Lex Luthor is poorly-acted and disappointing), and, sadly, many critics who panned the series never looked beyond those episodes, to the later, more polished stories, penned by veteran 'Superman' comic book writers. Those episodes (particularly the introduction of impish Mr. Mxyzptlk, portrayed by a perfectly-cast Michael J. Pollard), show the promise of the VERY good series ""Superboy"" would become, in time.""Superboy"" would foreshadow ""Smallville"", highlighting the bonds of young Clark to his adopted parents (portrayed by the excellent Stuart Whitman and Salome Jens), his small-town roots and sense of integrity, and the frustration of an attraction to Lana that he cannot consummate, because of the secrets he keeps. Newton, while lacking the smoldering sex appeal of Tom Welling, is very likable, and is far closer in age and personality to the character he portrays than either Welling, or Gerard Christopher (who would assume the role in Season Two of ""Superboy"").Sadly, a combination of publicized scrapes with the local police (he seemed to drive at super-speed!), and salary demands would cost Newton the role after the first season, and most fans prefer Christopher's 'take' on the character, but this, to me, makes this collection even more 'special'. Comparing actor portrayals is a lot of the fun of the various incarnations of 'Krypton's Last Son', and Newton is certainly worth watching...Give this collection a chance, and I think you will like it, on its own merits, and as the introduction of a long-absent chapter in the 'Superman' story!",3,First Season of 'Boy of Steel' Worth Owning...,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2791,"['Superboy', 'been', 'long-neglected', 'chapter', ""'Superman"", 'saga', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'who', 'refused', 'few', 'exceptions', 'allow', 'four-season', 'series', 'be', 're-syndicated', 'marketed', '14', 'years', 'winning', 'court', 'ruling', 'Alexander', 'Ilya', 'Salkind', 'long-time', ""'Superman"", 'franchise', 'producers', 'Fortunately', 'WB', 'finally', 'released', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'conjunction', 'release', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'obvious', ""'growing"", 'pains', 'plot', 'execution', 'series', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'addition', 'fan', 'library', 'Filmed', 'Disney/MGM', 'Studios', 'Orlando', 'first', 'season', 'half-hour', 'series', 'offered', 'hunky', 'John', 'Haymes', 'Newton', '22', 'cast', 'resemblance', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Shuster', 'University', 'Journalism', 'student/Superhero', 'wholesomely', 'sexy', 'Stacy', 'Haiduk', '20', 'Newton', 'offscreen', 'girlfriend', 'friend', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Rounding', 'out', ""'regulars"", 'was', 'mop-topped', 'Jim', 'Calvert', ""Olsen'-like"", 'T.J.', 'White', 'nephew', 'Perry', 'who', 'provided', 'welcome', 'lightness', 'humor', 'proceedings.The', 'first', 'appear', 'rushed', 'routine', 'introduction', 'occasional', 'guest', 'star', 'Scott', 'Wells', 'snobbish', 'evil', 'boy', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'poorly-acted', 'disappointing', 'sadly', 'many', 'critics', 'who', 'panned', 'series', 'never', 'looked', 'episodes', 'later', 'more', 'polished', 'stories', 'penned', 'veteran', ""'Superman"", 'comic', 'book', 'writers', 'episodes', 'particularly', 'introduction', 'impish', 'Mr.', 'Mxyzptlk', 'portrayed', 'perfectly-cast', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Pollard', 'show', 'promise', 'VERY', 'good', 'series', 'Superboy', 'would', 'become', 'time', 'Superboy', 'would', 'foreshadow', 'Smallville', 'highlighting', 'bonds', 'young', 'Clark', 'adopted', 'parents', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'Salome', 'Jens', 'small-town', 'roots', 'sense', 'integrity', 'frustration', 'attraction', 'Lana', 'can', 'not', 'consummate', 'secrets', 'Newton', 'lacking', 'smoldering', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'very', 'likable', 'far', 'closer', 'age', 'personality', 'character', 'Welling', 'Gerard', 'Christopher', 'who', 'would', 'assume', 'role', 'Season', 'Two', 'Superboy', '.Sadly', 'combination', 'publicized', 'scrapes', 'local', 'police', 'seemed', 'drive', 'super-speed', 'salary', 'demands', 'would', 'cost', 'Newton', 'role', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'fans', 'prefer', 'Christopher', ""'take"", 'character', 'collection', 'even', 'more', ""'special"", 'Comparing', 'actor', 'portrayals', 'lot', 'fun', 'various', 'incarnations', ""'Krypton"", 'Last', 'Son', 'Newton', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'Give', 'collection', 'chance', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'own', 'merits', 'introduction', 'long-absent', 'chapter', ""'Superman"", 'story']",ADVENTURES OF SUPERBOY S1 (FF)(DVD)(4Pk)

M Torres ""chator4""","[1, 1]","The events in ""Superboy"" are post-Smallville, when Clark Kent (John Haymes Newman) moves away from home to attend Shuster University as a journalism major with classmate Lana Lang (Stacy Haiduk). Intrigues at Shuster force Clark to adopt the alter-ego of Superboy. In this series' first season, Superboy first comes face to face with what become in the comics, Superman's arch-enemies, Lex Luthor (as a college student) and Mr. Mxyzptlk (hillarious performance by Michael J. Pollard-excellent casting choice). We learn how Clark develops a contact at Shuster (T.J. White, son of Perry White-editor for the Daily Planet) that will eventually lead to his job at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. We also get the story of how Luthor looses his hair, how he discovers Kryptonite as a deadly weapon to use against Superboy, and Superboy's first encounter with this deadly substance. Of course, these stories have already been told and re-told in different ways. But here we get another version of them.I agree with prior posters that the first season suffered from poor writing, poor special effects and weak villians. On the plus side, John Haymes Newman makes the best ""Man of Steel"" since Christopher Reeve, much better than Dean Cain or Brandon Routh, I would have liked to have seen him succeed Reeve in the Superman role. This set of discs includes Newman's hillarious screen test, interviews with former cast members, producer Ilya Salkind, as well as a sneek-peek at the new Ken Burns documentary on the Man of Steel, ""Look Up in the Sky.""",3,Superboy isn't Superman,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1540,"['events', 'Superboy', 'are', 'post-Smallville', 'when', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'John', 'Haymes', 'Newman', 'away', 'home', 'attend', 'Shuster', 'University', 'journalism', 'major', 'classmate', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Stacy', 'Haiduk', 'Intrigues', 'Shuster', 'force', 'Clark', 'adopt', 'alter-ego', 'Superboy', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'Superboy', 'first', 'face', 'face', 'what', 'become', 'comics', 'Superman', 'arch-enemies', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'college', 'student', 'Mr.', 'Mxyzptlk', 'hillarious', 'performance', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Pollard-excellent', 'casting', 'choice', 'learn', 'how', 'Clark', 'contact', 'Shuster', 'T.J.', 'White', 'son', 'Perry', 'White-editor', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'Metropolis', 'also', 'get', 'story', 'how', 'Luthor', 'hair', 'how', 'Kryptonite', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'use', 'Superboy', 'Superboy', 'first', 'encounter', 'deadly', 'substance', 'course', 'stories', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'told', 're-told', 'different', 'ways', 'here', 'get', 'version', 'them.I', 'agree', 'prior', 'posters', 'first', 'season', 'suffered', 'poor', 'writing', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'weak', 'villians', 'plus', 'side', 'John', 'Haymes', 'Newman', 'best', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'much', 'better', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'succeed', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'role', 'set', 'discs', 'Newman', 'hillarious', 'screen', 'test', 'interviews', 'former', 'cast', 'members', 'producer', 'Ilya', 'Salkind', 'as', 'well', 'sneek-peek', 'new', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Look', 'Up', 'Sky']",ADVENTURES OF SUPERBOY S1 (FF)(DVD)(4Pk)

My local paper had a picture of John Haymes Newton looking very much like Christopher Reeve (something that didn't happen so much on the show itself)so I wasn't sure what to expect.I was mildly disappointed with the first season. Newton made a decent Clark Kent/Superboy more in the mold of George Reeves,playing a much tougher Clark. It was the plots that I found to be a letdown. Once they started bringing in comic book writers the show improved greatly.I am definitely looking forward to seasons 2-4.

The only thing that concerns me is that people may watch this first season and be put off by poor acting and not-so-exciting scripts and villains. Please believe me when I say that this series did indeed keep getting better every season. This season John Haymes Newton played the part of Superboy and Scott Wells plays, in my opinion, a very poor Lex Luthor.Next season Gerard Christopher takes over as Superboy. Sherman Howard takes over wonderfully as the new Lex Luthor. Mr. Howard is a marvelous Lex Luthor. We also see comic book villains such as Bizarro and Metallo. Gone is TJ White and in his place is Andy McAlister who also leaves the show after the second season when Clark and Lana work in the Bureau of Extranormal Matters. Stacy Haiduk is one of the only characters who remain the same.The first year's special effects were not so great, but beginning in the second season many of the flying sequences rival the Superman movies. The scripts are MUCH better, the stories are much more exciting. And the best part is that this is one of the few shows where the show does get better and better each season. By the time you get to the third season you'll hardly believe it's the same show. The producers seemed to want to distance themselves from the first season because they renamed the show ""The Adventures of Superboy"". With just about a complete cast change by the third season, it does not seem to be the same show at all.I urge everyone who is interested in this series to purchase it on DVD so that the remaining seasons will be released.

I was 10 when it premiered, and it's what got me into a life of comic-book collecting.The one thing that gets me the most about this show is the nostalgic factor.  While I watched every single episode when it first aired, this show was never available in syndication after its initial run and it's left me nothing but memories - until now.Yes, the acting is pretty bad.  In many of the scenes the actors will fumble on their lines.  Yes, the special effects were terrible, and even I could see that at age 10.  And yes, the stories are pretty pedestrian.But as I started watching the DVD's, I realized I couldn't stop.  Something about this series was magical.  Maybe it was it's innocence, maybe it was the fact that it felt like it was trying really, really hard.  And maybe its because we'll never get a series like this again.I have to wonder if there's a camp factor to this first season that people watching the original ""Batman"" series 20 years ago would have felt.  I can't say for sure, all I can say is that I've had a pretty good time watching this set.Let's hope this one does well so that we'll get to see seasons 2, 3, and 4.

I am aware of the earlier (1940s/50s) Superman TV series', however, I wanted to see something a bit more modern (post 1978 &#34;Superman&#34; movie), and found this.I should note, if you are new to watching the Superboy/man television series, I would advise watching this series first, followed by &#34;Lois and Clark,&#34; and lastly &#34;Smallville.&#34;  I unfortunately watched them in reverse order, and by far the best of these 3 is Smallville.I found the first season of Superboy to be a bit campy.  However, when you look at the period it was filmed (late 80s), you'll forgive its campiness and unnecessary scripted dialogue.  Television in the late 80s were still focused around family entertainment, and did not &#34;push&#34; the boundaries of reality as in the late 90s, neither were special effects as cutting edge.  So I found this season to fit right into that time period.In viewing this series, you would also have to not relate it to classic Superman mythology.  In the 1978 Christopher Reeves movie version of Superman, we see that the world only discovered Superman after he became an adult.  This series however, introduces him as a boy/young adult (since I don't think we can technically call someone attending their first year of college a boy) to the world as Superboy.  Although the series creators are the same from the 1978 movie, this series tends to negate the movie, so it must be watched in a &#34;stand-alone&#34; capacity.Clark Kent, along with Lana Lang (his childhood crush) are in their first year of college.  The series does not go much into Clark Kent's discovering of his abilities as the &#34;Smallville&#34; series does, it just seemed to be assumed that he had always had them.  Also, it showed he had a relationship with Lex Luthor, contrary to the one shown in the Superman movie.  It also introduced us to his college roommate, T.J.

Thus it came as a complete surprise to me that there even was a SUPERBOY series, let alone four seasons of it. I discovered it while looking for the third season of LOIS & CLARK and grabbed it immediately. I gather there are political and/or business reasons why the show was never shown beyond the initial airing. Whatever, I'm finding it a treat to watch the show now. (Actually it's a lot more fun than LOIS & CLARK, since that series degenerated into a soap opera by the third season. Why the idiots-that-be decided Clark and Lois should become engaged, let alone that she should discover his secret identity, I'll never know. They didn't consult me on this.)The acting in SUPERBOY mostly is good, if occasionally wooden. The FX and productions values are fine (although I have caught the shadow of a crane when Superboy landed in a field, and in another shot, a microphone is clearly visible for several seconds). The stories and characters are fun.What I find puzzling about the Warner Brothers release of the first season is that there is no pilot episode: nothing to explain why Lana Lang, Clark Kent and Lex Luthor have all migrated from Smallville and have converged on a university in Florida! And how did Perry White's son, TJ, from Metropolis end up there, too, and as Clark's roommate?Bigger question: in the episode where Pa Kent is injured in a tractor accident and is in the hospital, why does Clark take an Eastern Airlines flight and a bus to get to Smallville when he could have just ditched the Clark Kent disguise and flown? Or hadn't he earned his interstate flying license at that point?The shows in the DVD set are theoretically in the order in which they aired, but they're often out of sequence chronologically. For example, in about the fifth episode, after Superboy has rescued Lana and TJ several times, suddenly no one has ever seen him before. And TJ's hairstyle goes back and forth a few times, as do the opening credits.All this carping aside, this is a fun series. The full four seasons are available in a set elsewhere, but not through Amazon. There are no bonus features, however. But then considering the inane bantering between Ilya Salkind and John Newton in the two commentaries in Warner Brothers' first season set, that's no big loss.",4,Fun!,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,2384,"['gave', 'up', 'watching', 'television', '1963', 'having', 'spent', 'majority', 'teen', 'years', 'glued', 'tube', 'Thus', 'came', 'complete', 'surprise', 'even', 'was', 'SUPERBOY', 'series', 'let', 'alone', 'four', 'seasons', 'discovered', 'looking', 'third', 'season', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'grabbed', 'immediately', 'gather', 'are', 'political', 'and/or', 'business', 'reasons', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'initial', 'airing', 'Whatever', ""'m"", 'finding', 'treat', 'watch', 'show', 'now', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'series', 'degenerated', 'soap', 'opera', 'third', 'season', 'Why', 'idiots-that-be', 'decided', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'should', 'become', 'engaged', 'let', 'alone', 'should', 'discover', 'secret', 'identity', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'consult', 'acting', 'SUPERBOY', 'mostly', 'good', 'occasionally', 'wooden', 'FX', 'productions', 'values', 'are', 'fine', 'have', 'caught', 'shadow', 'crane', 'when', 'Superboy', 'landed', 'field', 'shot', 'microphone', 'clearly', 'visible', 'several', 'seconds', 'stories', 'characters', 'are', 'fun.What', 'find', 'puzzling', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'pilot', 'episode', 'nothing', 'explain', 'why', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'have', 'migrated', 'Smallville', 'have', 'converged', 'university', 'Florida', 'how', 'did', 'Perry', 'White', 'son', 'TJ', 'Metropolis', 'end', 'up', 'there', 'too', 'Clark', 'roommate', 'Bigger', 'question', 'episode', 'where', 'Pa', 'Kent', 'injured', 'tractor', 'accident', 'hospital', 'why', 'Clark', 'take', 'Eastern', 'Airlines', 'flight', 'bus', 'get', 'Smallville', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'ditched', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'disguise', 'flown', 'had', ""n't"", 'earned', 'interstate', 'flying', 'license', 'point', 'shows', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'theoretically', 'order', 'aired', ""'re"", 'often', 'sequence', 'chronologically', 'example', 'fifth', 'episode', 'Superboy', 'rescued', 'Lana', 'TJ', 'several', 'times', 'suddenly', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'TJ', 'hairstyle', 'back', 'few', 'times', 'do', 'opening', 'credits.All', 'carping', 'aside', 'fun', 'series', 'full', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'available', 'set', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'Amazon', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'however', 'then', 'considering', 'inane', 'bantering', 'Ilya', 'Salkind', 'John', 'Newton', 'two', 'commentaries', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'big', 'loss']",ADVENTURES OF SUPERBOY S1 (FF)(DVD)(4Pk)

Trying to get into it now was kind of hard. It has a super low budget look and looks like it was shot with a hand held camera sometimes.  However I respect it. It does succeed in telling the story of Superboy even if it is a little cheesey. Plus I  like in an episode how Lex is bulling a student to lose a basketball game so he wins a bet and Clark uses his super breath from a distantance to blow Lex into water behind him. Which gave me a nice thought...why can't Clark ever do that in Smallville. I mean Lex and Lana are kissing infront of a fountain or something and he blows them into it to get a laugh. Clark in Smallville doesn't have a sense of humor like that though. He just whines and complains ""Chloe, Lex stole Lana"", ""Chloe...Lana was mean to me"". It bugs me how he takes how Lana treats him after he saved her life a million times.Which brings me to the Lana in Superboy. She isn't over emotional and doesn't always bug Superboy to have a serious and waste of time emotional talk kinda like Lana does with Clark in Smallville in pretty much every episode!... Stacy Haiduk may not have Kristin Kreuk's sexy looks but she's still a cute Lana and...a less annoying Lana. Probably because the writer's of Superboy don't worship her as much as the writer's of Smallville. They focus on the story of Superboy while Smallville uses Lana so much that I'm starting think it's more of the coming of age story of Lana than it is Clark..Superboy doesn't have Smallville's budget to say the least but at least it's not a little too Dawson Creeekish like Smallville.

978771,A3RPC62B9NMQ6V,B000EU1Q2M,Matt MN,"[112, 117]","I first watched this series growing up in the 80's - I was eight years old when it premiered in syndication.  To me, it is *the* definitive version of Superman/Superboy.  Looking back on it, nearly 20 years later, it hasn't held up as well as I remember it - but, it still gets five stars for pure nostalgia reasons.I thought John Newton was much better as Clark/Superman than Gerard Christopher (both actors appeared later on Melrose Place).  Newton brought a realness to Clark - a regular guy who skateboarded and lifted weights with his buddies.  However, Christopher took Chris Reeve's interpretation and turned it up to 11 - displaying Urkel-level nerdiness.  Thankfully his Clark was toned down a bit after season 2.Unfortunately, the first season suffers from a number of weak villains.  Too often, Superboy found himself pitted against wealthy land developers, cops gone bad, polluters, and old guys in junkyards suffering from World War II shell shock.  The villains got much better in later seasons.  Still, there are a number of standouts in the first year - the introduction of Kryponite, Mr. Mxyzptlk, battling a succubus, time traveling to Hollywood's golden era, etc. I like how certain elements from the movie franchise were melded with John Byrne's reinvention (Clark's father being alive in this version, etc.)  Incidentally, Martha is played by Salome Jens, who would go on to menace Deep Space 9 as leader of the changelings in the Dominion War. Another strength of the series was the impressive wire-work.  Take offs and landings were typically done well (using many people who worked on the Superman movies) and were very ambitious - much better than the ""whip pan"" cape over camera effect used in Lois and Clark to ""depict"" take offs.I really hope people aren't put off by some of the plots of the first season.  For seasons 2-4, a number of comic book writers came on the show and infused a fun sense of adventure into the stories (not to mention Sherman Howard's maniacal portrayal of Lex Luthor - my personal favorite live action version yet!)  In addition, later seasons would see the show adopting a proto-X-Files format where Clark and Lana would investigate paranormal matters.  Noel Neill and Jack Larson (Lois and Jimmy from the original show) even make a cameo!  Please support this series on DVD - otherwise we may never get the later seasons released!Now if Warner would release the 13 episode 50th anniversary Superman cartoon produced by Ruby/Spears (and written by Marv Wolfman) for CBS, I would be a very happy camper.",5,Superboy - Finally on DVD nearly 20 years later!,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2557,"['first', 'watched', 'series', 'growing', 'up', '80', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'premiered', 'syndication', '*the*', 'definitive', 'version', 'Superman/Superboy', 'Looking', 'back', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'later', ""n't"", 'held', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'remember', 'still', 'five', 'stars', 'pure', 'nostalgia', 'reasons.I', 'thought', 'John', 'Newton', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Clark/Superman', 'Gerard', 'Christopher', 'actors', 'appeared', 'later', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Newton', 'brought', 'realness', 'Clark', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'skateboarded', 'lifted', 'weights', 'buddies', 'However', 'Christopher', 'took', 'Chris', 'Reeve', 'interpretation', 'turned', '11', 'displaying', 'Urkel-level', 'nerdiness', 'Thankfully', 'Clark', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'season', '2.Unfortunately', 'first', 'season', 'suffers', 'number', 'weak', 'villains', 'Too', 'often', 'Superboy', 'found', 'pitted', 'wealthy', 'land', 'developers', 'gone', 'bad', 'polluters', 'old', 'guys', 'junkyards', 'suffering', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'shell', 'shock', 'villains', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'later', 'seasons', 'Still', 'are', 'number', 'standouts', 'first', 'year', 'introduction', 'Kryponite', 'Mr.', 'Mxyzptlk', 'battling', 'succubus', 'time', 'traveling', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'era', 'etc', 'how', 'certain', 'elements', 'movie', 'franchise', 'were', 'melded', 'John', 'Byrne', 'reinvention', 'Clark', 'father', 'being', 'alive', 'version', 'etc', 'Incidentally', 'Martha', 'played', 'Salome', 'Jens', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'menace', 'Deep', 'Space', '9', 'leader', 'changelings', 'Dominion', 'War', 'strength', 'series', 'was', 'impressive', 'wire-work', 'Take', 'offs', 'landings', 'were', 'typically', 'done', 'well', 'using', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Superman', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'ambitious', 'much', 'better', 'whip', 'pan', 'cape', 'camera', 'effect', 'used', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'depict', 'take', 'offs.I', 'really', 'hope', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'plots', 'first', 'season', 'seasons', '2-4', 'number', 'comic', 'book', 'writers', 'came', 'show', 'infused', 'fun', 'sense', 'adventure', 'stories', 'not', 'mention', 'Sherman', 'Howard', 'maniacal', 'portrayal', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'personal', 'favorite', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'yet', 'addition', 'later', 'seasons', 'would', 'see', 'show', 'adopting', 'proto-X-Files', 'format', 'where', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'would', 'investigate', 'paranormal', 'matters', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'Jack', 'Larson', 'Lois', 'Jimmy', 'original', 'show', 'even', 'make', 'cameo', 'Please', 'support', 'series', 'DVD', 'otherwise', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'later', 'seasons', 'released', 'Now', 'Warner', 'would', 'release', '13', 'episode', '50th', 'anniversary', 'Superman', 'cartoon', 'produced', 'Ruby/Spears', 'written', 'Marv', 'Wolfman', 'CBS', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'camper']",ADVENTURES OF SUPERBOY S1 (FF)(DVD)(4Pk)

Many fans of the show seem to prefer the later seasons of Superboy, and Gerard Christopher's portrayal of the character. I watched this show as a kid, and only picked the show near the end of it's televised run. I had seen clips from the first season online, and to be honest, I wasn't sure whether or not I would like it. But I gave this season a chance, and was delightfully surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The first few episodes aren't top notch, but as the season continued it was obvious that the show was gaining momentum. I actually found myself preferring John Haymes Newton's portrayal over Gerard Christopher's portrayal of Superboy. People call this show cheesy, and it is. At the same time, I have to point out that this is a children's show. So it's not supposed to be taken too seriously. All in all I was happy with the set. There aren't a lot of extras, but I knew that going in. Though the extras you do get are really good.

I'm a huge Superman fan, and don't remember this one which is surprising to me as I've always loved the Superman mythology. As a Superman and an adult who was a kid in the 80's I'm glad I discovered this show. I just got it in a few days ago, even though it is very ""80s"" I believe that adds some nostalgic value to the show! As someone else mentioned, the first 12 episodes were low budget, but it seems as starting with episode 13 it takes on a whole new feel, less campy and more cinematic which is a great thing.Any Superman fan will ove this, a great addition to the Superman mytholgogy.

Released to DVD for the first time on June 20, 2006 (along with several other Superman-related DVDs) as a tie-in to the big screen release ofSuperman Returns, Superboy - The Complete First Season is a 4-disc (558 min.) set featuring all 26 episodes in Full Frame (1.33:1) video, Dolby Digital English Stereo audio, French & Spanish subtitles. The super extras include ""Superboy: Getting Off The Ground"" featurette with the cast and creators (11:10), Commentaries on 2 key episodes by Superboy himself, John Haymes Newton and executive producer Ilya Salkind; John Haymes Newton Screen Test (6:53); plusLook, Up in the Sky - The Amazing Story of Superman(excerpts from the 2006 documentary produced by ""Superman Returns"" director Bryan Singer and documentary filmmaker Kevin Burns) (6:27). The episodes are complete & uncut, feature a likeable cast and greatly benefit in having the wire men from theChristopher Reeve Supermanfilms led by Bob Harman provide the on location flying effects. Not to mention the following guest stars: Douglas Barr, George Chakiris, Courtney Gaines, Leif Garrett, James Hampton, Salome Jens, Michael Landon Jr., James MacArthur, Doug McClure, Greg Morris, Curly Neal, Gail O'Grady, Joaquin Phoenix, Michael J. Pollard, Sonny Shroyer, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Liz Vassey, Abe Vigoda, Ray Walston, Stuart Whitman.Despite the show's campy presentation, Superboy - The Complete First Season (well-packaged by Warner Home Video) is a must for any true Superman collection. Stacy Haiduk (who played the lovely Lana Lang) sums it up best: ""There's a kitsch value to the first season. It's sweet. It's innocent. It's like the comic books"".Episodes include:1.

However, one large caveat exists: Stay away from the first season!  The special effects are never spectacular, the plots are more often then not boring, and the acting is sub-par.  While Stacy Haiduk plays a great Lana Lang, John Newton's Clark/Superboy and Scott Well's Lex Luthor are wooden, one-dimensional characters who do not draw you into the plotlines.Obviously, the writers/producers of the show must have felt the same way I do, as after the first season the Clark/Superboy part was recast and given to Gerard Christopher, while Lex Luthor was switched to Sherman Howard, both enormous upgrades.  From that point, the show really began to take off.My advice, then, is to not waste your time on these episodes.  If you are a true Superman fan who has never seen this show before, wait for the release of the second season (whenever that will be...hopefully soon).
