Andersen,"[2, 7]",Both Michael Jeter and Michael Duncan give stellar supporting performances as death row prisoners during the Depression in this odd mixture of drama and fantasy - the latter was deservedly Oscar nominated for his performance  as the man with miraculous powers.

It was  surprisingly nominated for Best Film (not deserving) and Screenplay as well  as the nod to Duncan.

36383,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,0780628799,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[1, 3]","The Green Mile is a film set on death row and focuses on two main characters:  a guard (Tom Hanks) and a prisoner (Michael Duncan). And with the throwing in of the inevitable King supernatural twist, is overall well  done.  The only believability flaw I saw was the fact that the death row  guards were all compassionate except for Percy, the one mean misfit guard.  I think James Woods' film, &quot;Killer: a Journal of Murder&quot; depicted  the real death row:  brutal guards and maybe one oddball compassionate one.  Michael Duncan was great as Jon Coffey, sentenced to Old Sparky for  the brutal murder of 2 girls.  I think the story line was (perhaps  subconsciously) based on the crucifixion of Christ who (they say) died for  the world's sins.  You may notice some age discrepancies through the film,  but King (who is notorious for bad Math) must have realized his mistake and  made up an ending that &quot;fixes&quot; it.  Obviously the story's  logistics got a bit tangled as the serial novel went on.  Probably it would  have been better had it not been framed as a flashback.

And if someone is not an egoist, he better think a lot before simply adding another review. Egoist or not, I feel I have something to add for this movie.Tom Hanks always presents very good movies, technically good, not necessarily tasty or flavored, but well-made movies. However, I don't think that he added anything to the cinema after Forrest Gump and Apollo 13 (I didn't see Road to Perdition yet). This one is not an exception; it gathers an excellent novel, well picked actors and very careful re-creational technique.But the movie is a fairy tale, with personalities of black and white, pure evils and pure saints, and in order to smartly cover this defect (unfortunately it is presented as defect in the movie), some salt and pepper have been added, like the funny attitude of Graham Greene, the wonderful presentation of the mouse, or the skillfully embedded indication to corruption.If you would not be motivated by compassion with this movie, the logic would force you to under-estimate it. It is too much of sophistication to present a fairy tale and it is nothing like real pain, real determination and real hope of The Shawshank Redemption (oops, I didn't really wanted to repeat what is mentioned in at least 100 reviews, so, I mentioned the opposite).Yet you do not get board watching this lengthened movie, you will admittedly enjoy the building of the characters, get amazed by the great techniques in reviving the life of the 30's in prison and in outside life (the visit to the lawyer for example) and convince your self  that adults need fairy tales to boost their structure.There are movies that are made to remind us why we go to the cinema; after all, cinema is part of the intellectual creativity that we should incorporate to eventually improve our relations as persons and as societies.

36385,ADLZQVXVVM647,0780628799,A J Mulder,"[0, 0]","I have got to admit that this is one of the best movies I have seen ever!.  Not only has Stephen King written a great novel based on &quot;The Green Mile&quot; but through his great imagination and mind he has created what would be called one of the best movies of the decade. I am a big fan of Stephen King and I have loved &quot;The Green Mile&quot; &quot;The Green Mile&quot; being based in a prison in the 1930s where the main character (tom hanks) is in charge of his own block of prisoners. It eventually leads up to a black guy (cant remember his name) coming into the prison and eventually they find out that this black guy is a miracle worker from god.  One of the patrolman is seen as cruel and nasty towards the fellow prisoners in the cells. In one scene he is carrying around a baton. One of the prisoners has his hands on the poles in the jail and is laughing at the nasty patrolman (as u can see I am very crap when it comes to remembering names in a movie, bad memory on my part). The nasty patrolman then wacks his hand, which is out in the open, with the baton and actually breaks his fingers.  I think I best stop at that otherwise I will ruin the movie for a lot of people, another star character in the movie &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is the mouse &quot;Mr Jingles&quot;. He is not only a mouse, but Mr Jingles does add a lot to this movie. He brings out joy and happiness into some of the characters in this movie, and to a small amount of characters diturbance and hatred towards the lovely &quot;Mr Jingles&quot;.  I must admit, even though being male, this movie is very emotional, funny, disturbing, sad, and has got to be one of the best movies out.  It actually made me very emotional and tears came to my eyes. SO not to be seen as a woose I watched this alone.

Clocking in at just over three hours, it seems to require every minute for something. This movie relates the story of prison guards on death row seeking to better the lives of their inmates in their last few weeks.  John Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan of Armaggedon) comes along as the simple minded man accused of the rape/murder of two girls.  The guards and prisoners alike soon discover the wonderful gift that this man has and it brings them all to question their beliefs. Sometimes this movie hits the audience over the head a little with its biblical imagery, the main characters initials are JC and there are there executions throughout the course of the movie, which should seem familiar to anyone who knows anything about the new testament.  The similarities don't end there either... Still this does not detract too much from the overall enjoyment of this film.  The performances are strong (although, I admit to getting tired of Tom Hanks and his good man in a bad world roles)and the storytelling is good.  The scenes of electrocucians are powerful, and I imagine at least a bit realistic. Still this is not a movie to see if you are in a bad mood.  It does not hug and cuddle you at the end.

It's hard to explain, but since Big, Hanks has stunned audiences with his work in the feild ususally reserved for DeNiro, Nicholson, and Hoffman. In the Green Mile Hanks delivers another oscar calliber performance, although Duncan desreves it more. He plays the average guy to a T and has made a living off of it. Once again Hanks is supported by a great script, which has made Darabont one of my favorite interpreters of books for film. While the movie is 3 hours long, it is so emotionally charging that you can barely notice the length (although the second time you can). It is also filled with great comedic moments and characters that you grow to love, and hate. Duncan makes all of the viewers believe in his miracle-like powers, which is hard to do, considering his likely ability to cause enormous harm to anyone within his reach. Darabont brings these elements into a very small world and makes the Mile a world of delights that I never thought the movie would live up to. He also creates a seemingly truthful freindship between Hanks' character, Duncan's, and with three other guards on the mile (a stregnth of Darabont's skill as a screenwriter). And as Darabont did with Shawshank Redemption's &quot;get on with livin' or get on dyin'&quot;, he ends the movie with a great final line, better than any I've ever heard.",4,Hanks roles in more &quot;Green&quot;,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1471,"['How', 'man', 'brought', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'Burbs', 'Splash', 'Turner', 'Hooch', 'could', 'turn', 'such', 'draw', 'serious', 'act', 'hard', 'explain', 'Big', 'Hanks', 'stunned', 'audiences', 'work', 'feild', 'ususally', 'reserved', 'DeNiro', 'Nicholson', 'Hoffman', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Hanks', 'oscar', 'calliber', 'performance', 'Duncan', 'more', 'average', 'guy', 'T', 'made', 'living', 'Once', 'again', 'Hanks', 'supported', 'great', 'script', 'made', 'Darabont', 'one', 'favorite', 'interpreters', 'books', 'film', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'so', 'emotionally', 'charging', 'can', 'barely', 'notice', 'length', 'second', 'time', 'can', 'also', 'filled', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'characters', 'grow', 'love', 'hate', 'Duncan', 'viewers', 'believe', 'miracle-like', 'powers', 'hard', 'do', 'considering', 'likely', 'ability', 'cause', 'enormous', 'harm', 'anyone', 'reach', 'Darabont', 'elements', 'very', 'small', 'world', 'Mile', 'world', 'delights', 'never', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'also', 'seemingly', 'truthful', 'freindship', 'Hanks', 'character', 'Duncan', 'three', 'other', 'guards', 'mile', 'stregnth', 'Darabont', 'skill', 'screenwriter', 'Darabont', 'did', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'quot', 'get', 'livin', 'get', 'dyin', 'quot', 'movie', 'great', 'final', 'line', 'better', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard']",N/A
36397,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780628799,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 3]","I honestly didn't think I would like this movie at all.  I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks.  He's impressed me a few times before but honestly I can't think of a time when he's ever `wowed' me.  I am not a fan of Stephen King in that I never really have given him a try.  Aside from `Misery' I have never read any of his novels.  I have seen a few of the film adaptations and enjoyed them but I have also seen some of his adaptations and thought they were dreadful so really it's a mixed bag for me.  I decided to give this a chance only because a friend of mine raved it, and it has received high amounts of praise from the critics and have I mentioned yet that it was nominated for Best Picture of the Year at the Academy Awards so with that in mind I decided to sit down and watch this, finally.The film follows the effect one falsely accused man has on the prison guards in charge over him.  This man is John Coffey, an extremely large black man accused of raping and murdering two young girls.  Despite his immense size Coffey appears to be a very kind soul.  This is noticed by one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb.  Getting to know John, Paul realizes that he is, without a doubt, innocent but the evidence against him is surmountable and it appears that his execution is eminent.While this is the main storyline for `The Green Mile' there is so much more to uncover, and there should be since the film is three hours long.  I've read a while back that the character of John Coffey was modeled after Jesus Christ and this makes perfect sense when you watch this film and analyze it.  John's `powers' are very similar to the ones heaped upon Jesus and John's predicament is also one similar to that of Christ.  Everyone has turned on John except for a few men who put faith in his power to heal.  He is wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit and sentenced to death by the men he was trying to protect.  It's something I did not expect to come from Stephen King, that's for sure, but then again I've never given him a fair chance...maybe I should.The performances in this film also elevate the material, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan who delivers a performance so solid and so tempered that without it the film would have failed.  He is, with all due respect, the heart and soul of this film.  Tom Hanks surprised me by delivering an outstandingly tender performance.  It may actually be his best performance to date.  Patricia Clarkson sizzles in what little screen time she has as does Bonnie Hunt and David Morse and Barry Pepper do their best to stand out amidst powerful performances by James Cromwell and more notably Doug Hutchison who plays the `evil' Percy Wetmore.  Sam Rockwell is as disturbing as they come and the revelation of his character will chill you.Like I said in my title for this review, it is far better than I assumed it would be but it still was not as grand as some have suggested.  There are moments where the melodramatic feel doesn't quite mesh right and there are some scenes that tend to drag a bit.  I'm not saying that the length is a problem for it enables the audience to truly sink into the mood of the film but there are some scenes that could have been trimmed.  It is not one of my top five films of 1999, nor one of my top ten, but it rests well with my honorable mentions.  It is not as disturbing as `Carrie' and not as meaningful as `The Shawshank Redemption' but it rest nicely in the middle and delivers solid and gratifying entertainment.",4,Much better than I thought it would be yet not as great as some would have you believe...,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,3504,"['honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'impressed', 'few', 'times', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'time', 'when', 'ever', 'wowed', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'never', 'really', 'have', 'given', 'try', 'Aside', 'Misery', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'novels', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'film', 'adaptations', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'adaptations', 'thought', 'were', 'dreadful', 'so', 'really', 'mixed', 'bag', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'only', 'friend', 'mine', 'raved', 'received', 'high', 'amounts', 'praise', 'critics', 'have', 'mentioned', 'yet', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'so', 'mind', 'decided', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'finally.The', 'film', 'effect', 'one', 'falsely', 'accused', 'man', 'prison', 'guards', 'charge', 'man', 'John', 'Coffey', 'extremely', 'large', 'black', 'man', 'accused', 'raping', 'murdering', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'immense', 'size', 'Coffey', 'be', 'very', 'kind', 'soul', 'noticed', 'one', 'guards', 'Paul', 'Edgecomb', 'Getting', 'know', 'John', 'Paul', 'doubt', 'innocent', 'evidence', 'surmountable', 'execution', 'eminent.While', 'main', 'storyline', 'Green', 'Mile', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'uncover', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'long', ""'ve"", 'read', 'while', 'back', 'character', 'John', 'Coffey', 'was', 'modeled', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'perfect', 'sense', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'analyze', 'John', 'powers', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'ones', 'heaped', 'Jesus', 'John', 'predicament', 'also', 'one', 'similar', 'Christ', 'Everyone', 'turned', 'John', 'few', 'men', 'who', 'put', 'faith', 'power', 'heal', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'sentenced', 'death', 'men', 'was', 'trying', 'protect', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'come', 'Stephen', 'King', 'sure', 'then', 'again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'given', 'fair', 'chance', 'maybe', 'should.The', 'performances', 'film', 'also', 'elevate', 'material', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'who', 'performance', 'so', 'solid', 'so', 'tempered', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'due', 'respect', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'surprised', 'delivering', 'outstandingly', 'tender', 'performance', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'what', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'as', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'David', 'Morse', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'do', 'best', 'stand', 'out', 'amidst', 'powerful', 'performances', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'more', 'notably', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'who', 'evil', 'Percy', 'Wetmore', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'as', 'disturbing', 'come', 'revelation', 'character', 'will', 'chill', 'you.Like', 'said', 'title', 'review', 'far', 'better', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'grand', 'have', 'suggested', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'melodramatic', 'feel', ""n't"", 'quite', 'mesh', 'right', 'are', 'scenes', 'tend', 'drag', 'bit', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'length', 'problem', 'audience', 'truly', 'sink', 'mood', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'not', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'films', '1999', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'well', 'honorable', 'mentions', 'not', 'as', 'disturbing', 'Carrie', 'not', 'as', 'meaningful', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'rest', 'nicely', 'middle', 'delivers', 'solid', 'gratifying', 'entertainment']",N/A
36398,A2UXS5AEDWJEMB,0780628799,Andy Todes,"[31, 71]","Fast on the heels of Frank Darabont's truly magnificent sleeper &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; comes this ridiculous mishmash of sentimentality called &quot;The Green Mile.&quot; A guy by the name of Nadav (below) makes a strong case for condemning this piece of trash, and I can't help but agree with him. (Turns out Nadav's a fan of &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; -- a work of pure genius, but I digress ...) William Goldman -- a journalistic idol of mine -- wrote some months before the release of &quot;The Green Mile&quot; that he'd seen Darabont's screenplay, and declared it brilliant. Why, Bill, why? Why is &quot;The Green Mile&quot; brilliant? The characterizations are so weak as to be barely recognizable as flesh-and-blood human beings. Take the prison wardens, who are all (with one exception) model citizens, wonderful spokespeople for tolerance and humanity. You just gotta love these guys; they're simply too good to be true. And THAT precisely is their problem. I'm not buying them for a second. The one guy I am ALMOST buying is the immature sadistic, racist, creep of a warden, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. But what about Tom Hanks -- surely he's playing a real character, surely. Sorry. He's as wooden as the rest. Perhaps even more so, except for one BRILLIANT exception. He suffers from severe recurring urinary tract infections. PRESTO! Suddenly we have a small cause to celebrate: the guy is human afterall. (I even turned to my wife during the movie and remarked how impressed I was to see a Hollywood lead with a faulty schlong!) But, of course, we find out later that the only reason he suffers urinary infections is SO THAT HE CAN MIRACULOUSLY BE CURED. Bummer. It was too good to last; there had to be a catch. And so a few scenes pass and then Hanks is cured by a semi-retarded innocent black christ figure, before the story limps on for another few hours. Whoah!  What did I just say?  Semi-retarded innocent black christ figure. Why, God, why, did he have to be ALL these things rolled into one, WHY?  Mmm, let's see. Could we white folks have handled an INTELLIGENT innocent black christ figure? Hmm, you tell me. How about an intelligent GUILTY black christ figure? Now THAT'S interesting. OK, how about a INTELLIGENT GUILTY WHITE christ figure? Maybe. But we never find out because we're served up this demeaning racist (?) mishmash: a huge retarded black man, afraid of the dark. Doesn't wash with me. But let's skip all that and move on to something else, namely, the most fraudulent scene in the movie -- the tumour removal scene. How REALISTIC is this? A white guy lets a black convicted murderer enter his home in the middle of the night TO GO AND KISS HIS DYING WIFE -- in the South during the Depression era! I'm not gonna waste any ink discussing that remote possibility, so lemme say a few words about Hanks' character -- specifically, the MOST IMPORTANT DECISION HE FACES IN THE FILM. We're near the end of the movie, and we find Hanks in a dilemma: should he kill the christ figure or try to save him? Let's imagine for a moment what must be running through his head: &quot;I know the innocent Christ figure is, well,  innocent. So do I put him to death? Or do I try to save him? Maybe I should ask the innocent Christ figure what he wants. Hmmm, he says he's tired. Hey says there's so much evil in the world. Says he would rather die than endure all this pain. Hmmm, ya know what? It WOULD make things a lot simpler if he died. I wouldn't lose my job. I wouldn't lose the respect of the bigoted members of the society I Iive in. Sure, a few nights ago I risked my neck smuggling him out of here to save my friend's dying wife. But who cares? I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut. I'm just gonna kill him. He's right, let him FRY. OK, boys!

36402,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0780628799,Anthony Hinde,"[16, 20]","The Green Mile draws its name from the lime floor tiles that cover the floor of a southern prison's death row. In a story with that backdrop and set in a 1935, you could expect death to be a main theme... in this case you'd be wrong. Surprisingly, we are quickly drawn into the lives of the prisoners and their guards in what can only be described as normal daily existence. They worry about normal things like friendships, security, conformity and boredom. We can therefore believe in them as real people, with pasts and futures, rather than two-dimensional silhouettes merely cast onto horrific scenery.The Green Mile is not a film that can be easily described. All of the characters are important. If there is a plot, it is submerged beneath a dozen important sub-plots. The characters are what keep us entranced during  this three-hour celebration of morality. Our point of view is firmly glued to the senior guard on the Green Mile, Paul Edgecomb, played with feeling by Tom Hanks. Paul is a good man, surviving the great depression in a less than attractive job. We are witness to his strength early in the film as he deals with an excruciating urinary tract infection. This strength is displayed in other ways as the story progresses.Based on a series of Stephen King novellas, we are not surprised when a new inmate arrives who fails to fit into any kind of prison mold. John Coffey, (J.C. - get it?), is a mountain of a man who exudes innocence and peace in equal measures. Every day that he stays on the row, increases Paul's belief that Coffey was wrongly convicted of killing two little girls. It is only after Coffey displays a miraculous healing gift that Paul starts to question the status quo.But Paul's redemptive efforts, and even his work, are constantly hampered by a junior guard, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchison). Percy is well connected in political circles and uses this form of protection to free his base desires. He likes to humiliate, frighten and hurt other people, never a good combination  in a prison guard. Luckily, Percy is well matched by Paul Edgecomb. We have confidence that Paul will eventually master Percy.Balance seems to be important in the story because just as Paul and Percy struggle on opposite sides of morality, John Coffey is soon introduced to his opposite, William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton, (Sam Rockwell). Wharton is a thoroughly evil man. Not content with enjoying his own warped hobbies, he seems driven to spread as much suffering as inhumanly possible. Unconcerned with his impending execution, he takes every opportunity to attack the guards. We even feel some sympathy for Percy when he comes within the diseased reach of Wharton.All the support roles are outstanding, although Graham Green's character, Arlen Bitterbuck, was not so memorable. I'd like to especially praise David Morse, who plays Brutus, Paul's right hand man; and Michael Jeter, playing a Cajun prisoner, Eduard Delacroix, who has a comic dose of eccentricity. Eduard introduces another minor character, Mr Jangles the mouse.There is a lot of symbolism in The Green Mile. The mouse, eventually adopted by Eduard, seems to represent freedom. He comes and goes without  restriction. He can't be trapped and he enjoys life, as expressed through his simple circus tricks. Coffey's healing power clearly represents good or perhaps the power of God. The ephemeral black insects he releases after absorbing disease, imply more than illness. Perhaps sickness is supposed to be an evil of the body. Sadly, Coffey eventually embodies pure goodness in our minds, and then he renounces the world and its ubiquitous evil.

This one, though, may end up as being my favorite of his. Filled with great scenes of both hope and tragedy, of sorrow and of joy, with just a touch of redemption thrown in.Based on a book by Stephen King, the Green Mile starts off in modern day times and then uses a ""flashback"" to tell the story of a group of death row guards during the depression and the strange story of a condemmed prisoner named John Coffy (played magnificiently by Michael Duncan). The story is a mix of drama, humor, and adds the spiritual/mystical as only Stephen King can do. The story also has one of the most creative twists at the end. Very surprising!But what takes this movie one of the best I've personally watched is the supporting cast. Besides the well known David Morse & Bonnie Hunt, we get James Cromwell (L.A. Confidential, Star Trek - First Contact), Michael Jeter (Open Range), Graham Greene (Dances with Wolves (Widescreen Edition)), Sam Rockwell (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Widescreen Edition)) & Harry Dean Stanton (way too many great roles to pick just a couple).I would recommend this to any movie buff looking for originality and creativity.

Which is the exact opposite of Michael Clark Duncan's performance, he gets  shine in many scenes, and he plays the key role so convincingly that the  movie's success is largely due to him. Darabont is an expert storyteller,  when you watch his movies, one gets a sense that he is enjoying a good  book.  The key scenes are extremely well staged, and the character  development is high quality (thus the 3hr+ running time).  The film  succeeds on many levels, and while it is a bit overlong, it delivers the  goods.

Being a Stephen King fan and loving the book, I had to see this movie. And it was worth it. It is better than Shawshank Redemption (My dads words as Shawshank was his favorite movie until The Green Mile).Tom Hanks is remarkable as always, but the real pleasure of this movie was no doubt Michael Clarke Duncan who was incredible. He showed he can cover a wide range of emotions and played the role as perfect as King had written it.There are some gruesome, funny, and lighthearted scenes throughout that make this movie one of the best I have ever seen. This movie is a keeper and I definitely recommend this for all (as long as your of age).There was only one bad thing about this movie (though I didn't let it hurt my rating) and that was the Widescreen version. It takes up 25-35% of the sreeen with black on the top and the bottom of the screen. As I am finding out, most DVD's seem to come this way. Why is that?But this movie now.

This is an  absolutely stunning movie: it is WONDERFUL! I did not notice the time, I  saw all humanity in its brilliance and failure played out in one part of a  prison and I believe that this movie is actually better than Shawshank  redemption.It is great the way that the storytellers actions click into  place by the end.

He  is plagued by a painful urinary infection. He is excellently supported by  David Morse and Barry Pepper playing his officers. Between them, you could  not want for better company.Along comes Percy Wetmore (played so well by  Doug Hutchinson), a sadistic well connected officer who upsets the calm  manner of the other officers and causes one of the most horrific situations  you could imagine.A new inmate arrives in the shape of giant John Coffey  (Michael Clarke Duncan) - due to be executed for the rape and murder of two  children. All of these people together with a French criminal 'Del' and a  psychotic murderer 'Wild Bill' create a microcosm against which several  miracles are played out, perhaps the greatest of which is the resurrection  of Mr Jingles, the performing circus-mouse.This is a wonderful story,  sad, funny, just like real life.

Stephen King's powerful book was turned into a fantastic, moving, and thought - provoking cinematic experience starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Sam Rockwell and Barry Pepper.Tom Hanks plays a kind prison guard called Paul Edgecomb. During the Depression, John Coffey (played superbly by Michael Clarke Duncan) comes to 'the Green Mile', convicted of murder.I don't want to spoil the rest of the film for anyone who hasn't seen it but it is about the power of healing and the moral question of the death penalty.Tom Hanks has always been a constant actor who always delivers. But in this film, he becomes Paul Edgecomb.He plays the part perfectly.Special mention must go to Michael Clarke Duncan. Many Black actors stick to the same ghetto rules (exceptions being Cuba Gooding Jnr and Denzel Washington) but Michael Clarke Duncan has broken out of this and with his performance in this proves that he can play deep and meaningful characters.Sam Rockwell was great in this film. After seeing him in this, I always make sure I look out for him in films. He played a deranged maniac in this and just defined the word 'psycho'.Give this film a chance.

Well, it can from time to time, but there is also so much beauty in the world that is right front of you; all you have to do is open up your eyes and see it. Watching &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; I felt my eyes open as wide as they ever had. I left the movie theater with a new appreciation for everything I was given. Sure, I give in to the natural desire to complain once in a while, but not as often as I did. Very few movies can make you feel this way. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; does. Adapted from the six-part serial novel of the same name by one of the great authors, Stephen King, Frank Darabont brought another uncommonly powerful work of King's to the screen with such depth and emotional resonance that by the end of the movie, there isn't a dry eye in the house. Once Tom Hanks, in a terrific performance as Paul Edgecombe, loses it, so do we, and we wear our tears proudly. How could we not, after all, if a seven-foot-something miracle of God such as John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) can? There are many moments in &quot;The Green Mile&quot; that are worthy of a standing ovation, and one in particular that makes your chin slam into the floor harder than I think most everyone's did at the end of &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but the soul of the movie lies in the relationship between Hanks and Duncan, whose performance is as much being as it is acting. There is a reason why the Best Supporting Actor race last year was so hectic, and it was because performances like Duncan's were in the running. This movie works in so many ways on so many different levels, and despite its three-hour running time, every minute of which is entertaining, it never falters. The ending of the film could've been trite, but there is one thing that saves it: The inspired monologue that gets us to comtemplate our own lives, and what we have done with them. &quot;Sometimes the Green Mile seems so long,&quot; Paul Edgecombe says in his 108-year-old voice.

A Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption)prison drama starring Tom Hanks based on a Stephen King novel. If that is not a sure fire Hollywood recipe for success then I  don't know what is.Unfortunately the results are more mixed than you  might expect. There are a great many things that are done badly with The  Green Mile and no matter what anyone will tell you The Green Mile did not  deserve its Oscar nomination. Not in a million years.First of all the  Green Mile is incessantly long. With a movie like Magnolia, Braveheart or  Casino I don't mind investing three hours of my time watching something  great. The Green Mile is not one of those movies however but is, in fact, a  melodramatic bore could have been at least 30-45 minutes shorter.The  story is, like the Shawshank Redemption, a very uplifting tale. The  Shawshank Redemption however was far more clever and avoided the usual  Hollywood cliches when tugging on the heart strings. The Green Mile  embraces every single little cliche known to man and beats them to death.  If you really love movies then you will be able to see everything coming  ten miles down the road. The Green Mile manipulates the viewer again and  again in the most predictable fashion. I think we all knew the stupid cute  little mouse would be involved somewhere didn't we? That mouse is perhaps  the most offensively obvious attempt at manipulation I have ever seen in a  film. Why not throw Old Yeller in there as well just for the cheap  sympathy. I remember when the mouse first entered the movie screen I heard  a collective &quot;Ohhhhhh&quot; from the crowd followed by even a few  people saying &quot;he's so cute.&quot; I thought to myself, you saps.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a movie having some emotion  but come on, if you fall for this old trick then you do have  problems.Tom Hanks does his usual &quot;good&quot; role like we have all  seen at least 5 times before. This one is kind of a Saving Private Ryan  meets Apollo 13 role with a Forrest Gump accent thrown in for good measure.  I don't think there's an actor alive in more need to play a villain than  Tom Hanks, just to add a little assortment to his know stupefyingly boring  roles. Michael Clarke Duncan plays the big teddy bear prisoner on death  row, he got an Oscar nod but he's boring too. David Morse is the best thing  acting wise ont he screen, he's restricted to small parts however and  cannot flex his talent enough here.Overall the Green Mile is long, dull  and extremely overated.

A lot of time passes before something actually happens. King & Darabont use this time to carefully put their chess pieces in place before making their move in the last 60 minutes or so. There's a host of details during the first 2/3s that later become significant. And since I'm not one of those who need to see fireworks of action and suspense from the first instant of a movie, that's fine with me. After all, the pace increases considerably during the course of the movie.  Some of these aforementioned details are so predictable that I could guess the next turn of events half an hour in advance. And that's never a good thing.  The last hour, however, makes up for a lot of the film's former trappings. There's no arguing that the solution is quite touching.  So finally, a movie worth watching, but there were still a few things that bugged me. First, I would've liked to know more about the inmates as murderers, which I guess they were supposed to be. (You never notice, though.) In the way they're portrayed, these are good, righteous people that are good friends with the wardens, love a cute mouse and are generally lovable. So- why are they in death row anyway? I understand the novel shed some light on this, and the film could've certainly needed some of this other side of the story to avoid some of the schmaltz.  Second, isn't this prison just lovely? I mean, it seems like a camping tour at some points. If death row is like that, I want to be in it!  If The Green Mile was supposed to make any statement about the right or wrong of the death sentence, you'd better watch Dead Man Walking to form your own opinion instead of being manipulated into believing that all killers ultimately become nice people once they're in Our Favorite Death Row. It works for tearjerking, but not for discussion of that subject.  But, mind you, I couldn't help being manipulated myself- and it worked. I was genuinely moved at the end and, despite the occasional predictability, the story had its clever moments.  So, it was an OK movie, at times even a bit more, but it sure didn't deserve its Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, and it sure can't hold a candle to King's and Darabont's first joint venture, the brilliant The Shawshank Redemption.",3,Of mice and men... and murderers.,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,2358,"['should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'least', 'let', 'start', 'beginning', 'might', 'add', 'terribly', 'slow', 'lot', 'time', 'passes', 'something', 'actually', 'King', 'Darabont', 'use', 'time', 'carefully', 'put', 'chess', 'pieces', 'place', 'making', 'move', 'last', '60', 'minutes', 'so', 'host', 'details', 'first', '2/3s', 'later', 'become', 'significant', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'need', 'see', 'fireworks', 'action', 'suspense', 'first', 'instant', 'movie', 'fine', 'pace', 'considerably', 'course', 'movie', 'aforementioned', 'details', 'are', 'so', 'predictable', 'could', 'guess', 'next', 'turn', 'events', 'hour', 'advance', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'last', 'hour', 'however', 'up', 'lot', 'film', 'former', 'trappings', 'arguing', 'solution', 'quite', 'touching', 'So', 'finally', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'still', 'few', 'things', 'bugged', 'First', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'know', 'more', 'inmates', 'murderers', 'guess', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'never', 'notice', 'way', ""'re"", 'portrayed', 'are', 'good', 'righteous', 'people', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'wardens', 'love', 'cute', 'mouse', 'are', 'generally', 'lovable', 'So-', 'why', 'are', 'death', 'row', 'anyway', 'understand', 'novel', 'shed', 'light', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'needed', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'avoid', 'schmaltz', 'Second', ""n't"", 'prison', 'just', 'lovely', 'mean', 'camping', 'tour', 'points', 'death', 'row', 'want', 'be', 'Green', 'Mile', 'was', 'supposed', 'make', 'statement', 'right', 'wrong', 'death', 'sentence', ""'d"", 'better', 'watch', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'instead', 'being', 'manipulated', 'believing', 'killers', 'ultimately', 'become', 'nice', 'people', ""'re"", 'Favorite', 'Death', 'Row', 'tearjerking', 'not', 'discussion', 'subject', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'manipulated', 'myself-', 'worked', 'was', 'genuinely', 'moved', 'end', 'occasional', 'predictability', 'story', 'had', 'clever', 'moments', 'So', 'was', 'OK', 'movie', 'times', 'even', 'bit', 'more', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'Oscars', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'King', 'Darabont', 'first', 'joint', 'venture', 'brilliant', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption']",N/A

Middleton,"[15, 15]","Frank Darabont's second film since The Shawshank Redemption, another adaptation from a Stephen King story, The Green Mile is concerned with good and evil, hope and resilience against unspeakable odds and the power of the human heart. This is an intense film, finding myself emotionally drained as the last credits rolled, though unmistakably open to the fact that miracles, in one form or another, can an do occur.Although The Green Mile refers to the lime green linoleum floor in a death-row cellblock, this is not just another prison story but a sensitive supernatural thriller designed to move the human spirit. John Coffey, an African American giant, has been accused and found guilty of a terrible crime - the rape and murder of two young girls. Coffey is found holding the two dead girls in his arms, crying and wailing that he ""can't take it back."" He arrives at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in chains to await his execution by electric chair. As the film progresses, we discover that the giant, John Coffey has a special gift, and wonder how such a gentle man with a miracle gift can be a child killer.Tom Hanks performance as the head guard, Paul Edgecomb, is subtle and moving, as he begins to realize his own sense of spirit and humanity. We see this humanity in action when he and the other guards risk their jobs to sneak John Coffey out of death row to help a friend in dire need. The scenes that follow are extraordinary as we witness the power of Coffey and the miraculous transformation of the Warden's wife.Aside from Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan's (John Coffey) outstanding performances, the field mouse, Mr. Jingles, stole the show in his many scenes, outsmarting everyone with his tricks and incredible disappearing acts throughout the film.Director and writer Frank Darabont surprised the world with his directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption. This is a film one never tires of and can be viewed many times and continue to be inspired by the beauty of the human spirit. The Green Mile really cannot be compared with Shawshank, as they are entirely different stories, however both touch on similar themes - hope, resilience and overcoming diversity despite incredible odds.One looks forward to Frank Darabont's next project, as Shawshank and Green Mile are unquestionably films that will become classics and remain favourites for years to come.",5,Outstanding in every respect,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,2370,"['Frank', 'Darabont', 'second', 'film', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'Green', 'Mile', 'concerned', 'good', 'evil', 'hope', 'resilience', 'unspeakable', 'odds', 'power', 'human', 'heart', 'intense', 'film', 'finding', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'last', 'credits', 'rolled', 'unmistakably', 'open', 'fact', 'miracles', 'one', 'form', 'can', 'do', 'Green', 'Mile', 'refers', 'lime', 'green', 'linoleum', 'floor', 'death-row', 'cellblock', 'not', 'just', 'prison', 'story', 'sensitive', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'designed', 'move', 'human', 'spirit', 'John', 'Coffey', 'African', 'American', 'giant', 'been', 'accused', 'found', 'guilty', 'terrible', 'crime', 'rape', 'murder', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'Coffey', 'found', 'holding', 'two', 'dead', 'girls', 'arms', 'crying', 'wailing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'Penitentiary', 'chains', 'await', 'execution', 'electric', 'chair', 'film', 'discover', 'giant', 'John', 'Coffey', 'special', 'gift', 'wonder', 'how', 'such', 'gentle', 'man', 'miracle', 'gift', 'can', 'be', 'child', 'killer.Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'head', 'guard', 'Paul', 'Edgecomb', 'subtle', 'moving', 'realize', 'own', 'sense', 'spirit', 'humanity', 'see', 'humanity', 'action', 'when', 'other', 'guards', 'risk', 'jobs', 'sneak', 'John', 'Coffey', 'death', 'row', 'help', 'friend', 'dire', 'need', 'scenes', 'follow', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'witness', 'power', 'Coffey', 'miraculous', 'transformation', 'Warden', 'wife.Aside', 'Hanks', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'John', 'Coffey', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'field', 'mouse', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'stole', 'show', 'many', 'scenes', 'outsmarting', 'everyone', 'tricks', 'incredible', 'disappearing', 'acts', 'film.Director', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'surprised', 'world', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'film', 'one', 'never', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'many', 'times', 'continue', 'be', 'inspired', 'beauty', 'human', 'spirit', 'Green', 'Mile', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Shawshank', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'stories', 'however', 'touch', 'similar', 'themes', 'hope', 'resilience', 'overcoming', 'diversity', 'incredible', 'odds.One', 'forward', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'next', 'project', 'Shawshank', 'Green', 'Mile', 'are', 'unquestionably', 'films', 'will', 'become', 'classics', 'remain', 'favourites', 'years', 'come']",N/A

It's also nicely filmed. The unique story gets you involved to the point where, even having to watch several very, very unpleasant scenes, you don't want to put the movie down.Big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing ""John Coffey,"" a prisoner with strange powers. You could root for all the characters save two, a sadistic guard aptly named ""Brutus 'Brutal' Howell"" (David Morse) and Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell).

One man, however is destined to make a more lasting impression.Set on the penitentiary's death row, The Green Mile is an adaptation of what is, in my opinion, one of King's finer stories. It is also, surprisingly, given the subject matter, an uplifting and even heart-warming film. Directed by Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead), it takes a similar setting to another of King's storiesRita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, also turned into an award winning film by Darabont.Set in an American prison during the Great Depression, The Green Mile has (likeThe Shawshank Redemption) a wonderfully clear sense of place, the dusty despair of the era and of course the chilling sense of impending doom of a death row cell block. There is a wonderful scene where the guards are shown cleaning and polishing ""Old Sparky"" in preparation for one of the executions and the juxtaposition between this menial housework and the terrible purpose it precedes is spine-tingling. Indeed, the minutes leading up to the executions (all three are shown in some detail - this is rated 18 for good reason) are more chilling, even upsetting, than the final act itself. Of course the story is bigger than that one idea and it explores some typical King concepts;  good and evil, spirituality and redemption and they leaven the more horrific moments.These redeeming messages are delivered in part by one of the central characters, John Coffey (""like the drink, but not spelled the same"") and enormous black man, condemned for the rape and murder of two children but posessed of some miraculous healing powers. One commentator has decribed this character, derogatively I suppose, as a 'magic negro' - a stereotypical black man whose sole purpose in life is to further the happiness of a white person. Whether this is an over harsh or even accurate description of the intent of King or Darabont, it was interesting to watch the film with this thought in mind and it certainly put the story in a different light.The acting is fine and the cast list is impressive but by no means overwhelming. Hanks does a sterling job as the compassionate and fair-minded head warder and David Morse fits the role as his second in command ""Brutal"" Howell perfectly. Michael Clarke Duncan is suitably titanic as Coffey although the character comes across as rather more stereotyped on film than in the book. The remainder of the cast includes some that will be familiar to Darabont's fans (Jeffery deMunn, William Sadler) and includes a fair sprinkling of other (perhaps surprising) well known names, such as Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell. Perhaps the most ironic casting moment is that of Harry Dean Stanton* who does NOT play the part of the character ""Dean Stanton"".The adaptation to the big screen is done with due reverence to King's novel and the dialogue and plot are exceptionally faithful. The original story is a long one (some 480 pages) and some fairly extensive (but sensitive and ultimately successful) editing was needed, but it still comes in at 3 bum-numbing hours.All told, this is an absorbing and very enjoyable film. Well acted, well scripted and well adapted. The one down side is, perhaps, the rather gruesome imagery; it's in keeping and warranted and doesn't overwhelm the film but it may be upsetting to sensitive viewers.Extras - on the DVD version these comprise the usual commentaries and a short ""making-of"" documentary, which is really only a compilation of cast and crew interviews.Recommended.* See film critic Roger Ebert's rule that ""no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad.""",4,"We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but, oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long.",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,3729,"['prisoners', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'E', 'Block', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'Penitentiary', 'come', 'then', 'go', 'One', 'man', 'however', 'destined', 'make', 'more', 'lasting', 'impression.Set', 'penitentiary', 'death', 'row', 'Green', 'Mile', 'adaptation', 'what', 'opinion', 'one', 'King', 'finer', 'stories', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'uplifting', 'even', 'heart-warming', 'film', 'Directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'similar', 'setting', 'King', 'storiesRita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'also', 'turned', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'Darabont.Set', 'American', 'prison', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Green', 'Mile', 'likeThe', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'wonderfully', 'clear', 'sense', 'place', 'dusty', 'despair', 'era', 'course', 'chilling', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'death', 'row', 'cell', 'block', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'guards', 'are', 'shown', 'cleaning', 'polishing', 'Old', 'Sparky', 'preparation', 'one', 'executions', 'juxtaposition', 'menial', 'housework', 'terrible', 'purpose', 'spine-tingling', 'Indeed', 'minutes', 'leading', 'up', 'executions', 'three', 'are', 'shown', 'detail', 'rated', '18', 'good', 'reason', 'are', 'more', 'chilling', 'even', 'upsetting', 'final', 'act', 'course', 'story', 'bigger', 'one', 'idea', 'typical', 'King', 'concepts', 'good', 'evil', 'spirituality', 'redemption', 'leaven', 'more', 'horrific', 'moments.These', 'redeeming', 'messages', 'are', 'delivered', 'part', 'one', 'central', 'characters', 'John', 'Coffey', 'drink', 'not', 'spelled', 'same', 'enormous', 'black', 'man', 'condemned', 'rape', 'murder', 'two', 'children', 'posessed', 'miraculous', 'healing', 'powers', 'One', 'commentator', 'decribed', 'character', 'derogatively', 'suppose', ""'magic"", 'negro', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'man', 'sole', 'purpose', 'life', 'further', 'happiness', 'white', 'person', 'harsh', 'even', 'accurate', 'description', 'intent', 'King', 'Darabont', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'film', 'thought', 'mind', 'certainly', 'put', 'story', 'different', 'light.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'cast', 'list', 'impressive', 'means', 'overwhelming', 'Hanks', 'sterling', 'job', 'compassionate', 'fair-minded', 'head', 'warder', 'David', 'Morse', 'role', 'second', 'command', 'Brutal', 'Howell', 'perfectly', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'suitably', 'titanic', 'Coffey', 'character', 'across', 'rather', 'more', 'stereotyped', 'film', 'book', 'remainder', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'Darabont', 'fans', 'Jeffery', 'deMunn', 'William', 'Sadler', 'fair', 'sprinkling', 'other', 'perhaps', 'surprising', 'well', 'known', 'names', 'such', 'Michael', 'Jeter', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'ironic', 'casting', 'moment', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton*', 'who', 'NOT', 'play', 'part', 'character', 'Dean', 'Stanton', '.The', 'adaptation', 'big', 'screen', 'done', 'due', 'reverence', 'King', 'novel', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'long', 'one', '480', 'pages', 'fairly', 'extensive', 'sensitive', 'ultimately', 'successful', 'editing', 'was', 'needed', 'still', '3', 'bum-numbing', 'hours.All', 'told', 'absorbing', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'well', 'adapted', 'one', 'down', 'side', 'perhaps', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'imagery', 'keeping', 'warranted', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'upsetting', 'sensitive', 'viewers.Extras', 'DVD', 'version', 'comprise', 'usual', 'commentaries', 'short', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'really', 'only', 'compilation', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews.Recommended', '*', 'See', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'rule', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'supporting', 'role', 'can', 'be', 'altogether', 'bad']",N/A

36461,A1R8AO9XASQ15C,0780628799,Daniel A. Marsh,"[0, 0]","Here is a movie that is destined to become a classic over time. ""The Green Mile"" is more than just a Stephen King tale (in fact, it's hardly that at all); it's an epic character study, a human drama told against a backdrop of cruelty and violence. Another masterful collaboration between King and ""Shawshank Redemption"" director Frank Darabont, the movie represents some of the best work of everyone involved -- especially star Tom Hanks.Over the last decade, Hanks has become our greatest living actor. His work in ""Forrest Gump,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Road to Perdition,"" ""Cast Away"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" proves his name worth mentioning with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. He can effortlessly transform himself into whatever character he plays, yet still remain ""Tom Hanks."" His best acting may be in ""The Green Mile.""As 1930s prison guard Paul Edgecomb, Hanks gradually unveils a wealth of sensitivity beneath an exterior hardened by life on Death Row. Another actor might have killed the role with treacly sentimentality, but Hanks focuses on Paul's tough, sturdy integrity. Only in his more private moments does he reveal second thoughts about his job, making the character all the more compelling.Darabont did a sensational job directing this movie. What's amazing is that he left so much of King's original story intact; one could easily imagine the studio ordering so many cuts and trims and alterations that it would hardly make sense anymore. But I can't think of a thing that could have been cut that would have improved the film by its absence. Surely we could do without so many details of Paul's urinary tract infection, but look at the expression on Hanks's face as he whizzes for the first time without awful pain. We feel his relief, and understand pretty much everything he does after that point.""The Green Mile"" contains excellent performances from an expert supporting cast. I loved everybody in the movie, from David Morse and Doug Hutchison (as the despicable Percy) to Bonnie Hunt and Sam Rockwell (as a foul-mouthed, truly loathsome killer). Michael Clark Duncan deserved his Oscar nomination for his empathetic portrayal of John Coffey -- but then Hanks also deserved a nod, for which he was unfairly overlooked.The movie is hard and unflinching in its look at death by electric chair. These scenes are grueling without being exploitative; Darabont gets his point across without turning the movie into ""Faces of Death."" Darabont (and his surrogate Hanks) treats the condemned men with the utmost reverence and respect, allowing each a chance for redemption.

Darabont, to his credit, has assembled a first-rate cast to enact this tale.  The always solid Tom Hanks shines as Paul Edgecomb, the stolid head guard of ""the mile"".  Michael Clarke Duncan as the condemned John Coffey, a role that on paper borders on the one-dimensional, shines and gives the film it's heart and soul.  Excellent support is offered here by Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell,Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson.  Special mention should be made for the late Michael Jeter who sympathetically portrays one of the condemned prisoners.

It soon becomes clear that this inmate is not what he seems and that the Green Mile (so named for its green floor tiles) has become the unlikely setting for a time of miracles and wonder that will deeply affect everyone involved.Many of the plot elements are predictable (for example, I could guess almost everything that would happen to the mouse, Mr. Jingles, as soon as he appeared on screen, and I knew how the whole sub-plot with the warden's wife would develop).

36471,A8540ROXP4VOI,0780628799,David M. Glasgow,"[0, 0]","The first time the world heard this story, it left enough of an impression that we're still telling it two millenia later.  That this time the story has come from the pen of Stephen King is no surprise to those of us who  have felt before the deep spirituality that often hides within King's  writings.  The Green Mile is as disturbing a film as any  I've seen: the  script, the acting, and the cinematography are crafted to lend an air of  historical authenticity to the terrible story which unfolds, so that we  wonder if we might stumble someday upon the graves of the men we watch die.  Indeed, much of King's signature genius lies in weaving together elements  of fiction which COULD easily be fact, before injecting a story with a  supernatural tone which challenges belief.  And director Frank Darabont has  done a masterful job of using those truth-cored elements to support-almost  overshadow-the miraculous events which surround a mysterious death row  inmate.  But there's something more, something messianic, about John  Coffey; at each turn we fall deeper into a soul-rending romance with the  doomed innocent, ashamed of ourselves for the fear he inspires in  us.Coffey (&quot;like the drink, but not spelt the same&quot;), a burly  black transient in 1935 Louisiana, has been arrested and convicted for the  brutal murder of two young girls.  His tearful, sobbing defense-&quot;I  tried to take it back, but it was too late&quot;-is as enigmatic as  &quot;you have said so,&quot; and gives us reason from the outset to  believe that the &quot;jury of his peers&quot; was wrong to condemn him.  Rather, as the story unfolds, we begin to understand that John Coffey, like  another figure with similar initials, has spent his life-and in fact is  doomed to GIVE his life-seeing and feeling the pain, injury, and shame of  others.  The miracle is that Coffey is able to take in all that ugliness,  feel it and own it, and then cast it away, literally on the wind.  Coffey  feels joy just as deeply and powerfully as he feels pain.  Life to him is  exhausting; we finish the film wondering if any of the other characters on  the screen-and if we ourselves-have even begun to live life as fully as he  has.  Coffey's unearthly power infects the lives of every person he meets,  whether death row inmate, prison guard, or cancer patient.  None, having  met John Coffey, will ever be the same.King closes &quot;It,&quot;  another of his novels, with a challenge: &quot;there are so many happy  endings that the man who says he does not believe in God needs to have his  rationality called into serious question.&quot;  The Green Mile does  nothing to disprove this dictum.  In fact, this story, for all of its  gut-wrenching awfulness, for all of its sorrow and injustice, still  radiates the presence of God in the midst of, and in spite of, the shame of  humanity.  It is, in essence, a story of Grace and Redemption.",5,The Bible According to King,962236800,"06 29, 2000",2000,2926,"['first', 'time', 'world', 'heard', 'story', 'left', 'enough', 'impression', ""'re"", 'still', 'telling', 'two', 'millenia', 'later', 'time', 'story', 'come', 'pen', 'Stephen', 'King', 'surprise', 'who', 'have', 'felt', 'deep', 'spirituality', 'often', 'King', 'writings', 'Green', 'Mile', 'disturbing', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'script', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'crafted', 'lend', 'air', 'historical', 'authenticity', 'terrible', 'story', 'so', 'wonder', 'might', 'stumble', 'someday', 'graves', 'men', 'watch', 'die', 'Indeed', 'much', 'King', 'signature', 'genius', 'weaving', 'together', 'elements', 'fiction', 'COULD', 'easily', 'be', 'fact', 'injecting', 'story', 'supernatural', 'tone', 'belief', 'director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'done', 'masterful', 'job', 'using', 'truth-cored', 'elements', 'support-almost', 'overshadow-the', 'miraculous', 'events', 'surround', 'mysterious', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'something', 'more', 'something', 'messianic', 'about', 'John', 'Coffey', 'turn', 'fall', 'deeper', 'soul-rending', 'romance', 'doomed', 'innocent', 'ashamed', 'ourselves', 'fear', 'us.Coffey', 'quot', 'drink', 'not', 'spelt', 'same', 'quot', 'burly', 'black', 'transient', '1935', 'Louisiana', 'been', 'arrested', 'convicted', 'brutal', 'murder', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'tearful', 'sobbing', 'defense-', 'quot', 'tried', 'take', 'back', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'quot', 'as', 'enigmatic', 'quot', 'have', 'said', 'so', 'quot', 'reason', 'outset', 'believe', 'quot', 'jury', 'peers', 'quot', 'was', 'wrong', 'condemn', 'Rather', 'story', 'unfolds', 'begin', 'understand', 'John', 'Coffey', 'figure', 'similar', 'initials', 'spent', 'life-and', 'fact', 'doomed', 'GIVE', 'life-seeing', 'feeling', 'pain', 'injury', 'shame', 'others', 'miracle', 'Coffey', 'able', 'take', 'ugliness', 'feel', 'own', 'then', 'cast', 'away', 'literally', 'wind', 'Coffey', 'joy', 'just', 'deeply', 'powerfully', 'pain', 'Life', 'exhausting', 'finish', 'film', 'wondering', 'other', 'characters', 'screen-and', 'ourselves-have', 'even', 'begun', 'live', 'life', 'as', 'fully', 'Coffey', 'unearthly', 'power', 'lives', 'person', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'prison', 'guard', 'cancer', 'patient', 'None', 'having', 'met', 'John', 'Coffey', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'same.King', 'quot', 'quot', 'novels', 'challenge', 'quot', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'happy', 'endings', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'believe', 'God', 'have', 'rationality', 'called', 'serious', 'question.', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'nothing', 'disprove', 'dictum', 'fact', 'story', 'gut-wrenching', 'awfulness', 'sorrow', 'injustice', 'still', 'presence', 'God', 'midst', 'spite', 'shame', 'humanity', 'essence', 'story', 'Grace', 'Redemption']",N/A

Just because they have the same writers, etc.  and somewhat the same theme does not in my opinion make for obivous  comparison.  They are totally different films with different totally  different objectives.  Furthermore, who defines what is long for a movie?  Sure, we are used to our approx. 90 minute films or even 120 minute films,  but this film never once, was boring or uneventful.  I don't think it could  have been any shorter than it was.  I bought it last week and have watched  it twice, something I rarely do with a 3 hour movie. The performances were  incredible.  Tom Hanks shines in everything I've ever seen him in and this  film was no exception.  I too was tired of seeing stereotyped prison guards  and prison inmates and this movie really crept into the very soul of the  viewer.  I thought the supporting cast was wonderful.  I thought the story  was wonderful and a big magical which carried the audience every single  minute.  I don't think it was all that predictable and until I read  someone's review below didn't think it &quot;obviously&quot; borrowed any  story line from the bible; although I guess when you sit and pick it apart,  you see the comparisons.  I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I felt scared  and comforted all within the 3 hours that I sat glued to the screen.  Not  many movies provoke so many emotions in one setting.  I think this is  perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and I feel Tom Hanks gets  better and better with age.  Again, the supporting cast was wonderful and  well-casted.  I find it hard to believe that there were viewers who were  not entertained by this film.  It is well worth the purchase price and a  movie that I intend to watch over and over.

John Coffey is a black man convicted of killing two small girls,  though it seems strange to Edgecomb as well as everyone else that he could  be capable of such a ghastly crime. From this point on, strange things  begin happening, things that benefit those in trouble or in pain. It is  soon revealed that John Coffey has a gift for healing those in pain,  whether physical or emotional, and this revelation leads to an unexpected  discovery about the truth about the facts of the crime, and a twist that  will leave you breathless.From the director of &quot;The Shawshank  Redemption&quot; comes &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; a highly emotional and  moving epic film that takes us back to a place in time where racial  inequality affected every aspect of American government and life. Tom Hanks  plays Paul Edgecomb, the prison guard whose intrigue for John Coffey's past  leads him to learn of his extraordinary power to heal those in pain.  Michael Clarke Duncan gives an uncanny performance as the extremely  friendly and soft-hearted John Coffey, whose bitterness and anger aim only  at the injustice and prejudices of the world outside. Everything in this  movie is perfectly rounded, created so that in the end, everything ties up  together in a glorious package of revelations and truths about life. On  another high note, the film remains ever-so true to the novel, remaining  one of the finer book-to-film adaptations ever created.The DVD edition  of the film is nicely rendered, with crisp images and superbly enveloping  sound that immerses the viewer in the heart of the story.

That's no small task, and THE GREEN MILE is no small movie.There's not anything small about Michael Clark Duncan, either, who is the focal point of this film as John Coffey, a gentle giant sent to &quot;The Green Mile&quot; to await his execution.  Duncan literally towers over everything--physically and figuratively--as a soft-spoken man with a miraculous &quot;gift,&quot; a gift so selfless the viewer immediately knows John Coffey isn't guilty of the horrible crime he's alleged to have committed.  His kindness, his inherent goodness, wins over the hearts of the prison staff assigned to guard him--to eventually execute him.Nothing quite like compelling conflict and drama, is there?The cast, led by Tom Hanks as Green Mile guard Paul Edgecomb, is first-rate; Sam Rockwell as inmate &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton almost steals the show, while Doug Hutchison is nauseating as the repulsive Percy Wetmore, the &quot;governor's nephew.&quot;  THE GREEN MILE is a formidable visual event, which is also its only weakness, as some of its scenes (an electrocution gone awry, Coffey's discharge of pestilent &quot;evil&quot;) are over the top, to the point where you're rolling your eyes.

Miller,"[0, 0]","The Green Mile directed by Frank Darabont who delivered us The Shawshank Redemption manages to bring us another great prison movie, which is anything but what you'd expect. Based on the book by Stephen King, this film follows a period of time during the Depression, focusing on an event in the lives of several men on a death row watch in Louisiana that changes them all forever.Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard of E block...Death Row...or ""The Green Mile"" as they called it, ""because the floor was the color of faded limes."" One day the block receives a new inmate named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), an immensely large man accused of murdering two little girls. Coffey is anything but what the men guarding the Mile have come to expect from a hardened criminal. He seems almost more like a lost child. Spurred on by the cruelty and disease surrounding him, Coffey comes to display for them all just how uncommon and gifted he really is...and just how unlikely it is that he could have ever committed a cold-blooded murder.The film is superb in its character development. So rarely anymore does a film succeed in making you honestly care about (or despise) its characters in a couple of short hours. The Green Mile is so well put together that by the end of the film, it's hard to not feel like you've known these people for years. A triumph in character development which was a pleasure to experience.Tom Hanks gives an unbelievable performance, which is not all-too-surprising, but in some ways I feel that he is almost overshadowed by Michael Duncan who gives a truly Oscar-worthy performance. He managed to portray Coffey so perfectly that his character positively fills the theatre. Duncan is heart wrenching...so much so that you can't help but want to hug him. Other notables in the film include Doug Hutchinson (A Time To Kill) who nailed his part as Percy, a rookie guard with a morbid sense of self and a cruel heart. David Morse is also applaudable as ""Brutal"" Howell, a guard with similar beliefs and kindness as Edgecomb.In time, the truth does reveal itself, but I refuse to give anything away as I fear it will rob some of the power from the film.

36491,A3VQLTB724O77W,0780628799,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[5, 8]","I have to admit to a certain indignation toward Stephen King when he brought out the book The Green Mile in serial form--it seemed to me an outrageous and blatant attempt to gouge his fans--each chapter cost approximately half the price that the entire novel normally would have.  And when one chapter seemingly advanced the plot not at all (The Mouse on the Mile) and not only strained credulity but broke its back and left it for dead--please, that a MOUSE would excite so much attention in a Louisiana prison in the 1930s is less believable than John Coffey's miraculous powers! --I even stopped buying the books from the used bookstore and they have remained off my shelves.  But there's always been a little nibble of curiosity there, partly my own amazement and disbelief that Steven King could go so wrong, and partly the grim curiosity of a passerby at an auto wreck straining to see how bad it really is.  So when the film of The Green Mile came to Hong Kong cable television on a night I had nothing better to do, the terms seemed right for me to give it another chance.That chance wasn't fully deserved.  While there were some genuinely touching moments and a nice little twist at the very end (poorly played out, though), the whole was far too obvious.  There is no art in writing lines that tell the attentive audience member immediately what will happen: if a prison guard says that you don't wanna forget to put the wet sponge on the person to be executed, anyone who's ever seen a Hollywood movie knows that somebody's gonna get it just that way.  The second you learn that the Warden's wife is sick with a mysterious headache, you know she's going to have an inoperable tumor and if the instant you discovered John Coffey's powers you didn't know he was going to cure her, you weren't paying attention.  This isn't foreshadowing, it's bludgeoning.There is no suspense, and without the suspense, I have to wonder why the movie took so long.  Character development?  These aren't complex guys--they are straight out of Stereotyping 101!  Tom Hanks, David Morse and their buddies are all real good, upstanding folks; Doug Hutchison plays the sadistic but cowardly guard.  Michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, had perhaps the most complex and rewarding role; but the screenplay gave him little to do except look tortured.  That particular look, in fact, is the number one expression in the movie, and everybody gets a shot at it.  Unfortunately they overact so much I can only imagine director Frank Darabont off camera shouting ""More!  Give me more!  Imagine your dog dying!  Your Mom!  Your AGENT!""  And with those Godawful ""Southern"" accents, he must have done much the same.  I'm from the South, and I've never heard anyone talk like this.Nevertheless, there were some redeeming touches.  The film dips and occasionally wallows in sentiment, but not so much that a traditional happy ending is forced on us.  I'll not comment further on Coffey's fate except to say that his final moments in the prison are the film's highlight.  Furthermore, the brutality of the electric chair is manifest throughout, and this horrifying pervasiveness mitigates the sentimental aspects of the movie.  Although camera shots do not linger on the victims, each execution is conveyed with real emotion--so much so that The Green Mile can be seen as a powerful statement against the death penalty.  And finally, that Coffey's healing powers are not only a miracle but also a curse gave the story some complexity.  For all its flaws, The Green Mile is worth watching; but wait for it to come to TV.  That way you can give the book's author a little ""payback"" for his original attempt at price gouging.",3,Flawed but Watchable,1014422400,"02 23, 2002",2002,3697,"['have', 'admit', 'certain', 'indignation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'when', 'brought', 'out', 'book', 'Green', 'Mile', 'serial', 'form', 'seemed', 'outrageous', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'gouge', 'fans', 'chapter', 'cost', 'approximately', 'price', 'entire', 'novel', 'normally', 'would', 'have', 'when', 'one', 'chapter', 'seemingly', 'advanced', 'plot', 'not', 'Mouse', 'Mile', 'not', 'only', 'strained', 'credulity', 'broke', 'back', 'left', 'dead', 'please', 'MOUSE', 'would', 'excite', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'Louisiana', 'prison', '1930s', 'less', 'believable', 'John', 'Coffey', 'miraculous', 'powers', 'even', 'stopped', 'buying', 'books', 'used', 'bookstore', 'have', 'remained', 'off', 'shelves', 'always', 'been', 'little', 'nibble', 'curiosity', 'there', 'partly', 'own', 'amazement', 'disbelief', 'Steven', 'King', 'could', 'go', 'so', 'wrong', 'partly', 'grim', 'curiosity', 'passerby', 'auto', 'wreck', 'straining', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'really', 'So', 'when', 'film', 'Green', 'Mile', 'came', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'cable', 'television', 'night', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'terms', 'seemed', 'right', 'give', 'chance.That', 'chance', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'deserved', 'were', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'nice', 'little', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'poorly', 'played', 'out', 'though', 'whole', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'obvious', 'art', 'writing', 'lines', 'tell', 'attentive', 'audience', 'member', 'immediately', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'prison', 'guard', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'forget', 'put', 'wet', 'sponge', 'person', 'be', 'executed', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'somebody', 'gon', 'get', 'just', 'way', 'second', 'learn', 'Warden', 'wife', 'sick', 'mysterious', 'headache', 'know', 'going', 'have', 'inoperable', 'tumor', 'instant', 'discovered', 'John', 'Coffey', 'powers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'going', 'cure', 'were', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', ""n't"", 'foreshadowing', 'suspense', 'suspense', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'Character', 'development', 'are', ""n't"", 'complex', 'guys', 'are', 'straight', 'Stereotyping', '101', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'David', 'Morse', 'buddies', 'are', 'real', 'good', 'upstanding', 'folks', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'sadistic', 'cowardly', 'guard', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'John', 'Coffey', 'had', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'rewarding', 'role', 'screenplay', 'gave', 'little', 'do', 'look', 'tortured', 'particular', 'look', 'fact', 'number', 'one', 'expression', 'movie', 'everybody', 'shot', 'Unfortunately', 'overact', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'camera', 'shouting', 'More', 'Give', 'more', 'Imagine', 'dog', 'dying', 'Mom', 'AGENT', 'Godawful', 'Southern', 'accents', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'same', ""'m"", 'South', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'talk', 'this.Nevertheless', 'were', 'redeeming', 'touches', 'film', 'dips', 'occasionally', 'wallows', 'sentiment', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'traditional', 'happy', 'ending', 'forced', ""'ll"", 'not', 'comment', 'further', 'Coffey', 'fate', 'say', 'final', 'moments', 'prison', 'are', 'film', 'highlight', 'Furthermore', 'brutality', 'electric', 'chair', 'manifest', 'horrifying', 'pervasiveness', 'sentimental', 'aspects', 'movie', 'camera', 'shots', 'do', 'not', 'linger', 'victims', 'execution', 'conveyed', 'real', 'emotion', 'so', 'much', 'Green', 'Mile', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'powerful', 'statement', 'death', 'penalty', 'finally', 'Coffey', 'healing', 'powers', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'miracle', 'also', 'curse', 'gave', 'story', 'complexity', 'flaws', 'Green', 'Mile', 'worth', 'watching', 'wait', 'come', 'TV', 'way', 'can', 'give', 'book', 'author', 'little', 'payback', 'original', 'attempt', 'price', 'gouging']",N/A

36497,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,0780628799,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[0, 0]","The average follower of Stephen King probably wondered how to approach this movie, as it's a bit different from his usual fare, whether you like the ""usual fare"" or not.  For while there is terror, and bloodshed, and death, it is not the overwhelming force of the movie.  And it doesn't necessarily come from supernatural forces, although supernatural forces exist in the story.  The story could have existed without the supernatural, but the supernatural in it is so, well, natural, that it becomes maybe the best of King's stories that have been filmed.This is a very long movie covering several months in a southern prison's death row near the beginning of the twentieth century.  While the movie is long, it never seems to drag, so good is the story.  And this is not the totally animalistic prison life of ""Oz"" cable fame, though at several of the prisoners in ""The Green Mile"" would have fit in quite well with those of ""Oz"".  No, this story portrays a time where a certain level of civil behavior, even among death row inmates was expected.The story begins when a new inmate is brought to the death row that makes up the movie's title.  He is accused of raping and killing two little girls that were found in his arms.  The inmate is huge, black, and probably illiterate, but has an inner gentleness to him that doesn't quite fit the usual mold of the Mile's residents.  While initially overwhelmed with the new man, they slowly come to understand that he is different from most of the people they've ever met, and this feeling continues to grow throughout the entire film.You see, the man has a gift.  I won't give it away here, but it is so wonderful, so immense that nobody, not even the inmate, quite comprehends what it is.  I will not reveal it, but it manages to touch everyone it surrounds, both positively and negatively.  Like all awesome forces, it is at first tentatively approached by all around, but by the end of the movie, it actually used as a tool to help someone.The acting in this movie is superb by everyone involved.  Tom Hanks is arguably the main character, but it's not a dominating performance (nor is it supposed to be).  He and David Morse play the head guards, and supply the stability the situation needs.  The public is introduced to Michael Clarke Duncan in this film, and after appearing in a few action movies to show his physical size, I think we are going to get a treat when he appears as the Kingpin in the upcoming ""Daredevil"".  Harry Dean Stanton is also hilarious as a prison trustee who leads an execution ""dress rehearsal"" and states what he REALLY would like as his last wish.But a lot of credit should be given to the movie's two most unpleasant characters.  I was astonished to see Sam Rockwell playing the worst of the inmates; a real monster.  He was the goof in ""Galaxy Quest"", and I didn't even recognize him in this film.  But even bigger credit must be given to Doug Hutchison.  While Rockwell's character is a monster, it took a lot of guts to play a totally despicable guard.  A role like this can sometimes result in a lack of future work, so it was good to see he's had at least a handful more movie appearances after this one.",5,Superb story-telling and movie-making,1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,3190,"['average', 'follower', 'Stephen', 'King', 'probably', 'wondered', 'how', 'approach', 'movie', 'bit', 'different', 'usual', 'fare', 'usual', 'fare', 'not', 'terror', 'bloodshed', 'death', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'force', 'movie', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'come', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'exist', 'story', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'existed', 'supernatural', 'supernatural', 'so', 'well', 'natural', 'maybe', 'best', 'King', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'filmed.This', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'covering', 'several', 'months', 'southern', 'prison', 'death', 'row', 'beginning', 'twentieth', 'century', 'movie', 'long', 'never', 'drag', 'so', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'totally', 'animalistic', 'prison', 'life', 'Oz', 'cable', 'fame', 'though', 'several', 'prisoners', 'Green', 'Mile', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'quite', 'well', 'Oz', 'No', 'story', 'time', 'where', 'certain', 'level', 'civil', 'behavior', 'even', 'death', 'row', 'inmates', 'was', 'expected.The', 'story', 'when', 'new', 'inmate', 'brought', 'death', 'row', 'up', 'movie', 'title', 'accused', 'raping', 'killing', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'were', 'found', 'arms', 'inmate', 'huge', 'black', 'probably', 'illiterate', 'inner', 'gentleness', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'usual', 'mold', 'Mile', 'residents', 'initially', 'overwhelmed', 'new', 'man', 'slowly', 'come', 'understand', 'different', 'most', 'people', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'met', 'feeling', 'grow', 'entire', 'film.You', 'see', 'man', 'gift', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'so', 'wonderful', 'so', 'immense', 'nobody', 'not', 'even', 'inmate', 'quite', 'what', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'touch', 'everyone', 'positively', 'negatively', 'awesome', 'forces', 'first', 'tentatively', 'approached', 'around', 'end', 'movie', 'actually', 'used', 'tool', 'help', 'someone.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'superb', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'arguably', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'dominating', 'performance', 'supposed', 'be', 'David', 'Morse', 'play', 'head', 'guards', 'supply', 'stability', 'situation', 'public', 'introduced', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'film', 'appearing', 'few', 'action', 'movies', 'show', 'physical', 'size', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'treat', 'when', 'Kingpin', 'upcoming', 'Daredevil', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'also', 'hilarious', 'prison', 'trustee', 'who', 'execution', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'what', 'REALLY', 'would', 'like', 'last', 'wish.But', 'lot', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'movie', 'two', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'characters', 'was', 'astonished', 'see', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'playing', 'worst', 'inmates', 'real', 'monster', 'was', 'goof', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'film', 'even', 'bigger', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'Rockwell', 'character', 'monster', 'took', 'lot', 'guts', 'play', 'totally', 'despicable', 'guard', 'role', 'can', 'sometimes', 'result', 'lack', 'future', 'work', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'had', 'least', 'handful', 'more', 'movie', 'appearances', 'one']",N/A

But even more worthwhile is the walk down &quot;The  Green Mile.&quot;  Though the guards of this death row seem at times a bit  soft and sentimental, they are portrayed and acted superbly.  Their  insecurities and foibles endear them to us, save one whom we come to  despise.And the inmates...?Therein lies the heart of this story.  Facing the electric chair, one inmate wonders if, in death, he'll have the  chance to go back to best moments of his life.  He doesn't make excuses for  his actions; he comes to terms with what he's done.  Another inmate and his  pet mouse play key parts in the story, and then there's Billy the Kid.  Behind his crazy ways and insane laughter lurks a truly sick  man.Coffey--'like the drink, but spelled different'--is the central  character in this tale.  Played with deceptive ease by a hulking,  muscle-stacked black actor, Coffey leads us through a series of  supernatural encounters that show his ability to bring healing and justice  to the world around him.  Coupled with this ability is his insight into  people's hearts and situations.Could this man, blamed for a brutal  double homicide, be capable of such violence while possessing such gifts?  The director, and Stephen King's writing, keep us sympathetically on his  side while still flirting near the edge of doubt.Ultimately, Coffey's  insights become unbearable for him to carry.

Darling ""naive cynic""","[2, 3]","It's difficult to sum this movie up into a few paragraphs...the acting, direction, casting, sets, and locations were all excellent. Michael Clarke Duncan's performance as John Coffey is overwhelming; the depths he reaches portraying Coffey's compassion is simply amazing. He brings a vulnerability to this giant character that not many other actors could find. Tom Hanks, James Cromwell, David Morse, and Michael Jeter all turn in great performances as well.While the &quot;surprise&quot; isn't much of a surprise at all, it's the journey through the story that's important. King's horror devotees won't find his usual style here, but those who loved &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; will be very pleased. If there's a dry eye in the house at several dramatic points of this film, be sure to check for pulses.The DVD features are similarly wonderful - the behind-the-scenes footage is great. There's a bit between Hanks and Duncan in Coffey's cell during which Hanks is almost entirely off-camera, but to (roughly) quote the director, &quot;Tom's giving this Oscar-winning performance, and he's not even on-camera! He's giving Duncan everything possible to make his performance as real as possible.&quot; That brought tears to my eyes as well - Tom Hanks is truly extraordinary.&quot;The Green Mile&quot; is a deeply touching story, brought to vivid life by this great cast and crew.

This is another terrific adaptation of a King novel that delivers a bittersweet story of a depression era Louisiana prison on the death row cell block.  It presents  numerous interesting character studies that induce strong emotions for the  various characters.  There is also a lot of irony here with good guys who  are evil and bad guys who are good.Director Frank Darabont, who missed  out on an Oscar with `Shawshank Redemption' (also by Stephen King) to  `Forrest Gump' must have decided he wasn't going to beaten by Tom Hanks  again and secured him for this film with wonderful results.  Unfortunately,  he was trumped at the Academy by Kevin Spacey and `American Beauty', an  injustice in my opinion.Darabont again does a superlative job of  creating the right mix of drama, imagery and human interest.  My only  criticism of his direction is that the film was much too long.  It  certainly could have been done in two hours instead of three with very  little lost in the editing.  We could have eliminated the entire first  execution and rehearsal without any loss to the story except perhaps the  sponge issue.The acting was outstanding by all.  Tom Hanks turns in  another great performance as the tough but kind cell block boss.  Hanks  continues to show his versatility, excelling in both dramatic and comedic  roles and moving effortlessly between them like a chameleon.  David Morse  mirrored Hanks as another tough guy with a heart and played the part  nicely.  Michael Clarke Duncan engendered a very sensitive and lovable  nature to his character, making the contrast between his demeanor and  physiognomy all the more striking.  And I cannot leave out the uncredited  star of the show, the little mouse who played Jangles.Overall, a well  crafted film and an excellent story that suffered slightly from excessive  length.

It was quite an excellent movie and the best part was the acting. All of the characters really came to life and you loved them or hated them. I understand it got four Academy Award nominations. Mr. Jingles ought to get an award of his own.The Green Mile is the walkway in the hall of the death row at a major prison. Tom Hanks is the man in charge. All of the prisoners await their journey. Some are quite likable people. Some are despicable. Same with the guards who are in charge. Mr. Jingles is a mouse who lives in the corridor and is befriended by one of the inmates. It seems like a pretty simple setting but a lot of drama is involved in the dynamics of the situation and this is the best movie in which I've ever seen Tom Hanks. The acting, direction and filming are all first rate. Well done!My inclination would be to give the movie five stars, without reservation, except for one factor. I didn't like the hocus-pocus of the miraculous healings. This type of supernatural nonsense tainted an otherwise outstanding movie, in my opinion. I have no alternate suggestion. The fault lies not with the movie or it's production, but with the author of the story.

And when he teams up with Disney--voila--one of the finest films made.King's gift brings us this mysterious story of a man, John Coffey, who is wrongly imprisoned for the hideous murders of two small girls. Coffey is on deathrow, back in the 1930's. He has a &quot;gift&quot; too.

The movie takes place in a depression era prison;  death-row, to be exact.  (And a word of warning:  The scenes with Old  Sparkey are grippingly real)!

The casting in this movie is excellent; Tom Hanks shines, as  usual, in his starring role as the warden of his cell block, as does  Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey.  I also think David Morse  (formerly of St. Elsewhere) did an EXCELLENT job, as one of the officers on  the cell block.  This is definitely a movie you must see; especially if you  are a King fan!

It is deep in character  development, and has several storylines running throughout.  The Green Mile  has Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) written all over it.  They  are different movies, but I think I like Shawshank a little better.  The  acting in The Green Mile is excellent, and Tom Hanks once again puts in a  memorable performance, putting further behind him the days of Bosom Buddies  and Bachelor Party.  I don't really have too many complaints about the  actual story.

I wanted them to just smack the crud out  of him every time I saw him on screen.  Oh well, he gets his in the end.

Let me just say that viewers expecting a gritty, ultimately uplifting prison drama of the quality of &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; are going to be disappointed.  Which is not to say that &quot;The Green Mile&quot; does not have some things going for it--the leads give fine performances all around, and newcomer David Morse makes an indelible impression as a sociopathic guard who is far more dangerous than anyone who is locked up on the Green Mile.  Tom Hanks' inherent Everyman quality makes even implausible situations seem possible, and he gives a workmanlike performance here.  Kudos go also to Michael Clarke Duncan, who manages to radiate dignity even while portraying essentially a freak-show cartoon of a man.  The flaws of this film are primarily the flaws of... a writer of the source novel: tediously overlong by at least an hour; overreliance on character stereotypes; obsession with the scatological--we are treated to WAY too many scenes of Tom Hanks' character trying to pee with a raging UTI; and the tendency of a gleeful adolescent to exploit the &quot;gross-out&quot; factor even though it adds nothing substantial to the story.  What the heck are those bugs John Coffey's always gagging up supposed to represent? (&quot;Coffey&quot;--get it?)  The scene of a maliciously botched execution goes on much longer than necessary to make the point  This is DEFinitely not appropriate viewing for children, or anyone who is disturbed by scenes of needless torture.  The scene of a mouse getting smashed is also upsetting.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, then by all means purchase &quot;The Green Mile&quot; for your personal collection.

Obviously Percy represents the nazi spirit ; a characteristic smell in that age.But notice than much more than a political movement the nazism works out here as a living style.  Watch the way he acts ; her cut hair and his manners ; he seems to be a hard beat man and behind of this invisible wall ; you feel a man with serious emotional and affective lacks. The proofs are very clear ; he is a man without a bit of humanity a beast would be a term appropiate if not that issue may offend the animal species.The punishment for him it's excellent ; he will live in his memory over and over the horror: the Shakespeare's memory . The sin hurts much more in the memory than in the flesh.We have in the prison characters who trascend his personal values through the green mile . The silent agreement : ""All what it happens in the green mile , it keeps in the green mile"" will be a statement that won't be too long after the redemption caused for Coffey. The mouse gag is a very ingenious clue. A prisioner will experiment a twist of fate with this pet.The main character John Coffey is framed to die in the electric chair ; acussed by a murder . Slowly the curtains will reveal the awful truth and you as viewer will be reflected in the moral jury who observes the execution.Notice by moments the film reminds us to a great picture of the same age (1935) , casually titled ""Fury"" of Fritz Lang . In many ways it doesn't sound speculation to state the rendezvous for that shocking film. The extrordinary picture Top Hat in which we watch to Fred Astaire dancing with Ginger Rogers is a touch of genius device that let introduce us and links the last will of Coffey ; Heaven ; I'm in heaven. And you can not avoid thinking in Cinema Pardiso ending.The script was a hit. Frank Dubont made a very well done work with the camera , art direction , photography, cast and enlightment.When the film concludes you remain in your chair thinking the multiple lines around the story . The sense of revenge , vested as justice ; the ugliness who lives in the soul of that people will watch the last minutes of Coffey beats in your face, your solu and your heart.The smart ending is filled with sweetness ; it's very clever and it works out as relief for the viewer , who may forget the real intention of the film . You may assume the most comfortable position and consider the film as a beautiful redemption story : good choice for you , but the bitter message goes far beyond ; the racism ; the intolerance and the pain for the narrator who should live thinking about his silent shame , and to make nothing for avoid it.To know and not to do is still not knowing said once the japanese writer Mishima.This film and the wisperer's horse were the finest achievements in 1998 ; good signals that reveal the awakening of new proposals and ideas for the american cinema.A winner movie!",4,The redemption subrreptitiously...,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,3144,"['standpoits', 'picture', 'complex', 'deep', 'sociological', 'approach', 'human', 'behavior.A', 'prison', 'background', 'vehicle', 'developing', 'fine', 'story', 'filled', 'many', 'narrative', 'devices', 'secondary', 'readings.Lets', 'start', 'character', 'Percy', 'Obviously', 'Percy', 'nazi', 'spirit', 'characteristic', 'smell', 'age.But', 'notice', 'much', 'more', 'political', 'movement', 'nazism', 'out', 'here', 'living', 'style', 'Watch', 'way', 'cut', 'hair', 'manners', 'be', 'hard', 'beat', 'man', 'behind', 'invisible', 'wall', 'feel', 'man', 'serious', 'emotional', 'affective', 'lacks', 'proofs', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'man', 'bit', 'humanity', 'beast', 'would', 'be', 'term', 'appropiate', 'not', 'issue', 'may', 'offend', 'animal', 'species.The', 'punishment', 'excellent', 'will', 'live', 'memory', 'horror', 'Shakespeare', 'memory', 'sin', 'much', 'more', 'memory', 'flesh.We', 'have', 'prison', 'characters', 'who', 'trascend', 'personal', 'values', 'green', 'mile', 'silent', 'agreement', 'what', 'green', 'mile', 'green', 'mile', 'will', 'be', 'statement', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'long', 'redemption', 'caused', 'Coffey', 'mouse', 'gag', 'very', 'ingenious', 'clue', 'prisioner', 'will', 'experiment', 'twist', 'fate', 'pet.The', 'main', 'character', 'John', 'Coffey', 'framed', 'die', 'electric', 'chair', 'acussed', 'murder', 'Slowly', 'curtains', 'will', 'reveal', 'awful', 'truth', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'reflected', 'moral', 'jury', 'who', 'execution.Notice', 'moments', 'film', 'great', 'picture', 'same', 'age', '1935', 'casually', 'titled', 'Fury', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'many', 'ways', ""n't"", 'sound', 'speculation', 'state', 'rendezvous', 'shocking', 'film', 'extrordinary', 'picture', 'Top', 'Hat', 'watch', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'dancing', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'touch', 'genius', 'device', 'let', 'introduce', 'last', 'will', 'Coffey', 'Heaven', ""'m"", 'heaven', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'thinking', 'Cinema', 'Pardiso', 'ending.The', 'script', 'was', 'hit', 'Frank', 'Dubont', 'made', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'work', 'camera', 'art', 'direction', 'photography', 'cast', 'enlightment.When', 'film', 'remain', 'chair', 'thinking', 'multiple', 'lines', 'story', 'sense', 'revenge', 'vested', 'justice', 'ugliness', 'who', 'soul', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'last', 'minutes', 'Coffey', 'beats', 'face', 'solu', 'heart.The', 'smart', 'ending', 'filled', 'sweetness', 'very', 'clever', 'out', 'relief', 'viewer', 'who', 'may', 'forget', 'real', 'intention', 'film', 'may', 'assume', 'most', 'comfortable', 'position', 'consider', 'film', 'beautiful', 'redemption', 'story', 'good', 'choice', 'bitter', 'message', 'far', 'racism', 'intolerance', 'pain', 'narrator', 'who', 'should', 'live', 'thinking', 'silent', 'shame', 'make', 'nothing', 'avoid', 'it.To', 'know', 'not', 'do', 'still', 'not', 'knowing', 'said', 'once', 'japanese', 'writer', 'Mishima.This', 'film', 'wisperer', 'horse', 'were', 'finest', 'achievements', '1998', 'good', 'signals', 'reveal', 'awakening', 'new', 'proposals', 'ideas', 'american', 'cinema.A', 'winner', 'movie']",N/A

It's a great movie and covers just about all of the aspects that are in the book. Some gripe that it's too long, but if you were to start trimming things the film would really suffer. This movie will touch you and, while quite sad, it makes you sort of take a reflective view of your own life and the inevitable end of that life. I didn't think about that aspect as much when I first watched the movie on VHS years ago, but now that I'm fast approaching 50, it really does give me pause for thought.I don't like this film as much as The Shawshank Redemption, but I suspect that's more because of the sadness of the story and the ending being somewhat more of a downer than Shawshank. It certainly is NOT because of the performances. All of the acting talent here is top shelf. Michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, delivers a truly powerful performance that's equal to Tom Hanks, who turns in yet another of his many memorable turns, as prison guard Paul Edgecomb. The supporting players are equally wonderful - especially Mr. Jingles! And I want to give a special shout out here to veteran character actor Dabbs Greer, as the elderly Paul. Except for a couple of small recurring character roles on TV, Greer spent most of his career playing bit parts. Even though his onscreen time in The Green Mile is brief, he demonstrates what a great actor he truly was. Such a shame he never got a chance to be a leading man, but everything happens for a reason, or so they say. And with over 300 film & TV appearances in his 50+ year career, at least we have many wonderful opportunities to catch a glimpse of this fine, underrated actor.The Blu-ray for The Green Mile is well put together: the colors are rich, the focus is sharp and the audio is crisp, clear and nicely balanced. The disc includes a handful of cool bonus goodies to go along with the feature film. You can pick up a nice gently used copy for cheap thru Amazon, so there's no reason not to have this film in your collection! 5 stars for this moving human drama story.",5,Another terrific Steven King / Frank Darabont collaboration,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,2136,"['Not', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'impressive', 'film', ""n't"", 'been', 'covered', 'hundreds', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'great', 'movie', 'covers', 'just', 'aspects', 'are', 'book', 'gripe', 'too', 'long', 'were', 'start', 'trimming', 'things', 'film', 'would', 'really', 'suffer', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'quite', 'sad', 'sort', 'take', 'reflective', 'view', 'own', 'life', 'inevitable', 'end', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'aspect', 'as', 'much', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'now', ""'m"", 'fast', 'approaching', '50', 'really', 'give', 'pause', 'thought.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'suspect', 'more', 'sadness', 'story', 'ending', 'being', 'somewhat', 'more', 'downer', 'Shawshank', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'performances', 'acting', 'talent', 'here', 'top', 'shelf', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'John', 'Coffey', 'truly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'equal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'yet', 'many', 'memorable', 'turns', 'prison', 'guard', 'Paul', 'Edgecomb', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'want', 'give', 'special', 'shout', 'out', 'here', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Dabbs', 'Greer', 'elderly', 'Paul', 'Except', 'couple', 'small', 'recurring', 'character', 'roles', 'TV', 'Greer', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'playing', 'bit', 'parts', 'Even', 'onscreen', 'time', 'Green', 'Mile', 'brief', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'truly', 'was', 'shame', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'so', 'say', '300', 'film', 'TV', 'appearances', '50+', 'year', 'career', 'least', 'have', 'many', 'wonderful', 'opportunities', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'fine', 'underrated', 'actor.The', 'Blu-ray', 'Green', 'Mile', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'focus', 'sharp', 'audio', 'crisp', 'clear', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'disc', 'handful', 'cool', 'bonus', 'goodies', 'go', 'along', 'feature', 'film', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'nice', 'gently', 'used', 'copy', 'cheap', 'thru', 'Amazon', 'reason', 'not', 'have', 'film', 'collection', '5', 'stars', 'moving', 'human', 'drama', 'story']",N/A

36540,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0780628799,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","That film is a masterpiece. Darabont wants to be faithful to Stephen King's book. So he centers his tale on the emotional level of this experience and he uses all the symbols he can in the pictures. In fact the setting itself is simplified in many ways because the characters must come first, and they do. John Coffey (JC, like another one) is huge and powerful. He embodies the simpleness of nature, of a true miracle, though we do not know if he is a miracle of nature or of God. John Coffey is living among us and doing all kinds of good things, but he is different, so he is also running a dangerous road. Along that road we meet with justice that is going to produce one of its blazing miscarriages helped by political widwives. And yet we can wonder if this miscarriage is not willed by John Coffey himself who is tired of living among men and women who hate one another, who find pleasure in doing evil things to all those who surround them. John Coffey cannot repair all that evil, and it is too much of a responsibility for a single and lonely man. So he gets trapped and executed, not on a cross, but on an old sparky. This last run in his long life will help a few to redeem themselves, but the world will go on being bad. The worst part, the straw that breaks the back of this miraculous camel is the fact that some men can kill other people by using the love the victims feel for one another, in this case the love of two sisters for each other. The film also shows so beautifully that men do not do evil for the sake of evil, but that they are moved into doing that by their fears, their ambitions, their mediocrity or the system that engulfs them in order for them to survive, to eat and drink and sleep and have a little of comfort. John Coffey is afraid of the dark. But Percy, the supreme prison warden, is afraid of mice, is only moved by his sex-drives, is fascinated by his own death instinct. He has to make other people suffer for himself to be, just be, even if it is to be a monstrous being. The actors really give some density to the characters. John Coffey is the most convincing living human and humane miracle we can imagine. Paul Edgecomb is emotionnally slow and calculated in his actions and movements. He does not overshow his emotions, but lives them intensely inside his own being and this is shown by a certain nonchalance and restrain. Mr Jingles finally is the most extraordinary pet we can imagine : brilliant, intelligent, sensitive, a marvel of animal grace and beauty. And we can understand that it is this grace and this beauty that inspire hatred and fear in those who have something to hide, some deep flaw in their personalities. The main lesson remains though that no one can escape the ugliness of life, and that the longer one lives, the more one can see it. One can only protect himself against it, try not to be invaded by it, and accept to pay for the mistakes one may make here and then, now and there. This film is naturally a direct allusion to our world. John Coffey is black, like the drink he carries the name of, though not the spelling. The world cannot be redeemed by any saviour, but it can be made to think about itself by a saving victim or martyr. We must definitely think of all the miscarriages of justice that surround us, of the horror of the death penalty, and of the unescapable segragation and discrimination that our world conveys and assumes too easily against anyone who is different, be he or she black, big, simple-minded, poor, hungry, truth-seeking, brainy, or just disturbing the peace of our hypocrisy. Will the world be one day better ? The book by Stephen King is a lot more pessimistic on that issue. But the film is in no way optimistic. It shows the true colors of love, hatred, fear and death that all roam among us like so many skeleton in our cupboards and cabinets, even if it is love.

To include everything from the books the movie would be a least a week long.For those who criticize the movie because you felt that the storyline was not plausible.

Each character had a story to be told and all of them were like a spoke on a wheel where Coffey was the hub in that he affected everyone on the Green Mile.However, a little tidbit for you.  The Coffey character and the murder of the two white girls picking flowers and some of the events that followed are loosely based on true events.Google ""George Junius Stinney.""  At 14 years old he is the youngest person to be executed in the U.S. in the 20th century.  He was tried, convicted and executed within 83 days in Columbia, SC.In my opinion Coffey was a metaphor for Stinney.  He gentle character represented the innocence of a child and the supernatural aspect of the story represented the gift that was bestowed upon him to share with others to show humanity and forgiveness.  In other words his angel like qualities was sort of a sign that he was heaven bound.I know the movie is long but if you get the chance read the Stinney story and watch the movie again and you will see the parallels and understand what I am saying.",5,Very Touching and Entertaining,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,1608,"['read', 'comments', 'are', 'really', 'favorable', 'attempt', 'trash', 'movie.For', 'who', 'criticize', 'movie', 'claim', 'book', 'better', 'course', 'book', 'better', 'when', 'read', 'story', 'are', 'able', 'create', 'scenes', 'liking', 'Also', 'Green', 'Mile', 'was', 'series', 'small', 'books', 'include', 'everything', 'books', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'week', 'long.For', 'who', 'criticize', 'movie', 'felt', 'storyline', 'was', 'not', 'plausible', 'IT', 'A', 'STEPHEN', 'KING', 'STORY', 'thought', 'Green', 'Mile', 'was', 'wonderful', 'story', 'character', 'had', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'were', 'spoke', 'wheel', 'where', 'Coffey', 'was', 'hub', 'affected', 'everyone', 'Green', 'Mile.However', 'little', 'tidbit', 'Coffey', 'character', 'murder', 'two', 'white', 'girls', 'picking', 'flowers', 'events', 'followed', 'are', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'events.Google', 'George', 'Junius', 'Stinney', '14', 'years', 'old', 'youngest', 'person', 'be', 'executed', 'U.S.', '20th', 'century', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'executed', '83', 'days', 'Columbia', 'SC.In', 'opinion', 'Coffey', 'was', 'metaphor', 'Stinney', 'gentle', 'character', 'represented', 'innocence', 'child', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'story', 'represented', 'gift', 'was', 'bestowed', 'share', 'others', 'show', 'humanity', 'forgiveness', 'other', 'words', 'angel', 'qualities', 'was', 'sort', 'sign', 'was', 'heaven', 'bound.I', 'know', 'movie', 'long', 'get', 'chance', 'read', 'Stinney', 'story', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'will', 'see', 'parallels', 'understand', 'what', 'am', 'saying']",N/A

Because every single review had harped on how long it was, I expected to be  bored. However,  I didn't mind the length of this tale of life and  mysterious happenings on a Death Row &quot;long mile&quot; in the 30's.  I  found it to be very engrossing, well written, and beautifully acted.  Tom  Hanks, for one, never seems to mistake overacting with intensity. His  quiet, strong portayal of a man with character, working on Death Row,  confronted by daily decisions and inexplicable occurrences is perfect.  Consistently he proves how skilled he is at portraying a character as a  real person, with a heart, guts, an actual life.  He gives this movie, with  its improbable plot, the strength to anchor the tale and save it from going  adrift into a sea of confusion and mysticism. In this task he is assisted  by the ensemble cast, all of them, the good guys AND the bad guys. All were  uniformly excellent.  And what a piece of work Michael Duncan is!  He has  the most expressive face I have seen on the screen in a long time.  I am  looking forward to seeing him in other movies.I will remember scenes  from this movie for a long time, I expect.

In fact I found it to be easily one of the best movies I saw in 1999.The movie starts off today with a gentleman in a retirement home reluctantly reminiscing about events that happened in the 30's at a Prison in the South.  Is this a horror movie?  NO WAY.  In fact it was anything BUT.  Tom Hanks is superb (but then again when ISN'T he?) in the job of being in charge of 'The Green Mile' which represents the floor color that leads to the electric chair from the prison cells.  It's not a mile, in fact it's only about 50-60 feet total...but having to walk that distance to one's ultimate demise would have to be considered a long walk indeed--one that would finish all-too-soon for some characters.Everything from a little mouse--which amazingly has a rather large roll in the movie--but don't worry, it isn't silly at all-- to easily the biggest man I have EVER seen all works together to make 'The Green Mile' an incredible journey which on more than one occasion had me thinking long and hard at the death penalty. My ONLY criticism of the movie was how the supernatural portion was handled...well actually our very large character, John Coffey is accused of killing two young girls (don't worry, he's innocent--but is it enough to win him a stay of execution?) when in reality he was actually trying to HEAL them...you see John has an interesting ability to cure people of their ills.  How?  Well we never really find out, but the ONLY problem I have at ALL with this movie is, well, how he manages to expel the illness once he has removed it from the one who is sick.  Other than that, this film is one that has stayed with me long after I left the theater.  I also was shocked to find out that it was 3-hours long.  As I left the theater I glanced at my watch and could hardly believe that I had been sitting there that long.  It seemed more like the usual hour-and-a-half.  Time just stood still as I watched this fantastic movie.  I enjoyed this movie so much I actually went out and bought the book (which actually IS better, but what book isn't?) and I also found a whole new view of Stephen King.  Do NOT let this movie being written by him keep you from a true masterpiece.  Simply put great filmmaking with each character pulling in a great performance.

His life is fairly normal until a prisoner named John Coffey is brought into death row.  Coffey is a gentle giant who brings a sense of spirit and humility to his fellow inmates and guards.  He also possesses supernatural powers which he uses for the good of his fellow man.  Wrongfully accused of murdering two young girls, Coffey, being black, is immediately suspected and ultimately sentenced to die for this crime.  While awaiting execution, he magically transforms death row into an area of caring and compassion.Paul Edgecomb experiences Coffey's powers first-hand.  Suffering from a terrible urinary tract infection, he is miraculously healed by Coffey.  Also, Delacroix's pet mouse Mr. Jingles (who really steals the show, in my opinion), is resurrected by Coffey after a vindictive Percy steps on him.  Even Warden Moores' wife, who is suffering from a terminal brain tumor, is healed by Coffey's magical touch.  Coffey also uses his special powers to show Edgecomb that he is really innocent of the charges against him.  However, Coffey doesn't want anything to change, merely saying that he wants everything to come to an end.  Sadly, Edgecomb and his crew accept Coffey's decision, even though they know he is innocent.This is an excellent movie.  The story is first-rate, and the acting, led by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, is outstanding.  The execution scenes are carried out with remarkable realism, as well.  Based on the novel by Stephen King, the movie is actually better than the book was.  I was impressed with the relationship that developed between Coffey and the guards and how their friendship deepend until the final scene, where the guards are openly crying while carrying out Coffey's final wish.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  This is not your typical Stephen King slasher film.  Rather, it is one that will touch your soul and uplift your spirit.

Tom Hanks, as the tale's narrator, once again demonstrates his incredible generosity as an actor; although his is the leading role, he delivers a superb ensemble performance that never overwhelms his co-stars.  It's nice to see him reunited with Gary Sinise (&quot;Forrest Gump&quot;) and Barry Pepper (&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;), and his scenes with the wonderful Michael Clarke Duncan give the movie its emotional heart.  Great work is also turned in by Michael Jeter as the sympathetic Del, Doug Hutchison as a wormy guard, and Patricia Clarkson as the woman who receives a miracle.  It's also nice to see veteran players Dabbs Greer and Eve Brent (she played Jane to Gordon Scott's Tarzan in the 1950's) given a chance to shine in the roles of the aged Hanks and his nursing home romance.  Worth seeing for the performances alone, the film also offers a wonderful blend of drama, mystery, and fantasy; some striking sets; and is beautifully photographed.The DVD is a real treat.

The film has moments of beautiful tenderness and incredible cruelty.  Tom Hanks is the head of the block known as the Green Mile where the inmates are interred before their execution.  His efforts to be a compassionate but firm jailer run afoul of a wormy, vindictive and spiteful subordinate, placed there via nepotism.  The arrival of the mysterious, large, John Coffey reworks the dynamics on the death row - as does the arrival of a small mouse which gives immediate purpose to one of the inmates.  Finally a darker figure makes his presence known when the last inmate is transferred in, a cosmic counter-balance to the innate goodness of Coffey and his healing ways.  The interplay between all these actors is brilliant and in some instances heart rending, it certainly choked me up more than a few times.

Tom Hanks, though, manages to pick better ones (or is  offered better ones). The Green Mile *tries* to be a tear jerker, but  doesn't quite make it....J.D. Salinger once defined sentimentality as  loving something more than God does.  It seems like an apt description of  what's going on here.  Frank Darabont sentimentalizes everything he can in  this movie.  First of all, just HOW loveable do you want to make your death  row inmates?  Please.  The Green Mile has got to be the ONLY death row ever  in which the majority (that is, all but one) of inmates are SO loveable,  you HATE to see them fry!  Of course, we are never told what they are in  for (except the one we are led to hate), because we might love them less.  All storytelling is manipulative, but this is a bit much.The one awful  inmate is SO awful that we're supposed to be darn glad to see him go, but  sadly, he was one of the two most entertaining characters in the movie, him  and the weasely, sadistic guard (every &quot;institutional&quot; flick  needs a sadistic guard).There is one important scene in the middle of  the movie during which the guards feloniously take John Coffey (the central  prisoner, with the magical powers) to the house of their supervisor, whose  wife is dying of a brain tumor. Coffey, and absolutely gigantic African  American, leans over and KISSES her, in a room full of Depression-era white  men, including the woman's husband!  No one bats an eye!  All who find this  believeable, raise your hands....I didn't think so.The movie tries to  milk emotion, without really earning that emotion.  There is nothing that  new here, no surprises whatsoever, and no unique or original insights into  humanity or our relationships with one another.

This isn't a good hybrid either; not like a  mule, more like a three legged dog. First of all, it is far, far, far too  long. There are about seventeen too many scenes with the way-overrated  Michael Clarke Duncan moping around or mumbling or weeping or grabbing  someone and healing them. Someone needs to learn that compelling drama +  science fiction = this movie = drawn out, melodramatic bore. It's not all  bad. The ideas are, for the most part, original. (Isn't originality what  sci-fi is all about?) But as original as they get, it can't compete with  the overall quality of the film. This movie makes too clear the edges  between good and bad, black and white. What we need is more movies like  &quot;American Beauty&quot; to show us the utter vastness of that gray  area. The lines between good and evil are clearly seen here, too. (Paul vs.  Percy, Coffey vs. Wild Bill, etc.), making it far too sugary sweet to be  enjoyed long enough.In my opinion, Hanks would have been a better Best  Actor nominee than Duncan a Best Supporting Actor nominee; how overrated  can a performance GET? I would bet 4/5 of his scenes feature him cowering  in his cell block, mumbling incoherent babble, or grabbing Hanks between  the legs. Why do grown men crying touch people so? I could get up there and  act as John Coffey (if I was a bit older and taller), and so could almost  anyone here that's faked a few tears in their day.It's certainly worth  watching, if for no other reason than writing a bad review just like me,  but don't be fooled and expect too much.2.5/5 Stars (I have 2/5 of  there, would have been unfair to round to 3, but my real rating is 2.5/5)",2,AN AVERAGE FILM THAT DRAGS ON FAR TOO LONG,964828800,"07 29, 2000",2000,2109,"[""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'bad', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'all.I', 'am', 'however', 'disgusted', 'people', 'can', 'say', 'better', 'film', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'here', 'why.', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'was', 'incredibly', 'filmed', 'superbly', 'written', 'film', 'shined', 'mirror', 'too', 'many', 'American', 'families', 'possibly', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'it.', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'however', 'was', 'hybrid', 'sap', 'drama', 'far', 'out', 'sci', 'fi', ""n't"", 'good', 'hybrid', 'either', 'not', 'mule', 'more', 'three', 'legged', 'dog', 'First', 'all', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'seventeen', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'way-overrated', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'moping', 'around', 'mumbling', 'weeping', 'grabbing', 'someone', 'healing', 'Someone', 'learn', 'compelling', 'drama', '+', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', '=', 'drawn', 'out', 'melodramatic', 'bore', 'not', 'bad', 'ideas', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'original', ""n't"", 'originality', 'what', 'sci-fi', 'as', 'original', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'movie', 'too', 'clear', 'edges', 'good', 'bad', 'black', 'white', 'What', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'show', 'utter', 'vastness', 'gray', 'area', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'clearly', 'seen', 'here', 'too', 'Paul', 'vs.', 'Percy', 'Coffey', 'vs.', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'etc', 'making', 'far', 'too', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'long', 'enough.In', 'opinion', 'Hanks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nominee', 'Duncan', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nominee', 'how', 'overrated', 'can', 'performance', 'GET', 'would', 'bet', '4/5', 'scenes', 'feature', 'cowering', 'cell', 'block', 'mumbling', 'incoherent', 'babble', 'grabbing', 'Hanks', 'legs', 'Why', 'do', 'grown', 'men', 'crying', 'touch', 'people', 'could', 'get', 'up', 'there', 'act', 'John', 'Coffey', 'was', 'bit', 'older', 'taller', 'so', 'could', 'almost', 'anyone', 'here', 'faked', 'few', 'tears', 'day.It', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'other', 'reason', 'writing', 'bad', 'review', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'expect', 'too', 'much.2.5/5', 'Stars', 'have', '2/5', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unfair', 'round', '3', 'real', 'rating', '2.5/5']",N/A

Tom Hanks and David Morse play prison guards on death row who get a new prisoner named John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Duncan is a mountain of a man and seems to be a simpleton but he has been sentenced to death for the murder of two little girls.  This moview is primarily a drama with a number subplots all concerning various inmates and guards at the prison.  An interesting turning point in the story occurs when Coffey demonstrates the ability to heal merely by touch.  The inclusion of this single element of fantasy into an otherwise harsh reality has tremendous impact and causes ripple throughout the rest of the movie.This film has a great cast from top to bottom whether it's the big names or the character actors who get typically little credit but give a great deal of depth to the movie.  Duncan steals the show as Coffey partly due to his sheer size but also because of the great warmth and decency he brings to the character.  Hanks does as fine a job as he ever has, and that's saying something.  The movie is a bit long but there is a lot of story to cover and I never felt like it dragged at all.In short, The Green Mile is an exceptional movie.  The script is unusually intelligent, the acting top notch, and the story keeps you interested throughout it's nearly three hour running time.

Coffey has the abililty to 'heal' people and this is part of the injustice of the movie.  He is chained and taken to the warden's house to heal his wife.  There is an eerie sense to this scene where Coffey is in chains in a truck.  You wonder why he needs to be chained, he does not seem to want to run.  The warden who knows of what Coffey does for his wife, does not seem to want to help stay the execution of Coffey.This movie makes you wonder if there was, at the time, a desire to help people who were the dregs of society.  You feel frustration for a man who is unjustly accused of murder and who actually can help people.I am not sure if there is message in this story or what the intended message is.  Yet the Green Mile is a movie that shows the human side of tragedy, the intensity of death row, the cruelty and injustice of life, and that what goes around comes around, yet it may be time before that happens.There is so much to this movie that to tell it all would give it away.  See this on DVD, the TV version will really only be an introduction to the DVD.  The DVDs additional features will give some interesting insites to the movie that only the DVD can do.",5,Watching it on TV will not do it Justice - Dead Man Walking,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,2190,"['great', 'film', 'great', 'DVD.Tom', 'Hanks', 'wonderful', 'job', 'being', 'charge', 'prison', 'guards', 'who', 'guard', 'death', 'row', 'inmates', 'intense', 'movie', 'where', 'will', 'feel', 'wrath', 'killers', 'sadness', 'execution', 'injustice', 'someone', 'falsely', 'accused.This', 'movie', 'talks', 'time', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'little', 'bloody', 'scene', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'abducted', 'murdered', 'little', 'much', 'will', 'feel', 'Clarke', 'rather', 'large', 'man', 'Coffey', 'who', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'man', 'who', 'great', 'powers', 'almost', 'magical', 'yet', 'forgiving', 'captors', 'accusors', 'almost', 'willing', 'die', 'not', 'defend', 'almost', 'scripture', 'whom', 'world', 'not', 'worthy', ""'The"", 'world', 'not', 'worthy', 'Coffey', 'who', 'love', 'fellow', 'man', 'even', 'was', 'tortured', 'beaten', 'slave', 'yet', 'how', 'possible', 'so', 'young', 'still', '1930s', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'make', 'great', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'challenges', 'Tom', 'job', 'health', 'Coffey', 'abililty', ""'heal"", 'people', 'part', 'injustice', 'movie', 'chained', 'taken', 'warden', 'house', 'heal', 'wife', 'eerie', 'sense', 'scene', 'where', 'Coffey', 'chains', 'truck', 'wonder', 'why', 'be', 'chained', 'not', 'seem', 'want', 'run', 'warden', 'who', 'what', 'Coffey', 'wife', 'not', 'seem', 'want', 'help', 'stay', 'execution', 'Coffey.This', 'movie', 'wonder', 'was', 'time', 'desire', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'dregs', 'society', 'feel', 'frustration', 'man', 'who', 'unjustly', 'accused', 'murder', 'who', 'actually', 'can', 'help', 'people.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'message', 'story', 'what', 'intended', 'message', 'Green', 'Mile', 'movie', 'human', 'side', 'tragedy', 'intensity', 'death', 'row', 'cruelty', 'injustice', 'life', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'tell', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'See', 'DVD', 'TV', 'version', 'will', 'really', 'only', 'be', 'introduction', 'DVD', 'DVDs', 'additional', 'features', 'will', 'give', 'interesting', 'insites', 'movie', 'only', 'DVD', 'can', 'do']",N/A

The director, Frank  Darabont, who also directed The Shawshank Redemption(also by Stephen King),  did an excellent job. He should direct all future films based on Stephen  King novels. Tom Hanks, yet again, gives us another fine performance worthy  of being ranked with his performance in Philidelphia. But the star of the  movie is Michael Clark Duncan. His acting is just excellent, and is very  different from the ""tough guy"" roles that he usually plays. He truly is a ""gentle giant"", and was worthy of his Oscar nomination and should have won. Don't let the running time of three hours scare you off because this film is so good you will never realize it until the film is over.

36585,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,0780628799,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[8, 10]","First let me say that my title of this movie is very true.  It's not just something I thought would look good as a title.  Once you see this movie you will remember it to some degree for the rest of your life.  If you watch it alone you will tell your friends and family about it.  You will probably let them borrow it or watch it with them just so you can see it again.  The movie runs for 3 hours but I did not get tired once.  I lost myself in the movie.  When I was watching it everything around me disappeared.The movie has a great cast.  Some of the main people are Tome Hanks who plays Paul Edgecomb the head of part of a prison called the green mile (more on that later.)  You may remember Hanks from movies like Big 1988 and Philadelphia 1993.  David Morse who plays Brutus Howell. You have seen him in movies like The Getaway 1994 and 16 blocks 2006.  Michael Clark Duncan who plays John Coffey. He has bee in the films The whole nine yards  2000 and Sin City 2005.  These are just some of the great actors in this movie  They are all giving some of the greatest performances I have ever seen.Now for the movie.  I do not want to give away the big parts of the film, so I will try to tell you about it while at the same tie keeping the main stuff a mystery.  The movie is about a man that is accused of committing a horrible crime.  He is sentenced to death and sent to the green mile.  The green mile is what the men who work in this part of the prison call it.  It is death row.  The man accused may be more than a man.  You will have to watch to see what I mean.  During the end something happens that will make you so mad that he is being put to death.  You will think about it for a while.  He will hurt 2 men in the prison.  One who works there and one who has become a prisoner.  You will find out why these men had happen to them what they did.  Also, you will ask yourself why about something.  The question will be about something very important in the movie.  But you will come to find out at the very end that sometimes even good men, whom do things that may be considered good.  Must pay for that which they did.  Even if not by being in pain or suffering.  This movie will probably make you sad because you will take something the prisoner says to hank's character at the end and really think about how true it is in life.What the basic meaning of all this is, this movie will make so many people happy.  As I said earlier you will more than likely never forget it.  Buying it is a great idea because you will want to see it again.  Whether with a friend, family member or alone.  You may even want to watch it twice in a row to make sure you didn't miss anything important.  I am sure that this film is in the top 100 films ever made list.  After you watch it you can decide on your own if you think it should be or not.

36597,A1IOJE0W1NXOSE,0780628799,Karen Potts,"[1, 3]","This movie is brilliant.  The 3-hour running time may seem excessive to some, but it enables the story and characters to be slowly and thoroughly developed.  The attention to detail is exquisite and the tale lovingly and  absorbingly told. Tom Hanks is in charge of &quot;The Green Mile&quot;  where condemned killers are housed in a jail in the 30's.  Some of them are  pure evil and some, such as the man with a pet mouse, are decent human  beings who committed their crimes in a moment of all-too-human emotion.  But one of the prisoners, John Coffey, is a magnificent human being housed  in the body of a giant.  He is a black man wrongly accused of killing two  little white girls.  He possesses supernatural powers which he uses in a  sacrificial way to help others, most notably the wife of the warden who has  a terminal illness.

36599,A3BV9E9XSA4Z73,0780628799,Karl,"[3, 3]","Let me say up front that I am anything but an uncritical fan of Stephen King. I thought ""It"" was duff, both in print and on film. I wouldn't bother to watch ""Cujo"" if you paid me.  Both ""The Stand"" and ""Salem's Lot"", on the other hand, were a real pleasure, IMO.By the same token, I found ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the first collaboration between director Frank Darabont and writer Stephen King totally unmemorable. ""The Green Mile"", on the other hand, is pure cinematic gold (or platinum, maybe?)!Firstly because of the brilliant acting.Secondly for the great story line which somehow manages to be both down-to-earth and mythical, all at the same time.Tom Hanks gives an outstandingly understated performance. Hanks uses his typically laid-back approach to make his role as the senior guard on Death Row in a 1930s southern prison totally credible.Likewise David Morse, who has given so many satisfying performances over the years, is wholly convincing as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, but by implication rather than by resorting to overtly aggressive behaviour.Sam Rockwell, as William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton, plays his part as a total scumbag so well that you *may* spot the significance of his character well in advance of the punchline.  No worries, the high quality of the directing will make sure that it won't spoil the storyline even if you do.Doug Hutchison, as the governor's totally despicable nephew, also makes a good job of an unpromising character, not least because he resists the temptation to try to redeem his character by showing some tiny spark of humanity. In this respect, Doug's acting is, in a way, the best on the set.Michael Jeter also deserves an honourable mention for his portrayal of Eduard Delacroix, the kind of social inadequate who so easily ends up up spending his life in prison when a little careful guidance during his early years *might* have kept him safely on the straight and narrow. Despite being a loser, and admittedly with considerable support from Mr Jingles (a mouse) Jeter invests the role with a suitable amount of genuine character rather than letting him become feeble, tacky or maudlin.I haven't mentioned the film's co-star, Michael Clarke Duncan (playing John Coffey), because I didn't really feel that he brought the same intensity to his role as the actors I've named so far.Sure he was lovable and so on, but when you're made to look that big (in reality, Duncan is only an inch or so taller than David Morse), with such a plum role and such amazing supporting SFX it's hard not to succeed. Duncan is, IMO, workmanlike, entirely satisfactory, but not outstanding.As to the storyline, this is one of the occasions that King didn't get to work on the screenplay, and with all due respect I think that benefits the film.  It would have been all too easy for the story to topple over into pure schmaltzy mush, something that Frank Darabont, directing from his own screenplay, never allows to happen.King's personal form of spirituality seems to be pretty unorthodox, and even though some [people] see John Coffey as a parallel to Jesus Christ (John Coffey = JC = Jesus Christ) this is a tenuous association at best and maybe best ignored in order to get the most entertainment from the story.So, never less than above average, and mainly way up with the best, this is definitely one worth watching - and again, and again.Enjoy!

I'm very glad that I took the chance on this film in all respects. The movie is indeed rather long, but the acting is brilliant as well as the story captivating, and it's definitely worth a purchase at all costs.In a Louisiana nursing home in 1999, Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat. His elderly friend Elaine shows concern for him, and Paul tells her that the film reminded him of when he was a corrections officer in charge of death row inmates at Cold Mountain Penitentiary during the summer of 1935. The scene shifts to 1935, where Paul works with fellow guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Harry Terwilliger, and Dean Stanton.One day, John Coffey, a giant black man convicted of raping and killing two young white girls, arrives on death row. However, he is shy, soft-spoken, and emotional. John reveals extraordinary powers by healing Paul's urinary tract infection and resurrecting a mouse. Later, he heals the terminally ill wife of Warden Hal Moores. When John is asked to explain his power, he merely says that he ""took it back.""Percy Wetmore, a sadist with a fierce temper, has recently begun working in the death row inmates block; his fellow guards dislike him, but cannot get rid of him because of his family connections to the governor. He demands to manage the execution of Eduard Delacroix, promising that afterward, he will transfer to an administrative post at a mental hospital. An agreement is made, but Percy then deliberately sabotages the execution: Instead of wetting the sponge used to conduct electricity and make executions quick and effective, he leaves it dry, causing the execution to malfunction dramatically.Meanwhile, a violent prisoner named ""Wild Bill"" Wharton has arrived, to be executed for multiple murders committed during a robbery. At one point he seizes John's arm, and John psychically senses that Wharton is also responsible for the crime for which John was convicted and sentenced to death. John ""takes back"" the sickness in Hal's wife and regurgitates it into Percy, who then shoots Wharton to death and falls into a state of permanent catatonia. Percy is then admitted to Briar Ridge Mental Hospital as a patient rather than an administrator. In the wake of these events, Paul interrogates John, who says he ""punished them bad men"" and offers to show Paul what he saw. John takes Paul's hand and says he has to give Paul ""a part of himself"" in order for Paul to see what really happened to the girls.Paul asks John what he should do, if he should open the door and let John walk away. John tells him that there is too much pain in the world, to which he is sensitive, and says he is ""rightly tired of the pain"" and is ready to rest. For his last request on the night before his execution, John watches the film Top Hat. When John is put in the electric chair, he asks Paul not to put the traditional black hood over his head because he is afraid of the dark. Paul agrees, shakes his hand, and John is executed.As an elderly Paul finishes his story, he notes that he requested a transfer to a youth detention center, where he spent the remainder of his career. Elaine questions his statement that he had a fully grown son at the time, and Paul explains that he was 44 years old at the time of John's execution and that he is now 108. This is apparently a side effect of John giving a ""part of himself"" to Paul. Mr. Jingles, Del's mouse resurrected by John, is also still alive -- but Paul believes his outliving all of his relatives and friends (including Elaine, who is shown to have died at the end of the movie) to be a punishment from God for having John executed, and wonders how long it will be before his own death.This is such a brilliant film and yet another adaptation of a novel that was never paid its full respect.Definitely a keepsake for the truest movie buff.",5,ONE AMAZING FILM,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,4003,"['receiving', 'movie', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'here', 'there', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'quite', 'what', 'expect', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'film', 'respects', 'movie', 'indeed', 'rather', 'long', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'captivating', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchase', 'costs.In', 'Louisiana', 'nursing', 'home', '1999', 'Paul', 'Edgecomb', 'cry', 'watching', 'film', 'Top', 'Hat', 'elderly', 'friend', 'Elaine', 'shows', 'concern', 'Paul', 'film', 'reminded', 'when', 'was', 'corrections', 'officer', 'charge', 'death', 'row', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'Penitentiary', 'summer', '1935', 'scene', 'shifts', '1935', 'where', 'Paul', 'fellow', 'guards', 'Brutus', 'Brutal', 'Howell', 'Harry', 'Terwilliger', 'Dean', 'Stanton.One', 'day', 'John', 'Coffey', 'giant', 'black', 'man', 'convicted', 'raping', 'killing', 'two', 'young', 'white', 'girls', 'arrives', 'death', 'row', 'However', 'shy', 'soft-spoken', 'emotional', 'John', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'healing', 'Paul', 'urinary', 'tract', 'infection', 'resurrecting', 'mouse', 'Later', 'terminally', 'ill', 'wife', 'Warden', 'Hal', 'Moores', 'When', 'John', 'asked', 'explain', 'power', 'merely', 'took', 'back', 'Percy', 'Wetmore', 'sadist', 'fierce', 'temper', 'recently', 'begun', 'working', 'death', 'row', 'block', 'fellow', 'guards', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'family', 'connections', 'governor', 'manage', 'execution', 'Eduard', 'Delacroix', 'promising', 'afterward', 'will', 'transfer', 'administrative', 'post', 'mental', 'hospital', 'agreement', 'made', 'Percy', 'then', 'deliberately', 'execution', 'Instead', 'wetting', 'sponge', 'used', 'conduct', 'electricity', 'make', 'executions', 'quick', 'effective', 'dry', 'causing', 'execution', 'malfunction', 'dramatically.Meanwhile', 'violent', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Wharton', 'arrived', 'be', 'executed', 'multiple', 'murders', 'committed', 'robbery', 'one', 'point', 'John', 'arm', 'John', 'psychically', 'Wharton', 'also', 'responsible', 'crime', 'John', 'was', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'John', 'back', 'sickness', 'Hal', 'wife', 'Percy', 'who', 'then', 'Wharton', 'death', 'state', 'permanent', 'catatonia', 'Percy', 'then', 'admitted', 'Briar', 'Ridge', 'Mental', 'Hospital', 'patient', 'rather', 'administrator', 'wake', 'events', 'Paul', 'John', 'who', 'punished', 'bad', 'men', 'show', 'Paul', 'what', 'saw', 'John', 'Paul', 'hand', 'give', 'Paul', 'part', 'order', 'Paul', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'girls.Paul', 'John', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'should', 'open', 'door', 'let', 'John', 'walk', 'away', 'John', 'too', 'much', 'pain', 'world', 'sensitive', 'rightly', 'tired', 'pain', 'ready', 'rest', 'last', 'request', 'night', 'execution', 'John', 'film', 'Top', 'Hat', 'When', 'John', 'put', 'electric', 'chair', 'Paul', 'not', 'put', 'traditional', 'black', 'hood', 'head', 'afraid', 'dark', 'Paul', 'hand', 'John', 'executed.As', 'elderly', 'Paul', 'story', 'requested', 'transfer', 'youth', 'detention', 'center', 'where', 'spent', 'remainder', 'career', 'Elaine', 'questions', 'statement', 'had', 'fully', 'grown', 'son', 'time', 'Paul', 'was', '44', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'John', 'execution', 'now', '108', 'apparently', 'side', 'effect', 'John', 'giving', 'part', 'Paul', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'Del', 'mouse', 'resurrected', 'John', 'also', 'still', 'alive', 'Paul', 'outliving', 'relatives', 'friends', 'including', 'Elaine', 'who', 'shown', 'have', 'died', 'end', 'movie', 'be', 'punishment', 'God', 'having', 'John', 'executed', 'wonders', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'own', 'death.This', 'such', 'brilliant', 'film', 'yet', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'was', 'never', 'paid', 'full', 'respect.Definitely', 'keepsake', 'truest', 'movie', 'buff']",N/A

The same magic that flowed through their previous movie together (The Shawshank Redemption) is alive and well in this movie.  This has to be the best  adaptation from a Stephen King novel ever done.I thought the casting  choices were excellent, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan as John  Coffey.  The role required a HUGE black man who could act.  Duncan is a  perfect fit.This is one of the best movies I've seen in the past few  years.  Some people will be put off by the long running time (roughly 3 hrs  and 8 minutes), but they would be missing a deeply touching story.  Now,  I'm not saying the movie is better than the book, because it is not, but I  don't think a movie could have done any more justice to the novel than this  one did.I know I'm gushing about the movie, but why just 4 stars and not  five?  Because of the DVD.  The image quality is excellent, as is the  sound.  My problem is the extras included, or rather, the lack of extras.  All we get is a trailer (a very good one though) and an 8 minute behind the  scenes documentary (another nice one).  Other than these and a cast list,  we get nothing.  I would love to have heard a commentary with Darabont and  King, or perhaps with the actors.  What about deleted scenes (one scene  shown in the documentary isn't in the film)?  Unfortunately Warner Brothers  didn't feel the need to use the maximum potential of this DVD.  Thus the 4  stars.Overall:  If you're a fan of Stephen King, Darabont, Hanks, or  Duncan you owe it to yourself to pick up this movie.  If you don't fall  into this category, give the movie a shot.

I probably would have seen it eventually, but since Hanks is my favorite actor, I naturally couldn't miss it.  As it turned out, this movie would have been great with or without Hanks.  Each character in the movie, directed so richly by Frank Darabont, is a full-fleshed 3-D character.  There are no cardboard cut-outs in this movie.Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a both complicated and physically hurting man who runs death row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary.  Things are not exactly &quot;peas and carrots&quot; for Hanks' character; his job is strenuous enough, but he also has to deal with the infection of his manly area.  Hanks is great in these scenes; the pain on his face as he tries to relieve himself is excruciating to watch.  It made me squirm in my seat just imagining it.Things are fairly standard until a giant-sized man named John Coffey (&quot;just like the drink, only not spelled the same&quot;), played by the very talented Michael Clarke Duncan, is brought to the penitentiary.  Edgecomb and his fellow friends know immediately that there is something different about this guy.And from there the movie just gets better.  I've heard people complain about the running time (189 minutes, not counting the 10-minutes bonus feature after the film, &quot;Walking the Mile&quot;), and I can honestly say that time was never an issue with me.  If you're looking for a movie to give you a quick fix, then honey, you best be looking someplace else.  This is a beautiful and complex story and Darabont does not rush it.  He lets the story take on its own life and allows it and the characters to evolve fully.There are many wonderful scenes in this movie (and some honestly horrific ones), and one of my favorites is near the end of the film.  If you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it for you, but I will say that it makes me cry every time.  No matter how many times I brace myself for it, I still get emotionally charged by it.After the film, there is a 10-minute documentary, &quot;Walking the Mile,&quot; that has interviews with the cast, crew and writer of the film.&quot;The Green Mile&quot; is a very powerful and moving tale.  Hanks, Duncan and every other member of the cast give award-winning performances; this cannot be said for all movies.  And plus, it's got the best acting mouse in Mr. Jingles you'll ever see!  That right there should be enough incentive to give this movie a try.

My most frequent criticism of films is that they tend to be overlong, but The Green Mile, at a three full hours, needed every precious second in order to pace the story, develop its characters, and lead the viewer into the satisfying conclusion.Despite some gruesome scenes depicting the details of electric chair execution, the film is a testament to the humanity of people.  The audience gets to experience the stress of the responsibility of prison guards seeking to bring a bit of dignity to the last days of the convicted men, and we share their moral dilemma when they are faced with hard choices.Michael Clarke Duncan, cast as the simple and honest black man sentenced to die for supposedly killing two little girls, is absolutely superb and was nominated for an academy award for his outstanding performance.  He's 43 years old, 6'5&quot; tall and a former ditch digger and bodyguard.  He has the rare quality to be able to show emotion in a way that makes the audience understand the complexities of his character.Tom Hanks, of course, is excellent, giving us the kind of fine performance we have come to expect of him.  And the rest of the cast, including Michael Jeter as the villain, and David Morse as a fellow prison guard are perfect. There is also a small cameo role for Gary Sinese as the Louisiana prosecutor who believes in the guilt of the supposed killer.Directed by Frank Darabont who also shared the scripting of this film with Stephen King, every scene is constructed with just the right amount of tension to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  There was not one wasted moment.But by no means is this a simple &quot;wrongly-accused killer&quot; film.  There's a slight suspension of reality well integrated into the story line.

Even though the movie was long (over 3 hours) I was kept captivated and enjoyed it the whole time.The story  centers on the connection between a prison guard played by Tom Hanks and a  death row inmate played by Michael Clarke Duncan. They develop a unique  relationship based upon a special 'talent' of Duncan. In a way, the story  introduces the supernatural and religion from an interesting perspective  that strengthens the connection between the characters and the viewer. It  would take a while to describe all of the significant events in the movie,  but they all contribute to character development of not only the two main  characters, but the others as well (i.e. the other prison guards and  inmates).The movie is based on the Stephen King serial novel of the  same name, which I have not yet had the opportunity to read. It is an  interesting tale that will make you think about what counts in life, how  you treat others, and the distinction between good and evil.The Green  Mile is one of the few movies (another is Schindler's List) which makes  good use of 3 hours and doesn't include any extended dull periods.

Not everything  follows the book exactly, but it was near enough that I had nothing to  complain about.  In fact, the movie slightly changed some things about the  novel that I didn't really care about that much.  The fact that the novel  was published in serial form had King going back to Paul as an old man  between each part to continue the flow of the book, and to keep the reader  aware of what was going on.  Since the movie had a continual flow of its  own, it didn't require this device so they left it out, which I deeply  enjoyed.  The novel had another Percy like character working at the old age  home Paul resided at, and I didn't really feel he was necessary for the  story I was being told, so I'm glad the movie kept that part out.The  actors all did a magnificent job also.  After seeing Tom Hanks in the role  of Paul Edgecomb, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part to such  perfection.  Duncan did an excellent job as Coffey, infusing the character  with the proper touch of wonder, sadness, and his sense of isolation from  the world.  Everyone did a good job, right down to the dozen or so mice  they had that portrayed Mr. Jingle, an excellent job there.The effects  were outstanding too, from the executions, including the one that one so  horrifyingly wrong, the various miracles performed by Coffey, to the effect  of him coughing out the clouds of disease that he had taken back(as he puts  it) from each person he heals.  An outstanding job there, I just wish they  had had more on the DVD about how the effects were done, or maybe a  commentary by the director.Finally, I really enjoyed the wrap up at the  end of the movie, the punishment Paul feels he's serving for having killed  one of God's true miracles.

This movie is a lot like Shawshank, and if you liked that movie, this is pretty much a sure bet. I think Green Mile is a bit better in some ways, and less in others. There is a more supernatural element in this one that does require some suspension of belief. But it is so well done, it is a small stretch for most people. The characters are superb. Tom Hanks in particular I felt was just wonderful in this movie. But he was just the best in a whole cast of great actors and actresses.There are some scenes that definitely are not for the faint of heart.

36651,A152C8GYY25HAH,0780628799,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","The Green Mile is the second collaboration between director Frank Darabont and novelist Stephen King. The first was The Shawshank Redemption, a 1994 movie which bombed commercially, then went on to become a cult classic on video. It was generally well received critically and was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Both movies take place in prison, and The Green Mile is, if anything, even grimmer. This new effort managed to garner only four Academy nominations, but the producers were smart enough to snare Tom Hanks for the lead, which assured commercial success both here and abroad. ...The Green Mile refers to the corridor that leads to the electric chair in a Louisiana prison in 1935. The man in charge of death row is Paul Edgecomb [Tom Hanks], a fairly affable and thoughtful guy. He has a likable and loyal crew, except for Percy Wetmore [Doug Hutchison], a sick kid who does as he pleases because his uncle is the state's governor. One day, a new prisoner arrives, a huge, hulking black man called John Coffey [Michael Clarke Duncan]. He has been convicted of murdering two little white girls. [Ah, Hollywood! Does nothing ever change in your world?] While the guards are totally intimidated by John's size, they soon discover that he is mild, gentle and soft-spoken. Later, after Paul discovers John has the gift of healing, he begins to doubt John's guilt and begins to look for answers in the case.The performances are all great. Darabont is said to be very picky about casting, and he chose actors who could create memorable characters. The problem for me is that all these characters seem to be floating around in Stephen King's dark, ambiguous world. The movie is neither a horror piece not a thriller. It is more of a mystic story, yet King gets truly cynical at the end. I won't spoil the plot, but there is a scene in which certain key information is revealed. This should change everything, but it doesn't. The characters keep plodding along, mindlessly determined that the story will end in a certain way. The result is that the last hour of its monumental three hour plus running time feels every so manipulative.",3,"Actors triumph in dark, cynical film",1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2138,"['Green', 'Mile', 'second', 'collaboration', 'director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'novelist', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'was', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', '1994', 'movie', 'bombed', 'commercially', 'then', 'went', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'video', 'was', 'generally', 'well', 'received', 'critically', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'movies', 'take', 'place', 'prison', 'Green', 'Mile', 'anything', 'even', 'grimmer', 'new', 'effort', 'managed', 'garner', 'only', 'four', 'Academy', 'nominations', 'producers', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'snare', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'lead', 'assured', 'commercial', 'success', 'here', 'abroad', 'Green', 'Mile', 'refers', 'corridor', 'electric', 'chair', 'Louisiana', 'prison', '1935', 'man', 'charge', 'death', 'row', 'Paul', 'Edgecomb', '[', 'Tom', 'Hanks', ']', 'fairly', 'affable', 'thoughtful', 'guy', 'likable', 'loyal', 'crew', 'Percy', 'Wetmore', '[', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', ']', 'sick', 'kid', 'who', 'uncle', 'state', 'governor', 'One', 'day', 'new', 'prisoner', 'huge', 'hulking', 'black', 'man', 'called', 'John', 'Coffey', '[', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', ']', 'been', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'two', 'little', 'white', 'girls', '[', 'Ah', 'Hollywood', 'nothing', 'ever', 'change', 'world', ']', 'guards', 'are', 'totally', 'intimidated', 'John', 'size', 'soon', 'discover', 'mild', 'gentle', 'soft-spoken', 'Later', 'Paul', 'John', 'gift', 'healing', 'doubt', 'John', 'guilt', 'look', 'answers', 'case.The', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Darabont', 'said', 'be', 'very', 'picky', 'casting', 'chose', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'create', 'memorable', 'characters', 'problem', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'floating', 'around', 'Stephen', 'King', 'dark', 'ambiguous', 'world', 'movie', 'horror', 'piece', 'not', 'thriller', 'more', 'mystic', 'story', 'yet', 'King', 'truly', 'cynical', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'plot', 'scene', 'certain', 'key', 'information', 'revealed', 'should', 'change', 'everything', ""n't"", 'characters', 'keep', 'plodding', 'along', 'mindlessly', 'determined', 'story', 'will', 'end', 'certain', 'way', 'result', 'last', 'hour', 'monumental', 'three', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'feels', 'so', 'manipulative']",N/A

I must admit that the running time of MILE was a bit daunting.  But after watching it last night (finally!) I have a few  comments.The director (Daranbount) is an excellent story teller.  He  rivals Spielberg, who does a pretty good job of telling a story.  I enjoyed  the &quot;episodes&quot; which were told in this film.The performances  are excellent.  I was amazed at the sensitivity of the actor playing  &quot;Cofee&quot;.  Hanks is very solid.  And it is so good to see Bonnie  Hunt doing solid work as well (*on a side note, her &quot;Bonnie&quot; t.v.  series was the most refreshing thing I'd seen on t.v. in years -- she's  very talented).My problem with the movie, however, is this:  After all  the little episodes are put together, I don't believe the film!  Especially  the &quot;tag&quot; scene at the end.  Based on a Stephen King episodic  work, the film has a touch of the supernatural -- healing with hands.  Yet,  in the end, I just didn't buy it.  I wanted to.  I stayed with it for 3  hours!  I just didn't get the pay off at the end.  Now, SHAWSHANK had me  bawling like a baby.  I felt the pain and joy of those men.  GREEN MILE did  not take me there, and I wanted it to.My second quibble is the message.  Just what is this film about?  I was left unsure.  Is it about our justice  system and capitol punishment? It does seem timely what with all the  attention that death row criminals are receiving these days -- DNA tests  show many are innocent.  Is the film about miracles and love? It definitely  makes some statements about those topics.  I am left unsure.I wanted to  REALLY like this film.  I must admit that I am left a bit disappointed.  GREEN MILE is above and beyond the quality of most mediocre films -- it is  not bad.  In fact, at several points it hits a wonderful groove and works  on all levels.  At the end, however, I believe if fails to be the  &quot;film classic&quot; I was expecting.",3,Miles To Go Before I Sleep....,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,2023,"['looked', 'forward', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'must', 'admit', 'running', 'time', 'MILE', 'was', 'bit', 'daunting', 'watching', 'last', 'night', 'finally', 'have', 'few', 'comments.The', 'director', 'Daranbount', 'excellent', 'story', 'teller', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'quot', 'were', 'told', 'film.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'was', 'amazed', 'sensitivity', 'actor', 'playing', 'quot', 'Cofee', 'quot', 'Hanks', 'very', 'solid', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'doing', 'solid', 'work', 'as', 'well', '*on', 'side', 'note', 'quot', 'Bonnie', 'quot', 't.v', 'series', 'was', 'most', 'refreshing', 'thing', ""'d"", 'seen', 't.v', 'years', 'very', 'talented', '.My', 'problem', 'movie', 'however', 'little', 'episodes', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'Especially', 'quot', 'quot', 'scene', 'end', 'Based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'episodic', 'work', 'film', 'touch', 'supernatural', 'healing', 'hands', 'end', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'wanted', 'stayed', '3', 'hours', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'Now', 'SHAWSHANK', 'had', 'bawling', 'baby', 'felt', 'pain', 'joy', 'men', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'there', 'wanted', 'to.My', 'second', 'quibble', 'message', 'Just', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'unsure', 'justice', 'system', 'capitol', 'punishment', 'seem', 'timely', 'what', 'attention', 'death', 'row', 'criminals', 'are', 'receiving', 'days', 'DNA', 'tests', 'show', 'many', 'are', 'innocent', 'film', 'miracles', 'love', 'definitely', 'statements', 'topics', 'am', 'left', 'unsure.I', 'wanted', 'REALLY', 'film', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'left', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'quality', 'most', 'mediocre', 'films', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'several', 'points', 'wonderful', 'groove', 'levels', 'end', 'however', 'believe', 'fails', 'be', 'quot', 'film', 'classic', 'quot', 'was', 'expecting']",N/A

This movie shows he can play any one in any film, and he does it well.Many Stephen King movies aren't worth their weight in gold, particularly some of the ""Stephen King's"" whatever. This one, along with Carrie, is. It's worthwhile watching (even if you do need to keep your legs crossed throughout!) and it'll definitely make you re-think certain things.There any many good actors in this. Alongside Tom Hanks, there's David Morse (Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell), Bonnie Hunt (Jan Edgecomb), Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey), the late Michael Jeter (Eduard Delacroix) and Dabbs Greer - 'old' Paul Edgecomb, better known to a select few as Reverend Alden from Little House On The Prairie!There is a lot of clever camera trickery used in this movie, to make Michael Clarke Duncan look even bigger! He's a big hunk of love to begin with, and considering there's only an inch between him and David Morse to begin with, it was done very well, as Michael seems to tower over everyone. Also, quite a lot of the time, you only saw Michael's top half - I'm sure he must have been standing on something. It's the first shot(s) of him, when he first comes onto the Green Mile, and everyone looks upwards!Of course, unless you're thick as two short planks (like moi) you will have realised that Michael's character, John Coffey, has the same initials as another infamous healing character. So it's almost a modernised version of that, although maybe better and less graphic.It's obvious what will happen, but what I noticed throughout the movie, other characters get ""seen"" sitting on the electric chair, and getting electrocuted, but you don't see this with John Coffey. The camera goes somewhere else and you only get a quick shot of him sitting on it - it's almost like he got a dignified exit. I suggest if you have a very weak stomach, you turn away when Eduard Delacroix gets electrocuted. It is not pleasant, and you WILL feel sick.There is a lot of 'green mile' imagery in this movie - of course, during the main part of the film, but at the start, the floor of the nursing home is a green-ish colour.And if you're Mr(s) Know-It-All about your movies, you will perhaps notice that the music played over the loudspeakers in the retirement home as Old Paul Edgecomb first walks out of his room is the same as the music the nurses played at medication time in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!This film comes highly recommended, and the book is just as good.

It certainly does give you a whole new vision of the death penalty, and life in general.  What is truly amazing about this film is the casting!  They should have given an Oscar to all of them as the most outstanding ensemble cast in years!  It's hard to single out any one person, but if you look at the entire cast, you can see how perfect they were for their roles. Of course, Tom Hanks demonstrates why he's considered the best actor out there these days.  His portrayal of Paul Edgecomb is simply terrific.  His battle with the urinary tract infection is played marvelously, without one word of dialogue, and when he's cured, and goes to the john, the look of relief is something any male can identify with.  Truly, an astounding performance.  His face never fails to mesmerize, as he anchors this truly touching story.  His relationship with his wife (beautifully embodied by Bonnie Hunt) is so beautiful; it's rare to see in movies these days. Michael Clarke Duncan was certainly robbed by Michael Caine of his supporting actor Oscar.  Duncan is great.  A man of unbelievable size, he still evokes a gentleness and understanding of love in such a wonderful way.  His last scene with Hanks is pure gold. The rest of the cast is awesome, too.  David Morse (from &quot;St. Elsehwere&quot;) is perfect as Brutal.  All the guards seem to have a genuine love for each other, and Morse displays strength, compassion and humor in this overlooked role.  Jeffrey DeMunn and Barry Pepper as the other &quot;good&quot; guards are brilliant, too. That brings us to Doug Hutchison as Percy, perhaps the most evil and unlikeable character to ever touch celluloid.  Hutchison is brilliant in his portrayal of this evil, uncaring, unhuman guard.  What he does to Delacort in the electrocution scene is the most cold-blooded murder ever witnessed by this reviewer.  You need a strong stomach to sit through this horrible event.  Michael Jeter as Delacort, the man who gets an unusual friend in the mouse, Mr. Jingles, is awesome in his role.  Likewise, Graham Greene, only on screen for a few minutes, creates an indelible death row victim.  And it doesn't stop there: James Cromwell as the warden; Patricia Clarkson, as his dying wife; Harry Dean Stanton as the surrogate victim; Sam Rockwell as the totally irreprehensible Billy Wharton; Gary Sinise in a bit part; and of course Bonnie Hunt as Hanks' wife round out one of the best casts I've seen in years. The Green Mile is one of those movies that sticks in your mind long after you've viewed it; and I almost forgot:  Darabont's brilliant decision to cast veterans Dabbs Greer and Eve Brent as the older Hanks and his nursing home confidant.  Stunning! The movie never seemed slow, or long; it's hypnotic!  It's true film-making at its best.

36665,A7FJVRLMG5BF9,0780628799,Michael JR Jose,"[0, 0]","This review covers the two-disc special edition which lasts about three hours. The first disc is rated 18, the second 12, but do not be misled, I found the emotional impact of the second is as great as the first, and not for the deaths to come. I understand the negative reviews that some have given this movie. I was quite prepared to give it a one star rating after about the first 15 slow minutes. But I watched the whole thing. And gave it five stars.It is hard to sum the film up without making it seem a silly, shallow fable. And that would be wrong as this film is a tragedy above all. It manages to do miracles akin to sheer magic without letting it get out of control, or fall into the 'let's rub the magic lamp and the genie will fix it' easy approach. It is deeply moving and believable throughout. The only part that stretched my credibility was how quickly the guards agreed to the plan to get the Miracle Prisoner in contact with the sick wife.The magic lies in the acting and the story itself. All fiction requires 'suspension of disbelief'. Sometimes the coincidences are too much, sometimes the illogicalities cannot be glossed over quickly enough. In this case all you have to accept is that the man has a gift. There is no science in it, and some would say it is anti-scientific. But it would foolish to agree with them. Science may be food for the mind and food for the body, but this is food for the soul and the heart. We may value science and technology, but we do not let them dictate our values - they have none. We will not be subject to objects.At the end of it all there is still mystery - the story is told in flashback. But the old man cannot get it all straight in his head or his heart.

36667,AURZ4YQ270W3T,0780628799,Mike Freed,"[3, 5]","If there ever was a movie made to win a bunch of Oscars, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is it. It has the serious story, the serious actors, and the serious length that the Academy likes to reward with serious numbers of statuettes.But it's this calculated &quot;We're making a Great, Important Film&quot; attitude that really hamstrings &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, a good film that could have been far better with less liberal doses of gravitas.This isn't to say that &quot;The Green Mile&quot; doesn't have its strong points; it's beautifully made, well acted, and does have some wonderful moments.To begin with, the cast is excellent. Tom Hanks turns in another wonderful everyman performance as prison death row guard Paul Edgecombe, who tries to let his charges live with as much dignity and respect as a person waiting for his turn in the electric chair can.The rest of the actors portraying Edgecombe's crew are also fine, but Doug Hutchinson stands out as the smarmy, abusive Percy Wetmore, a man who most assuredly gets what he deserves. Harry Dean Stanton has a great turn as Toot Toot, a old-timer con who helps Edgecombe's crew rehearse executions. (&quot;I'm fryin! I'm a done tom turkey!&quot; he exclaims from the electric chair, as Edgecombe pretends to turn on the juice.)Frank Darabont's direction is suave and self-assured; like his previous film, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; portrays prison life with just the right amount of depressing reality and everyday humanity. And though &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is too long, you have to hand it to Darabont for making the film long enough for its various characters and storylines to flesh themselves out; too bad he spent too much time focusing on Mr. Jingles, the prison's resident circus mouse.The problems with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; start with Mr. Jingles and John Coffey, a huge, powerful, but barely coherent man who lands in Edgecombe's care for killing and molesting two young girls. As time goes on, it becomes apparent that John Coffey has magical healing powers (check the initials); he heals Edgecombe's urinary infection and the warden's brain tumor, and even fixes Mr. Jingles after Percy crushes him. The plot centers around Edgecombe's growing certainty that Coffey couldn't possibly be guilty of the heinous crime that landed him on death row; the Big Question - whether they can execute this guy or not - is the other plot center.Michael Clarke Duncan plays Coffey as a virtual mountain of pain, and the pain shows through in every shot. Problem is, there's not much more to Coffey than pain, and that's a major failing of the film, and of Duncan's performance. Perhaps the original point of the Coffey character was to show a man who simply wanted to die, but Coffey is so depressing and one-dimensional, and dominates so many scenes, that I suspect a goodly part of the audience wanted to see him die after the first hour.That brings us to the subject of length. The main criticism of &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is that it's too long, and I agree. Having said that, I don't mind long movies at all...as long as they give me fascinating characters and situations, and don't beat me about the head and face with how important they are. This is why other long movies like &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, or even &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; seem to fly by, while &quot;The Green Mile&quot; drags dutifully and laboriously onward.Thankfully, Darabont wisely avoids the trap of talking too much about capital punishment; given the film's subject matter and a particularly brutal execution sequence, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; could have been an anti- (or pro-) execution manifesto. But given that that death by electric chair - a particularly grisly death AND topic if ever there was one - lurked behind every frame of this film, couldn't it have focused more on people and less on Big Themes like the Messianic Man Who Must Die?Darabont's mistake wasn't making &quot;The Green Mile&quot; too long; it was filling &quot;The Green Mile&quot; with so much fluff (like the mouse), self-importance, and Great Cinema flourishes that the movie sagged under the weight of its own inflated self-expectations. That's sad, because &quot;The Green Mile&quot; could have been a lean, mean, prison fable that really would have walked off with a zillion Oscars.",3,Good movie that is hamstrung by its own 'gravitas',972950400,"10 31, 2000",2000,4377,"['ever', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'win', 'bunch', 'Oscars', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'serious', 'story', 'serious', 'actors', 'serious', 'length', 'Academy', 'reward', 'serious', 'numbers', 'statuettes.But', 'calculated', 'quot', ""'re"", 'making', 'Great', 'Important', 'Film', 'quot', 'really', 'hamstrings', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'less', 'liberal', 'doses', 'gravitas.This', ""n't"", 'say', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'points', 'beautifully', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'have', 'wonderful', 'moments.To', 'begin', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'wonderful', 'everyman', 'performance', 'prison', 'death', 'row', 'guard', 'Paul', 'Edgecombe', 'who', 'let', 'charges', 'live', 'as', 'much', 'dignity', 'respect', 'person', 'waiting', 'turn', 'electric', 'chair', 'can.The', 'rest', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Edgecombe', 'crew', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'Doug', 'Hutchinson', 'out', 'smarmy', 'abusive', 'Percy', 'Wetmore', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'assuredly', 'what', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'great', 'turn', 'Toot', 'Toot', 'old-timer', 'con', 'who', 'Edgecombe', 'crew', 'rehearse', 'executions', 'quot', ""'m"", 'fryin', ""'m"", 'done', 'tom', 'turkey', 'quot', 'electric', 'chair', 'Edgecombe', 'turn', 'juice', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'direction', 'suave', 'self-assured', 'previous', 'film', 'quot', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'quot', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'portrays', 'prison', 'life', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'depressing', 'reality', 'everyday', 'humanity', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'hand', 'Darabont', 'making', 'film', 'long', 'enough', 'various', 'characters', 'storylines', 'flesh', 'out', 'too', 'bad', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'focusing', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'prison', 'resident', 'circus', 'mouse.The', 'problems', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'start', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'John', 'Coffey', 'huge', 'powerful', 'barely', 'coherent', 'man', 'who', 'Edgecombe', 'care', 'killing', 'molesting', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'time', 'apparent', 'John', 'Coffey', 'magical', 'healing', 'powers', 'check', 'initials', 'Edgecombe', 'urinary', 'infection', 'warden', 'brain', 'tumor', 'even', 'fixes', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'Percy', 'plot', 'centers', 'Edgecombe', 'growing', 'certainty', 'Coffey', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'guilty', 'heinous', 'crime', 'landed', 'death', 'row', 'Big', 'Question', 'can', 'execute', 'guy', 'not', 'other', 'plot', 'center.Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Coffey', 'virtual', 'mountain', 'pain', 'pain', 'shot', 'Problem', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Coffey', 'pain', 'major', 'failing', 'film', 'Duncan', 'performance', 'Perhaps', 'original', 'point', 'Coffey', 'character', 'was', 'show', 'man', 'who', 'simply', 'wanted', 'die', 'Coffey', 'so', 'depressing', 'one-dimensional', 'dominates', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'suspect', 'goodly', 'part', 'audience', 'wanted', 'see', 'die', 'first', 'subject', 'length', 'main', 'criticism', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'too', 'long', 'agree', 'Having', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'long', 'movies', 'as', 'long', 'give', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'face', 'how', 'important', 'are', 'why', 'other', 'long', 'movies', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'even', 'quot', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'quot', 'seem', 'fly', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'dutifully', 'laboriously', 'onward.Thankfully', 'Darabont', 'wisely', 'trap', 'talking', 'too', 'much', 'capital', 'punishment', 'given', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'execution', 'sequence', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anti-', 'pro-', 'execution', 'manifesto', 'given', 'death', 'electric', 'chair', 'particularly', 'grisly', 'death', 'topic', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'lurked', 'frame', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'people', 'less', 'Big', 'Themes', 'Messianic', 'Man', 'Who', 'Must', 'Die', 'Darabont', 'mistake', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'filling', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'so', 'much', 'fluff', 'mouse', 'self-importance', 'Great', 'Cinema', 'movie', 'sagged', 'weight', 'own', 'inflated', 'self-expectations', 'sad', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lean', 'mean', 'prison', 'fable', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'off', 'zillion', 'Oscars']",N/A
36668,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,0780628799,"Mike London ""MAC""","[5, 5]","A movie that does not fail to deliver the goods.  It is perhaps the best movie adaptation of the 90s, or in recent times.  It tells the story of John Coffey, a Christ-like figure who has the power to heal.  It is set  back in the 1930s, with Tom Hanks as one of the main people at the prison.  Every one of the cast does an outstanding job.  It would also be noticed  that one of Hank's men is the sniper who quotes scripture in SAVING PRIVATE  RYAN (another outstanding film with Hanks in the lead role).The novel  itself is an anomaly.  It was published in serial format, and all six parts  were on the best sellers list.  The only time that has happened was in a  separate field, when The Beatles dominated the top ten with (I think) 8 of  the top ten back in 1963.This movie is the rarest of breeds.  Darabont  out does himself.  I did not know THE GREEN MILE was also directed by the  man who did Shawhank.  SHAWHANK, is a very impressive movie, but this  leaves it in the dirt.  To anyone who has seen SHAWHANK, they know what a  great film that is.  Now imagine that achievement doubled, perhaps tripled.  Truly two of the best prison movies of Hollywood.  Not only is THE GREEN  MILE equal to King's novel, it perhaps also betters it, leaving little out.  Only very rarely does this happen where the quality of a movie reaches the  quality of the book..  The story is fully realised on the screen.  The  horror of a botched execution is brought to the watcher, and then with a  steak drives it fully home.  Percy's evilness is contrasted sharply with  Coffey's goodness.  Mr. Bojangles, the mouse, is a nice little part in the  movie also.It also brings out an aspect of King which I have believed  for a while.  One gets the impression that the author knows about God, and  knows what God is capable of, but is confused.  Although not called so in  terms of the movie, but Coffey is obviously a Christian.  He loves  everyone, and wants to use his gift to do what he can for other people.  A  Christian writer could have told the same story, and very little difference  would be in the plot.

36672,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0780628799,Mike Stone,"[6, 9]","When we say that a movie is too long, we mean one of two things:It is so inept and boring, that time appears to slow down while we're watching it, making it seem too long.OrThe filmmaker's had some good material to work with, but not enough to justify the extended length.""The Green Mile"" falls smack dab in the middle of category number two.  So, how could it have been shortened, and thus made better?My first suggestion is to get rid of the old people.  Or, tidy up their scenes.  I understand the need for this hackneyed framing device (it becomes clear in the end), but somewhere between concept and execution, the idea falls on hard times.  Firstly, the old people they cast are horrible actors.  It appears that the crew set up shop in a nursing home one afternoon, handed out copies of the script, and rolled film.  Every emotion is artificially heightened, every line reading is stilted, and no one comes across as believable.  Second, I don't think the prologue / epilogue adds anything to the film, except to give the filmmakers an opportunity to once again spell out their message, in case one or two members of the audience missed it the first forty times.  Okay, so we edit out the old people scenes, and that cuts off, what, fifteen minutes of screen time.Next, we have way too many executions.  They're all done well, bringing the right amount of pathos to the proceedings, without ever being manipulative (well, one is, but it kind of had to be to make its point).  But overkill (pun intended) is still overkill.  We have three executions, shown in their entirety, plus a couple of dry run trial executions (I hate being the one recommending Harry Dean Stanton should wind up on the cutting room floor, but here we are).  I say, show the bare bones only of the first one, show bits and pieces of the trial runs, show only the important bits of the second one (this should be obvious), and lay it all on the line for the third one.  That should cut another ten or so minutes from the film.There's a scene where Tom Hank' Paul Edgecomb goes to visit Gary Sinise, the lawyer who represented John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).  It does nothing to further the story, or Paul's perceptions of Coffey, and can be exorcised neatly.  Plus, it tries to fuel the fires of an issue (racism) that until this point hadn't been brought up, and, given the film's tone, really didn't need to be brought up so explicitly by a secondary character.  We can see that racism is a factor without Sinise's blatant pejorative.  Okay, so that's another five minutes lost.Finally, there are two characters here who get way too much screen time, much of it redundant.  Doug Hutchinson's Percy is a cowardly little skunk.  We get that information from his first couple scenes.  Then we get it over and over again.  I'd have him in the background, only emerging for his confrontations with Michael Jeter's Del (and then for Del's execution).  Hutchinson does a fine job with the role (you will hate Hate HATE Percy), but he was too big a part.  Sam Rockwell, as Wild Bill, a newly arrived inmate, also serves a purpose, but to less a degree than his screen time would justify.  Rockwell, in some scenes, is allowed to go off for pages and pages of rambling and nonsensical dialogue.  He's a whacked out hard case.  We get it.  Move on to the story, please.  Okay, that should trim another ten minutes or so.Which means we have a nice, lean two hour and twenty minute film.  Probably still too long given the story they're telling, but not unbearable by any means.Okay, so why does ""The Green Mile"" fall into category two instead of the dreaded category one?  For a film that feels so much like a stage play (the minimalist sets, unlike the realistic and tarnished prison from ""The Shawshank Redemption"", felt too clean and too pure to represent anything from the real world) it's got to be about the actors.  Hanks, of course, is just solid.  Paul is not a hero by any means, and, as most have said, he probably makes the wrong choice in the end.  But it was his choice to make, and Hanks ably shows the angst it took to make that choice.  Plus, he gets to play pain and indignity, as Paul has a wicked bladder infection throughout the film's first third.Paul's men, played by David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn are all excellent.  Morse is every bit Hanks' equal in the tough scenes the two have together.  Pepper is good at playing the wide-eyed innocent, just starting out on the job, unaware of the horrors he's about to see.  And DeMunn is mainly about quiet dignity, and in the end, confusion as to what the right thing to do would be.Michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, did an excellent job, although for the most part he was nearly unintelligible.  Sure, that's the character (uneducated, talking in backwoods slang), but between the mumbled dialogue, and the 1930s jargon, I had a tough time figuring out what he had to say.  To remedy this, I recommend turning on the DVD's subtitles.  This fixes one problem, and brings about another.  Even though Coffey is supposed to be touched by God, his speeches were way too poetic for a man of his education.  And other times, he lacks any poetry in his speech at all.  He's an inconsistently written character.  Credit should go to Duncan, who does a fine, charismatic job bringing this hulking but innocent man to life.While not nearly as good as Frank Darabont's last Stephen King-in-a-prison adaptation, ""The

36674,AUSATFDSU2INS,0780628799,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[2, 2]","Based on a Stephen King novel, in 1994 was released a film called The Shawshank Redemption, adapted and directed by Frank Darabont. With a moderate success and forceful critic praise, The Shawshank Redemption conquered seven Oscar nominations.The script was pure dynamite. Darabont was able with The Shawshank Redemption - as never before did other films based on novels of King -, to transmit an emotional force that was impossible to resist. The secret was staying faithful to the original manuscript, preserving the essence of history. Summarizing, Darabont knew how to expose why like so much Stephen King novels.Because they are stories well told.It's true; they are not Shakespeare, Cervantes or Balzac. They are not intricate philosophical paradigms or moral dilemmas that make us reflect on the questions that life holds. They simply are books that captivate us because they entertain us in a pleasant way. They are frank, gripping and sure, they make us laugh or cry.Now, Darabont returns with his adaptation of The Green Mile, a work that, as The Shawshank Redemption, is extraordinarily faithful to the original manuscript.In 182 minutes, the director condensed a history that takes place in a southern prison, in the years after the Great Depression.In Louisiana, Cold Mountain penitentiary has a block that receives inmates sentenced to death penalty. A linoleum corridor separates two rows of cells, where criminals rest next to their guards, waiting a crucial of their lives: death in the electrical chair. That cell block is called the ""green mile"", in a metaphor to the color of the floor tiles where those men walk to a destiny served by justice.Year after year, Paul Edgecomb and his guards observe the men that come to their final stroll by the mile, guilty, innocents, and sometimes lunatic, other indifferent ones. But nothing Edgecomb had lived until then could prepare him for a black man of formidable contexture called John Coffey, guilty of the death and violation of two local children.Coffey intrigues Edgecomb and his guards, because in spite of his size, he behaves like a ingenuous boy, with smooth voice and afraid of the dark. For Edgecomb it's practically impossible to think that Coffey has committed a crime. Much more when he sees him practice miracles as generous as his good heart. Therefore, when the time comes to execute Coffey, Edgecomb is not able to walk that last stroll by the green mile.Three hours free of cynicism, filled with good moments, extremely emotional situations where sentimentality and manipulation abound, where the mysticism is viable until becoming a reality. It is impossible not to be seduced by this beauty. If you can leave at home your cynicism detector, you will enjoy this film enormously.The whole cast offers wonderful interpretations, from Tom Hanks like the comprehensive Edgecomb to Michael Clarke Duncan like the enigmatic Coffey. Magnificent also are Doug Hutchinson like the ruthless Percy Whitmore, David Morse, in the comprehensive and faithful role of Brutal, Bonnie Hunt, the sweet wife, Michael Jeter, the French conquered by a little mouse and Patricia Clarkson, the special lady who can in John Coffey's eyes what's in his soul.Darabont, obviously, doesn't have limits directing. In slow motion, he doesn't know when he has said enough, when he has unfolded too many miracles, when a horrible execution has lasted so long that the audience has to turn around their heads from that much horror. He sweetens what's already been sweetened; he magnifies events, dazzling us with his seduction tactics.

However, Darabonts' storytelling has raised those two movies, including ""The Green Mile,"" above the usual mediocre King adapted movies and into the realm of greatness.  His touch behind the camera is impeccable, and he moves the story at an unforced pace to illustrate its themes and deftly paints its characters.  He also has an uncanny ability to choose brilliant casts, as he does here.  He brings in Tom Hanks, the most reliable actor in Hollywood to play the lead as Paul Edgecombe, and Michael Clark-Duncan as the walking miracle John Coffey. He also brings in David Morse as Brutus, James Cromwell as the Warden, Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, Sam Rockwell as Wild Bill and Doug Hutchinson at his best as Percy.Paul Edgecombe is a prison guard during the Depression, and into his midst comes a mammoth inmate named John Coffey, who was wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls.  But he is a gentle soul, and Paul and his fellow guards have a hard time comprehending that this man could have killed two little girls at all.  Over time, Coffey reveals his extraordinary gift:  He is a healer, some sort of a miracle worker, able to cure any ailment or disease.  He does so at first, by curing Paul's urinary infection.  But one fact keeps bothering the guards, Paul most of all:  should this miracle be executed or, more importantly, is he possibly innocent.  Darabont's script and direction keeps everything tight as it moves towards the emotionally wrenching and draining ending, one that leaves you tearless because you have spent them all.Everything in the ""Green Mile"" is laudable, right down to the gritty set decoration and perfectly crafted period-set costumes and locales.  Frank Darabont crafted a masterpiece with the ""Green Mile"" one that can stand up to his other work of brilliance, ""The Shawshank Redemption.""

Tom Hanks has proven himself as a &quot;Heinz 57&quot; actor:  there is no genre he must  limit himself too. He's funny in such classics as &quot;Big&quot; and  &quot;The Bachelor Party.&quot;  He's serious in &quot;Philadelphia&quot;  and &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  To put is simply, talent runs through his  veins.The Green Mile begins many years after the depression.  Our main  character is older and decides to tell the story of his job as a guard on  Death Row, aka, The Green Mile, during the Depression.  We meet the other  characters, including the obnoxious Percy, and find each actor posessing  the ability to portray him or her with great validity.  While attempting to  avoid giving away the plot, I must admit I was surprised by the twists and  turns within the movie.  I'm not much of a Stephen King fan, but I find  myself wanting to get a hold of this book in order to compare it with the  movie. Like many other writers, I fell in love with the character of John  Coffey, so amazingly performed by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Being a miracle  worker, as it turns out, isn't as easy as it seems.This movie also  allowed me to review my beliefs when it comes to the death penalty.  While  I favor it, I think we need to be absolutely sure of a person's guilt  before pulling a trigger, injecting a poison, tying a rope or turning a  switch.  It allowed me the opportunity to re-evaluate circumstantial  evidence.To end, I want to make a comment about Percy.  I must say I  was delighted with the interaction between him and &quot;Wild Bill.&quot;  Both got what they deserved.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[6, 10]","Anyone expecting a replay of Darabont's masterful interpretation of Stephen King's 'The Shawshank Redemption' would definitely be disappointed here.  Quite frankly, this is much more a Hollywood movie than Darabont's last.  The movie, also based on a Stephen King story, will test your patience with its length and although good in its own way, it never truly inspires.  Set in the Great Depression the story has Michael Clarke Duncan as a man sent to The Green Mile (the green walkway that leads to the electric chair) for the murders of two little girls.  Prison warden Hanks quickly discovers however, that things aren't what they seem when the soft-spoken prisoner heals him of an infection.There's a lot to say in this movie's favour.  As usual Hanks's good guy is never less than satisfactory, and Michael Clarke Duncan manages to bring a sense of emotion to his role.  Most impressive however are the electric chair scenes, which are shocking just as much as they are compelling.  Quite simply there has never been a more graphic movie against the death penalty.  There's also a nice little subplot with a malicious prison guard that likes to take out his own inadequacies on the prisoners.Still, there is a definite tendancy to sentimentalise and the theme of friendship and human worth is always pushed that little bit too far.  In addition, there are several elements, such as a cutesy pet mouse, that were completely unnecesary to the story's flow and the conclusion is hurried and overly tearful.  However, that isn't to say that it's a bad movie.  Far from it, there's a lot of worth here, but it's just as conventional as every other Hollywood prison movie.",3,Doesn't meet expectations,1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,1671,"['Anyone', 'expecting', 'replay', 'Darabont', 'masterful', 'interpretation', 'Stephen', 'King', ""'The"", 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'much', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Darabont', 'last', 'movie', 'also', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'will', 'test', 'patience', 'length', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'never', 'truly', 'inspires', 'Set', 'Great', 'Depression', 'story', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'man', 'sent', 'Green', 'Mile', 'green', 'walkway', 'electric', 'chair', 'murders', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'Prison', 'warden', 'Hanks', 'quickly', 'however', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'when', 'soft-spoken', 'prisoner', 'heals', 'infection.There', 'lot', 'say', 'movie', 'favour', 'usual', 'Hanks', 'good', 'guy', 'never', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'bring', 'sense', 'emotion', 'role', 'Most', 'impressive', 'however', 'are', 'electric', 'chair', 'scenes', 'are', 'shocking', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'compelling', 'Quite', 'simply', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'graphic', 'movie', 'death', 'penalty', 'also', 'nice', 'little', 'subplot', 'malicious', 'prison', 'guard', 'take', 'out', 'own', 'inadequacies', 'prisoners.Still', 'definite', 'tendancy', 'sentimentalise', 'theme', 'friendship', 'human', 'worth', 'always', 'pushed', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'addition', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'such', 'cutesy', 'pet', 'mouse', 'were', 'completely', 'unnecesary', 'story', 'flow', 'conclusion', 'hurried', 'overly', 'tearful', 'However', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'Far', 'lot', 'worth', 'here', 'just', 'as', 'conventional', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'prison', 'movie']",N/A

His performance is great, but the overlong movie surrounding it is pretty lame.  Too much time dealing with mice, not enough character depth.

36691,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,0780628799,Mr. Cairene,"[13, 18]","It was very easy for many cynical reviewers to rip this movie apart. After all the story is episodic. The portrayal of the prisoners unfair since it lets us feel great sympathy for them not having seen their crimes. It could  also be argued that John Coffey's miracle scenes were overstated with  unneccesary special effects. But how can I sit here and analyise the faults  of a movie that brought to tears to my eyes.John Coffey, as played by  Micheal Clarke Duncan in a beautiful performance, is a man who physically  feels the pain of the wrongs people do to each other. &quot;I am tired of  all the uglyness people do to each other&quot;, he is a man who feels the  pain of all humanity's wrong doings. His size is symbolic of that,  expressing years of absorbed pain. Now tired, constantly in tears, all he  wants in the world is the ability to &quot;take it back&quot;, undo  everyone else's wrongs.The Green Mile contains another pleasant  surprise, Tom Hanks. After a last couple of years of playing characters  with no edge, his Paul Edgecomb is a moraly conflicted man capable of  violence, revenge and guilt. Welcome back Tom.Amazing how this film  balances all the different tones it does. One particular sequence involving  the rehearsal of an execution will have you laughing out loud, only to be  in shocked disbeleif at the actual execution just minutes later. A point of  contention about this film is the nessecity of the present day framing  sequences, and although I usually don't like this device, I think it works  well here giving the story a larger scope, magnifying the effects of John  Coffey.Frank Darabont's last film was The Shawshank Redemption, one  of the best films of the 1990s and obviously a hard act to follow. The  Green Mile is not as good as that, but it is a moving, powerful and unique  film in its own right.

36692,A3T0OTH5072YRE,0780628799,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","This is one of my favorite movies.  What makes that even funnier was that I just saw the whole thing for the first time a few days ago.  Before I would always catch it on tv an hour or so in and never saw the beginning.  Now that I've had the chance to see the complete movie, I love it even more.Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a guard in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary working on death row.  Also known as the ""Green Mile"" because of its faded lime colored tile, it is a ward that doesn't hold too many prisoners.  We first meet Paul when he is in a nursing home and largely the movie is  him reminiscing about a particular summer.  A summer in which he had a really bad urinary tract infection and a summer in which he meets John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).Coffey is a towering hulk of a man who has been sent to the prison to await his fate at the electric chair.  Accused of raping and killing two young girls there is something a little strange about this man.  Seemingly gentle he has a way about him that is almost childlike.  The guards and Paul soon discover that there is more to him than meets the eye.  Especially when he starts performing miracles.Not everyone likes him though.  A young guard who has friends in high places, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) makes life terrible for all in the ward, even his fellow guard Brutus Howell (David Morse) and a few others.  He does make a friend in Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) a fellow inmate when he heals his remarkably smart pet mouse Mr. Jingles.  There is another inmate on the ward as well.  The incredibly brutal and psychotic Wild Bill Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who doesn't like Coffey and has a sinister past.Paul must run the ward the best he can but with all these personalities and conflicting emotions makes it tough.  Especially when Percy commits the unforgivable and endangers everyone.  With this and a daring healing involving Coffey, things are not very calm on the Green Mile.All the actors in this movie did amazing jobs.  Hanks plays a believable sympathetic guard and it is easy to relate with him.  Coffey is a sad character but there is something very special about him and actor Duncan plays him very convincingly.  About the best actor in this film though would be Hutchinson for his portrayal of Percy.  He did such a wonderful job I actually hated Percy and wanted to slug the little jerk.  A close second was Rockwell's interpretation of the crazy Wild Bill.I also enjoyed the music in this film.  Most of it was instrumental but I've always been a fan of the song ""Dancing cheek to cheek"". All of the music fit in well with the scenes in which it was played.  Another part of the movie was the special effects.  There weren't a whole lot of them, but what was used was tastefully done and entirely believable. They had a great interpretation of Coffey expelling the ""toxins"" he took out of people.I should include a bit of a warning about some of the scenes in this movie.  Because it is a movie about death row in a prison, there are execution scenes.  One of them is especially horrific and children might not be able to handle it.  There is also violence done to a mouse (no animals harmed in real life of course) which could be disturbing for younger children.  In addition to this, some of the paranormal aspects could be frightening for younger crowds as well.Wonderful movie filled with great actors and performances.  Out of all the Stephen King movies out there, this is definitely one of the better ones.Review by M.

If I hadn't read the book first, I really doubt I would have liked  this movie as much as I did. In fact, I might have wondered if the story  line was put together by a committee.Negatives first (fewer of them!):  No novel can translate to film untouched and some things that work on print  just don't on the screen and vice versa. And as this movie was already  three hours long considerable cutting was necessary. But if so, then why  put in a gratuitous and somewhat senseless extra scene at the end?  Moreover, the film cut all the narration that tied together the different  subplots in the book; the movie would have improved immeasurably if just a  little had been retained. Acting was unformly high quality but a character  who's supposed to be a dangerous sadist comes off as simply petulant and  dumb; you're even tempted to feel a little sorry for him in the end. And  exploding light bulbs can be a great effect in small doses; here it was so  overused I started expecting to see some old trusty doing  lightbulb-changing chores, grumbling that these guys go through them like  water....Pluses! The main set just took my breath away; I watched the  first half hour over and over just to catch the full-length shots of it.  All the acting is superb but Hanks is particularly subtle; watch for tiny  but significant changes in facial expression and vocal quality. And listen  carefully to the sound track; it's very powerful and affecting without  going overboard on volume, an excess all too popular in movies in recent  years.See it!

If you read the book and then watch the movie, comparing all the subtle differences and changes made to the story, you are really wasting your time.I read the Green Mile and then watched it shortly after and I am conviced this is one of the best film adaptions ever made.  The cast is simply amazing, straight out of the book.  Michael Duncan Clarke, is John Coffey . . . ""like the drink only not spelled the same.""  Tom Hanks was an even more compelling Paul Edgecomb than in the book.  The set design is equally flawless, just how I imagined it as I read the book.Now to comment on the actual storyline of The Green Mile, the heart and soul of the film/book. The Green Mile is a story which captures the spectrum of human emotion, evoking pain, hatred, sadness and joy.  It follows the account of Paul Edgecomb, a warden on prison block E, death row.  He witnesses the deaths of many types of men, the pitiful, the deserving and the innocent.The Green Mile in many ways is an abstract, allegorical retelling of the christian story: John Coffey with the purity and divinity of Christ, Paul Edgecomb an apostle-like witness, the devilish Wild Bill, and Percy, a Judah incarnate.  Having said that I won't reveal what happens to these characters, but like the christ story it is both a tragedy and a triumph.

Rest assured, gentle friend, because these three hours go by quickly.  If you are a fan of Stephen King, 1994's similarily-themed  Shawshank Redemption, or fans of Drama or Tom Hanks, you will by no doubt  love this movie.The movie is adapted from the Stephen King series  about a gentle, kind-hearted big boat of a black man who is sent to  &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (named because death row is known as &quot;the  Last Mile,&quot; but since the floors of the prison are lime-colored, it  has been named in accordance) for killing two little girls.  He befriends  Hanks and as time goes on, Hanks' character strongly belives that this man  could not have possibly committed a crime so brutal.This movie is  good, but not deserving of the awards it was nominated for.  I think it's a  movie that you can watch to feel good, much like Shawshank Redemption, only  that film has so much of a better message and leaves you with a better  understanding of the point it was trying to make.

36713,A1NUWD3DMZMY0S,0780628799,"Odilon ""odilon""","[2, 3]","I hope that the DVD format allows more films like GREEN MILE to be made.The film's length (3 hours) and its slow pace are problems.  However,  the DVD format made it very convenient to break the film into shorter  installments to watch over time.  That's good because I don't see how it  could have been shorter without wrecking it.  I haven't read the book (by  Stephen King) but I understand that this film is supposed to be quite  faithful to it and that the length was necessary to accomplish that.  Book  adaptation issues aside, the slow pace allows the viewer to inhabit the  world in which the action takes place.  For me, that was one of the film's  greatest strengths.Another problem is that some might have trouble  buying the world it creates.  The film depicts a 1930's Louisiana death  row.  The guards are (with one glaring exception) very decent men who tend  the inmates with great kindness and respect.  They also execute them with  similar kindness and respect.  The inmates, meanwhile, (once again with one  glaring exception) seem decent- ordinary men who perhaps made serious  mistakes along the way.  They go to their deaths with dignity and  resignation. No one seems to question the justice of all this. It's simply  the order of the world, apparently.That it seems plausible at all owes  much to the flawlessly cast ensemble of actors (of which Tom Hanks is just  one member and includes, among its standouts, David Morse and Michael  Jeter).  It also owes a great deal to the skilled visual design which makes  the prison environment seem physically real.  However, for those who can't  accept the curious mix of idealism and realism that makes up this film's  universe, the time spent there won't make sense. Also, the last portion of  the film often doesn't measure up to the earlier parts, perhaps because  it's difficult to bring the kind of issues raised here to a conclusion  without seeming too pat.Still, this film doesn't pull every punch.  For  example, there are several graphic depictions of death in the electric  chair. Conflict develops when a condemned inmate (Michael Clark Duncan in  an Oscar nominated performance) appears to be not only innocent but a saint  with miraculous healing powers.  Ultimately this causes one guard to ask  regarding this man's imminent execution: &quot;What I am going to say [to  God] on the day of my judgment?  That it was my job?&quot;This  thoughtful, haunting film is not naive by any means.

36731,A2N9E02BZYBU7K,0780628799,"Plom de Nume ""Rob""","[2, 2]","The Green Mile is probably the most genuinely ""poetic"" film we'll see. Yes, there's plenty of lyricism out there; profundity, too. But if the true business of poetry is to evoke feelings and make complex statements about (oh dear) the meaning of life, and to do it beautifully and intelligently; with accessibility yet subtlety, craft and seduction; within thematically cohesive, not obviously philosophical yet deeply meaningful contexts; with coherent, focused, not necessarily epic or artsy narrative and imagery that follows a scheme and embellishes the experience; with tight language and a balance of sentiment with austerity... well, you get the idea: this film shouldn't obviously be ""art"" - it's a prison movie, after all. But it works like the best poetry, in the end.Yet it originally took my Father to point out that we ought to see The Green Mile. A neighbour had lent him his copy and Dad - probably your least forgiving critic when it comes to films-of-books - went into Urgent Recommendation Mode. He kept saying, especially, ""The mouse is brilliant.""I had two reactions to this: one, apprehensive - animals in films either wreck me (when they buy the farm or get mistreated); or I get antagonised by anthropomorphic sentimentality. Old Yeller liquefied me as a kid and later sponsored resentment at its manipulation; it was the other way round with Bambi - initial resistance followed by appreciation of the didactic message on bereavement. With Lady and the Tramp, I just blub every time in appreciation at how exquisitely it's all realised: gorgeous drawings, vocal magnificence from Stan Freberg et al, Italian food, a romantic ballad, dogs by candlelight - irresistible!So: did I really want to sit through a long film, even with a ""brilliant"" mouse? especially with a brilliant mouse, given the emotional possibilities. Then again: mere mice don't evoke the same sympathies as dogs, do they? But wouldn't I rather read the book, in any case? Yes, ""Shawshank"" had been a superb film; but the Green Mile trailers had made it look both restricted in scope and a bit ""mystical"" for my tastes. Maybe this was just ""Shawshank"" Part Deux, and thus to be avoided.In deference to my Father's usually reliable taste, however, I bought him the book soon after his recommendation of the film. (This was a good strategy for postponing our own viewing of the film on rental.) After reading, Dad said he was glad he'd seen the movie first because, even though, as usual, ""the book's better!"" the film had been an especially good cinematic equivalent. If you knew the source, you would recognise this as the highest praise!So I read the book next. Again, not without trepidation: I hadn't revisited King since his ""glory days"" of Different Seasons and the rest. The Green Mile (full collected version of the original serial I'd neglected on its initial publication) turned out to be wonderful. More than a return to form: possibly King's masterpiece, actually, and certainly the work that confirms his claim to serious literary status - and, for my money, elevates him to the ranks of Dickens (to whose work The Green Mile bears at least equal comparison, if not...). Stephen King: the plain fact - when he puts his mind and pen to the business of real story-telling, there is no living author quite as effective or affecting on man's humanity (and inhumanity) to man (and beast). Frank Darabont: the film-maker who finally did King more than justice.So, finally, to the film (rented one afternoon when I was actually getting near to the end of the novel). What a revelation! Dad was right about the adaptation: the perfect screenplay of a literary masterwork. The thing that really exercised my wife and me, though, was the fact that he had watched this within weeks of my Mother's death. We were all grieving in that period; but for Dad to find value in a film that deals, at times, so uncompromisingly with mortality and the dreadful business of bereavement struck us as, well, special. You will understand when you see this film - as you must - how powerful it is on the idea of the agony of survival of the dead by the living. I know this is a bit autobiographical; but I'm mentioning it really to endorse the film's gravity. Ultimately, as with all works of art, quality is singled out by the intent behind it and the craft in its realisation. We're talking communication, in the end; and I don't mind telling you that, personal circumstances taken on board or put aside, it wouldn't take much to persuade me to put The Green Mile at the top of my list of cinema's great artworks.Every so often, a film gives you perfectly-crafted and/or performed, truly indelible moments for your mind and heart to store (Al Pacino saying ""Prego"" - ""You're welcome"" - to Apollonia, in the Godfather, for instance; or that Lady, that Tramp and that spaghetti). The Green Mile has more of these than you can count. But, just for instance, the way Michael Jeter, as fragile Delacroix, delivers the line ""Don't hurt him"" (about, yes, the mouse) to vile, cruel Percy (Doug Hutchison). Or the perfect over-the-huge-shoulder reaction shot of silently weeping Dean (Barry Pepper) following giant John Coffey towards the Chair. Or the sheer, soul-wrenching poignancy of the line and the context when Dabbs Greer, as older Tom Hanks, remarks to a friend ""Not exactly the Mouseville we had in mind..."" (has my lip quivering to recall it even now - you wait).Indeed, every element of The Green Mile is flawless: Thomas Newman's exquisite score; fantastic acting from all concerned, really an injustice to single out anyone, but David Morse and James Cromwell - what artists! Sam Rockwell is amazing, too, roguish and repellent by turns. The pacing is perfect as well; this ""long"" film just occupies our time in the most complementary, entertaining, challenging and enlightening of ways. It orchestrates leisurely character-study and striking, poignant incident to perfection.The originality of the (restrained) ""supernatural"" element and the Green Mile's manifestations of good old, bad old Human Nature - all of it is superb. The final miracle is that these perfect parts, not least Hanks' total authority in the lead/narrator role and Michael Clarke Duncan's eloquent, monumental silences, add up to an even finer whole: an engaging, moving work that tackles the burdens and joys of life in the most intelligent, imaginative way you could wish for.The Green Mile is comedy to die for and tragedy on the classical scale. It is, in its way, is as profound as Shakespeare's Primrose Path (and again, if you saw my CV, you'd recognise this as the highest praise). Watch it, please; prepare for a funny, harrowing walk along King's and Darabont's brilliant metaphor for life's varying lengths and values. And remember my Dad's praise (and concealed warning to those of us of an empathetic disposition): ""The mouse is brilliant.""To move us with a mere mouse is one of cinema's great accomplishments, I think. I hadn't quite finished the book when we first viewed it, so I had no real inkling about where old Edgecombe was going on his walks. I'm still at a loss, several viewings later, as to how this one last detail of the story rekindles such already deep poignancy. As I said, it's like poetry: Rosebud at the end of Citizen Kane has this same force. Just enjoy - and beware: I defy anyone not to be moved to tears - even after your weeping for John Coffey has subsided - by the touching endurance of Mr. Jingles.",5,A Mile's Walk All Lovers of Great

But somehow he did it again with 'The Green Mile'. Both films are near masterpieces, and it is very hard to decide which one I liked better. While Shawshank is considered a triumph in film making by most critics, fewer were as impressed by The Green Mile. If I had to choose a favorite though it would definately be this film. The entire cast was absolutely wonderful, and each of them was perfectly sited in their roles. Once again Tom Hanks delivers an oscar worthy performance and it is an unforgettable one. I particularly thought he pulled off the agony of having a severe bladder infection extremely well. I have a friend who had one so severe that he couldn't ""do his business"", so I have experience in watching someone suffer through it. All I can think is Hanks must have had one that bad before because it's so convincing. And where would one do research for such a situation anyway? Sam Rockwell however turned in the best performance. In fact in some ways his performance overshadows those of the other actors every time he's on screen. He played this psychopathic maniac 'Wild Bill' in such a raunchy and disturbing manner, he manages to get under your skin and stay there. An amazing performance. Michael Clarke Duncan's John Coffey was so sweet and tender that it made me wake up and notice this actor for the first time. The Green Mile is a rather dark and disturbing movie. So much so that I wouldn't recommend it sensitive types nor children. But I do have to say it's a truly amazing film with a gloriously magical quality to it.",5,One of those movies that is simply as entertaining as movies ever get!,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1672,"['First', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'managed', 'create', 'what', 'amounts', 'greatest', 'prison', 'film', 'ever', 'made', ""'The"", 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'somehow', 'did', 'again', ""'The"", 'Green', 'Mile', 'films', 'are', 'near', 'masterpieces', 'very', 'hard', 'decide', 'one', 'liked', 'better', 'Shawshank', 'considered', 'triumph', 'film', 'making', 'most', 'critics', 'fewer', 'were', 'impressed', 'Green', 'Mile', 'had', 'choose', 'favorite', 'would', 'definately', 'be', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'was', 'perfectly', 'sited', 'roles', 'Once', 'again', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'particularly', 'thought', 'pulled', 'off', 'agony', 'having', 'severe', 'bladder', 'infection', 'extremely', 'well', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'so', 'severe', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'business', 'have', 'experience', 'watching', 'someone', 'suffer', 'can', 'think', 'Hanks', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'bad', 'before', 'so', 'convincing', 'where', 'would', 'one', 'do', 'research', 'situation', 'anyway', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'however', 'turned', 'best', 'performance', 'fact', 'ways', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'time', 'screen', 'played', 'psychopathic', 'maniac', 'Bill', 'raunchy', 'disturbing', 'manner', 'get', 'skin', 'stay', 'there', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'John', 'Coffey', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'tender', 'made', 'wake', 'up', 'notice', 'actor', 'first', 'time', 'Green', 'Mile', 'rather', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'sensitive', 'types', 'children', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'gloriously', 'magical', 'quality']",N/A

Tom Hanks is powerful in the lead, and strong performances from Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey de Munn, and David Morse are all, individually, brilliant, and added to ensemble brilliance. Special mention must go to Doug Hutchinson's performance as the wimp. He was a nastier person than any of the guys on Death Row; that rotten little bully we've all known at one time or another, because he had ""connections"".It was, I thought, a courageous performance. Most unappreciated are the women; Bonnie Hunt is the ultimate devoted wife, and Patricia Clarkson will totally blow you away with her display of simplicity, insanity and renewal. At 3 hours, ""The Green Mile"" never fails to keep your attention. I love it.  UPDATE: I just bought the 2-disc version, and it' not that much better.

36744,A2IYUCI5A26O82,0780628799,R. Hansen,"[1, 3]","I was skeptical when I heard about this movie. I was sceptical, like I'm sure many others were, that after the achievement of `Shawshank' that the same director (Frank Darabont) was making another prison movie based on the same author as the previously mentioned work. To put it bluntly, this had the possibility of disaster via redundancy written all over it.Of course I loved it. Probably because its use of a prison is more of a vehicle for its apologue, than the dominant presence that it was in `Shawshank'. The numinous aspect of the story was also enjoyable, as it never seemed to overcome the humanistic portion of the tale. And like all non-horror King films it has a certain, well...Kingesque (for the lack of a better word) quality that pervades adaptations of his works (`Stand By Me', `Hearts in Atlantis', etc). There is a kind of quaint, yet mystical element to these film versions that always seems to transplant you into their world for the duration of the film.How you ultimately feel about this movie probably comes down to how you feel about powerful manipulation in the guise of pure evil (Percy and Wild Bill) and pure good (John Coffey). In fact Coffey is not only innocent he is a veritable saint, and inevitable martyr in a plot that is as old as...well as old as Jesus Christ. The gray areas between the polarizing forces of morality are the rest of the prison guards and other death row inmates. We learn much about one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb (Hanks), and a little about his co-workers, but what is significant is what we learn about two of the condemned. Character development and themes of repentance pervade our dealings with Arlen and Del, and tug at our sympathy, while leaving almost no knowledge of their criminal acts to use in judging them. This is probably best, because they are fictional characters, so the filmmakers can't be excused of glossing over anything heinous, and it precludes a probable mire in dichotomy, which would lengthen an already long motion picture.It is always an interesting phenomenon, in my opinion, how all the dramatics, sweeping music, appealing actors, and other blandishments of the big screen can engender affinity with characters we would normally excoriate.",5,"Not &quot;Shawshank Part II&quot;, much to my relief.",1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,2234,"['was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'sceptical', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'achievement', 'Shawshank', 'same', 'director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'was', 'making', 'prison', 'movie', 'based', 'same', 'author', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'work', 'put', 'bluntly', 'had', 'possibility', 'disaster', 'redundancy', 'written', 'it.Of', 'course', 'loved', 'Probably', 'use', 'prison', 'more', 'vehicle', 'apologue', 'dominant', 'presence', 'was', 'Shawshank', 'numinous', 'aspect', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'never', 'seemed', 'overcome', 'humanistic', 'portion', 'tale', 'non-horror', 'King', 'films', 'certain', 'well', 'Kingesque', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'quality', 'adaptations', 'works', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'etc', 'kind', 'quaint', 'yet', 'mystical', 'element', 'film', 'versions', 'always', 'transplant', 'world', 'duration', 'film.How', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'movie', 'probably', 'down', 'how', 'feel', 'powerful', 'manipulation', 'guise', 'pure', 'evil', 'Percy', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'pure', 'good', 'John', 'Coffey', 'fact', 'Coffey', 'not', 'only', 'innocent', 'veritable', 'saint', 'inevitable', 'martyr', 'plot', 'as', 'old', 'well', 'as', 'old', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'gray', 'areas', 'polarizing', 'forces', 'morality', 'are', 'rest', 'prison', 'guards', 'other', 'death', 'row', 'inmates', 'learn', 'much', 'one', 'guards', 'Paul', 'Edgecomb', 'Hanks', 'little', 'co-workers', 'what', 'significant', 'what', 'learn', 'two', 'condemned', 'Character', 'development', 'themes', 'repentance', 'pervade', 'dealings', 'Arlen', 'Del', 'tug', 'sympathy', 'leaving', 'almost', 'knowledge', 'criminal', 'acts', 'use', 'judging', 'probably', 'best', 'are', 'fictional', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'excused', 'glossing', 'anything', 'heinous', 'probable', 'mire', 'dichotomy', 'would', 'lengthen', 'already', 'long', 'motion', 'picture.It', 'always', 'interesting', 'phenomenon', 'opinion', 'how', 'dramatics', 'sweeping', 'music', 'appealing', 'actors', 'other', 'blandishments', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'engender', 'affinity', 'characters', 'would', 'normally', 'excoriate']",N/A

Most of the rest of the cast: best role ever. (The notable exception: Gary Sinise, who didn't have enough screen time to  really get his teeth into the role.) The guy who played the warden, whose  name I completely forget, has made a career-- and a great one-- out of  playing total jerks. And he does it well. This may be his first role as the  good guy, and even though I kept expecting him to grab a tommy gun and mow  down the rest of the good guys, he's just plain jaw-droppingly good as a  man who's simply at the end of his rope.But the guy who really needs  singled out here is Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan plays the huge, gentle,  mentally deficient John Coffey so perfectly that he'll go down in history  as one of those actors who plays his role so well that people walk away  from the experience wondering whether the actor himself suffers from the  same deficiencies as the character. The only role like that in the last  thirty years or so has been Larry Drake's wonderful character on L. A. Law;  before that, you have to go back to To Kill a Mockingbird. There probably  aren't many Hollywood roles around for seven-foot-tall four-hundred-pound  actors, but if there's any justice in this world, and half a brain,  collectively, in Hollywood, someone will start writing roles for this guy.Want some more superlatives? How about the makeup jobs on Michael  Jeter and Harry Dean Stanton, which are up to the standards set by the  makeup jobs on Murphy and Lawrence in _Life_? There's gonna be a steel cage  match for the make-up Oscar this year, and both The Green Mile and Life are  equally deserving. The special effects, what little were needed, are  chilling, brutal, and unglamorous; there's no glorification of death here.  The direction is fantastic; the camerawork is some of the best I've seen  all year.My problems with the film are few, and the main one is  related to the book, so most people who haven't read it probably didn't  even notice. The subplot in the book regarding the Percy-like nurse's aide  who confronts Edgecombe towards the end of book five is completely missing  from the movie. Because of this, there are a few scenes at the beginning  that trail off into nowhere. Also, the closing monologue slips pretty far  into melodrama territory, and the film would have been just as good without  it. But these are small things in comparison to the monster that is this  film. Critics have been pretty uniform in panning it; ignore them  completely. This is one of the best, if not the best, of the year. It  deserves every accolade it receives, and probably more. Filmmaking in the  nineties has only rarely been this good.

36754,A38G64S5VMRI1P,0780628799,Robert Graves,"[8, 9]","""Sometimes the green mile seems so long,"" an aged Paul Edgecomb laments at the film's end. I would have to say that this aptly describes my sentiments during some of the drawn-out stretches of this movie. However, besides it's length, The Green Mile is an otherwise extremely laudable work, displaying the best of cast and crew alike.  Though the screenplay was written and directed by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption), The Green Mile is distinctly Stephen King, the story's author. This means you can expect a sharp plot line, emotionally tumultuous scenes, and novel characters so vivid that each is a story in itself. It goes without saying then, that the screenplay was a very true adaptation of the 6-part novel by King, the most accurate of any King work.The film begins in the modern day with an old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer from Little House) accounting his past as a prison guard on the ""green mile,"" the colorful name given to death row at Coal Mountain Prison in Louisiana. Though the movie has a slow start (which didn't particularly bother me - it's well-suited for the film), we quickly find ourselves in the mid-depression south, 1935, where the main story takes place.John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gargantuan black man with a child's mind, is arrested for a crime  too deplorable to mention.  He finds himself on Cell Block-E, headed by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), awaiting electrocution by ""Old Sparky,"" the name given to the electric chair. (Yes, in a King story even inanimate objects are memorable characters.)Edgecomb quickly realizes that Coffey's nature doesn't match the heinousness of the crime he is accused of. What ensues is the relationship that develops between Edgecomb and Coffey, who seems to have an extraordinary gift - the power of healing. He starts with Edgecomb himself, healing his painful urinary tract infection, and then moves on to Mr. Jingles, the film's little mascot, a mouse that takes a liking to one of the inmates. Mice? Supernatural? Don't fret. Darabont successfully interlaces these seemingly unbelievable scenes so as to make them almost unnoticeable.What is less than subtle are the parallels between John Coffey and another famous J.C. from history, but this is typical of King's and Darabont's work together (Shawshank certainly had its spiritually metaphorical moments).There are two kinds of King movies, the sick-beyond-sick films (such as Pet Sematary), and the more dramatic, Oscar-type efforts (Stand By Me, Shawshank). Though of the latter breed, you'll still get a taste of the trademark disturbed King in the Mile - specifically in a 3-minute death scene, an execution in Old Sparky that goes nightmarishly wrong. (Not for the faint of heart.) The entire sequence is set off by the childish prison guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) who does as good a job as any antagonist ever at making us hate him. In fact, by the end of this movie you'll find yourself wishing for a fate worse than death for the little brat. (Be patient.) All-in-all the chemistry between the prison guards (Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn) is admirable as well as believable. This camaraderie culminates in their plan to sneak J.C. out of his cell for a special healing. This is the one incident I would call ""a little too much"" in terms of plot. Something more believable could've been used to accomplish the same plot purposes.  The positives are plentiful. For one, we now have a new star, Michael Clarke Duncan. He gave an emotional (though at times a little over-done) portrayal of Coffey; you'll fall in love with him from the get-go. Though there isn't a weak casting choice (hats off to Mali Finn), Duncan dominates the movie with his loveable character.The characters are as only King could conjure. Even in the few brief cameo moments we have with Gary Sinise we feel as though we have known him and his family for years. Also distinctly King? Mr. Jingles, the amiable mouse that frequents the green mile. Who else could successfully weave a mouse into an otherwise somber prison movie?Less than extraordinary are the bookmark present-day scenes, bracketing the beginning and ending of the movie. We see this in all the latest epics, don't we? Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, etc. It's overdone. Though it's far less annoying in the Mile than in Titanic, I found these flash-forwards to be even more unnecessary. They serve no discernable purpose. It could have been worse, however, since Darabont wisely wrote out a character from the modern-day segment, an orderly that was harassing the old Edgecomb (included as a typological Percy in King's original work).And finally, the one element missing that could have made this film that much more memorable would have been good music. Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Erin Brockovich) did not produce a score worthy of the cinematography. Zimmer or Horner would have been far superior options.Final word? Don't miss the Mile. It's an emotionally charged movie that may even be a little underdone (in a positive sense), something very rare in today's over-the-top flicks. But be prepared for a long sit and a few tears. The Mile hits you where it hurts, in seeing injustice done to the bearer of truth. Of course you'll also see the best side of Stephen King, and we, like Paul Edgecomb, will see that miracles can happen anywhere.",5,Hard to find a flaw,970876800,"10 7, 2000",2000,5362,"['Sometimes',

Anyone who purchases this film should watch all of the special features. The amount of work that goes into making a first class motion picture is amazing. In the special features you get to see many of the details the director had to work on to produce this outstanding film. You'll see the enthusiasm of the actors as they read their lines and how the whole thing came together with all of the special magic of film making. The Green Mile has to be one of the best films ever made and the entire ensemble of actors delivered performances of the highest quality. Steven King should write more great books like this and Director Frank Darabont has to be one of the greatest directors of all time.

36756,AM4ZQJ0IORVWG,0780628799,"Rob ""Revuman""","[1, 1]","In 1994, Stephen King and Frank Darabont teamed up to bring the movie The Shawshank Redemption to the screen; an amazingly well done film about a man (played by Tim Robbins) who is found guilty of a crime he didn't commit and  who desperatly searches for a way to escape from jail.  Not only was the  movie a great sucess, it also was a great adaptation of Kings novel and was  also supurbly directed by Darabont.Now, in 2000 (although the film was  released in '99) the two have teamed up to do it again with The Green Mile,  based on the novel of the same name, which is also by King.The Green  Mile is a touching story about hope and redemption in a place where all  things end in death.  The main story rotates around two men: Paul Edgecomb  (played by Tom Hanks; Saving Private Ryan) and John Coffey (Played by  Michael Clarke Duncan: The Whole Nine Yards).  As the story starts we find  that Paul has come down with a terrible bladder infection.  That infection  has been slowly effecting everything he does including his job as overseer  of the inmates on Death Row, or the Green Mile as it is nicknamed due to  its green-grassy colored floor.  Although he knows that everyone at the  Mile can see he is in real pain, Paul tries as hard as he can to keep the  inmates from seeing him in a weakened state...although his efforts are to  no avail.Then, one day, this tall black man named John Coffey is brought  to the row for the murder of two little girls.  (this happens in the  opening of the movie).  Aside from being as big as a bus, most of the other  men on the Mile don't see him as being any different from the other  inmates.  However, Paul does.  And when Coffey magically heals him of his  bladder infection, he truely realizes that there is more to John Coffey  than meets the eye.Having seen this movie twice already, I must say that  with a truely amazing blend of wonderful acting, amazing photography and  directing, a supurb plot and almost perfect adaptation of the book, the  green mile goes right up there on my list of movies for 1999-2000 and  should definatly been on everyone's bookshelf...especially if you are a  Stephen King fan.Also stars an extensive list of great actors including  David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, and a cameo by Gary Sinise.The  Highs: This is how a book is made into a film...everything about it, right  down to the detail of the sets, is really poweful and amazing to see.The  lows: &quot;A Three Hour Tour...&quot; need I say more.

36759,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0780628799,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 13]","The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist. Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal  involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison  cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey. Like  the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic,  `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and  romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or  particularly meaningful. Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into  the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power  of miraculous healing. Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by  definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point. The story here -  which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with  subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the  emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent  messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned  to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's  innocence.`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place,  but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys. Perhaps  the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the  fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to  be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their  just (or unjust) rewards. Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor  Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest clich&eacute; of all: an uneducated,  marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind,  though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through  which God is able to work his wonders. Except for this last fact, Coffey's  pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including  Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster. Is this  possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character,  features a mouse in a prominent role? Similarly, one doubts it is mere  coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping  and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein - albeit, in this  case, Coffey, of course, is innocent; after all, having him be guilty of  the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder  to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience. Also,  this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey  (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well. In addition to  dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite  the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with  Christ per se).Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their  villains. Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and  supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the  sweetness. This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a  guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner. The guard, Percy, is a craven,  sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and  torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all  to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of  its owner's death. The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar  two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil  for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men. By so neatly divvying  up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the  filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it  some real meaning.As to the film's rather startling and, initially  unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the  edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.`The Green  Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film. It sports a number of excellent  performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though  languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it  patiently gathers the strands of its story together. As with a good long  novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to  give it the benefit of our attention. Therefore, we regret even more that  the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap  emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality. Those of us willing to  dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve  better.",2,long superficial tale,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,4810,"['Green', 'Mile', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'death', 'row', 'prison', 'story', 'sci-fi', 'twist', 'Chances', 'are', 'viewer', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'tale', 'life', 'death', 'spiritual', 'renewal', 'involving', 'group', 'characters', 'working', 'languishing', '1930', 'prison', 'cell', 'block', 'dismiss', 'prime', 'example', 'sentimental', 'hooey', 'similar', 'similarly', 'overrated', 'Stephen', 'King-inspired', 'prison', 'epic', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'new', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'sanitary', 'romanticized', 'vision', 'prison', 'life', 'be', 'either', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'particularly', 'meaningful', 'Indeed', 'Green', 'Mile', 'step', 'further', 'realm', 'parable', 'ascribing', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'power', 'miraculous', 'healing', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'parable', 'almost', 'definition', 'supposed', 'be', 'short', 'pithy', 'point', 'story', 'here', 'presumptuous', '3', 'hours', '8', 'minutes', 'so', 'overstuffed', 'subplots', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'actually', 'weaken', 'emotional', 'effect', 'generated', 'plight', 'facing', 'John', 'Coffey', 'innocent', 'messenger', 'God', 'condemned', 'death', 'Paul', 'prison', 'guard', 'assigned', 'run', 'death', 'row', 'cell', 'block', 'who', 'learn', 'Coffey', 'innocence.', 'Green', 'Mile', 'certainly', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'world', 'too', 'evenly', 'up', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'Perhaps', 'decision', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'leading', 'role', 'Paul', 'accounts', 'fact', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'genial', 'soft-spoken', 'humanistic', 'be', 'man', 'dedicating', 'life', 'dispatching', 'convicted', 'murderers', 'just', 'unjust', 'rewards', 'Coffey', 'mountain', 'man', 'form', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'oldest', 'clich', 'eacute', 'uneducated', 'marginally', 'imbecilic', 'lug', 'guy', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'heart', 'mind', 'trapped', 'behemoth', 'body', 'provide', 'clean', 'vessel', 'God', 'able', 'work', 'wonders', 'last', 'fact', 'Coffey', 'pedigree', 'descends', 'whole', 'multitude', 'earlier', 'characters', 'including', 'Lennie', 'Mice', 'Men', 'even', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'possibly', 'why', 'Green', 'Mile', 'deference', 'former', 'character', 'mouse', 'prominent', 'role', 'Similarly', 'one', 'doubts', 'mere', 'coincidence', 'crime', 'Coffey', 'convicted', 'raping', 'murdering', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'echo', 'Frankenstein', 'albeit', 'case', 'Coffey', 'course', 'innocent', 'having', 'be', 'guilty', 'brutal', 'murders', 'would', 'muddy', 'up', 'moral', 'waters', 'make', 'lot', 'harder', 'elicit', 'tears', 'sentimental', 'happily', 'rheumy-eyed', 'audience', 'Also', 'authors', 'pound', 'home', 'Christ', 'figure', 'qualities', 'Coffey', 'John', 'Coffey', 'JC', 'get', 'unsubtle', 'fare-thee-well', 'addition', 'dying', 'innocently', 'sins', 'Coffey', 'heal', 'sick', 'smite', 'evildoers', 'latter', 'more', 'keeping', 'Jehovah', 'perhaps', 'Christ', 'se', 'are', 'filmmakers', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'villains', 'Amidst', 'amazing', 'good', 'will', 'condemned', 'killers', 'supportive', 'prison', 'guards', 'be', 'vinegar', 'cut', 'sweetness', 'form', 'too', 'neatly', 'balanced', 'duo', 'one', 'guard', 'other', 'far-from-model', 'prisoner', 'guard', 'Percy', 'craven', 'sadistic', 'coward', 'who', 'antagonizing', 'prisoners', 'taunting', 'torturing', 'men', 'moment', 'execution', 'most', 'monstrously', 'animal', 'lovers', 'audience', 'squashing', 'pet', 'mouse', 'eve', 'owner', 'death', 'evil', 'prisoner', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'similar', 'two-dimensional', 'quality', 'wickedness', 'serving', 'too-obvious', 'foil', 'other', 'pure-as-the-driven-snow', 'condemned', 'men', 'so', 'neatly', 'divvying', 'up', 'characters', 'clearly', 'delineated', 'categories', 'good', 'evil', 'filmmakers', 'rob', 'film', 'moral', 'complexity', 'might', 'have', 'lent', 'real', 'meaning.As', 'film', 'rather', 'startling', 'initially', 'unexpected', 'flights', 'fantasy', 'serve', 'mostly', 'further', 'soften', 'edge', 'already', 'overly', 'idealistic', 'mawkish', 'story.', 'Green', 'Mile', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'sports', 'number', 'excellent', 'performances', 'moments', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'power', 'though', 'languorous', 'times', 'pacing', 'admirably', 'hurtle', 'ahead', 'strands', 'story', 'together', 'good', 'long', 'novel', 'one', 'sense', 'patience', 'goodwill', 'want', 'give', 'benefit', 'attention', 'Therefore', 'regret', 'even', 'more', 'makers', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'settle', 'easy', 'path', 'cheap', 'emotionalism', 'simpleminded', 'sentimentality', 'willing', 'dedicate', 'more', 'three', 'precious', 'hours', 'particular', 'cause', 'deserve', 'better']",N/A

The Green Mile, again an adaptaton of a Stephen King story, does not disappoint when it comes to  evoking this world.  But, unlike the far superior Shawshank Redemption,  this movie has, for me, an alienating dose of the supernatural, like Carrie  in prison.  The human scenes and characters, Tom Hanks chief among them,  are so compelling without this extra layer, I cannot help but feel that  this movie would have been even more powerful without resorting to the  special effect moments of strangeness.  It is also bloated in its running  time, as if the story was so important that it required three hours to  tell; the narrative simply doesn't warrant it. However, these flaws  notwithstanding, Michael Duncan is riveting; Bonnie Hunt again delivers a  subtle, warm performance as Hanks' wife; the villianous types are villians  extraordinaire, and the movie is completely enjoyable on its own terms.

In  this movie Frank Darabont and his team showcased their professionalism in  every facet of the art of movie-making as well as the ability to keep  viewers enjoying, interested, curious and sitting still in front of the  screen for literally more than 03 hours (  you won' t get bored, I confirm  ).Tom Hanks, once again, at his best; Michael Clark Duncan with his  amazingly convincing character John Coffey, the Miracle; great cameo role  as Coffey's defendant attorney by Gary Sinise; Hutchison and others did  their good jobs too. Still haven' t been able to figure out why the Academy  overlooked, once again, monsieur Darabont's direction for the  GOD-ONLY-KNOWS-WHY second time.

Based on a 6-part series of novellas by Stephen King and directed and written by King alumnus Frank Darabont, The Green Mile is the story of Paul Edgecomb, head guard at the Death Row section of Cold Mountain Penitentiary and a man who doesn't believe in miracles until the day he meets John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same""), a hulking giant of a man who is sentenced to Death Row for the murder of the Detterick sisters.  To his surprise, Edgecomb discovers that Coffey is not your average Death Row prisoner.  Not only is Coffey a quiet, shy, and gentle man, but he has a power in him that brings not only the guards, but also his fellow inmates, together, and also makes Edgecomb wonder if Coffey's truly a killer after all.This Oscar-nominated film has some truly fine acting in it as well.  Tom Hanks as Edgecomb was nothing short of brilliant because he made me see the character as King envisioned him in the book--a troubled man who has to deal with death every day on a professional level, and who has begun to have doubts about the job he is doing.  When he finally realizes just how special Coffey truly is, it only serves to reinforce those doubts.I also have to give a nod to Michael Clarke Duncan as the enigmatic Coffey.  In what I consider to be one of his finest performances ever, Duncan made this character so real to me that I found myself in tears as he was delivered to his ultimate destiny.  Duncan has had many good roles in films such as Armageddon and Planet of the Apes, but this is his best role to date.The Green Mile had a very good supporting cast as well.  David Morse was excellent as Brutal Howell, as was Barry Pepper in the role of Dean.  I loved Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, the prisoner who develops a relationship with ""Mr. Jingles"", a mouse that has been wandering about Death Row and amusing both guards and prisoners alike.  Doug Hutchison's sniveling, arrogant Percy Wetmore was just great, and Sam Rockwell impressed me as Wild Bill Wharton, a prisoner who holds the secret of what really happened to the Detterick girls.  James Cromwell turned in a wonderful performance as Warden Moores, a man beset by his own domestic troubles who also has the opportunity to find out the secret of Coffey's power, and Dabbs Greer as old Paul Edgecomb was very good.All in all, The Green Mile was the finest film I've ever seen.  I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that there were so few extras on it (one documentary, a trailer, and a cast and crew list that covered only the first 4 actors, plus Frank Darabont and Stephen King), but I still gave this one high marks because it's Frank Darabont's best film to date.

36781,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,0780628799,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 1]","Possibly the best Stephen King movie (although the appallingly underappreciated ""The Mangler"" might give it a run for its money, but that's in a completely different vein) and one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, including the performances of their lives by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan in the leads plus outstanding support roles from such talents as James Cromwell (the farmer from ""Babe"" and ""Babe: Pig In The City""), Gary Sinise (from ""Mission To Mars"" and ""Forrest Gump"") and Graham Greene (from ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Grey Owl"") to name but a few.  The cast has some powerful roles to step into, because of all the King material I've seen or read (I admit I haven't read the original ""Green Mile"" book but have read most of his other novels and short stories plus seen most of the movies) this has one of the two greatest repertoires of characters: interesting, delved into indepth, most of them immensely likable and even the detestable ones highly interesting and fully-realized.  The only King work that compares in terms of such a multitude of A-list characters is the novel ""Black House"", co-written with Peter Straub (of course Black House's predecessor ""The Talisman"" contains arguably the greatest individual character (co-)created by King: Wolf.  Believe it or not though, Duncan's Coffey character here actually mounts a feasible challenge for that distinction).Set in a prison, a deathrow at that, in - I believe it was the 1930s; somewheres thereabouts - ""Green Mile"" takes a different course from most prison-oriented movies by focusing not on brutality but on hope and redemption.  That no doubt sounds clich&eacute;, but it's never been more true than it is here, with some of the greatest depictions of compassion, regret and remorse, and the existance of redeeming values in outwardly mean souls.  Of course, there are also examples of some of the scummier examples of the human race here, and as is the case in a number of excellent stories, it's the mix and contrast of the 'bright' and 'dark' elements that give the movie so much of its potency.Hanks plays the warden of a prison wing (the deathrow wing) set to receive convicted child-killer Coffey, a hulking giant who (thanks to great special effects) must be at least seven feet tall, and who because of his gentle, childlike nature immediately leads Hanks to question whether he could really be responsible for the crimes he was convicted of.  Hanks surprises with his role - the parts calling for the likable, intelligent, gregarious supervisor, it's a no-brainer that he could pull it off; but where circumstances call for the character to come off hard-as-nails tough and dangerous, I would not have known he could pull it off so utterly perfectly.  ""Green Mile"" really shows parts of his range that he'd never had a chance to show before.  And Michael Clarke Duncan's performance is something that I'm not even going to attempt to describe except to say that it's a high mark in movie history.If you're a Stephen King fan and have been putting off getting this one just because it's not horror I urge you not to deprive yourself: this is one of his best works regardless of genre.  Or if you're a drama fan and aren't sure if a horror writer will be adept at pulling off this type of material don't worry about that either - that King created this very different tale in addition to such excellent horror as ""Carrie"" and ""The Jaunt"" (a particularly terrifying tale in the ""Skeleton Crew"" anthology) shows his versatility as a writer just like the change of pace for Hanks and several other performers known for different types of roles shows theirs.",5,Superior Magic Drama,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,3654,"['Possibly', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'appallingly', 'underappreciated', 'Mangler', 'might', 'give', 'run', 'money', 'completely', 'different', 'vein', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'ever', 'assembled', 'including', 'performances', 'lives', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'leads', 'outstanding', 'support', 'roles', 'such', 'talents', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'farmer', 'Babe', 'Babe', 'Pig', 'City', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Mission', 'Mars', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Grey', 'Owl', 'name', 'few', 'cast', 'powerful', 'roles', 'step', 'King', 'material', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'read', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'Green', 'Mile', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'most', 'other', 'novels', 'short', 'stories', 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'one', 'two', 'greatest', 'repertoires', 'characters', 'interesting', 'delved', 'indepth', 'most', 'immensely', 'likable', 'even', 'detestable', 'ones', 'highly', 'interesting', 'fully-realized', 'only', 'King', 'work', 'terms', 'multitude', 'A-list', 'characters', 'novel', 'Black', 'House', 'co-written', 'Peter', 'Straub', 'course', 'Black', 'House', 'predecessor', 'Talisman', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'individual', 'character', 'co-', 'created', 'King', 'Wolf', 'Believe', 'not', 'Duncan', 'Coffey', 'character', 'here', 'actually', 'feasible', 'challenge', 'distinction', '.Set', 'prison', 'deathrow', 'believe', 'was', '1930s', 'somewheres', 'Green', 'Mile', 'different', 'course', 'most', 'prison-oriented', 'movies', 'focusing', 'not', 'brutality', 'hope', 'redemption', 'doubt', 'clich', 'eacute', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'true', 'here', 'greatest', 'depictions', 'compassion', 'regret', 'remorse', 'existance', 'redeeming', 'values', 'outwardly', 'mean', 'souls', 'course', 'are', 'also', 'examples', 'scummier', 'examples', 'human', 'race', 'here', 'as', 'case', 'number', 'excellent', 'stories', 'mix', 'contrast', ""'bright"", ""'dark"", 'elements', 'give', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'potency.Hanks', 'warden', 'prison', 'wing', 'deathrow', 'wing', 'set', 'receive', 'convicted', 'child-killer', 'Coffey', 'hulking', 'giant', 'who', 'thanks', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'must', 'be', 'least', 'seven', 'feet', 'tall', 'who', 'gentle', 'childlike', 'nature', 'immediately', 'Hanks', 'question', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'responsible', 'crimes', 'was', 'convicted', 'Hanks', 'role', 'parts', 'calling', 'likable', 'intelligent', 'gregarious', 'supervisor', 'no-brainer', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'where', 'circumstances', 'call', 'character', 'come', 'off', 'hard-as-nails', 'tough', 'dangerous', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'so', 'utterly', 'perfectly', 'Green', 'Mile', 'really', 'parts', 'range', ""'d"", 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'show', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'performance', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'attempt', 'describe', 'say', 'high', 'mark', 'movie', 'history.If', ""'re"", 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'getting', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'horror', 'urge', 'not', 'deprive', 'one', 'best', 'regardless', 'genre', ""'re"", 'drama', 'fan', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'horror', 'writer', 'will', 'be', 'adept', 'pulling', 'off', 'type', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'King', 'created', 'very', 'different', 'tale', 'addition', 'such', 'excellent', 'horror', 'Carrie', 'Jaunt', 'particularly', 'terrifying', 'tale', 'Skeleton', 'Crew', 'anthology', 'versatility', 'writer', 'just', 'change', 'pace', 'Hanks', 'several', 'other', 'performers', 'known', 'different', 'types', 'roles', 'shows', 'theirs']",N/A

36784,A27A3AZA7L12N6,0780628799,Stephen M. Bauer,"[2, 2]","The story is about a black man, John Coffey, who is accused of kidnapping and savagely murdering two little white girls.  He is promptly convicted and sentenced to death.  Most of the story is about his time on death row, known in the prison system as, `The green mile.""  Judging by his dress at the time of his arrest, John Coffey appears to have been an agricultural worker, a farm hand.  He is exceedingly large and, seemingly, simple-minded.John Coffey  was a Christ figure.  He was sent to Earth on a mission.  He was an innocent who was put to death.  His death was not a tragedy.  It was part of the divinely ordained plan.  God does not permit miracles for the sake of healing people but so that people will believe.  John Coffey's mission was to make the prison guards believe.The Cajun inmate and the white-trash wild man, also on death row, represented the two thieves crucified on either side of Christ.  The Cajun, of course, represented the good thief.  Taking the symbolism further, the prison guards represented the Roman centurians who guarded the condemned  and carried out the crucifixions.  In the Gospel, at the death of Christ, one of the Centurians was quoted as say, ""Surely this man was God.""When the warden's wife takes her Saint Christopher medal from her neck and puts it around John Coffey's, it strikes me as some a pre-death ritual, like the story of Veronica's vale.  St. Christopher is the patron saint of travelers-as if the medal was intended to give John Coffey safe travel to the next world.When an execution takes place, chairs are setup for spectators-press and the family of the victims.  When John Coffey is being strapped into the electric chair, a man and a woman in the spectator gallery demand his death and urge it onward.  Other heads nod.  This is reminiscent of when Christ was brought before the crowd by Pontious Pilate, and people in the crowd started shouting, ""Crucify Him!  Crucify Him!""Even the way the story is told has scriptural parallels.  The story is told by Tom Hank's character to someone else when he is an very elderly and inform and living in an old-age home.  John the Evangelist was in his old-age and living in exile on the island of Patmos when he dictated the Gospel of Christ to a disciple, who wrote it down.Percy, the bad prison guard, is obviously the devil.  Any spiritually minded person watching the movie can practically see his wings flapping.  By the time the electrocution of John Coffey is complete,  Percy is dead too.  With the death and resurrection of Christ,  Satan has been defeated forever.I've just kind-of dashed this review off, but I'm sure there's a lot of other similar analogies.The mouse...well what can you say about the mouse...",4,Magnificent Stephen King Tale with Pristine CInematography,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,2729,"['story', 'black', 'man', 'John', 'Coffey', 'who', 'accused', 'kidnapping', 'savagely', 'murdering', 'two', 'little', 'white', 'girls', 'promptly', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Most', 'story', 'time', 'death', 'row', 'known', 'prison', 'system', 'green', 'mile', 'Judging', 'dress', 'time', 'arrest', 'John', 'Coffey', 'have', 'been', 'agricultural', 'worker', 'farm', 'hand', 'exceedingly', 'large', 'seemingly', 'simple-minded.John', 'Coffey', 'was', 'Christ', 'figure', 'was', 'sent', 'Earth', 'mission', 'was', 'innocent', 'who', 'was', 'put', 'death', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'tragedy', 'was', 'part', 'divinely', 'ordained', 'plan', 'God', 'not', 'permit', 'miracles', 'sake', 'healing', 'people', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'believe', 'John', 'Coffey', 'mission', 'was', 'make', 'prison', 'guards', 'believe.The', 'Cajun', 'inmate', 'white-trash', 'wild', 'man', 'also', 'death', 'row', 'represented', 'two', 'thieves', 'crucified', 'side', 'Christ', 'Cajun', 'course', 'represented', 'good', 'thief', 'Taking', 'symbolism', 'further', 'prison', 'guards', 'represented', 'Roman', 'centurians', 'who', 'guarded', 'condemned', 'carried', 'crucifixions', 'Gospel', 'death', 'Christ', 'one', 'Centurians', 'was', 'quoted', 'say', 'Surely', 'man', 'was', 'God', 'When', 'warden', 'wife', 'Saint', 'Christopher', 'medal', 'neck', 'John', 'Coffey', 'pre-death', 'ritual', 'story', 'Veronica', 'vale', 'St.', 'Christopher', 'patron', 'saint', 'travelers-as', 'medal', 'was', 'intended', 'give', 'John', 'Coffey', 'safe', 'travel', 'next', 'world.When', 'execution', 'place', 'chairs', 'are', 'setup', 'spectators-press', 'family', 'victims', 'When', 'John', 'Coffey', 'being', 'strapped', 'electric', 'chair', 'man', 'woman', 'spectator', 'gallery', 'demand', 'death', 'urge', 'onward', 'Other', 'heads', 'nod', 'reminiscent', 'when', 'Christ', 'was', 'brought', 'crowd', 'Pontious', 'Pilate', 'people', 'crowd', 'started', 'shouting', 'Crucify', 'Him', 'Crucify', 'Him', 'Even', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'scriptural', 'parallels', 'story', 'told', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'character', 'someone', 'else', 'when', 'very', 'elderly', 'inform', 'living', 'old-age', 'home', 'John', 'Evangelist', 'was', 'old-age', 'living', 'exile', 'island', 'Patmos', 'when', 'dictated', 'Gospel', 'Christ', 'disciple', 'who', 'wrote', 'bad', 'prison', 'guard', 'obviously', 'devil', 'Any', 'spiritually', 'minded', 'person', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'practically', 'see', 'wings', 'flapping', 'time', 'electrocution', 'John', 'Coffey', 'complete', 'Percy', 'dead', 'too', 'death', 'resurrection', 'Christ', 'Satan', 'been', 'defeated', 'forever.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'kind-of', 'dashed', 'review', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'other', 'similar', 'analogies.The', 'mouse', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'mouse']",N/A

Yet this review is only about the quality of the blu ray transfer and not my opinions about the story, plot lines or acting critiques.I do have the standard def version and bought the Blu Ray.The video transfer is excellent and a definite upgrade from standard def, which wasn't bad by itself.  On the blu ray format, the video brings beautiful colorations free of grain, aliasing or artifacts of any kind.  Once placed in your player, the Blu Ray version goes directly to the film without first going to the menu.  The menu itself provides a play, scene selection and special extras.  In this case, the video transfer is the star of the disc and totally deserves the 5 stars I gave it.The audio automatically defaults to the Dolby Digital  True HD 5.1 and there are no other choices, but that is ok with me.  There are a great many alternate languages that you can change it to if desired.  The audio itself is not bad but not the greatest either.  Since most of the movie is dialogue, it is the front stage where the majority of your audio is steered but there is some good use of the left and right front channels for discreet audio but very little will be present in the rears.  Early in the movie, Tom Hanks is talking very quietly, in almost a whisper and I found it hard to hear and had to bring  up the volume for that scene.  It appeared to me that a better audio remastering could have been done.  There is almost no audio information steered to the LFE channel; in fact, I noticed that the sub went to sleep after receiving no audio signals for some time, not even during the thunderstorm scene did the sub receive the low bottom end it wanted to reproduce.  I do have a very high end audio system that would be esoteric to most.  I give the audio 3 stars at best.The extras on this disc are both plentiful and wonderful with screen tests, make up tests of Hanks as an old man, a couple of deleted scenes and lengthy documentaries about Stephen King's writing dated as 2006, his movies and a bunch of other extras that I simply haven't gotten to yet.Thankfully, there are no previews of other movies which I hate for taking up room on the DVDs.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,"The Green Mile on Blu Ray, no book.",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2621,"['Green', 'Mile', 'completely', 'affecting', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'simply', 'emotionally', 'review', 'only', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'not', 'opinions', 'story', 'plot', 'lines', 'acting', 'critiques.I', 'do', 'have', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'bought', 'Blu', 'Ray.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'definite', 'upgrade', 'standard', 'def', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'blu', 'ray', 'format', 'video', 'beautiful', 'colorations', 'free', 'grain', 'aliasing', 'artifacts', 'kind', 'Once', 'placed', 'player', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'directly', 'film', 'first', 'going', 'menu', 'menu', 'play', 'scene', 'selection', 'special', 'extras', 'case', 'video', 'transfer', 'star', 'disc', 'totally', '5', 'stars', 'gave', 'it.The', 'audio', 'automatically', 'defaults', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'are', 'other', 'choices', 'ok', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'alternate', 'languages', 'can', 'change', 'desired', 'audio', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'greatest', 'either', 'most', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'front', 'stage', 'where', 'majority', 'audio', 'steered', 'good', 'use', 'left', 'right', 'front', 'channels', 'discreet', 'audio', 'very', 'little', 'will', 'be', 'present', 'rears', 'Early', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'talking', 'very', 'quietly', 'almost', 'whisper', 'found', 'hard', 'hear', 'had', 'bring', 'up', 'volume', 'scene', 'appeared', 'better', 'audio', 'remastering', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'almost', 'audio', 'information', 'steered', 'LFE', 'channel', 'fact', 'noticed', 'sub', 'went', 'sleep', 'receiving', 'audio', 'signals', 'time', 'not', 'even', 'thunderstorm', 'scene', 'did', 'sub', 'receive', 'low', 'bottom', 'end', 'wanted', 'reproduce', 'do', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'end', 'audio', 'system', 'would', 'be', 'esoteric', 'most', 'give', 'audio', '3', 'stars', 'best.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'plentiful', 'wonderful', 'screen', 'tests', 'make', 'up', 'tests', 'Hanks', 'old', 'man', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'lengthy', 'documentaries', 'Stephen', 'King', 'writing', 'dated', '2006', 'movies', 'bunch', 'other', 'extras', 'simply', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet.Thankfully', 'are', 'previews', 'other', 'movies', 'hate', 'taking', 'up', 'room', 'DVDs.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

He takes his time with the story and the development of the characters. Don't expect fast cuts and short scenes; each film is a work of art that is meant to be savored.Before I talk about the film, I have to mention a funny story. Stephen King decided to write the book in a series of six installments. King was inspired by Charles Dickens, who also liked the serial novel format. I found the first installment in a supermarket and kept the receipt. It listed the item as ""Two Dead Girls"" for 99 cents. It's amazing what you can buy in supermarkets these days.The Green Mile is set in a Louisiana prison, but, unlike The Shawshank Redemption, the inmates can only interact by talking and never leave their cells to mingle. Each prisoner is condemned to death and is awaiting a meeting with Old Sparky, the electric chair.The story is narrated by Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer and Tom Hanks), the head warder, and the vast majority of the story is told through the use of flashback and is set in 1935. He explains how he met a huge black prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan). Coffey is a simple man and seemingly gentle despite his size, but he was found guilty of murdering two little girls. His behavior doesn't do anything to suggest that he was capable of such an act.Coffey has a secret, but I can't reveal it here without ruining the movie. His nature becomes apparent about an hour into the film and it changes everything.The story revolves around Edgecomb's role in running the prison and how he reacts when he finds out Coffey's true nature. Prison life is fairly quiet, but Edgecomb has to deal with an annoying warder called Percy Wetmore. We are told that Wetmore has connections and so the other warders have to tolerate him or risk losing their jobs. Another thing that upsets Edgecomb's routine is the addition of a new prisoner, 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell), who likes to make as much trouble as possible.One part of the story concerns the appearance of a mouse. The reaction of the individual warders reveals something about their own nature and it's a brilliant plot device. Unfortunately, I can't say anything more about the mouse without ruining the story.The Green Mile isn't what it seems. It begins like a hard-hitting drama, but things change as we discover more about the characters. In the end, the story is about trust and belief. It's very powerful and some of the characters do extraordinary things. The warders, with the exception of Percy, are a close-knit group. They demonstrate the kind of trust that can only occur between close friends. The stakes are high and the story is compelling.I'll say no more about the plot other than that the conclusion is very satisfying.Darabont draws strong performances from every member of the cast. Hanks is superb as usual, but the story wouldn't work without Michael Clarke Duncan's performance and his Oscar nomination was well deserved. I could mention at least 15 actors who played their role to perfection. Darabont was nominated for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay and the film deserved all of the recognition it received. The mouse should have won an Oscar.The film has a couple of disturbing scenes, such as one of the executions, but is generally a series of character studies. You'll be sucked into the story because of what the characters do, rather than for any special effects or shocking scenes. The story has a lot of heart and will stay with you long after the credits roll. At 189-minutes, many will be wary of watching the film. Don't let that put you off. Good films never feel too long, and this is a very good film.Video Quality 4/5The VC-1 transfer looks very good for the most part. Detail in close-ups is exceptional and, apart from a few soft scenes, detail is generally strong throughout. Black levels are problematic on occasion. Darabont uses plenty of dark shots using blacks, grays and browns. Sometimes, shadows obscure some of the detail. I'm very happy with the upgrade, but it could have been slightly better. Owners of the DVD will be relieved that the Blu-ray comfortably contains the entire film, so you won't have to flip the disc over as you did with the DVD.Audio Quality 4/5The English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1 mix is quiet and I found myself increasing the volume by 10 decibels over my normal level. Once that adjustment was made, everything sounded clear. It's a dialogue-driven film, but the surrounds do play a part when required. Listen to the sound of the mouse running across the floor and you'll hear the fine detail in the mix. One electrocution is particularly noisy and you'll feel like it's happening right in front of you. I couldn't detect any imperfections in the track at all.Special Features 5/5The extras all appear in standard definition:Commentary by Director Frank DarabontWalking the Mile: The Making of The Green Mile (25:30)Miracles and Mystery: Creating The Green Mile (1:42:54) - If the commentary and ""Making Of"" features weren't enough, here's an in-depth look at every aspect of making the film.

It's a stunning achievement and the story never feels boring despite the long running time. I give it a spin every three months or so and am always glad to visit that world once again. Anyone who enjoys good acting, master storytelling and emotional drama would probably find a lot to like in this film.Overall score 5/5",5,Another masterful Stephen King adaptation from Frank

36791,A1JJOV69MAU2J2,0780628799,Steven Dennis,"[3, 5]","For starters, it's obvious that people either loved or hated this movie. And it's not hard to see why. You either buy into its sentimentality and the magic, or you don't. If you don't buy into it, you are going to hate this movie because it keeps serving you large servings of it for more than three hours. If you do buy into it, you are in for an emotionally draining and disturbing experience. I'm still digesting it, frankly, and I can't quite say yet if I'm happy that I saw it.Is it well acted? Yes, but remember the emphasis is on sentiment. If you don't buy sentimentality, you won't like the acting.How about the story? Like most Stephen King, there are several twists and turns and a couple of miracles along the way. It also has an incredibly disturbing execution scene that I fear did damage to my synapses permanently. I don't need that from my &quot;entertainment.&quot; This is not a movie for the faint of heart. However, in some ways it is, because people who are not yet supercynical -- the bleeding hearts out there -- are most likely to get caught up in the film.Another frequent complaint is the length. I'm of two minds about that too. In general I like longer movies. You become more enveloped in the characters, more immersed in the world, but this is still a heck of a long movie when, frankly, not all that much actually happens. I think the director could have easily sliced 20-30 minutes without sacrificing any of the story.As far as the ending, I'm not going to give it away like some others here do (you are forewarned), but it is more complex than the previous work by the Frank Darabont/Stephen King crew, The Shawshank Redemption. It is a proper ending to the movie, but anybody taking away simple emotions from this movie didn't quite get it, in my view. Shawshank, by the way, I wholeheartedly endorse, as a superior movie. Shawshank is one of the best movies I've ever seen, that leaves you emotionally drained and completely satisfied.

At first, I thought this film would be a flop. But, thanks to word of  mouth, the film grossed $136 Million domestically. I personally think it  should have done better than that. This, along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, is  Tom Hanks'  best performance. The visual effects, although there aren't  many, are dazzling. The relationships between the the actors is at times  sad, and at times funny. The mix of comedy, drama, fantasy, and mouse  hunting make it a film that certainly deserves to be on every movie fan's  top ten list of all time best movies.

Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing. Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a vignette in a prison film such as Darabont's vastly superior 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow.

It is undeniably a well-made film but one that is ultimately undone by a crucial deviation from the source material.Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison guard in charge of overseeing inmates imprisoned on death row.  One day a new prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives after being found guilty of killing two young girls.  Edgecomb wonders whether the imposing man really is guilty of the crime as he seems to be a harmless and gentle individual.  After Coffey displays a strange healing power, it becomes apparent that there is something wondrous about the man.Despite its technical excellence, ""The Green Mile"" has little in it to make it memorable.  The film flounders primarily because of the decision to replace the sobering ending in Stephen King's original work with an empty and inconsequential Hollywood finale.  In the novel, Edgecomb's character is subject to a traumatic experience that makes him question his actions in the prison.  The filmmakers completely abandoned this ending in order to produce a more generic product for the general public.  The story loses much of its weight because of this lack of soul-searching on Edgecomb's part.  The performances themselves are excellent although Hanks may have been a little too young for his character.  Duncan, Doug Hutchison, David Morse, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper, Harry Dean Stanton, Bonnie Hunt, William Sadler, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson are all great but the film is still underwhelming despite their best efforts.",2,"""What happens on the mile stays on the mile.

36804,AMIOLJHCQHGBE,0780628799,"T. A. Wauldron ""iamtoddicus""","[0, 0]","The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel to date. Hollywood allowed this film to develope the various characters unlike most King adaptations.. There is a smoothness of this film, and a sadness as it nears its inevitable end, which holds the attention and completely disregards the 3+ hour length. Any who have seen it, will always remember it. Myself, I try to see the uplifting side, the hope the final monologue touts, but every time I watch this film, I feel the horrible sadness created by people wronging others with malice and hate. Something that does not belong in this world, but something this movie embraces.Michael Duncan Clark, as John Coffee, is the spritual heart of this film. It made his career. He plays the wrongfully convicted man who supposedly murdered two small girls. But he never defends himself, being too simple and too PURE. As the film unfolds, he is found to Tom Hanks and others to be a creature of God. He is able to see into peoples' hearts, and know their wrongs. Being simple, he is unable to block the pain and suffering people have brought him. He is only able to absorb the pain (physically) and while on the Mile, send the pain (physically) to the evil who spend time there.In my mind, this is the role Tom Hanks will hold as the pinnacle of his career. He plays the walk boss on a Texas 1920's death row, which is known as the Green Mile. His character has steadfastly executed inmates with no remorse, until John Coffee. Not only does Coffee cure Hanks bladder and prostate problem, Hanks is witness to Coffee curing a brain tumor from the wife of the warden. It is then that Hanks understands his charge is more than just something special. He is redemption.The theme of Coffee's gift is shown as he revives life into Mr. Jingle's, a mouse living on The Mile. The mouse becomes the final comfort to a mild mannered killer played by Michael Jeter in one of his final roles (his last role was in Open Range).Anyone reading this, has already seen the film. I am not touting the film so much as sharing the what viewers already know.I compare this film to Pay It Forward in its ability to make the viewer feel.

Yes there is a bit of supernatural tinge to this movie but it in no way whatsoever takes away from its power.  At a run time of 188 minutes yes this movie is long.  The movie takes its time to fully flesh out the people and places so much the experience becomes part of your being.  When the movie begins it seems so painfully slow.  This old dude seemingly now in his doltage who we later learn in youth was a prison guard walks out of what seems to be an old time 30's era pretty mundane incredibly unremarkable black and white dance \ musical movie shown in an old age home in tears.Little did we know that we would be joining him in that crying spell near the end of the movie on learning the seqnifience of that particular old movie and why the old guard walked out in tears.  Once the story starts being told the pacing and action picks up quickly weaving slowly the entire sick somber tapastry of prison daily life on death row \ the green mile.  We soon get to know each of the guards and the more over the top prisoners.  The movie builds the characters including some the prisoners so completely you feel as if you know them.I can not see anyone watching this movie without being changed for the better by the experience of its like.  I can honestly say I will never again be the person I was before watching this movie.  This movie made me look inside myself and see that despite my being a generally good law biding person I still have so much room for improvement.  This movie touched my very soul and spoke more directly to my joy, pain and life experience than any other experience I have known.With first rate movies like the Green Mile I seldom give away too much about the plot because, I want to do nothing to steal their power and impact for those who purchase them.

Weather it's all part of the grand design or just abnormalities of nature, I'll never know, none of us will. This theme is explored in the novel and film, The Green Mile. How Stephen King came up with such a poignant and heartfelt tale is beyond me, maybe it was divine intervention, but the story of the Green Mile is a unique and moving film, the likes of which I've never seen before. The story centers around a man who is sent to death row, and once there he is able to doing seemingly impossible things. The performances in this film were Oscar worthy, building on the success of their last collaboration, The Shawshank Redemption, King and Durabont, got the biggest star in Hollywood to star in this film. The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages. The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect. As an avid Stephen King fan, I know his attention to detail has often times been his downfall and to be honest, this film is about an hour longer than it needed to be. The story, in particular the ending were so powerful, that a lot of the in between could have been left on the cutting room floor. That aside, this is a long, but fantastic film with some of the best writing and performances you could find. Like many classic films the critics love, it's a bit long, parts of it are somewhat boring, and the storyline isn't for everybody, there are plenty of people who just won't get it.

Those with a short attention span will likely find the movie too long and boring at points, but others will probably enjoy the leisurely and detailed plot and character development.The movie takes place on a death row in Louisiana in the mid 1930s. John Coffey (Jesus Christ, both JC) is a gentle giant, wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit. The guards learn that Coffey possesses unusual powers and eventually have him assist in saving the life of the warden&#65533;s terminally ill wife. Ultimately, he gives his life as a sacrifice for all of the evil in the world. Tom Hanks&#65533; character is a modern Cartaphilus (the Roman guard condemned to walk the face of the earth until Judgment Day) who is forced to bear witness of those events forever. Lots of visuals reinforce this storyline, such as the movie projector behind Coffey creating a halo-like effect.The story does slip a bit at the end, when Coffey punishes the evil Wild Bill character and the sociopathic guard Percy. This &#65533;Thou shall not get away with it&#65533; climax runs contrary to the overall story line, and seems to have been done to assure audiences that the true child murder would get his just punishment (despite the fact that he was already on death row). Another contradiction is that while the movie has a latent anti-death row message to it, the script is not above having the bad guy killed by violence.Overall, the cast is superb, and the storyline is extremely well written. Hanks, Duncan, and all of the death row guards&#65533; characters are of particular note.

I will, however, say that in my opinion it's the best film adaptation based on a work by Stephen King that's been done so far.  I hope it won't be the last.  What I want to briefly discuss is the new 2-disc edition that just came out.  If you're a fan of The Green Mile, then you'll want to buy it.  This new edition includes the old documentary: Walking The Green Mile, but it's a longer version than the one on the previous DVD.  It also has a new 6-featurette documentary on the making of The Green Mile that will pretty much tell you everything that you want to know.  The special features total around ninety minutes in length.  There's also a commentary by Frank Darabont with the film.  All the new material is excellent with up-to-date interviews that includes most of the cast and crew.  What surprised me, however, is that there isn't an up-to-date interview with Stephen King about the film.  In fact, the feeling that I got from the interviews with other novelists and screenplay writers (Peter Straub, William Goldman, David Schow, Lawrence Kasdan, and Frank Darabont) is that Mr. King is now dead.  That's exactly what it sounded like.  Of course, Stephen King is still alive.  At least according to his website.  Still, why King didn't participate with a more current interview is a valid question.  He is interviewed in the featurette, but it's from when the movie was being made and King's birthday was celebrated by strapping him down in Old Sparky.  I could be wrong, but he's wearing the exact same red T-shirt throughout all the documentaries, including Walking the Green Mile.  I will say that this is one of the few times when the upgrade to new ""extras"" on a DVD is well worth the spending of additional money.

36842,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0780628799,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 5]","The most important question is simple and straight forward; is this two disc edition of ""The Green Mile"" worth the upgrade? Yes. The three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director. While the previous edition released in 1999 looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition. I suspect the same transfer was probably used and just that the increased space to spread the film over two discs probably helped improve (along with improvements in digital technology)the look of the film.We get a terrific and informative Commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. Unfortuantely only two deleted scenes have survived as Darabont points out in the commentary in discussion about a scene (and the possibility of creating a ""Director's Cut"")most films have their dalies transferred to hard drive for assemlbing a rough cut and many of the deleted scenes were erased. The two deleted scenes included are interesting but only hint at other scenes lost during the editing process. It used to be that deleted scenes would be tossed into a bin with trims for possible later use not the digital age has made that impossible unless the director saves ALL the trims.We also get a great 90 minute documentary on the challenges (and fears)that Darabont faced in making another Stephen King project. He was afraid that he would be seen only as a Stephen King director (or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now)which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk.We also get Tom Hanks make up tests, Michael Duncan Clark's screen tests, the teaser trailer (along with a look at what constitutes a great teaser), original theatrical trailer. We also get the original vintage featurette on the production of the film. I would have liked a commentary from Hanks and the other actors but with so much time having passed and the actors busy schedules it would have been difficult to assemble them for a sit down commentary track (although they could have cobbled together a second audio track with actors interviews discussing the film although I doubt it would as valuable).Nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $6 extra dollars this is the edition to get. I should point out that many retailers (Costco among them) have this available for $9.00 the same price as the original version is currently selling for making this a terrific bargain.REVIW OF THE FILM BELOW:""The Green Mile"" the third film made by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to Darabont's version of ""Shawkshank"". Based on the five short serial novels (now available as a single novel) published back in 1997. This marvelous follow up film is a terrific but flawed film that sags a bit at the beginning but manages to quickly pick up us its pace.

36847,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0780628799,Wuchak,"[7, 10]","""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Sephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.[SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities of the nature of John Coffey]John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easlily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles.""[End SPOILER ALERT]BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face.",5,"A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art -- Captivating, Reverent, Tear-Inducing",1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,2474,"['Green', 'Mile', 'expertly', 'film', 'genres', 'part', 'prison', 'flick', 'part', 'supernatural', 'mystery', 'part', 'drama', 'was', 'adapted', 'Sephen', 'King', 'novel', 'director/writer', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'released', '1999', ""'re"", 'not', 'admirer', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books/films', ""'m"", 'not', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'let', 'deter', 'viewing', 'beautiful-and-spiritually-profound', 'film', 'Green', 'Mile', 'typical', 'horror', 'story', 'have', 'couple', 'horrific', 'scenes.THE', 'STORY', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'head', 'Death', 'Row', 'guard', 'Tennessee', 'prison', 'Depression', 'new', 'inmate', 'introduced', 'hulking', 'black', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'Coffey', 'exquisitely', 'played', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'who', 'condemned', 'death', 'rape', 'murder', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'Hanks', 'guard', 'slowly', 'become', 'intrigued', 'seemingly', 'pure-hearted', 'giant', 'begin', 'realize', 'eminently', 'gifted', 'decidedly', 'supernatural', 'way', 'conclude', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'guilty', 'crime', 'case', 'who', 'guilty', 'will', 'guilty', 'party', 'get', 'away', 'Green', 'Mile', '3-hour', 'film', 'way', 'limited', 'attention', 'span', 'yet', 'somehow', 'utterly', 'engrossing', 'even', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'film', 'character/dialogue', 'driven', 'unique', 'wholly', 'unpredictable', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'run-of-the-mill', 'prison', 'flick', 'fact', 'largely', 'place', 'prison', '1930s', 'secondary', 'issue', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'supernatural', 'mystery/drama', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'next', 'paragraph', 'want', 'consider', 'possibilities', 'nature', 'John', 'Coffey', ']', 'John', 'Coffey', 'last', 'name', 'evidently', 'derived', 'ancient', 'Sumerian', 'word', 'kophi', 'winged', 'creature', 'Hence', 'John', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'angel', 'messenger', 'Almighty', 'truth', 'John', 'obvious', 'type', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'verified', 'six', 'ways', '1', 'initials', 'are', 'J.C', '2', 'completely', 'pure/good-hearted', 'can', 'easlily', 'recognize', 'true', 'evil', '3', 'miraculously', 'people', '4', 'divine', 'judgment', '5', 'sacrificed', 'even', 'completely', 'innocent', '6', 'eternal', 'life', 'sense', 'evidenced', 'extended', 'life-span', 'Hanks', 'character', 'mouse', 'Mr', 'Jingles', '[', 'End', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Green', 'Mile', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'there', '5', '10', 'best', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Now', 'excuse', 'wipe', 'tears', 'face']",N/A

36850,AP3B615GM191G,0780628799,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","A few weeks ago, I finished Stephen King's novel ""The Green Mile"" and realized that I was about the only person on the planet who had not seen the film adaptation.  Upon viewing the 3-hour piece of work, I was amazed by the degree to which King's writing was able to be translated to the big screen (as opposed to, say, ""Hearts In Atlantis"", which left much to be desired).The plot of the film is exactly the same as that of the book, centering on a 1930s death row prison and the strange (paranormal?) events that transpired there.  All the actors are dead-on in their interpretation of King's characters, such as the inspired Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the lunatic guard Percy Wetmore(Doug Hutchison), the even loony-er prisoner ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), and the hulking, meek inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), from which the story really draws from.I won't give away any plot details here, but suffice it to say that pretty much everyone will enjoy this film.  While the subject matter and language (the film IS set in a prison) rules out the kiddies, pretty much anybody else should find it to be an inspiring journey, as the movie explores the themes of death, love, and doing the noble deed in the face of great opposition.I don't say this for many book-film combinations, but in this case you may actually be better off in seeing the film, as the acting is so wonderful and the plot does not deviate from the novel.",5,One Of The Best Book-To-Film Translation I've Ever Seen,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,1443,"['few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'finished', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'Green', 'Mile', 'realized', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'planet', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'adaptation', 'viewing', '3-hour', 'piece', 'work', 'was', 'amazed', 'degree', 'King', 'writing', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'translated', 'big', 'screen', 'opposed', 'say', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', '.The', 'plot', 'film', 'exactly', 'same', 'book', 'centering', '1930s', 'death', 'row', 'prison', 'strange', 'paranormal', 'events', 'transpired', 'there', 'actors', 'are', 'dead-on', 'interpretation', 'King', 'characters', 'such', 'inspired', 'Paul', 'Edgecombe', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'lunatic', 'guard', 'Percy', 'Wetmore', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'even', 'loony-er', 'prisoner', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Wharton', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'hulking', 'meek', 'inmate', 'John', 'Coffey', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'story', 'really', 'from.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'details', 'here', 'say', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'language', 'film', 'IS', 'set', 'prison', 'rules', 'out', 'kiddies', 'pretty', 'much', 'anybody', 'else', 'should', 'find', 'be', 'inspiring', 'journey', 'movie', 'themes', 'death', 'love', 'doing', 'noble', 'deed', 'face', 'great', 'opposition.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'many', 'book-film', 'combinations', 'case', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'seeing', 'film', 'acting', 'so', 'wonderful', 'plot', 'not', 'deviate', 'novel']",N/A
36851,A1TOML01ZYPUFR,0780628799,"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend""","[5, 5]","It was with unprecedented anticipation that I awaited this film.  The prior collaboration of this team of talented filmmakers resulted in the production of my favorite film of all time: The Shawshank Redemption.  And, indeed, while The Green Mile hasn't assumed that title, it certainly remains one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, one of the greatest movies ever made.  Some argue and complain about its length.  I counter with the claim that length is only of importance when you can count the minutes pass; in the case of The Green Mile, the film is far too entertaining to ever bore, far too involving to ever allow the viewer to exit back through the fourth wall and out into the audience again.  It is that engaging, that beautiful a film, and it deserves all the respect one can bestow upon it.Simply put, the story is positively phenomenal.  Some might find a few of the films more somber plot points to resonate with a silly perversion, but with the backward light one cannot help but admire everything that went into creating this tale.  The structure is magnificent, as we travel from episode to episode, covering every fascinating subplot and side-story, and then intertwining all of them together in the end.  Acting is phenomenal.  Tom Hanks, like always, cannot disappoint.  Michael Clarke Duncan plays a role that no other actor could have played.  Even in the DVD documentary, director Frank Darabont makes comment on the difficulty in casting the role as John Coffey.  Certainly, Duncan has all of the physical attributes that make him appropriate for the part, but moreover his performance excels beyond what anyone expected.  The character in the novel is one that can hardly be imagined, it is such an innocent brute of gentleness, yet Duncan manages to capture all of that and more.  Frank Darabont's direction is immaculate, as always.  It's amazing what he is able to accomplish in such a limited set.  Most of the film occurs within the death row penitentiary block, yet he somehow manages to capture a new image in every shot, making it perpetually interesting, and never redundant despite its solitary location.In short this film not only met my high expectations, it exceeded them.  I had read the books years prior, enjoyed them heavily, and thus waited eagerly for the film adaptation.  Every aspect of this film is enjoyable; every aspect is entertaining; and so when this is assembled into a near three-hour movie, length no longer becomes an issue.  The film keeps a steady pace that develops and moves on, never straying--though bearing the appearance that it is--from the ultimate plot.  The finished product is a near seamless adaptation of a fine book, transporting it to an exceptional movie.  It has become a perfect addition to my DVD collection, making a fine companion besides it's sister film, Shawshank.  Indeed, Mile even manages to surpass Shawshank in several respects: it has a more emotional basis, its stories are better entwined, it conquers the mood of the moment more wholly.  The Green Mile stands as one of filmmaking's best, one of my favorites, and one that is sure to please you as well.",5,A Perfect Translation of King's Best!,1012694400,"02 3, 2002",2002,3151,"['was', 'unprecedented', 'anticipation', 'awaited', 'film', 'prior', 'collaboration', 'team', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'resulted', 'production', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'indeed', 'Green', 'Mile', ""n't"", 'assumed', 'title', 'certainly', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'argue', 'complain', 'length', 'counter', 'claim', 'length', 'only', 'importance', 'when', 'can', 'count', 'minutes', 'pass', 'case', 'Green', 'Mile', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'entertaining', 'ever', 'bore', 'far', 'too', 'involving', 'ever', 'allow', 'viewer', 'exit', 'back', 'fourth', 'wall', 'audience', 'again', 'engaging', 'film', 'respect', 'one', 'can', 'bestow', 'it.Simply', 'put', 'story', 'positively', 'phenomenal', 'might', 'find', 'few', 'films', 'more', 'somber', 'plot', 'points', 'resonate', 'silly', 'perversion', 'backward', 'light', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'admire', 'everything', 'went', 'creating', 'tale', 'structure', 'magnificent', 'travel', 'episode', 'episode', 'covering', 'fascinating', 'subplot', 'side-story', 'then', 'intertwining', 'together', 'end', 'Acting', 'phenomenal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'always', 'can', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'role', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Even', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'comment', 'difficulty', 'casting', 'role', 'John', 'Coffey', 'Certainly', 'Duncan', 'physical', 'attributes', 'make', 'appropriate', 'part', 'moreover', 'performance', 'excels', 'what', 'anyone', 'expected', 'character', 'novel', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'imagined', 'such', 'innocent', 'brute', 'gentleness', 'Duncan', 'capture', 'more', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'direction', 'immaculate', 'always', 'amazing', 'what', 'able', 'accomplish', 'such', 'limited', 'set', 'Most', 'film', 'death', 'row', 'penitentiary', 'block', 'somehow', 'capture', 'new', 'image', 'shot', 'making', 'perpetually', 'interesting', 'never', 'redundant', 'solitary', 'location.In', 'short', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'met', 'high', 'expectations', 'exceeded', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'years', 'prior', 'enjoyed', 'heavily', 'thus', 'waited', 'eagerly', 'film', 'adaptation', 'aspect', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'entertaining', 'so', 'when', 'assembled', 'near', 'three-hour', 'movie', 'no', 'longer', 'issue', 'film', 'steady', 'pace', 'moves', 'never', 'straying', 'bearing', 'appearance', 'ultimate', 'plot', 'finished', 'product', 'near', 'seamless', 'adaptation', 'fine', 'book', 'transporting', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'become', 'perfect', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'making', 'fine', 'companion', 'sister', 'film', 'Shawshank', 'Indeed', 'Mile', 'even', 'surpass', 'Shawshank', 'several', 'respects', 'more', 'emotional', 'basis', 'stories', 'are', 'better', 'entwined', 'mood', 'moment', 'more', 'wholly', 'Green', 'Mile', 'one', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'one', 'favorites', 'one', 'sure', 'please', 'as', 'well']",N/A
