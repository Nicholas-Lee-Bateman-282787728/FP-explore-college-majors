It came in the mail just a couple of days ago and my wife and I have been watching it over and over, and just like the other Celtic Thunder DVD's we have, we never get tired of watching and listening to them.What's so incredible about this group is not only their fabulous voices and great harmonies, but that each one can play various instruments on a professional level as well. Neil Byrne is virtually a one-man band: he plays drums (Heritage), and plays lead, rhythm, and bass guitar, and has a beautiful singing voice, to boot! The song on this DVD that I've seen no one comment about is ""Halleluja."" The first time I heard Neil Byrne sing ""Noreen"" on the Heritage DVD, I said that they needed to make him one of the lead singers of the group and not just use him as a back-up. And I think his solo performance in ""Halleluja"" shows that he is more than worthy of it.Someone said in his review that he couldn't see how this group could get any better but when he watched this DVD, they were exactly that... better than ever. And I would just say ""DITTO!"" Five stars is the highest rating that can be given, but if it were possible, I would give Celtic Thunder and this VOYAGE II video a 10-star rating. Obviously, musical tastes vary widely from person to person; I have 4 C. T. videos: The Show, Heritage, Voyage, and Voyage II...

I did, from the front row at the Verizon Theatre in Houston.  I'll tell y'all just what I told George after the show - that I didn't think they could be any better than they were before they lost Paul and Damian, but THEY ARE!  The blend of their voices is much smoother.  You don't have certain people sounding out over others.  It wasn't that they were trying to, it just was.  Place in the Choir and Seven Drunken Nights are hysterical and I have no idea how on earth they get all the words out!  ""Low Places"" is the best song I've ever heard from Ryan.  Daniel has a very sweet voice, and was charming during the show, especially with Keith in ""You've Got a friend in Me.""  He isn't as strong as Damian in the past, but does hold his own.  I doubt that many 13-year olds who ""got a gig"" that was just about to record, and then left on a multi-state tour could do as well!  Even if you didn't know that Harry Chapin was a favorite of George, you could hear it. Neil, Keith, you're awesome!  My favorite?  For a fun song it'll have to be Seven Drunken Nights, but as a group song, it has to be ""Out on the Mira"" or ... well, any one of them!

It wasn't on the CD or the DVD and I wondered what was wrong.  Then I found out about Voyage 2 and immediately bought it.  This is their best yet!  Keith, Emmet and Neil seem to be the leaders of the group now.  They do most of the novelty numbers and Keith and Daniel seem to have the comedy down pat.  Neil seemed shy in Heritage and sang quietly on that DVD, but on this one he shines.  He is the lead singer on many numbers, and does a fantastic job.  Emmet is so good you don't miss Paul.  He can handle novelty or ballads which Paul could not do.  He didn't have the voice for novelty numbers.  Daniel is so cute I hope he becomes a permanent member of the group.  Ryan wasn't featured much in Voyage 2.  I don't know if that was his request or just the way it worked out.  George is doing much fewer serious numbers and many more fun ones.  Some of the older numbers such as Place in the Choir and Ireland's Call had to be reworked to include the new voices, but you don't miss Damian and Paul there either.  George simply took over the bass part of Place in the Choir.  You've got a Friend in Me and Seven Drunken Nights were just hilarious.  Buy this DVD on Amazon quickly.

1539175,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B007W38WQ2,PhotoGraphics,"[4, 5]","I just watched the Celtic Thunder Voyage II DVD on its first day of release. I have followed this group since Day One, attending their live concerts and owning all of the DVD's. I have watched them grow and change.I believe Celtic Thunder is currently at its closest stage of perfection yet and this release is hands-down one of their best two DVD's. The ensemble interacts and meshes almost perfectly. Some felt Daniel Furlong was a bit out of place, he has since been removed from the group and indirectly replaced by Colm Keegan.I didn't review the first part of the Voyage release because I knew it was going to end up a ""set"" at Amazon. The two DVD's are both good but compared side-by-side the first Voyage (as people have noted) seems rushed and is over before you know it, while Voyage II has a near-perfect song set, the lads seem to be having more fun, and it ends up seeming more like a complete show.Here are some thoughts about Voyage II:1. I have been a fan of Neil Byrne since I first saw him on stage, then a background guitarist.  He has style, charisma, talent and no-doubt star-quality looks. I am very pleased that not only was he moved to an occasional front man position, he has now earned a starring role and (unlike Voyage in which he barely was seen solo for a few moments) now commands the lead for a good part of the show. His voice is amazing, and it was sheer brilliance to cast him for the part of Hallelujah.  It is one of the best versions I have heard. Mr. Byrne clearly understands the meaning of the song and delivers it flawlessly.2. Ryan Kelly seems to be a bit more relaxed in this show. Since the show was recorded he had the misfortune of being in a serious accident. I hope he continues to heal and is soon well enough to rejoin the group.3. There was quite a bit of dissention among Celtic Thunder fans on the Storm DVD when it almost appeared they were ""merging"" with Celtic Woman. I'm not sure if it was as much as a faux pas on the producer's part as an experiment that fell flat. I believe all Celtic Thunder fans appreciate the fine work the rest of the band does; we just don't want to see the talents of the main characters diluted by backup singers and dancers. The producers clearly got the message when making Voyage II and wisely dedicated one production number to the band where each got the chance to shine, from fiddle to dance to percussion to woodwind. It worked so much better than trying to have them compete with the primary players!  All are very talented (of course) and the production number worked perfectly. The fiddle player, the woman dancer and the percussionist (Declan O'Donoghue)owned the stage during their segment.I'm not sure why there is a change-up in the lyrics to the closing song ""Ireland's Call"". Many people believe this is the Irish National Anthem, when rather it is a song written to be sung at Irish rugby tournaments. I love the song and would be happy if EVERY Celtic Thunder show ended with it.  But why leave out the lyrics ""From the four proud provinces of Ireland""? That is one of the many lyrics of the songs that gives me goose-bumps, knowing of Irelands rocky past and how they have come together to celebrate that ALL of Ireland has come together.Video quality is one of the best of all the DVD's, clearly the producers are concentrating on that aspect, upscaling on a Blu-Ray player looked excellent. The same is true for the most part with audio quality, although there were a few times that audience applause seemed mixed down to only my one 6.1 speaker in the back. Costumes for CT have always been right on (except for some questionable choices on the Storm DVD); for the most part the lads wear what equate to street clothes except for the traditional kilts they wear for Ireland's Call. On this DVD the mix of what they wear blends a bit better in terms of being ""warmer"" Irish tones. My personal choice would be that they dress more like they would at home in Ireland/Scotland (but in a more entertainer-like version).Kudos that the producers brought back a bonus track.  We who buy DVD's don't expect much extra beyond the main performance but to have NO bonus track just seemed cheesy on a previous DVD. On Voyage II the lads are shown on their tour bus and having fun in a variety of places they played, like Niagara Falls. Having seen them in person ""off stage"" I have a pretty good feeling of what they are like outside of the actual performance. This behind-the-scenes video is excellent for people who may be being introduced to them for the first time. Repeating something from one of my previous reviews, it is so refreshing to see a band who are still more in love with what they do and in awe of where they are than in love and awe of themselves. Ceoil agus Craic!Footnote: I don't understand how someone can write a valid review of a DVD performance months before before it is released or if they state they haven't even watched it yet. Going to a live show and watching a DVD production are not the same thing.
