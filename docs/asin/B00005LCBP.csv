663032,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00005LCBP,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[2, 4]","Anne Frank, the Whole Story stars Ben Kinsley as Otto Frank and Hannah Taylor-Gordon as Anne.  This 180 minute Israeli production starts out in Amsterdam just before WWII starts.  Hannah does bear a striking resemblance to Anne...you do have to overlook her obvious Britishness.  The beginning starts out in a tame atmosphere, so if you know the story you may be a bit bored with the everydayness of Anne's depiction pre-Annex.And considering the striving for authenticity Mr. van Pels (Joachim Kr&oacute;l) makes a couple jokes that were English language puns, i.e. they don't work in Dutch.But when the Franks go into hiding we begin to get engrossed.  We are shown the empty annex (as it stills looks today) and soon we are seeing the story through Kingsley's eyes.  And life in the Annex is given a realism where the people get on your nerves as well as Anne's.  Lili Taylor does a great job as Miep Gies, the helper who saves the diary.And we are shown exactly how they are betrayed, and what happens afterwards.  A segment at Westerbork Transit camp, then Auschwitz, then Bergen-Belsen, all very accurate and harrowing in depiction.  Importantly we are shown what actually happened to Anne, and Kingsley's quiet sense of loss really forces empathy.At the end we are given text which shows what happened to each person in the Annex, and it says ""Aside from the Bible, Anne's Diary is the world's most widely read work of nonfiction"".  Well, I guess noone had the guts to bring up to the producers that the Bible is a work of fiction (unless you believe in Adam and Eve, Moses, 7 day creation, etc.)This is by far the best version of Anne Frank's story on film.The 1959 one is good as the first major film ever to address the Holocaust (albeit indirectly), the 1980 Melissa Gilbert one was pathetic, so see this one and the documentaries.",5,"Excellent, realistic, much better than the other versions!",1045699200,"02 20, 2003",2003,1842,"['Anne', 'Frank', 'Whole', 'Story', 'Ben', 'Kinsley', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'Anne', '180', 'minute', 'Israeli', 'production', 'out', 'Amsterdam', 'just', 'before', 'WWII', 'starts', 'Hannah', 'bear', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Anne', 'do', 'have', 'overlook', 'obvious', 'Britishness', 'beginning', 'out', 'tame', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'know', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'bored', 'everydayness', 'Anne', 'depiction', 'pre-Annex.And', 'considering', 'striving', 'authenticity', 'Mr.', 'van', 'Pels', 'Joachim', 'Kr', 'oacute', 'couple', 'jokes', 'were', 'English', 'language', 'puns', 'i.e', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Dutch.But', 'when', 'Franks', 'go', 'hiding', 'begin', 'get', 'engrossed', 'are', 'shown', 'empty', 'annex', 'today', 'soon', 'are', 'seeing', 'story', 'Kingsley', 'eyes', 'life', 'Annex', 'given', 'realism', 'where', 'people', 'get', 'nerves', 'as', 'well', 'Anne', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'great', 'job', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'helper', 'who', 'diary.And', 'are', 'shown', 'exactly', 'how', 'are', 'betrayed', 'what', 'afterwards', 'segment', 'Westerbork', 'Transit', 'camp', 'then', 'Auschwitz', 'then', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'very', 'accurate', 'harrowing', 'depiction', 'Importantly', 'are', 'shown', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'Anne', 'Kingsley', 'quiet', 'sense', 'loss', 'really', 'empathy.At', 'end', 'are', 'given', 'text', 'what', 'happened', 'person', 'Annex', 'Aside', 'Bible', 'Anne', 'Diary', 'world', 'most', 'widely', 'read', 'work', 'nonfiction', 'Well', 'guess', 'noone', 'had', 'guts', 'bring', 'up', 'producers', 'Bible', 'work', 'fiction', 'believe', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'Moses', '7', 'day', 'creation', 'etc', 'far', 'best', 'version', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'story', 'film.The', '1959', 'one', 'good', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'ever', 'address', 'Holocaust', 'indirectly', '1980', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'one', 'was', 'pathetic', 'so', 'see', 'one', 'documentaries']",N/A

663035,A38BU9SLS82TGT,B00005LCBP,Celeste M. Harmer,"[3, 3]","Hands down the best screen version of Anne Frank's diary I have ever seen. While other versions terminate at the secret annex's inhabitants' discovery by the Nazis, this one trudges on to Anne's last days in Belsen and Otto's consuming grief at the loss of his family.For those who may not know Anne Frank's tale, here it is: Anne Frank was a normal, high-spirited young girl who had the immense misfortune to be Jewish during the Nazi occupation of Holland. A budding writer, her parents gave her a diary for her 13th birthday. At the diary's beginnings, Anne annotated what is the normal life of a young girl: boyfriends, puppy love, best friends, movies, books, and family. But a month after her birthday, the diary took on a somber tone. Several months earlier, the Nazis had begun to round up Jews in Anne's home city of Amsterdam and send them to horrible extermination camps such as Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, etc. Otto Frank, determined to keep himself and his family out of the Nazis' clutches, spirited them away from their home and into hiding. The chosen place was a hidden set of rooms located in the rear of his office building. Anne called it the secret annex, and for the two years she and her family -- along with the Van Pels family and a dentist named Fritz Pfeffer -- hid there, she composed a written account of life in hiding. She spared no detail in her descriptions of rations, shortages of goods, war news, the grumpiness she and the others experienced at being confined in such close quarters, her growing affection for Peter Van Pels, and the constant fear of discovery and death. Office workers Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl, Mr. Kleinman, and Mr. Kugler were the annex inhabitants' only link to the outside world. Miep especially took risks to ensure that they were fed, cared for, and received news of events in the world outside their cramped lodging. They longed for the day the Allies would invade and liberate Europe, which would mean freedom at last from the secret annex.Tragically, Anne and the others had their worst fear realized when the Nazis penetrated the secret annex and dragged them away to various concentration camps. Only Otto survived, and he published Anne's diary a few years after the war.This movie is exactly as I envisioned the story the diary tells. Even the characters are how I pictured they'd look as I read the diary. Also, the accuracy and authenticity are very good.",5,Picks up where other versions left off.,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,2422,"['Hands', 'down', 'best', 'screen', 'version', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'diary', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'terminate', 'secret', 'annex', 'inhabitants', 'discovery', 'Nazis', 'one', 'Anne', 'last', 'days', 'Belsen', 'Otto', 'consuming', 'grief', 'loss', 'family.For', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'tale', 'here', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'was', 'normal', 'high-spirited', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'immense', 'misfortune', 'be', 'Jewish', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Holland', 'A', 'budding', 'writer', 'parents', 'gave', 'diary', '13th', 'birthday', 'diary', 'beginnings', 'Anne', 'annotated', 'what', 'normal', 'life', 'young', 'girl', 'boyfriends', 'puppy', 'love', 'best', 'friends', 'movies', 'books', 'family', 'month', 'birthday', 'diary', 'took', 'somber', 'tone', 'Several', 'months', 'earlier', 'Nazis', 'had', 'begun', 'round', 'up', 'Jews', 'Anne', 'home', 'city', 'Amsterdam', 'send', 'horrible', 'extermination', 'camps', 'such', 'Auschwitz', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'etc', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'determined', 'keep', 'family', 'Nazis', 'clutches', 'spirited', 'away', 'home', 'hiding', 'chosen', 'place', 'was', 'hidden', 'set', 'rooms', 'located', 'rear', 'office', 'building', 'Anne', 'called', 'secret', 'annex', 'two', 'years', 'family', 'Van', 'Pels', 'family', 'dentist', 'named', 'Fritz', 'Pfeffer', 'hid', 'there', 'composed', 'written', 'account', 'life', 'hiding', 'spared', 'detail', 'descriptions', 'rations', 'shortages', 'goods', 'war', 'news', 'grumpiness', 'others', 'experienced', 'being', 'confined', 'such', 'close', 'quarters', 'growing', 'affection', 'Peter', 'Van', 'Pels', 'constant', 'fear', 'discovery', 'death', 'Office', 'workers', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'Bep', 'Voskuijl', 'Mr.', 'Kleinman', 'Mr.', 'Kugler', 'were', 'annex', 'inhabitants', 'only', 'link', 'outside', 'world', 'Miep', 'especially', 'took', 'risks', 'ensure', 'were', 'fed', 'cared', 'received', 'news', 'events', 'world', 'cramped', 'lodging', 'longed', 'day', 'Allies', 'would', 'invade', 'liberate', 'Europe', 'would', 'mean', 'freedom', 'last', 'secret', 'annex.Tragically', 'Anne', 'others', 'had', 'worst', 'fear', 'realized', 'when', 'Nazis', 'penetrated', 'secret', 'annex', 'dragged', 'away', 'various', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Only', 'Otto', 'survived', 'published', 'Anne', 'diary', 'few', 'years', 'war.This', 'movie', 'exactly', 'envisioned', 'story', 'diary', 'tells', 'Even', 'characters', 'are', 'how', 'pictured', ""'d"", 'look', 'read', 'diary', 'Also', 'accuracy', 'authenticity', 'are', 'very', 'good']",N/A
663036,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005LCBP,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","Through many months of my early adolescence, which I spent cooped up behind the barbed wire fence of a military base in Texas, I'd considered Anne Frank's diary to be my best friend. I read it constantly, partially because I could identify with many of her experiences. I too have a sister who is three years older, who was a much better student than myself. I was born 40 years after Anne was, and am part of a minority group, and I can remember being tormented by certain people close to me and not being able to fight back very often. Like Anne, I also love to write.That her diary is now the most widely read work of nonfiction after the Bible comes as no surprise to me now because the world is full of teenage girls in need of reassurance.I taped just about every documentary and/or film on Anne Frank's life since my teens. This latest one, which reaffirms events first featured in Ernst Schnabel's 1958 biography on the last seven months of Anne's life, is definitely one of the most profound.Hannah Taylor-Gordon's Anne Frank is the most accurately portrayed version of the character I've seen since Lisa Jacobs' portrayal in 1988. This actress who also appeared in ""Jakob the Liar"", another Holocaust drama, gives the young diarist the bubbly, effervescent personality described by those who knew her in real life. Ben Kingsley looks a lot like Otto Frank. His gentle, kind, authoritative mannerisms make it easy to accept him as the father on whom Anne doted. Jessica Manley's Margot has a gracious, ladylike quality like the real Margot Frank, and Tatjana Blacher's Edith Hollander-Frank is caring but overprotective towards her children.About the only inaccuracy I can detect is the fact that in this miniseries, there was no rain falling the day the Franks went into hiding. Brenda Blethyn's portrayal of Mrs. Van Pels adds levity to life in the cramped attic. Nicholas Audsley's Peter is warm and amiable. New dimension is added to the lives of Van Pels and Dr. Pfeffer because we see more of what they were like before they went into hiding. The protectors of the Annexe members, led by Lili Taylor's Miep Gies were appropriately staid and stoic, looking very much like people who had to work hard to keep certain secrets hidden from the outside world and from other factory workers. Rob Das looks more like Jan Gies than any other actor I've seen portray him. The role of Charlotte Kaletta in boosting the morale of Fritz Pfeffer is included as well. Her ultimate reaction to his fate is a moving one.The scenes of the refugees at Westerbork are somewhat hopeful looking, although viewers know that the worst is yet to come. Even as I watched the women of the annexe being shorn of their hair upon their arrival at Auschwitz, having read Melissa Mueller's book on which this film is based, I'd say that audiences should be greatful that Disney spares them the full reenactment of that degrading procedure because the hair on top of the heads of the prisoners was actually the last section of hair to go.From there on in, Anne's life grows more and more abysmal, although she meets a few friends along the way. Of all the Secret Annexe members who perish in the death camps, the only death witnessed by the audience is the one which, by all accounts, finally defeated Anne. The film concludes with the revelations of what happened to Anne's friends and family. Some revelations were triumphant and others tragic.To date this is one of the most emotional, complete, and reverently told versions of Anne Frank's life. --A highly commendable effort!",5,Powerful But Tragic Tale,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,3562,"['many', 'months', 'early', 'adolescence', 'spent', 'cooped', 'up', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'military', 'base', 'Texas', ""'d"", 'considered', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'diary', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'read', 'constantly', 'partially', 'could', 'identify', 'many', 'experiences', 'too', 'have', 'sister', 'who', 'three', 'years', 'older', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'student', 'was', 'born', '40', 'years', 'Anne', 'was', 'am', 'part', 'minority', 'group', 'can', 'remember', 'being', 'tormented', 'certain', 'people', 'close', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'fight', 'back', 'very', 'often', 'Anne', 'also', 'love', 'write.That', 'diary', 'now', 'most', 'widely', 'read', 'work', 'nonfiction', 'Bible', 'surprise', 'now', 'world', 'full', 'teenage', 'girls', 'need', 'reassurance.I', 'taped', 'just', 'documentary', 'and/or', 'film', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'life', 'teens', 'latest', 'one', 'events', 'first', 'featured', 'Ernst', 'Schnabel', '1958', 'biography', 'last', 'seven', 'months', 'Anne', 'life', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'profound.Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'most', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'version', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lisa', 'Jacobs', 'portrayal', '1988', 'actress', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Jakob', 'Liar', 'Holocaust', 'drama', 'young', 'diarist', 'bubbly', 'effervescent', 'personality', 'described', 'who', 'knew', 'real', 'life', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'lot', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'gentle', 'kind', 'authoritative', 'mannerisms', 'make', 'easy', 'accept', 'father', 'whom', 'Anne', 'doted', 'Jessica', 'Manley', 'Margot', 'gracious', 'ladylike', 'quality', 'real', 'Margot', 'Frank', 'Tatjana', 'Blacher', 'Edith', 'Hollander-Frank', 'caring', 'overprotective', 'towards', 'children.About', 'only', 'inaccuracy', 'can', 'detect', 'fact', 'miniseries', 'was', 'rain', 'falling', 'day', 'Franks', 'went', 'hiding', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'portrayal', 'Mrs.', 'Van', 'Pels', 'levity', 'life', 'cramped', 'attic', 'Nicholas', 'Audsley', 'Peter', 'warm', 'amiable', 'New', 'dimension', 'added', 'lives', 'Van', 'Pels', 'Dr.', 'Pfeffer', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'were', 'went', 'hiding', 'protectors', 'Annexe', 'members', 'led', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'were', 'appropriately', 'staid', 'stoic', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'work', 'hard', 'keep', 'certain', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'outside', 'world', 'other', 'factory', 'workers', 'Rob', 'Das', 'more', 'Jan', 'Gies', 'other', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'portray', 'role', 'Charlotte', 'Kaletta', 'boosting', 'morale', 'Fritz', 'Pfeffer', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'ultimate', 'reaction', 'fate', 'moving', 'one.The', 'scenes', 'refugees', 'Westerbork', 'are', 'somewhat', 'hopeful', 'looking', 'viewers', 'know', 'worst', 'yet', 'come', 'Even', 'watched', 'women', 'annexe', 'being', 'shorn', 'hair', 'arrival', 'Auschwitz', 'having', 'read', 'Melissa', 'Mueller', 'book', 'film', 'based', ""'d"", 'say', 'audiences', 'should', 'be', 'greatful', 'Disney', 'full', 'reenactment', 'degrading', 'procedure', 'hair', 'top', 'heads', 'prisoners', 'was', 'actually', 'last', 'section', 'hair', 'go.From', 'there', 'Anne', 'life', 'more', 'more', 'abysmal', 'few', 'friends', 'way', 'Secret', 'Annexe', 'members', 'who', 'perish', 'death', 'camps', 'only', 'death', 'witnessed', 'audience', 'one', 'accounts', 'finally', 'defeated', 'Anne', 'film', 'revelations', 'what', 'happened', 'Anne', 'friends', 'family', 'revelations', 'were', 'triumphant', 'others', 'tragic.To', 'date', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'complete', 'reverently', 'told', 'versions', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'life', 'highly', 'commendable', 'effort']",N/A

663040,A24ZYSYICMEGSD,B00005LCBP,Jody Mosier,"[3, 3]","This is one of the best films that I've ever seen! In some films that are based on a true story, directors twist the plot line around to suit their whims. But in this one, the producers stuck close to the real story, portraying each character and event as they really were. Actual footage from WWII was inserted in certain points of the film, giving it an authentic air. Also, some of the consultants were people who knew the real Frank family, people like Miep Gies (who to my knowledge is still alive in Amsterdam today) and Jacqueline Van Marsen, one of Anne's childhood friends. The actors and actresses acted out their roles superbly, and I was especially impressed with Hannah Taylor Gordon's performance. Not only does she bear a striking resemblence to the real Anne Frank, but she also acts very much like I believe Anne would have acted. I also appreciate the fact that, even though the film's setting is a very harsh time in history, the producers managed to show the brutality of the Nazi occupation without resorting to blood and gore. Anne's story is a sad one, but one worth watching, because it reminds us that the people who died in the holocaust were just normal human beings with hopes and dreams, whose lives were abruptly snuffed out by people who were blinded by racism and extreme nationalism.

I am so glad this film is finally out on video because I've been waiting and waiting for it to be out on video (I had forgotten to tape this film when I watched it on ABC). By the way, ANNE FRANK - THE WHOLE STORY is an Emmy Award nominee miniseries and I hope that this film wins all of the nominations it received because this is just superb! And Hannah Taylor-Gordan is absolutely superb; so is Ben Kingsley and the rest of the cast. If you missed this film when it aired on ABC, then I definitely recommend that you buy this video because I know you will not regret it.",5,The best film based on the Anne Frank story!,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,1230,"['films', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'ABC/Disney', 'did', 'incredible', 'flawless', 'job', 'production', 'actors', 'were', 'outstanding', 'As', 'soon', 'started', 'watching', 'miniseries', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'was', 'hooked', 'had', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'how', 'real', 'exciting', 'was', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'really', 'little', 'kids', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'concentration', 'camp', 'great', 'great', 'film', 'most', 'ages', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'children', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'older', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Anyone', 'who', 'facinated', 'story', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'will', 'love', 'appreicate', 'film', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'film', 'finally', 'out', 'video', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'be', 'out', 'video', 'had', 'forgotten', 'tape', 'film', 'when', 'watched', 'ABC', 'way', 'ANNE', 'FRANK', 'WHOLE', 'STORY', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'miniseries', 'hope', 'film', 'nominations', 'received', 'just', 'superb', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordan', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'rest', 'cast', 'missed', 'film', 'when', 'aired', 'ABC', 'then', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buy', 'video', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'regret']",N/A

I watched it when it first aired on television, and the tears that I shed were falling of their own accord. Correct me...I was sobbing. There was no words to describe the agony that Otto Frank must have felt when he realized Anne and Margot were not coming back, the agony, when he read Annes diary and storues, and his feelings re-kindled to the wonderful daughter he had lost, but loved so much. Ben Kingsley is an amazing actor, I'd like to meet him to tell him what an amazing job he did on his protrayal. I don't know words to descrobe the horrible conditions of those Concentration Camps, the feeling of alway sbeing cold, hungry always knowing that you were itching because Lice and Fleas infested your whole body, and knowing that you can do nothing about it. I kow no words good enough to feel what Anne must have been feeling when she knew that her older sister, Margot, was dead, and that she would not see her living once again. I live my own older sister tremendously, I feel that Margot was to Anne like Tara is to me. I don't know what it is like to starve, to have no decent clothing, to stand for hours from the crack of dawn to, sometimes, the late evening, while they count you over and over, to dig endlessly, to know that you were being sent to the gas chambers, to know that you would have to go into hiding, leaving your family, friends, and everything that you had ever known and held dear, to know that you were going to die, of hunger, disease, cold...All I know is that if movies such as this can always be made to remind us of the Jews sacrifice, and undying courage and bravery during the Holocaust, that we will live our lives a little differently from that day forward.

663043,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005LCBP,Z Hayes,"[28, 29]","""Anne Frank - the Whole Story"" is a well-acted and beautifully filmed movie based on Melissa Muller's biography of Anne Frank.It basically recounts how the Frank family comprising father Otto, mother Edith and daughters Margot and Anne chose to go into hiding in Amsterdam after the Nazis stepped up their persecution of Jews [and Margot got a summons for deportation].Their hiding place is a secret annex located in the factory run by Otto Frank. The Franks' trusted Gentile friends help them and soon the hiding place is opened to accommodate the Van Pels' [husband, wife and teen son, Peter] and a dentist, Mr Pfeffer. The Jewish refugees spend about 2 yrs in hiding, from July 1942 till Aug 1944 [when they were betrayed].This was a difficult movie to watch because I was already familiar with Anne's story [having read ""Diary of a Young Girl"" more than two decades ago] and knew what happened to Anne, her family and the rest of the hidden Jews. The movie was beautifully filmed with great attention to period details and the excellent casting choices made this the best movie on Anne Frank I've ever watched.Ben Kingsley is very credible as Otto Frank, the stoic WW I German veteran who is initially optimistic that the war will soon end. His intense bond and love for Anne is very real in this movie, as is his portrayal of a protective family man who is determined to keep his family together, no matter what. Hannah Taylor-Gordon plays Anne Frank, and her resemblance to the real-life Anne is quite uncanny. Her portrayal of Anne is simply amazing - strong-willed, impetuous, candid, ambitious, and yet, underlying all that fierceness of spirit is a young girl on the brink of womanhood who yearns to be thought of as a woman and not a girl, and longs for freedom and love. When I read ""Diary of a Young Girl"", I always had a picture of Anne in my mind and thought that Hannah Taylor Gordon played the role flawlessly.The supporting cast is also well-played - Tatjana Blacher plays the role of Edith Frank , the unassuming mother who has an abrasive relationship with Anne[ who feels her mother doesn't understand her] yet loves her daughters very much. The loud and aggressive Auguste Van Pels is played to perfection by Brenda Blethyn and her husband, Hermann is credibly portrayed by Joachim Krol. Jessica Manley plays Margot Frank with a quiet calmness that is tinged with sensitivity.The ""Righteous Gentiles"", those who helped Anne and her family throughout their hiding are well-portrayed as well, especially Lili Taylor as the courageous and devoted Miep Gies.The narration of the story flows smoothly from Anne's joyful childhood at the beginning of the movie to the fearful period when the Nazis invade and later start their persecution of the Dutch Jews to the awkwardness of the people in hiding [all the tensions between individuals who are forced to live in close quarters], and finally to their betrayal, arrest and deportation. The scenes in the camp are horrific [caution: there are scenes of female nudity] and the squalor in which Anne, Margot and Edith find themselves after being deported to Auschwitz [from the transit camp Westerbork] is terrible to watch. Margot and Anne are later transported to Bergen-Belsen, where conditions are inhuman - starvation is never ceasing, diseases are rampant and hope is dim.What stayed with me at the end of the movie was the final dialogue between Anne and Margot, where they struggle to remember their hopes and dreams that they once had, trying to imagine a life after the war and how those hopes would remain unfulfilled. It is a tragic testament to all those innocent lives that were lost during the Holocaust - the stolen childhoods, the lost innocence, dashed dreams and of the 1.5 million children who were silenced forever.This interactive DVD is meant for classroom use (and for homeschoolers) - it includes the movie, a printable educator's guide, as well as archival footage of other diaries written during the Holocaust period.",5,A must-have film and class resource for educators,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,4007,"['Anne', 'Frank', 'Whole', 'Story', 'well-acted', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'movie', 'based', 'Melissa', 'Muller', 'biography', 'Anne', 'Frank.It', 'basically', 'how', 'Frank', 'family', 'comprising', 'father', 'Otto', 'mother', 'Edith', 'daughters', 'Margot', 'Anne', 'chose', 'go', 'hiding', 'Amsterdam', 'Nazis', 'stepped', 'up', 'persecution', 'Jews', '[', 'Margot', 'got', 'summons', 'deportation', ']', '.Their', 'hiding', 'place', 'secret', 'annex', 'located', 'factory', 'run', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'Franks', 'trusted', 'Gentile', 'friends', 'help', 'soon', 'hiding', 'place', 'opened', 'accommodate', 'Van', 'Pels', '[', 'husband', 'wife', 'teen', 'son', 'Peter', ']', 'dentist', 'Mr', 'Pfeffer', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'spend', '2', 'yrs', 'hiding', 'July', '1942', 'till', 'Aug', '1944', '[', 'when', 'were', 'betrayed', ']', '.This', 'was', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'Anne', 'story', '[', 'having', 'read', 'Diary', 'Young', 'Girl', 'more', 'two', 'decades', ']', 'knew', 'what', 'happened', 'Anne', 'family', 'rest', 'hidden', 'Jews', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'great', 'attention', 'period', 'details', 'excellent', 'casting', 'choices', 'made', 'best', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Frank', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'very', 'credible', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'stoic', 'WW', 'German', 'veteran', 'who', 'initially', 'optimistic', 'war', 'will', 'soon', 'end', 'intense', 'bond', 'love', 'Anne', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'protective', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'determined', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'matter', 'what', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'plays', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'resemblance', 'real-life', 'Anne', 'quite', 'uncanny', 'portrayal', 'Anne', 'simply', 'amazing', 'strong-willed', 'impetuous', 'candid', 'ambitious', 'yet', 'underlying', 'fierceness', 'spirit', 'young', 'girl', 'brink', 'womanhood', 'who', 'be', 'thought', 'woman', 'not', 'girl', 'longs', 'freedom', 'love', 'When', 'read', 'Diary', 'Young', 'Girl', 'always', 'had', 'picture', 'Anne', 'mind', 'thought', 'Hannah', 'Taylor', 'Gordon', 'played', 'role', 'flawlessly.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'well-played', 'Tatjana', 'Blacher', 'role', 'Edith', 'Frank', 'unassuming', 'mother', 'who', 'abrasive', 'relationship', 'Anne', '[', 'who', 'mother', ""n't"", 'understand', ']', 'yet', 'daughters', 'very', 'much', 'loud', 'aggressive', 'Auguste', 'Van', 'Pels', 'played', 'perfection', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'husband', 'Hermann', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Joachim', 'Krol', 'Jessica', 'Manley', 'Margot', 'Frank', 'quiet', 'calmness', 'tinged', 'sensitivity.The', 'Righteous', 'Gentiles', 'who', 'helped', 'Anne', 'family', 'hiding', 'are', 'well-portrayed', 'well', 'especially', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'courageous', 'devoted', 'Miep', 'Gies.The', 'narration', 'story', 'smoothly', 'Anne', 'joyful', 'childhood', 'beginning', 'movie', 'fearful', 'period', 'when', 'Nazis', 'invade', 'later', 'start', 'persecution', 'Dutch', 'Jews', 'awkwardness', 'people', 'hiding', '[', 'tensions', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'close', 'quarters', ']', 'finally', 'betrayal', 'arrest', 'deportation', 'scenes', 'camp', 'are', 'horrific', '[', 'caution', 'are', 'scenes', 'female', 'nudity', ']', 'squalor', 'Anne', 'Margot', 'Edith', 'find', 'being', 'deported', 'Auschwitz', '[', 'transit', 'camp', 'Westerbork', ']', 'terrible', 'watch', 'Margot', 'Anne', 'are', 'later', 'transported', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'where', 'conditions', 'are', 'inhuman', 'starvation', 'never', 'ceasing', 'diseases', 'are', 'rampant', 'hope', 'dim.What', 'stayed', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'final', 'dialogue', 'Anne', 'Margot', 'where', 'struggle', 'remember', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'once', 'had', 'trying', 'imagine', 'life', 'war', 'how', 'hopes', 'would', 'remain', 'unfulfilled', 'tragic', 'testament', 'innocent', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'Holocaust', 'stolen', 'childhoods', 'lost', 'innocence', 'dashed', 'dreams', '1.5', 'million', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'silenced', 'forever.This', 'interactive', 'DVD', 'meant', 'classroom', 'use', 'homeschoolers', 'movie', 'printable', 'educator', 'guide', 'as', 'well', 'archival', 'footage', 'other', 'diaries', 'written', 'Holocaust', 'period']",N/A
