Well, somewhat easy to figure, it was released to the general public in movie theatres by the De Laurentis Entertainment Group not to cable as were the other two epic novels, SHOGUN and NOBLE HOUSE. Most audiences, therefore, cannot, would not, want to set through several hours of viewing in a movie theatre.This magnificent epic novel of Hong Kong was only equaled or bettered by NOBLE HOUSE, a follow up book which carried the TAI-PAN story forward to a contemporary setting and ending.  With the action taking place on both land and sea, TAI-PAN is a dazzling read, but limited in span as only a couple hour motion picture. Main problem: it is very much abridged, not as Clavell wrote it, and it leaves out much of the story, thereby becoming disjointed in its limited telling.So it's a bit of good and bad: Good that the DVD is now available, but less 'good' because of its brevity.

Imagine ""Roots"", ""The Thorn Birds"" (which incidentally has Bryan Brown in it), or ""North & South"" condensed into two hours!  It just wouldn't work!

The result is characters who we should seriously care about....but don't, situations that we should be familiar with....but aren't.

Add to this, lots of sexual depravity depicted in the film's characters (including the protagonists, people we should root for!) & what have you got?

Buffington,"[0, 0]","""Tai-Pan"" probably should have been a miniseries, given the complex, multifaceted nature of the James Clavell novel from which it derives.  No matter, this film, while falling far short of telling the whole story contained in the book, still succeeds in being good entertainment.  And it does manage to tell the broad strokes of Clavell's story -- the founding of Hong Kong and the bitter rivalry of the great British merchant houses that led to its establishment.The casting in this film is unusually good, and the characterizations of the main players, Dirk Struan, Tyler Brock, their sons, May-May, are all very true to the book.  In fact, even if the storyline is forced by the two-hour format to outrageously condense the novel's storyline, the characters are captured with extreme fidelity.

394941,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6304004540,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Some films take so long to get made that by the time they finally reach the screen, the audience has completely lost interest or, in the case of Tai-Pan, quite possibly died of old age. MGM and director Michael Anderson had originally intended to bring James Clavell's epic saga to the screen in 1969 before their operating losses and a massive downturn in moviegoing that hit the whole industry hard led to the picture being postponed indefinitely. In the late 70s Steve McQueen signed up for the lead for a record $10m salary but when the producers were unable to come up with a second payment walked away with the $1m advance they'd paid him. In 1980 Roger Moore was lined up to replace him and even started growing a beard for the part only for that proposed version to sink without trace until, in the wake of Shogun's success, Dino De Laurentiis finally came up with a script that would satisfy the Chinese authorities (but no-one else) and made it with an almost heroically miscast Bryan Brown and Joan Chen in 1986. He shouldn't have bothered: it's awful. Not just ordinary awful but really irredeemably bloody awful, a real pig's ear of a picture that could and should have been much better, especially for an epic saga about the founding of Hong Kong and the trading dynasty that Clavell would return to in Noble House that's just crying out for the kind of unashamedly old fashioned epic screen treatment that the film's much more impressive poster seemed to promise. It's no surprise this unseaworthy vessel was such a massive flop (limping to only $4m on a $25m budget in the US) that it went straight to video in most countries and barely shifted any copies there either.The constant censorship changes the Chinese government insisted on to allow filming (it was the first US picture to shoot there) and the nightmarish amount of red tape during the shoot didn't help, nor did heavy pre-release cutting (De Laurentiis also prepared a longer TV miniseries version that never seems to have seen the light of day), but John Briley and Stanley Mann's script is such a dreary and truncated mess that makes so little sense to anyone who hasn't read the novel that it's no great surprise that veteran TV director Daryl Duke couldn't inject any life into it. There's no excuse for the truly awful performances, though, with both Bryan Brown and Joan Chen sporting atrocious Groundskeeper Willie Scottish accents that make it impossible to keep a straight face when our hero utters lines like ""Tha Emparah ov Chynner haz nivva scene tha guns ov a Britisshhh man o'wurr!"" or ""Whun yew mekke dung ye'll whype yer ahhhssse wiv paypah"" while her romantic scenes, delivered in the pidgin-Scottish learned from her lover, become pure comedy. Even the Russian ambassador's accent hails not from Georgia, Russia, but Georgia, USA for some bizarre reason, making you wonder if the whole thing is a failed sendup.The first quarter of an hour or so isn't too bad, but it doesn't take long for the colony of Hong Kong to be established and from then on it's just tiresome business rivalry between Brown and John Stanton's hammy mellerdrammer villain with the usual romantic complications as their children fall in love, none of which plays remotely convincingly or above the level of a cheap daytime soap opera. Even the climax during a typhoon that sees the two antagonists finally having their much-delayed fight to the death doesn't liven things up so flatly are the proceedings staged: you just get the feeling that everyone just wants to get through it all as quickly as they can so they can go home and forget about it, which at least puts them on the same plain as the audience.Amazingly even the great Jack Cardiff's scope photography (cropped to fullframe on the PAL DVD releases) doesn't add much color or grandeur to proceedings after the opening sequences in China, with much of the film looking like a flat TV show that someone accidentally shot in widescreen, so Maurice Jarre's superb score is doubly welcome. It's something of a tradition that really bad films often have exceptionally good scores, and this is no exception, with Jarre seemingly scoring a much grander and more spectacular film that exists only in his head, even coming up with a gorgeous, unashamedly romantic and sweeping love theme that's one of the finest things he ever wrote. If only the film were worthy of it...While PAL releases are poor fullframe transfers taken from old video masters, the US NTSC DVD from 20th Century Fox has a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer but no
