312661,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6302439493,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","LET'S MAKE IT LEGAL is a brisk (77 mins.) romantic-triangle black-and-white dialog comedy from 1951.  A middle-aged couple (Claudette Colbert, Macdonald Carey) are on the verge of divorce because of his gambling problem when a beau from high-school days (Zachary Scott), who since became a nationally prominent industrialist, shows up to woo Claudette, at which point the Macdonald Carey character redoubles his efforts to win her back.The playing tone is bright and the players give their all.  Although Colbert plays a premature grandmother, she is as warm and witty as ever.  It was fun seeing Carey play a highly comedic role with a distinct physical component, and he certainly seemed to enjoy playing it.  Zachary Scott (whom most moviegoers are more likely to remember as the decadent aristocrat Monte Beragon in 1945's MILDRED PIERCE) is a delightful study in narcissism: watch how the camera catches his unctuous face and bright lying eyes as he goes after his high-school sweetheart from over 20 years ago.  Young contract players Barbara Bates and Robert Wagner play the divorcing couple's daughter and son-in-law who still live with the folks with their new baby, and fall into a war of nerves: she wants her folks to get back together while he is cheering for Scott's character.And Marilyn?  She was still only partway through her build-up phase, between the time she signed her second contract with 20th Century-Fox in 1950 following her brief comic turn in ALL ABOUT EVE, to the full-blown star of NIAGARA and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES in 1953.  As always, she holds the screen whenever she is on it, but her role here is quite brief, probably no more than ten minutes' playing time spread over several scenes.  Her character's most significant action is being forced to dance with Zachary Scott, who promptly rejects her in favor of Claudette Colbert--probably the last time in any movie that Marilyn did not dazzle any male in her path!I struggled between giving this movie three or four stars (I am not deducting for the recent DVD's portrayal of Marilyn on the box as though this were ""her"" movie, which is deceitful from the git-go).  I wavered over to four because the film has a pretty good Commentary by none other than Robert Wagner, and because of the look-fast fun of spotting supporting players who are probably better known from Sixties television:  Frank Cady (""Sam Drucker"" from PETTICOAT JUNCTION and GREEN ACRES) here plays the capable factotum who keeps up with the industrialist's demands, and Kathleen Freeman (Sgt. Vincent Carter's mother on GOMER PYLE, USMC as well as numerous other movie and TV roles) as an insightful newspaper reporter.Trivia Note:  Claudette Colbert and Marilyn Monroe a-l-m-o-s-t crossed paths cinematically the prior year.  Colbert was scheduled to play ""Margo Channing"" in ALL ABOUT EVE but a back injury prevented her accepting the role, which went to Bette Davis.Imdb ratings comparisons:LET'S MAKE IT LEGAL:  -  6.1WE'RE NOT MARRIED:  -  6.4RHUBARB:  -  6.7",4,Let's make it honest -- this is a good comedy but MM's role is peripheral,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3021,"['LET', 'MAKE', 'IT', 'LEGAL', 'brisk', '77', 'mins', 'romantic-triangle', 'black-and-white', 'dialog', 'comedy', '1951', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Macdonald', 'Carey', 'are', 'verge', 'divorce', 'gambling', 'problem', 'when', 'beau', 'high-school', 'days', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'who', 'became', 'nationally', 'prominent', 'industrialist', 'up', 'woo', 'Claudette', 'point', 'Macdonald', 'Carey', 'character', 'efforts', 'win', 'back.The', 'playing', 'tone', 'bright', 'players', 'give', 'Colbert', 'premature', 'grandmother', 'warm', 'witty', 'ever', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Carey', 'play', 'highly', 'comedic', 'role', 'distinct', 'physical', 'component', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'whom', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'remember', 'decadent', 'aristocrat', 'Monte', 'Beragon', '1945', 'MILDRED', 'PIERCE', 'delightful', 'study', 'narcissism', 'watch', 'how', 'camera', 'unctuous', 'face', 'bright', 'lying', 'eyes', 'high-school', 'sweetheart', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Young', 'contract', 'players', 'Barbara', 'Bates', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'play', 'divorcing', 'couple', 'daughter', 'son-in-law', 'who', 'still', 'live', 'folks', 'new', 'baby', 'fall', 'war', 'nerves', 'folks', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'cheering', 'Scott', 'character.And', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'still', 'only', 'partway', 'build-up', 'phase', 'time', 'signed', 'second', 'contract', '20th', 'Century-Fox', '1950', 'following', 'brief', 'comic', 'turn', 'ABOUT', 'EVE', 'full-blown', 'star', 'NIAGARA', 'GENTLEMEN', 'PREFER', 'BLONDES', '1953', 'always', 'screen', 'whenever', 'role', 'here', 'quite', 'brief', 'probably', 'more', 'ten', 'minutes', 'playing', 'time', 'spread', 'several', 'scenes', 'character', 'most', 'significant', 'action', 'being', 'forced', 'dance', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'who', 'promptly', 'favor', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'probably', 'last', 'time', 'movie', 'Marilyn', 'did', 'not', 'dazzle', 'male', 'path', 'struggled', 'giving', 'movie', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'am', 'not', 'deducting', 'recent', 'DVD', 'portrayal', 'Marilyn', 'box', 'were', 'movie', 'deceitful', 'git-go', 'wavered', 'four', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'Commentary', 'none', 'other', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'look-fast', 'fun', 'spotting', 'supporting', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'known', 'Sixties', 'television', 'Frank', 'Cady', 'Sam', 'Drucker', 'PETTICOAT', 'JUNCTION', 'GREEN', 'ACRES', 'here', 'capable', 'factotum', 'who', 'up', 'industrialist', 'demands', 'Kathleen', 'Freeman', 'Sgt', 'Vincent', 'Carter', 'mother', 'GOMER', 'PYLE', 'USMC', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'other', 'movie', 'TV', 'roles', 'insightful', 'newspaper', 'reporter.Trivia', 'Note', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'a-l-m-o-s-t', 'crossed', 'paths', 'cinematically', 'prior', 'year', 'Colbert', 'was', 'scheduled', 'play', 'Margo', 'Channing', 'ABOUT', 'EVE', 'back', 'injury', 'prevented', 'accepting', 'role', 'went', 'Bette', 'Davis.Imdb', 'ratings', 'comparisons', 'LET', 'MAKE', 'IT', 'LEGAL', '6.1WE', ""'RE"", 'NOT', 'MARRIED', '6.4RHUBARB', '6.7']",N/A

We must keep things in perspective though although she plays a minor role,this deluxe edition,greatly rendered and finely digitized we would not have in such great quality without her presence in the film small as it is. The film is really one of perceptions,whoose eyes you look through determines what you see it is subjective rather than objective. The film begins with the soon to be divorced husband,unceremoniously dumped,talking of his plants being killed in cold blood..throughout this film the image of husband as nurturer,bringing things to fertility,guardianship and god like qualities occurs. we also have the daughter,who is soon to be married and largely under the tutelage and control of the mother,who seems to pander to her whims. The mother is knows as someone whom time and tide(which was a feminist magazine)has gone through,and remodeled her. It seems to have effected how she relates to and branches out to those around her,including her amour from 20 years pastwho resurfaces the senator from washington. We now have the housewife involved in a triangle of sorts with the clean cut husband whom she exposes as cruel,who her daughter finds something wrong with,and the senator who has come to take this woman who has eluded him,to reclaim her,since he allows nothing to escape? The father is also known as someone who looks on life with sad eyes,and talks of mutual friends(Our mutual friend was a dickens novel)and at first she decides not to marry this man from 20 years ago,not out of deference to husband or children bas as it might cramp her freedom...her husband dislikes this old/new amour,complaining of her tirades against his gambling,her mind seems fixated on it..""one track""...the movie moves along in this vein and eventually the marriage is aborted and she takes a new look at her husband and there's a subplot at his winning her by the roll of dice,but shouldnt she be more concerned of love than silly idea like being won in that way,but hers is a mind which is one track?Diamond cowrites interesting screenplay and to understand it properly good to have understanding of shakespearean motifs of love and redemption,and how the senator really puts a crimp in the community in all waysin resurrecting his 20 year relationship,also to the police intrusion at story's end for some unexplained reason,he seems like someone who uses his powers to hem in and contain elements of city he dislikes,...and develops negative attitudes towards his lovers old attachments...and the party scene at the house puts him in disfavourable light. Marilyn looks good and desirable in film and in the few scenes shows why better stuff was soon to showcaseher talents in a more detailed way and we thank her for her little part allows us to see the film in such a quality format...robert wagner gives very good audio commentary,and although the studio chief were thought as a negative element in their fiefedom's,he gives a positive view of Zanuck and what he brought to hollywood..he actually sees what was a good element in these old czars the ability to greenlight so much production and stars and talent and after the studios passed under the ownership of toy companies among others this oversight was lost...they say production at hollywood studios is down once again...very good shakespeare/dickens/freud lens to llok at life not to mention the word 'haunting' used of the father and his impressions on the other characters",3,i.a.l. diamond drama on marriages and community life,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,3695,"['must', 'commend', 'robert', 'wagner', 'commentary', 'film', 'darryl', 'Zanuck', 'influence', '20th', 'film', 'talk', 'studio', 'system', 'tales', 'claudette', 'colbert', 'spencer', 'tracy', 'james', 'cagney', 'john', 'ford', 'bit', 'marilyn', 'must', 'keep', 'things', 'perspective', 'minor', 'role', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'greatly', 'rendered', 'finely', 'digitized', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'quality', 'presence', 'film', 'small', 'film', 'really', 'one', 'perceptions', 'whoose', 'eyes', 'look', 'determines', 'what', 'see', 'subjective', 'rather', 'objective', 'film', 'soon', 'be', 'divorced', 'husband', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'talking', 'plants', 'being', 'killed', 'cold', 'blood..throughout', 'film', 'image', 'husband', 'nurturer', 'bringing', 'things', 'fertility', 'guardianship', 'god', 'qualities', 'occurs', 'also', 'have', 'daughter', 'who', 'soon', 'be', 'married', 'largely', 'tutelage', 'control', 'mother', 'who', 'pander', 'whims', 'mother', 'someone', 'whom', 'time', 'tide', 'was', 'feminist', 'magazine', 'gone', 'remodeled', 'have', 'effected', 'how', 'branches', 'out', 'including', 'amour', '20', 'years', 'pastwho', 'senator', 'washington', 'now', 'have', 'housewife', 'involved', 'triangle', 'sorts', 'clean', 'cut', 'husband', 'whom', 'cruel', 'who', 'daughter', 'something', 'wrong', 'senator', 'who', 'come', 'take', 'woman', 'who', 'eluded', 'reclaim', 'nothing', 'escape', 'father', 'also', 'known', 'someone', 'who', 'life', 'sad', 'eyes', 'talks', 'mutual', 'friends', 'mutual', 'friend', 'was', 'dickens', 'novel', 'first', 'not', 'marry', 'man', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'deference', 'husband', 'children', 'might', 'cramp', 'freedom', 'husband', 'old/new', 'amour', 'complaining', 'tirades', 'gambling', 'mind', 'fixated', 'it..', 'one', 'track', 'movie', 'along', 'vein', 'eventually', 'marriage', 'aborted', 'new', 'look', 'husband', 'subplot', 'winning', 'roll', 'dice', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'love', 'silly', 'idea', 'being', 'won', 'way', 'hers', 'mind', 'one', 'track', 'Diamond', 'interesting', 'screenplay', 'understand', 'properly', 'good', 'have', 'understanding', 'shakespearean', 'motifs', 'love', 'redemption', 'how', 'senator', 'really', 'crimp', 'community', 'waysin', 'resurrecting', '20', 'year', 'relationship', 'also', 'police', 'intrusion', 'story', 'end', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'someone', 'who', 'powers', 'hem', 'contain', 'elements', 'city', 'negative', 'attitudes', 'lovers', 'old', 'attachments', 'party', 'scene', 'house', 'disfavourable', 'light', 'Marilyn', 'good', 'desirable', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'why', 'better', 'stuff', 'was', 'soon', 'showcaseher', 'talents', 'more', 'detailed', 'way', 'thank', 'little', 'part', 'see', 'film', 'quality', 'format', 'robert', 'wagner', 'very', 'good', 'audio', 'commentary', 'studio', 'chief', 'were', 'thought', 'negative', 'element', 'fiefedom', 'positive', 'view', 'Zanuck', 'what', 'brought', 'hollywood..he', 'actually', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'element', 'old', 'ability', 'greenlight', 'so', 'much', 'production', 'stars', 'talent', 'studios', 'passed', 'ownership', 'toy', 'companies', 'others', 'oversight', 'was', 'lost', 'say', 'production', 'hollywood', 'studios', 'down', 'once', 'again', 'very', 'good', 'shakespeare/dickens/freud', 'lens', 'llok', 'life', 'not', 'mention', 'word', ""'haunting"", 'used', 'father', 'impressions', 'other', 'characters']",N/A

The black and white picture genuinely sparkles. Blacks are solid, the gray scale is perfectly balanced and age related artifacts are, for the most part, nonexistent. Minor edge enhancement and some video noise (particularly in plaid patterns) crop up now and then but truthfully, this is a superb looking transfer. The audio has been re-channeled to two stem stereo with predictable limited range. Nevertheless the soundtrack is smooth.EXTRAS: Come on, what did you expect for a film of this limited appeal.

The wife (Claudette Colbert) has decided that she has had enough of her husband's (MacDonald Carey) gambling and calls it quits. It is obvious that he still loves her and their grown daughter (Barbara Bates) does all she can to fix them up again. However, an old flame (Zachary Scott), now a well-known political figure, comes into town and practically sweeps the newly single wife off her feet, creating a stir in the family.Although this film has been entered into the Marilyn Monroe collection and features her photo on the cover, this is one of her early roles and therefore she is hardly in the film. Her part is as a client of Carey. She performs the way a new actress would, slightly forced but undeniably sexily.The real star of this film is Claudette Colbert, obviously older than she was in her prime but still quite beautiful. She plays her part confidently as the epitome of a desirable woman who takes care of her family with ease and still has time to do the things that make her happy.Zachary Scott is attractive and somewhat reminiscent of Clark Gable, a co-star of Colbert's in several films. However, he does not have the same chemistry with her that Gable did.MacDonald Carey, however, does. Even in the few scenes in which his character gets along with his former wife, sparks fly.Barbara Bates is very beautiful as the daughter of the separated pair. She plays her part sympathetically as the new adult who cannot do anything for herself. She is appropriately childlike.Overall, this film is better than one might expect.

Colbert stars as a woman who is in the process of divorcing her gambling obsessed husband Macdonald Carey while their daughter Barbara Bates and son-in-law Robert Wagner live in her home. Barbara is determined to reunite her parents while Robert just wants his wife to move on and have a new independent life with him. Adding additional trouble to the brew is Claudette's old flame Zachary Scott, now a multi-millionaire and famous political insider, who is anxious to rekindle their old romance now that Claudette is available again. Marilyn Monroe is featured in a small part as a gold-digger who'd like Scott for herself.There aren't many laughs in this ""comedy"" but Claudette is always worth watching and she is a vision in two very beautiful gowns here that show off her ageless figure to full advantage. Marilyn, 23 years her junior, had a right to be worried! It's fun to see lovely young MM quite early in her career but she's about the film's only other highlight. Neither Carey or Scott are particularly charismatic leading men or ones with a flair for comedy. Robert Wagner, 21, is boyishly handsome but has little ability at this point to speak his lines with any sincerity; Barbara Bates is somewhat better although her character is not particularly sympathetic. The baby girl is adorable though and it's fun to see familiar TV faces Kathleen Freeman and Frank Cady in small roles. A young Roger Moore reportedly has a bit in this but is tough to spot.Shame on Fox though for marketing this as a MM movie when it's an early small role for her.  I don't have a problem with them putting Marilyn on the cover but the legendary Ms. Colbert absolutely should have been on it as well (the old VHS release had a wonderful cover of Claudette, Marilyn, MacDonald, and Zachary).

If you like the old classic romantic comedies, you'll love Claudette Colbert and Macdonald Carey in this one.  See a young Robert Wagner too.  It's just a well made adventure while a married couple works out whether to stay together....  and an old beau has his own ideas.  It flows well and has some great touches.  Marilyn Monroe actually talks as a regular human being in this film which is great.  Grab some buttered popcorn and a root beer and enjoy this one.  :0)",5,This film is so much fun!
