870601,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0006JMLPM,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","One movie that was so unfairly maligned and bashed to the extreme this year was this harmless little holiday flick. Are those criticisms justified?. No. The movie was basically treated like it was one of the worst pieces of grade F- things put to film. Is it?. Far from it. Maybe it was because it's just so easy to write off everything Ben Affleck does because he's...well, because he's Ben Affleck. Or maybe the terrible box office just made it that much easier to put it up as a target. Whatever the reason, it was unjustly reviewed and treated. That being said, I am not about to praise the movie either. It's just pretty...okay. It's tolerable, even enjoyable, just nothing special. A harmless piece of fluff that will be instantly forgotten the second the credits roll, but is a painless excursion in a decent little holiday film that is just trying to be nice and festive. And that it is. Ben Affleck is pretty well cast as Drew Latham, a successful businessman who seems to have everything. Once his well to do girlfriend informs him that Christmas is time for family, Drew realizes he doesn't have family and sets out to rectify it. With the help of a psychiatrist(Stephen Root, in an all too short role), Drew sets out to go to his childhood home to rid himself of his grievances. Once there, Drew realizes he wants to stay with the family. Gruff, bearded dad Tom(the great James Gandolfini), the strained and haggard wife Christine(the always great Catherine 'O' Hara), and cyber-porn addicted son Brian(Josh Zuckerman). He offers the family $250,000 to let him stay for the holidays and pose as his family. Little did he know that they had a daughter named Alicia(the beautiful Christina Applegate), and little more did he know that he would fall in, well, you already know. The movie offers no surprises and you can see everything coming a mile away. But that doesn't always necessarily matter. The movie does make up for it's by the numbers vanilla formula by offering some few funny moments, some sweet moments, and a nice cast. Affleck does his best for his first real comedic role, and for the most part he succeeds. He is obnoxiously charming and funny. Applegate is still a beauty and knows her way around comedy. She certainly holds, as always, her own. The real solid support for this film was Gandolfini and 'O' Hara. They are pros. Especially the always reliable 'O' Hara, who is comedy gold. From her work with SCTV to her movies with Christopher Guest and others, she always deliver. These two make the movie better than it is and really give it it's center. The movie does have a little darker comedic edge to it, while at the same time dives directly into sickly sweet comedy and romance. All in all, the movie is not that bad at all. It was definitley the target of unecessary scorn, most of which it didn't deserve.

870605,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B0006JMLPM,Brett Corkins,"[2, 2]","Granted this isn't the funniest movie you'll ever see it's still got its shining moments. I admit about halfway through the movie it gets a bit slow and tends to drag but there's always a few laughs along the way, albeit minimal ones. At the heart of this film is a movie trying to be all it can be, but there are actors that were cast that really had no business being in a comedy(James Gandolfini is one). Ben Affleck has proven that he's at least competent doing comedy (take his short appearance in Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back) and so has Christina Applegate (Married...With Children). Neither one of these two have made good choices in movies recently but I think when you put the two together they shine. And they do, at first. Once they get romantic the film really loses traction though.Basically the story is that Drew (Affleck) wants to pay off a family living in his old childhood house to act as his parents during the holidays since he didn't have much of a childhood. Not the best premise ever thought up but it there's room for laughs along the way. Tom (Gandolfini) and Christine (O'Hara) are on the verge of divorce when Drew comes into their lives. Their son, Brian (Zuckerman), doesn't have a clue about it, nor does their daughter, Alicia (Applegate). Somehow, during the course of virtually ruining these poor people's lives, Drew gets them to open up to him, and even strikes up a friendship or two.The casting, minus a few flaws, was pretty good. I thought Ben did a good job throughout and Christina, although not up to par with Married..., also did a decent job. But the two who did the best jobs were Catherine O'Hara and Josh Zuckerman, the mother and son duo. O'Hara plays the troubled mother perfectly and I can't think of anyone who could play a horny teen just discovering internet porn better than Zuckerman. And the incident he has with porn at the end of the movie was pure hilarity. Overall this movie isn't as bad as people are making it to be. No, this doesn't have the strongest script. No, this doesn't have the best acting. No, this isn't the funniest movie ever released. But nobody ever said Surviving Christmas had those qualities. Watch this with an open mind, don't expect to see the greatest movie ever made, just sit back and be entertained.

This movie provide a valuable lesson if you're a rich, selfish, pompous moron and you haven't a family to celebrate the holidays, instead of going to leisurely parties day after day, why not just buy a family?  That's what Ben Affleck did when he felt like going back to his old roots, when he interrupted a family who lived in his old house.  He paid the father, Tony Soprano, a quarter of a million dollars to make this family his own until the end of Christmas, and thus under contract the family lost all of their liberties to cater to a selfish millionaire's holiday fantasy, with a paid actor as their 'Pop-Pop'.Being a cynic that I am, I wanted to love this kind of premise, but the movie is so damaging, it's irreparable.  This movie is too depressing, downtrodden, and mean to be a serviceable film for the holidays.  There's no humor to be found here, neither is anything wholesome; even a film as vulgar as ""Bad Santa"" has a few wholesome values in itself (not to mention laughs). The cast don't have any comedic timing, nor do they have any comedy at all, and they're basically playing themselves or playing popular characters they're known for (which is why I didn't bother to know their charaters' names).  All of their pessimistic, contemptuous attitudes didn't work for hilarious irony's sake, they're just pessimistic and I felt bad for them.  The message of the whole movie is just wrong: the family are using money to make themselves happy, and they're willing to sell themselves if it pays well.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[29, 39]","If I see one more Christmas movie with cynical cheer and forced holiday warmth, I'm going to buy a camel and follow stars to the Middle-East. (And it's not even Halloween!) ""Surviving Christmas"" is the latest of this ghastly genre, a tepid feel-good movie with little heart and no soul.Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is a coldhearted exec, with too much money and a newly single status. But he decides to go home for the holidays and reexperience some holiday cheer -- only to have the house's owner (James Gandolfini) come out and whomp him with a shovel. It turns out that the house is now owned by a different family, the Valcos.Undeterred, Drew decides to ""rent"" the dysfunctional Valco family and have the Normal Rockwell Christmas of his dreams. To the tune of a quarter-million bucks, the Valcos agree to let their home and family serve his every holiday whim -- no matter how insane or bizarre.Admittedly, it does get funny at times -- the idea of a spoiled man-child inflicting his Christmas fantasies on an ordinary family is an amusing one. Not to mention the idea of them slowly being driven crazy by said fantasies -- quarter-million or no quarter-million. And that kernel of comic potential is what saves ""Surviving Christmas"" from being a total disaster. It's a disaster, but not a total one.But many of the comedy scenarios are very forced; no one in this movie has a single reason to do what they do. The script can't keep itself contained for more than a few minutes before more holiday hijinks spill out like broken ornaments. Not to mention the abundance of Christmas sappiness, and a tepid romance. In a word, the whole thing is monumentally stupid, and stuffed with cliches like a tiny turkey with too much stuffing.The cast makes Ben Affleck has rarely been more unappealing than he is here -- his sharp grin and stiff acting may frighten small children. Applegate flounders unhappily as the token love interest, since her character has no motivation and no chemitry. The rest of the cats is talented but unconnected: Gandolfini is fun but shallow, and always-wonderful Catherine O'Hara does as good a job as she can, but the poor woman is drowning in a sea of sour treacle.""Surviving Christmas"" will only make you want to survive the two hours before this brain-dead excuse for a comedy is over, and you can put on those Charlie Brown Christmas specials.",1,Just try to survive,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2373,"['see', 'one', 'more', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'cynical', 'cheer', 'forced', 'holiday', 'warmth', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'camel', 'follow', 'stars', 'Middle-East', 'not', 'even', 'Halloween', 'Surviving', 'Christmas', 'latest', 'ghastly', 'tepid', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'little', 'heart', 'soul.Drew', 'Latham', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'coldhearted', 'exec', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'newly', 'single', 'status', 'go', 'home', 'holidays', 'reexperience', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'only', 'have', 'house', 'owner', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'come', 'out', 'whomp', 'shovel', 'out', 'house', 'now', 'owned', 'different', 'family', 'Valcos.Undeterred', 'Drew', 'rent', 'dysfunctional', 'Valco', 'family', 'have', 'Normal', 'Rockwell', 'Christmas', 'dreams', 'tune', 'quarter-million', 'bucks', 'Valcos', 'agree', 'let', 'home', 'family', 'serve', 'holiday', 'whim', 'matter', 'how', 'insane', 'bizarre.Admittedly', 'get', 'funny', 'times', 'idea', 'spoiled', 'man-child', 'inflicting', 'Christmas', 'fantasies', 'ordinary', 'family', 'amusing', 'one', 'Not', 'mention', 'idea', 'slowly', 'being', 'driven', 'crazy', 'said', 'fantasies', 'quarter-million', 'quarter-million', 'kernel', 'comic', 'potential', 'what', 'Surviving', 'Christmas', 'being', 'total', 'disaster', 'disaster', 'not', 'total', 'one.But', 'many', 'comedy', 'scenarios', 'are', 'very', 'forced', 'one', 'movie', 'single', 'reason', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'contained', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'more', 'holiday', 'hijinks', 'spill', 'out', 'broken', 'ornaments', 'Not', 'mention', 'abundance', 'Christmas', 'sappiness', 'tepid', 'romance', 'word', 'whole', 'thing', 'monumentally', 'stupid', 'stuffed', 'cliches', 'tiny', 'turkey', 'too', 'much', 'stuffing.The', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'rarely', 'been', 'more', 'unappealing', 'here', 'sharp', 'grin', 'stiff', 'acting', 'may', 'frighten', 'small', 'children', 'Applegate', 'flounders', 'unhappily', 'token', 'love', 'interest', 'character', 'motivation', 'chemitry', 'rest', 'cats', 'talented', 'unconnected', 'Gandolfini', 'fun', 'shallow', 'always-wonderful', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'as', 'good', 'job', 'can', 'poor', 'woman', 'drowning', 'sea', 'sour', 'treacle', 'Surviving', 'Christmas', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'want', 'survive', 'two', 'hours', 'brain-dead', 'excuse', 'comedy', 'can', 'put', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'specials']",N/A
870618,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0006JMLPM,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 4]","I have to admit I laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie, but it's already moving out of my short-term memory. In a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity, Ben Affleck, once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the Hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man. Judging from this film, the transformation doesn't seem to be taking, as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts. While his buddy Matt Damon takes on smart roles in films like ""Syriana"", Affleck appears in this type of commercial pap. At least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive Drew Latham suits Affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried.Directed by Mike Mitchell (whose most famous film is 1999's ""Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo"") and scripted by no less than four screenwriters (always a bad sign), the flimsy plot revolves around his character's need to ""rent"" a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old-fashioned Christmas he never had. The concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays. The real problem, however, is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance. Affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable, but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill-conceived films. Fortunately, he has the likes of James Gandofini and Catherine O'Hara playing the Valcos, the couple who decide to accept Drew's monetary offer to pretend to be his parents.Gandolfini plays Tom like a gruff, non-violent relative of Tony Soprano, but he does what he can in the role. From her classic SCTV Days to Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, O'Hara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle, and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as Tom's wife Christine, whether dryly delivering a one-liner or posing in an inch of make-up for a dominatrix photo shoot. In what is becoming her standard screen role, Christina Applegate plays their mistrusting daughter Alicia, who of course becomes Drew's love interest. Despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing Drew's sister in front of his girlfriend's family, her character seems to change in lightning-flash strokes making it hard to see what Drew would see in her. The story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order. It's rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script. It shows, but I also have to admit I stuck with it to the bitter end.",2,A Desperate Affleck Motors Through Illogical Holiday Vehicle With a Smattering of Laughs,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,2949,"['have', 'admit', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'trivial', '2004', 'holiday', 'movie', 'already', 'moving', 'short-term', 'memory', 'career', 'sliding', 'rather', 'swiftly', 'tabloid', 'obscurity', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'once', 'promising', 'comic', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'became', 'enmeshed', 'Hollywood', 'publicity', 'machine', 'recreate', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'Judging', 'film', 'transformation', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'taking', 'lack', 'gravitas', 'would', 'make', 'credible', 'such', 'parts', 'buddy', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'smart', 'roles', 'films', 'Syriana', 'Affleck', 'type', 'commercial', 'pap', 'least', 'superficial', 'character', 'successful', 'lonely', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Drew', 'Latham', 'suits', 'Affleck', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'roles', 'tried.Directed', 'Mike', 'Mitchell', 'most', 'famous', 'film', '1999', 'Deuce', 'Bigelow', 'Male', 'Gigolo', 'scripted', 'less', 'four', 'screenwriters', 'always', 'bad', 'sign', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'character', 'need', 'rent', 'family', 'living', 'childhood', 'home', 'order', 'live', 'out', 'fantasy', 'having', 'old-fashioned', 'Christmas', 'never', 'had', 'concept', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'cathartic', 'release', 'sentimentality', 'are', 'directed', 'feel', 'frenzied', 'commercialism', 'holidays', 'real', 'problem', 'however', 'movie', 'feels', 'extended', 'sketch', 'lacking', 'logic', 'authentic', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'Affleck', 'be', 'overdrive', 'attempting', 'desperately', 'be', 'lovable', 'net', 'result', 'exhausting', 'turn', 'actor', 'who', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'habit', 'playing', 'stupid', 'people', 'ill-conceived', 'films', 'Fortunately', 'likes', 'James', 'Gandofini', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'playing', 'Valcos', 'couple', 'who', 'decide', 'accept', 'Drew', 'monetary', 'offer', 'pretend', 'be', 'parents.Gandolfini', 'Tom', 'gruff', 'non-violent', 'relative', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'classic', 'SCTV', 'Days', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', ""O'Hara"", 'always', 'comic', 'gem', 'matter', 'vehicle', 'unsurprisingly', 'best', 'laughs', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Christine', 'dryly', 'delivering', 'one-liner', 'posing', 'inch', 'make-up', 'dominatrix', 'photo', 'shoot', 'what', 'becoming', 'standard', 'screen', 'role', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'mistrusting', 'daughter', 'Alicia', 'who', 'course', 'Drew', 'love', 'interest', 'good', 'moments', 'where', 'enjoying', 'deceit', 'playing', 'Drew', 'sister', 'front', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'character', 'change', 'lightning-flash', 'strokes', 'making', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'Drew', 'would', 'see', 'story', 'completely', 'control', 'last', 'third', 'one', 'contrived', 'situation', 'piled', 'top', 'plot', 'strands', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'short', 'order', 'rumored', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'improvised', 'was', 'finished', 'shooting', 'script', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'stuck', 'bitter', 'end']",N/A

870635,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006JMLPM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 8]","Well, ""Surviving Christmas"" made it from the theater to DVD with a speed usually reserved for films trying to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (apparently a record for a ""major"" release).  Dreamworks must be really trying to wash their hands of this one, because certainly if they released it on DVD a month before Christmas instead of a month after the holidays, they would have to make more money (even if people were picking it up as the cinematic equivalent of coal to put in someone's stocking).  We had to wait almost a year for ""Elf"" to come out on DVD, but then there were people who actually wanted to see that movie.  ""Surviving Christmas"" does not inspire that sort of enthusiasm, and while it does not really deserve outright ridicule, it does appear to be another nail in the coffin of Ben Affleck's thespian career.  Remember, this was a Christmas movie that was released before Halloween in another move that smacks of quiet desperation.""Surviving Christmas"" starts off as if it might actually be an edgy, black comedy about the holidays.  Andy Williams sings ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" while we are treated to a montage of holiday suicides, including a grandmother type who bakes gingerbread cookies with frowning mouths before she puts her head in the oven.  Given this rather intriguing introduction, you would reasonably be expecting a story about another potential holiday suicide, but it turns out that introduction has really nothing to do with the rest of the film.  As soon as it is done (and well before the opening credits are over) we are introduced to Drew Latham (Ben Affleck), an advertising executive who is selling a client on the only way for people to endure their families during the holiday.  It is a nice bit for establishing Drew's character, but it also sends the film on a detour that will last under the end credits.When Drew wants to take his girlfriend (Jennifer Morrison) away for Christmas, this turns out to be the final straw in their relationship because she thinks people should spend the holidays with their family.  Left alone, Drew discovers he has no place to go and spend Christmas.  While visiting his childhood home, he comes up with the bright idea of paying the family that lives there $250,000 to pretend to be his family, at which point we know essentially what will happen in the rest of this movie as Drew and the Valcos become a ""real"" family.The Valcos consist of father Tom (James Gandolfini), mother Christine (Catherine O'Hara), son Brian (Josh Zuckerman), and in case you were wondering who was going to be Drew's new girlfriend, daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), who is smarter than the rest of the family put together, but unable to use that to her advantage.  Despite being handsomely paid for this inconvenience, the Valcos tend to resist Drew's demands: wearing a Santa's hat or putting marshmallows in hot chocolate seems a reasonable request for one-tenth the sum they are being paid.  But we have to establish different levels of tension between not only Drew and the Valcos, but between each of the Valcos as well so that Drew can fix them and make them all better and we can have a happy ending where God blesses them, every one.The script bears the primary responsibility for ""Surviving Christmas"" not surviving until Christmas.  The story is by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont, who worked on the screenplay along with Jeffrey Ventimilia and Joshua Sternin.  The former pair turn television sit coms into movies and the latter do television sit coms, which certainly explains why the bar was set low on this one.  Since the script does not take advantage of having Gandolfini and O'Hara in the cast, it is not surprising that they come up with essentially nothing for Applegate (besides one small confession).  By the time we get to this serious moment in this film, it is too little too late.  Yes, it provides some notion of motivation for Drew's character, but if you look back at everything he has done previously in the film it is not justified by the revelation, which makes it no more a coherent part of the narrative than the opening montage.I would still argue that Ben Affleck's best film was ""Chasing Amy"" and would continue to maintain that it was his performance that was the fatal flaw in ""Gigli,"" although the movie has some choice moments.  Given those oppositional poles ""Surviving Christmas"" would be my choice for the worst Ben Affleck movie to date, not so much because it is inherently bad, but more so because it is just such a waste of all of the cast members.  If Drew's demands were more obnoxious or bizarre, then ""Surviving Christmas"" would have been a funnier movie.  Jettisoning the suicide montage at the start would have made more sense, but finding a way to follow up on it would have made for a much better movie.  Unfortunately, director Mike Mitchell (""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo""), could not possibly know better.",2,"Yes, the worst Ben Affleck movie, but it is not his fault",1106265600,"01 21,

870637,A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O,B0006JMLPM,"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot""","[1, 1]","DreamWorks' recent holiday comedy SURVIVING CHRISTMAS is a ripe example of a modest, dare we say 'ordinary', movie.Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is successful as a businessman, but when his girlfriend leaves him because he's not family-oriented, and he rethinks and capitalizes on it (initially unbeknownst to her), we are invited to view a not-so-wonderful dimension of his life: growing up. He takes a cab to his boyhood home, promises the inhabiting family $250,000 if they will agree to have him for and make the most of the present Christmas season, and proceeds to annoy the bejeepers out of them, not least the sister. After exposing us to new psycological realities, taking us this way and that, the writers have Drew's old girlfriend show up at the door (literally), compelling him to put on a show to convince her it's his REAL family. The conflict escalates and ... well, naturally resolves itself.The plot isn't great; but then again, I suppose it could have been worse. Once we get to know main characters (basically, Drew and his rented family), we have a pretty good idea as to end-results. Some of the characters possess at least a little depth, about what we might come to expect from a Christmastime flick. Ben Affleck throws out a sort of carefree, very-child-like joy and spirit, a nearly overpositive model of the cliched ""keep-the-spirit-of-Christmas-alive-in-your-heart"" ideal. Dad, who looks not altogether unlike Home Improvement's Richard Karn, has a quiet reserve about him, with occasional moments of greater intensity. Mom seems frustrated and overworked, periodically snapping out. Their disenchanted teenage son spends the bulk of his time in his room, on the computer, doing (he would have us believe) his studies. The college-aged sister, who appears the most upset by Drew's intrusive presence, exudes a sort of would-be jaded air, portrayed with pristine clarity by Christina Applegate.The family becomes most cogent as its members provide subtle hints to their condition through family interaction and reaction before revealing to us, finally, what is really going on, in the broader family relationship. Also, Drew's own sadness over people leaving him seems real and particularly telling. Thus the movie echoes a refreshing theme of companionship.

In the opening sequence (including the DVD's alternate one), we see people committing suicide, for gosh sakes.  While this may be the most prominent time of year for such desperate acts, including them in a supposedly light-hearted movie seems questionable in taste.  The rest of the movie tries to imply that one can buy happiness and avoid loneliness at Christmastime.  This might have worked had Ben Affleck's character been less obnoxious and more sympathetic.  Even when he tells Christina Applegate about his real parents, it seems so unimportant to him that we can't find a real reason to feel sorry for him.  In spite of its many weaknesses, however, it does manage to pull off some entertaining moments.  The supporting cast including James Gandolfini (virtually wasted in his role), Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Catherine O'Hara, David Selby and Josh Zuckerman gamely try to bring life to the film.

870662,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0006JMLPM,Simon Davis,"[3, 3]","This film is certainly a classic example of a film's ""reputation"", well and truly travelling before it. In the case of ""Surviving Christmas"", most of the bad publicity and critical condemnation has played a large part in ruining this films chance at success and giving it probably the shortest theatre screening time before it was released out onto video and DVD. Here in Australia this film was not even given a theatrical release and its ""bad"" reputation has coloured many people's expectations of it. I found it an amusing but not great comedy, certainly nowhere near the complete critical stinker I was led to believe it was. While it may have been short on genuine belly laughs it had I feel a rather sad premise to it that I found rather interesting. A successful man having to ""hire"", a family to have a pretend Christmas is not a theme I'm used to happily enough and looking at it from this rather tragic angle I can see that there are probably large numbers of people out there that, like Ben Affleck's character, would really like  to create the ideal Christmas with all the trimmings that they may never have experienced in their own lives.Ben Affleck plays young, handsome high roller Drew Latham, a hot shot advertising executive in Chicago. As Christmas approaches, which he generally spends on his own, Drew has the wonderful idea of buying two tickets to Fiji for himself and his girlfriend Missy (Jennifer Vanglider), only to be informed by Missy that the holidays are for family and that she has had it with his superficial way of life. Facing the prospect of yet another lonely Christmas Drew has the idea of instead returning home to his place of birth to recapture some of the original magic of Christmas which as it turns out he never even experienced as a child. However when Drew arrives at his former home it is of course occupied by other people the disfunctional Valco family. Drew niavely asks to stay with them over the Christmas period and when he is predictably told in no unceretain terms to leave he devises a rather ""unique"" way of making the Valco's his family for christmas. He offers Tom and Alicia Valco (James Gandolfini and Christina Applegate) $250,000 if they will be his family and also not surpsingly he is then allowed to stay in the Valco home. However Drew's enthusiasm for all aspects of the traditional Christmas celebration soon starts to drive all the Valco family wild as they become submerged in a tidal wave of Christmas tree buying and decorating, Christmas carol singing, and other diverse forms of Christmas cheer. The fact the Tom and Alicia are near to breaking up and son Brian never hardly leaves his room fails to make an impression on the unfailingly festive Drew. The arrival of the Valco's daughter Christine (Catherine O""Hara), further complicates matters as she really cannot understand why her parents have allowed a total stranger to spend Christmas with them. Through various adventures such as forcing Brian and Christine to go sleigh riding  and getting Tom to wear a silly Santa hat however the cracks are revealed in the lives of the Valco's culminating in a disasterous meeting with Missy when she has a change of heart about Drew's intentions and unexpectedly comes visiting to his ""family home"", with her parents on Christmas Eve. Christine who has started to feel something for Drew despite her better judgement is suddenly turned into his ""sister"", and after tiring of thi scharade decides to bring some honesty into the situation which only makes Missy and her parents think that an incestuous relation exists between Drew and his sister! After this debacle drew realises the total mess he has made of everything including his growing love for Christine and after telling Christine of the ""real"", Christmas' he used to have in a diner with his single mother he flees back to a lonely Chicago. Tom however getting some of that precious Christmas spirit so desired by Drew goes after him and brings him back to spend a proper Christmas minus pay checks and make believe with the family.I guess it is hard to judge a film based on a Christmas theme that has such a hard cynical edge to it. ""Surviving Christmas"", certainly could never be put into the same league as that other questioning Christmas gem ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"". As stated earlier I found the theme of this movie rather sad and it managed to even give the comic elements to the story a hard edge that could be forgiven in ""National Lampoon"", but which here just made me feel depressed. It does however hav esome elements to recommend it. Opening to Andy Williams singing the unforgettable ""It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year"", its critical view of Christmas begins well as we witness scenes of beautifully decorated streets and busy Christmas shoppers in wintery Chicago interspersed with scenes of holiday carnage such as a man throwing himself under a car and a elderly lady putting her head in an oven to get away from all this ""holiday cheer"". Not your traditional Christmas images and light years away from ""Miracle on 34th Street"", to be sure, but it does anticipate a very different kind of Christmas story. Ben Affleck takes on a vastly different role here to most of his previous work and as the essentially lonely Drew sways from sentimentally touching right through to infuriatingly chipper. He is interesting in this role and has the preppy good looks where you could imagine him enjoying a lavish Christmas with all the trimmings, which is an interesting contrast to his other highly original Christmas movie performance in the also criticised ""Reindeer Games"". At times you could kill his character on how he imposes himself on his new ""family"", however he does manage to get the audience's sympathy for however short a time in his scenes on his own experiencing a lonely Christmas in Chicago and in particular when he confesses to Christine what his real Christmas' as a child were like. As the beleagued Tom and Alicia Valco, James Gandolfini and Christina Applegate play the bemused and bewildered parents well but they are constantly overwhelemed by Affleck in his almost manical frenzied role of their ""New son"". Catherine O'Hara actually manages to make something of her character as the daughter and succeeds in adding a bit of dimension to what could have been a one note role. After a screening of the film however one can see that all these family characters including that of son Brian played by Josh Zuckerman which had great comedy potential, are all largely underdeveloped and thus failed to really make an impression on the viewer. Visually ""Surviving Christmas"", certainly makes up for any lack it may have in the laughs department with a beautiful fully festive feel and anyone like myself who adores lavish Christmas decorations in homes and on the street will at least find some compensation for the disappointing elements to the story in the effort taken in this part of the production. It's a pity not as much care was expended on story and characters as there is on this film's Christmas look.The worst film ever made? Certainly not, but then again it's far from the best Christmas themed movie you will ever see either. It has it's fair share of wasted opportunities for what could have been potentially a funny comedy with an original idea. It's an ok way to spend an hour and a half but ""Surviving Christmas"", will never be in the top ten list of favourite Christmas movies with this viewer at least.  I'd recommend you judge for yourself it's worth as entertainment and not allow yourself to be swayed by the very negative coverage of this effort which coincided with a steep down turn in the previously solid gold successful career of Ben Affleck. This decline in his career fortunes in itself fired alot of the bad feeling about this movie when it was released after being on the shelf for almost a year. So if you enjoy dark-dark comedy and can get past the negative publicity then you may get something out of ""Surviving Christmas"".

It was very funny at times, but I found myself almost forcing laughter at times.  It does help you realize what is most important in your life though, your family.  I give the movie props for that.
