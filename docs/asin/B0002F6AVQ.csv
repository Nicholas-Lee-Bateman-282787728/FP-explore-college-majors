832482,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B0002F6AVQ,Happy Reader,"[3, 3]","Several years ago, I was away on business.  Sitting in my hotel room, I was clicking through the channels when I rested on this Disney Made-For-TV movie, which was just starting.  I enjoyed it so much that I called my husband, who was home with the kids two hours earlier than where I was (CA versus the midwest), and asked him to tape it for me, suggesting he and the kids would enjoy it in the meanwhile.  I am happy that it finally came out on DVD and I can toss the recorded VHS. This is ""standard"" family entertainment, Disney style, and I enjoy the silliness. I agree with previous reviewers that it is reminiscent of ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" movies, because the ""bad guys"" are inept and comical and usually steal the show.  If you can watch, without laughing, the parts where the sidekick is trying to shake a spider off his forehead, or where the town magnate is trying to figure out just what animal the cook has prepared for his dinner, well, you just don't have enough kid left in you!",5,A Comedy That We Watch Over and Over,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,997,"['Several', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'away', 'business', 'Sitting', 'hotel', 'room', 'was', 'clicking', 'channels', 'when', 'rested', 'Disney', 'Made-For-TV', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'called', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'home', 'kids', 'two', 'hours', 'earlier', 'where', 'was', 'CA', 'midwest', 'asked', 'tape', 'suggesting', 'kids', 'would', 'enjoy', 'meanwhile', 'am', 'happy', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'toss', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'standard', 'family', 'entertainment', 'Disney', 'style', 'enjoy', 'silliness', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'reminiscent', 'Apple', 'Dumpling', 'Gang', 'movies', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'inept', 'comical', 'usually', 'steal', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'laughing', 'parts', 'where', 'sidekick', 'trying', 'shake', 'spider', 'off', 'forehead', 'where', 'town', 'magnate', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'animal', 'cook', 'prepared', 'dinner', 'well', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'kid', 'left']",The Ransom of Red Chief

832492,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002F6AVQ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""The Ransom of Red Chief"" is of course one of the most famous stories of O Henry. I think everyone knows the story of the hilarious misadventures of two ""kidnappers"" and one mischievous boy, so I won't repeat it here. Like ""The Gift of the Magi"" or ""The Last Leaf,"" the 1910 short story is now part of our culture both in and out of America.Sadly the 1998 made-for-TV version, loosely based on the beloved O Henry story, is not very good - not because of its numerous departures from the original source material (I'm kind of a guy who enjoyed ""Oliver!"" and its dancing Fagin), but because of the film's too slow pace and unfocused direction, especially in the first half. There are many silly and incredibly corny jokes, which are mostly sight gags or slapstick including the boy's pompous father stepping on a roller skate (not a banana peel).For me the problem is that director Bob Clark often forgets his job as a storyteller, desperately trying to make us laugh with silly jokes. Actors are all doing their best - Christopher Lloyd and Michael Jeter are very good as a pair of small-time crooks, and so is Haley Joel Osment as the little boy. Only that they deserve better material than making faces.Those who remember Bob Clark as director of such films as the 1982 hit teen comedy ""Porky's,"" or more recently, inept and crude ""Baby Geniuses"" (in which Christopher Lloyd appears) and ""Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2"" will be surprised to know that ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" is a Hallmark production. To his credit, Bob Clark has also directed a holiday classic ""A Christmas Story"" based on Jean Shepherd's works, so Hallmark's decision is not without good reason.""The Ransom of Red Chief"" tries hard to be funny and touching at the same time. Maybe too hard. It becomes neither, lacking the characters you relate to, or the original author's wit and surprise.",3,"(2.5 STARS) Lots of Silly Jokes, Not Exactly O Henry's Classic Story",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1863,"['Ransom', 'Red', 'Chief', 'course', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'stories', 'O', 'Henry', 'think', 'everyone', 'story', 'hilarious', 'misadventures', 'two', 'kidnappers', 'one', 'mischievous', 'boy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'Gift', 'Magi', 'Last', 'Leaf', '1910', 'short', 'story', 'now', 'part', 'culture', 'America.Sadly', '1998', 'made-for-TV', 'version', 'loosely', 'based', 'beloved', 'O', 'Henry', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'numerous', 'departures', 'original', 'source', 'material', ""'m"", 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Oliver', 'dancing', 'Fagin', 'film', 'too', 'slow', 'pace', 'unfocused', 'direction', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'are', 'many', 'silly', 'incredibly', 'corny', 'jokes', 'are', 'mostly', 'sight', 'gags', 'slapstick', 'including', 'boy', 'pompous', 'father', 'stepping', 'roller', 'skate', 'not', 'banana', 'peel', 'problem', 'director', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'often', 'job', 'storyteller', 'desperately', 'trying', 'make', 'silly', 'jokes', 'Actors', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Michael', 'Jeter', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'pair', 'small-time', 'crooks', 'so', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'little', 'boy', 'Only', 'deserve', 'better', 'material', 'making', 'faces.Those', 'who', 'remember', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'director', 'such', 'films', '1982', 'hit', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Porky', 'more', 'recently', 'inept', 'crude', 'Baby', 'Geniuses', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Superbabies', 'Baby', '2', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'know', 'Ransom', 'Red', 'Chief', 'Hallmark', 'production', 'credit', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'also', 'directed', 'holiday', 'classic', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'based', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', 'works', 'Hallmark', 'decision', 'not', 'good', 'reason', 'Ransom', 'Red', 'Chief', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'touching', 'same', 'time', 'Maybe', 'too', 'hard', 'lacking', 'characters', 'relate', 'original', 'author', 'wit', 'surprise']",The Ransom of Red Chief
