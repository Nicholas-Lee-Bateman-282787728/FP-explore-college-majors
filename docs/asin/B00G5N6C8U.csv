1677204,A2WU6B7PIK7K71,B00G5N6C8U,Coffee Bean,"[1, 1]","I did not grow up watching this show, so this dvd set is my first look at this show. To qualify my review, I love classic tv and own several complete series from the 50's, 60's and 70's. On a whim, I decided to give this a try. The idea of Crabtree's mother reincarnated as a 1928 Porter is no more far-fetched than Mister Ed, Bewitched or I Dream of Jeannie. Crabtree is a lawyer with a cute, devoted wife and two kids. Then there's the main thread of the show - Crabtree's relationship with his mother via the Porter. Mancini frequently shows up in many episodes trying to buy or steal the Porter (the only antique missing from his private collection) from Crabtree.  He always gets Crabtree's name wrong, Crabtree corrects him, then Mancini dismisses it as &#34;whatever&#34;.  It's not the most well-written show. The writers certainly did not utilize the talent they had in their hands with Jerry Van Dyke (Crabtree). It isn't knee-slapping, fall-off-the-couch comedy. (Jerry Van Dyke is a scream in &#34;Coach&#34; and his guest appearances on &#34;The Dick Van Dyke Show&#34;.) But before you know it, you're drawn to this, shall I say, &#34;endearing&#34; relationship between Crabtree and his mother (her lovely voice played by Ann Sothern) the car.Critics said this was the second worst show on television. Really? And Mister Ed was more entertaining? PLEASE.  If you don't care what the critics say and want a cute, clean classic tv show to watch, I think you will enjoy My Mother the Car. This series is packaged in two plastic cases of dvd's in a colorful box. The images are crystal clear, and the sound is good. The theme song is catchy and will be in your head all day long.  :) I can't say it's among my favorite classic tv shows, but I enjoyed watching it and don't regret my purchase at all. I would much rather watch this show than a lot of the junk that's on tv today.

1677210,AF1XW6L35BR49,B00G5N6C8U,John Cronce,"[27, 27]","Somehow Allan Burns (who later co-created immortal sitcoms like ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi"") also managed to co-create ""My Mother the Car.""In hindsight, it's difficult to understand why this show seemed so ludicrous sight-unseen in 1965. It is said that the reason ""My Mother the Car"" hit the Top Ten on its first night is that America simply couldn't believe that there could be a TV show with such an outrageous plot: a lawyer discovers his mother rein-CAR-nated on a used car lot.Reviewers gleefully derided the show, generally for its premise: ""...The only thing that's funny is that somebody actually made it into a television show...""  and ""...It's an insult to cars and mothers everywhere..."" and ""...My wife said she may never drive another car as long as she lives after seeing this..""But it's hard to understand why this particular show was considered so over-the-top back then.  I mean, I totally think it's a totally weird show.  But in the '60s?  Really?Already the airwaves were populated by suburban monsters (""The Munsters,"" ""The Addams Family""), genies (""I Dream of Jeannie""), witches (""Bewitched""), Martians (""My Favorite Martian""), campy super-heroes fighting zany villains in color-coordinated costumes (""Batman""), and an incompetant secret agent who owned the world's first mobile phone, albeit in his shoe (""Get Smart""--he was later threatened in one episode with the ultimate torture: ""Ve vill force you to vatch reruns of 'My Muzzerr Za Car.'"")  If you caught afternoon reruns in 1965, you might also see a talking horse (""Mister Ed""), a talking mule (""Frances"") and a ghost who happened to be an alcoholic St. Bernard lapping up martinis from a gargantuan martini glass (""Topper"").  And the strange and bizarre would continue throughout the '60s and just into the '70s with pigeon-English-spouting cavemen (""It's About Time""), even more ghosts (""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"") and a psychic nanny (""Nanny and the Professor""), to name just a few.I can't figure out why the reincarnated mother was considered THAT outrageous for a generation of television viewers so glutted with such bizarre gimmick-laiden sitcoms.  Reading all those bad reviews for this show's basic premise, I feel like I'm listening to connoisseurs of Cold Duck debating the competing virtues of varying vintages.I guess you had to be there.  (I wasn't).That said, this really is what star Jerry Van Dyke (who turned down the role of ""Gilligan"" on ""Gilligan's Island"" for ""My Mother..."") promoted it as in 1965: ""...Our answer to 'Mister Ed'..."" meaning a sitcom inspired by the talking-horse show.  It's about a man having a clandestine relationship with this supernatural being, leading to all sorts of shenanigans and cover-ups that complicate his marriage.  But in that sense, the supernatural secret also makes it next of kin to ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" ""Bewitched,"" and to a lesser degree ""My Favorite Martian"" (where the complications caused by the wife are replaced and intensified by a nosey landlady and a suspicious detective).And so if you have a taste for ANY of the aforementioned '60s sitcoms, you'll probably enjoy this show.  It's all the same fun, same style of humor and same innocence for the whole family...without the shop-worn predictability of a show you've seen a million times.Like ""Petticoat Junction,"" which had the recurring tension of nasty Homer Bedloe repeatedly showing up to shutdown the train that brought guests to the Shady Rest Hotel, this show has its own recurring villain: Captain Bernard Manzini, a zany antique car collector who owns every car ever made...except for the model and year of ""Mother.""  Played to hilarious perfection by Avery Schreiber (""Match Game"" and countless Doritos commercials), the show is worth buying just to watch the obsessive, frenetic car collector scheme to steal or buy ""Mother.""Perhaps the passage of time and the changes in tastes will make ""My Mother the Car"" even more enjoyable to those who enjoy the old TV shows that seem to celebrate a simpler time...even if it is--maybe even because it is--a simpler time that never really existed.",5,"From the Man Who Created ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi.""

The premise of someone being reinCARnated as a car is fanciful and far-fetched, while the show itself is very silly and over-the top.  Those same descriptions could also apply to other TV series from the sixties, including &#34;Mister Ed,&#34; &#34;I Dream Of Jeannie,&#34; and &#34;Bewitched,&#34; to name a few.  While those shows lasted several seasons and are fondly remembered, &#34;My Mother The Car&#34; only lasted one season and, not having enough episodes to make it into syndication, is barely remembered.  After viewing all thirty episodes, I can honestly say that I found them to be amusing and enjoyable.  Jerry Van Dyke, who stars as attorney Dave Crabtree, proves that he can carry a TV series as the main character very well.  Avery Schreiber, who plays his nemesis Captain Manzini, is also a talented comedian, and makes for a comical villain. The video quality of the show is outstanding; the colors are pristine and vivid.  In addition, I was pleasantly surprised that most of the laugh tracks were removed.  Last but not least, the theme song by Paul Hampton is very catchy and memorable.

""My Mother the Car"" did receive some criticism during its initial broadcast, but the show had its share of fans, too.Considering the wide array of fantasy-based sitcoms that were populating network television schedules in the 1960's, ""My Mother the Car"" fits easily along side such series as  ""Bewitched,"" ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" ""It's About Time"", ""My Favorite Martian,"" and even ""The Patty Duke Show"" with its premise of ""identical cousins"" who often created quirky situations bordering on the surreal.For those who have heard that ""My Mother the Car"" is television's worst sitcom, I can only suggest watching some episodes and judging for yourself.As a teenager in 1965, I was glued to the tube and watched everything, including ""My Mother the Car."" In fact, it was one of my favorite shows, and I sorely missed it when it was canceled after one season.Through the years, I've often thought about ""My Mother the Car,"" but never got to see it on television in syndication due to the limited number of episodes that were filmed.  Thankfully, in this modern age of cable TV, the Hulu Network is showing ""My Mother the Car"" and is generating a whole new fan base for the show.I've always been a Jerry Van Dyke fan and loved seeing him in guest appearances in various TV series and doing his stand-up comedy on variety shows. In ""My Mother the Car,"" Jerry plays L.A. attorney David Crabtree who lives in a sunny, well-manicured neighborhood with his beautiful wife Barbara, played by Maggie Pierce,  and their two small children.Before being selected for the role of Barbara Crabtree, Maggie Pierce was a fashion model and character actor who appeared in many TV series. In the pilot episode, Barbara sends husband David on a mission to find an affordable station wagon that will accommodate their growing family.  Instead, David discovers an old, dilapidated 1928 Porter car on a used car lot, promptly forgets about the station wagon, and decides to bring the old Porter home with hopes of restoring it into a family ""fun car.""But even while the antique car is still on the used car lot, David discovers that the voice coming out of its radio speaker is not that of a local DJ, but that of his dearly, departed mother (voiced by film legend Ann Sothern) who died 16 years earlier. She matter-of-factly informs him that she has returned to Earth reincarnated... as a car! She also tells him that ""we don't have any choice in how we come back.""And it's this thread of fantasy that ties together the crazy patchwork quilt known as ""My Mother the Car."" In some ways, this series is similar to ""Mr. Ed."" Ed, the horse, talks to Wilbur when no one else is around, and the 1928 Porter talks to David when... well, you get the picture.""My Mother the Car"" appeared on NBC during the 1965-66 television season. It was in color with a total of 30 episodes. The new DVD  box set will contain all 30 color episodes, but, according to the TGG Direct website, will contain no ""extras.""  That's okay, a TV series this rare is great to have, with or without extras.Aside from the fully remastered, beautiful transfers (they must have been taken from the original camera negatives), bright colors, and crystal clear sound, the original laugh tracks have been removed. This greatly adds to the viewing enjoyment of the series.By buying DVD sets of old TV series made available from companies such as TGG Direct, Shout!

The premise IS absurd:  The central character, David Crabtree, has a 1928 Porter who happens to be his mother (reinCARnated, as people repeatedly note).  The car, like Mr. Ed, and Francis the Talking Mule, will talk only to one person, leading to amusing situations.  The plots in MMTC revolve around the car, with many of the episodes centering on the unsuccessful attempts by a rich collector, played by Avery Schreiber, to own it.The comedy is broad, the scripts are not that great while few are outright bad, and let's face it:  This show's target audience was children.  It was not meant to be sophisticated comedy, unlike star Jerry Van Dyke's brother's show.  I remember watching it on delayed broadcast when it first ran, and I enjoyed it.  Watching the episodes on DVD nearly fifty years later, I can say the show does not deserve the bum rap it has received by reviewers like TV Guide.  I would honestly rank it as a three-star program, better than some comedies of the era, and not as good as others.The DVD package I rank higher than the series.  The prints are crisp and sharp; it has never looked better.  Some quibble with the packaging, but I don't find the box objectionable (by the way, that is actor Sonny Tufts pictured with Jerry Van Dyke on the box and DVDs and also appeared in an episode of the show).  Some reviewers note the lack of a laugh track on most of the episodes; that isn't a negative in my book.I found the show highly watchable if a bit corny overall.

Our family watched a lot of television in those days like ""Gidget"" and ""Lost In Space.""  My family must have passed on this show because I have absolutely no recollection of it. Reruns never surfaced on local television in Los Angeles during the seventies, but over the years I had heard so many jokes about it that I've been wanting to see this forever.  So, naturally I jumped on the chance to pre-order this and got my set from Amazon in yesterday's mail.The prints are gorgeous, and the clothes, cars, and street scenes, take me right back to that wonderful world of 1965, like some sort of time capsule. Unfortunately, the show needs a lot of help.  I like Jerry Van Dyke and find him much more appealing than his famous brother.  So he isn't the problem.  I just can't grasp the idea of someone coming back as a car and communicating through the radio dial.I never thought we would ever see this released on DVD, and so I intend to finish watching every episode.  I have several DVD releases from TGG Direct and I appreciate how they continue to bring us a lot of vintage television.",3,The prints are GORGEOUS!,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,1154,"['was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Mother', 'Car', 'originally', 'aired', 'family', 'watched', 'lot', 'television', 'days', 'Gidget', 'Lost', 'Space', 'family', 'must', 'have', 'passed', 'show', 'have', 'absolutely', 'recollection', 'Reruns', 'never', 'surfaced', 'local', 'television', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'seventies', 'years', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'forever', 'So', 'naturally', 'jumped', 'chance', 'pre-order', 'got', 'set', 'Amazon', 'yesterday', 'mail.The', 'prints', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'clothes', 'cars', 'street', 'scenes', 'take', 'right', 'back', 'wonderful', 'world', '1965', 'sort', 'time', 'capsule', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'lot', 'help', 'like', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'famous', 'brother', ""n't"", 'problem', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'idea', 'someone', 'coming', 'back', 'car', 'communicating', 'radio', 'dial.I', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'so', 'intend', 'finish', 'watching', 'episode', 'have', 'several', 'DVD', 'releases', 'TGG', 'Direct', 'appreciate', 'how', 'continue', 'bring', 'lot', 'vintage', 'television']",My Mother The Car: The Series
