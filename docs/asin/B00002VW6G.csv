The Stardust ballroom is alive with life. A must for the 50's plus that to spark their life. Life is not over till its over.

I bought the DVD because it seemed like a very good movie with a terrific cast and I couldn't agree more. Maureen Stapleton is excellent in this film and she plays Bea Asher, the recently widowed wife with great warmth and sincerity. She even sings in this movie and she does it very well I think. She is also a wonderful dancer who makes ballroom dancing very interesting to watch and learn. Charles Durning is also great in this fantastic movie and they both have great chemistry together. QUEEN OF THE STARDUST BALLROOM, is a magical film and the acting of both Stapleton and Durning is superb. I couldn't help feeling a little sad in the end (I won't tell you so I won't spoil the movie for you). However this is a wonderful movie and it shows that you're never too old to fall in love and follow your heart. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore.",5,"Fantastic movie, one of Ms. Stapleton finest roles",1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,943,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'bought', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'terrific', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'excellent', 'film', 'Bea', 'Asher', 'recently', 'widowed', 'wife', 'great', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'even', 'sings', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'also', 'wonderful', 'dancer', 'who', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'learn', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'also', 'great', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'QUEEN', 'THE', 'STARDUST', 'BALLROOM', 'magical', 'film', 'acting', 'Stapleton', 'Durning', 'superb', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'little', 'sad', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'However', 'wonderful', 'movie', ""'re"", 'never', 'too', 'old', 'fall', 'love', 'follow', 'heart', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'anymore']",Queen of the Stardust Ballroom

We knew zero about it but it had Charles in it,so we sat down and watched it.His acting is so incredible,it seems like you are in the room with him,and he is in your family..He's that good !I had no idea of his incredible bravery..what a man. God,I am afraid we don't have enough of them.I haven't mentioned Maureen Stapleton yet.. oh my gosh what a performance !!She has as much talent as he..This movie rates so high on my list of all time favorites.It's unforgettable. What a crime someone would ask such a high price from the public so they could see it.I could make you copies from my dvd onto vhs,but I can't give out personal info. I want you to see it that badly.And what a sad thing that it's been virtually ignored.You all impress me that you want to see it.

515459,A214CH9J48HOSY,B00002VW6G,Dennis J. Pauly,"[9, 11]","This is a wonderful romance.  Stapleton loses her husband and instead of hibernating buys a\ resale shop and begins to go out dancing.  She meets Charles Durning, falls in love, dyes her hair and both of them sing.  No  great shakes as singers but they deliver the songs better than  professionals would.  Great dance sequences probably filmed at Roseland and  40s singer Martha Tilton sings a song.  For incurably romantics this is the  best thing you will ever see.  I am glad that the DVD is now available  because with a quick push of the button you can edit out the final scene if  you wish.

Searched and searched until I finally found it.  Final performances by Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning  in a beautifully written and acted love story about love between elders.  Show later made into a musical, ""Ballroom"" with Dorothy Loudon, that fell flat because it missed the heart of the show.

515463,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B00002VW6G,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[13, 13]","This film was written when the screenwriter discovered that his widowed mother had a secret life when she passed away. He found out she was a ballroom dancer at Roseland. The story was later converted to a Broadway play titled ""Ballroom.""It is interesting to watch a movie when you are young and compare the difference to your reaction 30 years later. I was all of 20 when I watched this movie when it appeared as a made-for-TV film back in 1974-75. I loved the dancing, and in fact, some 13 years later, my husband and I took up ballroom dancing. The ending was sad and left me rather disappointed, even back then.At age 51, I find this film harder to watch, because I now strongly identify with the main character, definitely more than at age 20. I've also experienced life more. Although Bea is probably 10-15 years older, the events that happen to her are not too far off for me. It is especially difficult to watch the beginning, when Bea's husband dies, because I've been in that situation already where you are sitting in the hospital, waiting for your loved one to pass on. The ending is also difficult, because you grow to care for Bea and want the best for her, especially after she fought so hard with family members to keep this new life she created for herself. Although a romance, this film leaves you feeling slightly sad and let down after watching it. That's a sign of an excellent film --it makes an impact, evokes emotions, no matter if you're 20 or 51.One small nitpick: Maureen Stapleton cannot sing--her offkey singing is a little jarring. I wonder why her voice wasn't dubbed. Durning does a better job, but he's no Michael Buble. However, the two actors have a nice chemistry on screen and do a good job with the dancing. This is a wonderful, timeless film and features some great dance music.",5,Timeless Romance but Sad,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,1817,"['film', 'was', 'written', 'when', 'screenwriter', 'discovered', 'widowed', 'mother', 'had', 'secret', 'life', 'when', 'passed', 'away', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'ballroom', 'dancer', 'Roseland', 'story', 'was', 'later', 'converted', 'Broadway', 'play', 'titled', 'Ballroom', 'interesting', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'compare', 'difference', 'reaction', '30', 'years', 'later', 'was', '20', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'appeared', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'back', '1974-75', 'loved', 'dancing', 'fact', '13', 'years', 'later', 'husband', 'took', 'up', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'ending', 'was', 'sad', 'left', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'even', 'back', 'then.At', 'age', '51', 'find', 'film', 'harder', 'watch', 'now', 'strongly', 'identify', 'main', 'character', 'definitely', 'more', 'age', '20', ""'ve"", 'also', 'experienced', 'life', 'more', 'Bea', 'probably', '10-15', 'years', 'older', 'events', 'happen', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'especially', 'difficult', 'watch', 'beginning', 'when', 'Bea', 'husband', 'dies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'situation', 'already', 'where', 'are', 'sitting', 'hospital', 'waiting', 'loved', 'one', 'pass', 'ending', 'also', 'difficult', 'grow', 'care', 'Bea', 'want', 'best', 'especially', 'fought', 'so', 'hard', 'family', 'members', 'keep', 'new', 'life', 'created', 'romance', 'film', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'sad', 'let', 'down', 'watching', 'sign', 'excellent', 'film', 'impact', 'evokes', 'emotions', 'matter', ""'re"", '20', '51.One', 'small', 'nitpick', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'offkey', 'singing', 'little', 'jarring', 'wonder', 'why', 'voice', 'was', ""n't"", 'dubbed', 'Durning', 'better', 'job', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'However', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'dancing', 'wonderful', 'timeless', 'film', 'great', 'dance', 'music']",Queen of the Stardust Ballroom
