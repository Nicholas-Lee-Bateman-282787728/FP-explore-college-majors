The rest of the cast is just as fine.The story is controversial. The tale told here is as related by the SAS soldier known by the nom de guerre McNab. Therein the Iraqi officer who captures him suggests that before being captured the SAS team had killed hundreds of Iraqi soldiers. But others have said that there was no mention of any shooting at all by McNab when he debriefed immediately upon being released from captivity. So it is questionable whether this was a highly effective combat mission or not.The same story is told from the viewpoint of a different member of the same SAS team in The One That Got Away. In this version ""McNab"" is responsible for the failure of the mission by bad planning; he did not check that they were issued with the proper radio frequencies. Also they should have taken motor transport with them instead of having to carry 200 pound backpacks.These are lessons we should all remember next time we are planning combat missions.",5,Bravo Too Good,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,1067,"['Bravo', 'Two', 'Zero', 'two', 'bravos', 'least', 'zero', 'complaints', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'fine.The', 'story', 'controversial', 'tale', 'told', 'here', 'related', 'SAS', 'soldier', 'known', 'nom', 'guerre', 'McNab', 'Therein', 'Iraqi', 'officer', 'who', 'being', 'captured', 'SAS', 'team', 'had', 'killed', 'hundreds', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'mention', 'shooting', 'McNab', 'when', 'debriefed', 'immediately', 'being', 'released', 'captivity', 'questionable', 'was', 'highly', 'effective', 'combat', 'mission', 'not.The', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'different', 'member', 'same', 'SAS', 'team', 'One', 'Away', 'version', 'McNab', 'responsible', 'failure', 'mission', 'bad', 'planning', 'did', 'not', 'check', 'were', 'issued', 'proper', 'radio', 'frequencies', 'Also', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'motor', 'transport', 'instead', 'having', 'carry', '200', 'pound', 'backpacks.These', 'are', 'lessons', 'should', 'remember', 'next', 'time', 'are', 'planning', 'combat', 'missions']",N/A

678286,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B00005R87B,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[43, 45]","I gather that this is a well know story in The UK, yet I, for one, didn't know anything about the mission until seeing the film on Showtime recently.It is one compelling tale, and a highly realistic treatment of modern warfare, especially as practiced by special forces units in both the British and US military. It centers on a secret SAS mission early in Desert Storm. Sgt Andy McNab's unit is helicoptered in to the middle of nowhere in Norther Iraq, with orders to reconnoiter Scud Missile sites. It is supposed to be less than a 24 hr hour quick-in/quick-out assignment. Yet from almost the time they are dropped off, they lose radio contact with command.Then things start to really deteriorate. They find themselves exposed in what is essentially open desert, badly outgunned, and in a country extremely hostile. Eventually, after inflicting an amaziing number of casualties on their enemy, all but one of the seven man unit is either captured, or killed.What happens to McNab and his comrades in Iraqi custody makes the Turkish prison scenes in MIDNIGHT EXPRESS look like a trip to Club Med. It's by far the most graphic, brutal depiction of prisoner interrogation I've ever seen. It really verges on over the top at times, but one is reminded that this is a true story.I don't know where this movie was made, but it's actually rather amazing that the filmmakers could get this large a cast of middle easterners to reenact some of these war and prison scenes. Rather like the logistical problems that faced the creators of BLACK HAWK DOWN, which was filmed in Morocco. I notice on IMDB that the country of origin is South Africa, but that only confuses me more. It's a BBC production, so they usually find a way, TRAFFIK, being a good example.I've seen several reviewer complaints about the poor quality of the DVD transfer. I watched it on Cable, so can't comment on that. The print that I saw had no problems.The cast of Bravo Two Zero is uniformly (no pun intended) excellent. Sean Bean, known to most American audiences for his role of Boromir in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, delivers as usual. I thought he was great in THE BIG EMPTY recently, as well. Tom Clegg, a veteran director of British Television, does a yeomanlike job of keeping it real here.What struck me in the final alaysis is how McNab downplays his ordeal. He expresses no lasting bitterness towards his captor/torturers. He says they were doing their duty, as well, though perhaps enjoying it just a bit too much. He also jokes that he didn't immediately turn tree hugger after getting back home. He and his men were just being soldiers, and what soldiers they were/are! They should not be forgotten. This movie is unforgettable as well.BEK",5,A True Tale of Bravery Under Fire,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2713,"['gather', 'well', 'know', 'story', 'UK', 'yet', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'mission', 'seeing', 'film', 'Showtime', 'recently.It', 'one', 'compelling', 'tale', 'highly', 'realistic', 'treatment', 'modern', 'warfare', 'especially', 'practiced', 'special', 'forces', 'units', 'British', 'US', 'military', 'secret', 'SAS', 'mission', 'early', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'Sgt', 'Andy', 'McNab', 'unit', 'helicoptered', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Norther', 'Iraq', 'orders', 'reconnoiter', 'Scud', 'Missile', 'supposed', 'be', 'less', '24', 'hr', 'hour', 'quick-in/quick-out', 'assignment', 'almost', 'time', 'are', 'dropped', 'off', 'lose', 'radio', 'contact', 'command.Then', 'things', 'start', 'really', 'deteriorate', 'find', 'exposed', 'what', 'essentially', 'open', 'desert', 'badly', 'outgunned', 'country', 'extremely', 'hostile', 'Eventually', 'inflicting', 'amaziing', 'number', 'casualties', 'enemy', 'one', 'seven', 'man', 'unit', 'either', 'captured', 'killed.What', 'McNab', 'comrades', 'Iraqi', 'custody', 'Turkish', 'prison', 'scenes', 'MIDNIGHT', 'EXPRESS', 'look', 'trip', 'Club', 'Med', 'far', 'most', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'depiction', 'prisoner', 'interrogation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'top', 'times', 'one', 'reminded', 'true', 'story.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'actually', 'rather', 'amazing', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'get', 'large', 'cast', 'middle', 'easterners', 'reenact', 'war', 'prison', 'scenes', 'logistical', 'problems', 'faced', 'creators', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'was', 'filmed', 'Morocco', 'notice', 'IMDB', 'country', 'origin', 'South', 'Africa', 'only', 'more', 'BBC', 'production', 'usually', 'find', 'way', 'TRAFFIK', 'being', 'good', 'example.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'reviewer', 'complaints', 'poor', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'watched', 'Cable', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'print', 'saw', 'had', 'problems.The', 'cast', 'Bravo', 'Two', 'Zero', 'uniformly', 'pun', 'intended', 'excellent', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'known', 'most', 'American', 'audiences', 'role', 'Boromir', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'delivers', 'usual', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'THE', 'BIG', 'EMPTY', 'recently', 'well', 'Tom', 'Clegg', 'veteran', 'director', 'British', 'Television', 'yeomanlike', 'job', 'keeping', 'real', 'here.What', 'struck', 'final', 'alaysis', 'how', 'McNab', 'ordeal', 'lasting', 'bitterness', 'captor/torturers', 'were', 'doing', 'duty', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'enjoying', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'turn', 'tree', 'hugger', 'getting', 'back', 'home', 'men', 'were', 'just', 'being', 'soldiers', 'what', 'soldiers', 'were/are', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'unforgettable', 'well.BEK']",N/A

678289,A256F7E787F5SG,B00005R87B,Christopher Nieman,"[75, 76]","When I discovered, to my surprise, that the BBC made a movie of Andy McNab's bestselling book BRAVO TWO ZERO for British television, and that they had the wherewithal to cast Sean Bean as McNab, I was immediately interested.But it was a specific, incisive review on Amazon that had me buy the DVD sight unseen. Knowing that McNab co-wrote the screenplay, served as military technical advisor (can you possibly beat that for authentic detail?) and carefully chose how the film would be produced, I was confident its foundation was solid as granite. And I was not disappointed in the least.I read McNab's book in 1996, so it gave me the advantage of knowing the subject matter in the movie.  Some viewers will be put off by the casual use of military jargon. There are elliptical references to the ""SatNav"" (satellite navigation unit, otherwise known as ""the shiny thing""), ""TACBE"" (tactical beacon, or two-way radio), ""RV"" (rendezvous point), and ""tabbing"" (walking), just to name a few. Likewise, some of the rhythm of the characters' language may skip past American ears. But I think this is not a weakness, because it deliberately avoids trying to be all things to all people.In my opinion, it's the authentic language and the camaraderie between squad mates that set this apart from just about any war film ever made. It also presents a unique brand of casual, sometimes fatalistic humor that bonds the unit together, even in the face of incredible adversity.  It's something that's extremely hard to convey to a viewing audience without seeming trite, but here it hits the mark time and again.The scale of military action by the squad is also very well portrayed. McNab apparently drilled the actors pretty well, because you can see a little bit of snap in almost every move they make. Especially in the initial engagement, I was getting the indication the action was choreographed, or at least overseen, by McNab himself. In fact, the film as a whole is very faithful to the book, right down to the last line uttered by Sean Bean (which is the last line in the book). Many scenes come off in such an extemporaneous manner that the film takes on an almost documentary-like quality. It's a credit to the author for finding the best possible way to present his story.And that's not even mentioning the film's harrowing last half, and a dozen other things worth mentioning, if it weren't for space considerations.BRAVO TWO ZERO had me quickly revisiting my list of favorite war movies. Of those films, this is already in my personal top ten after two viewings. I highly recommend it.

678290,AECVYXIL9791R,B00005R87B,David C. Read,"[0, 0]","This British made-for-TV movie tells the story of an 8-man SAS unit inserted deep behind enemy lines during the first gulf war and ordered to interdict and destroy SCUD missiles.  This movie was based upon a book by Andy McNab, directed by Tom Clegg (Sharpe's Rifles), and stars Sean Bean (""Sharpe's Rifles,"" ""National Treasure,"" ""Troy,"" ""Lord of the Rings"") as McNab.Murphy's law was in full effect on this mission: everything that could go wrong went wrong.  Their radios would not function, and they were discovered by a goatherder and reported to the Iraqi army.  Because the radios were non-functional, they could not be rescued by helicopter and were forced to hike out 120 miles to the Syrian border.  Along the way they were separated, and most were eventually killed or captured.  After being captured they were tortured.McNab claims that during their run for the border, the SAS team inflicted some 250 casualties on the Iraqis, including 100 KIA.  This destruction is faithfully depicted in the movie, but based upon reading the Amazon reviews of McNab's book, it appears that he may have wildly embellished this part of the story.

Bravo Two Zero provides ample evidence to support this thesis.  Andy McNab (Sean Bean)  and his British SAS buddies are sent on a secret mission to destroy Iraq's SCUD missiles aimed at Israel during Operation Desert Storm.  They are discovered and must flee for their lives.  There are only eight of them and they are clearly outnumbered by their pursuers.  This, however, does not prevent them from killing countless Iraqi fighters.  Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti cowboy pictures didn't kill his opponents this easily.  Totalitarian regimes prefer their fighters to be mere robots.  The soldiers of Great Britain are obviously better trained and disciplined---and more inclined to rationally react to unexpected challenges.The torture scenes are unpleasant to watch.  Saddam Hussein's henchmen, needless to add, are ruthless and indifferent about the Geneva Conventions.  McNab even has a tooth forcibly extracted during one interrogation session.

Second, there are few quality movies about Desert Storm, and this told from the British point of view, is refreshing, and quite accurate, especially in the line of Snafu...and Snafu is what happens.  Unlike other's who reviewed this, as a military spouse and a military brat, the terminology wasn't obscure.  Especially today, with the ongoing war and its terminology being in the news and on the big screen so frequently.  The movie is visually upsetting at times, due to the treatment of the soldiers as military prisoners, but it isn't played up for the gore factor, as too many movies have done.  In this movie, Mr. Bean delivers one of his best lines....the simple words ""Not Andy?"" are delivered with the right amount of pathos to cap a great performance.  I think it is only second to the look he gives his father in Lorna Doone, where as Carver Doone, he discovers he is being disinherited in favor of Lorna and her suitor, his enemy.  Both prove that when given half a chance, Mr. Bean can deliver a great performance.

McNab's book ( and if you haven't read it yet, then get it ! ) tells how his eight man SAS patrol was dropped into Northern Iraq to hunt out mobile Scud launchers, however from the point of insertion onwards, virtually everything went wrong, through a mixture of both ill luck and being poorly equipped. ( Also check out fellow patrol member Chris Ryan's book ""The One That Got Away"", and Michael Asher's controversial book ""The Real Bravo Two Zero )This 1999 telemovie by the BBC, does a fairly accurate job of illustrating life in the field for a special forces patrol, and wiry Sean Bean makes a great Andy McNab.

This one was mine.""Former SAS sergeant Andy McNab could have sold his best selling true story of the Gulf War to Hollywood.  He opted for less money from the BBC for reasons of creative control. He has a writing credit on the script and served as technical adviser, drilling the actors on weapons handling and tactics.This is the film's strength. Everything looks right, especially for a low budget effort.  Stock footage of aircraft and Scud missiles is used in places to give background information, but watching the actors preparing for their mission and patrolling in the field feels very real.  The soldier's banter is also pitch perfect and often very funny.This realism, however, is also a weakness, especially for an American audience. Much backstory has been omitted, so those viewers unfamilar with the SAS and the highly celebrated exploits of this particular 8 man patrol may find it hard to keep the characters and the story straight. Americans may also have problems with the British slang, technical military jargon and working class accents.  Of course, the wonderful thing about DVD technology is that one can always use close captioning to help figure out what were gobbed off about the while making a brew.This is a story about leadership when everything goes wrong.  It is about keeping your head, and your sense of humor, when encountering both the absurdity and the terror of a war were one side plays by horrifying rules. It is not a film for everyone.

678313,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00005R87B,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[34, 34]","Bravo Two Zero is a two-hour 1997 BBC film adaptation of ex-SAS Sergeant Andy McNabb's book of the same name, which documents his two-month experience behind enemy lines in Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991.  McNabb was the leader of an eight-man SAS team sent disable both the Iraqi's scud missiles and their communication system.  The crew, however, finds themselves with a disabled communication system of their own, and when things go terribly wrong, they have no alternative but to abort their mission and try to reach the Syrian border.  In the process, the team must endure freezing temperatures, injury, separation, capture and torture.Sean Bean (Sharpe, Extremely Dangerous, Golden Eye) gives an absolutely first-rate and extremely convincing performance as Andy McNabb.  Bean worked very closely with McNabb in order really to come to grips with the man and his coping mechanisms in the face of such extreme and terrifying conditions, and I simply cannot imagine a better portrayal by Bean or anyone else.  (Just as a point of interest, McNabb himself has said that he thought Bean could have done the job in real life.)Though I am not generally speaking an aficionado of military/war films, I found this to be an interesting and eye-opening account.  It is not a big-budgeted Hollywood production and therefore makes use of actual archive footage of bomber planes and soldiers in places.  As a result the film may not look quite as slick in places, but don`t let that deter you.  It is nonetheless extremely well done--a quality production that is consumately acted by all involved.Recommended to fans of military/war films in particular, but also to fans of Sean Bean in general.",4,An Eye-Opening and Interesting True Story from the Gulf War,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,1690,"['Bravo', 'Two', 'Zero', 'two-hour', '1997', 'BBC', 'film', 'adaptation', 'ex-SAS', 'Sergeant', 'Andy', 'McNabb', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'documents', 'two-month', 'experience', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Iraq', 'Gulf', 'War', '1991', 'McNabb', 'was', 'leader', 'eight-man', 'SAS', 'team', 'sent', 'disable', 'Iraqi', 'scud', 'missiles', 'communication', 'system', 'crew', 'however', 'disabled', 'communication', 'system', 'own', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'have', 'alternative', 'abort', 'mission', 'try', 'reach', 'Syrian', 'border', 'process', 'team', 'must', 'endure', 'freezing', 'temperatures', 'injury', 'separation', 'capture', 'torture.Sean', 'Bean', 'Sharpe', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Andy', 'McNabb', 'Bean', 'worked', 'very', 'closely', 'McNabb', 'order', 'really', 'come', 'grips', 'man', 'coping', 'mechanisms', 'face', 'such', 'extreme', 'terrifying', 'conditions', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'better', 'portrayal', 'Bean', 'anyone', 'else', 'Just', 'point', 'interest', 'McNabb', 'said', 'thought', 'Bean', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'job', 'real', 'life', 'am', 'not', 'generally', 'speaking', 'aficionado', 'military/war', 'films', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'eye-opening', 'account', 'not', 'big-budgeted', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'therefore', 'use', 'actual', 'archive', 'footage', 'bomber', 'planes', 'soldiers', 'places', 'result', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'quite', 'slick', 'places', 'don', 't', 'let', 'deter', 'nonetheless', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'quality', 'production', 'consumately', 'acted', 'involved.Recommended', 'fans', 'military/war', 'films', 'particular', 'also', 'fans', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'general']",N/A

678316,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005R87B,trebe,"[3, 3]","Bravo Two Zero is the call sign of a group of eight British soldiers, sent on a mission in Iraq, in 1991.  The film, released in 1999, is based on memoirs of Andy McNab, a member of the team.  The unit's objective is to disrupt the targeting of SCUD missiles, by destroying a fiber optic line that the enemy is using to transmit targeting information.  The group is flown in by helicopter, and dispatched near their objective.  The enemy is too close to the target to strike.  The group intends to move when it gets dark, but they are spotted and forced to engage the enemy.  With their cover blown, no radio communication, and no chance of completing the mission, the soldiers head north on foot, in an attempt to reach Syria.  Trying to remain hidden, the unit also has to deal with the cold.  Travelling in a commandeered vehicle, they are forced to fight their way out at a checkpoint, and the group becomes separated in the dark.In the later stages, the film focuses on Andy McNab played by Sean Bean (Patriot Games), who finds soon himself alone after the incident at the checkpoint.  Approaching the border, McNab is captured, and taken to a prison, where he is tortured.  Soon he learns that others in his group are also being held prisoner in the same place.  This knowledge bolsters the resolve of the men to resist, but a dark and uncertain future seems to lie ahead.  The film also features Steve Nicolson, Rick Warden, Richard Graham, Robert Hobbs, and Robert Whitehead.Not your typical guts and glory war tale, Bravo Two Zero presents a more realistic look at a mission, and what can happen when things do not go right.  Featuring what appears to be authentic British dialects, the movie includes scenes of the soldiers writing letters to their loved ones prior to the mission, in case they are killed, and recording statements on video, in case they are captured.  It's pretty sobering stuff, and not everyone does return.  Although the film displays the team's ability to function as a fighting unit, this is not a film about blowing stuff up.  While the team's efficiency in battle may be a bit exaggerated, this is actually a film about camaraderie, survival, and doing one's duty as a soldier.  When what is left of the team is captured, the tone of the film takes a major shift, as survival becomes very questionable.",3,a mission where things don't go as planned . . .,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2337,"['Bravo', 'Two', 'Zero', 'call', 'sign', 'group', 'eight', 'British', 'soldiers', 'sent', 'mission', 'Iraq', '1991', 'film', 'released', '1999', 'based', 'memoirs', 'Andy', 'McNab', 'member', 'team', 'unit', 'objective', 'disrupt', 'targeting', 'SCUD', 'missiles', 'destroying', 'fiber', 'optic', 'line', 'enemy', 'using', 'transmit', 'targeting', 'information', 'group', 'flown', 'helicopter', 'dispatched', 'objective', 'enemy', 'too', 'close', 'target', 'strike', 'group', 'move', 'when', 'dark', 'are', 'spotted', 'forced', 'engage', 'enemy', 'cover', 'blown', 'radio', 'communication', 'chance', 'completing', 'mission', 'soldiers', 'head', 'north', 'foot', 'attempt', 'reach', 'Syria', 'Trying', 'remain', 'hidden', 'unit', 'also', 'deal', 'cold', 'Travelling', 'commandeered', 'vehicle', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'way', 'checkpoint', 'group', 'separated', 'dark.In', 'later', 'stages', 'film', 'Andy', 'McNab', 'played', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'who', 'soon', 'alone', 'incident', 'checkpoint', 'Approaching', 'border', 'McNab', 'captured', 'taken', 'prison', 'where', 'tortured', 'others', 'group', 'are', 'also', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'same', 'place', 'knowledge', 'resolve', 'men', 'resist', 'dark', 'uncertain', 'future', 'lie', 'ahead', 'film', 'also', 'Steve', 'Nicolson', 'Rick', 'Warden', 'Richard', 'Graham', 'Robert', 'Hobbs', 'Robert', 'Whitehead.Not', 'typical', 'guts', 'glory', 'war', 'tale', 'Bravo', 'Two', 'Zero', 'more', 'realistic', 'look', 'mission', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'right', 'Featuring', 'what', 'be', 'authentic', 'British', 'dialects', 'movie', 'scenes', 'soldiers', 'writing', 'letters', 'loved', 'ones', 'prior', 'mission', 'case', 'are', 'killed', 'recording', 'statements', 'video', 'case', 'are', 'captured', 'pretty', 'sobering', 'stuff', 'not', 'everyone', 'return', 'film', 'team', 'ability', 'function', 'fighting', 'unit', 'not', 'film', 'blowing', 'stuff', 'up', 'team', 'efficiency', 'battle', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'actually', 'film', 'camaraderie', 'survival', 'doing', 'one', 'duty', 'soldier', 'When', 'what', 'left', 'team', 'captured', 'tone', 'film', 'major', 'shift', 'survival', 'becomes', 'very', 'questionable']",N/A

Sean Bean (my favorite Lord of the Rings actor) is terrific and the acting on the whole is excellent. The directors aren't afraid to have moments where nothing interesting seems to be happening--and then moments where you really get a feel for how SAS would act in combat. At times I almost thought I might be watching a documentary. Most refreshing, the director tries to realistically convey his scenes--not tie everything into some profound metaphysical truism. There is a message here, but you aren't hit over the head w/ it so many times that it sucks the life out of the actors/scenes/dialog.It's true the budget for the film wasn't huge and there are a few scenes were an editor might have been a little more liberal w/ the cutting knife. However the acting and realism of many of the action scenes/dialog more than make up for the lack of expensive design sets.and btw, the packaging of the DVD/video is pretty silly--but don't be put off. The film is marketed for teens wanting more Schwarznegger, but the best audience is one more seriously interested in history.Four stars because there are a couple of over the top scenes that do a disservice to the rest of the movie.
