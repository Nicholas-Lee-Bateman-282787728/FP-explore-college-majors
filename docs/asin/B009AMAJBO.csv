The violence and the battles and fights are all reminiscent of westerns with the good guys and bad guys usually easy to tell apart.  Obviously the role women play is considerably different and the sci-fi plot twists definitely not standard western fare.  If you like shoot-outs and sword fights, you might see enough to make hanging through the other stuff worth it.For a more pure modern western, you're better off with &#34;Hawaii Five-O.&#34;",4,"It wants to be a western, but it can't be that simple these days.",1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,578,"['Miles', 'too', 'complicated', 'character', 'be', 'hero', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'western', 'sense', 'been', 'way', 'too', 'dark', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'violence', 'battles', 'fights', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'westerns', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'usually', 'easy', 'tell', 'apart', 'Obviously', 'role', 'women', 'play', 'considerably', 'different', 'sci-fi', 'plot', 'twists', 'definitely', 'not', 'standard', 'western', 'fare', 'like', 'shoot-outs', 'sword', 'fights', 'might', 'see', 'enough', 'make', 'hanging', 'other', 'stuff', 'worth', 'it.For', 'more', 'pure', 'modern', 'western', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', '34', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O.', '34']",Revolution: Season 1

There are a few shows I will catch if there is nothing to do and the only time I really watch is on the Elliptical on my Kindle Fire. This show got a lot of hype and it is a Eric Kripke show. JJ Abrams (or however you spell it) has never been my favorite guy but I am a huge fan of Kripke. I loved Supernatural when it started and I was so hoping the quality of this show would be equal to or greater than that one. Not. Even. Close.Dull lifeless characters who are not only boring but annoying make this all but un-watchable. Whoever cast the lead teen girl roll should be fired. She is awful. I cannot recollect the last time I saw this bad of acting. Oh wait - it was at my daughter's 8th grade drama production. The sidekicks (who are so memorable I never remember their names) are lame. You get the sense there is back story and it does finally start to come through (I've watched through 4 episodes) but it is too late and too little to make me care. Since it is fiction TV I was willing to just ignore all the science behind what happened - and take it on faith - if the plot moved me along and gave me enjoyment.I find it very similar to Lost. However at least Lost gave us a season or two of great acting, interesting story with a little mystery, before it turned into a confused mess. I'll be honest I don't want to invest several years into a TV show. I want to turn on the TV and enjoy the show and what happens and not have five thousand unanswered questions every episode. I find it irritating not addicting.I will say Miles character has great potential - the bad good guy - and you can sort of see his shading but every time you think you are going to get more it's like someone yelled ""cut"" and that was all she wrote. Thanks but no thanks. I didn't hate it but I don't like it. Biggest disappointment in TV Land I've had for a while. At least there is Grimm which is turning out to be a great show with stellar characters.

1590733,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B009AMAJBO,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[3, 6]","The world has been swept back in time with the electrical grid and all electronics blacking out all over the world. Fifteen years later, after the population stabilizes (e.g. the inevitable die off from accident, disease and social unrest) people are living in small farming communities patrolled by tyrannical militias. Our focus family is of course the family that knows more about the loss of electricity (at least in the case of the father) than anyone else.On the day that puts the plot in motion, the militia shows up to take the father in for questioning. The son and the community fight the arrest resulting in a gun fight, the father dead (but not before handing off the thumb drive to a colleague and neighbor) the son arrested and the daughter and step-mother on the road in search of a long lost uncle to help them find out just what really happened.A great concept for a post-apocalyptic and dystopic tale, but as many viewers have mentioned it just isn't working because the creators are too afraid to get really dirty and don't know whether this is an adventure tale and quest or whether it is a story about the importance of family. Not that it can't be both, but it is too aware of itself as a product of the moment with its scrubbed and healthy characters and its too easy movement from plot point to plot point. The show doesn't believe itself and that is why the viewers can't believe it. Other shows had things that were hard to swallow but were still good shows, for instance the lack of nuclear fall-out from literally dozens of bombs in Jericho, but the show believed in itself and allowed other hardship and grit to disturb the viewer. Revolution should be gritty and instead it is like Dawson's Creek goes to the apocalypse or the OC in the brave new world.

Is it any wonder that these newer channels now dominate all awards?  The short sitcom is about the only thing left which network still might make decently, such as MODERN FAMILY.If you want to see what this series aspires to be, then go watch AMC's THE WALKING DEAD.  It is just about the same concept except that power stuff still can work if you can find someone to run it.  Zombies have made the world a post apocalypse society, not a power failure.  This is a small difference.  They are both survivalist shows.This show had a good premise although probably the science is all off.  The premise is that we lose all power and have to learn to survive in a world without power.  That everyone looks healthy, well fed and well groomed in such a society is a big mistake.  The women especially look as if they could have just exited a top notch salon, complete with first rate colorist.It appears that the country has lapsed into a military coup d'etat via the militia. There is a group of rebels.  There is also a small pack who wants to turn the power again, especially an uncle, Miles, and his niece.  It is this small band who are our chief heroes.Gian Carlo Esposito, formerly Gus of Breaking Bad, is the head figure of the wandering militia.  He is again mostly the bad guy. It is not even close to his bad guy character on Breaking Bad.I've watched two episodes of this.

1590771,A2IPJU07ZEDQXR,B009AMAJBO,"DWD ""DW""","[17, 24]","There is so much that cold have gone right in this apocalyptic survival series, but sadly, nothing from the writers went right at all. The actors are all believable and pretty good. Too bad the writing isn't.A good scifi book or movie should do at least two things well: (1) Be about science and (2) Explain any inconsistencies in that science and have believable fixes for those inconsistencies.A good example of this is Star Trek where we have ""warp dive"" that can be thousands of times faster than the speed of light. Problem: Taking inertia into consideration, in order for humans to accelerate to light speed and not be squashed to death under the power of inertia, it would take something like 9 months of accceleration to light speed, never mind ""warp speed.""So how did Star Trek fix this problem? ""Inertial Dampners."" We don't know how that would work in real life, but it is explained in the original series, and that was back in the mid 60s. A large stretch, but at least they tried to explain the possibility of humans traveling at higher than speeds of light, and they didn't stray from physics to explain it.Enter Revolution. Somehow a group of scientist developed a way to make all electrical devices inoperable, unless you have the secret amulet, which is about the size of a walnut.I've watched half of the season and there is no explanation how any device could be developed that would create a physics that would render electricity unusable worldwide. The writers just skipped that. I guess it was too much trouble to understand some simple 8th grade physics. But ok, I can go with that. I mean science is strange and the more advanced we get the more we see ""miracle"" science. So I can live with that to a degree.However, what I cannot live with is the nonexistence of science as a method of story telling in a scifi series, book, movie, etc. I mean it's called a 'scifi' series. So, um, where is the technology and why isn't it being developed and explained to us over time? This is about the most science-less scifi series I have ever seen. It's more of a survival-soap opera series  than having to do about anything scientific.Which brings me to my next problem, which is a disregard for science at all. In episode 6, I believe, the star group is walking through a subway tunnel to get to Philadelphia. They suffer a cave-in at the entrance to the cave, which blocks the outside air from getting into the subway. OK, lots of problems here but I can go with it.A short time later, they begin to hallucinate because of a lack of oxygen.  Really? I guess the writers have never heard about cubic inches and how to calculate how much oxygen is in an area--THE SIZE OF THE PHILADELPHIA SUBWAY! Are you kidding me? We're suppose to believe that oxygen is rushing through this gigantic subway tunnel right before the cave-in and then a few hours later a small group of humans have used it all up? Do the math. There are literally thousands of cubic feet of oxygen in those tunnels. They would die of starvation before dying of oxygen deprivation. Wow, really? This is really a disdain for science in all ways.There are all sorts of other smaller discrepancies, but I figure if the writers are going to be that lazy and even ignorant of science, they shouldn't be doing scifi movies in the first place, and since they are, and I'm watching it, there will be many move idiotic things like this, and I just can't go with it anymore. It's ridiculous.Here are some problems, although less blatant than the oxygen thing.(1) Nice hair and even lipstick. Yeah, right. 15 years after all power has gone off.(2) Clean, pressed, shiny cloths. Get a clue from Walking Dead.(3) Really stupid writing that has the actors doing unbelievably idiot things that no thinking person would do, simply to create a problem for a plot. Example: Carrying around a power amulet they know their arch enemy is trying to get, that they know is going to cause millions of people to die if it gets in the hands of the enemy, that is agreed by the group that it is probably the most dangerous thing they could ever carry--and yeah, it gets stolen by the bad guys. Wow, didn't see that coming. They could have at least hid it and offered it for ransom to get their buddy out of enemy territory, or something like that. Wait, that would take some good logical thinking skills to pull off in a believable way.(5) Being more of a child's soap opera than anything scifi.(6) The bad guys are obviously much more organized and smart than the good guys. The good guys are getting caught, escaping, caught, escaping multiple times throughout, even though they continue to (1) Have no tactical plan except free the good guy, kill the bad guy, (2) Make the same idiot mistakes that get them nearly killed or captured beforehand, and (3) Allowing a 15 year old girl to run the group, in spite of almost getting them killed more times than I can count--even though there is a skilled military tactical veteran in the group. Yeah, right. Ex: At one point they capture an enemy spy. They have him in cuffs and in a cage. In order to interrogate him, they take the cuffs off and take him out of the cage to a place where he can simply run away--which he does promptly. We're talking writing on about the 4th grade level here. It reminds me of ""Land of the Lost.""(7) REALLY IMPORTANT: Completely ignoring the ethics behind the enemy, which is more powerful than any of the good guys or their rag tag groups fighting them, and continuously showing the viewers how psychopathy and sociopathology are rewarded, which at the same time never allowing a counter point to the ""might makes right"" militia morality. For instance, they enemy has yet to kill any one of importance--they always somehow miraculously get away, while killing off key people in the good guy group. There is no dialog about how the bad guys govern themselves compared to the good guys. There is never any retribution, although the bad guys continuously murder and torture the good guys. I mean this is an excellent opportunity to introduce some intellect into the series, but nothing. Not even a mention of the difference between universal might makes right morality and its consequences compared to a more compassionate morality and it's conclusion, which means the series is trying to grab your emotions without engaging your intellect.  Which leads me to number 8.(8) The reason there isn't any thought provoking dialog about ethics, philosophy, science, morality is because the target audience wouldn't understand it. This series is written at about the 4th grade level and meant for kids between the ages of 6 and 12 or so, that is, very unquestioning kids.The actors are all good, however, and they are doing the best they can with a stupid script. I mean when the boss tells you to use lipstick you use it, even though it's been 15 years since electricity was on.Well, I can't do it anymore. It's a childishly written series for children and has nothing really to do with scifi at all. It's more like a kids soap opera. It's so predictable I almost fell a sleep watching it.",1,"Good premise, bad execution.",1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,7114,"['so', 'much', 'cold', 'have', 'gone', 'right', 'apocalyptic', 'survival',

I've always liked swordfighting, and there is plenty of it here. I also really love the sister/brother storyline, she takes care of him because he has asthma and he's her little brother. I also like that they never had a fight, from what we've seen in flashbacks and the brief moments that they're together in the pilot. Shame, though, that he dies one episode after Charlie finds him. Their reunion scene was way too brief. And isn't it odd that he never has an asthma attack while he's being led to Monroe?

It tries to emulate what shows like The Walking Dead do successfully - the loneliness, the despair, the danger, the uncertainty of tomorrow - and completely misses the mark in every respect.From the pilot onwards, there's an overwhelming sense that we've seen this all before. The characters are drawn from the 'pick any 5' NBC mix-and-match set and lack any depth or personality, to the point where the actors are practically phoning in their performances. As a result, it feels like everyone's playing a game of let's pretend than showing us a window into their post-apocalyptic reality. At least in similar shows, the actors are made to look dirty and worn down - here, everyone's just had a shower, spa treatment and fresh hair cut. I don't believe the world they're showing us.There are some J.J.Abrams trademarks too that once drew intrigue but as we all got burned by the mysteries going nowhere in Lost, make me wonder if they are just to excite the audience rather than part of any larger over-arching plot. The most interesting part of the whole series was the initial scene where the electricity stopped working and it showed the transformation from today's world to Revolution's dystopia - again, Abrams is brilliant at creating clever 'what if' set ups but increasingly fails to deliver on the promise of the premise.To be fair, the End Of The World genre is difficult to pull off because of the sheer number of shows on the topic and the high quality of execution in some cases.

Forstchen (One Second After), David Crawford (Lights Out) or even S. M. Stirling (Novel of Change Series). Unfortunately, what was actually produced was the aforementioned ""Hot Mess!""1.) While we don't know the cause, I can't imagine that an event strong enough to take down everything electric and combustion engines and solar powered devices and batteries and make modern firearms useless, would not cause the lights to go out in a synchronized format? For example, how was it that when the Matheson household went dark, the power across the street didn't go till they walked out on their balcony? Same thing with the car lights going off when Miles broke down2.) In that apparently the ""event"" also caused modern firearms to become ineffective (by virtue of the fact that most of the militia are either carrying muskets or cross bows and there is no conceivable way to claim scarcity after only 15-years), yet somehow the Captain of the militia has a functioning ""45?"" Perhaps this will be explained at some point in future episodes, though it is a glaring inconsistency3.) Nice orderly crops growing, everyone appearing to be well fed with a brief moderators comment that ""millions had died!""4.) Security. While there was evidence of a feeble looking wooden fence/gate surrounding the living area, it didn't appear that the crops were protected (no evidence of patrols) and there didn't seem too much thought given to creating a defensible perimeter. It was alluded to that they were ""under the protection"" of the Monroe Militia, though that didn't seem to include armed guards5.) On the 2nd night out on their trip to Chicago, they make camp inside a plane, which is both highly visible and has a fair amount of open area surrounding it, yet they don't feel that it is necessary to post a watch? This is despite the constant warnings re: thieves, bandits et al6.) We are supposed to believe that an attractive woman living by herself in a structure with no security features and with only a double barreled shot gun (another inconsistency) to protect herself, had not fallen victim to a predator?I do understand that a TV serialized version of the road would likely be too morose for the mainstream, however, choosing to go with a combined concept of SyFy (a la Stirling) and an TEOTWAWKI scenario (a la Forstchen et al) is ambitious enough.

1590808,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B009AMAJBO,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[8, 11]","UPDATE: June, 2013 - Arguably the best season finale of any scripted show from the 2012-2013 season. Revolution had a very slow, bumpy start. After a several month break in the winter, it came back almost a completely different show. I nearly didn't pick it up again, but I sure am glad I did. The vision I had for this show that wasn't there in the fall, finally broke open in the second half of the year. IF YOU DROPPED REVOLUTION AFTER THE MISERABLE FALL SEASON, GO BACK AND WATCH THE ENTIRE SPRING SEASON!!! Each show was packed with action, exciting twists and turns, and the sort of excellence one would expect from Eric Kripke who wrote and was very involved in the first six seasons of the excellent Supernatural series on CW. The finale of Revolution was hair raising and the type where your jaw drops and you cannot wait for Season 2 to begin. WATCH REVOLUTION! IF YOU LOVE GREAT SCI FI, YOU WILL GET HOOKED. BEST COMEBACK BY A TV SHOW EVER!!ORIGINAL POST - OCTOBER, 2012 - I had high hopes for Revolution. The commercials started in June and I could not wait to see it. To be fair, I've only seen three episodes to make a finished review and it CAN get better (ie: Falling Skies - miserable season 1 to outstanding, hair raising, honorable sci fi Season 2). I think the young Tracy Spriridakos is a questionable choice for our teenage heroine - she seems stiff and a bit unreal to sell this story to me. Billy Burke is the best part of this series, but so far, I'm just not seeing the necessary sparks between characters to make this show a true inspiration in any genre. Speaking of which, what genre is it again? It feels like a show that just can't figure out where it belongs. I read a review by one of my favorite USAToday reviewers and he said it was a combination between the much beloved Firefly and the truly wonderful Jericho. Well, it has a long way to go to develop the awesome ensemble of Jericho and the almost perfection of the best of sci fi and beautiful quirky humor of Firefly. What's worse, it's simply not as good as recent shows we never got to see finished as The Event (what WAS the EVENT, she asked, STILL wanting to know), Terra Nova (forever left wondering if the Sixers were good guys or bad guys) and Flash Forward (so jumbled, I'm not even sure what to pick as what I'm most confused about).So, another apocalyptic ""thriller"" (still waiting for the thrills - I so genuinely use the in quotes sparingly) with the usual good guys/bad guys fighting for life scenario. It has been done and rejected far better as referenced above. But I am an ever hopeful sci fi geek so I'll continue to watch hoping (with fingers crossed) it won't get really good JUST before it gets cancelled, that the characters loosen up with each other and some humor is allowed to flourish (whereupon it gets cancelled) and the writers realize just what their story really is (which also might get it cancelled).Or worst of all, everything starts to get really good in it, I fall in love with it, and it gets cancelled. There just might be a part of me holding back since I think I am getting a complex. If I continue to find this a sort of terrible mish mash of great cancelled sci fi - it will be a big hit for many years of enjoyment for the rest of you and my heart does not get broken again. UPDATE: If the show continues to improve as it did in the last episode, I will soon be a die-hard fan. Be afraid. Be very afraid.UPDATE: APRIL, 2013 - So, the show just came back after a too long break and I almost didn't pick it up because I felt it wasn't as good as I like shows to be. Someone did their homework and these two episodes were like an entirely new show, and way better. The mother's and daughter's characters were especially advanced and worthy of those 4 stars I gave it to begin with. The level of action has been retooled and I found myself, for the first time since it's release, sitting on the edge of my seat throughout much of it. All of the characters appear to have been retooled as well. Let me just say - well done, Mr. Kripke! Having been a fan of Supernatural since he started it, FINALLY we are seeing some exciting sci fi that I expected but felt it lacked from the beginning.

1590811,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B009AMAJBO,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 3]","In the fourth episode of NBC's well-meaning apocalyptic drama Revolution, after listening to a bandit whine about the looters who took the medicine that could have saved his daughter, series lead Charlie Matheson (Tracy Spiridakos) says breathily: ""I'm so sorry. I am. But people just aren't like that anymore.""""They've always been like that,"" he growls back, staring through brows heavy and grey with years of loss.Bonhoeffer noted, decades ago, that humans cannot comprehend true beginnings, because we seek what came before. Creation ex nihilo evades our limited thinking. The same applies to ends. Science fiction has long traded on post-apocalyptic scenarios, because we always believe that something must come next. But our expectations about that succession have grown distinctly more bleak in recent years.Though set fifteen years after a long-unexplained catastrophe caused electricity to fail worldwide, apparently taking hydrocarbons with it, Revolution depicts a world in which anarchy reigns. Feral dogs and roving rapist wolfpacks make overland travel a fatal proposition, and the ad hoc government is little better than a well-armed street gang. Charlie's exchange with her bandit could serve as a thesis for the show.This makes a radical change from past apocalypses. Movies like ""The Terminator"" and books like Stephen King's ""The Stand"" may not showcase the best in human nature, but they show people organizing some form of civil order. Revolution, by contrast, indicates that only our glossy technology stands between humankind and our base impulses. Light bulbs and TV, not the social contract, keep us from killing each other, implies creator Eric Kripke.In the pilot episode, the heroine and her family live in a circle of houses apparently built around a small cul-de-sac. Inside is so safe that children run and play in the former traffic circle, but outside, soldiers and bandits rove freely. Charlie's father and his common-law wife repeatedly lecture her on why the world is dangerous and offers nothing she could want. It's the suburban white parental terror come true: if you wander off our street, somebody will kill you.Therein lies the problem: though Earth has suffered changes that should transform civilization, Kripke offers only a caricature of today's world. And not even today's world, but what comfy white Americans stereotypically think of as today's world. From a bucolic nucleus of rural truck patches, the characters venture into cities that are not meccas of opportunity, but decaying cesspits. Nothing shields the clean, Caucasian countryside from the cities but miles of trackless waste.In this world, everybody you meet has your harm in mind. Parents have always cautioned children about strangers, but kids learn that most people behave honorably if given the chance. Here, though, your mama's worst warnings prove true: literally everyone Charlie meets when venturing away from home wants to kill, rape, or rob her. Only well-placed violence keeps her alive.Freud, in ""Civilization and Its Discontents,"" asserted that humans must learn, from parents, states, churches, and others, not to indulge our desires for domination through violence and sex. This thesis is roundly rejected by current psychologists, yet remains influential in pop culture. This series takes that further, implying that nobody is teaching our kids to restrain themselves. Take away our electronic distractions, and our animal sides will run wild.Beneath this bleak present, the characters keep glancing over their shoulders at the past. An enigmatic artifact evidently restores electricity (from where? Don't overthink things), and the monomaniacal general running the East Coast strives to turn the power back on. A band of rebels wants to ""bring back the United States."" These characters seek solace, not from what they can build, but from rebuilding what others already tore down.This longing for the status quo ante reflects a certain brand of American conservatism. Not the principled conservatism of George Will and Bill Buckley, but the reactionary reflexivity of believing that things used to be good, and now they're not. By excoriating the decadence of the present, and lionizing the idealized past, Kripke showcases a vision of America that says only: we used to be better than we are.In the 1990s, The X-Files taught that two zealots could ""fight the future."" In Revolution, it's too late. The Disaster is already upon us. The transition is much broader than two titles (witness the gulf between ""Terminator 2"" and ""Terminator 3""), and it's risky to attach cause and effect, but differing apocalypses in different decades speak to wild, rapid changes in Americans' view of ourselves and our prospects.",2,The End Of Everything Ain't What It Used To Be,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,4737,"['fourth', 'episode',

1590812,ACVKFV8LD7HDH,B009AMAJBO,K. Geddings,"[0, 1]",Im giving it three stars instead of 4 mainly just because of the over use of action and violence.  I felt from the very first episode that it was just too much action oriented.  sure star trek/stargate etc had that too but not as much as this series does. i get it there in a battle and all but still.....and honestly i want more scenes of charecter interactions those are the best parts. the fighting. meh its ok...but i mean. the best parts are when you have the moments between charecters and such that progress the story and there just isnt quite as much as that.the very first episode honestly i wanted to see more of what happend after the power went out. the flashbacks are cool but they are few and (more so in the later episodes) far and in between.  I'll keep watching it more because my girlfriend likes it (heh which is odd eh youd think it be the other way around) but yeah....and its a bit tough as they keep killing off charecters i know that happens sometimes but its hard to get attached to a charecter if he may end up getting killed.the final episode this season was pretty good but honestly i think[spoilers here:]  I think they turned the lights on way too soon. its only the first season.  the whole point of the series is surviving in a world without power and now that the power is back on (and also how does the power magically turn back on?  these power plants havent been used in 15 years.. they have to be manned by actual people how was it that magically you flip the switch and now suddenly the power comes back on after 15 years you know?)sorry to me thats just a huge thing....so great the powers back on and there going to nuke two of the cities great... so now what?  honestly im not really sure if i would have been that sad if this was the only season. honestly its kinda over in that sence.  the whole premise of the show is now gone.  powers back on..so what?  now they all going to nuke each other into oblivion?i would have liked more charecter moments. more development that way....its ok.  but think i still like the stargate series better!not a show to watch with your family . and the thing is doesnt have much sex or anything like that (only one scene which didnt show much) and not much cursing. its just oh my god do they really have to have that much fighting?sighs.,3,Pretty good.. could be better some lose holes and way too much violence,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2314,"['Im', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', '4', 'mainly', 'just', 'over', 'use', 'action', 'violence', 'felt', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'oriented', 'sure', 'star', 'trek/stargate', 'etc', 'had', 'too', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'series', 'i', 'get', 'there', 'battle', 'still', '..and', 'honestly', 'i', 'want', 'more', 'scenes', 'charecter', 'interactions', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'fighting', 'meh', 'ok', 'i', 'mean', 'best', 'parts', 'are', 'when', 'have', 'moments', 'charecters', 'such', 'progress', 'story', 'there', 'just', 'isnt', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'that.the', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'honestly', 'i', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'happend', 'power', 'went', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'cool', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'so', 'later', 'episodes', 'far', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'more', 'girlfriend', 'heh', 'odd', 'eh', 'youd', 'think', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'yeah', '.and', 'bit', 'tough', 'keep', 'killing', 'off', 'charecters', 'i', 'know', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'get', 'attached', 'charecter', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'killed.the', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'honestly', 'i', 'think', '[', 'spoilers', 'here', ']', 'think', 'turned', 'lights', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'only', 'first', 'season', 'whole', 'point', 'series', 'surviving', 'world', 'power', 'now', 'power', 'back', 'also', 'how', 'power', 'magically', 'turn', 'back', 'power', 'plants', 'havent', 'been', 'used', '15', 'years..', 'have', 'be', 'manned', 'actual', 'people', 'how', 'was', 'magically', 'flip', 'switch', 'now', 'suddenly', 'power', 'back', '15', 'years', 'know', 'sorry', 'thats', 'just', 'huge', 'thing', '.so', 'great', 'powers', 'back', 'going', 'nuke', 'two', 'cities', 'great', 'so', 'now', 'what', 'honestly', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sad', 'was', 'only', 'season', 'honestly', 'kinda', 'sence', 'whole', 'premise', 'show', 'now', 'gone', 'powers', 'back', 'on..so', 'what', 'now', 'going', 'nuke', 'other', 'oblivion', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'charecter', 'moments', 'more', 'development', 'way', 'ok.', 'think', 'i', 'still', 'stargate', 'series', 'better', 'not', 'show', 'watch', 'family', 'thing', 'doesnt', 'have', 'much', 'sex', 'anything', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'show', 'much', 'not', 'much', 'cursing', 'just', 'oh', 'god', 'do', 'really', 'have', 'have', 'much', 'fighting', 'sighs']",Revolution: Season 1

1590817,A30GDJPDPHZRT7,B009AMAJBO,Mark E. Martin,"[0, 1]","I may be a picker of nits but, hey, Amazon asked what I thought.Revolutions is a fairly well written post-apocalyptic drama based on the mysterious end of all things electrical. Whatever happened flew in the face of physics and could not be undone by whoever had the intelligence to deal with such things. Among those who may or may not have had the ability to undo the damage is a man, his wife and two children, and the husband's brother. These five form the core of the &#34;good guys&#34; though the brother / uncle is ambiguous in his goodness / badness.The story starts 15 years after the power went out so we're spared the escape from the downfall of society for the most part. There are plenty of other series / films whose focus is exactly that; if you're looking for how things fall apart watch &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; or others of that ilk.We do get glimpses of the fall when the writers feel the need to explain the back story on some of the characters, particularly the bad guys and the ambiguous uncle. I rather like this treatment as it provides enough story but doesn't dwell on the seemingly necessary brutality. Again, if you're looking for that, see &#34;The Walking Dead.&#34;The acting is okay if not particularly strong or compelling. I'm a little distracted by the all too tidy clothing, hair, and beards of the cast; you'd think the end of civilization as we know it would mean dirty clothing, uncut hair, and untrimmed beards but you'd be wrong. I'm not expecting &#34;The Road&#34; level of filth but, come on, everything run on electricity stops and everyone somehow keeps their clothing clean, their hair fashionable, and their beards (of which there are few) neatly trimmed? It's a small but glaring problem for me.I haven't finished the first season but probably will.

1590818,A3G4BFD7FN8VF1,B009AMAJBO,Marvin Powell,"[21, 31]","""Revolution"" is horrendous for so many reasons. Kind of like ""The Event"" and ""The Cape"", only those shows had better premises and bigger stars. This show's only REAL drawing point is establishing questions to ""hook"" the viewer in for next week. However, it raises more questions than it ever answers, which is a gamble even for shows with GOOD writing and characters, which this lacks.""Why doesn't the element of electricity work, at all? No solar or wind or hydro power. No ability to rub a carpet and create a spark with a balloon? Why do the militia use old guns, from the pre-Revolutionary war? Guns have nothing to do with electricity, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of modern guns in America right NOW. And HOW does no one in America have guns anymore, but they all have crossbows and swords? (At least, they could've gave us a lazy explanation, like the Militia has bigger guns or more bullets, or people ran out of bullets or something.) Why don't bicycles exist? Everyone uses horses, as if bikes aren't an option. Why is everyone so clean and attractive? And not just themselves, but their clothes, too? Most of the young post-Apocalyptic survivors look better in a world with no electricity or running water than people do in the real world with both. Not even so much as a scar or gritty work hands. Where is our Katniss clone, Charlie, getting all this shampoo, soap, makeup, and stain-free clothing from? How could the government so easily collapse? You'd think, in times of crisis, they'd become MORE powerful and controlling.""None of these questions are ever answered or even brought up. Plus, just like the worse flaw of ""The Event,"" there are NO likable characters. The obnoxious little brother who gets his dad killed and thinks he can do whatever he wants is the worst one, yet. He's just such an obnoxious teenager, yet he's supposed to be a guy we root for 'just because.' The militia general (played by Giancarlo Esposito) is the only character with any depth, unlike the Hero Girl who, like her brother, is too stupid and disobedient to believably survive this world. Or the ""badass for badass sakes"" generic anti-hero, Uncle Miles. The former Technology mogul WOULD be the only other interesting character, if the show ever bothered to give him a backstory. The problem with all the characters and lack of character development is, the show just sort of tells you ""These are the good guys. Root for them. These are the bad guys. Boo them"" without ever really giving us any reason to. At least Miles has a backstory of being a Marine, but we're supposed to honestly believe Charlie is such a great heroine, when she's dumb enough to disobey her father like a bratty teenager in a dangerous post-apocalyptic world full of looters and militia, and then, gets all surprised when he's killed in said world? No. She's the least believable heroine or protagonist I've seen in a long time, and actually makes you want to side with the militia, more.I know this is a long rant, but out of all the Fall 2012 shows, this and ""The Mindy Project"" are the only ones I hate the least to keep watching. But still, ""Revolution"" is just so amateurish, with unlikable characters and a premise that gets dumber by the week, it makes me sad to think NBC intentionally puts crap like this on their network over shows like ""Community"" and ""Harry's Law."" And while ""The Cape"" was 'So Bad, It's Kinda Good' in it's writing, while also featuring well known stars, and ""The Event"" had a more compelling premise (but also, no likable characters), and ""Terra Nova"" on FOX also had a better premise and much more Sci Fi to it, ""Revolution"" has none of these things and the only literal reason to keep watching is because it's on TV. And well, Monday nights kinda suck anyway, with mostly only Reality Shows aimed at women over 30.But, yeah. Revolution is worse than all the big Epic shows before it. But NBC isn't exactly laissez faire with their viewers. They'll continue to put out crap, almost with the intention of torturing it's ever-decreasing watchers. ""The Office"" has jumped the shark ever since Carell left and ""30 Rock"" and ""Community"" are almost dead. That just leaves 'SVU' and ""Grimm"" as NBC's only good shows left after the 2012-2013 TV season. Unless they accidentally stumble upon another good show, like ""Grimm."" But it's unlikely. ""Revolution"" will be gone before you know it, like Terra Nova and The Event, so ""enjoy"" it while it lasts, even if it is sucktastic.",2,"2012-2013's Required Failure ""Epic""",1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,4492,"['Revolution', 'horrendous', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'Kind', 'Event', 'Cape', 'only', 'shows', 'had', 'better', 'premises', 'bigger', 'stars', 'show', 'only', 'REAL', 'drawing', 'point', 'establishing', 'questions', 'hook', 'viewer', 'next', 'week', 'However', 'more', 'questions', 'ever', 'answers', 'gamble', 'even', 'shows', 'GOOD', 'writing', 'characters', 'Why', ""n't"", 'element', 'electricity', 'work', 'No', 'solar', 'wind', 'hydro', 'power', 'ability', 'rub', 'carpet', 'create', 'spark', 'balloon', 'Why', 'do', 'militia', 'use', 'old', 'guns', 'pre-Revolutionary', 'war', 'Guns', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'electricity', 'are', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'modern', 'guns', 'America', 'right', 'NOW', 'HOW', 'one', 'America', 'have', 'guns', 'anymore', 'have', 'crossbows', 'swords', 'least', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gave', 'lazy', 'explanation', 'Militia', 'bigger', 'guns', 'more', 'bullets', 'people', 'ran', 'bullets', 'something', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'bicycles', 'exist', 'Everyone', 'horses', 'bikes', 'are', ""n't"", 'option', 'Why', 'everyone', 'so', 'clean', 'attractive', 'not', 'just', 'clothes', 'too', 'Most', 'young', 'post-Apocalyptic', 'survivors', 'look', 'better', 'world', 'electricity', 'running', 'water', 'people', 'do', 'real', 'world', 'Not', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'scar', 'gritty', 'work', 'hands', 'Where', 'Katniss', 'clone', 'Charlie', 'getting', 'shampoo', 'soap', 'makeup', 'stain-free', 'clothing', 'How', 'could', 'government', 'so', 'easily', 'collapse', ""'d"", 'think', 'times', 'crisis', ""'d"", 'become', 'MORE', 'powerful', 'controlling', 'None', 'questions', 'are', 'ever', 'answered', 'even', 'brought', 'up', 'just', 'worse', 'flaw', 'Event', 'are', 'NO', 'likable', 'characters', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'dad', 'killed', 'can', 'do', 'whatever', 'worst', 'one', 'yet', 'just', 'such', 'obnoxious', 'teenager', 'supposed', 'be', 'guy', 'root', ""'just"", 'militia', 'general', 'played', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'only', 'character', 'depth', 'Hero', 'Girl', 'who', 'brother', 'too', 'stupid', 'disobedient', 'believably', 'survive', 'world', 'badass', 'badass', 'sakes', 'generic', 'anti-hero', 'Uncle', 'Miles', 'former', 'Technology', 'mogul', 'WOULD', 'be', 'only', 'other', 'interesting', 'character', 'show', 'ever', 'bothered', 'give', 'backstory', 'problem', 'characters', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'show', 'just', 'sort', 'tells', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'Root', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'Boo', 'ever', 'really', 'giving', 'reason', 'least', 'Miles', 'backstory', 'being', 'Marine', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'honestly', 'believe', 'Charlie', 'such', 'great', 'heroine', 'when', 'dumb', 'enough', 'disobey', 'father', 'bratty', 'teenager', 'dangerous', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'full', 'looters', 'militia', 'then', 'surprised', 'when', 'killed', 'said', 'world', 'No', 'least', 'believable', 'heroine', 'protagonist', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'actually', 'want', 'side', 'militia', 'more.I', 'know', 'long', 'rant', 'Fall', '2012', 'Mindy', 'Project', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'hate', 'least', 'keep', 'watching', 'still', 'Revolution', 'just', 'so', 'amateurish', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'premise', 'dumber', 'week', 'sad', 'think', 'NBC', 'intentionally', 'crap', 'network', 'shows', 'Community', 'Harry', 'Law', 'Cape', 'was', 'Bad', 'Kinda', 'Good', 'writing', 'also', 'featuring', 'well', 'known', 'stars', 'Event', 'had', 'more', 'compelling', 'premise', 'also', 'likable', 'characters', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'FOX', 'also', 'had', 'better', 'premise', 'much', 'more', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Revolution', 'none', 'things', 'only', 'literal', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'TV', 'well', 'Monday', 'nights', 'kinda', 'suck', 'anyway', 'mostly', 'only', 'Reality', 'Shows', 'aimed', 'women', '30.But', 'yeah', 'Revolution', 'worse', 'big', 'Epic', 'NBC', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'laissez', 'faire', 'viewers', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'put', 'out', 'crap', 'almost', 'intention', 'torturing', 'ever-decreasing', 'watchers', 'Office', 'jumped', 'shark', 'ever', 'Carell', 'left', '30', 'Rock', 'Community', 'are', 'almost', 'dead', 'just', 'Grimm', 'NBC', 'only', 'good', 'shows', 'left', '2012-2013', 'TV', 'season', 'accidentally', 'stumble', 'good', 'show', 'Grimm', 'unlikely', 'Revolution', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'know', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'Event', 'enjoy', 'even', 'sucktastic']",Revolution: Season 1

That means most technology is gone, or at least, unusuable. Then it sets up a possible conspiracy, then we jump into the future. Much of the story is told via flashbacks, which doesn't make me happy, but it works all right, I guess.There is a ton of 'action' in this, like sword fights and that type of action. It gets a little old, in place of storyline. The acting isn't horrible, but the characters haven't gotten comfortable with themselves yet.The biggest complaint I have right now is that episode after episode, I keep waiting for something to happen. The storyline just isn't moving forward very fast. I want to like this series, I really, really do, but the first season is just really slow. I'm hoping the writers will pick things up in the next season and we'll see more development of the storyline.

Billy Burke has the greatest swashbuckling sword scene I've ever seen--makes you want him as your bodyguard in a dark city street!  The characters are interesting and well played.  I particularly like the use of flashbacks to reveal how MIles got to be who and where he is.  (So far the only flashbacks have been about him and Charlie.)  The niece is kind of a whiny, self-righteous, liberal adolescent, but she has potential--she is learning to do what has to be done when faced with evil.  The pilot was great, the second episode good.  The third shows you a lot about Miles, which is interesting but there's still a touch of the modern trend in sci-fi fantasy---i.e. that the men are all flawed and the sharp mouthed self-righteous women must run the show.  We haven't seen enough of whom I thnk are the two most interesting (and possibly productive) women in the show---Rachel  and Maggie.  Of all the women, I like Maggie the best, she seems to be able to do what needs to be done without cutting down other people.  As a writer, I find MIles the most interesting and best character--and kind of hope he ends up with Maggie.Don't want to give the plot away--watch the show on Amazon.  It is well crafted and even though we know scientifically that an EMP (or whatever it was) would not take out your cars, and that after fifteen years someone should have been able to figure out how to get the power on, but go with the ""willful suspension of disbelief.""

The premise here is pretty simple: through some unknown mechanism, all electrical power becomes inoperative, apparently all over the world. America quickly collapses into near anarchy, with warlords establishing fiefdoms maintained by force and tyranny. The people live at an 18th century level, if that. It is not known why electrical power has stopped working, although there are hints that some technological cause lies at the root of it all.Naturally, there are some inconsistencies in the pilot. First of all, somehow all the women in this new America all look like gorgeous Hollywood actresses. Well, they are, I guess. One might expect that the people would look more like actual 18th Century pioneers, i.e. wrinkled, not particularly clean, hard-bitten, but no. They all look like they just stepped out of a beauty salon. Well, most of us would rather watch a series full of gorgeous women, I suppose. That's what this is.Setting aside the inconsistencies, the pilot has a solid storyline that held my interest and left me wanting more. I am hoping that this series lives up to its potential.

1590864,ATMQEI1LKR6VB,B009AMAJBO,"Shevi ""FantasyWeaver""","[3, 7]","First off, this show is watchable. I like the characters, particularly , teenage crossbow warrior Charlie (the Katniss clone), and former Google mogul Aaron, who often plays the comic relief. There are characters here you can certainly root for. They've lost everything. Charlie just wants to get her family back. She's lost everyone: her mother, her father, and her brother. Her mother gave the responsibility of looking after her younger brother, who suffers from asthma, and so she'll do anything to rescue him. Aaron wants to help her, but mostly he wants to restore the power. As he points out in the episode ""Soul Train,"" in our electronic world, he had power over his own life and didn't have to worry about schoolyard bullies, but now the bullies are in charge. These are characters you can identify with and root for, which is the best thing the show has going for it.Now let's get to the problems with this show and why I think it has the potential to be  just another huge disappointment--or possibly something great.I think the potential for awful is clear. If there's one thing I hate, it's a story where too much is hidden from the audience. That's all that Lost was, a ginormous ball of possibilities that made the audience unable to figure out, well, anything. You couldn't even tell what the show was about. And even when it was over, audiences were left scratching their heads. J.J. Abrams, the creator of Lost, has a hand in this show. What if he's just going to pull the same stunt again?But J.J. Abrams also gave us the wonderful Star Trek, for lack of a better word, remix, and this is where the potential for something great comes in. If this series gels into something similar to Star Trek, it does have the potential for greatness.But how exactly can it do that?We already know it's not by turning this into a true science-fiction series, like Star Trek, one where everything in it can be scientifically explained. The science here is rubbish. As others have pointed out, the only way to stop all electrical devices at once and to prevent them from working again would require a catastrophe so great that it would wipe out the human race. There's no condition under which all cars, batteries, water power, wind power, solar power, and so on would stop and people would still be alive and unharmed. That's just not scientifically possible.However, it's not the science that makes Star Trek amazing; it's the characters and how they work together as a team. It's the same thing that makes the new Avengers movie great. Who cares if Thor is a Norse god and the Hulk got super-strength from radiation, both of which are impossible? If you get great characters working together for a great cause--and you throw in lots of humor and excitement--you will have the makings of a great series.I'm writing this review after viewing the first four episodes. Time will tell if the makers of this series do the smart thing and make this more like Star Trek and less like Lost.How can they do that?They can stop hiding information from the audience. Pick a premise (maybe it's magic or alien technology that's causing all electricity to stop working), let your audience know what your premise is, put all your good guys on the same side working together for a common cause (remove the moral ambiguity, which only prevents the audience from caring about your characters, a huge no-no), throw in lots of humor, and you will have a great show.Otherwise, you're just wasting out time. Again.The choice is yours, J.J. Abrams and company. I hope you make the right one for the show's sake, as well as ours.",4,"Revolution has the potential to be great, but only if...",1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,3610,"['First', 'off', 'show', 'watchable', 'characters', 'particularly', 'teenage', 'crossbow', 'warrior', 'Charlie', 'Katniss', 'clone', 'former', 'Google', 'mogul', 'Aaron', 'who', 'often', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'characters', 'here', 'can', 'certainly', 'root', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'everything', 'Charlie', 'just', 'get', 'family', 'back', 'lost', 'everyone', 'mother', 'father', 'brother', 'mother', 'gave', 'responsibility', 'looking', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'asthma', 'so', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'rescue', 'Aaron', 'help', 'mostly', 'restore', 'power', 'out', 'episode', 'Soul', 'Train', 'electronic', 'world', 'had', 'power', 'own', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'about', 'schoolyard', 'bullies', 'now', 'bullies', 'are', 'charge', 'are', 'characters', 'can', 'identify', 'root', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'going', 'it.Now', 'let', 'get', 'problems', 'show', 'why', 'think', 'potential', 'be', 'just', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'possibly', 'something', 'great.I', 'think', 'potential', 'awful', 'clear', 'one', 'thing', 'hate', 'story', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'hidden', 'audience', 'Lost', 'was', 'ginormous', 'ball', 'possibilities', 'made', 'audience', 'unable', 'figure', 'out', 'well', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'about', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'audiences', 'were', 'left', 'scratching', 'heads', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'Lost', 'hand', 'show', 'What', 'just', 'going', 'pull', 'same', 'stunt', 'again', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'also', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'Star', 'Trek', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'remix', 'where', 'potential', 'something', 'great', 'series', 'something', 'similar', 'Star', 'Trek', 'have', 'potential', 'greatness.But', 'how', 'exactly', 'can', 'do', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'turning', 'true', 'science-fiction', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'one', 'where', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'scientifically', 'explained', 'science', 'here', 'rubbish', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'only', 'way', 'stop', 'electrical', 'devices', 'once', 'prevent', 'working', 'again', 'would', 'require', 'catastrophe', 'so', 'great', 'would', 'wipe', 'out', 'human', 'race', 'condition', 'cars', 'batteries', 'water', 'power', 'wind', 'power', 'solar', 'power', 'so', 'would', 'stop', 'people', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'unharmed', 'just', 'not', 'scientifically', 'possible.However', 'not', 'science', 'Star', 'Trek', 'amazing', 'characters', 'how', 'work', 'together', 'team', 'same', 'thing', 'new', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'great', 'Who', 'Thor', 'Norse', 'god', 'Hulk', 'got', 'super-strength', 'radiation', 'are', 'impossible', 'get', 'great', 'characters', 'working', 'together', 'great', 'cause', 'throw', 'lots', 'humor', 'excitement', 'will', 'have', 'makings', 'great', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'viewing', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'Time', 'will', 'tell', 'makers', 'series', 'do', 'smart', 'thing', 'make', 'more', 'Star', 'Trek', 'less', 'Lost.How', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'stop', 'hiding', 'information', 'audience', 'Pick', 'premise', 'magic', 'alien', 'technology', 'causing', 'electricity', 'stop', 'working', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'premise', 'put', 'good', 'guys', 'same', 'side', 'working', 'together', 'common', 'cause', 'remove', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'only', 'audience', 'caring', 'characters', 'huge', 'no-no', 'throw', 'lots', 'humor', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'show.Otherwise', ""'re"", 'just', 'wasting', 'out', 'time', 'Again.The', 'choice', 'yours', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'company', 'hope', 'make', 'right', 'one', 'show', 'sake', 'as', 'well', 'ours']",Revolution: Season 1
1590865,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B009AMAJBO,Steven Herring,"[0, 1]","Revolution is a story about people. The over-arching theme is a world without power, but the main focus are the characters. Every single one of them is well developed and enjoyable to watch. Even Charlie who tends to get a bad rap from the fans is an detailed character and played expertly by Tracy Spiradakos. The characters banter back and forth makes the sometimes stationary plot seem to move on even if it isn't. The series does suffer from being in a singular overall story of going after Charlie's brother. The individual plot points are interesting as the group tries to save Danny. Many roadblocks pop up with extra emotional baggage for these characters. As they lean on each other they learn more about themselves and the ones they fight alongside.The characters and their dialogue is well written, witty, and smart. The actors do a great job and every one of them feel very natural in their role. The relationship between Miles and Charlie is the highlight of the series and is perfection. Also the villains and their motives are well done and even understandable which is the staple of a great series. Every character even the villains are given flashbacks that show their life pre-blackout which gives them much more depth than normal characters on Network TV.This series like JJ Abram's other forays into TV is rooted in mystery. Why did the world suddenly lose the ability to use power is the main mystery in the first season. Many of the questions that are asked in the first season are answered. That is right before a plethora of others are created to keep the second season humming.The violence in the series is also a high point. Never does it become too gruesome, but it does have a realism that is refreshing in a network series. Miles cuts up guys left and right with that sword and it is always thrilling. The Blu ray itself looks amazing. It is near perfect HD quality with great facial detail and environmental depth. The sound gets the job done and keeps the dialogue crisp and clear.

And its a highly intriguing premise.  What would I do if the power went out forever? At least that's what I sit and ponder during this show.However, I am a bit sad.  JJ Abrams is great at what he does.  Lost I think a lot of us will admit was a highly intoxicating show.  However after watching this entire first season I've come to discover that after watching Lost, Abrams really no longer has any tricks up his sleeve.  Even worse this show is strangely identical to Lost.  Almost a deformed twin brother of the hit show.  The same flashbacks like they did in Lost, the same odd never knowing who a character really is plots.Where Lost was unpredictable, Revolution has become well predictable.  The true mark of a creative genius isn't to change colors but keep the same design but to design something completely new and as awe inspiring as his last.  And with Revolution I have discovered Abrams just doesn't fit the bill, all he is doing is recycling a successful plot line, changing up the scenery and backstory and switching a few actors and names around and voila! New show.With that rant out of the way, I do have admit I enjoyed this show.  The idea behind is enough to make me watch, and even though I'm annoyed with Abrams for using his old tricks from Lost, I do have to admit I'm anxiously awaiting to find out more about Clara and the guy that took her.
