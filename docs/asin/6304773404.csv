435462,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304773404,Austin Somlo,"[1, 3]","Viewed: 12/08, 7/11Rate: 812/08: Masquerade is a wonderful mysterious picture starring Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly. There are so many outsmart-the-audience twists that I kept trying to foresee but couldn't. I am pleased with the results although I am disappointed when I found out that Masquerade wasn't going to be a romantic picture involving a couple dealing with a small problem. Thinking of that, why not the producers do two versions of Masquerade: the one I had seen and the one just purely for love story purpose since the chemistry between Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly is just flawless? That would be so groundbreaking. As always, Meg Tilly is a natural because no matter how little she tries, she is just perfect albeit beautiful for the screen. She makes acting to look easy, and the story works very well around her. Why not pair Meg Tilly up with James Spader in a similar film like he always gets involved with? On the other hand, Rob Lowe is too damned handsome in Masquerade that he could have bedded a million of women all over the world based solely on his performance. Couldn't he look any more perfect? In it, Rob Lowe doesn't have to try hard in his acting ability, and what he did is plenty enough which makes him a great underrated actor. The story behind Masquerade is a hugely pleasant surprise, and I enjoy how the mystery unfolded. Although I am let down that Rob Lowe's character wasn't allowed to be a natural lover since I believe his feelings for his wife were deeply affectionate, I feel redeemed at the end which made the film all worth it. Really, when Tim Whalen shoots the stepfather, there is absolutely no reason to cover up the incident because what he did is purely done in self-defense. I would have loved it if the producers could have focused on the romantic aspect the rest of the way because the cinematography was holding up so well along with the wonderful chemistry between Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly. In a way, Masquerade is like Body Heat meets Reversal of Fortune. All in all, Masquerade is a delicious treat with many twists and turns that put the game of Labyrinth into shame.7/11: Bad Boy Rob Lowe puts men to shame by sporting the look of a very hairless, tanned body. And he makes Masquerade to work. Of course, the plot makes it all worth it, and I actually enjoy it. Meg Tilly is watchable as well and displays good effort for acting. It's the twists and turns that got me interested and engaged to the end, and I like the surprise ending a lot because at first, it's apparent that Tim Whalen was the bad guy, and afterwards, it's like...well, he seemed to be a nice man after all. I love the scenery settings of the Hamptons; it's like being inside of the Rich and the Shameless. And remember, this is before Reversal of Fortune was made. All in all, no matter what, Masquerade is a very worthy film to watch. Unfortunately, I am dropping the rating from `10' to `8'.",4,Bad Boy Rob Lowe Makes Men Melt with Jealousy.,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,2911,"['Viewed', '12/08', '7/11Rate', '812/08', 'Masquerade', 'wonderful', 'mysterious', 'picture', 'starring', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'outsmart-the-audience', 'twists', 'kept', 'trying', 'foresee', 'could', ""n't"", 'am', 'pleased', 'results', 'am', 'disappointed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Masquerade', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'romantic', 'picture', 'involving', 'couple', 'dealing', 'small', 'problem', 'Thinking', 'why', 'not', 'producers', 'do', 'two', 'versions', 'Masquerade', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'one', 'just', 'purely', 'love', 'story', 'purpose', 'chemistry', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'just', 'flawless', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'groundbreaking', 'always', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'natural', 'matter', 'how', 'little', 'just', 'perfect', 'albeit', 'beautiful', 'screen', 'acting', 'look', 'easy', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'Why', 'not', 'pair', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'up', 'James', 'Spader', 'similar', 'film', 'always', 'involved', 'other', 'hand', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'too', 'damned', 'handsome', 'Masquerade', 'could', 'have', 'bedded', 'million', 'women', 'world', 'based', 'solely', 'performance', 'Could', ""n't"", 'look', 'more', 'perfect', 'Rob', 'Lowe', ""n't"", 'have', 'try', 'hard', 'acting', 'ability', 'what', 'did', 'plenty', 'enough', 'great', 'underrated', 'actor', 'story', 'Masquerade', 'hugely', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'enjoy', 'how', 'mystery', 'unfolded', 'am', 'let', 'down', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'be', 'natural', 'lover', 'believe', 'feelings', 'wife', 'were', 'deeply', 'affectionate', 'feel', 'redeemed', 'end', 'made', 'film', 'Really', 'when', 'Tim', 'Whalen', 'shoots', 'stepfather', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'cover', 'up', 'incident', 'what', 'did', 'purely', 'done', 'self-defense', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'rest', 'way', 'cinematography', 'was', 'holding', 'up', 'so', 'well', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'way', 'Masquerade', 'Body', 'Heat', 'Reversal', 'Fortune', 'Masquerade', 'delicious', 'treat', 'many', 'twists', 'put', 'game', 'Labyrinth', 'shame.7/11', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'men', 'shame', 'sporting', 'look', 'very', 'hairless', 'tanned', 'body', 'work', 'course', 'plot', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'watchable', 'as', 'well', 'displays', 'good', 'effort', 'acting', 'twists', 'got', 'interested', 'engaged', 'end', 'like', 'surprise', 'ending', 'lot', 'first', 'apparent', 'Tim', 'Whalen', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'afterwards', 'well', 'seemed', 'be', 'nice', 'man', 'love', 'scenery', 'settings', 'Hamptons', 'being', 'Rich', 'Shameless', 'remember', 'Reversal', 'Fortune', 'was', 'made', 'matter', 'what', 'Masquerade', 'very', 'worthy', 'film', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'am', 'dropping', 'rating', '10', '8']",Masquerade VHS

435466,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,6304773404,Carlisle Wheeling,"[1, 3]","No kidding.  Everything you've ever seen in a Lifetime movie is in this one.  Poor little rich girl Olivia Lawrence (Meg Tilly) is lonely after the loss of her mother and stuck living with her leech of a father-in-law (John Glover) who is parading his mistress (Dana Delaney) freely about their mansion.  Enter Tim Whalen (Rob Lowe) a sailing drifter with a dark past who is scheming with her father-in-law to get the 200 million she's inherited and kill her.  Whalen is also fooling around with his boss's wife (Kim Cattrall) on the side and Olivia has the obsessive affections of the local cop she grew up with (Doug Savant) to contend with.All this fun reaches murderous proportions in the vein of movies like Bad Influence, Mother May I Sleep with Danger, etc..  Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it's also so far fetched and somewhat predictable that it's quite campy and unintentionally funny.  The dialog is pretty hilarious, as if it was written by an aspiring junior high novelist, and we have to be honest:  Meg Tilly is a good actress, but she is no beauty.  She would have to play somebody rich, or a guy who looks like Lowe would never give her the time of day.

Throughout the film there are some twists as the story evolves. Unfortunately the main lesson is that money truly can be the route to all evil. It is a painful lesson but also I rated the movie only 3 stars because I felt the overall tone of the film was so cynical and I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending. It seemed rather anticlimactic especially when all of the deceit was exposed. There are some familiar tv stars you'll see throughout the film when they were much younger. Kim Cattrall, Doug Savant and Dana Delaney to name a few. By the way, I disagree with the other reviewer saying that the film is too sexually explicit. It doesn't even come close to Basic Instinct which also shares an R rating. The R rating here is appropriate and its a normal amount of sex. This is also more of a psychological thriller so the violence is minimum. There are a few ""thrills"" but nothing too heavy. You can see more violence on any typical modern day cop show.

Nor will it keep you awake pondering the philosophical implications.But it's a good movie!  It starts out with beautiful shots of yachts racing in the Atlantic with gorgeous Rob Lowe at the helm.  Then it moves quickly to (gorgeous) Rob Lowe in bed with  Kim Cattrel, showing it all as usual, who plays the wife of the yacht's owner.  Rob does show some hint of a conscience at the betrayal when he mentions that his boss/her husband trusts him.  However it doesn't slow down the action.Next we see the virginal looking Meg Tilly, graduating from some Catholic institution, shaking hands with the Bishop.  She wears a gold cross during the whole movie and we learn that she is very, very rich.  Then, at a dance Lowe is introduced to Tilly, while her evil step father, drunk as usual, leers at them from the bar.  Hmmmm...How is this all going to play out?Oh, I forgot, the blond, square-jawed cop who fell in love with Tilly at age 12, and seems not to have given up that dream.  Again....how are these characters all going to interact to give us a good show?The script is fast and clever with many twists and turns.  I won't give it away. All the actors do a good job.  Meg Tilly has the kind of face that can look very bland and boring, especially in the beginning when she's wearing her rich preppy girl outfits and one wonders if the hyper handsome Rob Lowe character could really prefer her to the sultry Kim Cattrall.  But Tilly perks up when she's in love and looks quite beautiful in the later scenes, especially in a black dress where she makes Cattrall look dowdy.I can't give it five stars because the plot is too improbable, but if you just look at it as a good show with  pretty people, beautiful scenery, appropriately scary music and a lot of surprises, then you should enjoy it.",4,Good B Movie,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1872,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'land', 'anyone', 'list', 'Best', 'Films', 'ever', 'made', 'will', 'keep', 'awake', 'pondering', 'philosophical', 'implications.But', 'good', 'movie', 'out', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'yachts', 'racing', 'Atlantic', 'gorgeous', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'helm', 'Then', 'quickly', 'gorgeous', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'bed', 'Kim', 'Cattrel', 'showing', 'usual', 'who', 'wife', 'yacht', 'owner', 'Rob', 'show', 'hint', 'conscience', 'betrayal', 'when', 'boss/her', 'husband', 'However', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'action.Next', 'see', 'virginal', 'looking', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'graduating', 'Catholic', 'institution', 'shaking', 'hands', 'Bishop', 'gold', 'cross', 'whole', 'movie', 'learn', 'very', 'very', 'rich', 'Then', 'dance', 'Lowe', 'introduced', 'Tilly', 'evil', 'step', 'father', 'drunk', 'usual', 'leers', 'bar', 'Hmmmm', 'How', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'blond', 'square-jawed', 'cop', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Tilly', 'age', '12', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'dream', 'Again', '.how', 'are', 'characters', 'going', 'interact', 'give', 'good', 'show', 'script', 'fast', 'clever', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'kind', 'face', 'can', 'look', 'very', 'bland', 'boring', 'especially', 'beginning', 'when', 'wearing', 'rich', 'preppy', 'girl', 'outfits', 'one', 'wonders', 'hyper', 'handsome', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'character', 'could', 'really', 'prefer', 'sultry', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Tilly', 'up', 'when', 'love', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'later', 'scenes', 'especially', 'black', 'dress', 'where', 'Cattrall', 'look', 'dowdy.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'plot', 'too', 'improbable', 'just', 'look', 'good', 'show', 'pretty', 'people', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'appropriately', 'scary', 'music', 'lot', 'surprises', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy']",Masquerade VHS
435474,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6304773404,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 8]","Meg Tilly plays Olivia, a milquetoast of an heiress who may be in mortal danger in ""Masquerade"".  Set among the rich and their tony sea-side mansions in the Hamptons, the story has Tilly as a softspoken yet beset heiress sharing a barely amicable existence with her wicked stepfather (John Glover) and his uh..witchy girlfriend. Olivia knows that millions are tied to her remaining alive, but she remains too innocent almost to the end of the movie - soothing herself by sailing her small boat on Long Island Sound (or is it the Atlantic?).  Though often falling back for help on a childhood friend who now works as a local area cop (Doug Savant), she manages to find love with an impoverished charmer played by Rob Lowe.Is Lowe really in love with her?  What is her stepfather up to?  Can Savant protect Tilly?  Unfortunately, while full of details, Masquerade never builds up suspense because it cashes in its chips too soon - the script has mysterious events remove potential threats to Olivia's existence, whether it's Glover or a very pre-""Sex and the City"" Kim Catrall.  By the middle of the movie, Lowe remains the only possible avenue of danger, but the thin script gives him no chemistry with Tilly.  The final twist seems perfunctory - it is a surprise, but by then, who cares?  It's a shame because we can see how Lowe and Tilly are trying to break out of the meaninglessness of their roles.",3,Good leads masked by a thin story,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,1402,"['Meg', 'Tilly', 'Olivia', 'milquetoast', 'heiress', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'mortal', 'danger', 'Masquerade', 'Set', 'rich', 'tony', 'sea-side', 'mansions', 'Hamptons', 'story', 'Tilly', 'softspoken', 'yet', 'beset', 'heiress', 'sharing', 'barely', 'amicable', 'existence', 'wicked', 'stepfather', 'John', 'Glover', 'uh..witchy', 'girlfriend', 'Olivia', 'millions', 'are', 'tied', 'remaining', 'alive', 'too', 'innocent', 'almost', 'end', 'movie', 'soothing', 'sailing', 'small', 'boat', 'Long', 'Island', 'Sound', 'Atlantic', 'Though', 'often', 'falling', 'back', 'help', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'now', 'local', 'area', 'cop', 'Doug', 'Savant', 'find', 'love', 'impoverished', 'charmer', 'played', 'Rob', 'Lowe.Is', 'Lowe', 'really', 'love', 'What', 'stepfather', 'Can', 'Savant', 'protect', 'Tilly', 'Unfortunately', 'full', 'details', 'Masquerade', 'never', 'up', 'suspense', 'chips', 'too', 'soon', 'script', 'mysterious', 'events', 'remove', 'potential', 'threats', 'Olivia', 'existence', 'Glover', 'very', 'pre-', 'Sex', 'City', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'middle', 'movie', 'Lowe', 'only', 'possible', 'avenue', 'danger', 'thin', 'script', 'chemistry', 'Tilly', 'final', 'twist', 'perfunctory', 'surprise', 'then', 'who', 'shame', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Lowe', 'Tilly', 'are', 'trying', 'break', 'meaninglessness', 'roles']",Masquerade VHS
435475,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,6304773404,S. T. Peterson,"[0, 1]",Good looking young boating guy (Lowe) teams up with the rich in the Hamptons to help them win boating competitions or whatever. He is having affaires with the men's wives and dating their daughters. A murder plot (or two) ensue as he (and others) try to get rich). There are twists in the twists (the masquerades) that are supposed surprise you.Just another movie to take people's money and not entertain them. I can remember that the big selling point back then when this movie came out was that you got to see Rob Lowe's naked rear. Big deal. Who wants to waste their hard earned money and life on something like that? Also the first . . . probably 40 minutes . . . of the movie was about nothing. You hardly got into the movie. And by the time you did you saw it was lazy writing and boring. The helpless rich girl was not someone you sympathized with. You see her sweating like an animal in bed with Lowe on their first date. You see her turning down the good looking supposedly do-gooder town cop she grew up with because she is aching for the bad boy. She is the one that instinctively comes up with the way to hide the murder. She isn't helpless. Lowe comes across as sleazy. For whatever reason when he opens his mouth that baby face look melts. And of course you have that &#34;great actress&#34; Kim Catrell running around with her boobs hanging out. To me this just seems like a string of scenes. There is no connection between them but the characters. It is like they showed up to shoot the scene and then went about their lives until the next day to shoot that one. And I think the director was half interested in making a movie. Anyway it appears that way. It was just a yawner.,2,another 80s b movie,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1692,"['Good', 'looking', 'young', 'boating', 'guy', 'Lowe', 'up', 'rich', 'Hamptons', 'help', 'win', 'boating', 'competitions', 'having', 'affaires', 'men', 'wives', 'dating', 'daughters', 'murder', 'plot', 'two', 'ensue', 'others', 'try', 'get', 'rich', 'are', 'twists', 'twists', 'masquerades', 'are', 'supposed', 'surprise', 'you.Just', 'movie', 'take', 'people', 'money', 'not', 'entertain', 'can', 'remember', 'big', 'selling', 'point', 'back', 'then', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'got', 'see', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'naked', 'rear', 'Big', 'deal', 'Who', 'waste', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'life', 'something', 'Also', 'first', 'probably', '40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'hardly', 'got', 'movie', 'time', 'did', 'saw', 'was', 'lazy', 'writing', 'boring', 'helpless', 'rich', 'girl', 'was', 'not', 'someone', 'sympathized', 'see', 'sweating', 'animal', 'bed', 'Lowe', 'first', 'date', 'see', 'turning', 'down', 'good', 'looking', 'supposedly', 'do-gooder', 'town', 'cop', 'grew', 'up', 'aching', 'bad', 'boy', 'one', 'instinctively', 'up', 'way', 'hide', 'murder', ""n't"", 'helpless', 'Lowe', 'sleazy', 'reason', 'when', 'mouth', 'baby', 'face', 'look', 'melts', 'course', 'have', '34', 'great', 'actress', '34', 'Kim', 'Catrell', 'running', 'around', 'boobs', 'hanging', 'out', 'just', 'string', 'scenes', 'connection', 'characters', 'showed', 'up', 'shoot', 'scene', 'then', 'went', 'lives', 'next', 'day', 'shoot', 'one', 'think', 'director', 'was', 'half', 'interested', 'making', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'yawner']",Masquerade VHS
