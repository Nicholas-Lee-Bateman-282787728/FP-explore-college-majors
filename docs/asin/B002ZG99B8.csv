Indeed the story could have been better and if I was choosing actors, I wouldn't choose so many of those actors that I saw in the movie.

There was no clarification on the special vision that the Green Hornet and his sidekick used. I made many guesses, just to find myself there without any real answer.

Real, live people... check. 3D... check. Great... lets watch. First of all I thought it was a special effect when the movie started, using only a narrow (half a screen) slit. The 3D is fantastic so I thought the slit effect had to be to draw attention to the titles or characters. But no!!! It stayed that way, reducing the ""stellar"" 3D down to ""is it still in 3D""?... yes I think so. Wow... ok, maybe the story is going to be great. Guys and Gals... I never describe movies this way... but, ""this film blows... chunks"". Sorry there is just no other words I can use. If you haven't purchased this movie yet... do yourself a favor and rent it (in 3D) first. You will save yourself some cash and stop the embarrassment of your friends knowing you own a copy.

Seth Rogen was efficient in mixing drama with humor, but the real star was Jay Chou as Kato! Britt Reid (Rogen) may be the main hero, but Chou owned this movie! Christoph Waltz (who took his hokiness to an entirely new level) was only OK as the villain, and Cameron Diaz was sort of a mere sidenote character. It's as if the writers (Rogen and friend Evan Goldberg) just said, ""Well, I guess we have to put an attractive love interest in here somewhere."" But her part -- which may seem integral -- could have been played by anyone and wasn't really all that important, as someone else in the cast could've easily brought to the table the knowledge that her character had.

1311759,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B002ZG99B8,Andrea Polk,"[3, 4]","I like the premise - bored rich kid starts dreaming of hero status cloaked in a super hero-like car and outfit with a side-kick who's really the only stud of the pair.  Rich kid does this following the death of his father, who owns a newspaper and never really had time for the kid.  Eventually what started as a night of defacing property turns into vigilantism and eventually ridding the city of criminals at the highest level.  That sounds good right?  The problem... way too little character development for me to be sympathetic to the cause, and way too many explosions and high speed chases to find much continuity in the story.Seeking to finish out the film I focused on what I liked.  I liked the car - very cool and I want one.  I liked most of the banter between The Green Hornet and Kato.  Actually, Kato was the best part of the movie; smart, handsome and the mastermind behind The Green Hornet and his gadgets.  The Green Hornet really comes off as an oaf who simply follows Kato around, pretending he's in charge of Kato.Overall this movie was a 'C' on an A to F scale.  It will appeal to boys and men more than it will to women, and much of it is so loud with car chases and explosions, that some will find it tough to hear the dialogue when it occurs. It's not offensive, but much of it was tedious and boring.  If it weren't for watching it with my family I would have turned it off and not finished it. The cool cars, fight scenes where Kato kicks a**, and the occasionally humorous exchanges, were the only good parts for me.

1311761,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG99B8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 4]","When the idea of `The Green Hornet' was born, I remember reading news on the production of the film and thinking that this was going to be amazing.  I kind of love Superhero films only because I grew up loving Superheroes and so to see my favorite characters on the big screen is a big deal for me.  Sadly, sometimes those films get weighed down by attempts to do too much or live up to such high expectations that they either shrivel up into wasted efforts or they are relegated to the closet as `satisfying fluff with no real memorable facet'.  There are some exceptions (`The Dark Knight', X2: United', `Spider-Man 2'; all of which set a bar VERY high) but they aren't the norm, especially when you consider the fact that Superhero movies are made by the handful every year.Anyways, back to my initial thought.  I remember thinking that the idea of Seth Rogan playing the lead was an inspired move because he is SO not your typical Superhero, and I was getting tired of seeing Ryan `twelve-pack' Reynolds getting every Superhero gig out there.  Then you factor in Michael Gondry, who is awesome, Christolph Waltz, James Franco, Cameron Diaz and Tom Wilkinson, who I practically worship, and you have my appetite whet for sure.Then the reviews poured in, the critics panned it and everyone I knew said it was awful.I just, finally, had a chance to see this the other night and I'm baffled that this was disregarded as Superhero trash.  In fact, outside of the poorly conceived Kung-Fu scenes (I think people get so carried away with the 3D idea that they forget it still has to play out on a 2D screen) and the somewhat cluttered ending, this film was GREAT.For me, this film soars because of two things.  First you have Seth Rogan.  I seriously think this guy is awesome.  Sure, he has his detractors, but I love his everyman humor and the way that he understands layering his `shmuck' characters with enough heart and warmth to make them truly likable (and in a believable way at that).  Here he plays a dejected son of an egomaniac who grows up without a mother and winds up squandering his potential by boozing it up with loose women in an attempt to get back at the father who never loved him.  Then his father dies and he has to take over the newspaper company he ran.  He is initially uninterested, but when he gets the chance to play `Superhero' (quite by accident) he sees that he can use his father's business to make his wildest dreams come true.  By becoming a Superhero (who poses as a villain to gain the upper hand on the real bad guys) he uncovers the truth behind his father's death and the truth behind the man he always regarded as a terrible human being.I didn't mean to say all that without getting to the second reason this works, but then again, I don't think I'm done talking about Seth Rogan.  Seriously, he makes this movie work.  His humor is laced on every scene (he co-wrote the script) and it becomes a part of the fabric of the film.  The dialog is beyond quotable and infectiously entertaining, and that really keeps us glued.  It reminded me of the dialog for `Super 8' in that it was so sharp and witty that it, at most times, overrode the films construction issues.The second reason this works is Michael Gondry.  His stylistic approach to filmmaking is used expertly here, but not in a way I initially expected.  Instead of fantasizing in a way that most would approach a Superhero film, Gondry scales back his visual inventiveness for a film that thrives on revisiting the nostalgic atmosphere of the pulp, crime noirs of yesteryear.  No, this is not a noir (by any means) but it has such visual presence and references that era nicely.  From the sets to the costumes to the score, this really embodied a strange sense of class that I wasn't expecting.  It was modern, sure, but it felt very old-fashioned and I think that was a good thing in an era so obsessed with outdoing the last `action film'.Yes, I hated the way those slow motion action scenes were shot.  The scene where Britt and Kato have a fight in the house is far more entertaining because it is stripped of that gawky slow motion idea.  The use of 3D is too obvious to the 2D viewer (the bottle cap moment was ridiculous) and so it takes away from the actual film to a degree.  And yes, the conclusion was a tad cluttered (so much at one time) but it worked out in the end.When all is said and done, I thoroughly enjoyed this.  For me, this was a nice diversion from the over-produced Superhero films clamoring for that `Special Effects' Oscar.",4,All haters are just green with envy!,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,4548,"['When', 'idea', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'was', 'born', 'remember', 'reading', 'news', 'production', 'film', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'amazing', 'kind', 'love', 'Superhero', 'only', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'Superheroes', 'so', 'see', 'favorite', 'characters', 'big', 'screen', 'big', 'deal', 'Sadly', 'sometimes', 'films', 'get', 'weighed', 'down', 'attempts', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'live', 'up', 'such', 'high', 'expectations', 'shrivel', 'up', 'wasted', 'efforts', 'are', 'relegated', 'closet', 'satisfying', 'fluff', 'real', 'memorable', 'facet', 'are', 'exceptions', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'X2', 'United', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'set', 'bar', 'VERY', 'high', 'are', ""n't"", 'norm', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'Superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'handful', 'year.Anyways', 'back', 'initial', 'thought', 'remember', 'thinking', 'idea', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'playing', 'lead', 'was', 'inspired', 'move', 'SO', 'not', 'typical', 'Superhero', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Ryan', 'twelve-pack', 'Reynolds', 'getting', 'Superhero', 'gig', 'there', 'Then', 'factor', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'who', 'awesome', 'Christolph', 'Waltz', 'James', 'Franco', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'practically', 'worship', 'have', 'appetite', 'whet', 'sure.Then', 'reviews', 'poured', 'critics', 'panned', 'everyone', 'knew', 'said', 'was', 'awful.I', 'just', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'other', 'night', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'was', 'disregarded', 'Superhero', 'trash', 'fact', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'Kung-Fu', 'scenes', 'think', 'people', 'get', 'so', 'carried', 'away', '3D', 'idea', 'forget', 'still', 'play', 'out', '2D', 'screen', 'somewhat', 'cluttered', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'GREAT.For', 'film', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'have', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'seriously', 'think', 'guy', 'awesome', 'Sure', 'detractors', 'love', 'everyman', 'humor', 'way', 'layering', 'shmuck', 'characters', 'enough', 'heart', 'warmth', 'make', 'truly', 'likable', 'believable', 'way', 'Here', 'dejected', 'son', 'egomaniac', 'who', 'up', 'mother', 'up', 'squandering', 'potential', 'boozing', 'up', 'loose', 'women', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'loved', 'Then', 'father', 'dies', 'take', 'over', 'newspaper', 'company', 'ran', 'initially', 'uninterested', 'when', 'chance', 'play', 'Superhero', 'quite', 'accident', 'can', 'use', 'father', 'business', 'make', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'becoming', 'Superhero', 'who', 'villain', 'gain', 'upper', 'hand', 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'truth', 'father', 'death', 'truth', 'man', 'always', 'regarded', 'terrible', 'human', 'being.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'getting', 'second', 'reason', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'done', 'talking', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Seriously', 'movie', 'work', 'humor', 'laced', 'scene', 'script', 'part', 'fabric', 'film', 'dialog', 'quotable', 'infectiously', 'entertaining', 'really', 'glued', 'reminded', 'dialog', 'Super', '8', 'was', 'so', 'sharp', 'most', 'times', 'overrode', 'films', 'construction', 'issues.The', 'second', 'reason', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'used', 'expertly', 'here', 'not', 'way', 'initially', 'expected', 'Instead', 'fantasizing', 'way', 'most', 'would', 'approach', 'Superhero', 'film', 'Gondry', 'back', 'visual', 'inventiveness', 'film', 'revisiting', 'nostalgic', 'atmosphere', 'pulp', 'crime', 'noirs', 'yesteryear', 'No', 'not', 'noir', 'means', 'such', 'visual', 'presence', 'references', 'era', 'nicely', 'sets', 'costumes', 'score', 'really', 'strange', 'sense', 'class', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'was', 'modern', 'sure', 'felt', 'very', 'old-fashioned', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'era', 'so', 'obsessed', 'outdoing', 'last', 'action', ""film'.Yes"", 'hated', 'way', 'slow', 'motion', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'scene', 'where', 'Britt', 'Kato', 'have', 'fight', 'house', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'stripped', 'gawky', 'slow', 'motion', 'idea', 'use', '3D', 'too', 'obvious', '2D', 'viewer', 'bottle', 'cap', 'moment', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'away', 'actual', 'film', 'degree', 'yes', 'conclusion', 'was', 'tad', 'cluttered', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'time', 'worked', 'out', 'end.When', 'said', 'done', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'nice', 'diversion', 'over-produced', 'Superhero', 'films', 'clamoring', 'Special', 'Effects', 'Oscar']",N/A

Obviously, if you loved the original ""Green Hornet"" TV series and took it seriously as an adventure story, this modern-day spoof, filled with broad comedy and crude language, is not going to please you. But underneath it all, this is clearly a labor of love for pop-culture geek Seth Rogen, who cowrote the film and stars as the Hornet himself, although he plays him as a clueless, ham-fisted would-be superhero instead of a sharp-voiced, action-ready mystery man. The most effective elements of humor in here are Rogen's frat-boy-goes-masked-man oafishness, and the contrast of his super-capable ""sidekick,"" the new, ultra-badass Kato, who is a martial arts tornado and builds super-weapons and crazy cars that would make James Bond's Q turn green with envy.  Also, the absurd collateral damage, with comicbook violence projected into the real world, is pretty funny (even if you do sort of numb out at the end of this film the same way you do in a lot of straight, non-comedy action flicks...)Folks who say that Rogen ""got it wrong"" with the Green Hornet are either being disingenuous or just plain not getting it: this wasn't intended as a remake, it's a satire.

1311769,A2PMQH87R1H3QU,B002ZG99B8,Benjamin Kidman,"[2, 3]",So my verdict is officially in on the Green Hornet. Im going to say that I didnt like it. I have a feeling that 2011 will go down as the year the funny man killed the super hero movie. Im not one to pigeon hole an actor and I think Seth Rogen should be given the chance to spread his acting wings. Sadly he didnt do that in the Green Hornet. The movie comes off as a bromance comedy with a Rush Hour feel. I like my super hero movie gritty with doses of one liners. The Green Hornet feels more like a running one liner with a super hero subplot. Kato (Jay Chou) is the only saving grace for the movie. Great slow-mo fighting style and all the gadgets that would make Bond blush. Christoph Waltzs acting ability is severely undercut by the horrible comedic lines hes supposed to deliver. And the less said about Cameron Diaz in this movie the better. Leave your Dark Knight expectations at the door and get ready for something in between a Schumacher meets Michael Bay type movie.

This leaves his playboy son Britt (Seth Rogen) to run the show.  Seth in turn is looking for a good cup of coffee which introduces him to an inventor and martial arts coffy maker Kato (Jay Chou). Out of boredom Britt and Kato come up with the Green Hornet thing. Lacking direction they pilfer ideas from criminology student Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz). Will their plans be foiled by a real criminal Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz)? Or will they be able to accomplish their goal? And does anyone get the girl?Great Green Hornet movie.

1311773,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B002ZG99B8,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[8, 18]","I have for long been a big fan of Rottentomatoes dot com, which, if you don't know, rates films based on positive and negative reviews they receive from professional critics; the term professional being a loose term , as often a bloke who has maintained a blog for more than two years can count as a critic. I usually agree with these critics, but often find that they are too soft on some films, and hard on others; The Green Hornet falls in the latter category.I have a very limited knowledge of comic books, so I came to the Green Hornet as a newcomer. For those who don't know, this is the tale of a ""hero"" who enjoys attacking gangs after he enjoys beating up some thugs at a cemetery. It really is a spoof on the common Superhero motif, and the idea that they are actually saving the world, while in fact they may be creating more mischief and disaster.The Green Hornet, played by Seth Rogen, is a lazy idiot who enjoys partying, sleeping with girls, and doing all those deeds rich sons of billionaires are known for. After his father's death, he, of all people, gains the reigns of the newspaper. He not only lacks leadership, but admits to having no interest or care for running the family business. Unfortunately, after his father's death, he needs his coffee, but he has fired the guy who made coffee every morning. He rehires him to find that this Chinese man's talents exceed this limited field. He is also a brilliant mechanic that can build cars that are tolerant to damage caused by a golf club, and even a bullet. He is the definition of expertise in developing these cars.Side Kick better than the super hero:One of the most interesting ideas about the Green Hornet is that the Superhero is simply the mastermind of the plans, which usually take a unfortunate turn. The actual hero is the sidekick, played by Jay Chou, who, reminiscent of Bruce Lee in the original TV series, beats up most of their targets by himself. The Green Hornet in this film is a fool, someone who came up with an idea, and arrogantly attempts to take on the most dangerous criminals and drug dealers. Some may claim that Seth Rogen was the wrong person for this role, but the awkward chemistry works great between Chou and Rogen. Rogen plays an absolute fool, while Chou's Kato sticks to the Hornet sometimes not understanding that he is the pivot of this partnership, and could perform equally well without the Hornet.One of the main issues people may bring up with this film is its strange, underdeveloped, and often juvenile dialogue. I noticed this quite often, considering that Britt Reid, AKA The Green Hornet, overdoses on ""awesome,"" ""badass,"" and any other words that excite him. Rogen's dialogue is composed of sound bites, like an excited fourteen year old high on hallucinogens. The dialogue works however, as this partnership between Britt and Kato is such an anomaly this awkward dialogue fits the tone of the work quite well.  Kato, on the other hand, is also the stereotypical Asian character using a very predictable English accent that screams FOREIGNER; his accent is most similar to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa in Family Guy. Though no one expects Chou to employ a perfect English accent, I believe that the director or Producers encouraged Chou to speak in such to make him at times the butt of jokes; this is especially clear when he uses words like ""p####"" that is not necessarily funny, but with broken English appears funnier than it should.This film is visual eye candy, with shamelessly excessive and loud explosions. The sheer wreckage caused is both astonishing and laughable with the main offices of a top newspaper basically demolished. Their vehicle, the Black Beauty, is behind the singular action sequences. Causing so much havoc, it holds unbearably well  against the attacks of Chudnofsky, the villain, and his henchman. The Black Beauty could also count as the main ingredient of The Green Hornet's appeal enhanced by missiles and countless weapons that deals with a large majority of the villains.As noted, this film has been criticized, by critics like Ebert, for lacking charm, for being just visually spectacular, and also lacking character development. Even though these charges, on a general level, are all valid, it is necessary to see how this film compares to similar visually spectacular phenomenons. A film like Transformers is just a visual experience with nothing to offer besides sound and explosion. This film is more than that, and though it does not achieve its full potential, it achieves the goal of being entertaining, even though it may leave many fans of the original series quite disappointed.Verdict:This film would be recommended to viewers who enjoy films like Superbad because Rogen and Goldberg, his comedy partner, are the writers of this screenplay. As such, this is no large social critique about Superheroes, but a film filled with juvenile humor that hits the mark. It may contain mundane and stale dialogue, but considering the awkward chemistry between Chou and Rogen, this is more welcome than poetic and biting dialogue offered in a film like True Grit.",5,"Great, Great, Fun",1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,5121,"['have', 'long', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Rottentomatoes', 'dot', 'com', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rates', 'films', 'based', 'positive',

THAT my friends, is what I think about this movie.There are other good actors in this movie who wasted their time and acting skills to produce this rubbish. Maybe they needed money but I am sure there were other movies they could have worked in. With all the trash and rubbish that currently comes out of "" Holly-Weird "" these days, there doesn't seem to be any shortages, especially since they like to make so many re-makes, of re-makes, of remakes.Seth Rogan should give up as an actor, he has NO CLASS or Acting Skill what so ever.

I particualrly liked the parody bad guy character who is the Green Hornet's nemesis.  This guy is an insecure crime boss who does not seem to terrrorize people enough, so he works on his image.  That is a funny sub-plot.  Kato, the Green Hornet's sidekick, is also excellent.  He is the one who makes the fight scenes memorable, with powerful martial arts moves.  The problem with the movie, and what made me not like it so much the second time around, was Seth Rogen's Green Lantern. The first time around his incongruent physique (for a super hero) was tolerable.  The second time it was annoying.  Also, I found a lot of the scenes where he and Kato need to get out of trouble difficult to believe.  I know this is part of this genre - the superhero escaping magically at the last moment - but in this case, it was too much.

I rented this movie and was very disappointed, by the ignorant buffoonery of unfunny Seth Rogen. Right away Seth lets everyone knows he's not a serious minded, crime fighting hero. Kato carried some of the fight sequences, but could not carry the whole movie, because he was only the sidekick, and the movie was titled after his outrageous leader. Intelligence was not portrayed by this hornet, so I stopped watching after 5 minutes. I felt my time was being wasted, while I watched this buffoonish minstrelsy.I found nothing from this Green Hornet, that was convincing, serious, or genuinely funny. At no time during this movie, will you imagine that this Green Hornet, reminds you of the original Green Hornet. This Green Hornet acts like a damn fool throughout this movie, and portrays an outdated minstrel show buffoon wearing black face. The new Kato at times mildly reminds you of Bruce Lee, and is just a tad more serious. I cannot give a detailed review about this movie, because I didn't spend much time with it.I continued to fast forward this movie, to see if Seth Rogen's stupid minstrelsy  would subside, but it only get's worse. This movie is an irritating disgrace, to the legacy of the real Bruce Lee's efforts. I will submit one star just to get this review posted, there's just no other way around it. I'm in total agreement with the majority of other reviewers. You will not find anything heroic, or remotely believable about these two action figure's.

The most extended fighting scene is between the leading characters Britt Reid aka the Green Hornet (Seth Rogan) and Kato (Jay Chou) as they butt heads over Katos rightful inventions and fighting additions to the duo. Seth Rogan makes stupid and constant quips throughout the complete film. Katos fight scenes hold no where the intensity or action packed attempts the trailers and previews might let on. There is more fighting and skills proven from the film ""Kick Ass's"" Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) or Iron Man II's Scarlett Johansson's fightn scenes. Hollywood has run out of original material, because they are prone to ignoring ethnic writers with new material and continue remakes of old films, ie., ""The Lone Ranger"" or ""Conan: The Barbarian"". Even musical scores are recylcled. I love AC/DC, but if I hear ""Highway to Hell"" in another film (Iron Man 2), I'm gonna burn my CDs.The Green Hornet is the weakest superhero and villain production that has its strongest element being the ""black beauty"" mobile Kato constructs and even then, the car is not that impressive either. Its storyline is too predictable and completely boring with the villian as uninteresting and unoriginal. The first fight was in the hood against some street corner thugs (yawn) and although Cameron Diaz is still hot, she showed no substance for character or major substance. The Green Hornets creation is not from some dramatic fate or act visited upon Mr. Reid, but is manufactured through his wealthy family's newspaper. How original, even ""Blankman"" uses that element with much more comic success, thanks to Damon Wayans!This DVD is for Seth Rogan fans only, but to me he is the same character he played in ""Knocked-Up"" combined with a deceitful attempt to lure in a karate film. What they should have done was made the film all about Kato instead because the Green Hornet is a boring and unfulfilled alpha male that humps air through the hole film.

It's just that she's never looked more haggard than she has in this film & her performance has never seemed more phoned in than it was here.I didn't really expect a whole lot from this movie. I mean come on- it's a SETH ROGEN flick. I don't think any of us went in expectingIron Manbut we were expecting something better thanBatman & Robin. Don't worry- it's better than B&R; for the most part. Since my dad is an IMAX & 3D fanboy, we shelled out the money for the souped up IMAX 3D tickets.Word to the wise: Do not pay to see this in IMAX or 3D, let alone together. The 3D in this film is practically non-existent, although the IMAX did make everything a little sharper. I know this won't be an issue for many people since this isn't typically a film you'd go see in 3D, but if you have someone like my father who tries to watch everything in IMAX 3D, you'll want to discourage them. This is not worth the price of admission.Anyway, the plot for this is pretty decent. It couldn't quite decide if it wanted to be a comedy or an action film, but that was fine for the most part. Rogen stumbles through his role with incredibly good cheer & despite him being a ne'er do well, you can't help but cheer him on. Chou is by far one of the best parts of the film, second to the character of Bloodnofsky. He's the one doing all the dirty work & I honestly found myself being more interested in what HE was doing than Rogen, but the two of them had an easy enough patter to where it worked out in the long run. And the bad guy? AWESOME. I really wish that he could've been in the film a little more- this guy was highly entertaining to watch, as were his bad guys.That brings us to the albatross around the movie's neck: Cameron Diaz. Now I love her movies & as far as girls in general go I do think she's attractive, but she looks incredibly haggard & old in this film. There's absolutely no chemistry between her & any of the other actors & to be honest... she sticks out like a sore thumb in this film. Her interactions feel like an afterthought, like someone wrote the script & said ""oh, we have this other character- we should put her in"". Diaz really phones it in for this film & that's a disappointment because I know she can do better. Like another reviewer put it, the role really should have gone to a different (younger) actress. They could've hired an unknown for a fraction of the cost of Diaz & it'd have been money well spent. It's the scenes with Diaz where you REALLY begin to feel how long the movie really is. Mercifully her scenes in the movie are relatively short, as if even the director began to realize how horribly miscast she'd been. She's not Tara Reid ""Alone in the Dark"" bad, but the fact that I was comparing the two of them during the film wasn't really a good thing. I know I'm probably being overkill at this point, but words can't explain how disappointed I was with Diaz's performance. You could have taken her out & put any other actress in the role- she brought nothing to the film & if not for her previous name value, you wouldn't have even known who she was. Diaz is bland & colorless in this film, which again is a shame. I know she can do better.Overall though this is a fun little flick & I'll admit that I'll probably watch it a few more times. I know it's not up to Iron Man standards, but it's just a fun & harmless movie. I initially hesitated at giving it 3 stars, but went ahead with it anyway. Minus Diaz, the film really is enjoyable. It's not something that you'd consider ""good"" like you'd consider Iron Man or Toy Story ""good"", but it's still fun to watch & will be one of those guilty pleasure watches. It'll probably be overlooked by many, but it's worth watching.",3,Diaz didn't belong in this film,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,3840,"['anyone', 'being', 'Diaz', 'hater', 'know', 'past', 'considered', 'fan', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'do', 'just', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'haggard', 'film', 'performance', 'never', 'seemed', 'more', 'phoned', 'was', 'here.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'movie', 'mean', 'come', 'on-', 'SETH', 'ROGEN', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'went', 'expectingIron', 'Manbut', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'better', 'thanBatman', 'Robin', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry-', 'better', 'B', 'R', 'most', 'part', 'dad', 'IMAX', '3D', 'fanboy', 'shelled', 'out', 'money', 'souped', 'IMAX', '3D', 'tickets.Word', 'wise', 'Do', 'not', 'pay', 'see', 'IMAX', '3D', 'let', 'alone', 'together', '3D', 'film', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'IMAX', 'did', 'make', 'everything', 'little', 'sharper', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'issue', 'many', 'people', ""n't"", 'typically', 'film', ""'d"", 'go', 'see', '3D', 'have', 'someone', 'father', 'who', 'watch', 'everything', 'IMAX', '3D', ""'ll"", 'want', 'discourage', 'not', 'worth', 'price', 'admission.Anyway', 'plot', 'pretty', 'decent', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'decide', 'wanted', 'be', 'comedy', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'fine', 'most', 'part', 'Rogen', 'stumbles', 'role', 'incredibly', 'good', 'cheer', 'being', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'Chou', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'second', 'character', 'Bloodnofsky', 'one', 'doing', 'dirty', 'work', 'honestly', 'found', 'being', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'HE', 'was', 'doing', 'Rogen', 'two', 'had', 'easy', 'enough', 'patter', 'where', 'worked', 'out', 'long', 'run', 'bad', 'guy', 'AWESOME', 'really', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'film', 'little', 'more-', 'guy', 'was', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'were', 'bad', 'guys.That', 'albatross', 'movie', 'neck', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Now', 'love', 'movies', 'as', 'far', 'girls', 'general', 'go', 'do', 'think', 'attractive', 'incredibly', 'haggard', 'old', 'film', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'other', 'actors', 'be', 'honest', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'film', 'interactions', 'feel', 'afterthought', 'someone', 'wrote', 'script', 'said', 'oh', 'have', 'other', 'character-', 'should', 'put', 'Diaz', 'really', 'film', 'disappointment', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'reviewer', 'put', 'role', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'different', 'younger', 'actress', 'could', ""'ve"", 'hired', 'unknown', 'fraction', 'cost', 'Diaz', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'scenes', 'Diaz', 'where', 'REALLY', 'begin', 'feel', 'how', 'long', 'movie', 'really', 'Mercifully', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'relatively', 'short', 'even', 'director', 'began', 'realize', 'how', 'horribly', 'miscast', ""'d"", 'been', 'not', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'bad', 'fact', 'was', 'comparing', 'two', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'overkill', 'point', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'Diaz', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'out', 'put', 'other', 'actress', 'role-', 'brought', 'nothing', 'film', 'not', 'previous', 'name', 'value', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'known', 'who', 'was', 'Diaz', 'bland', 'colorless', 'film', 'again', 'shame', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'fun', 'little', 'flick', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'know', 'not', 'up', 'Iron', 'Man', 'standards', 'just', 'fun', 'harmless', 'movie', 'initially', 'hesitated', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'went', 'ahead', 'anyway', 'Minus', 'Diaz', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'consider', 'good', ""'d"", 'consider', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Toy', 'Story', 'good', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'watches', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'overlooked', 'many', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1311794,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B002ZG99B8,Chris Kennison,"[0, 3]","Much has been the case with many action/superhero movies over the past few years. Are the creators of these movies not sure if they're gonna make any money with their project or have action scenes become that expensive? If their gonna skimp out on the action scenes, how about writing a really good script that compensates for it. Well, they didn't really do that either.Many of these movies are falling into the exact same cookie-cutter formula style movie making. Iron Man 2 must have had the exact same screenwriter. Introduce bad guy in the beginning, spend an hour or more delving into the personalities of the hero(s) and then pour everything you have into a slam-bam finale. Oh, and since there isn't a whole lot going on in the middle, have hero shoot fruit in a drunken stooper or have hero(s) fight each other for no good reason.I give credit to the filmmakers for stepping away from the special f/x riddled movies we see these days, and keeping many of the stunts completely real, but everytime Jay Chou/Kato does his thing, does it have to be in slow motion? As real as the car chases and car smashes were, the fighting scenes were Matrix/Resident Evilish.Green Hornet isn't a complete waste of time, but it was certainly disappointing in an ongoing calvade of movies being paraded out over the past few years that have no depth, creativity, no quality writing and seem to only have one goal in mind, to dazzle visually. GREEN HORNET doesn't even do that, and if it wasn't going to do that, then they should have written a script that grabbed us.On a final note, Oscar winner, Christop Waltz ""Bloodnofsky"" was completely wasted in what could have been a great and memorable bad guy.

1311795,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG99B8,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 8]","You know something is wrong when the worst character in ""The Green Hornet"" is The Green Hornet himself. As portrayed by Seth Rogen, we see a twelve-year-old trapped in a man's body, a bratty and talkative megalomaniac that does none of the dirty work and truly has no idea what he's doing. Rogen, who is also the co-writer and one of the executive producers, is not only tragically miscast but has also written his character badly; rather than a bold and debonair crime fighter, as he was in the original 1930s radio program, The Green Hornet is now a broadly defined goofball, a spoiled and whiny jerk who can do little more than say how cool something looks before getting his butt kicked. In the annals of pulp fiction, few characters have been this unlikeable, unimpressive, and cowardly.The unfortunate thing is that this ""new"" and ""improved"" Green Hornet sets off a chain reaction that brings down the rest of the film. This is bad because all the ingredients were there; Cameron Diaz was smart and sexy, Jay Chou was fast and fierce, the action was entertaining, the special effects were convincing, and for the first time in ages, the 3D process was full and immersive. For God's sake, they even got Christoph Waltz, who so effortlessly earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Inglourious Basterds."" But when the best you can do is have the title character run away from a crime scene shouting, ""Save me, Kato!"" when he's supposed to be a ruthless vigilante, then something has gone terribly wrong.In the film, Rogen plays Britt Reid, the son of James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), the editor in chief of a Los Angeles newspaper called ""The Daily Sentinel."" Still upset over the death of his mother, and bitter over his father's constant disapproval, Britt lives his life as an irresponsible slacker who likes to drink, party, and embarrass his father by ending up on the front page of the morning newspaper. James dies unexpectedly, apparently the result of a bee sting; Britt must now take over as editor in chief, a position he's neither qualified for nor motivated to take on, mostly because he didn't get along with his father and is disheartened by the public outcry over his death.Even though he fired all of his father's staff, he rehires Kato (Chou) simply because he makes a damn fine cup of coffee. But Kato has other talents - he's an inventor and a mechanic, and I'll bet one of his creations is a time machine because there's no way a person can single handedly assemble a car so quickly. He also likes classical music, is skilled in the ways of martial arts, and possesses an inhuman ability to scan thugs and pinpoint their weapons. I will now skip a number of inconsequential details and get to the part where the two decide to become crime fighters. Their angle: They will wear masks, pose as criminals, and infiltrate the lairs of real criminals. In no time, Kato has rigged up a muscle car dubbed the Black Beauty with bulletproof glass, virtually indestructible steel, missiles, machine guns, and other various overkills. Kato then supplies Britt's vigilante alter ego with a name: The Green Hornet.Britt secretly relies on his newly hired secretary, the beautiful Lenore Case (Diaz), for tips on behaving more like a criminal, since she's a serious journalist with a degree in criminology. He creates his own publicity by publishing stories about The Green Hornet in ""The Daily Sentinel,"" much to the chagrin of assistant editor in chief Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos). The articles catch the attention of Benjamin Chudnofsky (Waltz), a heartless Russian mobster who has control over all of the city's crime families. If you know what's good for you, you won't tell him he isn't scary, nor will you fumble pronouncing his name (an uncredited James Franco learns both lessons the hard way). Also alerted is Los Angeles District Attorney Frank Scalon (David Harbour), whose efforts to rid the city of crime have been undermined by The Green Hornet.I'm making this movie sound a lot better than it actually is. In the hands of Seth Rogen and director Michel Gondry, the fast-paced and entertaining plot is overshadowed by the jokey and immature antics of the main character, a man so thoroughly off putting that I found myself going against everything movies like this stand for and wishing his secret identity would be exposed. How often do we root for the sidekick instead of the hero? ""The Green Hornet"" makes it impossible to do otherwise; Kato is smarter, braver, more skilled, and way more charismatic than Britt ever was. What a mockery of character and tone. Rogen can be a good actor (see ""Funny People""), and he can also be a good writer (see ""The Simpsons"" episode ""Homer the Whopper""), but here, he errs, and he errs badly.",3,Who Was That Masked

We all had high hopes for a movie, at one point Jet Li was going to play Kato in a dead serious movie, but alas it never came to pass.  Then we get this comedy.  Ok some of the stunt work was superb, especially the car stuff at the end.  However the Green Hornet was never meant to be a joke, and thats what this movie is played as.  It certainly wasn't a box office smash and left many disappointed.  Perhaps the day will come when somebody does it right again, but after this, it seems doubtful.

LeBlanc ""I love music!""","[1, 3]","The only part of this TERRIBLE movie that was any joy to watch, was when Jay Chao (Kato) kicked Seth Rogen's butt. ___ Seth is decent in comedies... and COMEDIES ONLY.  He should NEVER have been cast as The Green Hornet... and he has absolutely no business EVER being cast in ANY role that contains complex (non-comedic) emotional arcs... let alone, a LEAD role in a Action Film!! __ I don't know what the hell the Director, Studio, or even his own Agent were thinking... HOPEFULLY, everyone has learned a good lesson from this... and we'll never have to endure this kind of a travesty, ever again..... because if a REAL ACTOR were cast as the Hornet... this movie COULD have been good, if not great.  Unfortunately, Seth did the only thing he knows how to do -- and turned it into a huge, (unfunny & painful) Joke. ___ I've liked some of his COMEDIC movies -- but guys like this, are only good for one thing... COMEDIES. ___I ""went in"" having Exceptionally LOW expectations... and knew most everyone, absolutely HATED this movie (thanks to him)... but still, I thought it could at least be worthy of 3 stars, or 2 at the worst... but this crap doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I know people say that often... but it couldn't be more true here. ___PS: While I'll give him props for losing weight for the role... that's the only thing it seems he actually did right... although, his ""fat-head"" is still as fat/chubby as ever... so the fact that his mid-section is slimmer, tends to escape your notice most of the time... as he appears to be the same chubby/fat ""comedian"" as seen in past movies.___________ What's next, Will Farrell as Wolverine?

1311805,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG99B8,C. Sawin,"[4, 9]","The Green Hornet seemed like it was fighting an uphill battle as soon as it went into development. Most projects that were either influenced by Bruce Lee or are trying to continue a story he started just turn out to have disappointing and unfortunate results. The Green Hornet lost Stephen Chow shortly after it was announced he would direct and star in the film while many didn't think Seth Rogen was the type of guy who could do an action film. The main villain role was originally intended for Nicolas Cage before he eventually dropped out. With its release continually being pushed back and critic and early screening reception being practically nonexistent many wondered if The Green Hornet could just pull off not being a total disaster. Despite all of its issues, The Green Hornet is actually an extremely humorous and entertaining thrill ride.Stephen Chow was replaced with Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunsine of the Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind) and his unusually artistic and spectacular visual style does get put on display on more than one occasion. Two of Kato's fight sequences, Britt's thought process in the Chinese restaurant, and the screen being split into multiple segments after a bounty is put on The Green Hornet's head are all great examples. Gondry usually manipulates scenes in extraordinary ways. In Kato's fight scenes, one car suddenly becomes a dozen while floating heads transition one scene to the next while Britt is in the restaurant. The great thing is his style works really well within the world of The Green Hornet.The cast is a serious plus, as well. Seth Rogen brings a lot of the comedy he's become associated with, but juggles the action aspect fairly well. Rogen isn't exactly a stranger to action as Pineapple Express had its fair share of it. I seriously loved Pineapple Express, so him being The Green Hornet wasn't as bothersome to me as it was to others. Jay Chou is no Bruce Lee, but he's an entertaining Kato nonetheless. There were a few smaller roles that are worth keeping an eye out for. Edward Furlong is around long enough for you to say to yourself, ""Wasn't that the kid from Terminator 2 and American History X?"" Indeed it was, sir or madam. Indeed it was. James Franco shows up and gives a hell of a speech, as well. After seeing him in something like 127 Hours, it's amazing seeing him not only jump back and forth between genres but give such exceptional performances in everything he's a part of. Then there's Christoph Waltz whose Chudnofsky character seems to be just as fun as Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. Chudnofsky is funny in a twisted kind of way, maniacal, and misunderstood by everyone around him while Waltz seems to slip into the character with ease.One of the more interesting and unexpected aspects of the film was the way certain things in the film were connected. Only the simpler things seem to come to mind now; Britt being interested in saving people at an early age, how The Green Hornet name comes to fruition, the one thing Kato can't do, and DA Scanlon's true motives. It all just comes together really nicely while little things are connected to the big picture and revealed later on. The Green Hornet isn't the best written piece of film, but everything flows really well and is put together in a way that'll surprise many who expect this to be nothing more than popcorn entertainment. There's even a brief nod to Bruce Lee in there.If you hadn't noticed, Cameron Diaz has yet to be mentioned in this review. While her character is important to the storyline, Diaz isn't. Anybody could have filled her shoes. When she first shows up on screen, the woman next to me said out loud, ""What's she doing here?"" It was pretty hilarious since I was pretty much thinking the same thing. She doesn't have much screen time either. Christoph Waltz was around more yet she received top billing after Rogen and Chou. It just seems kinda weak even if she is the bigger star.The film gets kind of rough towards the end though when it comes to special effects. While certain ridiculous things are shown in a light that almost make some of them seem feasible, the CG and green screen work is really noticeable during the conclusion of the story. It doesn't necessarily ruin the film, but it hurts it a little.The Green Hornet is really a hell of a way to kick off the new year as far as movies go. It's an amusing and exhilarating thrill ride from beginning to end while its solid and well-rounded cast in addition to the film having a surprisingly well-written storyline is just icing on the cake. The Green Hornet is just a fun film that can pretty much be recommended to anyone. So the next time someone asks if The Green Hornet is actually a good film, be sure you reply by saying, ""That's a bingo!""

Sure I may not like the Twilight films, but I don't outright hate them as they make me laugh on several occasions coupled with the fact that the third film was OK. But this? If I could rate it any lower, I would! I actually even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. The only thing I ever saw the Green Hornet was the two-part crossover featured in the original Batman series and since then have wanted to see the original series. Then I first heard about this garbage 2-3 years ago and found out Seth Rogen was writing and starring in it. At first I wondered who Seth Rogen is and then once I found out what kind of films he was in, I was like ""Well people were upset when Michael Keaton was cast as Batman and look how that turned out."" Boy was I wrong! He's an unfunny, talentless person (remember this is all opinion as I'm sure others have found him funny in other projects) but he should've stayed away from this! When I saw this in theatres, at first my dad and I were the only two in there but then at least five to ten more people showed up. Those other people found it hilarious. I sat there in silence, hoping it would get better. Rogen portrays the Hornet as a half-wit and screams with joy during one of their escapes as the police cars crash into obstacles. Britt Reid may want the Green Hornet to appear as a criminal but at no point, at least from the original series, does he get excited at the thought of mayhem and destruction. The guy who plays Kato, the name escapes me at the moment, was OK he didn't leave much of an impact on me (though that strange way he fights or gets pumped during a fight I thought was unnecessary and ""out there"") Cameron Diaz (another person I don't personally enjoy but she's OK) was wasted in this. The villain was bland, along with his recurring ""joke"" and the reveal of the DA being corrupt was expected. Black Beauty though was the highlight and I wish it was the Green Hornet who got totalled in the end and not the car. Believe me I wanted to like this but it was just stupid and I hope there is not a sequel. Another thing I noticed is a parallel with Batman; in the '60s, Batman was played as farce while the Green Hornet was played straight with Batman being far more successful. Nowadays, Batman is the serious one and Green Hornet played for laughs, again with the Caped Crusader far more successful. If you want to get into the Green Hornet my suggestion is to find the radio series or the much better Van Williams/Bruce Lee TV series (along with his crossover on Batman). And what really astounds me is that THIS has made more money than Green Lantern (just to clarify, Ryan Reynolds wasn't my first choice either and I actually thought they'd go with the John Stewart character for obvious reasons but he was good).",1,The Car Was The Best Actor.

1311810,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B002ZG99B8,David Baldwin,"[5, 9]","My only recollection of the TV version of ""The Green Hornet"" is when they did a guest appearance on ""Batman"".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's ""competition"".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.

1311812,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002ZG99B8,David J. Brown,"[2, 4]","Okay, okay, I was not alive or even young enough to know or remember the Green Hornet on the radio, in print, or eventually on the very good 60's tv series.  When I was a child I did get to see most of the 60's tv series on television and enjoyed it very much.  It didn't hurt that I was a virgining Bruce Lee mega-fan at the time either.  I would love to revisit that show now, especially after watching the film version of The Green Hornet got me all jonzed up for it.This film version is nowhere near as bad as many of the fanboys would have you believe.  I'm not sure what some non-Green Hornet initiated people were expecting, but I understand the Fanboy backlash.  I mean, even if it was more like the previous incarnations they would find something to complain about, I mean that's what they do.  They're fanboys.  They spend most of their time complaining about things they say they hate, but can't seem to stop talking about.  Weird.....Anyway, the film takes an anti-super hero movie approach.  In other words it does the opposite of what would normally happen in these types of films.  I'll try to elaborate with a list:Firstly, there's a love interest of sorts in the film.  Both Kato and the Hornet are after her, but she doesn't seem to like either.  There's no closure on the romance section. ""Whenever I watch one of these super hero type flicks the thing I care the least about is the romance"", is what Roegen said regarding his screenplay in one of the blu ray disc's special features.Secondly, said love interest, played spunkily by Cameron Diaz, is the brains behind the whole Green Hornet operation without knowing it.  Kato and Hornet are presented as slackers who have a dream of being heroes but really don't know what they're doing or how to go about it.  This is fun.  They are over their heads and know nothing about crime.  The Diaz character guides them unwittingly into their game plan.  Very neat.Thirdly, the villain is not a super villain.  The film makes it a point to show how mundane he is.  As the Hornet emerges he starts to think in terms of theatrics.  He wants to amp up his image and become a super villain because the emergance of two super heroes.  Christoph Waltz plays 'Bloodnosky' and has the funniest lines and delivery for my money. He's not played menacingly as he played the Nazi in Ingourious Basterds, but as impotent.  It's great.  Sure, he's a sociopath by his cold actions and random killings, but not by appearance and performance.  Very original and cool.Those are the three main twists here involving the super hero genre.  There's more but they're less important.  Obviously, this film is as much a comedy as an action film.  Basically Hornet and Kato are a virging 'bromance' and they play out their relationships similar to the way characters do in other Roegen penned scripts like Pineapple Express and Superbad.  Basically take that type of interaction and throw in a typical super hero plot and origin and you have the Green Hornet.Now why this film is only a three star affair for me comes down to how effective it is.  The action sequences are well handled and the whole concept of 'kato-vision' is ingenious and a fun way to portray karate fights, which are sooooo played out in cinema at this point.  The third act climax action is great and exciting, funny, and fun.  A great way to finish up the film.  Roegen and Chou's chemistry as budding buddies and crimefighters is very effective, sweet, and funny.  THe problem is that the whole plot and situations never feel like they're really happening or could really happen.  Everything is too lite and airy for their to be any real suspense or drama.  The tone of characterization should've shifted more by the end of hte second act.  Roegen doesn't seem to transition totally from frat boy to hero at the end.  Which would be fine with me if the film wasn't trying to convince of otherwise.This film reminded me of Big Trouble in Little China.  Basically in that film there was a white star and a Chinese sidekick.  The joke was that the white lead thought he was the hero and acted like it, despite the fact that he was  goofball and inept.  The Chinese sidekick was the real hero.  He did most of the fight and knew how to handle himself better.  It's a funny concept, but Big Trouble in Little China did it a lot better than the Green Hornet, thanks mostly to Kurt Russell's very funny lead performance.In conclusion, The Green Hornet is good enough.  It won't satisfy most old school Hornet fans.  Why should they fret, the comics and tv show still exist, so they will always have that going for them.  This film may lead to younger generations discovering the older incarnations of the Green Hornet and that's a great.  As a film on its own terms it's funny, but not hysterical.  There's not enough real meat to feel or invest in, but the action is exciting and our heroes have a great chemistry.  Worth a rent, but by no means a super hero classic.",3,Not even close to resembling the bad rap this film is getting.,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,4973,"['Okay', 'okay', 'was', 'not', 'alive', 'even',

When I ran out of everything else to watch, I finally watched this DVD.  It really is not as bad as everyone said or maybe I'm just not as smart as all the expert reviewers who seemed to universally pan it.  I think this film is OK for casual popcorn viewing.  If you can rent it for a buck somewhere it is worth that just to admire the various Black Beauty cars and then watch them get trashed.There is this one scene where Rogen actually looks like the Green Hornet for about 25 seconds, but for the rest of the film he looks more like Lumpy Rutherford trying to play Wally Cleaver.Sure, the film could have been much better, but that can be said for most films.  The fight scenes and chases are all well done and I'll watch it again for that.I think about everyone involved in this is tremendously talented.  Even Rogen can write very well and has awards to prove it, but as an actor he is a character actor, not leading man material.  I'm thinking Rogen just lacks something here.Then all of a sudden something hit me! Whatever it is Rogen lacked here, perhaps his character was actually supposed to lack it!  While I'm too young to remember the radio show, I was a huge fan of the old TV series in first run.

I won't reccomend it for a purchase but a rental on a dry weekend might work fine.Cast:Great cast that as others have said, and I agree, didn't seem to hit the mark that A-listers should be hitting. The chemistry between Seth Rogen and just about everyone was always tense to me. Like no one was comfortable in their scenes (most of the time).Cameron Diaz is, as always, quirky-cute and smart and she always pulls this off well. In regards to this movie, this is by far not her best work. It had to be said.Chudnoksky...Good actor (Christoph Waltz)...Baaad charater. He had to give bad lines that he just couldn't seem to make entertaining. Fine, I get that he is supposed to be that bad guy that blends in. That you won't see coming. He looks and dresses like an ordinary guy but he is still dangerous. We find he is a bit off his rocker later in the story and has some of the lamest dialogue. Some people defend it but it is in fact, so bad, they think it is funny. But this is not the actors fault. It is the film maker's. They are paid to be directors and writers for a reason. (I know, ""write your own movie screenplay"" and see how hard it can be.)Plot:I DID like their explaination in the behind the scenes that you wanted to feel like they are heroes that simply had a lot of money in order to do what they do. They aren't coming up with super gadgets that are impractical and over the top. The weapons on the car actually could be pulled off (minus the camouflage). He had ""back up"" cars ready to go when one was destroyed which seemed more realistic.Bad: Brit (Rogen) was firing people and re-hiring them out of sheer immaturity, fighting (fist fight) with his own partner, constantly insulting people, and we are to believe that ""all is well"" by the end? We are to like this hero? It's not the best written plot.Kato, although the coolest character, could have been better. It's not Jay Chou's fault. I guess they pulled his character back since he is a sidekick/partner but they could do a solo movie of him and I'd see it. The actor gets major + points from me and the writing of his character may have saved this movie from disaster. It just seemed like he was missing something. He DID get some of the better scenes.Violence:This a much more violent movie than I thought it would be. Even after seeing a trailer or two I was surprised. They destroy property, assault just about everyone (including each other) but there was surprisingly very little blood. Hmm. If I'm going to see people shot up and blown up, wood pieces going into eye sockets (it happens), I want to see it like it's real. If you are going to make a hero movie, you should either go kiddie style or all the way. Going half-way feels hollow. There is a difference between action movies and violent movies. Some people may prefer to see the violence without seeing the blood and guts that accompanies it so this review may be what you needed to see. Now an action movie, would have explosions, fights etc, but far less blood but this had people cut in half, impaled etc but so little blood it was lacking reality.

The reason for that is mainly because the main character, the spoiled rich guy played by Seth Rogan has such a blatant disrespect for Kato. That's it in a nutshell. Throughout the entire movie, Kato is the real driving force behind everything while Green Hornet takes all the credit and basically fails to recognize Katos abilities or appreciate him, even in the end (I didn't believe his trite contrition at the end).A lot happens throughout the movie, yet none of it really matters much because it all boils down to such a total disrespect for Kato. Green Hornet reminds me of a corporation's attitude toward its employees. Maybe that's the real theme here. Maybe that is why this movie has really turned off so many people. Green Hornet is the figurehead while Kato does all the real thinking and all the grunt work. Who gets all the credit? Green Hornet, of course. Who is Kato? Nuff said.The movie could have really sparkled if Green Hornet had of come off with a different attitude, a bit if humility, instead of the selfish lout Rogan played. I don't fault Rogan as much as the script or the director for that, unless Rogan had a hand in that in the first place!I only give it three stars for all the special effects and for the effort Kato put into this and...

When I heard that Seth Rogen would be playing the Hornet in the movie version, I expected the worst. (Sort of like Will Smith in ""The Wild Wild West,"" a horrendous fiasco that should have never been made.)  I went to see this film in the movies and was pleasantly surprised: despite being silly at times, it turned out to be an entertaining film.First of all, a little of Seth Rogen goes a long way and he can be quite annoying at times. (Hes much more down-to-earth in the special features.)  Jay Choi is good as Kato, the man who seemingly can do everything, Christolph Waltz is a riot as the villain of the piece and Cameron Diaz contributes nothing but having Rogen and Choi fight over her.  (Theres along and ridiculous fight scene between the Reid and Kato over Diaz that should have wound up on the cutting room floor.)Whats great about this film are the action scenes and stunts which are terrific.  Theres an incredibly long chase and action scene between the Hornet's car, the ""Black Beauty,"" and many heavily armed vehicles of the bad guys that goes on forever.  (This scene is even longer in the deleted scene segment of the special features.)  The car scene ends and another explosive fight scene continues in the offices of the Daily Sentinel, the newspaper owned by Brit Reid, the secret identity of The Green Hornet.  The stunts and action scenes were performed by legendary stuntman, Vic Armstrong and many members of his family.Look, as stated, this film can be very silly at times and Rogen can be hard to take, but, for the most part, this is an exciting and enjoyable film.  The special features on the blu-ray are very good: deleted scenes, gagreel, features on the writing of the film, the creation of the ""Black Beauty,"" the stunts, the special effect, etc. etc.  The picture and sound quality are terrific.",4,Way Better Than It Had Any Right To Be,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,1957,"['watched', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'tv', 'series', 'Van', 'Williams', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'when', 'originally', 'played', 'ABC', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'When', 'heard', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'Hornet', 'movie', 'version', 'expected', 'worst', 'Sort', 'like', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'horrendous', 'fiasco', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'movies', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'being', 'silly', 'times', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'entertaining', 'film.First', 'little', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'long', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'times', 'Hes', 'much', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'special', 'features', 'Jay', 'Choi', 'good', 'Kato', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'can', 'do', 'everything', 'Christolph', 'Waltz', 'riot', 'villain', 'piece', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'nothing', 'having', 'Rogen', 'Choi', 'fight', 'Theres', 'along', 'ridiculous', 'fight', 'scene', 'Reid', 'Kato', 'Diaz', 'should', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'action', 'scenes', 'stunts', 'are', 'terrific', 'incredibly', 'long', 'chase', 'action', 'scene', 'Hornet', 'car', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'many', 'heavily', 'armed', 'vehicles', 'bad', 'guys', 'forever', 'scene', 'even', 'longer', 'deleted', 'scene', 'segment', 'special', 'features', 'car', 'scene', 'explosive', 'fight', 'scene', 'offices', 'Daily', 'Sentinel', 'newspaper', 'owned', 'Brit', 'Reid', 'secret', 'identity', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'stunts', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'performed', 'legendary', 'stuntman', 'Vic', 'Armstrong', 'many', 'members', 'family.Look', 'stated', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'silly', 'times', 'Rogen', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'take', 'most', 'part', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gagreel', 'features', 'writing', 'film', 'creation', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'stunts', 'special', 'effect', 'etc', 'etc', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'terrific']",N/A

If they're not, right about now, there's a chance that they're spinning around in their caskets. But if they're still with us, they're probably furiously digging a grave for Seth Rogen, a disrespectful gent what just torpedoed the Green Hornet franchise. If you're a fan of the 1960s television series with Van Williams and Bruce Lee - or even if you're a fan of the 1940 serial with Gordon Jones - this new adaptation may find you grinding your teeth. Of course, you may have the same reaction even if you're not familiar with the Green Hornet.Some things change for the better, but this adaptation makes a case for entropy. Feckless playboy Britt Reid has just inherited his murdered father's crusading newspaper, the Daily Sentinel. Reid's alter ego, the Green Hornet, updated to these contemporary times, is still the scourge of the criminal underworld. He's still viewed as a villain by the police and the general public, which is all part of the plan as the Hornet had, from jump, meant to pose as a lawbreaker (and I actually find his reasoning for this logical as hell). This time, his purview is Los Angeles and his main villain an underworld crime boss who touts the hard-to-pronounce name of Chudnofsky. Chudnofsky, by the way, agonizes over his image, which he worries may not be intimidating enough. This becomes a running gag throughout the film and eventually results in Chudnofsky's assuming his own costumed persona, but a lame one. Behold Chudnofsky as he becomes... Bloodnofsky. Everyone must now cower.What were they thinking, the powers that be? That to properly revive a once popular pulp hero, it required a comedic swerve? Seth Rogen is absolutely wrong for the Green Hornet role. And since Rogen gets co-writing and co-producing creds here, much of what happens onscreen has to be laid at his feet. A touch of humor is always welcome and appreciated, but only so far as it services story and plot and even characterization. The Green Hornet ain't supposed to be frivolous and silly like the Mask. You couldn't tell that in this movie.Even more egregious than the off-putting comedic tone is Rogen's choice of how Britt Reid is portrayed. His Britt is abrasive and buffoonish, which I guess is okay to start with. But as the movie went on, Rogen doesn't do or say anything to redeem his character or make him more appealing. He starts out obnoxious and then treads water. And this Britt Reid, he's not even clever. No wonder he becomes envious of Kato.Speaking of, one of the film's few saving graces is Jay Chou as Kato, inventor extraordinaire, expert kung fu master, and Britt Reid's right hand man. Kato is clearly the brains in this operation, and this eventually becomes a source of tension between the two. There are some rough patches in which you can't make out what he's saying because of his thick accent, but Chou carries himself well. Kato's resourcefulness and his fight scenes are the film's highlights, although the one knock against his fight scenes is that there was this clear catering to 3D, and so we get those extraneous special effects.Some other saving graces? I thought the Hornet's Black Beauty - a sleek 1965 Chrysler Imperial - was awesome. And the gas gun. And, okay, I did appreciate the exploration into the hero-sidekick relationship, and the neat swerve of the sidekick being ridiculously more capable than the lead hero.Cameron Diaz comes in as the eye candy that drives a wedge between the Hornet and Kato. Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos spend their time onscreen avoiding eye contact with their self-esteem. What does it say about the film when the best moment it offers may be when the Hornet and Kato are in their tricked-out ride singing along to 2Pac's ""Gangsta's Paradise""? Or, wait, maybe the best scene is the one in which Britt Reid tries to come up with a code name for his new alter ego, and he arrives at ""the Green Bee."" Or maybe that's just wishful thinking.

I saw it the first time a couple years ago, I was entertained, i watched it tonight and I thought it was bad ass. For example, after Hornet' and Kato take down their first group of badies, Hornet' makes a comment about how they should be superheroes; In Kick Ass, Dave asks why no one has ever considered being a superhero, and you know what, movies with these types of approaches just seem to work. And I like that.Now this movie is in no way as good or even close to being as good as Kick Ass, but it is still a great Classic Adaption in it's own right, besides, you'd have thought this movie would suck after all this time, but no, it doesn't.Oh and majorly important thing here; Christoph Waltz is in this movie, and he was awesome!I usually always say that about all his performances, but hey, I can't tell a lie, so there that is.And The Bottom Line is holding steady at a75%- Stylish, Unique and Fun, The Green Hornet manages to be creativeand in doing so kicks a lot of ass and shows the merits of it's 60's counterpart.",4,Fun Fact: The Green Hornet is related to The Lone Ranger,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1786,"['Okay', 'gem', '1960', 'was', 'adapted', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'usually', 'when', 'something', 'done', 'hyped', 'up', 'surprise', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'hyped', 'up', 'all.This', 'film', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'pretty', 'everyone', 'love', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.But', 'thought', 'was', 'awesome', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'rich', 'guy', 'intelligent', 'assistant', 'No', 'Kato', 'not', 'sidekick', '.These', 'two', 'go', 'out', 'fight', 'crime', ""'re"", 'blowing', 'things', 'kingdom', 'come', ""'re"", 'acting', 'bad', 'guys', 'paper', 'sounds', 'stupid', 'way', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'down', 'movie', 'was', 'great.After', 'seeing', 'films', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'really', 'look', 'movie', 'new', 'eyes', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'entertained', 'i', 'watched', 'tonight', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'ass', 'example', 'Hornet', 'Kato', 'take', 'down', 'first', 'group', 'badies', 'Hornet', 'comment', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'superheroes', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'Dave', 'why', 'one', 'ever', 'considered', 'being', 'superhero', 'know', 'what', 'movies', 'types', 'approaches', 'just', 'seem', 'work', 'like', 'that.Now', 'movie', 'way', 'good', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'still', 'great', 'Classic', 'Adaption', 'own', 'right', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'suck', 'time', 'majorly', 'important', 'thing', 'here', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'usually', 'always', 'say', 'performances', 'hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'lie', 'so', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'holding', 'steady', 'a75', '%', 'Stylish', 'Unique', 'Fun', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'manages', 'be', 'creativeand', 'doing', 'so', 'kicks', 'lot', 'ass', 'merits', '60', 'counterpart']",N/A

Followed by two serials and a series of comic books. If any of these incarnations of the Green Hornet are what you feel are true to his folklore then you might be disappointed or even angry with how this movie is presented. Knowing this before I went in was extremely helpful for enjoying what the movie had to offer (a fun action packed, somtimes silly adventure) instead of hating it for what it lacked. For how this movie was written, Seth Rogen was perfect to play the main characters. The only thing I had a hard time shaking was it seemed Rogen's character Brit Reid was trying to be more of a Green Hornet wannabe than the actual Green Hornet. So don't expect the suspenseful night time patrols in the Black Beauty as the Green Hornet and Kato pretend to be criminals to infiltrate real crime bosses.

It has decent production values, great action sequences, a serviceable plot, and creditable performances.However, there are two things which put me off.First, Seth Rogen's Green Hornet is just not very likeable. He is not heroic. He doesn't elicit even a little sympathy. He's an antihero, not a hero. Don't get me wrong; I don't mind heroes with flaws. But I want heroes I can root for and care about, not feel contempt for. The character does show some growth at the very end of the film but by then it is too late; the damage is done.Second, the movie falls into the trap which many action comedies step into, it descends into self parody. Superhero films have to be played more or less straight.

Story is based upon a party animal playboy who inherits his father's multi-million dollar newspaper company, and then teams up with a martial arts trained engineer genius who together fight crime and corruption.  ""The Green Hornet"" originates in 1936 as a masked vigilante comic book hero that was popularized by a radio series.  Since then there have been many, many remakes of the classic story.  This 2011 release with Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Cameron Diaz has all the necessary gadgets and action, as well as several well-known actors who are actually fairly convincing in their roles during the film.  Best part of the movie of course is the climax of battles that takes place inside the newspaper company building where the bad guys wage an all out war on the Green Hornet and Kato.  The movie has star power, but actually is fairly well done (instead of the typical famous cast of has-beens who think their name and a few lucky roles make up for a crappy performance), this time everybody in the film pulled their weight.

In fact, it does not just want to say that, it wants to shout it from the rooftops throughout the film. As a result, we have a Kato that does it all, and a Green Hornet that remains an inept, self centered loser the entire movie. And just in case you didn't get the hint that it's all about the sidekick, an arguement between the two ""heroes"" results in Kato kicking the Green Hornet's posterior all over the screen. Now, as silly as it seems that Bruce Lee was just a sidekick in the original show, I don't think there were that many fans that wanted him to kick Van William's (TV GH) a$$.

1311871,A9TG2NFA614S9,B002ZG99B8,John F. Rooney,"[8, 11]","""The Green Hornet"" (2011) shown in 3D features Seth Rogen as Britt Reid who becomes The Green Hornet. He's the kind of over-the-top comic who can become very annoying and exasperating if you're not on his wave length. It helps if you have an adolescent fondness for zany and oafish playground humor. The real star of the movie is Jay Chou as Kato.Britt is a party animal who who lives a wasted existence until his tyrannical father, James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), mysteriously kicks the bucket via a bee sting. Britt inherits the family newspaper. When he meets his father's chauffeur, the brainy Kato who has designed fantastic cars, Britt decides to be a crime fighter, but to be different, he chooses to be a vigilante. With his inherited newspaper he can build up the Green Hornet as a bad guy. Kato builds a car, the Black Beauty, which has more gizmos, gadgets, and armament than any James Bond vehicle.Britt is a klutz, a know-it-all who knows nothing. He can't fight. He thinks he's great, is an egomaniac who after Kato beats up a gang of toughs tries to take the credit and denigrate his sidekick, but Kato has spunk and won't sit back and be a flunky. Kato is a terrific martial arts fighter and seems to have super powers. He can whip up elaborate inventions in a few days. He's the muscle and brains of that outfit.Britt thinks he can get any woman he wants, but he better look out for Kato. The movie has a love interest, but you'll be surprised at who ends up with the girl.There's way too much mayhem in this, and the car violence gets tiresome. The Green Hornet seems to wipe out as many cops as bad guys.If this movie succeeds, I can see sequels lying in wait, but they could very quickly become tiresome just as this film does. Parts are boring and Rogen can wear down the moviegoer who's not on his whiny track. He's a comic playing a comic book hero, but playing the character for laughs can be dangerous. It's part of the crime-fighter and sidekick genre played for yacks more than kicks. There's some crude stuff not for kids.Britt as a youngster was humiliated when his father took his toy caped superhero doll and tore the head off it. So what does the boy-man do as his first super-hero stunt? He cuts the head off a statue placed in his father's honor at the gravesite.It's a goofy movie so be prepared. Get ready for lots of mad-cap action, wild car chases, explosions, yucks and jokes. There's a monumental fight between Kato and Britt.

1311872,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B002ZG99B8,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[4, 10]","Green Hornet, the newest DC franchise to appear on the big screen, is some seriously lowbrow fare.  Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, this plays more like The Three (ok, Two) Stooges than anything.Britt Reid (Rogen) is heir to his father's newspaper/media empire.  Growing up estranged from his father Britt becomes a total party-animal, living completely in the moment.  The sudden death of his father leaves him questioning the direction of his life.  A meeting with Kato (Chou)- his father's personal mechanic who is much more than he seems- cements his new outlook and the two form a partnership to give meaning to their lives and help the citizens of L.A.  By posing as villains they'll be able to confront criminals on their own terms.  Initially successful, their scheme runs into serious trouble when they go up against aging Russian gangster Chudnofsky (Waltz), who's having his own identity crisis and is trying to reinvent himself while consolidating the underworld under his authority.This movie is lots of noise, explosions and foolishness.  You understand why it was plagued with so many problems since it never really seems to know what it's doing.  I'm not saying that Green Hornet has to be like Batman Begins or anything, but this is just plain dumb.  Rogen's Britt Reid character is completely expendable; other than being the rich guy who can pay for everything he's useless, only good for one-liners and general goofiness.  Whereas much like the tv show Kato literally does everything- he creates the weapons, kicks everyone's behind and tricks out the car.  Heck, by the end of the movie he even installed nano-technology into the damn thing!  During all this Reid repeatedly gets his butt kicked and talks smack.  Seth Rogen wrote a movie where there's no reason for his own character. That should tell you something right there.Christoph Waltz as Chudnofsky is the best thing in the movie.  From the outset you can almost see him trying not to smile while delivering his lines- his character is funny and actually pretty sympathetic for a while.  Jay Chou's Kato is ok, but there's no explanation for his skills; as an orphan from the streets of Shanghai he's practically Batman without the cape.  Cameron Diaz is here in name only; though her character plays a role in unfolding the plot Diaz herself doesn't add anything to the proceedings. Since she's there just for box office her part could've been played by Kim Kardashian for what it's worth.  Yeah, I said it!Green Hornet is a stupid mess of a movie.  There's really not a lot to add other than two hours of this crud is way too long.  A typical 90-minute action-comedy with b.s., bullets and explosions would've been much better.

Basically he takes the plot of the television series where a rich playboy, after finding out his father was killed by a hornet sting. We then find out that he is made the owner of the paper his father ran. He then turns to a crime because of his torrid relationship with his father so that he can use the newspaper to report on it. . He then sees some people in need of help, then turns on the other criminals. Basically he does bad stuff and then blames it on other criminals. I felt that aspect of it was really strange because he is basically committing crimes but getting away with it.I mean this series isn't nessacry Batman, Superman, or even Spider Man. It's one of those cult figures that goes under the radar and becomes something new for a audience. The show really lasted a short time, but it did bring Bruce Lee to us, but since Lee is gone, Chou took the reins and really shined as Kato. He showed off his talents by making us look at him in Awe as he did most of the stunts of the movie as they were nothing. He has a remarkable talent and I hope he is in future films that can also show what he is all about. The writing was all over the place in the movie, it felt like it had no direction and the dialogue was just plain ok.  Also, the direction by Gondry was some of his best, showcasing his music video skills, and implementing them into the film. It was a fun to watch movie mainly because of the stylistic direction. But the one big problem I had with the film was based on two actors. One underused, and one that was useless. Cameron Diaz, who I dislike, was in this film but yet she had no place, no big moments, and not anything else. I feel she was just here for us to look at her sagging face while Rogen cracked a joke. SHe was just a waste of space.The villain, Waltz, was not a villan at all. I mean what is it with writers and underwhelming villans? I mean there was one in Knight and Day, Mission Impossible 3, and numerous other movies that have been released in the past 5 years. Waltz is better than this movie, the man has a Oscar to his name yet he is doing movies like this that made me shake my head at the absurdity of it. He's a good actor, but he needs to pick better roles, and quit phoning it in.Overall, I thought this film was a mess, but it was watchable in some parts enough. I get the feeling people were just seeing it because they got sick of seeing True Grit or numerous other movies that have been out for almost a month.

1311879,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B002ZG99B8,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[3, 6]","Myself, if I was the producer of a Green Hornet movie, I probably would have gone for a different flavor than the current Seth Rogan vehicle.  Likely, I would have aimed for an understated, cool 60's vibe (maybe even setting the movie in the 60's), with a cool jazzy score (lots of deep bass notes), snappy dialogue, and spare action (so it would really stand out when it eventually showed up).  But that's me.I do admit that the flavor/theme that the producers DID go for in the current film- namely, what if an irresponsible, immature buffoon and his only slightly more mature friend are suddenly driven to become superheroes- is also sort of interesting, and that the movie explores that angle entertainingly enough.  But for me, the incessant goofiness got a little old.On top of that, when the Green Hornet and Kato finally grow up a little and show some adult smarts and maturity, we're suddenly shunted into a huge, overwrought action sequence that takes up the whole last part of the film, preventing the movie from focusing on their new, less grating personas.  Regarding that last action sequence, again, I would have preferred spare, clever action (this isn't the Justice League, after all) rather than seeing the Hornet-mobile riding a service elevator up to the 40th floor of an office building and then tooling around a newspaper's editorial office amid automatic weapons fire from an army of goons.But again, that's just me, and I'm definitely not saying that the movie is shoddy or dull or poorly crafted.  It just chose an approach- broad humor, broad action- that some people will like more than others.  My wife, in fact, thought it was a refreshing change from the usual melodrama of other superhero movies.  Maybe you will, too.And, you know what?  Seeing that there are plenty of superhero movies that ARE done as straight-up (or mostly straight-up) dramas, like the current X-Men and Batman movies, I don't mind ALL that much that an occasional light, funny riff on this type of material, as seen in ""The Green Hornet"", comes down the pike now and again.  But let's keep it the exception to the rule, okay?

I thrilled to the then inexplicable to me fighting of Bruce Lee, and there were a lot of explosions and fights. So, I wanted to like this movie and went to see it despite Roger Eberts' printed warning.""The Green Hornet"" is the story of pampered party boy Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) who has an over-achieving father, James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), who is the owner of The Daily Sentinel, a newspaper that crusades against crime in Los Angeles. After the death of his father, Reid meets his father's mechanic and cappuccino maker Kato (Jay Chou). After getting drunk, Reid and Kato decide to vandalize the grave of Reid's father and in doing so inadvertently create The Green Hornet, and from there Reid decides to follow through and become the hero he feels resides within him.Seth Rogen has to take a lot of the wrap for ""The Green Hornet"" as he produced and wrote the movie. Rogen makes the same mistake other movies have in bringing other 60's-70's TV shows to the big screen, they play up the camp in the shows instead of playing it straight with concept. Yes, ""The Green Hornet"" TV show was a bit campy in its day, it was produced by the same people who produced the ""Batman"" TV show. Rogen plays Britt Reid/The Green Hornet as a petty, jealous, vindictive adolescent, no, more like juvenile, and has him scurrying back and forth over the front seat of the black beauty more like Bluto from ""Animal House"" than a hero. Rogen should have watched ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" while writing this movie, and he would have been a lot closer to the tone of the movie he should have been looking for.As a writer, Rogen's dialog is stilted and flat, and in places he has to throw in a chunk of exposition to explain who a character is to the audience, as when Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos) has to explain to Reid ""I was your father's trusted advisor for 45 years."" Reid doesn't know this?Jay Chou's Kato truly doesn't need this Britt Reid and is the more interesting, and strangely enough the more fleshed out character. Kato is a mechanical genius building the fortified car ""The Black Beauty"" for Reid. And Kato has to keep rescuing Reid from the gangsters he's trying to foil. The Kato Show would have made a better movie. Cameron Diaz plays Lenore Case, Britt Reid's trusted assistant at The Daily Sentinel. While the script hints that Diaz' character could be more integral to ""The Green Hornet's"" crime fighting abilities than other female foils to superheroes she really is only given a few scenes to work with and those are mostly used to fight off the lecherous advances of Rogen's Britt Reid.The lack of story doesn't allow for any emotional investment in either the characters or the plot so when the action scenes come along they're fairly routine and seem to string along the movie until the next plot point needs to be brought up. Lest anyone thinks I'm expecting too much from a movie with action. I noticed that some kids about 12 years old who were sitting near me were texting during the climatic chase scene.If you want to see ""The Green Hornet"" you will do better if you watch one of the marathon's airing the 60's ""Green Hornet"" TV show in conjunction with the release of this movie.",2,Superbad Meets Superhero,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,3292,"['Roger', 'Ebert', 'warned', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'used', 'love', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'TV', 'show', 'thrilled', 'then', 'inexplicable', 'fighting', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'were', 'lot', 'explosions', 'fights', 'So', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'went', 'see', 'Roger', 'Eberts', 'printed', 'warning', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'story', 'pampered', 'party', 'boy', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'who', 'over-achieving', 'father', 'James', 'Reid', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'owner', 'Daily', 'Sentinel', 'newspaper', 'crime', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'death', 'father', 'Reid', 'father', 'mechanic', 'cappuccino', 'maker', 'Kato', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'getting', 'drunk', 'Reid', 'Kato', 'decide', 'vandalize', 'grave', 'Reid', 'father', 'doing', 'so', 'inadvertently', 'create', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'Reid', 'follow', 'become', 'hero', 'resides', 'him.Seth', 'Rogen', 'take', 'lot', 'wrap', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'produced', 'wrote', 'movie', 'Rogen', 'same', 'mistake', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'bringing', 'other', ""60's-70"", 'TV', 'shows', 'big', 'screen', 'play', 'up', 'camp', 'shows', 'instead', 'playing', 'straight', 'concept', 'Yes', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'bit', 'campy', 'day', 'was', 'produced', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'produced', 'Batman', 'TV', 'show', 'Rogen', 'Britt', 'Reid/The', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'petty', 'jealous', 'vindictive', 'adolescent', 'more', 'juvenile', 'scurrying', 'back', 'forth', 'front', 'seat', 'black', 'beauty', 'more', 'like', 'Bluto', 'Animal', 'House', 'hero', 'Rogen', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'writing', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'closer', 'tone', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'for.As', 'writer', 'Rogen', 'dialog', 'stilted', 'flat', 'places', 'throw', 'chunk', 'exposition', 'explain', 'who', 'character', 'audience', 'when', 'Mike', 'Axford', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'explain', 'Reid', 'was', 'father', 'trusted', 'advisor', '45', 'years', 'Reid', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'Kato', 'truly', ""n't"", 'need', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'more', 'interesting', 'strangely', 'more', 'fleshed', 'character', 'Kato', 'mechanical', 'genius', 'building', 'fortified', 'car', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'Reid', 'Kato', 'keep', 'rescuing', 'Reid', 'gangsters', 'trying', 'foil', 'Kato', 'Show', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Lenore', 'Case', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'trusted', 'assistant', 'Daily', 'Sentinel', 'script', 'hints', 'Diaz', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'integral', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'crime', 'fighting', 'abilities', 'other', 'female', 'foils', 'superheroes', 'really', 'only', 'given', 'few', 'scenes', 'work', 'are', 'mostly', 'used', 'fight', 'off', 'lecherous', 'advances', 'Rogen', 'Britt', 'Reid.The', 'lack', 'story', ""n't"", 'allow', 'emotional', 'investment', 'characters', 'plot', 'so', 'when', 'action', 'come', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'routine', 'seem', 'string', 'along', 'movie', 'next', 'plot', 'point', 'needs', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'Lest', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'action', 'noticed', 'kids', '12', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'were', 'sitting', 'were', 'texting', 'climatic', 'chase', 'scene.If', 'want', 'see', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'will', 'do', 'better', 'watch', 'one', 'marathon', 'airing', '60', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'TV', 'show', 'conjunction', 'release', 'movie']",N/A

I saw it in 3D, which was nice but not necessary. (3D is older than dirt, but it didn't seem to go over well in the old days.) You may remember Seth Rogen from ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".The movie begins at The Daily Sentinel (Daddy's newspaper business).  Young Britt Reid is sent home for fighting in school, but was really trying to defend someone.  Daddy James Reid gets so mad, he rips the head off the boy's favorite toy, a super hero doll.  Britt grows up hating his father, believing that Daddy is way too hard on him.Fast forward probably something like 20 years or so.  Mr Chudnofsky is the head crime boss in Los Angeles.  He controls all the drug stuff and dares anybody to try to do their own thing.  When something happens to Daddy, the family business is dumped into Britt's hands.  Britt/Seth Rogen is not a go-getter.  As a matter of fact, it's about all he can do to find his coffee in the morning and boink the ladies while living off Daddy's money.  As you might have guessed, Chudnfsky and the Hornet's parallel activities collide.Britt meets Kato while searching for his coffee and they bond.  Kato was Daddy's mechanic, but also so much more.  Kato can design and build some super neat stuff--like he is an electronic genius!This flick is extremely entertaining.  It has lots of action, lots of stunts, martial arts, and is pretty darned funny.  There are gunfights, car chases, and lots of really cool gadgets.  Seth Rogen is wonderful as Britt/Hornet, and so is Kato.  Cameron Diaz also plays a newspaper employee.

What is lacking is the lead performance of Rogen and even more, his written script.The main problem is that Rogen's interpretation of the Britt Reid character is really a jerk. He is selfish, he drinks and curses too much, and he has a huge ego which contradicts the fact that he has zero accomplishments. His motives for becoming a superhero seem to be that he is bored and it would be cool not that he genuinely wants to help people. He is lazy yet he wants to take all of the credit from the hard working Kato. Clark Kent and Peter Parker are characters the fans root for and identify with- Rogan's Reid is not. I think you can mix comedy with superhero action but where this misses the mark is that it fails to present a hero that people can cheer on.

I had not previously seen the movie in the theater, so I was going cold into this. I did watch the original Green Hornet (with Bruce Lee), when it was initially shown.  First, the ads, commercials, and previews are taking up more and more time on these disks these days. In this case it was about 20 min worth, half of which were Sony ads for 3D. The Blu-Ray, itself, was ok - nice and crisp, good colors, etc. Amazon delivered it very promptly.Next, Bruce Lee is probably turning over in his grave about this movie. Superheroes should be superheroes. It's OK if they were initially bad and then realize that they should do good (examples - The Shadow and Iron Man). However, I have absolutely no empathy with this Green Hornet. He starts out as a spoiled brat and then goes around creating excess property damage of innocent people, especially with police cars. He also walks all over Kato and, in general, acts like a creep with his employees. When he tears up those police cars and then rolls them, after a while you ask yourself, ""Was anyone hurt?""  I don't know if he ultimately repented, since after a hour and a half I gave up on it.In this movie they essentially ask the question, ""Is it ok to do bad things to achieve a good result?"" The answer is, of course, no. This guy isn't a role model for anyone. There are a bunch of other movies out in the theaters right now that are better (THOR?). Save your money on this one.

Or any interest in the radio show, or the comic books (if there were any) or anything to do with the Green Hornet. I am also sick to death of serious-as-hell comic book movies. I just saw the trailer for this movie and thought it looked good. And I am glad that I followed through and saw the movie.Granted, Seth Rogen's version of Britt Reid makes me want to give him a good beating, but not to worry, he receives that during the course of the movie.

1311899,A1CDJ52UT65XGE,B002ZG99B8,Lil MC,"[0, 1]","The Green Hornet is an excellent and beloved comic book/graphic novel entity.  In the 60's, The Green Hornet was given life on the television screen thanks to producer Bill Dozier, who had success with the campy 60's Batman.  The 60's Green Hornet was played by the sexy and charismatic Van Williams.  His side-kick, Kato, was played by martial arts legend Bruce Lee.  This incarnation was iconic and by far and away the absolute best.Hollywood has become so creatively dried up and barron that they constantly remake past successes.  Why is it everytime they remake something it seems like they endeavor to find the best ways to bastardize the original?This incarnation of The Green Hornet does just that.  This film bastardizes everything that is great and heroic about The Green Hornet.  The character of Britt Reid, in this film, has the exact opposite dicotamy of the original character.  Reid, in this film, is an arrogant, spoiled, degenerate of a character who engages in meaningless promiscuous sexual encounters and sexually harasses his assistant. (Gee, that's original.)  He seems to have no moral compass, no perceivable intelligence.  Watching him is literally painful.Cameron Diaz was cast as Reid's ever faithful assistant, Lenore Case (originally portrayed by Wende Wagner in the 60's).  All I can say about her is, ""Damn woman, you're 40! When are you gonna stop carrying on like you think you're still 20?""The only good parts of this film are the casting of Jay Chou as Kato.  He's extremely talented, charismatic, and sexy.  He is the only member of the cast who even remotely embodies any part of the iconic character.  Tom Wilkinson and Christoph Waltz perform well in their roles.  However, the dialogue is cringe-worthy.I don't know what possesed Warner Bros. to think that casting Seth Rogen in the lead and letting him write the screenplay would be a good idea.  Have they not seen the grotesque low-grade garbage he's starred in before?I am so tired of seeing movies that star this off-beat douchebags like the Seth Rogens, the Jonah Hills, the Michael Ceras, and the Napoleon Dynamites.  It may have been funny in one film, two max.  Hello, It's NOT COOL ANYMORE!!I saw this film when it premiered on Starz.  I tried to watch it objectively but had to shut it off after 30 minutes, just like another reviewer.  The film was literally painful to watch.  It is a travesty to comic book films, not that they have been on much of an upward move.  (Wait until The Dark Knight Rises, The Amazing Spider-man, and Man of Steel are released.  I wouldn't have too high hopes for them.  Especially if you've seen some of the images and video leaked on the web.)I have never been so glad to NOT have spent money to watch a film in all my life.  The Green Hornet is a prime example of the oncoming death of the superhero film, especially if you keep letting people who made this train wreck make other comic book adaptations.If you are thinking about buying this film, Save yourself the trouble and hit yourself with a hammer instead. That pain will eventually subside.  The pain of watching this film lasts forever.  I'm thinking about starting a support group with my therapist.

1311908,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG99B8,Mark Turner,"[1, 3]","In the sixties the comic book icon Batman was turned into a television series that was low on detective seasoning and high on camp. The show became so popular that it was soon followed by a spin off, The Green Hornet, based on the pulp fiction/radio show character from the past. The show never took off like Batman did, but it did introduce the world to martial arts expert Bruce Lee as the Hornet's sidekick Kato. Talk of a new film version of the series went on for years, even Kevin Smith the director of CLERKS was involved at one point. So fans were delighted to see the Hornet finally appear on the big screen.Seth Rogen stars as Britt Reid, the goofball son of publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). The senior Reid puts out The Daily Sentinel, a newspaper that prides itself on reporting the real news and focuses on the issues of crime that happen daily in Los Angeles. When suddenly dies of a bee sting, Britt is left in charge as well as left to finally grow up.Despondent at first and unable to fill his father's shoes, Britt turns to the man who took care of his father's cars and who made his coffee, Kato (Jay Chou). In Kato he discovers a kindred spirit; someone who loved yet felt much anger at his father and a man who feels a need for heroes much as Britt does.Through a misadventure in which they save a couple from an attack by thugs, the pair decides to take on crime in LA. Kato sets out pimping their ride, a car now armed to the gills with missiles, machine guns, a flame thrower and more. Then Britt turns the newspaper on its ear, insisting that they do extensive coverage of the Hornet, going so far as to come up with his name. The next thing they do is hire an assistant for Britt, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), who knows more about crime than he does, going so far as to predict what the Green Hornet will do next. In truth, her predictions become their directions.It seems that the entire criminal element in LA is run by one man, Benjamin Chudnovsky (Christoph Waltz), a bloodthirsty criminal who has made it his life's ambition to control crime from top to bottom. Chudnovsky makes a point of striking fear in those who would oppose him. And when the Green Hornet starts interfering with his operations, the Hornet becomes his number one target.So does it work? In some ways very much so but in most not quite. As with the recent GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, we're presented with a star that needs someone to rein him in, to mold him into the character rather than have the character twist into something its not. Rogen can be a great actor at times but here he tends to run wild and use certain mannerisms that he has in past roles, none of which tend to enhance the character of Britt Reid. Instead much of the movie has Britt as the same goofball he was when the film started except rather than party non-stop he behaves like a kid who finally gets the chance to play the hero. It would have been nice to see the change in Britt come about far earlier in the film than it does and to have left more of the comedy out. The story deserves more action and less comedy.Chou does a great job of presenting himself here. Pretty much an unknown in the U.S., he does a fantastic job of combining martial arts mastery with acting ability, much like Bruce Lee did when first starting out. The scenes with Chou feel more like the Green Hornet than do those with Rogen.The supporting cast seems just to be walking through. Waltz shows less of the menace in his character here than he did in INGLORIOUS BASTARDS. And Diaz seems to have such a minor part as to nearly qualify as a cameo.Much of the film comes together towards the last 20 minutes or so. It would have been nice to see many of the things that work well there happen 30 minutes earlier and the movie be taken a bit more seriously than it was. Instead, while entertaining enough, the film seems more like a Seth Rogen vehicle and less a comic hero film. Was it enough to garner a sequel? Doubtful, the box office wasn't stupendous, something Hollywood expects these days. If one does come about, let's hope they find a director willing to tell Rogen to rope it in and to play it straight for once. He has the ability, now he needs someone in charge to convince him of it.",3,"MORE HUMOR, LESS STING",1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,4247,"['sixties', 'comic', 'book', 'icon', 'Batman', 'was', 'turned', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'low', 'detective', 'seasoning', 'high', 'camp', 'show', 'became', 'so', 'popular', 'was', 'soon', 'followed', 'spin', 'off', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'based', 'pulp', 'fiction/radio', 'show', 'character', 'past', 'show', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'Batman', 'did', 'did', 'introduce', 'world', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Hornet', 'sidekick', 'Kato', 'Talk', 'new', 'film', 'version', 'series', 'went', 'years', 'even', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'director', 'CLERKS', 'was', 'involved', 'one', 'point', 'So', 'fans', 'were', 'delighted', 'see', 'Hornet', 'finally', 'appear', 'big', 'screen.Seth', 'Rogen', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'goofball', 'son', 'publisher', 'James', 'Reid', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'senior', 'Reid', 'out', 'Daily', 'Sentinel', 'newspaper', 'reporting', 'real', 'news', 'focuses', 'issues', 'crime', 'happen', 'daily', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'When', 'suddenly', 'dies', 'bee', 'sting', 'Britt', 'left', 'charge', 'as', 'well', 'left', 'finally', 'grow', 'up.Despondent', 'first', 'unable', 'fill', 'father', 'shoes', 'Britt', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'father', 'cars', 'who', 'made', 'coffee', 'Kato', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'Kato', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'someone', 'who', 'loved', 'yet', 'felt', 'much', 'anger', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'need', 'heroes', 'much', 'Britt', 'misadventure', 'save', 'couple', 'attack', 'thugs', 'pair', 'take', 'crime', 'LA', 'Kato', 'out', 'pimping', 'ride', 'car', 'now', 'armed', 'gills', 'missiles', 'machine', 'guns', 'flame', 'thrower', 'more', 'Then', 'Britt', 'newspaper', 'ear', 'insisting', 'do', 'extensive', 'coverage', 'Hornet', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'come', 'up', 'name', 'next', 'thing', 'do', 'hire', 'assistant', 'Britt', 'Lenore', 'Case', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'more', 'crime', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'predict', 'what', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'truth', 'predictions', 'become', 'directions.It', 'entire', 'criminal', 'element', 'LA', 'run', 'one', 'man', 'Benjamin', 'Chudnovsky', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'bloodthirsty', 'criminal', 'who', 'made', 'life', 'ambition', 'control', 'crime', 'top', 'bottom', 'Chudnovsky', 'point', 'striking', 'fear', 'who', 'would', 'oppose', 'when', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'interfering', 'operations', 'Hornet', 'number', 'one', 'target.So', 'work', 'ways', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'most', 'not', 'quite', 'recent', 'GULLIVER', 'TRAVELS', ""'re"", 'presented', 'star', 'someone', 'rein', 'mold', 'character', 'rather', 'have', 'character', 'twist', 'something', 'not', 'Rogen', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'actor', 'times', 'here', 'run', 'wild', 'use', 'certain', 'mannerisms', 'past', 'roles', 'none', 'tend', 'enhance', 'character', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'Instead', 'much', 'movie', 'Britt', 'same', 'goofball', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'started', 'rather', 'party', 'non-stop', 'kid', 'who', 'finally', 'chance', 'play', 'hero', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'change', 'Britt', 'come', 'far', 'earlier', 'film', 'have', 'left', 'more', 'comedy', 'story', 'more', 'action', 'less', 'comedy.Chou', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', 'here', 'Pretty', 'much', 'unknown', 'U.S.', 'fantastic', 'job', 'combining', 'martial', 'arts', 'mastery', 'acting', 'ability', 'much', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'starting', 'out', 'scenes', 'Chou', 'feel', 'more', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'do', 'Rogen.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'be', 'walking', 'Waltz', 'less', 'menace', 'character', 'here', 'did', 'INGLORIOUS', 'BASTARDS', 'Diaz', 'have', 'minor', 'part', 'nearly', 'qualify', 'cameo.Much', 'film', 'together', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'many', 'things', 'work', 'well', 'there', 'happen', '30', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'movie', 'be', 'taken', 'bit', 'more', 'seriously', 'was', 'Instead', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'film', 'more', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'vehicle', 'less', 'comic', 'hero', 'film', 'Was', 'enough', 'garner', 'sequel', 'Doubtful', 'box', 'office', 'was', ""n't"", 'stupendous', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'one', 'come', 'let', 'hope', 'find', 'director', 'willing', 'tell', 'Rogen', 'rope', 'play', 'straight', 'once', 'ability', 'now', 'someone', 'charge', 'convince']",N/A

People rarely criticize Steve Carrell when he does comedy/action movies, so why criticize Seth Rogan in exactly the same genre?? No, this is not an award-winning superhero movie. Yes, Seth plays a bumbling moron; but that's what makes this movie so fun! I love the juxaposition of the idiot Hornet and bad-@$$ Kato. No, it's not accurate to the comic books, but it is insanely funny. And the action in the movie was extremely well-done and creative.Quite frankly, I don't understand why this movie is getting worse reviews than any of the Transformers movies - the script and story are much better.

I also don't recall ever reading the comic book or hearing the radio show.Truthfully, superhero movies are not really my thing.  I may have enjoyed them thirty years ago, but I have long since outgrown that sort of entertainment.Thus, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I started viewing this new version of THE GREEN HORNET, primarily because it's really a spoof of the genre.  Much of the film works, but also much of it doesn't work.As all loyal followers of this superhero know, The Green Hornet is a masked vigilante whose real identity is multi-millionaire Britt Reid, and his trusted sidekick, Kato, assists him.In this version, Reid is played as a wealthy, egotistical, somewhat cowardly, schmuck who dreams of being a superhero, and it's his driver, Kato, who is really the brains and the kick-ass brawn of the duo.That's a very funny concept, and it works quite a bit of the time...until it becomes tired, repetitive and disintegrates into little more than a special effects/CGI action movie.  That's sad, because this picture could have become a classic lampoon, much like MEN IN BLACK was to sci-fi films.Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the uneven screenplay with Evan Goldberg, is quite good as Reid and Jay Chou is a perfect choice for Kato.  However, it's Christoph Waltz' amusing, low-key playing of the demented super-villain that you'll remember most in this handsomely produced film.Michel Gondry directed a top supporting cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos.

Overall, it was a good effort to put this film forward but could have used a better villein and better editing. On the other hand I still enjoyed this film. I liked it with us showing Reid developing the Green Hornet rather than in the shows with Green Hornet as is. However, the flaw with the series was always the villeins were really not very impressive, simply put they were ordinary criminals for the most part with little characater or charisma. They could do a bit better with better villeins and characters.

Seth Rogen is a weird choice for the lead role in any kind of action movie. He is basically just playing a slight variation of all the other lazy losers of his past films. He does get his moments to shine in the realm of comedy, but he is mostly overshadowed by the sidekick role, Kato, played by Jay Chou. He is by far the more interesting character, though he and Rogen do have a few moments of humorous interactions. Cameron Diaz seems to be here to just add a bigger name to the cast and even Christoph Waltz, so good in Inglourious Basterds, doesn't hit the right notes as the villain. It's kind of funny that my favorite scene happens within minutes after the start. I'll just say it involves an extended cameo from James Franco, who I had no idea was even going to be in the movie.I did appreciate the mixture of comedic relief to go along with the action, but I think the violence could have been toned down some. It seemed out of place. I mean, these ""heroes"" have a higher body count than the bad guys. I guess the Batman way of catching rather than killing the bad guys is just too much work when you can just spray them with bullets or stab wood stakes into their eyes. Yes, that does happen here.I must say that the large crowd I saw it with may have swayed my enjoyment to the more positive side. They laughed at almost everything. As I left the theater, most people seemed to be of the opinion that it wasn't outstanding, but that it was much better than they thought it would be going in. Those were my thoughts as well.

1311929,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B002ZG99B8,Moviedude,"[1, 2]","The fact that I got this movie as a gift from a coworker who couldn't finish it herself should have told me something...So anyhow. Green Hornet is a modern updating of the classic pulp detective franchise, although it owes more to the TV show with Bruce Lee than the older properties. Left with tons of free time, poor self esteem, and a chip on his shoulder that nobody who owns a Bugatti should possess, newspaper heir Britt Ried (Seth Rogan) teams up with his boffin mechanic and barrista (this is a surprisingly big plot point) Kato (Jay Chou). Armed with a bulletproof car and the fighting skills of a movie Chinese guy (outstanding) and a doughy comedian (horrible) they wage a two-man war on crime, mostly for kicks. Cameron Diaz is there too but as in all of her movies, contributes nothing of meaning.The film itself is a pretty inoffensive buddy action comedy, and I might have enjoyed it except for three things:-Bizarre Benny-Hill style under-cranking used during practically any long cut-Seth Rogan-The writing (which is like 50% part of the Seth Rogan element)The Benny Hill-vision is self explanatory so I'll jump to Rogan. He is, as always, horrible- a bleating frat boy with the voice of a muppet, zero comic timing, and surprisingly bad posture for a professional actor. Rogan waddles around the film talking over other actors, blurting humorless non-sequiters, and generally trying to evince the sort of ""such an ass he's charming"" ambiance as Vince Vaughn. Mr. Rogan, I have watched Vince Vaughn movies, and you are no Vince Vaughn. Chou is an exact opposite to Rogan, a blank slate with no personality save for a subtly murderous aggression. This is actually not unfaithful to Bruce Lee in many ways, but since Chou has very little screen presence and all his fights are wirework and CG, the emulation is incomplete at best. The writing is poor because there is far too much of it for this kind of film. Characters take long roundabout ways to say everything they say, awkward pauses go on so long they stop being funny and start seeming accidental, and the less said about the villain's interminable waxing on bad guy fashion the better.There are doubtlessly people who will love this movie with all their hearts- the very easily impressed, for instance, who feel that the awful delivery of this movie's terrible dialog is actually clever, or the very old who are happy that there IS a Green Hornet movie then go to sleep five minutes in. But if you want the experience of past Green Hornet material, skip this pile. And if you just want a flashy movie based on pulp characters, Alec Baldwin's The Shadow or even Billy Zane's The Phantom (Slam Evil!) will both serve you better.PROS-There's a scene where Kato is making coffee and Jay Chou's stunt hands (apparently Mr. Chou cannot make espresso and couldn't be bothered to learn) show you how to make a sweet leaf pattern in the top with cream.-The film ends at some point.CONS-Horrible acting and punishing dialog are murderous to endure.-Seth Rogan is puppy-kicking unappealing and therefore a poor choice for the eponymous hero of the film.-Kato's kung-fu sequences which should be a high point are instead silly music videos in which cables flail Mr. Chou at a bunch of stuntmen.-You will guess every plot twist 120 minutes before it occurs. That's right, if you GUESS how the whole film goes right before you watch it, you will already know everything that happens.THINGS TO WATCH FOR-The late Mister Ried owns a car collection far in excess of what the owner of a single local paper could probably afford. Especially noteworthy is a scene in which Rogan systematically makes out with a party girl in every car in the garage, yet shies away from doing the deed in a Veyron. One assumes that there is simply no insurance that covers Seth Rogan defiling a 1.5 million dollar supercar (and wisely so).-Kato goes overboard with the secret identity stuff. Like WAY overboard. His crime fighting car is hidden under and behind TWO OTHER PARKED CARS, a trick wall, and a hedge, and can still conceal all its weaponry. Note that he still gleefully wrecks it into cop cars and the environment at every opportunity.-The villain has a trademark semi-automatic with two offset barrels. Neither seems to have an action of any kind, or a magazine.

I didn't even run to rent this, but found myself with a free rental and nothing else looked interesting that I hadn't seen yet.To my surprise this film was very funny and even though purist will cringe at the liberties taken with the original story, this film is a refreshing goof on superhero films. First off, we have a hero who is delusional and so inept, that his ""sidekick"" is really the driving force behind all his power and intelligence. Kato played by scene chewing Jay Chou is the perfect balance for Rogen's flippant style and the two make for a very unconventional team, with a refreshing rapport that I haven't seen in these types of films before.I gave this film 5 stars because I think there are way too many 1 star reviews for this misunderstood action movie and maybe with a little push this film will be recognized for its witty and undeniable original take on the super hero movie. 4 stars for a jolly good time and making me eat my words!",5,KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND YOU'LL ENJOY THIS FILM! 4 STARS!,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,1130,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'year', 'ago', 'heart', 'sank', 'looked', 'disaster', 'unfold', 'right', 'front', 'mean', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'run', 'rent', 'found', 'free', 'rental', 'nothing', 'else', 'looked', 'interesting', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet.To', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'even', 'purist', 'will', 'cringe', 'liberties', 'taken', 'original', 'story', 'film', 'refreshing', 'goof', 'superhero', 'films', 'First', 'off', 'have', 'hero', 'who', 'delusional', 'so', 'inept', 'sidekick', 'really', 'driving', 'force', 'power', 'intelligence', 'Kato', 'played', 'scene', 'chewing', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'perfect', 'balance', 'Rogen', 'flippant', 'style', 'two', 'make', 'very', 'unconventional', 'team', 'refreshing', 'rapport', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'types', 'films', 'before.I', 'gave', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'think', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'misunderstood', 'action', 'movie', 'maybe', 'little', 'push', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'witty', 'undeniable', 'original', 'take', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'jolly', 'good', 'time', 'making', 'eat', 'words']",N/A

1311944,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B002ZG99B8,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[5, 11]","What's not to like about The Green Hornet? Yes: a rhetorical question.Well, it's big, it's loud, it's daft, it's funny and it's utterly preposterous. Will you, if you're a normally adjusted adult, be entertained? Yes, you will.Seth Rogen, as you'd expect a seasoned stand-up to, aces every line for comic effect in his performance as Britt Reid, millionaire newspaper heir and crime-fighting party animal. He has a barista black-belt, martial arts-toting sidekick called Kato with a garage full of bad-ass souped up Camaros (pedants: they're Chrysler Imperials, but they *sound* like Camaros, and I want one - with or without rocket launchers). Indeed, Kato is so competent that he presents a plot dilemma: Why does he even need the Green Hornet in the first place? He can do Bruce Lee's one inch punch. He can design sports cars. He even knows how to make those funny fern leaves in the froth on a cappuccino. And he shows us: bonus.The film also boasts Cameron Diaz, with all that implies including, as her standard terms and conditions of engagement apparently demand, an entry in which she winsomely sashays in and wallops the camera with a shameless ""it's me! Cutesie Cameron Diaz!"" gurn. The producers failed to accompany this, as their contractual obligations surely require, with Gary Wright'sDream Weaver, which no doubt led to some anxious exchanges with her agents and lawyers when they saw the rushes. Still, comedy was extracted (bravely, from Diaz' perspective) from the fact that her character, at the tender age of 36, is knocking on a bit. (Diaz is 38!). But not to the point where more couldn't be extracted from Rogen's covetous glances at her backside.Yet at the same time The Green Hornet has a body count, some cheerily gruesome deaths and a wanton demolition quotient that reaches back in time past Bruce Willis'Die Hardfranchise and yearns for mid-eighties Arnie Schwarzenegger prime carnage. So: it will definitely go over well with the boy racers and even the rest of the cinema-going constituency would have to be a bit churlish not to be swept along. Which isn't to say some of them won't be.There is, of course, stuff not to like, but much of that falls squarely in the sour-puss cinema snob category. But here it is, for the record:Firstly, the film has evidently had a difficult midwifery. It has been optioned on and off since 1990 and has had more directors, producers, screenwriters and actors ""associated with the project"", many walking out as a result of ""creative differences"", than most films not directed by Alan Smithee, and even the release of this final version seems to have been plagued by delays (who orchestrates the global release of a film a week after schools have gone back in January? Were they that scared ofTron Legacy?)Furthermore - and yes, this is a pet, well, bee in my bonnet but I'm going to say it anyway - this film is in 3D and it absolutely shouldn't be, save for the closing credits and one classy Brian De Palma-style split screen sequence when, oddly, each ""screenlet"" was actually in 2D, just arrayed differently in 3D space. Otherwise, there really wasn't much call for, or use of, 3D, and it didn't look much good, to the point where I wondered whether it was added in post production, a la the train wreck that wasThe Last Airbender. A subsequent browsing of the blogosphere would suggest this is indeed the case.There's also the possibility that venerable superhero lore is being permanently trashed here. The original Green Hornet radio series is ancient: it predates Superman by a couple of years and, from what I can tell, it was rather earnest fare with less enduring legacy than Superman, and this big budget farce, which upends it in every conceivable way, may consign it forever to oblivion. A more reverend take may have been more interesting: Even the 1960s TV series, in which Kato was played by a young Bruce Lee, might have been a better setting (opening up the possibilities of some Mad Men styling) than the rather dull, present day. Indeed, modern technology presents some plot difficulties with which the screenwriters failed to adequately deal: armed with the critical MacGuffin, a USB drive full of incriminating evidence, our heroes race across town, batman style, to their newspaper offices to post it to the internet. Er, come again? You have a custom built rocket propelled car, but you don't have wifi?)In any case, it sounds as though every possible approach has been tried and rejected, and at the end of the day what we're left with is a pretty entertaining night at the movies. And that, I dare say, is what the Studio was aiming for. Rogen was candid enough about that on the red carpet in Los Angeles this evening: Asked if there would be a sequel he said, ""I would definitely be open to it, but until the movie makes a lot of money we haven't really thought about that"".Remains to be seen. But well worth a look in the mean time, if you need cheering up on a cold January day.Olly Buxton",4,Something for everyone - even trainee baristas,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,4988,"['What', 'not',

I've never seen him in another movie and I can't remember ever seeing him on TV. But I know he's a comedian, so right away I knew that this was to be an unconventional treatment of this conventional comic book premise. I liked it. I thought it was amusing - not hilarious - just amusing.The problem is that, this one not particularly funny joke runs thin after a while. The Green Hornet is played as an overweight couch potato - got it, what's next?Fifty years ago Hollywood fought against the prejudice by whites against orientals. Famously in ""The Sand Pebbles"" Steve McQueen says that Chinese can't work on the boat's engine because they are too stupid. For them, he says it's all monkey see - monkey do. Much of the rest of the movie is devoted to affirming that the Chinese are indeed smart enough to serve as an assistant to an enlisted  mechanic (McQueen) on a large but rather simple boat engine.This sort of plot wouldn't work today. Many of us drive Japanese cars and all of have Japanese or Korean electronics in our homes. Today oriental connotes brains especially engineering brains. But now we have swung too far the other way. Now we have a Cato - who was in the person of Bruce Lee just a simple kick ass chauffer - revealed as a genius inventor, sort of like the character of Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"". The new Cato is no longer submissive. He provides some real dominant and assertive manliness to compensate for the chubby dweeb who plays the Green Hornet. This itself is a problem. Bruce Lee as Cato was a servant who knew his place. He faded into the background. That made it surprising and entertaining when in a crisis he revealed himself to be a kung-fu master. Bruce Lee's Cato was a foil to the stiff but conventionally heroic Grant Williams. He was all of the fun in that long ago TV series. Alas this new Cato is just not much fun.That's OK - got it, what's next?Well there is also Cameron Diaz. But she is almost completely a negative presense on screen. She's just too old. The men in the screenplay all react to her as if she were some super attractive hottie. But your lying eyes this time are truthful. She looks tired, even haggard. Her looks have faded and she always had marginal features. Without youth she has nothing to contribute. She was never beautiful but she used to be cute.So my advice is - rent it, watch it but don't be afraid to turn it off after a hour or so.",3,Out of Gas after the First Hour,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,2450,"['Seth', 'Rogan', 'rather', 'obscure', 'comedian', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'TV', 'know', 'comedian', 'so', 'right', 'away', 'knew', 'was', 'be', 'unconventional', 'treatment', 'conventional', 'comic', 'book', 'premise', 'liked', 'thought', 'was', 'amusing', 'not', 'hilarious', 'just', 'amusing.The', 'problem', 'one', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'joke', 'runs', 'thin', 'while', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'played', 'overweight', 'couch', 'potato', 'got', 'what', 'next', 'Fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'Hollywood', 'fought', 'prejudice', 'whites', 'orientals', 'Famously', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Chinese', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'boat', 'engine', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'monkey', 'see', 'monkey', 'do', 'Much', 'rest', 'movie', 'devoted', 'affirming', 'Chinese', 'are', 'indeed', 'smart', 'enough', 'serve', 'assistant', 'enlisted', 'mechanic', 'McQueen', 'large', 'rather', 'simple', 'boat', 'engine.This', 'sort', 'plot', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'today', 'Many', 'drive', 'Japanese', 'cars', 'have', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'electronics', 'homes', 'Today', 'oriental', 'connotes', 'brains', 'especially', 'engineering', 'brains', 'now', 'have', 'swung', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'way', 'Now', 'have', 'Cato', 'who', 'was', 'person', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'just', 'simple', 'kick', 'ass', 'chauffer', 'revealed', 'genius', 'inventor', 'sort', 'character', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'new', 'Cato', 'no', 'longer', 'submissive', 'real', 'dominant', 'assertive', 'manliness', 'compensate', 'chubby', 'dweeb', 'who', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'problem', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Cato', 'was', 'servant', 'who', 'knew', 'place', 'faded', 'background', 'made', 'surprising', 'entertaining', 'when', 'crisis', 'revealed', 'be', 'kung-fu', 'master', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Cato', 'was', 'foil', 'stiff', 'conventionally', 'heroic', 'Grant', 'Williams', 'was', 'fun', 'long', 'ago', 'TV', 'series', 'Alas', 'new', 'Cato', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'fun.That', 'OK', 'got', 'what', 'next', 'Well', 'also', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'almost', 'completely', 'negative', 'presense', 'screen', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'men', 'screenplay', 'react', 'were', 'super', 'attractive', 'hottie', 'lying', 'eyes', 'time', 'are', 'truthful', 'tired', 'even', 'haggard', 'looks', 'have', 'faded', 'always', 'had', 'marginal', 'features', 'youth', 'nothing', 'contribute', 'was', 'never', 'beautiful', 'used', 'be', 'cute.So', 'advice', 'rent', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'turn', 'off', 'hour', 'so']",N/A

To compare it to the television series of 1966-67 is a little disingenuous to say the least, since the concept reaches as far back as the 1930's on radio. So, in looking at the reviews here that cast a disparaging view upon the movie based upon the television program one must consider them ill conceived. The movie is faithful to the original concept. Reid takes the guise of a hero posing as a villain.Kato has changed over the years, though. Originally Kato was Japanese, but as the show developed he morphed into a Filipino character (probably due to World War II). I don't recall any reference to nationality in the television series, but probably due to Bruce Lee's influence the character is purely Chinese today. It would make more sense for Kato to be Filipino today, but here we are.So many of the reviews I have seen are negative, and yet I see nothing in the movie that calls for it. This movie deserves better from its audience. Go back again watch the 1966-67 series and if you really think things were better then, well I just can't conceive of why anyone would.

Having no knowledge of either, I watched this film with no pre-conceived expectations. And, I love it. This is NOT a typical superhero movie. Maybe that's why it's so good.(mild spoilers)We are spared much of the nonsense found in superhero movies because, for starters, this is a comedy.  The bad guy is crazy, the good guys (at least one) are awesome, but we accept it easily because it just fits. Secondly, we're not dealing with picture perfect, self-sacrificing heroes. There's one nice guy, and one self-absorbed, egotistical schmuck; one butt-kicking fighter, and one self-important whiner; one always-got-a-solution-can-do-anything-and-everything-guy, and one privileged clown with no practical experience or knowledge. And yet, they make a great team.The story itself is decent - neither superb nor awful. It is the characters that make it, however. Seth Rogen (the Green Hornet) is the key here...his acting is what makes his character come alive (and if you don't think he's believable, that's just because you have not met someone like his character [yet, anyway]!) Jay Chou's Kato is perfect, as is Christopher Waltz' psycho ""Bloodnofsky"". Cameron Diaz's enthusiastic crime-fighter reporter is superb (although farrrrr too tolerant of Reid...). Everyone does a great job, and the bungling twists and turns of their saga keep you on the edge of your seat.

1311960,A39W3263A9HCMN,B002ZG99B8,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[4, 10]","That's right. It seems as if it is being forgotten why exactly we go to the movies... to be entertained. To go to a movie and watch it and have fun. Not every movie is meant to be Academy bait, and as much as I love a good Oscar bait flick as much as anyone, I also like to go to movies that are supposed to be brainless fun- after all, that's why I go to movies, right? As a form of scape. Ah, but it's not like the elitists know how to have fun anyway, because after all The Green Hornet- No me likey superheroes!!! Me likey psychotic lesbo ballerinas!!!!!That said, I will admit I was a tad skeptical- I wasn't very immersed in the Green Hornet world as I did not grow up with it, but the trailer looked fun and I was excited to see it, so my buddy and I went and saw it today. And I walked out colored had-fun!!! Like I said, I knew absolutely nothing about Green Hornet when I went in, as I had went to see it not based on nostalgia but entertainment alone, and I got what I wanted- a fun old, funny, quality time at the cinema that was full of laughs and action. So maybe I lose credibility there as I wasn't a fan before the film. But now I can confirm that my childhood already good childhood would be MUCH better if I grew up with Green Hornet!!!BrittReid has had a troubled relationship with his dad ever since he was a young one. Now grown up and an heir to his dad's newspaper The Daily Sentinel, he always thought his dad was a selfish jerk, and his dad being found dead from a supposed bee sting doesn't make it better. Being left the newspaper and meeting his coffee maker for the first time after firing him, named Kato, Britt is under pressure. But Britt and Kato begin to bond after Kato shows some of the 'wares, and one night after stealing the head of the golden statue of his dad and kicking some butt, they decide with Kato's technology and Britt's motivation- it's time to be superheroes.But they aren't the superheroes you'd wake up every Saturday morning and tune to your cartoon channel to watch. No, they are way different. They protect the law... by breaking it. Furthermore, the Sentinel dons them the name ""The Green Hornet"", and they find a villain- Chudnofsky, a man with a hard name to pronounce, who is a Russian mobster who plans to bring together LA's mob families.... and the man that Britt's dad was planning to expose!!!I will say one more time that I am surprised that we've forgotten how to have a good time at the cinema! Sure this film isn't going to win any Oscars and bait gleaming reviews from the critics- one particular offender being Roger Ebert. But then again I stopped taking him seriously years ago, so not much I can do there, besides he gave Country Strong a positive review. This film is fun, and what's all you need to expect!It's full of action. It's full of thrills. It is overexaggerated and it's unrealistic as hell. But that's the point! It's a superhero movie people. None of you complained when in The Dark Knight, Batman fell a great height from the party in the building, survived without a broken bone. The action scenes are awesomely well done, with great use of slo-mo, and even in 3D, the ""Kato-vision"" scenes looked awesome. The fight scene in the middle between Kato and Britt that goes on and on was probably the funniest scene, as you'd expect to get tired, but it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes on.So overall, if yo have a brain you are willing to turn off for 2 hours and just sit back and enjoy pure fun, you will enjoy the Green Hornet. My only quibble is that there wasn't enough Christoph Waltz, but then again, I had tonnes of fun- too much to care about that, so I ain't complaining there. Just go and watch and have fun, as this is a great start to the new year's movie season, and a must see for belly laughs, action and quality dialogue.Oh, and you will believe a car can drive when it's split in half!",4,The stupidity of film critics and elitists is growing much bigger than I'd imagined,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,3906,"['right', 'being', 'forgotten', 'why', 'exactly', 'go', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'go', 'movie', 'watch', 'have', 'fun', 'Not', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'Academy', 'bait', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'good', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'flick', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'also', 'like', 'go', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'brainless', 'fun-', 'why', 'go', 'movies', 'right', 'form', 'scape', 'Ah', 'not', 'elitists', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'anyway', 'Green', 'Hornet-', 'No', 'superheroes', 'Me', 'likey', 'psychotic', 'lesbo', 'ballerinas', 'said', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'tad', 'skeptical-', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'immersed', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'trailer', 'looked', 'fun', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'buddy', 'went', 'saw', 'today', 'walked', 'out', 'colored', 'had-fun', 'said', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'when', 'went', 'had', 'went', 'see', 'not', 'based', 'nostalgia', 'entertainment', 'alone', 'got', 'what', 'wanted-', 'fun', 'old', 'funny', 'quality', 'time', 'cinema', 'was', 'full', 'laughs', 'action', 'maybe', 'lose', 'credibility', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'film', 'now', 'can', 'confirm', 'childhood', 'already', 'good', 'childhood', 'would', 'be', 'MUCH', 'better', 'grew', 'up', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'BrittReid', 'had', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'dad', 'ever', 'was', 'young', 'one', 'Now', 'up', 'heir', 'dad', 'newspaper', 'Daily', 'Sentinel', 'always', 'thought', 'dad', 'was', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'dad', 'being', 'found', 'dead', 'supposed', 'bee', 'sting', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'Being', 'left', 'newspaper', 'meeting', 'coffee', 'maker', 'first', 'time', 'firing', 'named', 'Kato', 'Britt', 'pressure', 'Britt', 'Kato', 'begin', 'bond', 'Kato', ""'wares"", 'one', 'night', 'stealing', 'head', 'golden', 'statue', 'dad', 'kicking', 'butt', 'decide', 'Kato', 'technology', 'Britt', 'motivation-', 'time', 'be', 'superheroes.But', 'are', ""n't"", 'superheroes', ""'d"", 'wake', 'up', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'tune', 'cartoon', 'channel', 'watch', 'No', 'are', 'way', 'different', 'protect', 'law', 'breaking', 'Furthermore', 'Sentinel', 'name', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'find', 'villain-', 'Chudnofsky', 'man', 'hard', 'name', 'pronounce', 'who', 'Russian', 'mobster', 'who', 'bring', 'together', 'LA', 'mob', 'families', 'man', 'Britt', 'dad', 'was', 'planning', 'expose', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'am', 'surprised', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'cinema', 'Sure', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'Oscars', 'bait', 'gleaming', 'reviews', 'critics-', 'one', 'particular', 'offender', 'being', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'then', 'again', 'stopped', 'taking', 'seriously', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'there', 'gave', 'Country', 'Strong', 'positive', 'review', 'film', 'fun', 'what', 'need', 'expect', 'full', 'action', 'full', 'thrills', 'overexaggerated', 'unrealistic', 'hell', 'point', 'superhero', 'movie', 'people', 'None', 'complained', 'when', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'fell', 'great', 'height', 'party', 'building', 'survived', 'broken', 'bone', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'awesomely', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'use', 'slo-mo', 'even', '3D', 'Kato-vision', 'scenes', 'looked', 'awesome', 'fight', 'scene', 'middle', 'Kato', 'Britt', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'scene', ""'d"", 'expect', 'get', 'tired', 'just', 'funnier', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'on.So', 'overall', 'yo', 'have', 'brain', 'are', 'willing', 'turn', 'off', '2', 'hours', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'pure', 'fun', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'only', 'quibble', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'then', 'again', 'had', 'tonnes', 'fun-', 'too', 'much', 'care', 'ai', ""n't"", 'complaining', 'there', 'Just', 'go', 'watch', 'have', 'fun', 'great', 'start', 'new', 'year', 'movie', 'season', 'must', 'see', 'belly', 'laughs', 'action', 'quality', 'dialogue.Oh', 'will', 'believe', 'car', 'can', 'drive', 'when', 'split', 'half']",N/A

Now I still wish it never got made. I didn't think anyone could make a Green Hornet movie so stupid.The so-called humor you could see it coming, such as when Brett asked Kato for the gas gun then shot him with it. Also the humor wasn't funny.Katos fighting looks a lot like the Matrix, wich is now getting kind of old.All that shooting and destruction was seen in almost every episodes of the A-Team tv show. The bad part is when the hero does most of the shooting and damage  he is no longer a hero. He is even less when he does malicous vandalism.It was the police who thought the Green Hornet was on the wrong side of the law and Bret took adventage of it to take down those who are the real crooks. He did not make himself to look like the bad guy.By coincendence it seems Kato thought of everything like fixing the Black Beauty, a back wheel drive car, so it was also a front wheel drive in case the car was ripped in half so they can still drive off, but he didn't make it a four wheel drive.This movie is a waste of money and time. It's not worth calling it a B-movie. It's not worth the C- Entertainment Weekly gave it.

1311974,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B002ZG99B8,Russ Nickel,"[10, 14]","In an effort to battle the exorbitant cost of 3D movies (especially the ones that undergo 3D conversion post-production), I went to the Sunday matinee showing of The Green Hornet. I don't know if that's really the optimal environment for a superhero movie, but I do know that I felt super awesome seeing a movie by myself in a theater lightly sprinkled with moms. What made me even more awesome was my flirtation with the cute ticket taker and cashier, only to have them realize that I was friendless at the movies and therefore genetically undesirable for the production of offspring. But hey, free parking downtown on Sundays! Which makes me wonder...how many of those moms were actually angry San Luis Obispo meter maids?As my stylish RealD glasses weighed down on my nose (which, by the end of the movie, was acting rather affronted), the previews drew to a close, and what followed was a moderately entertaining film. By no means a perfect creation, The Green Hornet lived up to its Buzz with charm enough to overcome the fact that it was little more than a souped-up, buddy-cop movie. While its generic overarching plot had a bit of originality Nested here and there, what really kept things aloft was Seth Rogen's light-hearted tone and performance. Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) and Kato (Jay Chou) were fun characters to watch and had pretty good chemistry. I believed their friendship, their obligatory fallout, and their eventual reconciliation, and I laughed out loud at lines like ""Do some of that Ben Hur stuff!"" Sadly, I was the only one who laughed during the entire movie. Man, those parking enforcement officers really don't have souls.As always, Cameron Diaz was totally useless. She is the Queen of inane, managing to evoke a sense of lifelessness in every role. She Bumbles through her character, Droning on and basically adding nothing. At least it was a new take on the love interest. She wasn't really interested, and neither was she interesting. In fact, I feel like she was almost more objectified this way. Rather than either of the main characters forming a connection with her, she simply served as a vehicle for Britt and Kato's argument. I guess that's what they get for trying to stick their Proboscises where they don't belong.Speaking of vehicles, the Black Beauty was one of the sweetest cars ever. The sheer number of weapons and gadgets made it the coolest thing since MIB's red button. What wasn't particularly sweet was the bad guy. In an attempt at humor, the villain constantly worried about his image and his hard-to-pronounce name, and he was right to. He just wasn't intimidating. I never felt the Sting of real fear or the sweet Nectar of joy at any point during the film.One of the more interesting stylistic choices comes partway through the movie when the villain puts a bounty on the Green Hornet's head. The shot then enters an ever-expanding split screen as word of the reward spreads through all the different circles of evil, from the Thorax of malcontent to the Mandibles of hate. Watching the sheer number of thugs on the screen grow as they receive their mission really does add a sense of dread to an otherwise threat-free story. More and more split-screens kept showing up until I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't keep track of them anymore. I waited for the repercussions of this onslaught, only to watch as the group of villains murdered a ton of innocent people wearing green and then never reappeared. And just like that, the sense of dread was gone.The Green Hornet was basically fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and there's some entertaining action and comedy. In no way does it surpass expectations, however, and many other films are better able to embrace the genre. If you've got some extra cash and a bunch of guys are sitting around bored, it might be worth checking this out, but otherwise you should probably just wait until it's on Netflix.2.5/5 StarsCouldn't work these in: Venom, Insect, Antennae, Hive, Apoidea, VespaFor more reviews, check out thenickelscreen on wordpress!",3,Moderately Good!,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,4055,"['effort', 'battle', 'exorbitant', 'cost', '3D', 'movies', 'especially', 'ones', 'undergo', '3D', 'conversion', 'post-production', 'went', 'Sunday', 'matinee', 'showing', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'optimal', 'environment', 'superhero', 'movie', 'do', 'know', 'felt', 'super', 'awesome', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theater', 'lightly', 'sprinkled', 'moms', 'What', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'awesome', 'was', 'flirtation', 'cute', 'ticket', 'taker', 'cashier', 'only', 'have', 'realize', 'was', 'friendless', 'movies', 'therefore', 'genetically', 'undesirable', 'production', 'offspring', 'hey', 'free', 'parking', 'downtown', 'Sundays', 'Which', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'moms', 'were', 'actually', 'angry', 'San', 'Luis', 'Obispo', 'meter', 'maids', 'stylish', 'RealD', 'glasses', 'weighed', 'down', 'nose', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'acting', 'rather', 'affronted', 'previews', 'drew', 'close', 'what', 'followed', 'was', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'film', 'perfect', 'creation', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'lived', 'up', 'Buzz', 'charm', 'enough', 'overcome', 'fact', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'souped-up', 'buddy-cop', 'movie', 'generic', 'overarching', 'plot', 'had', 'bit', 'originality', 'Nested', 'here', 'there', 'what', 'really', 'kept', 'things', 'aloft', 'was', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'light-hearted', 'tone', 'performance', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Kato', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'were', 'fun', 'characters', 'watch', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'chemistry', 'believed', 'friendship', 'obligatory', 'fallout', 'eventual', 'reconciliation', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'lines', 'Do', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'stuff', 'Sadly', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'laughed', 'entire', 'movie', 'Man', 'parking', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'souls.As', 'always', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'was', 'totally', 'useless', 'Queen', 'inane', 'managing', 'evoke', 'sense', 'lifelessness', 'role', 'character', 'Droning', 'basically', 'adding', 'nothing', 'least', 'was', 'new', 'take', 'love', 'interest', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'was', 'interesting', 'fact', 'feel', 'was', 'almost', 'more', 'objectified', 'way', 'Rather', 'main', 'characters', 'forming', 'connection', 'simply', 'served', 'vehicle', 'Britt', 'Kato', 'argument', 'guess', 'what', 'get', 'trying', 'stick', 'Proboscises', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong.Speaking', 'vehicles', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'was', 'one', 'sweetest', 'cars', 'ever', 'sheer', 'number', 'weapons', 'gadgets', 'made', 'coolest', 'thing', 'MIB', 'red', 'button', 'What', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'sweet', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'attempt', 'humor', 'villain', 'constantly', 'worried', 'image', 'hard-to-pronounce', 'name', 'was', 'right', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'intimidating', 'never', 'felt', 'Sting', 'real', 'fear', 'sweet', 'Nectar', 'joy', 'point', 'film.One', 'more', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'partway', 'movie', 'when', 'villain', 'bounty', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'head', 'shot', 'then', 'ever-expanding', 'split', 'screen', 'word', 'reward', 'different', 'circles', 'evil', 'Thorax', 'malcontent', 'Mandibles', 'hate', 'Watching', 'sheer', 'number', 'thugs', 'screen', 'grow', 'receive', 'mission', 'really', 'add', 'sense', 'dread', 'otherwise', 'threat-free', 'story', 'More', 'more', 'split-screens', 'kept', 'showing', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'track', 'anymore', 'waited', 'repercussions', 'onslaught', 'only', 'watch', 'group', 'villains', 'murdered', 'ton', 'innocent', 'people', 'wearing', 'green', 'then', 'never', 'reappeared', 'just', 'sense', 'dread', 'was', 'gone.The', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'was', 'basically', 'fun', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'entertaining', 'action', 'comedy', 'way', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'however', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'better', 'able', 'embrace', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'got', 'extra', 'cash', 'bunch', 'guys', 'are', 'sitting', 'around', 'bored', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'otherwise', 'should', 'probably', 'just', 'wait', 'Netflix.2.5/5', 'StarsCould', ""n't"", 'work', 'Venom', 'Insect', 'Antennae', 'Hive', 'Apoidea', 'VespaFor', 'more', 'reviews', 'check', 'out', 'thenickelscreen', 'wordpress']",N/A

Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet is also the executive producer and the co-screenwriter so this is clearly his baby.I loved the fast cars, the incredible skill of Kato and the egocentric jerk that is Britt Ried! His egomania really gets on Kato's goat and they fight it out with each other -- a slapstick fight that was a bit boring I must admit.Lenore Love Interest:Catherine Diaz plays the secretary who through her criminology knowledge actually unwittingly helping them out with her explanation of gang profile. The subplot of a love triangle was not played up which is fine, since that was not the main theme anyway!The bad guy wants to control all of LA crime. He is paranoid and lives on a trigger. This guy is bloodthirsty and has no qualms about killing people who disagree with him.The impossible stunts, the over-the-top action and the crazy situations the Hornet and Kato get into is just as goofy a comic book-like movie as you can see. There's even panel shots!If you liked other similar films such as Rush Hour or even Lethal Weapon.End Credits Worth the Price!The ending credits play the original Green Hornet theme as composed by Billy May back in the 1930s, and we even listen to the singing of Jay Chau (Kato). Recommended for older teens and adults due to the over-the-top death by car and the gross methods of accidental and purposeful death!Fun film! A nod to Bruce Lee and coffee baristas everywhere, LOL!Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") directing from a screenplay by star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg based on the radio series created by George W.

Even with Kato as his sidekick, The Hornet is rarely mentioned in the same breath as Superman, Spiderman, Wolverine or Iron Man.

Today's Green Hornet is a klutz who finds his way with the help of his new best pal and his gorgeous secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz) who unknowingly is the brains behind the partnership. Once the boys start cleaning up Los Angeles streets while posing as criminals, Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) wants them eliminated because he's involved in all of LA's dirt.

No way.  Even a parody should have a plot and dialog that holds up.  The dialog and the characters just do not match.

Smith,"[2, 6]","I watched the original show when I was younger, but I grew up way after the show was made so I didn't grow up watching it on Saturday mornings or anything. And I basically only watched it because Bruce Lee was in it. That being said, I enjoyed this movie immensely. I knew going in that it was going to put an emphasis on comedy, which some reviewers here seem to have been surprised by. It was written by and stars Seth Rogan. What were you expecting? And it's not as if the comedy is out of place in the context of the movie. It's perfectly suited for the movie since a lot of it is physical comedy(not campy style though). And the dialogue is pretty witty and just as hilarious as the physical comedy. Some lines genuinely had me cracking up.But let's say you're not interested in the comedy. OK, the action is awesome as well. The fight scenes are all pretty original and very cool. And the Black Beauty is amazing. They did so much cool stuff with that car.How about the story? It's extremely solid, better than most action-comedies. It centers around organized crime and corruption and does so in a pretty interesting way. Sure, you see the ""bad guy"" twist coming from a mile away and it meanders a bit in the second half before the climax but it's still a solid and entertaining plot.And if you did watch the original show then you should appreciate the little nods the movie gives, like Kato making a comment about being too fast to be captured on film on television. This of course being a reference to Bruce Lee's movements being too fast for the camera film of the time of the original show, which meant he had to slow down his punches for the show. And references like that are sprinkled throughout the film.All in all it's a really fun, really entertaining movie that does exactly what it set out to do.

1311997,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B002ZG99B8,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","In ""The Green Hornet,"" Britt Reid (Seth Rogen), the son of metropolitan newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), spends his days carousing, throwing wild parties, drinking to excess, and passing out, much to the chagrin of his father.  When his father unexpectedly dies, Britt is thrust into his father's job -- a job he's unqualified for and doesn't take seriously.To strike back at a father who may have been the toast of the city but was a cold, distant dad, Britt enlists the assistance of his father's automobile mechanic, Kato (Jay Chou), in some local vandalism.  Security cameras pick up their grainy images but the newspaper staff assumes the perpetrators are members of a gang.  Britt orders his staff to write about the unidentified culprit and give him a snappy name that will sell papers.  They call him ""The Green Hornet.""Up until this point, the film isn't bad, and it promises some interesting dramatic moments balanced with action.  But director Michel Gondry goes the route of camp in gagging up every situation that follows, with Rogen's mugging and terrible acting undermining any attempt at a decent picture.Rogen is a limited actor who has become identified with man-boy social-misfit roles.  In that capacity he's fine and has developed a fan base.  But he is clearly not action hero material.  He goes through the motions, recites the lines, and tries to look determined, but we never once believe his character as a serious threat to the bad guys.  His Green Hornet is a human cartoon doing everything but running off a cliff and remaining suspended in midair as he looks helplessly toward the camera.Chou's Kato comes off as interesting, but he can't sell the comedic side of his role.  It appears he has all he can handle to deliver his dialogue in English.  There's no irony, no timing, and no sense of humor in lines meant to elicit chuckles.  In the action department, Chou is more effective showing off Kato's lightning-fast karate moves and proficiency at building amazing gadgets and equipping cars with gimmicky weaponry.Satisfying the unwritten rule of action movies that in stature the bad guy must equal or even surpass that of the hero, Christoph Waltz plays Chudnofsky, the deadly crime king of the city.  In an opening scene that borrows the menace of Waltz's Nazi officer from ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Chudnofsky shows that despite his mild-mannered appearance and soft-spoken voice, he is a formidable villain.  Equipped with a dual-barreled pistol, he is adept at knocking off upstart criminals, including James Franco in an unbilled cameo role, who threaten to muscle in on his turf.Cameron Diaz plays a secretary hired by Britt shortly after he takes over at the newspaper.  Modeled on girl-Friday Pepper Potts in the ""Iron Man"" films, Diaz' Lenore Case has little to do that is significant to the plot and is present primarily for attractive window dressing in this testosterone-driven flick.There are some good action sequences in ""The Green Hornet,"" including one involving several cement mixers, excitingly staged car chases, and an improbable scene in which a severed car continues its rampage through an office building.Humor is a tricky element in an action picture.  It has to be incorporated in measured doses to be effective.

1312000,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG99B8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[13, 20]","I've said it before, I'll say it again. January is a wasteland at the multiplex. The studios are too busy concentrating on award buzz for the films released in December. Some of these films receiving buzz may get a wider release in January, to capitalize on the nominations, leading to more box office, keeping the film current and viable until the big daddy of award shows, the Oscars. They simply don't have time to adequately promote a new wide release. For that reason, January (and early September) is a dumping ground; any film getting a wide release is a film the studio has zero confidence in. These films have been ""delayed"" a few times, or you might see a notice in the newspaper indicating the ""studio declined to screen the film in time for a review"". These are bad signs but generally good indicators you need to stay clear.For this reason, we have ""Season of the Witch"", ""The Dilemma"" and ""The Green Hornet"" hitting screens in our neighborhood.By late January, the fervor has cleared and they begin to release new films they have time to get behind, new films they expect to see generate revenue. It is generally safer to go back to the multiplex. ""The Green Hornet"", the new superhero adaptation starring Seth Rogen, Jay Chou and Cameron Diaz is being released in the middle of January. It presents a conundrum.Columbia Pictures must be trying to fill a void with a brilliant counter-programming move. Well, yes and no. There are a lot of reasons to think ""Hornet"" might be the exception to the rule. And it is better than most of the films released in January. But it is still not very good. And paying extra to see the film in 3-D sort of rubs salt into the wounds, making an OK film even worse. Don't even think of seeing this film in IMAX 3-D. It is not worth it.The first reason you might suspect the film will be OK? It seems to have been a passion project for Seth Rogen. He has been everywhere, promoting the film, he has talked about it while promoting other films, he lost a lot of weight to play the role, and he even wrote the script with his longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg. All of this points to a famous comedy star trying to break out of the confines of the genre and work in a new and exciting area. I am sure he saw Robert Downey Jr.'s current rise to uber-stardom as ""Iron Man"" and wanted to give it a try.Rogen clearly wants people to enjoy this passion project as much as he does. But there are certain things we expect from a superhero movie. You want a believable back-story leading to the hero's creation or emergence. You want great action scenes mixed with a little humor (maybe) to keep things moving. You want a believable, scary villain. The major problem with ""The Green Hornet"" is the mix of action and humor is completely, horribly off balance. Much of the film involves Britt Reid (Rogen) having discussions with Kato (Jay Chou), Lenore Case (Diaz) and Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz, ""Inglourious Basterds"") in which Reid takes on the laid-back persona Rogen has perfected and has a riff with his co-stars about something, anything. These moments almost seem ad-libbed and pointless. In fact, in many instances, the person Reid is having a conversation with doesn't seem to get or be in on the joke. This creates an odd disconnect; Rogen seems like he is trying to be funny, what he says seems like it should be funny, it would be funny in ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad"", but he is more often than not delivering these lines to a brick wall.Rogen is smart enough to realize he isn't going to be able to pull of the lion's share of the action. So they found Jay Chou, a Taiwanese actor, to play Kato. His action scenes are good. But every time he delivers a line of dialogue, it is almost painful to watch and listen to. I highly suspect he had a dialogue coach standing off screen feeding him the lines phonetically. What this doesn't do is help him understand the meanings of the lines. His performance is a bit like watching Robert DeNiro, Michael Phelps or January Jones host ""Saturday Night Live"". During every live segment, they read their lines from a teleprompter unable to infuse the dialogue with any meaning. They are all clearly out of their element and their comfort zone.The scenes between Rogen and Diaz are just confusing and painful to witness. Reid, a former playboy, openly ogles Diaz's Lenore Case, his new assistant. Every time they talk, Rogen begins the conversation with an awkward come on she ignores. This banter goes on for a few minutes before they get to the reason for the conversation. This happens every time they talk and it is never remotely funny. Even worse, there are similar scenes between Kato and Lenore, which are also painful, but for other reasons. Really, the dialogue seems like it was written by a twelve-year-old fan-boy for other twelve-year-olds. I half expected Rogen's character to say ""ass"" and then start giggling madly.Rogen realizes the villain needs to be scary and menacing. The writers address this in their typical way; the villain discusses the issue himself with others who question his effectiveness. This is actually an amusing idea and the funniest running gag in the film. When we first meet Chudnofsky (Waltz) he barges into the nightclub of a rival who criticizes his lack of scariness. But there are many examples throughout the film illustrating this Chudnofsky's ruthlessness. Yet, the villain still has a complex about it. The role is a balancing act. On the one hand, Waltz has to reveal the character's self-doubt, playing the part a tad seriously for us to get the joke. But he also has to be tongue-in-cheek throughout. Waltz achieves this balance and is the best thing in the film.For all of the exposition, all of the discussions in the film, there are quite a few things left unanswered, or not given enough attention or explanation. The most important of these would have to be why the Green Hornet feels he has to fight crime while portraying a criminal. They go so far as to make it look like the Green Hornet shoots Reid. There are a few scenes in which Reid talks with someone about a new aspect of his mission as the Green Hornet. They discuss a few options and then Reid latches on to one, smiles broadly and shouts, ""That's it. Good job my friend"". Rogen smiles goofily and they are off. It seems as though Rogen expects us to take his overt enthusiasm as reason enough for this idea or theory to exist. If these moments existed with other scenes depicting a better realization, they would work. Rogen's fan-boy enthusiasm is not enough. These moments seem intended to illustrate the Green Hornet's creation, but in reality they simply amount to a series of exclamations.One of the primary reasons I thought ""Hornet"" might be a surprise is the director, Michel Gondry. Best known for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", Gondry is a strange choice to helm a super hero film. I was hoping the combination would be more strange-good and less strange-Ang Lee-""Incredible Hulk"". His work is actually a little of both. There are a few strange, odd touches in the film. When Kato and Reid are fighting some street thugs, Kato kicks one and he goes flying over the trunk of a car. The trunk seems to multiply and extend almost as though Gondry is trying to give the impression of 3-D in a 2-D film. It is a fun, interesting sort of retro idea.Gondry wants to present a more realistic vision. At times, dust floats through the air highlighted by a ray of sunshine, at others, the sun causes light flares as the camera passes. Both of these touches make the film seem more real and personal, but they also obscure the 3-D elements in the film. If the 3-D added depth to the film, it wouldn't matter that the new process doesn't enhance the action. But it doesn't, so you kind of want, and expect the 3-D to help the action pop. But because Gondry seems to relish using corny, older techniques to give the illusion of 3-D, these moments lose any power they may have had.""The Green Hornet"" is a disappointment and further proof you should stay away from any studio film receiving a wide release in early January.",2,"This ""Hornet"" Doesn't Sting....",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,8139,"[""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say',

1312005,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG99B8,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 13]","The 2011 ""Green Hornet"" film opens with an arch-villain Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) gently asking (= threatening) a club owner and drug dealer ""Crystal Cleer"" (uncredited James Franco) to hand over the business to him. It is fun as the two actors know what they are doing, delivering delightfully scenery-chewing performances. To me the opening is the best part of the film. And the Green Hornet is not in it.Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote and co-executive produced the film) is Britt Reid / The Green Hornet. He first appears as a 28-year-old slacker of a Los Angels newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). Unlike most superhero films (or any films for that matter), they are not very likable persons. James is an arrogant and domineering father. Britt is just a spoiled son with no redeeming grace whatever.But you expect something happen to Brit, like character development. Not much. Seth Rogen remains unconvincing as the protagonist (was he?) throughout ""The Green Hornet."" He talks too much, but does little. What does he want to be, a crime-fighting hero or a self-conscious parody of the genre? Or just an annoyingly goofy playboy?Jay Chou fares slightly better as Kato. After all his character (once played by legendary Bruce Lee) can do something, like doing martial arts and making good coffee. Cameron Diaz appears as Lenore, newly-hired secretary and love interest, a thankless role made for the film's unnecessary romantic subplot. As to the actions, well, the action sequences are not great, not knowing when to stop. They lack rhythm and style. They break things a lot and that's all.Finally the film is directed by Michel Gondry. Those who expected (like me) a happy marriage of action/superhero genre and his imagination of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" will be disappointed. Like his previous feature film ""Be Kind Rewind"" something is not right about the film, as if he is not really allowed to show what he can do.",2,Disappointing Michel Gondry Action Film,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,1954,"['2011', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'film', 'arch-villain', 'Chudnofsky', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'gently', 'asking', '=', 'threatening', 'club', 'owner', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Crystal', 'Cleer', 'uncredited', 'James', 'Franco', 'hand', 'business', 'fun', 'two', 'actors', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'delivering', 'delightfully', 'scenery-chewing', 'performances', 'opening', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'not', 'it.Seth', 'Rogen', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'co-executive', 'produced', 'film', 'Britt', 'Reid', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'first', '28-year-old', 'slacker', 'Los', 'Angels', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'James', 'Reid', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'most', 'superhero', 'films', 'films', 'matter', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'persons', 'James', 'arrogant', 'domineering', 'father', 'Britt', 'just', 'spoiled', 'son', 'redeeming', 'grace', 'whatever.But', 'expect', 'something', 'happen', 'Brit', 'character', 'development', 'Not', 'much', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'unconvincing', 'protagonist', 'was', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'What', 'want', 'be', 'crime-fighting', 'hero', 'self-conscious', 'parody', 'genre', 'just', 'annoyingly', 'goofy', 'playboy', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'slightly', 'better', 'Kato', 'character', 'once', 'played', 'legendary', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'doing', 'martial', 'arts', 'making', 'good', 'coffee', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Lenore', 'newly-hired', 'secretary', 'love', 'interest', 'thankless', 'role', 'made', 'film', 'unnecessary', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'actions', 'well', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', 'stop', 'lack', 'rhythm', 'style', 'break', 'things', 'lot', 'all.Finally', 'film', 'directed', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'who', 'expected', 'happy', 'marriage', 'action/superhero', 'genre', 'imagination', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'previous', 'feature', 'film', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'allowed', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do']",N/A
1312006,A29HPI08Z5SYYX,B002ZG99B8,Tyler Foster,"[4, 11]","First things first: if you're a devoted, faithful fan of the George W. Trendle's vigilante hero The Green Hornet, or any of the subsequent adaptations since then, perhaps you should stay away from this update, which would rather poke fun at the increasingly overcrowded superhero genre. Co-writer/co-producer/star Seth Rogen stays firmly within his usual wheelhouse, despite having dropped a good deal of weight for the role, throwing more one-liners than kicks and punches. His Hornet/Britt Reid is a self-centered rich boy motivated to do some good by the death of his ""tough-love"" father and an excess of wealth and time. The joke, as it were (ala Big Trouble in Little China) is that Kato is the real hero, doing everything from putting together the Black Beauty to taking out all of the pair's opponents).Secondly, it helps to know that the film was directed by French auteur Michel Gondry, the man responsible for hundreds of innovative music videos (most famously, the LEGO-animated ""Fell in Love With a Girl"" by the White Stripes) and the popular, artful films Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep. On one hand, it might seem odd that Gondry would choose to direct a studio action movie, but look a little closer, and there's an intriguing parallel between the pairing of Rogen and Gondry and the pairing of Britt and Kato. Not that I have anything against Rogen (I'd wager if he heard this theory, he'd just laugh it off), but it's funny to imagine Gondry as Kato, the oddball inventor who puts record players in car seats and sees in ""Kato-Vision"", which allows him to single out points of danger and eliminate them one by one, while substituting Britt's desire to play ""Green Hornet"" with Rogen's desire to make The Green Hornet with himself as the lead character.Beyond that, the film is a bit uneven. Although the idea of a neurotic, self-conscious mobster is very funny, there needs to be more meat on the scenes with Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). The only one that registers as much as it should is the first, in which Chudnofsky threatens a younger gangster (""My gun has two barrels; that's not boring.""). Cameron Diaz is wasted in a thankless role that could've been fixed with a little re-arranging of responsibilities during the second and third acts. Britt, finally, may be a little TOO grating; although it's all part of the joke, Rogen might've wanted to pull him back a touch. That said, there's still enough solid comedy to float the average viewer's boat, and fans of Gondry will see his fingerprints everywhere (the aforementioned two-barreled gun, the execution of ""Kato-Vision"" (and any other fight scenes with Chou), and pretty much everything during the big third-act finale, from glass elevators to half-cars to a sea of paper rolls in a printing press. Plus, it's nice to see a superhero that isn't so dark; eat your heart out, Chris Nolan, but sometimes some pure, unbridled fun is appreciated.",4,"Shaky superheroism, solid meta-comedy.",1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2953,"['First', 'things', 'first', ""'re"", 'devoted', 'faithful', 'fan', 'George', 'W.', 'Trendle', 'vigilante', 'hero', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'subsequent', 'adaptations', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'update', 'would', 'rather', 'poke', 'fun', 'increasingly', 'overcrowded', 'superhero', 'genre', 'Co-writer/co-producer/star', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'firmly', 'usual', 'wheelhouse', 'having', 'dropped', 'good', 'deal', 'weight', 'role', 'throwing', 'more', 'one-liners', 'kicks', 'punches', 'Hornet/Britt', 'Reid', 'self-centered', 'rich', 'boy', 'motivated', 'do', 'good', 'death', 'tough-love', 'father', 'excess', 'wealth', 'time', 'joke', 'were', 'ala', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'Kato', 'real', 'hero', 'doing', 'everything', 'putting', 'together', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'taking', 'out', 'pair', 'opponents', '.Secondly', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'French', 'auteur', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'man', 'responsible', 'hundreds', 'innovative', 'music', 'videos', 'most', 'famously', 'LEGO-animated', 'Fell', 'Love', 'Girl', 'White', 'Stripes', 'popular', 'artful', 'films', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'one', 'hand', 'might', 'seem', 'odd', 'Gondry', 'would', 'choose', 'direct', 'studio', 'action', 'movie', 'look', 'little', 'closer', 'intriguing', 'parallel', 'pairing', 'Rogen', 'Gondry', 'pairing', 'Britt', 'Kato', 'Not', 'have', 'anything', 'Rogen', ""'d"", 'wager', 'heard', 'theory', ""'d"", 'just', 'laugh', 'off', 'funny', 'imagine', 'Gondry', 'Kato', 'oddball', 'inventor', 'who', 'record', 'players', 'car', 'seats', 'sees', 'Kato-Vision', 'single', 'out', 'points', 'danger', 'eliminate', 'one', 'one', 'substituting', 'Britt', 'desire', 'play', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'Rogen', 'desire', 'make', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'lead', 'character.Beyond', 'film', 'bit', 'uneven', 'idea', 'neurotic', 'self-conscious', 'mobster', 'very', 'funny', 'be', 'more', 'meat', 'scenes', 'Chudnofsky', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'only', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'first', 'Chudnofsky', 'younger', 'gangster', 'gun', 'two', 'barrels', 'not', 'boring.', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'wasted', 'thankless', 'role', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fixed', 'little', 're-arranging', 'responsibilities', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'Britt', 'finally', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'TOO', 'grating', 'part', 'joke', 'Rogen', 'might', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'pull', 'back', 'touch', 'said', 'still', 'enough', 'solid', 'comedy', 'float', 'average', 'viewer', 'boat', 'fans', 'Gondry', 'will', 'see', 'fingerprints', 'everywhere', 'aforementioned', 'two-barreled', 'gun', 'execution', 'Kato-Vision', 'other', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Chou', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'big', 'third-act', 'finale', 'glass', 'elevators', 'half-cars', 'sea', 'paper', 'rolls', 'printing', 'press', 'nice', 'see', 'superhero', ""n't"", 'so', 'dark', 'eat', 'heart', 'out', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'sometimes', 'pure', 'unbridled', 'fun', 'appreciated']",N/A

It was a bad sign that, five minutes into the film I was already getting a really bad feeling about what I was seeing and was wondering if it was too late to slip out and catch some other movie instead. Having sat through the entire god-awful mess, I can tell you know that if you've seen the trailer for the film, then you've already seen 90 percent of everything worth seeing in the entire movie. If you have not seen the movie yet, then you can still spare yourself the experience of enduring a complete waste of your time.It's almost a toss-up as to what the biggest single problem was: Seth Rogen or the script. Seth Rogen, who can be hysterically funny, is lost here, as if he wandered onto the wrong movie set by mistake. At no point even remotely believable as an action hero, he mugs his way through the film like he's improvising a sequel to Pineapple Express, completely trashing the Brit Reid / Green Hornet character. As for the rest of the cast, even the best actors cannot overcome bad characterizations and criminally lame dialogue. Christoph Waltz, the truly charming and chilling villain Col. Landa in Inglourious Basterds, in this film is reduced to being Chudnofsky, about the lamest crime lord the film world has ever seen:Chudnofsky: ""You said I'm boring.  My gun has 2 barrels - that's not boring and it was very difficult to make.""Tupper:  ""Look, trust me, a grown man wearing a mask is a little scarier than a guy wearing a suit.""Chudnofsky: ""You're not pleased with my suit? Does it fail to fill you with fear?""Tupper:  ""Sorry, I didn't mean to disrespect.""Chudnofsky: ""Do you have any idea how many great people have killed in a suit?""Chudnofsky: ""I was gonna have people call me 'Bloodnofsky'. I was gonna wear red for blood, get it? That's scary _and_ cool.""Edward James Olmos, as the newspaper's top editor, spends most of his time scowling and looking like all he wants to do is get paid so he can get off the set and out of this mess. Tom Wilkinson as Brit Reid's publisher father is probably the luckiest actor in the film as he gets to die about 10 minutes into the movie.  Cameron Diaz is there presumably as the love interest, which seems strange after the fact as the script has her rejecting and then beating up on both Rogen and Chou. To make matters worse, there is zero chemistry between her and Rogen or Chou, a lack that is made even starker by the fact that Diaz is ten years older than Rogen and seven years older than Chou.This didn't have to happen. This could have been either a really funny comedy or a great straight pulp-hero action film, but it feels as if no one involved could ever make up their mind and so it ends up being neither. There are a few funny bits (almost all of which are in the trailer) but most of the film just isn't funny. The jokes suffer from being lame and from atrociously bad timing.  Everyone's timing feels off, even in the parts that are supposed to be just straight acting. It's like watching the cast doing a walk-through for the first time.  Everything feels disjointed, disconnected. Adding to the stiffness are huge lumps of exposition where characters relate either what they've done or what they're going to do, and other scenes where it seems like no one could figure out what they were supposed to do so they just improvised.The only halfway decent thing about Green Hornet is Jay Chou as an updated and hyper-competent Kato, but even his character is crippled by inanities. Like the fact that he's supposed to be a super-tough martial arts street-fighter... but he keeps going down after getting kicked in the balls. Or pushed into a swimming pool where it's revealed he can't swim. Or having to engage in a ridiculously long fight with Rogen whose sorry butt he apparently cannot manage to successfully kick, in spite of his previously having taken out entire groups of armed thugs without breaking a sweat.Among the many things in The Green Hornet that obviously weren't thought through is that there was apparently no thought given to updating the Green Hornet's car, Black Beauty, to something that fits the 00's or the 10's.  Instead, they're driving around in this relic that looks like it was found on an auto lot that shut down back in the 60's.  And to add to the absurdity, there's a turntable in it.  Not an Ipod or a CD player or even a tape deck; it's a _turntable_. Playing an LP.  While the car is on the road. Without skipping.About the only reason I could recommend this film to anyone is if you're a Jay Chou fan and want to hear him sing (in Mandarin) during the ending credits.  Other than that, if you're old enough to actually remember the original Green Hornet from radio or television, avoid this film like the plague; you're not only in for a disappointment, you're in for watching a classic character utterly trashed. If you're completely unfamilliar with the original Green Hornet, then just avoid this film to save yourself from wasting two hours and the cost of a DVD.  And if for some reason someone gives you the DVD, then just use it as a coaster while you watch a decent movie instead.",1,Mind-bogglingly lame waste of time and talent,1295913600,"01 25,

I am not going to go into great detail about the aesthetics and characteristics of the movie as movies go or as more experienced movie reviewers would. I watched the TV series Green Hornet when I was a kid - before I had any clue who Bruce Lee was about to become! And I loved that show. But comparing this one to that is absolutely not fair to this movie (nor to the old TV series for that matter).I think the movie could have been made one of three ways, 1. In the spirit of the old TV series, 2. In a dark and serious manner (wasn't that just done? why so serious?), 3. In an action packed yet hilarious way!.Well gee, which one do you think this is? Heck yeah! And in that vein, it was awesome! I laughed hard, and I was entertained immensely by crazy action, wild martial arts and special effects, whacky gadgets and tricked out cars that made any previous movies with tricked out cars seem weak by comparison!When I saw the earliest of trailers for The Green Hornet, I was like, ""What? a comedy... starring this guy?"". I thought it would either be a complete dud or really funny and great. The more trailers I saw as the movie neared release, the more I could tell it would be funny and great. So by the time I saw it (first watched as a Blu-ray rental), I even had my hopes up already with plenty of hype - and you know that can never be good.
