He brings them & their hard work, to life.  This is part of the artist series I use in the classroom, and it is wonderful.  My students and I know and appreciate more about Degas now, than ever before.",5,Degas: the Artist of the Dancers,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,353,"['Tho', 'Degas', 'did', 'paint', 'other', 'subjects', 'horses', 'portraits', 'other', 'artist', 'friends', 'film', 'how', 'why', 'lovely', 'young', 'ballet', 'girls', 'hard', 'work', 'life', 'part', 'artist', 'series', 'use', 'classroom', 'wonderful', 'students', 'know', 'appreciate', 'more', 'Degas', 'now', 'ever']",N/A

What made my daughter (12 at the time of this review) sit down was the piano that accompanies the DVD screen menu. It probably sounded to her similar to what they use at some of her ballet classes. She loved the entire movie. Even I enjoyed this presentation so much, we watched it again a few days later. The actors are easy to follow and familiarize with. The characters are funny and tragic. The ballerinas look pretty and professional. I didn't know Alison Pill (Marie) had done classic ballet, she was very graceful at that age of 12 or 13, when the movie was made.I haven't seen the other films from this series, but by reading their descriptions, and after seeing it, I can see DEGAS AND THE DANCER is one that has no fictitious characters. Parts of the story may not be true, but this movie connects the characters in a manner so that kids will be entertained and taught. And may even encourage them to find out more details, such as why Degas had eye pain.I only wish it had been filmed at the actual Opera House or shown some ""pretend"" shot of the famous building (but that's where DEGAS AND THE DANCE comes in). I am sure any kid watching this movie can learn one or two things about history, ballet, painting techniques, and must important, life and fighting for what you want. Get this DVD while it is still available. Get the other one too!",5,Recommended for kids and adults,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,1440,"['seeing', 'DEGAS', 'THE', 'DANCE', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'DEGAS', 'THE', 'DANCER', 'was', 'What', 'made', 'daughter', '12', 'time', 'review', 'sit', 'down', 'was', 'piano', 'DVD', 'screen', 'menu', 'probably', 'sounded', 'similar', 'what', 'use', 'ballet', 'classes', 'loved', 'entire', 'movie', 'Even', 'enjoyed', 'presentation', 'so', 'much', 'watched', 'again', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'actors', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'familiarize', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'tragic', 'ballerinas', 'look', 'pretty', 'professional', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'Marie', 'had', 'done', 'classic', 'ballet', 'was', 'very', 'graceful', 'age', '12', '13', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'series', 'reading', 'descriptions', 'seeing', 'can', 'see', 'DEGAS', 'THE', 'DANCER', 'one', 'fictitious', 'characters', 'Parts', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'movie', 'characters', 'manner', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'taught', 'may', 'even', 'encourage', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'details', 'such', 'why', 'Degas', 'had', 'eye', 'pain.I', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'actual', 'Opera', 'House', 'shown', 'pretend', 'shot', 'famous', 'building', 'where', 'DEGAS', 'THE', 'DANCE', 'am', 'sure', 'kid', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'learn', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'history', 'ballet', 'painting', 'techniques', 'must', 'important', 'life', 'fighting', 'what', 'want', 'Get', 'DVD', 'still', 'available', 'Get', 'other', 'one', 'too']",N/A

It is a simple tale of a girl from a poor family, an artist, and big sister with big ambition but little heart.  From this video, kids can learn more about Degas the painter, Impressionism, ballet dancing and French society at the time.  I bought it to go with a Little Dancer statue I bought when the Little Dancer was shown in my area.  I also use books about France, painting and ballet to teach my unit.  Kids who are interested in Impressionism, Degas and ballet will love this DVD.

Levy ""kids_first""","[4, 4]","This story is beautifully produced by the Canadian film company, Devine Entertainment, known for their commitment to excellent entertainment for older children. This biography shows Degas as  a self-centered old man whose art is more important to him than people. A young ballerina, Marie, has a major influence on changing his attitudes and behavior. It begs the question, &quot;Does being a genius give you license to treat others badly?&quot; Our child viewers commented: &quot;I learned about what it takes to be an artist.&quot; &quot;I liked the way they all taught each other something. The painter taught her that if you don't make a mistake you'll never learn. She taught him not to be so grouchy and have respect for others.&quot; Most 8 to 12-year-olds will enjoy this, particularly girls, and girls interested in dance will dance with joy!",5,Does being a genius give you license to treat others badly?,1000252800,"09 12, 2001",2001,851,"['story', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'Canadian', 'film', 'company', 'Devine', 'Entertainment', 'known', 'commitment', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'older', 'children', 'biography', 'Degas', 'self-centered', 'old', 'man', 'art', 'more', 'important', 'people', 'young', 'ballerina', 'Marie', 'major', 'influence', 'changing', 'attitudes', 'behavior', 'question', 'quot', 'Does', 'being', 'genius', 'give', 'license', 'treat', 'others', 'badly', 'quot', 'child', 'viewers', 'commented', 'quot', 'learned', 'what', 'be', 'artist.', 'quot', 'quot', 'liked', 'way', 'taught', 'other', 'something', 'painter', 'taught', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', ""'ll"", 'never', 'learn', 'taught', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'grouchy', 'have', 'respect', 'others.', 'quot', 'Most', '8', '12-year-olds', 'will', 'enjoy', 'particularly', 'girls', 'girls', 'interested', 'dance', 'will', 'dance', 'joy']",N/A
