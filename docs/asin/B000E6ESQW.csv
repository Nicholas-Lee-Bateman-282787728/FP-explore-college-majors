It was way too personal for Hockney (and too explicitly homosexual for the average heterosexual preference). He thought it was going to have a lot about his paintings and him talking about art. Instead it follows his failing relationship with his lover, Peter, who was a major inspiration of his paintings at that time.15% of this film is about art. There's about 8 minutes collectively of Hockney in his studio and painting. One minute of him talking about what's on his mind with art. Six or so, 20 second scenes where they re-create some of his great paintings at that time; and a few scenes where he's being hounded about his production and selling his art. And what's most interesting to me is he was in the middle of painting ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)""- so you see a little of the process of how that painting came about.Take away that 15%, what's left is a homosexual film that's poorly edited.",1,Who Was This Movie Made For?,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,960,"['David', 'Hockney', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'personal', 'Hockney', 'too', 'explicitly', 'homosexual', 'average', 'heterosexual', 'preference', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'lot', 'paintings', 'talking', 'art', 'Instead', 'failing', 'relationship', 'lover', 'Peter', 'who', 'was', 'major', 'inspiration', 'paintings', 'time.15', '%', 'film', 'art', '8', 'minutes', 'collectively', 'Hockney', 'studio', 'painting', 'One', 'minute', 'talking', 'what', 'mind', 'art', 'Six', 'so', '20', 'second', 'scenes', 'where', 're-create', 'great', 'paintings', 'time', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'being', 'hounded', 'production', 'selling', 'art', 'what', 'most', 'interesting', 'was', 'middle', 'painting', 'Portrait', 'Artist', 'Pool', 'Two', 'Figures', 'see', 'little', 'process', 'how', 'painting', 'came', 'about.Take', 'away', '15', '%', 'what', 'left', 'homosexual', 'film', 'poorly', 'edited']",N/A

969838,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E6ESQW,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","Jack Hazan's quasi-documentary A BIGGER SPLASH is an unfocused examination about the creative life of David Hockney and supposedly about the effect of his past relationship with his pupil Peter Schlesinger (an artist, sculptor, and photographer who Hockney not only enjoyed as a lover but as a disciple). The pr&eacute;cis appears to be that Hockney, in the throes of disappointment about the dissolution of his affair with Peter, decides to move to California where he has already been established as a painter of California people and places.In London we meet his friends - Celia Birtwell, the elegantly stylishly beautiful model Hockney used repeatedly, dress designer Ossie Clark, confidant Mo McDermott, and patron Henry Geldzahler - each of whom Hockney painted and drew. We watch as Hockney visits the galleries and admires works of his friends, how he paints in his studio, how he relates to his gallerists (like Paul Kasmin), and how he perceives men and other artists.Peter Schlesinger figures prominently in the film with many episodes of Peter's swimming in the pools of the people Hockney would eventually immortalize. He is a fine presence and carries his silent role well - almost appearing as a ghost muse that keeps Hockney focused on his now infamous swimming pool paintings.The magic of this film, for those to whom Hockney is a well known and important painter, is the visual recreation of the paintings that have made him so famous: we are allowed to see Celia and her husband with white cat in context with the canvas, the view of Peter staring into the pool at an under water swimmer, the woman and her animal heads who appears in another of Hockney's famous paintings at poolside, etc. This kind of cinematic background is valuable now and will prove invaluable to the archives of David Hockney. For those people this is a must-see film, despite its meandering technique and choppy editing. For others, it may seem too self-indulgent.

969839,A9I40WFF40R4,B000E6ESQW,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[6, 6]","Jack Hazan followed the artist David Hockney around from 1971 to 1973 filming this quasi-documentary about him. A very young and slim Mr. Hockney-- he would have been 34 I believe in 1971-- comes across as witty and interesting. Some parts of this 90 minute film are quite wonderful, particularly  where the artist talks about his art or when we actually see him painting. There are also fascinating scenes where the subjects of his paintings actually merge into their life-sized portraits as life imitates art. The footage of the swimming pools looks like the paintings that figure prominently in the movie, particularly ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)."" There is much made of the bright blue color that Mr. Hockey seems to be so fond of, complementing his work as well. Images are often repeated, giving the film a pleasing symmetry.Not everything works so well, however. The director would have us believe that Mr. Hockney is having difficulty completing a painting because he has just broken up with its subject and his lover, Peter Schlesinger. The artist, who according to the accompanying notes to the DVD, was upset when he saw the finished documentary, indicated that the breakup was not a factor in his slow work on the painting. Also often the people just engage in dull conversation about not much in particular. Some of the dialogue could have been cut without hurting the finished film at all. Much is made about whether Mr. Hockey will return to California or to New York, et cetera, et cetera. One person repeats two or three times that ""when a love goes wrong, there are more than two people who suffer."" Okay. Then there is a rather explicit sex scene between two men that does not add much to the overall excellence of the movie.This film will appeal most to hardcore fans, particularly the footage that gives a glimpse into Hockney's creative process. I came away from the movie agreeing with the extremely private novelist Eudora Welty, who believed passionately that one should concentrate on the work of the artist, rather than so much the details of his or her life.",4,The Splash Could Have Been Bigger,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,2105,"['Jack', 'Hazan', 'followed', 'artist', 'David', 'Hockney', '1971', '1973', 'filming', 'quasi-documentary', 'very', 'young', 'slim', 'Mr.', 'Hockney', 'would', 'have', 'been', '34', 'believe', '1971', 'witty', 'interesting', 'parts', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'particularly', 'where', 'artist', 'talks', 'art', 'when', 'actually', 'see', 'painting', 'are', 'also', 'fascinating', 'scenes', 'where', 'subjects', 'paintings', 'actually', 'merge', 'life-sized', 'portraits', 'life', 'imitates', 'art', 'footage', 'swimming', 'paintings', 'figure', 'prominently', 'movie', 'particularly', 'Portrait', 'Artist', 'Pool', 'Two', 'Figures', 'much', 'made', 'bright', 'blue', 'color', 'Mr.', 'Hockey', 'be', 'so', 'fond', 'complementing', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Images', 'are', 'often', 'repeated', 'giving', 'film', 'pleasing', 'symmetry.Not', 'everything', 'so', 'well', 'however', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Mr.', 'Hockney', 'having', 'difficulty', 'completing', 'painting', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'subject', 'lover', 'Peter', 'Schlesinger', 'artist', 'who', 'according', 'accompanying', 'notes', 'DVD', 'was', 'upset', 'when', 'saw', 'finished', 'documentary', 'indicated', 'breakup', 'was', 'not', 'factor', 'slow', 'work', 'painting', 'Also', 'often', 'people', 'just', 'engage', 'dull', 'conversation', 'not', 'much', 'particular', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'hurting', 'finished', 'film', 'Much', 'made', 'Mr.', 'Hockey', 'will', 'return', 'California', 'New', 'York', 'et', 'cetera', 'cetera', 'One', 'person', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'when', 'love', 'wrong', 'are', 'more', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'Okay', 'Then', 'rather', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scene', 'two', 'men', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'excellence', 'movie.This', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'most', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'particularly', 'footage', 'glimpse', 'Hockney', 'creative', 'process', 'came', 'away', 'movie', 'agreeing', 'extremely', 'private', 'novelist', 'Eudora', 'Welty', 'who', 'believed', 'passionately', 'one', 'should', 'concentrate', 'work', 'artist', 'rather', 'so', 'much', 'details', 'life']",N/A

What struck me most was how perfectly the film captured that more innocent time, the early '70s. Repeated words, happenstance Eros, throwaway conversations, knockings on the same door . . . none of these elements of the film were to me extraneous.
