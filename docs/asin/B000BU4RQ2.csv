How much interaction there was between Louis XIV, Lully and Moli&egrave;re can only be guessed. However, treated as fiction this film is a wondrous tale of  how a working-class musician (Lully) gets involved with the King of France and will do almost anything to keep in his good gracesHaving visited the Palace of Versailles myself, I was a little disappointed that the only views of the completed building are of the Galerie des Glaces as the principal performers walk into the credits at the very end of the movie.",4,"Exquisite Music, Dancing and Costumes",1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,758,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'preview', 'featured', 'DVD', 'was', 'fascinated', 'quality', 'production', 'shear', 'extravagance', 'sets', 'costumes', 'How', 'much', 'story', 'factual', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'probably', 'very', 'little', 'How', 'much', 'interaction', 'was', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'Lully', 'Moli', 'egrave', 're', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'guessed', 'However', 'treated', 'fiction', 'film', 'wondrous', 'tale', 'how', 'working-class', 'musician', 'Lully', 'involved', 'King', 'France', 'will', 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'keep', 'good', 'gracesHaving', 'visited', 'Palace', 'Versailles', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'only', 'views', 'completed', 'building', 'are', 'Galerie', 'des', 'Glaces', 'principal', 'performers', 'walk', 'credits', 'very', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

While it wouldn't hurt to know everybody's back story, it is NOT essential to appreciating this movie. Before I watched it, I had never heard of Lully or Cambert or Anne of Austria; I had heard of Moli&egrave;re and Conti but knew nothing about them except their names; but I had no trouble at all following the movie and enjoying it as much as I could with its substantial flaws.The same reviewer complained that the actors playing Moli&egrave;re, Conti and Cambert were much too old, that all three were closer to Louis' age. What bothered me more than the wrong ages of some of the supporting characters was the fabulous gorgeousness of the actors who played Louis and Lully. Please! There are good portraits of both men, and both of them were as homely as my aunt Gertrude - especially Louis.That a man who looked like a gargoyle dwarf (he was only a few inches over five feet tall), saddled at the age of four with a bankrupt, strife-torn, second-rate country, transformed himself into the Sun King and his country into a major world power, and by the force of his will completely dominated Western civilization for nearly a century - and STILL, more than 300 years later, and despite the horrific revolution that destroyed the world he created, is the single most significant person in the history of France (only Napoleon comes close, and he was a flash in the pan compared to Louis) - is a big part of what makes him so extraordinary. If he had looked like Benot Magimel, what would be the big deal? Gorgeous people automatically control the world; they don't have to DO anything. Louis is fascinating because he was NOT gorgeous, and making him gorgeous wipes out 75% of what makes him interesting.The answer to both that reviewer's and my beefs with this movie is that its makers had no intention of making an historically accurate quasi-documentary about this fascinating man and the almost equally fascinating people around him. They intended to make an overblown, potboiler soap opera based loosely on real people. They made the principals gorgeous because who cares what happens to ugly people? They made the villains grotesque and old because if they had been young we might not have known they were the villains.This is a French movie, but it might as well have been made in Hollywood. It is cheap (and I'm not talking about money) melodrama, with gorgeous, dashing heroes and old, ugly, hunched-over, troll-like villains with grotesque birthmarks on their faces. It was NOT made for experts in French history or any other persons of intelligence and discernment.It was made for an audience that neither knows nor cares how accurate it is or who the people in it are. That's how Hollywood does everything, by formula - the same formula they used in silent westerns, where you knew the good from the bad guys by the color of their hats - so audiences don't have to think, don't have to understand anything. They know by their looks which characters to cheer and which ones to boo, and that's all that matters.",2,"Overblown, potboiler soap opera",1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,3159,"['reviewer', 'was', 'mistaken', 'when', 'wrote', 'order', 'understand', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'quite', 'familiar', 'French', 'history', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'know', 'everybody', 'back', 'story', 'NOT', 'essential', 'appreciating', 'movie', 'watched', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Lully', 'Cambert', 'Anne', 'Austria', 'had', 'heard', 'Moli', 'egrave', 're', 'Conti', 'knew', 'nothing', 'except', 'names', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'substantial', 'flaws.The', 'same', 'reviewer', 'complained', 'actors', 'playing', 'Moli', 'egrave', 're', 'Conti', 'Cambert', 'were', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'three', 'were', 'closer', 'Louis', 'age', 'What', 'bothered', 'more', 'wrong', 'ages', 'supporting', 'characters', 'was', 'fabulous', 'gorgeousness', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Louis', 'Lully', 'Please', 'are', 'good', 'portraits', 'men', 'were', 'as', 'homely', 'aunt', 'Gertrude', 'especially', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'gargoyle', 'dwarf', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'inches', 'five', 'feet', 'tall', 'saddled', 'age', 'four', 'bankrupt', 'strife-torn', 'second-rate', 'country', 'transformed', 'Sun', 'King', 'country', 'major', 'world', 'power', 'force', 'will', 'completely', 'dominated', 'Western', 'civilization', 'nearly', 'century', 'STILL', 'more', '300', 'years', 'later', 'horrific', 'revolution', 'destroyed', 'world', 'created', 'single', 'most', 'significant', 'person', 'history', 'France', 'only', 'Napoleon', 'close', 'was', 'flash', 'pan', 'compared', 'Louis', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'had', 'looked', 'Benot', 'Magimel', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'Gorgeous', 'people', 'automatically', 'control', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DO', 'anything', 'Louis', 'fascinating', 'was', 'NOT', 'gorgeous', 'making', 'gorgeous', 'wipes', 'out', '75', '%', 'what', 'interesting.The', 'answer', 'reviewer', 'beefs', 'movie', 'makers', 'had', 'intention', 'making', 'historically', 'accurate', 'quasi-documentary', 'fascinating', 'man', 'almost', 'equally', 'fascinating', 'people', 'intended', 'make', 'overblown', 'potboiler', 'soap', 'opera', 'based', 'loosely', 'real', 'people', 'made', 'principals', 'gorgeous', 'who', 'what', 'ugly', 'people', 'made', 'villains', 'grotesque', 'old', 'had', 'been', 'young', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'were', 'villains.This', 'French', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'cheap', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'money', 'melodrama', 'gorgeous', 'dashing', 'heroes', 'old', 'ugly', 'hunched-over', 'troll-like', 'villains', 'grotesque', 'birthmarks', 'was', 'NOT', 'made', 'experts', 'French', 'history', 'other', 'persons', 'intelligence', 'discernment.It', 'was', 'made', 'audience', 'knows', 'how', 'accurate', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'everything', 'formula', 'same', 'formula', 'used', 'silent', 'westerns', 'where', 'knew', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'color', 'hats', 'so', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'understand', 'anything', 'know', 'looks', 'characters', 'cheer', 'ones', 'boo', 'matters']",N/A
950106,A1OUHW8VG89Q0Z,B000BU4RQ2,"Miho Hirono ""ex-musician""","[19, 21]","It is pity, many fine French films are out of order. You may get from used seller though.I have seen some paintings or drawings Louis XIV danses ballet. The Ballet scenes in this film reminded me those pictures.Most of music is by Lully, A father of French Opera, that is gourgeous. I had never listen to Lully's music before but they interest me then I bought a CD.The story is about a life of Jean-Baptist Lully with Louis XIV and Moliere,and basically followed with the fact in the history. Lully composes music for his master, Louis XIV who is a lack of power in early period. Louis danses with Lully's music. Louis takes a charge and power as a king after the death of the premier Mazarin. His idea conflicts often with his mother and Church. Louis uses power of art as the power of France. Louis orders Moliere and Lully work together and they build up comedy-ballet genre and releases some masterpieces such as ""Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme"". Louis is unpreased Lully's bisexuality and some scandals with young boys but also Louis admits Lully's outstanding music talent. Because Lully hasn't  been satisfied with working under, he is feeling, Moliere, then finally he excludes him from the court. Lully got old, injures his leg during the concert. He refuses to have his leg cut then dies. Louis didn't show up dying Lully.In this film, the story put focus on Lully's feeling love to his master which is never completed. It looks like he admires his master so deeply that his feeling becomes love. And the master, Louis XIV acted by Benoit Magimel, is detached as a king. ""I don't have any friends"" says Louis XIV.According to some history articles, Lully is a composer who gets the most from his master. And Lully is considered Louis's personal friend. So I guess their relationship was not like in the film.The most facinating aspects in the film is, I think, music, ballet scene, custume, and arts. Each cut is as beautiful as a paintings in the museum.",4,"A film of Art, as beautiful as paintings in the museum",1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1960,"['pity', 'many', 'fine', 'French', 'films', 'are', 'order', 'may', 'get', 'used', 'seller', 'though.I', 'have', 'seen', 'paintings', 'drawings', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'ballet', 'Ballet', 'scenes', 'film', 'reminded', 'pictures.Most', 'music', 'Lully', 'A', 'father', 'French', 'Opera', 'gourgeous', 'had', 'never', 'listen', 'Lully', 'music', 'interest', 'then', 'bought', 'CD.The', 'story', 'life', 'Jean-Baptist', 'Lully', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'Moliere', 'basically', 'followed', 'fact', 'history', 'Lully', 'music', 'master', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'who', 'lack', 'power', 'early', 'period', 'Louis', 'Lully', 'music', 'Louis', 'charge', 'power', 'king', 'death', 'premier', 'Mazarin', 'idea', 'conflicts', 'often', 'mother', 'Church', 'Louis', 'power', 'art', 'power', 'France', 'Louis', 'orders', 'Moliere', 'Lully', 'work', 'together', 'build', 'up', 'comedy-ballet', 'genre', 'masterpieces', 'such', 'Le', 'Bourgeois', 'Gentilhomme', 'Louis', 'unpreased', 'Lully', 'bisexuality', 'scandals', 'young', 'boys', 'also', 'Louis', 'Lully', 'outstanding', 'music', 'talent', 'Lully', ""n't"", 'been', 'satisfied', 'working', 'feeling', 'Moliere', 'then', 'finally', 'court', 'Lully', 'got', 'old', 'leg', 'concert', 'have', 'leg', 'cut', 'then', 'Louis', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'dying', 'Lully.In', 'film', 'story', 'put', 'focus', 'Lully', 'feeling', 'love', 'master', 'never', 'completed', 'master', 'so', 'deeply', 'feeling', 'love', 'master', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'acted', 'Benoit', 'Magimel', 'detached', 'king', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'Louis', 'XIV.According', 'history', 'articles', 'Lully', 'composer', 'who', 'most', 'master', 'Lully', 'considered', 'Louis', 'personal', 'friend', 'guess', 'relationship', 'was', 'not', 'film.The', 'most', 'facinating', 'aspects', 'film', 'think', 'music', 'ballet', 'scene', 'custume', 'arts', 'cut', 'as', 'beautiful', 'paintings', 'museum']",N/A
950107,A1ST2R14AQXECS,B000BU4RQ2,Ronald Haak,"[1, 2]","A lavish, gaudily financed production + opulent costumes + exotic surroundings that leave us ga-ga and complaisant.  A handsome, near naked youth sprayed from head to toe in gold body paint rises to stage level on a rising platform.  Makeshift connecting scenes and a jerry built plot follow.  It's opening night at Las Vegas, right?  Nope, but it's an understandable mistake.Like its predecessor FARINELLI, this film uses music as a stalking horse for sensationalism and naughty topics.  The confusing plot, based on court rivalries about which we care nothing, is the vehicle to which debauches, intrigues, a murder and various pseudo-crises attach like barnacles.  The viewer may be excused for confusing these goings-on with excesses in the times of Nero, rather than a provincial, pre-Versailles French court.A more devastating fault for me is the evidence that cinematic imagination and intelligence are out to lunch.  Cliches abound.  ///(***) The king makes a series of unexpected announcements.  The various factions exchange repeated, anxious looks among themselves.  ///  (***)  The king's mother, excluded from policy making, is dying.  The king races pell mell down multiple staircases (round and round and round, shot from above) and bursts into the room.  The entourage around the bed is shooed out.  Cliched remarks are exchanged about motherly coldness, there's a riposte about Louis's neglect of his filial affections, and a bit of final advice about the need to look after the realm.  She dies, he retreats to a hallway and sobs.  It's hackneyed yawn-material in a cardboard presentation and has zero effect on plot developments.  No director with cinema savvy, as opposed to staging Las  Vegas extravaganzas, would consider clunking up the screen with this  sludge.  ///(***)- moving on, count the number of times the camera shot begins with people backed up flush against the lens and  then rushing straight  ahead down a narrow corridor, with  the camera following 20 feet behind.  Not to mention pointless and recurring close  ups that add nothing.  Another camera gambit  is to have the king repeatedly striding through crowded rooms with all that bowing  going on.  This, too, can't be repeated often enough and is tailor made to close a scene.The script saddles us with relationships that are undeveloped and go nowhere.  Lully awakens from a debauch covered with blood. He's naked and a naked page with his throat cut is lying on top of him.  He tears home and blurts out everything to his wife who  vows to stand behind him forever.  ""You have become my whole world.""  We're not allowed to know why she feels this way.  Why is she brought onscreen here?  She  has no influence at court.  Her support counts for  zero.  We never learn anything more about  her.  She's just the means to close the scene and get things underway again.  When  Lully starts to inform the king of the murder,  the king holds up a hand and says ""I don't want to hear about it.""  Naturally, a king shrugs off a naked sex/murder scandal --- oh,  bien sur!  All is permitted to his composer in residence, get it?  And it planes out knots in the plot flow, get it?On the whole, this is hasty, contrived, make-do cinema, oblivious to the requirements of the craft.  The director is gambling that opulence, glitz and stabs of Lully's music will conceal this from us and he'll get away with a cinematic version of the old shell game.Spectacle in confined spaces and lavish production values are on hand.  But is there mature cinematic direction and intelligence to support them?  No way!",2,"Brazen, gauche and self-indulgent.
