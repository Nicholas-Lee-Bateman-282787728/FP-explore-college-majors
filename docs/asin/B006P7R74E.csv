Also, it received some good reviews across The Pond.  While the first season was good, and the acting and and production values excellent, the second season devolved quickly into primarily a relational melodrama, as do so many initially well done series here in the US.  Some, as with an earlier reviewer, will enjoy this, but for me, the series has already lost its interest, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for genuine political drama or meatier fare than the bourgeois plights and gripes of this series protagonists in season two.",3,Devolving Into Melodrama,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,726,"['Bought', 'political', 'drama', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'largely', 'based', 'recommendations', 'enjoyed', 'Danish', 'crime', 'series', 'Forbrydelsen', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'Pond', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'second', 'season', 'devolved', 'quickly', 'primarily', 'relational', 'melodrama', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'initially', 'well', 'done', 'series', 'here', 'US', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series', 'already', 'lost', 'interest', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'genuine', 'political', 'drama', 'meatier', 'fare', 'bourgeois', 'plights', 'gripes', 'series', 'season', 'two']",Borgen: Season 2 (Ep. 11-20) [Region 2]

Borgen revolves around Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg Christensen (Sidse Babett Knudsen), her media adviser Kasper Juul (Pilou Asbk) and journalist Katrine Fnsmark (Birgitte Hjort Srensen) and the struggles in their private and professional lives.Sidse Babett Knudsen is even more astounding than in series 1. Hearing her character Birgitte speak in English from episode 11 was an absolute joy. As the series commences with episode 11, we see Birgitte in Afghanistan and debating whether or not Danish troops should remain in the country. More backstabbing back in Copenhagen follows with the selection of a new European commissioner. There's infighting at the very top of the Labour Party leading to a swift removal of their leader. This particular storyline had traces of actual events in UK politics involving Jacqui Smith's husband's viewing habits and the downfall of Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.For those who have seen The Killing - Season 1 and Borgen - Season 1 you'll be happy to see that Sren Malling is back as TV1 news editor Torben Friis, although his appearances are less than in the first series. Bjarne Henriksen also returns in his role as Defence Minister. The Killing - Season 2 fans will be pleased to see Mikael Birkkjr continue his role as Philip Christensen as well as Benedikte Hansen returning as journalist Hanne Holm. Birkkjr's appearances are less than in the first season.Borgen Series 2 ensures that DR's (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) tradition of making quality drama continues. There are fine performances from all the regulars and guest stars too. Lars Brygmann is one of Denmark's finest actors and he is fantastic as Labour minister Troels H&ouml;xenhaven. For me though Sidse Babett Knudsen really is the star of the show. Luckily series 3 is already in production in Denmark.Stand out episodes for me included episodes 11, 13, 17 and 18. As with series 1, the episodes contain many different political strands which seem to have me always wanting the best result for Birgitte.Similarly to The Killing, Borgen proves that it is not only the UK and USA as the only countries that can produce decent quality drama, Denmark is certainly up there with the big boys.Looking forward to season 3!!Enjoy!",5,Even better than Season 1,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,2405,"['second', 'season', '11', '20', 'Borgen', 'screened', 'September', 'November', '2011', 'Denmark', 'commanded', 'average', '53', '%', 'audience', 'share', 'DR1', 'Borgen', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Birgitte', 'Nyborg', 'Christensen', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'media', 'adviser', 'Kasper', 'Juul', 'Pilou', 'Asbk', 'journalist', 'Katrine', 'Fnsmark', 'Birgitte', 'Hjort', 'Srensen', 'struggles', 'private', 'professional', 'lives.Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'even', 'more', 'astounding', 'series', '1', 'Hearing', 'character', 'Birgitte', 'speak', 'English', 'episode', '11', 'was', 'absolute', 'joy', 'series', 'commences', 'episode', '11', 'see', 'Birgitte', 'Afghanistan', 'debating', 'not', 'Danish', 'troops', 'should', 'remain', 'country', 'More', 'backstabbing', 'back', 'Copenhagen', 'selection', 'new', 'European', 'commissioner', 'infighting', 'very', 'top', 'Labour', 'Party', 'leading', 'swift', 'removal', 'leader', 'particular', 'storyline', 'had', 'traces', 'actual', 'events', 'UK', 'politics', 'involving', 'Jacqui', 'Smith', 'husband', 'viewing', 'habits', 'downfall', 'Liberal', 'Democrat', 'leader', 'Charles', 'Kennedy.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Killing', 'Season', '1', 'Borgen', 'Season', '1', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'Sren', 'Malling', 'back', 'TV1', 'news', 'editor', 'Torben', 'Friis', 'appearances', 'are', 'less', 'first', 'series', 'Bjarne', 'Henriksen', 'also', 'role', 'Defence', 'Minister', 'Killing', 'Season', '2', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'see', 'Mikael', 'Birkkjr', 'continue', 'role', 'Philip', 'Christensen', 'as', 'well', 'Benedikte', 'Hansen', 'returning', 'journalist', 'Hanne', 'Holm', 'Birkkjr', 'appearances', 'are', 'less', 'first', 'season.Borgen', 'Series', '2', 'DR', 'Danish', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'tradition', 'making', 'quality', 'drama', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'regulars', 'guest', 'stars', 'too', 'Lars', 'Brygmann', 'one', 'Denmark', 'finest', 'actors', 'fantastic', 'Labour', 'minister', 'Troels', 'H', 'ouml', 'xenhaven', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'really', 'star', 'show', 'Luckily', 'series', '3', 'already', 'production', 'Denmark.Stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'included', 'episodes', '11', '13', '17', '18', 'series', '1', 'episodes', 'contain', 'many', 'different', 'political', 'strands', 'seem', 'have', 'always', 'wanting', 'best', 'result', 'Birgitte.Similarly', 'Killing', 'Borgen', 'not', 'only', 'UK', 'USA', 'only', 'countries', 'can', 'produce', 'decent', 'quality', 'drama', 'Denmark', 'certainly', 'up', 'there', 'big', 'boys.Looking', 'forward', 'season', '3', 'Enjoy']",Borgen: Season 2 (Ep. 11-20) [Region 2]

Sidse Babett Knudsen as the Prime Minister of Denmark has learned the tough lessons for a first term, now,she is tougher, better prepared and an about to be divorced woman. This second term is a tough year.Nyborg has learned how to take power from a bunch of male politicians who refer to her as ""Mommy"" whenever she leaves the room. Nyborg, does a lot of brilliant things, and it seems she is at the top of her game. Nyborg and her husband have separated, her children feel alone, her daughter develops an anxiety that is difficult to control, and Nyborg has no one to talk to. Her close mentor had a stroke and she had to fire him. Her spin doctor, Kasper, played by Pilou Asbaek is meeting his devilish childhood head on, his off and on girlfriend, Katrine Fosmark, played by Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, moves from one job to another to find her ethical boundaries. Everyone seems to be in flux, everyone has an edge, everyone is trying to find themselves.However, each episode finds that Nyborg is becoming stronger, more able to meet her detractors head on. She is still alone, her daughter in trouble, but things are about to come to a head. What we learn is that life is about compromise, political, personal, public and private. Nyborg blames herself for her daughter's problems, the marriage issues, and is now trying to look to the future to see what lays ahead. She has proved her mettle, and shown her colleagues that she is a true Prime Minister, in word and deed.This is one of the best political series on either side of the big pond. It is a must see for everyone.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-30-13",5,True Democracy Is In Denmark,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,1748,"['Riveting', 'word', 'used', 'first', 'season', ""'Borgen"", 'Season', 'Two', ""'Borgen"", 'just', 'riveting', 'only', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Denmark', 'learned', 'tough', 'lessons', 'first', 'term', 'now', 'tougher', 'better', 'prepared', 'about', 'be', 'divorced', 'woman', 'second', 'term', 'tough', 'year.Nyborg', 'learned', 'how', 'take', 'power', 'bunch', 'male', 'politicians', 'who', 'refer', 'Mommy', 'whenever', 'room', 'Nyborg', 'lot', 'brilliant', 'things', 'top', 'game', 'Nyborg', 'husband', 'have', 'separated', 'children', 'feel', 'alone', 'daughter', 'anxiety', 'difficult', 'control', 'Nyborg', 'one', 'talk', 'close', 'mentor', 'had', 'stroke', 'had', 'fire', 'spin', 'doctor', 'Kasper', 'played', 'Pilou', 'Asbaek', 'meeting', 'devilish', 'childhood', 'head', 'off', 'girlfriend', 'Katrine', 'Fosmark', 'played', 'Birgitte', 'Hjort', 'Sorensen', 'moves', 'one', 'job', 'find', 'ethical', 'boundaries', 'Everyone', 'be', 'flux', 'everyone', 'edge', 'everyone', 'trying', 'find', 'themselves.However', 'episode', 'Nyborg', 'becoming', 'stronger', 'more', 'able', 'meet', 'detractors', 'head', 'still', 'alone', 'daughter', 'trouble', 'things', 'are', 'come', 'head', 'What', 'learn', 'life', 'compromise', 'political', 'personal', 'public', 'private', 'Nyborg', 'daughter', 'problems', 'marriage', 'issues', 'now', 'trying', 'look', 'future', 'see', 'what', 'ahead', 'proved', 'mettle', 'shown', 'colleagues', 'true', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'word', 'deed.This', 'one', 'best', 'political', 'series', 'side', 'big', 'pond', 'must', 'see', 'everyone.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-30-13']",Borgen: Season 2 (Ep. 11-20) [Region 2]
