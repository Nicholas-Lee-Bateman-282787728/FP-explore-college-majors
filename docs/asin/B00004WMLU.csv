556078,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B00004WMLU,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[54, 56]","Based on Taylor Caldwell's novel, this 1976 NBC production came on the coattails of ABC's earlier success with &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man,&quot; and solidified the term &quot;mini-series&quot; in broadcast language. And it is a magnificent and stylish production cemented with good writing, superb acting and the message that even power and wealth carry a price, sometimes too high. &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; was reviewed in comparison to the real-life Kennedy clan, and maybe so. Still, the action begins on an America-bound ship on which the mother of a young Joseph Armagh and two younger siblings dies, leaving the adolescent Joseph in charge. And take charge he does, soon setting money and power as his goals. Joseph collects both in heaps but, by film's end, with Joseph then an old man, learns the devastating cost to him personally. The late Richard Jordan is terrific as the powerbroker Joseph, and the supporting cast is unparalleled, headed by Patty Duke's Emmy turn as Joseph's wife. Her fate is insanity triggered by an arranged marriage with a man who doesn't love her, the loss of two children and alcoholism. The series also introduced us to Blair Brown, who went on to a haunting portrait as Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1983 mini-series, &quot;Kennedy,&quot; and on series television in &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.&quot; Here, Ms. Brown is the &quot;other woman&quot; in Joseph's life, but she pulls it off with sympathy. As for Perry King, as Joseph's son seeking to be the country's first Irish Catholic president, there's no escaping the inevitable comparison to the real-life Irish Catholic who went after - and got - the presidency. Strongly written, well acted and lavishly produced, &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; is a worthy piece of entertainment.",4,The cost of power,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,1796,"['Based', 'Taylor', 'Caldwell', 'novel', '1976', 'NBC', 'production', 'came', 'coattails', 'ABC', 'earlier', 'success', 'quot', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'quot', 'solidified', 'term', 'quot', 'mini-series', 'quot', 'broadcast', 'language', 'magnificent', 'stylish', 'production', 'cemented', 'good', 'writing', 'superb', 'acting', 'message', 'even', 'power', 'wealth', 'carry', 'price', 'sometimes', 'too', 'high', 'quot', 'Captains', 'Kings', 'quot', 'was', 'reviewed', 'comparison', 'real-life', 'Kennedy', 'clan', 'maybe', 'so', 'Still', 'action', 'America-bound', 'ship', 'mother', 'young', 'Joseph', 'Armagh', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'dies', 'leaving', 'adolescent', 'Joseph', 'charge', 'take', 'charge', 'soon', 'setting', 'money', 'power', 'goals', 'Joseph', 'heaps', 'film', 'end', 'Joseph', 'then', 'old', 'man', 'devastating', 'cost', 'personally', 'late', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'terrific', 'powerbroker', 'Joseph', 'supporting', 'cast', 'unparalleled', 'headed', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Emmy', 'turn', 'Joseph', 'wife', 'fate', 'insanity', 'triggered', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'loss', 'two', 'children', 'alcoholism', 'series', 'also', 'introduced', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'who', 'went', 'haunting', 'portrait', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy', '1983', 'mini-series', 'quot', 'Kennedy', 'quot', 'series', 'television', 'quot', 'Days', 'Nights', 'Molly', 'Dodd.', 'quot', 'Here', 'Ms.', 'Brown', 'quot', 'other', 'woman', 'quot', 'Joseph', 'life', 'off', 'sympathy', 'Perry', 'King', 'Joseph', 'son', 'seeking', 'be', 'country', 'first', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'president', 'escaping', 'inevitable', 'comparison', 'real-life', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'who', 'went', 'got', 'presidency', 'Strongly', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'lavishly', 'produced', 'quot', 'Captains', 'Kings', 'quot', 'worthy', 'piece', 'entertainment']",N/A

We were hopeful it would be as good as some of the Masterpiece Theatre and BBC stuff. After the first few minutes, I sensed that we might be in trouble. Thinking it might get better, and for my wife's interest, I perservered to the end of part one. When it was over, we both looked at each other and agreed, that was enough. The acting seemed stiff and wooden and unpleasant. Furthermore, the dialogue did not seem to help or be conducive to the acting either. Overall, it appeared to be too much of a contrived and glorified soap opera with no grittiness or heart, just slick, formulaic script. Good literature, or movies, makes you care about the characters. Here, all I cared about was getting it over.",2,Disappointed,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,783,"['Based', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'wife', 'decided', 'watch', 'series', 'were', 'hopeful', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'BBC', 'stuff', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'sensed', 'might', 'be', 'trouble', 'Thinking', 'might', 'get', 'better', 'wife', 'interest', 'perservered', 'end', 'part', 'one', 'When', 'was', 'over', 'looked', 'other', 'agreed', 'was', 'enough', 'acting', 'seemed', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'unpleasant', 'Furthermore', 'dialogue', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'help', 'be', 'conducive', 'acting', 'either', 'Overall', 'appeared', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'contrived', 'glorified', 'soap', 'opera', 'grittiness', 'heart', 'just', 'slick', 'formulaic', 'script', 'Good', 'literature', 'movies', 'care', 'characters', 'Here', 'cared', 'was', 'getting']",N/A

As a huge Patty Duke fan, it is always wonderful to see her Emmy-winning performance, but this film is excellent, no matter who is on the screen. I was first disappointed by the lack of extras on here. I contacted Koch saying Ms. Duke (I run her official website) might be interested in doing some special features for this, but my words went ignored for months. By the time I spoke with them again, it was too late. They said Blair Brown was the only actor from this huge mini-series they could get a hold of. That is doubtful, although the low budget-looking intereview with Brown is excellent. Clocking in at just over sixteen minutes, Brown offers many wonderful tidbits on the making of this epic mini-series.I have accepted the lack of extras, but I cannot accept the lack of picture quality on this set. It's awful! I have not seen the Universal- released VHS from about ten years ago in a while, but I can tell you this DVD picture is no improvement over the VHS. In fact, I think it may be worse. The color of the picture is not bad, but the specks on every single frame of the film make me feel like I am watching it back on TNT in the early '90s! At least Koch does not falsely claim to have digitally restored this, but in 2009 I guess I assumed it was a given. Silly me.Despite the flaws of the DVD itself, this mini-series should not be missed. In my own opinion it is one of the finest pieces of that genre in television history, something that could stand proudly beside Angels in America and Tales of the City. The price is not bad (especially if you get it from a vendor on here). This should be part of everyone's DVD library if for no other reason than to see televison at it's very best.",5,Spectacular Mini-Series; Shoddy DVD,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,1835,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'learned', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'under-rated', 'television', 'treasure', 'was', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'huge', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'fan', 'always', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Emmy-winning', 'performance', 'film', 'excellent', 'matter', 'who', 'screen', 'was', 'first', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'extras', 'here', 'contacted', 'Koch', 'saying', 'Ms.', 'Duke', 'run', 'official', 'website', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'doing', 'special', 'features', 'words', 'went', 'ignored', 'months', 'time', 'spoke', 'again', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'said', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'huge', 'mini-series', 'could', 'get', 'hold', 'doubtful', 'low', 'budget-looking', 'intereview', 'Brown', 'excellent', 'Clocking', 'just', 'sixteen', 'minutes', 'Brown', 'many', 'wonderful', 'tidbits', 'making', 'epic', 'mini-series.I', 'have', 'accepted', 'lack', 'extras', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'lack', 'picture', 'quality', 'set', 'awful', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Universal-', 'released', 'VHS', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'while', 'can', 'tell', 'DVD', 'picture', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'fact', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'worse', 'color', 'picture', 'not', 'bad', 'specks', 'single', 'frame', 'film', 'make', 'feel', 'am', 'watching', 'back', 'TNT', 'early', 'least', 'Koch', 'not', 'falsely', 'claim', 'have', 'digitally', 'restored', '2009', 'guess', 'assumed', 'was', 'given', 'Silly', 'me.Despite', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'mini-series', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'own', 'opinion', 'one', 'finest', 'pieces', 'genre', 'television', 'history', 'something', 'could', 'stand', 'proudly', 'beside', 'Angels', 'America', 'Tales', 'City', 'price', 'not', 'bad', 'especially', 'get', 'vendor', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'everyone', 'DVD', 'library', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'televison', 'very', 'best']",N/A
