Still, it does have their daughter, Tandy Cronyn, in it as her daughter in the movie. In it, Grace has to move out of her own place and live with her daughter and husband. She wants to be useful and, unable to find a job, finds herself at a local cable recording studio starring in her own show. What unfolds from there I won't say, except you will meet a workaholic mother and her daughter, and learn about the shady practices of unscrupulous businessmen out to make a buck. In the end is the warm feeling you expect at Christmas, and this movie will not let you down.
