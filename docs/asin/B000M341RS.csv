The Mayor sort of goes along with the idea, adding his on twist or making alterations to it. Various strange things are said and done and everything ends up horribly. It is funny. The animation is weird. There is always a usually recognizable celebrity guest star. Episodes last 13 minutes or so. There are other things to mention about the show, but I'll leave these out of my review so you can be surprised and delighted. Order your copy today!

1042922,A2AU2HM2MW8KDQ,B000M341RS,Bill Perez,"[25, 29]","A persistent delusion among ordinary Americans is that they can singlehandedly transform their ideas & pluck into a path to riches, or at least subsistence. Despite being coerced and humiliated daily by a corporate-controlled system of intrusive marketing tactics, state complicity & and a continuous fleecing by all involved, Americans in large measure still accept the preposterous precepts of pop Libertarianism, the clandestine essence of which is merciless social Darwinism. In Tom Goes to the Mayor, these delusions are just as mercilessly autopsied and found nauseatingly necrotic to their core.The setting is precise: a small city, ""Jefferton"", located at the interchange of two Interstates, according to the paper placemat at the local ""Gulliver's"" seen briefly in the opening credits. Its charms are listed in the theme song: Community Spirit! Shopping! Food! What ""community spirit"" exists in Jefferton, however, is simply there to nourish the tepid commerce comprising the ""shopping"" and ""food"". The central character, Tom, is a gutted victim of postmodern social collapse: unemployed, of course; maxed out on his cards; behind in every payment he is responsible for; trapped in the second marriage of a morbidly obese ogress with fat, snarling diabetic brats; his brain infected with self-help & business-press aphorisms that make his utterances sound like hackneyed PowerPoint presentations half the time. The forces he confronts are personified in the twisted lunatic Mayor whom he must petition in each episode.Tom is compelled by his circumstances to try and lever every lame & insipid entrepreneurial idea he can think of into some sort of cash flow. These attempts fail utterly in every instance, each time surreally illustrating another absurd aspect of postindustrial life in the US. There is no respite, no comfort, and absolutely no success available to Tom--the game is brazenly rigged against him at every juncture. The Mayor is a cryptic imp in Tom's perdition, a tempter and tormentor egging Tom forward from force-fed false hope to brutal disillusionment.But Tom's despair is our edification: the show acidly flays the counterfeit affirmations of American capitalism's ideological face and lays bare its banal teeth and claws.

He tries to go to the Mayor to see if he can share some of this fresh ideas for starting a new business only for his innovative business ventures to crash and burn each episode.
