1123634,A39K9GDTIZ0933,B000ZYIRBK,Braden Pickering,"[2, 3]","Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a Charles Band fan, and am well acquainted with a number of his other Full Moon productions, such as Demonic Toys, Doll Graveyard, Evil Bong, and my personal favorite, the Gingerdead Man. I more or less enjoy all of the above movies to varying degrees because while not really scary, they are cheesy and fun, and at times very clever considering what kind of budget they were made on. I ""get"" his style and therefore thought it would be reasonable to expect Dangerous Worry Dolls to be in the same vein. But, while not totally awful, it didn't really turn out to be what I assumed it would be - or what I felt it presented itself as - which was slightly disappointing.I won't pad my review by rehashing the plot as many others have done already, but I would just like to point out that there really aren't any worry dolls to be found here, and all the action/mayhem is done by the young woman who is simply possessed by them. Or ""it"" I should say, since we really only ever get to see one of them.  Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything - this will become evident quickly enough. The atmosphere and story are set up decently and the acting is actually fairly passable for this kind of thing, and it does work in other ways as a black comedy of sorts, but if you're looking forward to a ""killer doll"" type movie, as I was, this isn't it. Maybe Band was trying to approach this from a grittier angle as opposed to his usual outright silliness (well, aside from a few scenes and, er, character revelations) but either way I'm afraid it isn't quite up to par with the rest of his repertoire. I bought it as part of a 3-film combo pack so I guess I can't be too bummed for the price I paid, but I also can't honestly say I'd go out of my way to watch it again.",3,"Not completely awful, but a bit misrepresented",1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,1802,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', ""'m"", 'Charles', 'Band', 'fan', 'am', 'well', 'acquainted', 'number', 'other', 'Full', 'Moon', 'productions', 'such', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'Doll', 'Graveyard', 'Evil', 'Bong', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'more', 'less', 'above', 'movies', 'varying', 'degrees', 'because', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'are', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'times', 'very', 'clever', 'considering', 'what', 'kind', 'budget', 'were', 'made', 'get', 'style', 'therefore', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'reasonable', 'expect', 'Dangerous', 'Worry', 'Dolls', 'be', 'same', 'vein', 'not', 'totally', 'awful', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'what', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'felt', 'presented', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointing.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pad', 'review', 'rehashing', 'plot', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'already', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'worry', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'action/mayhem', 'done', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'simply', 'possessed', 'should', 'say', 'really', 'only', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'will', 'become', 'evident', 'quickly', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'decently', 'acting', 'actually', 'fairly', 'passable', 'kind', 'thing', 'work', 'other', 'ways', 'black', 'comedy', 'sorts', ""'re"", 'looking', 'forward', 'killer', 'doll', 'type', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'Maybe', 'Band', 'was', 'trying', 'approach', 'grittier', 'angle', 'opposed', 'usual', 'outright', 'silliness', 'well', 'aside', 'few', 'scenes', 'er', 'character', 'revelations', 'way', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'par', 'rest', 'repertoire', 'bought', 'part', '3-film', 'combo', 'pack', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'bummed', 'price', 'paid', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', ""'d"", 'go', 'way', 'watch', 'again']",Dangerous Worry Dolls

Then you see the movie and realize that you've already seen all the sexy parts in the trailer.  Basically, a girl is in prison, picked on by her fellow inmates, abused by the warden, raped by a guard, and befriended by the dumb girl.  Women in Prison 101 kinda stuff.  But with very little nudity.  What an odd thing to leave out, the single reason most people sit through these things.  Anyhow, the girl's daughter comes to visit her and gives her some worry dolls.  She's supposed to tell them her worries, then put them under her pillow.  When she wakes up in the morning, all her worries will be gone.  She wakes up in the morning with one of the dolls living in her forehead.  She takes vengeance on all those who wronged her, and then the movie just kind of loses track of her.  Is she saved?  Vindicated?  Dunno.  They just move on to the dumb girl who has taken possession of the dolls, as if the main character didn't matter anymore.Overall, very average stuff.

1123637,A364W6U6YL219D,B000ZYIRBK,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[4, 4]","Dangerous Worry Dolls (2008) Producer/director Charles Band (Evil Bong) dips into his ""possessed plaything"" well once again for this horror flick. We start right off with an opening shot of Eva (Jessica Morris - Dead Man's Hand) getting slammed into a wall by her tormentors, leaving it up to us to play catch-up for a few seconds to realize we're in a women's prison and Eva is going to be our protagonist. She's no angel, having committed a robbery with some cohorts that left someone dead, but now she just wants to serve her time and get back to life on the outside with her daughter. So, she's in this very standard issue women's prison, with evil inmates, a sadistic guard, and a completely unsympathetic warden. Luckily her daughter gives her a box of tiny worry dolls to put under her pillow and take all her cares away. Unluckily, these worry dolls are supernatural, and crawl into her ear while she's sleeping, (!) the better to take over her personality and give her a new outlook on life. And death, too, as in killing all her enemies. Although there are a couple of surprises along the way (the bad guard's secret, for example) this one follows the expected blueprint pretty much down the line. It's not a bad little movie, but still feels a bit like missed opportunities. The idea is wackily wonderful, and the sight of Eva with her forehead split open and a tiny worry doll poking out and glaring at her victim is really cool, but the micro budget, allowing for just a few actors and only a smidgen of action, means this one doesn't end up the small gem it could have been had everything been on a slightly larger scale. But it's still watchable, especially if you make the second half of a ""drive in double feature"" with something maybe a bit bigger in scope.",3,The smallest toys Charles Band ever brought to life!,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,1775,"['Dangerous', 'Worry', 'Dolls', '2008', 'Producer/director', 'Charles', 'Band', 'Evil', 'Bong', 'possessed', 'plaything', 'well', 'once', 'again', 'horror', 'flick', 'start', 'right', 'off', 'opening', 'shot', 'Eva', 'Jessica', 'Morris', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Hand', 'getting', 'slammed', 'wall', 'tormentors', 'leaving', 'play', 'catch-up', 'few', 'seconds', 'realize', ""'re"", 'women', 'prison', 'Eva', 'going', 'be', 'protagonist', 'angel', 'having', 'committed', 'robbery', 'cohorts', 'left', 'someone', 'dead', 'now', 'just', 'serve', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'outside', 'daughter', 'So', 'very', 'standard', 'issue', 'women', 'prison', 'evil', 'inmates', 'sadistic', 'guard', 'completely', 'unsympathetic', 'warden', 'Luckily', 'daughter', 'box', 'tiny', 'worry', 'put', 'pillow', 'take', 'cares', 'away', 'Unluckily', 'worry', 'dolls', 'are', 'supernatural', 'crawl', 'ear', 'sleeping', 'better', 'take', 'over', 'personality', 'give', 'new', 'outlook', 'life', 'death', 'too', 'killing', 'enemies', 'are', 'couple', 'surprises', 'way', 'bad', 'guard', 'secret', 'example', 'one', 'expected', 'blueprint', 'pretty', 'much', 'line', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'movie', 'still', 'bit', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'idea', 'wackily', 'wonderful', 'sight', 'Eva', 'forehead', 'split', 'open', 'tiny', 'worry', 'doll', 'poking', 'out', 'glaring', 'victim', 'really', 'cool', 'micro', 'budget', 'allowing', 'just', 'few', 'actors', 'only', 'smidgen', 'action', 'one', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'small', 'gem', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'everything', 'been', 'slightly', 'larger', 'scale', 'still', 'watchable', 'especially', 'make', 'second', 'half', 'drive', 'double', 'feature', 'something', 'maybe', 'bit', 'bigger', 'scope']",Dangerous Worry Dolls

1123639,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000ZYIRBK,Sid the Elf,"[2, 2]","If you find yourself searching for a legitimate horror flick and come across any Full Moon production you most likely will be very let down. However if you are in the market for a low budget b disaster then Full Moon is the bull to rev your engine. Anything in their vast catalog couldn't have cost more then $1000 to make. The acting is always terrible, the special effects are hilarious, and the plots usually go nowhere. For us this is simply perfect. It falls into that our favorite category of ""so bad it's good,"" and we couldn't be more appreciative to Full Moon for the b they provide. It's given us years of laughs and entertainment and seems as if it will never stop.The film is centered around a female prisoner Eva as she is harassed on a daily basis. Fellow inmates, officers, and even the warden abuse this girl non-stop (which parallels to Lock Up perfectly). One afternoon Eva aka the female Leone is visited by her 10 year old daughter who brings her a gift. They are called worry dolls which will solve your problems if you put them under your pillow at night. She decides to give it a try and wakes up a different person. She all of a sudden becomes uber tough and begins exacting her revenge. Turns out one of the ""Worry Dolls"" embedded itself in her skull and now controls her moves. She winds up taking out everyone that's caused her any grief. The best scene had to be when Eva electrocutes the Warden with some $5 jumper cables from Walmart followed by some insanely bad special effects that looked like computerized sparks. It would have been better if they hooked up a few sparklers to the warden and let them burn down. The film finally ends with Eva being put in solitary confinement where she probably was forced to say Leone 510 when the flashing light cam on.All in all we had another fun viewing from Full Moon. Like we said you can't go into these movies expecting anything but the worst, which somehow makes it the best. In no way will you be scared at any point but your stomach will probably hurt from laughing so much. This company has mastered the art of pumping out b at an alarming rate. If you can't get enough low budget horror then this and most Charles Band works are a safe bet.",3,Lock Up Full Moon Style,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,2222,"['find', 'searching', 'legitimate', 'horror', 'flick', 'come', 'Full', 'Moon', 'production', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'let', 'down', 'However', 'are', 'market', 'low', 'budget', 'b', 'disaster', 'then', 'Full', 'Moon', 'bull', 'rev', 'engine', 'Anything', 'vast', 'catalog', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cost', 'more', 'then', '1000', 'make', 'acting', 'always', 'terrible', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'hilarious', 'plots', 'usually', 'go', 'nowhere', 'simply', 'perfect', 'favorite', 'category', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'appreciative', 'Full', 'Moon', 'b', 'provide', 'given', 'years', 'laughs', 'entertainment', 'will', 'never', 'stop.The', 'film', 'centered', 'female', 'prisoner', 'Eva', 'harassed', 'daily', 'basis', 'Fellow', 'officers', 'even', 'warden', 'abuse', 'girl', 'non-stop', 'Lock', 'Up', 'perfectly', 'One', 'afternoon', 'Eva', 'female', 'Leone', 'visited', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'gift', 'are', 'called', 'worry', 'dolls', 'will', 'solve', 'problems', 'put', 'pillow', 'night', 'give', 'try', 'up', 'different', 'person', 'sudden', 'becomes', 'uber', 'tough', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'out', 'one', 'Worry', 'Dolls', 'embedded', 'skull', 'now', 'moves', 'up', 'taking', 'out', 'everyone', 'caused', 'grief', 'best', 'scene', 'had', 'be', 'when', 'Eva', 'Warden', '5', 'jumper', 'cables', 'Walmart', 'followed', 'insanely', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'looked', 'computerized', 'sparks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'hooked', 'up', 'few', 'sparklers', 'warden', 'let', 'burn', 'down', 'film', 'finally', 'Eva', 'being', 'put', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'where', 'probably', 'was', 'forced', 'say', 'Leone', '510', 'when', 'flashing', 'light', 'cam', 'on.All', 'had', 'fun', 'viewing', 'Full', 'Moon', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'expecting', 'anything', 'worst', 'somehow', 'best', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'point', 'stomach', 'will', 'probably', 'hurt', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'company', 'mastered', 'art', 'pumping', 'out', 'b', 'alarming', 'rate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'then', 'most', 'Charles', 'Band', 'works', 'are', 'safe', 'bet']",Dangerous Worry Dolls
