75736,A2BJ3MTMMW4L37,0784011559,adil ali,"[0, 0]","Keitel never received the critical acclaim of his peers from the same era, partly because he was quite limited as an actor.  While Deniro and Pacino wer capable of playing a multitude of roles, Keitel was capable of playing a person who was at times masculine and at other times tender.Bad Lieutenant is no exception.  Set in the mean streets of New York, Keitel plays a cop(I use the term loosely), who for years has been getting high and accepting favors from local prostitutes.  After he is called to investigate the rape of a nun, he wants redemption.Keitel's performance is not oscar-worthy, but the agony he beings to the role of Lieutenant is worthy of praise.  Keitel does almost no real acting here, as he hardly has any conversations with anybody.  I think Ferrara wanted to emphasize Lt's isolation from his surroundings(this is further confirmed by the fact that the Lieutenant has no real identity in the credits).Shortly after viewing this film I read Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.  I have been able to draw several parallels between that book and Bad Lieutenant.  Both stories tell of a man who is aware of the ailments of the society in which he lives, and yet despite being aware of them, they constantly affect his life.  In Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, the narrators relationship with his son was strained, yet he constantly talks about a lcak of quality in American life, be it in relationships, everyday labour, or whatnot.  Similarly in Bad Lieutenant, LT is commiti=ting crime of greater magnitude than the people he arrests!In my opinion, Bad Lieutenant is one of the only movies that really explores the downfalls of this society.  I've seen Training Day with Denzel, and I feel that that is much too glorified to be true.  Bad Lieuteant is realistic and much more bold than Training Day.",5,poignant,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,1840,"['Keitel', 'never', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'peers', 'same', 'era', 'partly', 'was', 'quite', 'limited', 'actor', 'Deniro', 'Pacino', 'wer', 'capable', 'playing', 'multitude', 'roles', 'Keitel', 'was', 'capable', 'playing', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'times', 'masculine', 'other', 'times', 'tender.Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'exception', 'Set', 'mean', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Keitel', 'cop', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'who', 'years', 'been', 'getting', 'high', 'accepting', 'favors', 'local', 'prostitutes', 'called', 'investigate', 'rape', 'nun', 'redemption.Keitel', 'performance', 'not', 'oscar-worthy', 'agony', 'role', 'Lieutenant', 'worthy', 'praise', 'Keitel', 'almost', 'real', 'acting', 'here', 'hardly', 'conversations', 'anybody', 'think', 'Ferrara', 'wanted', 'emphasize', 'Lt', 'isolation', 'surroundings', 'further', 'confirmed', 'fact', 'Lieutenant', 'real', 'identity', 'credits', '.Shortly', 'viewing', 'film', 'read', 'Zen', 'art', 'motorcycle', 'maintenance', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'draw', 'several', 'parallels', 'book', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Both', 'stories', 'tell', 'man', 'who', 'aware', 'ailments', 'society', 'yet', 'being', 'aware', 'constantly', 'affect', 'life', 'Zen', 'art', 'motorcycle', 'maintenance', 'narrators', 'relationship', 'son', 'was', 'strained', 'yet', 'constantly', 'lcak', 'quality', 'American', 'life', 'be', 'relationships', 'everyday', 'labour', 'whatnot', 'Similarly', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'LT', 'commiti=ting', 'crime', 'greater', 'magnitude', 'people', 'opinion', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'one', 'only', 'movies', 'really', 'downfalls', 'society', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Training', 'Day', 'Denzel', 'feel', 'much', 'too', 'glorified', 'be', 'true', 'Bad', 'Lieuteant', 'realistic', 'much', 'more', 'bold', 'Training', 'Day']",N/A

75738,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0784011559,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 17]","Harvey Keitel plays a Lieutenant who is heavily into drugs, sex, and gambling. He has no name, and that is for a reason. This film wants to show the animosity of the character. It wants to create a sense that Keitel is playing an ""everyman"". Not necessarily a cop with a specific name, but anyone...almost showing us that this type of corruption happens in the least expected places, by the least expected people. The film opens with Keitel taking his children to school. We are disillusioned by the idea, that he has strong family values, perhaps he isn't the ""bad"" cop that everyone is expecting.  After 10 minutes into the film, that idea changes dramatically.  We see him trying to steal drugs out of a car, looking at the breasts of a shot girl, by taking money from a grocery store owner, and finally by doing mass amounts of cocaine and heroine.  After about thirty minutes of no story line, just graphic sex and drug use, we are pushed into yet another horrifying scene. This is supposed to be the ""plot"" of the film.  An inexplicable act of violence takes place that makes Keitel reconsider his chosen path of life.  His world gets changed all around as he tries to hunt down the criminals of this case, and also dramatically use religion to look back at his soul.  Can both these criminals and Keitel be saved?Too much character development can hurt or help a film. In this case, it hurt it.  With very small amounts of dialogue, but extra elongated drug scenes, we are forced to have the impression that Keitel is a bad cop. Alright, after five minutes I get it...but why show more?  Why take about three-fourths of the film to show all of the evil deeds that this Lieutenant is capable of doing?  This could have been a very dark and disturbing film, but instead it fell into the problem that ""The Deer Hunter"" had.  The director chose to use the ""leave the camera running"" technique.  This means, that he thinks that the true nature of the character will come out the longer that he leaves the camera running during a scene. This can be true in some instances, but for this film it did not. I understood that he was a corrupt cop, I mean, I got that much from the title. Tell me more...why was he a bad cop?  This might seem like a small point, but it would have helped when trying to get into the mindset of the character.I felt that the director left too much up for the viewer to assume. For the two big drug scenes, there were some random people that Keitel was with, and I had no clue who they were.  Develop these smaller characters too, this will allow you to build a believable world for the main character.  If you don't do this, then when your ""big"" central moment does occur the viewer will not be lost. When Keitel begins looking back at his own life actions, he begins to worry that he doesn't know what to do to make things right, or how to do ""the right thing"".  For too long he has been bending the rules, and living the lifestyle that he has become accustomed to...that when he wants to change his life, he doesn't know how to. BUT I will tell you this that by doing more drugs and by allowing crime to continue does not push him in the right direction.Overall, there wasn't enough development of Keitel's character to justify being shocked by this movie.  I remember very clearly the last thought running through my mind when the credits rolled, it was...""Thank God this film is over...."".Grade:  * out of *****",1,"I'm sorry, Lord.

75739,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0784011559,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","To say that `Bad Lieutenant' is disturbing or unsettling would be an understatement.  To say that it is a masterpiece would be an overstatement.  To admit that the film's layers of darkness shed light on a poignant study of redemption and forgiveness would be hitting the nail on the head.  There is a lot within `Bad Lieutenant' that is poised and ready to make you turn away (and possibly turn it off) but there is a lot hidden beneath the often graphic surface that is waiting to be dissected for the benefit of the viewer.If you can get through the film then you will have a lot to talk about.Harvey Keitel (in his finest on-screen performance) plays the Lieutenant, a drug addicted sleaze who is truly defined by the title `bad'.  The film's opening scenes paint him in all his perverse glory but soon we see the layers of anarchy stripped away to reveal a truly distressed soul seeking some sort of solace.Keitel is really the reason to see this film.The premise is slightly formulaic, but the way it is handled (this is less a story about a crime and more the story of the man investigating the crime) helps elevate the seemingly generic prose.  It is a highly intense character study that benefits from a steady (and edgy) hand on the part of director Abel Ferrara and a fearless (and gutsy) performance by Harvey Keitel.Let's just talk for a minute about Keitel.  I really love this guy as an actor, and in the early 90's (late 80's) he was flawless.  With strong, award worthy performances in films like `The Last Temptation of Christ', `Reservoir Dogs', `Thelma and Louise' and even `Sister Act', Keitel was proving himself a valuable player in American cinema.  It's easy to see why this performance was ignored by Oscar, beings the graphic and at times rough nature of the film, but this is by far the best performance of the year and one of the greatest male performances of all time.  Early on in the film there is a scene where Keitel pulls over two young girls driving illegally, and instead of arresting them or calling their parents he abuses them (not physically, but mentally, and quite graphically).  I mention this scene because it is hard to stomach and completely blunt in nature, and one that most actors would have shied away from completely.  Keitel went there, ALL THE WAY THERE, and delivered a shockingly realistic portrayal of a very, very `bad' man.  There are few films that capture this level of fearlessness (think De Niro's `Taxi Driver' or Crowe's `Romper Stomper').Keitel is a revelation.Like I said, this film is not a masterpiece, and it has its faults, but for the most part the film succeeds in being more than it appears.  There is a lot brimming below the surface here that one could quickly overlook if they are not careful.  It is not a film for everyone, and its nature is going to turn a lot of people off, but if you can stomach it you will be heavily rewarded with a performance that is unlike any other you have ever seen.",4,Fearless...,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2974,"['say', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'disturbing', 'unsettling', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'say', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'be', 'overstatement', 'admit', 'film', 'layers', 'darkness', 'shed', 'light', 'poignant', 'study', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'would', 'be', 'hitting', 'nail', 'head', 'lot', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'poised', 'ready', 'make', 'turn', 'away', 'possibly', 'turn', 'off', 'lot', 'hidden', 'often', 'graphic', 'surface', 'waiting', 'be', 'dissected', 'benefit', 'viewer.If', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'talk', 'about.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'finest', 'on-screen', 'performance', 'Lieutenant', 'drug', 'addicted', 'sleaze', 'who', 'truly', 'defined', 'title', 'bad', 'film', 'opening', 'scenes', 'paint', 'perverse', 'glory', 'soon', 'see', 'layers', 'anarchy', 'stripped', 'away', 'reveal', 'truly', 'distressed', 'soul', 'seeking', 'sort', 'solace.Keitel', 'really', 'reason', 'see', 'film.The', 'premise', 'slightly', 'formulaic', 'way', 'handled', 'less', 'story', 'crime', 'more', 'story', 'man', 'investigating', 'crime', 'elevate', 'seemingly', 'generic', 'prose', 'highly', 'intense', 'character', 'study', 'benefits', 'steady', 'edgy', 'hand', 'part', 'director', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'fearless', 'gutsy', 'performance', 'Harvey', 'Keitel.Let', 'just', 'talk', 'minute', 'Keitel', 'really', 'love', 'guy', 'actor', 'early', '90', 'late', '80', 'was', 'flawless', 'strong', 'award', 'worthy', 'performances', 'films', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'even', 'Sister', 'Act', 'Keitel', 'was', 'proving', 'valuable', 'player', 'American', 'cinema', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'performance', 'was', 'ignored', 'Oscar', 'graphic', 'times', 'rough', 'nature', 'film', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'year', 'one', 'greatest', 'male', 'performances', 'time', 'Early', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Keitel', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'driving', 'illegally', 'instead', 'arresting', 'calling', 'parents', 'not', 'physically', 'mentally', 'quite', 'graphically', 'mention', 'scene', 'hard', 'stomach', 'completely', 'blunt', 'nature', 'one', 'most', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'completely', 'Keitel', 'went', 'there', 'WAY', 'THERE', 'delivered', 'shockingly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'man', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'capture', 'level', 'fearlessness', 'think', 'De', 'Niro', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Crowe', 'Romper', 'Stomper', '.Keitel', 'revelation.Like', 'said', 'film', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'faults', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'lot', 'brimming', 'surface', 'here', 'one', 'could', 'quickly', 'overlook', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'nature', 'going', 'turn', 'lot', 'people', 'can', 'stomach', 'will', 'be', 'heavily', 'rewarded', 'performance', 'other', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

I saw it over and over when it was first released, and I never cease to be astonished by its bravery and its raw, often horrifying beauty.  Ferrara and Keitel are both geniuses.  The film is brilliantly paced and controlled and every detail has rich meaning.  It's a tale of damnation, deep suffering and redemption.  All of Keitel's performances are terrific, but this is one of the very greatest, even rivalling his performance in The Piano.  --- Again, this is not for children.  But it is for the adult  mind that craves originality, fearless artistic vision and absolutely dazzling  film making.  Never forget, even during the most shocking scenes that this is a film with a conscience and  immense depth.  It's transformative and unforgettable.  During my long years away from the Church, this was a film that drew me closer to my Catholic faith, and certainly closer to my final admission that I believed in God. The film believes in God, and it will astonish you as it reveals this to you.  ---  I can't praise it enough.  I feel inadequate in the face of its complexity.

75741,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,0784011559,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[7, 16]","I got a chance to see this movie recently on IFC (Independent Film Channel). I was so intrigued by the concept of the plot and have found over the years that almost anything Harvey Keitel is in is well worth watching. Unfortunately, this film wasn't one of them. The problem here is not the plot or the acting. It's the film maker. Period. My impression after watching this was that the director must have been a first year film student who was trying every trick he heard in class without really understanding how it impacts up on the screen.Harvey Keitel plays a cop who's scraping bottom. He loses consistantly to the bookies and now is up to his ears in gambling debt. Add to that he's a drug addict and uses his position as a detective to, shall we say, take advantage of underage girls. Basically, he has no redeeming qualities. When a nun is brutally raped the case falls into his lap and as he investigates crime he begins to slowly yearn for a redemption that he thought was beyond his reach.Sounds like a good plot, right? Well it is, on paper. The possibilities here are just endless. But from concept-to-filming something went very wrong. More and more, as you watch the plot becomes secondary. Director Abel Ferrara throws bad scene after bad scene at a wall, hoping it will stick, and very few do. Two examples of a couple of scenes that really stand out to me as horrible film making: The first, when the nun is being attacked we are treated to a series of quick shots with the camera, first of the nun as she is being raped, then cut quickly to a icon of Christ, then back to the nun as she is screaming, then back to Christ, then back....well you get the idea. I'm assuming that this was suppose be an analogy that the nun's rape was like the crucifixion of the Savior. Only, it's really a bad analogy. And the quickness of the cuts may have been done to try and build the tempo of the scene but instead was just plain annoying.But the worst scene, by far, was the full frontal nudity of Keitel. For two reasons: 1) with apologies to the actor, it's just not a pleasent sight. I could have gone the rest of my life without seeing that image. But more importantly: 2) Keitel's nudity really had no reason to be included in this scene. None. It did not, in any way, advance the plot of the film. This specific scene shows him on a drug-induced high and we see him swaying back and forth in this trance. OK, showing him high does advance the movie but the nudity wasn't necessary to do that. It was like the director was saying, ""Hey look what I got Harvey Keitel to do."" To be honest I'm not a big fan of full frontal nudity, in most cases I think it cheapens the scene, but can at least understand it IF THERE IS A PURPOSE TO IT. Here there isn't. It was a waste of time and film and made a bad film watching experience even worse.Again, this is a bad film. If it were possible to give it zero stars then I would have. I wouldn't recommend this to any one.",1,"Sorry people, the Lieutenant isn't the only thing bad here. It's a bad film.

Bad Lieutenant fails because it's neither interesting nor meaningful. In short, it was a bland picture that went nowhere. It didn't say anything significant for me, and I wanted to see something poignant about the character, but it's not there. Instead, I am being shown redundantly his lifestyle through drug use, some sex, and plenty of World Series baseball talk while the life of Keitel's character comes spiraling downward. Do I care? That's the question. And that's the question that killed Bad Lieutenant. Looking at his performance, Harvey Keitel made a travesty out of himself because his character doesn't look real, doesn't look soulful, and doesn't look humane. Rather, I see this actor who is pretending. On the other hand, Bad Lieutenant is unique for one thing: it's an unrestrained picture. That's as far as it gets. Abel Ferrara, who has already disappointed me with King of New York, does it again for me through Bad Lieutenant. Before being a serious filmmaker, Abel Ferrara must develop his characters for us to care about. After that part is done, then train the actors to become the characters, not actors already being themselves.

But it was basically an hour and a half of pervasive drug use, obsession over baseball games, and flat dialog.Yes, I understood the idea of him being a filthy low-life who redeems himself, but it could have been written better, and it wasn't as alarming as I was led to believe. The nun rape scene was short and not terribly shocking, and the  nude scene other reviewers mentioned was dull and bizarre to say the least.  By the end of the movie, you'll be thoroughly tired of him making noises like a goat in heat.Now, don't get me wrong, Harvey Keitel is an EXCELLENT actor.  I LOVE his work.  This one just fell a bit flat.  For seedy 'underbelly of society' style shock value, I'd rather pull out ""Crimes of Passion"", or ""Kalifornia"", quite honestly.  (""Crimes of Passion""'s scene with the nighstick, the cop, and the Ivory soap comment is much more vile and shocking than the nun scene here).It does get a thumbs up for one scene near the end where he's yelling at a Jesus hallucination in the church.

He is a bland director, favoring realism over spectacle. And while many directors fail in their attempt to reach their audience by not creating the appropriate 'world' for their characters to interact in, Ferrara always seems to make us connect with his characters. Even though we may not want to in the first place. What Ferrara lacks in style, he makes up for in sheer bravery. 'Bad Lieutenant' is his finest film since 'Ms. 45' and his best overall. Following a corrupt (to say the very least) cop through his last few days on earth, Ferrara manages to create a film that's both harrowing and challenging. It is also a movie that's as much about religion and  the saving of one's own soul as it is about drug addiction and the corruption of power. The 'bad lieutenant' is never given a name. Who he is is not important. It's what he has become that matters. He is a gambler, a thief, a guilt-ridden Catholic, and a drug-addict. He is seen snorting cocaine outside his children's school, drinking in church, trying to steal drugs from the car of a recently murdered dealer, and even pocketing money from two young men who recently robbed a convienant store. The turning point of his life comes when he begins to investigate the brutal rape of a young nun. Sounds like a fun film, huh? Indeed this is a shocking movie, one which leaves an aftertaste at the base of your throat that you will not get rid of for days and days, but at it's center is a shred of hope, not much, but you feel it kicking and screaming there, waiting for someone to hear it. Harvey Keitel gives the performance of his career and one of the greatest film performances of the past twenty years. He bares his body (marking the first appearence of Harvey Jr.) and soul, unafraid of the material, embarrassing himself for the story. One of the true signs of a great actor is the lack of self-preservation. Few actors would allow themselves to be seen this way, but Keitel lays himself out there without any fear or hesitance. His performance is remarkable in every way. This is a film that is powerful and disturbing and not to be embraced frivolously. It's strength and message will be felt for days after viewing.

Addicted to every street drug of note, heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, which he both snorts and main lines.  He chugalugs vodka.  He neglects his family, his children.  He consorts with prostitutes, two at a time.  He goes to crime scenes to steal the drugs or the money.  He takes bribes and stops young female drivers and shakes them down for sex.He is a Catholic that considers the church a racket.  He is a cop who solves no crimes, who lets the criminals go free if they pay him.  He corrupts not only himself but the entire system of criminal justice.  He is appetite incarnate.But what does him in is his betting on baseball games.  It is the year the Mets came from three games down to win the National League championship, and he bet against the Mets.  With play by play in the background in scene after scene we are reminded forcibly that the outcome of baseball games is one thing he cannot control, something that he cannot corrupt, and perhaps that is why he bets on the games.Abel Ferarra's portrait of a man turbo'ed toward hell is one of the better films I have seen recently.  It is uncompromising in its cynicism.  Keitel's performance is strident and intense, all consuming and depraved.  He is a muscle, an artery that throbs.  He is a man who will never be satisfied, who will never be fulfilled.  His is the very antithesis of the nun who is raped and forgives those who rape her.  She is fulfilled with the love of Jesus.  But he cannot believe--or rather, what is worse, his belief is corrupted.  In the end we see that he does believe in Jesus and the saints but while he cries out that he himself is weak, he blames Jesus.He meets a fitting end, but I must warn you, this is a disturbing movie and one that will offend.",5,Bad is hardly the word for it,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,1887,"['Probably', 'cop', 'ever', 'so', 'low', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'New', 'York', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'very', 'personification', 'corruption', 'hypocrisy', 'Addicted', 'street', 'drug', 'note', 'heroin', 'cocaine', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'snorts', 'main', 'lines', 'vodka', 'family', 'children', 'prostitutes', 'two', 'time', 'crime', 'scenes', 'steal', 'drugs', 'money', 'bribes', 'stops', 'young', 'female', 'drivers', 'shakes', 'down', 'sex.He', 'Catholic', 'church', 'racket', 'cop', 'who', 'crimes', 'who', 'criminals', 'go', 'free', 'pay', 'not', 'only', 'entire', 'system', 'criminal', 'justice', 'appetite', 'incarnate.But', 'what', 'betting', 'baseball', 'games', 'year', 'Mets', 'came', 'three', 'games', 'down', 'win', 'National', 'League', 'championship', 'bet', 'Mets', 'play', 'play', 'background', 'scene', 'scene', 'are', 'reminded', 'forcibly', 'outcome', 'baseball', 'games', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'corrupt', 'perhaps', 'why', 'games.Abel', 'Ferarra', 'portrait', 'man', ""turbo'ed"", 'hell', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'uncompromising', 'cynicism', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'strident', 'intense', 'consuming', 'depraved', 'muscle', 'artery', 'throbs', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'satisfied', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'very', 'antithesis', 'nun', 'who', 'raped', 'forgives', 'who', 'rape', 'fulfilled', 'love', 'Jesus', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'rather', 'what', 'worse', 'belief', 'corrupted', 'end', 'see', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'saints', 'out', 'weak', 'Jesus.He', 'fitting', 'end', 'must', 'warn', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'offend']",N/A

Harvey Keitel gives an incredible, mind-blistering performance in the title role.  This cop is losing himself in a gambling problem and a drug problem.  These 2 problems are brutally and graphically shown on film as they drag this officer into the depths of depravity and degradation.  He steals and abuses his power as a policeman to support his self-destructive habits.  And what he does with those teenage girls who steal their father's car is just oh so wrong!  But it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  As his life deteriorates, he must face a gruesome case involving the rape of a nun.  (This crime is portrayed semi-graphically, and may be a bit much for some to handle)  The cop's faith and self-destruction clash as he faces the solution to this, his hardest case.  Vivid, graphic depictions of all aspects of a dirty cop's life are pictured as his life unravels on camera.  This movie is not for everyone...but it is a stark, raw and brutal portait of a cop in the midst of the deepest inner-turmoil.  Even though I am not a fan of cop movies, I think this is one of my all-time favorite flicks.

One who looks for this will be greatly disappointed. The dialogue and acting are dreadful, the plot filled with such extreme and unreal stereotypes that those who watch films on religious themes, and who think that Richard Burton in Exorcist II was the worst of the lot, may wish to consider turning over that trophy to this cast.Keitel certainly captures the image of a man who is an absolute mess - one unforgettable scene, for example, is when his curses and rage precede his shooting a car radio through his ire over a huge gambling loss. One wonders if he belongs to a police department where even a semblance of sanity is a requirement.The main character, I am sure, was intended to capture passion and conflict. The trouble is that his passion is expressed in nothing beyond constant strings of obscenities. The anguished facial expression which I imagine was intended is a gargoyle grimace, unvarying, which puts one in mind of a character with a perpetual stomach virus (though I suppose heavy drug usage, such as this 'bad cop' displays, can cause such an effect.The nun who should provide the inspiration seems catatonic rather than ethereal - a vowed Stepford wife, or perhaps, with today's technology, a robot. Her words on forgiveness, obviously intended as a powerful contrast with the lieutenant's despair and hatred, are so 'canned' as to make one think one is digesting rations left over from the second world war. Her indifference towards seeing a rapist prosecuted could leave one puzzled as to whether vowed life leaves any room for protecting others from the horrid fate.As the Amazon reviewer quoted, this is a ""Catholic guilt"" film - stereotypical, but without substance.

It's Abel Ferrara's best film, one of Keitel's most powerful, shocking performances, and a film that despite the intensely visceral, borderline sleazy material, manages somehow to be spiritual and transcendent by the end.Keitel is a cop with no name (he's never referred by anything other than Lieutenant) who is corrupt to the bone.  He's a junkie, a gambler, an alcoholic, and hangs out with hookers.  He also ""verbally assaults"" school girls (this is probably the most uncomfortable scene in the film), and doesn't have any moral center.  He's a completely amoral character.  Yet, during an investigation of a brutal, unflinching rape of a nun, he somehow finds his soul again.Abel Ferrara is a wildly uneven filmmaker.  He's made sleazy, borderline Grindhouse movies (Driller Killer and Ms. 45), decent crime dramas (King of New York), underrated films (Dangerous Game), and garbage (Body Snatchers).  Here he surpasses everything else he's done and makes a film that almost reaches Bressonian transcendence at the end, and it's not a mistake.  It's also filmed in the heart of NYC, which gives it a realistic, gritty feel (this was made in 1992, before Giuliani cleaned up the city).  It's also filmed with real street people, meaning when they shoot a scene, the filmmakers didn't close off any streets and let people and traffic unfold naturally like they would on any NYC day.  The film makes haunting use of Forever My Love by Johnny Ace, and the film has one of the best long take endings I've ever seen.

There are, however, some scenes that are just too overdone (the aforementioned religious imagery) and/or pointless and those are the ones that unfortunately stick out.If you want something in a ''Taxi Driver'' or ''I Stand Alone'' vein, it's worth renting or even buying cheap/used...nowhere near as good as those two movies, though.",3,I expected better...,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1009,"['director', 'Drllier', 'Killer', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'starring', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'supposedly', 'shocking', 'raw', '.Eh.It', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'movie', 'se', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'religious', 'aspect', 'accompanying', 'imagery', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'place', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Omen', 'film', '1992', 'off', 'too', 'obvious', 'cheesy', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'so-aggro-it-comes-off-as-funny', 'moments', 'shooting', 'radio', 'etc', 'decent', 'drug', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'guess', 'randomness', 'other', 'characters', 'involved-especially', 'waifish', 'girl', 'junkie-is', 'purpose', 'show', 'how', 'only', 'connections', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'drugs', 'gambling', 'are', 'however', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'overdone', 'aforementioned', 'religious', 'imagery', 'and/or', 'pointless', 'are', 'ones', 'unfortunately', 'stick', 'out.If', 'want', 'something', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'vein', 'worth', 'renting', 'even', 'buying', 'cheap/used', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'movies', 'though']",N/A

Give me a break. Or consider the pretentious rubbish bank rolled by the eminent Mr Gibson. The Passion was it called?  More like really bad art. In my humble atheistic view, BAD LIEUTENANT is perhaps the greatest American film to tackle the difficult subject matter of redemption, forgiveness, and all those things Jesus Christ was on about before the churches got hold of it. Indeed, the nun/victim in the film is being truly christian when she forgives the two boys who raped her.Mr Keitel is hardly off the screen for a minute in the film and provides a brilliant reality to his flawed character - Catholic (lapsed), family man, police officer, who, subject to the lower depths of life through his work, sins.  And he cannot forgive himself, and suffers, and punishes himself.  But he is no hypocrite.  He also has a gambling problem which is a parallel story of falling further into debt to the one of his climb out of hell.  As he gets more in debt he is witness to the New York mets comeback from a three nothing deficit to go on to the World Series - Darryl Strawberry features quite a bit.There are some brilliant scenes - one where he hallucinates at the feet of Christ crying for forgiveness which figure reveals itself to be an elderly  black woman who knows the boys who raped the nun.Leonard Maltin gives this film a two star review and makes some quite smug and superior comments about it.

However instead of showing him doing any actual police work, the movie focuses on scenes where the lead uses drugs and gets deeper in debt to a bookie.

75777,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0784011559,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant is an unflinching portrait of exactly what the title states; a bad cop. The lieutenant is never given a name and we're not given much information about him. We know he lives in a comfortable home with a wife and three children, but we only see him with his children briefly and he's impatient and angry. He drops his kids off and quickly snorts some cocaine. Later, he wakes up on the couch to his children's cartoons. His wife doesn't say anything, his kids don't say anything. We're to assume they're used to this sort of behavior now.Harvey Keitel plays the lieutenant with such unflinching honesty it's rather remarkable. The lieutenant is a drug addict, who's racked up a rather sizeable debt gambling on baseball games. He gives drug dealers amnesty in exchange for drugs; he walks into a store after a robbery, sends the officer away with the storeowner and steals the money from the robbers. There's a scene where he pulls over two young girls and allows them to leave for a couple of ""favors."" Ferrara does not excuse the lieutenant nor make excuses for why he is the way he is...He just shows him. In a stunning scene, a nun is brutally raped. She knows who the assailants were, but refuses to name them. The lieutenant is shocked by this, but at the same time sees an opportunity for redemption.There's no studio gloss here and the low-budget and lack of studio constraint has allowed Ferrara to create a fearless, gritty film about a character with no morality or ethics left. The story isn't incredibly unique, nor is the way it's told...But with the incredible performance by Harvey Keitel it's one of the most brutally honest character studies I've ever seen.Harvey Keitel's performance here should be legendary, as he immerses himself into this role in a way almost no actor of his magnitude would. He bares his soul and body to show a man who has reached the furthest depths of depravity and despair. Even great performances have that winking there, that reassurance that what you're seeing is acting. Keitel never does that; he plays the lieutenant how he is, never attempting to draw sympathy or hatred but leading you to feel the way you wish. The fact that Keitel didn't win an Oscar for this performance makes me question the credibility of the Academy.The film is rated NC-17, but not for the typical sexual reasons. The rating was given based on the drug use in the film, but for a film this challenging it's the most appropriate rating without a doubt. I can't say much about Bad Lieutenant that hasn't already been said, but let it be known...This is a fearless morality play with no hero or villain. It's a challenging film that is disturbing, dark, depressing, and memorable with one of the greatest screen performances I've ever witnessed. It's not for everyone, but this is one of the most powerful films you're likely to see.GRADE: A",5,A Powerful Film With An Amazing Performance by Harvey Keitel,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2894,"['Abel', 'Ferrara', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'unflinching', 'portrait', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'bad', 'cop', 'lieutenant', 'never', 'given', 'name', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'much', 'information', 'know', 'comfortable', 'home', 'wife', 'three', 'children', 'only', 'see', 'children', 'briefly', 'impatient', 'angry', 'kids', 'quickly', 'snorts', 'cocaine', 'Later', 'up', 'couch', 'children', 'cartoons', 'wife', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', ""'re"", 'assume', ""'re"", 'used', 'sort', 'behavior', 'now.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'lieutenant', 'such', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'lieutenant', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'racked', 'up', 'rather', 'sizeable', 'debt', 'gambling', 'baseball', 'games', 'drug', 'dealers', 'amnesty', 'exchange', 'drugs', 'store', 'robbery', 'officer', 'away', 'storeowner', 'money', 'robbers', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'leave', 'couple', 'favors', 'Ferrara', 'not', 'excuse', 'lieutenant', 'make', 'excuses', 'why', 'way', 'just', 'stunning', 'scene', 'nun', 'brutally', 'raped', 'who', 'assailants', 'were', 'name', 'lieutenant', 'shocked', 'same', 'time', 'opportunity', 'redemption.There', 'studio', 'gloss', 'here', 'low-budget', 'lack', 'studio', 'constraint', 'allowed', 'Ferrara', 'create', 'fearless', 'gritty', 'film', 'character', 'morality', 'ethics', 'left', 'story', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'unique', 'way', 'told', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'one', 'most', 'brutally', 'honest', 'character', 'studies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'legendary', 'role', 'way', 'almost', 'actor', 'magnitude', 'would', 'soul', 'body', 'show', 'man', 'who', 'reached', 'furthest', 'depths', 'depravity', 'despair', 'Even', 'great', 'performances', 'have', 'winking', 'there', 'reassurance', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'acting', 'Keitel', 'never', 'lieutenant', 'how', 'never', 'attempting', 'draw', 'sympathy', 'hatred', 'leading', 'feel', 'way', 'wish', 'fact', 'Keitel', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'question', 'credibility', 'Academy.The', 'film', 'rated', 'NC-17', 'not', 'typical', 'sexual', 'reasons', 'rating', 'was', 'given', 'based', 'drug', 'use', 'film', 'film', 'challenging', 'most', 'appropriate', 'rating', 'doubt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'fearless', 'morality', 'play', 'hero', 'villain', 'challenging', 'film', 'disturbing', 'dark', 'depressing', 'memorable', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'not', 'everyone', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see.GRADE']",N/A
75778,A25RN8X70DSZLU,0784011559,JRP,"[0, 2]","Now for my 20 years ago series I'm going to do a review & retrospective of Bad Lieutenant. A movie that's not for everyone & I stress that. I'm sure someone will say you like this movie it's filth yet you hate movies like A Serbian Film. There is a difference between garbage & film making there is a difference between telling a story & making something that is almost a snuff film. The idea for the story came from a r  a  p  e that happened in New York City in 1981. It really shook the city & the director Abel Ferrara had an idea about a cop that is dirty & on the take. 1 of the more conteversal things was that this movie is NC 17 which is why I say it's not for everyone. Today a movie like this would have to be edited & watered down to a PG 13 rating so it could be put in theaters. This is a pretty solid movie & there is a great documentary on The Blu Ray. The movie was made on a budget of $ 1 million made $2 million. Directed by Abel Ferrara this is the only movie of his that I have seen. Stars Harvey Keitel as The Lieutenant, Zoe Lund as Zoe & Frankie Thorn as The Nun. The story is about a dirty cop who works in The Bronx & he's on the take. That should make him unlikeable right yes but how the film is made & the great performance by Harvey Keitel I overlook it cause this character is interesting I don't know why but Keitel made this character interesting. For him it's his way or the highway. He is betting on The Best Of 7 series with The Dodgers & The Mets with his fellow cops. He scores a lot of cocaine off of some drug dealers. He has 3 ways. The song playing in that scene Pleading My Love by Johnny Ace for some odd reason fits. You have this grocery store owner who is being robbed The Lieutenant has this cop take him to the station. The Lieutenant has the robbers give him the money they stole. The message of this movie is still relevant today. You get to the main plot of this movie 2 thugs r  a  pe a Nun so The Lieutenant is investigating it. You have him pull these 2 girls over who have a busted tail light they don't want him to tell their father & they don't have a licence The Lieutenant has them perform some really humilating acts. The Lieutenant has a girlfriend named Zoe who he does drugs with 1 of the more disheartening things the actress Zoe Lund who also helped out with the writing of the script died from an overdose in 1999. Zoe Lund also had a good little quote. ""Vampires are lucky they feed on others . We gotta eat away at ourselves. We gotta eat our legs so we can walk. We gotta come so we can go. We gotta eat away at ourselves till there's nothing left but appetite. We give & we give & we give crazy. Cause a gift that makes sense ain't worth it. Jesus said 70 times 7. No 1 will ever understand why you did it. They'll just forget about you tomorrow. But you gotta do it."" The Lieutenant goes to this night club & is told by 1 of his cop buddies that he owes money on the baseball games that he has bet on & if he doesn't pay up that this guy will come blow his house up with his family in it. The Lieutenant says ""Good, good I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that f  v  c  k  ing house."" The Lieutenant goes & sells evidence to some dealers for $30,000. Now I will get to the finish The Lieutenant tells The Nun who did it to her to tell him who did it & I kill them. She keeps telling him that she has forgiven them. When The Nun leaves she drops a cross necklace The Lieutenant has a break down & it is wonderfully acted. I mean I can't explain it in my retrospective. He is so high he sees Jesus & cries out for forgiveness kisses his feet & it turns out to be an old lady who knows who done it. Those thugs pawned a chalice at her husbands pawn shop. He finds where they are at cuffs them they smoke some crack & watch The Mets win The Pennant. Instead of taking them in he takes them to The Port Authority gives them the box with the $30,000 tells them to never come back to NYC.

He did not win any awards for this role, this damnation, this damned man, a police detective in ""Bad Lieutenant.""There's a song, ""Bad to the Bone,"" which might sum up the detective, or it might not be strong enough because Harvey Keitel's character is bad to the bone and then some. He lives as a family man, but on the edge, clearly not part of this family, a stuffed man, stuffed with aloneness, stuffed with horrors of his own making. Director Abel Ferrara's filming technique extends this isolation by making the movie look like a docudrama. Filmed on location. No takes. Shoot as is. Keep the cameras rolling.He starts the day clean as he drops his two sons off at school. During the course of the day he investigates two vicious murders, a store theft he turns to his advantage by keeping the stolen money, does drugs with a stoned out, emaciated redhead, and engages in a menage-a-trois with two women. During this scene he evens out the equal rights debate for male actors to engage in full frontal nudity. Yes, he does. Then he gets his life-defining case--the vicious rape of a young nun by two local petty drug dealers.Harvey Keitel has spent the day engaged in personal encounters with, well, let's name it, sins of the flesh, of the soul. He sees the nun several times over the next few days, trying to understand what happened to her. When she tells him with her own mouth that she forgives the two men and will not identify them or name them, but only forgives them, he has a major crisis of conscience.One reviewer calls this film a major religious movie, and, indeed, it becomes so. These are scenes to cherish for their truthful beauty, for their naked exposure of a soul in dire peril. Harvey Keitel produces a keening for his soul the like which will make your hair stand on end. The following scenes need to be seen and not read.What transpires resonants with the viewer as the viewer comes to understand the moment's eternal meaning.

Keitel's performance is astonishingly natural and convincing, and his various acts of debasement (whether taking drugs, masturbating in front of two young women he's pulled over for a minor traffic violation, or regressing into infantile chemical-induced behavior while Ferrara's camera stares impassively at the actor's full-frontal nudity) are quite audacious.However, the movie is little more than an endurance test, and after a full hour of watching Keitel take drugs, more drugs and yet MORE drugs, many viewers will want to throw up their hands and cry: ""Enough already! Get to the damn punchline!"" And when that punchline is finally reached - after a long, L-O-N-G trawl through the scuzziest Catholic guilt trip you'll ever see - it hardly seems worth the effort.

75784,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0784011559,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 7]","In this 1992 film Harvey Keitel is cast in the role of a bad cop.  He's a addicted to cocaine, abuses power and is at the bottom of a downward moral decline.  He shows us his weaknesses and bares his soul and we hate the acts he does but also see a tortured man who is out of control in every way.  When another cop is about to arrest some thieves, Keitel sends the other cop away, takes their money and then lets the thieves go.  He gets his payoffs in cocaine from drug dealers.  He uses his police power to force some teenage girls to satisfy his sick needs. And he is constantly drinking to counteract his cocaine high.  It's rather surprising, but not unbelievable, that he still lives with his family and four children but he has long since given up any attempt at reconciling to a middle-class life.  And, to top it off, against the background of the World Series, he is way over his head in gambling debts.Then he is brought into a case where a young nun is brutally violated.  She knows the two men who have committed the terrible act but refuses to name them to the police.  ""I have already forgiven them,"" she says.  This throws Keitel into a moral and spiritual quandary, and how he resolves it might be shocking to some but is understandable, given his character.This is perhaps Harvey Keitel's finest performance.  I felt his humanity in spite of all his nasty acts.  Underneath it all was a very troubled human being.  Wisely, the screenwriter didn't give him a name.  We just think of him as the bad cop.  And also, wisely, we don't get any back story.  I had been actually waiting for it.  I wanted to know the reason that would make a man act this way.  But my curiously was never satisfied.  Instead, I was thrown into the man's current moral dilemma.  The result was a deeply disturbing journey into the depths of depravity and redemption.  I applaud the filmmakers, as well the director Abel Ferrera, who, with the help of Zoe Lund, also wrote the screenplay.  It took a lot of courage to bring this story to the screen.

Well, this movie is all of that and more and I didn't like it at all.Bad Lieutenant isn't an easy movie to watch and not because of the subject matter, which was bad enough, but because it really doesn't have a plot. The story is about a police lieutenant who happens to be . . . bad. In fact, he's so bad, that if the name of the movie had been The Very Bad Lieutenant it wouldn't have been an exaggeration. The Lieutenant (he had no other name in the movie) is bad in the sense that he drinks, drugs, swears, lies, whores, gambles and pretty much anything else he wants to do without misgiving. Or does he? The Lieutenant appears to have another side to him that gave me the impression that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and that it was all contrary to everything he was taught growing up, but because he was in so deep there was nothing he could do (or wanted to do?) about it. Or maybe my impression was just me trying to make some sense of his actions. There was nothing in the movie that gave us any insight into the Lieutenant and truth be told, by the end of the movie, I didn't really care. In fact, if a 40-foot alligator would have crawled up from the sewer and started doing battle with Godzilla, I don't even that would have made me care. The only thing I cared about while watching Bad Lieutenant was the little counter on the DVD player as it worked it's way closer and closer to 90-whatever minutes. What little plot there was involved a disturbing sex crime and the Lieutenant trying to solve the crime. The Lieutenant's motive is anyone's guess because the movie offered no real insight into the character and/or how he got where he was in life. We can make some guesses, but that's about it.Harvey Keitel is very good in the movie and it's his performance alone that saves Bad Lieutenant and makes the movie worth watching, but only if you're a Harvey Keitel fan. Bad Lieutenant also had some nice scenes of New York and there was a baseball subplot that I enjoyed.I wouldn't recommend Bad Lieutenant anyone other than the absolute Harvey Keitel fan.",1,Not an easy movie to watch,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2188,"['Do', 'Havey', 'Keitel', 'Yeah', 'too', 'How', 'gritty', 'detective', 'stories', 'Same', 'here', 'Dramas', 'know', 'so', 'do', 'Well', 'movie', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'all.Bad', 'Lieutenant', ""n't"", 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'plot', 'story', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'be', 'bad', 'fact', 'so', 'bad', 'name', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'exaggeration', 'Lieutenant', 'had', 'other', 'name', 'movie', 'bad', 'sense', 'drugs', 'swears', 'lies', 'whores', 'gambles', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'misgiving', 'Lieutenant', 'have', 'side', 'gave', 'impression', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'contrary', 'everything', 'was', 'taught', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'deep', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'do', 'wanted', 'do', 'maybe', 'impression', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'actions', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'gave', 'insight', 'Lieutenant', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'end', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'fact', '40-foot', 'alligator', 'would', 'have', 'crawled', 'up', 'sewer', 'started', 'doing', 'battle', 'Godzilla', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'care', 'only', 'thing', 'cared', 'watching', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'little', 'counter', 'DVD', 'player', 'worked', 'way', 'closer', 'closer', '90-whatever', 'minutes', 'What', 'little', 'plot', 'was', 'involved', 'disturbing', 'sex', 'crime', 'Lieutenant', 'trying', 'solve', 'crime', 'Lieutenant', 'motive', 'anyone', 'guess', 'movie', 'offered', 'real', 'insight', 'character', 'and/or', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'was', 'life', 'can', 'make', 'guesses', 'it.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'performance', 'alone', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', ""'re"", 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'fan', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'also', 'had', 'nice', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'baseball', 'subplot', 'enjoyed.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'anyone', 'other', 'absolute', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'fan']",N/A

75793,A2Z3Q7JS89QP9J,0784011559,olofpalme63,"[5, 5]","One thing is certain as far as the reviewers at Amazon.com are concerned. You either love or hate this movie. There really is no happy medium. The problem here is; it's loved or hated for all the wrong reasons. What most reviewers forget is, this is a character study of a really bad police officer. Not an ""action/adventure"" film with explosions and car chases. The three areas of concern for most of the reviewers are Harvey Keitel's full-frontal nudity, the Nun rape scene and religious aspect of the film.  These are just my theories concerning these particular segments so I apologize if I offend any of you. Only, I thought most of the reviewers at Amazon.com over-analyzed the ""rape"" scene and Keitel's ""full-frontal"" nude scene and used both sequences as the foundation for their critical reviews of the film. Totally missing the point of both scenes. I don't believe Abel Ferrara used Keitel's full-frontal nude scene for ""shock value"". I believe it was put there to emphasize (exposed in the purest sense) just what an out-of-control drunken, drug addict he really was. I know, I know...you'll argue that Keitel's jerking-off on the side of a car while forcing two girls to watch would have sufficed or, snorting a line of cocaine off the family photo...only...again, this was a character study of a really bad cop.As for the infamous Nun ""rape"" scene, the reviewers at Amazon.com...right along with Jimmy Page and Robert Plant missed the whole point entirely. Although no fault of their own, however...the scene makes more sense if you've seen it before Schooly D's ""Kashmir"" riff was edited out. Page & Plant demanded the video (when it was first released in VHS format) be yanked from the shelves when they learned that a sample of their song was being used as the background score of a Nun being raped. Considering the historical significance of it...Kashmir being a (sacred) region that was conquered and destroyed (essentially ""raped"") by emperor Akbar and his band of thugs during the late 1500's. The Catholic church being conquered and destroyed (the Nun raped) by two thugs. I believe the scene loses some of its impact and meaning without Schooly D's (Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"") sample. I've never seen the film on the ""Independent Film Channel"" (just the theatrical and original VHS version) ...however, I can only assume most reviewers have only seen the edited version as most VHS copies were destroyed and the DVD score was re-done without Schooly D's (""Signifying Rapper"") riff. Ironic that Page & Plant would later allow some hack like Puffdaddy to sample ""Kashmir"" for a cheesy re-make of ""Godzilla"", while ignoring the historical significance of their own material. But that's what greed will do.Concerning the religious aspect of the film, one reviewer made the suggestion that you watch the film with your children.  This isn't a film to sit your children in front of, and deserved the NC-17 rating it received. I've read alot of reviews at Amazon.com concerning this film and the references to Christ, the church, Christianity and religion in general. Only...it really has nothing to do with religion at all (if taken in the same spirit as say; ""The Last Temptation Of Christ""). Keitel's character exploits the church as a means of trying to solve the case. The day after the crime occurs he states that; ""the church is a racket...I'm Catholic"", indicating very early on that he doesn't really care at all that the Nun got raped. It was all about trying to solve the crime as soon as possible to collect the reward money that the church put up so he could pay off his bookie. His revelation with Christ only occurs when he's at the end of his rope...like a coward backed into a corner. He has no shred of moral integrity what-so-ever, and reaffirms it (as if he needed to) in the end when he lets the guys that raped the Nun go. I agree that this is a 5 star movie...but find it quite ironic that most reviewers at Amazon.com give it five stars for all wrong reasons. Keitel's character is a scum bag throughout...and deserved the bullet he received in the end. As for the negative reviews, I believe most reviewers waited an hour and a half for some special effects (something their accustomed to when they watch a movie), and when nothing exploded...they felt ripped off.olofpalme63",5,The Amazon.com Debate,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,4315,"['One', 'thing', 'certain', 'as', 'far', 'reviewers', 'Amazon.com', 'are', 'concerned', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'really', 'happy', 'medium', 'problem', 'here', 'loved', 'hated', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'What', 'most', 'reviewers', 'forget', 'character', 'study', 'really', 'bad', 'police', 'officer', 'Not', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'three', 'areas', 'concern', 'most', 'reviewers', 'are', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'Nun', 'rape', 'scene', 'religious', 'aspect', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'theories', 'concerning', 'particular', 'segments', 'apologize', 'offend', 'Only', 'thought', 'most', 'reviewers', 'Amazon.com', 'over-analyzed', 'rape', 'scene', 'Keitel', 'full-frontal', 'nude', 'scene', 'used', 'sequences', 'foundation', 'critical', 'reviews', 'film', 'Totally', 'missing', 'point', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'used', 'Keitel', 'full-frontal', 'nude', 'scene', 'shock', 'value', 'believe', 'was', 'put', 'there', 'emphasize', 'exposed', 'purest', 'sense', 'just', 'what', 'out-of-control', 'drunken', 'drug', 'addict', 'really', 'was', 'know', 'know', ""'ll"", 'argue', 'Keitel', 'jerking-off', 'side', 'car', 'forcing', 'two', 'girls', 'watch', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'snorting', 'line', 'cocaine', 'family', 'photo', 'only', 'again', 'was', 'character', 'study', 'really', 'bad', 'cop.As', 'infamous', 'Nun', 'rape', 'scene', 'reviewers', 'Amazon.com', 'right', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'missed', 'whole', 'point', 'entirely', 'fault', 'own', 'however', 'scene', 'more', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Schooly', 'D', 'Kashmir', 'riff', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'Page', 'Plant', 'demanded', 'video', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'VHS', 'format', 'be', 'yanked', 'shelves', 'when', 'learned', 'sample', 'song', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'background', 'score', 'Nun', 'being', 'raped', 'Considering', 'historical', 'significance', 'Kashmir', 'being', 'sacred', 'region', 'was', 'conquered', 'destroyed', 'essentially', 'raped', 'emperor', 'Akbar', 'band', 'thugs', 'late', '1500', 'Catholic', 'church', 'being', 'conquered', 'destroyed', 'Nun', 'raped', 'two', 'thugs', 'believe', 'scene', 'impact', 'meaning', 'Schooly', 'D', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Kashmir', 'sample', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'just', 'theatrical', 'original', 'VHS', 'version', 'however', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'edited', 'version', 'most', 'VHS', 'copies', 'were', 'destroyed', 'DVD', 'score', 'was', 're-done', 'Schooly', 'D', 'Signifying', 'Rapper', 'riff', 'Ironic', 'Page', 'Plant', 'would', 'later', 'allow', 'hack', 'Puffdaddy', 'sample', 'Kashmir', 'cheesy', 're-make', 'Godzilla', 'ignoring', 'historical', 'significance', 'own', 'material', 'what', 'greed', 'will', 'do.Concerning', 'religious', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'reviewer', 'made', 'suggestion', 'watch', 'film', 'children', ""n't"", 'film', 'sit', 'children', 'front', 'deserved', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'received', ""'ve"", 'read', 'alot', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'concerning', 'film', 'references', 'Christ', 'church', 'Christianity', 'religion', 'general', 'Only', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'religion', 'taken', 'same', 'spirit', 'say', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'Keitel', 'character', 'church', 'means', 'trying', 'solve', 'case', 'day', 'crime', 'church', 'racket', ""'m"", 'Catholic', 'indicating', 'very', 'early', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Nun', 'got', 'raped', 'was', 'trying', 'solve', 'crime', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'collect', 'reward', 'money', 'church', 'put', 'up', 'so', 'could', 'pay', 'off', 'bookie', 'revelation', 'Christ', 'only', 'when', 'end', 'rope', 'coward', 'backed', 'corner', 'shred', 'moral', 'integrity', 'what-so-ever', 'needed', 'end', 'when', 'guys', 'raped', 'Nun', 'go', 'agree', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'find', 'quite', 'ironic', 'most', 'reviewers', 'Amazon.com', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Keitel', 'character', 'scum', 'bag', 'deserved', 'bullet', 'received', 'end', 'negative', 'reviews', 'believe', 'most', 'reviewers', 'waited', 'hour', 'half', 'special', 'effects', 'something', 'accustomed', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'nothing', 'exploded', 'felt', 'ripped', 'off.olofpalme63']",N/A

You have not seen anything like it before nor will you ever again. It is a role he was born to play and a role he will be remembered for. No, Keitel will not be remembered for his part in Reservoir Dogs or Taxi Driver... he will be recalled as that Brooklyn cop on the edge of a bottomless pit of insanity in Bad Lieutenant.Ferrara has somehow managed to make a film that is so shocking and twisted and yet at the same time a powerhouse of moral values that it ascends its exploitation material by the time the closing credits begin to roll. From the opening scene Keitel is out and about involving himself in every kind of debauchery from an assortment of drugs and alcohol to performing himself in front of a very scared group of teens that he has just pulled over in their ""borrowed"" car for having a broken taillight. In another scene he visits the location of a crime and does little more than just look at the victim's breasts. As pounds of crack cocaine fall from under his vest in front of his fellow detectives, Keitel is on a losing streak from start to finish. When coupled with his exhausting gambling debt that triples with every baseball fixture that fails him you know that it just can not get much worse... but somehow Ferrara manages to do just that and the many levels Keitel falls too are beyond imagination.The premise is horrific. As a crooked cop he must investigate the case of a raped nun who refuses to tell the police about her violent, and graphic, assault or to identify the perpetrators. She says that she forgives them but Keitel can not connect with this or understand it. He looses sleep over it and continues on his personal decent into hell. As his world is torn about him - a self-inflicted venture with no one else to blame for it but himself - Keitel can only find a last glimmer of hope in the resolve of the nun's case.This is cinema at its most harrowing and psychological. You can not fault Keitel's performance here for a moment. This is the kind of film that you do not feel good about watching but you are damn glad that you did.

75799,A3UA40JOD3BE1M,0784011559,"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!""","[95, 103]","I had heard, by word of mouth over the years, that ""Bad Lieutenant"" was truly extraordinary, but nothing could really prepare me for the sheer visceral impact of the film, or the electrifying, career best performance, given by Harvey Keitel, in fact I watched the film 3 days ago, and have deliberately waited `til now to write this review.After much thought I have to say that ""Bad Lieutenant"" really is a monstrous train-wreck of a movie, but what keeps you watching, utterly mesmerized, unable to look away for an instant, is Keitel's performance as the titular character. He's never given a name in the film, or even in the credits, he's just the ""Lieutenant,"" and ""Bad?"" ""Bad"" doesn't even begin to describe this guy, as the front of the DVD case puts it, ""Gambler. Thief. Junkie. Killer. Cop.""After surviving on the mean streets of New York for 20 years, he has seen, and pretty well done, it all; the ""Lieutenant"" is a man who exists in a nihilistic Hell of his own making, and we watch as he roars headlong towards his own destruction, along the way, plumbing the very depths of abject human depravity.A lapsed Catholic, he is still wracked by guilt for the truly awful deeds he commits, whether it's doing and/or selling drugs, booze, sex, gambling, thieving, killing, the ""Lieutenant"" is a soul in torment. Unable to find a way out, he is sinking deeper and deeper into a morass of yet MORE drugs, MORE booze, MORE bets he can't cover, and more, meaningless, cold, emotionless, and depraved, sexual acts.Yet somewhere deep inside this blasted shell of a man, there still exists a spark of humanity, so lost in the wretched, savage squalor of his life, that even HE doesn't know it's there. Then one day he becomes involved in the investigation of a crime that shocks even him... the brutal rape of a Catholic nun. Initially coldly dismissive of what the young woman had been through, he listens in on her conversations with her superiors and is shocked to his core to discover that even though her bruises are still fresh, she has already forgiven her attackers. She knows their names but won't pass them on to the police.The ""Lieutenant"" can barely comprehend how can such a thing can be, how can she forgive such a terrible act... such a terrible sin? If she can forgive so much, then maybe, just maybe, he himself can find some kind of redemption, maybe someone - God? - can forgive him HIS sins. After his confrontation with the nun, howling out his characters pain, and anger, and hurt, and fear, Harvey Keitel gives the most searingly honest, desperate, and emotionally raw performance of his career.Bleak, brutal, depraved, and honest, are some of the words that I would use to describe this film, which is NOT easy to watch, especially this NC-17 version, but it's a film that SHOULD be watched by anyone who is serious about Cinema as an art form. Between them, Ferrera and Keitel have produced an extraordinary cinematic experience, unbending and uncompromising in its exploration of the human condition, powerful and unforgiving, it forces you to actually THINK about the subject matter, and to face the rotten darkness in the heart of this particular human soul.I would like to end this review with a bit of trivia concerning Keitel's performance. Regardless of whether you love this film or hate it - like ""2001,"" this film seems to generate extreme reactions - no one can argue about the power, and sheer gut-wrenching truthfulness, of Keitel's performance. Depending on exactly when the film was released, Keitel would have been eligible for a shot at either the '92 or '93 Oscar for Best Actor. So who won? Well, I looked it up, and Keitel ""lost"" to, either, Al Pacino in ""Scent of a Woman"" in '92, or, God help us, Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" in '93! Next time I find myself getting even mildly curious about who's taking home one of the gold statuettes, this little bit of trivia will kind-of put the whole tawdry circus into perspective!",5,How can you forgive that...,1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,3966,"['had', 'heard', 'word', 'mouth', 'years', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'nothing', 'could', 'really', 'prepare', 'sheer', 'visceral', 'impact', 'film', 'electrifying', 'career', 'best', 'performance', 'given', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'fact', 'watched', 'film', '3', 'days', 'ago', 'have', 'deliberately', 'waited', 'til', 'now', 'write', 'review.After', 'much', 'thought', 'have', 'say', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'really', 'monstrous', 'train-wreck', 'movie', 'what', 'watching', 'utterly', 'mesmerized', 'unable', 'look', 'away', 'instant', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'titular', 'character', 'never', 'given', 'name', 'film', 'even', 'credits', 'just', 'Lieutenant', 'Bad', 'Bad', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'guy', 'front', 'DVD', 'case', 'Gambler', 'Thief', 'Junkie', 'Killer', 'Cop', 'surviving', 'mean', 'streets', 'New', 'York', '20', 'years', 'seen', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'Lieutenant', 'man', 'who', 'nihilistic', 'Hell', 'own', 'making', 'watch', 'headlong', 'towards', 'own', 'destruction', 'way', 'plumbing', 'very', 'depths', 'abject', 'human', 'depravity.A', 'lapsed', 'Catholic', 'still', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'truly', 'awful', 'deeds', 'doing', 'and/or', 'selling', 'drugs', 'booze', 'sex', 'gambling', 'thieving', 'killing', 'Lieutenant', 'soul', 'torment', 'Unable', 'find', 'way', 'sinking', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'morass', 'yet', 'MORE', 'drugs', 'MORE', 'booze', 'MORE', 'bets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'more', 'meaningless', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'depraved', 'sexual', 'acts.Yet', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'blasted', 'shell', 'man', 'still', 'spark', 'humanity', 'so', 'lost', 'wretched', 'savage', 'squalor', 'life', 'even', 'HE', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'involved', 'investigation', 'crime', 'even', 'brutal', 'rape', 'Catholic', 'nun', 'Initially', 'coldly', 'dismissive', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'been', 'conversations', 'superiors', 'shocked', 'core', 'discover', 'even', 'bruises', 'are', 'still', 'fresh', 'already', 'forgiven', 'attackers', 'names', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pass', 'police.The', 'Lieutenant', 'can', 'barely', 'comprehend', 'how', 'can', 'such', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'can', 'forgive', 'such', 'terrible', 'act', 'terrible', 'sin', 'can', 'forgive', 'so', 'much', 'then', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'can', 'find', 'kind', 'redemption', 'maybe', 'someone', 'God', 'can', 'forgive', 'HIS', 'sins', 'confrontation', 'nun', 'howling', 'out', 'characters', 'pain', 'anger', 'hurt', 'fear', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'most', 'searingly', 'honest', 'desperate', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'performance', 'career.Bleak', 'brutal', 'depraved', 'honest', 'are', 'words', 'would', 'use', 'describe', 'film', 'NOT', 'easy', 'watch', 'especially', 'NC-17', 'version', 'film', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'watched', 'anyone', 'who', 'serious', 'about', 'Cinema', 'art', 'form', 'Between', 'Ferrera', 'Keitel', 'have', 'produced', 'extraordinary', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'unbending', 'uncompromising', 'exploration', 'human', 'condition', 'powerful', 'unforgiving', 'actually', 'THINK', 'subject', 'matter', 'face', 'rotten', 'darkness', 'heart', 'particular', 'human', 'soul.I', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'review', 'bit', 'trivia', 'concerning', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'Regardless', 'love', 'film', 'hate', '2001', 'film', 'generate', 'extreme', 'reactions', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'power', 'sheer', 'gut-wrenching', 'truthfulness', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'Depending', 'exactly', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Keitel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'eligible', 'shot', ""'92"", 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'So', 'who', 'won', 'Well', 'looked', 'up', 'Keitel', 'lost', 'either', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Scent', 'Woman', ""'92"", 'God', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Philadelphia', ""'93"", 'Next', 'time', 'find', 'getting', 'even', 'mildly', 'curious', 'who', 'taking', 'home', 'one', 'gold', 'little', 'bit', 'trivia', 'will', 'kind-of', 'whole', 'tawdry', 'circus', 'perspective']",N/A

And in the middle of all of it, there is Bad Lieutenant, which to date stands alone as Ferrara's magnum opus, an incredibly powerful piece of workThe unnamed lieutenant (called ""LT"" in the credits and played to the hilt by Harvey Keitel) starts off the movie looking like any other guy, but it only takes a few minutes of us looking in on his day to realize this isn't your ordinary cop. In fact, he's a downright sleaze. Soon enough, he catches the case that will end up becoming the focus of his career-- the rape of a young nun (Stigmata's Frankie Thorn). At first, he tries to treat it like every other case, but as his life begins to spiral out of control, he becomes more and more obsessed with the deeper symbolism of the case itself, how justice and forgiveness are two sides of the same coin.The case is there, but it's only as important to the film as the mythical Mets-Dodgers NL playoff constantly on radios and televisions (obviously meant to mirror the '88 NL playoffs, but the movie's playoffs differ in certain important ways to parallel better with the plot structure)-- both are only pieces of the puzzle that is the lieutenant. The movie is Harvey Keitel's, pure and simple, a character study of a man whose bad habits have finally caught up with him And Keitel plays it wonderfully. He is the reason to watch this movie. And even if he is the only reason (let's be frank, this is not a film for the squeamish, as many reviews and viewer comments have made clear; it's NC-17 for a reason), he's still worth it.

The movies starts with him dropping his sons off at school, then snorting coke in the school parking lot before beginning his day.  The storyline is a basically loose, as far as plot, the film consists mostly of scenes of the lieutenant's degeneration.  The major plot of the movie is a new crime he's assigned to; the destruction of a catholic church along with the raping of one of the nuns. (Warning - the scene is graphic)  Most of the movie is taken up by highlighting the horrible habits of the nameless lieutenant.He drinks, he smokes, he snorts cocaine, he smokes and shoots heroin, he gambles, he steals drugs from police evidence, he takes money from thieves and lets them go, he sexually harasses young girls he pulls over (another graphic scene) he gets involved in threesomes (Warning: there's a full frontal shot of Harvey Keitel that is not only unnecessary but quite disgusting - Please Harvey - it's not worth showing - put it away and keep it there) and he treats everyone, even his family, with contempt.The nun case haunts him; she refuses to identify the men who raped her even while admitting she knows who they are.  Even with all of the lieutenant's pleading she says she's forgiven them and refuses to divulge their names.  The lieutenant simply cannot understand her forgiveness, and it sends him into an even deeper spiral trying to understand her.  It's obvious that he's fighting with his own Catholic upbringing and rejection of his faith.Our nameless lead character has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Long scenes are spent on his debauchery and perversions.  His breakdown in the church where he finds himself wailing and pleading with a hallucination of Christ is almost, but not quite, touching.  His is the bottom rung of life, the deepest of rock bottom, and the movie is very depressing for it.  The ending is a little surprising.  Don't expect a great movie, the photography isn't very high quality, but Keitel does a great job of acting.  This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, and again I must warn against the graphic nature of the film, both sexually and drug related.  Still, it's worth a peek if your in the mood.

75809,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0784011559,trebe,"[0, 0]","Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs,Mean Streets) gives a powerful and emotional performance as a corrupt New York City police detective in Bad Lieutenant (1992), a movie that seems to have few ties to reality.  The narrative proceeds down some dark paths, seemingly flowing along without very much direction, and takes a really strange turn, before arriving at a predictable conclusion.  Director Abel Ferra's film, paints a twisted picture of a morally degenerated cop, who faces various personal crises.  Some spoilers follow.The Lieutenant (Keitel) is a police detective who spends much of his time doing coke, betting on baseball games, and using his position as a cop, to line his pockets, and deal drugs.  A Catholic, he has a wife and children, but regularly engages in cocaine binges with various women.The Mets are taking on the Dodgers in the NLCS, and trailing 3-0 are on the brink of elimination.  The Lieutenant keeps betting on the Dodgers, but as the Mets continue to win, he eventually finds himself owing $60,000 to bookmakers.  Convinced his luck will turn, he tries to bet $120,000 on the decisive seventh game.The Lieutenant operates alone, and rarely seems to work on any cases, until he gets involved in the investigation of the brutal rape of a nun (Frankie Thorn), who having forgiven her attackers, declines to help in the investigation.  The Lieutenant still manages to track down the perpetrators, but experiences a moral crisis that has him swearing at a vision of Christ, and leads him to do something quite strange.Bad Lieutenant is an impactful, though not a very pleasant experience.  Keitel's over the top performance is compelling, as a man whose life seems to be on a steady downward slide.  The story could do with some tightening up, as sum total of the various incidents, does not make for a very cogent story, as the tormented cop eventually confronts his personal demons.There isn't that much action or violence, but the excessive drug use helped earn the film an NC-17 rating, however the Amazon Instant Video version is an R rated cut.  Zoe Lund (Ms. 45), who co-wrote the screenplay, and appears in the film as one of the Lieutenant's coke snorting partners, ironically died from heart failure in 1999, due to her use of cocaine.  The AIV version is good, but for the full effect, the NC-17 version of this 3.5 star film would be recommended.",4,"betting on baseball, and doing coke...",1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2380,"['Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'performance', 'corrupt', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'detective', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', '1992', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'ties', 'reality', 'narrative', 'proceeds', 'down', 'dark', 'paths', 'seemingly', 'flowing', 'along', 'very', 'much', 'direction', 'really', 'strange', 'turn', 'arriving', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'Director', 'Abel', 'Ferra', 'film', 'twisted', 'picture', 'morally', 'degenerated', 'cop', 'who', 'various', 'personal', 'crises', 'spoilers', 'follow.The', 'Lieutenant', 'Keitel', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'doing', 'coke', 'betting', 'baseball', 'games', 'using', 'position', 'cop', 'line', 'pockets', 'deal', 'drugs', 'Catholic', 'wife', 'children', 'regularly', 'engages', 'cocaine', 'binges', 'various', 'women.The', 'Mets', 'are', 'taking', 'Dodgers', 'NLCS', 'trailing', '3-0', 'are', 'brink', 'elimination', 'Lieutenant', 'keeps', 'betting', 'Dodgers', 'Mets', 'continue', 'win', 'eventually', 'owing', '60,000', 'bookmakers', 'Convinced', 'luck', 'will', 'turn', 'bet', '120,000', 'decisive', 'seventh', 'game.The', 'Lieutenant', 'alone', 'rarely', 'work', 'cases', 'involved', 'investigation', 'brutal', 'rape', 'nun', 'Frankie', 'Thorn', 'who', 'having', 'forgiven', 'attackers', 'declines', 'help', 'investigation', 'Lieutenant', 'still', 'track', 'down', 'perpetrators', 'moral', 'crisis', 'swearing', 'vision', 'Christ', 'do', 'something', 'quite', 'strange.Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'impactful', 'not', 'very', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'Keitel', 'top', 'performance', 'compelling', 'man', 'life', 'be', 'steady', 'downward', 'slide', 'story', 'could', 'do', 'tightening', 'up', 'sum', 'total', 'various', 'incidents', 'not', 'make', 'very', 'cogent', 'story', 'tormented', 'cop', 'eventually', 'personal', 'demons.There', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'action', 'violence', 'excessive', 'drug', 'use', 'helped', 'earn', 'film', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'however', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'version', 'R', 'rated', 'cut', 'Zoe', 'Lund', 'Ms.', '45', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'one', 'Lieutenant', 'coke', 'snorting', 'partners', 'ironically', 'died', 'heart', 'failure', '1999', 'due', 'use', 'cocaine', 'AIV', 'version', 'good', 'full', 'effect', 'NC-17', 'version', '3.5', 'star', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'recommended']",N/A
75810,A26UW8DNN74AGK,0784011559,"""unhelpful""","[2, 9]","If Abel Ferrara had chosen to omit the glaringly inconsistent scene in  which the bad cop puts the nun's rapists on a bus rather than run them in,  only to have him sit and wait for his own execution, Bad Lieutenant would  have been merely an obscene foray into the life of a spaced-out, brutal man  intent on his own destruction.  That ultimate destruction seems to take  forever.  Ferrara's Catholicism is a tad overly-literal.  In fact, his  chosen ending is as arbitrary and as ludicrous as the one chosen by Paul  Schrader (another Bresson admirer) for Richard Gere in American Gigolo.  What Bad Lieutenant makes glaringly obvious is the fact that a Christian  message cannot be found just anyhere.  It has to be earned in the  dramaturgy, in the very texture of the film.  Redemption is not simply a  matter of doing one lousy good deed (setting a pair of rapists free?) and  then committing tacit suicide.  And Harvey Keitel, capable of occasional  power, is merely foul-smelling in this role.  And yet, it is so often  praised as some kind of a masterpiece and Ferrara as a sort of genius.

It is a dark, disgusting, cynical view of humanity with virtually no redeeming qualities.  The characters are repulsive, the violence gratuitous, and the story - non-existent.  It is a series of violent scenes which make one question why the movie was even made.  It is not commercial. It is not artistic.  It is simply grotesque, depressing, and painful to watch.  I wanted to turn it off several times, but forced myself to watch until the ending, all the while hoping for some redeeming quality, or for an uptick in the movie.  I watched with several others, who felt the same way.  We picked this for a group of guys as an &#34;action flick&#34; from two decades ago that we had hoped would be a &#34;classic find&#34;, and we were all disappointed that we wasted 90 minutes.  Don't waste your time - this is Hollywood at its worst.  And as a group, we generally like most movies and can find some redeemable aspects to most films.  For this one, it is 90 minutes of wasting your life.  It make the viewer wonder - why was this movie ever made?",1,Depressing and Unrealistic.

Ucar Conte ""No Hay Dia""","[2, 3]","As tough as any review might seem, behind this trainwreck of a movie lies one of the most important pieces of work in bravado film history. Often compared with Taxi driver, Abel Ferrara 1992 effort is a disturbing hell of a ride from title to end credits. I consider myself lucky for having the stomach, the patience and the strengh to watch it repeatedly and still being able to absorb it without passing out with the high ammount of ultra disturbing material this film dares to offer...and I still enjoy it very much. Drugs, death, addiction...good lord...you should be asking yourself... why should I watch a piece of junk like this? this is no junk at all, this is a lesson too important! This film is strong, powerful, realistic, impressive, daring and bold in every aspect, and it does have the power to disturb and shock hundreds of thousands of viewers...and I believe that's a beauty! This is a film where no one's innocent, everyone is evil and redemption is the only cure. I hate doing reviews cuz films should speak for themselves, but all I have to say is that Harvey Keitel's bold self destructive and out of this world performance should be considered as the most viceral, dramatic, original and impressive charaterization of the 90's. This is his best performence ever!!! This guy showed the world that he can play anything you throw at him, no matter how difficult or dihumanizing it might be, he's the guy to pull it off brilliantly!. I can keep on writing for hours and hours about his impressive and jawbraking job on this movie but I wont...all I have to say is that if it wasn't for him, Bad Lieutenat wouldn't have 90% of its raw power...this guy is a class A actor all the way. And this also makes Abel Ferrara one of the most amazing directors alive...this movie is incredible!Be prepared for this highgly recommended film that should go down in history as the most viceral and daring film of the 90's.
