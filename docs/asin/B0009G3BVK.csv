It became too hard to follow or to make sense.  So, noir wise, the darkness blotted out the meaning.  I started to give it a three because the acting was good.  However, it left me with such a feeling of worse than hollow, I gave it a two.",2,Mystery dementia,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,404,"['noir', 'bit', 'story', 'started', 'out', 'having', 'plot', 'possibility', 'dissolved', 'something', 'incognito', 'confusion', 'alcoholic', 'haze', 'brain', 'disintegration', 'became', 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'make', 'sense', 'So', 'noir', 'wise', 'darkness', 'blotted', 'out', 'meaning', 'started', 'give', 'three', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'However', 'left', 'feeling', 'worse', 'hollow', 'gave', 'two']",The Premonition

When I saw that Mr. Lynch died, I had to revist and find out the  name of the flick. I must say that if you are NOT afraid of clowns you will be after you see this movie.  He was so scary and gross--I thought that was make up but I find out today that he was actually scarred after setting himself on fire during an LSD trip in the 60's.  I only give it three stars because it was so repulsive to me.  He was like a extra twisted pedophile (all pedophiles are twisted but he took it to a really slimy sleazy level--nothing charismatic or friendly about him! Not a seemingly friendly Gacy type or a handsome Ted Bundy, and before you say Bundy was not a pedophile, he raped and killed a pre-teen!) But I digress, that is the way it seemed to me, rather it was intentional or not. So it grossed me out.  BUT the film was very suspenseful and as I recall well acted (I could never watch it again)and probably someone who has a stronger constitution  could watch it and even enjoy it to the degree that such films are enjoyable.",3,RIP Mr Lynch,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,1083,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'back', 'old', 'days', 'When', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Lynch', 'died', 'had', 'revist', 'find', 'out', 'name', 'flick', 'must', 'say', 'are', 'NOT', 'clowns', 'will', 'be', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'scary', 'gross', 'thought', 'was', 'make', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'today', 'was', 'actually', 'scarred', 'setting', 'fire', 'LSD', 'trip', '60', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'so', 'repulsive', 'was', 'extra', 'twisted', 'pedophile', 'pedophiles', 'are', 'twisted', 'took', 'really', 'slimy', 'sleazy', 'level', 'nothing', 'charismatic', 'friendly', 'Not', 'seemingly', 'friendly', 'Gacy', 'type', 'handsome', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'say', 'Bundy', 'was', 'not', 'pedophile', 'raped', 'killed', 'pre-teen', 'digress', 'way', 'seemed', 'rather', 'was', 'intentional', 'not', 'grossed', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'recall', 'well', 'acted', 'could', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'probably', 'someone', 'who', 'stronger', 'constitution', 'could', 'watch', 'even', 'enjoy', 'degree', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'enjoyable']",The Premonition
905131,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0009G3BVK,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[5, 5]","Mysteria is a weird noir film that was a bit hard to follow. Danny Glover plays a police detective and the story is told as a flashback as Glover investigates a murder. Robert Miano plays a washed up Hollywood script writer who spends his time drinking and living in a cheap hotel. He has a deadline to meet on a screenplay, has used up all of his advances, hasn't started writing, and the rent is due. A young college girl named Lavina (Meadow Williams) takes an interest in his writing, and becomes the only person he can trust with his script.While in a drunken stupor, a strange woman with a hollow here-after voice appears to him in a deserted bar and tells him to write about what happens to him, that it would become a great script. There is also a senator(Peter Mark Richman) involved who wants the script.The acting was good, but the ending didn't give me closure as I must not of been paying close attention during the film trying to assess the details. I was as confused at the end as I was at the beginning. If you like confusing noir dramas with not much action, check it out.No sex or nudity.",3,CONFUSED BY ENDING,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1106,"['Mysteria', 'weird', 'noir', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'police', 'detective', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Glover', 'murder', 'Robert', 'Miano', 'washed', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'writer', 'who', 'time', 'drinking', 'living', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'deadline', 'meet', 'screenplay', 'used', 'up', 'advances', ""n't"", 'started', 'writing', 'rent', 'due', 'young', 'college', 'girl', 'named', 'Lavina', 'Meadow', 'Williams', 'interest', 'writing', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'trust', 'script.While', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'strange', 'woman', 'hollow', 'here-after', 'voice', 'deserted', 'bar', 'write', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'great', 'script', 'also', 'senator', 'Peter', 'Mark', 'Richman', 'involved', 'who', 'script.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'closure', 'must', 'not', 'been', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'film', 'trying', 'assess', 'details', 'was', 'confused', 'end', 'was', 'beginning', 'like', 'confusing', 'noir', 'dramas', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'check', 'out.No', 'sex', 'nudity']",The Premonition

The Premonition is definitely one of the better of the bunch, and might have been totally forgotten were it not for the handful of us that remember fondly from it's ""Late Show"" airings.Director, Robert Allen Schnitzer orchestrated a highly atmospheric and offbeat little horror-oddity, on a meager budget, and amidst some decidedly no-frills locations. Though a little rough around the edges at times, The Premonition delivers the same eerie, sustained mood of a film like ""Don't Look Now"", but with a fraction of the resources. I think most fans of obscure, 70's horror with a somewhat ""artistic"" flair will find this one pretty enjoyable.This Media Blasters DVD looks and sounds good; or I should say about as good as low-budget 70's film that was probably shot on fast, grainy film stock is going to look.  It's also probably the only release this film is going to see, so if it intrigues you at all, I'd snap it up before it goes out of print.",4,Works for me,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1107,"['Psychic', 'phenomena', 'ESP', 'was', 'rage', 'mid-70', 'became', 'plot-point', 'many', 'forgettable', 'thrillers', 'TV', 'shows', 'wore', 'out', 'welcome', 'Premonition', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'bunch', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'were', 'not', 'handful', 'remember', 'fondly', 'Late', 'Show', 'airings.Director', 'Robert', 'Allen', 'Schnitzer', 'orchestrated', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'offbeat', 'little', 'horror-oddity', 'meager', 'budget', 'amidst', 'decidedly', 'no-frills', 'locations', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'times', 'Premonition', 'same', 'eerie', 'sustained', 'mood', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'fraction', 'resources', 'think', 'most', 'fans', 'obscure', '70', 'horror', 'somewhat', 'artistic', 'flair', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'pretty', 'enjoyable.This', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'DVD', 'good', 'should', 'say', 'as', 'good', 'low-budget', '70', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'fast', 'grainy', 'film', 'stock', 'going', 'look', 'also', 'probably', 'only', 'release', 'film', 'going', 'see', ""'d"", 'snap', 'up', 'print']",The Premonition
