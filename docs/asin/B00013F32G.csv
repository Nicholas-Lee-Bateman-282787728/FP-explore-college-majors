The rest of the episodes are high quality and entertaining, and looked and sounded better than I ever saw it as a kid.We do have to be careful if our two year old daughter sees this and constantly remind her that hitting is bad.  There is quite alot of hitting and slapstick involved, especially from Witchiepoo towards her pet bird, Seymour the Spider, and Stupid Bat.The extra interviews were interesting although I was a little dissappointed in the fact that Marty Krofft was so belittling and condenscending to his younger brother Sid.  Sid seemed to be the fun and creative one, whereas Marty was the older and more serious one.

Pufnstuf series might find surprising is that there were only 17 episodes produced, and one of those is what amounts to a ""clip"" show. When the series first aired, it seemed to go on forever. That was in the days of one episode a Saturday, every Saturday. Somehow, kids didn't quite catch on that it was the same eps over and over.But the show itself was pretty revolutionary for its time. A Dragon with a heart of gold, a witch with an eye for gold and a kid with a golden flute in the middle.But that's typical of Sid and Marty Krofft, who provided a gentle touch, a bit of slapstick, some wild sets and costumes and a stellar star in the form of Jack Wild, just off his Artful Dodger turn in the Best Picture Oscar winning ""Oliver!"" at the time.If you're a fan of the series, you will like what you see here. As advertised, every episode is presented (though one of them is in rather washed out shape in comparison to the rest for some reason). But even more notable are the special features you get here.It's rare to get a sit down interview with the Kroffts themselves, but you get to hear them both tell their stories about the days of their childhood careers, and what led them to create their collection of programs. THAT is worth the price of the DVD, because you get to find out a lot about the psychology of these two guys through their candid comments: Sid, who was the Vaudeville star, and Marty, who copied his world famous sibling doing his same act. The interaction between these two could be the most amusing thing in this collection and MUST NOT BE MISSED!They also slip you a couple of episodes of an early program titled ""Irving"" about a circus lion and his adventures in and around the Big Top.Billie Hayes, who played antagonist Witchiepoo, does a wonderful interview at a convention, with people walking by in the background of a hotel ballroom, and that in itself is amusing.But the toughest thing for me to see was Jack Wild's interview. It's clear that the guy has been through a very tough time in his life and every last bit of it shows quite clearly in his face. He nearly looks as old as his witch counterpart! However, to his credit, he still has the youth in his eyes and is still quite expressive.If I have any advice, I'd suggest you view all the special features before you see any of the episodes. It sets them up a bit better and give you a better sense of the people involved and the timing of everything.

There are various commercials on YouTube, for instance, that drive this home from the 70's, and I always wondered where in the world McDonald's got their crazy characters and ideas from...God forbid they come-up with something original.In any case, you have to wonder what sort of psychedelics Marty & Sid were either on or had done, although it is all completely innocent, despite some of the mild ethnic/racial stereotyping that was typical of that era, that seemed out of place (the Indian and African American trees etc..., which didn't really bother me at all, it was an attempt at being inclusive) and the incredible acting job by Billie Hayes as Witchiepoo, reminiscent of the Wizard Of Oz, she plays that role of the Wicked Witch to a tee.I am still blown-away today by the ability to create such a creative fantasy world with nothing but hand puppets and elaborate sets, costumes, and actors.  It is brilliant, full of 60's Vietnam war era subject matter (characters in hippie costumes protesting dentists and demanding candy, but not wanting to ""work"" for it - which is ridiculously stereotypical from a lame authoritarian viewpoint, and it makes it that much more funny and silly), but relating to children, and brings back a lot of memories from a time when things were done without any digital assistance at all, outside of green screens.It has better pacing and much more visual stimulation than Land Of The Lost, with each episode lasting approximately 22 minutes.  Adults can appreciate the art direction, stage design, and the incredible costumes, while kids under 8 will be enamored with the stories, characters and relate to the story of an alienated boy finding fun, good-hearted friends in a fantasy world he or she might dream of being in, while going to sleep at night.It's great to see this on DVD (and on various streaming services including Amazon) now.  The price is perfect and I love putting these shows in the Blu-ray player or firing them up on streaming just to put me in a better, more relaxed mood when the stress and negative nature of the world is weighing on me.",5,Wonderful Series For Any age,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,3132,"['just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'shows', 'anymore', 'maybe', 'kids', 'today', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'appreciate', 'incredible', 'amount', 'effort', 'work', 'creativity', 'went', 'staging', 'such', 'elaborate', 'original', 'fantasy', 'world', 'up', 'parents', 'generation', 'expose', 'again', 'suppose', '40+', 'crowd', 'now', '.HR', 'Pufnstuf', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'pre-dates', 'childhood', 'even', 'was', 'born', '1969', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'young', 'recall', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'say', 'Land', 'Lost', 'Super', 'Friends', 'other', 'mid-70', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'adult', 'revisiting', 'crazy', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Kroft', 'series', 'can', 'still', 'now', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'Vulture', 'other', 'characters', 'can', 'completely', 'appreciate', 'sets', 'props', 'costumes', 'acting', 'cast', 'pulled-off', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'must', ""'ve"", 'had', 'doing', 'this.You', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'McDonald', 'completely', 'ripped-off', 'characters', 'environments', 'show', '70', 'lingered', 'long', 'time', 'order', 'target', 'children', 'junk', 'food', 'are', 'various', 'commercials', 'YouTube', 'instance', 'drive', 'home', '70', 'always', 'wondered', 'where', 'world', 'McDonald', 'got', 'crazy', 'characters', 'ideas', 'God', 'come-up', 'something', 'original.In', 'case', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'psychedelics', 'Marty', 'Sid', 'were', 'either', 'had', 'done', 'completely', 'innocent', 'mild', 'ethnic/racial', 'stereotyping', 'was', 'typical', 'era', 'seemed', 'place', 'Indian', 'African', 'American', 'trees', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'was', 'attempt', 'being', 'inclusive', 'incredible', 'acting', 'job', 'Billie', 'Hayes', 'Witchiepoo', 'reminiscent', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'role', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'tee.I', 'am', 'still', 'blown-away', 'today', 'ability', 'create', 'such', 'creative', 'fantasy', 'world', 'nothing', 'hand', 'puppets', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'costumes', 'actors', 'brilliant', 'full', '60', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'era', 'subject', 'matter', 'characters', 'hippie', 'costumes', 'protesting', 'dentists', 'demanding', 'candy', 'not', 'wanting', 'work', 'ridiculously', 'stereotypical', 'lame', 'authoritarian', 'viewpoint', 'much', 'more', 'funny', 'silly', 'relating', 'children', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'time', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'digital', 'assistance', 'green', 'screens.It', 'better', 'pacing', 'much', 'more', 'visual', 'stimulation', 'Land', 'Lost', 'episode', 'lasting', 'approximately', '22', 'minutes', 'Adults', 'can', 'appreciate', 'art', 'direction', 'stage', 'design', 'incredible', 'costumes', 'kids', '8', 'will', 'be', 'enamored', 'stories', 'characters', 'relate', 'story', 'alienated', 'boy', 'finding', 'fun', 'good-hearted', 'friends', 'fantasy', 'world', 'might', 'dream', 'being', 'going', 'sleep', 'night.It', 'great', 'see', 'DVD', 'various', 'streaming', 'services', 'including', 'Amazon', 'now', 'price', 'perfect', 'love', 'putting', 'shows', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'firing', 'up', 'streaming', 'just', 'put', 'better', 'more', 'relaxed', 'mood', 'when', 'stress', 'negative', 'nature', 'world', 'weighing']",H.R.

So I had some some credits on my credit card and decided to use them to buy this package. Well, the package made it to my house but the cheap thin plastic was busted on both sides and the cardboard was crushed too. I'm getting a refund on this product and I get to keep the busted set. But just let me express my frustration. The packaging is CHEAP. The cardboard use for the case and the packaging is about half the thickness of your usual dvd set. And the plastic is pretty thin as well. So this is one of the reasons the set arrived completely busted all to heck. And you should see how gawdy and LOUD the packaging is. There are freaking silly pictures all over the packaging. In short, IT'S UGLY. There are simply too many stupid pictures all over the packaging. The dvds will fit securely in the plastic though. The dvds will not fall out but the product is simply UGLY. Whoever devised this packaging just went CRAZY with pictures. This is easily the UGLIEST dvd set I have ever purchased. I can appreciate the use of the pictures it's just that the packaging is VERY BUSY. It is OVERLOADED with pictures. It is ridiculously overloaded with pictures. It just looks absurd and stupid. So, for me I felt ridiculous just playing with the package. The creators of this reissue should have used sturdy cardboard/paper, thicker plastic and they should have TONED down the images. This set has IMAGE OVERLOAD making it look retarded.This review is just for the packaging. The dvds seem to be of the usual quality. It is three dvds which are not thin or cheap.

Pufnstuf may have lasted only 17 episodes, it may have come from the late 60's, and there may be a dozen other things that could be considered negative flaws about this show, but they only add to the infectious charm of this wonderfully orchaestrated live action cartoon.I bought the complete DVD boxset for my fiancee's birthday recently, because I knew it would be something she would simply love and treasure for years to come.  Some may think that the Kroft brothers did drugs in order to create the many zany and trippy programs they created over the years, but trust me, they didn't.Are there druglike innuendoes and double-entendres placed visually and in the dialogue?  well, that's really up to personal opinions and interpretations.  But I digress.This show is definitely worth owning, the dialogue can be a bit cringe-inducing at times but not overtly so, the puns and jokes can go from hilarious to Fozzie-like unBearability within the same episode, but everything is simply top=notch.Jack Wild is awesome as Jimmy, he brings youthful energy and enthusiasm and seems to be enjoying himself wholeheartedly throughout the series.  He is very convincing in his determination to get home or to rescue Freddy Flute from the witch, showcasing a great deal of courage and loyalty to his friends, Freddy, Puf, Dr. Blinky, etc.Billie Hayes is simply excellent as Witchiepoo, she combines a playful lunacy with a menacing ruthlessness, wrapped up with perfect comedic timing, you can't help but laugh and love the ol' hag.The costumes are simply marvelous, not just for Pufnstuff, but for everyone: Dr. Blinky, the Evil Trees (specially imported from Transylvania), Orson the Vulture, Seymour Spider, Cling &amp; Clang (perfect examples of Keystone Cops), Judy Frog, etc.There are even some very interesting moments within each episode.  The show itself can be described as a 'Wizard of Oz' meets 'Puf the Magic Dragon', nowhere is this more evident than in the opening episode.  Especially with a Magic Path looking very much like a Yellow Brick Road.  Even Judy Frog is dressed and talks like Judy Garland (somewhat).There is even an episode where a bunch of ants are holding up signs of protest with chants of 'Make Candy, Not War', this scene being somewhat reflective of the protests to the Vietnam war perhaps.Jimmy does 'The Robot' long before it became a dance craze in 'Mechanical Boy', and in one episode a new dance is introduced called 'The Moonwalk' long before Michael Jackson would use the name for his own trademarked dance.This is the perfect sort of show that can help lift your spirits when you're feeling down.  Despite all of the bright and psychedelic colors utilized for this show, it certainly isn't candy-coated or in any ways babyish.Let's hope more of the Krofft creations make it to DVD!",5,"Can't watch a little, cuz you can't watch enough!",1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,2822,"['H.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'may', 'have', 'lasted', 'only', '17', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'late', '60', 'may', 'be', 'dozen', 'other', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'negative', 'flaws', 'show', 'only', 'add', 'infectious', 'charm', 'wonderfully', 'orchaestrated', 'live', 'action', 'cartoon.I', 'bought', 'complete', 'DVD', 'boxset', 'fiancee', 'birthday', 'recently', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'simply', 'love', 'treasure', 'years', 'come', 'may', 'think', 'Kroft', 'brothers', 'did', 'drugs', 'order', 'create', 'many', 'zany', 'trippy', 'programs', 'created', 'years', ""didn't.Are"", 'there', 'druglike', 'innuendoes', 'double-entendres', 'placed', 'visually', 'dialogue', 'well', 'really', 'up', 'personal', 'opinions', 'interpretations', 'digress.This', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'cringe-inducing', 'times', 'not', 'overtly', 'so', 'puns', 'jokes', 'can', 'go', 'hilarious', 'Fozzie-like', 'unBearability', 'same', 'episode', 'everything', 'simply', 'top=notch.Jack', 'Wild', 'awesome', 'Jimmy', 'youthful', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'be', 'enjoying', 'wholeheartedly', 'series', 'very', 'convincing', 'determination', 'get', 'home', 'rescue', 'Freddy', 'Flute', 'witch', 'showcasing', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'loyalty', 'friends', 'Freddy', 'Puf', 'Dr.', 'Blinky', 'etc.Billie', 'Hayes', 'simply', 'excellent', 'Witchiepoo', 'playful', 'lunacy', 'menacing', 'ruthlessness', 'wrapped', 'up', 'perfect', 'comedic', 'timing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'love', 'ol', 'hag.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'not', 'just', 'Pufnstuff', 'everyone', 'Dr.', 'Blinky', 'Evil', 'Trees', 'specially', 'imported', 'Transylvania', 'Orson', 'Vulture', 'Seymour', 'Spider', 'Cling', 'amp', 'Clang', 'perfect', 'examples', 'Keystone', 'Cops', 'Judy', 'Frog', 'are', 'even', 'very', 'interesting', 'moments', 'episode', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'described', ""'Wizard"", 'Oz', 'meets', ""'Puf"", 'Magic', 'Dragon', 'nowhere', 'more', 'evident', 'opening', 'episode', 'Especially', 'Magic', 'Path', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'Even', 'Judy', 'Frog', 'dressed', 'talks', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'somewhat', 'even', 'episode', 'where', 'bunch', 'ants', 'are', 'holding', 'up', 'signs', 'protest', 'chants', ""'Make"", 'Candy', 'Not', 'War', 'scene', 'being', 'somewhat', 'reflective', 'protests', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'perhaps.Jimmy', 'Robot', 'long', 'became', 'dance', 'craze', ""'Mechanical"", 'Boy', 'one', 'episode', 'new', 'dance', 'introduced', 'called', ""'The"", 'Moonwalk', 'long', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'would', 'use', 'name', 'own', 'trademarked', 'dance.This', 'perfect', 'sort', 'show', 'can', 'help', 'lift', 'spirits', 'when', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'down', 'bright', 'psychedelic', 'colors', 'utilized', 'show', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'candy-coated', 'ways', 'babyish.Let', 'hope', 'more', 'Krofft', 'creations', 'make', 'DVD']",H.R.

Along came these two men Sid and Marty Kroft with a plethera of shows for kids to watch on Saturday mornings. We had Land of the Lost. Sigmund, amongst others. And then there was PufnStuf. The jolly green (though he was never green) dinosaur, dragon, figment of the imagination who was mayor of Living island, an island full of things that lived as much as the young boy who was stranded on the island because of the nefarious (if not bumbling more than anything Witchiepoo and her two lackeys Orson and Seymour with an occasional hand from Stupid Bat. In just a few episodes, we were taken to a place where song and dance were as easy as breathing and talking. Lessons were learned, bonds were formed, and I grew up a better person at times.

A child of the `70s, I grew up on all of these shows, and I was surprised at how crystal clear they were in my memory more than thirty years after I had originally seen them.I got this ""H.R. Pufnstuf - The Complete Series"" boxset, and have had a great time re-watching all of the episodes. This set has all seventeen episodes released of ""H.R. Pufnstuf."" The episodes are bright and clear, and unlike the ""Saturday Morning"" DVD they seem to have gone through a solid restoration.The shows are as good as I remember. The brothers Sid and Marty were master puppet makers and imaginative storytellers, who kept it going episode after episode with bizarre, colorful fantasy.  Jack Wild and Billie Hayes do a tremendous job keeping the scenes alive as the human characters in a puppet kingdom.  One detail I did forget--the terrible mushrooms!  I have a lifelong mushroom phobia, and I remembered instantly how scared I was of the mushrooms in ""H.R. Pufnstuf."" Sid and Marty Kroft, you have scarred me for life!There are two releases of the complete ""H.R. Pufnstuf;"" this out-of-print boxset from Rhino and the reissuedH.R. Pufnstuf: The Complete Seriesby Vivendi Entertainment.  Neither of them is a perfect collection, as both have special features not available on the other.  The Vivendi set has the segment of the Kroft Halloween special ""Horror Hotel"" staring the ""Pufnstuf"" cast, while the Rhino set has a slew of interviews with the cast.Personally, I like the Rhino set better and think it is worth tracking down. I loved the interviews almost as much as I loved the series.  They are nice long interviews, not little sound bites, and I learned a lot about the series and its creators.  I didn't know that Jack Wild was the Artful Dodger fromOliver!(another film I love). And I didn't know that the Kroft brothers were behind the Puppet Theater at Magic Mountain amusement park in California.  I grew up in California, and I LOVED going to the Puppet Theater.  I had no idea I was seeing the Kroft brothers at work.  That was a great detail to my childhood memories that I got from this boxset.",5,The better Pufnstuf boxset,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,2241,"['watched', 'theSaturday', 'Morning', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'KrofftDVD', 'recently', 'had', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'various', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Kroft', 'shows', 'child', '70s', 'grew', 'up', 'shows', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'crystal', 'clear', 'were', 'memory', 'more', 'thirty', 'years', 'had', 'originally', 'seen', 'them.I', 'got', 'H.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'Complete', 'Series', 'boxset', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'time', 're-watching', 'episodes', 'set', 'seventeen', 'episodes', 'released', 'H.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'episodes', 'are', 'bright', 'clear', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'DVD', 'seem', 'have', 'gone', 'solid', 'restoration.The', 'shows', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'brothers', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'were', 'master', 'puppet', 'makers', 'imaginative', 'storytellers', 'who', 'kept', 'going', 'episode', 'episode', 'bizarre', 'colorful', 'fantasy', 'Jack', 'Wild', 'Billie', 'Hayes', 'do', 'tremendous', 'job', 'keeping', 'scenes', 'alive', 'human', 'characters', 'puppet', 'kingdom', 'One', 'detail', 'did', 'forget', 'terrible', 'mushrooms', 'have', 'lifelong', 'mushroom', 'phobia', 'remembered', 'instantly', 'how', 'scared', 'was', 'mushrooms', 'H.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Kroft', 'have', 'scarred', 'life', 'are', 'two', 'releases', 'complete', 'H.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'out-of-print', 'boxset', 'Rhino', 'reissuedH.R', 'Pufnstuf', 'Complete', 'Seriesby', 'Vivendi', 'Entertainment', 'Neither', 'perfect', 'collection', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'available', 'other', 'Vivendi', 'set', 'segment', 'Kroft', 'Halloween', 'special', 'Horror', 'Hotel', 'staring', 'Pufnstuf', 'cast', 'Rhino', 'set', 'slew', 'interviews', 'cast.Personally', 'like', 'Rhino', 'set', 'better', 'think', 'worth', 'tracking', 'down', 'loved', 'interviews', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'series', 'are', 'nice', 'long', 'interviews', 'not', 'little', 'sound', 'bites', 'learned', 'lot', 'series', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jack', 'Wild', 'was', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'fromOliver', 'film', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Kroft', 'brothers', 'were', 'Puppet', 'Theater', 'Magic', 'Mountain', 'amusement', 'park', 'California', 'grew', 'up', 'California', 'LOVED', 'going', 'Puppet', 'Theater', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'seeing', 'Kroft', 'brothers', 'work', 'was', 'great', 'detail', 'childhood', 'memories', 'got', 'boxset']",H.R.
