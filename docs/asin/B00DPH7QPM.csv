1660383,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00DPH7QPM,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","EXTRACTED has the appearance of a typical contemporary horror film, but it's very much straight science fiction. Though the general scope and quality of the acting are fairly limited, there are some intriguing concepts here (linking the consciousness of two people, allowing one to explore the other's memory, etc). The storyline keeps your attention and is by no means predictable. It may be a little hard to catch all the twists, reversals, and complications on first-watch, but that's just part of the fun of films like this.",4,"""Who the hell doesn't have skeletons in their closet?""",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,528,"['EXTRACTED', 'appearance', 'typical', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'straight', 'science', 'fiction', 'general', 'scope', 'quality', 'acting', 'are', 'fairly', 'limited', 'are', 'intriguing', 'concepts', 'here', 'linking', 'consciousness', 'two', 'people', 'allowing', 'one', 'explore', 'other', 'memory', 'etc', 'storyline', 'attention', 'means', 'predictable', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'catch', 'twists', 'reversals', 'complications', 'first-watch', 'just', 'part', 'fun', 'films']",Extracted

As good as some of it might be, the bad drags down the good.Here's the scoop. Tom (Sasha Roiz) has invented a gadget that can help relieve troubled people such as war vets, abused children, etc by extracting the bad stuff from their brains. Tom's agent is having a hard time selling it because it's merely a 'do good' device. But when the Department of Corrections wants to know if they can reverse the machine's operation to go into a person's head to determine his guilt he might have a sale and get rich from it. The first test goes horribly wrong with bad news for Tom.There is a lot to like about this movie. Much of the idea surrounding the machine and the subsequent tech-talk dialogue is spot on. It sounds amazingly authentic. Tom's reluctance, on moral grounds, for going into someone's head and digging around, is also good. It's a mix of how people's brains work, morality and philosophy. And When what happens to him happens, they come up with a cool, techy reason on how it happens. The story itself needed some punching up. I liked the things that happened, but they came off in a somewhat clunky fashion. This is a case where a seasoned Hollywood script writer would come in handy.The acting is decent overall. The production level areas are good enough for the most part as is the directing. The directing in the climax needed a bit more umph though. This is an indy film through and through. If you liked ""Primer"" or ""Upstream Color"" you'll probably want to check this out. It's well worth watching. Just don't set your expectations too high.",3,Coulda Been a Contendor,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1636,"['Somewhere', 'Inception', 'Dreamscape', 'film', 'Extraction', 'As', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'bad', 'drags', 'down', 'good.Here', 'scoop', 'Tom', 'Sasha', 'Roiz', 'invented', 'gadget', 'can', 'help', 'relieve', 'troubled', 'people', 'such', 'war', 'vets', 'abused', 'children', 'etc', 'extracting', 'bad', 'stuff', 'brains', 'Tom', 'agent', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'selling', 'merely', ""'do"", 'good', 'device', 'when', 'Department', 'Corrections', 'know', 'can', 'reverse', 'machine', 'operation', 'go', 'person', 'head', 'determine', 'guilt', 'might', 'have', 'sale', 'get', 'rich', 'first', 'test', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'bad', 'news', 'Tom.There', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'Much', 'idea', 'surrounding', 'machine', 'subsequent', 'tech-talk', 'dialogue', 'spot', 'amazingly', 'authentic', 'Tom', 'reluctance', 'moral', 'grounds', 'going', 'someone', 'head', 'digging', 'around', 'also', 'good', 'mix', 'how', 'people', 'brains', 'work', 'morality', 'philosophy', 'When', 'what', 'happens', 'come', 'up', 'cool', 'techy', 'reason', 'how', 'story', 'needed', 'punching', 'up', 'liked', 'things', 'happened', 'came', 'off', 'somewhat', 'clunky', 'fashion', 'case', 'where', 'seasoned', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'writer', 'would', 'come', 'handy.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'overall', 'production', 'level', 'areas', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'most', 'part', 'directing', 'directing', 'climax', 'needed', 'bit', 'more', 'umph', 'indy', 'film', 'liked', 'Primer', 'Upstream', 'Color', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high']",Extracted

Like any movie buff knows Robert Rodriguez is best know to make big movies for little monies and Nir seems to want to take that crown away from him. Extracted couldn't have being made for more then a few hundred grand and what Mister Paniry does with that money rivals any big budget movie. Extracted stars Sasha Roiz ( Warehouse 13,  Grimm , Caprica , It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Tom , a scientist that develops a machine that allows a person to watch other peoples memories from within them. As we all know nobody ever wants to fund a project for what it was created for and Tom soon learns that. A potential financier ask to see a test of the machine before its ready and Tom has to put his money were his mouth is. Thing's go bad and now Tom is stuck inside the guinea pig. Anthony , a heroin addict accused of murdering his girlfriend. Extracted works cause it  follows the main rule all great science fictions movies abide by. It understands that the point of the story is not about the technology . Back to the Future was not about a time machine, the car was the tool that helped the creators tell their story. Other examples that come to mind , Looper, Primer, Stephen King's Under the Dome and even his novel 11/22/63 ( soon to be a movie).
