Charlotte Rampling, his estranged girlfriend, is  the perfect vixen of a serie noir: beautiful, misterious, with far away eyes that hide and ambiguous soul. Even the tempo is right: slow, dark, heavy. And the villain, Malcom Mc Dowell, a twisted  family man, how can he go wrong.  So I was having the time of my life wondering why  movies don't get so dark anymore when suddenly, the film sank, lost his tempo,  and Will coolness vanished  even thought he became handsomer with his new suit and haircut. It was like if at the end the producers, the director and the screen writer decided that the movie had to be hurried away making one of the lamest motives for a crime, sacrificing the first three quartes of what could had been a great movie",3,It almost made it,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,866,"['How', 'much', 'cooler', 'can', 'yo', 'get', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Will', 'lonely', 'ganster', 'who', 'retirement', 'avenge', 'brother', 'death', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'estranged', 'girlfriend', 'perfect', 'vixen', 'serie', 'noir', 'beautiful', 'misterious', 'far', 'away', 'eyes', 'hide', 'ambiguous', 'soul', 'Even', 'tempo', 'right', 'slow', 'dark', 'heavy', 'villain', 'Malcom', 'Mc', 'Dowell', 'twisted', 'family', 'man', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'was', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'wondering', 'why', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'dark', 'anymore', 'when', 'suddenly', 'film', 'sank', 'lost', 'tempo', 'Will', 'coolness', 'vanished', 'even', 'thought', 'became', 'new', 'suit', 'haircut', 'was', 'end', 'producers', 'director', 'screen', 'writer', 'decided', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'hurried', 'away', 'making', 'one', 'lamest', 'motives', 'crime', 'sacrificing', 'first', 'three', 'quartes', 'what', 'could', 'had', 'been', 'great', 'movie']",I'll Sleep When I'm Dead

848822,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0002WZTJS,Alistair McHarg,"[13, 13]","Hard to understand why people are not getting this terrific movie.  In Croupier, also starring Owens, Mike Hodges evoked a brooding, existential London sub-culture where motives were always unclear and character was never divided between good and evil.  Croupier was slow, wonderful to watch, and oozed irrational malice.  It drew viewers in just as the unholy lure of gambling draws in prospective addicts.In I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, Hodges weaves the same gossamer spell.  There is little story, plenty of characters, but very little character development.  These people don't follow a traditional formula; they bump into each other like boats in a harbor - just like real life.  The cinematography, music, and overall vibe create a classic modern noir sensibility, and like the best noir, there is no underpinning of justice or rationality to make us feel good about how things turn out.  Admittedly, these characters are sketched, not painted, but it is amazing how much we can surmise from just a few carefully selected details.Most wonderful of all, this is a cynical gangster picture with almost no violence.  (Lesser practitioners of moviemaking please take note!)  The sense of dread, of impending doom, is where it should be, inside the viewer's imagination.  Unlike other reviewers who were dissatisfied with McDowell's motivation, I thought it was inspired - so frequently the most hideous injustices are dished out for reasons no nobler than personal insecurities and jealousy.Owen is always worth watching, regardless.  Here he is surrounded by major talent, Malcolm McDowell and Charlotte Rampling.  Both are under-utilized, shall we say, but it's always nice to see them.  Rampling, nearly 60, looks amazing, still a real beauty with a fragile yet compelling persona.  If you'd like to see her tear the scenery apart, check out The Night Porter.When Will gets his shave and suits up for the hit, was anybody else reminded of that wonderful scene in Cat Ballou when Lee Marvin puts on his best gunslinger outfit (with scarf!) to take on the man with a tin nose?",4,I'll Sleep When I'm Done This Review,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2077,"['Hard', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Croupier', 'also', 'starring', 'Owens', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'evoked', 'brooding', 'existential', 'London', 'sub-culture', 'where', 'motives', 'were', 'always', 'unclear', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'divided', 'good', 'evil', 'Croupier', 'was', 'slow', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'oozed', 'irrational', 'malice', 'drew', 'viewers', 'just', 'unholy', 'lure', 'gambling', 'draws', 'prospective', 'addicts.In', ""'ll"", 'Sleep', 'When', ""'m"", 'Dead', 'Hodges', 'same', 'gossamer', 'spell', 'little', 'story', 'plenty', 'characters', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'traditional', 'formula', 'bump', 'other', 'boats', 'harbor', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'cinematography', 'music', 'overall', 'vibe', 'create', 'classic', 'modern', 'noir', 'sensibility', 'best', 'noir', 'underpinning', 'justice', 'rationality', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'Admittedly', 'characters', 'are', 'sketched', 'not', 'painted', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'surmise', 'just', 'few', 'carefully', 'selected', 'details.Most', 'wonderful', 'cynical', 'gangster', 'picture', 'almost', 'violence', 'Lesser', 'practitioners', 'moviemaking', 'please', 'take', 'note', 'sense', 'dread', 'impending', 'doom', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'were', 'dissatisfied', 'McDowell', 'motivation', 'thought', 'was', 'inspired', 'so', 'frequently', 'most', 'hideous', 'injustices', 'are', 'dished', 'out', 'reasons', 'nobler', 'personal', 'insecurities', 'jealousy.Owen', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'regardless', 'Here', 'surrounded', 'major', 'talent', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'are', 'under-utilized', 'shall', 'say', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Rampling', 'nearly', '60', 'amazing', 'still', 'real', 'beauty', 'fragile', 'yet', 'compelling', 'persona', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'tear', 'scenery', 'apart', 'check', 'out', 'Night', 'Porter.When', 'Will', 'shave', 'suits', 'up', 'hit', 'was', 'anybody', 'else', 'reminded', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'when', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'best', 'gunslinger', 'outfit', 'scarf', 'take', 'man', 'tin', 'nose']",I'll Sleep When I'm Dead
848823,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0002WZTJS,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[4, 4]","You could be forgiven after watching this movie, to think it is a pilot movie for an English style ""Soprano's"", and be keenly awaiting the next installment after the end credits roll.  The thrust of the story revolves around the seedier side of the London underworld, and is atmospheric, and at times a gritty urban drama. Clive Owen plays a former gangland boss who has (for some reason that is only ever hinted at) disappeared into obscurity, small time menial jobs, and living in a converted panel van, in the rural countryside. His friend (left behind, along with girlfriend, and former associates) seek him out, after his younger playboy brother is found dead, apparently having commited suicide, after being raped (yes you heard me , raped). Mr Owen, must revisit his old ways we assume, to find the reason behind the death, and bring the villians to justice, London mobster style. Sounds like a great drama, but what we get is a long and plodding build up with many questions unanswered. The film begins to deliver on the promise of it's opening hour or so in the last 5 minutes of running time, but then leaves everything unanswered, and the viewer hanging. Owen is believable as the brooding ""Kray Twins"" style gangster in contemporary London, and there is a good supporting cast. But most will agree that the talent on display is wasted. This is a compelling film, and fairly good story, spoilt by some wayward directing, and a long slow build up to a nothing ending.

Given the U.K. gangster subtext, even catching a bit of the oomph contained in the comet that was 'Sexy Beast'...well, who could pass that up?Too bad, then, this film was such a letdown.  It's certainly not due to either Owen or Rhys-Meyers, who have little to work with, frankly, in terms of a compelling narrative.  And one can't blame Charlotte Rampling or Malcolm McDowell either - Rampling's role is smallish, hazily drawn.  McDowell plays a pivotal part, but I never figured out what drove him to do the shocking act around which the film revolves.  I figured it was due to some deep-seated resentment or long-sheathed act of revenge.  In fact, it's explained as nothing of the sort.  In fact, it seems petty more than anything else.  And that makes the whole concept of the film downright perplexing.I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out how this one went awry.

848826,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0002WZTJS,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","Clive Owen has come into his own as an actor. His roles in GOSFORD PARK, INSIDE MAN, and CHILDREN OF MEN have proven him to be an excellent casting choice. And here in I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD, director Mike Hodges made the very wise decision to feature Mr. Owen in the prime role as Will Graham, a ""retired"" gangster returned to the madness after the apparent suicide of his only brother.Building on the fairly weak relationship of Will Graham with his brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, MATCH POINT), the story begins just as it ends, with the arrival and ultimate departure of Will. Interesting in a sort of nonlinear scripting way, the story's ambling nature and unaffecting characters are impossible to empathize with. When Davey (Meyers) is brutally sodomized by a ruthless man, we care very little because we simply don't know anything about them. Nor do we know (or are ever told) why Davey was raped in the first place. There is a simple speech given by the rapist (played by Malcolm McDowell) in an attempt at an explanation, but this is neither believable nor seemingly coherent with the script itself.Which leads us to bigger and better problems. Since this is the crux of the story -- and what brings Will (Owen) out of retirement -- this leaves the entire film feeling very hollow. The connections between thugs, coroners/cops, and family are thinly developed (if at all) and given so little screen-time as to leave most watchers scratching their heads.The ending, as stated earlier, mirrors the film's beginnings in that Will appears standing on the same beach monologuing the same lines. The assumption that the viewer is supposed to make is that this has happened before (i.e., Will has come out of ""retirement"" in the past for important things), but it comes off feeling stilted and out of place.Clive Owen does an admirable acting job, but the script given him here is too weak to make this a positive movie-going experience.",2,"Clive Owen Is Good, But Not Good Enough To Breathe Life Into This Sleeper",1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1946,"['Clive', 'Owen', 'come', 'own', 'actor', 'roles', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'INSIDE', 'MAN', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'excellent', 'casting', 'choice', 'here', ""'LL"", 'SLEEP', 'WHEN', ""'M"", 'DEAD', 'director', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'made', 'very', 'wise', 'decision', 'feature', 'Mr.', 'Owen', 'prime', 'role', 'Will', 'Graham', 'retired', 'gangster', 'returned', 'madness', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'only', 'brother.Building', 'fairly', 'weak', 'relationship', 'Will', 'Graham', 'brother', 'Davey', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'story', 'just', 'arrival', 'ultimate', 'departure', 'Will', 'Interesting', 'sort', 'nonlinear', 'scripting', 'way', 'story', 'ambling', 'nature', 'unaffecting', 'characters', 'are', 'impossible', 'empathize', 'When', 'Davey', 'Meyers', 'brutally', 'sodomized', 'ruthless', 'man', 'care', 'very', 'little', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'ever', 'told', 'why', 'Davey', 'was', 'raped', 'first', 'place', 'simple', 'speech', 'given', 'rapist', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'attempt', 'explanation', 'believable', 'seemingly', 'coherent', 'script', 'itself.Which', 'bigger', 'better', 'problems', 'crux', 'story', 'what', 'brings', 'Will', 'Owen', 'retirement', 'entire', 'film', 'feeling', 'very', 'hollow', 'connections', 'thugs', 'coroners/cops', 'family', 'are', 'thinly', 'developed', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'screen-time', 'leave', 'most', 'watchers', 'scratching', 'heads.The', 'ending', 'stated', 'earlier', 'film', 'beginnings', 'Will', 'standing', 'same', 'beach', 'monologuing', 'same', 'lines', 'assumption', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'make', 'happened', 'i.e.', 'Will', 'come', 'retirement', 'past', 'important', 'things', 'off', 'feeling', 'stilted', 'place.Clive', 'Owen', 'admirable', 'acting', 'job', 'script', 'given', 'here', 'too', 'weak', 'make', 'positive', 'movie-going', 'experience']",I'll Sleep When I'm Dead
848827,A2OV92BM57J94R,B0002WZTJS,"Brandon Whitfeld ""caulfield0""","[16, 18]","One of the most luckluster and spineless entries into the British gangster genre made, ironically enough, by a filmmaker who defined it all several decades ago. See Get Carter, the original version, if you want to see stylish grace executed with poisonous aplomb and bitter vigor. Not a great film, but if you like this kind of stuff, you can't beat Michael Caine.Clive Owen may be the first actor in cinema history to embark through an entire film project utilizing a single facial expression. Then again, he doesn't have much to go on; here's the basic plot: (if you think I might spoil something, then don't read ahead, although we find out all this stuff in the first 20 minutes or so).Bad evil former gangster now retired hides in woods doing manual labor. He is evil, but now out of the lifestyle, and you can tell this because he's bearded, doesn't talk much, and has a glassy-eyed expression.Bad gangster's younger brother is a man-about-town drugrunner, midlevel scumbag, who gets pulled into a warehouse and raped by Malcolm McDowell. Younger brother, dazed, startled, wanders home, and fittingly, commits suicide. Wouldn't you? He's one of the lucky ones.Then we watch slowly, relentlessly, as Clive returns from hiding, finds out all this stuff that we already know, is given bare patchy explanatory mumbo-jumbo from other characters, and then kills who he needs to kill.Visually dull, completely un-stylish, and utterly pointless. Everyone involved clearly wasn't sleeping enough, or was sleeping way too much. What else can I say? Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who I usually like, is wasted here, as is McDowell, who looks a bit put out to be involved in this at all.

DeRiemer,"[6, 6]","Davey Graham (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a charming young opportunist who deals a bit in drugs, beds the socialites he sells to and takes money from their purses. He seems to be leading a happy, careless London life until late one night, leaving the bed and the apartment of a wealthy young woman, he is grabbed by two men and hustled into an alley. There, a third man, older and contemptuous (Malcolm McDowell), tears down Davey's' trousers. While the two goons hold Davey over some tires, the man inexplicably rapes him. Davey staggers back to his apartment, fills the tub with cold water and sinks into it fully dressed. Ten hours later, still in the tub, Davey cuts his throat. The rest of this stylish, glum noir tells the story of Davey's older brother Will (Clive Owen). Will had been a feared enforcer for the London mobs but had dropped out three years before and disappeared, living in a camper and doing manual labor. He feels he has wasted his life and now lives alone. When he learns of his brother's death, and learns of the rape, Will is determined to find the man responsible and wreak his own form of justice. And when he returns to London, he finds the gang leaders don't like it.Mike Hodges directed the great Get Carter with Michael Caine and the near great Croupier, also with Owen. He does a fine job here. Hodges doesn't waste a lot of time on narrative, so you have to pay attention. You also need to fill in a little background on your own, which keeps the movie interesting. The story line is all about revenge. The film sets its own pace and moves relentlessly. The look of the movie is first-rate. It's neo-noir, all dark shadows, sullen, tough or sad characters and barely repressed violence. When violence does happen, it's startling. Clive Owen has little to say in the movie. He acts with his eyes. Malcolm McDowell has a hammer-lock on contemptuous disdain; he doesn't have much time on screen, but what there is, is noteworthy.I liked the movie a lot, even though it sets a deliberate pace.

848831,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0002WZTJS,Cubist,"[6, 8]","At first glance, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead seems like a very conventional film noir story but it is in fact told in a very unconventional way as director Mike Hodges refuses to spell things out. Will Graham (Owen) is a retired gangster brought out of self-imposed exile when he learns that Davey (Rhys Meyers), his young brother has apparently committed suicide. Will lives out in a very Twins Peaksian forest as a lumberjack. It's as if David Lynch directed a British gangster film in Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me mode-in other words, a series of downbeats. Will is drawn back into the city intent on finding out why David killed himself. He learns that his brother was mixed up in drugs and this leads to a nasty crime boss (McDowell). This forces Will to come to grips with his brother's death as he finds out what happened. The audience has to work out who everyone is and what their relation is to Davey.Clive Owen delivers the right amount of intensity and has a very charismatic screen presence. He plays a very credible tough guy-quiet yet very driven. There is an air of silence around his character, a tangible aura that makes him something of an enigma. He has very little dialogue but he doesn't need it. His expressive eyes convey so much more and when he does speak, every word means something.I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is the antithesis of contemporary gangster films. There is no flashy editing or a hip soundtrack a la Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. Instead, Hodges employs invisible, methodical editing and a no-nonsense approach to the material reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts. Hodges draws out a long build-up to the eventual climax whereas most contemporary gangster films go for periodic bursts of violence to punctuate the story. The actual moment of revenge is oddly anticlimactic, not exactly the cathartic release you'd expect.

I think a mistake people make about this film is that it is a conventional gangster film as opposed to one being set in the murky gangster milieu.  There are gangsters on display here both inactive (Clive Owen) and active (Malcolm McDowell).  What Hodges is really commenting on is power.  Not the kind of power that comes with social status or money but the kind that is reinforced through violence some of it sexual.  Hodges posits a lot of uneay truths here that may make some uneasy which to my mind may account for the negative reaction of some to this film.  Clive Owen's performance as a reformed hood investigating the mysterious suicide of his brother(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a paragon of understatement.

Sadly, this manages to be even worse than MORONS, a numbingly tedious movie where the semi-comatose leads are at least three hours behind the audience in guessing the plot. The shock revelation was obvious from the start and Hodges never makes you interested in getting there. He's not helped by his cast. They're either overacting like McDowell or Meyers or totally incapable of showing signs of life, like Rampling and Owen. Even before it was invented Rampling has always looked like she's had too much botox, but inexperienced filmgoers might think she'd OD'd here she's so stiff. Her expression doesn't change from its deathmask once. Owen is more hopeless than usual, shuffling through like a zombie from a cheap George Romero ripoff. He still can't act and his vocal performance is still like a bored photocopier salesman demonstrating some clapped out machine with one eye on the clock for the pub's opening.Contrary to other posters, it's not thoughtful or atmospheric. The plot is obvious, the characters infantile. There's no depth, no ideas, just a dragging running time to fill out. And it is achingly slow in the doing it. From a first-timer this picture would have been laughed out of the office at script stage it's so empty and predictable.British audiences shunned the film (as they did CROUPIER) but Americans might just mistake his accent for a performance. But for the rest of us, it's another pitiful performance in the dullest British gangster film of the past twenty years. That's quite an achievement, but it's the film's only one.If you really want to see a good new British revenge movie, check out Dead Man's Shoes instead - that really is the business.

848835,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0002WZTJS,D. Hartley,"[6, 8]","I know it is not always fair to judge a director's latest work by stacking it against earlier efforts, but in the case of Mike Hodges, who has only made 2 previous films in 33 years (1971's ""Get Carter"" and the more recent ""Croupier"") expectations tend to run high. ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" reunites ""Croupier"" star Clive Owen with Hodges in another moody ""Brit Noir"". Curiously, Hodges appears bent on doing a semi-remake of ""Get Carter"". There is a glaringly similar set up borrowed from the former movie-a low-grade criminal's suspicious ""accidental"" death is tirelessly investigated and ultimately avenged by an estranged brother. Owens even plays his character with the same glum, poker-faced resolve that Michael Caine used in ""Carter"". Unfortunately, where the former film evolved into an engaging character study after the set-up, ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" quickly loses steam and turns into a by-the-numbers revenge thriller (and I apply the word ""thriller"" loosely here). The film is so somnambulent that I found myself marvelling at how much Malcolm McDowell and Sting resemble each other these days, rather than caring about whether McDowell's character would get his due (if I had a yo-yo with me, I probably would have practiced ""walking the dog"" while awaiting the inevitable denouement). Perhaps I missed some subtle subtext or point (always a possibility during a first viewing) but it will be a long time before I can steel myself to sit through this one again.

Despite it's slick trailer, which makes it seem like it may be a violent revenge flick, it really has no action, gunfights, or fisticuffs.  What made this film work for me was the tense pace of the film.  It really drove me to it's final few minutes in just as quick a time as if there were action scenes galore.For the first 90 minutes, we get a very different Clive Owen than the one on the DVD cover.  We get the unkempt, unshaven, drifter he has been for 3 years, until he tries to contact his younger brother, and finds he has committed suicide due to a heinous crime inflicted against him.  You only get the clean cut Clive for the final 10 minutes, but it's an effective transformation, and I didn't mind it coming so late.Each player involved in this setting is shown contemplating the events about to unfold.  Will (Clive Owen) strolls back into London, meets back up with his old girl (Charlotte Rampling), ensues fear in the rival crime boss, and gets a visit from his old gang mates.  While a lot of the aspects never fully conclude, it's quite alright as the film succeeds in merely showing their developments, which are just as intriguing as if all loose ends were tied.

The good-looking petty drug dealing brother (Davy) of a former London bad guy turned granola-muncher (Will, played by Clive Owen) kills himself under suspicious circumstances. Will now must face his personal demons ... does he leave the matter to the cops and rejoin his lady love in law-abiding domestic bliss, or does he revert to his former bad-ass self and off the m*%^&*$*^$er who was responsible for his brother's death? Actually, now that I've spelled it out, that wouldn't have been a bad plot. Nor would adding a sub-plot involving yet another bad-ass who is determined to kill Will now that the former bad-ass is back in town.That was the story that the writers were supposed to tell, but destroyed with dreadful dialogue (what little there was), miniscule character development, gigantic logic holes (the explanation for Davy's rape was ludicrous given the enormous lengths the perp went to in order to carry it out), and a pace so slow you could easily take a nap between the beginning and the end and not miss anything.

848841,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002WZTJS,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Mike Hodges respects his audience: rarely does he forget that viewers have the intelligence to piece together the puzzles he creates. Though his films have memorable characters, those characters are enhanced more by what is not said about them than superfluous dialogue and proscenium staging.  And while this approach to film making does require participation, the end result is well worth the journey.Early on in the film we encounter Will Graham (Clive Owen), a disheveled loner who lives out in the country in the back of a van.  There is something sinister about this man but there is also something intangibly innocent.  We gradually learn that he has been away from a life in the underbelly of London, making little to no contact with his lover (Charlotte Rampling) or his younger brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).Flash into the midst of Davey's comings and goings as a minor drug dealer and gigolo and we see the grimy world Will has left behind.  Out late one night on a drug deal and female servicing gig, Davey tries to find his way back to his lowlife flat (his landlady is the amazing Sylvia Sims!), but in the process he is chased and captured and raped by a wealthy car dealer (Malcolm McDowell).  Decimated, he finds his way home, sits in his bathtub fully clothed, and commits suicide.When Will is informed of Davey's suicide, he returns to London and with the help of his old gang and lover, he sets on a track of trying to understand why Davey committed suicide, only to pursue the perpetrator to a grisly end.There are no secrets to the plot - it is all in the first few minutes.  The pleasure of this darkly written, photographed, edited and scored film is in the acting and the collaboration Hodges requires of the viewer.  Less is more, here, and for those who enjoy film noir, this is a very strong movie.

Meanwhile, his younger brother, Davey (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is taking a taxi cab ride with an unlicenced driver (Tim Plester), but the cab is groovy inside.  When the cab stalls, Davey must foot it the rest of the way.  Boad (Malcolm McDowall) and his thugs come upon him and Boad sadomizes Davey.  Davey withers home the next morning in pain.

There are some very good performances, and the contrast between Clive Owen's character, Will Graham, and everyone else from the old neighborhood is fascinating. Will Graham is a character who has left his old life, not to start a new one, but to cut himself off completely from any life. He returns to find out why his younger brother killed himself. The ending, before he seeks his revenge, has a strange ritualistic quality that heightens the tension. In the final analysis, however, I didn't think that the story of Will's search for the reason for his brother's death was nearly as interesting as the story that takes place before the film begins - what happened to Will that led him to abandon everything and begin aimless travels in a beatup camper, spending most of his time by himself. His ex-lover, played by Charlotte Rampling, says he ""had a breakdown,"" but that doesn't provide any insight into what caused this stark, dramatic, and ultimately solitary disappearance from life.

848850,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002WZTJS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","The starting point for ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" happened years before this 2004 film begins when Will Graham (Clive Owen) decided to disappear.  We gather that in former times he was pretty high up in a crime organization and that the time came when he was sickened by either what he was doing or who he had become, so he walked away and disappeared.  He works as a laborer, but since he does not have papers gigs never last long.  From time to time he checks in with the brother the left behind, Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Being let go by his current employer, Will become concerned when he cannot reach Davey by phone, so he risks a trip home.  After all, he has a scraggly beard and does not look like the dapper gangster he used to be.  So he comes home and finds out that Davey killed himself.At first Will does not believe his brother would have committed suicide, and he gets the results of a second autopsy.  The forensic evidence suggests a surprising reason for why Davey would have slit his own throat.  We are surprised as well, even though we saw most of what happened to Davey.  It takes Will a while to digest this startling information, but once he does his quiet life as a forgotten man takes a back seat to finding out who is responsible for Davey's death and killing them.  His ex-girlfriend, Helen (Charlotte Rampling), begs him to just leave and disappear again and it seems to me that he is sort of willing to make a concession to her demands: he is only going to kill one man and one dog.  Not surprisingly, Helen is not pleased by the specificity of his kill list.That might not be possible, because once it is known in underworld circles that Will is back in town, that seems to start some ripples that could cause problems.  But Will is so methodical and so focused that there is an air of inevitability to his mission.  It is just that Will is so glacial in his anger and his actions that you can almost feel your pulse slow to match his heartbeat, and some of you are not going to like that.  No wonder this is a neo-noir in which the pivotal scenes are a pair of conversations rather than a gunfight or anything more exciting.  The first is when Will talks to the pathologist (John Surman) who explains what the evidence suggests happen to Davey before he killed himself.  Coroners and the like are almost always presented as being, to say the least, decidedly weird, but this guy is so straight forward and considerate in his detailing of the unsettling information that he constitutes a breath of fresh air.  Things were still moving too slowly at that point, but from that moment on I was interested in what was going to happen next.The second conversation is when Will finally comes face to face with the man he is going to kill.  Again, screenwriter Trevor Preston (""Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire"") and director Mike Hodges (""Black Rainbow"") come up with something a bit different, namely some honesty.  You have seen enough confrontations between the hero and the bad guy, and I am often reminded at such times of the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit where the James Bond villains do a seminar and they all agree at such moments just shut up and kill the guy (without using lasers or anything else that is to fancy).  So a direct conversation that cuts to the heart of the matter at hand is refreshing as well.  Finally, just because you make a specific threat does not mean that it is a binding contract.

The film takes an awfully long time to arrive at the main story, and once it does, produces very little of substance in its characters or themes.

His brief impressive appearance in Bourne Identity piqued my interest.  Well, his performance in this was not disappointing, but the movie overall sure was. It starts out well enough, drawing you in as you're trying to figure out why a series of events leads to a suicide. But then it quickly goes awry. Director Hodges apparently doesn't know quite how to edit or he simply cannot tell a clear story. He keeps us guessing about a number of details, which at first heightens the mystery and suspense.  But when the film has concluded and we still don't know some crucial facts, it leaves us wondering what really happened. What, after all, was he attempting to do?  For example, we're not really told enough about Owen's character to understand his relationship with the other main characters. Just as baffling, there are scenes along the way that seem to have no purpose- such as the one in which Owen is lumber-jacking. Then, the ending (??!!) is both abrupt and inexplicable- a murder and Charlotte Rampling still being held hostage.  What the ---?

That's why I watched `I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.' I know many critics praised it for its atmospheric photography and its ambiguous content that might or might not teach you something about existential meaning of our life even though you don't want to know existential meaning of life. All I can say safely here is that I almost slept during the long film that goes on and on as if played at half speed.`I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' is Mike Hodges's modern-day urban noir film featuring quiet guy Will (Owen) working in a forest, living in an old van. While Will has left the town (whose name is unspecified), his brother Davey (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is found dead in a bathtub.According to the well-known formula of crime novels and films, Will must search the truths behind his brother's strange death, and avenge it. Will, who has left the life of crime three years ago, is expected to be back in the business of killing before or after questioning the life he had been leading. The fact is, we are not sure of it here.Mike Hodges' film not only refuses to follow the course - that is not a problem for me - but also meanders too much with scene after scene, many of which only show and tell the very superfluous things like Charlotte Rampling suggesting that Will should leave the matter to the police, or leave the town immediately. Though the film takes time to get us to know the characters of Will, it never convinces us of the cause of the death, and the truths about it. Charlotte Rampling and Malcolm McDowell are both terribly wasted, particularly McDowell whose character's motive for doing what he did is simply laughable. Even Clive Owen, undeniably gifted actor, looks confines in formula-one acting up until ten minutes before the ending.There are many good things that would have made a better British noir in `I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' but the film never finds a way to use them effectively, relying too much on the moody cinematography and character study. The film got both of them, and I admit both are pretty good, but not good enough to make us forget its dull pace and pretentiousness.",2,Slow-Moving Modern Noir That Actually Made Me Sleep,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,2228,"['films', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'Croupier', 'fame', 'why', 'watched', ""'ll"", 'Sleep', 'When', ""'m"", 'Dead', 'know', 'many', 'critics', 'praised', 'atmospheric', 'photography', 'ambiguous', 'content', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'teach', 'something', 'existential', 'meaning', 'life', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'existential', 'meaning', 'life', 'can', 'say', 'safely', 'here', 'almost', 'slept', 'long', 'film', 'played', 'half', 'speed.', ""'ll"", 'Sleep', 'When', ""'m"", 'Dead', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'modern-day', 'urban', 'noir', 'film', 'featuring', 'quiet', 'guy', 'Will', 'Owen', 'working', 'forest', 'living', 'old', 'van', 'Will', 'left', 'town', 'name', 'unspecified', 'brother', 'Davey', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'found', 'dead', 'bathtub.According', 'well-known', 'formula', 'crime', 'novels', 'films', 'Will', 'must', 'search', 'truths', 'brother', 'strange', 'death', 'avenge', 'Will', 'who', 'left', 'life', 'crime', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'expected', 'be', 'back', 'business', 'killing', 'questioning', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'leading', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'Hodges', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'follow', 'course', 'not', 'problem', 'also', 'meanders', 'too', 'much', 'scene', 'scene', 'many', 'only', 'show', 'tell', 'very', 'superfluous', 'things', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'suggesting', 'Will', 'should', 'leave', 'matter', 'police', 'leave', 'town', 'immediately', 'film', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'Will', 'never', 'cause', 'death', 'truths', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'are', 'terribly', 'wasted', 'particularly', 'McDowell', 'character', 'motive', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'simply', 'laughable', 'Even', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'undeniably', 'gifted', 'actor', 'confines', 'formula-one', 'acting', 'up', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'British', 'noir', ""'ll"", 'Sleep', 'When', ""'m"", 'Dead', 'film', 'never', 'way', 'use', 'effectively', 'relying', 'too', 'much', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'got', 'admit', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'dull', 'pace', 'pretentiousness']",I'll Sleep When I'm Dead

In spite of ""Hamlet"" and other narratives you might name, revenge is never a noble motive. Yet this movie invites us to root for Clive Owen to take down the villain ""responsible"" for the suicide of his young drug-dealing brother (who is truly to blame is subject to conjecture). The pretentious script takes forever coming to a conclusion.The real mystery here is why such dependable actors, Clive Owen and the utterly wasted Charlotte Rampling among them, signed on to such a cold-blooded exercise. The movie looks good, perhaps because we spend more time looking at the screen than concentrating on what is happening. To help in this respect, you will want to click on the English subtitles; everyone in it is as soft-spoken as the movie itself is hard-hearted.",2,Good Writing Is the Best Revenge,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,873,"['tacky', 'title', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'British', 'thriller', 'absence', 'real', 'thrills', 'certainly', 'will', 'spite', 'Hamlet', 'other', 'narratives', 'might', 'name', 'revenge', 'never', 'noble', 'motive', 'movie', 'root', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'take', 'down', 'villain', 'responsible', 'suicide', 'young', 'drug-dealing', 'brother', 'who', 'truly', 'blame', 'subject', 'conjecture', 'pretentious', 'script', 'forever', 'coming', 'conclusion.The', 'real', 'mystery', 'here', 'why', 'such', 'dependable', 'actors', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'signed', 'such', 'cold-blooded', 'exercise', 'movie', 'good', 'perhaps', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'looking', 'screen', 'concentrating', 'what', 'happening', 'help', 'respect', 'will', 'want', 'click', 'English', 'subtitles', 'everyone', 'as', 'soft-spoken', 'movie', 'hard-hearted']",I'll Sleep When I'm Dead
