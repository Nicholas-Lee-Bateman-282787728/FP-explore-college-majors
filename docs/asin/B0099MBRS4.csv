(1964), Viewed: 1/14, Rate: 71/14: The most striking aspect of Seven Up! is how well spoken the 7 year olds were. They sound so much better than any ordinary kid in high school. Of course, my low rating for the film is attributed to a couple of factors. First, the filmmakers do not disclose what methodologies were used to pick the children nor the type of random sampling. Is this really a representation of the children of Britain? I'm not told of it. Second, the things the children say come fairly predictable. It's a bit boring to listen to. The behaviors are also predictable as well, but it's amusing that they were allowed to fight like that back then. However, I like the camera work, and it's very avant-garde. All in all, Seven Up! is the beginning of my journey into the Up Series, and I am looking forward to it.7 Plus Seven (1970), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 46/14: Three salient points come to my mind while watching 7 Plus Seven: how depressed they look, how full of themselves they sound, and how some of them refuse to look directly towards the camera. I was once 14, but I was never any of that nor did I see the behaviors in my peers. So, it must be England after all? At least Apted does the smart thing: constantly remind the audience who's who when retrospectively comparing the children's faces at age 7. All in all, hopefully it gets better in the next installment.21 Up (1977), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 36/14: 21 Up is more of the same as 7 Plus Seven: lots of repeated footage, mundane interviews, and dearth of profound insights. Among the interviewees, I found Bruce Balden's to be the most bizarre and the most awkward of them all. When Symon was asked for his strengths and weaknesses, I wish that he responded point blank, ""Well, I am dumb."" Meanwhile, I suspect a few of the others possess drug problems which will probably be a revelation in the later installments. Because a great many of them have poor diets, their skin appearance and hair look real bad and/or have lost the luster. The real criticism I have about the Up Series is that the audience only gets to see a snapshot of the interviewees' frames of mind at that particular time, but there is zero explanation of why or how they came as who they are throughout the seven years. If one knows, he can thoroughly understand the shaping. Another criticism of them is that I, just like the last installment, have no clue what the hell the interviewees are talking about. The three preppy boys are quite full of themselves and ride on a parade of conceit. Their vocabulary is extremely limited and repeatedly littered with ""sort of,"" ""quite,"" ""really,"" and ""anyway."" Finally, notice how each installment ends with ""Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man. This has been a glimpse of Britain's future."" I am going to paraphrase this as ""Give me a happy child until he is seven and I will give you the depressed (or f***ed up) man. This has been a glimpse of Britain's bleak future."" I honestly think all of that have a lot to do with living in England.28 Up (1984), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 96/14: 28 Up is a dramatic improvement over the last two installments. It's refreshing to see how much most of them have grown up and fully matured. However, the three snotty prep boys are still full of themselves. Not much to my surprise, two of them (oh come on, John...I wanted to hear your superior pearls of flaunty wisdom about a wealth of topics) have refused to appear for the show. Probably I identify with Neil the most and understand his lack of motivation in life; to me, it's due to his over-analysis about life when in fact he is an intelligent person and is highly capable of success if he can put his mind to it. That's why, in contrast, Tony, Symon, and Paul were able to lead fulfilling lives because they didn't think too much on a daily basis. During the interview with Symon, I was annoyed with the interviewer's prodding through questions because it was getting clear that he found Symon's perspective of life disappointing. The joint interview with the three women, who look considerably aged by at least fifteen years, is a bit strange to listen to; I wonder if there is a hidden, subtle message being conveyed across or maybe they want to explicitly say, ""Our lives suck."" What's nice about this installment, for a change, is that instead of lots of repeated footage, there are old footage that were previously unseen.35 Up (1991), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 36/14: Oh, how tired I am of the repeated footage that is, I might say, overwhelming. To use Symon's words, my mind is going dead. Already, I can safely say that I've memorized each of the participants' quotes when they were 7, 14, 21, and 28. If I hear ""greens"" one more time, I'll go crazy. Ah, John...how nice: he decided to be the shameless humanitarian by appearing on 35 Up after spurning the chance to show his smug face in the last installment, so he can bring attention to the plight of Bulgaria. Hence, is this a ploy for John to be given a lordship or be knighted by the Queen? As for everybody else, save for Neil, they have nicely immersed into plastic, mundane, and positively boring lifestyles. At this point, I feel ready to give up on the show because there is really nothing much to learn about anymore.42 Up (1998), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 26/14: Well, there is absolutely nothing new going on with most of the participants. The big reason why is that everybody is very reserved about themselves and doesn't see the need to reveal anything much, apart from the bland gist, to the public. But at least, good going for Bruce and Neil. They really did turn out well. Bruce is truly a role model and an example for all. Of course, as expected, John is too good of an aristocrat to appear in this installment. I truly treasure his quiet arrogance. Andrew finally shows his true colors, has come to a full circle, and is what I thought he was from the get go. At least, he shags a ""Yorkshire lass,"" whatever the hell it means. All in all, 42 Up is a real waste of my time.49 Up (2005), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 26/14: Once again, nothing new. Everybody is going through the motions, staying guarded as usual, and have become full-fledged stiffs. The interview with Jackie, a name I hadn't bothered knowing until now, is awkward to listen to. John comes back and is still the same seven year old twit. Suzy is one of the few that I haven't bothered commenting in the past reviews because I knew nothing was going to be different about her; in fact, her interview should be limited to 30 seconds since what's there to talk about? The strangest thing happened in this installment is that she got a bit more animated than usual about how she had these hurt feelings stirred up based on her past. Well, all I can say is, ""What?"" I watched each of the installments: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and now 49. And she was monotonously the same in every single one of them; in other words, we don't know anything at all about her except she was born into money, has a husband named Rupert, and has three children. All in all, 49 Up bored me to tears.56 Up (2012), Viewed: 6/14, Rate: 26/14: Again, the same as usual. After surviving 8 installments of the Up Series, I consider the experiment a failure. Sure, the concept is nice and should have worked out well, but the execution of it is incredibly poor. The time invested into this series is also incredible; this is literally 49 years in the making and continuing. Why did it fail? Because Michael Apted as the interviewer is the epitome of this. He doesn't ask the right questions, doesn't present a complete portrayal of the participants, and doesn't know how to interview properly. After 49 years, I honestly don't know these people. Why did I continue with the installments despite the negatives? It's the changes of their facial expressions which I found the most interesting. All in all, I don't care about the show anymore.",1,"Nice Concept, But Poorly Executed.",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,8100,"['***Note***', 'are', 'desperate', 'search', 'English', 'subtitles',

I thought the cardboard set up it came in was just a sampler,and I never read aheadon any series,so I just threw it in the drawer. Then I realized,I was not getting my dvd. As soon as I got here tonight,I recognized the same thing I threw in the drawer.Darn it..it just doesn't fit well with my series,both VHS and DVD.There is always something to gum up our treasures.. this series means a lot to me. I was in high school when this started.I am now 65 !!  Ok,a comment about the series.I am not a fan of going back in time and using it as a filler. That's all I will say about that.But the set is memerizing. If you out there haven't seen the series..it is mind boggling to me that I remember everythingabout that evening when this first came on. I was hooked immediately. My big black and white screen filled with those little faces,and that accent they talked with. Little did I know that that sophmore would still be watching at 65.

1589602,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0099MBRS4,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[17, 17]","Roger Ebert says it all in an interview with Michael Apted; this is a noble use of film. Ebert says this not to make this film sound like it is difficult to watch but describe how this is a unique piece of history, an emotional and entertaining look every seven years at a group of British children. In two hundred years historians will look at this work.The Up series started as a British Granada television program in 1963. Michael Apted chose 14 seven year old children from dramatically different backgrounds and interviewed them for a television series. The premise is 'Give Me the Child Until He Is Seven and I Will Show You the Man.' Although Apted may have never realized he signed on for a fifty some year project, he ended up interviewing as many members as possible every seven years. In the latest segment, they are all 56 years old and thirteen agreed to be filmed.56 Up stands by itself, somebody that has never seen any of the previous 7 year installments (going all the way back to when they were seven years old in 7 Up) will understand easily. This is the best installment in the series. Apted did a remarkable job keeping each child separate and he identifies what year the flashbacks come from with a subtle title in the lower right hand corner of the screen - 7 Up, 21 Up, 28 Up, etc. Each interview is built with backing clips from the previous years.Only one member refused to participate, Charles. I laughed at the piece with Peter Davies; he refused to be interviewed after one of the early episodes. He says in 56 Up that the publicity from his appearance was too much to take. It was bad and he did not want to go through that again (a number of tabloid pieces are shown to support what Peter says). What made me smile; he decided to participate this time to promote his band, The Good Intentions. The film comes full circle, in some ways taking advantage of each child, the child takes advantage of the film. (Someone Else's Time).I fell in love with this series and have followed along since 7Up (although I didn't watch the first installment when it was first released - I was only 6 years old). It is very difficult to figure out if I have matured right along with these people, I am one year younger than they are; or is this a truly remarkable piece of film that is independent the viewer's age. My wife tried to watch one of the early installments and hated the movie. She despises reality television. She is two years younger than the Up group. She absolutely loved this installment. She refused to get up during the entire two hours and twenty two minutes. I think that speaks volumes for how compelling this film is.Apted poses questions off camera; his voice is kind gentle and sometimes pushes buttons. Oddly, he is particularly difficult with Tony, the last member in the show. For some reason he has figured out Tony's buttons and pushes them liberally. I happened to like Tony the best of the whole group. He seems the most comfortable in his life and skin. He is happy, madly in love with his wife, and understands exactly how to be a grandfather. Although others were more successful from a monetary standpoint, it seems to me Tony was the most successful of them all.There is a wonderful sense of timing and storytelling in this film. Even though it is a documentary, Apted has brought in exactly the right story telling devices.The DVD includes a remarkable 24 minute interview of Apted by the late Roger Ebert. The interview took place shortly after 49 Up before Ebert fell ill. The two talk about what would happen if one of the members died. Apted, almost like a father, says he hopes he goes before any of the members. He hasn't fully figured out what to do in the event of a death. He also talks about how he kept politics out of the series. Lady Di was killed shortly before one of the installments. He asked each person about her death. In the end, he never included the footage because it was trivial, not the event, but the impact on each person was trivial. Each person lives or demonstrates their politics; he didn't need to ask each person to directly address their beliefs.The DVD is shipped in the best packaging I have ever seen for a DVD. It is an earth friendly simple cardboard folder, about the size of a paperback book. It provides excellent protection for thee DVD while using minimal packaging.Apted's filmography is remarkable; The World Is Not Enough, Nell, Gorillas In The Mist, Chronicles Of Narnia The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, and Gorky Park to name a few.

The English may dislike what has happened to their country but they haven't turned to murderous hate.The Eastenders are declaring the same problem in England as is happening in America - there are people on Welfare, being heavily subsidized who should not be.

1589604,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0099MBRS4,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[4, 4]","Despite who and what we are individually, we all have great lessons to learn about the ultimate shared experience we call `life.'  We live it differently, choosing to follow our separate paths, often ones that are dictated by beliefs, personal choices, and family upbringing.  Still, there are some `truths' we all consider universal - how we deal with challenges, changes, turbulence, and disappointment - and there's wisdom tightly packaged into any presentation of those individual moments.  For instance, I can learn a great deal about watching another person's reflections on how to best cope with the failure to achieve a dream or some grand quest.There's far more each of us ever shares in common that'll ever truly push us apart, and perhaps that's the greatest justice to Michael Apted's ongoing examination of several people's personal lives in his UP series of films.  His latest - 56 UP - is now available on home video, and it's definitely worth a review.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)There are no stars here, though there may be a few lesser celebrities.  What director Michael Apted has done with this group of British subjects - he started videotaping interviews with these participants at age 7, and then he's returned to speak with them further every seven years - is, no doubt, an amazing commitment on all of their parts.  In these discussions, they discuss everything - life, dreams, love, deaths, careers, hopes, aspirations, daily life, etc. - that might run the gamut of interest.  Apted puts his subjects to some meaty analysis of their experiences, trying to get to the heart of the human experience and what it means to live a life truly fulfilled.Much could be made about whether or not it's a truly enlightening experience.  How much change does a person endure in seven years?  How much wisdom might a man or a woman collect in such time?  How much change might come into a life?  Still, it's an amazing concept, especially when viewers are treated to the stories that helped shape these individuals every seven years, and it's one I'd encourage many folks - especially younger people - to seek out.  (This isn't to say us `old folks' don't have lessons to learn; rather, it's only to underscore that quite a bit of the incidental learning presented here is the stuff each of us experiences in our separate pursuits.)Apted and his subjects mostly appear comfortable with one another, but there are some instances wherein the requisite bitterness of disappointment and the `forced' celebrity status comes into focus.  As these productions aired on television locally, one man opted out of participating for several years due to the fact that he felt largely maligned by the presentation of what he said during an era of controversial politics.  However, with the passage of time and the collection of wisdom about phrasing things more safely, he's back, and it's these instances that I found truly inspiring.There's a lot in here.  At 138 minutes, I'd argue that it's possibly too long for a single viewing.  I'd rather 56 UP be trimmed to a lean and mean 120 minutes, but Apted might not be doing justice to all of his regulars if he did.  Still, there's quite a bit that felt repetitive; when it feels fresh and inviting, it's a delight.  And I've no doubt this project says quite a bit about basic human living, though I wouldn't dare try to pin it down to a single bullet point or even a few - there's far too much packed in here, and I'd end up doing a disservice to other finer points.56 UP is produced by ITV Studios.  DVD distribution is being handled through First Run Features.  As for the technical specifications, this is a documentary, and it's constructed with the best audio and video footage available (there's some graininess necessarily with some of the older footage, but it's hardly distracting).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's a grand, bold experiment indeed - taking time out once every seven years to check in on the continuing lives of men and women who've volunteered since age 7 to participate in such a study - one that visually captures the secrets of our most precious shared experience: life itself.  56 UP is amazingly prescient at presenting perhaps the oldest truth - life is never quite what we expect - but, if anything, it's possibly a bit overlong on those sentiments in order to captivate modern audiences who aren't all that drawn to highly personal stories any longer (except for the elites and academics amongst us).  The 138-minutes should've been trimmed down to 120, and I think it would've been a far more effective presentation.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at First Run Features provided me with an advance DVD screener of 56 UP by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,56 UP Is A Wonder To Behold,1372636800,"07 1,

1589605,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B0099MBRS4,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","If there is a comparable cinematic document in existence that chronicles the lives of individuals the way The UP Series does, I&#8217;m hard-pressed to think of it. No doubt there are imitators. A South African version is currently sitting at 21 UP, apparently. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.While The UP Series is unique, even more astounding is the fact that each film is a stand alone work of art in its own right. For our purposes, we will focus on 56 UP, the latest installment in the series.Roger Ebert, whose half hour, in-depth and intelligent interview with director Michael Apted is included in this DVD release, comes very close to articulating why this film (and the series) is so important. He states the series is &#8220;an inspired, almost noble use of the film medium.&#8221; If we define the word &#8220;noble&#8221; as something which is &#8220;admirable in dignity of conception, manner of expression, execution or composition,&#8221; then Ebert has hit the nail on the head.Virtually every invention in the history of the world has come to be as something to make life better, to make existence more meaningful, more pleasurable, more practical. Film is no exception. Like any great art form, film exists, ideally, to ennoble as well as to educate or entertain. Great art distinguishes mankind from the creatures around him. A reminder of the sacred act of creation (and, by extension, many would argue, cause for rumination on God), art is a gift mankind too often cheapens and undervalues, especially in the name of commerce and quick thrills. Witness any of the latest summer blockbusters in the local Cineplex.56 UP pulls us back into an awareness of art as the great provoker of thought, reflection, dialogue and understanding. The simplicity of the concept is astounding. Who would&#8217;ve had the thought to undertake such an experiment (for that is surely what it was, originally)? Who could&#8217;ve envisaged how a one-off film could inspire a series, a representational chronicle of lives, free from political correctness&#8212;arguably one of the key elements of its success?Many artists spend their whole lives in the pursuit of simplicity and director Apted, whether knowingly or not, has defined the template for documentary filmmaking. Just tell the story in the words of the participants. Don&#8217;t comment. Show, don&#8217;t tell.Apted&#8217;s great body of work extends far beyond the documentary genre. My favourite film of his is Amazing Grace, which portrays the life of William Wilberforce, who was predominantly responsible for the abolishment of slavery in the United Kingdom.There is a kind of amazing grace that permeates 56 UP. It is the grace which is defined as beauty of form, manner, motion, or action. The film is all of those things in its seamless representation of life. It is also a profound testimony to another definition of grace, namely, forgiveness. For to view the subjects under Apted&#8217;s filmic microscope is to witness humanity in breathtaking variation&#8212;and simplicity&#8212;full of hopes and dreams, success and failure, love and indifference, struggle and enjoyment.The genius of 56 UP is life itself.

1589606,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B0099MBRS4,K. Gordon,"[42, 42]","Personally, I would strongly suggest watching the films in order. While ""56 Up"" does provide some recaps,the cumulative effect of the series is built by watching each age in depth.The 'Up Series' represents one of the most fascinating and unusual uses of film in cinema history - adocumentary life-long chronicle of the lives of 14 people starting at 7 years old, revisiting them everyseven years through age 56 (so far). While I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there(especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasis on love and marriage at the expenseof all else), and by nature the later episodes sometimes have to speed through more than would be ideal,since they have to both catch the audience back up as well as moving the stories forward, no matter. It'sreally an astounding, moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watch thisremarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's own life, and how you have changed (andstayed the same) over your own lifetime.While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for this amazing piece of cultural anthropology,it's important to note the first film, 7 Up, was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was athat point a researcher for the project.This new episode is as excellent as it's predecessors, revealing more surprising twists in turns as ourgroup heads towards the end of mid-life, and stare into the realities of old age.  Some oldfriends re-appear, some have continued in directions they had been going in, and some havechanged course yet again.  One thing that's interesting, and more present in this episode than earlier onesare some of the subjects questioning the objectivity and 'reality' of the series.  There are interestingcases made that what we, the audience, sees isn't the truth of who these people are, but onlya created character.  It also (by proxy) makes one reflect on how much being in these films hasaffected the lives of the participants.

1589607,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B0099MBRS4,Mr. Mambo,"[4, 4]","I watched 56Up last week on my public television station here in Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, USA. I own the entire series, and have 'grown up' with it, watching it every seven years or so. First of all, I will admit that it is very hard for me to be overly critical of this series, simply because it is such a remarkable achievement. Nothing like it has ever been done. Furthermore, I have literally grown up with these British children/teens/young people....and now....they, like me, are in the latter stages of middle age, soon to become 'geezers'! In addition, I have always been fascinated by British life, history, music, movies and TV, literature and sport, and I devour everything I can get my hands on. Finally, I am a fan of the work of Michael Apted, who's directed every episode except the first, 7Up, from 1964 (he was a production assistant on that first film). He is without a doubt the greatest 'unknown' filmmaker who ever lived.Apted has worked for decades in British television and film, and has made many American films as well, including some greats (Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), Gorky Park ('83), Gorillas in the Mist ('88), Thunderheart ('92), some near-great (Continental Divide ('81), Class Action ('91), (Blink ('94), Nell ('96), Always Outnumbered ('98), Enigma ('01), Amazing Grace ('06), Chronicles of Narnia ('10), Chasing Mavericks (with Curtis Hanson, '12), and others. He even directed a James Bond blockbuster, The World is Not Enough ('99). In all of his 'Hollywood' films and other studio films done with 'name' actors, you can bet that you will be moved, enlightened and challenged by the characters and the situations. But even if he had not done any of those movies, I would still have great appreciation for him because of his wonderful documentary work....even apart from the groundbreaking ""Up"" series. One could showcase a genuinely fascinating, informative and entertaining Michael Apted Documentary Film Festival, which, besides ""Up"", would include films such as:-The Long Way Home ('89): saving children during the Holocaust and helping them reunite with family and friends);-Bring On the Night ('85): music film starring Sting, who is much, much more than a mere pop star;-Incident at Oglala ('92): incidents surrounding the conviction of Lakota tribal leader Leonard Peltier for the shooting deaths of two FBI agents at Pine Ridge, SD;-Moving the Mountain ('94): looks at the efforts and struggles of several young Chinese students living in an oppressive regime;-Inspirations ('97): tries to unlock the creative spark of seven visual and performance artists;-Me and Isaac Newton ('98): examines the ground-breaking work of seven scientists;-Married in America (first episode in '03, second in '06, ongoing): follows seven (Apted's lucky # must be 7!) couples in their married life;-The Power of the Game ('07): the powerful influence of soccer around the globe;Just this year he directed an episode of a great new TV series called Ray Donovan, starring Liev Schreiber, Jon Voight and Eddie Marsan. This is a terrific series about a 'fixer'--who happens to be a faithful husband and father--in LA who helps the rich and famous extricate themselves from some very nasty and sticky situations.Apted was born in 1941, which makes him 72, and he is still going strong. You can guess his political and philosophical leanings by looking at the subjects of his films. That is another reason I admire the man: he has a heart for the those who struggle against the odds, for those who buck the system, those who question authority. Many would probably consider him a bleeding-heart liberal. He would probably embrace the term.But back to 56Up: it's a great addition to the series. During each installment you would have to deal with a certain amount of exposition and repetition, to 'fill in' those who have not seen previous episodes, and this in itself is an art. Though it adds length to the current film, it's welcome, because even for those like myself, who've seen the entire series and are familiar with the characters, it helps to get caught up with some of the film friends you've not seen for seven years.This is the kind of show which has always generated interesting and probably, endless discussions and debates regarding class and race and the differences between growing up in England vs. the US. It really is the first ongoing reality TV show, isn't it? There is now, and has always been, huge publicity and notoriety regarding the 'stars' of the series, and you could certainly understand why these normal folks would want to opt out at some point.In 56Up, we get the chance to once again see Peter, who dropped out of the project at the age of 28, and now has reappeared. Peter was a teacher in 1992 and, in 28Up, voiced some mild criticism of the at-the-time Thatcher government. Because the film was so widely-seen, Peter's comments were trumpeted forth by the British press. The Tory papers ripped him apart and he became concerned about his ability to earn a living. Now he is back, as a musician, and is the leader of his own acoustic folk group. A cynic might say that he's timed his reappearance to help pump sales of his records, but so what? All of these people have been, in a sense, 'used', haven't they? They've paid a price to be in this show. Why not turn the tables a bit and use the notoriety you've gained for your own benefit?Symon was/is the only mixed race person in the series. In 1964 he and Paul--who eventually emigrated to Australia--were the only kids 'in care', meaning, foster care. Their humble beginnings certainly influenced the rest of their lives. Symon drives a forklift in a warehouse, has a bunch of kids from several wives, and is married to an educated woman who works with underprivileged kids. At one point Symon's wife ruefully says that Symon has plenty of brains and is severely underemployed. But he comes right out and says, ""I could have done much better but I was a lazy sod"", a comment which conservative viewers will surely point to and say, ""See, it's his own bloody fault!"". But Symon seems happy and is enjoying his life. Paul has spent most of his life in Australia and is still happily married to the bride of his youth.Back in '64, we had the amazing and incredible spectacle of three 7-yr. old British boys, clad in the traditional upper-class, public school garb of coat, tie, shorts and knee socks, announcing that, for fun, their reading consisted of The Financial Times, The London Observer, and so on. Two of the lads, John and Andrew--remember, these are 7-yr. olds--proclaim precisely in their posh accents, which schools they would attend, all the way up through university, and which line of work they would pursue! Their futures had all been planned out for them by their parents, which, in itself, has to be one of the biggest distinctions between the upper classes and the lower classes, perhaps even between the British upper classes and the American upper classes (I don't know, I'm not in the upper class!). What is even more amazing is that John and Andrew followed their parents' plans to the letter, and accomplished exactly what they said they would. Both went into law and did very, very well for themselves.Thinking back to the kids as 7-yr. olds, and listening to them speak, we found it all very cute and irresistible, with those British accents. But their speech was very telling as to how their futures would turn out. Those with the heavy Cockney accents did not go on to upper education; those with the ""King's English"" did....and their adult lives largely turned out the way you'd have thought.It's so easy to hate on the rich, but in this case, when we see that John and Andrew have grown up into kindly, responsible, married men,  you can't help but think well of them. However, there is a bit of a sticky moment when John, who has done much charitable work with the poor in Bulgaria, and perhaps feeling the sting of criticism for his aristocratic speech and social position, dares to delve into the very touchy subject of class and privilege. He protests that there really is not a class system anymore in England, and states that he did not come from money, that his mother had to work to support the family, and so on. But in the next scene, a flashback to 14Up, John and his classmates, clad in the traditional British hunting tweeds of the wealthy landed gentry, are shown assembling for a fox hunt. Is there a more inflammatory subject epitomizing the gulf between the English classes as foxhunting? I doubt it. Apted almost seemed to be hitting us over the head with the irony at this point. The idea of most of the other kids going foxhunting is preposterous.The three Cockney, East End girls (Jackie, Lynn and Suzanne) are shown at length. Suzanne, even though she does not have a university education and still speaks in the 'Bow Bells' dialect, manages a law school at a London university. Lynn has lost her job (working with physically-challenged children) due to cuts--current PM David Cameron is seen by the working classes as being cut from the same cloth as ""TBW"" (That Bloody Woman...Thatcher), and neither Lynn nor Jackie are in the best of health, but again, due to cuts, Jackie has to find work, even though she has rheumatoid arthritis and is a single grandmother caring for kids. Tony, the East End lad who once had aspired to be a jockey, became a cabbie in London, is still married to the same woman, and has a vacation home in Spain. He is very critical about those on welfare, and would be the equivalent of a blue-collar conservative here in the US. Neil was once homeless, and has had mental health issues. He's been involved in politics at the city and county level, and now ekes out a living as a church assistant. Though it is not mentioned in 56Up, Neil was helped by the kind-hearted Bruce, who, despite a wonderful education, chose to become a teacher in inner-city schools, a far cry from the upper class life he could have had. A cynic might ask the question: would Bruce have chosen the life of privilege if he had not been on the series? Did he take the more selfless road because he somehow wanted our approval, and would have been embarrassed and ashamed of making more self-serving or materialistic choices? I would say that he is truly a good man with a charitable spirit, and his participation in the series has not influenced his career path at all. But that is based only on the telling glimpses into Bruce's life.Suzy married ""well"" (meaning: she has never had to work outside the home), and lives a life of comparative leisure at a country estate. Oh, there is a lot of work in gardening and manicuring the lawn and trimming the hedges and keeping the country place up to snuff, but it's really all recreational, isn't it? She doesn't really 'have to' do any of it at all. The husband brings in the money, and plenty of it. The same holds true for the wife of Andrew. Does that sound harsh and critical? It is not my intention. Suzy seems to be a very nice and warm person, with a good marriage, with two nice sons. But you see the irony and the vast difference between her life and the lives of the three East End women, who all truly have to work, just to survive, who understand this, and who want jobs, but two of the three can't find jobs!One of the criticisms of the series by some of its own participants is that we only see brief glimpses of these lives, and only every seven years, so how accurate and complete a picture do we really get? Don't some of the participants 'come off' looking or sounding unfavorable? We are all sensitive of the impression we make. Even Nick, from a farm in the Yorkshire dales, who became--of all things--a nuclear physicist, and who left England to teach at UW-Madison, expresses chagrin at how he must look. But Nick is without doubt the person in the show who disproves the intractability of the English class system.Based upon the lives of the thirteen people currently participating in the series--I believe that the original number was twenty--we can make some observations on class, and I believe that these thoughts would hold true for Americans as well. It's hardly surprising. If your parents have college educations and advanced degrees, you are much more likely to achieve the same. If your parents earn plenty of money, and you don't completely screw things up, you will be much more likely to have plenty of money as well. And make no mistake: having money is better than not having money, at least, if you want to have choices regarding work, leisure, travel, material comforts, etc.. The rich can make choices and can determine the way their lives turn out; they have fashioned a degree of control over things. As with John and Andrew, they can plan for a specific future, and achieve it. The poor have fewer choices. In many cases, they are victims, which, of course, is a concept with which conservatives violently disgree. Conservatives tend to blame the poor for being poor, which, to me, is a dangerous oversimplification.The series is supposed to continue. It will be very interesting to see, as old age approaches, with the accompanying inevitable health issues, how the different folks handle things. In the US, it's a fact that the more money you have, the better health care you receive and the longer you live. Is it true in England as well? No doubt we will get a closer look into the British health care system. They have the National Health, open to all, correct? So does that mean that if both John and Symon have heart attacks and are hospitalized, will they both have access to the same degree of care? Something tells me no. As I said, a subject for endless discussion, and eager anticipation.",5,Nothing Like It...Ever,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,13756,"['watched', '56Up', 'last', 'week', 'public', 'television',

As someone of a similar age to these folks, it was rather emotional.  As with most of them, you do come to realize things that you will not achieve by this stage, and it can be a bit depressing.I actually had to stop watching partway through because it was a downer.  Most of the first few stories were pathetic losers, all divorced, many not working, most whining that they could not yet retire and that the government had cut pensions(which was done because so many folks in Britain were retiring so early on so big a pension that there were not enough folks working in the private sector to support them, not realizing that if the country goes bankrupt they would get nothing.  For God's sake, these folks are 56, not 65 or 70!!!)I am glad I came back because many of the folks later on the DVD were actually successful, even if they had regrets and unfulfilled dreams.  Most of these folks had worked hard and still worked hard.  Some may have been a bit more upper crust, but the show ended well with the story of a London cabby, hard working, successful and appropriately contemptuous of all the bums out there living on the dole and bankrupting society while folks like him are scrabbling to make a living.

I found this film '56 and Up', fascinating, moving and a terrific view of life as it unfolds.In 1964, British TV produced a film titled ""7 Up,""  and focused on the lives of 14 children. They sorted the participants into upper and working classes. Every seven years, the series has filmed many of the 14 who agreed to participate. This is the eighth film, ""56 Up."" The 14 participants are still alive. Some of the people grew close during the years, although some of the participants considered this documentary a mixed blessing.In the U.K., their faces are well known. We get to see them up close and personal. Their stories are all heart felt, filled with their joys and sadness. We see bits and pieces of their lives, every seven years, as they grow from childhood to adults. Most of the participants have happy lives, ups and downs. One participant, Neil, looks to be the most troubled. He had a seemingly happy childhood, but as he grew, something was wrong. He looked to be depressed, without goals, and was homeless at one time. He is now a local politician and is a canon in his Anglican Church. So, his life is OK, but he does not seem happy with his lot.We see a scientist at the University of Wisconsin and a man who dropped out of the series and isnow back, to promote his band. A woman without a college education, is now a head of the law college.'56 and Up', it a terrific film.

1589610,A2J2SJ6BH9OX9T,B0099MBRS4,"R. Harris ""Movie Buff""","[1, 1]","First Run Features did a great job in the transfer of 56 Up except for the audio. I heard a minor, random snapping sound on my copy in the complete Up Series edition so I ordered the 56 Up single disc version which is a different run and has different art on the disc. The replacement also had the same sound over the entire film. Someone told me they also heard the popping sound on their disc that they rented from Netflicks. I didn't see 56 Up in the theaters but I'm thinking the snapping might have been on the original soundtrack. If you notice the problem on your copy I figured out that the snapping sound is only on the left side so if you move all the sound to the right side speakers, the snapping sound entirely goes away. Overall, because of the minor problems I give 56 Up by itself 3 stars. I would say this should not stop anyone from watching/buying 56 Up, I still highly recommend the complete series.The 7 Up series is a fascinating study of human nature. My favorite episode is 21 Up because they really start to make good use of close ups and we begin to go deeper into their young adult lives. Suzy and Neil are the most fascinating to me and those two alone could have held my attention for the entire series. If you have never seen any of the episodes, you should consider watching them with some time in between each one. I would suggest watching one a week over 8 weeks and when doing so, think about how those who have been fans of these time capsules since the mid sixties have had to wait 7 years in between each new episode. The more time you have between each one, the more powerful they become.I would say that the 7 Up Series is one of the 10 all-time best dvd sets to ever be produced and is a must own for anyone who has a serious home video library. I can't see how anyone would go wrong in buying the complete set for $37.99 offered by Amazon, that's only $4.75 per episode. When this goes out of print (and it will go oop) the price of this set will skyrocket like it has in the past. So stop thinking about it and buy it. You will be glad you did.

1589611,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0099MBRS4,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","****1/2The ""Up"" documentary series comprises what is surely the most impressive longitudinal study ever committed to film. It is an obvious labor of love for director Michael Apted, who has remained faithful to the project - and to its participants - for close to fifty years now.It all began in 1964, when producers at Britain's Granada Television gathered together a group of seven-year-olds from all walks of life and interviewed them for a TV documentary entitled ""7Up,"" focused on the hopes and aspirations of these youngsters as they embarked on a long but uncertain journey into the future. Every seven years since, like clockwork, Apted has gone back to these individuals to take a peek into their lives, examining the paths they've taken and juxtaposing those youthful aspirations expressed in the original film with the realities of their lives as they've played themselves out. (The stunning contrast between the grainy black-and-white imagery of the first film and the hi- def clarity of the current interviews underlines the extraordinary length of time the series has already covered).In ""56Up,"" the eighth installment in the series, its subjects are leaving the confidence and security and general good health of middle age and just beginning to confront the realities of impending old age and contemplating an array of end-of-life issues (if not for themselves yet, at least for their parents). And it is for this reason that ""56Up"" is one of the most poignant and insightful entries in the series (and one imagines it will only get more poignant and insightful with each successive edition). All the major issues of marriage/divorce, career and parenthood seem to have long ago been settled for most of them, as they now concentrate on their roles as grandparents and life guides for their own adult children as they embark on their own lives and families. There's less nave hope expressed in this film and more of an acceptance of how life has turned out for the participants, though there is a marked lack of cynicism and pessimism in the way they speak about their lives. Of course, they're still young enough at this point to be physically active and fully engaged in their careers and their communities, but there's no denying that the prospect of that fast- approaching downward slope of life is weighing, at least to some degree, on these people's minds. Yet, even those who haven't yet achieved their ""ideal"" lives still haven't given up hope that they will one day find what it is they're looking for. For obvious reasons, it is this installment that most comprehensively captures the range of a lifetime, at least until ""63Up,"" ""70Up,"" etc., arrive on the scene in the lead-up to the foreordained conclusion of the series.It's clear from watching this jumble of clips from eight distinct periods of time that each stage of life contains a set of joys and concerns unique unto itself, a universal truth that this series, by its very nature, seems singularly equipped to illustrate. It's a bit like thumbing through - an admittedly disorganized - family photo album, but with insightful commentary from the individuals involved inserted along the way.One, perhaps unforeseen, thread that runs through this film involves the self-reflection on the part of some of the participants about their appearance in the series - the sometimes unwelcome notoriety it has brought to them and their lives, with at least one of them pulling out of the project for a time only to reconnect with it at this stage, after having come to terms with himself and grown confident in his own skin. A few even question the very value of the series itself, feeling that these brief glimpses into their lives every seven years fail to create anything close to a true portrait of their lives and of themselves as people - a concern that Apted deserves much credit for including in his final product. After all, these people, at seven years of age, did not exactly ask to become a part of this much-viewed series, and why SHOULD they want to be defined and represented by it? On the other hand, as one of the participants points out, the series really isn't about these particular individuals as much as it is about how, collectively, they serve as a sort of mirror in which the rest of us can see our own lives reflected.Yet, something indefinable and intangible keeps many of them coming back every seven years to open up and share at least a small part of their lives with us. And for that the world shall be eternally grateful.

Up"" films, I asked myself, ""Has it really been 28 years since I saw the first in this series of feature films released in the US?"". Yes, I guess it has been, but time passes quickly.I'll provide a bit of background on the film, but since my fellow Amazon reviewer, K. Gordon  has done a fine job, I will try not to repeat his comments.  His review is of the UK DVD version, which will not play on US DVD players. But Amazon always groups reviews of ALL formats of a film - and even combines remastered versions of films with the originals when it lists reviews.The ""Up"" series began in Britain as a one of the first reality shows (before they were called that) in 1964 as ""7 up"". The first film was directed by Paul Almond, but all subsequent ones (every seven years) have been done by Michael Apted (who was on the crew of the first one.). Though there was a film for years 7, 14, and 21, the first feature to hit the US movie screens was ""28 up"". The original lot of seven-year-old kids consisted of 20 - from various class systems in Britain. Every, subsequent ""episode"" features roughly 15 of of them. Some drop off and then come back. This time around we see Peter, who dropped out after ""28 Up"" but is back - basically to promote his rock band - the Good Intentions"". In fact quite a few of those in this episode talk about how the series as often infringed on their privacy. (More so than I remember in the past.).The film is long at nearly 2  hours, but that's partly because Apted uses clips from the previous seven films to make it easier for those catching up. But, honestly, the best way to see this series is from the beginning (well, from ""28 up"" onward. These are all available from First Run Features on DVD.I really enjoyed watching this and can highly recommend it. It should be out on DVD in a few months (again, from First Run Features) and- since Apted is now 72 years old, we can only hope that there will be a ""63 Up"" and more.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Latest update on one of the earliest ""reality TV"" series.
