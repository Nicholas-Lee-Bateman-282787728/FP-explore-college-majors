It's much longer than theatrical version however the sad thing is that the ending is still the same. Well the movie has a very well written story. I've seen people who claim otherwise, but I enjoyed very much. Great set of actors and nice special effects. Aliens were very well made. Compare to many movies with other aliens where they appear not clearly enough or just one to few times, in this movie you will take a very good look at them and they will appear often. As much as the title can sound hilarious at first, I regret thinking bad about it. It's a very nice entertaining movie that is not just all about action. It will keep you thinking. Of course opinions will be different, but I love this movie!

1394871,A34BUK6Q132V75,B004BDOF1C,Agnes,"[0, 2]","Before ever seeing a trailer for Cowboys & Aliens, I heard rumors of its existence, and once I saw the trailer, I was sure that it was a movie I wanted to see.  To put it lightly, I was extremely stoked to check this film out.  I am a huge action and sci-fi fan: Predator, Aliens, Serenity, Firefly, Star Wars films (and this does NOT include the newer ones with Hayden Christenson), T1 and T2...and it's not often that I wait for a movie to come out.  It's usually me grudgingly accompanying someone else to a movie they wanted to see; not the other way around.  With Cowboys & Aliens, the situation was reversed.  Unfortunately, (and isn't it always unfortunate to hock over the cash - especially with how expensive movies are now - and to be really excited and then tremendously disappointed?) what follows will be all the reasons why this movie earned only two stars from me.Enter Jack Lonergan, our mysterious main character, who has a rather serious dilemma: he just can't seem to remember who he is...Add to this the fact that he's got some high-tech hardware on his wrist that he can't remove (and he doesn't know where this came from) and that some less than hospitable townspeople aren't taking too kindly to this stranger's presence, and, of course, some aliens, and he has himself a big problem.The first action scene in the movie is awesome.  I've seen a lot of action, and I'm not easily impressed but this scene just blew me away.  I was sitting next to my brother, and we both just looked at one another and said whoa at the exact same time.  And this is where my compliments end.In my opinion, Cowboys & Aliens has a really neat concept.  The final product, though, is a less than spectacular experience.  Mysteries abound in this action/sci-fi, and they bombard the viewer, one after the other after the other.  So, the aliens are abducting people; I get that.  Of course, everyone wants to know why, viewers and characters alike.  And we also want to know what the aliens are after.  Why Earth?  Why in this area?  I see these things as valid questions.  But, amidst all of the explosions and whatnot, do we really need Jake Lonergan to have amnesia?  Do we need him to forget his entire life, name and once-occupation included?  This really isn't a finding oneself kind of movie.  And, for some reason, Daniel Craig doesn't give his best performance. This is one of the little plot points that I thought dragged the film down. Another involves Olivia Wilde's character.  In all honesty, I thought the plot revolving around her character was just plain laughable (despite the fact that she does a fairly well acting job).The thing about this movie is that I think it got bogged down with way too much.  I think the initial idea of aliens invading and attacking during the time of the old west is a neat idea, but I also think it's a very difficult thing to pull off.  The first mistake with Cowboys & Aliens was trying to make it more than it is.  I think that as a simple action/sci-fi without too many plot turns, it would have done a lot better onscreen.  As it is, though, even the later climactic battle seems goofy and a little too far-fetched to be believed.  Talk about incredible odds. To say more, I'd have to spoil a few things, so I'm going to stop there.I don't think Cowboys & Aliens is horrible, and maybe if I give it another try a couple of years from now, perhaps my feelings for it will have changed.  I would prefer to give it 2.5 stars, and can't quite bring myself to give it three, so I'm sticking to my guns - 2 stars for this one.  Cowboys & Aliens isn't so bad that I recommend skipping it, but it also isn't a movie that I'll recommend seeing either.",2,"Cowboys, Indians, and Aliens...Oh, my!",1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,3696,"['ever', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'heard', 'rumors', 'existence', 'once', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'put', 'lightly', 'was', 'extremely', 'stoked', 'check', 'film', 'am', 'huge', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'Predator', 'Aliens', 'Serenity', 'Firefly', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'NOT', 'include', 'newer', 'ones', 'Hayden', 'Christenson', 'T1', 'T2', 'not', 'often', 'wait', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'usually', 'grudgingly', 'accompanying', 'someone', 'else', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'situation', 'was', 'reversed', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'always', 'unfortunate', 'hock', 'cash', 'especially', 'how', 'expensive', 'movies', 'are', 'now', 'be', 'really', 'excited', 'then', 'tremendously', 'disappointed', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'earned', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'me.Enter', 'Jack', 'Lonergan', 'mysterious', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'rather', 'serious', 'dilemma', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'who', 'Add', 'fact', 'got', 'high-tech', 'hardware', 'wrist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remove', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'came', 'less', 'hospitable', 'townspeople', 'are', ""n't"", 'taking', 'too', 'kindly', 'stranger', 'presence', 'course', 'aliens', 'big', 'problem.The', 'first', 'action', 'scene', 'movie', 'awesome', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'action', ""'m"", 'not', 'easily', 'impressed', 'scene', 'just', 'blew', 'away', 'was', 'sitting', 'next', 'brother', 'just', 'looked', 'one', 'said', 'whoa', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'where', 'compliments', 'end.In', 'opinion', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'really', 'neat', 'concept', 'final', 'product', 'though', 'less', 'spectacular', 'experience', 'Mysteries', 'abound', 'action/sci-fi', 'bombard', 'viewer', 'one', 'other', 'other', 'So', 'aliens', 'are', 'abducting', 'people', 'get', 'course', 'everyone', 'know', 'why', 'viewers', 'characters', 'alike', 'also', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'aliens', 'are', 'Why', 'Earth', 'Why', 'area', 'see', 'things', 'valid', 'questions', 'amidst', 'explosions', 'whatnot', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'Jake', 'Lonergan', 'have', 'amnesia', 'Do', 'need', 'forget', 'entire', 'life', 'name', 'once-occupation', 'included', 'really', ""n't"", 'finding', 'kind', 'movie', 'reason', 'Daniel', 'Craig', ""n't"", 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'one', 'little', 'plot', 'points', 'thought', 'dragged', 'film', 'down', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'character', 'honesty', 'thought', 'plot', 'revolving', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'laughable', 'fact', 'fairly', 'well', 'acting', 'job', 'thing', 'movie', 'think', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'initial', 'idea', 'aliens', 'invading', 'attacking', 'time', 'old', 'west', 'neat', 'idea', 'also', 'think', 'very', 'difficult', 'thing', 'pull', 'off', 'first', 'mistake', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'think', 'simple', 'action/sci-fi', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'turns', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'onscreen', 'though', 'even', 'later', 'climactic', 'battle', 'goofy', 'little', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'be', 'believed', 'Talk', 'incredible', 'odds', 'say', 'more', ""'d"", 'have', 'spoil', 'few', 'things', ""'m"", 'going', 'stop', 'there.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'horrible', 'maybe', 'give', 'try', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'perhaps', 'feelings', 'will', 'have', 'changed', 'would', 'prefer', 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'give', 'three', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'guns', '2', 'stars', 'one', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'also', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'seeing']",Cowboys & Aliens

Too bad, then, that the actual film this describes turned out to be a flop. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys & Aliens is exactly the kind of genre mash-up that contemporary audiences eat up heartily; 007 himself plays a wandering stranger with no memory who stumbles into the New Mexico town of Absolution, only to find that the town's residents don't take too kindly to strangers. However, when a mysterious otherworldly menace begins an assault on the town, the stranger must team up with the local lawman to battle for humankind's survival. So what was the major problem here? I felt that, despite appealing performances from Craig and Ford, the film simply shifted its tone too abruptly and too often, never quite settling into a comfortable and effective groove.

Based on the graphic novel by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, this film, directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]), takes a 1950s B-movie idea and -- thanks to a great script (adapted by the writers behind TV's ""Lost""), great setting/cinematography, and great acting -- turns out one great summer action flick! The trio of Craig, Ford and Wilde each give spot-on performances. Next toSuper 8 (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)andTransformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy), ""Cowboys"" is one of the best action films of the summer. The ensemble is superb and all make intriguing characters. Underrated actors Adam Beach, Sam Rockwell and Clancy Brown (whose character gives one of the greatest contemporary explanations of God) shine as I was interested to know their pasts even more. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but, also, in a summer inundated with comic superhero movies, it's refreshing to see a comic adaptation where the hero is anti-hero and doesn't sport tights. The title may sound cheesy but it works (besides, what else could you call this film?). Nevertheless, there were a few parts that didn't work for me; but they were very few and far between. If anything, I just kept thinking while watching this: ""I can't wait for the next Bond film!"" Overall, the mix of western and sci-fi works well and I'm glad someone finally put it to film.

For an action/adventure film, there's remarkable little action and no real adventure.Being PG-13, it couldn't go all-out in a faithful depiction of the Old West, but it seems they only really pushed it so as to show off Olivia Wilde's buttcrack and a quick shot of a a guy with a big hole shot through the chest with an alien weapon, as everything else is virtually squeaky-clean, not a hint of racism or sexism, grit or grime, and an utterly blas&egrave; attitude from everyone but Sam Rockwell as the bartender ""Doc"".As the review in my local newspaper said, very little is devoted to ""why"" with regards to the alien, and far too much ""why"" with regards to Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan, played so stony and cold you don't give a damn about any of his problems.The characters are horribly one-dimensional and predictable, and there were so many instances in the film where not only me, but a large group of people, burst out laughing.  And not when the movie was being funny.Not going to spoil it, but the big ""revelation"" moment with Olivia Wilde's character caused some very loud and noticeable derisive laughter from many of us in the theater, and the moment with the alien that Jake had first met having a final standoff with him at the end was so hackneyed, it provoked chitters and groans.For a movie that felt so long and, by concept, seemed to be aiming for something big, it sure felt small, like a Syfy original movie with some big-name actors in it.But the absolute biggest plothole involves the aliens interacting with the people.  Not only is it never explained WHY the aliens are randomly abducting people, but as it turns out, their ultimate reason for coming to Earth, and their goal, not only has little to nothing to do with humans, but considering their technology, they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all!Considering how a clich&egrave;'d Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning, these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason.

When I first heard of it, I hated it.I'm not a fan of CGI, simply because 90% of it is cartoony and unconvicing to say the least.  This movie has its share, and some is decent, and the rest is baloony and exaggerated in terms of realism.  It seems as if they could get that right by now.  It's one reason why even though I have a 3-D capable 65"" TV, there has never been anything, including Avatar that I wanted to watch on it, although Avatar has some decent effects, I can't stand the grunt-millitary babble.The story turned out to be far more interesting and complex than I expected and the character development was good, overall.  The little kid made no sense.  Why do they insert little kids for no good reason where they are totally out of place!It actually parallels one of the more interesting ancient alien theories, in terms of another civilization using the inhabitants of Earth to mine gold.  The actual theory involves humans reengineered in paleolithic times into their current form with the specific purpose of supplying an alien society.  They were taught at least, higher mathmatics and engineering, which enabled them to build the wonders of the ancient world.  Remember, human cranial capacity has tripled in far less time than evolution would usually account for, and there is no good explanation for that fact.  The theory continues that what was given was taken away, or that humans simply devolved after they left, over the period of about 2,000 years, sinking into a mire of religious dogma and warring over silly causes and greed...a pattern that continues.  Remember, this isn't my theory.Anyway, the movie deserves a better title, and would have been more appealing with a name that didn't call to mind some silly 1950s B-Grade Sci-Fi excuse for entertainment.

1394899,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B004BDOF1C,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[6, 12]","This was a fun movie.  It was made more so by the restrained hand of the scriptwriter and the selective care of the director.  While it was an extremely improbable plot, and it would certainly have lent itself to complete kitsch or camp, it didn't seem to wander that direction at all.  It was played almost entirely straight like a classic western (a laHigh Noon (Collector's Edition),The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition), andShane) with just enough humor to break the tension in order to rekindle it to new heights later in the film.  Shakespeare would have been proud--Heck, Shakespeare would have had fun with the concept had it occurred to him!The story partakes of a bit of both sci-fi and the western, creating a sort of ""what if?"" ambiance.  It pits the grit of late 19th century Southwesterners intent on reclaiming their family memebers, dead or alive, or die trying against a higher tech race of aliens bent on taking over the planet--or at least its gold supply.  Though the weapons of the former are primitive by comparison to their enemies, their ability to bury their differences and risk their lives for a common goal is their strong suite.  Furthermore, it is ultimately not their vulnerability that counts but that of their alien enemies.  The aliens are at base no more immortal or immune to harm than humans are, and their apparent contempt for humans proves their undoing.The use of CGI in the film was admirably restrained.  In short it was never introduced to the point where it dominated the screen or the live actors on it.  The animated characters were there as the ""bad guys,"" not to impress us with the quality of computer graphics---with which even the elderly are probably more than familiar by now.The primary heroes were all consummate actors; Harrison Ford, who is very used to the concept of animation and blue screen techniques, seemed especially comfortable in his role, and Danial Craig was wonderful.  His deadpan affect was just what was needed in the role of anti-hero pressed into the service of mankind by circumstances.  I also appreciated the director's take on a well shaped derri&egrave;re framed by leather chaps!  The heroine, Olivia Wilde, was mysterious and engaging; her placement in a role of self sacrifice was moving; so often it is a male character that makes the ultimate sacrifice for human kind, making it seem as though women are either unwilling or incapable of doing so.  It was a good choice.  So was the fact that she did not return to give the film a standard ""happy ending.""

This is a mighty fine western. It has great respect for Indian people. I swear the story is very well written. All of the acting was great. There were some attempts to satisfy audience urges for resolution that could have been skipped, but I enjoyed the heck out of it. It was great to be... in the west. Daniel Craig was quite perfect. There was a wee too much beautiful bodies on display but that got us through the authentic dirty cowboys. Loads of authenticity that we don't usually get... such as blood caked on to clothing and difficult to separate from wound. Elegant Indian language. Even though we know it's not a true story... it is quite believable if you have room in your brain for the existence of critters from beyond the sky. There are many little familiar notes from classic films. High quality fun. This was an HBO broadcast... but I may buy the blu-ray because I would like to share it with grandkids in ultimate-mode. I swear I never heard a word about the movie. I just saw three minutes in the middle of the film... and set my machine to record the whole thing. I can imagine that this would be a movie that would demand a director's cut. I also failed to engage my super-sound. I should have done that. My wife hates westerns but she likes science fiction. She just won't come to my westerns. When I told her about the Indian people dealing with demons of the Third Kind, she was ready to roll. She loved it. It gave me the opportunity to put in a pitch for some of my favorite westerns... like Heaven's Gate... my all time favorite movie, in it's new Criterion edition.",5,A darn excellent Western,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1739,"['Serious', 'movie', 'viewer', 'am', 'Generally', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'mood', 'science', 'fiction', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'love', 'classic', 'westerns', 'mighty', 'fine', 'western', 'great', 'respect', 'Indian', 'people', 'swear', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'were', 'attempts', 'satisfy', 'audience', 'urges', 'resolution', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'skipped', 'enjoyed', 'heck', 'was', 'great', 'be', 'west', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'quite', 'perfect', 'was', 'wee', 'too', 'much', 'beautiful', 'bodies', 'display', 'got', 'authentic', 'dirty', 'cowboys', 'Loads', 'authenticity', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'get', 'such', 'blood', 'caked', 'clothing', 'difficult', 'separate', 'wound', 'Elegant', 'Indian', 'language', 'Even', 'know', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'quite', 'believable', 'have', 'room', 'brain', 'existence', 'critters', 'sky', 'are', 'many', 'little', 'familiar', 'notes', 'classic', 'films', 'High', 'quality', 'fun', 'was', 'HBO', 'broadcast', 'may', 'buy', 'blu-ray', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'grandkids', 'ultimate-mode', 'swear', 'never', 'heard', 'word', 'movie', 'just', 'saw', 'three', 'minutes', 'middle', 'film', 'set', 'machine', 'record', 'whole', 'thing', 'can', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'demand', 'director', 'cut', 'also', 'failed', 'engage', 'super-sound', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'wife', 'westerns', 'science', 'fiction', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'westerns', 'When', 'told', 'Indian', 'people', 'dealing', 'demons', 'Third', 'Kind', 'was', 'ready', 'roll', 'loved', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'put', 'pitch', 'favorite', 'westerns', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'new', 'Criterion', 'edition']",Cowboys & Aliens

I find five-star's of gushing adoration or 1-star of spewing vehemence to be much clearer view points to express. But this neutral zone of opinion can be hard to write a worthy narrative around. As I watch fellow reviewers leaving their excellent creative narrative/opinion of this film I am left wondering what can I possibly offer? And then I thought of Stan Winston.It was nice to see this movie did not lean solely on CGI for its creatures. There is generous usage of old fashioned practical effects puppets & animatronics to render up close interaction the alien &#34;speeders&#34;. You will see that these were accomplished by a company called &#34;Legacy Effects&#34;.The four founding partners that began this studio in 2008 were Shane Mahan, Alan Grant, John Rosengrant and Lindsay Macgowan. These creators had spent years learning their craft from and later supervising special effect projects for, the legendary &#34;Stan Winston Studios&#34;.In 2008 when founder Stan Winston passed away some found the formation of a company and the new moniker &#34;Legacy Effects&#34; to be a disrespectful attempt to distance them from being under the shadow of their former mentor. However, others found the usage &#34;Legacy&#34; in the new name to be possibly the co-founders way of honoring all the achievements that this wonderful cinematic make-up artist had contributed towards.

It sounded absolutely ridiculous and I had no idea how it was going to work. When I first saw the preview, it still seemed crazy, but giving a piece of alien technology to one of the cowboys seemed like a reasonable step to making this seem plausible....or at least as plausible as this scenario could be.The movie started out very promising and reminded me of what I've loved from Westerns in the past....great, gritty character and plot development with the rebel cowboy standing up for the oppressed citizen, but only so far as he sees fit. Sadly, I felt like some of that strong plot and character development fell by the wayside once the aliens appeared. Instead we were filled with a lot of flash in the pan action sequences which were fun but not as compelling as I would've liked.I really enjoyed both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in their roles. I especially loved the ""slow"" sequences with Harrison Ford as he interacted with some of his hired help or other cowboys searching for the aliens...one of my favorite scenes was when Harrison was talking with the young boy.Overall, this movie didn't set me up to expect too much out of it...and sadly, that's all it delivered.

I thought i was going to waste another $1.99 renting this movie, but as it turns out you shouldn't judge a MOVIE by it's TITLE. I loved the story the whole way through, the pace was steady throughout the entire movie and the cast was outstanding. My only point against this movie was how animalistic and hostile the Aliens were considering they are supposed to be intelligent enough to travel through space to get here. Hostile is fine but they acted more like cave men or apes, not intelligent creatures. Other than that it was a blast and i totally recommend watching this. It's hard to compare this movie to another, but let's just say that it was ALOT better than Battle: Los Angeles and I thought that Battle: Los Angeles was actually going to be good before i saw it........

Finally remembered this weekend and was a bit disappointed.  Maybe it was my fault for how I'd envisioned what line the plot would follow and I was not close.Of course it could have been the script that was disappointing (that's my guess).Casting was good and the actors seemed to execute exactly what the script requested.  However, to me, the script was sort of half-hearted and did not do a good enough job of explaining much about the aliens or exploring how the people of late 1800's would react to flying vehicles and aliens.  The script seemed to be trying too hard to capture the feel of the old westerns while pulling off a sci-fi movie at the same time and it was difficult for the two to co-exist.Probably the most interesting thing about the movie was that Clancy Brown was in it and I'd heard him voice Lex Luther in most of the DC animated T.V. series but never seen him acting in anything.  He was very smooth and comfortable in his role.  Good voice and best Lex Luther voice ever.If you like Daniel Craig and/or Harrison Ford (who probably had the best role in the movie), then this is worth watching; otherwise, it's a bit of a toss up.

1394960,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004BDOF1C,DanD,"[1, 2]","Let's get this straight right from the start: I cannot possibly write an unbiased review of this movie.  I was raised in the 90's, the son of parents raised in the 50's and 60's.  James Bond, STAR WARS, and Indiana Jones were instilled in me at an early age, as were the great sci-fi and western flicks of yesterday.  COWBOYS & ALIENS is basically the summation of all of my childhood fantasies.  Possibly, this applies to you as well.  If so, you'll know exactly where I'm coming from.But if it doesn't...well, you may still be in for a treat.  John Favreau pulls a few punches, but you don't really notice.  The film revolves around Jake Lonergan, a wanted criminal who awakes in the desert with no knowledge of who he is (when asked what he knows, he stoically replies: ""English"").  In town, Lonergan has a run-in with Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), a spoiled rich boy who loves to shoot his guns off.  Percy's ex-Confederate daddy (Ford) comes riding into town, with a bone to pick with Lonergan.  Unfortunately, a few aliens intervene, kidnapping some townsfolk, and the two foes must join forces to save the day.Make no mistake: cliches abound.  Favreau and company (there are eight credited screenwriters, not to mention the comic's creator) hit every major Western point; co-producer Ron Howard, in the bonus features, actually comments on how a good western strikes all of the major chords, which I would disagree with, but his fat wallet speaks louder than my empty checking account, so go figure.  (On a side note, it's interesting to hear John Favreau say that STAR WARS borrowed from western iconography; definitely gives some food for thought.)  Usually, cliches are a hindrance; when you're watching a film such as COWBOYS & ALIENS, you kind of expect them, and as such are willing to say, ""Okay, well, I saw this coming, so I can't complain much.""  That's not to say they're completely unnoticeable (note the lack of a star), but this is still a fun ride.This film has two stars: the special effects and the actors.  The effects are great; nothing ground-breaking, but this film isn't meant to be.  It's just fun.  The aliens are freaky and interesting; the explosions are cool; the violence is surprisingly gory in spots (almost detrimentally so, but not quite).  The film's greatest strength, however, lies in its actors; Favreau has dotted his film with a bunch of talented character actors.  Daniel Craig has done this thing many times before, which simply means he's damn good at it: he's got the tough-guy wit down pat, and adds a bit of an emotional touch where required (Craig is, after all, one of the best actors on the scene right now, make no mistake).  Harrison Ford, too, has carved his niche, though he gets to push past this in a couple scenes: for a little while, you're actually afraid of him, as his character isn't necessarily a nice guy.  He's grossly underused, however; this is Craig's vehicle, not Ford's.  The same goes for Olivia Wilde; her character is interesting (if predictable), and the actress is clearly up for a challenge, but she never gets to do much.  The supporting cast features Sam Rockwell as a bartender/doctor bent on rescuing his wife; Clancy Brown as a tough-as-nails preacher; Keith Carradine as a kind-but-tough sheriff; and an especially-good Paul Dano as the younger Dolarhyde.There are too many subplots that never get fully expanded; a whole lot of cliches that you see coming a mile away, and make no sense even within the context of the film; and everything runs on a bit too long.

1394965,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004BDOF1C,Dark Faerie Tales,"[4, 7]","Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesThe Review:Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford lead the cast of this science fiction western action epic and despite the crazy mixing of film genres, it's a good movie. Daniel Craig established himself as one of the most dynamic action stars of this decade when he was cast as the new James Bond in Casino Royale. Craig brought a unique, rougher edge and dynamism to the Bond role and carries that edginess over to his role as Jake Lonergan. Lonergan is an amnesiac anti-hero trying to solve the mystery of his lost memory as well as get to the bottom of the strange device attached to his wrist. Harrison Ford, despite being well into his sixties, still kicks butt as Woodrow Dolarhyde, Civil War veteran turned ornery cattle rancher. Ford's performance is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's performance in The Unforgiven. That's to say Dolarhyde has lost a few steps over the years, but has fought many more battles than the younger Jake Lonergan played by Craig. Dolarhyde has his share of character flaws, and apparently so does Lonergan. Craig shares the spotlight quite well with Ford, who is a legendary Hollywood action star.Cowboys & Aliens` plot is summed up by its title. As I try and put into writing why cowboys are fighting aliens the silliness of it all becomes apparent, but more is the fool anyone going to a movie with the words cowboys and aliens in the title expecting the next Memento. The cliff notes, and spoiler free version is that a hostile alien race is kidnapping humans ahead of their planned, full scaled invasion of earth. The aliens possess vastly superior technology to the barely industrialized Americans of the latter half of the nineteenth century. This simple set up sets the stage for some great action and a few nice plot twists. The movie never gets too bogged down in character development. We get just enough of Jake Lonergan's past via flash back's so that we can see his character's evolution from anti-hero to plain hero. Lonergan's moral development is highlighted by the inclusion of the town preacher played by Clancy Brown, who makes clear early on that he's ""seen good men do bad things and bad men do good things.""By film's end, you'll be treated to every type of action scene except a car chase. It threatens at times to be a bit much for any other movie without cowboys and aliens in the title. It's perfect summer movie fodder. It's great fun, with an uncomplicated plot, but simplicity works in its favor and it's greatly helped by the fact that it boasts two incredible talents in Craig and Ford. Recommended for anyone who wants to tune out and just enjoy a great action movie with a unique, if somewhat offbeat premise -- basically those of us who think a western would benefit from the presence of hostile extraterrestrials. In other words, those amongst us who like a little Cowboys with their aliens, or is that aliens with their cowboys?

It would be really easy for the whole SciFi/alien angle to overpower the western aspect and get stupid but it never did.  It's a movie that isn't supposed to work but did anyways.The acting was great, if Tron Legacy didn't do it for me already now I really have the hots for Olivia Wilde.The only thing I have trouble with in the entire movie is how few people recognized the main character.  If you have any idea how rural small communities work you would know at one or two people in town at the least would recognize the main character as soon as he walked in.  This is true of anyone with a house within one and maybe even two days riding distance, and this character's house was obviously within a days ride.  The lack of character recognition was a major plot point, but it really didn't work with him having a home close by.Now, for the Ultra Violet Digital copy aspect so many of you are interested in since it's new.It worked.There was some murky directions and uncertainty in my initial setup.  Let me clarify, you have to go to the Ultra Violet site to setup an account THEN you have to do the whole URL and number thing from the provided coupon.  One does link to the other, but it's not really clear.  After you register at the Ultra Violet site, then you register/redeem at Universals, THEN you log into a content providers site with a coupon code.  I chose Amazon because it's the only one I use.  I recall Vudu, iTunes and one other I don't recall being on the list.  I now have this movie not only on BluRay and DVD, but I also have it in my Amazon collection which is great, even if a meteorite strikes my apartment while I'm out I'll at least still have the digital copy.I'm a Linux user, I'm generally against DRM, but the whole store it on Amazon watch it online aspect isn't so bad, partially because it's OS agnostic.  Except for Android.  I can't play it on Android right now to save my soul.  There's a nifty PocketBlu app that's useless to me because it doesn't like the fact my phone is rooted.  I have a choice, I can have a rooted phone and have two days worth of battery, or I can put the original firmware back on, and have 12 hours worth of battery even if I don't actually use my phone because the spyware my provider installed is constantly transmitting and calling home with all sorts of privacy invasion.  So watching it from my phone is right out.  As for the second screen remote control awesomeness part of the app?  It doesn't work either.  I don't know if that's because it's rooted or it just doesn't work.  I know my network configuration is just fine because I can remote control my BluRay player with the LG app and I can do nifty DLNA/UPnP things with my player and other software on my phone.I wrote a really long review on the whole Ultra Violet thing on my Live Journal, but Amazon doesn't like for you to put links in reviews.  If you simply search for my name and Live Journal with a couple of extra key words I'm sure you can find it.I chose to base my review only on the movie and not the digital copy stuff because I was buying a movie, I consider the digital copy stuff as mostly a bonus feature, but make no mistake, I do not approve of the redemption expiration date on the digital copy.  If it's advertised as part of the package then it should work regardless of when you buy the package.  I buy movies that I know have sat in warehouses for three or four years based on the coupons inside all the time, that purchase depletes reserve inventory which moves the publisher closer to another release so the publisher profits no matter when I buy it.

Not bad as it turns out. Most of us would agree that although ""Indians"", as they  were back then, had a chance to make good money being killed in the movies, still, we have to move on to the ideas of this century not of the 19th. Aliens, give it a thought, who else can we vilify and kill before they kill us, except aliens. With political and economic interactions changing allies, enemies and neutrals (generally leaning one way or the other) so rapidly, in the time between starting the planning of a movie and its release, the enemy might well be a friend not to be maligned by the media.Putting history aside, how does it work.  Pretty well. There were some constraints on the film-makers. Given Harrison Ford's long history as a Good Guy, they had to see that he didn't come off as an Evil Guy would. He is still too much of a star for that. It is also harder (I think for most of us) to see monstrous aliens in the Native West than in the Cities and urbanized areas. Just a matter of being used to that natural target of aliens over the many decades now. All in all, for me, the adjustment wasn't too difficult, although I did find it impossible to make it a complete one. If you like Westerns, and have some imagination, I should think you could enjoy this as a light, not to be taken too seriously, cowboys and 'indians' film, with some adjustment necessary.  It is probably too much to ask that anyone who grew up when the West was really the West, will really accept the transformation fully. For others, its unpredictable. Alien film devotees will not be much impressed by these specimens, in the context of the action. They should have been much more effective in combat than they were shown to be.All in all, it is not a poor film, it is not a very good one, either. It falls into the category of unpredictable audience response. You might like it, as something you can watch for a couple of hours without having to think about what is happening, you might dislike it for not sticking to the format formed in centuries of America's love for the Western story.

There are too many holes in the story of the theatrical version. It was too short. Storylines were lost. Too many producers and directors are worried that they will let a story run too long and it will drag out. I can understand the concerns of the studio. It was mixing genres: western and science fiction. There was undoubtedly some concern that the film would be a dud. Why increase the chances with the long version? Unfortunately the long version was the complete film and worth four stars. The problem is finding the extended version. Right now it's available on Blu-Ray but I use DVDs. So I watch it on cable. When they sell a long version as a DVD I'll buy it. Hollywood must stop the worry about a film's time and ask itself a simple question.

1394992,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004BDOF1C,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","""Cowboys and Aliens"" is one of those movies you simply have to check out just because of the title. Even more so when you find out it stars Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford.Well, it isn't quite the awesomefest that the title would lead you to believe, but it is an entertaining Western-with-a-sci-fi-twist with some unexpected twists and a cast of magnificently talented actors. The aliens' reason for being on Earth is kind of flimsy, but if you can ignore that, then enjoy some energy-blasting action, creepy aliens and strong performances from ALMOST everybody.A man (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with no memory of who he is or how he got there. The only clues are a mysterious wound in his side, and a metal bracelet on his arm. After kicking bandit butt, he rides into the nearby town of Absolution and quickly gets arrested, since it turns out he's a wanted outlaw named Jake Lonergan, who's stolen gold and is suspected of murdering a prostitute.But his imprisonment is interrupted twice -- first by the dictatorial ex-soldier, Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford), and then by alien ships swooping in and kidnapping several people. Jake also discovers that his metal bracelet can fire blasts of energy that destroy one of the alien ships.So the remaining townsfolk (plus a dog) all set out to pursue the alien ships, and get their loved ones back. But a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde) eventually reveals that she has special knowledge of these aliens -- and the key to defeating them may lie in Lonergan's blocked memories. Can a bunch of cowboys and Indians take down a spaceship of roaring green aliens?I was expecting ""Cowboys and Aliens"" to be a tongue-in-cheek romp like the original graphic novel (which has nothing in common with the movie except... well, cowboys and aliens) or a fast-paced sci-fi flick. Well, it's actually neither -- director Jon Favreau instead makes it a Western that happens to be about cowboys vs. extraterrestrial monsters.This is paced and filmed as a Western movie, with lots of dusty rides through the desert that Favreau uses to flesh the characters out. But he keeps things from getting dull by plopping in a bunch of alien attacks -- a particularly nice one is a dank, rainy battle in an upside-down riverboat -- before the story suddenly switches gears in the last reel, turning into a solidly explosive sci-fi finale.The one big problem? The reason the aliens came to Earth is weak and contrived, and it doesn't explain why they keep going out of their way to kidnap humans. I guess it's... because they're evil?But the acting is mostly pretty awesome. Daniel Craig is effectively playing an outlaw James Bond, who is almost superhumanly cool, capable and badass even with his bare hands. He's so awesome that he can beat up whiny rich brats with a single move, without even bothering to look at them. Yeah, it's not much of an acting stretch, but Craig pulls it off well.Ford seems to be relishing getting to play a cranky, vicious old buzzard who constantly threatens and berates everyone around him, but learns a little something about the value of forgiveness. Clancy Brown is solid as a kindly preacher who serves as the film's moral center, and Sam Rockwell gives a simply magnificent, understated performance as Doc, a bartender whose wife has been kidnapped. You really feel that this guy's life is crumbling to dust, and that he's lost faith in everything.The one true acting dud? Noah Ringer. Please, stop letting this kid act -- he's effectively a blank wall for Ford to bounce character development off of. And since Adam Beach is also in this movie to develop Ford, he's also useless.""Cowboys and Aliens"" has some flaws, but overall it's an entertaining Western that happens to have lots of murderous aliens and excellent performances.

Well, my mistake. The end result is both a good western and a very credible sci-fi movie. So, out of an apparent weird mix came out an original movie under a plausible story line (Sorry, no spoiler, I will not go into the details of the plot).I really liked the performance of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. All three main actors have in common to be associated with their roles in previous serial movies or TV series, where they played the lead or a key role. In this movie they managed to deliver a performance quite different from the character we are used to, particularly Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. I think this is her first key role other than ""House"" in which you can appreciate the quality of her acting. I hope she gets more opportunities like this to show us her talent.As for the special effects, they are quite realistic, and it is notable that the insect-like aliens are not hidden with low lighting like in so many alien movies. The amazing thing is that the SFX are not based completely on computer animations (GCI). The film was shot using good old puppets and animatronics for the close-ups, combined with CGI for the battle scenes. Even some of the alien ships were scale models. My only quibble is that one of the alien features resembles a lot the character Kuato inTotal Recall(no spoiler again). My respects to director Jon Favreau, a great combination of old and new technology.As for the product, the package includes the BD, DVD and the codes to download a digital version, all for $19.99 (actually I pre-order with a higher price, but Amazon credited the savings to me).

What is a lot of science fiction but a Western with bigger and more sophisticated toys?This is a big, gooey, hot-fudge-sundae of a movie, complete with eye candy. A rough-and-tumble character (Daniel Craig, the Steve McQueen of this latter day, looking like he's just been salivating to sink his teeth into a Western role all his life) wakes up in the middle of the desert with no memory and a peculiar device sealed on his left arm, the properties of which he has no clue. He also has a nasty wound in his side. While he's trying to sort this out, miscreants chance upon him and discover that perhaps they should have just kept going, as he deals with their attempts to interfere with him in an almost offhand way, adopting their dog as he does. His efforts to mend his injury at a seemingly deserted homestead turns up his first ally, a crusty preacher (Clancy Brown, a great utility actor who continues to pop up in good roles over a score of years), who sews up the wound after determining that whatever else this man-with-no-name is, he's not a consummate evil. This brings the injured man into the realm of a small cowtown, where he makes friends and enemies, finds out at least what his name is - to his detriment - and is thrown together with the rest of the populace in finding a way to combat the aliens, when they come to town after dark.Great people are involved in this movie. The aforementioned Mr Craig, always watchable, is joined by that icon of American film, Harrison Ford (as a mean sumbitch called Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde, who runs the place because of his cattle baronry but who is inside just a big softy); a strong female lead (Olivia Wilde) as the mysterious Emma Swenson, good rider, good with a gun, and who packs a pretty mean wallop; Keith Carradine as the town's sheriff (I didn't recognize him at first); Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine, There Will Be Blood) as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's spoiled son; Sam Rockwell, as the town saloon owner/doctor, on the verge of packing it in and going somewhere else; and Adam Beach, as a young man Woodrow took in as a child. In the business end of things, there are some heavy hitters as well; Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, and Jon Favreau. With all this firepower, something good was bound to come out.Highly enjoyable from beginning to end, and adapted from a comic book, while the action takes on the spirit of a graphic story, the great technical effects and good acting make it realistic as well (as realistic as a movie with 9-foot ugly green aliens can be). Nothing dull here; the only part I found remotely unbelieveable was Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan calmly reclaiming a fighting force of thirty, formerly his gang, who have switched allegiance, by just ordering them about. I guess charisma is everything; I might be induced to do as I was told by Mr Craig, myself.This was not a wasted 2 hours. A lot of movies these days produce a lot of noise and action, but this one provided a lot of story as well, and one that wasn't difficult to follow. And it's good to see a Western again, even if it's got aliens as its motivation. There was a lot of heart here. A very good adaptation from a comic book, and it's plain that everybody involved was having a great time as well.Don't miss the bonus features. I'd already like to see it again.

Which was actually pretty surprising, since I cringed at the title...Cowboys and Aliens, are you kidding me?  Yet, I love Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, so I thought what the heck?Actually, this a fairly decent movie all things considered.  Daniel Craig's character, Jake, wakes up all alone and not knowing who he is.  Things rapidly go from bad to worse as he heads into town and finds he is a wanted man.  Harrison Ford's character, Col Dolarhyde, has a jerk for a son who also ends up in jail at the same time.  They are do to be shipped off for justice when...OMG, alien ships show up and ""lasso"" some of the townsfolk, stealing them for who knows what diabolical purpose.A possee is rounded up, headed by Col Dolarhyde and a reluctant Jake, who happens to have the only weapon known to bring down the bad guys, even if he doesn't know how he happened to end up with it.  Also included in the possee is a girl, a preacher, a kid, and a dog...and they later encounter outlaws and Native Americans.  There are gunfights and men and boys growing up and learning how to find their bravery in the face of terrible odds.  There is the wounded hero in Harrison Ford's character, who learns his own lessons along the way.  There is the love of gold.  There is honor and hope and hardship and a hint of humor and irony.  How much more Western can you get?Because this IS a Western, despite the aliens.  It also shows that, when the chips are down, human beings will band together against an outside threat no matter their previous differences.Daniel Craig does a great job in this as the stranger who has lost his way only to find it again.  Harrison Ford is even better, as the craggy old man who's seen too much death and betrayal, only to find he still has a heart of gold under it all.  The minor characters also have their own passages to undertake and it all meshes together along the way.This is not my favorite movie, I must admit.  But its not bad.

Cohen,"[0, 0]","Like ""Green Lantern,"" this film was one of the biggest flops of last summer and I frankly can't figure why (although since it was produced by Spielberg and Ron Howard, I am not about to lose any sleep crying over their financial loss.)  Basically the title says it all: a disparate group of cowboys, (led by amnesiac gunman Daniel Craig and hard-bitten ex-Army Colonel Harrison Ford,) outlaws and Indians attempt to rescue a group of various loved ones kidnapped by invading aliens.  The film is exciting whether as a science fiction fantasy or a traditional western with science fiction aspects.  I greatly enjoyed the film as a traditional western before the aliens even made an appearance.  I grew up loving westerns and still do.  Perhaps thats the reason this film tanked: today's young people just cannot relate to most westerns and stayed away in droves.  Thats my only explanation. The film has excellent performances from the two leads and a terrific supporting cast, great special effects and exciting action sequences.  What more could you ask?The blu-ray includes an extended version of the film (15 minutes) which I watched.  I frankly did not remember what the new scenes were.  Theres the usual""making of"" material (wherein most of the cast and producers fall all over themselves slobbering about the genius of the director, Jon Favreau.  Every ""making of"" segment on any DVD or blu-ray, whether the film is the biggest hit or biggest bomb, has one of these segments where the cast fall all over themselves proclaiming what a genius the director of the film is.  I guess every director today is the caliber of Hitchcock or John Ford.)  There are also very long interviews between Favreau and the cast and producers of the film. (I only watched the interview between him and Daniel Craig in its entirety.)The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are excellent.

1395023,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004BDOF1C,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","Scott Mitchell Rosenberg first devised this silly story as a comic book aka graphic novel - and it should have stayed in that format.  It is worrisome to note in the credits that the screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk: six cooks in one kitchen do not a successful meal create.  So we know from the start that this is a joke and as a joke it becomes entertaining in parts and just plain silly in others - sort of like a comic book...The `story' unfolds when a spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world. A stranger (Daniel Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been (excerpted from the package insert).Aside from Daniel Craig (still buff) and Harrison Ford (long in the tooth) the cast includes a lot of mechanical gooey multihanded and body compartmented aliens (identities withheld), Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, Abigal Spencer, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and a lot of other one-liner actors. It is all rather silly and over the top, but then that is the popular concept in epic films these days. You pays your money and you takes your choice.

Also, not physically possible strange appendages that either had a structural material (like bone) and little connective material or were all connective and little structural. The aliens had that stereotypic and borrowed gray look of menacing claws, teeth, extra appendages and run and jump like Cheetahs - sure! So I wonder what our carnivore aliens ate on the way over? ""Burgers in Space!"" take out. Usual alien baby growing pods to be blown up later. The people who make these things up must have never graduated from high school and want to de-educate the viewing public down to their level.Space Ship: Typical vehicle which defies the laws of physics in mass, size, material, external decoration and worst of all still used chemical propulsion which incidentally would take the equivalent of the Earth's mass as energy to propel and take 50,000 years from any reasonably nearby star. How it buried itself two thirds into the earth invoked incredulity. Looks good, though.Robot mini space ships: Like the aliens had another familiar look - flying dragonflies that somehow could carry a 400meters of cable and lasso people to haul them in with no ill physical effects on the captives.Cowboys & Natives: Bar fights, street duels and Natives acting like a '50s western hostile all add up to the worst collection of stereotyped characterizations seen since aliens became the popular bad-ass also around the '50s.Plot: Aliens came all this way to find gold! First of all, they could find it a whole lot easier by just collecting it in the dust of interstellar space or asteroids. Second, they could have found most of it at banks, especially on the East Coast, and not in a desert. Never was explained why gold was the goal. Too many inconsistencies in the plot such as fighting the aliens in the open next to the armed space craft and not force them to chase up steep canyon walls where the advantage is always to the higher positioned. What the alien girl really looked like as well as her story - as abrupt as it was. She certainly took the correct form to sell a film. The alien examination of people had the usual 18th century look with, the standard Hollywood effect - laser scalpels. The reason given was to explore for weaknesses. Must not be very bright if they needed so many to cut open. Anyway, why aliens with that technology would need to worry about human weaknesses is beyond logic.Summary: The translation of the comic book idea into a movie script was too quickly and poorly executed and too reliant on directors and effects people stuck in the same old, but admittedly still sells, rut.

The movie is actually entertaining even if it didn't quite hit at the box office.One reason might be that Daniel Craig (who comes across as a tough-as-boots Wild West James Bond here and is practically the same character) wasn't quite the most commercial choice for this vehicle.  In another world, it might have been Brendan Fraser, Robert Downey, The Rock or Vin Diesel.  Craig does a great job as a man in search of his past, but his hard edged Clint Eastwood with flashbacks doesn't quite cut the heroic figure we want to root for.Neither is the show an Alien vs. Predator suspense filled green gore fest.  The aliens are passable but not scary, so that might explain how the execution didn't fly.  It either needed to be ALIEN adult themed project or a family friendly Cowboy film.  It ends up being a bit of both.  There are inconsistencies as to how to kill the alien in the show - and I won't go into spoilers here - but you will get over this as you suspend belief or not!The concept works for the most part as an ensemble piece:  Harrison Ford finds his groove as the war-hardened Colonel and Olivia Wilde is fetching as the mysterious damsel.

It's a lukewarm effort, COWBOYS & ALIENS, a sci-fi horse opera that kicks its intriguing premise to the curb. Jon Favreau, dude... &iquest;Que paso hombre?Is it that too many cooks are in this kitchen? The script, treated like a frisbee, was tossed around amongst Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and there's always worry when you have that many script wranglers in the mix. It surely did not help that the eventually better-reviewed (yet lesser budgeted) ATTACK THE BLOCK debuted at the box office on the same day, never mind that COWBOYS & ALIENS, going into it, had garnered more fanfare.Props to Daniel Craig for a really good performance, and with a bang-on American accent, to boot. He brings to the table his patented coiled physicality and a certain quiet swagger that lends itself well to the oater genre. And, as usual, he's not exactly a fount of blabbety-blab. Dude is stoic. He plays a scruffed-up stranger who gallops into the dusty desert town of Absolution, New Mexico. The man has no memory of his past and he's got this odd metal shackle circling his wrist. From his waking up in the desert to the run-in with some rough hooligans to his arrival in Absolution, it's all good. Those scenes had me anticipating a good time at the movies.And then the other cast members shuffle in, and the central casting department must be empty as heck, because all the stock characters have surfaced onscreen here. There's the gun-toting preacher (Clancy Brown) and the sort of wimpy doctor (Sam Rockwell) whose wife insists that he has nothing to prove (meaning that he does) and the little boy who you keep expecting, at any moment, to yell out ""Shane! Come back!"" Olivia Wilde brings the sexy but elicits endless bemused expressions from me, and, worse, she doesn't even get buck nekkid as may have been hinted in certain promos. She plays a mysterious gal named Ella who claims to know something about the brusque stranger with the lunky metal bracelet. She strolls with a gun belt on, so we realize that she's far from a damsel in distress. Until later on, when she becomes a damsel in distress. There's a reveal about her which, again, bemused expression.There's half a mo when I thought Harrison Ford's character, awesomely, would be a straight-out villain. That would've been an interesting twist for Ford. But, it turns out, his despotic Colonel Dolarhyde is merely misunderstood, that it only required a scared little boy to soften him up. I really expected something grander from this big name ensemble, instead of this pedestrian outcome.The grizzled town sheriff (Keith Carradine) learns that it takes more than a mere ""Reach for the sky, mister!"" to cow the stranger who had just braced and bruised the bullying son of the town's principal benefactor, who happens to be influential cattle baron, Colonel Dolarhyde. And since the Colonel's son had just shot up a sheriff's deputy, he also sees the guts of a jail cell. But, look, here comes the ruthless Colonel Dolarhyde, bent on springing his wastrel offspring. So far, the plot is unfolding in generic western form.But before things could go full-on RIO BRAVO, alien vessels streak out of the sky and begin raining destruction onto Absolution, a town that just got even more dusty. Grappling harnessy hook-thingees project out of these vessels and ensnare random townspeople, and this may be when the film achieves its most electrifying moment, as these caught victims rapidly dwindle into these tiny dots in the sky, all flown away. This is around when the stranger realizes what his wrist shackle is truly capable of. I wish then that the film had focused more on the reactions of loss from those left behind. ""Doc"" is the most visibly affected, his wife one of those abducted. The rest seem all gung-ho to form a rescue posse, bypassing any modicum of devastated grief. I understand that you have to keep things moving, but the result is that I wasn't as invested in these characters. Because if they don't give a what, then why should I?COWBOYS & ALIENS does have some spiffy action sequences, the highlight of which is the big showdown between the search party - composed of cowboys, Apaches, and badmen - and the savage aliens. But clogging up chunks of the narrative are these long-winded, lethargic moments. I just can't get past the clunkiness. Not to mention, the big bad aliens themselves may look good but their motivation is strictly by-the-numbers stuff. Not counting Daniel Craig, the performances of the cast members (even Harrison Ford) come off as rote. The western stereotypes pile up, and not even the sci-fi injection can ultimately bump it up. So, I say, check this out when it's on cable because what Daniel Craig does here is worth watching. But what I really recommend is the graphic novel this film was based on. And, also, ATTACK THE BLOCK, if you're hankering for a more spirited and creative sci-fi thriller.",3,cowboys and aliens and bits of yawning and my leg falling asleep,1337299200,"05 18,

That idea is intriguing to many who believe &#34;they're out there&#34; or they might be out there, and they've been here before... just waiting for our civilization to mature, or looking for some essential resource growing scarce on their home planet.  So, we have a very unusual twist for a plot.  But they blew it in the script and the screenplay.Why, WHY did they have to create the extra-terrestrials as the trite, super-ugly, drooling, fanged MONSTERS that walk around like fast-paced gorillas?  And why did they create their space vehicle as some ultra cumbersome looking thing that seems utterly unimaginable as something futuristic that might even fly?  That whole part of this move completely degrades the other part where some very fine actors - Craig and Harrison - likely then in need of work, do quite well.  In this day and age of almost anything possible with computer graphics and special effects, you'd think they'd create the aliens as more believable than the silly creatures they came up with.  Great to frighten young teenagers, but sadly unbecoming of what could have been done with this side of the story.Recall the first production of &#34;War of the Worlds.&#34;  There was far more sophistication there, so many years ago, on the alien side of things, than in this piece.

A man, Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig), wakes up and finds himself in the middle of a nowhere desert in Arizona Territory. All he sees around him is a picture of a woman and a rock. He is wearing a wristband contraption. He tries to use the rock to get it off his wrist. Three horsemen come up to him and order him to start walking into town. he takes all three of them down.Well now, he has new clothes, a hat, a gun and a horse to ride into town. And a dog wagging his tail.Not everyone is friendly with him. He is a stranger in these parts and like every western, he has to fight and prove how much of a cowboy he is.He finds out he is a Wanted man. Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) comes into town to help his son, Percy (Paul Dano). By the way, Woodrow doesn't like being called a ""Colonel"". Suddenly, something appears in the dark sky. Jake's wristband thing begins to light up. Lights of something are flying low coming into the center of the town.

1395054,A3JBLXCH954NMV,B004BDOF1C,"Jared M. Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[1, 2]","When this movie was first announced, a lot of people were expecting it to flop because of its title, because, well, it does seem dumb at first. But honestly, how better to name a movie based on its plot? But, happily, there is so much more to Cowboys & Aliens than just aliens battling Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. When a man wakes up with no memory of who he is or why he's in the small town of Absolution, with a strange metal bracelet on his wrist, he seeks out answers, only to be arrested for being the famous criminal Jake Lonergan. But, when he meets a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde), things pick up speed. Col. William Dolarhyde shows up to collect Lonergan, only to be attacked by aliens, along with the rest of the town. Then, they must team together to find out what these beings want, and why some of the citizens were captured.Directed by Jon Favreau, who brought us Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens is an adaptation of the Platinum Comics story of the same name. Some might go into it thinking they're gonna see a mindless, action-packed thrill ride, but it actually is more character-driven and complex than that. Harrison Ford's Dolarhyde is easily his best character since Deckard from Blade Runner (after Indiana Jones and Han Solo). A man scarred by battle and death, he does what he can to keep his reputation up, and his son out of trouble, who is captured by the creatures. Daniel Craig's Lonergan is partly the classic Western hero, bearing resemblance to Eastwood's ""Man with No Name,"" but also more modern characters too. Olivia Wilde's character, Ella, is really good too, there being more to her than meets the eye. When the movie first starts, it doesn't feel like a Western/Sci-fi hybrid, but a straight-up Western for the first ten minutes. Jon's directing here definitely shows his skill, and improvement into being a great Hollywood director. The script, with five writers attached, was actually very impressive. While the third act had some of the standard fight and battle scenes any action/sci-fi blockbuster usually comes with, it does feel more satisfying than most, as the conflict is resolved without any Deus Ex Machina scenarios or clich&eacute;s. Plus, the characters (as said before) are very well-written, and very likable. There are, of course, some cheesy parts and goofy moments, but what damn good blockbuster doesn't have them? The visual effects were incredible, and I have no clue why they weren't given the Oscar nomination (Hugo was nothing compared to this, even if it was a good movie). The cinematography was great, as well, showing off the Old West in a very big way, paying homage to the older westerns. Then, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was just spectacular. It has both Western elements and great emotional investment, bringing heart and soul into the violent chaos.In the end, Cowboys & Aliens is not for everyone, but is a well-made movie that must be seen by sci-fi, action and western fans. Even the comedy here is well-written. It's sad that this was a flop, because, if it wasn't for the stupidity of ""judging a book by its cover,"" we might have gotten a sequel because, how the movie was given to us, it was possible.4.5/5 Stars",5,"A Well-Made, Action-Packed Blockbuster",1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,3209,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'flop', 'title', 'well', 'seem', 'dumb', 'first', 'honestly', 'how', 'better', 'name', 'movie', 'based', 'plot', 'happily', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'just', 'aliens', 'battling', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'When', 'man', 'up', 'memory', 'who', 'why', 'small', 'town', 'Absolution', 'strange', 'metal', 'bracelet', 'wrist', 'out', 'answers', 'only', 'be', 'arrested', 'being', 'famous', 'criminal', 'Jake', 'Lonergan', 'when', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'Col.', 'William', 'Dolarhyde', 'up', 'collect', 'Lonergan', 'only', 'be', 'attacked', 'aliens', 'rest', 'town', 'Then', 'must', 'team', 'together', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'beings', 'want', 'why', 'citizens', 'were', 'captured.Directed', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'who', 'brought', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'adaptation', 'Platinum', 'Comics', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'might', 'go', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'gon', 'see', 'mindless', 'action-packed', 'thrill', 'ride', 'actually', 'more', 'character-driven', 'complex', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Dolarhyde', 'easily', 'best', 'character', 'Deckard', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Han', 'Solo', 'man', 'scarred', 'battle', 'death', 'what', 'can', 'keep', 'reputation', 'up', 'son', 'trouble', 'who', 'captured', 'creatures', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Lonergan', 'partly', 'classic', 'Western', 'hero', 'bearing', 'resemblance', 'Eastwood', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'also', 'more', 'modern', 'characters', 'too', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'character', 'Ella', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'being', 'more', 'eye', 'When', 'movie', 'first', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Western/Sci-fi', 'hybrid', 'straight-up', 'Western', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Jon', 'directing', 'here', 'definitely', 'skill', 'improvement', 'being', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'script', 'five', 'writers', 'attached', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'impressive', 'third', 'act', 'had', 'standard', 'fight', 'battle', 'scenes', 'action/sci-fi', 'blockbuster', 'usually', 'feel', 'more', 'satisfying', 'most', 'conflict', 'resolved', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'scenarios', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'Plus', 'characters', 'said', 'are', 'very', 'well-written', 'very', 'likable', 'are', 'course', 'cheesy', 'parts', 'goofy', 'moments', 'what', 'damn', 'good', 'blockbuster', ""n't"", 'have', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'incredible', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Hugo', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'even', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'off', 'Old', 'West', 'very', 'big', 'way', 'paying', 'homage', 'older', 'westerns', 'Then', 'musical', 'score', 'Harry', 'Gregson-Williams', 'was', 'just', 'spectacular', 'Western', 'elements', 'great', 'emotional', 'investment', 'bringing', 'heart', 'soul', 'violent', 'chaos.In', 'end', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'not', 'everyone', 'well-made', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'western', 'fans', 'Even', 'comedy', 'here', 'well-written', 'sad', 'was', 'flop', 'was', ""n't"", 'stupidity', 'judging', 'book', 'cover', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'sequel', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'was', 'possible.4.5/5', 'Stars']",Cowboys & Aliens

However, although it is pure schlock, it's very well done and surprisingly enjoyable. The atmosphere of the old West (or perhaps more accurately the atmosphere of movies about the old West) is captured in the opening sequences when a cowboy named Lonergan wakes up in the desert, and apart from Lonergan's unusual bracelet it looks like a Western of the 'misunderstood bad guy' type. Daniel Craig is the epitome of the hard-drinking villain with a heart of gold and no memory of who he is and what he has done and the ruffians and townsfolk he encounters look and sound authentic.Then the trouble starts, with mysterious lights, explosions and ultimately attacks from (literally) out of nowhere, causing a number of supporting actors to fly up in the air, hooked like trout, and disappear attached to flying machines resembling giant invertebrates. After a perfunctory ""What the heck was that?"" the rugged Westerners set out to track down the abductors of their loved ones, aided by a kid, a dog and an enigmatic woman (Olivia Wilde) whose simple rural outfit is offset by her expensive Hollywood teeth. The showdown on the Mesa has the cowboys and Indians fighting on the same side against a common enemy. The kid and the woman (though not so much the dog, to my surprise) have a chance to show what they are made of, and the grizzled old rancher (Harrison Ford) develops a new respect for those of different ethnicity provided, of course, that they come from the same planet. There's happiness and sadness in the ending and a bit of good old Western philosophy, too.All this, and the biggest lava lamps you've ever seen.

Essentially they were popcorn movies designed to entertain with fast paced action and I am very pleased to say that this Sci-Fi take on the genre is a heap of fun as well.Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are great as the gruff and tough Westerners and the supporting task is fine too as assorted parsons, bartenders, sheriffs, outlaws and Apaches. It is refreshingly focused on the action, with the romantic elements very much played down. I enjoyed the fist-fights and the great scenery. The aliens are suitably villainous (you can tell they're bad even though they don't have black hats - or any other clothes for that matter), though they did appear a bit too super-powered for the standard Western weapons to deal with. Things are evened up of course with Craig's mysterious bracelet. He uses it liberally too. Indeed, no one really holds back and the climax is quite the kill-fest.The film also has some blokey chuckles and some eye-candy in the lead actress. There are a couple of nice emotional touches at the end but the highlight for me was the full-blooded tone that was taken with the action.

After all, if there are space aliens, they could just as well invade Arizona in the 19th century as Manhattan in the twenty-first.  In fact, the main interest of this film comes from using the idea that alien space invaders attach Arizona in the 1870s as a rationale for combining the two most sharply defined genres in cinema: the Western and the Invasion from Space sci-fi film.  The idea more or less works, mainly because everyone involved takes it so seriously:  if anyone cracked a smile, the whole thing would dissolve into guffaws.  The result is a watchable couple of hours of slickly produced entertainment, which combines the usual set-pieces of both genres in ways that are potentially interesting but never quite seem to engage each other.  The special effects are state of the art, but the acting is a mixed bag.  Daniel Craig is one of those actors who plays pretty much the same character in every film, and he lives up to expectation here as the desperado who escaped abduction by the aliens to play a mysterious role in battling them.  Harrison Ford as his enemy and ally has a more interesting role as the typical Western powerful rancher bad guy:  he starts off as a complete villain, but gradually develops into a more sympathetic character.  As for Olivia Wilde as the mysterious spooky female lead, well, let's just say she belongs to the ""Stand-There-And-Open-And-Close-Your-Mouth"" school of acting.Recommended for fans of the lead actors or students of cinema genres.  Advisories: lots of not too graphic violence, some foul language, one mild semi-nude scene; the vividly slimy aliens may be frightening to younger children.

1395088,A3R7MXVQRGGIQ9,B004BDOF1C,"Joseph J. Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[1, 1]","Like many movie fans I love westerns and science fiction themes.  This is the first movie that I have seen which combines everything a western movie should have with a science fiction theme.  I saw this movie at a theater and bought it at a bargain price and viewed it again.This western/science fiction movie had great actors Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, as well as  a good supporting cast. If you like a little mystery in a movie (At the beginning), fist fights, gun fights, Indians, good guys and bad guys fighting it out at the end, you may want to check this movie out.  In this movie the cowboys and Indians get together to fight the aliens.  Just keep your tongue firmly placed in your cheek and enjoy the action.In conclusion, this is an action packed western/science fiction movie that has something for everyone.  One of the ways I personally rate a movie is whether or not I like watching a movie more than once.  I enjoyed watching this film just as much the second time as I did at the theater.Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

1395089,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B004BDOF1C,Joseph M. Reninger,"[1, 1]","A man wakes up in the deserts of Arizona with no memories of who he is. He has a funny gizmo wrapped around his wrist. Three guys ride up and assume he's wanted for a bounty, so they try to take him. He beats and kills them all, takes some guns and better clothes, and heads into town. In the town of Absolution, he is patched up by the local preacher (who also packs a rifle). The preacher gives the amnesiac some advice: The good Lord don't care about what you did in the past, it's what you do now that's important. The man winds up in a confrontation with the son of the local cattle baron which lands both of them in jail. Before the sheriff can take them to the U.S. Marshall, the town is attacked at night by strange lights from the sky--ships that capture a bunch of the locals, including the cattle baron's son. Luckily, the gizmo activates when the alien ships arrive and the man shoots one ship out of the sky with it (regular bullets do nothing). The pilot escapes, leaving a trail of inhuman footprints for the posse to follow.The movie has great production values. Southwest America looks great and the aliens are seamlessly integrated into the visuals, making the movie a treat for the eyes. The aliens are a bit of a PG-version of the alien from the Alien franchise, though they are scary enough for this film. The one misstep production-wise was an explosion that looked a little too much like the space shuttle Challenger exploding. It was a bit of a shock though it must be unintentional.The tone of the movie was a bit off for me. I expected a movie with the title ""Cowboys & Aliens"" to have a lighter, more comic tone. There are funny lines and occasional humorous moments, but mostly it's played as a straight drama. That'd be okay but I didn't find the back stories of the amnesiac or the cattle baron very interesting or their characters sympathetic. Rooting for them was a little hard since I didn't care that much, even though they were played well enough by Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. The theme of redemption is touched on throughout the film but I did not find it very convincing at the end.Maybe the problem is the genre-mash-up aspect of the film. The high water mark for genre-mash-up has to be Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which combines a period drama with a kung fu flick with a romance with a mystery. The big difference between Crouching Tiger and Cowboys is the starting point. Crouching Tiger starts with a great story that spills over into all these other genres, like a rosebud unfurling its petals. Cowboys seems like a bunch of people took all these cool petals and tried to put a flower together. The credits show seven different writers and seventeen producers, co-producers, and executive producers. The compelling, central story just isn't there or it got lost in a long line of people trying to shape it just right. A lot of neat ideas are in the film but they don't quite make a cohesive whole.Cowboys is entertaining enough for a rainy day. If I ran across it while channel surfing I might watch a bit but it wouldn't keep me on the channel.",3,Too serious for its topic but fun enough,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,3098,"['man', 'up', 'deserts', 'Arizona', 'memories', 'who', 'funny', 'gizmo', 'wrapped', 'wrist', 'Three', 'guys', 'ride', 'up', 'assume', 'wanted', 'bounty', 'try', 'take', 'kills', 'guns', 'better', 'clothes', 'heads', 'town', 'town', 'Absolution', 'patched', 'up', 'local', 'preacher', 'who', 'also', 'rifle', 'preacher', 'amnesiac', 'advice', 'good', 'Lord', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'did', 'past', 'what', 'do', 'now', 'important', 'man', 'up', 'confrontation', 'son', 'local', 'cattle', 'baron', 'jail', 'sheriff', 'can', 'take', 'U.S.', 'Marshall', 'town', 'attacked', 'night', 'strange', 'lights', 'sky', 'ships', 'capture', 'bunch', 'locals', 'including', 'cattle', 'baron', 'son', 'Luckily', 'gizmo', 'when', 'alien', 'ships', 'arrive', 'man', 'one', 'ship', 'sky', 'regular', 'bullets', 'do', 'nothing', 'pilot', 'escapes', 'leaving', 'trail', 'inhuman', 'footprints', 'posse', 'follow.The', 'movie', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'Southwest', 'America', 'great', 'aliens', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'visuals', 'making', 'movie', 'treat', 'eyes', 'aliens', 'are', 'bit', 'PG-version', 'alien', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'are', 'scary', 'enough', 'film', 'one', 'misstep', 'production-wise', 'was', 'explosion', 'looked', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'space', 'shuttle', 'Challenger', 'exploding', 'was', 'bit', 'shock', 'must', 'be', 'unintentional.The', 'tone', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'expected', 'movie', 'title', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'have', 'lighter', 'more', 'comic', 'tone', 'are', 'funny', 'lines', 'occasional', 'humorous', 'moments', 'mostly', 'played', 'straight', 'drama', ""'d"", 'be', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'back', 'stories', 'amnesiac', 'cattle', 'baron', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'Rooting', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'even', 'were', 'played', 'well', 'enough', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'theme', 'redemption', 'touched', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'convincing', 'end.Maybe', 'problem', 'genre-mash-up', 'aspect', 'film', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'genre-mash-up', 'be', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'period', 'drama', 'kung', 'fu', 'flick', 'romance', 'mystery', 'big', 'difference', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Cowboys', 'starting', 'point', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'great', 'story', 'over', 'other', 'genres', 'rosebud', 'unfurling', 'petals', 'Cowboys', 'bunch', 'people', 'took', 'cool', 'petals', 'tried', 'put', 'flower', 'together', 'credits', 'show', 'seven', 'different', 'writers', 'seventeen', 'producers', 'co-producers', 'executive', 'producers', 'compelling', 'central', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'got', 'lost', 'long', 'line', 'people', 'trying', 'shape', 'just', 'right', 'lot', 'neat', 'ideas', 'are', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'cohesive', 'whole.Cowboys', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'rainy', 'day', 'ran', 'channel', 'surfing', 'might', 'watch', 'bit', 'would', ""n't"", 'keep', 'channel']",Cowboys & Aliens

1395092,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B004BDOF1C,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[7, 13]","My mom decided to FIOS this movie.  I had heard good things about it.  I think I heard it was a buy or at least rent on DVDUESDAY.  Well, I would have to disagree.  The movie is about these people in a town, set back in the days when cowboys and Indians were around, who find aliens have come to get something from them.  That is the story.  Then, you have a guy who was with a woman, though you never see them together, who wakes up and does not remember anything.  But, he has this weird thing around his wrist.  Turns out aliens may have taken him and the lady and some how he got away.  He is also wanted for killing the lady.  Though he may not have done that.  Get it?  That is the story.Now for the bad part, or ""the movie"" itself.  Wow, so many things were wrong with this in my opinion.  Let me take it one step at a time.First the actors.  There were a bunch of great actors in the movie.  Some you would see the entire time, others here and there.  But, for some reason, it felt like I was watching a trailer the entire time.  Almost like a movie they made to show at the Oscars.  It was very odd.Next, the effects and backgrounds.  AWFUL,  everything that you see in the movie, you can tell that it is fake and not very well done.  The mountains may have been actually mountains, but they were the worst mountains that I've ever seen.  The times when you saw the aliens or the technology they used also seemed cheaply done.  It was like I was watching a damn commercial or something from 10 years ago.  Watch the movie and reply with what you think.Next would be the story.  Ok, so aliens that are smart enough to fly around the never ending space and then find something on our planet they need and or want.  Are you telling me they would not just come, take what it was and leave without us even knowing?  For some reason they are pissed off and decide to kill the people.  But that is just a story choice I suppose.  For some reason, I could never get into this movie.  I love movies like this normally.  I am a 26 year old guy who is kind of a nerd.  But everything just felt so fake.  Like it was being shoved down my throat.  After 15 minutes, I had already forgotten what had happened before.  It was like I was watching something trying so hard to be funny, action packed, thrilling and mysterious, that never really got there.  Oh, and it you have eyes, you may want to skip this movie.  Why you ask?  For at least 2/5 of the movie.  My family and I could not see a damn thing.  The lighting if some of the worst I've ever seen, or haven't seen for that matter.  We were all like ""what the hell is going on?""  At one part one of the characters asks if the man can see his target.  I busted out laughing.  The end is boring and you will probably be upset you wasted your time watching.  For so many good actors and a good director, this movie sucked.  If this is what aliens bring, then let us send E.T back home!!!!As I said, we rented this from FIOS.

One might think that mixing Western and Sci-Fi topics would be a recipe for disaster yet this well done film manages to pull it off. Excellent acting, scenography, cinematography; exquisitely detailed representations of aliens and their technology; innovative mix of characters that include cattle ranchers, townspeople, Chiricahua Apaches, alien saviours & gold-digging ""demons"" from other planets. A touch of the spiritual with a peyote-like ceremony; the film also teaches an effective method for stopping one's mind.Attention to detail is everywhere. From the cursory flick of the camera to Indian scalps on frontiersman's saddle at the beginning of the film, to the intricate design of the ""arm-laser gun"" and the space ship. The amazing Western landscapes (Escalante?) had my undivided attention. I liked how the director played with genre cliches, always using a light touch and a sense of humor.

Set amidst the desert, magnificent rock formations and canyons of New Mexico, this 2011 release was a hoot!  There is plenty of CGI and action, with Daniel Craig (James Bond 007, etc.) and Harrison Ford (Star Wars, etc.).  This is a good one to see on the big screen with full sound.The 2 hour and 13 minute movie opens with Jake Lonegan/Daniel Craig coming to in the desert.  He does not know who he is or what happened to him.  He is wearing a wide metal armband that he cannot remove, has no boots, and he has a significant wound in his side.  Three men and a dog ride up to him and the men are not very hospitable.  But, not to worry--Jake kicks their collective backsides and rides off with a horse, boots, a change of clothes, and the dog.  In a nearby small town, he finds help with his wound, meets some folks, and renews some acquaintances.  We realize quickly that Jake can take care of himself, too.Also in town, Jake finds out his name, and that he is wanted for murder, mayhem, and a bunch of other stuff.  We find out the town is practically owned by Harrison Ford, the cattleman whose money puts meat on everyone's table.  We also meet Ford's arrogant son, Percy.  Daddy's power and money have obviously gone to Percy's head.  And, we also meet the Aliens, as they begin a seek and destroy mission that grabs a good number of the town's people and takes them away.  Ford and Lonegan and other town folk head out on horseback to see if they can find out what is going on.  Oh yeah, there is a pesky woman following Lonegan, too.I actually saw this movie Friday night.  I loved it so much that when my little boy (age 38) wanted to see it today, back I went!  It was enjoyable and high-action.Note to parents--there is plenty of violence.  Scenes of Aliens grabbing folks and taking them away, Aliens ripping into people with their long ugly fingers, opening folks up, biting through them, and taking out their organs may be sufficient to scare your young children.  So, unless you want them sleeping in your bed until they are 35, you might want to re-think taking them to the movie.  If you plan to see this in the theater, you may want to reconsider bringing an infant, too.  This movie has a lot of loud noise with the shooting and fighting scenes--a little excessive for a baby.

Below, more of my impressions with some LIMITED SPOILERS.In 1873, Arizona Territory, an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert injured, with no memory and with a strange metal object on his wrist. I will say no more about the story, obviously to avoid spoilers but ALSO because there is really not so much to be said... Later he will have some adventures, during which he will meet a preacher (Clancy Brown), a mysterious woman called Ella (Olivia Wilde), a saloon owner (Sam Rockwell), an aged, powerful local cattle baron (Harrison Ford) and later also a rough and tough and yet slightly clueless bandit named Hunt (Walton Goggins), who may or may not be somebody from his past... Some Indians at one moment will be involved. And yes, as the title clearly indicates and as the trailer suggests, there will be also some aliens. Adam Beach and Keith Carradine appear also in cameos.Now, with a minimum effort from the scenario writers (led by none else than the infamous Damon Lindelof), director (Jon Favreau) and producer (Steven Spielberg, no less!) this could have been a honest action film or at least a good comedy of western/SF persuasion. But well, Spielberg probably never even had one single look at the scenario, Damon Lindelof (the guy who wrote this &#34;Prometheus&#34; abomination) did his usual thing and the director just went with the boring and ridiculous scenario without giving a darn about the final result. Which is awful!This is a very boring film, with poor action scenes, bad dialogs, virtually no humour, ridiculous story line and a pathetic great finale. The only reason why I give it two stars, is because of presence of some good actors, amongst which one (Harrison Ford) I like a lot and another one (Olivia Wilde) is a hot chick. Other than that there is nothing there.

1395141,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B004BDOF1C,MacJunegrand,"[1, 1]","You would believe that it would be impossible for a premise like the one in the title to fail to deliver.  Sadly, you'd be wrong.  This film, like a E3 demo, promises much more than what it actually delivers.This film has been in development for one decade and a half before being released.  It's based on the concept for a graphic novel, which was purchased as far back as 1997.  The novel would end up being published in 2006, and in 2009 Jon Favreau, fresh from his success directing Iron Man, signed as director for the film.  Sadly, all that time in development hell didn't do wonders for the movie.The movie stars Daniel Craig, who wakes up one morning in the middle of a field with no memory, wounded, a strange unremovable bracelet on his wrist, and the picture of a woman.  He makes his way to a near town in order to pick up clues on himself.  There he meets a preacher played by Clancy Brown, who helps him with his incomprehensible wound.  Unfortunately, that's where his luck ends, since he gets recognized as a criminal and put into prison, alongside the annoying son of the man he robbed, a gruff and brutal but well-meaning Colonel played by Harrison Ford.The Colonel comes to the town once he hears the news and he's about to take the matter into his own hands when alien ships appear and start kidnapping people.  This forces the ones left behind to ignore hostilities and join in the search for their friends and family, particularly with the help of Craig's character, whose bracelet turns out to be a weapon that seems to be the only thing that's powerful enough to destroy the aliens, and a woman played by Olivia Wilde, who seems to know more about the subject than she lets on.You'd think that the moment the aliens show up is when the film starts to pick up steam, but instead it's when it loses it.  The beginning is a competent, well acted and actually interesting (if not particulary original) western, but the stuff with the aliens is so generic and painfully convenient that it drags the film down.For one, the design of the aliens is groan-inducingly derivative, and in some parts utterly ridiculous (in order to use a secondary pair of arms they need to expose their internal organs?  Does evolution work backwards in their planet?).  For a race advanced enough for interstellar travel, their lack of language or clothing of any kind is preposterous.  And, of course they're green.  I mean, I know the kind of movie we're dealing with here, but would it have killed the designers to have some creativity?Second, the plot is excruciatingly concidence-driven.  Characters don't progress based on their skill or intelligence, but based almost exclusively on luck.  Why does Craig's character escape?  Well, for some reason they decided not to put him to sleep or restrain him while they operated on him, and they left not one but two weapons at his hand's reach.  Why is the kid able to stab the alien?  Because the alien decided to reach with his lower arms instead of the just-as-long regular ones.  Also, because he happened to have been given a knife by Ford's character a while before.It's really a shame, because the acting is great pretty much all around.  It's specially great to see the usually-heroic Ford playing an even bigger jerk than Han Solo.  The effects are pretty good too, and I appreciate the little touches, like having the ships kidnap people by lassoing them.  The problem is that the characters are given too little to work with.  Not only the cast is too large to give proper time to everyone, but they're saddled with situations which scale up in ridiculousness.  We are supposed to feel sad at the death of a character we barely knew.  And then again later, when the character resurrects and dies AGAIN, no one seems to bat an eye.  And the aliens motivation for being here is so ridiculous it'd be at place in a Hostess Twinkies comic book ad.I found this movie depressingly dissapointing.  I was really interested in the premise, I'm not someone who will diss a film based on a silly title or plot.  But the problem is precisely that the movie doesn't deliver on its premise.

The juxtaposition of futuristic aliens with the Old West creates one of the odder but most interesting settings of any sci-fi movie ever done. I'm surprised no one did it before--before it was such a good idea considering how well this one turned out. No doubt the movie snobs will pan it, but come on, this is a movie to just watch over beer and popcorn on a lazy weekend night. The acting was good, the script is decent, and the special effects competent and enjoyable to watch. The aliens are appropriately creepy and scary, and a worthy successor to the original Alien and Predator. Be advised there's a lot of violence and gore and so it may not be appropriate for younger viewers.Sci fi movie fans will recognize the homage to previous S-F movie greats such as Star Wars (advanced alien technology that looks used and old, etc.) As another reviewer here noted, Craig and Harrison play well off each other and they're the perfect choice for this duo. Olivia Wilde is also good as the alien woman but all the actors turn in decent performances.

1395147,A129YBX5BVNW2,B004BDOF1C,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 2]","What impresses most about ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is not the special effects - or even Olivia Wilde's blue eyes which could quite literally level entire continents with a single glance (how the camera adores this woman) - it's the sheer presence of Daniel Craig. How did he get this cool all of a sudden? And there's even a convincing chemistry between him and Olivia Wilde that should be enough to worry Rachel Weisz. But for me that's where the good news peters out...I suspect like a lot of movie lovers, I was really looking forward to ""Cowboys & Aliens"". But it just somehow feels like ""Captain America"" or ""Green Lantern"" - two of the lamest comic-book adaptations of 2011. In fact you just wish Hollywood would leave these easy sources alone and reach for something exciting and new - genuinely original even.One upside however is the superb ensemble cast - veterans include the ever watchable Harrison Ford as ruthless rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde who is at logger-heads with Keith Carradine - the put-upon Sheriff of Absolution - a frontier town in the Wild West of 1873. The younger blood is supplied by Sam Rockwell as a bar-owning doctor - with Paul Dano as Woodrow's mouthy gun-wielding trouble-attracting son (he was the preacher boy in ""There Will Be Blood""). Noah Ringer is a scared kid and there's nice work from Abigail Spencer and Ana De La Reguera as a prostitute and wife. But best of all is Clancy Brown as the town preacher Meacham trying to explain to the town's frightened populace what the alien 'machines' mean (he was the corrupt guard Bryon Hadley in the mighty ""Shawshank Redemption""). He gives the piece a badly needed earthiness and heart.But ""Cowboys & Aliens"" should of course be a special-effects bonanza with a howdy-dowdy twist - yet the CGI is underwhelming and even hammy. The pace also slows a lot, it's overly long and there are outdoors battle scenes towards the end in the daylight that resemble a bad B-movie set. In fact I think maybe the effects are part of the problem - not enough of them - not impressive enough. Sure in some instances the Alien creatures look suitably nasty and icky (like oversized grasshoppers) - but in others they actually look ludicrous...and that can't be good. It's a shame because the story's not half bad and unfolds nicely - but you can't help but feel that without 007's sheer star quality, there'd be little actually worth watching.The BLU RAY picture is sharp (as you'd expect from a movie of this size) and the 5.1 soundtrack rattles around your speakers with impressive clarity - but the picture never rises up above the merely good - and instead of thrilling me to the core - the explosions irritated after a while in their desperate over-the-top need to impress. The extras also give away way too much of what is good in the film (so don't watch them first).""Cowboys & Aliens"" is fun in places for sure, but it's a 3-star underachiever that ultimately leaves you wondering why Director Jon Favreau couldn't have delivered more given the great canvass he had...I suggest rent rather than buy.",3,It's Only Good When It Could Have Been Great...,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,3067,"['What', 'most', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'blue', 'eyes', 'could', 'quite', 'literally', 'level', 'entire', 'continents', 'single', 'glance', 'how', 'camera', 'woman', 'sheer', 'presence', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'cool', 'sudden', 'even', 'convincing', 'chemistry', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'worry', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'where', 'good', 'news', 'peters', 'out', 'suspect', 'lot', 'movie', 'lovers', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'just', 'somehow', 'feels', 'Captain', 'America', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'two', 'lamest', 'comic-book', 'adaptations', '2011', 'fact', 'just', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'leave', 'easy', 'sources', 'alone', 'reach', 'something', 'exciting', 'new', 'genuinely', 'original', 'even.One', 'upside', 'however', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'veterans', 'include', 'ever', 'watchable', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'ruthless', 'rancher', 'Woodrow', 'Dolarhyde', 'who', 'logger-heads', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'put-upon', 'Sheriff', 'Absolution', 'frontier', 'town', 'Wild', 'West', '1873', 'younger', 'blood', 'supplied', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'bar-owning', 'doctor', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Woodrow', 'mouthy', 'gun-wielding', 'trouble-attracting', 'son', 'was', 'preacher', 'boy', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'scared', 'kid', 'nice', 'work', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'Ana', 'De', 'La', 'Reguera', 'prostitute', 'wife', 'best', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'town', 'preacher', 'Meacham', 'trying', 'explain', 'town', 'frightened', 'populace', 'what', 'alien', ""'machines"", 'mean', 'was', 'corrupt', 'guard', 'Bryon', 'Hadley', 'mighty', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'piece', 'badly', 'needed', 'earthiness', 'heart.But', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'should', 'course', 'be', 'special-effects', 'bonanza', 'howdy-dowdy', 'twist', 'yet', 'CGI', 'underwhelming', 'even', 'hammy', 'pace', 'also', 'lot', 'overly', 'long', 'are', 'outdoors', 'battle', 'scenes', 'end', 'daylight', 'bad', 'B-movie', 'set', 'fact', 'think', 'maybe', 'effects', 'are', 'part', 'problem', 'not', 'not', 'impressive', 'enough', 'Sure', 'instances', 'Alien', 'creatures', 'look', 'suitably', 'nasty', 'icky', 'oversized', 'grasshoppers', 'others', 'actually', 'look', 'ludicrous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'shame', 'story', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'unfolds', 'nicely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', '007', 'sheer', 'star', 'quality', ""'d"", 'be', 'little', 'actually', 'watching.The', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'picture', 'sharp', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movie', 'size', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'rattles', 'speakers', 'impressive', 'clarity', 'picture', 'never', 'up', 'merely', 'good', 'instead', 'thrilling', 'core', 'explosions', 'irritated', 'while', 'desperate', 'over-the-top', 'need', 'impress', 'extras', 'also', 'give', 'away', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'fun', 'places', 'sure', '3-star', 'underachiever', 'ultimately', 'wondering', 'why', 'Director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'delivered', 'more', 'given', 'great', 'canvass', 'had', 'suggest', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy']",Cowboys & Aliens

As he struggles to remember, he finds that he has to protect the world from an unknown threat. Along the way, he must align himself with Woodrow Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford) a greedy cattleman whose sole job seems to be protecting his spoiled son, some superstitious Indians who blame the white men for this new threat, and the beautiful/mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde) to defeat a new threat, aliens seeking gold.The pros of this movie: There were some amazing and established actors involved. The setting (in the Old West) was extremely compelling. After all, what more could you ask for than a battle between the aliens and the earthlings......laser-like weapons against Old West weapons (i.e., arrows and guns)? There were plenty of gunfights....some you simply got lost in the battle scenes and scenery. There were even men on horseback fighting aliens in fast moving space vessels. The special effects were great and in and of themselves worth a 4.The cons of this movie: With so much talent available to this director (Craig, Ford, Wilde, and several more), it was the plot that lacked real bite.  I felt that gold seeking aliens was (for lack of a better word)... pretty lame. Why would aliens who have access to any and everything, want earth's gold? I mean I would have rather the aliens wanted us for food (which isn't original but more likely) or the desire earth's most valuable resource, water like a lot of other movies and novels. Really I would have appreciated them wanting anything but our gold. It seemed that the aliens could have arrived on earth and taken secretly what they wanted without snatching humans and turning them into mindless beings.

It's obvious that the barman who can't shoot, for example, is going to save the day with some crack gun-play later on in the movie. Another major criticism is that I found it totally unexciting. I just sat there yawning and checking the clock.Which is a shame because not only does it have a great cast but there are also some flashes of intrigue and originality - such as the upside down steamer five hundred miles away from the nearest big river. More could have been done with the clash of subject matter too, the most obvious angle being the comparison of frontier life in the West with aliens pushing their own frontiers of exploration.Not one I can recommend.",2,Waste of a good concept,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,1049,"['What', 'waste', 'good', 'concept', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'especially', 'given', 'cast', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'say', 'left', 'disappointed', '[', 'minor', 'spoilers', ']', 'opening', 'scene', 'unexpected', 'burst', 'violence', 'intriguing', 'wrist-wear', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'promised', 'lot', 'quickly', 'by-the-numbers', 'action', 'movie', 'episodic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'derivative', 'obvious', 'barman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'example', 'going', 'save', 'day', 'crack', 'gun-play', 'later', 'movie', 'major', 'criticism', 'found', 'totally', 'unexciting', 'just', 'sat', 'yawning', 'checking', 'clock.Which', 'shame', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'flashes', 'intrigue', 'originality', 'such', 'upside', 'steamer', 'five', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'nearest', 'big', 'river', 'More', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'clash', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'most', 'obvious', 'angle', 'being', 'comparison', 'frontier', 'life', 'West', 'aliens', 'pushing', 'own', 'frontiers', 'exploration.Not', 'one', 'can', 'recommend']",Cowboys & Aliens

I had really been looking forward to this crazy sounding genre mashup. Even with the mostly negative reviews, I still had hope.My main issues are with the weak story and just a general lack of amazement from any of the CGI and action sequences. The plot is just your typical western for the first 30 minutes or so (which was the best part), until the aliens show up. Then the cowboys become friends with some indians and they must combine resources to fight the aliens. That about sums it up. If you see a movie called Snakes on a Plane or Cowboys & Aliens, don't expect anything other than that. The visuals are not bad, they just didn't show us anything new or inventive. Well, I guess you could count the sight of a dude on horseback from the 1800's being chased by an alien spacecraft as something new.Daniel Craig is pretty good as the Charles Bronson like character. Mostly silent but deadly in an instant. Harrison Ford is okay as a gruff and tough cowboy, even though he was not always believable. Olivia Wilde is here to look at and Sam Rockwell is wasted, though he does have a couple of good lines.There is not really more to say about a movie this basic.

1395191,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B004BDOF1C,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","I have to say that when I first heard about the concept of Cowboys and Aliens I laughed out loud.  It sounded like fun - like Blazing Saddles meets Space Balls - and I'd have loved to see a serious satire about aliens invading the old West.  Then I read they meant to keep it serious, like maybe True Grit meets Predator.  That sounded good, too.  After all, if there really were aliens  who had the capacity to come to Earth it makes sense that they wouldn't just visit L.A. in the present.  Why wouldn't they show up in medieval Europe, or even the wild West?  I'd love to see what the man with no name does with a xenomorph.  I really liked what Favreau did with Iron Man, and liked the Star Trek reboot by the writers of this show, so I ended up deciding to check this out when it played in our local theater.It turns out, though, the film didn't live up either to its initial hilarity or the subsequent promise of a serious Western in which the townsfolk are abducted by aliens.  They should have gone for funny, because my wife and I laughed out loud as the film hit clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  I believe it's supposed to be loosely adapted from a graphic novel, but it felt like the writers decided to watch a bunch of Westerns and sci-fi flicks and then tried to come up with a plot that would give them a chance to hit them all.  The nameless drifter with a criminal past, the apparent prostitute with a heart of gold, the manipulative cattle boss and his psychopathic son, the native Americans with their wisdom rituals, the toothless bandits, the familial reconciliation, the ride off into the sunset...and then why is it that after Alien every sentient being from outer space has an outer shell that opens up to reveal internal mouths and other body parts?They hired decent actors and then gave them lines that were laughable.  They tried to sell Harrison Ford as a greedy and vicious man, who had the whole town under his thumb - in a role reversal of the type that worked brilliantly when Sergio Leone cast Henry Ford as the cruel force of evil in Once Upon a Time in the West.  It didn't work here - both because I didn't find Ford convincing as a bad guy and because the writers chickened out and let him turn out to have a soft side.  They ended up explaining why Olivia Wilde seemed so implausibly awestruck by the sight of Daniel Craig - but even when it was clear who she was her story didn't make sense.  Without revealing anything specific I'll just say it's utterly implausible that, being who she said she was, she'd be there just waiting for the coincidence that Daniel Craig's character happened to have the knowledge and the power that she'd travelled so far to find.  That's just one among many loose ends in the story.  I have a lot of patience, but I found the first half of the film to be overly boring and long.  Eventually it had a few thrilling moments - they didn't entirely waste their special effects budget - and that's why I'm giving it two stars, since if you were distracted and bored at home there might be worse things to do than waste time watching this one.",2,"Intriguing concept, disappointing results",1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,3110,"['have', 'say', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'concept', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'sounded', 'fun', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'Space', 'Balls', ""'d"", 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'serious', 'satire', 'aliens', 'invading', 'old', 'West', 'Then', 'read', 'meant', 'keep', 'serious', 'maybe', 'True', 'Grit', 'meets', 'Predator', 'sounded', 'good', 'too', 'really', 'were', 'aliens', 'who', 'had', 'capacity', 'come', 'Earth', 'sense', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'visit', 'L.A.', 'present', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'medieval', 'Europe', 'even', 'wild', 'West', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'what', 'man', 'name', 'xenomorph', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'Favreau', 'did', 'Iron', 'Man', 'liked', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', 'writers', 'show', 'ended', 'up', 'deciding', 'check', 'out', 'when', 'played', 'local', 'theater.It', 'out', 'though', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'initial', 'hilarity', 'subsequent', 'promise', 'serious', 'Western', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'funny', 'wife', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'film', 'hit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'believe', 'supposed', 'be', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'graphic', 'novel', 'felt', 'writers', 'decided', 'watch', 'bunch', 'Westerns', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'then', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'plot', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'hit', 'nameless', 'drifter', 'criminal', 'past', 'apparent', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'manipulative', 'cattle', 'boss', 'psychopathic', 'son', 'native', 'Americans', 'wisdom', 'rituals', 'toothless', 'bandits', 'familial', 'reconciliation', 'ride', 'sunset', 'then', 'why', 'Alien', 'sentient', 'being', 'outer', 'space', 'outer', 'shell', 'up', 'reveal', 'internal', 'mouths', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'hired', 'decent', 'actors', 'then', 'gave', 'lines', 'were', 'laughable', 'tried', 'sell', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'greedy', 'vicious', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'whole', 'town', 'thumb', 'role', 'reversal', 'type', 'worked', 'brilliantly', 'when', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'cast', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'cruel', 'force', 'evil', 'Once', 'Time', 'West', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Ford', 'convincing', 'bad', 'guy', 'writers', 'chickened', 'out', 'let', 'turn', 'out', 'have', 'soft', 'side', 'ended', 'up', 'explaining', 'why', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'seemed', 'so', 'implausibly', 'awestruck', 'sight', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'clear', 'who', 'was', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'revealing', 'anything', 'specific', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'utterly', 'implausible', 'being', 'who', 'said', 'was', ""'d"", 'be', 'there', 'just', 'waiting', 'coincidence', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'character', 'happened', 'have', 'knowledge', 'power', ""'d"", 'travelled', 'so', 'far', 'find', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'story', 'have', 'lot', 'patience', 'found', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'be', 'overly', 'boring', 'long', 'Eventually', 'had', 'few', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'waste', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'were', 'distracted', 'bored', 'home', 'might', 'be', 'worse', 'things', 'do', 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'one']",Cowboys & Aliens

I honestly thought the movie was pretty much everything wrong with the movie industry today. The name alone sounds like some hashed up SCI-FI B movie that should have went straight to VHS at best. To be fair though, I did watch the movie with hopes that it'll go against my ever nagging skepticism. To me I thought they should rename the movie Cowboys & [maybe SOME] Aliens because for almost half the movie, there were barely any encounters or rather I say quality scenes with the aliens and mind you, the aliens were your stereotypical bunch; sharp teeth, out to harm humans, ugly. Basically uncreative and definitely death to originality in every sense of the word. So half the movie felt like your typical cowboy movie and in the end, they have a small group of people that band together to fight the aliens in, mind you, a battle of very minute, nonepic, lackluster proportions. The movie wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't creative, it wasn't humorous, it wasn't witty, it just wasn't. Predictable from beginning to end.So, what's so decent about this movie? Do I sense some mindless Harrison Ford worshipers or paid reviewers? I wouldn't watch this movie twice, so 23 bucks is definitely out of the question. To each their own, but you're giving the movie industry a bad message, basically ""go ahead and make bad movies, chances are we're just [FILL IN THE BLANK WITH NEGATIVE WORDS] to tell and will probably pay to watch it anyway"".Amazon star ratings definitely should be held very loosely in terms of credibility.

Before you know it, he runs afoul of a nasty Harrison Ford, and eventually the alien beings that the film's title implies.

The typical Western, complete with nasty cattle rancher lording it over a hard-scrabble town and a host of time-worn characters, is melded with an alien invasion, whose aliens look and act a lot like the ones made famous in Sigourney Weaver's epic Alien trilogy. The aliens do typical alien things, like capturing humans and experimenting on them, and the alien spaceship is typically ill-lit with dripping moisture. Apparently aliens see well in the dark but have few plumbing skills. No problem. From my point of view, it is precisely the collection of these familiar characters, characteristics, and dialogue that make the movie so much fun. One minute the spoiled son of the mean rancher is drunkenly shooting up the dusty main street...the next minute, an amnesiac man with a peculiar wristband is shooting up a mini-spaceship which has lasso'ed and carried off a host of townsfolk. One woman in town seems to know more than she should about the matter. I simply enjoyed the whole film. I loved seeing a very experienced cast (including Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Clancy Brown) spouting lines that could have come from any cowboy movie from the past half century. I loved seeing a band of Indians killing aliens with spears, and I really got a kick out of the mysterious woman speaking fluent Chiricahua to the chief of the Indians. There is a plot, but I paid very little attention to it. I was too busy enjoying the clash of cliches, which was very nicely filmed in New Mexico.

It had a star-studded cast, great special effects, an original script, respectable acting, and an original soundtrack.  However, coming out in 2011, after fans were spoiled with the POTC, LOTR, Harry Potter, and various Marvel and DC comic franchises, this movie did OK at the box office.  The movie itself is an innovative mix of science fiction and western genres, with a mix of comedy and suspense thrown in.  All of it is very authentic.  The western part of the movie is quite believable as we have both cowboys and Indians and innocent town-folk.  I especially like the portrayal of the Indians, as one of the sub-themes of the movie was the struggle of one character to find acceptance among white society, while not trying to alienate his fellow Native Americans.  The science fiction portion of the movie is standard fare; i.e. aliens coming to Earth.  However, there is one original bonus, and that is the character played by Olivia Wilde.  Being a fan of alien invasion movies, her role was new to me, and quite good in making the plot more interesting.This package features the standard Blu-ray and DVD discs.  The package comes with both the theatrical and extended editions; hence there is no extraneous deleted or alternate scenes anywhere.

At first I was quite intrigued by the over-all idea of mixing a western with a sci-fi, and also having Jon Favreau direct such a film greatly boosted my lust to watch this film. However it got mixed reviews and did not seem to stay in theaters for too long. I should have known better to listen to the negative reviews.Cowboys and Aliens is a very fun movie which is a western drama wrapped in an alien action movie. I am not a fan of western movies at all, however with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford at the helm in this movie, I knew to look past my reservations about western flicks.Even though it has a fast pasted start, Cowboys and Aliens does not waive from building a character. Harrison Ford in particular has a very strong disposition and I felt as though I could relate to his personality and character the most. Daniel Craig did a great job for such a complicated role he had.I was blown away by the special effects, yes you could tell that they were CGI, however they were done very well and blended in perfectly with the environment. The sound effects also were very well done.The picture and audio quality of this Blu-ray are some of the best I have ever seen and heard. The PQ in particular was breathtaking. There was little to no grain and the depth and clarity were outstanding throughout. The bonus features were also great. Many movies lately seem to leave out bonus features which we all take the time to enjoy.Over-all I am very happy with my blind buy and greatly enjoyed this movie.

It falls on a posse of cowboys to try and track the aliens down to recover their loved ones and find out why the aliens are here and doing what they are doing. Daniel Craig makes a great hard-bitten cowboy. He is both a good guy and a hardened criminal, although he is also amnesiac, and wakes to find a strange bracer attached to his wrist. As seen in the commercials, the bracer is a piece of alien technology and a powerful weapon. Harrison Ford plays an ex-Colonel, and is also a hard-a^%. They essentially represent two factions forced to team up to track the aliens. Add Olivia Wilde, who is classically beautiful as always, and a bunch of other recognizable actors, and you end up with a pretty good cast.The story itself has some highs and lows. Some points of the plotline are a little hard to swallow, even with the fantastic nature of the movie. However, the development is paced well, and the fun outweighs the flaws. They even mix in some social messages regarding racism and greed into the equation. The aliens are pretty cool looking and the desert settings are really stunning at times.This was a good movie overall.

If you have not seen this movie yet, it is because you have been laughing at the truly funny title and the silliness of the implied premise.Cowboys and Aliens is why the term mindless entertainment exists. Mindless perhaps, entertaining certainly.Amazon suggests a plot synopsis:Plot? We don need no Stinking Plot! Yes there is one, but does it really matter? We got Cowboys (and Indians) and BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters). You are free to bet on the winner. If it helps not all the cowboys are good guys. Also consider that betting against the side that has both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig (somewhere in there is also Keith Carradine) - is at your risk.There are a number of plot devices from movies like Firefly, War of the Worlds (newer version), Independence day and, on the western side: the Spaghetti Westerns and ... well let me suggest that: if you are the son of a rich wild west daddy and assume he will get you out of jail for shooting up the town, better to have an angry grizzled Harrison Ford than Walter Brennan. Because eatin teeth or no, that plot device was old before the movieSupport Your Local Sheriff1969, made it funny.On the other hand if you can stare in to the face of an angry grizzled Harrison Ford and remember your next line then you are as fine a child star as Noah Andrew Ringer. Then again, if you can face an angry H. Ford than you too can put a Tennessee toothpick where it can best adjust the attitude of an over - reaching BEM.Daniel Craig may not have the over defined features of a young Schwarzenegger or Steven Seagal but he has a great 50 yard stare and all the moves. Do not hack him off unless you have 30 guns pointed as his girl.A few other bits of advice. Maybe if Col. Dolarhyde (Ford) had abetter attitude towards West Pointers, he would not have lost so many troops at Antietam. As is his final deployment against the aliens stank. If the super high tech alien race had a few more hand guns they would have eaten your men alive..Literally!As for the Aliens, if you are planning a rematch - you may want to think about why it is that in the alien abduction biz, the anal probe is,  industry standard.Yet, this movie works. Unlikely elements seems to come together. The logic fails are no more glaring than many another SciFI movie.

It seems like it will take a lot for him to prove to the world that he's capable of doing more than playing James Bond. And furthermore, it doesn't look like he'll be any more able to pull off a performance as Mikael Blomkvist in the upcoming Dragon Tattoo remake. Because just an hour ago, I got out of the movie that may just be solid proof of his inability to act outside his comfort zone... Cowboys and Aliens.I'll admit I didn't have any expectations for this movie except just a fun and enjoyable blow-em-up alien flick. In fact, something with such a title as ""Cowboys and Aliens"" should not be boring. And a cast like Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde should help offer SOMETHING of that promise. Unfortunately, the movie has its head so far up in the clouds, it thinks it's something other than what it should be.I will say the movie got off to a good start with the opening moments, where Jake, the film's protagonist wakes in the desert, unaware of where he is, and then the following scene with Jake beating the men up and stealing their clothes and horse was great too. Speaking of the protagonist, I'm not sure why we don't find out his name until about 30 minutes into the movie, or so it seems.Anyways, back to the ""plot"". He appears to have woken up with a bracelet made of iron on his left wrist, which leads to what may be the most ham handed Chekhov's Gun example later in the film. He appears to have no memory at all and later finds out he is a wanted robber, and is imprisoned after a bar fight. One night, aliens attack the town, and it is unknown why (nor is it really explained, save for some weird gold subplot later innthe film). And there's more attacks, and the men go on an adventure to stop the attacks, and blah blah blah... The end.Oh and I forgot, Olivia Wilde is in this. What she was even in there for again I'm completely empty at the thought of too, and maybe my summary wouldn't be so vague had there been STUFF HAPPENING in the film. Sad thing is, her performance is the best thing of the movie.Honestly I am amazed. I haven't had this much trouble trying to find the words to say about such a frustrating film. How could a movie with such a concept be so BORING. There is basically almost no fun in the film. When a movie is called ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and there's no fun in the movie whatsoever, that is not a good sign.In fact, why are there aliens in the movie, anyway. They are indeed very pointless and they feel forced in just to create some pointless conflict involving gold, which gets left to naught in the end. And we rarely see any of the aliens anyway.

1395253,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B004BDOF1C,Robert Badgley,"[1, 3]","Cowboys and aliens(released July/11)is,to me,a surprisingly good Sci-Fi film.It's reviews were not the greatest and I was anticipating watching a high budget movie with good intentions that went no where fast.But such was not the case,which leads me to mention the first rule of reviewing:Don't believe what others see and write about,believe only what YOU see! Mr.Spielberg had a hand in this epic,which truly IS one,in feel and looks.The cinematography is fabulous as we are taken all over the beautiful outlands of Arizona.But let's not get ahead of ourselves,let's look at the films storyline.The film begins out in the desert near a town called Absolution.A man(Daniel Craig) wakes up on the desert floor with a wound in his side and no idea how he got there.On his left wrist is an over sized ""bracelet"" of some type,origin unknown.Some drifters come through and decide he may be a wanted man.Before they can take him into town for the reward the man takes down all three and wanders alone into Absolution.While there it seems some of the townsfolk know him,specifically the sheriff.It seems this stranger is a wanted felon by the name of Jake Lonergan.After the son of a local prominent cattle rancher,Mr.Dollarhyde(Harrison Ford),accidentally shoots a deputy sheriff,both are taken into custody and put into a wagon for shipment to and a trial at Tuscon.Before they can leave Dollarhyde shows up for his boy but is interrupted by a group of strange lights approaching the town.The lights turn out to be alien craft intent on abducting some of the townspeople.Lonergan's bracelet comes to ""life"" and he is soon shooting at and downing at least one of the ships.However the alien pilot escapes and roams into town only to be shot and wounded.Lonergan leaves town while Dollarhyde forms a posse which heads out at first light to track down the creature.Lonnergan arrives at a cabin in which he gets flashbacks.He has had them previously but they grow more detailed and this one reveals his former love and some gold he brought home.in the flashback the gold suddenly melts on the table and is sucked upwards while his lady love gets pulled right out of the cabin.Lonnergan leaves the cabin and joins up with Dollarhyde and his men.A ways out they run into a gang of robbers that turn out to be Lonnergan's old gang members.They take him to their camp and a confrontation occurs between Lonnergan and the new boss.It doesn't go down well for Lonnergan who eventually has to use to bracelet to help them all escape.Traveling further on the party gets captured by some Apache Indians.Through some harrowing moments a consensus is finally reached between the two groups to fight the invaders.Through more concise flashbacks Lonnergan now knows and leads them all to the place where the alien mother ship is buried.A pitched battle between the aliens and Lonnergan,Dollarhyde and company begins.Entry is gained into the ship and eventually many of the taken settlers are found and released.Near the end the ship lifts off but is finally destroyed only about a thousand or so feet above the ground.Back in Absolution Lonnergan is asked to stay on by Dollarhyde while the sheriff pretends Lonnergan had died in the firefight.Lonnergan begs off both and leaves town.Fade out in typical western fashion.As I mentioned before this film simply looks beautiful.The scenes in the desert are stunning and epic in their look.Something out of a John Ford film.The script has just enough twists and turns in it to keep one interested throughout its journey on the screen.Lonnergan's flashbacks(a tool as old as Pete the Pup)is done just right,I find.The acting is also spot on as we have a great cast of starring and supporting actors on hand.The special effects are also of the highest quality as the aliens are all too real looking.They are bipeds,whose smallish heads meld into their necks,and whose chests open up to reveal two hands,with three E.T. like digits.The fight sequences between humans and aliens are also very realistic and deadly looking.These things aren't on Earth for a game of backgammon.Technically speaking the film looks great in its original a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include three featurettes and commentary by the director.All in all a very enjoyable blend of the old fashioned western with a Sci-Fi backdrop.It has an epic feel and look to it and the acting along with the special effects are very good.Recommended.",4,A very likable cowboys meets aliens

1395256,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B004BDOF1C,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","I was skeptical when I heard about this film, I mean, cowboys fighting space monsters?  It seemed like too much of a stretch, especially since only a few Europeans were even dreaming that such things were possible.  However, given the actors, I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a look-see while on a long airplane trip.  And from the first moment, when the hero wakes with amnesia and a strange metal bracelet, the characters drew me into a much better-than-average story.  It was even hard scifi without a whiff of fantasy, though what the aliens could do definitely would have seemed like magic or demons to the men of that time.The plot even has some good twists.  D Craig makes a wonderful tough guy who deep down is grieving even if he can't remember why.  He demonstrates his propensity to deadly violence right away, but there is something principled about it or seemingly so.  After a quick imbroglio, he wanders into a town that is riven by a spoiled gunslinger, whose father is apparently a brutally evil rancher.  Craig is also approached by a mysterious and beautiful woman, who seems to know a lot about him.  When they seem ready to kill eachother, the town is attacked, setting them on an adventure together as Craig discovers the metal object is a weapon.  Add Indians and a band of outlaws (who know Craig as a leader) into the mix and you begin to wonder if any of it is going to make sense.  That the rest of the movie succeeds so well, maintaining a sense of mystery and awe at least in me, is a testament to an unusually intelligent script.One of the best themes in the film is how the humans band together, each bringing skills from their cultures and experience, to fight the baddies.  It might sound silly, but it really works well.  For example, the Indians give a potion to Craig that liberates his memory.  I don't want to play the spoiler, so won't say anything more, but it is a raucous ride with great CGI.Warmly recommended.  It won't be what you expect, if you like hard scifi to begin with, that is.",4,genre mix definitely worked for me,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,2036,"['was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'mean', 'fighting', 'space', 'monsters', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'stretch', 'especially', 'only', 'few', 'Europeans', 'were', 'even', 'dreaming', 'such', 'things', 'were', 'possible', 'However', 'given', 'actors', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', ""'ll"", 'give', 'look-see', 'while', 'long', 'airplane', 'trip', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'hero', 'amnesia', 'strange', 'metal', 'bracelet', 'characters', 'drew', 'much', 'better-than-average', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'hard', 'scifi', 'whiff', 'fantasy', 'what', 'aliens', 'could', 'do', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'magic', 'demons', 'men', 'time.The', 'plot', 'even', 'good', 'twists', 'D', 'Craig', 'wonderful', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'deep', 'down', 'grieving', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'propensity', 'deadly', 'violence', 'right', 'away', 'something', 'principled', 'seemingly', 'so', 'quick', 'imbroglio', 'town', 'riven', 'spoiled', 'gunslinger', 'father', 'apparently', 'brutally', 'evil', 'rancher', 'Craig', 'also', 'approached', 'mysterious', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'know', 'lot', 'When', 'seem', 'ready', 'kill', 'eachother', 'town', 'attacked', 'setting', 'adventure', 'together', 'Craig', 'metal', 'object', 'weapon', 'Add', 'Indians', 'band', 'outlaws', 'who', 'know', 'Craig', 'leader', 'mix', 'begin', 'wonder', 'going', 'make', 'sense', 'rest', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'mystery', 'awe', 'least', 'testament', 'unusually', 'intelligent', 'script.One', 'best', 'themes', 'film', 'how', 'humans', 'band', 'together', 'bringing', 'skills', 'cultures', 'experience', 'fight', 'baddies', 'might', 'sound', 'silly', 'really', 'well', 'example', 'Indians', 'give', 'potion', 'Craig', 'memory', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'spoiler', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'raucous', 'ride', 'great', 'CGI.Warmly', 'recommended', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'what', 'expect', 'like', 'hard', 'scifi', 'begin']",Cowboys & Aliens

If you have a longer attention span, and enjoy genre-bending material (like Firefly, for ex).. you may be pleasantly surprised by how rich and charming this film is.

But no, the wonderful opening scenes that bring this 1870s era alive quickly jump the rails with a hodgepodge of sci-fi and other elements that throw almost everything into the mix.  There's even a dog.  There must be about a half dozen credited producers including Spielberg (has he no shame?) and at least as many credited writers.  From the looks of the finished film, I assume there are tidbits and moments of many more uncredited writers.  The resulting film is really the deal on screen - not a story.Harrison Ford remains rather sullen throughout and Daniel Craig is mean and lean.  Sometimes their combined star power is startling - and other times it evokes laughter.  The latter I assume is not intentional as this is definitely not a comedy.  Perhaps that's the first mistake.  Neither is it a farce or satire.  Hard to tell what it is exactly other than a pulp sci-fi magazine cover from the 30s come alive.John Favreau directs with a fine sense of the big vistas and ear-drum busting sound of the nicely visualized action scenes - even if it's not clear exactly what is going on at all times.  But all the disparate parts finally add up to a rather unsatisfying movie experience because the narrative itself is without a central thread that ties everything together.That said, Olivia Wilde is a looker and on a blistering summer day Palm Springs, the movie was a welcome and cool respite from the heat.

1395274,A2Z4NPJ1WAWDE7,B004BDOF1C,R. Zoellner,"[3, 4]","First of all, I was concerned that Cowboys and Aliens would be a corny or campy movie. This is not the case however, despite the fact that the special features reveal it to be based on a comic book by the same name. With big name stars like Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised to find that Cowboys and Aliens was in fact much more of a gritty action movie. This film is a proper heir to both the western tradition and the monster movie style of filming. There was something unique in this mash-up, which allowed for a cast of characters with absolutely no prior concept of aliens.Therefore, aliens got called demons by characters, for lack of a better word, for example. Also, the Old West setting absolutely emphasized the sense of being out-gunned by the technologically advanced enemy. You've got some kind of flying saucer swooping down, and cowboys shooting a revolver at it. Success seems impossible without outside aid. There is also a lovely amnesia-related plot focused on the main character, yielding some amusing lines in the midst of an otherwise grim film. I'll never forget the whole audience gasping in the theater during a scene where a character is getting medical attention, old west style. Did I say gasping? I meant gagging.I was also completely pleased that this DVD release of Cowboys and Aliens had special features. They were brief, but did just enough to really help me appreciate the work that went into the filming.

The title pretty much tells you what the movie will be about. Still, it's been so long since we saw a cowboy movie-let alone cowboys who had thoughts that originated above the waist-that I was glad to see men (and woman) a-horseback again.The movie starts with James Bond waking up in the desert, shoeless, yet accessorized by a really snazzy bracelet. Before he can even stand up, he's accosted by Newly from ""Gunsmoke"" who, with his not-too-well-coifed or overly bright sons, tries to take him in assuming the bracelet to be an indication of a prison break. Bond can't remember who he is, but he remembers how to fight and, soon, is riding into town in clothing furnished by Newly & Sons.In the town he discovers that one of the Carradines is the remarkably upstanding sheriff, the preacher is a sincere but somewhat foul-mouthed person I probably should remember and the bar is run by Guy from ""Galaxy Quest"". If that weren't enough trouble, Mutt2 is terrorizing the town because his father, Indiana Jones, is rich and hard and takes in Apaches. The girl from ""Tron: Legacy"" is there, too, though it takes a long time to figure out why.After the old west town is attacked by aliens--who lasso their victims and jerk them into the sky--Bond, Indy and the girl lead a posse of townies, outlaws and Indians into the New Mexico dessert to find them all. If this sounds confusing, it's not, really. But one thing it was, was unpredictable. In spite of the fact that I was thinking the title gave everything away, for the whole movie I never knew what was coming next. When I thought I knew, I was wrong. It turns out that the director who brought us ""Elf"" really knows how to tell a story.I only have two quibbles with this movie. 1] there's too much foul language and it rarely ever serves the plot or the characters well.

Don't watch this film expecting an intellectual story (IE like Independence Day).  It's just an entertaining ""what if"" sort of film and it is very well done.May I add: ""Mr. Ford, you've still got it after all these years!""  One scene was an obvious nod to Indiana Jones (you'll know it when you see it, film watchers).This film would have gotten a 5 star rating from me, but there were a few things that really bothered me. ****minor spoilers below****Emma is a glaring example of a ""plot device!""  Yes, it made for an interesting twist but after her campfire debut, she goes back to well... ordinary.  I'd have liked to see her prove herself to be more extraordinary. (Sorry, I know this is vague, but I am trying not to give away too much).I know this film is supposed to make you feel like you're watching an old western with a twist, but making the Native Americans hooting, hollering ""kill the white man before you know if he is after your common enemy"" type people is just irritating.  I don't expect a love fest between the cowboys and the Native people, but I wish the writers would have toned down the war-crying!  At least they didn't make the chief blame evil spirits. Instead he blames an earth bound, more plausible enemy - the gold hungry settlers.One of the last aliens we see die does meet an end that is rather fitting. Poetic Justice! Yes, I cheered.Cowboys and Aliens does deliver something else many will appreciate:  very little foul language and NO explicit sexual scenes. Yes, there is one flashback of Jake and his (wife?) having a tumble in the grass, but they are fully clothed.  The only other scene is a brief glimpse of Emma nude, but you only see her from behind. These are  two things I definitely appreciated.  The film is a little gory though it is mainly green alien blood and there is the occasional violence befitting a western.This is a decent family film if you have older children that don't scare easily.

The only clue to his past is a picture of a young woman and a metal contraption locked around his forearm. When he arrives in a nearby town of Absolution, trouble isn't far behind. But when strange lights from the sky arrive and begin shooting up the town and abducting its residents, the survivors decide to risk all to hunt the kidnappers and find their loved ones.Daniel Craig plays the amnesiac who comes to be known as Jake Lonergan. Craig is a stoic, hard man with a soft heart. When his past is revealed it's a bit of a shock, since it seemed to be against his nature. Harrison Ford also stars as Woodrow Dolarhyde, a tough war veteran, now rich and feared by the town and his employees. Sam Rockwell is Doc, a saloon owner who tries to toughen up to save his wife from abduction. And Olivia Wilde is the mysterious and beautiful Ella who seems to know something about Jake. The acting is solid and believable. Each character stands out and made the film worth watching.The characters and their stories are really what made the film. While the men had rough and tough exteriors, there was still plenty of heart. The feel was definitely a Western meets Alien, with plenty of violence and intense suspense and action. Clever one-liners throughout gave the film some much-needed laughs and light-hearted moments. Fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat excitement from beginning to end, Cowboys & Aliens certainly lives up to the hype.The story is only roughly based on the original graphic novel. This is a different story, yet still has riveting characters, a mystery, and non-stop adventure. This was the film I was looking forward to most this summer. And I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. The Old West setting was charming yet gritty. And the aliens are brutal and extremely powerful, but underestimate humans, so it's not a completely hopeless situation, nor silly. Both genres are treated with respect.

1395282,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B004BDOF1C,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[0, 1]","Cowboys and Aliens brings out an original concept and although is based on the comic book/graphic novel of the same name, is nearly a complete story in and of itself.The film starts out as a standard cowboy film; drunk, irresponsible son of a cattle baron screwing around with the locals since he feels his dad's name will protect him.  Part of the gang includes an American Indian whose later history is revealed and is quite touching.  But I am getting ahead of myself.It's night and just when you think you are going to watch another Western drama, the aliens come.  Their ships are sleek and fast.  They whip out these hooks and kidnap people off their horses, the street, stores, etc.  You really feel the passion, the fear and excitement as they come zooming in!Of course 19th century peoples have little concept of these so they are dumbstruck.  The plot rolls on like this, with an amnesiac cowboy and a strange weapon on his wrist; a cattle baron who has second thoughts about absolute power; and a woman from a strange planet, herself a victim of the alien hordes upon her own world.Harrison Ford is great as the crotchety old cattle baron, whose backstory is filled with tales of how to be a man and how his sympathy for those less powerful than himself changes the viewer's opinion of him.Daniel Craig plays Jake the amnesiac; barely escaped from the last alien culling, can't remember it and only knows that he must ride on.  But can he?And the third person, the woman from another world in human form who wants to help these 19th century men and women to avoid the fate that her world suffered from.  Great acting!Best Scene:  When the Cowboys & Indians fight the fast-moving aliens, it's really a site to behold.  Guns, arrows and laser explosions for a good 15 minutes of fanboy overload.Bottom Line:  The film plods along at times, and a plot hole or two prevent this one from making it five stars.  Still, loved the action, you care about the characters and really sympathize with Jake, a man out of his league but adapts to what is really needed of him.  The Spielberg touch with the turtle-like aliens, their delicate hands and fierce demeanor, really put in some frightful appearances.The DVD's special features including several Making Of's, how the aliens were formed, the creation of the aliens, some exclusive interviews with director Favereau, Spielberg and a few of the main actors.  Great product.Recommended.The cast includes:* Daniel Craig as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac outlaw* Harrison Ford as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful cattleman* Olivia Wilde as Ella Swenson, a mysterious traveler who aides Lonergan* Sam Rockwell as Doc, owner of the town's saloon* Paul Dano as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's trouble-making son* Clancy Brown as Meacham, Absolution's preacher and doctor* Keith Carradine as Sheriff John Taggart, Absolution's sheriff* Noah Ringer as Emmett Taggart, John Taggart's grandson",4,Aliens of the Old West!

Do aliens wait until the present time to decide to take a side trip to good ole Earth?Playing as a straight Western, which is where most of the movie is set, Cowboys and Aliens is a pretty darn good one.  Based upon a graphic novel (fancy comic book), C&A; has a great look.  It's dirty and dusty, and the small, dying Western town looks just right. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique uses the New Mexico locations to his advantage here.  The rugged landscape is forbidding, stark, and desolate.The plot as a Western isn't terribly original, but it's a decent one.  There are good guys in the town, and bad guys, with a ne're-do-well son of the town's richest citizen making trouble as they just seem wont to do.Then, the aliens show up.The special effects, some of which are done by Industrial Light and Magic, and as good as you'd expect (although why do aliens always have to be so complex looking?  They ooze mucus, they have body parts which open up and reveal surprises, and they just don't look as streamlined as, say, humans do.).  Anyway, the special effects are excellent, the flying craft excellent, and the explosions are very well done.Over all, the film gets four-and-a-half stars.  Harrison Ford is looking as craggy as he ages nicely.  Daniel Craig is as tough as they come, and Olivia Wilde (best known as one of the docs from 'House') is pretty, thin, and angular as you remember.  The pace never falters, and the action non-stop, and there are the predictable surprises that bring a big gasp from the audience.  There are a few plot 'huhs?', such as the reason for the aliens moseying down the space trail to Earth, but it is internally consistent if you buy why they are here.Recommended.  A good, solid, big-budget summer blockbuster from Dreamworks.",4,Solid Four and One Half Stars for this Western with a Twist!,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,2010,"['spoilers', 'here', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', 'fun', 'film', 'title', 'main', 'plot', 'Aliens', 'encounter', 'Earthlings', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'modern', 'era', 'back', '125', 'years', 'ago', 'perhaps', '20', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'why', 'not', 'Do', 'aliens', 'wait', 'present', 'time', 'decide', 'take', 'side', 'trip', 'good', 'ole', 'Earth', 'Playing', 'straight', 'Western', 'where', 'most', 'movie', 'set', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'one', 'Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'fancy', 'comic', 'book', 'C', 'A', 'great', 'look', 'dirty', 'dusty', 'small', 'dying', 'Western', 'town', 'looks', 'just', 'right', 'Cinematographer', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'New', 'Mexico', 'locations', 'advantage', 'here', 'rugged', 'landscape', 'forbidding', 'stark', 'desolate.The', 'plot', 'Western', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original', 'decent', 'one', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'town', 'bad', 'guys', ""ne're-do-well"", 'son', 'town', 'richest', 'citizen', 'making', 'trouble', 'just', 'seem', 'wont', 'do.Then', 'aliens', 'show', 'up.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'expect', 'why', 'do', 'aliens', 'always', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'complex', 'looking', 'ooze', 'mucus', 'have', 'body', 'parts', 'open', 'up', 'reveal', 'surprises', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'streamlined', 'say', 'humans', 'do.', 'Anyway', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'flying', 'craft', 'excellent', 'explosions', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'four-and-a-half', 'stars', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'looking', 'as', 'craggy', 'nicely', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'as', 'tough', 'come', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'best', 'known', 'one', 'docs', ""'House"", 'pretty', 'thin', 'angular', 'remember', 'pace', 'never', 'falters', 'action', 'non-stop', 'are', 'predictable', 'surprises', 'bring', 'big', 'gasp', 'audience', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'such', 'reason', 'aliens', 'moseying', 'down', 'space', 'trail', 'Earth', 'internally', 'consistent', 'buy', 'why', 'are', 'here.Recommended', 'good', 'solid', 'big-budget', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Dreamworks']",Cowboys & Aliens
1395285,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B004BDOF1C,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 4]","Jon Favreau's ""Cowboys and Aliens"" looks great, sounds great, and offers one of the best trailers around.  Indeed, for the first fifteen minutes, ""C&A;"" is a pure delight.But then the movie starts to reek of production notes and ""suggestions"" from the money that halt the movie more or less in its tracks, and the result is some fun, innocuous PG-13 pablum.First, the good.  Daniel Craig starts the movie as an anti-hero suffering from amnesia - it's clear he's a rough hombre, but he's also got some bizarre metallic bracelet clamped to his arm that foreshadows the titular aliens.  But this is the Old West, so Craig (whom we eventually learn is arch-gunslinger Jake Lonergan) has absolutely no appreciation for science fiction.  He moves onward.His path seems destined to cross with Harrison Ford, as the dastardly cattle baron Colonel Dolarhyde runs this part of the Old West.  Dolarhyde rules his realm without patience or mercy, and while he'll break his son out of jail (even though the loser belongs there), his son knows that dear old Dad's punishment will be worse than the jail.Just when these two alpha males cross swords, the aliens show up - fantastically.  The aliens fly into town and lasso half the locals in a wonderful set piece.  This sets up the big plot, which involves Dolarhyde and Lonergan leading a motley bunch of pistoleros against the aliens to get their people back.And once we're in pursuit of the aliens, the movie falls apart.  Dolarhyde, it turns out, isn't a great villain, but actually a soft-hearted guy who's just seen too many bad things.  Lonergan is all too willing to leave his bandit days behind.  And soon we're uniting the Law, train robbers, and Apaches in a multicultural raid against the alien stronghold.  All the menace and tension from the first fifteen minutes of the movie - when anyone could kill anyone at any time for less than no reason - has seeped out of the movie, leaving a limp balloon in its place.Fantastic special effects - just as good as anything Favreau did for ""Ironman"" - can't quite elevate the movie enough.  While not a bad movie, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" fails to reach its promise - perhaps if Favreau had cast a bunch of no-name actors instead of Hollywood royalty the movie wouldn't have cost $160 million to make, and then he could have made a great movie of daring and danger.  He did not.",3,"Glossy, gorgeous, but surprisingly lackluster genre mashup",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2364,"['Jon', 'Favreau', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'great', 'great', 'one', 'best', 'trailers', 'around', 'Indeed', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'C', 'A', 'pure', 'delight.But', 'then', 'movie', 'reek', 'production', 'notes', 'suggestions', 'money', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'tracks', 'result', 'fun', 'innocuous', 'PG-13', 'pablum.First', 'good', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'movie', 'anti-hero', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'clear', 'rough', 'hombre', 'also', 'got', 'bizarre', 'metallic', 'bracelet', 'clamped', 'arm', 'titular', 'aliens', 'Old', 'West', 'so', 'Craig', 'whom', 'eventually', 'learn', 'arch-gunslinger', 'Jake', 'Lonergan', 'absolutely', 'appreciation', 'science', 'fiction', 'onward.His', 'path', 'destined', 'cross', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'dastardly', 'cattle', 'baron', 'Colonel', 'Dolarhyde', 'part', 'Old', 'West', 'Dolarhyde', 'rules', 'realm', 'patience', 'mercy', ""'ll"", 'break', 'son', 'jail', 'even', 'loser', 'son', 'dear', 'old', 'Dad', 'punishment', 'will', 'be', 'worse', 'jail.Just', 'when', 'two', 'alpha', 'males', 'cross', 'swords', 'aliens', 'show', 'up', 'fantastically', 'aliens', 'fly', 'town', 'lasso', 'locals', 'wonderful', 'set', 'piece', 'up', 'big', 'plot', 'Dolarhyde', 'Lonergan', 'leading', 'motley', 'bunch', 'pistoleros', 'aliens', 'get', 'people', 'back.And', 'once', ""'re"", 'pursuit', 'aliens', 'movie', 'apart', 'Dolarhyde', 'out', ""n't"", 'great', 'villain', 'actually', 'soft-hearted', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'Lonergan', 'too', 'willing', 'leave', 'bandit', 'days', 'soon', ""'re"", 'uniting', 'Law', 'train', 'robbers', 'Apaches', 'multicultural', 'raid', 'alien', 'stronghold', 'menace', 'tension', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'anyone', 'could', 'kill', 'anyone', 'time', 'less', 'reason', 'seeped', 'movie', 'leaving', 'limp', 'balloon', 'place.Fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Favreau', 'did', 'Ironman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'elevate', 'movie', 'enough', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'reach', 'promise', 'perhaps', 'Favreau', 'had', 'cast', 'bunch', 'no-name', 'actors', 'instead', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cost', '160', 'million', 'make', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'daring', 'danger', 'did', 'not']",Cowboys & Aliens
1395286,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B004BDOF1C,Sesho,"[0, 2]","Well, you have to say this about Cowboys and Aliens: It knows exactly what is. I mean, the name of the movie IS Cowboys and Aliens. So you have to tip your hat to it for its honesty. I have never read the graphic novel that this movie is based on, so I can't vouch for how close Jon Favreau's movie stays with it.For once in a western, the main character really IS a ""Man With No Name"" as Daniel Craig wakes up in the middle of a desert in the Old West with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Unfortunately for him, the residents of the nearby town haven't forgotten him. They know him as Jake Lonergan, a notorious outlaw wanted for robbery and murder among other things. He doesn't help his situation by racking the ne'er do well son of the local cattle baron, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), in the groin either. Dolarhyde. Wow. That is a name steeped in all kinds of allusions, isn't it?....money, Mr. Hyde, formaldehyde, Dickens, etc. Woodrow is borderline psychotic because of his Civil War experiences so he lives up to some of the connotations of his name. Jake is about to get hauled off to trial to face his crimes, when ray beam blasting aliens from outer space send the whole town to Hell! Luckily for the humans, Jake has an alien wrist weapon that allows him to use the rootin tootin sci-fi tech of the aliens against them. Olivia Wilde also shows up as a mysterious gun-toting woman named Ella who is much more than she seems. And she stays that way, mysterious, before eventually giving some of her background that lasts all of 1 minute. Wilde is horribly utilized in this movie, mainly because her only function seems to be to say ""They're here"" when the aliens so obviously show up on the scene. It's up to Jake to find a way to lead the townspeople, outlaws, Native Americans, kids, and even dogs against some aliens who vaguely resemble miniature Rancors.Like so many movies these days, Cowboys and Aliens is ok to watch once and be entertained, but you probably will never want to see it again. In that respect it reminds me a lot of Favreau's Iron Man films. And I can expand that to most movies based on comic books that have come out in recent years. They look flashy, they pop, they sizzle, but in the end they shrivel under closer inspection.If there's one thing I can't stand about alien movies, it's when the aliens are basically just like us. In other words, Star Wars anthropomorphic boringness. I much prefer the creepiness of aliens like those in 2001, Solaris, or even the original Alien (although that may change after Prometheus). The whole ""the aliens are here to steal our resources"" shtick is just so old at this point. Can't we imagine aliens that go beyond just our own oil-sucking fantasies?I was kinda surprised that Harrison Ford took this role since he's always critical of his Star Wars movies like they were so far beneath him. It almost made me laugh when I saw him go all Marlon Brando with Woodrow and try to make him into a living breathing character right out of Unforgiven. Daniel Craig did a good job even though without Bond behind his name, he's really not a leading man.This movie didn't do very well, costing $163 million to make and only grossing around $100 million in the US. Taking foreign revenue into account, it made about a $10 million profit which is probably way below what the studio was expecting.I wouldn't buy this movie, but it's definitely worth a rental.",3,WHAT'S THIS LASER FIRING THING ON MY WRIST?,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,3440,"['Well', 'have', 'say', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'exactly', 'what', 'mean', 'name', 'movie', 'IS', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'have', 'tip', 'hat', 'honesty', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'how', 'close', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'movie', 'it.For', 'once', 'western', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'Man', 'Name', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'up', 'middle', 'desert', 'Old', 'West', 'memory', 'who', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'residents', 'nearby', 'town', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'know', 'Jake', 'Lonergan', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'wanted', 'robbery', 'murder', 'other', 'things', ""n't"", 'help', 'situation', 'racking', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'son', 'local', 'cattle', 'baron', 'Woodrow', 'Dolarhyde', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'groin', 'Dolarhyde', 'Wow', 'name', 'steeped', 'kinds', 'allusions', ""n't"", '.money', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'formaldehyde', 'Dickens', 'etc', 'Woodrow', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'Civil', 'War', 'experiences', 'so', 'up', 'connotations', 'name', 'Jake', 'get', 'hauled', 'off', 'trial', 'face', 'crimes', 'when', 'ray', 'beam', 'blasting', 'aliens', 'outer', 'space', 'send', 'whole', 'town', 'Hell', 'Luckily', 'humans', 'Jake', 'alien', 'wrist', 'weapon', 'use', 'rootin', 'tootin', 'sci-fi', 'tech', 'aliens', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'also', 'up', 'mysterious', 'gun-toting', 'woman', 'named', 'Ella', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'way', 'mysterious', 'eventually', 'giving', 'background', '1', 'minute', 'Wilde', 'horribly', 'utilized', 'movie', 'mainly', 'only', 'function', 'be', 'say', ""'re"", 'here', 'when', 'aliens', 'so', 'obviously', 'show', 'up', 'scene', 'up', 'Jake', 'find', 'way', 'lead', 'townspeople', 'outlaws', 'Native', 'Americans', 'kids', 'even', 'dogs', 'aliens', 'who', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'miniature', 'Rancors.Like', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'ok', 'watch', 'once', 'be', 'entertained', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'respect', 'lot', 'Favreau', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'can', 'expand', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'look', 'flashy', 'pop', 'sizzle', 'end', 'shrivel', 'closer', 'inspection.If', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'alien', 'movies', 'when', 'aliens', 'are', 'basically', 'just', 'other', 'words', 'Star', 'Wars', 'anthropomorphic', 'boringness', 'much', 'prefer', 'creepiness', 'aliens', '2001', 'Solaris', 'even', 'original', 'Alien', 'may', 'change', 'Prometheus', 'whole', 'aliens', 'are', 'here', 'steal', 'resources', 'shtick', 'just', 'so', 'old', 'point', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'aliens', 'go', 'just', 'own', 'oil-sucking', 'fantasies', 'was', 'kinda', 'surprised', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'took', 'role', 'always', 'critical', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'beneath', 'almost', 'made', 'when', 'saw', 'go', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Woodrow', 'try', 'make', 'living', 'breathing', 'character', 'right', 'Unforgiven', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'Bond', 'name', 'really', 'not', 'leading', 'man.This', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'costing', '163', 'million', 'make', 'only', 'grossing', 'around', '100', 'million', 'US', 'Taking', 'foreign', 'revenue', 'account', 'made', '10', 'million', 'profit', 'probably', 'way', 'what', 'studio', 'was', 'expecting.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental']",Cowboys & Aliens

But those titles might inadvertently reflect a bit more frustration than I actually experienced with Cowboys and Aliens (plus those titles just weren't really very clever). So instead of trying to express my opinion of this flick in the title of my review, I'll just briefly say it since I'm so late to the party here.I actually thought that Cowboys and Aliens started off quite well. The story seemed to be progressing towards a climactic, epic finish. The plot builds with a lot of fun, but clich&eacute;, Wild West bad guys, sheriffs, drunks and posses bickering about this and that. Seems like a decent, well done Western...and then the aliens show up and the movie goes from pretty good to pretty silly.I do think that the acting was quite good. It has Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde....A great cast with Iron Man's Jon Favreau directing. The cast sold me on sticking with the film with an open mind, and while the CGI was excellent the action became goofy and unrealistic.I was entertained (and I'll probably even give the movie another watch-through when it comes to cable).

1395331,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B004BDOF1C,Tom Benton,"[2, 6]","At least one critic has suggested that ""Cowboys & Aliens"" should have been done as a comedy, like ""Men in Black,"" but the film wouldn't have been half as valuable if its creators had taken that approach.  Half of audiences seem to think it was unsuccessful anyway, apparently confused by the blending of a genre reputed to be harshly realistic and a genre known for its driven sprint from reality.  ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is an impressively smooth marriage of both genres, considering its straight-faced approach.Like many newlyweds after the honeymoon, this marriage has left those involved a little disoriented: the script rarely seems confident in its direction, and there are a couple contrivances for the sake of convenience toward the end.  It's wisely simple, like so much of the best sci-fi, but creative, too, more creative than the ""Independence Day""-in-the-old-west ads have suggested.  It's more like a pulp sci-fi fantasy from the days of Edgar Rice Burroughs, if Larry McMurtry had been around to help.Thank goodness for the bold-chested confidence of Jon Favreau's direction, which guides the film and inspires it to carry on, and have a good time doing so.  Favreau's jokester image post-""Swingers"" should now be shattered post-""Cowboys & Aliens"": he made ""Iron Man"" a surprise triumph, saved ""Iron Man 2"" from the meandering attention-deficit script resulting from a rushed production, and now he's shot ""Cowboys & Aliens"" with impressive steadyness and equal helpings of reserve and flair.  It's best when it recalls ""Unforgiven,"" although Favreau's tight panoramas have more color in them than any image from Clint Eastwood's film.  His sureness is the glue that holds together this strange narrative.  Its success is his own.Daniel Craig plays the hero, an amnesiac with a bizarre bracelet.  Craig was cast for his resemblance to ""The Magnificent Seven""'s Yul Brenner.  He performs with a hoarse brashness and undercuttingly nasal American accent that would knock Brenner off his feet.  He's nowhere near as brash as Harrison Ford's domineering colonel-turned-cattle-rancher, possibly Ford's sole turn as a villain (the quality of his character in ""The Mosquito Coast"" is debatable).  Ford's performances seem to be growing increasingly delightful: first his left-field knockout performance in the awful ""Morning Glory,"" and now his deliciously devilish portrayal of a right American bastard (although, unfortunately, his character and thus his performance seems to have turned around at the film's end).  Ford may not have enough screen time to clearly be the jewel of the cast--but he is.Olivia Wilde, who charmed in ""Tron: Legacy,"" charms here as well.  She's so charming that the audience seems to immediately clamor for Craig to forget the woman who starts him on his journey and fall for Wilde instead.  Paul Dano is also charming in the opposite way.  He's mastered the role of the contemptuous hypocrite, first in ""There Will Be Blood"" and now here.  He's on-screen for a total of no more than 10 minutes, but he makes an impression.So does the film.  It's a soft impression, when it's over: it's surprisingly good, the kind of good that keeps one happy and entertained and even occasionally riveted during the course of the film, but also the kind of good that falls short of great and doesn't cry out for further investigation.  ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a simple film, despite the seemingly complex task of blending the science-fiction and western genres, but it's a good one.

That's what I have to say about C&A;, thus far I've taken critics and other reviewers like myself with a grain of salt because with films such as these you simply cannot take them seriously, why should this film have be any different? The acting was tremendous for those who do not know Daniel Craig he is English, so his accent is heavy more so then some Englishmen who have taken lead roles in American films. However this is quite different he plays a ""cowboy"", hardly anyone can pull that off correctly, a Englishmen to say the least (yet he did). His American accent as always was A+, but in this film its rougher, just like most western actors he really wanted to fit the part, and he did.The Story, well many many viewers complain that the story is just ""stupid"", or ""simple"", so? Often we go to the movies and see a wonderful story, but we don't like the way it unfolds visually, other time's visuals and action or just acting alone makes a movie compelling yet we leave frustrated in the way the story itself unraveled. Beggars can't be choosers, this film I would categorize as a film that meets many qualifications that it really doesn't need (like a complete transformation from Craig as a charming ""Bond"" Englishmen to a rough American Cowboy)yet it lacks some qualities such as an undeveloped story (although I won't take a star off as it was based on a graphic novel).All in all its fun, and like some of you who are giving this negative reviews, I to like a artsy film that makes me think, and other times I like a film such as Cowboys and Aliens, as it brings me joy as well, so why not?...Go Watch it!

Some of the visuals were pretty cool, though the aliens themself were humdrum typical (except for their tiny hands).

He awakes with no memory and discovers a strange device on his arm that, despite numerous efforts, he can't remove. Before he's made any real assessment of his situation, he's discovered by three men who believe he'll bring them a windfall when they turn him over to the authorities. But, despite his memory loss, he makes short work of his would-be captors and moves on. Victorious but still with no memory.His wandering brings him to the nearby town of Absolution. Its inhabitants are nowhere to be seen until the local preacher (Clancy Brown) discovers him and offers to stitch the wound he (Craig) discovered when he awoke. Unfortunately, they are interrupted when Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), son of the town's benefactor and all-around miscreant, causes a commotion and accidentally kills a Marshall and (Craig) subdues him. As a result, he's identified and arrested for crimes he's previously committed. Our amnesiac's name is Jake Lonergan and before being transferred, the town is attacked by mysterious creatures first referred to as demons but that are, of course, aliens. Hence the title.I was as wary as anyone when I saw the title of this film. I expected a farce with a poorly written script and star-studded cast.

Set in 1873 Arizona, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is about cowboys and aliens, or more precisely, about cowboys determined to rescue the townspeople from aliens. Based on a 2006 comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, a big-budget genre crossover (co-executive produced by Steven Spielberg) has two big names Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford (credited in this order).Harrison Ford's character, an influential, iron-fisted cattleman Woodrow Dolarhyde, sets out to save his spoiled son Percy (Paul Dano) from monster-like creatures. Also, there is another cowboy in ""Cowboys & Aliens,"" Daniel Craig's lone cowboy with no memories of his past. He is a stranger in the small town of Absolution, where Dolarhyde virtually rules. Craig's role, reminiscent of young Clint Eastwood, is slightly bigger than Ford's. Ella, a mysterious woman played by Olivia Wilde, seems interested in this amnesiac gunman.Part of the story reminds us of a John Ford classic ""The Searchers,"" and ""Cowboys & Aliens"" looks more like a western movie with sci-fi treatment, than a sci-fi film with a western twist. Director Jon Favreau, known for the ""Iron Man"" films, takes the idea of blending two genres seriously, and in ""Cowboys & Aliens"" he plays it very straight.While it works to some extent, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" suffers from the weak storyline and underwritten characters. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford do their best, but their characters remain one dimensional. Supporting actors include Clancy Brown, Sam Rockwell and Keith Carradine, but they don't have much to do. Special effects are decent, but not really special. Action scenes are reasonably entertaining, but not very imaginative.""Cowboys & Aliens"" is fairly entertaining movie, but considering the unique concept and the talented players involved in the project, this is a little disappointing.",3,Entertaining Though Not Really Unique as the Title Suggests,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,1867,"['film', 'title', 'well', 'most', 'Set', '1873', 'Arizona', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'cowboys', 'aliens', 'more', 'precisely', 'cowboys', 'determined', 'rescue', 'townspeople', 'aliens', 'Based', '2006', 'comic', 'Scott', 'Mitchell', 'Rosenberg', 'big-budget', 'genre', 'crossover', 'co-executive', 'produced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'two', 'big', 'names', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'credited', 'order', '.Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'influential', 'iron-fisted', 'cattleman', 'Woodrow', 'Dolarhyde', 'out', 'save', 'spoiled', 'son', 'Percy', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'monster-like', 'creatures', 'Also', 'cowboy', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'lone', 'cowboy', 'memories', 'past', 'stranger', 'small', 'town', 'Absolution', 'where', 'Dolarhyde', 'virtually', 'rules', 'Craig', 'role', 'reminiscent', 'young', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'Ford', 'Ella', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'interested', 'amnesiac', 'gunman.Part', 'story', 'John', 'Ford', 'Searchers', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'more', 'western', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'treatment', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'western', 'twist', 'Director', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'known', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'idea', 'blending', 'two', 'genres', 'seriously', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'very', 'extent', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'suffers', 'weak', 'storyline', 'underwritten', 'characters', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'do', 'best', 'characters', 'remain', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'decent', 'not', 'really', 'special', 'Action', 'scenes', 'are', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'not', 'very', 'imaginative', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'considering', 'unique', 'concept', 'talented', 'players', 'involved', 'project', 'little', 'disappointing']",Cowboys & Aliens

The presentation of two different genres of film taking place during the same century was interesting. It was refreshing to see producers and directors taking the chance of combining those two genres in film version (versus existing graphic art publications). The casting of Adam Beach and Jose Raoul Trujillo in indigenous roles were excellent decisions. I've always held Beach's acting capabilities in high regard; his casting in this film was, in fact, the primary reason I purchased the DVD. I suspect Hollywood will be reluctant to pursue more of these mixed-genres in film simply because of resistance by many earth residents to the fact that life exists concurrently in other  galaxies/spiritual realms and, probably/potentially, at a more advanced stage than our own. The choreography and digital work on this film was excellent. I cannot say the same for the bonus items on the DVD. The blatant lack of inclusion of the two leading actors in &#34;Indian&#34; roles (Beach and Trujillo) in the bonus items (interviews, promotional, etc.) was very disappointing.

Imagine if H.G. Wells had written ""War of the Worlds"" as a western instead of taking place in Victorian England and if it was crossed with Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and you'll get an idea as to how director Jon Favreau's film of the graphic novel of the same name plays out. The film reminds me a bit of Ray Harryhausen's ""The Valley of Gwangi"" if we replace the dinosaur with aliens--an interesting if not entirely successful combination of two very different genres.The first hour of the film works extremely well and Daniel Craig who resembles Steve McQueen from ""The Magnficient Seven"" fits the role of Jake Lonergan (a man who has no memory of what he's done or who he is) perfectly. He's discovered in the middle of nowhere by a trio of hunters with a weird mechanical device attached to his wrist that can blast anything to smithereens. After he's arrested in town Longergan finds the device handy in fighting alien spaceships that fly in and rope the towns people like cattle.If nothing else the first hour proves that should Daniel Craig choose to do a western and play a character like Eastwood's ""The Man-With-No-Name"", he'd do a terrific job. A bit of trivia about the movie--Ford has played oppostie TWO actors that have played James Bond (Craig and Sean Connery in ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"").Harrison Ford as cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde does a good job as Longergan's nemesis who ends up working with Longergan to try and save his son.The Blu-ray looks terrific with a demo quality disc.The film looks amazingly sharp throughout and has nice depth without sacrificing the ""look"" of a film. Audio is terrific--it's a strong, immersive Lossless presentation and it helps one appreciate the terrific sound mixing and editing done on the film.The special features include a commentary track from the director, a documentary that covers the film from conception to production. You can also unlock an interactive ""second screen"" presentation of the special features on your iPad. Although I have an iPad I really wanted to just watch the material rather than play with this special ap/feature. It uses Universal's U-Control features.We also get both the theatrical cut of the movie and an extended one that runs about 17 minutes longer and actually (in my opinion) improves the film.You can also use the (dreaded)Ultra-Violet streaming format to watch the film and there's also a DVD included as well as the option of downloading a digital copy of the film.Although the second half of the movie is flawed, I didn't think that ""Cowboys and Aliens"" was quite as bad as everyone made it out to be when it was released theatrically and, certainly, the extended cut is better than the theatrical version with better character development and a couple of extended scenes.

I love Westerns and I love Science Fiction movies from both genres that are fun. Conceptually this is a great idea mixing the genres as they have done. My initial review is that it begins very well, sags in the middle, then picks up in the final few acts.The special effects are very well done. I really enjoy the design of the aliens. They are menacing and threatening with no regard for human life. The acting is very well done. Both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig offer believable characters that are not one dimensional. Both men are tough, full of pride and though they are on different sides of the issue at the start of the movie it is not so easy to distinguish the typical western good guy from the bad guy. The plot is creative and they way typical adversaries in western movies all come together to battle the aliens flows well into the story and is not forced and artificial.Once the aliens arrive and the back story of Daniel Craig's character is explored is when the movie begins to sag. Other things also happen that slows down the pacing of the movie. One event is the revelation of another alien which is used to explain the motive of the invading aliens. I think they could have found another way for exposition and it would have quicken the pacing. The other reason the middle of the movie sags is that many scenes take place in the dark and it is difficult to view what was happening. I wish movie makers would lighten night scenes just a bit so we the viewer could see a bit more of what is going on.The final confrontation with the aliens is when the movie come back to life and returns to the pacing and quality story telling that it began with.

1395365,AP3B615GM191G,B004BDOF1C,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","""Cowboys & Aliens"" is the definition of an uneven film.  While watching it, you will likely be riveted by the special effects, atmosphere, and just overall unique concept of the movie.  In retrospect, though, there is absolutely nothing about the flick that leaves a last influence on the viewer.For a basic plot summary, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" sees wanted cowboy Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wake up in an Old West (equipped with a futuristic bracelet) with no recollection of who he is or what he's done to be a marked man.  As Jake begins to remember himself, the town is attacked by mysterious alien spacecrafts that ""rope"" certain citizens and fly them off into the night sky.  Town leader Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) must then work with Jake (as well as a local band of Indians) to put aside their differences and combat the alien presence.In terms of ""overall experience"", this is an incredible popcorn flick.  The alien technology is entrancing, the mood is darkly palpable (at least in the early goings), and the action/adventure rules the production throughout.  Simply put, you can't look away once you've begun watching.The trouble, however, is that this is a ""concept film"" at heart.  It is like the original story creators (I believe it was based on a graphic novel or some such thing) had this thought process: ""Okay, a guy wakes up in the middle of the old West possessing alien technology, then must defend a town from the aliens.  So, what do we do next?""  As such, the ""mystery"" portion of this movie (roughly first 45 minutes) is much more compelling than the ""fighting and climax"" portions, where everything kind of gets messed up and loses its edge.The acting is also a bit mixed.  Ford, as per his usual talent, slides effortlessly into his role and provides the best performance of the bunch.  Craig, on the other hand, is so emotionally subdued throughout the picture that it is tough to really get behind him and root for his cause.  Not helping matters is the presence of Olivia Wilde, who was obviously only cast so they could use her semi-nude body in the trailer (her part is severely underdeveloped & pretty much meaningless in the end).Overall, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a decent action-adventure flick...but little else.  You'll have fun watching it, but when the credits roll your mind will quickly turn elsewhere, as there just isn't any deeper substance to ponder or recollect.",3,"A Thrill Ride, But Nothing Memorable",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2411,"['Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'definition', 'uneven', 'film', 'watching', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'riveted', 'special', 'effects', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'overall', 'unique', 'concept', 'movie', 'retrospect', 'though', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'flick', 'last', 'influence', 'viewer.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'wanted', 'cowboy', 'Jake', 'Lonergan', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'wake', 'up', 'Old', 'West', 'equipped', 'futuristic', 'bracelet', 'recollection', 'who', 'what', 'done', 'be', 'marked', 'man', 'Jake', 'remember', 'town', 'attacked', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'spacecrafts', 'rope', 'certain', 'citizens', 'fly', 'off', 'night', 'sky', 'Town', 'leader', 'Woodrow', 'Dolarhyde', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'must', 'then', 'work', 'Jake', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'band', 'Indians', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'combat', 'alien', 'presence.In', 'terms', 'overall', 'experience', 'incredible', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'alien', 'technology', 'entrancing', 'mood', 'darkly', 'palpable', 'least', 'early', 'goings', 'action/adventure', 'rules', 'production', 'Simply', 'put', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'once', ""'ve"", 'begun', 'watching.The', 'trouble', 'however', 'concept', 'film', 'heart', 'original', 'story', 'creators', 'believe', 'was', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'such', 'thing', 'had', 'thought', 'process', 'Okay', 'guy', 'up', 'middle', 'old', 'West', 'possessing', 'alien', 'technology', 'then', 'must', 'defend', 'town', 'aliens', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'next', 'such', 'mystery', 'portion', 'movie', 'roughly', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'fighting', 'climax', 'portions', 'where', 'everything', 'kind', 'messed', 'up', 'edge.The', 'acting', 'also', 'bit', 'mixed', 'Ford', 'usual', 'talent', 'effortlessly', 'role', 'best', 'performance', 'bunch', 'Craig', 'other', 'hand', 'so', 'emotionally', 'subdued', 'picture', 'tough', 'really', 'get', 'root', 'cause', 'Not', 'helping', 'matters', 'presence', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'only', 'cast', 'could', 'use', 'semi-nude', 'body', 'trailer', 'part', 'severely', 'underdeveloped', 'pretty', 'much', 'meaningless', 'end', '.Overall', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'decent', 'action-adventure', 'flick', 'little', 'else', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'mind', 'will', 'quickly', 'turn', 'elsewhere', 'just', ""n't"", 'deeper', 'substance', 'ponder', 'recollect']",Cowboys & Aliens

1395368,AJD9EA658HCFW,B004BDOF1C,zck7592,"[4, 6]","When this film was in production, I was very excited for it. The reason was because of the interesting theme of Cowboys mixed with Aliens. Who better to be Executive Producer than Steven Spielberg, the king of alien films. Also, on the Cowboy side, you have acting legend Harrison Ford, who wonderfully portrays a Cowboy. With Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci doing the Screenplay, I had no doubts that ""Cowboys & Aliens"" would at very least be interesting.For a general plot summary, the film begins with Daniel Craig's character (Jake Lonergan) waking up in the middle of the dessert, with a steel bracelet on his arm. He wonders into the nearest town, where he discovers that mysterious, alien-like spacecrafts have been taking people and his bracelet is the only weapon that damages the Aliens.Meanwhile, rich cattle owner Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) discovers the aliens have captured his son, so Lonergan and himself lead an attack on the Alien base.Overall, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a very entertaining and enjoyable film.

1395370,A12LKEM543ILBK,B004BDOF1C,zombie phreak,"[1, 1]","So I didn't see this one in theaters because just the concept seemed stupid to me.  Aliens and Cowboys.  Really?  Was Hollywood really this intellectually bankrupt that they were stooping to just putting two random concepts together and hoping they'd get something that the public liked?I like many things that are opposites.  I love zombies, I love Marvel super heroes.  I didn't want to put them together, but unfortunately Marvel did and they got the abomination that is now known as Marvel Zombies.  I love Star Wars, and I love zombies, I NEVER wanted to put them together.  But Joe Scrhreiber did and we got the horrible steaming pile of ""book"" that was ""Death Troopers.""So when I saw Aliens and Cowboys I threw my hands up in disgust and refused to pay $10.00 USD to see it in theaters, but when I saw it in the Red Box for $1.00, I figured that it was better than watching re-runs of Storage Wars so I picked it up for the night.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***Right off the bat this starts out as a bad-ass western, and I haven't seen a good western in years!  So to see how awesome this was starting out was a HUGE surprise and a welcome one!  I also was questioning where the main character got his nifty little bracelet thingy and why he couldn't remember, but honestly I knew those questions would be answered soon so I kept watching.I have NEVER seen Harrison Ford play a bad guy before, but he knocked it out of the park with this performance!  Having him play a cattle baron who is a former war hero in a wild west town was awesome!Then the aliens show up.  I immediately thought, ""Okay here we go with the campy costumes and lame ships,"" but again I was wrong!  I was blown away by how good the special effects were, the ships looked awesome!  The explosions were cool, and the idea that something so small as a bracelet taking down these fighter ships was pretty friggin' awesome!So then the ships are snatching up people and taking them back to their base to do god knows what with them.  We never really find out what they are doing with these people other than they are all standing around with some kinda restraints on and they're starring at a giant water balloon looking like zombies.So we find out that the aliens are also taking members of the local Native American tribe and they want to get their family members back too and they're ready to ride off into battle but they need a leader.  Who better to do that then the guy who was Indiana Jones AND Han Solo?  Harrison Ford draws the aliens out and the cowboys and natives do battle with the aliens while the main character goes inside to find and free everyone.We also find out that the aliens are harvesting gold for some reason.  This really bugged me.  What were they using it for?  We're never told.  Seriously, did it have monetary value on their planet?  Was it food?  Was it a fuel source?  Did they need it to build some sort of technology?  Seriously I don't care which, but just pick one and tell the audience.  Like in Avatar, we wanted the ore because it had monetary value and it had technological uses.  Or in Independence Day, the aliens came and wanted our planet cuz theirs was dead and they needed a new place to live.  Or even in Battle:  Los Angeles, the aliens needed water because they used it as a fuel source.  Just a little clarification would be nice.So the movie ends and the alien foundry is blown up and everyone is rescued.  Harrison Ford's character and the main character put aside their differences and our main character rides off into the sunset.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***There's really very little about this movie I didn't like, just the gold issue and what the humans were being used for.
