529904,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B00003CXNX,AIROLF,"[0, 0]","Having heard a lot about this movie for years, I was disappoint to finally watch it and see that it's more a love story than a true depiction of a girl, a woman, breaking through the barriers of a male-dominated society and getting into boxing. Although the movie does have a boxing storyline at its center, it often looses its way in its overall theme and stumbles. Michelle Rodriguez though, has a natural knack for acting (this is her debut role) and tends to make the best of her moody scenes. Overall, this is a good indie feature but it's hardly an earth-shattering film.",3,girls can pack a mean punch too,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,577,"['Having', 'heard', 'lot', 'movie', 'years', 'was', 'disappoint', 'finally', 'watch', 'see', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'true', 'depiction', 'girl', 'woman', 'breaking', 'barriers', 'male-dominated', 'society', 'getting', 'boxing', 'movie', 'have', 'boxing', 'storyline', 'center', 'often', 'way', 'overall', 'theme', 'stumbles', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'natural', 'knack', 'acting', 'debut', 'role', 'make', 'best', 'moody', 'scenes', 'Overall', 'good', 'indie', 'feature', 'hardly', 'earth-shattering', 'film']",Girlfight VHS
529905,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXNX,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","A lot of people have written off Michele Rodriguez.  I totally get that.  I mean, I really totally understand that.  That is why, when I defend her, I understand why people don't bother to listen.  It's not that she has produced a lot of amazing work, and her personal life is simply a mess.  That said; if you haven't seen her marvelous performance in `Girlfight' then I really think you need to sit down and breathe it all it.As a tough Brooklyn teen, Rodriguez plays the role of Diana.  Diana has a troubled life (not the least of her problems being her father) and is prone to violence in school.  When she seeks an outlet for her anger, she turns to boxing (naturally).  At first she is somewhat dismissed, but Diana is not only physically tough, she is mentally determined and that goes a long way.  Through this new facet of her life, Diana is able to exercise personal demons in a constructive and ultimately rewarding way.It won't be easy, but it'll be worth it.There are some conventional clich&eacute;s in the script that emerge as the film draws in for the finale (that whole love interest subplot is rather unnecessary but the romance sells tickets so I understand it) but overall this is just a simple yet poignant story being told very well.  There are no shocking revelations or big reveals and twists here and the story isn't one that will blow you away or haunt you, but it is to-the-point and sincere.So, let's talk about Michele Rodriguez for a minute.  Her performance here is just phenomenal.  The way that she effortlessly captures every ounce of this woman's soul, it is just so engaging and powerfully mesmerizing.  There are some roles that some actors or actresses seem born to play.  This is the case for Michele and the role of Diana.  She embodies the pain, the hurt, the anger, the fierce determination.  She commands every scene.  It is no surprise at all to me that she racked up those critics awards for breakthrough actress.She really was astonishing.So, while there may be nothing overly remarkable about the film, it is a very well made and acted drama that will engage and reward the viewer; most definitely.",4,Life can be an uphill battle...,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,2146,"['lot', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'off', 'Michele', 'Rodriguez', 'totally', 'get', 'mean', 'really', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'when', 'defend', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'listen', 'not', 'produced', 'lot', 'amazing', 'work', 'personal', 'life', 'simply', 'mess', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Girlfight', 'then', 'really', 'think', 'need', 'sit', 'down', 'breathe', 'it.As', 'tough', 'Brooklyn', 'teen', 'Rodriguez', 'role', 'Diana', 'Diana', 'troubled', 'life', 'not', 'least', 'problems', 'being', 'father', 'prone', 'violence', 'school', 'When', 'outlet', 'anger', 'boxing', 'naturally', 'first', 'somewhat', 'dismissed', 'Diana', 'not', 'only', 'physically', 'tough', 'mentally', 'determined', 'long', 'way', 'new', 'facet', 'life', 'Diana', 'able', 'exercise', 'personal', 'demons', 'constructive', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'way.It', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'worth', 'are', 'conventional', 'clich', 'eacute', 'script', 'emerge', 'film', 'draws', 'finale', 'whole', 'love', 'interest', 'subplot', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'romance', 'tickets', 'so', 'understand', 'overall', 'just', 'simple', 'yet', 'poignant', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'shocking', 'revelations', 'big', 'reveals', 'twists', 'here', 'story', ""n't"", 'one', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'haunt', 'to-the-point', 'sincere.So', 'let', 'talk', 'Michele', 'Rodriguez', 'minute', 'performance', 'here', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'way', 'effortlessly', 'ounce', 'woman', 'soul', 'just', 'so', 'engaging', 'powerfully', 'mesmerizing', 'are', 'roles', 'actors', 'actresses', 'seem', 'born', 'play', 'case', 'Michele', 'role', 'Diana', 'pain', 'hurt', 'anger', 'fierce', 'determination', 'scene', 'surprise', 'racked', 'up', 'critics', 'awards', 'breakthrough', 'actress.She', 'really', 'was', 'astonishing.So', 'may', 'be', 'nothing', 'overly', 'remarkable', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'acted', 'drama', 'will', 'engage', 'reward', 'viewer', 'most', 'definitely']",Girlfight VHS
529906,A2SBGTE825H1N3,B00003CXNX,ANDY COLE,"[2, 4]","Writer/Director Karyn Kusama's tour de force about the fledgling world of women pugilists brilliantly showcases the beauty, athletism and talent of star-in-the making Michelle Rodriguez (Diana Guzman).Handsome Santiago Douglas as Diana's love interest, Adrian, is not only poetry in motion in his boxing scenes but his character is strongly defined, well acted and believable.Hector (Jaime Tirelli) as Diana's boxing coach is solidly behind her and teacher her not just the moves but also the strategy and mindset a successful boxer must have in order to win. He believes in her when no one else does -- possibly not even herself.The love story between Diana and Adrian is put to the test both figuratively and literally. When she runs to him and they hold each other it is less about sex and more about two people who have not been held enough or loved enough and find that physical contact can be rewarding and gratifying instead of always brutal.Eventually of course you know that they must meet in the ring.All of the boxing scenes are gritty, tough and very real -- no punches were pulled in the filming of these scenes.The character of Diana's little brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) could have been explored a little more -- there may be a whole further film there.The cinematography by Patrick Cady moves from frenetic while in the ring to soft, sweet and intimate in the tender and quiet moments.The soundtrack is very nice -- adding just the right touches of emotion at precisely the right times.I wonder how many people that see this film make the connection that Ira (Tom Barbour) the owner/manager of the seedy boxing gym where most of the action takes place is also the billionaire father of Dudley Moore in the `Arthur' films!This is a first rate film with great production values, a great cast that has a compelling story to work with all put together by a brilliant director.It is a knock out!",5,`There's all kinds of fighters out there.',1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,1905,"['Writer/Director', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'fledgling', 'world', 'women', 'pugilists', 'brilliantly', 'beauty', 'athletism', 'talent', 'star-in-the', 'making', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'Diana', 'Guzman', '.Handsome', 'Santiago', 'Douglas', 'Diana', 'love', 'interest', 'Adrian', 'not', 'only', 'poetry', 'motion', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'character', 'strongly', 'defined', 'well', 'acted', 'believable.Hector', 'Jaime', 'Tirelli', 'Diana', 'boxing', 'coach', 'solidly', 'teacher', 'not', 'just', 'moves', 'also', 'strategy', 'mindset', 'successful', 'boxer', 'must', 'have', 'order', 'win', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'possibly', 'not', 'even', 'herself.The', 'love', 'story', 'Diana', 'Adrian', 'put', 'test', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'When', 'hold', 'other', 'less', 'sex', 'more', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'held', 'enough', 'loved', 'enough', 'find', 'physical', 'contact', 'can', 'be', 'rewarding', 'gratifying', 'instead', 'always', 'brutal.Eventually', 'course', 'know', 'must', 'meet', 'ring.All', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'are', 'gritty', 'tough', 'very', 'real', 'punches', 'were', 'pulled', 'filming', 'scenes.The', 'character', 'Diana', 'little', 'brother', 'Tiny', 'Ray', 'Santiago', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'little', 'more', 'may', 'be', 'whole', 'further', 'film', 'there.The', 'cinematography', 'Patrick', 'Cady', 'frenetic', 'ring', 'soft', 'sweet', 'intimate', 'tender', 'quiet', 'moments.The', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'nice', 'adding', 'just', 'right', 'touches', 'emotion', 'precisely', 'right', 'times.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'make', 'connection', 'Ira', 'Tom', 'Barbour', 'owner/manager', 'seedy', 'boxing', 'gym', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'also', 'billionaire', 'father', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Arthur', 'films', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'cast', 'compelling', 'story', 'work', 'put', 'together', 'brilliant', 'director.It', 'knock', 'out']",Girlfight VHS

There is just something uplifting about seeing a young woman, who is in a rough neighborhood with rough relatives and rough peers, handle it all by learning literally how to be the best fighter she can possibly be. She trains to be a professional boxer.  She even gets to box her boyfriend in the ring, who also wants to go pro. We were both laughing during this part because actually it probably would be a tremendous help to marriage and relationships to pick someone you could literally go into the ring against and beat the hell out of them (professionally speaking, of course).  This sure would be one marriage or relationship where abuse of one party would have a hard time arising!

I had also thought I had seen some stuff saying it was a female version of Rocky.  Well it is not exciting like Rocky was but it was well acted.Girlfight was not a very exciting movie.  The fights were not that good and there were not many of them.  However all the people in the film did a really great job.  The film had some great acting.However the film was a bit too slow for me.Also, I feel the film which is set in Brooklyn lacked a NY feel.  I recently saw Finding Forrester, which really captured the Bronx.  Woody Allen always captures NY.  This film, though set in Brooklyn, to me did not feel NY.I do not recommend buying the DVD.  The film will be watched once and I really do not think watched again.  Also the extra making of footage was really just a 5 minute commercial.  There are no real cool extras on the disk.

Michelle - Diana - Rodriguez is boxing the screen in this role which seems have been written specially for her.While most of the male boxers of Hector's boxing school consider this sport as a way to make money in order to leave their poor neighborhood, Diana is boxing because she has too much aggressivity in her. The school authorities want her to see a psychiatrist but what's the use with a girl who doesn't want to be helped. So boxing will replace the doc at a lower cost and allow Diana to face her father for a cathartic final confrontation.Karyn Kusama is without any doubt very talented and knows how to make you feel the rage of the boxers during a fight.

529910,A13V772I1XPU9S,B00003CXNX,"""d_chaney""","[1, 3]","With a one, two punch, this movie knocks your senses for a loop.Brooklyn native Diana has lead a life of trouble. She seeks it like a bee does honey. Any fight that comes her way she will take it, any challange that faces her she tackles it--the hard way. Growing up in a bad neighborhood with her emotionally abusive father Sandro and younger brother &quot;Tiny&quot; has not been easy. Especially since Diana's mother committed suicide years before and left Diana and &quot;Tiny&quot; without a gentle mother figure to protect, love, and look up to.Marisol, a girl from school, is Diana's only friend. While Diana sees Marisol more like someone who needs her protection against people who will take her for granted, Marisol sees Diana as violent, tempramental, but a loyal friend. They get along because they understand the boarders of each others character and for the most part accept it about each other.Diana soon finds a way to channel all of her inner aggressions when she sets out to pay Hector, a local boxing trainer, to train her to be a boxer. Overcoming hardships and gender differences she excels and learns where she can be accepted for the agresstion and power that she has inside her. And finally she finds a place to fit in. In the boxing ring.Adrian has always wanted to be a boxer and has trained for years to become a pro athelete in the sport to make some money as well as a little fame from the Brooklyn side of town. But when he finds himself becoming interested in the aggressive yet pretty Diana he finds himself questioning things about himself he has never had to face before. And soon, as they are pitted up against each other he must determine what is more important, love or winning.This movie has some slow parts here and there and in essense you want to see MORE fighting going on than really happens which can make it a little frustrating. I mean, you really want to see this chick set someone to the mat, esp with all the gender hardships that happen in the gym but beside all that you see enough for some great eye candy. This movie hits home for me. It is one of those feel good movies that speaks to the heart and yet has enough hostility in it to show the darker side of personalities and hurt and be glad that I've never been in THAT much trouble before.",5,One of a kind,1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,2295,"['one', 'two', 'punch', 'movie', 'senses', 'loop.Brooklyn', 'native', 'Diana', 'lead', 'life', 'trouble', 'bee', 'honey', 'fight', 'way', 'will', 'take', 'challange', 'hard', 'way', 'Growing', 'up', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'father', 'Sandro', 'younger', 'brother', 'quot', 'Tiny', 'quot', 'not', 'been', 'easy', 'Especially', 'Diana', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'years', 'left', 'Diana', 'quot', 'Tiny', 'quot', 'gentle', 'mother', 'figure', 'protect', 'love', 'look', 'up', 'to.Marisol', 'girl', 'school', 'Diana', 'only', 'friend', 'Diana', 'Marisol', 'more', 'someone', 'who', 'protection', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'granted', 'Marisol', 'Diana', 'violent', 'tempramental', 'loyal', 'friend', 'get', 'along', 'understand', 'boarders', 'others', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'other.Diana', 'soon', 'way', 'channel', 'inner', 'aggressions', 'when', 'out', 'pay', 'Hector', 'local', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'train', 'be', 'boxer', 'Overcoming', 'hardships', 'gender', 'differences', 'excels', 'learns', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'accepted', 'agresstion', 'power', 'inside', 'finally', 'place', 'fit', 'boxing', 'ring.Adrian', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'boxer', 'trained', 'years', 'become', 'pro', 'athelete', 'sport', 'make', 'money', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'fame', 'Brooklyn', 'side', 'town', 'when', 'becoming', 'interested', 'aggressive', 'yet', 'pretty', 'Diana', 'questioning', 'things', 'never', 'had', 'face', 'soon', 'are', 'pitted', 'up', 'other', 'must', 'determine', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'love', 'winning.This', 'movie', 'slow', 'parts', 'here', 'there', 'essense', 'want', 'see', 'MORE', 'fighting', 'going', 'really', 'can', 'make', 'little', 'frustrating', 'mean', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'chick', 'set', 'someone', 'mat', 'esp', 'gender', 'happen', 'gym', 'see', 'enough', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'home', 'one', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'heart', 'yet', 'enough', 'hostility', 'show', 'darker', 'side', 'personalities', 'hurt', 'be', 'glad', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'THAT', 'much', 'trouble']",Girlfight VHS

Three words that have the effect of a boxing combination even Rocky would be proud of delivering. Prove them wrong, three words that the films protagonist has to live by because everyone and everything seems to be working against her.Girlfight is the story of a quick-tempered young woman who finds discipline, self-respect and love in the boxing ring. One day, after just having a fight in school, and being warned that she better get her act together or else, she goes to the gym to pick up her brother. After a sparring partner sucker punches her brother, she attacks the boxer. Once Diana decides she wants to become a boxer her priorities are forced into focus as she begins a grueling training regimen in the same gym her brother trains in. Along the way she falls in love with a talented amateur in the same gym.We are inundated with Hollywood pictures. The money shot, the big budget, the big names. Sometimes with all of that you get a big zero. Then there are the independents. The films that are made with little money, with talented, but not yet famous people, sometimes you get zero here as well. Not this time. Girlfight is one of those small indie pictures that packs a wallop.Newcomer Michelle Rodriguez is brilliantly enigmatic as the troubled Diana. We can see the adolescent angst in her, and believe her motivations when she wants something more, when she wants to learn to box. Rodriguez not only is able to play the hard edged side to Diana, but the softer, more vulnerable side as well. I hope to see a lot more of her in the near future.The film won many awards at Sundance, and happened to do well considering that most of the two months it was out, it was only in limited release at less than 100 theatres.

529912,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00003CXNX,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[1, 3]","OK, so ""Rocky I"" wasn't so bad (in my book).  The big lug had his challenges in and out of the ring to overcome.  But that movie shot for the big time, the big crowds, and the big excitement.  Not bad, but after hearing that pep rally theme song a million times over the last 300 years, it's become more of a cartoon character than what it probably was originally intended to be.  Thirty five sequels with exactly the same plot doesn't help this point of view.No such problems with ""GirlFight"".  This is a much smaller film about boxing where, as much as ""Rocky"" came from a less than desirable background, he doesn't have as many problems as Diana, the lead character has.  While Rocky won the lottery to fight Apollo Creed, which makes him the Willie Wonka of boxing, Diana is never going to get such a break.One of the magical things about the film is that Diana recognizes she has the small problem of getting into fights in high school.  After her fourth scuffle in a semester, and the threat of expulsion, she's smart enough to realize that she needs an outlet, which she finds at the local gym that her brother is involved in.  The brother is forced to take boxing lessons from her father, who wouldn't dream of letting a girl into the sport.  That Diana steals and connives her way into the gym doesn't make her an outstanding person, but it is a gritty portrayal of a person's determination to try and accomplish something.I live in Las Vegas, and have seen that there are growing opportunities in the world of female boxing.  But that path was not so clear three or four years ago, when the movie was written.  So I'll go with the plot situations that need her to fight males, or not fight at all.  But while most movies would have some plot gimmick to occur in the ring, this movie just has her slugging it out.

Played brilliantly by the newcomer Michelle Rodriguez, the role calls for a brooding hostile intensity as well as a deep sensitivity.  Diana has to be strong, both physically mentally in order to battle the stereotypes in her macho Latino culture.  And Michelle Rodriguez doesn't just have power in her biceps; she has power in her eyes. One of her narrow-eyed scowls says more than pages of dialog.  During the film she learns to focus her rage into her boxing, and the joy of her growing control is apparent by the delight on her face.  She also falls in love with a young male boxer, Adrian, played by Santiago Douglas, and their relationship has its ups and downs.  Eventually, they have to fight each other in the ring.The whole cast is excellent -- Jaime Tirelli as her trainer, Ray Santiago as her little brother, Elisa Bocanegra as her girlfriend, and Paul Calderon as her brutal father.  And, in a small cameo performance, the famous director, John Sayles, is cast as a boring science teacher.  Later, I discovered that the brilliant 32-year old writer and director of this film, Karyn Kusama, went through some training of her own.

529920,A2WKKTVYS5H61M,B00003CXNX,Mecca Egypt,"[3, 5]","Directed by first-time director/writer Karyn Kusama, Girlfight is a gripping urban drama that follows the trials of Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) a tomboyish protagonist with a tortured past and an emotionless father. Equipped with her bruting fists and emblazoned emotion, Diana decides to take her distaste of all things wrong with those in her immediate sphere of influence and put it to productive use, through the vein of boxing. In this film we follow her through the hollowed detention halls of her inner-city high school, the romance that blossoms between her and the boyfriend her father refuses to accept, and her journey through the patriarchal arena of professional boxing. Shot in a documentary-style (devoid of big-budget Hollywood sheen) to give the film a rawer, more realistic edge, Girlfight takes many risks and pulls them off brillantly. The film is so captivating that you find yourself rewinding certain moments over and over to keep those feelings within your heart. You become attached to the characters of the film and you begin to care about their tribulations. Almost all of the elements of Girlfight work, from the style in which Kusama shoots the fast-paced boxing scenes to the subliminal marker-written messages situated throughout the film. The only drawbacks of the film is the angle Kusama chooses to take in beginning her story, she doesn't give to much detail into Diana's past life, only a few brief allusions mentioned during the scenes at the dinner table. With that aside, Girlfight maintains its grit, furvor, and raw intimacy with intensely effective results.

Someone definitely needs to train these girls more if they want to see more like legitimate boxers on the silver screen. But as a dramatic movie, Girlfight wins in the entertainment factor. Well, as some said, it does get weak towards the end of the movie. I was kinda left bewildered as to what direction they were trying to go at the end so I was left a bit unsatisfied. But I think the first 3/4 of the movie is strong enough to entertain someone that they'd still like to see movie despite the ending.",4,Best of the three women's boxing movies I've seen..,1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,901,"['quot', 'Opponent', 'quot', 'quot', 'Knockout', 'quot', 'Girlfight', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'thre', 'movies', 'other', 'two', 'had', 'more', 'fight', 'babe', 'effect', 'actual', 'movie', 'femal', 'boxer', 'acting', 'script', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'boxing', 'however', 'not', 'quite', 'three', 'movies', 'Moves', 'were', 'kinda', 'sloppy', 'dropped', 'hands', 'rabbit', 'punches', 'Someone', 'definitely', 'train', 'girls', 'more', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'like', 'legitimate', 'boxers', 'silver', 'screen', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'Girlfight', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'Well', 'said', 'get', 'weak', 'towards', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'kinda', 'left', 'bewildered', 'what', 'direction', 'were', 'trying', 'go', 'end', 'so', 'was', 'left', 'bit', 'unsatisfied', 'think', 'first', '3/4', 'movie', 'strong', 'enough', 'entertain', 'someone', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'ending']",Girlfight VHS
529927,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXNX,Reviewer,"[1, 5]","The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with.  Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in ""Girlfight,"" written and directed by Karyn Kusama.  Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn, facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester.  She affects a ""whatever"" attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go.  She lives with her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom she has a very tentative relationship, and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago).  With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution, she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her.  And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains.  Ironically, Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets, and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons.  When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to take her on, and approaches her father for the money, under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for), Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money.  Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home.  It's an environment to which she readily adapts, and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better.  And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in ""gender blind"" competitions, does not faze her in the least.  Diana has found her element.First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere.  And there's no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, ""I was a fighter once.  I lost.""  Then, looking around the busy gym, ""Like most of these guys, they're going to lose, too.  But it's all they know--""  And it's that honesty of attitude, as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed, that makes this movie as good as it is.  It's a bleak world, underscored by the dimly lit, run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall, blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have, all that they know.Making her screen debut, Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana, infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves.  She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin?  Whatever it is, it works.  It's a powerful, memorable performance, by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation.  She certainly makes Diana a positive role model, one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life, at least to those who would seek them out.As positive as this film is, however, it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground, there's no indication of where she's headed.  Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector?  After all, realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to, nor opens it's arms to women.  And in keeping with the subject matter of the film, and the approach of the filmmaker, an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate.The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira).  Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify, there are certain aspects of ""Girlfight,"" that stretch credibility a bit, regarding some of what happens in the ring.  That aside, it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience.",3,Doesn't Pull Any Punches,988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,4728,"['first', 'step', 'getting', 'road', 'nowhere', 'recognizing', ""'re"", 'first', 'place', 'then', 'matter', 'being', 'assertive', 'taking', 'positive', 'steps', 'overcome', 'negative', 'influences', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'put', 'road', 'begin', 'Which', 'exactly', 'what', 'young', 'Latino', 'girl', 'Girlfight', 'written', 'directed', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'Diana', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'eighteen-year-old', 'High', 'School', 'senior', 'projects', 'Brooklyn', 'facing', 'expulsion', 'fourth', 'fight', 'halls', 'beginning', 'semester', 'attitude', 'deep-seated', 'anger', 'take', 'places', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'go', 'father', 'Sandro', 'Paul', 'Calderon', 'whom', 'very', 'tentative', 'relationship', 'younger', 'brother', 'Tiny', 'Ray', 'Santiago', 'life', 'teetering', 'brink', 'dissolution', 'desperately', 'outlet', 'channel', 'demons', 'plague', 'one', 'day', 'even', 'looking', 'when', 'gym', 'where', 'Tiny', 'Ironically', 'Tiny', 'nothing', 'do', 'boxing', 'go', 'art', 'school', 'Sandro', 'determined', 'son', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'streets', 'ten', 'dollars', 'week', 'lessons', 'When', 'Diana', 'Tiny', 'trainer', 'Hector', 'Jaime', 'Tirelli', 'take', 'father', 'money', 'guise', 'calling', 'weekly', 'allowance', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'money', 'Sandro', 'down', 'go', 'out', 'earn', 'own', 'money', 'Ultimately', 'Tiny', 'help', 'way', 'ring', 'soon', 'second', 'home', 'environment', 'readily', 'adapts', 'life', 'take', 'turn', 'better', 'fact', 'will', 'have', 'fight', 'men', 'not', 'women', 'gender', 'blind', 'competitions', 'not', 'faze', 'least', 'Diana', 'found', 'element.First', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'done', 'terrific', 'job', 'creating', 'realistic', 'setting', 'story', 'presenting', 'honest', 'portrait', 'life', 'projects', 'conveying', 'desperation', 'so', 'familiar', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'dead-end', 'situations', 'road', 'nowhere', 'candy', 'coating', 'either', 'Hector', 'Diana', 'when', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'where', 'was', 'fighter', 'once', 'lost', 'Then', 'looking', 'busy', 'gym', 'most', 'guys', ""'re"", 'going', 'lose', 'too', 'know', 'honesty', 'attitude', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'bleak', 'world', 'underscored', 'dimly', 'lit', 'run-down', 'gym', 'can', 'fairly', 'smell', 'sweat', 'boxers', 'sense', 'desolation', 'pall', 'blanketing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'grasping', 'hanging', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'know.Making', 'screen', 'debut', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Diana', 'infusing', 'depth', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'fairly', 'waves', 'so', 'real', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'Rodriguez', 'exactly', 'where', 'actor', 'leave', 'off', 'character', 'begin', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'performance', 'actor', 'whom', 'will', 'await', 'endeavor', 'great', 'anticipation', 'certainly', 'Diana', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'one', 'whom', 'many', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'inspiration', 'realization', 'are', 'alternative', 'paths', 'available', 'life', 'least', 'who', 'would', 'seek', 'out.As', 'positive', 'film', 'however', 'something', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'Diana', 'obviously', 'feet', 'ground', 'indication', 'where', 'headed', 'short', 'term', 'fix', 'destined', 'become', 'female', 'counterpart', 'Hector', 'realistically', 'light', 'fact', 'realism', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'professional', 'boxing', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'profession', 'arms', 'women', 'keeping', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'approach', 'filmmaker', 'affirmation', 'results', 'Diana', 'assertiveness', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Santiago', 'Douglas', 'Adrian', 'Elisa', 'Bocanegra', 'Marisol', 'Alicia', 'Ashley', 'Ricki', 'Thomas', 'Barbour', 'Ira', 'very', 'real', 'picture', 'life', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Girlfight', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'bit', 'regarding', 'what', 'ring', 'aside', 'positive', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'satisfying', 'experience']",Girlfight VHS
529928,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CXNX,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Girlfight (Karyn Kusama, 2000)It's rare that TV station-produced films (this one comes courtesy of IFC) live up to their pre-release hype. Girlfight not only did so, IFC's commercials may have understated the case for this overlooked gem of a film.Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez [Resident Evil], in her big-screen debut) is a high school student with a very bad attitude and four trips to the principal's office in one semester for fighting. When she's asked to run some money from her father down to the Brooklyn gym where her brother trains, she finds herself intrigued by the idea that people can not only fight without getting called to the principal's office, but might actually get paid for it. From there, it's a pretty small step to begging, borrowing, and stealing in order to come up with the cash for her to start training as well. Hector (Law and Order regular Jaime Tirelli), one of the gym's trainers, is willing to take her on, and away we go.Part of the brilliance of Girlfight is that it's a sweet movie masquerading as a tough movie. While the film never loses focus on Diana's up-and-coming boxing career, Kusama balances the boxing with Diana's coming-of-age story; it's never explicitly said, but we get the feeling the developing relationship between her and another boxer is, in fact, her first real love affair. Another part of the brilliance is that it's a boxing movie that, well, doesn't have all that much boxing in it. Fight Club this ain't; there's actually very little in-the-ring action, and what there is is quite tastefully done (including some excellent from-the-fighter's-perspective camerawork). At various times during the film, boxer affirmations tacked to the walls of the gym are focused on for a few seconds, and it's obvious that Kusama takes the first one very seriously-that boxing is a game of brains over brawn.Many mystery novelists could take some from Kusama about how to unobtrusively introduce storylines.  There is nothing of artifice in the way the film is set up; everything falls together in just the right way, to the point where much of the film has an almost documentary feel to it. Comparisons are inevitable, warranted, and favorable to Matty Rich's excellent film Straight Outta Brooklyn, but Kusama is a little more slick in her ability to keep everything smooth and well-paced throughout.Girlfight is yet another film from the supposedly mediocre crop of movies released in the year 2000 that puts paid in no uncertain terms to that judgment. In retrospect, 2000 may have been one of the strongest years for film, especially independent film, we've seen. **** ",4,Fantastic and overlooked,1017619200,"04 1, 2002",2002,2626,"['Girlfight', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', '2000', 'rare', 'TV', 'station-produced', 'films', 'one', 'courtesy', 'IFC', 'live', 'up', 'pre-release', 'hype', 'Girlfight', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'so', 'IFC', 'commercials', 'may', 'have', 'understated', 'case', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'film.Diana', 'Guzman', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', '[', 'Resident', 'Evil', ']', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'very', 'bad', 'attitude', 'four', 'trips', 'principal', 'office', 'one', 'semester', 'fighting', 'When', 'asked', 'run', 'money', 'father', 'down', 'Brooklyn', 'gym', 'where', 'brother', 'trains', 'intrigued', 'idea', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'fight', 'getting', 'called', 'principal', 'office', 'might', 'actually', 'get', 'paid', 'there', 'pretty', 'small', 'step', 'begging', 'borrowing', 'stealing', 'order', 'come', 'up', 'cash', 'start', 'training', 'as', 'well', 'Hector', 'Law', 'Order', 'regular', 'Jaime', 'Tirelli', 'one', 'gym', 'trainers', 'willing', 'take', 'away', 'go.Part', 'brilliance', 'Girlfight', 'sweet', 'movie', 'masquerading', 'tough', 'movie', 'film', 'never', 'focus', 'Diana', 'up-and-coming', 'boxing', 'career', 'Kusama', 'boxing', 'Diana', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'never', 'explicitly', 'said', 'get', 'feeling', 'developing', 'relationship', 'boxer', 'fact', 'first', 'real', 'love', 'affair', 'part', 'brilliance', 'boxing', 'movie', 'well', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'boxing', 'Fight', 'Club', 'ai', ""n't"", 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'in-the-ring', 'action', 'what', 'quite', 'tastefully', 'done', 'including', 'excellent', ""from-the-fighter's-perspective"", 'camerawork', 'various', 'times', 'film', 'boxer', 'affirmations', 'tacked', 'walls', 'gym', 'are', 'focused', 'few', 'seconds', 'obvious', 'Kusama', 'first', 'one', 'very', 'seriously-that', 'boxing', 'game', 'brains', 'brawn.Many', 'mystery', 'novelists', 'could', 'take', 'Kusama', 'how', 'unobtrusively', 'introduce', 'storylines', 'nothing', 'artifice', 'way', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'everything', 'together', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'point', 'where', 'much', 'film', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', 'warranted', 'favorable', 'Matty', 'Rich', 'excellent', 'film', 'Straight', 'Outta', 'Brooklyn', 'Kusama', 'little', 'more', 'slick', 'ability', 'keep', 'everything', 'smooth', 'well-paced', 'throughout.Girlfight', 'yet', 'film', 'supposedly', 'mediocre', 'crop', 'movies', 'released', 'year', '2000', 'paid', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'judgment', 'retrospect', '2000', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'strongest', 'years', 'film', 'especially', 'independent', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', '****']",Girlfight VHS

529931,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,B00003CXNX,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[9, 39]","Karyn Kusama's GIRLFIGHT is nothing more than a strident misandrist pleasuring herself on film!Ordinarily, I would never consider wasting my valuable time watching this type of movie, much less bothering to write anything about it, but because I recently wrote a series of reviews for some mostly older antifeminism books, it was suggested to me that I should also ""weigh in"" on GIRLFIGHT, which I had previously never even heard of.Written and directed by then newcomer, Kusama, the title, GIRLFIGHT, is simply a rather pedestrian substitution for ""Woman's Struggle"", that is, ""Feminism.""  Her title displays the same sort of ""heavy-handed"" touch that she exhibits throughout the movie.  As a filmmaker, Kusama has all the subtlety of a Great White Shark in a feeding frenzy.  The movie consists of one ""ham-fisted"" symbol after another, decrying all of the usual exaggerated and simplistic contentions regarding men that radical feminists have been screeching about for over forty years; illustrating the feminist anthems; and portraying resolutions dreamed up in their wishful fantasies.It should come as no surprise to any educated person that GIRLFIGHT won a couple of awards at Robert ""Red"" Redford's Sundance Film Festival in 2000; the incestuous relationship between Marxism and Feminism has long been established, and GIRLFIGHT was bound to be enthusiastically embraced at Sundance, and promoted as another vehicle for further conditioning the masses (particularly young women) toward the socialistic goals of hard-core feminism.  (If you can bring yourself to turn off the TV one day, and actually read a nonfiction book, THE GENDER AGENDA by Dale O'Leary, and THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A WOMAN by Alice von Hildebrand, would be smashing places to begin.)  It was, after all, no less a communist than Vladimir Lenin himself who stated in 1920, ""We must create a powerful international women's movement.""  (Was keeping the spectators seated and talking during the singing of The Star-Spangled Banner before GIRLFIGHT's climactic bout, a Marxist ""jab"" at America?)* Although I will not be discussing anything that the majority of the previous reviewers have not already revealed, be advised that this review will examine the major plot points and the ending of GIRLFIGHT.  If you don't want to know how this movie ends, you should discontinue reading this review (and avoid most of the others posted on this product page as well).Ostensibly, the story is about a high school girl, Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez), prone to violent outbursts who supposedly redirects her aggression by taking up boxing, and ultimately confronts her emotionally abusive dad, and then later, her boyfriend in the ring.  The entire movie is simply a kaleidoscope of embarrassingly overt visual metaphors meant to convey the concept of patriarchy getting pummeled to a pulp by Womanhood, and the castration of perceived masculine power.  (Diana or Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, is portrayed in mythology as having killed various men and male gods.)Early on, we get a barely veiled glimpse of Diana's (writer/director Kusama's mouthpiece) disdain for the traditional role of women in society when she stares out of her 11th story bedroom window at a mother pushing a baby carriage with a crying toddler in tow.  That she's ""looking down on Motherhood"" couldn't have been more obvious.There are three ""types"" of one-dimensional men (or malignancies) in this movie.  (The ""father"", the ""son"", and the ""emasculated ghost""?) .....1) The domineering, emotionally and physically abusive male determined to ""keep women in their place.""  This type of man is represented by Diana's drunken dad, and in a typical exhibition of Kusama's over-the-top symbolism, he is knocked around and nearly strangled to death by Diana in the family's kitchen (after she has received some boxing training).  Get it?  A woman's place is in the kitchen, but only if that's the location she chooses for bloodying the patriarchy!  ""You belong to me now! ... All these years you just looked right through me"", Diana says to her beaten dad on behalf of women everywhere.2) The unfaithful romancer who refuses to accept women on equal terms in every single facet of social endeavor.  He is represented by Diana's love interest, Adrian, who dreams of ""winning"" his way out of the projects with a successful boxing career.  Giving him the name of Rocky Balboa's wife, was an obvious slap at the character, and at men in general who express their manhood through a fascination with sports and sports movies.  That slap becomes a punch, however, when 18-year-old Diana, with perhaps two months worth of training, defeats 19-year-old Adrian in the ring - despite the fact that he's been training for nearly a year, and supposedly has true professional boxing potential.  (In a sorry display of how far Kusama was willing to go to get the most ""punch for the buck"", she wants us to believe that these two characters would be fighting in the same weight class.  Never mind that Adrian is obviously 6"" taller than Diana and appears to outweigh her by about 40 pounds.  It simply wouldn't do to have the feminist hero defeat a man merely her own size!)3) Diana's brother, Tiny, is the way men ought to be in Kusama's warped world.  He is artistic, sensitive, effeminate, satisfactorily demasculinized already.  He is tolerable because he is pathetic, as he can do nothing but stand back, wring his hands, and plead for his dad's life, while the ""new"" man (Diana GuzMAN - get it?) strangles the ""old"" man in the kitchen and usurps his authority (i.e., transforms the patriarchal family unit into a matriarchy).  But in an ironic twist, Kusama also reveals her revulsion at the feminine man as well, by naming him TINY.  Diana's brother is neither excessively large or small for his age, so we must assume that the name hints at something else:  His unmanly ""endowments"" literally or figuratively; his diminished social status in the imagined new matriarchy; or simply Kusama's personal view of such effete men?GIRLFIGHT begins with one of the silliest opening shots ever conceived. (Diana Guzman looks up and glares directly at the camera; i.e., ""you.""  Why?  Uh, well, because Kusama told her to.)  And it ends with one of the most improbable scenes ever filmed.  (After losing to her in the ring - bringing his dream of a boxing career to an end - Adrian practically begs Diana not to break up with him.  This shows just how out-of-touch with reality and male psychology these extreme feminists really are.  If such a scenario as presented in this movie was even truly possible, does Kusama, et al., actually believe that a ""man"" in this situation would REALLY want to retain his romantic relationship with his female conqueror?  That he would be willing to ""take a licking and keep on kissing""?)  GIRLFIGHT is indeed a feminist fantasy from opening shot to final scene!It does, however, contain a few positive ingredients:  Technically, the screenplay is competently constructed and well-paced, and some of the cinematography is imaginative.  The score nicely compliments the images and adds an exotic tone.  Herb Lovelle as Cal is good in a very small part, and Jaime Tirelli in the role of Diana's trainer, Hector, delivers a fine, multilayered performance.  However, having read the script, no self-respecting ""man"" would have consented to appear in this propaganda piece.  (But divesting men of their self-respect has been a goal for feminists for over forty years now, and they've been largely successful.)  Otherwise, the acting was uneven across-the-board.  This was Rodriguez's first role, and it sometimes showed.I could excoriate the artificial dialogue, the nonstop profanity, and the sloppy editing in GIRLFIGHT, but that would be like criticizing a dead dog for being lazy.  Instead, let me give you one small dose of reality: Men generally possess nearly 50% more muscle mass than women, and testosterone (a steroid hormone which studies have linked to enhanced aggressiveness and increased muscle formation) is approximately thirty times more prevalent in the adult male body than it is in the adult female.  (That's 30 times, not 30%!)  In other words, there are genuine physiological reasons why women trained in boxing are never going to be serious competition for men trained in boxing - Karyn Kusama's fantasy notwithstanding.  (Don't blame me; blame God.  But your arms are too short to box with Him.)  Lucia Rijker is universally regarded as the best fighter in the history of female boxing; she has had 54 fights with women and won them all - most by knockout.  In earnest competition, she stepped into a ring only once with a man:  In 1995, she fought Muay Thai boxer Somchai Jaidee, who was far from being a world elite fighter in the men's competition.  Rijker managed to survive the first round, but in the second, she was laid out on the canvas, unconscious for several minutes.  (If she didn't have a clue when she climbed into that ring, I'm sure she had one when she woke up in it!)What disturbs me is not that a misandrist would put her neurosis on film (wrong, Cyndi, these days, ""Girls Just Want To Be Boys""), but that anyone would tout this fiction as some kind of inspiring movie to be shown to youngsters ... that's what bothers me!  As if Diana Guzman represents some viable means to conflict resolution in the real world.  My heart goes out to any child of a rigor mortis-brained parent who believes that ""fighting"" - even in a square ""ring"" - is the best way to channel aggressive behavior.  When my Brother (nicknamed ""Napoleon"") was only about 12 years old, a professional trainer recognized that he possessed a chip on his shoulder the size of Mount Rushmore, and an almost freakish, innate aptitude for fighting.  This man offered to prepare my Brother for a professional boxing career.  Being an Irish-American fighting in sub-Middleweight divisions, and being as proficient in physical destruction as he is, Napoleon would have made many millions of dollars as a successful boxer.  But even at that young an age, he was intelligent enough to recognize the senselessness of making a living knocking other guys senseless, and so he turned down the trainer's offer.  Instead, he was able to sublimate his anger without needing to unleash it on others in any harmful form.  With his fiery energy redirected into more constructive activities, he eventually grew into a very good and caring man (who could still decapitate any one of us with either fist, though he would never do so).That anyone would show GIRLFIGHT to a young person as motivation for anything, and would hold up this fictional character as a role model for young women to emulate in any way, is deplorable and irresponsible!  GIRLFIGHT is not just a feminist cartoon masquerading as a gritty, urban tale - it's a bad cartoon with bad language and a bad agenda.  And what its man-hating writer/director really needs is a psychiatrist, not an audience.",1,"""F"" Stands For: FANTASTICALLY FAR-FETCHED FEMINIST FANTASY FLICK",1168732800,"01 14,

But Girlfight wins for realism, beauty in simplicity.Round 2: Soundtrack, goes to Girlfight. Rocky I doesn't even put up a fight here. (Remember that &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; wasn't until Rocky III.) But again the points go to Girlfight for a simple, excellent, unpretentious soundtrack.Round 3: Storyline, goes to Girlfight. Far more inspiring, and a little more interesting.Decision: Girlfight. Now I mean no disrespect to Rocky I, because it's a good movie. I only make the comparison to show how good Girlfight is. Enjoy it very much.p.s. Although it's rated &quot;R&quot; for language, it's perfectly viewable by any 12 year old girl.
