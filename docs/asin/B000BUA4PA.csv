950164,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000BUA4PA,D. Hartley,"[4, 27]","FINALLY! The most eagerly anticipated DVD release of 2005 is nigh. The classic story of how Kelly Clarkson became the new drummer for the White Stripes is a lesson for us all in blood, sweat and tears. What critics have hailed as ""Must see TV! The taste of the American public has finally risen to the level of the quality of what is produced for network television-hooray!"" Some of my personal fave moments on this stunning DVD: Kelly's duet with judge Mickey Donlenz, who (as we all remember on episode 6) unexpectedly jumps onstage with her to join in on a rollicking version of ""Cold Turkey"", backed by the 'Stripes themselves; and of course the unforgettable naked food fight back at the mansion between Kelly and fellow aspirants Tom Green, Anderson Cooper and Julia Butterfly-wacky! You know, this inspiring video makes me drop to my knees every day and thank the maker that becoming a famous musician no longer requires raw talent, creative inspiration and musical chops-I mean, its so much EASIER just to be seen on TV and get voted in by 15 year old teenage girls with eating disorders! For instance, think about how much more awesome the Beatles could have been if only Paula Abdul had been there and possessed the power to choose who the final members would be!

Yeah, I'm pissed at CBS and Mark Burnett for totally short-shrifting the fans of this show.  People didn't watch Rock Star just for the music, we watched it for a behind-the-scenes look at how songs, music and *musicians* get made.  This DVD offers NONE of that, and that's a travesty -- SHAME on you CBS!!!!!However...as a DVD, taken for what it is, the offerings aren't bad for the money -- twenty-some GREAT songs, out-takes, and footage from the un-aired mini-concert with the brand new INXS, all for ten bucks?  When CDs these days have 10 songs, eight of which suck, and cost $15? No, this is a pretty good deal.Here's what's supposedly on the DVD:  Bonus features include casting interviews, a backstage tour of the show and a VIP party at the ""Rock Star"" mansion. Clips include Jordis talking about dedicating ""The Man Who Sold the World"", the rockers arriving at the mansion for the first time, etc. Also included is a ""Too Hot For TV"" segment, which includes, among other things, Fortune's birthday celebration.

950167,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B000BUA4PA,L.A. Scene,"[3, 3]","When I first heard that the band Inxs was going to go the route of ""reality show"" to decide a new lead singer, I admit I was pretty disappointed.  However, since Inxs is one of my favorite bands, I could not help put tune into the series ""Rockstar: Inxs"".  As the days and weeks went on, I slowly but surely got into the show.  Much of the reason for my increasing interest was as contestants were being eliminated, the quality of the contestants - and their performances was improving.  By the time the final three were reached - Mig Ayesa, Marty Casey, and JD Fortune - I was convinced Inxs had picked the best three contestants.  While I did think Casey was the better overall musician - and best contestant in the competition, I did feel Inxs picked the singer with the best fit to be their lead singer - JD Fortune.  When I heard, ""Rockstar: Inxs - The DVD"" was being released, I was hoping that it would capture the essence of the show.  While this DVD does have good performances (including the first concert with JD and Inxs immediately following the finale) and some good behind the scenes information, I do feel it fell short to capturing that essence of the show.The series ""Rockstar: Inxs"" followed a three day cycle.  On the first day, we got behind the scenes information on what was going on in ""the mansion"" (where the contestants lived during the competition).  The second day was when the contestants would perform songs (sometimes covers, sometimes original tunes).  The third day was the ""elimination"" day in which the bottom three contestants (in voting from the second day) would have to perform an Inxs song.  Inxs would then decide which person would then be eliminated from the competition.  The DVD focuses mostly on performances from the second day and some behind the scenes stuff (some from the first day, some unseen).  While the DVD does a good job at capturing the ""best performances"", it lacks in many other areas.  Here are ten points on this:1.There are no performances of the contestants performing the Inxs songs.  You miss the opportunity to hear Marty Casey do ""Don't Change"" and JD Fortune do ""This Time"".  These were epic performances.  I would have also liked to have seen the finale in its entirety.  The only original song shown is Fortune's ""Pretty Vegas"" - and that is shown during the ""first concert"".2.There is little interaction with Inxs shown on this DVD.  Some of the best moments of the show were when Inxs provided critique and praise to the contestants - as well ""coaching"" the clinics. In addition,  Dave Navarro (""the host"") is virtually absent from this DVD - except for some clips, but even those lack spoken words by Navarro.  On the positive end, we do get the ""jamming"" by Inxs and Navarro while the contestants perform.3.While the DVD does provide an intro clip to each song, the problem is that the DVD doesn't do a good job at telling the story of the competition.  As a result, the intro clips are meaningless unless you saw the show in its entirety.4.The performances are good.  They focus on the six finalists - Fortune, Casey, and Ayesa - as well as Jordis Unga, Suzie McNeil, and Ty Taylor.  Many great songs are missing like Fortune's ""Suspicious Minds"" and Casey's ""Lithium"".  The other 9 finalists were very weak and its good they weren't included on the DVD.  One thing worth noting is that for the show's purpose many of the songs had the lyrics edited.  This was so they could fit on TV - you can't blame the DVD for that.5.The performances are often as good as the ""House Band"".  In some cases I felt the ""House Band"" was phenomenal and in other cases I thought they just didn't show up.  In most cases, the ""House Band"" was better than not.6.I like how some of the performances are re-arranged by the contestants and how others were not.  Casey was brilliant re-arranging Britney Spears' ""Baby One More Time"" into a dark number.  At the same time Ayesa was brilliant keeping to the spirit of Seal's ""Kiss From a Rose"".7.During the ""first concert"" that followed the show, Fortune gives an emotional performance of ""Never Tear Us Apart"".  As a tribute to his competitors, they participate in some of the vocals of that song.  That was one of the highlights.8.You can see and hear that during the ""first concert"" that ""Pretty Vegas"" was still a work in progress.  I think it is admirable that they did ""Pretty Vegas"", but there was still some re-arranging and tweaking of the song that would follow.  It was much more polished when released on the ""Switch"" album - and even better when I saw it live in concert during the tour.  I did like how we saw that it was a work in progress.9.On the downside, you can see that during the ""first concert"", Fortune needed to mesh with the band more - and I guess that was to be expected.  ""Don't Change"" the band's traditional finale just didn't live up to standards I would expect.  The good news is when Inxs went on tour, this song would be as flawless as ever.  Again, there is an element of realism by showing this on the DVD.10.The behind the scenes clips and extras are excellent.  I wish they would had shown the whole radio segment that was filmed.Overall good performances and good behind the scenes information.  However what this DVD really lacks is the story of the competition.  I'm hopeful that someday all of the episodes of the show will be released in a boxed set.  For now, this will do.  Inxs fans and fans of the show may want this for their collection, but I'd stop short of calling this a ""must have"".",3,"Good Performances, Good Behind the Scenes Info, but Still Fails to Capture
