I think that was due to Kevin James filming Chuck and Larry at the time. He should have stuck with the show though instead of making a movie with Adam Sandler who makes crap in my opinion. Besides this show is funnier than any movie Sandler has ever made.All the episodes in this season are worthy last episodes of the series. I mean, no matter how many  times I watch the episode where Doug buys an Ice Cream truck it still makes me laugh. The one where Doug goes Vegetarian is hilarious as well. The last few episodes pack both drama and laughs since Doug isn't sure if he wants to be married to Carrie any more. However, watching Doug get drunk due to that is probably the funniest work Kevin James has ever done. Besides the shortage of episodes, the only other disapointing thing is that the show is over. The end is a worthy ending but it made me want to see more anyway.",5,A Very Funny But......Short Last Season,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,970,"['only', 'thing', 'disapointing', 'last', 'season', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'think', 'was', 'due', 'Kevin', 'James', 'filming', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'show', 'instead', 'making', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'crap', 'opinion', 'show', 'funnier', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'ever', 'made.All', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'worthy', 'last', 'episodes', 'series', 'mean', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'episode', 'where', 'Doug', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'truck', 'still', 'one', 'where', 'Doug', 'Vegetarian', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'pack', 'drama', 'Doug', ""n't"", 'sure', 'be', 'married', 'Carrie', 'more', 'However', 'watching', 'Doug', 'get', 'drunk', 'due', 'probably', 'funniest', 'work', 'Kevin', 'James', 'ever', 'done', 'shortage', 'episodes', 'only', 'other', 'disapointing', 'thing', 'show', 'end', 'worthy', 'ending', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'anyway']",The King of Queens: Season 9
