872082,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B0006Q93F6,Dai-keag-ity,"[89, 94]","Island At War sits among the top of the many films that have recently appeared on the subject of the Second World War. Its setting, a fictional channel island called St. Gregory, lies much closer to France than to the British mainland, yet it and the other channel islands are totally British in sympathy, language, and political affiliation. In 1940, St. Gregory is portrayed as being captured by a German expeditionary force, as are the other channel islands, and the proudly British citizens there face an occupation by foreign hostiles. While their countrymen wage brave resistance to the German onslaught, those living on the islands must, willingly or not, submit to their foes. Presenting an interesting example of how a German occupation of the United Kingdom might have been carried out had Operation Sea Lion successfully achieved an undertaking that has otherwise proven impossible since 1066, that of defeating the British at war on their home soil, Island At War makes for the sort of motion picture that quickly and deeply draws in an intelligent viewer.What makes this 6  hour film so engrossing is not only the realism of its hypothetical answer to the question of how a German occupation of Britain would very probably have gone (stifling but much more respectful than German occupations elsewhere) but it is the depth of the characters presented. Where in other hands this could easily have disintegrated into caricatures of evil, jackbooted Nazis inhumanly repressing a purely good English population, instead we are challenged to see the humanity of both sides. Though often harshly restrictive and almost always haughtily loyal to the cause for which they fight, members of the German occupying force at times act with genuine decency toward the people of St. Gregory. Conversely, some of the locals on the island conduct themselves in ways that are less than honorable. There is also the matter of fraternization. We look on as interaction with an enemy for profit, personal gain, and in some instances out of a true sense of affection becomes increasingly the norm. A local girl reluctantly falls in love with a soft-spoken Luftwaffe navigator. A German officer offers a talented local girl a chance to sing in a soldier's cabaret, and later defends her against an attack by drunken townsmen. A bitter storekeeper, whose husband's death in an air raid marked the island's sole casualty during the invasion, begins a highly profitable black market goods partnership with a well-connected German. The island's commandant, Baron von Rheingarten, while a proud German officer, is by no means a thuggish Nazi yes-man, and his multi-layered interaction with the Dorr family, St. Gregory's politically-connected gentry, evolves from initial rivalry to his later showing the deepest act of magnanimity of the entire film. It is all much more of an affront to the convenient black and white wartime morality that is the standard when portraying a story set in this time and place.Island At War is a truly fine production start to finish that will prove as appealing to a lover of good television as it will to any open-minded individual with an interest in the events of the Second World War.",5,Exhibit A For Why The British Make Better TV Than Americans Do,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,3206,"['Island', 'War', 'sits', 'top', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'recently', 'appeared', 'subject', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'setting', 'fictional', 'channel', 'island', 'called', 'St.', 'Gregory', 'much', 'closer', 'France', 'British', 'mainland', 'other', 'channel', 'islands', 'are', 'totally', 'British', 'sympathy', 'language', 'political', 'affiliation', '1940', 'St.', 'Gregory', 'portrayed', 'being', 'captured', 'German', 'expeditionary', 'force', 'are', 'other', 'channel', 'islands', 'proudly', 'British', 'citizens', 'face', 'occupation', 'foreign', 'hostiles', 'countrymen', 'wage', 'brave', 'resistance', 'German', 'onslaught', 'living', 'islands', 'must', 'willingly', 'not', 'submit', 'foes', 'Presenting', 'interesting', 'example', 'how', 'German', 'occupation', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'out', 'had', 'Operation', 'Sea', 'Lion', 'successfully', 'achieved', 'undertaking', 'otherwise', 'proven', 'impossible', '1066', 'defeating', 'British', 'war', 'home', 'soil', 'Island', 'War', 'sort', 'motion', 'picture', 'quickly', 'deeply', 'draws', 'intelligent', 'viewer.What', '6', 'hour', 'film', 'engrossing', 'not', 'only', 'realism', 'hypothetical', 'answer', 'question', 'how', 'German', 'occupation', 'Britain', 'would', 'very', 'probably', 'have', 'gone', 'stifling', 'much', 'more', 'respectful', 'German', 'occupations', 'elsewhere', 'depth', 'characters', 'presented', 'Where', 'other', 'hands', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'disintegrated', 'caricatures', 'evil', 'jackbooted', 'Nazis', 'inhumanly', 'repressing', 'purely', 'good', 'English', 'population', 'instead', 'are', 'challenged', 'see', 'humanity', 'sides', 'Though', 'often', 'harshly', 'restrictive', 'almost', 'always', 'haughtily', 'cause', 'fight', 'members', 'German', 'occupying', 'force', 'times', 'act', 'genuine', 'decency', 'people', 'St.', 'Gregory', 'Conversely', 'locals', 'island', 'conduct', 'ways', 'are', 'less', 'honorable', 'also', 'matter', 'fraternization', 'look', 'interaction', 'enemy', 'profit', 'personal', 'gain', 'instances', 'true', 'sense', 'affection', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'norm', 'local', 'girl', 'reluctantly', 'love', 'soft-spoken', 'Luftwaffe', 'navigator', 'German', 'officer', 'talented', 'local', 'girl', 'chance', 'sing', 'soldier', 'cabaret', 'later', 'attack', 'drunken', 'townsmen', 'bitter', 'storekeeper', 'husband', 'death', 'air', 'raid', 'marked', 'island', 'sole', 'casualty', 'invasion', 'highly', 'profitable', 'black', 'market', 'goods', 'partnership', 'well-connected', 'German', 'island', 'commandant', 'Baron', 'von', 'Rheingarten', 'proud', 'German', 'officer', 'thuggish', 'Nazi', 'yes-man', 'multi-layered', 'interaction', 'Dorr', 'family', 'St.', 'Gregory', 'politically-connected', 'gentry', 'initial', 'rivalry', 'later', 'showing', 'deepest', 'act', 'magnanimity', 'entire', 'film', 'all', 'much', 'more', 'affront', 'convenient', 'black', 'white', 'wartime', 'morality', 'standard', 'when', 'portraying', 'story', 'set', 'time', 'place.Island', 'War', 'truly', 'fine', 'production', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'prove', 'appealing', 'lover', 'good', 'television', 'will', 'open-minded', 'individual', 'interest', 'events', 'Second', 'World', 'War']",N/A
872083,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B0006Q93F6,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[7, 11]","""Island at War"" is an odd duck - maybe more of a platypus, a hybrid creature. As far as production values go, there's nothing to complain of here. The cast is first rate, from the largest role to the smallest. The performances are very real and affecting. The WW II era Channel Islands setting - shops, costumes, cars, music - appears authentic and convincing.There's a venerable tradition of the most gloriously unrealistic, star-crossed, soap opera romance during the World War Two era - the pinnacle of that cinematic tradition would have to be ""Casablanca."" And then there are the more gritty, relatively realistic films that depict World War Two for the hell it was - ""Schindler's List,"" for example.There are a couple of scenes in ""Island at War"" that are very hard to watch. In one, a drugged Englishwoman is handcuffed to a metal hospital bed. Her legs have been spread; she's exposed and defenseless to the worst assault imaginable. A Gestapo torturer stands over her, ready to do whatever he has to do to get her to cooperate.On the other hand, ""Island At War"" contains several scenes more appropriate to a ""Casablanca"" style WWII romance. Here's the kicker - the male lead in this star-crossed romantic triangle is a high ranking Nazi commander, the leader of the invading forces. No attempt is made to make this Nazi a prisoner of his own conscience who hides secret resistance to the Nazi agenda and who will somehow acquit himself. Rather, he goes out of his way to state that experience has taught him that he could command his own men to shoot each other to death for no other reason than because he has told them to do so. Thus, he makes it clear that he has committed his share of empty mass murders for the Nazi cause. This Nazi, Rheingarten, is played in a most charismatic manner by Philip Glenister. Glenister's given several scenes to develop a sympathetic character. He strips off his Nazi uniform jacket and helps a common laborer erect a stone wall, offering warm paternal mentoring as he does so; he kisses the hand of Mrs. Dorr, the woman for whom he yearns, and is attentive to her in other ways; he sheds tears over a death. Rheingarten is depicted as nothing so much as the ideal husband and father: quietly rational, thoughtful, sentimental, careful of others' feelings, masterful when in command, and handy to have around the house. If this depiction of a Nazi does not rankle you, we need to start from scratch.""I like this series. It doesn't present the stereotype of Nazis as killing machines,"" one viewer wrote. Perhaps this viewer has been brainwashed by Political Correctness, which insists that there is no such thing as truth, but, rather, only stereotypes and images. The truth is that the Nazis *were* killing machines. There were not only death camps like Auschwitz and Treblinka; there was also Nazi warfare that violated all civilized norms. I dare anyone who insists that nice guys dreamed up, and then deployed, the Einsatzgruppen, the gas vans, the murder of handicapped children, the Blitzkrieg in Poland. Watch documentary footage like ""Triumph of the Will;"" study archival photos of Nazis in action. Most were not, unlike Philip Glenister, handsome. Even those that were handsome have the look of hardened killers. Sure, Nazis could be charming; even Fania Fenellon, who survived Auschwitz, described Mengele as an always well-dressed, charming man. But superficial charm and immaculate clothing are not the same as goodness. Baron Rheingarten is depicted not just as handsome, not just as well dressed, not just as masterful, but also as fair and good, and that is something that the Nazis were not. Had they been, the between fifty and seventy million people killed during WW II might not have died. Some might argue that the Channel Islands occupation was different; Nazis were much nicer there. In fact, the Jews on the Channel Islands were rounded up by Nazis, with English collaboration, and murdered in Auschwitz. Unless I missed it, this is not mentioned in the series.""Island at War"" attempts to deal with the badness of Nazism by featuring good Nazis versus bad Nazis, sort of like good cop v. bad cop. Rheingarten is the good, and hot, Nazi. Walker is the bad one. Walker of course, also played by a handsome, charismatic actor, is also hot. Okay. History lesson learned.Another odd feature of this series. If you came to it with no knowledge of World War Two, you might conclude that Nazism was a movement much like Robert Bly's ""Men's Movement."" It made men cry and beg women for romantic attention. The women all refuse, and the men become very frustrated. A good portion of the scenes in ""Island at War"" depicts attentive, love-starved Nazi men ever so timidly and politely begging English women for some sugar; the coy English flirts only tease them in return. Lieutenant Walker all but gets on his knees to Zelda, the English girl of his dreams, who rebuffs him with all the coldness of a dominatrix: ""You repel me."" This scene is a killer - Walker is the bad Nazi, and in this scene, you really want the writers to plumb the mysteries of evil. How could such a bad man love so purely? Can the love of a good woman save a bad man? There is no exploration of these themes. Like most other Island women, Zelda puts herself in compromising positions with a Nazi man, and then blows him off.I'll say one thing for this series. After watching it years ago, I never forget Philip Glenister's performance. I studied it again when the series came out on DVD. He really is doing something special here, and one only wishes he had a better, more coherent, more integral role in which to work his mojo.",3,Sympathy for Sexy Nazis,1250467200,"08 17,

872084,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0006Q93F6,David Bower,"[4, 4]","We started watching this series not realizing that the first six episodes would be all there were; the story stops in the early stages of the war and doesn't finish. The short ride it provides is very powerful, emotional and unsettling but it is not for children and does include frontal nudity in at least one scene.From what I can gather, the series may not have been as popular as hoped and on top of that the screenwriter, Stephen Mallatratt, who also played the part of the Vicar in two episodes, died of leukemia in 2004, the year the series aired. It seems that much of the credit for the success of the series was due to Mallatratt's remarkable ability as a screenwriter.In spite of the problems of incompletion, the series is really very good and provides some interesting insights into the situation the people on the Channel Islands faced during the Second World War. For those interested in a more complete version of the Channel Island experience I highly recommend the book, ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society."" This is a fascinating book that relates a fictional account of the experiences of the Guernsey islanders, one of the channel islands, during the Second World War.Similar stories are told including the story of the dead pig.

Dorr, the primary British citizen (James Wilby-Gosford Park) and Nazi Baron Von Rheingarten (Philip Glenister-Life on Mars-another good period DVD set). Occupation begins with a harbor bombing during attempted civilian evacuations.Ep. #2 has a German killed. English spies arrive to collect intelligence while locals learn to accept the invading Germans, reluctantly. Bravery will be a test.Ep. #3 finds the 2 spies forced into hiding on a coastal farm while the local photo shop once owned by J. Isaaks (Jew who escaped prior to occupation) is changed to A.&J.; Mahy, daughters of a man given the shop but killed in the pier raid.Ep. #4 One spy turns himself in & confesses to killing a German to save the retaliatory execution of 10 islanders. The 2nd spy is yet sought. Local female ""fraternizing"" becomes an issue, Jerry-bags.Ep. #5 shows a tense settling of islanders to the situation, but workable relationships exist with some Germans. Spy #2, Phil Dorr, is acting handyman at the Dorr house, but seeks a way to return back to England. Jews yet on the island are identified.Ep. #6 concludes with a flurry of activity and suspense. A few win and a few loose, but life on the Channel Islands will never be the same.

872095,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0006Q93F6,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[10, 11]","In World War II, The Channel Islands were taken over by the Nazis and the people who'd lived on the island before then were pretty much left to their own devices. They didn't have military protection because it wasn't a priority to send forces to protect one island. The inhabitants basically had two choices: stay or go (evacuate).As the series open, you see families faced with the reality of these tough decisions. Some (most) send their children away to be ""put up"" with other families. Some adults leave as well, including Jewish shopowners who simply hand over their keys to trusted friends who remain behind on the island. In some cases, husbands and wives are separated and there are other scenes of parents standing at the dock, watching their children hauled off in what seem to be very small boats (my heart was in my throat watching those scenes).I found all of this fascinating, relating wholly to the dilemna of families who had to stay or go, deal with the indignity of being taken over by another country - or the pain of leaving it all behind, not knowing if and when you'd see your home again or what would be left when you returned.All of this builds up to the actual occupation of the island, which starts out with a bloody massacre at the docks, planes flying overhead and strafing innocent people and then...a strange calm after that (for awhile anyway). There is a forced politeness as German officers met the political officials of the island but the animosity and mistrust on both sides is clear.Things move fairly slowly after the Germans arrive, building tension bit by bit. Alliances are formed between some Germans and the families but, in other cases, divisions cause painful repercussions. The movie focuses primarily on a few families and this allows for a close-up view of what they may have encountered. One couple has a strained marriage and tensions rachet up during the occupation -but they also, at times, see each other with new eyes.Mostly, though, this film reveals how ""fuzzy"" things can truly become during war, how morality can be twisted and values changed...or how some people can rise to the occasion and become better. There isn't a false note in this one.My only quibble (and it is minor) is that some parts seemed overly long, with some dry spells between events. But overall this movie was fascinating and I learned something about a part of history which I really knew very little about. I'm grateful that I got the opportunity to do so.",4,"Based on little known piece of WWII  history, Riveting!",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,2489,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'Channel', 'Islands', 'were', 'taken', 'over', 'Nazis', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'lived', 'island', 'then', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'military', 'protection', 'was', ""n't"", 'priority', 'send', 'forces', 'protect', 'one', 'island', 'inhabitants', 'basically', 'had', 'two', 'choices', 'stay', 'go', 'evacuate', 'series', 'open', 'see', 'families', 'faced', 'reality', 'tough', 'decisions', 'most', 'send', 'children', 'away', 'be', 'put', 'up', 'other', 'families', 'adults', 'leave', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Jewish', 'shopowners', 'who', 'simply', 'hand', 'keys', 'trusted', 'friends', 'who', 'remain', 'island', 'cases', 'husbands', 'wives', 'are', 'separated', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'parents', 'standing', 'dock', 'watching', 'children', 'hauled', 'off', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'boats', 'heart', 'was', 'throat', 'watching', 'scenes', '.I', 'found', 'fascinating', 'relating', 'wholly', 'dilemna', 'families', 'who', 'had', 'stay', 'go', 'deal', 'indignity', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'country', 'pain', 'leaving', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', ""'d"", 'see', 'home', 'again', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'when', 'returned.All', 'up', 'actual', 'occupation', 'island', 'out', 'bloody', 'massacre', 'docks', 'planes', 'flying', 'overhead', 'strafing', 'innocent', 'people', 'then', 'strange', 'calm', 'awhile', 'anyway', 'forced', 'politeness', 'German', 'officers', 'met', 'political', 'officials', 'island', 'animosity', 'mistrust', 'sides', 'clear.Things', 'move', 'fairly', 'slowly', 'Germans', 'arrive', 'building', 'tension', 'bit', 'bit', 'Alliances', 'are', 'formed', 'Germans', 'families', 'other', 'cases', 'divisions', 'cause', 'painful', 'repercussions', 'movie', 'primarily', 'few', 'families', 'close-up', 'view', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'encountered', 'One', 'couple', 'strained', 'marriage', 'tensions', 'rachet', 'up', 'occupation', '-but', 'also', 'times', 'see', 'other', 'new', 'eyes.Mostly', 'though', 'film', 'how', 'fuzzy', 'things', 'can', 'truly', 'become', 'war', 'how', 'morality', 'can', 'be', 'twisted', 'values', 'changed', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'rise', 'occasion', 'become', 'better', ""n't"", 'false', 'note', 'one.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'minor', 'parts', 'seemed', 'overly', 'long', 'dry', 'spells', 'events', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'fascinating', 'learned', 'something', 'part', 'history', 'really', 'knew', 'very', 'little', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'got', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so']",N/A

872097,A2CON4GD056OGB,B0006Q93F6,Louisa the Lemming,"[6, 11]","The Channel Islands of Great Britain, located not far from the French coastline, were occupied by German forces on 30 June, 1940, and remained under German occupation for the duration of the war.  The first ITV drama based on this occupation, ENEMY AT THE DOOR, debuted in 1978 and ran for two seasons, and is available on region one DVD.  It suffers from low-end budget, dated production values, and limited available scholarship.  It benefits from strong performances, moral seriousness, genuine interest in its subject matter, and deep empathy for its characters, good and bad.  This series, ISLAND AT WAR, debuted in 2004 and ran for a single season of six episodes prior to cancellation.  While ISLAND features an original script, characters and storyline, it feels exactly like a ""Hollywood Remake"":  Bigger budget, slicker production values, more sex, more airplanes, more explosions, a cynical contempt for its audience, and absolutely no clue about what made the original work in the first place.Thus, instead of a variety of moral quandaries faced by ordinary people, ISLAND finds a mind-numbing variety of ways to explore the burning issue of whether Island females should have sex with the enemy.  Where Germans in ENEMY represented various social backgrounds and political views representative of actual Germans of the time, ISLAND Germans merely represent different varieties of Generic Sex Fiend, who could have been fit into any modern melodrama without difficulty.  They arrive, select an Island woman to harass, rape, torture or annoy, and go to.  Any historically-specific concerns or platonic interests they might have are relegated to insignificance.Thus, the working relationship between the German Commandant and the Island Senator is overshadowed -- and rendered completely implausible -- by the Commandant's lustful pursuit of the Senator's wife.  No other meaningful relationships between members of the Island Goverment exist.  Political and personal friction between the Germans is hinted at, but never explored.  The only other working relationship between men that gets any attention is the collaboration between the German Harbormaster and an Island black marketeer, which is again pushed aside so that we can explore the German partner's affair with an Island woman.  This focus becomes almost comical: One household has three females, each of whom is sneaking off to fraternize with the Germans behind the backs of the other two.Sex is a real aspect of the human experience during war.  But I don't want it to consume 90% of the drama even if it is handled well and plausibly.  Here, it isn't.  Exploitation and melodrama replace empathy and realism so completely that the fate of Guernsey Jews is used as an excuse to set up a rape scene, which is then drawn out INTERMINABLY so we can all oggle the naked actress.  A woman's mistreatment by a Gestapo officer contains none of the little ""situational elements"" that made the old series seem so real:  It just plays like a scene out of bad melodrama.  The Guernsey ""Commando"" story is rehashed in a longer, duller way -- which then makes a huge departure from history just to set us up for another bit of exploitative swill.  The Island screening of the anti-semetic film JUD SUSS is shown -- not to explore the psychological effect the film actually had on people (any character who goes to see it is either already Completely Evil, or else too PC to suffer ill effects) -- but rather so that we can all watch the rape-scene from this movie.  It's relentless.I disagree with those reviewers who claim that this series presents overly-nice Germans for the purpose of whitewashing National Socialism or promoting the European Union or for any other reason.  The script argueably makes these Germans worse than their historical counterparts -- most obviously in the portrayal of the Commandant.  The evident intent is to use rape and seduction as Metaphors for the whole Occupation experience.  All the male/female relationships in the series entail varying degrees of coercion and/or moral compromise.  Even the decent German, Captain Muller, uses his kindly platonic interest in a fatherless girl to suborn her into unwise fraternization, which then seriously endangers her safety and reputation.  But most of the major German characters are not decent, nor is there anything unintentional about the harm they do to women.  The Baron is a brutish lecher, the Gestapo agent a mysogynistic sadist, and Walker a psychopath.  Even the lovelorn Luftwaffe prettyboy is an incredibly selfish cad who guilt-trips a girl into going out with him because he feels bad about his part in the death of her father and wants to make himself feel better.Well, now that I've defended the writer's intentions, I'll go back to viciously shredding this series, because I do not like the result -- to put it mildly.  I watch British historical drama for good storytelling, plausible characters, and an evocation of what the historical experience was actually LIKE for the people who lived it.  Here, the story and characters exist primarily to set up a authorially-indulgent meditation on Sex and Power.  And instead of using appropriate metaphor to illuminate the actual historical experience, the historical experience is distorted to fit into this all-important rape metaphor.  Just for example, the real Commandant of the Islands at this time was NOT a stereotypical ""Boche"" out of British propaganda films.  Nor have I heard that he was fond of threathening to rape the wives of Island officials.  So what is the point of portraying him that way?  Especially since German sadists, sex-criminals and cads are already being so tediously well-represented elsewhere in the story?  Can't he do something else? Like his job?  What is worse is that his sadistic exterior hides a warm-and-gooey center, and the female he terrorizes finds his brutish attentions secretly attractive.  This bodice-ripper approach is grossly offensive, and is probably the element most responsible for the well-deserved cancellation of this series.  Aside from the rape-porn scene and the general tedium, that is.I did like the little jazz singer, the black-marketeers, and the adventures of the dead pig.  Also some scenes scattered here and there, especially the nightclub scenes in the final episode.  But I'm surprised at the positive reviews for the series.  It took me months to get through it.  As for the supposedly-unusual ""human"" portrayals of the enemy, that was standard practice in the classic British dramas -- and they did a much better job of it.",2,"Trashy ""remake"" of ENEMY AT THE

872100,A1XAR44IW48IEK,B0006Q93F6,Michael N. Ryan,"[17, 28]","Most shows on television are turkies. Awful just does not give the full meaning to say how bad American tv is. PBS tends to show some of the worst. Liberal scri[t writers who just do not understand what the American people are tends to be the problem.Not to mention bad acting and poor selection of subjects.When I saw this show advertised on PBS, I thought I would give it a try. And I found to my delite this show really was a joy to watch that I would like to see more episodes, which are unlikely as I hwear the guy producing it has died.Britain has that odd abilty that this country does not have. The ability to produce actors really know how to act and speak english. American actors can't do either.The settings are perfect. I loved the scenery provided by the Isle of Mann. The cloths are period. It is good to see women properly dressed rather than in trousers. The characters physically look their roles. It is all first rate work.I enjoyed the personal conflicts of the characters. Angelique Mahi doing her best to keep her young impressionable sister away from German eyes only to find herself falling in love with young Luftwaffe airman Berhard Tielman was the best part. The honest cop, doing his best to be true to the island while his colleagues readily collaborate, and finding himself the baron's driver was another.Though there were many fun characters to watch, the Baron is the best of them. He was a joy to watch. He is well done. He has a wonderful sence of humor. He readily comes across as the strict prussian with the soft side.Of course, it has its flaws. In the DVD two bits of nudity which should have been clipped out. Some of the dialogue in the PBS show I wish were back in the DVD especially the Baron's early lecture on individual prussians being anarchists, but molded together under dicipline. A little confusion on whether it is set in 1940 or 1942. Refurences to Organisation Todt and its slave labor pool from eastern europe (still under Stalin in 1940). The baron wears the order of the GOld Cross which did not exist in 1940. Refurences to being sent to the Russian front and depoetation of Jews to the concentration camps which did not happen until later.But it did have its accurate side. The nazis did round up and deport local Jews to the camps. Zelda, based on Theresa Steiner, actually existed. Theresa Steiner died in Auschwitz.German behavior is well portrayed. Overall, they did their best to get along.The Germans did have a venerial disease problem, as did all armies of the period, and tired to cope with it. They imported french (...) to sate the lusts of their troops to protect the virtues of local girls. And many local girls were grabbed off the streets for medical inspections. But not as shown as part of some policy of harrasing possisble reistence people, but more likely German soldiers getting even with local girls for various reasons.Many of the German garrison had local girl friends, like the Americans on the British mainland. Fathering many children. I have actually read accounts where some individual Germans had to plead with superiors for permission to marry their girls whom they had fathered not one but numerous offspring. Which after the war proved quite an embarrasment to the Brits. Who went to great lengths to seperate these couples.I wonder if Angelique and Bernhard would have been among them.And many German soldiers were good people who made many friends with the locals. Acts of kindness performed are frequently mentioned in every article and book I have read on the German occupation period of the Channel Islands.So much material with which to make a good show series.I wish to see a sequel, but I doubt that will happen I am sorry to say.",4,This needs a sequel,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,3730,"['Most', 'shows', 'television', 'are', 'turkies', 'Awful', 'just', 'not', 'give', 'full', 'meaning', 'say', 'how', 'bad', 'American', 'tv', 'PBS', 'show', 'worst', 'Liberal', 'scri', '[', 't', 'writers', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'American', 'people', 'are', 'be', 'problem.Not', 'mention', 'bad', 'acting', 'poor', 'selection', 'subjects.When', 'saw', 'show', 'advertised', 'PBS', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'found', 'delite', 'show', 'really', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'episodes', 'are', 'unlikely', 'hwear', 'guy', 'producing', 'died.Britain', 'odd', 'abilty', 'country', 'not', 'have', 'ability', 'produce', 'actors', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'speak', 'english', 'American', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'either.The', 'settings', 'are', 'perfect', 'loved', 'scenery', 'provided', 'Isle', 'Mann', 'cloths', 'are', 'period', 'good', 'see', 'women', 'properly', 'dressed', 'rather', 'trousers', 'characters', 'physically', 'look', 'roles', 'first', 'rate', 'work.I', 'enjoyed', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'characters', 'Angelique', 'Mahi', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'young', 'impressionable', 'sister', 'away', 'German', 'eyes', 'only', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'young', 'Luftwaffe', 'airman', 'Berhard', 'Tielman', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'honest', 'cop', 'doing', 'best', 'be', 'true', 'island', 'colleagues', 'readily', 'collaborate', 'finding', 'baron', 'driver', 'was', 'were', 'many', 'fun', 'characters', 'watch', 'Baron', 'best', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'well', 'done', 'wonderful', 'sence', 'humor', 'readily', 'strict', 'prussian', 'soft', 'side.Of', 'course', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'two', 'bits', 'nudity', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'clipped', 'out', 'dialogue', 'PBS', 'show', 'wish', 'were', 'back', 'DVD', 'especially', 'Baron', 'early', 'lecture', 'individual', 'prussians', 'being', 'anarchists', 'molded', 'together', 'dicipline', 'little', 'confusion', 'set', '1940', '1942', 'Refurences', 'Organisation', 'Todt', 'slave', 'labor', 'pool', 'eastern', 'europe', 'still', 'Stalin', '1940', 'baron', 'order', 'GOld', 'Cross', 'did', 'not', 'exist', '1940', 'Refurences', 'being', 'sent', 'Russian', 'front', 'depoetation', 'Jews', 'concentration', 'camps', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'later.But', 'did', 'have', 'accurate', 'side', 'nazis', 'did', 'round', 'up', 'deport', 'local', 'Jews', 'camps', 'Zelda', 'based', 'Theresa', 'Steiner', 'actually', 'existed', 'Theresa', 'Steiner', 'died', 'Auschwitz.German', 'behavior', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Overall', 'did', 'best', 'get', 'along.The', 'Germans', 'did', 'have', 'venerial', 'disease', 'problem', 'did', 'armies', 'period', 'tired', 'cope', 'imported', 'french', 'sate', 'lusts', 'troops', 'protect', 'virtues', 'local', 'girls', 'many', 'local', 'girls', 'were', 'grabbed', 'streets', 'medical', 'inspections', 'not', 'as', 'shown', 'part', 'policy', 'harrasing', 'possisble', 'reistence', 'people', 'more', 'likely', 'German', 'soldiers', 'getting', 'even', 'local', 'girls', 'various', 'reasons.Many', 'German', 'garrison', 'had', 'local', 'girl', 'friends', 'Americans', 'British', 'mainland', 'Fathering', 'many', 'children', 'have', 'actually', 'read', 'accounts', 'where', 'individual', 'Germans', 'had', 'plead', 'superiors', 'permission', 'marry', 'girls', 'whom', 'had', 'fathered', 'not', 'one', 'numerous', 'offspring', 'war', 'proved', 'quite', 'embarrasment', 'Brits', 'Who', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'seperate', 'couples.I', 'wonder', 'Angelique', 'Bernhard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'them.And', 'many', 'German', 'soldiers', 'were', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'many', 'friends', 'locals', 'Acts', 'kindness', 'performed', 'are', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'article', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'German', 'occupation', 'period', 'Channel', 'Islands.So', 'much', 'material', 'make', 'good', 'show', 'wish', 'see', 'sequel', 'doubt', 'will', 'happen', 'am', 'sorry', 'say']",N/A

Like other reviews, I give high marks for all the original episodes.  It's got some pretty gritty scenes, certainly fitting for a story of Nazi occupation, but unsuitable for young people.  I'd say high school age would be OK.  War is tough, and this series shows how tough that can be.Similar subject matter is included as a small part of the excellent book by G.B. Edwards, The Book of Ebenezer Le Page, available here at Amazon.  It's a memoir of Channel Islands life, including the years of the Nazi occupation of Guernsey.

It wouldn't surprise me if the scripts for Island at War and Enemy At the Door drew inspiration from the Edwards book, the similarities are striking.",5,"Definitely for adults, possibly more episodes coming",1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,1009,"['recently', 'read', 'news', 'article', 'Acorn', 'acquisition', 'rights', 'distribute', 'various', 'series', 'mentioned', 'included', 'right', 'make', 'more', 'episodes', 'stories', 'including', 'Island', 'War', 'other', 'reviews', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'original', 'episodes', 'got', 'pretty', 'gritty', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'fitting', 'story', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'unsuitable', 'young', 'people', ""'d"", 'say', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'would', 'be', 'OK.', 'War', 'tough', 'series', 'how', 'tough', 'can', 'be.Similar', 'subject', 'matter', 'included', 'small', 'part', 'excellent', 'book', 'G.B', 'Edwards', 'Book', 'Ebenezer', 'Le', 'Page', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'memoir', 'Channel', 'Islands', 'life', 'including', 'years', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Guernsey', 'good', 'book', 'unusual', 'one', 'too', 'was', 'book', 'got', 'interested', 'Island', 'War', 'Enemy', 'Door', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'scripts', 'Island', 'War', 'Enemy', 'Door', 'drew', 'inspiration', 'Edwards', 'book', 'similarities', 'are', 'striking']",N/A
872106,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,B0006Q93F6,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[213, 217]","This BBC series is well written and well acted, and the Isle of Man location works perfectly as a substitute for the Channel Islands, but I would caution buyers that the series ends a bit abruptly, still in mid-war, with many plotlines dangling and unresolved.  This is not a little frustrating, and causes me to subtract a star from what I would otherwise be inclined to award.  The problem is one of conception -- this program was originally designed to continue for a second series, so the first batch of episodes ties up one plotline while leaving the rest in stasis as cliffhangers to draw viewers back for more.  Bad idea!  This is what I was told by my local PBS station:  The series was evidently not as well received in the UK as hoped for and a second series was never produced.  To make things worse, the screenwriter died.  This leaves us with, unfortunately, a fascinating story with a very fine beginning and middle but no true ending.  I suspect other viewers will be equally disappointed.  Just like the animated Ralph Bakshi version of The Lord of the Rings story, half a movie is almost worse than no movie at all.What there is is great, but be prepared to never know what finally happens to most of the chief characters.  It's like sitting down to what looks like a wonderful, lavish meal and then having to leave the table after the first course.",3,"Excellent production, but be aware that...",1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1366,"['BBC', 'series', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'Isle', 'Man', 'location', 'perfectly', 'substitute', 'Channel', 'Islands', 'would', 'caution', 'buyers', 'series', 'bit', 'abruptly', 'still', 'mid-war', 'many', 'plotlines', 'dangling', 'unresolved', 'not', 'little', 'frustrating', 'subtract', 'star', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'inclined', 'award', 'problem', 'one', 'conception', 'program', 'was', 'originally', 'designed', 'continue', 'second', 'series', 'first', 'batch', 'episodes', 'ties', 'up', 'one', 'plotline', 'leaving', 'rest', 'stasis', 'cliffhangers', 'draw', 'viewers', 'back', 'more', 'Bad', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'series', 'was', 'evidently', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'received', 'UK', 'hoped', 'second', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'produced', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'screenwriter', 'died', 'unfortunately', 'fascinating', 'story', 'very', 'fine', 'beginning', 'middle', 'true', 'ending', 'suspect', 'other', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'equally', 'disappointed', 'Just', 'animated', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'version', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'story', 'movie', 'almost', 'worse', 'movie', 'great', 'be', 'prepared', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'finally', 'most', 'chief', 'characters', 'sitting', 'down', 'what', 'wonderful', 'lavish', 'meal', 'then', 'having', 'leave', 'table', 'first', 'course']",N/A

And why are such superb productions not widely available on American TV cable networks, which now consist of hundreds of mostly worthless channels? As long as I can get access to such productions as ""Island at War"",  I do not plan plan to watch any more Hollywood drivel, and will very soon cancel my cable. I ask the same question about coffee, which I finns virtuallly undrinkable in American coffee bars and ultimately ask,  "" Why don't  they just go to a small hotell in Italy and ask how they make good coffee?"".  I mean,how hard can it be? After seeing such superb productions as ""Island at War"" with it's outstanding acting, gorgeous cinematography, gripping story lines, I ask ""Whty can't the Hollywood moguls just go over to England and find out how to make productions such as this?"" Are they just  too wedded to their tiresome special effects and disjointed story lines conceived of by some ""committee"" of so-called screen writers.
