Crude, pre-PC Animal House copycat in the same vien as ""Hollywood Knights,"" ""Hometown USA,"" ""Porky's,"" Ad nauseum. Racial slurs, weed smoking, Tom Poston as ""Sargeant Sissum"" (Don't ask, don't tell), and the punch bowl gag (loosely stolen from ""Hollywood Knights""). Oh yeah, the ending sequnece is hilarious and check out Ron Liebman's atrocious pickup lines at the party scenes.I recall that this film was so bad that even MAD MAGAZINE wanted their name taken off the film (no joke).

235951,A1WAUS33L3PRV,630027005X,"Big Guy ""mjlwriter""","[3, 4]","Ron Liebman and his character, Capt. Liceman, are the two funniest things about this movie. The weakest part: those [bad] voice overs spoken by the character Oliver. There is no way in real life that he would've been able to score with such a good looking girl. He is the penultimate geek, if you ask me. Ralph Macchio was good as the tough Italian guy, and that fat guy with the funny laugh is a riot. But, other parts of the movie which were not as good water down the overall comedic effect of the film. I did like Barbara Bach's character, as she was both sexy and very funny. I agree with one reviewer who likes the onset of the wind and the music when Liceman comes in the room. One classic scene, which is very subtle but funny: When one of the boys asks some obscure question, Liceman's shadow is seen, along with the wind and music, and he voices the answer -- you, however, don't get a shot of the captain, himself, however. Sort of the all-knowing, all-seeing effect. Oh, yes, the commandant constantly farting is hilarious. Very sophmophic humor, with some excellent high points. Ergo, my 3 stars.

235954,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,630027005X,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 5]","After National Lampoon's success with Animal House (1978), MAD Magazine tried its hand in movies with this film, titled Up the Academy (1980).  The Result?  It was considered so bad MAD Magazine's founder William Gaines actually paid Warner Brothers to remove any references to MAD Magazine upon release to home video.  So why does the reference to Mad appear on the DVD release?  Well, seems Time Warner has since bought MAD Magazine, and reinstated all previously removed references (seems your money was well spent, Bill)...directed by Robert Downey Sr. (Putney Swope, Greaser's Palace), the film features Wendell Brown (Dreams Don't Die), Tommy Citera (Forty Deuce), Hutch Parker (credited as J. Hutchison), and Ralph Macchio (The Karate Kid, My Cousin Vinny), in his very first film.  Also appearing is Ron Leibman (The Hot Rock, Norma Rae), Tom Poston (""The Steve Allen Show""), Ian Wolfe (The Terminal Man), Harry Teinowitz (The Package), Antonio `Huggy Bear' Fargas (""Starsky and Hutch""), Stacey Nelkin (Halloween III: Season of the Witch), and former Bond girl Barbara Bach (The Spy Who Loved Me).As the movie begins we meet four teenage boys, all troublemakers and delinquents, whose families are preparing to send them off to military school.  There's Chooch (Macchio), who apparently has no respect for his mobster roots, Eisenhower `Ike' MacArthur (Brown), a pot smoking son of Baptist preacher who can't keep his hands off his stepmother, Oliver (Parker), who knocked up his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin), threatening his father's mayoral candidacy, and Hash (Citera), the son of a wealthy sheik and persistent pickpocket.  As the boys arrive at the Sheldon R. Weinberg Military Academy they soon find themselves in a world of suck under the watchful eye of a sadistic, narcissistic, psychotic sleaze named Major Vaughn Liceman (Leibman).  After a few run ins with Liceman, the boys get a new roommate named Rodney Ververgaert (Teinowitz), a nasally, chubby, snickering, arsonist who's fairly annoying, but seems to share a common bond with his bunkmates in their hatred for Liceman.  Anyway, the boys, sans Chooch, sneak out to visit a neighboring school for girls called the Mildred S. Butch Academy, so Oliver can visit Candy, but the foursome gets busted as they return.  Not only that, but Liceman's got compromising photos of Oliver and Candy, which he uses to blackmail the boys threatening to use them to mess up Oliver's father's mayoral bid.  The boys retaliate by setting Liceman up, with Candy's help, during a mixer, and obtaining their own embarrassing photos, resulting in a sort of standoff.  Eventually Liceman and the boys come to an agreement, one that includes whoever wins the soccer game set to be played between the faculty and the students on the upcoming parents weekend will get all the photos, but seeing how the faculty has never lost, the boys will have to come up with a plan to settle Liceman's hash once and for all...Where William Gaines ultimately failed in keeping the MAD Magazine (the magazine had virtually nothing to do with the content of the film) name off this film, actor Ron Leibman succeded, as you'll not see him listed anywhere in the credits, promotional materials, or even the theatrical trailer.  I'm unsure his specific reasons for his requesting this, but I've read it had something to do with a falling out he had with producers (seems there was more than one person who didn't wish to see this film released).  It's kind of funny as Leibman's performance as the main antagonist is probably the most memorable of the film. Anyway, where Animal House succeded, Up the Academy failed miserably (it's not that people just didn't like the film, but they actually hated it).  My opinion on the matter, besides the fact Up the Academy had not one tenth the charm or humor of Animal House, was that while Animal House was set at a university, something a large number of people could relate to, Up the Academy is set at a military academy, something a lot of people probably couldn't relate to...there's lots of other faults too, like the weak writing, unlikable main characters, unfunny situations, and so on.  But despite all that, I still somewhat enjoy this film ever since I saw it on cable back in the early 1980s.  Why?  It's hard to explain...perhaps the salacious humor, which is fairly politically inncorrect, appeals to the juvenilistic tendencies I still harbor.  Upon watching the film again last night a number of the crude gags didn't hold up as well (the senile, flatuent commandant) , but there were some that made me laugh.  One of the funniest parts for me occurred during the mixer dance, as Major Liceman is trying unsuccessful to pick up on some female officers from the visiting girls academy.  He'd come up to one of them, make some innoculous small talk, and then slip in some weird, fetistic request involving rope and feathers which would usually elicit a ""What the fudge?"" response from the women.  Another hilarious bit was Tom Poston's ultra effeminate character of Master Sergeant Skip Sisson.  He wasn't in the film that much but whenever he popped up, it usually made me laugh.  It wasn't so much the homersexual overtones that made me laugh, but the fact they were so exaggerated.  The most memorable bits of dialog come from Liebman's character, the first being the phrase `Say it again!', one he often use on cadets who forgot to address him as `sir', and another occuring as Hash the Arab has a run in with Liceman, the latter chastising the former for wearing his Arab headdress and claiming it's `not regulation and it makes you stand out like a turd in the punchbowl.'  Liceman uses the `turd in a punchbowl' reference a couple of times, after which someone, while at the mixer, actually puts a turd in the punchbowl.  A couple of other positive aspects include Barbara Bach and Stacey Nelkin, both of whom have minor roles but look amazing.  Bach plays an instructor specializing in cleavage and phallic armaments while Nelkin plays Candy, Oliver's buxom and easy on the eyes girlfriend.  While this film is rated R, it's not due to any nekkidness, but mainly because of language.  Another aspect of the film I really liked is the soundtrack, which features performances by Blondie, Cheap Trick, Sammy Hagar, Iggy & The Stooges, The Kinks, Nick Lowe, and Lou Reed, to name a few.  All in all the film is mainly a curiosity, one that probably won't appeal to most other than a handful of those, like myself, who caught it on cable during their misspent youth.The picture on this DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks remarkably good, much better than I would have expected (heck, I wasn't even expecting a widescreen release), and the Dolby Digital stereo audio, available in both English and French, comes through well.  There's not much in the way of extras other than subtitles in English, French, and Spanish, and a theatrical trailer, which includes various shots of a statue of MAD's spokesman Alfred E. Newman in military garb, ones that weren't included in the film's release.Cookieman108",3,"""Geez, I don't remember this barbed wire in any of the brochures.""",1162771200,"11 6,

I remember wanting to see this on video, as I noticed that Ralph ""The Karate Kid"" Macchio was one of the guys on the box (and I was only ten!). Watching it, this was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen, and though it's pure corn, it's still an unsung piece of treasure from that era.By the way, the 1987 video reissue is the original cut of the film, with the ""MAD"" Magazine and Alfred E. Neuman references still intact (they were excised in certain prints of the film). One other weird thing is that Ron Liebman wanted his name taken off the film, but the movie isn't THAT bad! Also, one interesting quirk is that at the end of the movie, the credits scroll down the creen, instead of up (the only other I can think of that does this is ""Repo Man"").For the guy who wanted to know whatever became of Stacey Nelkin, she's lately been doing cartoon voice-overs and stuff like that. Her being in some very bad movies after this one (notably ""Halloween III"", ""Going Ape"" and ""Yellowbeard"") surely didn't do much for her career, which was a shame, as she was a major hottie in this one. I especially like when she's wearing that haremoutfit, but the part where she takes off her top is really nice (hotcha!).So, if you want something that's hilarious, bawdy, offensive and just pure cheesy early 80's fun, get this!",5,Weinberg Forever!,1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,1531,"['one', 'obscure', 'hilarious', 'movies', '1980', 'was', 'only', 'seen', 'late-night', 'cable', 'very', 'badly', 'edited', 'form', 'USA', 'Network', 'Student', 'Bodies', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'Together', 'Again', 'remember', 'wanting', 'see', 'video', 'noticed', 'Ralph', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Macchio', 'was', 'one', 'guys', 'box', 'was', 'only', 'ten', 'Watching', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'pure', 'corn', 'still', 'unsung', 'piece', 'treasure', 'way', '1987', 'video', 'reissue', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'MAD', 'Magazine', 'Alfred', 'E.', 'Neuman', 'references', 'still', 'intact', 'were', 'excised', 'certain', 'prints', 'film', 'One', 'other', 'weird', 'thing', 'Ron', 'Liebman', 'wanted', 'name', 'taken', 'off', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'bad', 'Also', 'one', 'interesting', 'quirk', 'end', 'movie', 'credits', 'scroll', 'down', 'creen', 'instead', 'only', 'other', 'can', 'think', 'Repo', 'Man', '.For', 'guy', 'who', 'wanted', 'know', 'became', 'Stacey', 'Nelkin', 'lately', 'been', 'doing', 'cartoon', 'voice-overs', 'stuff', 'being', 'very', 'bad', 'movies', 'one', 'notably', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Going', 'Ape', 'Yellowbeard', 'surely', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'career', 'was', 'shame', 'was', 'major', 'hottie', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'wearing', 'haremoutfit', 'part', 'where', 'top', 'really', 'nice', 'hotcha', '.So', 'want', 'something', 'hilarious', 'bawdy', 'offensive', 'just', 'pure', 'cheesy', 'early', '80', 'fun', 'get']",N/A

A funny and self depricating acting turn by Emmy winner Ron Liebman as the wormy, sadisitc, and sleazy Major Liceman; interesting that his part is uncredited. It always cracks me up that when he walks into a room a chill wind precedes him and makes everyone shiver in his presence.

Up the Academy is one of those &quot;comedic&quot; films that tried to capture the 15 to 30 viewer market. The movie  completely strikes out. There is not a single line, scene, or actor that is  funny.  The film's only saving grace is the appearance of a gorgeous,  brunette, dynamo named Candy played by Stacey Nelkin.  Nelkin dominates  every scene she is in.  Her angelic eyes, face, and smile is  counterbalanced by a drop dead killer body.  Her bust is magnificiently  displayed in a white satin bra when in one scene she sexually attacks her  boyfriend.  Stacey Nelkin should have been the pin-up girl of the 1980's,  but she has slipped into obscurity.  Unflattering roles in Going Ape and  Halloween- Season of the Witch did nothing to enhance her stunning sex  appeal.  She was cast as the sixth replicant in Blade Runner but her part  was cut due to an escalating budget. Instead we are stuck with watching an  ugly Daryl Hannah perform ridiculous backflips? as the only female  replicant in the movie.  I recorded this movie from HBO many years ago  because of Stacey Nelkin's sexy performance.  Her part should have been  expanded, then maybe the movie would be worth watching in its' entirety.  Instead I  fast forward to the scenes in which Stacey appears. Those scenes  are the only ones worth watching.",2,Stacey Nelkin Where Are You?,956793600,"04 27, 2000",2000,1416,"['box', 'office', 'success', 'Animal', 'House', 'Hollywood', 'churned', 'out', 'dozens', 'hopeless', 'imitators', 'Academy', 'one', 'quot', 'comedic', 'quot', 'films', 'tried', 'capture', '15', '30', 'viewer', 'market', 'movie', 'completely', 'out', 'not', 'single', 'line', 'scene', 'actor', 'funny', 'film', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'appearance', 'gorgeous', 'brunette', 'dynamo', 'named', 'Candy', 'played', 'Stacey', 'Nelkin', 'Nelkin', 'scene', 'angelic', 'eyes', 'face', 'smile', 'counterbalanced', 'drop', 'dead', 'killer', 'body', 'bust', 'magnificiently', 'displayed', 'white', 'satin', 'bra', 'when', 'one', 'scene', 'sexually', 'boyfriend', 'Stacey', 'Nelkin', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'pin-up', 'girl', '1980', 'slipped', 'obscurity', 'Unflattering', 'roles', 'Going', 'Ape', 'Halloween-', 'Season', 'Witch', 'did', 'nothing', 'enhance', 'stunning', 'sex', 'appeal', 'was', 'cast', 'sixth', 'replicant', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'part', 'was', 'cut', 'due', 'escalating', 'budget', 'Instead', 'are', 'stuck', 'watching', 'ugly', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'perform', 'ridiculous', 'backflips', 'only', 'female', 'replicant', 'movie', 'recorded', 'movie', 'HBO', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Stacey', 'Nelkin', 'sexy', 'performance', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'then', 'maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'entirety', 'Instead', 'fast', 'forward', 'scenes', 'Stacey', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'watching']",N/A
