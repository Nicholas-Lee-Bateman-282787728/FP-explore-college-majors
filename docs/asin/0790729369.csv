Meryl Streep is married to a wonderful husband who she completely fails to appreciate.  He's nothing.  Take a hike, jerk.  The man she falls for, to the point of  insisting on being buried with when the time comes, is some guy who drifted  into her life for a week while her husband had taken the kids on a camping  trip.  Sure he's a nice guy.  But what kind of advantage is that.  Who will  a woman be more excited about - her husband of 20 years or some handsome  new guy who falls for her while hubby is away?  This ditz seems to think  that she and her lover are doing the family a favor by not splitting up the  family.  Who the hell is she?  I hope her husband had a few dozen girls on  the side.  It would be hard to find a more unappreciative or a stupider  wife than the one starring in this movie.  He's a photographer.

Meryl Streep plays the Italian-American housewife Francesca and Clint Eastwood plays the free-spirited photographer Robert. Streep spends most of the film crying. I'm not joking....there are about 5 10-minute scenes with her silently in tears to the obligatory piano/violin soundtrack. Clint does his best to act like he loves her, but it's not too convincing. And the film is framed as a flashback by Francesca's son and daughter, their badly-acted soap opera subplot and their nadir personalities nauseating this reviewer. Robert tries to get Francesca to ""come away with me"", but, you guessed it, she has a family to consider. Their relationship borders on pathetic. One thing I know; I wouldn't want to ""come away with"" the emotionally unstable Francesca.Dirty Harry/Blondy does not belong in this terrible waste of film. And Sophie made the wrong Choice to lower herself to this. Then again neither of these great actors have done anything significant in the last 10 years. Another Streep film even worse than this, believe it or not, is Falling in Love with Robert Deniro with basically the same plot as Bridges.

88323,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790729369,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 12]","Okay, so my wife told me that this movie was beyond boring, but since our taste is so different (and I make it a point to see everything related to Oscar in any way) I decided to check this movie out regardless of her feelings.  I can see why she said it was boring.  I personally didn't find it boring (I have my complaints, don't worry), but I understand why she would say that.  Eastwood tried very hard to create a romantic tone to the film, so unless you are drawn to long scenes of two people dancing then you may find yourself; bored.The film tells the story of Francesca, a middle-aged Italian housewife living in Madison County.  When her husband and children are away at the Illinois State Fair she meets and falls in love with a photographer by the name of Robert Kincaid.  They have a four day love affair that ends far too quickly (for them) and then they go their separate ways.  This story is told in flashbacks as Francesca's two children, Carolyn and Michael, read her diary shortly after her death.So, ready for my take on this?I want to start by saying to anyone who may have an issue with this; I rarely ever review a DVD, but always review a film.  I don't personally care about extras, I care about the movie.  Be realistic, how much time are you going to spend watching a films extra's compared to the film itself, and if the film is not worth buying, are the extra's going to change your mind?  So, if you want to know about the bonus features then read another review, but there is no need to click `negative' at the bottom of mine just because I didn't explain all that can be found in the video commentary.So, here's my take...I am not a rationalist when it comes to movies; at least not as much as some are.  I can totally buy the whole `love at fist sight' bit because it's that suspension of belief that makes movie watching so exciting.  If you take everything so literally and seriously then you lose a lot of the joy that comes from movies.  That said, I found some of `The Bridges of Madison County' to be a stretch.  The ending really did it for me, kind of fell to pieces a bit.  I also don't buy Clint Eastwood as a leading man, at all.  I think the casting choice (I know he directed, and he probably wanted to get close with Streep, but seriously, this was a bad move) was way off.  They were originally going to go with Redford.  I'm not a fan of his too much, but at least it would have been more believable.  It's hard to invest yourself in the love story when Francesca's attraction to Robert doesn't make much sense.He's not even all that interesting, really.I also didn't like the idea of having her children read the diary, addressed to them mind you.  It didn't make much sense to me.  You see, in order for it to be necessary that her children know about the affair it should be groundbreaking for them.  I know that the film tries to make it seem that way (with the children's decisions regarding their mates afterward) but it rested uneasy with me.  I didn't see any need whatsoever to inform your children that you were unfaithful to a man who loved you and treated you with respect and dignity.  It would have been different if Francesca's husband was a mean man or a tyrant but he was kind and gentle and caring.  To make your children aware of you actions is somewhat hurtful in my opinion.  That is something you take to your grave, and leave buried.This isn't a review on my opinions on adultery at all, so don't take it as one.  Sure, I believe that adultery is wrong, but I understand that human imperfection causes us to act in ways that are contrary to our own beliefs at times, and we can be taken over by impure lust and moved to do some crazy things (but with Eastwood?) but there is a moral high ground regarding your children that I think any good parent would want to keep, and telling them of your hurtful actions can scar them, permanently.I also found the actors who portrayed the children and their clich&eacute;d reactions to the diary to be rather mediocre and I would have preferred they were not there.The scenes with Streep and Eastwood, and the love affair that develops, is sweet when you look at it apart from the adultery aspect.  It is romantic; Eastwood (the director) makes sure of that.  Both Eastwood and Streep act circles around each other, Streep especially pulling out another Oscar worthy performance.  She is the queen of the accent and she makes them seem effortless.  She has such command over her character, and that scene in the car with her husband, the hand clenching the door handle, just marvelous acting (heartbreaking too).  So don't get me wrong here, there is something to like about this movie, and the story that develops is endearing (I never found it boring).  I just wish that it had been handled a little better in parts.  Cast another leading man and clean up the way in which the story is told (no need for flashbacks, the film is powerful enough without them) and it could have been a five star movie.  Instead I give it a high C, thanks to Streep and her unfathomable talent.",3,I've got a few issues with this one...,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,5087,"['Okay', 'wife', 'told', 'movie', 'was',

Chow,"[5, 6]","This film stands as a rare but welcome example of how an atrociously bad book can be turned into a surprisingly good movie.It is worth noting that the theme of infidelity in this movie is really no worse than the vast majority of stuff churned out over the years by the Hollywood mill. Even classics like ""Casablanca"" hinted at scenes of infidelity, and modern day award winners like ""American Beauty"" approach this topic with an outright sneer. It seems to me that the unapologetic treatment of infidelity accorded in this movie is preferable to the cynical manipulations that pervade most Hollywood fare. I can't quite bring myself to frown upon a theme that is as old as humanity and is too often shrouded either in unctuous rectitude or blatant hypocrisy. This film earns the right to be judged on its own terms.In that respect, this film works rather well. Somehow, Eastwood took one of the most overwrought, overripe tomes of purple prose ever written, and transformed it into a moving story of two soul-mates who find each other all too briefly and much too late. The wince-inducing prose of the book is completely replaced with nuanced and restrained performances that convince us through pauses, body language and inspired acting.This film shows us not only that film is capable of transforming almost any story into something worthwhile, but that film is an altogether different medium than literature. What counts in literature is the play of words, and when those words reach flights of such bombast that we must reach for the vomit bags, the writing becomes its own parody. Film, however, is a play of images, and what would be bombastic in words is arresting in imagery. This is why the film works where the book does not.This film is relentlessly sentimental and will not appeal to some viewers. If you count yourself unsentimental, then by all means avoid this movie. But if you like your pancakes with lots of syrup, then this movie rises significantly above your average IHOP fare.",4,A Silk Purse From A Sow's Ear,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1999,"['film', 'rare', 'welcome', 'example', 'how', 'atrociously', 'bad', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'theme', 'infidelity', 'movie', 'really', 'worse', 'vast', 'majority', 'stuff', 'churned', 'out', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'mill', 'Even', 'classics', 'Casablanca', 'hinted', 'scenes', 'infidelity', 'modern', 'day', 'winners', 'American', 'Beauty', 'approach', 'topic', 'outright', 'sneer', 'unapologetic', 'treatment', 'infidelity', 'accorded', 'movie', 'preferable', 'cynical', 'manipulations', 'pervade', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'frown', 'theme', 'as', 'old', 'humanity', 'too', 'often', 'shrouded', 'unctuous', 'rectitude', 'blatant', 'hypocrisy', 'film', 'right', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'terms.In', 'respect', 'film', 'rather', 'well', 'Somehow', 'Eastwood', 'took', 'one', 'most', 'overwrought', 'overripe', 'tomes', 'purple', 'prose', 'ever', 'written', 'transformed', 'moving', 'story', 'two', 'soul-mates', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'too', 'briefly', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'wince-inducing', 'prose', 'book', 'completely', 'replaced', 'nuanced', 'restrained', 'performances', 'convince', 'pauses', 'body', 'language', 'inspired', 'acting.This', 'film', 'shows', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'capable', 'transforming', 'almost', 'story', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'altogether', 'different', 'medium', 'literature', 'What', 'literature', 'play', 'words', 'when', 'words', 'reach', 'flights', 'such', 'bombast', 'must', 'reach', 'vomit', 'bags', 'writing', 'own', 'parody', 'Film', 'however', 'play', 'images', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'bombastic', 'words', 'arresting', 'imagery', 'why', 'film', 'where', 'book', 'not.This', 'film', 'relentlessly', 'sentimental', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'count', 'unsentimental', 'then', 'means', 'avoid', 'movie', 'like', 'pancakes', 'lots', 'syrup', 'then', 'movie', 'significantly', 'average', 'IHOP', 'fare']",N/A

Most of us will die without really being in love and will never know what we missed.  A few lucky (or depending on your view, deeply unlucky) ones will fall in love at middle or old age.And we will not be able to jump ship from our dull lives because we are afraid that the new lover will tire of us soon enough.  Or it won't work.  Or we feel too attached to the familiar and prefer the numbing as opposed to the stimulating.  Or we do not have the financial means to do whatever we want.  Or we love the kid though we do not love the co-parent.This movie captured very well the truly imperfect choices we have in love and life.I think the only happy ending for this couple would have been joint death by suicide or accident.

Any novel worth rereading must be pretty good, I thought.  So I bought the book and read it, and it was pretty good.  I liked it, and when the movie showed up on cable TV I saw it, and liked it, too.  I think the movie is even better than the book.So I bought this DVD edition.  And it, too, is good, if all you want is to see the movie.  The special features are lackluster, to say the least.  The movie is not in widescreen format.  It starts with English subtitles, requiring you to use the menu to cancel this feature each time.  And the menus are not that easy to use, due to poor highlighting,  There are no commentaries by anyone, no trailer, no previews, no deleted scenes or outtakes, etc.The production notes have some nice photos, but the text is hard to read on a small screen TV, as are the cast biographies.  There's the usual scene index, but that's about it.  If you just want to have a copy of this fine movie, you might consider buying the somewhat cheaper VHS version.

88339,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0790729369,California Dreaming,"[2, 3]","I just viewed and reviewed ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" and I pretty much hated it.  While watching I thought, ""Will this movie stay with me for a while?  Will I still consider the characters and the themes, the overall meaning of this film, for any length of time?""  And the answer was, ""No.  I will forget this film when it's (thankfully) over.""  Unfortunately, I'm still thinking about how poorly it was executed 15 hours later.  It left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.But believe it or not, while I was watching that film, I was thinking about this film.  Yes, that may sound odd, but for me, a movie is an experience that should evoke some type of emotion other than boredom.  (Is boredom an emotion?)  You might think the following:  ""Bridges of Madison County"" will be boring while ""The Cabin in the Woods"" will be exciting!  (Exclamation points are terribly overused, but maybe we need one here.)  And you would be dead wrong, kind of like those forgettable characters in ""Cabin"" that did us a huge favor by dying themselves.Now, this film surely has a better cast, that is for sure.  We have perhaps the greatest actress ever - Meryl Streep - with one of the best directors ever (and an excellent actor as well) - Clint Eastwood.  Cabin had, who, Thor?  I didn't recognize any of them, minus a cameo, and I don't care if I ever see another film with any of them in it.  But this movie is about taking pictures of bridges and maybe some weekend fling - not to give too much away, but you get the ""bridge"" part for free from the title - so therefore this film couldn't be too interesting, could it?And there you would be wrong again.  It's all in the execution; it's all in the emotion.  Ms. Streep's performance is fantastic, perhaps her best (very tricky to say since she's always spot on).  And I got the feeling that Mr. Eastwood kicked up his acting a notch to keep up with her, and it shows.  One of his better performances as well.  I felt an unbelievable connection to both of our protagonists here, I felt the longing that they felt, and I ultimately felt the pain that they endured as well.

88343,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0790729369,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 5]","The Bridges of Madison County is a great film. It was based on a novel written by Robert James Waller. He finished his manuscript in just eleven days, intending it to be a gift for various friends and family. One of his friends asked if he could try to interest a literary agent in the book. Waller got a call from a New York agent who asked, ""...Robert, where have you been all my life?"" It was a powerful narrative, though some critics complained that it was poorly written. Nevertheless, there was something in the story that really resonated with a large segment of the public.Various directors and actors were suggested for bringing the story to the silver screen. Sydney Pollack was supposed to direct it with Robert Redford as the star. Other contenders for the female lead included Cher, Isabella Rossellini, Catherine Deneuve, Susan Sarandon, Jessica Lange, Barbara Hershey and Anjelica Huston. Next it was going to be Bruce Beresford, but he wanted to make the Francesca Johnson character English, and the studio didn't accept this direction.Eastwood proved to be the best possible choice for director, and he directed himself well as the National Geographic photographer assigned to take pictures of the covered bridges of Madison County. Meryl Streep stars as Francesca Johnson, a farmer's wife who has a four-day stand with the photographer that proves to be the love of her life, though she stays with her husband. As an actress, Meryl did all the things that Oscar hungry actors do to prove their commitment to their characters: Meryl played the character as both middle aged and old. Streep gained 15 or 20 pounds to play the role, and she speaks with an Italian accent. She is really good with accents, but that is just the beginning. What really impressed me was how she could convey such complex emotions, yet she was always totally believable and natural.There is a really great scene where she prepares dinner for her family, and they all eat, each in their own worlds, oblivious to her obvious excitement, anticipating spending time with the photographer, Robert Kincaid, while her family is away. Since we know what the family doesn't, and since the camera is focusing on her, we see that she has a twinkle in her eye--but no one else notices anything out-of-the-ordinary. Streep is acting up a storm, but she makes it all seem so natural and realistic. This scene is a fine piece of acting, where it is not the culmination of the story arc, but just an average day in the life. Streep makes it all count, and all these little scenes set the stage for the really dramatic show downs when their emotions boil over.The two children, when they learn of their mother's secret life, are shocked and dismayed, and very angry at their mother for betraying their father. But as they read more of the letters they come to a new understanding of their mother, and make changes for the better in their own lives. They go from acting like a couple of jerks to being very sympathetic characters. As good and well cast as these roles are, the main focus is on the once-in-a-lifetime romance between Robert Kincaid and Francesca Johnson. Eastwood and Streep prove to be the perfect combination.Just a few random notes on other things I loved about The Bridges of Madison County:Meryl Streep was trained as an opera singer, and though she doesn't sing here, there are two scenes with Maria Callas singing. One is ""Casta Diva from 'Norma'"" by Vincenzo Bellini. The other is ""Mon coeur s'ouvre &agrave; ta voix from 'Samson et Dalila'"" by Camille Saint-Sans. As Francesca listens to some opera on the radio, her daughter switches to a station that is playing ""Leader of the Pack"" performed by The Shangri-las. This gesture speaks volumes about the mother-daughter relationship, and also shows how much her family takes her for granted. The opera is a great touch for her character, who is from Italy. Streep can be heard singing Country Western in Postcards From the Edge, and does a great job. She currently is in the ABBA musical, Mama Mia. She wanted very badly to have the role of Evita, and felt that she was a much better singer than Madonna. Hey, I'm inclined to believe her.Robert Kincaid is more of a jazz fan, and there are some great cuts with baritone crooner Johnny Hartman setting the mood. Hartman is best known among jazz fans for his stunning album of ballads recorded with John Coltrane. Eastwood showcases some stuff that Hartman did without Coltrane, neglected gems worthy of further attention. Also heard are Irene Kral, Dinah Washington, and Ahmad Jamal. At one point Robert Kincaid takes Francesca to a rural blues joint where they are not likely to see anyone that knows her. It is a great scene and also gives him a chance to show off his son Kyle who plays bass with the group, The James Rivers Band. Eastwood himself, who plays piano, composed the theme music along with Lennie Niehaus, who also did the music for Bird.Selected Films and Roles of Meryl StreepThe Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)(2006) .... Miranda Priestly was something different for Streep, a cold hearted business woman. Great performance that might have gotten more than an Oscar nomination if only her character wasn't so mean.A Prairie Home Companion(2006) .... More accents for Streep as Yolanda Johnson, and also some good singing.Adaptation (Superbit Collection). (2002) .... Streep is Susan Orlean in this convoluted story within a story about a writer trying to adapt a book about orchids into a film script. It is the second script for Charlie Kaufman after Being John Malkovich.Postcards from the Edge(1990) .... Streep plays Suzanne Vale, an actress with mother issues. Mom, played by Shirley McLaine, is always upstaging. Written by Carrie Fisher, whose real life mom, Debbie Reynolds, might possibly have provided some material. Streep sings country western! She does great, starting out shaky but with a strong finish. ""Checking Out of This Heartbreak Hotel"" serves as a metaphor for her journey of self discovery and personal empowerment.A Cry in the Dark(1988) AKA Evil Angels .... Streep did good job acting, perhaps better than Out of Africa. Streep's character, Lindy Chamberlain, was a real person in Australia who was sent to prison for killing her child, but claimed that ""the dingoes got my baby."" After a long time behind bars they finally decided that her story could have been true. Meanwhile, the line became a target for parody. The line even provided a name for a band on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Out of Africa(1985) .... As Karen Blixen Streep used a Danish accent. Redford's character was supposed to be English, but he refused. Streep however, can't resist the challenge of mastering a new accent, and it is one of the main tools in her acting toolbox.Directed by Clint EastwoodMillion Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition)(2004) This Oscar winning film, directed by Clint Eastwood, has Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank in the leading roles. It is about the sport of female boxing.Bird(1988) Eastwood directed Forest Whitaker in this biography of jazz musician Charlie Parker. Eastwood has quite a feel for jazz, and he worked with Lennie Niehaus on the soundtrack, and Lennie also did the music for TBOMC.Honkytonk Man(1982) Eastwood played the Honkytonk Man, and his son, Kyle played his nephew who followed in his uncle's musical footprints. In TBOMC Kyle has a part as a bass player for the James Rivers Band, who all play themselves.Play Misty for Me(1971) This early directorial effort by Eastwood also has a jazz theme. He plays a jazz DJ who is stalked by a fan who always requests that he play ""Misty."" I think that the version he plays is by Errol Garner.Caroline: Who knew that, in between bake sales, my mother was Anas Nin?",5,This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime,1219017600,"08 18,

He's not just some sneering tough guy getting ready to punch a thug in the mug--he can play a soft-spoken, artistic, touchy-feely guy, and he proves it with THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, a film he also directs.  (This guy does it all.)  And his romantic counterpart, pray tell?  Meryl Streep.  'Nuff said.  You know this film is going to contain some powerful performances before the very first frame.But what I really love about this movie are the various ""flash forwards"", when the film jumps from the Sixties to the present, as Streep's character's children (Annie Corley and Victor Slezak) read and discuss their mother's memoirs.  In essence, they learn of their mother's passionate affair simultaneously with the viewer, and it's a marvelous dramatic device.  We all watch as lonely Francesca Johnson, home alone while her husband and children are away for the week at the state fair, falls deeply in love with 'National Geographic' photographer Robert Kincaid, on assignment in Iowa to take pictures of the local covered bridges.  And as reason and fidelity and duty eventually give way to emotion and passion we are all reminded of the total fragility of the human condition.  Eastwood and Streep are marvelous together; their chemistry sparks this very tender love story--a love story with far-reaching consequences for all the film's characters.  The climactic scene when Francesca must choose between family and love is worth the purchase price alone; THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is a beautifully crafted, exceptional film.--D.

88355,A1LACH6MLQWZ,0790729369,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","""The Bridges of Madison County,"" which I watched when it first came out in the theaters, is the story of a romance that lasted an extended weekend (some four days, as I recall) between a National Geographic photographer (Clint Eastwood) and Francesca (Meryl Streep), an Italian war bride who has lived in rural Iowa with her husband ever since. When her husband and children leave for a four-day trip to the Illinois State Fair, she meets Robert Kincaid, the NG photographer, who happens to stop by her place seeking directions to help him with his assignment, which is to photograph the covered bridges of Madison County. After spending the day together taking pictures of bridges, they become romantically involved and have a four-day fling. When Francesca's husband and children come back, she must make a decision as to whether to stay with her husband or leave with Robert. She decides to stay. However, she never forgets Robert nor he her, as is attested to the fact that when he dies his ashes are sent to her and she tosses them off one of the bridges. When her now-grown children come across the story she has written about her encounter, they discover that she too wants her ashes tossed where Robert's are.The strong point of this movie is the acting by the two main characters. Clint Eastwood steps out of his usual ""Dirty Harry,"" ""Gran Torino,"" etc. role and portrays a sensitive, kind, loving man. Meryl Streep is her usual great self.The storyline itself, although it's not bad, isn't really profound. While Francesca struggles with whether or not to have an affair, the struggle is brief and she seemingly gives in rather quickly. Much of the remainder of the film shows her and Robert enjoying themselves in what can only be described as a carefree fashion until Francesca must make a decision as to whether to go with Robert or stay with her husband.

88359,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790729369,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 6]","If you want to see an actress make something out of nothing, then see Meryl Streep in this lumbering romance novel of a movie. Based on the ridiculous Robert James Waller bestseller (a book I truly loathed), the 1995 film retains a lot of the novel's unbearable treacle and heaving sentimentality. At the same time, screenwriter Richard LaGravenese's adaptation improves the story immeasurably by shifting more of the focus to Francesca Johnson, an Italian post-WWII bride who has become over the years, a lonely, middle-aged Iowa farmwife circa 1965. Her husband and two children leave for four days to the Illinois State Fair, and by chance, renowned photographer Robert Kincaid accidentally drops by the Johnson farm for directions to the famous Roseman Bridge, one of several covered bridges around Winterset, Iowa. Francesca is fascinated, then smitten, and the two embark on a brief but life-altering love affair.It's fortunate that Clint Eastwood chose to direct this film, as it takes his professional certainty and laconic storytelling style to make this vehicle work. Without sacrificing much of his natural machismo, he's also quite effectively enigmatic as Kincaid, though I think he's at least a decade too old for the part. Whether wringing her hands in anticipation or quietly crying in her mud room, Streep, affecting one of her world-class accents, is at the top of her game yet again. The film's best moments are hers in the rain-soaked scene of inevitability toward the end, when the drama is guided mainly by her mastery of the character's alternating waves of regret and longing. What doesn't work at all is the use of a framing device in having the now-grown Johnson children read their mother's love letters about her romance with Kincaid. It doesn't help that Annie Corley and Victor Slezak play these parts as if they are cast in a sitcom. On the plus side, Jack N. Green's cinematography lovingly captures Iowa's bucolic landscapes. But there is no getting around the slowness of the action, which feels interminable at 135 minutes.

It's a mature, intelligent, thoughtful, real romantic film, and in the end, sad and heartbreaking, but not despairing.  Some have expressed surprise that Eastwood directed this film so well, but I'm not.  Eastwood is a great film artist, one of the greatest working today, and he shows his sensitivity and brilliance in this film.  This film reminds me of how surprised people were that David Lynch directed The Straight Story (a wonderful film in itself and one of the best of 1999).  It's the same principle.  Two artists, Lynch and Eastwood, are simply thwarting expectations and surprising their fans with a sincere, heartfelt movie.  They do it all the time.This film is also very mature and intelligent.  It is not a chick flick where everything is wrapped up in dumb dialogue, dumb characters, and foolish situations.  It is an honest film of two middle aged people who bond almost immediately and really fall in love.  Eastwood and Streep (the Academy didn't nominate either of them) give wonderful performances, especially Streep.  She's also drop dead gorgeous as well.  The film unfolds at a beautiful, leisurely pace (like most Eastwood films).The film also doesn't make any judgements on the lead characters.  Streep's character is married, but she's very unhappy and bored, like many people who have been in a long term marriage.  Eastwood's character is not a playboy, but someone who really reveals himself to Streep, something that's brave to do.  There's also a powerful scene in a diner where another woman, who was caught having an affair and the small town knows about it, walks into a diner and everyone starts looking down on her.  Except Eastwood's character, who offers her a seat next to his.  There is not one ounce of moralising here.  Clint shows people who are simply human, and it's beautiful.The Bridges of Madison County is a story for adults, and considering it was made in 1995 (when idiotic teen comedies were polluting the multiplexes), it's even more of a treasure (I wished I had seen it then, the 90's was a rather poor decade overall for films, especially from Hollywood).  Hollywood should do more adult romances, and not silly, vapid chick flicks.  Chick flicks do more damage to romantics than realistic romance.  I prefer my romances to be more grounded in reality and intelligence because there's just as much beauty there, and it's much more fullfilling than any vapid chick flick can offer.

What happens if for four days you are alone, but not abandoned, and meet a man that reveals to you that there can be some new love in your life even though this life of yours is satisfied, happy, well-balanced and characterized by no particular need nor want, nor even, as for that, wish, except maybe the desire to listen to and enjoy some classical music, some opera singing - and it could be anything at all - which is not appreciated by the other members of the family ? That is rather light as for discontentment or dissatisfaction. A short-lived love affair develops during and over these four days and you are confronted to the need to make a decision. The situation has already been considered by many and in many films. You break off and away and let yourself go with that love affair. Then later on you regret what you have lost in the process. Or you resist and do not yield and you regret all your life what you have not done. In both case you enjoy what you have taken or kept and you are divided between the two sides of your decision : does what I have taken or kept balance what I have rejected, refused or let go ? The film is thus not particularly innovative by its theme. Yet it has a special perfume, fragrance. What is it ? Certainly not the reaction of the children when they learn about it after your death. Their reactions are predictable and even superficial. The special value of this film is in fact in the two actors and the way they embody, with their body acting, the meeting of two potentials, the passion and the end of it, the loss of it and yet the survival of it. Apart from this marvellously well rendered flesh of the film the subject is banal. Meryl Streep particularly transcends her part and takes us into the deepest layers of her mind the way they ripple on her surface, on the surface of her body and behaviour. We feel her disarray at first, her fascination then and her conservative sacrifice last in the most humane and subtle way. We are suffering and rejoicing with her and each side of her situation or decision has its lot of suffering and its lot of rejoicing.

Director/star Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Richard LaGravanese are miracle workers in transforming Robert James Waller's treacly and laughable romantic potboiler into a classic romantic tearjerker about mature people falling in love over a four-day period and making some tough decisions that cost themselves happiness in order to make life better for those around them.""Bridges"" stars the glorious Meryl Streep as Francesca Johnson, an Italian war bride turned unhappy '60's Iowa farm wife, who falls deeply into romantic love with National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) while her husband and teenage children are away for four days at an out-of-state fair.  She must then decide whether or not to abandon her family in order to spend the rest of her days with the love of her life.  The story is really as simple as that, as the true joy of this film is not in surprising and witty plot machinations but in watching two mature and interesting people TALK and RELATE to each other in a realistic manner, something you just don't see in American films any more.Add to the main plot a much-maligned framing device, set in the present-day with Annie Corley and Victor Slezak as Francesca's grown children.  (They're going through their recently-deceased mother's papers and find her diary which contains their mother's story of the affair.)  It adds an extra dimension as the pair are forced to confront the problems in their own marriages by reflecting on their mother's infidelity and sacrifice.  While some viewers evidently find the present-day story to be an unnecessary conceit, I feel it works just fine and leads to a final shot which is hauntingly memorable.Actually, everything in this film is hauntingly memorable, from the amazing Streep's Oscar-nominated performance and Eastwood's nuanced and vanity-free work as Kincaid (Witness the nasty, ageist, and unnecessary comments about Eastwood's nude scenes in some of the previous comments and you'll know what I mean about ""vanity-free""), to Corley's wonderful work as the daughter and Jim Haynie's nearly silent, though equally memorable turn as Francesca's dull, taciturn but unfailingly decent lump of a husband.  Only Slezak overplays his hand as Francesca's son, making him overbearing, unlikeable and unsympathetic.The film is beautifully shot and stunningly edited by Eastwood regulars Jack N. Green and Joel Cox, making the Iowa landscape and the title bridges vital characters in the film.  In fact, Eastwood and company create an indelible sense of time and place; after viewing this film you may actually feel you've been transported to 1960's Winterset, Iowa.  Even Lennie Niehaus' obligatory jazz score works incredibly well, even though I would bet jazz wasn't exactly a radio stalwart in the midwest at that particular time.  In fact, it's a testament to how good the film is that an interlude at a black jazz nightclub doesn't come across as implausible until later, when you may wonder where exactly in Iowa such a place would exist.My only disappointment with ""The Bridges of Madison County"" was that it faired so poorly during awards season. Eastwood, LaGravanese, Green and the film all deserved Oscar nominations, but when the nominations came, only Streep received one.  This in spite of the fact that 1995 was a weak year for Hollywood films, with two authentic classics (""Apollo 13"" and ""Babe"") duking in out with three incredibly overrated pictures (Mel Gibson's eventual Oscar winner ""Braveheart,"" ""Sense and Sensibility"" and the already forgotten Italian treacle ""Il Postino"").  LaGravanese in particular was shamelessly snubbed for Adapted Screenplay, since his adaption was a substantial improvement over the source material while eventual winner Emma Thompson's ""Sense..."" script added little to Jane Austen's masterpiece.  My guess is Waller's original novel was so horrible that the Academy didn't want to be associated with it in spite of the masterful work that went into this adaptation.  Oh, well--So, considering this glowing review, you may wonder why it only ranks a *** rating?  Simple.  I'm rating the DVD, and it is a true disappointment:  the only Eastwood directorial effort not available in a widescreen transfer, which is puzzling considering Warner Home Video has released all other titles in its Eastwood catalog exclusively in widescreen.  My guess is they're waiting for next year's tenth anniversary to release a special edition with making-of features, interviews and widescreen presentation.  One can only hope.  Until then, this print will have to do.  So enjoy, and grab a hanky.

88383,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0790729369,Joseph Haschka,"[164, 170]","This 1995 film, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, and was also produced and directed by the former. If you're used to seeing Clint in his belligerent Dirty Harry or Man With No Name persona, then you're likely to be enormously surprised by his triple triumph in this sensitive film in which nary a shot is fired or punch thrown.The Streep character, Francesca Johnson, was an Italian war bride brought back to Iowa in 1945 by the soldier whose heart she captured. Twenty years later, she lives on a farm with her middle-aged husband and teenage son and daughter. Long since before, she's had to give up her career as a teacher because her spouse, an otherwise gentle and considerate man, doesn't approve of a working wife. She lives, without dreams or passion, a life of quiet desperation. Then along comes the Eastwood character, Robert Kincaid, during a period when Francesca is home alone, the rest of the family off to the State Fair in neighboring Illinois. Kincaid is a photographer for National Geographic, his current assignment to photograph the local covered BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. The divorced Kincaid is the quintessential wanderer, at home wherever in the world he finds himself at the moment, taking his experiences and relationships as they come.During the four days of her family's absence, Francesca falls deeply in love with Robert, and he with her. In him, she rediscovers her dreams of the wider world long denied her in rural Iowa. In her, he discovers the personal and emotional commitment that he professes not to need. When Francesca must choose between Robert and her family, Duty, Responsibility and Loyalty battle with the Heart for the outcome. The scene towards the end of the film in her husband's pick-up truck, wherein Francesca displays wrenching mental turmoil and emotional anguish over a decision that she must make immediately, is, by itself, an Oscar caliber performance by Streep.Is Francesca's decision a tragedy or moral victory? At the moment of her choice, how much of what she was and could have been was irretrievably lost? Perhaps hindsight and reason might provide the answer. But, the heart will never really know, will it? And the mind will play ""what if"" games until time and expectations run out.",5,A triple triumph for Eastwood with no shots fired,975283200,"11 27, 2000",2000,2283,"['1995', 'film', 'BRIDGES', 'OF', 'MADISON', 'COUNTY', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', 'also', 'produced', 'directed', 'former', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Clint', 'belligerent', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'persona', 'then', ""'re"", 'likely', 'be', 'enormously', 'surprised', 'triple', 'triumph', 'sensitive', 'film', 'nary', 'shot', 'fired', 'punch', 'thrown.The', 'Streep', 'character', 'Francesca', 'Johnson', 'was', 'Italian', 'war', 'bride', 'brought', 'back', 'Iowa', '1945', 'soldier', 'heart', 'captured', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'farm', 'middle-aged', 'husband', 'teenage', 'son', 'daughter', 'Long', 'before', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'career', 'teacher', 'spouse', 'otherwise', 'gentle', 'considerate', 'man', ""n't"", 'approve', 'working', 'wife', 'dreams', 'passion', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'Then', 'along', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Robert', 'Kincaid', 'period', 'when', 'Francesca', 'home', 'alone', 'rest', 'family', 'State', 'Fair', 'neighboring', 'Illinois', 'Kincaid', 'photographer', 'National', 'Geographic', 'current', 'assignment', 'photograph', 'local', 'covered', 'BRIDGES', 'OF', 'MADISON', 'COUNTY', 'divorced', 'Kincaid', 'quintessential', 'wanderer', 'home', 'wherever', 'world', 'moment', 'taking', 'experiences', 'relationships', 'come.During', 'four', 'days', 'family', 'absence', 'Francesca', 'deeply', 'love', 'Robert', 'dreams', 'wider', 'world', 'long', 'denied', 'rural', 'Iowa', 'personal', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'not', 'need', 'When', 'Francesca', 'must', 'choose', 'Robert', 'family', 'Duty', 'Responsibility', 'Loyalty', 'battle', 'Heart', 'outcome', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'husband', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'wherein', 'Francesca', 'wrenching', 'mental', 'turmoil', 'emotional', 'anguish', 'decision', 'must', 'make', 'immediately', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'Streep.Is', 'Francesca', 'decision', 'tragedy', 'moral', 'victory', 'moment', 'choice', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'irretrievably', 'lost', 'Perhaps', 'hindsight', 'reason', 'might', 'provide', 'answer', 'heart', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'will', 'mind', 'will', 'play', 'what', 'games', 'time', 'expectations', 'run', 'out']",N/A
88384,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0790729369,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 4]","Clint Eastwood shows a more sensitive side in The Bridges of Madison Country based on the novel by Robert James Waller, Eastwood walks into romantic territory in a love story I enjoyed even more than The Notebook.The bulk of the story is told in flash-back as two adult children read their recently deceased mother's journal detailing her love affair with a National Geographic photographer.Francesca (Meryl Streep) is a bored Italian housewife, whose husband and two children leave home for four days. Within minutes of their departure, she meets Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), on assignment from National Geographic to photograph covered bridges in Iowa. The two are almost immediately drawn in by each other and embark upon a four day love affair.Eastwood proved, once again and not for the last time, that he's one of the best director's Hollywood has no matter what material he's given. Not only that, he broadens his range as an actor here too. It's hard to doubt Eastwood's skill and emotional range as an actor after Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino but he takes a completely different direction with Kincaid. He's very romantic and charming with a big disarming grin.Streep scored her 10th Oscar nod with this film and deservedly so. I've never paid much attention to Streep, but she's wonderful here and completely disappears into her role, flawlessly hitting all the right notes.I can't imagine anyone besides Eastwood and Streep in these roles, they both bring something so vivid to them, it is absolute magic.For me, the weakest (and really sole weak) sections of ""Bridges"" are the scenes involving Francesca's grown children. The acting (especially by the actor playing Michael) is really sub-par.Overall, in my opinion, The Bridges of Madison County is the quintessential American romance story. It's a timeless story that should appeal to a broad audience, young and old. The story is very beautiful, very moving, and packs a whole lot of emotional poignancy. This is required viewing for anyone wanting a love story with both depth and beauty.GRADE: A",5,The Quintessential American Love Story,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,2067,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'more', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'Country', 'based', 'novel', 'Robert', 'James', 'Waller', 'Eastwood', 'romantic', 'territory', 'love', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'Notebook.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'told', 'flash-back', 'two', 'adult', 'children', 'read', 'recently', 'deceased', 'mother', 'journal', 'detailing', 'love', 'affair', 'National', 'Geographic', 'photographer.Francesca', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'bored', 'Italian', 'housewife', 'husband', 'two', 'children', 'leave', 'home', 'four', 'days', 'minutes', 'departure', 'Robert', 'Kincaid', 'Eastwood', 'assignment', 'National', 'Geographic', 'photograph', 'covered', 'bridges', 'Iowa', 'two', 'are', 'almost', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'other', 'embark', 'four', 'day', 'love', 'affair.Eastwood', 'proved', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'last', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'matter', 'what', 'given', 'Not', 'only', 'that', 'range', 'actor', 'here', 'too', 'hard', 'doubt', 'Eastwood', 'skill', 'emotional', 'range', 'actor', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'Kincaid', 'very', 'romantic', 'charming', 'big', 'disarming', 'grin.Streep', 'scored', '10th', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'film', 'deservedly', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'Streep', 'wonderful', 'here', 'completely', 'role', 'flawlessly', 'hitting', 'right', 'notes.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'Eastwood', 'Streep', 'roles', 'bring', 'something', 'so', 'vivid', 'absolute', 'magic.For', 'weakest', 'really', 'sole', 'weak', 'sections', 'Bridges', 'are', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Francesca', 'grown', 'children', 'acting', 'especially', 'actor', 'playing', 'Michael', 'really', 'sub-par.Overall', 'opinion', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'quintessential', 'American', 'romance', 'story', 'timeless', 'story', 'should', 'appeal', 'broad', 'audience', 'young', 'old', 'story', 'very', 'beautiful', 'very', 'moving', 'whole', 'lot', 'emotional', 'poignancy', 'required', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'love', 'story', 'depth', 'beauty.GRADE']",N/A

Bernabo,"[18, 19]","Pretty much everyone on the planet knew years before ""The Bridges of Madison County"" that Meryl Streep could do any accent under the sun and put on an acting clinic. However, the acting revelation in this film is Clint Eastwood, although ironically I have always had the feeling that he is not really acting. I mean, from the Man With No Name to Dirty Harry to William Munny the man has played some of the most hard-bitten characters around. I try to remember the last romantic lead Eastwood played off the top of my head and all that comes to mind is ""Paint Your Wagon."" Yet as photographer Robert Kincaid he is warm, charming, engaging, in other words, pretty much everything I would like to think the real Clint Eastwood is like in the real world. No wonder Francesca falls for him.The story takes place in the summer of 1965, when Francesca's husband and kids are off to the Iowa State Fair. Francesca, an Italian war bride who sometimes misses the old country, is planning on a few days of peace and quite when Robert Kincaid shows up in a pick up truck asking for directions to one of those covered bridges that are all over the place in Madison County. It turns out he is on assignment from the National Geographic magazine to photograph them and when Francesca agrees to help it is the quiet beginning to a four-day romance of epic proportions. There is a framing device for the tale, which takes place after Francesca has died, in which Francesca's children find her journal and read for the first time of the secret affair their mother enjoyed, but for the most part this just gets in the way. Certainly the knowledge of how this affair will end impacts our level of emotional involvement with the two lovers.Admittedly, this is one of the great hit or miss romance films of our generation. It will either click for you or it will not. But I think you have to check it out at least once just to catch a glimpse of the ""real"" Eastwood. Note: If you get a change, check out the audio-tape version of the novel, which is narrated by author Robert James Waller with the dialogue for the two leads done by Ben Kinsley and Isabelli Rossalini. You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Most Romantic Lines: (1) ""This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime."" (2) ""I don't want to need you, because I can't have you.""Tear-Jerk Scenes: (1) Two pick-up trucks stopped at a red light at the one interesection in town.If you like ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #1 ""Casablanca.""

But this movie was wonderful from the beginning.  Eastwood plays the part of a quiet, introspective and fun-loving rover.  Streep plays the part of an Italian immigrant, farmer's wife and dedicated mother who is clearly homesick for something she's never had.  Neither is terribly young, but they show you can be 16 anytime you want - it just costs so much more when you're older.Their passion for each other stutters at first, then explodes - only to be ripped apart at the peak of its adolescent ardor, before it can truly mature.  But it's a good story, and the theme, although pretty ordinary but nice as romances go, is made much more powerful because it changes both their lives and endures in a way that it never could, had they been free to continue.  An eye-dimming tale for those who have experienced distant affairs of the heart and mind - the rest won't get it.",5,You can be 16 anytime you want,1032480000,"09 20, 2002",2002,1014,"['other', 'reviews', 'have', 'largely', 'already', 'pegged', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'youth', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'pressed', 'stay', 'awake', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'beginning', 'Eastwood', 'part', 'quiet', 'introspective', 'fun-loving', 'rover', 'Streep', 'part', 'Italian', 'immigrant', 'farmer', 'wife', 'dedicated', 'mother', 'who', 'clearly', 'homesick', 'something', 'never', 'had', 'terribly', 'young', 'show', 'can', 'be', '16', 'anytime', 'want', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'when', ""'re"", 'older.Their', 'passion', 'other', 'stutters', 'first', 'then', 'only', 'be', 'ripped', 'apart', 'peak', 'adolescent', 'ardor', 'can', 'truly', 'mature', 'good', 'story', 'theme', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'nice', 'romances', 'go', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'lives', 'endures', 'way', 'never', 'could', 'had', 'been', 'free', 'continue', 'eye-dimming', 'tale', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'distant', 'affairs', 'heart', 'mind', 'rest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A

His performance was achingly real and very intimate. This is definately a romance, not a romantic comedy but a full-blown romance, with great actors. The love scenes just seem so honest and poignant. I usually do not feel as tuned in to key romantic scenes with older people, it is usually more with your Brad Pitt type or younger adults, but this movie wipes them all away. The scenes sizzle, and I mean sizzle! The ending is very intense and can bring up some strong emotion for those of us out there who are sensitive! The bridges are beautiful and have prompted many to visit them. I don't rate many movies a 5 star, so be prepared for a good film! Warning, some may not be so entranced with it because it is an intimate sensual experience as opposed to high action and suspense.

88396,A129YBX5BVNW2,0790729369,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","It's 1985 in Iowa - and Michael and Carolyn Johnson turn off a bumpy road - their modern-day Estate Car heading into the small farm residence of Mr and Mrs Richard Johnson. Inside their childhood home a local lawyer reads out the details of their Italian mother's will - specifically instructions about her burial that leaves both of them utterly flabbergasted. The normally meek and mild-mannered Francesca Johnson wants to be cremated - and have her ashes thrown off the Roseman Bridge in Madison County. ""I'm not at all sure it's even Christian!"" a profoundly rattled Michael protests.But there's worse. Opening an envelope - they find a key to a large chest in their mother's bedroom that contains stuff they've never seen - let alone suspected. Dark horse Francesca (Meryl Streep) has had a secret past life - in fact a lifelong torch for someone else other than Richard Johnson - their father who has himself passed in 1982 (played to understated loving perfection by Jim Haynie). It transpires that Francesca had a passionate four-day love affair in the mid Sixties with a photographer from the National Geographic magazine called Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) while her husband and 17 and 16-year old teenagers were away at the Illinois State Fair exhibiting a prize steer. It is Robert Kincaid she wants to give ""the rest of me"" to.Now in their mid 40's - both shaken siblings (played with aching delicacy by Victor Slezak and Annie Corley) get out a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey and brace themselves - as they collectively read three handwritten diaries their mother has poured her innermost thoughts and passions into. ""What becomes important is 'to be known'..."" - she writes. And they slowly but painfully learn why...We're back in 1965 and a 45-year old Francesca Johnson is beating a dusty rug on her farmstead porch when a pick-up from Bellingham in Washington DC comes trundling towards the house. Out steps a rugged world-travelled man in his early Sixties who is temporarily lost and needs directions to the Roseman Bridge - an assignment he's been sent to photograph (the camera is his chosen art). The beautiful wooden-canopied gap between two separate roads is only two miles from her home - Francesca nervously advises. Robert then smiles in return as she fumbles spoken directions - clearly excited by a handsome male presence. But it's more than that. There is an undercurrent - a meeting of like minds that seem to have been travelling towards each other for decades - an instant spark  - an understanding between them. And so her secret love story begins...Streep received a 10th Oscar nomination for her work here and perhaps she should have won (yet again). The character dance between her and Eastwood is simply stupendous - giving her frumpy but sensuous Italian woman nervous twitches, all hands on her face and arms, eyes running over his body, catching glimpses of him through gaps in the wood and net curtains, fanning her naked body at night in the cool breeze to calm her thoughts down. Sometimes the talks they have in the kitchen are so good that you feel your eavesdropping on an actual conversation in motion. And when the harsh reality of what they're doing kicks in - the 'morning after sequence' doesn't shirk it either. She riles at him angrily - feeling used - just another notch on his well-travelled gun. Yet the scene manages to be tender, hurting and utterly believable too.Adapted from Robert James Waller's beloved novel - the screenplay for 1995's ""Bridges"" by Richard La Gravenese is a masterpiece of understatement and lightness of touch. Combined with Clint Eastwood's keep-it-simple Direction and an amazing on-screen chemistry between two great actors at the top of their game - this is also a movie of rare depth - one that speaks to the Soul on several levels. On the one hand you have the grown-up son and daughter grappling with parental loss - both in marriages that have seen better days (hers in terminal decline). The other theme is the longing for real love - and to have actually lived rather than just coasted through life. Both ooze out of so many scenes - imbibing the film with a truth that is often uncomfortable and sad - yet somehow hopeful. It's a gushingly romantic tale really - a Brief Encounter with an American twist.I'm thrilled to say that Warner Brothers have put up a fabulous print. The Region Free American BLU RAY is GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT and at times shockingly so. It's defaulted to Full Screen Aspect (so you miss nothing). Principal in all this cinematic glory is Jack Green's sumptuous cinematography and the lighting he catches in Iowa - warm evenings - the daytime air filled with dust and butterflies and pollen particles on the wind - it's just beautiful to look at. Examples are the scene where Robert surprises Francesca on the bridge with blue flowers he's just picked - when they walk in the evening talking about the poetry of W.B. Yeats - when they discuss life at the kitchen table and how she came from the small town of Bari in Southern Italy to Iowa with her Military husband Richard to a life full of dreams not quite realized. Even when her family sits at the dinner table virtually ignoring her cooking and maternal efforts - the textures of their clothes and rural furniture details are absolutely spot on.Special mention should also go to Eastwood's piano theme ""Doe Eyes"" that is so exquisitely elegant and moving. It takes a full half-hour to arrive (the first Bridge scene when they get physically close to each other) - but each time it does - it grows and grows in stature - until it has the power of a hammerblow. It's most effective in the penultimate scene towards the end when it's pouring rain and Francesca gets into her husband's truck only to see Robert in his pickup parked opposite on the street (he's come back for her). He exits - stands there exposed and soaked - hoping she'll leave her good husband and family for him - but knows it's a decision that she alone must make. For a moment - Francesca grabs the door handle of her own truck when she sees her name pendant hanging from his rear-view mirror calling her home. The 'will she/won't she' go with him moment of agony lingers. But she crushes down her feelings of longing and love - settling for what has to be done. She must stay with her husband and family who will be `broken in half' if she actually acts on such a delicious but destructive impulse. It's a heartbreakingly beautiful scene - and I can assure you - there isn't going to be a dry eye in any home anywhere when it's watched (keep the Kleenex handy).The BLU RAY also carries over the DVD Commentary and Making Of called ""An Old Fashioned Love Story..."" that has interviews with DOP Jack Green, Writer Richard La Gravenese, Producer Kathleen Kennedy, Editor Joel Cox, Actors Eastwood, Streep, Slezak, Corley and Haynie and features location footage of Winterset in Ohio where it was shot. Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio: English 5.1, Dolby Digital, French 5.1, Spanish 5.1 (Castilian) and Spanish 2.0 (Latin) - while Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.Why is this movie so effecting? The lifetime our parents have given us - the debt we can't repay them - the love we can't have - the passion we didn't grab when we had the chance? I don't know if I want the answer.""This kind of certainty comes along but once in a lifetime..."" - Robert tells Francesca in a moment of clarity that will stay with them until their ashes are scattered to the four winds.Well now you can savour its magic over and over again on BLU RAY. ""The Bridges Of Madison County"" is that kind of cinematic masterpiece.PS: I dedicate this review to my wife Mary Ann and our three kids - Dean, Julia and Sean who saw me through a recent heart

88397,ABCE4OXCDHEQL,0790729369,Mark Blackburn,"[56, 63]","Last night my wife and I watched this movie in ""HI-DEFINITION"" for the first time. Such glorious cinematography -- the countryside around the bridges of Madison county. ""Beautiful music,"" said my wife.  ""I think Clint wrote it,"" I said.Two nights earlier we had watched Clint Eastwood parry gracefully  (that ""ah shucks"" style of his) with David Letterman, who asked him his age.""I'm 78,"" said Clint.""Now, I look 78!"" said Letterman, only half-jokingly, ""YOU look about 58!"" The simple truth: Clint looks (to our eyes) as young as he did playing ""Robert Kincaid, photographer"" to Meryl Streep's ""Francesca Johnson"" Iowa farm wife, in this wonderful film, now 14 years old (1995).So I came here in search of a 2-Disc ""Special Edition"" and -- lo and behold!For those of us who love this movie, it seems incredible that ""Bridges"" didn't win a single award (though Meryl Streep was nominated for the ""Best Actress"" Oscar). This understated gem, masterfully directed by Clint Eastwood, remains my favorite of his films . . . actually affording Clint the vehicle for his very best acting; elicited, perhaps, by rising to the occasion -- having to 'act upwards' in the presence of the greatest actor/actress -- and deservedly the ""most-nominated."" (Did they say Meryl now had ""15 nominations"" when singing her praises at the Oscars, a week ago?)-----The subtleties of Meryl's reading of  an Italian-born mid-westerner ""Francesca Johnson""  grow ever-more-poignant, as the movie nears its end. We share her `heart-torn-in-two' agony at that moment, in the pouring rain, when her lover's battered, old green (59 GMC) half-ton is stopped ahead of them, at the light, directly in front of their red, (58 Chev) pickup truck.As if sending one final signal to the ""love that comes but once"" to their lives -- one last, unspoken urging to ""run away with me NOW!"" . . . we share Francesca's view as Robert reaches into the glove compartment, then drapes that silver crucifix & chain on his rear view mirror.Francesca inches her hand to the door handle, preparing to bolt and join her `one true love'  . . .  fatally delaying her move to the last possible moment. Her husband, noting the license plate on the truck ahead of him says, ""That fella's far from home - Washington State! Must be that photographer everyone's been talking about.""Francesca's hand actually moves the door handle slightly. Her husband tentatively honks his horn because the light is green and asks, quietly, `Why is he not moving?' Soon the  truck ahead turns left, the driver's rain-soaked hair evident through his still rolled-down, window.They drive forward, Francesca looking back with such longing -- one last glimpse of Robert's truck as it disappears into the rain; then . . . the flood of tears.""What's wrong?"" asks her husband, as if he's never seen her cry like this - his dark eyes wary, with alarm.""I need a minute,"" is all she can muster up, covering her face with her hands, dissolving in tears.-----In the final scenes - and the very last one in which we get to see the gentle aging face of Francesca -- she gently, lovingly removes the contents of a box that has just been delivered to her farmhouse --- from the lawyer for Kincaid's estate.She's inherited his early model Nikon camera, which she recognizes, and quickly sets aside, along with the silver crucifix and chain, before picking up a small red picture book with a dying sunset on its cover; it is the fruit of their few, joyful days together, and titled appropriately ""Four Days by Robert Kincaid.""Francesca's lovely old hands open the book to the first printed page, inscribed to her ""FOR F""  -- below it, an introductory snippet of poetry, ""by Byron"" Inserted at that page, is a many-times-folded and yellowing note - the one she hand-wrote, after feeding him a home-cooked meal:""If you'd like supper again`When white moths are on the wing'Come by tonight after you're finished.Anytime is fine.""Beneath the printed page's inscription, ""FOR F,"" is the poem by Byron. (I always mean to jot it down; this time I did!)""There is a pleasure in the pathless woodsThere is a rapture on the lonely shoreThere is society where none intrudeBy the deep sea, and music is to roar . . .I love not Man the less, but Nature more.From these our interviews, in which I stealFrom all I have been beforeTo mingle with the universe and feel . . .What I can n'ere expressYet cannot all conceal.""NOTE for those who care about such things: the achingly-beautiful `love theme' heard throughout this movie (the orchestrations are so evocative) surges up finally, as Francesca appreciates for the first time the book about their Four Days. (Bet ""there wasn't a dry eye"" at this movie's premiere showing!)That memorable theme music vividly reminds us of Clint Eastwood's strengths as a musician: He co-wrote this one, calling it ""Doe Eyes"" -- ""Love Theme from The Bridges of Madison County."" (His co-composer was Lennie Niehaus.)Such subtleties didn't come up during Clint's interview with David Letterman. And, perhaps at this late juncture, most of us don't care to watch the credits to their end to learn such things.Clint Eastwood would be the first to admit, as an actor he is not in Meryl Streep's league  (who is?) But in their last scene together, at the supper table, the evening before her husband and son & daughter return with a blue ribbon from the `state fair,' Clint's character `delivers' in his powerless attempt to pursuade ""Francesca"" to run away with him.Their characters so needy for each other - the ache is palpable! Each time I watch that moment in this understated gem of a film -- the best `twin-soliloquy' of its kind, I say - our hearts ache for two wonderful, decent human beings who must tear themselves apart. Strangers only days earlier, now they have no real choice but to let go, turn away and 'no looking back.' Yes, the finest film never to have won an award!Mark BlackburnWinnipeg Manitoba Canada",5,Best Film never to have won an award,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,5940,"['Last', 'night', 'wife', 'watched',

Streep and Eastwood are good, as always, even with a lame, foolish, and trite story.  The story is just plain ridiculous.  I'll take a guess that the author of the book, Waller, must've had some sort of fling of his own to base it on.  Dressed up a sordid little affair and made a lot of money off it.  Go James Waller.  Francesca (Streep) is a bored and disappointed housewife.  Doesn't seem like she does much to liven up her own life, tho, except to be unfaithful first chance she gets.  While her faithful and rather good looking husband and their two children are at the county fair, Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) meets Francesca and they have a brief affair.  The funny part is that anyone over 40 whose had any kind of a life knows that the ""thing they have that few experience"" is something that is as available as the air.  This was a really seedy story.  At the end, when Kincaid walks across the street in the pouring rain and gazes at Francesca who is in her truck waiting for her faithful husband to return, well, if I had been in her place, I would've rolled up the window.  I couldn't help but think, as quick as Kincaid was to get into Francesca's-- life -- so to speak, he must be pretty easy in other places and with other women and if I was in Francesca's shoes, I'd have been worried that I may have contracted a little ""bug"" that I could pass on to my husband.  Wow.  Wouldn't that make this lovely romance nice?  The two children when they grow up and read their mother's diaries that spill the beans seem like a couple of pretty naive jerks.  The settings were pretty, and the farm house was decorated very 1960's.  Streep looks pretty but Eastwood's neck was pretty wrinkly in the kissing scenes.  Well, we all get old!

There are very few scenes in the movies that are as effective as Streep in her husband's old pick-up truck her hand sqeezing the door handle, tears running down her cheeks, rain pouring down outside wondering whether she should make a run for it into Robert's rain drenched arms.

Meryl's hand on the door of her husband's truck while trying to decide whether to run off with Clint Eastwood is one of those moments that only an actress like Streep could pull off so convincingly.Streep and Eastwood pair well, and they have some powerful scenes, some without dialogue.  The addition of the modern day segment featuring Streep's grown children could have been left out, but Annie Corley did a nice job; Victor Slezak was so-so.  Jim Haynie in his brief role as Meryl's husband is a sharp contrast to the outgoing, masculine Clint.  As he has shown in such powerful movies as MYSTIC RIVER and UNFORGIVEN, Clint has become a director of incredible vision and sensibility.

The two have a 4-day affair that is supposed have you pull out your hankerchiefs and sob your eyes out. I was trying to keep my eyes open!I never was a fan of love stories, and this movie also tries to send a message that true love only happens once in a lifetime, and it doesn't involve marriage. I don't like the fact that this movie portrays an affair as being more sacred then marriage. I can understand that Franchesca was bored and needed a change, but don't you think she went a little too far?The movie drags, REALLY drags! The opening sequence with her children going through her personal files is so slow that you keep forgetting why you are watching this movie. Most of the scenes are long and very tiring. The rest of the movie yields much of the same, and only the change between scenes keeps you from dosing off. I have been to Iowa, and I agree that the scenery is nice and peaceful, but maybe too peaceful.Clint Eastwood does fill in a good role as Kincaid, and I can understand if he was trying to open up to a new audience, that being women.

This very slow and in places dull film about a chance meeting between a National Geographic photographer with an intimacy complex and a bored, unsatisfied housweife redeems itself considerably with the scene where Robert (Eastwood) stands in the rain waiting for Francesca (Streep) and then waits for her in the lorry.  It was dealt with all the intensity and intrigue necessary for that scene to work and paid dividends but the rest of the film does take a while to get into and I got the distinct feeling that this was really a re-working of Casablanca than a film in it's own right.  Also, I didn't find the film made it quite clear exactly why those two people got it together it just sort of put it on a plate and expected us to get it.Eastwood, however, gives an interesting and convincing performance which makes a pleasant change from his normally, very wooden action films.

After reading the book, I thought they were wrong for the characters.  It turns out I was wrong!  They work  together remarkably well!  Their romance is one of my favorites in all of  film.  Streep is just phenominal again!  When will the AFI give her a life  achievement award?  Eastwood shows quite a range here and he is completely  real as the photographer.  Eastwood's direction is really fantastic here as  the movie paints a beautiful picture.  The final sequence with Streep in  the truck is as good as it gets.  If you don't feel her pain, I mean really  empathize with her dilemma, then perhaps romantic films aren't your thing.  The way that scene is filmed will stick with me for a long time.  The only  negative is the casting of the brother and sister looking through Streep's  life.  When they're in a scene it's so flat and then the movie goes back in  time and the film is remarkable again.  Don't be warned off because you  think this one glorifies extramarital affairs.  It doesn't!  The woman and  man do the right thing in the long run.  As the old lady says in Titanic  (paraphrase)...a woman's heart holds many secrets..  This secret is about a  chance encounter that would help define the main characters very being...  in life and in death.

88413,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,0790729369,Muzzlehatch,"[4, 4]","Closeup on a mailbox: Mr. and Mrs. Richard Johnson. Behind it, a dusty road leading through green fields, a minivan coming towards the camera and a pan over towards an isolated farmhouse. It's the present, and Michael and Carolyn have come to settle some issues regarding their mother's estate. It seems that their mother wanted her ashes scattered from a nearby covered bridge, which startles her two grown kids, particularly the seemingly very conservative and religious Michael. Turns out that Francesca had her reasons, as they find out when they open her cedar chest and turn to the diaries contained within...Late summer 1965, and Francesca, an Iowa housewife in her mid-40s is seeing her husband and kids off to the Illinois State Fair. They'll be gone for 5 days and she'll have little to do but be bored in a different way than she usually is, until the arrival the next morning of a lost National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Kincaid is on assignment to photograph the covered bridges that the county is famed for, and Francesca tries to tell him the way to the Roseman bridge but quickly decides to show him the way personally instead. As they drive towards the bridge and make small talk, they seem uneasy at first - but when Robert mentions Francesca's accent, and she finds that he has visited the town where she grew up in Italy, something starts to click. He reaches for a cigarette from the glove compartment and brushes her leg...later he picks flowers for her....they have the same favorite radio station, playing blues and jazz. Francesca starts to see something special, exotic....Robert sees someone warm and real, centered but more than the simple housewife that she's let herself become.So begins four days of falling in love, four days of uncertainty, secretive glances, shyness turning to boldness, feelings long-buried in both reawakened and examined by two people smart enough to know right away how problematic an affair can be, yet willing to cast aside the doubts and damn the consequences. For now. The brilliance of The Bridges of Madison County isn't in any kind of originality, and it isn't in the bits of Waller's strained prose that occasionally leech through LaGravenese's generally excellent screenplay; it isn't in Streep's accent, which I know some have problems with but which I barely even notice at this point; and it isn't in the framing story, which again has grown on me over time but is certainly not all that interesting itself. What makes the film magical is the chemistry, the feeling of absolute rightness between the two leads, and the slow building towards an inevitable yet still heartbreaking decision.Clint Eastwood certainly must have seemed an odd choice to take on this film, which he co-produced and co-wrote the elegiac ""Doe Eyes"" theme for in addition to directing and starring - even to me, a big fan already at the time, it seemed odd. Robert Redford seemed to be everybody's idea of Kincaid, and Steven Spielberg got mentioned often as a possible director, but I doubt many people will have problems after they see the film. Eastwood's Robert is a sensitive guy, but he's not schmaltzy, a poetic man but not pretentious about it, and a man clearly as unsure about the concept of love and the kind of risk he puts himself into as the married Francesca. He's a traveler and a loner, but deep down there's something missing, something we can feel almost from the beginning, something seen in the long gaze out the window near the end, and as he stands in the rain, waiting and hoping, at the film's emotional climax. And Eastwood the director keeps things from getting out of hand sentimentally until the last half hour, when both he and the audience know it's time for the tears to flow.But as good as Clint is - and this is surely one of his two or three best performances - Meryl Streep is just a marvel here. Overlook the accent - whether you like it or not, it really isn't terribly important here - and you see a less mannered, more natural performance than she's given anywhere else. She mentions a couple of times in the making-of piece that accompanies the film on DVD that she was uncertain at first of Eastwood's quick shooting style, but it does wonders for her, giving a spontaneity that she really needed for the role. So much of the film relies on us believing that these are two hesitant, uncertain people with a yearning that at first has no direction - it can't seem studied, and it doesn't. And for a film that is set mostly in a kitchen and around barn-like red covered bridges, there's an excitement and intensity that can't be matched in most romances shot under the Eiffel Tower or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. The technical aspects - Jack N. Green's lovely September-October photography and the wonderful Eastwood-chosen musical mixture of Johnny Hartman and Dinah Washington, among others - are just about perfect as well.What the film ultimately builds to - and much of it is on Streep's shoulders - is a powerful examination of regret and loss and a determination that there are no perfect choices in life, only choices that involve different kinds of sacrifices. The film doesn't comment on the rightness or wrongness of her adultery, but Francesca lets her kids know that whatever she's done, she's not going to beat herself up over it - and neither should they. At the end, we know that whatever choice she made would have been difficult, would have involved hurting herself and others; there's no easy answer, only a bit of hope for the next generation, as they at least have come to accept and understand, and Francesca's ashes scatter on the wind....NOTE ON THE DVD: The transfer on this 2008 ""special edition"" DVD is very nice and the aspect ratio correct - really essential to this tightly-shot film.  Good if a little over-effusive commentary by cinematographer Jack Green and editor Joel Cox and a nice little making-of featurette.",5,Once in every life....someone comes along,1252195200,"09 6,

88421,A2827AJBAGWOCR,0790729369,pastre,"[6, 6]","From the much maligned novel of Robert James Waller, Eastwood has woven a wonderful piece of cinema rich in subtle emotions, quietly moving and ultimately uplifting.Set in 1965, Iowa, the story concerned the married Francesca (Streep) and travelling photographer Robert (Eastwood), who met briefly for four days, moved from attraction to flirtation, love then ultimately passion. The film has a strange European flavour to it, with Eastwood unhurriedly developing his characters using silence and subtlety that proved very effective. Bridges is a very moving film.In a wise move, director Eastwood focused the story on Francesca's point of view. Though voice-overs are usually frowned upon by critics, Streep does it sparingly and unintrusively. Her character is the more important one, a woman with worldly wisdom, somebody who has forgotten that time hasn't dissipate her natural elegance and grace. I take my hat off to Eastwood as director but I'm not sure as an actor. He looked too old and unattractive , one would beg the question if Francesca would really fall in love with this man for four days. Whilst Streep delivered her dialogue perfectly, Eastwood  sounded too studied and quivery. Though the chemistry is present, perhaps the film would be better if Eastwood did not wear too many hats.In fact, if he did not direct himself at all.However, I was impressed with the music he co-wrote. It perfectly captured the mood of the film.The centerpiece of this film rested solely on the shoulders of Meryl Streep whose performance is both heartbreaking and unforgettable. She inhabited the body of Francesca effortlessly. Without her, this film would not succeed. Her performance is so beautiful. Streep is technically perfect, there isn't a flaw in her performance. All actresses at present dwindle in comparison to this woman's talent. I believe in the history of films, only two burned the brightest with true talent and artistry. Bette Davis and Meryl Streep.Mostly moving are the quiet moments that didn't need words to be uttered. Scene in the beginning of the film where she was watching her family in the dining table then looked away.Inside the bridge when Robert caught her looking at him.

I cannot express how much this movie touched my inner being. And by the end I felt a powerful emotion I had not felt in a long time. I felt a deep passionate feeling of longing and hope once again after nearly 12 years. My heart had been broken so many times that I felt I could never love again, or feel it again. But after viewing The Bridges of Madison County I was so moved that I cried for more than 15 minutes through the end of the film and afterward. I felt those feelings of longing, hope, and pain once again- and it hurt deeply, but it also made me feel alive again. This story is so moving and beautiful it is impossible to describe in a short review. But putting it plainly, this story is about a chance encounter between two people who find a love so powerful that even the union of marriage and prior commitments cannot snuff it out. It is a love that happens only once in a lifetime. The kind of love that is so rare and beautiful that few will ever experience it. Clint Eastwood has created a breathtaking masterpiece in this film, and this story is so moving that it truly is one of the greatest love stories ever told.

88434,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,0790729369,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[3, 3]","Meryl Streep received her first Academy Award nomination for the stunning war drama ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978). The following year, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Dustin Hoffman's wife, Joanna, in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"". She earned the Best Actress Award for ""Sophie's Choice"" (1982), and was nominated for another Oscar for her outstanding performance as real-life Karen Silkwood... In all, she has received 13 Academy Award nominations, the most recent for her supporting role opposite Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper in the fascinating film 'Adaptation.'In 'The Bridges of Madison County,' Streep stars as Francesca, a conventional wife of an Iowa farmer... Francesca cares for her family with all her heart, as she has done for years... She describes herself as ""happily married,"" but nevertheless falls easily into a chaste but tender affair with a charismatic wandering photographer on assignment for National Geographic magazine in the fall of 1965...Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) stops at Francesca's farm to ask for directions... While close-ups provide Streep's intimate thoughts, some women lost patience with her indecision and reticence...Francesca, although nervous by the attention of the courteous visitor, but guilty about being unfaithful to her passionless Iowa husband, finds out a mystical attraction for the top photographer who has come to Madison County to take pictures of the local covered bridges... Francesca was at home, alone, her husband and two children having gone for four days to the Illinois state fair...Francesca and Robert talk about their lives and their old dreams, and as their relationship grows, they both find themselves drawn to each other, falling deeply and immediately in love... Their true love strikes at the heart of everyone... 'In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once.'The suffocating rain sequence has to go down as one of the most poignant in cinematic history, beautifully complemented by a soundtrack resonating with a melancholic piece of blues and piano...Every performance in the movie is backed up by a truthful, believable script full of real, everyday people... The poignancy of each moment is underscored by an unforgettable choice of romantic melodies...The motion picture, nominated for the C&eacute;sar Awards in France, is another example of Eastwood's exceptional style as both a filmmaker and as an actor...As a filmmaker, Eastwood proves his comprehension of the secret of romance novels, showing sensuously, and sensitively the way people feel and think when they are really in love... As an actor, he is very convincing as the loner with much to share... Although his travels have taken him far across the 'other side of the world,' he still looks cleverly back on his life...His film gives us the passion between two lovers, but also life's compromises and regrets... It is a realistic portrait of a man and a woman who love the memories they share... It is a sensitive exploration of feelings which grows into something neither one can get free... It is an invitation to consider what might have been missed or lost in our life...Meryl Streep is heartbreaking as a lonely woman surrounded by family... We truly feel her pain and desperation... She fights with all the love, hope, frustration and responsibility... She is someone whose dreams of coming to America have not been fulfilled by the tedious reality of her life in Winterset, Iowa... Her busy life is filled with details but has nothing that truly excites her anymore... She is forever altered by a chance encounter.. Her emotional range is enormous and her laughter is as charged with energy as her tears... But you never doubt the truth of what she's feeling...As the pair reveal their own lives through each other, a connection is made, and in just four fateful days, they find one another and commit themselves to each other for a lifetime even though they remain apart...We all dream of the chance meeting, that particular time when we really feel we are enjoying life... But love never obey our expectations... Robert and Francesca, couldn't stay together physically, but their love was so strong that lasted forever as Francesca grew old on the farm and Robert traveled the world... Women love romanticism and never seem to get enough... And true love is possible, even in the scope of a life of compromise, and in the middle of nowhere, on the far side of any age...",4,"True love is possible, even in the scope of a life of compromise, and in the middle of nowhere, on the far side of any age...",1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,4478,"['Meryl', 'Streep', 'received', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'stunning', 'war', 'drama', 'Deer', 'Hunter', '1978', 'following', 'year', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'performance', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'wife', 'Joanna', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'earned', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'Sophie', 'Choice', '1982', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'real-life', 'Karen', 'Silkwood', 'received', '13', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'most', 'recent', 'supporting', 'role', 'opposite', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'fascinating', 'film', ""'Adaptation"", ""'The"", 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'Streep', 'stars', 'Francesca', 'conventional', 'wife', 'Iowa', 'farmer', 'Francesca', 'family', 'heart', 'done', 'years', 'happily', 'married', 'nevertheless', 'easily', 'chaste', 'tender', 'affair', 'charismatic', 'wandering', 'photographer', 'assignment', 'National', 'Geographic', 'magazine', 'fall', '1965', 'Robert', 'Kincaid', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Francesca', 'farm', 'ask', 'directions', 'close-ups', 'provide', 'Streep', 'intimate', 'thoughts', 'women', 'lost', 'patience', 'indecision', 'reticence', 'Francesca', 'nervous', 'attention', 'courteous', 'visitor', 'guilty', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'passionless', 'Iowa', 'husband', 'out', 'mystical', 'attraction', 'top', 'photographer', 'who', 'come', 'Madison', 'County', 'take', 'pictures', 'local', 'covered', 'bridges', 'Francesca', 'was', 'home', 'alone', 'husband', 'two', 'children', 'having', 'gone', 'four', 'days', 'Illinois', 'state', 'fair', 'Francesca', 'Robert', 'talk', 'lives', 'old', 'dreams', 'relationship', 'grows', 'find', 'drawn', 'other', 'falling', 'deeply', 'immediately', 'love', 'true', 'love', 'strikes', 'heart', 'everyone', 'universe', 'ambiguity', 'kind', 'certainty', 'only', 'once', ""'The"", 'suffocating', 'rain', 'sequence', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'cinematic', 'history', 'beautifully', 'complemented', 'soundtrack', 'resonating', 'melancholic', 'piece', 'blues', 'piano', 'performance', 'movie', 'backed', 'up', 'truthful', 'believable', 'script', 'full', 'real', 'everyday', 'people', 'poignancy', 'moment', 'underscored', 'unforgettable', 'choice', 'romantic', 'melodies', 'motion', 'picture', 'nominated', 'C', 'eacute', 'sar', 'Awards', 'France', 'example', 'Eastwood', 'exceptional', 'style', 'filmmaker', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'Eastwood', 'comprehension', 'secret', 'romance', 'novels', 'showing', 'sensuously', 'sensitively', 'way', 'people', 'feel', 'think', 'when', 'are', 'really', 'love', 'actor', 'very', 'convincing', 'loner', 'much', 'share', 'travels', 'have', 'taken', 'far', ""'other"", 'side', 'world', 'still', 'cleverly', 'back', 'life', 'film', 'passion', 'two', 'lovers', 'also', 'life', 'compromises', 'regrets', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'memories', 'share', 'sensitive', 'exploration', 'feelings', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'free', 'invitation', 'consider', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'missed', 'lost', 'life', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'heartbreaking', 'lonely', 'woman', 'surrounded', 'family', 'truly', 'feel', 'pain', 'desperation', 'love', 'hope', 'frustration', 'responsibility', 'someone', 'dreams', 'coming', 'America', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'fulfilled', 'tedious', 'reality', 'life', 'Winterset', 'Iowa', 'busy', 'life', 'filled', 'details', 'nothing', 'truly', 'anymore', 'forever', 'altered', 'chance', 'Her', 'emotional', 'range', 'enormous', 'laughter', 'charged', 'energy', 'tears', 'never', 'doubt', 'truth', 'what', 'feeling', 'pair', 'reveal', 'own', 'lives', 'other', 'connection', 'made', 'just', 'four', 'fateful', 'days', 'find', 'one', 'commit', 'other', 'lifetime', 'even', 'remain', 'apart', 'dream', 'chance', 'meeting', 'particular', 'time', 'when', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'enjoying', 'life', 'love', 'never', 'expectations', 'Robert', 'Francesca', 'could', ""n't"", 'stay', 'together', 'physically', 'love', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'lasted', 'forever', 'Francesca', 'grew', 'old', 'farm', 'Robert', 'traveled', 'world', 'Women', 'love', 'romanticism', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'enough', 'true', 'love', 'possible', 'even', 'scope', 'life', 'compromise', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'far', 'side', 'age']",N/A

Jones,"[0, 0]","Clint Eastwood is my favorite actor and one of my favorite directors, and I certainly recognize Meryl Streep for the excellent actress that she is.  That being said, I wouldn't have chosen either of them to star in this movie.  Streep's Francesca comes off as frustrated and grumpy, with an overdone Italian accent that - after living in Iowa for 20 years - sounds like she just got off the boat.  It was hard for me to find her very appealing and to believe that Clint Eastwood's character had genuine feelings for her.  The screenplay veered off from the book in making her a stronger and more independent woman, rather than the naive, swept-off-her-feet farm wife she was in the novel.  This decision was a correct one, but Streep carries it a bit too far.  Likewise, there's a problem for me with Clint Eastwood as the romantic lead, which is that...well, he's Clint Eastwood.  He plays the part with earnestness but it's hard to keep in mind that he's in town to photograph covered bridges, not to track down some killer.This criticism aside, Eastwood did not do a bad job translating this story to the screen, and was able to improve upon the book in a number of ways.  The film is nicely photographed on location and does manage to preserve the tiny universe that these characters inhabit for the brief timeline of the story.Watch for a great tracking shot near the end of the film as Streep's character runs out of the house after a departing Eastwood.  That and the later scene in the rain (which was not in the book) work wonderfully well.I would have casted it differently but it's a good movie.",4,Oddly Cast but Enjoyable,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,1606,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'favorite', 'actor', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'certainly', 'recognize', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'excellent', 'actress', 'being', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'chosen', 'star', 'movie', 'Streep', 'Francesca', 'off', 'frustrated', 'grumpy', 'overdone', 'Italian', 'accent', 'living', 'Iowa', '20', 'years', 'just', 'got', 'off', 'boat', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'very', 'appealing', 'believe', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'had', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'screenplay', 'veered', 'off', 'book', 'making', 'stronger', 'more', 'independent', 'woman', 'rather', 'naive', 'swept-off-her-feet', 'farm', 'wife', 'was', 'novel', 'decision', 'was', 'correct', 'one', 'Streep', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'Likewise', 'problem', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'romantic', 'lead', 'well', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'part', 'earnestness', 'hard', 'keep', 'mind', 'town', 'photograph', 'covered', 'bridges', 'not', 'track', 'down', 'killer.This', 'criticism', 'aside', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'translating', 'story', 'screen', 'was', 'able', 'improve', 'book', 'number', 'ways', 'film', 'nicely', 'photographed', 'location', 'manage', 'preserve', 'tiny', 'universe', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'brief', 'timeline', 'story.Watch', 'great', 'tracking', 'shot', 'end', 'film', 'Streep', 'character', 'house', 'departing', 'Eastwood', 'later', 'scene', 'rain', 'was', 'not', 'book', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'well.I', 'would', 'have', 'casted', 'differently', 'good', 'movie']",N/A
88438,A264UCDZZ6RLDN,0790729369,Russell de Ville,"[2, 2]","Love that Green GMC Pickup!Boy! You better be careful what you put on facebook! In a moment of late night reverie, I happened to make the following on-line comment before signing off: Just finished watching 'The Bridges of Madison County' for like the 9th time in three weeks. I love that film!A Friend had responded the next morning by asking `Why?' It's not like she threw the gauntlet down or anything. I didn't view it as a challenge to my tastes. Nor did she remind me that the Film had been out quite a few years now (released 1995) and had gotten mixed reviews even then. I made the brief comment in return that her question deserved a well-considered answer.Why is a very good Question. If you'll pardon such a simple list, here's what immediately comes to mind:* TBoMC is basically an intriguing story about two people who I find interesting on several levels. They each have an assortment of likeable characteristics and curious foibles as do we all. Yet they seem to be genuinely good people.* That Robert is middle-aged and Francesca is probably somewhere near her early 40s speaks to me, as do their revealed life experiences.* I don't believe this to simply be a lustful encounter. That they misbehave is a given. But there are times I don't think we can reasonably be expected to control matters of the heart and with whom we fall in love. They succumbed to time, circumstance and temptation.* The story is told with a minimum of clutter and yet it's allowed to develop slowly and carefully. It has a rhythm and pacing I've come to appreciate.* The minimal associative story lines support and enhance the main themes and reinforce the fact that of poor choice come consequences. We are reminded that such tangential outcomes may very well involve family and friends.* Francesca ultimately chooses the higher calling and remains with her husband and children. I didn't expect this and found her decision honorable and to be preferred, if not completely satisfying on a certain visceral and emotional level.* Duty and Familial Love were reinforced and affirmed.* And yet it's made obvious to us that both principals did really love each other and thought about each other often until their dying day.* The dispersal of Francesca's ashes at Roseman Bridge is so poignant.* Eastwood as the Director found it unnecessary to include an excess of foul language or nudity. The story was revealed to us tastefully - even artistically.* The Film is beautifully photographed.* Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood are superb in these roles! We've know for some time that Meryl is such a fine actress but that Clint more than holds his own in such a roll cast against expected type delights me to no end. No guns, fisticuffs, orangutans or serapes here!* Tissues were required the first few viewings! This is a pretty good indicator that I resonated with the Film on an emotional level.* I love a good Romance. What else can I say?I think this Film is truly deserving of Five Stars.Russell de Ville11 March 2010",5,Love that Green GMC Pickup!,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,3009,"['Love', 'Green', 'GMC', 'Pickup', 'Boy', 'better', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'put', 'facebook', 'moment', 'late', 'night', 'reverie', 'happened', 'make', 'following', 'on-line', 'comment', 'signing', 'off', 'Just', 'finished', 'watching', ""'The"", 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', '9th', 'time', 'three', 'weeks', 'love', 'film', 'Friend', 'had', 'responded', 'next', 'morning', 'asking', 'Why', 'not', 'threw', 'gauntlet', 'down', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'challenge', 'tastes', 'did', 'remind', 'Film', 'had', 'been', 'out', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'released', '1995', 'had', 'gotten', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'even', 'then', 'made', 'brief', 'comment', 'return', 'question', 'deserved', 'well-considered', 'answer.Why', 'very', 'good', 'Question', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'such', 'simple', 'list', 'here', 'what', 'immediately', 'mind', '*', 'TBoMC', 'basically', 'intriguing', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'interesting', 'several', 'levels', 'have', 'assortment', 'likeable', 'characteristics', 'curious', 'foibles', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'genuinely', 'good', 'people', '*', 'Robert', 'middle-aged', 'Francesca', 'probably', 'somewhere', 'early', '40s', 'speaks', 'do', 'revealed', 'life', 'experiences', '*', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'simply', 'be', 'lustful', 'encounter', 'misbehave', 'given', 'are', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'reasonably', 'be', 'expected', 'control', 'matters', 'heart', 'whom', 'fall', 'love', 'succumbed', 'time', 'circumstance', 'temptation', '*', 'story', 'told', 'minimum', 'clutter', 'yet', 'allowed', 'develop', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'rhythm', 'pacing', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', '*', 'minimal', 'associative', 'story', 'lines', 'support', 'enhance', 'main', 'themes', 'reinforce', 'fact', 'poor', 'choice', 'come', 'consequences', 'are', 'reminded', 'such', 'tangential', 'outcomes', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'involve', 'family', 'friends', '*', 'Francesca', 'ultimately', 'higher', 'calling', 'husband', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'found', 'decision', 'honorable', 'be', 'preferred', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'certain', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'level', 'Duty', 'Familial', 'Love', 'were', 'reinforced', 'affirmed', '*', 'yet', 'made', 'obvious', 'principals', 'did', 'really', 'love', 'other', 'thought', 'other', 'often', 'dying', 'day', '*', 'dispersal', 'Francesca', 'ashes', 'Roseman', 'Bridge', 'so', 'poignant', '*', 'Eastwood', 'Director', 'found', 'unnecessary', 'include', 'excess', 'foul', 'language', 'nudity', 'story', 'was', 'revealed', 'tastefully', 'even', 'artistically', '*', 'Film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', '*', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'are', 'superb', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'know', 'time', 'Meryl', 'such', 'fine', 'actress', 'Clint', 'more', 'own', 'such', 'roll', 'cast', 'expected', 'type', 'delights', 'end', 'guns', 'fisticuffs', 'orangutans', 'serapes', 'here', '*', 'Tissues', 'were', 'required', 'first', 'few', 'viewings', 'pretty', 'good', 'indicator', 'resonated', 'Film', 'emotional', 'level', '*', 'love', 'good', 'Romance', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'think', 'Film', 'truly', 'deserving', 'Five', 'Stars.Russell', 'de', 'Ville11', 'March', '2010']",N/A

Love him as a director, and even as a politician, but IMO you haven't fallen in love with him until you have seen him in &#34;Bridges&#34;.

88451,A3SAU1A0IEYDNX,0790729369,Soaring Heart,"[90, 96]","This movie is one of my all-time favorite romances. It begins with adult siblings looking through their deceased Mother's things where they discover  a secret. They &quot;find their way&quot; to a letter from their Mother  (Francesca played by Meryl Streep) which is the content of this movie  (along with 3 journals.) Francesca's words in the letter to her children  open the story. &quot;I know it sounds awful but I couldn't wait for you  all to leave. You were going to be gone until Friday. Four days--just four  days.&quot; This is where the story begins, in the past.&quot;THE  BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY&quot; is about these incredible life-changing  four days of Francesca and Robert. The Father and children had left to  enter a steer into a fair and Francesca stayed home. Not long after  Francesca's family leaves, a photographer who is lost (Robert Kincaid  played by Clint Eastwood) drives up to ask for directions to a covered  bridge. She tries to tell him but they both get confused because the roads  aren't marked. Of course if they would have been, this love story would  have never have happened. The way their affair begins so innocently is part  of what makes the story so compelling for me. Streep and Eastwood together  are amazing; and their growing  friendship and deep love that follows is  magical. Both of their acting is flawless in my eyes as well as the music,  script and cinematography. Eastwood is an impressive producer as well as  director.It is such a wonderful story I could paraphrase the whole  thing;  but I won't. Just enjoy each moment of their 4 days together which  go on forever in their hearts. I think the moral of &quot;THE BRIDGES OF  MADSION COUNTY&quot; is to be grateful for every day of our lives. Life is  a long-winding road full of joy and sorrow. We must survive the sorrow and  truly cherish the joy while at the same time remembering that our decisions  affect not only us but our loved ones as well. The ending is  magnificient.As my wise Father told me once: &quot;Live your life so  that you'll have no regrets and try to accomplish that which will be best  for everyone.&quot;",5,&quot;THIS KIND OF CERTAINTY COMES BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME.&quot;,966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,2141,"['movie', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'romances', 'adult', 'siblings', 'looking', 'deceased', 'Mother', 'things', 'where', 'discover', 'secret', 'quot', 'find', 'way', 'quot', 'letter', 'Mother', 'Francesca', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'content', 'movie', '3', 'journals', 'Francesca', 'words', 'letter', 'children', 'open', 'story', 'quot', 'know', 'awful', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'leave', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'gone', 'Friday', 'Four', 'days', 'just', 'four', 'days.', 'quot', 'where', 'story', 'past.', 'quot', 'THE', 'BRIDGES', 'OF', 'MADISON', 'COUNTY', 'quot', 'incredible', 'life-changing', 'four', 'days', 'Francesca', 'Robert', 'Father', 'children', 'had', 'left', 'enter', 'steer', 'fair', 'Francesca', 'stayed', 'home', 'Not', 'long', 'Francesca', 'family', 'photographer', 'who', 'lost', 'Robert', 'Kincaid', 'played', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'up', 'ask', 'directions', 'covered', 'bridge', 'tell', 'get', 'confused', 'roads', 'are', ""n't"", 'marked', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'way', 'affair', 'so', 'innocently', 'part', 'what', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'Streep', 'Eastwood', 'together', 'are', 'amazing', 'growing', 'friendship', 'deep', 'love', 'magical', 'acting', 'flawless', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'script', 'cinematography', 'Eastwood', 'impressive', 'producer', 'as', 'well', 'director.It', 'such', 'wonderful', 'story', 'could', 'paraphrase', 'whole', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Just', 'enjoy', 'moment', '4', 'days', 'together', 'go', 'forever', 'hearts', 'think', 'moral', 'quot', 'THE', 'BRIDGES', 'OF', 'MADSION', 'COUNTY', 'quot', 'be', 'grateful', 'day', 'lives', 'Life', 'long-winding', 'road', 'full', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'must', 'survive', 'sorrow', 'truly', 'cherish', 'joy', 'same', 'time', 'remembering', 'decisions', 'affect', 'not', 'only', 'loved', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'magnificient.As', 'wise', 'Father', 'told', 'quot', 'Live', 'life', ""'ll"", 'have', 'regrets', 'try', 'accomplish', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'everyone.', 'quot']",N/A

88463,ARWCFLO1Q0XY9,0790729369,W. Foley,"[30, 83]","I am usually a liberal minded person. But I really had a difficult time rooting for this couple.The scenery and the location are fantastic. The performances by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are among the best of their careers. But on personal moral grounds I have to give this movie a bad review.Francesca is a bored an unfulfilled housewife. Her husband, who is away, is not a bad character, he doesn't abuse or neglect her, she is just not content with her life and ends up having an affair.She breaks sacred vows for moments of selfish pleasure and we are supposed to be on her side? How about telling the story from the perspective of her husband who may someday finds out about the affair. His bond with his wife has been broken, his trust in her has been shattered. How do we feel about Francesca now? Do we now still feel sorry for this poor unfulfilled heroine? And Clint Eastwood's character doesn't get off easy either. I think it is good that he discovers he is vulnerable and that he does need people and intimacy in his life, but where are his values and integrity? This may look like love to him but it is lust. Love is honoring commitments, not only the ones an individual makes, but also honoring the commitments and boundaries of others.Affairs break hearts and ruin families. I don't think that this is something we as a culture and society need to condone and romanticizes. Sure, stories such as these are dramatic, they sell, and they try to make some type of statement. But I think it does come down to values. Values, that is a word that has been bantered about so much I think it may have lost its meaning. To value something is to treasure, honor, and to reserve whatever it is we value as something special, and sacred. The irony in ""Bridges of Madison County"" is that it communicates to us the message that commitment, love, and sex, no longer hold that place of value. If there is a moral victory in the fact that she stayed with her family, the victory is hollow. Because the film, in its romanticized view of the affair, tries to leave the audience with the impression that her choice to stay with her family was somehow a loss for her...and that is very sad.",1,A Sad Tale of Lost Values,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2190,"['am', 'usually', 'liberal', 'minded', 'person', 'really', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'rooting', 'couple.The', 'scenery', 'location', 'are', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'are', 'best', 'careers', 'personal', 'moral', 'grounds', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'bad', 'review.Francesca', 'bored', 'unfulfilled', 'housewife', 'husband', 'who', 'away', 'not', 'bad', 'character', ""n't"", 'abuse', 'neglect', 'just', 'not', 'content', 'life', 'up', 'having', 'affair.She', 'breaks', 'sacred', 'vows', 'moments', 'selfish', 'pleasure', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'side', 'How', 'telling', 'story', 'perspective', 'husband', 'who', 'may', 'someday', 'out', 'affair', 'bond', 'wife', 'been', 'broken', 'trust', 'been', 'shattered', 'How', 'do', 'feel', 'Francesca', 'now', 'Do', 'now', 'still', 'feel', 'sorry', 'poor', 'unfulfilled', 'heroine', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'easy', 'either', 'think', 'good', 'vulnerable', 'need', 'people', 'intimacy', 'life', 'where', 'are', 'values', 'integrity', 'may', 'look', 'love', 'lust', 'Love', 'honoring', 'commitments', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'individual', 'also', 'honoring', 'commitments', 'boundaries', 'others.Affairs', 'break', 'hearts', 'ruin', 'families', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'something', 'culture', 'society', 'need', 'condone', 'romanticizes', 'Sure', 'stories', 'such', 'are', 'dramatic', 'sell', 'try', 'make', 'type', 'statement', 'think', 'come', 'values', 'Values', 'word', 'been', 'bantered', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'meaning', 'value', 'something', 'treasure', 'honor', 'reserve', 'whatever', 'value', 'something', 'special', 'sacred', 'irony', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'message', 'commitment', 'love', 'sex', 'no', 'longer', 'hold', 'place', 'value', 'moral', 'victory', 'fact', 'stayed', 'family', 'victory', 'hollow', 'film', 'romanticized', 'view', 'affair', 'tries', 'leave', 'audience', 'impression', 'choice', 'stay', 'family', 'was', 'somehow', 'loss', 'very', 'sad']",N/A

I guessed I am just an emotional person and more mature, so that I could appreciate this ""emotionally impacting, romantic, and beautiful film"". I am glad to have this film in my DVD collection now. This may not have been Meryl Streep's most acclaimed role, but it's on my favorite list, because her portrayal of an Iowa housewife Francesca Johnson is flawless. She uses body language so effective here( as well as in The Hours) to convey her her inner emotions, and once again she proved to the world that she's best at imitating an accent. This film scored her 10th Oscar nomination!It's a simple story about love and romance arriving into Francesca's mundune married life again when a world-travelling photographer(Robert Kincaid/Clint Eastwood) lured her into photographing her in the local sights. During the few days spent together with Robert, she fell alive again and they fall in love before he leaves town, and she's being persuaded to ran away with him....Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are so mesmerizing together.
