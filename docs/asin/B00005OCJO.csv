672282,A2UMY98SHQWKV3,B00005OCJO,"Anna's Mom ""kat519""","[2, 2]","This is a must see for any fan of Theatre, Brooks, Lane, or Broderick. Not only does this documentary allow the viewer to see and hear 13-14 songs beinging recorded, which is so rare in these kind of specials, but it captures the energy and overall excitement that is in the air from the first minute of film. Mel Brooks, grinning from ear to ear, hosts and fills the viewer in on what happenes between the songs being recorded. It is so obvious from the get-go that &quot;The Producers&quot; is a labor of love for him, and he seems to be on cloud nine the entire special. Nathan Lane, the veteran theatre and film actor, is a joy to watch as he uses his powerful voice wonderfully, often complaining that he can not hear himself when he's singing-which leads to a very funny bit with Lane mocking the sound editor. Matthew Broderick, shy as ever, has the funniest bit in the entire documentary. With a prompt from Lane, he goes into a dead-on Marlon Brando impression that has the cast in stiches (Broderick worked with Brando in the hilarious Godfather spoof &quot;The Freshman&quot;). All-in-all, no substitude for the show, which was incredible, but a great look at the creator, cast, crew and collaboration that gave us &quot;The Producers&quot;!!",4,A Gem of a Documentary,1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,1253,"['must', 'see', 'fan', 'Theatre', 'Brooks', 'Lane', 'Broderick', 'Not', 'only', 'documentary', 'allow', 'viewer', 'see', 'hear', '13-14', 'songs', 'beinging', 'recorded', 'so', 'rare', 'kind', 'specials', 'energy', 'overall', 'excitement', 'air', 'first', 'minute', 'film', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'hosts', 'viewer', 'what', 'happenes', 'songs', 'being', 'recorded', 'so', 'obvious', 'get-go', 'quot', 'Producers', 'quot', 'labor', 'love', 'be', 'cloud', 'nine', 'entire', 'special', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'veteran', 'theatre', 'film', 'actor', 'joy', 'watch', 'powerful', 'voice', 'wonderfully', 'often', 'complaining', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'when', 'singing-which', 'leads', 'very', 'funny', 'bit', 'Lane', 'mocking', 'sound', 'editor', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'shy', 'ever', 'funniest', 'bit', 'entire', 'documentary', 'prompt', 'Lane', 'dead-on', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'impression', 'cast', 'stiches', 'Broderick', 'worked', 'Brando', 'hilarious', 'Godfather', 'spoof', 'quot', 'Freshman', 'quot', 'All-in-all', 'substitude', 'show', 'was', 'incredible', 'great', 'look', 'creator', 'cast', 'crew', 'collaboration', 'gave', 'quot', 'Producers', 'quot']",N/A
672283,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B00005OCJO,David Kusumoto,"[9, 9]","SIMPLY SUPER!Yes, this program aired on PBS, but it didn't have those precious extra minutes that are just as hilarious as the 85 minutes that make up the ""centerpiece"" of this DVD/video.The wonderful thing about ""Recording The 'Producers' - A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks,"" is instead of the usual stuff you get with backstage documentaries, here you get the cast and crew occasionally ""turning to the camera,"" ad-libbing stuff that seems as ""live"" as the show itself. In several spots, they make jokes about the documentary itself, while at other times, they are oblivious to the camera while concentrating on what they're doing.Yet after watching about an hour and 40 minutes of engrossing material (with the extra footage), this DVD/video, like the actual stage show itself (which runs about three hours including intermission), you still want more.Perhaps my only gripe is you never see the players ""on stage."" Well this is, after all, a documentary about the recording of a cast album. But what you do see provides enough voltage that it makes you want to borrow a fortune to fly to New York and to pay whatever it takes to get a seat to see a show that will run forever -- but sadly -- not with this original award-winning cast. (...)Best of all, what you get here that YOU DON'T GET in New York, is Mel Brooks, talking to the camera, explaining with tremendous charm and humor, EVERYTHING about how the show came to be, its plot, its songs and all of the elements the audience can't see unless they're sitting in the St. James Theater. He tells you everything in chronological order, even acting out the parts and dubbing in his one line into the cast album (""don't be dumb, be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party!"").This is critically important because most people outside of New York, which means most of America, still have NO CLUE about this, the greatest musical in Broadway history.  When Amazon buyers see this video/DVD, they'll understand WHY ""The Producers"" DESERVES all of its hype. You can't OVERSELL it!Every song is a show-stopper, a throwback to melodies and riffs that feel like a ""greatest hits"" package of the best musicals ever made. And the lyrics are so irreverent that you can only imagine your pleasure doubling if you could see the visuals that are associated with each song. Heck, the DANCING AND COSTUMES you don't see are the other half of the fun!(...)Mel says out loud, ""you know what we're doing would make a great movie."" That is, as a musical on film with costumes and the whole nine yards! And then he says Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick and the whole cast would be in it! There's a shot of Nathan and Matt grinning sheepishly, for they know what we also know: Yeah Mel, and pigs will fall from the sky.By the time a Hollywood version of this musical is released, Mel will be past 90 and the cast will be too old for their roles. And everyone knows movies aren't allowed to compete with Broadway. (...)I would have liked to see snippets of the actual show on stage. We know Mel has a video of the entire show, complete with audience applause and cutaways and close-ups. And I'm more sad that we'll never get to see it. We'll get stuck with the filmed version by Hollywood, that is, if we live that long.So what to do?Well, if you can't get to New York, if you don't want to settle for the traveling touring company that will probably make its way through America about five years from now, if you don't want to spend $$$ for a center orchestra seat at the St. James Theatre from a scalper, but you still want to capture what it was like, with this inaugural cast, to turn ""The Producers"" from a three-star 1967 film into a five-star 2001 stage musical, then BUY this!

This DVD can be enjoyed by anyone who loves a big old fashioned Broadway musical.While I like Mel Brooks, I felt he tended to talk too much and everything he said was met with gales of laughter by cast and crew.

For example, Nathan Lane clearly *is* the flamboyant Max Bialystock...  very dramatic off stage.  Broderick in contrast is a hipper but comparably introverted Leo Bloom, whereas Candy Huffman and ULLA quite clearly are very different people... and its really funny to see her going in and out of the role.Mel Brooks' (surrounded by his admiring creative team) narrarates, explaining the story of the Producers and bantering back and forth with anyone he can engage - - and even singing too.Back to back music, this is a delightful watch over and over view.  - - I made the mistake of getting it on VIDEO at the St. James to save $10, but now I realize it was a mistake because the tape ain't gonna last as much as I watch it...

Fortunately, the editors are not the MTV music video-type; we get to see whole songs being recorded, which is often not the case in these behind-the-scenes videos. Many songs are included, as well as interviews with Mel Brooks, who talks about how the show came about, the plot, and the cast members. One can see what a warm person Brooks is. And for those who cannot afford tickets to the Broadway show, or have to wait for months for availability, this is the next best thing. This video contains footage of Broderick doing a Marlon Brando impression, Susan Stroman praising the cast members, and more. We also get to see Lane getting a little nervous in the recording studio - at one point, he complains of not being able to hear himself, and gets snippy (or is he just being funny?) with a woman working the equipment.

672292,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005OCJO,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","""Recording the Producers"" which took place March 11, 2001, is a joy to watch. These people are fun people who are working hard and doing good work but enjoying what they are doing--a creative team that clicks together. Contrast this with my review of the recording of ""Company"" in which it looks like the patients have taken over the asylum. Sure, the cast album of ""Company"" is fantastic, but look at what it took to get there.This recording session of ""The Producers"" took about eight hours. I think it makes an enormous difference to be working with such a supportive, open person like Mel Brooks versus working for the obsessive perfectionist Stephen Sondheim on ""Company."" ""The Producers"" is an old-fashioned upbeat musical and ""Company"" is a view of an edgy group of neurotic souls. Both albums, both shows are terrific, but people get places in different ways. These people seem to get it right on a first take.Two romantic and sentimental songs emerge from this rendering, ""That Face"" and ""'Til Him."", but few of the songs will ever become standalone standards. Many are funny, character-driven, and the music moves the plot along.Lane and Broderick both have good theater voices, and Matthew is able to put across a touching romantic ballad whereas Lane is brash and farcical. That was what made them an ideal team. Broderick is excellent as the nerd.Brooks wrote sixteen new songs and used three from the old movie. He wrote songs in the old-fashioned Broadway tradition. Sondheim faces no rival in Brooks; exactly the opposite is true. There's no ground breaking of musical barriers in this show. In a sense, it's a retro show because Brooks loves the movie musicals of the thirties. Mel has never denied that his humor can be vulgar, coarse and crude at time which makes it all the funnier. The song ""Betrayed"" sung by Nathan Lane summarizes the whole plot in minutes and is described as a musical nervous breakdown.This is a bountiful feast for Broadway musical junkies like me. I saw three stage versions of the show, one with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick that I paid a premium to see. Those two really make the show, and it proved very difficult to cast the show without them. I also saw the movie version of the musical which I found disappointing, mechanical, and lacking in spark.In this recording session we get substantial interviews with Mel Brooks interspersed throughout. We see and hear the songs and the intensity of the singers. It's full of backstage Broadway gossip, and Nathan Lane even gets in a catty remark about the Rosie O'Donnell B'way show that went down in flames--""Taboo."" Lane recalls the taping of the ""Company"" recording, and he says he thought Elaine Stritch did fine on her first take of ""The Ladies Who Lunch.""Mel says of ""The Producers,"" ""This show was meant to be.""",5,A Great Show - A Great Documentary,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,2816,"['Recording', 'Producers', 'took', 'place', 'March', '11', '2001', 'joy', 'watch', 'people', 'are', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'hard', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'enjoying', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'creative', 'team', 'together', 'Contrast', 'review', 'recording', 'Company', 'patients', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'asylum', 'Sure', 'cast', 'album', 'Company', 'fantastic', 'look', 'what', 'took', 'get', 'there.This', 'recording', 'session', 'Producers', 'took', 'about', 'eight', 'hours', 'think', 'enormous', 'difference', 'be', 'working', 'supportive', 'open', 'person', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'working', 'obsessive', 'perfectionist', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Company', 'Producers', 'old-fashioned', 'upbeat', 'musical', 'Company', 'view', 'edgy', 'group', 'neurotic', 'souls', 'albums', 'shows', 'are', 'terrific', 'people', 'get', 'places', 'different', 'ways', 'people', 'seem', 'get', 'right', 'first', 'take.Two', 'romantic', 'sentimental', 'songs', 'emerge', 'rendering', 'Face', ""'Til"", 'Him', 'few', 'songs', 'will', 'ever', 'become', 'standalone', 'standards', 'Many', 'are', 'funny', 'character-driven', 'music', 'plot', 'along.Lane', 'Broderick', 'have', 'good', 'theater', 'voices', 'Matthew', 'able', 'put', 'across', 'touching', 'romantic', 'ballad', 'whereas', 'Lane', 'brash', 'farcical', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'ideal', 'team', 'Broderick', 'excellent', 'nerd.Brooks', 'wrote', 'sixteen', 'new', 'songs', 'used', 'three', 'old', 'movie', 'wrote', 'songs', 'old-fashioned', 'Broadway', 'tradition', 'Sondheim', 'rival', 'Brooks', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'true', 'ground', 'breaking', 'musical', 'barriers', 'show', 'sense', 'retro', 'show', 'Brooks', 'movie', 'musicals', 'thirties', 'Mel', 'never', 'denied', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'vulgar', 'coarse', 'crude', 'time', 'funnier', 'song', 'Betrayed', 'sung', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'whole', 'plot', 'minutes', 'described', 'musical', 'nervous', 'breakdown.This', 'bountiful', 'feast', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'junkies', 'saw', 'three', 'stage', 'versions', 'show', 'one', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'paid', 'premium', 'see', 'two', 'really', 'make', 'show', 'proved', 'very', 'difficult', 'cast', 'show', 'also', 'saw', 'movie', 'version', 'musical', 'found', 'disappointing', 'mechanical', 'lacking', 'spark.In', 'recording', 'session', 'get', 'substantial', 'interviews', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'interspersed', 'see', 'hear', 'songs', 'intensity', 'singers', 'full', 'backstage', 'Broadway', 'gossip', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'even', 'catty', 'remark', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", ""B'way"", 'show', 'went', 'down', 'flames', 'Taboo', 'Lane', 'taping', 'Company', 'recording', 'thought', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'did', 'fine', 'first', 'take', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'Mel', 'Producers', 'show', 'was', 'meant', 'be']",N/A

So I was delighted to get this DVD, a documentary and behind-the-scenes look at the recording of the cast album for The Producers. It contains nearly all the songs from The Producers and excerpts of Brooks, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in some candid (and funny) moments.If you believe (as I do) that watching musical actors and actresses rehearse their songs is enlightening, intriguing and fascinating, you won't be disappointed by this. Of course, if you originally saw this on PBS and recorded it, you may feel you don't need another copy. But I found the sound quality of this DVD to be far superior to the typical home recording quality (and I missed it on PBS anyway).
