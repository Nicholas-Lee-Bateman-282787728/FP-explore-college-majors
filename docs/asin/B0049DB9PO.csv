Maybe I got a bad dvd from Korea.  I also do not like that every time I watch it I need to make sure I don't get the Korean writing going across the screen. I really like Neil Diamond but this dvd needs some work done on it.,4,neil,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,330,"['liked', 'sound', 'photographic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'felt', 'picture', 'was', 'very', 'hazy', 'Maybe', 'got', 'bad', 'dvd', 'Korea', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'time', 'watch', 'need', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Korean', 'writing', 'going', 'screen', 'really', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'dvd', 'work', 'done']",N/A

1389382,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,B0049DB9PO,JJ,"[1, 2]","I'll say right off the bat that Neil Diamond is not much of an actor but he was certainly adequate in this role.  Again, Luci Arnaz lifts what could have been a real TURKEY right out of gobble gobble land and into Pretty Good Land.  She is just so good.  One of the worst things about the film is Lawrence Olivier's portrayal of his father. For one thing, unless Neil is supposed to be 45 in this movie then the father just looks way too old to be his dad. And, he overacts in every scene to the point where it is distracting (disgusting). It must have cost a mint to get him and heaven knows that Diamond had a mint to spend I'm sure but couldn't the director have pulled him in some - a lot. This would have been a much better movie with someone else in the role of his father. The scenes of Neil over reacting to his father disowning him are also overdone but I know they needed something to be a turning point in the story. Couldn't just be him getting more and more successful. I've watched it several times and I always enjoy it except, of course, for Lord Olivier. He just grates on my nerves every time. And, as I said, Luci Arnaz is such a joy to watch. I don't know why she was never a huge star. But, the music is, of course, the star of the movie. It is a really enjoyable movie but could have been a lot better.",3,Very enjoyable but has some problems,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1324,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'not', 'much', 'actor', 'was', 'certainly', 'adequate', 'role', 'Again', 'Luci', 'Arnaz', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'TURKEY', 'right', 'gobble', 'gobble', 'land', 'Pretty', 'Good', 'Land', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'One', 'worst', 'things', 'film', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'portrayal', 'father', 'one', 'thing', 'Neil', 'supposed', 'be', '45', 'movie', 'then', 'father', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'dad', 'scene', 'point', 'where', 'distracting', 'disgusting', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'mint', 'get', 'heaven', 'knows', 'Diamond', 'had', 'mint', 'spend', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'director', 'have', 'pulled', 'lot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'someone', 'else', 'role', 'father', 'scenes', 'Neil', 'reacting', 'father', 'disowning', 'are', 'also', 'overdone', 'know', 'needed', 'something', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'story', 'Could', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'successful', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'enjoy', 'course', 'Lord', 'Olivier', 'just', 'nerves', 'time', 'said', 'Luci', 'Arnaz', 'such', 'joy', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'star', 'music', 'course', 'star', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

I had not seen the film in a number of years, and after Diamond's last tour that began in New York City recently, I had a hankering to see an old work starring the singer. True, he is no actor, but Neil Diamond has enough talent that any exuberant fan forgives him for his spectacular showmanship otherwise.
