Then I rented it, and completely changed my mind. Here I was expecting a cheesy movie, and instead I got a heart-warming story (that's inspired by a true story!) and a handful of great performances, especially from Gooding, an actor that can seriously play any part he wants to because he's truly talented.Gooding plays James Robert Kennedy, a guy who is a bit slower than most with a heart bigger than the town he lives in. He spends his days pushing a shopping cart around town, filled with his findings and of course his little radio. He gets the nickname &quot;Radio&quot; from the local high school football coach (played by the magnificent Ed Harris), who lets him help out during the practices and games after a few of his players torment Radio. You may think that the coach just feels sorry for Radio, but you'll learn otherwise as the film progresses, revealing that sometimes people are nice just for the sake of being nice.This truly is a treasure of a movie, one that has no right to be written off as &quot;cheesy&quot; as I once did.

To the extent this is about North Carolina high school football, it doesn't grab me all that well. But it's really about Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his friend the football coach (Ed Harris). Radio's mama also looks familiar; she was on Law & Order. The actresses name is S. Epatha Merkerson, but I do not recall her name here, other than ""Mrs. Kennedy."" Radio's real name is James Robert Kennedy, as I recall.Radio is pretty severely retarded (this is 1973, before the terminology was updated), but he's a happy, gentle man. He rolls an old grocery cart all over town, and picks up discarded radios to fix. One day, he was outside the fence of the football practice field when a ball went over the fence. He picked it up and put it in his cart. Thus began a relationship with Coach Jones and the football team, with the coach teaching the boys compassion toward Radio after they ""jokingly"" bound him with bandage tape and locked him in the supply shed.Most people didn't seem to mind that he became something of a mascot to the team, although the principal seemed to notice that this was possibly a racist stereotype. Still, he seriously helped the coaching staff, and grew more verbal as a result. Of course, there's always one person . . . in this case the local banker and father of the star of the basketball team.All's well that ends well, but I'm not going to give anything more away.

Contrived, yes --- but still a wonderful, feel-good, and inspirational movie.Cuba Gooding was outstanding as Radio, a mentally challenged young man. If I had not known the actor who was playing this role, I would never have recognized him! Ed Harris plays to perfection the football coach who mentors Radio and allows him to be a part of the team. This gives Radio a focus that had been  lacking in his life, through no fault of his own.After seeing the movie, I found the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article that inspired it and I was equally touched.

740528,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00008EY60,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Right away it needs to be said that Radio is NOT your typical ""boy struggling to fit in becomes a star football player"" type storyline.  While at first it may seem to head in that direction, once we find out that a black student pushing a shopping cart down the streets is struggling to communicate with his classmates in a mid 70's small town because he's mentally impaired, the storyline drastically improves.Throughout the film, the boy gradually wins over the love and affection of everybody around town.  One thing that's a little confusing is that the begininng of the film focuses on football, then moves into basketball.  It might be confusing for those expecting the boy to make a decision, but jumping around between the two sports WAS his decision apparently.  If you're wondering how the movie got its name, it's because the mentally impaired boys name IS Radio.Radio gets into a TON of supposed trouble and becomes the center of attention because of his condition and because of his skin color.  Remember, it's the mid 70's.This next part might be considered a spoiler, so you've been warned.  Actually the rest of my review might be loaded with spoilers, so stop reading RIGHT NOW if you haven't seen Radio yet.I was surprised that he never actually became a part of the team.  He probably wasn't capable of it, but still, I'm happy -for the sake of unpredictability- that it never ended up that way.One thing I didn't quite understand is a segment involving the star of the basketball team.  He played a prank on Radio involving a girls shower room, but the way he and Radio made up is (shortly after the coach drilled the player for the prank) when he returned to his gym locker and noticed a radio and paper with a bunch of circles (football O's I assume) lying next to it.  He then went over where Radio was folding towels and made up with him.  I must have misunderstood something because I fail to see how this was supposed to get the two of them to make up with each other and become friends.  There was obviously meaning behind this segment but I didn't understand what.Overall, solid movie with a compelling drama.",5,touching,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,2137,"['Right', 'away', 'be', 'said', 'Radio', 'NOT', 'typical', 'boy', 'struggling', 'fit', 'becomes', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'type', 'storyline', 'first', 'may', 'seem', 'head', 'direction', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'black', 'student', 'pushing', 'shopping', 'cart', 'down', 'streets', 'struggling', 'communicate', 'classmates', 'mid', '70', 'small', 'town', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'storyline', 'drastically', 'film', 'boy', 'gradually', 'love', 'affection', 'everybody', 'town', 'One', 'thing', 'little', 'confusing', 'begininng', 'film', 'football', 'then', 'basketball', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'expecting', 'boy', 'make', 'decision', 'jumping', 'around', 'two', 'sports', 'WAS', 'decision', 'apparently', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'name', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'boys', 'name', 'IS', 'Radio.Radio', 'TON', 'supposed', 'trouble', 'center', 'attention', 'condition', 'skin', 'color', 'Remember', 'mid', ""70's.This"", 'next', 'part', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'spoiler', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'Actually', 'rest', 'review', 'might', 'be', 'loaded', 'spoilers', 'so', 'stop', 'reading', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Radio', 'yet.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'never', 'actually', 'became', 'part', 'team', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'capable', 'still', ""'m"", 'happy', 'sake', 'unpredictability-', 'never', 'ended', 'up', 'way.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'segment', 'involving', 'star', 'basketball', 'team', 'played', 'prank', 'Radio', 'involving', 'girls', 'shower', 'room', 'way', 'Radio', 'made', 'up', 'shortly', 'coach', 'drilled', 'player', 'prank', 'when', 'returned', 'gym', 'locker', 'noticed', 'radio', 'paper', 'bunch', 'circles', 'football', 'O', 'assume', 'lying', 'next', 'then', 'went', 'where', 'Radio', 'was', 'folding', 'towels', 'made', 'up', 'must', 'have', 'misunderstood', 'something', 'fail', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'supposed', 'get', 'two', 'make', 'up', 'other', 'become', 'friends', 'was', 'obviously', 'meaning', 'segment', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what.Overall', 'solid', 'movie', 'compelling', 'drama']",Radio

I thought surely that it was going to be a lame attempt by star Cuba Gooding Jr. to acknowledge to his fans that he knows he's been wasting his talent in films such as BOAT TRIP, SNOW DOGS, and RAT RACE. So, needles to say I wasn't that excited about seeing the film. However, my mom and my brother came to visit and it was the one movie they and my girlfriend and I could all agree on watching. And I'm happy to say my thoughts based on the trailer were proven wrong.RADIO is a wonderful film! As a matter of fact it is never cheesy and it never lays on the sap as I had initially thought it would. Instead it does just the opposite and is very subtle in it's emotions. I was as uplifted by RADIO as I have been by any film in recent memory. Cuba Goodings Jr.'s performance of the title character isn't only great it's incredibly brave. He isn't given much dialogue and yet he still really lets you know who his character is and what he's all about. This is the only noteworthy thing the actor has done since ""showing the money"" in JERRY MCGUIRE but it's been worth the wait. Not that I put that much stock in Oscar after the decisions the Academy has made in the past couple of years but if Cuba Gooding, Jr. isn't nominated for Best Actor it will be a crime. So far, there hasn't been a better performance this year. What else can I say? His portrayal is flawless and inspiring. Ed Harris is in fine form as well. Actually, I've never seen a movie Ed Harris wasn't good in so that should come as no surprise.I love films like RADIO. It's the type of film that makes me want to literally stand up and cheer. After watching this film, it made me want to go out and try and be a better person. You know, give someone a helping hand.

And though it has a few standard story telling elements, the real issue here is seeing where real human value is and how that should shape our priorities.Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the title character quite well, especially when we see the actual man over the closing credits and can compare.  However, this kind of innocence and decency embodied in this story's depiction of Radio is often dismissed in our ironic age.  Too bad, because the helpless and defeated rage Gooding is able to express when Radio loses his mother is absolutely beautiful.  (If you have lost your mother you will absolutely understand the truth of the scene.)Ed Harris is terrific as Coach Jones who, for reasons no one really understands - including himself - is taken with helping this lonely and lost creature who can barely speak and sees him as a person of value.  He takes care of him for reasons that even Coach Jones himself only vaguely understands at first.In order to make a story, there have to be those characters who reject Radio and see him as a problem.  And those actors do well with the roles given them.  Of course, at least some of the enemies are won over in the end.Debra Winger and Sarah Drew are fine as the Coach's wife and daughter.  And Brent Sexton adds a lot as the assistant football and basketball coach at the high school.  S. Epatha Merkerson is very good in her role as Radio's hard working and long suffering mother, and Alfre Woodard does a good job of playing the principal who wants to be supportive of Radio and Coach Jones, but who is also mindful of her responsibilities to other students and parents and who is also interested in her own job and career.",4,A movie about human worth and caring,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,1803,"['liked', 'movie', 'good', 'heart', 'simple', 'story', 'telling', 'really', ""n't"", 'football', 'movie', 'struggle', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'few', 'standard', 'story', 'telling', 'elements', 'real', 'issue', 'here', 'seeing', 'where', 'real', 'human', 'value', 'how', 'should', 'shape', 'priorities.Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'title', 'character', 'quite', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'see', 'actual', 'man', 'closing', 'credits', 'can', 'compare', 'However', 'kind', 'innocence', 'decency', 'embodied', 'story', 'depiction', 'Radio', 'often', 'dismissed', 'ironic', 'age', 'Too', 'bad', 'helpless', 'defeated', 'rage', 'Gooding', 'able', 'express', 'when', 'Radio', 'mother', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'have', 'lost', 'mother', 'will', 'absolutely', 'understand', 'truth', 'scene', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'terrific', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'who', 'reasons', 'one', 'really', 'including', 'taken', 'helping', 'lonely', 'lost', 'creature', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'speak', 'person', 'value', 'care', 'reasons', 'even', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'only', 'vaguely', 'first.In', 'order', 'make', 'story', 'have', 'be', 'characters', 'who', 'reject', 'Radio', 'see', 'problem', 'actors', 'do', 'well', 'roles', 'given', 'course', 'least', 'enemies', 'are', 'won', 'end.Debra', 'Winger', 'Sarah', 'Drew', 'are', 'fine', 'Coach', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Brent', 'Sexton', 'lot', 'assistant', 'football', 'basketball', 'coach', 'high', 'school', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Radio', 'hard', 'working', 'long', 'suffering', 'mother', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'principal', 'who', 'be', 'supportive', 'Radio', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'who', 'also', 'mindful', 'responsibilities', 'other', 'students', 'parents', 'who', 'also', 'interested', 'own', 'job', 'career']",Radio

Instead of developing the same type of solid characters, quality story, and authentic emotion that Forrest Gump did, Radio becomes wildly sentimental and far too maudlin.

Based on a true story, ""Radio"" focuses on the hardships of a mentally disabled man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is scoffed at by the locals in a small South Carolina town. Moving about evasively with a shopping cart filled with ""goodies"" along a backwoods road, the film's subject just goes from point A to point B in roundabout fashion, being virtually ignored by everyone, until an incident which occurs at a local high school changes this man's life. He then crosses paths with the high school varsity football coach (Ed Harris), who gives Radio an honorary position on the team as a ""waterboy"" of sorts. This young man begins to win many a heart of nearly everyone on the team, including the citizens of the hometown. Besides the coach, Radio's biggest fan is his mother, who just gloriously basks at the sight of her son's accomplishments. Since Radio enamorates such a bold and enlightening presence around the football squad, he is then given an opportunity to blend in with the student body, and enrolls in the eleventh grade. Persistence pays off, as this determined young man begins to pronounce words unknown to him before, thus gaining Radio a newfound self-confidence. Also contained within this uplifting motion picture, is a touching scene that will leave one emotionally shaken. While ""Radio"" is not your typical ""Win One For The Gipper"" movie, it is not devoid of the thematic meaning the film's storyline conveys (as is the case in some similarly themed motion pictures) - that being it is not just about sports, but is about persevering against the odds and showing everyone that no obstacle is too big or too small to overcome, regardless of one's physical size or personality type. Alfre Woodard displays an Oscar-caliber performance as the school principal who's doubtful of Radio's presence on campus.

Lovin,"[0, 1]","Radio is an average film about a young man with a learning disability (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is invited to join in with the local high school football team after the coach (Ed Harris) catches a few of his players torturing him.  The young man has a real interest in radios, so that becomes his nickname.  He eventually becomes another coach, even running drills with the players.The film is really about the relationship Harris forms with Gooding.  Harris even invites Radio to school to take part in the classes he teaches.  Naturally, some object, including the principal (Alfre Woodard), who has to keep standing up to the school board when they want to know why a disabled grown man is spending all day in their classrooms.  Another major complaint comes from the father of the star athlete who feels that Radio is a joke and a distraction from the team.  He infects his son with this attitude and his son does some rather mean things to Radio.This film is pretty good on some levels and rather weak in others.  Take for example Harris' family.  It is hinted at early on that Harris has never made time for his now 17 year old daughter.  This relationship is never developed in the movie, except for one scene which supposedly explains why he is so passionate about helping Radio.  The whole structure seems weak and unbelievable.  I also was not blown away by Gooding's performance.  It is so easy these days to give an actor credit just for playing the part of a disabled person.  Make no mistake, this is no Rain Man performance.Overall, this is a good movie that could have been much better.  Considering the fact that it is based on a true story, it really missed its chance.

A coach for Hanna High School in South Carolina named Harold Jones sees `Radio' numerous times who walks by the school sidewalks during practice and during the games and decides to bring him into the games after Radio takes a football which was kicked out of the field and keeps it. It is around this point when Harold Jones invites Radio to join the assistant coaching staff. However, some school staff and parents of the other students feel highly reluctant to keep `Radio' on the job as assistant coach believing that he is only being used but Harold Jones completely objects to the officials desire to remove `Radio' from the school.If you enjoyed ""Remember The Titans"", you are destined to enjoy ""Radio"" a lot as it deals with similar issues of prejudice in schools around this time although in a different light. Both of these movies are based on rather turbulent times during the immediate aftermath of the Civil Rights Movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the bigoted attitude that still was lingering in many schools around that time. The differences between is that ""Remember The Titans"" involves the team with an African-American as their new coach, learning to reject prejudice against non-whites and do some teamwork with their coach Herman Boone, ""Radio"" involves the powerful but true story of a guy who goes from being an outcast on the streets (he's not homeless) to becoming one of the most beloved assistant coaches the high school has ever had. ""Remember The Titans"" sheds light on overcoming prejudice against non-whites, ""Radio"" in a way involves a much more complicated issue of welcoming severely handicapped individuals into the fold as the number of mentally handicapped people is likely to only get larger in the foreseeable future (Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, etc.).(There could be some Minor movies spoilers possible ahead but hopefully not)James Radio Kennedy is still assistant coach at the Hanna school and is now in his 50s and still improves people's lives at the school and brings more victories to his high school football teams. According to the movie, Harold Jones is now retired but is still in close touch with `Radio' to this very day. I've been reading some articles while net researching on `Radio' and it says that In reality though, there was no record of Harold in fact ever retiring and is probably still coaching there for all I know. Some of the timeline elements are different from the real life times when the events in this movie occurred. While the movie takes place in 1976, `Radio' himself was made assistant coach way back in 1964, not in 1976. He himself was the victim of some cruel pranks early in his career but not the one shown in the movie but one was worse. But through it all, it's absolutely amazing to learn that `Radio' went from an outcast who could hardly write or read to becoming one of the most well-known and beloved assistant coaches ever at the school.Cuba Gooding Junior delivers a heart-wrenching yet joyful acting portrayal of James `Radio' Kennedy and in here, Gooding has never been better in any other movie I've seen him in so far. Excellent job! Everyone else does a fantastic job of playing their characters as well especially Ed Harris as Harold Jones. I felt ticked off at the character Johnny Clay's behavior at the beginning of the movie although he gradually came out and opened up to `Radio'. However he shows the cold hard truth of how pranksters can really regret their actions later on.While some of the elements of the story are altered from what actually happened in `Radio's real life, this is a very true story and is a very uplifting example of how even some who have severe psychological conditions can become very powerful and beloved individuals. It also brings to mind the sad truth of how a lot of mentally ill patients are completely neglected on the streets and the tragedy of what these individuals face on the streets (crime, adverse weather conditions, speeding traffic, dire poverty, police brutality, etc.) and the consequences of such neglect by others. ""Radio"" though is a shining example of how even people with handicaps like `Radio' himself have can show unbelievable courage and bravery to become respected idols for generations to come.Some may believe that ""Radio"" may rely too much on sentimentality but I beg to differ. I for one am glad that Hollywood at least for once, managed to put out a clean, and sweet movie free of the excessive levels sexual content, foul language, and excessive pointless violence of a lot of other movies these days. There are quite a lot of mentally handicapped people in this country and the number is only going to increase in the foreseeable future but seeing this movie is very uplifting as `Radio' would likely have long been deceased by now had Coach Jones not hired him as assistant coach but thanks to Jones, ""Radio"" Kennedy is one of the most beloved coaches in this country. Whatever happened, they sure tuned into the right frequency with this movie. Go with a friend, go with a date, or even go alone but whatever the case I strongly recommend that you tune into the right frequency and see this movie today. It's brilliant, it's sad, it's happy, all in one and is one of the best movies of the year so far.",5,Tune your brain to the right frequency and see this movie!,1068163200,"11 7,

740554,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00008EY60,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[5, 12]","""Radio"" is the story of a man who meets a boy who changes a town. Sounds sappy, eh? Well that's the charm of ""Radio"" but charm was not enough to win me over and give this movie a better rating.The movie stars film veteren Ed Harris and a star who I believe will become a future veteren actor Cuba Gooding Jr. Most of Gooding's movies are good. I heard good things about ""Jerry McGuire,"" ""Men of Honor,"" and ""Pearl Habor."" I saw him in ""Rat Race,"" ""Snow Dogs,"" ""The Fighting Temptations,"" and was probally one of the only people who liked ""Boat Trip."" But when these two great actors come together, you would think that it would make one heck of a movie. But people are wrong all the time and I was just wrong thinking of it being a great movie. The problem with ""Radio"" did not rest with the performances of the actors. All of the actors put there best into the role, but the problem was that the script and the story was too weak. Too sappy. Too much. I felt like I was watching the same thing that I've seen in tons of other films. It was just another tearjerker about a mentally challenged person who changes a life or many lives. That genre is just getting old.The movie starts with a young man named James Robert Kennedy, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. He is pushing a shopping cart down a dirt road, having fun. Every day he does this and he passes the sports field where he sees Coach Harold Jones helping his football team pratice for the upcoming season. The team includes Johnny, son of banker Frank Clay. Also couching team is Honeycutt. Harry focuses on football all the time during the season which neglects his wife Linda and their teenage daughter Mary Ellen who is a cheerleader for the team. Though Harry discovers James when the other boys on the team are making fun of him. He nicknames his Radio and brings him home to his mother, Maggie. Harry lets Radio hang around on the field bu Frank believes that he is becoming a disraction and the football team is becoming less of a team, and more of a social club. Then harry lets Radio sit in his class. Harry is a teacher at the school. Principal Daniels has a problem with that since Radio is not an official student. Problems arise from Radio in his personal life as they begin to educate him and learn more about how his father died, how his mother always works long hours at a hospital, and how he is just like all of the other kids, just a little different then them.The acting was amazing. I've stated that already, but I just want to stress the point. Gooding Jr. especially. He was just amazing. He played the part of Radio so well, that people who never saw that actor would probally think that the actor was an actual mentally challenged person. All of the actors put so much love in their characters. Whenever you saw Radio on the screen, you just had to smile because he was so innocent. He did nothing wrong, yet half of the town is angry at him just for being different. But they are really just scared. They are scared of what they believe is not normal, when Radio is just as normal as you and me. It's a sad thing, being angry at innocent things, at different things. Because in exterior does not matter. Towards the end of the movie Ed Harris says that they havn't been teaching Radio, he's been teaching them. Radio has been teaching them. He taught them that it is ok to be scared of things you don't understand, but it wasn't ok to take out angry on them because of their difference.ENJOY!Rated PG for mild language and thematic elements.",3,Good Acting But Not a Good Movie!,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,3521,"['Radio', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'boy', 'who', 'town', 'sappy', 'eh', 'Well', 'charm', 'Radio', 'charm', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'win', 'give', 'movie', 'better', 'rating.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'film', 'veteren', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'star', 'who', 'believe', 'will', 'become', 'future', 'veteren', 'actor', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'Most', 'Gooding', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'Men', 'Honor', 'Pearl', 'Habor', 'saw', 'Rat', 'Race', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'Fighting', 'Temptations', 'was', 'probally', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Boat', 'Trip', 'when', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'come', 'together', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'heck', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'wrong', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'thinking', 'being', 'great', 'movie', 'problem', 'Radio', 'did', 'not', 'rest', 'performances', 'actors', 'actors', 'put', 'best', 'role', 'problem', 'was', 'script', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'weak', 'Too', 'sappy', 'Too', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tons', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'just', 'tearjerker', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'person', 'who', 'life', 'many', 'lives', 'genre', 'just', 'getting', 'old.The', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'James', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'played', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'pushing', 'shopping', 'cart', 'down', 'dirt', 'road', 'having', 'fun', 'day', 'sports', 'field', 'where', 'Coach', 'Harold', 'Jones', 'helping', 'football', 'team', 'pratice', 'upcoming', 'season', 'team', 'Johnny', 'son', 'banker', 'Frank', 'Clay', 'Also', 'couching', 'team', 'Honeycutt', 'Harry', 'football', 'time', 'season', 'wife', 'Linda', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'who', 'cheerleader', 'team', 'Harry', 'discovers', 'James', 'when', 'other', 'boys', 'team', 'are', 'making', 'fun', 'Radio', 'home', 'mother', 'Maggie', 'Harry', 'Radio', 'hang', 'around', 'field', 'bu', 'Frank', 'becoming', 'disraction', 'football', 'team', 'becoming', 'less', 'team', 'more', 'social', 'club', 'Then', 'harry', 'lets', 'Radio', 'sit', 'class', 'Harry', 'teacher', 'school', 'Principal', 'Daniels', 'problem', 'Radio', 'not', 'official', 'student', 'Problems', 'arise', 'Radio', 'personal', 'life', 'begin', 'educate', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'father', 'died', 'how', 'mother', 'always', 'long', 'hours', 'hospital', 'how', 'just', 'other', 'kids', 'just', 'little', 'different', 'then', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'already', 'just', 'want', 'stress', 'point', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'especially', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'played', 'part', 'Radio', 'so', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'actor', 'would', 'probally', 'think', 'actor', 'was', 'actual', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'person', 'actors', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'characters', 'Whenever', 'saw', 'Radio', 'screen', 'just', 'had', 'smile', 'was', 'so', 'innocent', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'yet', 'half', 'town', 'angry', 'just', 'being', 'different', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'scared', 'are', 'scared', 'what', 'believe', 'not', 'normal', 'when', 'Radio', 'just', 'as', 'normal', 'sad', 'thing', 'being', 'angry', 'innocent', 'things', 'different', 'things', 'exterior', 'not', 'matter', 'end', 'movie', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'hav', ""n't"", 'been', 'teaching', 'Radio', 'been', 'teaching', 'Radio', 'been', 'teaching', 'taught', 'ok', 'be', 'scared', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', ""n't"", 'ok', 'take', 'out', 'angry', 'difference.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG', 'mild', 'language', 'thematic', 'elements']",Radio

I rented the DVD fearful that his portrayal would not ring true, but he completely won me over.  The key, I think, is his eyes -- his dull stare perfectly conveys Radio's mental slowness.  I never felt that I was watching Cuba Gooding, Jr. -- I was just seeing the character.  The rest of the cast is terrific, too.I was also pleasantly surprised that the football and basketball teams who come to love Radio don't ""win the big game"" as in most sports underdog films.  In fact, the sports action is just a backdrop for the main story.

The question here is about the place of a mentally disabled person in our society. Is he supposed to be pushed on the side and kept there in the margin or is he supposed to be helped to find a place inside where he could be useful to himself, to others, and happy too? I guess when stated like that the challenge would be accepted by anyone. Asking the question is answering it, as the saying has it. But if we move to the South in the early integration days and if the mentally disabled person is black, what can we do? And asking that second question reveals what it is all about then? Not about the retard as some are going to call him, but about the racial difference. And that is what the film shows with great emotion and subtlety. And the coach in the film is white and he is doing just what he feels is good and that creates some kind of a stir and the stir from some white parents will be solved essentially by the high school students themselves who adopt the boy and make him their mascot one said, but that was false. He was more a mirror into which they saw the challenge of sport, the challenge it is to live up to something you have never done and don't know yet how to do. And that mirror was teaching a lesson of courage and enthusiasm to the teens or young men and they learned that lesson with style, gusto and charm. They learned how to love the one who was pulling them up from the dirt into the sky. A model in life is not necessarily a Hollywood star, but he can be just someone who could be bitter and defeated and yet finds in himself the strength and the inspiration to accept and face his limits and then step over them and climb. Yes you can climb into a tree even if you have no legs or no arms. The climbing is first of all in your head and if it is not there, you will never climb the tree even if you have twenty legs. That's what the film is about and the bigots who resist that lesson are just off the point and out of focus.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,The heart may also be the brain,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,2176,"['simple', 'film', 'humanity', 'humaneness', 'just', 'plain', 'life', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'question', 'here', 'place', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'person', 'society', 'supposed', 'be', 'pushed', 'side', 'kept', 'there', 'margin', 'supposed', 'be', 'helped', 'find', 'place', 'inside', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'useful', 'others', 'happy', 'too', 'guess', 'when', 'stated', 'challenge', 'would', 'be', 'accepted', 'anyone', 'Asking', 'question', 'answering', 'saying', 'move', 'South', 'early', 'integration', 'days', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'person', 'black', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'asking', 'second', 'question', 'reveals', 'what', 'then', 'Not', 'retard', 'are', 'going', 'call', 'racial', 'difference', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'emotion', 'subtlety', 'coach', 'film', 'white', 'doing', 'just', 'what', 'good', 'kind', 'stir', 'stir', 'white', 'parents', 'will', 'be', 'solved', 'essentially', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'adopt', 'boy', 'make', 'mascot', 'one', 'said', 'was', 'false', 'was', 'more', 'mirror', 'saw', 'challenge', 'sport', 'challenge', 'live', 'up', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'how', 'do', 'mirror', 'was', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'courage', 'enthusiasm', 'teens', 'young', 'men', 'learned', 'lesson', 'style', 'gusto', 'charm', 'learned', 'how', 'love', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'pulling', 'up', 'dirt', 'sky', 'model', 'life', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'bitter', 'defeated', 'yet', 'finds', 'strength', 'inspiration', 'accept', 'face', 'limits', 'then', 'step', 'climb', 'Yes', 'can', 'climb', 'tree', 'even', 'have', 'legs', 'arms', 'climbing', 'first', 'head', 'not', 'there', 'will', 'never', 'climb', 'tree', 'even', 'have', 'twenty', 'legs', 'what', 'film', 'bigots', 'who', 'resist', 'lesson', 'are', 'just', 'point', 'focus.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Radio

That was my circumstance when I watched ""Radio.""It was easy to be attracted to this story with the two leads of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris, who has been one of my favorites since he played John Glenn in ""The Right Stuff.""  Very early on it could be told that this story had makings with the sought-after qualities enumerated above.  So, armed with full knowledge of the sins of many modern film makers, while watching I found myself mentally muttering: Don't screw it up . . . don't screw it up . . .  don't screw it up.They didn't.

Somehow I completely missed this one when it was in the theaters which is regrettable however, a good friend put me on to this movie and I'm enormously grateful as I found this movie to be absorbing, touching and heart warming as I'm sure you will as well!For several years now, for me, any movie with Ed Harris in it has been one to watch as he is an extremely talented actor that conveys his characters emotions very well, engendering you to his performance.  The same can be said of Cuba Gooding Jr. as well, he has done very few movies that I could say I didn't care for.  As a general rule and one that applies to this movie in the fullest, when Cuba Gooding Jr. takes a role, he turns it into an Oscar caliber performance and that can truly be said of his performance in this wonderful film.  I would also definitely have to say that it was nice to see Debra Winger in this film as the last movie I can recall seeing her in was &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman,&quot; which is too bad as she is an exceptional actress!  Last but not least is the performance by Alfre Woodard, and actress that I first saw in &quot;Star Trek First Contact&quot; and since that time I would definitely have to say that anytime I see her on screen it's time to watch what she's doing.As of this movies release, &quot;Radio&quot; is only director Michael Tollin's second effort but it is quite easy to see with this beautiful film that he should have a long future in the director's seat.The Premise:Welcome to small town America in South Carolina in the early seventies where we have high school football coach, Coach Jones (Ed Harris) who is one of the states top high school football coaches.  During a practice session early in the season he notices a young man whom he later nick names &quot;Radio&quot; (Cuba Gooding Jr.), watching the football practice.  A few days later he finds that several of his football players are harassing this mentally challenged young man and before long he ends up taking him under his wings.  It doesn't take long for the dramatic conflict to surface as several people begin to question the coaches interests in helping this young man and one of the most influential boosters believes that Radio is a distraction to the team as a whole and starts taking steps to interfere...What follows from there is one of the most touching true stories that I've ever had the privilege of watching and I'm sure that if you're even remotely interested in these types of films you'll find it extraordinarily touching as well.

And the beauty of it is, it's a straightforward telling of a story, a well-written screenplay from writer Mike Rich, that leaves all indications that no strings are actually pulled.

As a reviewer I don't toss out 5-star ratings like candy.  For me, &quot;Radio,&quot; is the real deal.With the DVD we get to hear director's Mike Tollin explanation of the 3 levels of movies reflecting true life stories.  There is the movie that is a true life story, the movie that is based on a true life stories (some liberties taken), and then the movie that is inspired (much more liberties taken).  &quot;Radio,&quot; falls in the &quot;inspired category and it plays out well.  The dramatic freedoms the film creation team took with the story based on South Carolina High School football with real life coach Harold Jones and Robert &quot;Radio&quot; Kennedy rings true.Ed Harris, Debra Winger (usually irritating to me, but not here), and Cuba Gooding Jr. turn in fine performances but none topped by Gooding's portrayal of Radio.

740597,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B00008EY60,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 4]","I enjoyed many parts of this film. It is not perfect by far.  There are a lot of slow areas that weigh the movie down. The film didn't properly focus on its lead character but more on the actual football games. We needed to see more about Radio. We needed to see how he took care of himself when his mother died, how he felt towards Coach Jones ( not just that he seemed to like him because he gave him footballs and radios ). We needed to see how Radio really thought of the players, and being taken from his life of solitude and forced into the small spotlight as a town's precious ' gift '. I realize its hard to condense a real life story into a short movie but the director could have tried better. Instead of getting the story of a disabled black man we get &quot; Rain Man &quot; vs. &quot; All The Right Moves &quot;. Sometbing was missing here.  That missing addition was probably the cause of Radio not getting more attention in theaters or from awards shows.Cuba is a fantastic actor but I saw this role as going backwards for him. Since Jerry Maguire he seems afraid to shine again. In ' Radio ' he didn't seem to be playing James Kennedy as much as he was doing his best Dustin Hoffman impression. He was believable and Cuba is talented but there was something else missing. Ed Harris was dry but kept the film moving. The football scenes took up the film when Radio should have been focused on more.  Debra Winger was wasted. I don't know why she took such an unnoticable role. Maybe she wanted to be a part of something she thought would become a great film. Radio is good, touching and very sad at times but it has a lot to learn about standing on its own as a family classic.I recommend this film to fans of family films. Others may not recognize the small charm in Radio. If you bore easily or family movies are not your thing you may want to skip it. But if you're a Cuba Gooding fan, this is one you'd want just for the heck of it. Radio has its faults but stands above some of Hollywood's recent ' big hits ' by far.

Aveille ""raveille""","[3, 3]","What director Michael Tollin has created in this movie, Radio, is a tale of innocence, affability, and kindness overcoming cynicism, callousness, and indifference. The title character, nicknamed Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. is the youngest son of his widowed mother. He also happens to be mentally retarded. Set in 1976 in Anderson, South Carolina, the story itself begins well into Radio's life, at the age of seventeen. Because Radio's mother has to go it alone, she is forced to work endless hours in order to keep her head above water. Consequently, Radio is left to fend for himself each day for most of the day; yet, he is able to cope through it by keeping busy. Every day, he embarks on a daily journey through town with his trusty shopping cart and a few choice possessions to boot. Of particular interest to him is his radio of course, which if isn't already obvious, is his favorite possession.For years, Radio has walked along the same path, passing the same places everyday. Along Radio's daily travels is T.L Hanna High School. For years, Radio has passed by the school with little interest or attention given him by the faculty, staff, or students. Football season rolls around, and by twist of fate, Radio is put into a situation where he is noticed by the players and especially the coach, Harold Jones. Jones becomes intrigued with Radio, and goes out of his way to be kind him. Eventually, Coach Jones takes him under his wing, giving Radio an opportunity to help the team. Before long, Jones develops a bond with Radio and begins looking out for him as if Radio were his own son. With his newfound daily routine, Radio begins to gain some popularity and has a renewed sense of purpose.However, no one else is quite as taken with Radio as Coach Jones is at first. In fact, since Radio is truly different than most other ""normal"" people, he is seen as a freak by many. For the most part, Radio is able to disassociate himself from the malignant mistreatment he's gotten; but it is in these instances that examples of despicable, yet commonly familiar societal behaviors are played out before you. The dark and unkind side of human nature that is manifested in acts of mockery, marginalization, spitefulness, selfishness, contention, hate, impatience, and downright intolerance stare you right in the face. This movie has many scenes that should bring up memories to all of us who've witnessed or been involved in an appalling or inappropriate situation where we looked the other way and did nothing; a situation where we should've had the nerve or courage to do the right thing and take a stand against a particular wrongdoing.Coach Jones is a man of principle however, and he takes that stand indomitably. Radio's presence is not appreciated by some very influential people, and although Coach Jones gets a great deal of grief because of Radio, he is unflinching and stands firm in sticking up for him. At one point, Jones finally comes clean and tells of a time when, as a boy, he regretfully did not help someone in need. His actions with Radio are a largely influenced by the haunting guilt that he'd carried throughout his life because of this inaction as a boy. He had carried that guilt for so long that when he saw in Radio an opportunity to be free of remorse for his inaction, he instinctively acted on it. This childhood event and the subsequent feelings that Coach Jones lived through as a boy seems to be largely responsible for his Luke 10:30-37 heart, strong sense of benevolence, and integrity. Indeed, to coach Jones, Radio represents an opportunity for redemption.The beauty of the story though, is in how it reveals that kindness and love are the only way to counter and rise above darkness and negativity. Only light can extinguish darkness. While there are several characters that throughout the story represent the dark side of human nature, Radio's character, without question, represents the goodness and the light. It is his genuine enthusiasm, his pure and childlike innocence, his compassionate heart, and his benevolent spirit that shines magnificently. This story is an important lesson that should remind us of the value and dignity of every human life.For those interested, the true story of James Robert Kennedy, or ""Radio,"" and his relationship with Coach Harold Jones of T.L. Hanna High School in Anderson, S.C., is depicted in a 1996 Sports Illustrated article by Gary Smith.

740608,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00008EY60,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 7]","""Radio"" tells the true life story of a high school football coach who befriends a severely mentally retarded young man (whom they nickname ""Radio"" because he loves listening to the radio so much), lets him hang out with the team, and, thereby, changes not only the boy's life but the lives of just about everyone in the South Carolina town in which they live.  When Radio's behavior on the sidelines begins to serve as a distraction during the games, some of the less sympathetic, diehard football fans of the town make an effort to downplay his role or eliminate his presence altogether.Set in 1976, ""Radio"" is a thoroughly predictable, sentimental heart tugger that will have people either gagging on the syrup or crying in their popcorn.  For all its heavy handed manipulation, however, ""Radio"" turns out to be a pretty decent little film due, primarily, to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr., and to the fact that the movie doesn't overplay its hand as often as it might.  In fact, it wisely underplays much of the conflict, allowing the moments of quiet subtlety to predominate.  As played by Harris, Coach Jones is a solid, decent, caring man who can't help but give his love to a fellow human being who needs it.  Harris' soft-spoken strength makes us believe in the goodness of the man.  The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise well-meaning town folk, as even Radio's own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he's doing.  The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film.  The movie also isn't afraid to confront the issue of whether the people of the town - and that includes Jones himself - aren't actually being patronizing towards Radio in their treatment of him, and whether he isn't more of a ""mascot"" for the team than a bona fide member.  Gooding Jr. slips effortlessly into the role of Radio, making him a compelling figure even though he has virtually no lines of dialogue in the movie.  Alfre Woodard is excellent as the caring but nervous school principal who sees Radio's presence on campus as a potential threat to student safety, but who has enough faith in Jones to give Radio a chance to prove himself.  It's nice to see Debra Winger in a movie again, although her role as Jones' ever-patient, ever-supportive wife, doesn't give her much room to strut her stuff as an actress.There's no denying that ""Radio"" is a humanity-of-man type film that could easily set the teeth on edge with its Goody Two Shoes philosophy of life.  Be that as it may, ""Radio"" turns out to be a warm, uplifting film that even Scrooge would probably like.",3,sentimental but hard to resist,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2696,"['Radio', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'who', 'severely', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'nickname', 'Radio', 'listening', 'radio', 'so', 'much', 'hang', 'out', 'team', 'thereby', 'changes', 'not', 'only', 'boy', 'life', 'lives', 'just', 'everyone', 'South', 'Carolina', 'town', 'live', 'When', 'Radio', 'behavior', 'sidelines', 'serve', 'distraction', 'games', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'diehard', 'football', 'fans', 'town', 'make', 'effort', 'downplay', 'role', 'eliminate', 'presence', 'altogether.Set', '1976', 'Radio', 'thoroughly', 'predictable', 'sentimental', 'heart', 'tugger', 'will', 'have', 'people', 'gagging', 'syrup', 'crying', 'popcorn', 'heavy', 'handed', 'manipulation', 'however', 'Radio', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'little', 'film', 'due', 'primarily', 'superb', 'performances', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Cube', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'overplay', 'hand', 'as', 'often', 'might', 'fact', 'wisely', 'much', 'conflict', 'allowing', 'moments', 'quiet', 'subtlety', 'predominate', 'played', 'Harris', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'solid', 'decent', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'love', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'Harris', 'soft-spoken', 'strength', 'believe', 'goodness', 'man', 'film', 'effective', 'job', 'conveying', 'incredulous', 'reactions', 'many', 'otherwise', 'well-meaning', 'town', 'folk', 'even', 'Radio', 'own', 'mother', 'asks', 'Joe', 'why', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'scenes', 'Jones', 'woman', 'lovingly', 'played', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'are', 'finest', 'film', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'confront', 'issue', 'people', 'town', 'Jones', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'being', 'patronizing', 'towards', 'Radio', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'more', 'mascot', 'team', 'bona', 'fide', 'member', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'effortlessly', 'role', 'Radio', 'making', 'compelling', 'figure', 'even', 'virtually', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'excellent', 'caring', 'nervous', 'school', 'principal', 'who', 'Radio', 'presence', 'campus', 'potential', 'threat', 'student', 'safety', 'who', 'enough', 'faith', 'Jones', 'give', 'Radio', 'chance', 'prove', 'nice', 'see', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'movie', 'again', 'role', 'Jones', 'ever-patient', 'ever-supportive', 'wife', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'room', 'strut', 'stuff', 'denying', 'Radio', 'humanity-of-man', 'type', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'set', 'teeth', 'edge', 'Goody', 'Two', 'Shoes', 'philosophy', 'life', 'Be', 'may', 'Radio', 'out', 'be', 'warm', 'uplifting', 'film', 'even', 'Scrooge', 'would', 'probably', 'like']",Radio

Most people leave him alone, knowing that he is harmless, and hardly anyone even really sees him anymore as he pushes his shopping cart around.  But one day, Coach Jones (Ed Harris) finds a few of his star football players picking on Radio and he is intrigued and wants to find out more about him.  It is obvious that Radio is a little ""different"" and more than a little slow, but there is something about him that touches Coach Jones' heart.  To try and make it up to Radio, Coach Jones invites him to help out at the football practices and Radio is slowly adopted by the team.  Unfortunately, not all of the ball players and townspeople are ready to accept Radio and invite him to be a part of their lives.  As Coach Jones becomes more involved in the life of Radio, he is forced to make some difficult decisions in his own life and to see himself - and his family - in a whole new light.Ed Harris, who played Coach Jones, and Cuba Gooding, Jr., who played Radio, were both superb in this film.  Gooding did a fabulous job of playing the sweet, innocent Radio who honestly believed that everyone liked him and wanted to help him.  His performance was definitely a highlight of this film.  Harris also did a great job as a gruff, tough, small town football coach who discovers that he does have a heart after all.  The supporting cast was also excellent and I cannot think of anyone who was miscast in the film.  My major complaint is that the film is very slow paced and nothing really happens.  I enjoy a good drama as much as the next person, but the film was billed as a kind of sports-drama so I was thinking of something along the lines of Remember the Titans with some more action and some comedy thrown in.  There are little bits of comedy and little glimpses of action, but just about all of them are shown in the trailer.

He is tormented by some highschool football players who tied his hands, and locked him in a shed for taking their ball (without knowing it was theirs). The coach sees Radio around that area often, and gives him a job helping him with his duties. The coach even convinces the Principal of the Highschool to let Radio attend school. But once the team was going on a trip to play somewhere, but the principal wouldn't let Radio go with them. Heartbroken; Radio practices kicking a football in the rain. He finally makes a decent kick, and it regains his confidence. A while later, Radio's mother dies of a heart attack. The coach let's Radio stay with him. The football team, and the entire school finally opens up to Radio. Radio kept playing with the football team even after fifty years.In Conclusion: This is definatly a film for the entire family; even if your kids are too young to understand everything, they will learn the values of accepting other people who are different.",5,I'm Speachless...,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,1198,"['Words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'describe', 'heartwarming', 'value', 'movie', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'African-American', 'teenage', 'boy', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'alias', 'quot', 'Radio', 'quot', 'account', 'large', 'radio', 'collection', 'tormented', 'highschool', 'football', 'players', 'who', 'tied', 'hands', 'locked', 'shed', 'taking', 'ball', 'knowing', 'was', 'coach', 'Radio', 'area', 'often', 'job', 'helping', 'duties', 'coach', 'even', 'Principal', 'Highschool', 'let', 'Radio', 'attend', 'school', 'once', 'team', 'was', 'going', 'trip', 'play', 'somewhere', 'principal', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'Radio', 'go', 'Heartbroken', 'Radio', 'practices', 'kicking', 'football', 'rain', 'finally', 'decent', 'kick', 'confidence', 'while', 'later', 'Radio', 'mother', 'dies', 'heart', 'attack', 'coach', 'let', 'Radio', 'stay', 'football', 'team', 'entire', 'school', 'finally', 'up', 'Radio', 'Radio', 'kept', 'playing', 'football', 'team', 'even', 'fifty', 'years.In', 'Conclusion', 'definatly', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'even', 'kids', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'everything', 'will', 'learn', 'values', 'accepting', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different']",Radio

A well written story with good acting, if a bit much on the sentimental, and not tense enough to make it completely compelling. There are plenty of other reviews of the film exsit on here, I'll let you read those.As to the DVD package, it's definitely better than average. The film is presented in it's 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, and both the picture and sound are very good, as is the standard these days. Director Mike Tollin's commentary is worth listening to, and goes into a lot of detail on how they made the film, and how they got it right. Six deleted scenes also have good commentary as to why they got nixed.There are no less than three documentaries on here. One, Tuning In: The Making of Radio shows who the real Radio is, and who the real Coach Jones. This shows what it's really like in Anderson SC, and seeing those who the film is really about, and what the real story is. Next is Writing Radio, with screenwriter Mike Rich. Like Tuning In, this looks into preparing for the telling of the story, and how much work Rich put into it. Last is best, The 12-Hour Football Games of Radio. This documentary shows the process they went through to find kids to play the sports in the movie, and the behind scenes preparation of how they made it work. Sports Coordinator Mark Ellis is the champion here, shown putting the actors through the rigours of training camp, and creating inspiring authenticity to the games on screen, often at 4am in the morning, with great insight into what it takes to pull something like this off.

Epatha Merkerson, Brent Sexton, Chris Mulkey, Sarah Drew, Riley Smith, Patrick Breen, Debra Winger.Rated PG for some language.Running Time:  109 minutes.Cuba Gooding Jr. returns to Oscar-worthy status with this touching, yet predictable story based on true events. A mentally challenged young man (Gooding Jr.) who continuously walks around a small South Carolina town with a shopping cart and a radio is enthralled by the high school football practices every afternoon.  The high school athletes at first give the invalid a hassle, but soon realize the emotional boost that he gives not only the football team, but the entire community.Ed Harris stars in one of his few main roles of the past half-decade (instead of supporting roles such as ""The Truman Show"", A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Enemy at the Gates"") as Coach Jones, the local hero who puts himself on the line when he allows Radio to attend practices and walk the sidelines with the team.  Alfre Woodard is excellent as the high school football team's biggest booster who feels that Radio is nothing but a disturbance and is taking the limelight away from his own son's abilities and achievements on the field.While the overall concept and symbolism of the story is poignant, this film offers nothing that we have not seen before.  The underdog-who-helps-the-team-overcome-adversity-and-win-the-championshp has only been overdone since ""Hoosiers"" for the past twenty years, which makes the likes of a solid film such as ""Radio"" left as a predictable and fusty, yet heartwarming tale.

It's a true story loosely based on the real-life relationship between high school football coach Harold Jones and James Robert Kennedy, affectionally named Radio because of his love for the electronic communication gadgets.  The movie explores how the relationship between Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Jones (Ed Harris) begins, grows, and develops over the years and how Radio overcomes his natural tendancies to become a local hero.Gooding and Harris are excellent in their roles and both probably deserved Oscar nominations for their performances. Unfortunately, most critics blasted the movie for its syrupy sentiment and some claimed it was a racist film stereotyping blacks as being dumb and stupid (a criticism I never understood because the movie is all about overcoming racism and stereotypes).  Anyway, the acting in the film is good, but the movie is overly cliched and drags on too long in certain places. However, the story is a good one and the relationship between Radio and Coach Jones is fascinating.

Marshall,"[1, 2]","This film should have received much more recognition; it is a beautiful true story about a mentally challenged person who strives to fit in with society as a functioning human being. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. deserved Oscar nominations!If you love sports and ""old-school"" memories this film is a perfect picture to watch. The movie begins in South Carolina during the 70's it is based on the true story of a boy named ""Radio"" and a football coach who takes him under his wing, Coach Jones. It is a story of triumph mixed with racism, prejudice and great spirit. Coach Jones suffered persecution from town folks for his loyalty to Radio and Radio suffered taunting and old southern racism at times. The friendship is heroic and uplifting you will not be disappointed by the film or the storyline because it will appeal to almost anyone.Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent in his role as ""Radio""; he takes on the intricate behavior of a man afflicted with a mental challenge. His smile will pull at your heart strings and his spirit will inspire a better life for those of us without handicaps. Gooding conveys the innocence of a man-child who wants to belong as an active part of his hometown. In my opinion he deserved to win an Oscar for this performance, especially the scenes involving his feelings towards his loyal Mother.Along with Gooding I felt Ed Harris (as always) did an excellent job as Coach Jones. Despite the hardships remaining loyal to Radio presented, this man endured it all and assisted in helping Radio become a contributing member of his town. Harris is stoic and tender able to show great emotion and endure the backlash. Together Radio and Coach Jones manage to create a useful life where one could easily have been overlooked, especially in the South during the 70's.I recommend this film highly for an evening of true inspiration. Not to be overlooked is the fantastic music playing in the background filled with ""old-school"" memories and all those great AM radio moments.",5,Listen With Your Heart!,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,1997,"['film', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'much', 'more', 'recognition', 'beautiful', 'true', 'story', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'person', 'who', 'fit', 'society', 'functioning', 'human', 'being', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'love', 'sports', 'old-school', 'memories', 'film', 'perfect', 'picture', 'watch', 'movie', 'South', 'Carolina', '70', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'Radio', 'football', 'coach', 'who', 'wing', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'story', 'triumph', 'mixed', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'great', 'spirit', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'suffered', 'persecution', 'town', 'folks', 'loyalty', 'Radio', 'Radio', 'suffered', 'taunting', 'old', 'southern', 'racism', 'times', 'friendship', 'heroic', 'uplifting', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'storyline', 'will', 'appeal', 'almost', 'anyone.Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'excellent', 'role', 'Radio', 'intricate', 'behavior', 'man', 'afflicted', 'mental', 'challenge', 'smile', 'will', 'pull', 'heart', 'strings', 'spirit', 'will', 'inspire', 'better', 'life', 'handicaps', 'Gooding', 'conveys', 'innocence', 'man-child', 'who', 'belong', 'active', 'part', 'hometown', 'opinion', 'deserved', 'win', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'especially', 'scenes', 'involving', 'feelings', 'loyal', 'Mother.Along', 'Gooding', 'felt', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'always', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'hardships', 'remaining', 'loyal', 'Radio', 'presented', 'man', 'endured', 'assisted', 'helping', 'Radio', 'become', 'contributing', 'member', 'town', 'Harris', 'stoic', 'tender', 'able', 'show', 'great', 'emotion', 'endure', 'backlash', 'Radio', 'Coach', 'Jones', 'manage', 'create', 'useful', 'life', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'especially', 'South', ""70's.I"", 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'evening', 'true', 'inspiration', 'Not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'fantastic', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'filled', 'old-school', 'memories', 'great', 'AM', 'radio', 'moments']",Radio
