1379737,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B004117SFE,Jon Wynne,"[1, 1]","The art of the soap opera is a subtle one and not always inherent. Soaps can run the gamut from insipid to outrageous to compelling to addictive. The anatomy of a good soap is an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts, and some coverage of topical issues, all the while being set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations. Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters.The open narrative structure that incorporates the above definition guarantees that a soap can go on forever, given the chance. Witness the granddaddy of all soaps, Coronation Street, which has been in continuous production since 1960, with over 8000 episodes in the can. Some soaps, like SPRINGHILL, ran for considerably shorter periods, though in this case, at least, the show isn&#8217;t any less compelling and addictive for its short run.SPRINGHILL is yet another example of Brit TV gold, produced years ago (1996-97), and all but forgotten now. It&#8217;s a prime example of just because you haven&#8217;t heard of it previously doesn&#8217;t meant it isn&#8217;t good. SPRINGHILL, for its added supernatural elements, ups the ante by taking what is the traditional format of kitchen sink drama and marrying it with a new take on the perennial good VS. evil storyline of dramatic tradition. It&#8217;s not an obvious mix and could easily fail. It doesn&#8217;t. The cast is wonderful, including a remarkable teenaged actor barely heard of since this was filmed named Paul Culshaw. His John Paul Freeman is, it seems, the moral centrepiece of SPRINGHILL. It&#8217;s a brilliant touch and the show stands or falls by the skill of this young actor&#8217;s performance. In episode one he has a wonderful speech as he eulogizes his grandfather. It made me sit up and take notice as I eased into the off kilter world of the Freeman family. And from there it just gets better and better.With the exception of the handsome eldest son, the rest of the young people are far from glamourous in their appearance, a key element towards believability. Yet there isn&#8217;t a false note in any of the performances. Everyone is well cast and women&#8217;s roles are extraordinary.Plot elements are true to the world of the soap opera, though there are many surprises, too. To reveal any of them would be pointless out of context. Perhaps the ultimate compliment that can be paid is my genuine WORRY that we&#8217;ll have to wait awhile for the second series! SPRINGHILL entices with its mix of the familiar and the radical; it addicts with its uniform excellence and diversity; it manipulates with its absolute mastery of its execution. And, in places, it is laugh out loud funny. None of this could work were it not for the fact that the cast plays it absolutely straight. There isn&#8217;t even a hint of soap opera parody in the performances, though it is certainly (and wonderfully) there in the writing.SPRINGHILL is brilliant. See it. Then DEMAND the release of Series Two!",4,Original.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3258,"['art', 'soap', 'opera', 'subtle', 'one', 'not', 'always', 'inherent', 'Soaps', 'can', 'run', 'gamut', 'insipid', 'outrageous', 'compelling', 'addictive', 'anatomy', 'good', 'soap', 'emphasis', 'family', 'life', 'personal', 'relationships', 'sexual', 'dramas', 'emotional', 'moral', 'conflicts', 'coverage', 'topical', 'issues', 'while', 'being', 'set', 'familiar', 'domestic', 'interiors', 'only', 'occasional', 'excursions', 'new', 'locations', 'Fitting', 'characteristics', 'most', 'soap', 'operas', 'follow', 'lives', 'group', 'characters', 'who', 'live', 'work', 'particular', 'place', 'focus', 'large', 'extended', 'family', 'storylines', 'follow', 'day-to-day', 'activities', 'personal', 'relationships', 'characters.The', 'open', 'narrative', 'structure', 'above', 'definition', 'guarantees', 'soap', 'can', 'go', 'forever', 'given', 'chance', 'granddaddy', 'soaps', 'Coronation', 'Street', 'been', 'continuous', 'production', '1960', '8000', 'episodes', 'can', 'soaps', 'SPRINGHILL', 'ran', 'considerably', 'shorter', 'periods', 'though', 'case', 'least', 'show', 'isn', '8217', 'less', 'compelling', 'addictive', 'short', 'run.SPRINGHILL', 'yet', 'example', 'Brit', 'TV', 'gold', 'produced', 'years', 'ago', '1996-97', 'forgotten', 'now', '8217', 'prime', 'example', 'just', 'haven', '8217', 'heard', 'previously', '8217', 'meant', 'isn', '8217', 'good', 'SPRINGHILL', 'added', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'ante', 'taking', 'what', 'traditional', 'format', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'drama', 'marrying', 'new', 'take', 'perennial', 'good', 'VS.', 'evil', 'storyline', 'dramatic', 'tradition', '8217', 'not', 'obvious', 'mix', 'could', 'easily', 'fail', '8217', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'including', 'remarkable', 'teenaged', 'actor', 'barely', 'heard', 'was', 'filmed', 'named', 'Paul', 'Culshaw', 'John', 'Paul', 'Freeman', 'moral', 'centrepiece', 'SPRINGHILL', '8217', 's', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'show', 'falls', 'skill', 'young', 'actor', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'episode', 'one', 'wonderful', 'speech', 'grandfather', 'made', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'eased', 'off', 'kilter', 'world', 'Freeman', 'family', 'just', 'better', 'better.With', 'exception', 'handsome', 'eldest', 'son', 'rest', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'far', 'glamourous', 'appearance', 'key', 'element', 'towards', 'believability', 'isn', '8217', 'false', 'note', 'performances', 'Everyone', 'well', 'cast', 'women', '8217', 's', 'roles', 'are', 'extraordinary.Plot', 'elements', 'are', 'true', 'world', 'soap', 'opera', 'are', 'many', 'surprises', 'too', 'reveal', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'context', 'Perhaps', 'ultimate', 'compliment', 'can', 'be', 'paid', 'genuine', 'WORRY', '8217', 'll', 'have', 'wait', 'awhile', 'second', 'series', 'SPRINGHILL', 'mix', 'familiar', 'radical', 'uniform', 'excellence', 'diversity', 'absolute', 'mastery', 'execution', 'places', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'None', 'could', 'work', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'straight', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'even', 'hint', 'soap', 'opera', 'parody', 'performances', 'certainly', 'wonderfully', 'there', 'writing.SPRINGHILL', 'brilliant', 'See', 'Then', 'release', 'Series', 'Two']",N/A
1379738,A2P69YCHWBDSCT,B004117SFE,"mac ""sue b""","[2, 3]","I agree with the 2 reviews that put this drama into a soap opera group only because of the continuing storyline but that is the only similarity to a soap. The plot starts off really strong but quickly turns into a mess with everyone going in a different direction not knowing what they really want once the secret is out and with an ending that has you asking what happened to 2 characters who apparently fell off the earth. Unless there is a season 2 we will never know what became of them.We start out with a nice Liverpool family that has a dark secret that only 4 people are privy to, Liz,Jack, the local priest and Eva. Eva Morrigan shows up after a 15 year absence and starts trouble. She is not going to keep the secret and slowly goes after each member of the family that Liz and Jack Freeman have tried so hard to protect from her. She is part villian, witch and devil. After she gets her hands on the three oldest children she claims Liz stole from her she turns there lives upside down and  each are effected by the power she has over them ALMOST to the point of incest. Her daughter Trisha starts to feed into Eva's view of men and ruins her teachers career. She reminds me of  the character Lucy Ewing in Dallas. Same long blond hair and reeks havoc. Eva's next victim is her daughter Sue who is determined to get married and is so clueless she doesn't know which mother to have at the wedding. The beginning is great and the ending leaves you wanting more, but the middle is a mess. The best part is the music intro.

Like most soap opera families, there is a lot of turmoil between them and every one is out for themselves.
