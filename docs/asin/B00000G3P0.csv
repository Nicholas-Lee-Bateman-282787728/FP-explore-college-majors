The music is lively and there's enough going on to hold a toddler's attention.  The tape contains several classic children's songs such as ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"", and ""I've Been Working on the Railroad.""  Throughout the tape, the concept of counting down (from 10 to 1) is repeated either by Elmo or a couple of short cartoons.  Overall, I highly recommend this tape.The only negative comment that I have is that the first several minutes of the tape contains ads for other Sesame Street tapes.

Never did I expect to find him not only enjoyable but the most well-rounded character on Sesame Street.  It probably helps that my kid turns out to love the little red monster.The story begins with Gordon and a cadre of kids and Muppets fixing a bike and listening to the Bob Dylan-esque DJ on the radio.  After a rousing rendition of ""I've been working on the railroad"", the DJ announces Elmo's Top Ten Countdown to be aired later that day.  Zoe asks Gordon what a ""Top Ten Countdown"" is and Gordon mistakes Elmo's countdown for a musical countdown.  The misunderstanding continues until the end when it is revealed that Elmo is simply counting down from 10 to 1.As the story unfolds, Elmo tries his best to find a quiet spot where he can practice before the show.  Unfortunately, everyone on Sesame Street wants to get their favorite song played on the radio, so they find ways to seek him out and sway his opinion towards their song.The Count, in a straightforward and pushy manner, disregards Elmo's pleas for privacy and sings ""This old bat"" (a reinterpretation of ""This old man"") up to verse Five.  Snuffalupagus, who appears to be suffering from some sort of severe depression and acts passive-aggressively when Elmo tells him that he's too busy to sing, manages to get Elmo to sing ""Row Row Row Your Boat"".Later, while Elmo is hiding behind some boxes to practice his counting, Prairie Dawn just happens to be in the area with her singing troupe ""practicing"" their song ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"".  Prairie Dawn, who seems to be a posterchild for A-type personalities, puts the pressure to Elmo in the way that only an overbearing pastor's wife can.  Elmo stands around dazed for half the song because he doesn't seem to understand the words.  When he finally does catch the tune, he throws himself into the song with abandon.  He also realizes that the tune lends itself well to counting down from 10 to 1, and he practices his counting to the rhythm of the song.He peeks in on Big Bird's nest to see if he can find a quiet place to continue practicing his counting, but Big Bird has also heard about the Top Ten Countdown and is hard at work prepping his Birdkateers for their presentation of ""She'll be coming 'round the mountain"".  Elmo just can't catch a break.During all this hiding and seeking, Telly is trying to determine his favorite song.  He starts off thinking that the Alphabet Song is his favorite, but is unsure as he is also very fond of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  Just as he is about to decide on Twinkle, he bumps into a black lamb who greets him with ""Bye bye, Telly"" ('bye' is pronounced 'baa').  Telly unwittingly falls into the rascal's trap and responds with ""Bye bye, black sheep"", and his confidence in his favorite song wavers again.As Elmo is about to go on the air, everyone on Sesame Street gathers around the main square to hear the radio.  Telly, with favorite song in hand, arrives last and is disappointed that he can't present it to Elmo.  Instead, he decides to present it to everyone else.  The ""Alpha-Baa-Baa-Twinkle"" Song.  Prairie Dawn, sitting at the piano, curtly quips ""that's weird"".  What follows is a butchering of the three songs that needs no mention here.  It's apparent that no one liked it, but Gordon, nice guy that he is, tells Telly that he thought it was pretty good.  Everyone else, in a 180 degree turn, suddenly agrees and praises the song when just two seconds earlier they were making disapproving looks.Then Elmo counts down.  Everyone listening joins in at Gordon's urging.The real stars of this show are Gordon, who keeps everyone civil and friendly, Telly, whose constant waffling lets us hear three great songs, and Elmo, who despite being put upon by everyone on Sesame Street, throws himself wholeheartedly into every situation and still manages to count down perfectly on his radio show.My kid can't get enough of Elmo, and his positive attitude and willingness to speak his mind have changed my mind about him.  I totally recommend this video.",4,Personality disorders abound on Sesame Street,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,4233,"['excellent', 'video.I', 'used', 'loathe', 'Elmo', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'sudden', 'dominance', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'made', 'long', 'old', 'days', 'unseen', 'Snuffleupagus', 'mean-spirited', 'Oscar', 'Grouch', 'Never', 'did', 'expect', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'well-rounded', 'character', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'probably', 'kid', 'out', 'love', 'little', 'red', 'monster.The', 'story', 'Gordon', 'cadre', 'kids', 'Muppets', 'fixing', 'bike', 'listening', 'Bob', 'Dylan-esque', 'DJ', 'radio', 'rousing', 'rendition', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'railroad', 'DJ', 'Elmo', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Countdown', 'be', 'aired', 'later', 'day', 'Zoe', 'Gordon', 'what', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Countdown', 'Gordon', 'mistakes', 'Elmo', 'countdown', 'musical', 'countdown', 'misunderstanding', 'end', 'when', 'revealed', 'Elmo', 'simply', 'counting', 'down', '10', '1.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Elmo', 'best', 'find', 'quiet', 'spot', 'where', 'can', 'practice', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'everyone', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'get', 'favorite', 'song', 'played', 'radio', 'find', 'ways', 'seek', 'out', 'sway', 'opinion', 'towards', 'song.The', 'Count', 'straightforward', 'pushy', 'manner', 'disregards', 'Elmo', 'pleas', 'privacy', 'old', 'bat', 'reinterpretation', 'old', 'man', 'verse', 'Five', 'Snuffalupagus', 'who', 'be', 'suffering', 'sort', 'severe', 'depression', 'passive-aggressively', 'when', 'Elmo', 'too', 'busy', 'sing', 'get', 'Elmo', 'sing', 'Row', 'Row', 'Row', 'Boat', '.Later', 'Elmo', 'hiding', 'boxes', 'practice', 'counting', 'Prairie', 'Dawn', 'just', 'be', 'area', 'singing', 'troupe', 'practicing', 'song', 'John', 'Jacob', 'Jingleheimer', 'Schmidt', 'Prairie', 'Dawn', 'who', 'be', 'posterchild', 'A-type', 'personalities', 'pressure', 'Elmo', 'way', 'only', 'overbearing', 'pastor', 'wife', 'can', 'Elmo', 'around', 'dazed', 'song', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'words', 'When', 'finally', 'catch', 'tune', 'song', 'abandon', 'also', 'tune', 'well', 'counting', 'down', '10', '1', 'practices', 'counting', 'rhythm', 'song.He', 'peeks', 'Big', 'Bird', 'nest', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'quiet', 'place', 'continue', 'practicing', 'counting', 'Big', 'Bird', 'also', 'heard', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Countdown', 'hard', 'work', 'prepping', 'Birdkateers', 'presentation', ""'ll"", 'be', 'coming', 'mountain', 'Elmo', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'break.During', 'hiding', 'seeking', 'Telly', 'trying', 'determine', 'favorite', 'song', 'thinking', 'Alphabet', 'Song', 'favorite', 'unsure', 'also', 'very', 'fond', 'Twinkle', 'Twinkle', 'Little', 'Star', 'Just', 'decide', 'Twinkle', 'black', 'lamb', 'who', 'Bye', 'bye', 'Telly', 'pronounced', ""'baa"", 'Telly', 'unwittingly', 'rascal', 'trap', 'Bye', 'bye', 'black', 'sheep', 'confidence', 'favorite', 'song', 'wavers', 'again.As', 'Elmo', 'go', 'air', 'everyone', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'gathers', 'main', 'square', 'hear', 'radio', 'Telly', 'favorite', 'song', 'hand', 'last', 'disappointed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'present', 'Elmo', 'Instead', 'present', 'everyone', 'else', 'Alpha-Baa-Baa-Twinkle', 'Song', 'Prairie', 'Dawn', 'sitting', 'piano', 'curtly', 'weird', 'What', 'butchering', 'three', 'songs', 'mention', 'here', 'apparent', 'one', 'liked', 'Gordon', 'nice', 'guy', 'tells', 'Telly', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Everyone', 'else', '180', 'degree', 'turn', 'suddenly', 'song', 'when', 'just', 'two', 'seconds', 'earlier', 'were', 'making', 'disapproving', 'looks.Then', 'Elmo', 'down', 'Everyone', 'listening', 'joins', 'Gordon', 'urging.The', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'Gordon', 'who', 'everyone', 'civil', 'friendly', 'Telly', 'constant', 'waffling', 'lets', 'hear', 'three', 'great', 'songs', 'Elmo', 'who', 'being', 'put', 'everyone', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'wholeheartedly', 'situation', 'still', 'count', 'down', 'perfectly', 'radio', 'show.My', 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Elmo', 'positive', 'attitude', 'willingness', 'speak', 'mind', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'totally', 'recommend', 'video']",Sesame Street - Kids' Favorite Songs VHS
