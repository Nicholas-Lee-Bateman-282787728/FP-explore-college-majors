1258090,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B002AG2NTI,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 3]","This documentary-style drama looks at a year inside a French middle school. The acts are real kids, the teachers are real teachers and the script has a wonderfully authentic feel. The actors are improvising much of the time but their behavior and conversations come across as absolutely real. The kids are annoying, uncooperative, quarrelsome and difficult, just as any young teens would be.The class is a modern-day melting pot with many immigrant children from Africa, North Africa, China and elsewhere. One important objective of the French education system is to turn these kids from such different cultures and backgrounds into traditional citizens of France, conversant in classic French grammar and the tenets of French civilization. Unlike the United States, France is not a melting pot. Newcomers are expected to accept the predominant culture. But these kids -- and their parents -- are both unwilling and unable to do so. The kids from Mali and still strongly loyal to their country of origin, as are those from Morocco. They feel neither love nor gratitude nor loyalty to France.Before writing this, I read a New York Times review and the subsequent readers' comments. Many teachers wrote that the instructor in this class, Monsieur Marin, made many errors. He was never truly in command of the class; he encouraged too much debate; he tried to be his students' friend and then, when this didn't work, fell back on invoking his authority; he failed to separate trouble-makers; he violated privacy by allowing discussion of sensitive, even intimate matters.I'm not a teacher so I can't comment on his technique. It seemed to me that he was making a sincere effort in rather difficult circumstances.One plot device would never happen in the United States: two young students, as class representatives, are allowed to be present as teachers hold confidential discussions assessing their fellow students' performance. One then violates this confidentiality, telling one particular student what has been said about him. Her account is not entirely accurate and it precipitates the central crisis of the movie.It seems pretty absurd to allow 14-year-old kids to sit inon such sensitive discussions.This is quite a long movie but very interesting and thought-provoking. There are many differences between the French and American education systems -- but also some disturbing similarities. And kids are kids everywhere.",5,Riveting look at what really goes on in the classroom,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,2423,"['documentary-style', 'drama', 'year', 'French', 'middle', 'school', 'acts', 'are', 'real', 'kids', 'teachers', 'are', 'real', 'teachers', 'script', 'wonderfully', 'authentic', 'feel', 'actors', 'are', 'improvising', 'much', 'time', 'behavior', 'conversations', 'come', 'absolutely', 'real', 'kids', 'are', 'annoying', 'uncooperative', 'quarrelsome', 'difficult', 'just', 'young', 'teens', 'would', 'be.The', 'class', 'modern-day', 'melting', 'pot', 'many', 'immigrant', 'children', 'Africa', 'North', 'Africa', 'China', 'elsewhere', 'One', 'important', 'objective', 'French', 'education', 'system', 'turn', 'kids', 'such', 'different', 'cultures', 'traditional', 'citizens', 'France', 'conversant', 'classic', 'French', 'grammar', 'tenets', 'French', 'civilization', 'United', 'States', 'France', 'not', 'melting', 'pot', 'Newcomers', 'are', 'expected', 'accept', 'predominant', 'culture', 'kids', 'parents', 'are', 'unwilling', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'kids', 'Mali', 'still', 'strongly', 'loyal', 'country', 'origin', 'are', 'Morocco', 'feel', 'love', 'gratitude', 'loyalty', 'France.Before', 'writing', 'read', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'review', 'subsequent', 'readers', 'comments', 'Many', 'teachers', 'wrote', 'instructor', 'class', 'Monsieur', 'Marin', 'made', 'many', 'errors', 'was', 'never', 'truly', 'command', 'class', 'encouraged', 'too', 'much', 'debate', 'tried', 'be', 'students', 'friend', 'then', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'fell', 'back', 'invoking', 'authority', 'failed', 'separate', 'trouble-makers', 'violated', 'privacy', 'allowing', 'discussion', 'sensitive', 'even', 'intimate', 'matters.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'teacher', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'technique', 'seemed', 'was', 'making', 'sincere', 'effort', 'rather', 'difficult', 'circumstances.One', 'plot', 'device', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'United', 'States', 'two', 'young', 'students', 'class', 'representatives', 'are', 'allowed', 'be', 'present', 'teachers', 'hold', 'confidential', 'discussions', 'assessing', 'fellow', 'students', 'performance', 'One', 'then', 'confidentiality', 'telling', 'one', 'particular', 'student', 'been', 'said', 'account', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'central', 'crisis', 'movie.It', 'pretty', 'absurd', 'allow', '14-year-old', 'kids', 'sit', 'inon', 'such', 'sensitive', 'discussions.This', 'quite', 'long', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'are', 'many', 'differences', 'French', 'American', 'education', 'systems', 'also', 'disturbing', 'similarities', 'kids', 'are', 'kids', 'everywhere']",N/A
1258091,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002AG2NTI,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","I think, for me, the most impressionable aspect of this film is that there are no Hollywood endings.  Yes, for a film that prances around in the genre that helped Michelle Pfeiffer, Hilary Swank and many more `help their students fix their lives', `Entre les Murs' brilliantly exposes the truth behind that myth.I have not read the memoir (of sorts) written by the films star, Francois Begaudeau, but after watching this harrowing film I think I just might seek it out.The film centers on a single school year, where Mr. Marin attempts to reach some of his students the best way he knows how.  He is sincere and earnest and yet the apathy around him has certainly tainted his actions.  He is sharp at times, even if it's hidden by a smirk or a chuckle.  He is judgmental, yet he is also hopeful.  He is not a `new teacher' brought in to take on a group of students no one else wants to deal with, he is a veteran teacher who is continually trying to make a difference, no matter how hard it becomes.The film beautifully contrasts the difficulties on the teachers as well as the students.  There is no talk of home life really, and there is no overly dramatic elements like drug abuse and so on.  This is a film strictly about the public school system and the film brilliantly layers itself with questions that present a great debate for the audience.  Does the school system really work for everyone?  My friends and I have had this discussion plenty of times.  Children are so different and so not every student is going to respond to the same methods.  Some need a little more guidance, some need more freedom, some need a stern hand, some are more visual, some are quick learners...the list goes on and on.  I think possibly the most important moment in the film comes when a single student approaches Marin to confess that she hadn't learnt anything all year.  When she approaches Marin you realize that you've seen her, but you've never heard a single word come out of her mouth before this scene.  You may not even know her name.  She is that quiet girl who tried hard but failed to really soak in anything.With an ending that speaks volumes in itself (this is life, not some movie), `Entre les Murs' is a phenomenal tour-de-force of a film.I had heard (and I may be wrong so don't quote me on this) that the cast is primarily high school students themselves, not genuine actors.  I haven't found any avenue to confirm that, but if that is true then it was a genius move.  The cast seems so fresh and natural in their environment.  They feel like real kids reacting to real situations.  Their arrogance doesn't feel rehearsed but it feels naturally guarded.  When one of the girls tells Marin that she wants him punished there is a smirk on her face that feels fragile, almost insecure, as if she is still concerned her plan will backfire.Or maybe she even fears that she has gone too far.Some, obviously, have found this film overrated and boring.  I feel for them, for I don't think they got the film.  This is the definition of a character study, and director Laurent Cantet studies these characters very, very well.",5,Honest...,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,3125,"['think', 'most', 'impressionable', 'aspect', 'film', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'endings', 'Yes', 'film', 'around', 'genre', 'helped', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'many', 'more', 'help', 'students', 'fix', 'lives', 'Entre', 'Murs', 'brilliantly', 'truth', 'myth.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'memoir', 'sorts', 'written', 'films', 'star', 'Francois', 'Begaudeau', 'watching', 'harrowing', 'film', 'think', 'just', 'might', 'seek', 'out.The', 'film', 'centers', 'single', 'school', 'year', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 'reach', 'students', 'best', 'way', 'how', 'sincere', 'earnest', 'yet', 'apathy', 'certainly', 'tainted', 'actions', 'sharp', 'times', 'even', 'hidden', 'smirk', 'chuckle', 'judgmental', 'yet', 'also', 'hopeful', 'not', 'new', 'teacher', 'brought', 'take', 'group', 'students', 'one', 'else', 'deal', 'veteran', 'teacher', 'who', 'continually', 'trying', 'make', 'difference', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'film', 'beautifully', 'difficulties', 'teachers', 'as', 'well', 'students', 'talk', 'home', 'life', 'really', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'drug', 'abuse', 'so', 'film', 'strictly', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'questions', 'present', 'great', 'debate', 'audience', 'school', 'system', 'really', 'work', 'everyone', 'friends', 'have', 'had', 'discussion', 'plenty', 'times', 'Children', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'so', 'not', 'student', 'going', 'respond', 'same', 'methods', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'guidance', 'need', 'more', 'freedom', 'need', 'stern', 'hand', 'are', 'more', 'visual', 'are', 'quick', 'learners', 'list', 'think', 'possibly', 'most', 'important', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'single', 'student', 'approaches', 'Marin', 'confess', 'had', ""n't"", 'learnt', 'anything', 'year', 'When', 'Marin', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'single', 'word', 'come', 'mouth', 'scene', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'name', 'quiet', 'girl', 'who', 'tried', 'hard', 'failed', 'really', 'soak', 'anything.With', 'ending', 'volumes', 'life', 'not', 'movie', 'Entre', 'Murs', 'phenomenal', 'tour-de-force', 'film.I', 'had', 'heard', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'quote', 'cast', 'primarily', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'not', 'genuine', 'actors', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'avenue', 'confirm', 'true', 'then', 'was', 'genius', 'move', 'cast', 'so', 'fresh', 'natural', 'environment', 'feel', 'real', 'kids', 'reacting', 'real', 'situations', 'arrogance', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rehearsed', 'naturally', 'guarded', 'When', 'one', 'girls', 'Marin', 'punished', 'smirk', 'face', 'feels', 'fragile', 'almost', 'insecure', 'still', 'concerned', 'plan', 'will', 'backfire.Or', 'maybe', 'even', 'gone', 'too', 'far.Some', 'obviously', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'overrated', 'boring', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'film', 'definition', 'character', 'study', 'director', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'studies', 'characters', 'very', 'very', 'well']",N/A
1258092,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B002AG2NTI,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","This is the movie thatFreedom Writers (Full Screen Edition)wishes it was.  That Hollywood product depicts a broad-brush view of the challenge of urban education and the single educator swooping in to save the day, affect change and battle evilness, which is typified in the form of non-caring, obstructionist administration and fellow teachers.  Every adult other than Hillary Swank (well, save Scott Glenn as her Dad) is cast as someone either doubting her vision, questioning her sanity or outright looking to undermine her at every turn.By contrast, 'The Class' depicts the struggle to educate as a never-ending battle with small victories and many setbacks, many not of the incremental variety.  And, as in many French movies, we're brought behind the scenes into the machinations of the workplace.  It's not pretty: intrigue; factionalism; debate; process; fatigue.  Nothing is easy.  Everyone's fighting the good fight, but real life is filled with shades of grey, not simple black and white.It's notable that the denouement of the movie is not an uplifting Hollywood moment, but rather the expulsion of one of the main students we've been following.  The film's realism is accentuated by teacher Franois B&eacute;gaudeau, playing a very-close-to-real-life version of himself in this film based directly on his book.

1258094,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B002AG2NTI,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[3, 4]","As a former teacher, I had high hopes for this highly touted French docudrama about an inexperienced teacher coming to grips with his rebellious inner-city pupils.  Yet, `The Class` fails to deliver a plausible drama or an instructive and insightful documentary.  Instead, it falls somewhere in between, achieving neither.While the film is full of the drama inherent in any classroom environment, director Laurent Cantet fails to exploit and examine the student/ teacher interplay thoroughly.  Rather, much of the `drama` in the film lapses into childish `melodrama,` much of it stemming from the foolish behavior of the rookie teacher, Mr. Marin, played by the originator of the film, Francois Begaudeau.Some of the situations Mr. Marin and his student find themselves in are indeed fascinating and will bring about a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for any teacher watching.  For instance, when the students make the inevitable inquires into their teacher`s life, Mr. Marin handles himself and the queries with aplomb, subtlety, and sophistication.  In another situation, Mr. Marin confronts a disrespectful student after class.  Here, the teacher`s wounded pride and frustration are palpable and will strike a chord with many an educator.  Unfortunately, Cantet jumps the film onward without delving any further.  It would have been fascinating to examine the student`s motives, which to be fair, are somewhat laid out, in a letter Marin receives after the incident.Some of film`s staffroom scenes are just plain ridiculous.  The overacting here on the part of some of Marin`s colleagues can be partly excused by the documentary element of the film.  To its credit, `The Class` strives for complete realism.  Cantet uses actual teachers and students in the film.`The Class`s` central conflict is when two student officers spread misinformation from the teachers` grading meeting.  While the school`s effort to be transparent is laudable it is doubtful that such student representatives would have the needed maturity to handle confidential information like student evaluations.When the rumors spread about how Mr. Marin supposedly denigrated a student`s academic potential, the `class` explodes into anarchy.  Realistic yes, but the conflict is fueled by Mr. Marin`s foolish behavior.  Every teacher loses their cool and says things they wish they hadn`t, but Marin indulges in a shouting match with his students where some unfortunate words are shared.  Being immature kids, the students hear what they want from Marin`s tirade and as a group, turn against their teacher.From here onwards, Marin`s class disintegrates into chaos.  An angry student who feels insulted storms from class and injures another student in the process.  Brought before a disciplinary committee he is soon expelled despite Mr. Marin`s, ever the idealist, valiant attempts at mitigating the punishment.  The film ends with the class`s final day, each student sharing what they have learned (or not) from the year.  The expulsion and the unfortunate student are all but forgotten.What to make of this audacious experiment?  Its heart is in the right place and few films of a similar vein show the mayhem and majesty of the classroom quite like this film does.  Yet, in final analysis, the film leaves you wanting more, unsatisfied and somewhat exasperated at being subject to so much `drama` sans le explication.",4,Not enough,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,3388,"['former', 'teacher', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'highly', 'touted', 'French', 'docudrama', 'inexperienced', 'teacher', 'coming', 'grips', 'rebellious', 'inner-city', 'pupils', 'Class', 'fails', 'deliver', 'plausible', 'drama', 'instructive', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'Instead', 'somewhere', 'achieving', 'film', 'full', 'drama', 'inherent', 'classroom', 'environment', 'director', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'exploit', 'examine', 'student/', 'teacher', 'interplay', 'thoroughly', 'Rather', 'much', 'drama', 'film', 'childish', 'melodrama', 'much', 'stemming', 'foolish', 'behavior', 'rookie', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 'played', 'originator', 'film', 'Francois', 'Begaudeau.Some', 'situations', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 'student', 'find', 'are', 'indeed', 'fascinating', 'will', 'bring', 'about', 'sense', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'teacher', 'watching', 'instance', 'when', 'students', 'make', 'inevitable', 'inquires', 'teacher', 's', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 'queries', 'aplomb', 'subtlety', 'sophistication', 'situation', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 'disrespectful', 'student', 'class', 'Here', 'teacher', 's', 'wounded', 'pride', 'frustration', 'are', 'palpable', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'many', 'educator', 'Unfortunately', 'Cantet', 'film', 'onward', 'delving', 'further', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'examine', 'student', 's', 'motives', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'somewhat', 'laid', 'out', 'letter', 'Marin', 'incident.Some', 'film', 's', 'staffroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'overacting', 'here', 'part', 'Marin', 's', 'colleagues', 'can', 'be', 'partly', 'excused', 'documentary', 'element', 'film', 'credit', 'Class', 'strives', 'complete', 'realism', 'Cantet', 'actual', 'teachers', 'students', 'film.', 'Class', 's', 'central', 'conflict', 'when', 'two', 'student', 'officers', 'spread', 'misinformation', 'teachers', 'grading', 'meeting', 'school', 's', 'effort', 'be', 'transparent', 'laudable', 'doubtful', 'such', 'student', 'representatives', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'maturity', 'handle', 'confidential', 'information', 'student', 'evaluations.When', 'rumors', 'spread', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 'supposedly', 'denigrated', 'student', 's', 'academic', 'potential', 'class', 'explodes', 'anarchy', 'Realistic', 'yes', 'conflict', 'fueled', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 's', 'foolish', 'behavior', 'teacher', 'cool', 'things', 'wish', 'hadn', 't', 'Marin', 'shouting', 'match', 'students', 'where', 'unfortunate', 'words', 'are', 'shared', 'Being', 'immature', 'kids', 'students', 'hear', 'what', 'want', 'Marin', 's', 'tirade', 'group', 'turn', 'teacher.From', 'here', 'onwards', 'Marin', 's', 'class', 'chaos', 'angry', 'student', 'who', 'insulted', 'storms', 'class', 'student', 'process', 'Brought', 'disciplinary', 'committee', 'soon', 'expelled', 'Mr.', 'Marin', 's', 'ever', 'idealist', 'valiant', 'attempts', 'mitigating', 'punishment', 'film', 'class', 's', 'final', 'day', 'student', 'sharing', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'not', 'year', 'expulsion', 'unfortunate', 'student', 'are', 'forgotten.What', 'make', 'audacious', 'experiment', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'few', 'films', 'similar', 'vein', 'show', 'mayhem', 'majesty', 'classroom', 'quite', 'film', 'final', 'analysis', 'film', 'wanting', 'more', 'unsatisfied', 'somewhat', 'exasperated', 'being', 'subject', 'so', 'much', 'drama', 'sans', 'le', 'explication']",N/A

1258096,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002AG2NTI,Chris Pandolfi,"[70, 72]","The first thing director Laurnet Cantet did right when making ""The Class (Entre les Murs)"" was asking the author of the original novel, Franois B&eacute;gaudeau, to write the film's screenplay. He then went a step further and cast B&eacute;gaudeau as the teacher, M. Marin, which is only fitting since his novel is a semi-autobiographical account of his experiences as a literature teacher in a Parisian inner-city middle school. ""The Class"" is telling a story, yet it often feels as authentic as a documentary, not just because the actors are incredibly convincing, but also because it has been stripped of traditional cinematic embellishments. There are no special effects or elaborate camera tricks. There isn't even a basic musical score. There are just the actors and the classroom set, and we're watching the events naturally unfold.I suspect most Western audiences will respond to this movie, despite the fact that it takes place in France. It tackles issues many students and teachers will find relatable, not the least of which is the sense that bridging the gap between student and teacher is sometimes impossible. Marin starts the semester with the hope that he will connect with his multiracial students, who live in urban areas and come from lower income families. But as time goes on, he slowly realizes that they don't want to connect with him. I got the sense that neither side was able to see the opposing point of view; Marin has a hard time understanding why his students don't want to learn, whereas the students have a hard time understanding why Marin wants them to conform.Take, for example, the fact that one of Marin's lessons covers sentence structure, which involves highly confusing terms like ""imperfect predicate,"" or something along those lines. The students take none of this in, but when you stop and think about it, does anyone? In the grand scheme of things, diagramming a sentence hardly seems like a necessary skill ... unless, of course, you're planning on becoming a linguistics professor. It's not that Marin's students are stupid--they just don't see what the point is. Besides, it's not as if society wants them to be anything more than what they project; it seems that when you're automatically written off as a bad kid, there's little point in trying to be something else.Mind you, none of this is directly stated. This movie is more interested in implications, which is to say that we have no real idea why there's such a disassociation between the students and the faculty. All we know is that it exists, and neither side knows how to make the other understand where they're coming from. And then there's the fact that most of the faculty base disciplinary decisions on statistical facts, and whenever a student faces a behavioral committee, they hear only generic spiels about how he or she isn't living up to his or her potential. This isn't quite the way Marin works; he bases disciplinary decisions more on emotion, which ultimately does more to harm his reputation than improve it.There's a fascinating sense of camaraderie amongst the students, as if they all share the belief that teachers are the enemy. One of the most troublesome is Souleymane (Franck Kieta), the son of Mali immigrants with a bit of an anger management problem. There are also Esmeralda (Esmeralda Ouertani), who's of Middle Eastern descent and never feels valued by Marin, and Khoumba (Rachel Regulier), whose attitude seems to have soured since the last semester; just as smart as they are temperamental, both girls seem to know just how to use Marin's less conservative teaching methods against him. The only distant character is Wei (Wei Huang), the brainy son of Chinese immigrants. We don't learn much about him, although we suspect that his scholastic achievements are influenced more by duty than by a need to prove himself.One of the best achievements of ""The Class"" is making us feel like we know the characters, and this is despite the fact that personal details are mostly kept hidden. We know, for example, that Marin is approachable as a human being, and he gets along just fine with the rest of the faculty, many of who are just as frustrated by their students as he is. But when it comes to being a mentor, something is seriously lacking; he can ""teach"" in the strictest sense of the word, but that doesn't mean his students are actually learning anything.An important metaphor is introduced towards the end of the film, but to describe it would do you a great disservice. Let it suffice to say that the final few shots say volumes about the relationship between students and teachers, or lack thereof. It may not be immediately obvious, but if you pay close attention, I'm sure you will pick up on it. It's a refreshing approach to the typical Hollywood version of a school drama, where eager but inexperienced teachers are able to reach out to their at-risk students and forever change their lives. This isn't to say that ""The Class"" is a French version of school drama; it feels so genuine that genre doesn't even come into play. It's a compelling character study that enables us to see various points of view all at once, and it does so without lingering on extraneous details. I'd say that's quite an achievement, considering how easily it could have gone wrong.",5,"The More He Teaches, the Less They Learn",1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,5307,"['first', 'thing', 'director',

Real students and teachers, not professional actors, play the roles in the film. Among other things, the film is a study of the ripple effects of immigration in France as seen through the lens of its public schools. The class has students from Morocco, the Caribbean, China and more. In addition to their raging hormones, slang vocabulary, personalized dress codes, identification with sports teams, and overall disinterest in school, the students struggle with race, class and religion. Then there are the poignant parent-teacher conferences and collegial faculty meetings. In a major part of the class drama, the sulk, sass and sarcasm of a student from Mali named Suleyman provokes a class crisis. The Class is not a documentary, but it's so authentic that it feels like one; it was the official French entry for best foreign film and won the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

1258099,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002AG2NTI,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The Class, Entre Les Murs, is a seductive movie. It is a very difficult movie to review, since there are so many things going on, so many good things to say, so many nuances, and so many layers.Laurent Cantet has captured the spirit, the pain, the elation, of the classroom in a high school. He has done something no other director has ever accomplished, a realistic view of the mind of a teacher and a classroom. This film looks like a documentary initially. We get to know the students and Francois the teacher better and better, and it becomes clear, this is a scripted film. But yet there's another voice that says, these are kids in this film, maybe they are 16, but they are kids; all acting incredibly well - if this is a scripted film. In the end, this film is both, a bit documentary (or more accurately, improvised), a bit scripted. No matter - this is one heck of a powerful film.This is the story of Francois Marin, a 4/3 French teacher in an inner city school; the 20&egrave;me Arrondissement way eastern never seen by tourists Paris; (if I'm not mistaken, this is the area where the riots occurred a few years ago over immigration laws). The grade roughly translates to 8th grade in the US - these are supposed to be 13-15 year old kids. The film follows a scholastic year, from the first day of school to the very last. Francois is a slightly young teacher and tries to navigate his way through truly teaching his students literature and the French language; and dealing with students with some significant personal issues.Ah the summary, any that I read, and even the one I just wrote; they just don't do this film justice. This is an intense mental drama between the faculty of the school, Mr. Marin, and his students. There are moments of incredible triumph where a student says something amazing, and deep dispair when the students and faculty just fall into their easy pitiful lives of doing the wrong things.I loved this film so much. My wife, a teacher for almost 30 years, also loved this film. She said that the film was very accurate emotionally, especially as a new young teacher would feel. But similar things happen today.The great parts of this film.It won the Palme D'Or (or best picture) at Cannes in 2008. The children in this film all attended the screening in Cannes and got to walk the red carpet.The movie is based on a novel written by Franois B&eacute;gaudeau. Who also wrote the script for the film, along with the director and Robin Campillo. And then even more remarkable, he starred as Francois Marin, the French teacher. How many movies can be credited with that much buy in by the original author of a book?Laurent Cantent chose to use real students and teachers for this film. The movie was scripted and then tested and improvised by the cast in a classroom before any filming even started. He took the time to get the dialog right, believeable, and honest. While watching this film, remember, these are not professional actors.The subtitles were done exactly right to get a PG-13 rating. The huge advantage film makers have with foreign language, they can tailor the translation to get the rating they want as long as the images don't betray the desired rating. The French language is really really course. A taste of a real translation can be seen in the bonus features.The cautions.This is by no meansStand and Deliver, orAkeelah and the Bee (Widescreen Edition)- in their own rights wonderful portraits making a very different point. The Class is a portrait of a teacher struggling to teach. The other two films are about teachers trying to achieve a very narrow goal - passion around math and winning a competition; and passion around spelling and winning a competition. In many ways the American films are a classroom Rocky. The Class is an intimate study of the classroom.The French school system is completely and utterly different from the US school system. The struggles Francois faces are universal. The manner in which he approaches those struggles, the language he uses in class, the way the students act, are all unique to the French. This is not, as it may be advertised, a view to American inner city schools.The film is 2 hours and 9 minutes long. Its possible there are a few slow spots here or there where the film could be tightened up, but I think the film is exactly the right length. The cinematography is just absolutely spot on. There's a lot of handheld shots (they filmed with three cameras in the classroom to get coverage - and it appears that all three were handheld); but the film never had that annoying random movement disease. Camera movement was deliberate and with reason. Sound was perfect for this film; its all about dialog and it was recorded very well.The DVD - oh my the DVD.In one sitting I watched all 2 hours 9 minutes of this film. I then immediately opened up the bonus features. The best made, bar none, making of featurette is on this DVD. At almost 42 minutes it is a treatise on many of the unique techniques used to make this film. The last 10 minutes was a bit rough to sit through, just from sitting for so long. It does include the children at Cannes, a remarkable moment.There are two very very very detailed discussions of two scenes by the director and Francois Begaudeau. The first, The Imperfect of the Subjunctive, at 15 minutes is almost overload - but still remarkable with the insights.  The second, The Courtyard Dispute, at 8 minutes just lost my attention. The scene was so intense in the film, I could not bring myself to see it dissected.A word on language. The DVD is presented with English or Spanish subtitles (they can be turned off). Three soundtracks are available, native language French, English, or Spanish. In my opinion, it would be a crime to watch this film dubbed in English. I listened to about 10 minutes of the dubbing and it is so hideous, absolutely no feeling, horrible voices, and the well recorded ambient sound is ruined. Please, I beg you, watch this film in French even if you don't understand one word of French, and turn on the subtitles.The Class is a remarkable film. It is a view inside a place everyone has seen, but few really see from this vantage point, the eyes of a teacher. It is a moving film, presented on a DVD with amazing bonus features.

1258100,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002AG2NTI,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 4]","The Class (Entre les murs) was the big surprise at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Palme D'or, the film surprised many people due to the way it was filmed.  Almost like watching a real documentary but a film based on real situations that teachers and students face.The film is based on the book by Francois Begeaudeau (who writes the screenplay and stars as the main teacher - Francois Marin) and is directed by Laurent Cantet (""Vers ke sud"" , ""L'emploi du temps"" and ""Ressources humaines"").  To keep with the realness of today's children, the film brought in real students who took part in an acting school in which they learned improvisation but had a chance to be part of an actual film.If anything, the film give the viewer a chance to see how the French education system is and the challenges that teachers and students face.  For one, the students are becoming more multicultural and in this film, children who have parents from China, Mali, Morocco and other countries form a melting pot in their classroom but it's not exactly smooth sailing.The teachers who do all they can to reach their students and earn their respect but also knowing to cross the line as educator and a normal adult, especially when challenged.The film revolves around Mr. Francois Marin, a teacher in Paris that teaches French at Dolton High School.  He's a caring teacher for a young group of 13-14 year old students and really wants to know more about them but also to educate them but knowing that today's students are not the same as when he was in school.  In fact, for some of these students, they see things differently than students in the past.In one scene, Marin uses a typical name of ""Bill"" to describe a story in class but his students take offense to that.  The class which is multicultural question why he uses the name of ""Bill"" when he could use a name that is not so ""white"" such as Aissata or Fatou.The film also gives us a glance of how students view being in France but also being true to their own heritage.  In one scene, the students get into a heated discussion about soccer and how one student who they call Caribbean supports the French and calls himself a France while other Black students disagree and are upset that he as looked at himself as a French and not of his country.The same could go for a student named Wei who is Chinese who lives in France but doesn't agree with French culture and thus he has closed himself off and plays video games and stays home because he doesn't identify himself as one of the French.Another scene deals with major challenges for educators especially  for students who become too much of a problem.  Would expelling do the student any good.  Teachers who have to face difficult decisions.  Especially knowing that these students can be sent back to their original country where education is much worse and life would be even more difficult.A few of the students play a major role in the film such as:Esmerelda - The student who tends to be mouthy and talks a lot in class and is not afraid to speak her mind about things.Khouma - A friend of Esmerelda and a problem student for Dr. Marin who is shocked to that she was such a smart teenager the year before but all of a sudden, she has become his most difficult and challenges him in front of everyone in class.Boubacar - An opinionated student who tends to get in the middle of arguments/debates but is quite bright.Wei - The Chinese student who doesn't identify himself as a typical French and is often criticized by his classmates.Souleymane - The student who never does his homework, doesn't bring things to class and is often the student who gets in trouble quite a bit.  But despite his bad habits, Dr. Marin wants him to achieve and reach his potential.  Marin tries to give him chances despite his fellow educators not having the same belief.There are just a few of the teenagers in Mr. Marin's class but its the class as a whole.  How these children are expected to give respect but yet feel the education system is not giving them any respect and with changing times, how school for today's teachers and students are not the same as things were 10 or more years ago.""The Class"" is very real and the fact that the students play their characters to the best perfection in this improvised experimentation or project for this film, the results are just wonderful!VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Class"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1).  It's important to let people know that this is not the type of film you are exactly looking for picture quality.  The majority of the film is shot inside a classroom, outside the classroom and in the teacher's lounge.  For the most part, the film looks clean and very good on Blu-ray.The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 3.0.  For the most part, the film is dialogue based.  All front channel and center channel speaker utilization and really this film has no need to utilize any major sound effects that would need the surround channels thus only a 3.0 lossless soundtrack.But there are some scenes such as the students playing soccer outdoors or the noise in a classroom that could have utilized surround or rear surrounds but again, I don't think this film really needed it.I watched the film primarily in French but the film is also presented with an English Dolby TrueHD 3.0 dub.  For the most part, the dub work was just a bit hard to watch, especially knowing the mannerisms of the students and how they really sound like.Part of the realism of ""The Class"" is that the class showcases a multicultural group of students.  Even though they speak French, you hear part of their culture through their voices.  For the English dub, everyone sounds quite American with similar voices with some talking normal and some talking all street.  The English dub just didn't work for me but for those who can't stand reading subtitles, then this audio option is available for you.The film is also presented in Spanish LCR (Discrete Surround) and as for subtitles, the film is presented with English, English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Class"" features the following special features:* Audio and Video Scene Commentaries with Director Laurent Cantet and Writer/ACtor Francois Begaudeau - Three scenes with commentary: ""The Imperfect of the Subjunctine"" (15:12), ""The Courtyard Dispute"" (8:28) and ""The Disiplinary Board"" (15:55).  Both Cantet discussing what they enjoyed about the scene and what they wanted to accomplish.* Making of The Class - (41:43) A very informative behind-the-scenes of the making of ""The Class"".  From how the film was shot at Francoise Dolto High School and to achieve the realism, the filmmakers had organized improv workshops in which 40 students came to the workshop every Wednesday and were taught by Francois Begaudeau and how they took part in this project which became ""The Class"".  Also, the film being premiered in Paris and then the 2008 Cannes Film Festival with the crew and all young actors taking part of the event to the winning of the Palme D'or.* Actors' Workshop - (30:05) Exclusive to the Blu-ray release of this film, we get to see an actual workshop and how the Director, the teacher and the children work around certain stories and become their character.  How the director and Francois Begaudeau were able to get the children to be natural and some who were almost like their characters.* Actors' Self-Portraits - (12:03)  An exclusive for this Blu-ray version of the film. The young students of the film do their ""self-portrait"" (like their student counterparts had to do in the film) and talk about themselves, their likes and dislikes.  What I found quite interesting is how the students are almost like their film counterparts and gives you an idea of the kind of realism that everyone brought to the film.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:24) The original theatrical trailer for the film.* Trailers - Trailers for upcoming Sony Pictures Home Entertainment releases.* BD-Live - The film is BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Class"" was definitely a unique film experience.  A film that is filmed unlike any other film and utilizing real-life students acting the way they are in class but yet improvising in order to create a film.Personally, I can see how challenging this film must have been but most of all capturing the nuances of today's classroom between teacher and students.  How the different cultures bring something different into the classroom and things have changed.  I can see how all these students can be seen as students in a French school but for these students, many don't identify with the French system and where teachers expect the respect from their students, these students want the same type of respect and in doing so, act out their grievances right on the spot.Back then, if we had something bad to say, we talked about after class with other students but these students are not afraid to be vocal to their teachers.  Asking them straight out if they are homosexual, challenging them on why they are teaching things a way of proper speaking when people around them do not talk that way.  And it's no longer one or two people, the whole class joins in the debate and let out their emotion.With that being said, that is what makes ""The Class"" so significant.  The film captures the real atmosphere of children today and how things are in their classroom.  This is not a film that is dramatic, suspenseful or mysterious.  It's a straightforward film of a teacher and his fellow teachers dealing with today's students.  And how today's students are.  In a way, it's almost documentary-like but it's not.Because of that, this film is not going to be for everyone.  It's an award winning film and  is appreciated for its filmmaking and realness but for those expecting a deeper storyline or something along the lines of a Hollywood film about teachers trying to help inner-city students and achieving the impossible by sacrifice, this film is nothing like that.In fact, I wished the film would have pursued certain stories brought up of several students.  For example, with the student of Wei, his mother is an illegal citizen and is being deported.  The teachers are upset about how a good student like Wei must face this challenge but yet Wei is hardly shown in the film to show any emotional distraught over his mother's predicament, nor do we see anything else come out of it.Granted, the character of Wei was not among the major students being featured in the film but there are other storylines that feature children who have challenging situations and I suppose like real-life, the film wants us to see how these teachers behave when things happen but yet, this is not a Hollywood film where there are many happy endings.  This film captures the true nature of a how things are in school, things happen... life goes on for both the educators and their students and next thing you know, a whole new school year with new students.As for the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray release is impressive in that it shows us the behind-the-scenes of how this was all accomplished and what was accomplished in my mind was quite magnificent.  There are two Blu-ray exclusive features and these two additional features definitely gives us a very good behind-the-scenes look of how this film was made but again, how these students are like their student counterparts.  They may be improvising but they bring a lot of their real-life persona to their characters.Again, this film is not for everyone.  But for those who want a different kind of film and are open to learning about real-life situations that is happening in France but also many other countries through its education system, this film may be an eye opener for some and for those who with open minds can find something quite enjoyable with ""The Class"".  Again, it's almost like a documentary, so because it's an award-winner, it's important to let people know that this not your typical film.Nevertheless, ""The Class"" is film on Blu-ray that I definitely recommend!",5,Blu-ray:  Magnificent film with a Blu-ray release that has a exclusives not included on the DVD version,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,12061,"['Class', 'Entre', 'murs', 'was',

1258101,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B002AG2NTI,Doug Anderson,"[2, 5]","Dangerous Minds and Freedom Writers were about determined white teachers who came from relatively privileged backgrounds but who nonetheless recognized that the best way to reach out to and to teach inner-city youth was to allow them to deal with their real-life struggles in the classroom. Both of these teachers accomplished this by employing unorthodox teaching methods to reach and to teach what most considered to be unreachable and unteachable kids. Both were individuals who challenged the status quo (""these kids are unteachable, don't waste your time on them""), taught their students that language was an empowering tool, and taught a dysfuntional school system a lesson or two as well. The Class, on the other hand, is about a determined teacher who is caught in a bind. He employs many of the same methods that Michelle Pfieffer employed in Dangerous Minds and that Hilary Swank employed in Freedom Writers, but his students are not nearly as receptive, and he does not have the endless patience and unwavering faith in his mission that they did. In fact, one of his problems is that his mission is much more complicated because his students all come from different countries. His official task is to teach his inner-city students the official language of their adoptive country, but very few of his multicultural students really embrace their adoptive country's culture or language. They certainly do not see learning standardized French as a means of empowerment, most of them do not even define themselves as ""French.""The real issue that both teacher and students are grappling with (racism in the form of an outdated Eurocentric educational system) is never openly discussed in class. In science and math class this is less of an issue; in English class, however, it is always an issue, but since it is never openly discussed, the root of the problem is never addressed and the classroom and the school system remain dysfunctional cultural battlegrounds.The same thing happens everyday in The Class: the students arrive, the European teacher attempts to teach yet another Eurocentric text or lesson to a non-European student body, the students grow frustrated and roll their eyes or fall asleep, and the atmosphere of the classroom slowly deteriorates. Although they are sometimes combatative with one another, the students care more for each other than they do for their teacher who they perceive to be their cultural enemy. Unfortunately, the teacher's behavior only reinforces this sense of cultural warfare.Its a brilliant film because it captures the Sisyphisean efforts (wrongheaded as those efforts might be) and growing frustration of the European teacher with his non-European students as well as the growing frustration of the non-European students with their European teacher, but its painful to watch.What we learn from the film is that what is really needed, not only in multicultural inner-city neighborhoods but in all neighborhoods, are schools that are staffed with teachers who are trained to teach a multicultural student body multicultural content.  Otherwise schools send the same message that society sends and that is that there is only one culture and that all other cultures do not merit attention, study, or respect. The Class could very well be entitled The Class System (as the teacher, whether he realizes it or not, is reinforcing class as well as cultural barriers). Its no wonder the non-European kids refuse to cooperate with a European educational system that has no place for them, their social class, or their culture.

1258102,A2FHM5FB0BXKGA,B002AG2NTI,"Dr. Elaine O. Chaika ""book, movie, tech lover""","[1, 5]","I was fully prepared to love this.  As a once upon a time teacher in inner city schools, I have been disgusted by the spate of Hollywoood movies in which a rookie teacher comes into a school full of future murderers, rapists, robbers, and drug addicts and with  a lot of faith, all on the teacher's part, and hard work, again on the teacher's part, she or he transforms a class into Wunderkinder.  Well, I've been there. Done that. And it's just not possible.  At least as a rule. So, the idea of a teacher who just can't make headway with such students appealed to me.  However, what I found here were receptive, open lively students and a teacher so busy scorning them, he misses golden opportunities that the students themselves give him, opportunities to really engage them and get them exploring their world.  Since I am a linguist (who eventually ended up as a college prof), I was especially intrigued by his teaching of the French subjunctive.  The kids didn't throw spitballs at him or just go to sleep.  Instead, they raised the very real questions of ""Who uses that?"" and ""Why would I want to talk that way? Nobody I know talks that way.""  Bingo!  Way open for ""What would you say instead to get that message across?"" ""What's the difference between your rules of speech and this?""  Pretend to be in a situation where somebody did use the subjunctive.""  ""Let's act it out.""  ""Now YOU act like the person who uses it.""  Voila!  My experience has shown me that they mysteriously can use it if they are pretending.  The way is also open for a host of subjects about how language changes, people speak different dialects, and people speak differently in different situations.

1258106,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002AG2NTI,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","THE CLASS ('ENTRE LES MURS') is more of an experience than a film.  Based on the book 'Entre Les Murs' by teacher Franois B&eacute;gaudeau who also wrote the screenplay and stars in the film as the unique teacher Franois Marin, this thoughtful and challenging story is presented in a style that could only be termed 'French verismo'.  If it feels like a documentary for the first part, that is to the credit of the author and the director Laurent Cantet: we, the viewers are taken into the classroom where the majority of the film takes place, lingering there through discussions between teacher and the varied ethnic group of students who challenge (with good thought) the teaching techniques and subjects of discussion in Marin's days of attempting to 'educate' a somewhat reluctant audience.  The subject of the course may be French, but the incongruities of language spread into areas of conflict of the meaning of words and the 'out of date' subjects of grammar that occupy Marin's course outline.Another fascinating aspect of this film about education in schools populated by 'difficult students' is the use of the device of entr'acte - diversions from the classroom into the teachers' lounge where we learn even more about the education and varied sociological systems and age and experience differences among the faculty influence that is at the core of this film. It all sounds and seems so extemporaneous that it makes the messages conveyed all the more powerful.  Many will find this film too 'talky': there are almost no excursions outside the school and certainly no 'sidebars' to show the extracurricular lives of the mixed group of well drawn and acted students.  The story unfolds slowly, like a conversation, and is offered by a set of 'actors' who disappear completely into their roles.  This is one of the few 'classroom films' that elects to inform rather than to preach and features a teacher who is as fallible as the students.  Many lessons are here in this Class.

It portrays a dedicated and talented, but very imperfect, educator trying to excite and engage a unruly group of diverse kids in learning.  On that level, it is moving, effective and sometimes heartbreaking.I'd be very cautious, however, about being seduced into thinking it's an accurate documentary of the classroom, the teacher, or the class.  It's twice removed from the grit of the classroom, a film based on a memoir of a teaching year.  So it's a movie, not a camera-catches-all documentary.  That said, The Class, assuming a basic accuracy, is a pretty devastating indictment of an inflexible French public education system applied to a diverse, largely immigrant student population.I'd be even more cautious about seeing the film as a mirror to US inner city education, as many of the press reviews I've read seem to assume.  Yes, we certainly have similar issues, but the point those reviewers miss -- I think -- is that we are not alone in grappling with the demands of a diverse population on education and, in fact, we may be doing better than many countries -- as we should.

He portrays (and really is) a teacher at an inner-city Paris school who has to deal with a multi-ethnic composition of students in his French class.Repeatedly, he attempts to be their ""pal"" until their behavior becomes intolerable and then he lays down the law. It is a given that students look for consistency in a teacher since their own moods can be so volatile from day to day. His behavior is as inconsistent as theirs. In addition, he incessantly argues with them and tolerates their sarcasm, insults, and other inappropriate behaviors up to the point where he loses control of his own frustration and anger. Since when does a teacher leave the classroom unattended to walk a student to the Principal's office? All of this adds up to a text book example of incompetent classroom management.There are no memorable examples of his so-called teaching skills and yet in the last few minutes of the film the students magically report how much they've learned and sound like they might be on the fast track to becoming Rhodes scholars some day.Although its established early on that Francois Begeaudeau is in his fourth year of teaching at the school, he comes across like an ill-prepared first year teacher who doesn't have a clue.

In so doing, they seem to arrive at a middle ground between what society deems to be important for these kids to learn, and what actually IS relevant to them in their lives and experiences, not unlike a dialogue between interlocutors and Socrates, to whom they later even pay tribute with a mention of Plato's 'Republic'.

I attended school in France for a year and have a great interest in French culture. One of my very favorite films is The Chorus, about another teacher who faced a class of problem students in a French boarding school.The film held my interest but I cannot say that I enjoyed it.  I found it almost depressing and I didn't understand why until I watched the added features and learned that this was not a real documentary.  The students were coached in improvisation and then the script was written from their sessions.The writer/actor/teacher said, in an interview that he didn't include much positive material in which students gave correct answers or worked quietly at their desks.  I can see that they wanted to avoid a repeat of ""To Sir with Love"" but I think they overdid it with the negativity.  After watching these kids give the teacher a hard time for more than two hours, I found it hard to sustain any sympathy for them. We were supposed to feel empathy for the ""problem"" child who was eventually expelled, but, by that point, I was happy to see him leave. When the film was over there was no sense that anyone had learned much, if anything. The best thing that happened was the soccer game in the yard.When I learned that this was not actually a documentary I was relieved of thinking that these kids were hopeless.  I didn't watch all of the special features but I did see enough of the sessions of the students with the director and teacher/actor to see that they were a gorgeous bunch of lively, beautiful yountg people. I think that if the film had been made as an actual documentary, unrehearsed, that we would have seen the real natures of these kids and fallen in love with them.  The way it was done, they were encouraged to act out their most disagreeable selves...and that didn't make for either a dramatically satisfying or a realistic film. In a way I feel cheated; those kids didn't necessarily always act the way that the film portrayed them.You can see from the readers' comments that criticize the teacher for his bad performance, that the viewers believed that this was actually happening ""in real life.""

Based on the experience of author Franois B&eacute;gaudeau, it portrays teaching as a battle for hearts and minds. Each day there are small victories, ground won and lost, as the film's 14-year-olds put their teacher to the test, challenging his authority, demanding his respect, but on their own rough terms - a need that is often nakedly poignant.With scenes developed through improvisation by young nonactors playing themselves, the film is shot and edited in documentary style, the action played out almost entirely in a single classroom and following the course of a single year. During that year, several loosely connected threads come together in an incident that forces the hand of the teacher Franois and leads to a meeting of the school's disciplinary board, where the fate of a student is to be decided. In the end, the struggle between students and teacher is fought to a draw. No one, except in their own mind, wins.Because the film concentrates on the flashpoints between teacher and students, it gives the impression that little if anything is taught or learned during the course of the year. The day's lessons are typically sidetracked by students with other agendas. Given opportunity to say what they actually have learned during the year, no one mentions the French class we've been seeing. And while they may have absorbed something about the give-and-take of ideas in a modern democracy, the teacher sabotages his own best efforts by refusing to admit that he's made a mistake, pulling rank on them instead. One is left wondering what will become of these students - which ones will emerge as adults with fulfilling lives and which will not. Promise, as the film illustrates, is difficult to nourish.The DVD includes discussion of two key scenes by director Laurent Cantet and writer/actor B&eacute;gaudeau, plus a making-of featurette describing the collaborative efforts that went into the development of scenes.",4,"Welcome Back Kotter, not . . .",1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,2136,"['Guaranteed', 'raise', 'hackles', 'viewers', 'who', 'remember', 'orderly', 'classrooms', 'automatic', 'grudging', 'respect', 'teachers', 'award-winning', 'film', 'France', 'public', 'education', 'free-for-all', 'Based', 'experience', 'author', 'Franois', 'B', 'eacute', 'gaudeau', 'teaching', 'battle', 'hearts', 'minds', 'day', 'are', 'small', 'victories', 'ground', 'won', 'lost', 'film', '14-year-olds', 'put', 'teacher', 'test', 'challenging', 'authority', 'demanding', 'respect', 'own', 'rough', 'terms', 'need', 'often', 'nakedly', 'poignant.With', 'scenes', 'developed', 'improvisation', 'young', 'nonactors', 'playing', 'film', 'shot', 'edited', 'documentary', 'style', 'action', 'played', 'out', 'almost', 'entirely', 'single', 'classroom', 'following', 'course', 'single', 'year', 'year', 'several', 'loosely', 'connected', 'threads', 'come', 'together', 'incident', 'hand', 'teacher', 'Franois', 'meeting', 'school', 'disciplinary', 'board', 'where', 'fate', 'student', 'be', 'decided', 'end', 'struggle', 'students', 'teacher', 'fought', 'draw', 'one', 'own', 'mind', 'film', 'flashpoints', 'teacher', 'students', 'impression', 'little', 'anything', 'taught', 'learned', 'course', 'year', 'day', 'lessons', 'are', 'typically', 'sidetracked', 'students', 'other', 'agendas', 'Given', 'opportunity', 'say', 'what', 'actually', 'have', 'learned', 'year', 'one', 'French', 'class', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'may', 'have', 'absorbed', 'something', 'give-and-take', 'ideas', 'modern', 'democracy', 'teacher', 'own', 'best', 'efforts', 'refusing', 'admit', 'made', 'mistake', 'pulling', 'rank', 'instead', 'One', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'students', 'ones', 'will', 'emerge', 'adults', 'fulfilling', 'lives', 'will', 'not', 'Promise', 'film', 'illustrates', 'difficult', 'nourish.The', 'DVD', 'discussion', 'two', 'key', 'scenes', 'director', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'writer/actor', 'B', 'eacute', 'gaudeau', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'describing', 'collaborative', 'efforts', 'went', 'development', 'scenes']",N/A

There is a disconnect between 'what is' in the teacher's mind and 'what is' in the mind of immigrant students. What is absolutely great about this movie is that it does not try to bring in the external world, does not try to make a political statement, does not try to Disneyize the struggle of teachers to 'try to do good' and their students' equally heroic attempts to 'make the best' of their existential situation.This drama is as unadorned as you can get. I have never seen a more truthful and ambiguous, inconclusive, and thus realistic portrayal of teaching. EVERY PROSPECTIVE TEACHER SHOULD WATCH THIS! Current teachers should use this as a source of analysis and criticism. We should all try to envision an alternate 'classroom' where the teacher succeeds in communicating with his students, and succeeds in eliciting the kind of participation that could lead to real 2-way learning.I think the author of the original book and writer of the screenplay (and ironically the star) of this film should be given a Nobel Peace Prize!

The prevailing myth which still holds to an extent is that the comprehensive ideal of lumping all students in together will foster multi-cultural awareness and co-operative learning. It doesn't.Entre les murs is a spare, unflashy and realistic portrayal of a typical teacher's year in such a school. Focusing on a class of 13 year olds from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Begaudeau recreates his former life as a teacher through the fictional guise of Mr Marin (""You're a marine!"" one student jokes when he writes his name on the board at the start of the year). He is not particularly bad, nor is he outstanding at motivating his students. In many ways, a typical liberal minded teacher with a vague desire to do good in the world.I have some experience of working in inner city schools and this movie touches on many of the difficulties of working in such an environment. Mr Marin's students do not refuse to learn (most of them deep down want to succeed), but the frequent flashpoints, culture clashes and hormonal energies make constructive learning difficult. The instances that happen to Mr Marin through the year are familiar to many teachers - he sets one black child on more or less the right path, but loses another when the student erupts in his classroom after the teacher has misjudged a situation, he lashes out and gets excluded. Marin struggles to find engaging tasks for his students, such as using Anne Frank's diary as a primer for writing their own self portrait but finds few students respond as he wants. He gets picked up for using whitey names such as Bill in his worked examples rather than names which reflect the myriad ethnic groups of his class.By the end of the film (and school year) there is a sense of weary, highly circumscribed accomplishment. Some students have developed learning unexpectedly. One girl, whom Marin had unwisely compared to a 'skank' earlier in the year admits she has read Plato's Republic. But some students are still as clueless as they were at the start and feel they have learned nothing.Teaching in such schools is a demanding, thankless task, and Entre les murs paints an important, realistic portrait of the circumstances.

1258128,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B002AG2NTI,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[8, 11]","This film in its imitation of a documentary skillfully captures that species of nightmare classroom long ago predicted by Plato, one in which ""What is to be taught?"" and ""Who is to have authority?"" have become open questions.The students almost to a person have not been initially socialized at home or by society to be able to learn anything, even should a teacher have something worth offering. Less students than restless bodies filling seats, their primary concern is with the will to power and the clash of egos, their ultimate aim being the undermining of the superior knowledge and reasonable authority of their teachers.I'm not sure of the extent to which the author and director intended it, but the principal teacher in the film is himself a significant part of the problem. Unlike Socrates in the ""Gorgias"" who, when confronted by the insolent raw youth Polus' question, ""Don't I have the right to free speech?,"" replied ""You do. But nothing requires me to stand here and listen to you,"" this film's central figure ""argues"" repeatedly with young miscreants of bad faith who clearly aren't worth the compliment of rational opposition. Equally wimpy, he fails to set the record fully straight about a deplorable incident in his classroom, seemingly and mysteriously ready as a consequence to take the fall for several of his most treacherous students. The school's administration as well enables outrageously bad behavior to thrive and prosper. At a meeting of faculty and staff, for example, two students are present as classroom representatives. Their behavior is deplorable, disruptive and giggly. But does a single adult in authority express so much as a call to order? Of course not. Laissez-faire towards ""the children"" is the preferred method of both parents and educators.  Thus parental, teacher, and administrative sentimentality coupled with student intransigence produces in a contemporary French school the perfect classroom from hell.",4,"The Chaos of the ""democratic"" Classroom",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,1957,"['film', 'imitation', 'documentary', 'skillfully', 'species', 'nightmare', 'classroom', 'long', 'ago', 'predicted', 'Plato', 'one', 'What', 'be', 'taught', 'Who', 'have', 'authority', 'have', 'become', 'open', 'questions.The', 'students', 'almost', 'person', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'initially', 'socialized', 'home', 'society', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'anything', 'even', 'should', 'teacher', 'have', 'something', 'worth', 'offering', 'Less', 'students', 'restless', 'bodies', 'filling', 'seats', 'primary', 'concern', 'will', 'power', 'clash', 'egos', 'ultimate', 'aim', 'being', 'undermining', 'superior', 'knowledge', 'reasonable', 'authority', 'teachers.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'extent', 'author', 'director', 'intended', 'principal', 'teacher', 'film', 'significant', 'part', 'problem', 'Socrates', 'Gorgias', 'who', 'when', 'confronted', 'insolent', 'raw', 'youth', 'Polus', 'question', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'free', 'speech', 'replied', 'do', 'nothing', 'stand', 'here', 'listen', 'film', 'central', 'figure', 'argues', 'repeatedly', 'young', 'miscreants', 'bad', 'faith', 'who', 'clearly', 'are', ""n't"", 'compliment', 'rational', 'opposition', 'Equally', 'wimpy', 'set', 'record', 'fully', 'straight', 'deplorable', 'incident', 'classroom', 'seemingly', 'mysteriously', 'ready', 'consequence', 'take', 'fall', 'several', 'most', 'treacherous', 'students', 'school', 'administration', 'as', 'well', 'outrageously', 'bad', 'behavior', 'thrive', 'prosper', 'meeting', 'faculty', 'staff', 'example', 'two', 'students', 'are', 'present', 'classroom', 'representatives', 'behavior', 'deplorable', 'disruptive', 'giggly', 'single', 'adult', 'authority', 'express', 'so', 'much', 'call', 'order', 'course', 'not', 'Laissez-faire', 'towards', 'children', 'preferred', 'method', 'parents', 'educators', 'Thus', 'parental', 'teacher', 'administrative', 'sentimentality', 'coupled', 'student', 'intransigence', 'contemporary', 'French', 'school', 'perfect', 'classroom', 'hell']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[26, 28]","I knew absolutely nothing about this film - other than it was in French and won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. I wanted to approach it with no pre-conceptions. After watching the 2 hour, 10-minute film on DVD I then read the background. I knew it was not a documentary but I wasn't aware that the teacher was the author of the original book upon which the film was based, and that he also wrote the screenplay. The students seemed to be too realistic to be professional actors. (And they aren't; they are actual students at the school.). I stuck with the film, waiting for a solution or happy ending  (like Mr. Holland's Opus"" or ""Stand and Deliver"") but it never came. At first I was disappointed , but then - after thinking about it - I realized that this is ""real life"" (it was based on an actual class) and it was just as much an experiment in filmmaking (using the teacher/author and the student/actors) as an entertainment film.I won't go in to the details of the film - another reviewer, Chris Pandolfi, has done that already - but will comment on the DVD version, which I do recommend. First off, the subtitles are clear and probably the largest font I've seen in a while and are in the black bar below the screen (except, oddly at one point where a few sentences appear ABOVE the picture) , making them easy to read. The DVD also allows you to scan back to a section you may have missed. The bonus features include a 40-minute ""making of"" featurette and two brief scenes with commentary by the director and star/author. All of these are in French with subtitles. The ""Making of"" adds to appreciating the film even more, but watch it AFTER you have seen the film; not before.If you are an educator, you will find this film food for thought. If you are a parent of high school aged students you will find this ""real"", even though it takes place in a multi-cultural school in France.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,The DVD version gives you a chance to replay scenes that fly by quickly in the theater..,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,1935,"['knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'other', 'was', 'French', 'won', 'Palme', ""D'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'wanted', 'approach', 'pre-conceptions', 'watching', '2', 'hour', '10-minute', 'film', 'DVD', 'then', 'read', 'background', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'documentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'teacher', 'was', 'author', 'original', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'students', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'realistic', 'be', 'professional', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'actual', 'students', 'school.', 'stuck', 'film', 'waiting', 'solution', 'happy', 'ending', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'never', 'came', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'then', 'thinking', 'realized', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'class', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'experiment', 'filmmaking', 'using', 'teacher/author', 'student/actors', 'entertainment', 'film.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'film', 'reviewer', 'Chris', 'Pandolfi', 'done', 'already', 'will', 'comment', 'DVD', 'version', 'do', 'recommend', 'First', 'subtitles', 'are', 'clear', 'probably', 'largest', 'font', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'are', 'black', 'bar', 'screen', 'oddly', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'few', 'sentences', 'appear', 'picture', 'making', 'easy', 'read', 'DVD', 'also', 'scan', 'back', 'section', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'bonus', 'include', '40-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'director', 'star/author', 'are', 'French', 'subtitles', 'Making', 'appreciating', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'watch', 'AFTER', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'not', 'are', 'educator', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'food', 'thought', 'are', 'parent', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'students', 'will', 'find', 'real', 'even', 'place', 'multi-cultural', 'school', 'France.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
1258130,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002AG2NTI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[28, 29]","""The Class (Entre Les Murs)"", France's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar this year, is an interesting, insightful, almost Cinema Verite look at one teacher and one class of his students in a high school in a Paris suburb.Based on a book by the film's star, Francois Begadeau, about his own experiences as a teacher, the film concentrates on Francois' French class in a high school in a tough suburb of Paris.But director Laurence Cantet focuses the film even further, heightening the documentary feel of the story. We focus on one group of students in one of Francois' classes. These students are a melting pot of ethnicities, all trying to learn in the same environment even though they are clearly at different levels. So Francois' job involves just trying to communicate with and maintain discipline with his students. Interestingly, each of the actors plays an eponymous student. I don't a lot about the background or history of the story behind this film, but this fact leads me to believe that each actor is playing a fictionalized version of himself or herself.As the school year begins, Francois arrives at his school to find char women cleaning the rooms. He begins to prepare and then meets with the other teachers. They go around the group, introducing themselves to each other, identifying the new teachers and the department chairs, offering welcome and help coping with the school year. Later, we see a teacher pointing out the good and bad students to a newbie, helping them sort out who will be trouble. This is the first moment when I really connected with the story and felt the film was going to show us an in-depth look at the French education system. Before this moment, everything looks and feels too perfect, too clean, too idyllic and well prepared. Early on, you get the feeling we should prepare for a fairy tale or a romanticized tale of an educator, ala ""Dead Poet's Society"" or ""Stand and Deliver"". When one teacher begins rolling down the class list, telling the new teacher ""He'll be trouble. He's OK. Trouble"" and then begins going down the whole list, with one word summaries of each, you realize this school is probably a lot more like the schools we are familiar with. When this moment happens, you have hope this film will dig deeper.And it does. The story concentrates on Francois' interactions with the students in one of his classes. We learn he had most of these students the previous year. He has a history with them and this leads him to have a familiarity of how they will act up, how they will test him. He asks one black girl to read a passage from ""The Diary of Anne Frank"". She protests and accuses him of picking on her, she doesn't want to read, why can't he pick someone else. When he realizes the student, who provides the standard for many of the other girls in the class, has just become unreasonably unruly, he confronts her. ""We got along well last year, what happened?"" When she looks down, we know she realizes she is giving him a hard time. But she's a teenager and it is difficult to express her feelings.As the school year progresses, we see a few brief moments with the other teachers, but the main focus of the story is Francois and his attempts to try to teach his students. And throughout the film, Begadeau is able to portray Francois, showing us his conflict. He is a young man, I would guess mid thirties, young enough to still be a little idealistic, but also a teacher long enough to realize he won't be able to reach very many of his students, he won't be able to provide them with the education they so desperately need. As he interacts with his students, we get a sense of how quickly each of these emotions plays through each interaction with each student. When a student announces there is a rumor floating around that he is gay, he playfully responds by trying to teach them some French, making the student restate the accusation using proper grammar. Later, his frustration gets the better of him and he lashes out at some of the students. Later still, another student answers one of his questions indicating a deep knowledge and understanding of the topic he is talking about. These are the types of students he longs for and you can see the delight register on his face when he realizes this student is actually paying attention, actually trying to learn amid all of the disruptive behavior of the other kids.An extended subplot concerns one of Francois' students, an African kid whose parents don't speak French at home and wear the dress traditional to their country. In a moment of frustration, Francois gets in an argument with two of the girls who are the most disruptive. At the same time, the young man, who has been problematic, gets fed up and ends up accidentally injuring another girl. But because of his history at the school, Francois and his superiors decide to hold an administrative meeting to decide whether he should be expelled. As all of the preparations for this meeting take place (two representatives of the student body must be in attendance and two representatives of the parents must also be in attendance), Francois begins to doubt if this is the right path. What will it accomplish? The student's mom speaks no French and her son must translate everything for her. She doesn't even believe her son is a troublemaker; he does his work, he never misses school. Francois tries to convince her this isn't true. But she knows what she sees. Then during the meeting, we see how serious the school faculty takes this matter. It is almost a court trial, with people making statements, others asking questions and ultimately the student and his mom leave the room while they vote.These moments help to illustrate Francois' growing frustration with the situation. On the one hand, expelling his student will accomplish nothing. He will still have troublemakers in his class. In fact, it will probably only hurt the student. But on the other hand, if they don't enforce the rules can the situation get anything but worse? So he feels a reluctance to follow the protocol, to continue with the proceedings.There is a moment about midway through the film when the new teacher, the one receiving advice from a veteran about who will be good students and who will be bad, rushes into the teacher's lounge, infuriated. ""They're nothing but animals"", he shouts. While this moment is a little 'on the cuff', it is a helpful illustration. We can completely imagine Francois being in this same mind frame a few years ago. But now that he has a few more years of experience under his belt, he realizes he has to simply do the best he can.""The Class"" is an interesting, almost Cinema Verite look at one teacher's attempts to teach his students. It is a very good, very well made film. And the parallels to the American school system are almost shocking.",4,"""The Class"" Provides a Lot For Discussion",1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,6849,"['Class', 'Entre', 'Les', 'Murs', 'France',

1258131,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002AG2NTI,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","""The Class"" follows a school year of a teacher Franois Marin (Franois B&eacute;gaudeau) and his ethnically mixed students in a Paris high school. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Oscar-nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, ""The Class"" has been unanimously praised by critics for several reasons - for example, its engrossing interactions between a teacher and students or authentic look at educational system. I agree, with reservations.Though the film's episodic, fly-on-the-wall observation of the class may lead you think ""The Class"" is a documentary, it is actually based on a novel (semi-autobiographical, it is said) by Franois B&eacute;gaudeau, who plays the teacher Franois Marin here. You may say he is essentially playing a cinematic version of himself, and so are the students, whose character names match their own. The unique approach works, and the acting of the students, though they are obviously non-professionals, are very natural.That means students can be very charming, and annoying, like any high school students. As you expect, Franois class is a very difficult one. To keep order, Franois keeps talking to the students, asking questions and giving homework. Some critics equated his teaching style with Socrates. I don't think Socrates had to yell at his pupils like that. When Franois tells the students to read ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" not many students care. Their reaction is quite unlike in ""Freedom Writers.""Franois teaches French, and he is shocked to find the grammatical mistakes the students make. By showing the different attitudes toward the language between him and the teenagers, director Laurent Cantet suggests something more than a generation gap, most probably national identity, though Cantet never sides with any one interpretation of the event. His attitude does not change when Franois is confronted by the students in the latter half of the film. The whole sequence is intense, but you are not completely certain who is to blame.This is where ""The Class"" is most effective. The teacher provoked his students to think and speak. Now it is the students' turn to provoke him. At the end of the academic year two students come to Franois and confess something he (and we) never dreamed of. All the efforts he made during the course led to unexpected results. Franois just doesn't know what to say. Or maybe he is confused, not perfectly aware of the importance of what he is listening.On the surface ""The Class"" is loosely structured semi-documentary drama, but the fact is the film is the result of meticulously calculated camera and carefully directed interaction between characters. To me ""The Class"" is fascinating not because it represents a certain system or value; the film is intriguing because it captures the very moment we realize the system fails. Not exactly an uplifting experience, but the film is worth watching for its through-provoking contents.",4,Thought Provoking,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2936,"['Class', 'school', 'year', 'teacher', 'Franois', 'Marin', 'Franois', 'B', 'eacute', 'gaudeau', 'ethnically', 'mixed', 'students', 'Paris', 'high', 'school', 'Winner', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Class', 'been', 'unanimously', 'praised', 'critics', 'several', 'reasons', 'example', 'engrossing', 'interactions', 'teacher', 'students', 'authentic', 'look', 'educational', 'system', 'agree', 'film', 'episodic', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'observation', 'class', 'may', 'lead', 'think', 'Class', 'documentary', 'actually', 'based', 'novel', 'semi-autobiographical', 'said', 'Franois', 'B', 'eacute', 'gaudeau', 'who', 'teacher', 'Franois', 'Marin', 'here', 'may', 'say', 'essentially', 'playing', 'cinematic', 'version', 'so', 'are', 'students', 'character', 'names', 'match', 'own', 'unique', 'approach', 'works', 'acting', 'students', 'are', 'obviously', 'non-professionals', 'are', 'very', 'natural.That', 'students', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'charming', 'annoying', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'expect', 'Franois', 'class', 'very', 'difficult', 'one', 'keep', 'order', 'Franois', 'talking', 'students', 'asking', 'questions', 'giving', 'homework', 'critics', 'equated', 'teaching', 'style', 'Socrates', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Socrates', 'had', 'yell', 'pupils', 'When', 'Franois', 'students', 'read', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'not', 'many', 'students', 'care', 'reaction', 'quite', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'Franois', 'teaches', 'French', 'shocked', 'find', 'grammatical', 'mistakes', 'students', 'make', 'showing', 'different', 'attitudes', 'language', 'teenagers', 'director', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'something', 'more', 'generation', 'gap', 'most', 'probably', 'national', 'identity', 'Cantet', 'never', 'sides', 'one', 'interpretation', 'event', 'attitude', 'not', 'change', 'when', 'Franois', 'confronted', 'students', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'whole', 'sequence', 'intense', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'certain', 'who', 'blame.This', 'where', 'Class', 'most', 'effective', 'teacher', 'provoked', 'students', 'think', 'speak', 'Now', 'students', 'turn', 'provoke', 'end', 'academic', 'year', 'two', 'students', 'come', 'Franois', 'confess', 'something', 'never', 'dreamed', 'efforts', 'made', 'course', 'led', 'unexpected', 'results', 'Franois', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'maybe', 'confused', 'not', 'perfectly', 'aware', 'importance', 'what', 'surface', 'Class', 'loosely', 'structured', 'semi-documentary', 'drama', 'fact', 'film', 'result', 'meticulously', 'calculated', 'camera', 'carefully', 'directed', 'interaction', 'characters', 'Class', 'fascinating', 'not', 'certain', 'system', 'value', 'film', 'intriguing', 'very', 'moment', 'realize', 'system', 'Not', 'exactly', 'uplifting', 'experience', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'through-provoking', 'contents']",N/A
1258132,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B002AG2NTI,Westley,"[10, 11]","""The Class"" is about a dedicated teacher, Francois Marin (played by Francois Begaudeau), in an inner city Parisian middle school.  Lead actor Begaudeau has an interesting background; he was in a punk rock band and was a writer before becoming a teacher.  He turned his experiences teaching into a book, ""Entre Les Murs"" (Between these Walls), which was then loosely adapted into ""The Class.""  In the film, we follow Francois as he teaches a class of 25 students during the school year.  The movie made news when it became the first French film to win the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in over 20 years.Francois' teaching style is unusual, at least for American audiences; he encourages his students to ask questions, even if it takes them off the main topic.  So a lesson on subjugating French verbs can quickly lead to a discussion of slang and a variety of topics - some quite unexpected.  Whether his style is effective is questionable.  Plus, Francois is often just barely in control of his class, although he seems more in control than some of the other teachers.  However, regardless of effectiveness, his style does make for a fascinating movie.  Francois' strives to make his lessons applicable to the lives' of his students in his highly multi-cultural mostly lower income class.  He struggles to understand his students and their diverse backgrounds as he attempts to teach them.  How can he teach French to a bunch of students who openly say that they aren't French?  That is part of Francois' dilemma.The plot of ""The Class"" is nothing earth-shattering - just typical things one could observe in any classroom.  What sells the movie is its tremendous realism.  Begaudeau is extraordinary as the lead teacher; he's refreshingly human.  He isn't portrayed as a hero who rescues his students and inspires them; this isn't ""Lean on Me"" or ""Stand and Deliver.""  As good as Begaudeau is, the movie is stolen by the nonprofessional young actors.  I liked that the teens had problems but weren't presented as thugs - this isn't ""The Asphalt Jungle.""  These teens are more complicated than that.  The young actors participated in months of workshops with Begaudeau and director Laurent Cantet, during which the specific situations that occur in the movie were improved.  Thus, the actors themselves contributed to the script, which helps explain the degree of realism.  The movie feels like a documentary, and we feel like voyeurs peeking into their space - between their walls.  Whether you like the way that Francois teaches of not and whether you like these kids or not, ""The Class"" is an enlightening, entertaining film.",5,Teaching the class,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,2644,"['Class', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'Francois', 'Marin', 'played', 'Francois', 'Begaudeau', 'inner', 'city', 'Parisian', 'middle', 'school', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Begaudeau', 'interesting', 'background', 'was', 'punk', 'rock', 'band', 'was', 'writer', 'becoming', 'teacher', 'turned', 'experiences', 'teaching', 'book', 'Entre', 'Les', 'Murs', 'Walls', 'was', 'then', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'Class', 'film', 'follow', 'Francois', 'class', '25', 'students', 'school', 'year', 'movie', 'made', 'news', 'when', 'became', 'first', 'French', 'film', 'win', 'coveted', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', '20', 'years.Francois', 'teaching', 'style', 'unusual', 'least', 'American', 'audiences', 'students', 'ask', 'questions', 'even', 'off', 'main', 'topic', 'lesson', 'subjugating', 'French', 'verbs', 'can', 'quickly', 'lead', 'discussion', 'slang', 'variety', 'topics', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'style', 'effective', 'questionable', 'Francois', 'often', 'just', 'barely', 'control', 'class', 'more', 'control', 'other', 'teachers', 'However', 'regardless', 'effectiveness', 'style', 'make', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'Francois', 'strives', 'make', 'lessons', 'applicable', 'lives', 'students', 'highly', 'multi-cultural', 'mostly', 'lower', 'income', 'class', 'understand', 'students', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'teach', 'How', 'can', 'teach', 'French', 'bunch', 'students', 'who', 'openly', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'French', 'part', 'Francois', 'dilemma.The', 'plot', 'Class', 'nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'just', 'typical', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'observe', 'classroom', 'What', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'realism', 'Begaudeau', 'extraordinary', 'lead', 'teacher', 'refreshingly', 'human', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'hero', 'who', 'students', ""n't"", 'Lean', 'Me', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'As', 'good', 'Begaudeau', 'movie', 'stolen', 'nonprofessional', 'young', 'actors', 'liked', 'teens', 'had', 'problems', 'were', ""n't"", 'presented', 'thugs', ""n't"", 'Asphalt', 'Jungle', 'teens', 'are', 'more', 'complicated', 'young', 'actors', 'participated', 'months', 'workshops', 'Begaudeau', 'director', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'specific', 'situations', 'occur', 'movie', 'were', 'improved', 'Thus', 'actors', 'contributed', 'script', 'explain', 'degree', 'realism', 'movie', 'feels', 'documentary', 'feel', 'voyeurs', 'peeking', 'space', 'walls', 'way', 'Francois', 'teaches', 'not', 'kids', 'not', 'Class', 'enlightening', 'entertaining', 'film']",N/A
