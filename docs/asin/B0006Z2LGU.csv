875479,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006Z2LGU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 8]","While Eulogy isn't the funniest film out there, it definitely isn't the worst.  Riding somewhere in mediocre-town the major issue that I had with this film was the fact that it would not ""go the distance"".  Let me explain.  Here you had this film that carried some pretty big names in their own respective careers and a story that was actually emotionally and humanly interesting, but unfortunately director Michael Clancy just didn't push himself to the full extent of this project's potential.  There were so many times during this film that I was prepared for a huge laugh from Romano or Azaria or even Winger, but somehow it just didn't come.  The sad part is that the build up was there, but there was no delivery.  It was as if it was planned to have a bigger moment, but either due to sloppy editing or just a poor sense of humor, it never happened.  The ending is the perfect example.  Here you have one of the weakest endings to a film imaginable.  What could have been actually quite hysterical fell to the wayside of clich&eacute; and predictable.  I wasn't happy at all with the ending to this film because it just didn't fit with the overall tone of the rest of the film.  It had the markings of a very dark comedy, but yet it never went fully dark.  It seemed to side with lightness, and it just didn't work.Outside of this dismal aspect, I would have to say that the rest of the film was very good.  The actors were exceptional.  I found myself laughing more at Romano during this film than I did when he was in Welcome to Mooseport.  This just was more unlike his Everyone Loves Raymond character that it was very appealing to watch.  Winger was also directly on cue with her character, keeping us on edge while making us chuckle at the same time.  Sadly, it was her character that suffered the most by the ending.  Her moment is left semi-visionary that just didn't work in my book.  Azaria does his job with the greatest of ease while bringing some (just not a lot) of layers to his character.  Zooey was one of my favorite characters just because it was enjoyable to see a sane one in the group.  She is the one that really is the central focus of this family, and the one that helps bring about the final climax.  She has a hefty character with big responsibility and pulls it off very well.  These were my favorite characters of the film. While there were others, I thought that these four deserved the most recognition due to their offbeat humor and impressionable characters.It wasn't until after I watched this film that I realized the Death of a Salesman references.  They were abundant throughout the entire film (through direction mentioning and smaller innuendoes), but it wasn't until Rip Torn appeared on screen that I fully understood what director Michael Clancy wanted to do.  I saw this film as a modern loosely adapted version of Arthur Miller's play.  From the salesman that couldn't sell to the child that found success early, it became very clear that Miller's play had a big influence on Clancy's project.  I would watch the film again just to catch more of the references, but it was this ""oh yea"" moment when you realize the truth that really brought this picture closer together.  It was a perfect match for this film and while I cannot credit much to Clancy, I can give him partial credit for creativity.  He mixed current culture into Salesman and crafted a very poignant picture that presses on the fact that children will always be children no matter what kind of family you have.Overall, I liked this film, but felt that it could have been much darker.  If only Clancy would have taken it one step further, he would have had an instant cult classic.  Looking back on it now, I hated the ending.  It left this sour taste in my mouth that tarnished the rest of the film, but after realizing the Death of a Salesman connection, I think I would go back and watch it one more time.  I do not think that it is one of the greatest films of the year, but it had potential.  I am grinding my teeth thinking about the moments that could have been literally hysterical if only Clancy would have gone further.  He cheapened out, and sadly I cannot forgive him for it on this film.  He had the right elements, he just never used them.  Eulogy was the perfect example of a good film, but with bad delivery (and packaging ... what does the fishbowl on the box have anything to do with the film?).Grade: **** out of *****",4,She's adding ingredients to her personality.,1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,4452,"['Eulogy', ""n't"", 'funniest', 'film', 'there', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'worst', 'Riding', 'somewhere', 'mediocre-town', 'major', 'issue', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'distance', 'Let', 'explain', 'Here', 'had', 'film', 'carried', 'pretty', 'big', 'names', 'own', 'respective', 'careers', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'emotionally', 'humanly', 'interesting', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'Michael', 'Clancy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'full', 'extent', 'project', 'potential', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'prepared', 'huge', 'laugh', 'Romano', 'Azaria', 'even', 'Winger', 'somehow', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'sad', 'part', 'build', 'up', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'delivery', 'was', 'was', 'planned', 'have', 'bigger', 'moment', 'either', 'due', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'just', 'poor', 'sense', 'humor', 'never', 'happened', 'ending', 'perfect', 'example', 'Here', 'have', 'one', 'weakest', 'endings', 'film', 'imaginable', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'quite', 'hysterical', 'fell', 'wayside', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictable', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'overall', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'had', 'markings', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'yet', 'never', 'went', 'fully', 'dark', 'seemed', 'side', 'lightness', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.Outside', 'dismal', 'aspect', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'were', 'exceptional', 'found', 'laughing', 'more', 'Romano', 'film', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'Welcome', 'Mooseport', 'just', 'was', 'more', 'Everyone', 'Raymond', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'appealing', 'watch', 'Winger', 'was', 'also', 'directly', 'cue', 'character', 'keeping', 'edge', 'making', 'chuckle', 'same', 'time', 'Sadly', 'was', 'character', 'suffered', 'most', 'ending', 'moment', 'left', 'semi-visionary', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'book', 'Azaria', 'job', 'greatest', 'ease', 'bringing', 'just', 'not', 'lot', 'layers', 'character', 'Zooey', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'just', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'sane', 'one', 'group', 'one', 'really', 'central', 'focus', 'family', 'one', 'bring', 'final', 'climax', 'hefty', 'character', 'big', 'responsibility', 'pulls', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'were', 'favorite', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'others', 'thought', 'four', 'deserved', 'most', 'recognition', 'due', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'impressionable', 'characters.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'watched', 'film', 'realized', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'references', 'were', 'abundant', 'entire', 'film', 'direction', 'mentioning', 'smaller', 'innuendoes', 'was', ""n't"", 'Rip', 'Torn', 'appeared', 'screen', 'fully', 'understood', 'what', 'director', 'Michael', 'Clancy', 'wanted', 'do', 'saw', 'film', 'modern', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'version', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'play', 'salesman', 'could', ""n't"", 'sell', 'child', 'found', 'success', 'early', 'became', 'very', 'clear', 'Miller', 'play', 'had', 'big', 'influence', 'Clancy', 'project', 'would', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'just', 'catch', 'more', 'references', 'was', 'oh', 'yea', 'moment', 'when', 'realize', 'truth', 'really', 'brought', 'picture', 'together', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'credit', 'much', 'Clancy', 'can', 'give', 'partial', 'credit', 'creativity', 'mixed', 'current', 'culture', 'Salesman', 'crafted', 'very', 'poignant', 'picture', 'fact', 'children', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'children', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'family', 'have.Overall', 'liked', 'film', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'darker', 'only', 'Clancy', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'instant', 'cult', 'classic', 'Looking', 'back', 'now', 'hated', 'ending', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'tarnished', 'rest', 'film', 'realizing', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'connection', 'think', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'year', 'had', 'potential', 'am', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'thinking', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'literally', 'hysterical', 'only', 'Clancy', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'further', 'cheapened', 'out', 'sadly', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'film', 'had', 'right', 'elements', 'just', 'never', 'used', 'Eulogy', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'good', 'film', 'bad', 'delivery', 'packaging', 'fishbowl', 'box', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'film', '.Grade', '****', '*****']",N/A

Clancy has been able to gather together a star studded and multi-talented cast. Katie (Zooey Deschanel) is asked by her grandmother (Piper Laurie) to give the eulogy at her grandfather's (Rip Torn) funeral. Now Katie weaves from family member to family member to find something good to say about her grandfather.....and in the process finds the answer in the sweetest way.Deschanel is charming and her sweetness to do right is paired up nicely with love struck Ryan (Jesse Bradford) whose roguish smile enhances the pairs innocence. The couple act as the only sanity for the viewer while a hurricane of drama and insanity swirl about.Debra Winger gives a fine performance as a supressed housewife with a few secrets of her own and Ray Romano and his hoodlum sons work comic mayhem all over. Kelly Preston and Famke Janneson (two of Hollywood most under appreciated actresses) turn up the heat and comic meter as the lesbian sister and her life partner. Lastly, Hank Azaria is Kate's father and is the peacemaker / seedy actor/ pot smoker who seems to have a lot for tense moments. Director Michael Clancy give a strong steering in this movie to prevent it from being dull, and over done from what it is: a simple movie about a family that has issues that come to the forefront....they just so happen to come to the surface in the craziest ways.

875485,A2GYX971VETQBV,B0006Z2LGU,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[25, 26]","I thoroughly enjoyed watching EULOGY, a dark comedy about a family who is reunited when the male patriarch of the family passes away.  To be honest, when I saw the cast and the well-trodden plot description, I was not expecting anything stellar.  But the film exceeded my expectations and manages to find some breathing room and originality in its short 91 minutes.  The plot of EULOGY, as every reviewer has described, is not complex.  Director Michael Clancy manages to pull you into the dysfunctional lives of these characters and let you be a fly on the wall to their hilarious and ridiculous fights.One interesting aspect of the film is its treatment of death.  You don't always expect to have any serious message coming from a comedy, but EULOGY has one.  While everyone has come to this funeral on the pretense of mourning their father, the occasion becomes a time for them all to mourn their own lives and failures.  It is a natural message enough: obviously, a death in the family makes one painfully aware of one's own mortality.  However, there is something added in this film.  No one seems to be truly sorry to see the old man go, except the granddaughter who seems to have a distorted view of him.  Perhaps, the fact that they have all gathered to ""honor"" the death of a man they did not openly love forces them to realize the lack of love and connection they have in their own lives.  Will we be mourned at the end of our lives?Now, I am not trying to sift EULOGY for some deep meaning or message.  But hidden behind all of the comedy and the hilarious (and absurd) dialogue, there is some real emotion to be had in these scenes.  Having not expected any, I was surprised and pleased by the end result.  My only major criticism of the film is the forced love story between the granddaughter and an old fling of hers.  It seems tacked onto the film unnaturally and serves only to snap the teenager out of her false world of mourning to join the rest of her family.

It's an over the top treatment of a disfunction American family with a funeral thrown in.  The only sane, respondsible character is grandaughter Kate(Zooey Deschane-looking like a younger version of Winger) who tries to keep waring aunts, kooky grandma, divorced/oversexed uncle and pot smoking dad from killing each other while trying to compose a eulogy for her much loved grandfather(Rip Torn). The movie doesn't hold back in the insanity department, everyone is crazy and off the chain, even the lascivious 12yr twin nephews and the poor widowed grandma who with acute depression, can't seem to off herself properly.

Odd, and sad that what in previous years used the same concept for meaty tough dramas like, for one example, O'Neil's 'Long Days Journey into Night'.  Now those same issues that used to be private and painful and not concepts that families would openly share with a public have become fodder for zany, over the top, toilet-mouthed comedies.Such is the case for EULOGY.  In essence the story is a matter a few days in the Collins family whose three generations have gathered for the funeral of the patriarch Edmund Collins (Rip Torn), each with their own issues of disenchantment with the world and each caught up in the ME FIRST pathology that precludes healthy relationships - save one: granddaughter Kate (Zooey Deschanel) daughter of ex-child actor Daniel (Hank Azaria) who seems the most solidly adjusted of the bunch and is therefore the one elected to write and speak the Eulogy for the funeral.The Grandmother Charlotte (Piper Laurie) is suicidal (who wouldn't be in this family environment?) and the remainder of the family includes smarmy Skip (Ray Romano playing Ray Romano), Skip's twin sons Fred and Ted (Curtis and Keith Garcia), lesbian sister Lucy (Kelly Preston) and her lover Judy (Famke Janssen),and the controllingly vile sister Alice (Debra Winger).  Throw these disparate characters into the bowl, add the fishfood script by Michael Clancy (who also directs) and voila! - out comes a fast-paced, half-baked comedy that finds the audience hungry for laughter even over embarrassing choices of jokes.  The cast is fleshed out with performances from Glenne Headly, Jesse Bradford, and Rene Auberjonois.Yes, the film has its funny moments: it is sad that the comedy is always at the expense of individual character flaws that are not inherently funny.  But with a cast of this quality you can be assured that the project is worth watching, if only to see the talented Debra Winger once again in action!

For the most part the acting is fine; also worth mentioning are Piper Laurie and Famke Janssen, with Ray Romano intermittently supplying some great crude humor. (The women really carry this film, and they do a great job, overall).The problem is the script which goes from character to character and reveals some of their quirks, but forsakes social bite in favor of quick set pieces that are used to supply zingers and superficial regret sound bites, but nothing of real substance, even comedically. Contrast this with Down and Out in Beverly Hills which focuses on a situation around which the dysfunctional family rallies in the various dysfunctional ways they know how. This was undoubtedly supposed to be the objective of Eulogy, but the writer-director fell short because the focus is just not strong enough.The ""scenelet"" in the courtroom with Romano is hilarious. The occasional comments of his two twin sons, as crude as their father, are also really funny, here and there. But this is not a consistently good comedy which is too bad; it definitely could have been much better if there had been a greater emphasis on the MEANING of the patriarch's life and death, rather than tossing off a few crumbs on this topic here and there and instead focusing, as mentioned, in a scattershot manner, on how to wring guffaws out of an audience based on a lot of lesbian stuff.Nothing wrong with lesbianism; that's not the point. The point is that the film is mistitled and mis-plotted. The premise is not solid enough to carry the film.

The family includes his wife played by Piper Laurie (Carrie, The Faculty) who tries to kill herself by jumping out of the car but lands on grass. There's Aunt Debra Winger (Terms of Endearment, Forget Paris) who has a silent family and she also likes women. There's Aunt Kelly Preston (Jerry Maguire, Sky High) who is a lesbian and she brings her lover Famke Janssen (GoldenEye, X-Men 1-3) along with her. There's Uncle Ray Romano (Everybody Loves Raymond, Welcome to Mooseport) who brings his twins with him and then there's Uncle Hank Azaria (The Simpsons, America's Sweethearts) who brings the Granddaughter, played by the talented and attractivly cute as hell Zooey Deschanel (Almost Famous, All The Real Girls) Deschanel is the one who is supposed to come up with the ""Eulogy"" hence the title. Comedy is extremely funny with great dialouge. Only thing about it is that Debra Winger is miscast. One of the best pieces of dialouge would be when Ray Romano tells everyone that when he dies he wants to be creamated and mixed in with the stuff that prints money, so when they mix his ashes in with the ink and print them on dollars, he'll be everywhere...great stuff.

But it's performed with such vigor and flair from its talented cast, one can't help but find it amusing.  Although there isn't a character in the movie who is totally likeable, you can almost sense the agony underlying its dysfunctional family.  Hank Azaria is superb as the wannabe actor whose claim to fame is a peanut butter commercial he filmed while 8 years old, and who is now working in really bad porno flicks; Jesse Bradford (Swimfan) is appropriately noble as the granddaughter's old suitor who is still fanning the flames; Zooey Deschanel's granddaughter is the one character who seems to have some worthwhile traits; Glenne Headly is great as the nurse who has her own secrets with the family; Famke Janssen does a nice turn as daughter Kelly Preston's significant other who finds little acceptance from her future in-laws; Preston herself does a nice spin as the lesbian daughter seeking support; Piper Laurie is marvelous as the mother and widow whose suicide attempts are hilarious in their own right; Ray Romano is annoying as all heck as the self-centered father of two twins from hell; Debra Winger outdoes herself as the bitchy sister whose lifelong rivalry with Preston comes to a head; and of course there's a glorified cameo from Rip Torn as the deceased father with his own secret.
