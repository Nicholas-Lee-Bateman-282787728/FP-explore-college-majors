I can't imagine how this read as a script but he found enough to work with that made for an unusual film; I am assuming it was a HBO vehicle or some form of TVM, it had that smaller budget feel to it. Oddly enough, and probably for many actors, a small budget is a burden that they can't overcome as it means their every movement, gesture, line of dialogue has to ring true or the viewer is left with nothing to grab onto for interest in the characters or the storyline (ie. no clever editing, cinematography, location, secondary story/characters etc).Small budget, big budget, glitzy storyline, skewed storyline, high adventure, gritty cop thriller, whatever, it doesn't matter with Assante, he treats every script that he does (okay, leave out Dead Lenny, which is the only time I will ever say that title again on pain of death) with a sureness and freshness that can be scary. I don't know what it is, except he also makes most of his co-actors better, makes even a peculiar part unexpected and pretty much a director can strip out everything else because they know Assante will just carry the film on his own.I agree with the other reviewer that the female lead (Elisabeth Shue) was a poor choice, not sure what film she was in but it wasn't this one. I find that a puzzle, as Assante tends to make any female lead just sparkle, there is always a certain zest to the pairings. The only other film I can think of where the female lead just falls flat with him is the Passion and Paradise film, in both cases the common denominator was a too ""young"" actress/character who simply lacks maturity to be an compatible foil for his characters.Rather than give  away the plot twists in this film - which would be a crime in any film that is going off the reservation as this one does with the ""western"" genre - I would recommend that you watch it with a eye on how Assante pulls off this unusual character; he is just fun to watch, a consummate professional. You can still wonder at some of the inconsistencies in the storyline and not really suffer from them; heck, it is a character study showpiece for Assante, which in tribute to him is probably what he can bring to any part he does.",4,"a curiosity for sure, and that can be a good thing!",1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,2248,"['Give', 'Assante', 'credit', 'versatility', 'maybe', 'even', 'guts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'read', 'script', 'found', 'enough', 'work', 'made', 'unusual', 'film', 'am', 'assuming', 'was', 'HBO', 'vehicle', 'form', 'TVM', 'had', 'smaller', 'budget', 'feel', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'probably', 'many', 'actors', 'small', 'budget', 'burden', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'movement', 'gesture', 'line', 'dialogue', 'ring', 'true', 'viewer', 'left', 'nothing', 'grab', 'interest', 'characters', 'storyline', 'ie', 'clever', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'location', 'secondary', 'story/characters', 'etc', '.Small', 'budget', 'big', 'budget', 'glitzy', 'storyline', 'skewed', 'storyline', 'high', 'adventure', 'gritty', 'cop', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Assante', 'script', 'okay', 'leave', 'out', 'Dead', 'Lenny', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'ever', 'say', 'title', 'again', 'pain', 'death', 'sureness', 'freshness', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'also', 'most', 'co-actors', 'better', 'even', 'peculiar', 'part', 'unexpected', 'pretty', 'much', 'director', 'can', 'strip', 'out', 'everything', 'else', 'know', 'Assante', 'will', 'just', 'carry', 'film', 'own.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'female', 'lead', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'find', 'puzzle', 'Assante', 'make', 'female', 'lead', 'just', 'sparkle', 'always', 'certain', 'zest', 'pairings', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'where', 'female', 'lead', 'just', 'flat', 'Passion', 'Paradise', 'film', 'cases', 'common', 'denominator', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'actress/character', 'who', 'simply', 'maturity', 'be', 'compatible', 'foil', 'characters.Rather', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'film', 'going', 'off', 'reservation', 'one', 'western', 'genre', 'would', 'recommend', 'watch', 'eye', 'how', 'Assante', 'unusual', 'character', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'consummate', 'professional', 'can', 'still', 'wonder', 'inconsistencies', 'storyline', 'not', 'really', 'suffer', 'heck', 'character', 'study', 'showpiece', 'Assante', 'tribute', 'probably', 'what', 'can', 'bring', 'part']",N/A
572551,A1A4BX7D2OY0D4,B000059H7N,Michael Garcia,"[0, 0]","I remember seeing this movie as a kid and loving it when it was on HBO back in the mid 90s.  I had only seen it one time and I recently decided to purchase a dvd copy and give it another viewing.So after ordering it online, waiting a few days and receiving the package, I popped it in the old dvd player, fired it up, picked up the popcorn and got started(This whole sentence was unnecessary, but eh).The plot is centered around Armand Assante playing an ex civil war soldier, now blind wandering the west much like David Carridine in kung fu.  Yeah, thats right, he's BLIND.  I think once you get past the part, you're ready for some kickass time.Early on in the movie you see scenes of his amazing abilities despite his blindness.  Early on, he encounters some thugs, but uses his &#34;spidy&#34; sense to outduel them and move on.  Its almost as though he developed a 6th sense after his blindness; I wonder if he ever touches the stove when its hot.I don't remember exactly what the plot was, but theres a few shootouts, a robbery, a treasure chest and other similar western things, done in a fun way so you'll be pleased through the movie.  Jack Black also makes an appearance in an early film role for him.While this movie is not considered a classic, I consider it a basic cable classic and a movie that will definitely come up if you go to google and type &#34;western blind guy&#34;, this will be that movie.",4,"Awesome movie, slightly ridicoulus, mostly violent, all entertainment!",1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,1417,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'kid', 'loving', 'when', 'was', 'HBO', 'back', 'mid', '90s', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'time', 'recently', 'decided', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'copy', 'give', 'viewing.So', 'ordering', 'online', 'waiting', 'few', 'days', 'receiving', 'package', 'popped', 'old', 'dvd', 'player', 'fired', 'up', 'picked', 'up', 'popcorn', 'got', 'started', 'whole', 'sentence', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'eh', '.The', 'plot', 'centered', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'playing', 'ex', 'civil', 'war', 'soldier', 'now', 'wandering', 'west', 'much', 'David', 'Carridine', 'kung', 'fu', 'Yeah', 'thats', 'right', 'BLIND', 'think', 'once', 'get', 'part', ""'re"", 'ready', 'kickass', 'time.Early', 'movie', 'see', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'blindness', 'Early', 'thugs', '34', 'spidy', '34', 'sense', 'outduel', 'move', 'almost', 'developed', '6th', 'sense', 'blindness', 'wonder', 'ever', 'stove', 'when', 'hot.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'few', 'shootouts', 'robbery', 'treasure', 'chest', 'other', 'similar', 'western', 'things', 'done', 'fun', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Black', 'also', 'appearance', 'early', 'film', 'role', 'him.While', 'movie', 'not', 'considered', 'classic', 'consider', 'basic', 'cable', 'classic', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'come', 'up', 'go', 'google', 'type', '34', 'western', 'guy', '34', 'will', 'be', 'movie']",N/A

572553,AZ3SU0OK9YQZ3,B000059H7N,"Montoya ""ponitora""","[5, 7]","The plot of this 1994 HBO movie is fairly simple with a sprinkling of more complex sub-plots, but essentially this movie is about a blind man (played by Armand Assante) on a quest. This western works very well with the exception of one mediocre performance in the female role, but very few [if any] of us watch westerns for the love interest. The strength of this movie is in  Assante's excellent performance, as well as the universal appeal this movie will have across the board for fans of traditional American westerns and European [spaghetti] westerns alike. The director seems to borrow heavily from earlier ideas of Corbucci, Garrone and Colizzi, with a healthy measure of John Ford and Howard Hawks influence combined, to create a unique film in the western genre.  I have no idea what HBO intended when they funded this film, but in a 2003 era of Dungeons and Dragons and a post-democratic society a little grit, guns and gore goes a long way!

572555,AK61LQI92GTCH,B000059H7N,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[6, 6]","Borrowing freely from westerns traditional and Italian, as well as from the Japanese Zatoichi series (blind swordfighter/masseur), BLIND JUSTICE works much better, and is a lot more enjoyable, than a mere plot description would indicate.Armand Assante plays Canaan, a man blinded in Civil War.  We see him first dressed in a black duster and wearing thick smoked glasses, walking across the desert with an infant bundled in his arms.  Three Mexican banditos approach, whooping and hollering and firing their guns in the air.  Canaan is dust, and if he manages to get out of this scrape he crawls into myth.Although we're led to believe that Canaan retains some sight, his condition seems to have enhanced his other senses to a remarkable degree.  Enough so that he's able to hear a scorpion walking across a hitching post from twenty feet and shoot it without touching the hand it was about to crawl onto.The plot demands all of his super acute faculties.  Canaan finds himself in a town under siege.  A decimated U.S. Calvary unit is holed up in the local church, sitting on a wagon full of silver and threatened by the dreaded bandit king Alacran (Robert Davi) and his merciless minions.  Oh, yeah, and there's that nurse Caroline (Elizabeth Shue) that he's got to kind of fall for, too.Assante is a great actor, and makes his incredible character believable.  The action is well choreographed and fast paced, save for a few flashblacks strategically thrown in to fill in Canaan's back story.  I'm not sure we need to know how or why Canaan was blinded, but we find out anyway.BLIND JUSTICE is compelling and an ingenious western.",4,There are no reinforcements!,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,1632,"['Borrowing', 'freely', 'westerns', 'traditional', 'Italian', 'as', 'well', 'Japanese', 'Zatoichi', 'series', 'swordfighter/masseur', 'BLIND', 'JUSTICE', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'mere', 'plot', 'description', 'would', 'indicate.Armand', 'Assante', 'plays', 'Canaan', 'man', 'blinded', 'Civil', 'War', 'see', 'first', 'dressed', 'black', 'duster', 'wearing', 'thick', 'smoked', 'glasses', 'walking', 'desert', 'infant', 'bundled', 'arms', 'Three', 'Mexican', 'banditos', 'approach', 'whooping', 'hollering', 'firing', 'guns', 'air', 'Canaan', 'dust', 'get', 'scrape', 'myth.Although', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'Canaan', 'sight', 'condition', 'have', 'enhanced', 'other', 'senses', 'remarkable', 'degree', 'Enough', 'able', 'hear', 'scorpion', 'walking', 'hitching', 'post', 'twenty', 'feet', 'shoot', 'touching', 'hand', 'was', 'crawl', 'onto.The', 'plot', 'super', 'acute', 'faculties', 'Canaan', 'town', 'siege', 'decimated', 'U.S.', 'Calvary', 'unit', 'holed', 'up', 'local', 'church', 'sitting', 'wagon', 'full', 'silver', 'threatened', 'dreaded', 'bandit', 'king', 'Alacran', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'merciless', 'minions', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'nurse', 'Caroline', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'got', 'kind', 'fall', 'great', 'actor', 'incredible', 'character', 'believable', 'action', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fast', 'paced', 'save', 'few', 'flashblacks', 'strategically', 'thrown', 'fill', 'Canaan', 'back', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'why', 'Canaan', 'was', 'blinded', 'find', 'out', 'anyway.BLIND', 'JUSTICE', 'compelling', 'ingenious', 'western']",N/A
