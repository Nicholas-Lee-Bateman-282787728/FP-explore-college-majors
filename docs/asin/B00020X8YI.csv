This was SLINGS & ARROWS. That show ran for three seasons.  It was Canadian as is all of Gross's work.  Thus, this love story is also Canadian, set on a ranch in Alberta. The story is marriage of convenience in plot but that is about all that is borrowed in this fresh and captivating story. The woman inherits her father's ranch and Gross will help her run it (since she doesn't know how) if they get married.  She is fresh from the city, an urbanite.  He has always lived in this Alberta wide open spaces milieu. There is nothing schmaltzy or gimmicky about this film.  It is very realistic and the romance builds believably.

Kolb,"[3, 3]","On an isolated ranch on the Alberta prairie where the foothills of the Rockies make for spectacular scenery,  an attractive ranch hand awkwardly proposes a quid pro quo to his boss. He mends fences and squires her to town and cattle auctions. She defends her decision to stay on the ranch she inherited to an ambitious and somewhat bitter widowed mother who would rather see her daughter return to Toronto even if it is only to a career as a lounge singer. The daughter falls for the ranch hand, most would . But the ranch hand has a past and a family only to eager to advocate a lop sided marriage settlement for their son. It's hard to tell what the proposed bridegroom feels.  What should the heroine do ?Adding texture to the main plot are tidbits of cultural anthropology, Alberta style.The ambitions of discriminated against Ukrainian farm families, the errors of small town gossip, the disadvantages which accrue to First Nation people in western Canada and the primogeniture strictures of landed families are all explored. Pace unfolds like the kd lang soundtrack , erotic, mellow  and husky.I have watched this film countless times. It makes a case for trusting the good in others and for the value of  sticking to basics. It argues for integrity, it debunks cuteness, and it makes a case for following one's heart.Although this buffalo jump is metaphoric there are many real ones on the western plains from Wyoming north. And there is a quintessential Buffalo Jump in southern Alberta which evokes the landscape of this film.Should you make the pilgrimage to see the locations of this film it is also worth noting the nearby scenery shot for the film Brokeback Mountain. All can be seen north of the Montana border up towards Calagary and then Jasper NP.It is scenery so beautiful and loaded with content that it will capture you if it does not break your heart.",4,flim flam or an excuse to marry a woman he loves ?,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1872,"['isolated', 'ranch', 'Alberta', 'prairie', 'where', 'foothills', 'Rockies', 'make', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'attractive', 'ranch', 'hand', 'awkwardly', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'boss', 'fences', 'town', 'cattle', 'auctions', 'decision', 'stay', 'ranch', 'inherited', 'ambitious', 'somewhat', 'bitter', 'widowed', 'mother', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'daughter', 'return', 'Toronto', 'even', 'only', 'career', 'lounge', 'singer', 'daughter', 'ranch', 'hand', 'most', 'would', 'ranch', 'hand', 'past', 'family', 'only', 'eager', 'advocate', 'lop', 'sided', 'marriage', 'settlement', 'son', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'proposed', 'bridegroom', 'feels', 'What', 'should', 'heroine', 'do', 'Adding', 'texture', 'main', 'plot', 'are', 'tidbits', 'cultural', 'anthropology', 'Alberta', 'style.The', 'ambitions', 'discriminated', 'Ukrainian', 'farm', 'families', 'errors', 'small', 'town', 'gossip', 'disadvantages', 'accrue', 'First', 'Nation', 'people', 'western', 'Canada', 'primogeniture', 'landed', 'families', 'are', 'explored', 'Pace', 'kd', 'lang', 'soundtrack', 'erotic', 'mellow', 'husky.I', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'countless', 'times', 'case', 'trusting', 'good', 'others', 'value', 'sticking', 'basics', 'integrity', 'cuteness', 'case', 'following', 'one', 'heart.Although', 'buffalo', 'jump', 'metaphoric', 'are', 'many', 'real', 'ones', 'western', 'plains', 'Wyoming', 'north', 'quintessential', 'Buffalo', 'Jump', 'southern', 'Alberta', 'landscape', 'film.Should', 'make', 'pilgrimage', 'see', 'locations', 'film', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'nearby', 'scenery', 'shot', 'film', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'north', 'Montana', 'border', 'up', 'towards', 'Calagary', 'then', 'Jasper', 'NP.It', 'scenery', 'so', 'beautiful', 'loaded', 'content', 'will', 'capture', 'not', 'break', 'heart']",N/A

The first thing that impressed me was the gorgeous scenery.  The mountains in the background were breathtaking.  It's not a guy kind of movie, but for the true romantic it's a must have for your video library.  Parts were played well and the characters believable.There were a couple of real hard to believe scenes.  It's hard to believe that the nude romps in the creek never amounted to more than a brief kiss and the continuation of a ""business"" arrangement.  The male star hunk chomped on his toothpick 24/7 except for that occasional kiss.  It was a sexy touch once, but it could have been dropped from the rest of the movie AND as any well bred cowgirl (or cowboy) knows it isn't a very bright cowboy who breaks from a chute to bulldog a steer with that toothpick in his mouth!!

820735,A1I26MCX1KHFV5,B00020X8YI,Kathryn165,"[0, 0]","Sophie inherits an Alberta prairie ranch, and over the objections of her demanding, childish, wounded, self-absorbed mother, she determines to make a go of it.  Sophie is a university graduate and talented pianist, and her mother believes she should have a more sophisticated, exciting future than what awaits her as a lifetime rancher.Ranching is hard work and, as with any task, collaboration makes it much less daunting, so Sophie hires Alex, an ambitious, hard-working, local ranch hand, to help with daily operations.  He is at once unassuming and presumptuous, if such a combination is at all possible.Both Sophie and Alex are young, attractive and likeable characters, and it seems perfectly natural that they would be drawn to each other, but the surprise is how their relationship finds its start; Alex proposes marriage so Sophie can keep her ranch &#8211; and so can HE!The story is a sweet one, actually.  It follows the leading characters as they learn more about themselves and each other, and learn to love and respect the qualities that will help them build a solid partnership. Ultimately, we know they really do love each other, but it takes a long time for both of them to overcome her persistent doubts.  From the start, Alex has no doubts at all.I didn&#8217;t give this film the highest rating for a variety of reasons.  Mostly, I thought screenwriters dropped the ball, and the narrative was incomplete.  It contained marvelous, short clips of breathtaking landscapes that must have been directed by the Alberta Tourist Board, but the time should have been devoted to supporting characters' development and exploration.  I noticed that many action scenes, too, were just short clips, generally unconnected to the scenes that preceded or followed.  I also lamented the fact that there&#8217;s no sense of time in the telling of the story &#8211; how long did it take for them to go from Sophie&#8217;s father&#8217;s funeral to her wedding?  Was it months, seasons, or years?Why did Sophie&#8217;s mother, Vera, leave Scotland and settle on a ranch in the middle of nowhere?  We know she came from wealth, so how did she end up on the prairie?  Though she never actually said it in the film, she obviously hated and resented all the years she was consigned to such a simple, humble, challenging life.And then there&#8217;s Sophie&#8217;s best friend, Eleanor.  Have they known each other all their lives, or did they grow their friendship in college, or in Big City life after graduation?  We know very little about Eleanor, only that she is a real estate agent, a loyal friend, and she&#8217;s very brash &#8211; to the point of being downright coarse; she shows up to collude with Vera in schemes to push Sophie into selling the ranch &#8230; and leave Alex behind, of course.Wendy Crewson and Paul Gross were well-cast as Sophie and Alex, I think, but some of the ancillary characters simply didn&#8217;t enjoy the same kind of honest portrayal.  If I want to know more about the characters and events, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to find the book.",3,"A sweet story, but rather incomplete ...",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,3071,"['Sophie', 'Alberta', 'prairie', 'ranch', 'objections', 'demanding', 'childish', 'wounded', 'self-absorbed', 'mother', 'make', 'go', 'Sophie', 'university', 'graduate', 'talented', 'pianist', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'exciting', 'future', 'what', 'lifetime', 'rancher.Ranching', 'hard', 'work', 'task', 'collaboration', 'much', 'less', 'daunting', 'so', 'Sophie', 'hires', 'Alex', 'ambitious', 'hard-working', 'local', 'ranch', 'hand', 'help', 'daily', 'operations', 'once', 'unassuming', 'presumptuous', 'combination', 'Sophie', 'Alex', 'are', 'young', 'attractive', 'likeable', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'other', 'surprise', 'how', 'relationship', 'start', 'Alex', 'marriage', 'so', 'Sophie', 'can', 'keep', 'ranch', '8211', 'so', 'can', 'HE', 'story', 'sweet', 'one', 'actually', 'leading', 'characters', 'learn', 'more', 'other', 'learn', 'love', 'respect', 'qualities', 'will', 'help', 'build', 'solid', 'partnership', 'Ultimately', 'know', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'other', 'long', 'time', 'overcome', 'persistent', 'doubts', 'start', 'Alex', 'doubts', 'all.I', 'didn', '8217', 'give', 'film', 'highest', 'rating', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Mostly', 'thought', 'screenwriters', 'dropped', 'ball', 'narrative', 'was', 'incomplete', 'contained', 'marvelous', 'short', 'clips', 'breathtaking', 'landscapes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'Alberta', 'Tourist', 'Board', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'supporting', 'characters', 'development', 'exploration', 'noticed', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'too', 'were', 'just', 'short', 'clips', 'generally', 'unconnected', 'scenes', 'preceded', 'followed', 'also', 'lamented', 'fact', '8217', 'sense', 'time', 'telling', 'story', '8211', 'how', 'long', 'did', 'take', 'go', 'Sophie', '8217', 'father', '8217', 's', 'funeral', 'wedding', 'Was', 'months', 'seasons', 'years', 'Why', 'did', 'Sophie', '8217', 'mother', 'Vera', 'leave', 'Scotland', 'settle', 'ranch', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'know', 'came', 'wealth', 'how', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'prairie', 'never', 'actually', 'said', 'film', 'obviously', 'hated', 'resented', 'years', 'was', 'consigned', 'such', 'simple', 'humble', 'challenging', 'life.And', 'then', '8217', 'Sophie', '8217', 'best', 'friend', 'Eleanor', 'Have', 'known', 'other', 'lives', 'did', 'grow', 'friendship', 'college', 'Big', 'City', 'life', 'graduation', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Eleanor', 'only', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'loyal', 'friend', '8217', 'very', 'brash', '8211', 'point', 'being', 'downright', 'coarse', 'up', 'collude', 'Vera', 'schemes', 'push', 'Sophie', 'selling', 'ranch', '8230', 'leave', 'Alex', 'course.Wendy', 'Crewson', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'were', 'well-cast', 'Sophie', 'Alex', 'think', 'ancillary', 'characters', 'simply', 'didn', '8217', 'enjoy', 'same', 'kind', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'events', 'suppose', '8217', 'll', 'have', 'find', 'book']",N/A
