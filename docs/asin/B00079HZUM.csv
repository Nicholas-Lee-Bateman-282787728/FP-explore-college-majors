878828,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00079HZUM,Andy Orrock,"[1, 2]","Richard Eyre's underrated 'Stage Beauty' never found its legs during its US release, hauling in a scandalously low $782,000 (!) according to Boxoffice Mojo.  That's a shame, because 'Beauty' is definitely worth a look-see, most notably for the tour de force acting job turned in by Billy Crudup.  I recently saw his Broadway turn in the 'The Pillowman' and this guy can flat-out act.  His Pillowman role feautured torrents of rushed monologues.  Here in 'Beauty,' he pulls deeply from his Shakespearean background and delivers like a natural-born 17th-Century Brit.The stand-out scene is one in which we literally watch the birth of naturalistic acting (""Brando-style acting"" as Eyre refers to it in the ""Making of..."" DVD extra).  We see a realistically terrified Clare Danes warding off Crudup's on-stage assault while the audience sits paralyzed and transfixed, unable to discern between real-life and acting.  It's explosive stuff.There are other tabloid-ish reasons to watch: as a result of 'Beauty,' Crudup left seven-months pregnant girlfriend Mary-Louise Parker and hooked up with Danes.

878829,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00079HZUM,Benjamin,"[2, 4]","Billy Crudup's performance as suddenly out-of-work and without-identity actor Ned Kynaston is the main reason to see this period film about how England, under the rule of Charles II, made the transition from male-only theater to allowing females on stage.Kynaston, known from Samuel Pepys' diaries, is the most famous male actor playing women on the stage at the film's opening. Crudup plays him as a confused, thoroughly trained transsexual. Though he is a man, Kynaston sees himself only valuable and only beautiful as a woman. He attracts attention and male favor as a woman. He, thus, only knows how to act onstage as a woman, adopting severe mannerisms from the period's acting style to express his emotion. His Desdemona dies beautifully and without fight every night ""Othello"" is staged, garnering Kynaston a standing ovation before the play actually ends.His dresser Moira, played by Claire Danes, performs Desdemona using Kynaston's mannerisms at a pub in a one-off performance, and she suddenly becomes a sensation as the first-ever real female ""actress"" on the English stage. Still, all she knows to do is mimic Kynaston, so she's not a very good actress, even though she's the first of her kind.This leads to the switching of their roles. Suddenly, Moira is in demand, whereas Kynaston is without identity or work and completely lost.They argue and fight, particularly because of Kynaston's ego and inability to accept the help his ""rival"" offers, but their only way out of the situation may be by helping one another.Comparisons to ""Shakespeare in Love"" come obviously to ""Stage Beauty,"" but ""Shakespeare in Love"" was more absurdly comic and a bit more fun. ""Stage Beauty"" seeks to answer questions regarding actual sexual identity, only it doesn't fully do what it sets out to do.It does work as an exercise in changing acting style, though, and Crudup hits all the right notes in every scene as Kynaston.

At times a period drama, at times a farce, at times a romantic movie, it kept on taking me deeper and deeper into the characters and into the story. Granted the history within it might not be that accurate, but as the director of the picture says in the DVD features, historical accuracy was not what was aimed for here. The history of men in theater playing female roles just provided a perfect backdrop for exploring a vast range of emotions and feelings, digging a little into the subtlety and complexity of human nature.I loved both leads here and the cast in general. I was very taken aback to find out that the male lead was American as he sounded impeccable in his British accent. I was also taken aback to discover I have already seen and loved this actor in two other movies: Waking Dead and Almost Famous, two movies I also enjoyed very much, in part because of this very talented male actor. He is very versatile and radiates on screen.As far as the story goes, I loved how it evolved but was particularly taken by the ending: the rehearsal and final staging of the play with the male lead playing Othello was fantastic and gave me goose bumps.Also very mellow soothing music, nice sets, great costumes accentuating the ""farce"" moments of the picture and a delightful performance of Rupert Everett as the King. I wouldn't have cast him in this role, but I would have been wrong, as he is indeed quite perfect for it.An all round positive and moving experience.",5,Excellent movie,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,1548,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'times', 'period', 'drama', 'times', 'farce', 'times', 'romantic', 'movie', 'kept', 'taking', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'characters', 'story', 'Granted', 'history', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'accurate', 'director', 'picture', 'DVD', 'features', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'aimed', 'here', 'history', 'men', 'theater', 'playing', 'female', 'roles', 'just', 'provided', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'exploring', 'vast', 'range', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'digging', 'little', 'subtlety', 'complexity', 'human', 'nature.I', 'loved', 'leads', 'here', 'cast', 'general', 'was', 'very', 'taken', 'aback', 'find', 'out', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'American', 'sounded', 'impeccable', 'British', 'accent', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'aback', 'discover', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'loved', 'actor', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'two', 'movies', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'very', 'talented', 'male', 'actor', 'very', 'versatile', 'screen.As', 'far', 'story', 'loved', 'how', 'evolved', 'was', 'particularly', 'taken', 'ending', 'rehearsal', 'final', 'staging', 'play', 'male', 'lead', 'playing', 'Othello', 'was', 'fantastic', 'gave', 'goose', 'bumps.Also', 'very', 'mellow', 'soothing', 'music', 'nice', 'sets', 'great', 'costumes', 'accentuating', 'farce', 'moments', 'picture', 'delightful', 'performance', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'King', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cast', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'indeed', 'quite', 'perfect', 'it.An', 'round', 'positive', 'moving', 'experience']",Stage Beauty

878832,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00079HZUM,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","It's London in the 1660's when women were forbidden by law to appear on the stage. Female roles were played by male actors who were raised and trained for this specialty. The greatest of them is Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) and we meet him on stage while he's playing Desdemona's death scene. Maria (Claire Danes), his dresser, wants two things...to be an actor and to have Ned. When Charles II issues a decree that henceforth women only may play women's roles, Ned's world crashes to the ground. As he says, ""Where's the art in a woman playing a woman?"" Maria's world changes just as radically.This is a terrific movie about theater and gender. Kynaston is a man who plays women who now must learn to play men. He's gay, he's straight, he's bi, and he doesn't think seriously about all that...only that he must act. Maria is a woman who wants to play women but only knows how to play men playing women because that's all she's ever seen. Eventually, Ned shows Maria how to be a woman playing a woman, and Maria shows Ned how to be a man playing a man. And while Ned's nature may not make him a candidate for heterosexual monogamy, it's likely that Ned and Maria will enjoy each other's pleasure and company for a while, as well as new fame. ""Who are you now?"" she asks him, after their triumph on the stage, she as Desdemona to his Othello. ""I don't know, I don't know,"" he says, and they both laugh and kiss.Crudup does an extraordinary job. He plays Desdemona in full costume, he plays Othello, he plays bi, he plays straight, he plays gay. He's believable. He has the looks, the masculinity and the screen presence to become one of Hollywood's pretty star leads like Tom and Brad and Leo, but he spends his time acting in New York and taking quirky screen roles like this one.Claire Danes brings innocence, ambition and directness to her part, and is excellent.The movie also is full of the kind of memorable character actors that only Britain seems to produce, such as Tom Wilkinson, Edward Fox and Rupert Everett. Richard Griffiths almost steals the show as an obese, condescending, malicious, superficial and lascivious old noble who becomes Maria's sponsor and winds up helping both Maria and Ned.",5,An Excellent Movie of Gender and the Theater,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,2204,"['London', '1660', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'forbidden', 'law', 'appear', 'stage', 'Female', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'male', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'raised', 'trained', 'specialty', 'greatest', 'Ned', 'Kynaston', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'meet', 'stage', 'playing', 'Desdemona', 'death', 'scene', 'Maria', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'dresser', 'two', 'things', 'be', 'actor', 'have', 'Ned', 'When', 'Charles', 'II', 'issues', 'decree', 'women', 'only', 'may', 'play', 'women', 'roles', 'Ned', 'world', 'crashes', 'ground', 'Where', 'art', 'woman', 'playing', 'woman', 'Maria', 'world', 'just', 'radically.This', 'terrific', 'movie', 'theater', 'gender', 'Kynaston', 'man', 'who', 'women', 'who', 'now', 'must', 'learn', 'play', 'men', 'gay', 'straight', 'bi', ""n't"", 'think', 'seriously', 'only', 'must', 'act', 'Maria', 'woman', 'who', 'play', 'women', 'only', 'how', 'play', 'men', 'playing', 'women', 'ever', 'seen', 'Eventually', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'how', 'be', 'woman', 'playing', 'woman', 'Maria', 'shows', 'Ned', 'how', 'be', 'man', 'playing', 'man', 'Ned', 'nature', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'candidate', 'heterosexual', 'monogamy', 'likely', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'will', 'enjoy', 'other', 'pleasure', 'company', 'while', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'fame', 'Who', 'are', 'now', 'triumph', 'stage', 'Desdemona', 'Othello', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'kiss.Crudup', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'Desdemona', 'full', 'costume', 'Othello', 'bi', 'straight', 'gay', 'believable', 'looks', 'masculinity', 'screen', 'presence', 'become', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'pretty', 'star', 'Tom', 'Brad', 'Leo', 'time', 'acting', 'New', 'York', 'taking', 'quirky', 'screen', 'roles', 'one.Claire', 'Danes', 'innocence', 'ambition', 'directness', 'part', 'excellent.The', 'movie', 'also', 'full', 'kind', 'memorable', 'character', 'actors', 'only', 'Britain', 'produce', 'such', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'almost', 'show', 'obese', 'condescending', 'malicious', 'superficial', 'lascivious', 'old', 'noble', 'who', 'Maria', 'sponsor', 'up', 'helping', 'Maria', 'Ned']",Stage Beauty

878834,A1IWA90FHZZO3V,B00079HZUM,Dale Smith,"[6, 13]","Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think every man who put on a dress, and acted on stage in the 17th century was a homosexual.  This is the impression that the movie left me with.To tell that story is fine, but it bothers me to see it somewhat graphically depicted on screen.  It also bothers me to think that every man who put on a dress in the 17th century as a way out of the gutter, as Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) is a homosexual.  I believe the exact line is: ""my tutor found me in the gutter, and taught me, and now I make my living at it.""In my opinion this is what the movie is about.  An actor making a living playing women on stage (Billy Crudup).  We have a woman who wants to act but cannot because she is prohibited by law (Claire Danes).  King Charles (Rupert Everett) changes the law because of his mistress (Zoe Tapper) and (Claire Danes).  Leaving (Billy Crudup) angry and without a job.Now, who says the male actor in this story has to also have the additional difficulty of being homosexual.  It's only Hollywood trying to be politically correct and appeal to another segment of society to try to get their dollars.You should see this movie if you like period pieces, or you are interested in the 17th century or you want to see some fine acting.

878835,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00079HZUM,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","As a general rule, I try to avoid movies featuring men dressed as women.  In the case of Stage Beauty, though, the cross-dressing is built upon the historic foundation of male-only performers in the 17th century London theatre.  Claire Danes sweetened the pot enough for me to seek this movie out.  I can't say I'm all that enamored with the film, though.  It is sort of artsy, the kind of movie that makes you feel like you're supposed to adore it - but I just don't.  Billy Crudup turned in a brave, amazing performance, but the story didn't completely click for me, and - I hate to say it - Claire Danes' performance came up a little short, as her character seemed to lack depth.  Then there's the whole chemistry thing - basically, there isn't much of it to be found between Crudup and Danes, making the romantic angle of the story sort of weird and confusing.As we all know, there was a time centuries ago when women were prohibited from performing on stage; instead, men played all the female characters.  Here, Ned Kynaston (Crudup) is the most acclaimed ""female"" actor in 17th-century London, bringing the house down in roles such as Othello's Desdemona.  Claire Danes plays his dresser, Maria.  She studies his every move onstage and secretly performs the role herself at a nearby tavern.  Kynaston finds out about Maria's acting debut at a royal dinner, but his attempt to cast calumny upon it backfires when King Charles decides to allow women to perform.  Kynaston is necessarily a little unhappy about this, and he flat-out refuses to perform with Maria or any other woman onstage.  Charles' little minx of a mistress soon talks (well, it's not really talking, but it does involve her mouth) the king into forbidding men to play female parts altogether.  The celebrated Kynaston, ""queen"" of the London stage, is now without a job; to make matters worse, he's given a thorough thrashing by Maria's supporters.  Kynaston, unwilling to play a male role, soon hits bottom - and it's really not pretty.  Maria has a few problems of her own, as well; as celebrated as she is as the first woman of the London stage, she's not really a very good actress.  Might it be that Maria and Kynaston need each other in order to find success and happiness?This movie is really all about Billy Crudup and his character.  There's one particularly poignant scene wherein Kynaston tries to show how easy it is to play a man - and fails miserably.  Kynaston doesn't want to play men because there's no art involved in it, nor is there any beauty.  He doesn't want to let the beauty die.  He has spent years training for his profession, knows more about being a woman that Maria does, and feels utterly betrayed.  It's a surprisingly powerful, emotional argument that gives the film a depth that nothing and no one else was able to supply.  Of course, the most powerful scene comes at the very end, sending the movie out on a high note indeed.Crudup is rather disturbingly feminine in his female guise; Danes, in contrast, is somewhat manly in terms of her actions and motivations.  I never understood the feelings between their two characters; there's some kind of romantic flame winking in and out somewhere, but Maria is far too unfeeling early on to make whatever passion comes later believable to me.  Anyone with a heart would take pity on the guy when he loses everything he cares about.I should mention that Stage Beauty is surprisingly risqu&eacute; on several occasions - what with Kynaston having to convince a couple of admirers that he is in fact a gentleman, a lecherous courtier making advances on Kynaston in female guise, and a perverted king (and let me say, I hope I never again see a ""king"" dressed as a woman).  There's only a modest amount of nudity, however (including one quick, slightly revealing shot of Claire Danes).  There is also, I should mention, a kissing scene without any females in attendance - not my favorite scene.In the end, my slight sense of disappointment with this film seems to come down to Claire Danes' performance.

878837,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00079HZUM,Doug Anderson,"[12, 19]","Are masculinity and feminity ""natural"" categories that provide individuals with stable identities, or are masculinity and femininity fictional roles that individuals are socially coerced to perform?These are interesting questions but really STAGE BEAUTY is not really interested in entering into any kind of debate or causing anything resembling controversy so it contents itself with examining one man's identity crisis and buries the notion that all of the genders and sexualities portrayed might just be socially coerced performances.  No one in STAGE BEAUTY seems to be perfectly comfortable with their gendered identities and the politically correct sexuality that goes along with it, however, everyone (except Kynaston played by Billy Crudup)is fairly good at acting like they know just who they are sexually and just what they desire in a mate.To its credit STAGE BEAUTY is interested in transgression but it is also interested in being an entertainment and so its moments of transgression are (cleverly or cowardly, depending upon your point of view) almost always presented as moments of comedic trespass.For instance, the pair of giggling young society girls can be attracted to Kynaston so long as ""he"" stays in character as a woman and they can veil their sexual interest in ""him"" by pretending to believe that he really is a ""she"" and that their interest is strictly social. When this veil of propriety drops away, as we know it inevitably will, and the girls openly admit that their interest is more than just social the scene is still recuperable as just a couple of sexually curious girls having some laughs. Just what the young girls curiosity/fantasies might be (it is not certain whether Kynaston being a man or a woman would prove the bigger turn on) is anyone's guess.  In any event the gender confusion is diffused in laughter and as a result the real issues (nature of gender, desire, fantasy) get buried within the comedy.  And whatever thoughts/confusions we may have about this encounter are compounded by the entrance, at the tail end of this scene, of the fop (a stock character in Restoration comedy known for his extravagnt dress, wigs and  affected speech; and also for his indeterminate sexuality)who propositions all three ""ladies"" and whose sexual interest in Kynaston does not abate when he discovers that ""she"" is really a ""he"". Later in the film there will be real repercussions for these transgressions but while they happen they are played for laughs. At times the film promises to delve into gender and sexuality issues but it repeatedly shies away from these themes each time it brings them up.In Restoration comedy the extravagant rake and fop (stock characters in many Restoration comedies ) can show an interest in both sexes but  they only do so (at least in this film) so long as their interest in males is veiled as an interest in females.  In other words Kynaston's lover, the rakish Duke of Buckinghman (played by Ben Chaplin), despite his love affair with the male actor, still perceives himself to be straight (to use a contemporary designation) because he is only interested in Kynaston while Kynaston is acting the part of a woman. Whether this is true or whether the Duke is simply performing in private one identity and in public another (and whether either of these can be said to be ""real"" or ""natural"" or ""authentic"")is debatable. What is not debatable is the fact that sodomy was a hangable offense in the 1670's ( a fact that the film never mentions), and even though the rakish libertine or celebrity actor or actress might be above the law in certain respects the courts were not the only arbiter of ""moral"" justice--the mob was less reluctant to punish a transgressive aristocrat or stage celebrity than the courts. Thus even if one takes the view that all identity (public or private) is a performance, some performances can be viewed to be coerced by convention, by law, and by public opinion. This was a time in which transgression held an irresistable allure and danger and one in which noble women as well as prostitutes often wore masks when attending the public theatre (and it was often difficult to tell which was which).  It is also a period in stage history when the actresses on stage often were considered to be little more than prostitutes. In order to present Claire Danes as an innocent spectator just absorbing the ambience of the theatre until she gets her big chance the film has to steer clear of a lot of interesting and lewd history. Nell Gwynn, the Kings mistress, would become one of the most famous actresses of her day. Though Kynaston was a real person, Maria (played by Claire Danes), the dresser and would-be actress, is an invention--scholars still cannot determine who exactly was the first English stage actress. And this character never really feels like anything but an anachronism. Claire Danes is a fine actress but her bright and cheery manner, her confident though subdued sexuality, and her super-sensitive and wholesome womanliness, feel like she is just there to keep things in the realm of the safe and the familiar.  If she can understand and sympathize with the self-aggrandizing, vain, and narcissistic Kynaston (the filmmakers seem to say) then so can we. Though some representations of masculinity and femininty are presented for critique, the notion of feminity that Claire Danes represents is offered as a natural version of femininity. Even though he is arguably not quite the right actor (I don't think anyone is going to mistake Crudup for a lady) for this role Billy Crudup does a terrific job with the part and though we never quite like Kynaston as a person we can't help but want to see him through his dilemna.This is also a period of time in which the public and the private were beginning to be viewed as separate spheres. And each of the characters in this play view the stage and the stage version of ""self"" and/or ""beauty"" in their own way. Betterton (played by Tom Wilkinson), the lead actor and leader of the company, has no problem distinguising between his public and private persona. And the King (played whimically by Rupert Everett) and his mistress are apparently fond of donning each others clothes on a private stage for fun. Kynaston, however, has a hard time making the distinction between his on-stage and off-stage selves. He does view his ""femininity"" as an act and yet it is an act that he has played in public for so long that, by force of habit, this performance has become a reality or identity for him. And when we see him in private he is never certain what or who ""he"" is. Therefore when a law is passed by the King that men shall no longer play women on stage, Kynaston experiences not only a professional but a personal identity crisis as well.Kynaston's dresser Maria shows a sexual interest in him from the beginning and, eventually, she will become the first woman to play a woman's part on the English stage and she does so, ironically, by expropriating Kynastons affected femininity. I think the fact that Claire Danes is copying Billy Crudup's verion of femininity is funny to contemporary audiences for obvious reasons but that interesting thesis evident in so many early scenes (that gender may well be an act; that all people may not be all feminine or all masculine but an interesting blend of both) gets lost when the film ceases to be about anything but a romance between two attractive stars, Danes and Crudup. The formulas of the entertainments of our own day (love interest a necessity to have a hit in a Hollywood production), therefore, are always competing and interfering with this films attempt to examine the gender and entertainment formulas of another time period.And the final scene where Kynaston attempts to play that most masculine of male roles, Othello, to the dresser's Desdemona transgresses in another way. Restoration drama was all about theatricality and the theatricality on the stage commented on the theatricality of society. The stage was a place where the constraints of social norms and forms, as well as the eternal battle between reason and the passions, could be examined. In keeping with the theme of the film it would seem that what we should get in this final perfomance of Othello is some comment about socially coerced gender roles. STAGE BEAUTY,in this final scene, however, forgets what its about and it forgets what time period it is examining and instead of socially and theatrically embedded characters and performances we get a comment on the relationship between fake violence and real violence (it would seem that when you really try to kill someone it is much more real than when you just fake it). You could argue that this scene is meant to be a comment on the realtionship between real life and the stage (and it is to a certain extent that) but if it is that then the film is saying that men should play men parts and women women parts because only then can the stage approach the ""realism"" to which it aspires. But then that really solves nothing because it just means that what audiences want from a theatrical performance is just a simulation of the real and not a comment or critique on the nature of the real (or the fact that what we experience as ""natural"" or ""real"" is mediated by culture and society). By most accounts the audiences of the 1660's were a very sophisticated coterie of aristocrats and wealthy citizens and we can presume that they were interested in more than just the thrill of simulated death scenes.  Anyway ""realism"" and/or ""naturalism"" have never been the aristocrat's forte. What the arsitocrats presumably wanted were penetrating, albeit theatricalized for effect, glimpses of themselves. And for the most part that is what restoration playwrites gave them.  Shakespeare was not particularly respected by Restoration playwrites--they perceived his naturalism to be coarse and vulger and much preferred their own artful affectation (wich they considered to be a ""second"" and superior nature)-- and so they rewrote his plays to ""improve"" them and make them suitable for (what they perceived to be) their own much more sophisticated tastes. The new ending of Othello, however, provided by Hatcher/Eyre seems more geared toward Hollywood tastes and expectations than geared toward a Restoration audiences tastes and expectations.  Restoration audiences were not immune to the allure of melodrama and sensual demostration but the melodramatic acting technique displayed by these actors, the realism or raw emoting, or whatever Hatcher/Eyre were going for does not fit the period's  ideas about acting and the role of the actor.  The trumped up Hollywood death scene/murder scene that is not a death scene/ murder scene destroys any period specific integrity the film may have had and erases what the film purported to be about. And the fact that these two characters faun over each other after the real onstage violence is inexplicable. I am still uncertain with my own interpretation of the ending.To give the film every benefit of the doubt I would say that the ending is meant to show that Kynaston finally learned to find the beauty in playing a man (or found the beauty in the role of Othello as well as in the role he formerly played, Desdemona). But this is a problematic ending which resolves nothing of Kynaston's own gender and sexual confusions--unless it means that he has finally become comfortable playing either male or female roles. However, reading the ending this way does not explain the onstage violence (unless we view it as an act of generosity to his co-star and the audience: the real violence generated a real response from his co-star who otherwise could not act, a performance to which the audience responded positively).  But that seems a ridiculous and implausible explanation. I think the movie wants us to believe that Kynaston was carried away by the moment and that he was working out his own issues while playing Othello. This reading of the ending would suggest that Kynaston's style of acting was a kind of psychodrama. And it would also suggest that he has finally found a part that he can really sink his teeth into, and it would suggest that the reason he can sink his teeth into it is because it is a male role. But this would not be consistent with earlier claims in the film and so it would make the film thematically inconsistent. Or, you could read the ending to mean that Kynaston can only be a person on stage and that no matter what part he is performing that is who he becomes.  This sounds absurd but at least it has the merit of remaining consistent with earlier claims about the performative nature of identity made in the film. And it also remains consistent with Kynaston's final statements about still not knowing who he is. Maybe on the stage-in the heat of a performance--is the only place where he can find beauty and identity.Another interpretation of the ending might go like this:  Kynaston has confused life and art; as well as confused his private and public identity.  In murdering Desdemona he is murdering his former self or attempting to. The murder would thus be a symbolic act, a ritual purging of his former role/self-- perhaps in an attempt to be reborn, publicly, on stage, as a male actor capable of playing men.  If he doesn't actually kill her it is because he finally realizes that there is a difference between life and art and between public and private performances. But if this is the case then it would seem that Claire Danes' character is ok with the fact that he had to almost kill her to arrive at such a revelation. The audience's final gasp is one of relief that Maria is still alive and exasperation at this brilliantly acted new ending of the play that was, for once, a total surprise.In real life Kynaston made the adjustment, changed with the times,and enjoyed success in male roles (at one point he played a female lead in a play one week and the male lead in the same play the next week).The film is so unusual and this period is so interesting that I would recommend it even with its peculiar failings and anachronisms.Whatever interpretation you come up with, the ending is vague at best. Perhaps it is the result of trying to wrestle with both Restoration era credibilty and Hollywood market realites.",4,Restoration Themes tainted by Hollywood Formulas,1150934400,"06 22,

Whether the role was male or female made no difference.  There were various reasons given to justify this (most of them rather chauvinistic, but that's beside the point).  It was the way things were in the realm of theatre.Then, one day in the 17th century, a mere 300 years ago, this tradition came to an abrupt end.  Women(!) started portraying women(!) in plays - on stage!  This was a truly radical idea.The present movie tells the story from an interesting angle, that of the men who played women in plays.  Billy Crudup portrays just such a man.  It's not so easy for him to merely begin playing men's roles as he was trained from adolescence on to play a WOMAN.  Period.Suddenly, Crudup's character goes from being one of the most popular actors in Europe to being on the very bottom of the actor's guild food-chain.  The story is rather heart-wrenching, and Crudup does a remarkable job of playing an actor in a very vulnerable spot.  Claire Daines is beautiful and superb as the pioneering ""first"" actress.The movie is fixated around the death scene of Desdemona in Shakespeare's OTHELLO.  I believe that this scene is picked as symbolic of the ""end of the line"" of male actors playing female roles.  Whether that assessment is correct or not is for you to decide.In any case, if you're a fan of Shakespeare, the Thespian art or Period movies in general, this film is certainly for you.

This is one of those movies that can't be great, only in the fact that it has an overused story. I've heard that it is similiar to ""Shakespere in Love,"" but since I never saw that movie, I can't really comment. What I love about ""Stage Beauty"" was the revalation of Claire Danes. She could be an amazing actress, and as such a strong female character, she stole the show, even from Billy Crudup, a great actor who stole the show in ""Almost Famous,"" and stole the scenes in ""Big Fish."" It is a period comedy-drama, and as usual, the costumes and settings were a great thing to look at. The problem with period movies is that you have to be accurate, because there is always someone that will make a comment about it not being correct. I had a problem with the direction. Half of the movie was shot without the use of a steady camera. It was done to make us be like observers, when it fact it annoyed the eyes. I'm not a huge fan of the camera when it is not steady because I could never see the point. The movement also gives us a feeling of confusion, a running theme for the main character, because it was steady during the scenes he was not in. Good reason for doing it, but a bad idea overall.Billy Crudup plays Ned Kynaston, an actor, who has been called ""the most beautiful women on stage."" He is a man, but in the late 1600's it was against the law for women to preform on stage. His dresser, Maria, does not listen to the law, and at night she runs off to act on the stage, as a women pretending to be a man who is pretending to be a women. She pays the manager money to preform, and she fools the audiences. She is eventually found out, and soon the laws change. It becomes mandatory for the women to play the women characters on the stage, and Ned becomes obsolete in the theatre. He also becomes obsolete the Duke becomes engaged to a women. The Duke was his lover, and during their sexual encounters, Ned would play the women. Ned begins to want to be back on the stage, but refuses to play opposite Maria. He has to begin to change his life, because the world around him is not.Throughout the film, Ned never really knows if he wants to be a women or a man. He is told that he is great as a women on stage, but also great as a man in real life. His confusion sets up the conflict, and it is always a question to everybody, including himself, what he is. Based on his personal life, it could be a toss up, because as he is attracted to the Duke, he is also attracted to Maria. I see a grand future for Claire Danes, who I hear has made many flops in the past. ""Stage Beauty"" is in limited release, so it won't make a ton of money, which is a shame because this movie is very entertaining. While not a great movie, it offers some good preformances, and great settings. ""Stage Beauty"" is a good bet to make a supporting apperance at the Oscars next year.ENJOY!Rated R for sexual content and language.",4,Wild Entertainment!,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,3059,"['number', 'one', 'thing', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'entertainment', 'ironic', 'what', 'most', 'characters', 'want', 'do', 'entertain', 'one', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'only', 'fact', 'overused', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'similiar', 'Shakespere', 'Love', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'comment', 'What', 'love', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'was', 'revalation', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'could', 'be', 'amazing', 'actress', 'such', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'stole', 'show', 'even', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'stole', 'scenes', 'Big', 'Fish', 'period', 'comedy-drama', 'usual', 'costumes', 'settings', 'were', 'great', 'thing', 'look', 'problem', 'period', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'accurate', 'always', 'someone', 'will', 'make', 'comment', 'not', 'being', 'correct', 'had', 'problem', 'direction', 'Half', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'use', 'steady', 'camera', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'be', 'observers', 'when', 'fact', 'annoyed', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'camera', 'when', 'not', 'steady', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'point', 'movement', 'also', 'feeling', 'confusion', 'running', 'theme', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'steady', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'Good', 'reason', 'doing', 'bad', 'idea', 'overall.Billy', 'Crudup', 'plays', 'Ned', 'Kynaston', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'called', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'stage', 'man', 'late', '1600', 'was', 'law', 'women', 'preform', 'stage', 'dresser', 'Maria', 'not', 'listen', 'law', 'night', 'act', 'stage', 'women', 'pretending', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'pretending', 'be', 'women', 'manager', 'money', 'preform', 'audiences', 'eventually', 'found', 'out', 'soon', 'laws', 'change', 'mandatory', 'women', 'play', 'women', 'characters', 'stage', 'Ned', 'obsolete', 'theatre', 'also', 'obsolete', 'Duke', 'engaged', 'women', 'Duke', 'was', 'lover', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Ned', 'would', 'play', 'women', 'Ned', 'want', 'be', 'back', 'stage', 'play', 'opposite', 'Maria', 'begin', 'change', 'life', 'world', 'film', 'Ned', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'women', 'man', 'told', 'great', 'women', 'stage', 'also', 'great', 'man', 'real', 'life', 'confusion', 'up', 'conflict', 'always', 'question', 'everybody', 'including', 'what', 'Based', 'personal', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'toss', 'up', 'attracted', 'Duke', 'also', 'attracted', 'Maria', 'see', 'grand', 'future', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'who', 'hear', 'made', 'many', 'flops', 'past', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'limited', 'release', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'ton', 'money', 'shame', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'preformances', 'great', 'settings', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'good', 'bet', 'make', 'supporting', 'apperance', 'Oscars', 'next', 'year.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'R', 'sexual', 'content', 'language']",Stage Beauty

Others have delved into the plot and basic storyline, so I'll skip that and go straight into what I thought of the film.I found the story to be that of two kindred spirits bringing out the best in each other.  In both cases, both Maria and Ned bring something out of each other that they never knew existed.  He brings out her dormant acting talent, and she brings out a side of him he could never pursue or express when he was playing female roles.  I loved how this was a story of a fully grown man trying to figure out his own identity--this isn't some teenage coming-of-age story.  I don't believe Ned's problem was as simple as having to choose a role (act like a man or act like a woman), he had to go beyond gender roles and transcend them to realize who he was as a person, and Maria facillitated this process.Billy Crudup is fantastic.  I can't believe he did not receive an oscar nod.  This film works because of him.  The role of Ned Kynaston is such a difficult one to play, but he made it his own.  Claire Danes, interestingly, plays the 'guy,' in a sense.  Like Kirsten Dunst in Wimbledon, it's the women who come and help the guys out, not the other way around like in traditional romances.  There is chemistry between the two actors, so it makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch.The climactic scene was absolutely fantastic.  I was on the edge of my seat.  The movie was deeply satisfying, and ranks as one of my favorite films I've seen within the last year, if not the favorite.

878844,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00079HZUM,Glen Engel Cox,"[2, 2]","The inevitable comparison for this movie is to Shakespeare in Love if only because it is about seventeenth century actors performing Shakespeare from moviemakers whom are more interested in the dramatic potentials of this than historical accuracy. And they're both love stories. But wheras Shakespeare in Love was too-clever-by-far (which, frankly, is not a problem for me) and devolves as much into a spot-the-connection puzzle with 1930s romantic comedy elements, the makers of Stage Beauty go for an interesting character portrayal as the heart of their movie, and the clever bits and romance are only stage dressing that adorns this beauty. Mr. Kynaston (Billy Crudup in a masterful portrayal) is an actor at the top of his chosen profession: portraying the women's parts in Elizabethean drama (mainly Desdemona, although other roles are aluded to). Maria/Mrs. Margaret Hughes (Claire Danes) is his adoring dresser, who has watched him so closely that she can mimic his part, useful in her desire to be the first woman to perform in English theater, which she does. Kynaston's egoism regading his profession along with his cynical nature leads him to make several enemies who take advantage of their positions to have him beaten, then to have the king reverse the ban on women in the theater as well as banning men from assuming women's roles. Kynaston's fall from grace mirrors Maria's rise, but that's only half the movie. Although your sympathies are with Maria--the much more likeable character--it is Kynaston who undergoes the biggest transformation and provides the movie with both pathos and message.I was surprised I liked the movie as much as I did. I think I expected more of a costume drama, tied to its historical time and place, and for the sympathies to solely be with the male actor, displaced by the march of progress. That it was neither, and yet had echoes of this, was the surprise.

At least hearing the audience delight after viewing STAGE BEAUTY makes a case for more mainstream male actors to shed the fear of taking on roles that feature gender and sexuality variations: Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem, Rodrigo Santoro, Gael Garcia Bernal, et al have all performed sensitively as gay men despite their macho image - the once small list is now respectably large. And now add Billy Crudup and Ben Chaplin to that ever-growing list. Bravo to that change.STAGE BEAUTY (in the screenplay version of his own play 'The Compleat Female Stage Beauty' by Jeffrey Hatcher) is set in the mid 17th century with all the frills and foibles of British dandies and ladies visually intact. This is the time when female roles were assumed by male actors (the theater was simply no place for ladies to participate) and we are introduced to Mr. Kynaston (in a brilliant, multifaceted performance by Billy Crudup!) as he portrays Desdemona in Shakespeare's 'Othello'. He is attended by a dresser Maria Hughes (Claire Danes, another superlative acting achievement) who longs to act and steals away after performances in the theater run by actor Betterton (Tom Wilkinson) to a tavern where she assumes the memorized roles Kynaston performs on the royally approved stage.Kynaston has been raised to portray women on stage (and indeed in life) and responds to men as a woman (his lover is the Duke of Buckingham - Ben Chaplin). King Charles II (a thorough-going hilarious fling for the gifted Rupert Everett) is convinced by his tart du jour to allow women to play women's roles on the stage, thus dethroning Kynaston as the actress of the time, driving him into tawdry masquerades in pubs after a severe beating from thugs beckoned by the bloated Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths). Maria Hughes thus becomes the first 'compleat female actress' and this transition between Kynaston and Maria results in desperate tutoring lessons before Maria can play Desdemona for the King. For the first time in his life Kynaston must examine his own sexuality and his successful final curtain after playing Othello to Maria's Desdemona gratefully leaves that choice up in the air.The script is a delight, the actors are all first rate, especially the wholly immersed Crudup and Danes who could well be part of the Royal Shakespeare Company, so fine is their British sound, demeanor, and Shakespeare! The supporting cast is a kaleidoscope of jewel-like performances from Everett, Wilkinson, Edward Fox, Hugh Bonneville among others. The mood is appropriately British - all dark, candlelit stagecraft and foggy marsh vistas - and the music matches the overall picture. Richard Eyre has directed a film that deserves many kudos, but the main glory should shine on his ability to explore the spectrum of gender and sexuality with dignity, intelligence, and tremendous sensitivity.

878846,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B00079HZUM,Hikari,"[13, 14]","Whether you're a Shakespeare buff, or a fan of the theatre in any period, you can't afford to miss this one!  Comparisons to Shakespeare in Love are inevitable, down to the framework of a Shakespearian play-within-a-play, and the central role of an appealing blonde actress struggling against societal mores to claim her dream of taking the stage.  I am not in accord with those reviewers who regard Stage Beauty as Shakespeare in Love-lite, however.  It's `compleatly' the other way around  . . .with its darker tone & far more complex screenplay, Stage Beauty tackles ground which the earlier film dreamt not of.  Whereas Shakespeare in Love was rather like a jolly Disney ride through Shakespearian London, Stage Beauty reflects a much grittier, often unflinching, portrait of what life was like in the thespian milieu, circa 1660.`Stage Beauty is set some 60-odd years after the action of Shakespeare in Love-the Bard, long gone, is a voice in the film only through his play  Othello.  Billy  Crudup (in a tour-de-force performance) is Edward `Ned' Kynaston, the reigning `leading lady' of the London stage.  Bringing the house down night after night as Desdemona, Ned revels in his life as the top celebrity diva in town.  He is attended by his faithful dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), who longs to act herself, and has memorized his performance as she watches every night from the wings.  Ned and Maria have a complicated relationship; he treats her like a servant, yet seems to have more tender feelings for her as well, feelings which she secretly shares.  Further complicating matters is Ned's homosexual relationship with the Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin).  Even though Ned has sex with men, and has been trained from boyhood to project a feminine demeanor, he can't live his life offstage as a woman.  And even though a `manly' mode of being feels unnatural, his underlying masculinity is always showing through his mask of painstakingly cultivated femininity.  The world `pansexual' could have been coined for him.  One of the strengths of the film is how it captures the fluidity of sexuality prevalent at the time . . .Ned is a man who plays women, yet women respond to the person under the costume.  Ned sleeps with a man who rejects him for a `real' woman, and yet at the same time, Ned finds himself attracted to his female dresser.  At this time, dressing in drag was thought to be the height of hilarity, and even the King could wear a dress to the vast entertainment of his guests.  In this overheated atmosphere of sexual confusion, and blurring of gender identity labels, this time seems not a great deal different than our own.Ned tumbles from the pinnacle of success to the dregs of society almost overnight as a number of misfortunes pile up at once:  Maria's performance as the first female Desdemona in an underground theatre production catches the attention of the Court, leading the King to grant permission for women to perform on stage.  When Ned inadvertently insults the King's mistress, this leniency hardens into a ban against male actors playing any women's parts.  Suddenly unemployable in the only field he knows, Ned is severely beaten by thugs hired by Maria's patron, and starts to slip into alcoholism.  Rejected by the stage for not being a `real' woman, he is rejected by his noble lover for the same crime.  When he has reached bottom, redemption comes from an unexpected quarter-an opportunity to return to the stage in Othello, this time playing the man's part . . . opposite the woman who stole his livelihood, and in his eyes, his very life.  Once again the lines between stage and reality blur, as the Moor and Ned have both been wounded deeply by women they love, and both have `cause' for revenge.  The scene where Maria & Ned are reunited on stage is as breathlessly compelling for us as it must have been for the first audiences witnessing naturalistic performances on the stage.I really can't rave about this film enough.  Billy Crudup carries the film in a multifaceted and grueling part.  He does make a pretty girl, too, though I prefer him as a guy.  Claire Danes hits the right note as Maria . . .low-key and in the background when that is called for, and then radiant or petulant by turns when that is called for.  She does not swan about self-assuredly like the lady of noble birth slumming on the boards like Gwneth Paltrow's Lady Viola in Shakespeare in Love; Maria is a commoner, someone who has had to survive a hardscrabble existence by hard work, her wits and by her loyalty to her employer.  When she betrays that loyalty and sets the events of the movie in motion, it is for her deeply-felt conviction that acting is more than a lark or a hobby, it is something she must do, even if she does it badly.  An all-star cast lends support, including Hugh Bonneville as an endearingly befuddled Samuel Pepys, perpetual diarist (One of my favorite lines is when Ben Chaplin as the Duke of Buckingham tells Ned: `If two mice were in a nutshell screwing, Pepys would find a way to squeeze in and write it down'), and Rupert Everett, in a wry, campy performance as Charles II, looking rather like he wandered over from the Three Musketeers set, but having a wonderful time.  Tom Wilkinson plays Mr. Betterton, the owner of Ned's theatre and his co-star, an enthusiastically bad Othello.  Also deserving mention is newcomer Zoe Tropper, who is a delightfully bawdy and pulchritudinous Nell Gwynn.  Asked about her parentage, Nell responds, cheerfully, ""Me mum was a whore; me dad was in the Navy . . .that's why I don't do sailors!""If  watching Stage Beauty isn't as addictive as chocolate (I watched it twice in two days), and if it doesn't make you want to go out immediately and get your local library's copy of Othello so you can revisit Desdemona's death scene, then tack a mustache on me

878848,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00079HZUM,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[19, 25]","I have always been a sucker for period costume dramas, and while ""Stage Beauty"" is not ""Shakespeare In Love,"" it's not too shabby either. Billy Crudup's performance is absolutely fantabulous!! He plays Edward ""Ned"" Knyaston, the renowned and beautiful 17th century English actor, trained to portray dramas' leading ladies.' Of course, the film is flawed, frequently overblown, much too busy, and often, not credible - but Crudup's acting, is really worth the price of the rental - along with the gorgeous wardrobe, a few outstanding comic moments, and the Method acting lesson near the film's conclusion.During the Restoration, King Charles II actually made headlines when he broke with history and declared it legal for women to play female characters onstage. But, what then happened to all the talented, professional actors who had heretofore dedicated themselves to playing heroines? Such a one is Ned Knyaston, he of the face that could launch a thousand ships. And thus, our plot. Ned's dresser, Maria, (Clare Danes), clearly worships the actor and fancies herself an actress. She also fancies herself in love. And, when she is given a shot at acting, she gets Desdemona down pat - as a male trained to play a female would play the part. In other words, she mimics Ned perfectly. Her ""in love"" fantasy is a problem too. Ned prefers men.The film is at its best when Knyaston, after his denouement, is left alone to face his own arrogance, and confront the loss of his career, which has been his life and his identity. As a young boy, he was taken off the streets, trained to act and to supress everything male in order to portray a female. Unfortunately, we, the audience, are led to believe that even though his sexual identity, and preference, are firmly established as homosexual, ultimately that's all up for grabs. My principal issue with the movie is that it leads one to believe that homosexuality is a ""problem"" which can be solved, or cured, by a beautiful leading lady. Not. Nor is one's sexuality a decision most have control over. Crudup does lend credibility and complexity to his part, however. He can be flirtatiously feminine and naughty, and extremely masculine. I just wish they had tabled the love story, which is not necessary to the plot, and I think cheapens it.Clare Danes who plays an actress who cannot act, works well with what she has been given, script-wise. She is extremely talented but there is little chemistry, of the romantic kind, between her and Crudup.  And this is clearly Crudup's movie. Ben Chaplin is excellent as the fickle Duke of Buckingham, filled with the ennui of the rich and famous. On the other hand, I so did not like the buffoonish depiction of King Charles II, (Rupert Everett). Historically, the portrayal of the king is off, off, off!!! He was neither deranged nor a flake, and while he had many famous mistresses, he was not one to be led around by whimsical women. Charles II was, actually, quite royal and  a popular monarch, although wig-bedecked, as befitted the period's fashion. And the King's Nell Gwynn was an acclaimed actress long before she met the merry monarch. I also doubt she spoke with a Cockney accent. Hugh Bonneville is wonderful as Samuel Pepys, another historical figure, who documented the goings-on of the times.

Davis ""Jeffrey Matthew Davis""","[7, 8]","Despite how much I've enjoyed some movies this summer, such as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Batman Begins, the lackluster movie season has made me turn to DVDs.A few nights ago I rented Stage Beauty starring Billy Crudup and Claire Daines and got a pleasant suprise. The film was a wonderful blend of comedy and drama. The story, set in London circa 1660, centered around Ned Kynaston (Crudup), a famous bisexual actor who plays women on the Elizabethan stage. His dresser, Maria (Daines), wishes to be an actress, despite a royal decree that only men can act. Still, Maria finds a loophole and under the stage-name Margaret Hughes she performs, impresses the mistress of the King, and inspires a law that forbids men from playing women. Kynaston is therefore out of a job and blames his downfall on his former friend, but of course he eventually falls in love with her.  In short, it's a tale of sexual politics told to perfection.I was initially skeptical about this film as I've never been a big fan of Claire Daines, and though I've always found Billy Crudup attractive, I've never thought of him as a great actor, especially one that could convincingly portray a man who in many ways identifies himself as a woman. However both shine in this film, and the chemestry between them is electrical. Their sex scene together--in which they substitute nudity with simply kissing and running their fingers over eachother--was one of the most beautiful and sensual sex scenes I've ever seen. It probably helped that they fell for eachother in real life over the course of this film, prompting Crudup to leave his wife, Mary Louise-Parker, while she was pregnant.The supporting cast of this film is stellar, too. Rupert Everett is a riot as the King, and unkown Zoe Tapper makes an astonishing debut as his mistress. The excellent cast, paired with exquisite writing, made for an entirely enjoyable film.I'm sure it must be hard to make a dramatic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatic, especially when it's a period piece as well, but Stage Beauty pulls it off with flair. Though on many occasions I felt totally emotionally invested in the characters, especially in the stirring conclusion to the film, at other times I was laughing out loud. This film is full of quotable lines and exchanges, such as when the King says, ""Why shouldn't we have women on stage? After all, the French have been doing it for years,"" and his advisor replies, ""Whenever we're about to do something truly horrible, we always say that the French have been doing it for years.""Whether you are a fan of period pieces or love Billy Crudup and Claire Daines, rent this film.  I sincerely hope it goes down in the books as one of the most under-rated films of 2004.  This one was way more Oscar-worthy than the pile of dung otherwise known as The Aviator.  If I keep telling myself ""I have to buy this"" as I'm watching it, you know it's gotta be good...well, that or I have a major DVD buying problem...or both.",4,Stage Beauty is Beautiful Filmmaking,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2981,"['how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'summer', 'such', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'lackluster', 'movie', 'season', 'made', 'turn', 'DVDs.A', 'few', 'nights', 'rented', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'starring', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'got', 'pleasant', 'suprise', 'film', 'was', 'wonderful', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'story', 'set', 'London', 'circa', '1660', 'centered', 'Ned', 'Kynaston', 'Crudup', 'famous', 'bisexual', 'actor', 'who', 'women', 'Elizabethan', 'stage', 'dresser', 'Maria', 'Daines', 'be', 'actress', 'royal', 'decree', 'only', 'men', 'can', 'act', 'Still', 'Maria', 'loophole', 'stage-name', 'Margaret', 'Hughes', 'mistress', 'King', 'law', 'men', 'playing', 'women', 'Kynaston', 'therefore', 'job', 'downfall', 'former', 'friend', 'course', 'eventually', 'love', 'short', 'tale', 'sexual', 'politics', 'told', 'perfection.I', 'was', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Claire', 'Daines', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'attractive', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'great', 'actor', 'especially', 'one', 'could', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'man', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'identifies', 'woman', 'However', 'shine', 'film', 'chemestry', 'electrical', 'sex', 'scene', 'together', 'substitute', 'nudity', 'simply', 'kissing', 'running', 'fingers', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'sensual', 'sex', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'helped', 'fell', 'eachother', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'film', 'prompting', 'Crudup', 'leave', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Louise-Parker', 'was', 'pregnant.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'stellar', 'too', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'riot', 'King', 'unkown', 'Zoe', 'Tapper', 'astonishing', 'debut', 'mistress', 'excellent', 'cast', 'paired', 'exquisite', 'writing', 'made', 'entirely', 'enjoyable', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'make', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'as', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'especially', 'when', 'period', 'piece', 'well', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'off', 'flair', 'many', 'occasions', 'felt', 'totally', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'especially', 'stirring', 'conclusion', 'film', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'film', 'full', 'quotable', 'lines', 'exchanges', 'such', 'when', 'King', 'Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'women', 'stage', 'French', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'advisor', 'replies', ""'re"", 'do', 'something', 'truly', 'horrible', 'always', 'say', 'French', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'are', 'fan', 'period', 'pieces', 'love', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'rent', 'film', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'down', 'books', 'one', 'most', 'under-rated', 'films', '2004', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'Oscar-worthy', 'pile', 'dung', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Aviator', 'keep', 'telling', 'have', 'buy', ""'m"", 'watching', 'know', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'good', 'well', 'have', 'major', 'DVD', 'buying', 'problem']",Stage Beauty

Claire Danes and Billy Crudup were magnificent but the true star was Rupert Everett as King Charles II.  Everett is without a doubt the most incredible actor to ever portray Charles II.  If they ever made a documentary on Charles II anytime in the future, they should again seek out the acting abilities of Everett.  Not only does he look exactly like Charles II, his manners, style of walk, and an overall ability to impart a sense that he really is Charles II is absolutely incredible.  Anyone that likes a good love story will like this movie.  Anyone who likes any type of period drama, will love this.  Anyone who is interested in Charles II, may enjoy this movie.  Anyone who is interested in the 17th century monarchy and aristocracy may enjoy this movie.  Overall, it is a good movie and enjoyable to watch.  The movie rarely has any down time or real slow parts other than a few spots in the beginning but they are not bad at all, and they are very watchable, just not fast paced.  In fact, the entire movie is not fast paced either now that I think about it, but it is WATCHABLE to be sure.  I do think that any aspiring actor or actress should be mandated to watch this movie.  It also should be standard for teachers/professors to show this in college or high school level acting classes.  Not only does it introduce the student to what acting is like, it also gives them an idea what being an actor or actress would have been like in the 17th century, persecuting women as actresses (which was forbidden at that time) but seeing how Charles II (his mistress begging) insisted by issuing a Royal degree that women women would from that time forward be allowed to play women in stage productions in England.  This was an incredible milestone at that time in history and due to Charles II being returned to the throne after his exile, he was feeling more generous and wanted to do the will of the people, rather than the will of his ministers who were totally against his decision.  Charles II was very worried at the time of the restoration of what the people thought and wanted and he did everything in his effort to appease the people.  Charles II was keenly aware that his own father had been executed years before and he didn't want anything to jeopardize his own reign or secure the future of his descendants.  For any aspiring student of theater, you will be pleased with this movie.  For everyone else, I think most would enjoy this love story.

878855,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00079HZUM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[24, 26]","Comparisons between ""Stage Beauty"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are inevitable, but this 2004 film does not suffer much by the contrast to that Oscar winner for Best Picture.  Both films deal with the conventions of the English stage that dictated the roles of women be played by men and while both have a woman who wants to play a woman's role, this one has a man who wants to play only women's roles.  Both films conclude with a live performance in which the focal character ends up playing the opposite of their original roles.  Both films are intricately involved with the Shakespeare plays being performed to such an extent that it goes beyond life imitating art.  But whereas ""Shakespeare in Love"" was about writing and love, ""Stage Beauty"" is about acting and love, and I think it is ultimately more about its primary artistic focus than about romance.When it comes to performing the classical plays of Shakespeare or the tragedies of the ancient Greeks, I believe in realistic (nee naturalistic) acting rather than following the acting conventions of those periods in contemporary performances.  I enjoy those conventions, but I also think that if you can break the poetic constraints of the dialogue you can make those texts come alive for contemporary audiences.  So one of the reasons ""Stage Beauty"" resonates so strong for me is that it not only endorses but also celebrates the idea that such realism can have much more of a profound impact on an audience that those historically accurate sytlistic conventions.Half the inspiration for the original play ""Compleat Female Stage Beauty"" was when playwright Jeffrey Hatcher came across an entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys (Hugh Bonneville) that the actor Ned Kynaston was the most beautiful woman in the house when he was portraying one upon the stage.  The other half was the decision of Charles II (Rupert Everett) to not only revoke the prohibition of women acting on stage, but to declare instead that henceforth only women would play female roles on the English stage.  Thus we have the story of the most famous female impersonator of his day suddenly thrust into a world where he is no longer allowed to do what he does best.Billy Crudup plays Kynaston and his success as a woman on stage hinges in part on the acting conventions of the time.  He has studied the affected mannerisms demanded of the women characters on stage and if you would fault Kynaston's portrayal as Desdemona you can level the same charges against the Othello being played by Betterton (Tom Wilkinson).  This is simply what acting was during the Stuart Restoration.  Pointedly, a pair of women with aspirations towards acting on the stage doom Kynaston's career, one being his dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), who has memorized each inflection and gesture of his Desdemona and performed it in a tavern (which is technically not a theater).  The other is Nell Gwynn (Zoe Tapper), the king's mistress, who has more than the king's ear when it comes to persuading him to change the way things are in the theaters of London.There is, as you would suspect, some sexual tension between Maria and Kynaston, although it is more ardent on her part for most of the story.  She loves him, but he loves acting.  His argument against women playing women is that there is no ""trick"" to it.  I was going to say that he means no skill to such performances, but he really does mean trick.  Kyanston has studied his craft and literally suffered as his training stripped him of every aspect of acting masculine.  He has the trick of creating the illusion of a perfect woman (for example, the five positions of feminine subjugation), without the skill of acting the part, and he is offended by the very idea that being born a woman would give Maria or any other woman any advantage in doing so.  It is only when Maria and Kynaston discuss the tricks of being a woman versus being a man, after his life has been taken away from him, that he not only sees her as a woman but begins to see himself as a man.  For her the key is her admission that she has never been able to do his Desdemona, not because it is mimicry, but because she disagrees vehemently with his premise that the character would not fight back when Othello murders her in her bed chamber.This all sets up the grand finale and for me the last act of ""Stage Beauty"" when we get to the rehearsal and performance of the play is totally captivating.  In one of the DVD features director Richard Eyre (""Iris"") describes what we are seeing as the birth of naturalistic acting, which is exactly why I was so absorbed and why I know that those who have acted or directed actors, will respond to those scenes and this movie in different ways from those whose vantage point has always been as members of the audience.  Danes shows flashes of brilliance which we have not seen from her since her death scene in ""Little Women.""  But Crudup gets special mention here, not only because his role is the pivotal one in the story and because he gets to play both Desdemona and Othello, but because his character is put through the wringer and has to evince two different styles of acting.",5,"""Saturday, Othello...the other one...""",1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,5152,"['Comparisons', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'Shakespeare', 'Love',

878858,AN94YI3URSAII,B00079HZUM,Lostgirl,"[10, 11]","Comparisons between Stage Beauty and Shakespeare in Love are inevitablle. Though Stage Beauty is set about a generation after Shakespeare, both are love stories that deal with the conceit of a man playing a a woman onstage. However, Shakespeare In Love's high profile overshadowed Stage Beauty and more's the pity because Stage Beauty is the better film.Ned Kynistan (Billy Crudup) has made his career playing women's roles and is considered by meany to be the most beautiful woman on the London stage. offstage however, Ned is deeply confused about his sexuality having been taught and trained from childhood to surpress anything masculine in him. His dressing girl Maria (Claire Danes) watches him from the wings each night mouthing his lines and stealing off to a pub where she illegally performs female roles to crowds interested in the novelty. When the king (Rupert Everett) proclaims that women's roles are to be played by women Ned is suddenly out of a job and Maria takes his place as the toast of the theater world.All Ned knows is how to mimic a woman. All Maria knows of acting she learned from Ned. Therefore we see her mimic his exaggerated gestures- but coming from a woman they seem false and artificial. Maria comes to fear that she is not an actress but a novelty. Meanwhile Ned is unable to play men, having worked his whole life at being feminine. It takes a few intervening parties including the king and his mistress Nell Gwynn to show Ned and Maria that they are the ones to help each other. We see Ned and Maria stumble into a romance born on the ground of initial fondness and combined with jealousy and resentment. When they perform the death scene from Othello, all of these come into play with the actors as well as the chatacters they play. When Ned attacks Maria for attempting to do something that he'd spent his whole life training to do, she freely admits that she had no teacher but she had less need of practice- she is able to understand what it is to be a woman based on experience, not soley on observation: something that will be her greatest asset as an actress. She also asserts that Ned's formal training left him trapped in a man's body that he has no idea how to inhabit. Every word is true and Ned must struggle to form an identity regardless of whether it is masculine or feminine. He needs to learn to be a person separate from the roles he plays.All of the performances are good but Crudup and Danes stand out in their roles. Crudup is given a difficult task: to portray a man, raised as a woman and then rejected as one. He's left as a man, which he doesn't know how to be. His walk is affected with a swing in his hips, his voice approaches a falsetto even when he's not in character. Danes has proven herself to be a highly skilled and innately gifted actors many times. She proved adept at Shakespeare's language in Romeo + Juliet, so it's all the more amusing to watch Maria stumble through Shakespeare's lines and put on artificial airs. At the same time she's legitimately in pain; acting is her passion but she struggles with the knowledge that she's terrible at it.  Both Danes and Crudup have to play actors- in other words they must play Ned and Maria playing Othello and Desemona. It's a rough thing to do but they pull it off on all levels.Based on a stage play the dialogue is witty, and Richard Eyre's direction is more than able. The costumes and the scenery are lovely, but unlike in many period films they are not the show. That belongs to the actors, the dialogue and the story.",5,Underrated Gem,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,3545,"['Comparisons', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'are', 'inevitablle', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'set', 'generation', 'Shakespeare', 'are', 'love', 'stories', 'deal', 'conceit', 'man', 'playing', 'woman', 'onstage', 'However', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'high', 'profile', 'overshadowed', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'more', 'pity', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'better', 'film.Ned', 'Kynistan', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'women', 'roles', 'considered', 'meany', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'London', 'stage', 'offstage', 'however', 'Ned', 'deeply', 'confused', 'sexuality', 'having', 'been', 'taught', 'trained', 'childhood', 'surpress', 'anything', 'masculine', 'dressing', 'girl', 'Maria', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'wings', 'night', 'mouthing', 'lines', 'stealing', 'off', 'pub', 'where', 'illegally', 'female', 'roles', 'crowds', 'interested', 'novelty', 'When', 'king', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'women', 'roles', 'are', 'be', 'played', 'women', 'Ned', 'suddenly', 'job', 'Maria', 'place', 'toast', 'theater', 'world.All', 'Ned', 'how', 'mimic', 'woman', 'Maria', 'knows', 'acting', 'learned', 'Ned', 'see', 'mimic', 'exaggerated', 'gestures-', 'coming', 'woman', 'seem', 'false', 'artificial', 'Maria', 'fear', 'not', 'actress', 'novelty', 'Meanwhile', 'Ned', 'unable', 'play', 'men', 'having', 'worked', 'whole', 'life', 'being', 'feminine', 'few', 'intervening', 'parties', 'including', 'king', 'mistress', 'Nell', 'Gwynn', 'show', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'are', 'ones', 'help', 'other', 'see', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'stumble', 'romance', 'born', 'ground', 'initial', 'fondness', 'combined', 'jealousy', 'resentment', 'When', 'perform', 'death', 'scene', 'Othello', 'come', 'play', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'chatacters', 'play', 'When', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'attempting', 'do', 'something', ""'d"", 'spent', 'whole', 'life', 'training', 'do', 'freely', 'had', 'teacher', 'had', 'less', 'need', 'practice-', 'able', 'understand', 'what', 'be', 'woman', 'based', 'experience', 'not', 'soley', 'observation', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'greatest', 'asset', 'actress', 'also', 'Ned', 'formal', 'training', 'left', 'trapped', 'man', 'body', 'idea', 'how', 'inhabit', 'word', 'true', 'Ned', 'must', 'struggle', 'form', 'identity', 'regardless', 'masculine', 'feminine', 'learn', 'be', 'person', 'separate', 'roles', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Crudup', 'Danes', 'stand', 'out', 'roles', 'Crudup', 'given', 'difficult', 'task', 'portray', 'man', 'raised', 'woman', 'then', 'rejected', 'one', 'left', 'man', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'be', 'walk', 'affected', 'swing', 'hips', 'voice', 'falsetto', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'character', 'Danes', 'proven', 'be', 'highly', 'skilled', 'innately', 'gifted', 'actors', 'many', 'times', 'proved', 'adept', 'Shakespeare', 'language', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'more', 'amusing', 'watch', 'Maria', 'stumble', 'Shakespeare', 'lines', 'put', 'artificial', 'airs', 'same', 'time', 'legitimately', 'pain', 'acting', 'passion', 'knowledge', 'terrible', 'Danes', 'Crudup', 'have', 'play', 'actors-', 'other', 'words', 'must', 'play', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'playing', 'Othello', 'Desemona', 'rough', 'thing', 'do', 'pull', 'off', 'levels.Based', 'stage', 'play', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'direction', 'more', 'able', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'are', 'lovely', 'many', 'period', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'show', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'story']",Stage Beauty

878861,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00079HZUM,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 5]","""Stage Beauty"" suffered unfairly from having been released in the wake of ""Shakespeare in Love."" The earlier film had already won the Best Picture Oscar, and suffered a critical and public backlash because it beat out the more deeply admired ""Saving Private Ryan."" So no one was in the mood for another gender-bending romantic comedy set in the theater world of Merrie Olde England. ""Stage Beauty"" even shared some cast members in common with ""Shakespeare in Love"" (Tom Wilkinson, Rupert Everett) and lacked the imprimatur of a screenplay co-written by Tom Stoppard. All this is background for saying that ""Stage Beauty"" was unfairly ignored on its first release, because it's every bit as elegant, funny and engrossing as ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and more poignant and profound in the bargain. Director Richard Eyre and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher create a magical fiction based on the true-life story of Edward Kynaston, an actor celebrated for playing female leads on the Restoration stage, who suddenly found himself out of a job when King Charles II decreed that women, not men, should play women's roles. History tells us that Kynaston soon switched to men's roles and regained his stardom; ""Stage Beauty"" contrives to tell us how he accomplished this, and the difficulties he met along the way. As played by Billy Crudup, Kynaston is insufferably arrogant--particularly toward women, whom he feels he knows far better than they do themselves--but his arrogance hides a deeper insecurity about his identity, sexual and otherwise, and his place in the world. Of course the King's decree shatters his world, and it's up to Maria (Claire Danes)--his once-mocked dresser, now a major star--to help him find his way back. Besides having many witty and thoughtful things to say about gender roles in theater and society, ""Stage Beauty"" presents a believable scenario for the beginnings of naturalistic acting on the stage--once men and women were free to portray themselves, there was far less need for posturing. The ensemble cast of ""Stage Beauty"" is at least as good as that of ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and the leads are better. I had never paid much attention to Billy Crudup before this film; after seeing it, I'd have to say he's one of the most underrated actors around, superbly skilled in voice and gesture, and capable of profound depths of feeling as well as witty banter. He's matched fully by Claire Danes, a radiantly beautiful actress of fire and delicacy. Rupert Everett--a master at playing fatuous, self-involved noblemen--is a stitch as Charles II, and Tom Wilkinson is his usual excellent self as Kynaston and Maria's boss in their acting company. Such admirable emissaries from British rep as Edward Fox, Ben Chaplin, Richard Griffiths and Fenella Woolgar also shine in smaller roles. ""Stage Beauty"" takes considerable liberties with history--for example, Nell Gwyn, a major character in the story, would have been only about 10 years old at the time ""Stage Beauty"" took place. But that shouldn't matter to anyone who enjoys a romantic historical romp, particularly when it's as masterfully done as ""Stage Beauty.""",5,"Better than ""Shakespeare in Love.""",1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,3132,"['Stage', 'Beauty', 'suffered', 'unfairly', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'wake', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'earlier', 'film', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'suffered', 'critical', 'public', 'backlash', 'beat', 'out', 'more', 'deeply', 'admired', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'one', 'was', 'mood', 'gender-bending', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'theater', 'world', 'Merrie', 'Olde', 'England', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'even', 'shared', 'cast', 'members', 'common', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'lacked', 'imprimatur', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'background', 'saying', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'was', 'unfairly', 'ignored', 'first', 'release', 'bit', 'elegant', 'funny', 'engrossing', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'more', 'poignant', 'profound', 'bargain', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'screenwriter', 'Jeffrey', 'Hatcher', 'create', 'magical', 'fiction', 'based', 'true-life', 'story', 'Edward', 'Kynaston', 'actor', 'celebrated', 'playing', 'female', 'leads', 'Restoration', 'stage', 'who', 'suddenly', 'found', 'job', 'when', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'decreed', 'women', 'not', 'men', 'should', 'play', 'women', 'roles', 'History', 'Kynaston', 'soon', 'switched', 'men', 'roles', 'regained', 'stardom', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'contrives', 'tell', 'how', 'accomplished', 'difficulties', 'met', 'way', 'played', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Kynaston', 'insufferably', 'arrogant', 'particularly', 'women', 'whom', 'far', 'better', 'do', 'arrogance', 'deeper', 'insecurity', 'identity', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'place', 'world', 'course', 'King', 'decree', 'shatters', 'world', 'up', 'Maria', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'once-mocked', 'dresser', 'now', 'major', 'star', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'having', 'many', 'witty', 'thoughtful', 'things', 'say', 'gender', 'roles', 'theater', 'society', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'believable', 'scenario', 'beginnings', 'naturalistic', 'acting', 'stage', 'once', 'men', 'women', 'were', 'free', 'portray', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'need', 'posturing', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'leads', 'are', 'better', 'had', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'film', 'seeing', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'superbly', 'skilled', 'voice', 'gesture', 'capable', 'profound', 'depths', 'feeling', 'as', 'well', 'witty', 'banter', 'matched', 'fully', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'radiantly', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'fire', 'delicacy', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'master', 'playing', 'fatuous', 'self-involved', 'noblemen', 'stitch', 'Charles', 'II', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'usual', 'excellent', 'self', 'Kynaston', 'Maria', 'boss', 'acting', 'company', 'Such', 'admirable', 'emissaries', 'British', 'rep', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Fenella', 'Woolgar', 'also', 'shine', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'considerable', 'liberties', 'history', 'example', 'Nell', 'Gwyn', 'major', 'character', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'only', '10', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'took', 'place', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyone', 'who', 'romantic', 'historical', 'romp', 'particularly', 'when', 'masterfully', 'done', 'Stage', 'Beauty']",Stage Beauty

878864,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B00079HZUM,Reviews No More,"[3, 4]","Though Stage Beauty is based on the same general theme of women portraying themselves being taboo as Shakespeare in Love, I found the latter film to be a bit slow and less engrossing than this one.  Stage Beauty has so much going on that it's impossible to tear yourself away from the screen for a moment, thus the joys of owning it on video are quite apparent.I love Billy Crudup, not only as eye candy, but because he can actually act.  His versatility has long amazed me in so many movies, but in this one he shows several different sides as stage actor Ned Kynaston who has built a career out of playing women since his childhood.  He is the reigning star of the theater as he plays Desdemona in Othello and is considered the greatest female actor by his peers.  His dresser Maria (played above and beyond even my expectations by Claire Danes) is silently in love with him and copies his every gesture and movement backstage each night before running off to mimick his role at an underground theater as well.Upon discovering that Ned is so feminine from his theatrical training that she catches him having a tryst with the Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin), she is determined to steal his thunder and his role upon King Charles II's (Rupert Everett) repeal of the longstanding law forbidding women from portraying themselves at the insistence of his coercive cockney accented mistress Nell Gwynn (Zoe Tapper) who also wants to act.  This puts the beautifl Ned and several other male actors who played women out of business, and Maria Hughes quickly becomes the talk of the theatrical community as she takes over Ned's role as Desdemona.  Things go from bad to worse as Ned cannot find work, especially after a beating from the ruthless, lecherous Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths) who makes Ned pay for a bawdy trick he'd played on him, and he ends up working in cheap taverns.The silver lining is that Maria can't act as well as she thought, and she needs Ned to help her master the role as Desdemona as much as he needs to learn how to come to terms with his own arrogance and masculinity.  Wonderful things happen for both of them, but I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.  There is so much going on in this movie that you will literally be glued to your seat.  The characters and script are as colorful and beautiful as the scenery and the costumes.  Save for a bad love scene in a barn--Crudup and Danes don't convey much chemistry--and the way in which Ned is busy deciding if he prefers men or women, Stage Beauty is a sheerly entertaining joy to behold.  Billy Crudup was once expected to be the next Brad Pitt, but it's rather fortunate for him that he's not; the critics still take him seriously and, with a brave role such as this on his resume', that factor is completely to his advantage.  After all, this is most decidedly his film.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, and you get the sense that everyone involved enjoyed this project.

What hope is she to have save as a dresser and mender of Ned's fine gowns?

and so we meet the consumate desdemonia of the time-- portrayed well by crudup-- the acting style was a bit stilted-- in those days---- much as acting was in our own early silent movies--- things were ` acted out ` emotions etc a bit exagerated--- during the course of the movie- the king ever in search of new sensations as they were w their outsized and never denyed appetites ! upon hearing of a remote performance of othello played w a woman as desdemona-- and it being quite a success-- he changes the law-- and from there on- only women can play women !! putting a lot of dandy men out of work--esp crudup-- his dresser played so well by clare danes-- is the new actress ! when he finds out he feels really betrayed-- there are fine scenes wherein we see how much clare loves the crudup character-- and acts out his every word and gesture as desdemona offstage-- only to repeat it w great success in a pub---- after the law is changed she becomes desdemona w crudup giving her acting lessons-- this is where the miracle of the movie begins---- they rehearse-- she is desdemona he is othello---he exhorts her to be more real-- the rehearsal is thrilling esp for crudup-- as u see him realize he can play a man-- which he has never done --& she reaches a new level of acting in this brief scene--- crudup goes to the manager who previously played othello-- and insists that he be othello-- crudup-- to her desdemona-- the manager agrees-- what follows is a rare moment in film--- what these actors accomplish in front of the audience who w us sees an actress onstage for their first time--is the birth of a new level of reality portrayed onstage- the final scene between othello and desdemona-- wherein he kills her----- appears so real -- we and the audience in the movie actually think he may have killed her for real--  it`s so convincing it takes yer breath away-- as it does the audience in the movie---- the audience knows they have witnessed not only a first in seeing an actress ! but shakespeare performed more realistically than ever before-- as opposed to the earlier more stilted version w the men--and it is so that a fine movie ends with quite a payoff ! it is said that when brando first appeared on broadway audiences were similarly treated to something never seen before-- real emotions done so convincingly yet still theatrically ! its like a mass epiphany and a delight- unheard of before! it is what happens every now and then in the theatre or any of the arts----- something so new so vital it touches a chord never before touched in us---- our very souls are revealed to us in newer and greater measure than ever before--- and this is why this movie truly transcends itself-- for recording this---for revealing it--- in this setting -- 17th century bawdy old england-- inventing a theatre that to this day continues every now and then to amaze and delight and re invent itself ! the extras on the dvd are excellent too--- the directors comments are an added treat as we learn much more about this totally worthy and successful endeavor---- & compared to most of the crap that comes out of hollywood-- this should get 10 stars !

878869,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00079HZUM,Robert Morris,"[29, 33]","I saw this film the evening after seeing Being Julia and thoroughly enjoyed both. Much of Stage Beauty is based on historical material which Helen Wilcox examines in Women in Literature in Britain, 1500-1700. Jeffrey Hatcher's screenplay is based on his own Compleat Female Stage Beauty, a play first performed in 1999. We know that Edward (Ned) Kynaston (1640-1706) was among the last and reputedly the best of the male actors of female parts in dramas performed prior to the Restoration period. Following his coronation, King Charles II decreed that females would be permitted to appear on stage in roles previously performed only by males. For many male actors, the subsequent transition was very, very difficult. There are certain parallels with the difficulties that stars such as John Gilbert had during the transition from silent films to ""the talkies.""What we have in Stage Beauty is a delightful presentation of that age and, more specifically, of Kynaston's struggles (brilliantly presented by Billy Crudup) to salvage his career in juxtaposition with those of his dresser Maria (Claire Danes), an unskilled but aspiring actress, who seeks Ned's tutelage to advance her own career. Frankly, I did not immediately recognize the always-superb Rupert Everett in the role of Charles II. Others in the supporting cast include Ben Chaplin (as George Villars, Duke of Buckingham) and Tom Wilkinson (as Thomas Betterton). Historically, Betterton was once highly praised for his performance in Shakespeare's Othello...in the role of Ophelia. In Stage Beauty, Kynaston plays Ophelia to Betterton's Moor of Venice. After Kynaston rejects the advances of the lecherous Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths), Sedley hires thugs to beat Kynaston so severely that he can no longer perform until his wounds have healed. Maria sees an opportunity, organizes what I guess could be called an ""underground"" performance of the play, and assumes the role of Ophelia herself. After seeing her performance, Charles II issues his proclamation and then....Credit director Richard Eyre with obtaining superior results from his talented cast and crew. Simulating London in the 1660's was indeed a major task, achieved brilliantly by cinematographer Andrew Dunn, production designer Jim Play, and art directors Keith Slote and Jan Spoczynski. Of course, many of the comic devices in both Hatcher's play and in this film can be traced back to classical Greek and Roman comedies, with the female roles in all of which performed by males. For example, all manner of mischief is achieved through mistaken identity, role and gender reversals, double entrendres, elaborate disguises, no sequitors, etc. The highly literate screenplay invests the nimble narrative with style and grace as Ned and Maria proceed to the inevitable, indeed obligatory resolution. Great fun! Those who share my high regard for this film are urged to check out Victor/Victoria and Tootsie (in 1982) as well as Shakespeare in Love (1998).",5,The Aesthetics of Deception,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,2989,"['saw', 'film', 'evening', 'seeing', 'Being', 'Julia', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Much', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'based', 'historical', 'material', 'Helen', 'Wilcox', 'examines', 'Women', 'Literature', 'Britain', '1500-1700', 'Jeffrey', 'Hatcher', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'Compleat', 'Female', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'play', 'first', 'performed', '1999', 'know', 'Edward', 'Ned', 'Kynaston', '1640-1706', 'was', 'last', 'reputedly', 'best', 'male', 'actors', 'female', 'parts', 'dramas', 'performed', 'prior', 'Restoration', 'period', 'Following', 'coronation', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'decreed', 'females', 'would', 'be', 'permitted', 'appear', 'stage', 'roles', 'previously', 'performed', 'only', 'males', 'many', 'male', 'actors', 'subsequent', 'transition', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'difficult', 'are', 'certain', 'parallels', 'difficulties', 'stars', 'such', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'had', 'transition', 'silent', 'films', 'talkies', 'What', 'have', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'delightful', 'presentation', 'age', 'more', 'specifically', 'Kynaston', 'struggles', 'brilliantly', 'presented', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'salvage', 'career', 'juxtaposition', 'dresser', 'Maria', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'unskilled', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'Ned', 'tutelage', 'advance', 'own', 'career', 'Frankly', 'did', 'not', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'always-superb', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'role', 'Charles', 'II', 'Others', 'supporting', 'cast', 'include', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'George', 'Villars', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Thomas', 'Betterton', 'Historically', 'Betterton', 'was', 'once', 'highly', 'praised', 'performance', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'role', 'Ophelia', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'Kynaston', 'Ophelia', 'Betterton', 'Moor', 'Venice', 'Kynaston', 'advances', 'lecherous', 'Sir', 'Charles', 'Sedley', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Sedley', 'thugs', 'beat', 'Kynaston', 'so', 'severely', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'perform', 'wounds', 'have', 'healed', 'Maria', 'opportunity', 'what', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'underground', 'performance', 'play', 'role', 'Ophelia', 'seeing', 'performance', 'Charles', 'II', 'issues', 'proclamation', 'then', '.Credit', 'director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'obtaining', 'superior', 'results', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', 'Simulating', 'London', '1660', 'was', 'indeed', 'major', 'task', 'achieved', 'brilliantly', 'cinematographer', 'Andrew', 'Dunn', 'production', 'designer', 'Jim', 'Play', 'art', 'directors', 'Keith', 'Slote', 'Jan', 'Spoczynski', 'course', 'many', 'comic', 'devices', 'Hatcher', 'play', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'classical', 'Greek', 'Roman', 'comedies', 'female', 'roles', 'performed', 'males', 'example', 'manner', 'mischief', 'achieved', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'role', 'gender', 'reversals', 'double', 'entrendres', 'elaborate', 'disguises', 'sequitors', 'etc', 'highly', 'literate', 'screenplay', 'nimble', 'narrative', 'style', 'grace', 'Ned', 'Maria', 'proceed', 'inevitable', 'indeed', 'obligatory', 'resolution', 'Great', 'fun', 'who', 'share', 'high', 'regard', 'film', 'are', 'urged', 'check', 'out', 'Victor/Victoria', 'Tootsie', '1982', 'as', 'well', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', '1998']",Stage Beauty

She is only adequate, but fortunately does not have to carry the show herself.  She is surrounded and overshadowed by a supporting ensemble of talented and skilled actors.  Rupert Everett, Tom Wilkinson and Hugh Bonneville are among those who stand out. Zoe Tapper shines in a brief role as Nell Gwynn, one of King Charles' mistresses, though her presence as a character is a historical anachronism.  The direction was superb as well.This movie is well mounted, takes full advantage of some historic sites in England and creates what is otherwise necessary to complete a picture of its time and place in history.  The playwright Jeffrey Hatcher adapts his own play for the screen ... clearly he knows what he's doing.  There are few scenes that are not full of words, and the dialog requires close attention on the part of the viewer.  Hatcher's adaptation is not fully historically accurate, but close enough. The musical score by George Fenton is worth noting ... as always, his work enhances but does not dominate. (I particularly recall his previous scores for ""Memphis Belle"" and ""Dangerous Liaisons."")The plot contains a number of ambiguities, not only of the sexual uncertainty of Ned Kynaston but of the actor as person and the person as actor. As usual, in English period pieces the politics of the day are always, if not in the foreground, certainly in the background.A film to purchase and see more than once to savor not only its overall impression but for those who love words to appreciate more fully the elegance of the playwright / script writer.I initially did not give the film a five-star rating primarily because of Danes' performance, but Crudup and the rest of the cast made me rethink my decision.

It follows the entangled paths of the last great female actor Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) and the first female actress Maria (Claire Danes), at the historical moment when King Charles II (Rupert Everett) decrees that women be allowed (then required) to play the female roles. Add sexual politics, some gender-weaving, and clever dialog. The film starts off abit slowly for my tastes, and Maria getting cold feet to play a role she's done before seemed more ""convenient"" than believable, just to intro the means of a story climax. So, the story has a few (but very few)weak spots. While the acting does not!! It is beyond flawless... not just the leads, but it is consistently well acted by EVERY actor/actress in the entire cast. It has Oscar nominations for acting written all over it. Directing, Set Design, Make Up, etc...all impressively done. I do not like period dramas, and was expecting to write a witty negative review. Instead, I'm recommending it to friends, and expecting to watch it more than once. While this does not have the same comedic infusements of ""Shakespeare In Love"", it is very hard not to think of them as kindred.

Well, what happens when sexual orientation is messed with to such a degree, that a person really has no idea who or what he/she is? That is the premise of this interesting and generally historically accurate film. The acting by all the players is uniformly great, the story is very interesting, and the conclusion by the skillful actor Billy Crudup, is that he has little idea of who he is, sexually or otherwise.Actors that are truly great are able to inhabit a role to such a degree that they become the person they portray. What I have often wondered is if the role that they played lingers in their life outside of their portrayal, and informs them of another aspect of their personhood that they were not previously knowledgeable of before their role, in the film, play etc. And does it happen that they are unable sometimes to let go of the role they were playing in real life?There is lots of humor in this film, great costumes,and from what I understand from the time period that the movie portrays, the language is actually the way people talked at the time. Lost of swearing and bawdy language. It is interesting that Billy Crudup and Claire Danes, who plays his sort of quasi love interest in the film, were indeed and item in real life during the filming of the movie.

878876,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00079HZUM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 2]","London, 1660. The most popular form of entertainment is the theater. Shakespeare's plays are playing at a number of different venues, some respectable, some less so. Due to Royal decree, all female roles are played by men. Of these men, Kynaston (Billy Crudup), is widely regarded to be a star, having made the role of Desdemona, in ""Othello"", his own. Kynaston's dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), watches his performance from the wings every night, mimicking his every affected move, wishing the accolades were for her as well. Maria sneaks off to a makeshift theater most evenings to perform in a more rudimentary performance of ""Lear"". News of this soon reaches King Charles II (Rupert Everett). At the urging of his new mistress, Nell (Zoe Tapper), he soon decrees that female roles should only be played by females. Kynaston is unsure what he can do, now that he is no longer allowed to practice the craft he has so long perfected.""Stage Beauty"", directed by Richard Eyre (""Iris"", one of my least favorite film biographies of all time), is a well-produced film with engaging performances.The film revolves around the two central characters. It is the story of their relationship, their craft, and their troubles. The film is only as good as their performances. And they are quite good. But there is a flaw in each, which detracts from the film.As Kynaston, Billy Crudup credibly creates a character that is very believable. He is a man who has made a career of playing female roles. He even takes to dressing as a woman when he goes out on the town, to the delight of his admirers, because he feels it is important to maintain the charade. He practices hand movements, inflections, walking, all to simulate the female form. He has perfected the art of dying as a female. All of these `technical' aspects of the role are easily handled by Crudup, one of the best actors working today. He also seems to easily don wig, makeup and dress, to become a woman. When the King opens up the theater to women, therefore robbing him of his roles, we feel Kynaston's loss and shock.There is a scene early in the film in which two female admirers rush backstage to meet Kynaston. Ogling him, they eventually get him to agree to a ride in their carriage. This scene is a bit funny, but it is also unfortunate, because it serves to highlight all of the ways in which Crudup's character doesn't resemble a woman. Sitting next to the two women, we see that he wears too much makeup, his face is far too angular, and he doesn't resemble a woman. How did he fool these other women? In order for something like this to work, we have to feel that he could fool his adoring public. If he can't fool us for even a second, how can he fool them for years and years? Yes, they may have been less knowledgeable about these things in the 1660s, but I find it difficult to believe they would buy Crudup as a woman. He looks like a tarted-up whore.Claire Danes plays Maria. She is very devoted to her job, but also longs for something more. She wants to act, not for the stardom, necessarily, but for the challenge. After helping Kynaston change clothes, she rushes to a makeshift theater to perform, as Desdemona, in a more rudimentary version of ""Othello"". Much to her surprise, word of her performance begins to travel, causing everyone to rethink the rules. During the course of the story, Maria shifts from a confidant, willing to sneak in a performance here and there, to a woman interested in becoming the star. The shift is not a gradual one and it is a bit jarring. A more natural, longer transition would have aided the role and the film considerably.Smoother transitions in both of the main characters would have added to the film immeasurably. I almost got the sense that the film was trimmed, perhaps due to budget restrictions. The film is a bit short for a period drama. I think it runs about 100 minutes. It was also produced independently, so perhaps this theory is plausible. If these two problems had been worked out, the film could easily qualify as a great film. Most people watching this film won't be bothered by this.The supporting cast is also very good. Of the group, Tom Wilkinson, as Betterton, the owner of Kynaston's theater, is the least memorable. Rupert Everett clearly has a grand old time playing Charles II. Lounging in bed with a dozen yapping dogs, dressed as a woman for a play with his mistress, who is dressed as a man, and more, Everett clearly relishes playing Royalty for the fool. It is a funny and amusing performance. Richard Griffiths is also very good as a pompous, bored member of the upper class. As Sir Charles Sedley, he walks around trying to create amusement for himself. Ben Chaplin plays George Villars, the Duke of Buckingham, Kynaston's closeted lover. He and Crudup are quite good verbally sparring with one another in public.""Beauty"" is a beauty to look at. The stage, backstage areas, the Royal palace, a country estate. Everything looks authentic, adding greatly to the quality of the film.""Stage Beauty"" is a very good film. If a little more attention had been paid to the main characters, it would have been a great film.

His secret boyfriend(Ben Chaplin) dumps him and gets married to a woman, because he was only attracted to crudup in drag. Crudup had no idea that Danes had been secretly in love with him despite the fact that she took over his role in the play. From that point on he had to climb back up to reclaim his status as an actor if not actress. During the process of coaching Danes to play the role that he gave up, he rediscovered his true identity and the meaning of being an actor, as well the love and passion for Danes.Billy Crudup's performance was mesmerizing, especially his drag scenes, but I found that his body was a bit too muscular when he was topless. His portrayal of confused sexual and romantic pursuit was  very impressive to the level of the late Leslie Cheung's performance in Farewell My Concubine. Claire Danes had a great deal of chemistry with Crudup, and it was wonderful to watch her love scenes with Crudup, because it was quite funny and beautiful.",4,"Billy  is Almost Beautiful, and Claire Becomes a Woman.",1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,2034,"['Billy', 'Crudup', 'doubt', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'yet', 'underrated', 'underused', 'Hollywood', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'ultimately', 'Crudup', 'deliver', 'better', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'performance', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'shed', 'off', 'girly', 'image', 'role', 'more', 'challenging', 'work', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'Compare', 'theater-themed', 'movie', 'Being', 'Julia', 'not', 'funny', 'captivating', 'certainly', 'sexier', 'more', 'romantic', 'plot', 'revolves', 'unintensional', 'relaionship', 'drag', 'actor', 'diva', 'Crudup', 'dresser', 'Danes', 'who', 'secretly', 'wanted', 'become', 'actress.At', 'top', 'divadom', 'Crudup', 'was', 'announced', 'King', 'Charles/played', 'unrecognizable', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'bad', 'hair', 'makeup', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'allowed', 'play', 'female', 'roles', 'women', 'are', 'allowed', 'become', 'actresses', 'first', 'time', 'Danes', 'replacement', 'female', 'lead', 'Othello', 'Crudup', 'was', 'ostracised', 'when', 'refused', 'play', 'male', 'parts', 'Meanwhile', 'career', 'love', 'life', 'started', 'fall', 'apart', 'secret', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'married', 'woman', 'was', 'only', 'attracted', 'crudup', 'drag', 'Crudup', 'had', 'idea', 'Danes', 'had', 'been', 'secretly', 'love', 'fact', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'play', 'point', 'had', 'climb', 'back', 'reclaim', 'status', 'actor', 'not', 'actress', 'process', 'coaching', 'Danes', 'play', 'role', 'gave', 'up', 'rediscovered', 'true', 'identity', 'meaning', 'being', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'passion', 'Danes.Billy', 'Crudup', 'performance', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'especially', 'drag', 'scenes', 'found', 'body', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'muscular', 'when', 'was', 'topless', 'portrayal', 'confused', 'sexual', 'romantic', 'pursuit', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'level', 'late', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'performance', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'chemistry', 'Crudup', 'was', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'love', 'scenes', 'Crudup', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'beautiful']",Stage Beauty
