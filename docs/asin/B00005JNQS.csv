633999,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNQS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Robots' didn't impress me as much as I was expecting, but on the other hand it truly is an entertaining family adventure, so it has it's plusses to accompany the minuses.  It's really nothing new, as in the storyline is nothing short of generic.  We've seen this done a million times, and quite frankly we've seen it done better, but for what it's worth `Robots' offers some great humor and an interesting backdrop for it's formulistic storyline.  The world that is created for these robots is truly mind blowing and very well thought out.  Everything from the cities themselves to the concept of child birth and child rearing is incredibly ingenious and makes for interesting topic of conversation upon the closing credits.  While some of the humor may be directed at the adult audience, it's nothing that parents would ultimately find offensive and will most likely go right over the child's head (although your children may start asking about where babies come from).The story is sweet, although, as I mentioned, very generic.  It's the same good guy wants to be something great and is stilted by the power hungry bad guy who he in the end overthrows.  We've seen this same scenario for almost every cartoon, and it surprises me that this was what they came up with on the story boards.  They had so many endless possibilities with the backdrop they had here and instead of exploring their depths and coming up with something as unique and ingenious as their robot world they stuck with the same ol' same that has grown tired.  Rodney, a young robot in a poor but loving household, dreams of one day being an inventor in the lines of Big Weld, the greatest robot in the world.  He leaves home and travels to Robot City in pursuit of his dream only to discover that Big Weld has been replaced by the money hungry Ratchet whose diabolical plans could mean the end of robots like Rodney and his family.  So, with the help of some dim-witted robots he plans his attack against Ratchet and his evil robot hordes.The animation is brilliantly done, the world a fantastic character in itself.  The voice actors are all well cast, all except maybe one.  We all know that Robin Williams is a voice over God and should be enlisted as the comical sidekick in every cartoon ever.  He doesn't disappoint here and his character Fender delivers most of the films funniest scenes.  Jennifer Coolidge is another bonus, for her voice work on Aunt Fanny is hysterical.  Greg Kinnear was a brilliant choice to play the evil Ratchet, his voice fits it brilliantly.  The not so brilliant choice falls in the line of Halle Berry, who just comes off kind of awkward.  Ewan McGregor works fine, as does Mel Brooks and the adorable Amanda Bynes whose voice just seems suited perfectly for animated work.  Here's to hoping she does another cartoon soon.So, in the end `Robots' is a worthwhile addition to your animated collection, and is one I most likely will buy for my daughter.  It's not one that I would readily call a masterpiece (ala `The Incredibles') but it's definitely not boring or passable.  Thanks to the brilliant work on the part of comedic genius Williams, there is much to laugh at here, and visually it's impressive.  It's sure to captivate the minds of your young ones, and thankfully it's not silly and ridiculous, at least not so much so that us parents can't tolerate it.  So, the plusses here (animation, humor and ingenious robot world) far outweigh it's minuses (that generic plot and Halle Berry) and come together to deliver an animated experience for the whole family.",3,"The fantastic robot world delivers more than the simple plot, but its entertaining none-the-less...",1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,3573,"['Robots', 'did', ""n't"", 'impress', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'expecting', 'other', 'hand', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'family', 'adventure', 'plusses', 'accompany', 'minuses', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'short', 'generic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'what', 'worth', 'Robots', 'offers', 'great', 'humor', 'interesting', 'backdrop', 'formulistic', 'storyline', 'world', 'created', 'robots', 'truly', 'mind', 'blowing', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Everything', 'cities', 'concept', 'child', 'birth', 'child', 'rearing', 'incredibly', 'ingenious', 'interesting', 'topic', 'conversation', 'closing', 'credits', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'directed', 'adult', 'audience', 'nothing', 'parents', 'would', 'ultimately', 'find', 'offensive', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'go', 'right', 'child', 'head', 'children', 'may', 'start', 'asking', 'where', 'babies', 'come', '.The', 'story', 'sweet', 'mentioned', 'very', 'generic', 'same', 'good', 'guy', 'be', 'something', 'great', 'stilted', 'power', 'hungry', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'end', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'scenario', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'was', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'story', 'boards', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'endless', 'possibilities', 'backdrop', 'had', 'here', 'instead', 'exploring', 'depths', 'coming', 'up', 'something', 'unique', 'ingenious', 'robot', 'world', 'stuck', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'grown', 'tired', 'Rodney', 'young', 'robot', 'poor', 'loving', 'household', 'dreams', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'inventor', 'lines', 'Big', 'Weld', 'greatest', 'robot', 'world', 'home', 'travels', 'Robot', 'City', 'pursuit', 'dream', 'only', 'discover', 'Big', 'Weld', 'been', 'replaced', 'money', 'hungry', 'Ratchet', 'diabolical', 'plans', 'could', 'mean', 'end', 'robots', 'Rodney', 'family', 'So', 'help', 'dim-witted', 'robots', 'attack', 'Ratchet', 'evil', 'robot', 'hordes.The', 'animation', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'world', 'fantastic', 'character', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'maybe', 'one', 'know', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'voice', 'God', 'should', 'be', 'enlisted', 'comical', 'sidekick', 'cartoon', 'ever', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'character', 'Fender', 'most', 'films', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'bonus', 'voice', 'work', 'Aunt', 'Fanny', 'hysterical', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'was', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'play', 'evil', 'Ratchet', 'voice', 'brilliantly', 'not', 'so', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'falls', 'line', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'just', 'off', 'kind', 'awkward', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fine', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'adorable', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'voice', 'just', 'suited', 'perfectly', 'animated', 'work', 'Here', 'hoping', 'cartoon', 'soon.So', 'end', 'Robots', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'animated', 'collection', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'buy', 'daughter', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'readily', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'ala', 'Incredibles', 'definitely', 'not', 'boring', 'passable', 'Thanks', 'brilliant', 'work', 'part', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Williams', 'much', 'laugh', 'here', 'visually', 'impressive', 'sure', 'captivate', 'minds', 'young', 'ones', 'thankfully', 'not', 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'So', 'plusses', 'here', 'animation', 'humor', 'ingenious', 'robot', 'world', 'far', 'outweigh', 'minuses', 'generic', 'plot', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'come', 'together', 'deliver', 'animated', 'experience', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

And, like trends, this style of animation is starting to get old, already. Though it's possible to do anything with this type of animation (see the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Advent Children) this movie was just the same old. While the story was fun, and the voice-acting excellent, little in this movie is unique.The story itself follows a young Robot named Rodney who has a dream of becoming a great robot inventor. Though he wants to do this for himself, he also wants to make his parents proud at the same time. Problem is, he's a spare-parts kind of robot, and can't get into the place where his dreams can be obtained, and where shiny, new-age robots dwell. He isn't deterred, and goes on a quest to find his mentor who Rodney believes can help him. Along for the ride is a cast of rusty robots, led by Fender, voiced by Robin Williams, definitely the comic relief.The movie has a lot of funny moments in it, and a few stabs at pop-culture, but beyond that nothing in this movie needs to be seen.

If you live in the world of ROBOTS, you literally have to ""make"" a child (building it from a box of parts). When the Copperbottoms find out they're going to be parents, they are so excited that the father runs through the street stuffing cigars into robots' mouths. Once home, and peering into the box of parts, he realizes the task ahead of him: assembling a son. Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is born. We whisk through his childhood and into his teens where we discover his true calling: to become an inventor.Following his dreams, he travels to Robot City to meet his mentor, Mr Bigweld (Mel Brooks), an inventor of all things Robot-like. But upon entering the city and coming to the gates of Mr. Bigweld's offices (ala the gates of Oz), Rodney finds that Mr. Bigweld is nowhere to be found and the company has been taken over by the corrupt Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Secondhand parts are a thing of the past and Ratchet orders all faulty parts melted down. Every Robot must now purchase upgrades. Can't afford them? Sorry, you'll have to be scrapped.Along with a bum-like robot called Fender (Robin Williams ....think THE FISHER KING) and several hundred of his obsolete buddies, Rodney is headed toward trouble ...and maybe success.______________________________________________________________________________Coming off the heals of such phenomenal animated features as SHREK, FINDING NEMO, and ICE AGE, this film falls short but delivers on laughs and fun thanks to the energetic voice of Robin Williams; without him I fear this movie would've flopped entirely. But his action-packed antics made it completely watchable.There have been comments about how slow ROBOTS was to get going, and this is undeniably so. But it was a fairly decent attempt at character and plot set-up.

Unlike the maker of Robots and other recent high-tech CGI films, Pixar starts out with a solid story idea and THEN develops the CGI and the gags to support that idea. Technology has gotten to the point where dazzling effects are easier to do and cheaper than ever and filmmakers are forgetting that audiences ultimately want to see an interesting story, not a dog-and-pony show of the latest in graphics effects with a storyline that has the complexity of a 1930's serial thrown in to hold it all together.So, if you have small children, it might be a worthwhile purchase.

634023,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JNQS,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 5]","There seems to be 2 camps when it comes down to CGI animated films: Pixar, and everyone else. Those everyone elses' include Dreamworks(Shrek, Madagascar, Antz) and Blue Sky(this film, Ice Age). Looking at the last camp, it clearly shows they're still not at the level as Pixar, simply because the latter companies try to hard to be funny and charming. Their films are practically littered with pop culture references and puns. Well Pixar had that Jurassic Park parody in Toy Story 2 or Raiders of the Lost Ark in Toy Story 1 right? True, but at least it had other things as well. Here it's just one gag/pop culture reference after another and it becomes thin.Rodney is a robot who wants to be an inventor, like his hero Bigweld of Bigweld Industries. When he goes to Robot City, he finds that not only does Bigweld Industries not accept inventors anymore, they actually don't even have Bigweld run the place. So Rodney is shut out and meets a ragtag group of robots. And you guessed it, he must make everyone band together to stop the corporation.Now, if it seems like there's a certain ""I've mentioned this kind of plot before"" tone in my voice, well then you guessed right. Having a loner group of heroes band together against more stronger enemies has been done before but it's for the kiddies but if you're a kid, you'll most likely like this movie, if you're an adult, you might.If there's one thing you can count on with animated films is great visuals and of course Robots look great. The images and colors are sharp, robots are really detailed and when they do that rising shot that reveals Robot City you're like ""wow"". And this is true throughout the film as well.Look at the cast list for Pixar films: Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Dave Foley, Richard Kind, Allison Janney and Sarah Vowell. Half of those you can't even figure out where they're from right? We'd actually have to tell you where they're from and you go ""ohhhhh right!"" Well anything non-Pixar is essentially a who's-who of Hollywood talent. Look at this cast list: Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Albert Brooks, Greg Kinnear. Jeez, it's like that Live Aid charity single on film.

He moves to the big city, only to have his dreams crushed when he finds out his idol is no longer in control of his company and Ratchet (Greg Kinear), has taken control. Like many CGI animated movies this film deals with a new and exciting unseen world. The plot is unfortunately not as original or interesting as other computer animated adventures. It is also light on comedy, unlike it's predecessors. 'Robots' is much more childish, but still enjoyable. The characters are given sparse screen time, to the point where we do not get to know or really care about any of them. Other characters just seem boring, such as Rodney's love interest. The animation is hardly ever interesting, something that is becoming more and more difficult. It is a film where one action scene leads to the other, rather than fleshing out characters and relationships. It seems the film is scared of becoming boring itself. Only one scene really stands out and that is the exceptional domino scene, which then escalates into absurdity (which is OK for a family film). All the voice actors are well placed, fitting their characters very well, although as I mentioned before the characters don't really have much to do. Robin Williams isn't used to his full extent, with his ad lib never reaching the hilarious heights of 'Aladdin'. The films consequences are inevitable, you know where the film is headed, which may come as a relief to some younger viewers but it is predictable for the rest of us. Being a huge fan of Tom Waits it was great to hear one of his songs used to such brilliant effect. Compared to Blue Skies earlier animated 'Ice Age' this film seems like a poor sibling. It starts off promising with some very clever and funny set-ups such as the making of the baby.

The animation is superb, with many a subtle whatsit worked into the background, the star-studded voiceovers are excellent (and just because Robin Williams has a relatively small part here doesn't mean he's not funny), there's wild fun and abundant laughs to be found everywhere, and there's an uplifting story with all kinds of morals at the heart of everything.  Robots is a great family film that proves as entertaining to adults as it is to children.This is the story of Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), an idealistic young inventor from a humble robot family who dreams of going to Robot City, meeting famed inventor/robotitarian Bigweld, and helping to make the lives of all robots just a little bit easier.  He doesn't mind the fact that his parents can only give him hand-me-down parts, and he's not ashamed that his father is only a dishwasher in a little restaurant.  When he comes of age, though, he faces the moment when he must decide whether to pursue his dream or adopt a ""never try, never fail"" outlook on life.  He goes to Robot City full of vim and verve - but things aren't the way they're supposed to be there.  He can't even get in the gate, and it turns out that some schmuck named Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) is now running the company in the place of a conspicuously absent Bigweld (Mel Brooks).  Ratchet, in cahoots with his horrible chop shop bot mom, declares war on outmoded bots.  With no parts available for repairs, the older bots will have no choice but to purchase the company's expensive upgrades or fall prey to the sweeper and chop shop oblivion.Rodney makes some interesting friends in the big city, including a run-down crackup named Fender (Robin Williams), the aptly named Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge), and even a Bigweld corporate exec named Cappy (Halle Berry).  He sets himself in opposition to Ratchet when he begins repairing all of the outmoded robots, but he knows he can't stop Ratchet's terrible plans unless he can find Bigweld himself.  It's your classic ""do-gooder underdog takes on the man"" kind of film, and it works really well as such.You can shine no matter what you're made of; that's the message you take away with you from the film.  It doesn't matter where you come from, what you look like, or what you do - you're just as important as anyone else.  With that kind of positive message incorporated into a zany, wonderfully crafted, very funny film (with more celebrity voices than you can shake a spare robotic arm at), I have to repeat myself and say there's absolutely nothing not to like here.",5,"Play that junky music, white bot",1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2620,"['ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'animation', 'superb', 'many', 'subtle', 'whatsit', 'worked', 'background', 'star-studded', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'excellent', 'just', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'relatively', 'small', 'part', 'here', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'funny', 'wild', 'fun', 'abundant', 'laughs', 'be', 'found', 'everywhere', 'uplifting', 'story', 'kinds', 'morals', 'heart', 'everything', 'Robots', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'children.This', 'story', 'Rodney', 'Copperbottom', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'idealistic', 'young', 'inventor', 'humble', 'robot', 'family', 'who', 'going', 'Robot', 'City', 'meeting', 'famed', 'inventor/robotitarian', 'Bigweld', 'helping', 'make', 'lives', 'robots', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'easier', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'parents', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'hand-me-down', 'parts', 'not', 'ashamed', 'father', 'only', 'dishwasher', 'little', 'restaurant', 'When', 'age', 'though', 'moment', 'when', 'must', 'decide', 'pursue', 'dream', 'adopt', 'never', 'try', 'never', 'fail', 'outlook', 'life', 'Robot', 'City', 'full', 'vim', 'verve', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'way', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'gate', 'out', 'schmuck', 'named', 'Ratchet', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'now', 'running', 'company', 'place', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'Bigweld', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Ratchet', 'cahoots', 'horrible', 'chop', 'shop', 'bot', 'mom', 'war', 'outmoded', 'bots', 'parts', 'available', 'repairs', 'older', 'bots', 'will', 'have', 'choice', 'purchase', 'company', 'expensive', 'upgrades', 'fall', 'prey', 'sweeper', 'chop', 'shop', 'oblivion.Rodney', 'interesting', 'friends', 'big', 'city', 'including', 'run-down', 'crackup', 'named', 'Fender', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'aptly', 'named', 'Aunt', 'Fanny', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'even', 'Bigweld', 'corporate', 'exec', 'named', 'Cappy', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'opposition', 'Ratchet', 'when', 'repairing', 'outmoded', 'robots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Ratchet', 'terrible', 'plans', 'can', 'find', 'Bigweld', 'classic', 'do-gooder', 'underdog', 'man', 'kind', 'film', 'really', 'well', 'such.You', 'can', 'shine', 'matter', 'what', ""'re"", 'made', 'message', 'take', 'away', 'film', ""n't"", 'matter', 'where', 'come', 'what', 'look', 'what', 'do', ""'re"", 'just', 'as', 'important', 'anyone', 'else', 'kind', 'positive', 'message', 'incorporated', 'zany', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'more', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'can', 'shake', 'spare', 'robotic', 'arm', 'have', 'repeat', 'say', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'not', 'like', 'here']",N/A

These studio giants have opened the door for other, smaller companies like Blue Sky Studios to release innovative and high-quality movies, such as their first film, ""Ice Age"" in 2002, and their new, more ambitious endeavor, ""Robots.""Visually, ""Robots"" is stunning, both in the look of the world and the creativity of its inner workings. The colors are vivid and the setup is ripe with potential for visual gags. The first half hour of the film is especially entertaining, beginning with Rodney's ""delivery"" as a baby. In the robot world, babies are delivered in boxes and are put together like children's toys at Christmas.The characters, led by an all-star cast of distinctive voices, are fun too, especially Broadbent's deliciously evil Madame Gasket and Williams's high-energy Fender, though I thought Williams could have been given more screen time and more freedom to improvise.The film's only weak spot, if you can call it that, is in its overzealousness to please. At times, there are so many visual elements, action sequences and gags going on at once, it feels as though we have no time to breathe. But, I applaud the creators for their passion for the project. I'd much rather see a studio go too far with its enthusiasm than not far enough. The film's storyline, too, could have been a bit more complex, but kids will love it, and parents will appreciate the complexity of the visual world in exchange for what it might be lacking in story. Overall, this film is a joy to watch, primarily because its cup runneth over with creativity and delight. It's obvious the creators put a lot of time and soul into it, and it paid off-- in spades.It's exciting, too, to see this level of animation coming more frequently to the big screen. Pixar sparked a new interest in animation with its release of ""Toy Story"" in 1995, and has bred an entire generation of animation lovers over the past decade with its subsequent blockbusters. This trend, in turn, has given companies like Blue Sky Studios, Fox, DreamWorks, and others an audience hungry for more of what they have to offer - and they are only too happy to deliver.",5,Just fantastic,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2311,"['Animation', 'hot', 'genre', 'days', 'thanks', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'Pixar', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'blockbusters', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'DreamWorks', 'Shrek', 'studio', 'giants', 'have', 'opened', 'door', 'other', 'smaller', 'companies', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'release', 'innovative', 'high-quality', 'movies', 'such', 'first', 'film', 'Ice', 'Age', '2002', 'new', 'more', 'ambitious', 'endeavor', 'Robots', 'Visually', 'Robots', 'stunning', 'look', 'world', 'creativity', 'inner', 'workings', 'colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'setup', 'ripe', 'potential', 'visual', 'gags', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'Rodney', 'delivery', 'baby', 'robot', 'world', 'babies', 'are', 'delivered', 'boxes', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'children', 'toys', 'Christmas.The', 'characters', 'led', 'all-star', 'cast', 'distinctive', 'voices', 'are', 'fun', 'too', 'especially', 'Broadbent', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'Madame', 'Gasket', 'Williams', 'high-energy', 'Fender', 'thought', 'Williams', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'freedom', 'improvise.The', 'film', 'only', 'weak', 'spot', 'can', 'call', 'overzealousness', 'please', 'times', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'visual', 'elements', 'action', 'sequences', 'gags', 'going', 'once', 'have', 'time', 'breathe', 'applaud', 'creators', 'passion', 'project', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'studio', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'enthusiasm', 'not', 'far', 'enough', 'film', 'storyline', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'parents', 'will', 'appreciate', 'complexity', 'visual', 'world', 'exchange', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'lacking', 'story', 'Overall', 'film', 'joy', 'watch', 'primarily', 'cup', 'runneth', 'creativity', 'delight', 'obvious', 'creators', 'put', 'lot', 'time', 'soul', 'paid', 'off', 'spades.It', 'exciting', 'too', 'see', 'level', 'animation', 'coming', 'more', 'frequently', 'big', 'screen', 'Pixar', 'sparked', 'new', 'interest', 'animation', 'release', 'Toy', 'Story', '1995', 'bred', 'entire', 'generation', 'animation', 'lovers', 'past', 'decade', 'subsequent', 'blockbusters', 'trend', 'turn', 'given', 'companies', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'Fox', 'DreamWorks', 'others', 'audience', 'hungry', 'more', 'what', 'have', 'offer', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'deliver']",N/A

634044,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JNQS,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[1, 2]","For everyone keeping score, there are now three computer animation studios out there:  Pixar, the old favorite; DreamWorks Animation, which is more about pop and fizz than actual storytelling; and Blue Sky Studios, the new kid on the block, having just released its second film, ""Robots"".  Blue Sky appears to place itself somewhere between Pixar and DreamWorks: flashier than Pixar, but more concerned with making a good movie than filling the screen with pop culture references.2002's ""Ice Age"" was a sizable hit for Blue Sky Studios.  While it didn't exactly make Disney and Pixar quake in their corporate shoes, it was a blip on the computer animation radar screen too big to be ignored.  The mix of dramatic storytelling, light humor, and crisp animation made the film a winner at the box office.  Now with money, Blue Sky has invested in better animation and a larger cast in their new movie, ""Robots"".  But a bigger cast is not necessarily a good thing.  Rather than just the four characters that dominated ""Ice Age"", a plethora of complex well-voiced robots star in this picture, which can make it hard to keep up with what everybody is doing at any given time.Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor) lives in a little burg in a world of robotic beings.  Rather than settle for being a dishwasher (literally, a dishwasher) like his father (Stanley Tucci), he decides to make something of himself and work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), a rather large and eccentric inventor who cares about the little guys even though he's a big time money-maker.Immediately upon arriving in Robot City, Rodney crosses paths with Fender (Robin Williams), a neglected and slightly unstable robot who leads a gang of out-of-date misfits just trying to get along in the world.  The problem is Big Weld's company has been corporatized, symbolized by Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), and no longer serves the public, but is only interested in making a profit.  While at first it appears that Ratchet is the evil mastermind, it soon becomes apparent that he is just being used by his own mother (Jim Broadbent) to do her evil bidding.As the protagonist, Rodney obviously must right the wrongs and save the day with a little help from his new friends.  It's a simple idea, but comes across well, with a good message or two to boot.  As animated movies go, ""Robots"" doesn't really have anything new, except perhaps stylistically.  The whole movie feels like a 1950's-style view of a robotic future, with shiny chrome, streamlined stuff, and fins.Of note to fellow geeks out there: as with the last Blue Sky film, the trailer for the next ""Star Wars"" film (with Ewan McGregor in a more dramatic role) is attached to ""Robots"".  And as trailers go, this one will certainly get your attention.  Also attached is short film starring Scrat, the little ""Ice Age"" rodent who's always after his acorn.""Robots"" is a worthy effort, but falls short of becoming truly a classic, perhaps because it must juggle so many characters simultaneously.",4,"""Robots"" is fun and flashy, with rusty spots",1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,3018,"['everyone', 'keeping', 'score', 'are', 'now', 'three', 'computer', 'animation', 'studios', 'out', 'there', 'Pixar', 'old', 'favorite', 'DreamWorks', 'Animation', 'more', 'pop', 'fizz', 'actual', 'storytelling', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'having', 'just', 'released', 'second', 'film', 'Robots', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'place', 'somewhere', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks', 'flashier', 'Pixar', 'more', 'concerned', 'making', 'good', 'movie', 'filling', 'screen', 'pop', 'culture', 'references.2002', 'Ice', 'Age', 'was', 'sizable', 'hit', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'quake', 'corporate', 'shoes', 'was', 'blip', 'computer', 'animation', 'radar', 'screen', 'too', 'big', 'be', 'ignored', 'mix', 'dramatic', 'storytelling', 'light', 'humor', 'crisp', 'animation', 'made', 'film', 'winner', 'box', 'office', 'Now', 'money', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'invested', 'better', 'animation', 'larger', 'cast', 'new', 'movie', 'Robots', 'bigger', 'cast', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'Rather', 'just', 'four', 'characters', 'dominated', 'Ice', 'Age', 'plethora', 'complex', 'well-voiced', 'robots', 'star', 'picture', 'can', 'make', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'everybody', 'doing', 'given', 'time.Rodney', 'Copperbottom', 'voiced', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'little', 'burg', 'world', 'robotic', 'beings', 'Rather', 'settle', 'being', 'dishwasher', 'literally', 'dishwasher', 'father', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'make', 'something', 'work', 'Big', 'Weld', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'rather', 'large', 'eccentric', 'inventor', 'who', 'little', 'guys', 'even', 'big', 'time', 'money-maker.Immediately', 'arriving', 'Robot', 'City', 'Rodney', 'paths', 'Fender', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'neglected', 'slightly', 'unstable', 'robot', 'who', 'gang', 'out-of-date', 'misfits', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'along', 'world', 'problem', 'Big', 'Weld', 'company', 'been', 'corporatized', 'symbolized', 'Phineas', 'T.', 'Ratchet', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'no', 'longer', 'public', 'only', 'interested', 'making', 'profit', 'first', 'Ratchet', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'soon', 'apparent', 'just', 'being', 'used', 'own', 'mother', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'do', 'evil', 'protagonist', 'Rodney', 'obviously', 'must', 'right', 'wrongs', 'save', 'day', 'little', 'help', 'new', 'friends', 'simple', 'idea', 'across', 'well', 'good', 'message', 'two', 'boot', 'animated', 'movies', 'go', 'Robots', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'new', 'perhaps', 'stylistically', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', ""1950's-style"", 'view', 'robotic', 'future', 'shiny', 'chrome', 'streamlined', 'stuff', 'fins.Of', 'note', 'fellow', 'geeks', 'out', 'there', 'last', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'film', 'trailer', 'next', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'more', 'dramatic', 'role', 'attached', 'Robots', 'trailers', 'go', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'get', 'attention', 'Also', 'attached', 'short', 'film', 'starring', 'Scrat', 'little', 'Ice', 'Age', 'rodent', 'who', 'always', 'acorn', 'Robots', 'worthy', 'effort', 'short', 'becoming', 'truly', 'classic', 'perhaps', 'must', 'juggle', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'simultaneously']",N/A

Then I saw Robots.Or should I say, then I saw one hour of Robots.At the one hour mark, having checked my watch for the 4th or 5th time, I realized that it was not going to get any better. Robin Williams just wasn't going to deliver one inspired punchline. The plot was not going to take one remotely interesting twist. The fart and butt jokes were not going to stop substituting themselves for actual humor. It was going to suck out my will to live if I stayed and so I left.I have to wonder how such a talented cast could be so incredibly misused. Wait-- Incredible-- Let's talk about the Incredibles. Another computer animated film and one that combined eye-popping animation with a compelling story sprinkled with fabulous action sequences, hysterical comedy and a surprising emotional depth. One of my favorite movies in recent history.If anything, the brilliance of the Incredibles made me even more excited about seeing the movie Robots. And Robots, amazingly, managed to be the ""bizarro-Incredibles"" being absolutely the opposite of everything good about the Incredibles. Boring story, bland animation, almost no visual interest, not one laugh, zero emotional honesty.

However, I still found it entertaining to watch with my family with a wonderful display of CG technology along with a lot of laughs.Positives:1)  Humor.  Yes, there are a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  Any comedy with Robin Williams has to be.  There was some gross-out humor (see negatives) but when they shied away from that, the movie was very funny.2)  CG Animation.  The computer graphics were fantastic!!  This isn't a surprise as it was made by the same people that made Ice Age.  What should leave anybody left with their eyes wide open was when the star of the cartoon (Rodney) was traveling through Robot City in a ball.  It would not surprise me if this was the most time-consuming part of the animation creation.3)  Message.  This is one of my favorite messages in any movie... if you have a dream never give up in fulfilling that dream.  There are also other messages such as caring for people no matter their age, shape, and type.Negatives:1)  Gross Out Humor:  While this was funny, I was surprised that they felt they needed to degrade themselves to the level of flatulence and posterior-jokes.  The movie was funny on its own and I felt no reason that they needed to get that desperate.  This movie should have been above all that.2)  Portrayal Of Big Business:  It seems that this movie carries a negative message about big business.  As a child, after watching this movie I would think that big business must be evil and want to control the world.  Everything about business (bit or small) in this movie contradicts what really happens in the business world in order for a company to survive.  This idea that a large business would be threatened enough to want to kill (literally) an upstart mom n' pop just left me appalled.3)  Lacks originality.  There was just nothing ground breaking or original about this movie.4)  Lacked heart.  Often times the difference between a good movie and a great movie is the heart of the movie.  Again, there wasn't anything original and it seemed like the actors all just coasted through the production.  I just didn't see anything that said that a little extra was given into creating this movie.In the end, I would recommend catching it at least once.  The kids will probably get a big kick out of it and desire to see it a few more times.

The commuting scene near the beginning is a vertiginous and seemingly endless escapade through loops and jumps and slides that was as delightful to the eye as it was turbulent to the stomach. And there's a domino scene that is just stunning. The movie's characters are lovable and well-drawn, and the action is VERY fast-paced.The story--a hoary and cliched tale of a down-and-out kid trying to make it to the big time--nearly sinks the film. There were the expected subplots of ""doing it for my Dad,"" and taking on the big corporation -- this time a soul-sucking firm intent on making a profit (and running out the small-timers) with shiny new products that everyone was induced to buy. I don't suppose there's any irony that the film, made by a big business (20th Century Fox), is making oodles by pandering to the very folks who are pushed around by big business. Alas.""Robots"" includes an awful lot of toilet and sexual humor, most of which will sail thankfully right over he kiddos' heads. Some won't, though, and is thoroughly unfunny. A character with an enormous backside was the source of a string of vacuous rear-end jokes. The extended farting scene might have delighted six-year-olds but seemed out of place in a robot movie -- don't you need flesh to fart? And was it that hard for the writers to resist telling a meek character to ""grow some bolts""? One senses that Robin William and Drew Carey (who voiced two of the characters) improvised some if this ""adult"" dialog. We're a long way from ""Alladin,"" here, both in humor and intelligence.Personally, the best way to enjoy the movie is with the dialog off, allowing you to enjoy the incredible animation (the shots of oil flowing over metal are incredible) and action without the turnoff of the incessant potty humor and banal story line.",3,"Cute enough, but marred by potty jokes",1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,1899,"['art', 'animation', 'Robots', 'are', 'star', 'show', 'incredibly', 'detailed', 'inventive', 'commuting', 'scene', 'beginning', 'vertiginous', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'escapade', 'loops', 'jumps', 'slides', 'was', 'delightful', 'eye', 'was', 'turbulent', 'stomach', 'domino', 'scene', 'just', 'stunning', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable', 'well-drawn', 'action', 'VERY', 'fast-paced.The', 'story', 'hoary', 'cliched', 'tale', 'down-and-out', 'kid', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'nearly', 'film', 'were', 'expected', 'subplots', 'doing', 'Dad', 'taking', 'big', 'corporation', 'time', 'soul-sucking', 'firm', 'intent', 'making', 'profit', 'running', 'out', 'small-timers', 'shiny', 'new', 'products', 'everyone', 'was', 'induced', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'irony', 'film', 'made', 'big', 'business', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'making', 'oodles', 'pandering', 'very', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'pushed', 'big', 'business', 'Alas', 'Robots', 'awful', 'lot', 'toilet', 'sexual', 'humor', 'most', 'will', 'sail', 'thankfully', 'right', 'heads', 'wo', ""n't"", 'though', 'thoroughly', 'unfunny', 'character', 'enormous', 'backside', 'was', 'source', 'string', 'vacuous', 'rear-end', 'jokes', 'extended', 'farting', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'delighted', 'six-year-olds', 'seemed', 'place', 'robot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'flesh', 'fart', 'was', 'writers', 'resist', 'telling', 'meek', 'character', 'grow', 'bolts', 'One', 'Robin', 'William', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'who', 'voiced', 'two', 'characters', 'improvised', 'adult', 'dialog', ""'re"", 'long', 'way', 'Alladin', 'here', 'humor', 'intelligence.Personally', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'dialog', 'allowing', 'enjoy', 'incredible', 'animation', 'shots', 'oil', 'flowing', 'metal', 'are', 'incredible', 'action', 'turnoff', 'incessant', 'potty', 'humor', 'banal', 'story', 'line']",N/A

The forced gags (the Brittney Spears dance number, ""Scareface"" reference, and flatulence jokes) were weak, animation and music was bland (I'm sorry, but even the inclusion of the Tom Waits song ""Underground"" couldn't save it), and the dialog and story were predictable.I can understand how kids under the age of eight might like a movie like this, but this isn't what I would consider ""family"" entertainment.

The story is fine, but it seems to be spread a little thin in this flick.  Our hero, Rodney Copperbottom, leaves Rivettown for the big city to become an inventor and eventually repair his overworked and underappreciated father.  When he reaches Robot City, he finds a great company that has been overrun by corruption and greed by the spoiled crybaby, Ratchet, who's helping his mother take control of the city.  From there, we are offered up a good mix of characters who help Rodney save the day.Ewan McGregor does a good job as Rodney, and Greg Kinnear was surprisingly good as Ratchet.  The rest of the cast did a fine job, but the glaring letdown was the performance of Robin Williams as Fender, Rodney's comical sidekick.  Having voiced the genie in ""Aladdin,"" you'd expect more of the same from Williams, but his delivery is flat and overshadowed by the other robots in the flick.I don't recall any bad words in the film.  In fact, they're covered up with words like ""scrap.""The animation is pretty good, but those spoiled by ""The Incredibles"" and ""A Bug's Life"" will be left wanting more.Overall, not a bad film.

So when he's finally old enough, Rodney decides to say goodbye to his parents.  He buys himself a one-way ticket to Robot City, where he'll finally meet his hero, Bigweld (Mel Brooks) and make his dreams come true.Once Rodney arrives in Robot City, however, he finds that Bigweld has disappeared, and he's been replaced by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), who, with his mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), is plotting to do away with hand-me-down robots once and for all.  Together, with his new friends (including Fender, played by Robin Williams, and Piper, played by Amanda Bynes), Rodney decides to find Bigweld and bring him back to Robot City.Don't expect any Oscars for Robots-because it's just another animated movie.

634084,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNQS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","The strength and weakness of ""Robots"" is found in the revelation somewhere in the special features that the genesis for the 2005 film was the idea to do a computer animated movie about robots.  This led to production designer William Joyce coming up with robots inspired by outboard engines and metal items found around the house rather than the cinematic traditions represented by ""Metropolis"" and ""Forbidden Planet.""  Listening to how they came up with the ""generations"" of robots was fascinating and you can see how once they latched on the idea there were inspired to come up with all of the delightful creations we see on screen.  Consequently the characters pretty much came before the story and while director Chris Wedge and co-director Carlos Saldanha (the ""Ice Age"" team) have created a wonderful world, the story being told does not rise to the same level (to wit, it needs an upgrade).The irony is that why the character designs work on two level so that adults can enjoy them in a different way from the kiddies, does not apply to the story, which is programmed for the short set (despite the cinematic and cultural references that only older viewers can get) and based on a simple message written large and hammered repeatedly: you should follow your dreams.  The dreamer in this case is young Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor), an inventor, who leaves Rivet Town for the big metropolis of Robot City, to work for his hero Bigweld (Mel Brooks).  Rodney leaves behind his parents, Herb (Stanley Tucci), a dishwasher, and Mrs. Copperbottom (Dianne Wiest), and the initial problem is that Herb needs spare parts that are no longer available.  Rodney discovers this is because of a larger problem: Bigweld has disappeared and in his place are Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his evil mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), who want all of the robots in the world to upgrade or go to the scrap heap.I have to stop and wonder if younger viewers will make any connection between Ratchet and Gasket's grand plan and the Nazi designs for helping along the creation of a master race through the practice of eugenics.  Or will they simply see this as just another example of the economic imperative for things to become new and improved?  There is a larger lesson here, but ""Robots"" just takes the evil at face value with the undesirable result that the villains are too buffonish to be really evil but doing things that are evil enough that their humor rings hollow.  If the success of a film ultimately rests on the villains, then ""Robots"" is at a disadvantage for anyone who is a bit along in grade school.As much as I enjoy Robin Williams jumping off into the deep end of the pool casting him as the voice of Fender works against ""Robots"" as far as I am concerned.  None of the other supporting characters stand a chance as long as he is around, and most of the better bits in the film gravitate towards his character.  Only Jennifer Coolidge's Aunt Fanny provides any real competition, and that is mainly because that baby has back, although Paul Giamatti as Tim the Gate Guard has a nice scene, but they really should have spread the wealth a lot more given the rich characters they created.  The other thing that bothered me was that I wanted Rodney to end up with Piper (Amanda Bynes) rather than Cappy (Halle Berry), because I thought they were the more appropriate pairing given Rodney's youth and the way the film is geared for the kiddies.  But ""Robots"" is totally locked into the formula by that point in the film.  The best thing that can be said about this film is that if ""Robots"" is an average computer animated film, then that still constitutes an above average film.",4,"The ideas are not as great as the execution, but ""Robots"" is still fun",1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,3705,"['strength', 'weakness', 'Robots', 'found', 'revelation', 'somewhere', 'special', 'features', 'genesis', '2005', 'film', 'was', 'idea', 'do', 'computer', 'animated', 'movie', 'robots', 'led', 'production', 'designer', 'William', 'Joyce', 'coming', 'up', 'robots', 'inspired', 'outboard', 'engines', 'metal', 'items', 'found', 'house', 'rather', 'cinematic', 'traditions', 'represented', 'Metropolis', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'Listening', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'generations', 'robots', 'was', 'fascinating', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'once', 'latched', 'idea', 'were', 'inspired', 'come', 'up', 'delightful', 'creations', 'see', 'screen', 'Consequently', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'came', 'story', 'director', 'Chris', 'Wedge', 'co-director', 'Carlos', 'Saldanha', 'Ice', 'Age', 'team', 'have', 'created', 'wonderful', 'world', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'rise', 'same', 'level', 'wit', 'upgrade', '.The', 'irony', 'why', 'character', 'work', 'two', 'level', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'different', 'way', 'kiddies', 'not', 'apply', 'story', 'programmed', 'short', 'set', 'cinematic', 'cultural', 'references', 'only', 'older', 'viewers', 'can', 'get', 'based', 'simple', 'message', 'written', 'large', 'hammered', 'repeatedly', 'should', 'follow', 'dreams', 'dreamer', 'case', 'young', 'Rodney', 'Copperbottom', 'voice', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'inventor', 'who', 'Rivet', 'Town', 'big', 'metropolis', 'Robot', 'City', 'work', 'hero', 'Bigweld', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Rodney', 'parents', 'Herb', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'dishwasher', 'Mrs.', 'Copperbottom', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'initial', 'problem', 'Herb', 'spare', 'parts', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'Rodney', 'larger', 'problem', 'Bigweld', 'disappeared', 'place', 'are', 'Phineas', 'T.', 'Ratchet', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'evil', 'mother', 'Madame', 'Gasket', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'want', 'robots', 'world', 'upgrade', 'go', 'scrap', 'heap.I', 'have', 'stop', 'wonder', 'younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'make', 'connection', 'Ratchet', 'Gasket', 'grand', 'plan', 'Nazi', 'designs', 'helping', 'creation', 'master', 'race', 'practice', 'eugenics', 'will', 'simply', 'see', 'just', 'example', 'economic', 'imperative', 'things', 'become', 'new', 'improved', 'larger', 'lesson', 'here', 'Robots', 'just', 'evil', 'face', 'value', 'undesirable', 'result', 'villains', 'are', 'too', 'buffonish', 'be', 'really', 'evil', 'doing', 'things', 'are', 'evil', 'enough', 'humor', 'rings', 'hollow', 'success', 'film', 'ultimately', 'villains', 'then', 'Robots', 'disadvantage', 'anyone', 'who', 'bit', 'grade', 'school.As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'jumping', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'pool', 'casting', 'voice', 'Fender', 'works', 'Robots', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'None', 'other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'stand', 'chance', 'as', 'long', 'around', 'most', 'better', 'bits', 'film', 'gravitate', 'character', 'Only', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Aunt', 'Fanny', 'real', 'competition', 'mainly', 'baby', 'back', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Tim', 'Gate', 'Guard', 'nice', 'scene', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'spread', 'wealth', 'lot', 'more', 'given', 'rich', 'characters', 'created', 'other', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'wanted', 'Rodney', 'end', 'up', 'Piper', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'rather', 'Cappy', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'thought', 'were', 'more', 'appropriate', 'pairing', 'given', 'Rodney', 'youth', 'way', 'film', 'geared', 'kiddies', 'Robots', 'totally', 'locked', 'formula', 'point', 'film', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'Robots', 'average', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'then', 'still', 'above', 'average', 'film']",N/A

634095,A3SZECLY107BY2,B00005JNQS,Luis A. Hernandez,"[0, 1]","Upon first assessment, the movie Robots may seem like just another story about living the American Dream, but it's so much more than that. The protagonist comes from a dirt poor family, whose father has to work washing dishes to make ends meet. Living off of hand-me-downs, his father has nothing to give him except for supporting him in his dream to one day become a world famous inventor. Coming from such humble beginnings, Joe Robot (Rodney) then goes to the big city, and after much hard work and old fashioned American ingenuity, reaches the top of the food chain and becomes partners with his childhood idol.In this everyday story are inserted several interesting conflicts of ideas that are very relevant to our modern world. There is the question of the place of corporations and how they are run. The idea of contentment with ourselves as we are vs. having to purchase a perfect body is toyed with. A rejection of Materialism is a strong theme in the film. Finally, there is the eerie parallel to historical events where the extermination of inferiors was used as an excuse for genocide.As a child, Rodney was raised watching Bigweld, the head of the company that mass produces all the parts and upgrades which all Robots come from, on TV telling him about the value of the individual. But when Rodney grows up and goes to meet this man, he finds a very different person heading the business now in the form of Ratchet. Ratchet is a very different type of CEO. He is not interested in the little man. His only concern is making profit. The leadership style of these two individuals leading the same company represents our own big corporations who have grown so powerful. Ratchet, blind by greed, loses sight of the fact that it's the little man that allows his business to succeed. The character of Bigweld makes the statement that you can run a business in a moral and honest way, and still make money.The movie also tries to teach us about inner beauty. I personally felt a pang of disgust when in the film Ratchet unveils his latest batch of upgrades newly available. In a world of mass advertising where you have sex, beautiful models, and teen pop stars like Britney spears in your face all the time, it's easier to become unhappy with the way you look, if you're not as ""pretty"". Fad diets and plastic surgeons with their liposuction, boob jobs, and butt implants take advantage of this. In Robots, these upgrades were just that; unnecessary cosmetic tinkering that prey upon the insecurities of people exposed to millions of dollars of advertising, for the purpose of bankrupting one out of their money. Ratchet was the pretty poster boy incarnation of this. The Rusties were the opposite extreme. Ratchet's mom shows what happens when you let the idea of outward beauty consume you. You become a hideous, ugly looking monster. Pappy, who sits on the board of Bigweld industries, sheds her upgrades when she is converted the Rodney's cause, yet loses none of her beauty, which is instead heightened by her acts.A rejection of Materialism is also a strongly prominent theme. Rodney grows up with his cousins used hand-me-downs. The rusties live off of used parts they find in the dumpsters. Rodney's father relates the story that he wishes he could have lived his dream, (which has astonishingly nothing to do with money considering the state of poverty they live in) but is to have continued to play his instrument and become a musician. When Rodney's father apologizes for not being able to have provided better for his son, Rodney replies that he gave him the best thing in the world, which was believing in him.The most obvious parallel in the film is Ratchets plan to eliminate the large numbers of undesirables by ending the production of parts with Hitlers' plan to exterminate non Aryans by sending them to death camps. The huge trash collection machines patrolled the streets looking for outmodes to send to the ovens, much like the Gestapo patrolled Europe searching for jews, gypsies, gays, and sympathizers of these groups to send to the camps.Robots is a kids movie that dealt with a lot of adult themes.

If we do this, ""Robots"" comes out lacking against its frozen predecessor. It is not as novel in terms of its intent and also the script is not as powerful (perhaps because it's also tougher to relate to inanimate beings such as robots, than it is to relate to animals or humans). But still, it is a funny (though predictable) movie, with touching moments and plenty of excitement all through it. I particularly enjoyed the ride that Rodney is put through when he arrives in Robot City, in order to get to the headquarters of Big Weld, where he dreams of working.The humor can be argued to be more adult-oriented, but still with  proper supervision, I totally see it being fit for children. The fact that our 18-month old was jumping out of his seat halfway through the movie is more the result of him being hyper than the movie not being fit for children. Now I admit this is no ""Finding Nemo"" (which keeps him entertained all through it, time and again).

That 'Cars' has been pushed back to next year may point to problems - although with their high standards and willingness to go back to the storyboard, I'm not worried.  However, Robots is the first film to truly compete with Pixar's output in both visual and script terms.Dreamworks had Shrek and its sequel (which were pretty good) and then disappointed terribly with the appauling Shark Tale - visually their next (Madagascar) looks undercooked.  Even Pixar's weakest (arguably A Bugs Life) is still excellent (and beat Dreamworks Antz on all levels).By these standards Fox looked like a rank outsider.  Ice Age was good but pretty fogettable and didn't rival any of the other studios on design while the story smelled a little too much like that of Monsters Inc.  This all has lead to Robots being the biggest animated surprise in a good few years.  We all knew that The Incredibles would be good - Robots hits you right between the eyes when you're not looking!The design is fantastic and beautifully rendered.  Its entire universe has been created from the imagination and is stunning.  Robot City is a vista that takes away the breath!Also taking away the breath are the numerous expertly handled set-pieces.  The city's pubic transportation system gives us our best moments with a staggeringly intricate journey from the station to BigWeld Industries.  Also amazing are the domino sequence and the genuinely exciting climax. Another particular favourite moment of mine was the fight over a foot that ends up as a wonderfully choreographed ballet.The voice talent is uniformly good. Robin Williams obviously steals the show but, since his character is pretty incidental, isn't allowed to upstage the action.The script is tight and works on all levels - from in-jokes to fart gags - with a good message that isn't rammed down the audiences' throats.  Laugh-out-loud funny!Overall a recommendation for any and every age group (my 3 year old was spell-bound) and an announcement that the bar has officially been raised.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 2]","The 2005 animated film ""Robots"", created by Blue Sky Studios and Fox Animation Studios, tells the fictional tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor) who lives in a world populated purely by robots.  After he was built and upgraded (often with spare parts) by his parents, he decides to venture from his small town to Robot City where the famed robot Bigweld (voice of Mel Brooks) resides.  Rodney, inspired by Bigweld who spends his life inventing and improving parts for robots, has become an inventor himself partly to help his father Herb Copperbottom (voice of Stanley Tucci), who has been a dishwasher for many years and is increasingly in need of repair.  However, spare robot parts are becoming increasingly scarce because a greedy robot named Ratchet (voice of Greg Kinnear) and his mother Madame Gasket (voice of Jim Broadbent) took over Bigweld's robotic supply company.  Their plan is to replace outdated robots with new sleek models and reap the profits.  To do so, they need to melt down as many spare parts as possible to create their sleek new designs.  So, many robots run fearfully away as the large collector robots scour Robot City for spare parts that they then take to the furnaces operated by Madame Gasket.  In desperation, many outdated robots that are breaking down come to Rodney in hopes of being repaired.  Rodney then becomes determined to help them with assistance from an odd assortment of other robots.With wonderfully rendered computer animation and a wonderful story, ""Robots"" is a fun and engaging story for both young and old alike.  Other interesting characters include Piper (voice of Amanda Bynes), Crank (voice of Drew Carey), Aunt Fanny (voice of Jennifer Coolidge), Fender (voice of Robin Williams) and Lug (voice of Harland Williams).  The story for the film (written by Ron Mita, Jim McClain and David Lindsay-Abaire) is possibly an allegory to modern society as demonstrated by it's conveyance of greed and the constant need to upgrade trying to replace a philosophy based upon repair, reuse, recycling and thrift.

634110,A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,B00005JNQS,"Michael Meredith ""e-Mike""","[3, 6]","Robots is what happens when you take a simple story, put it in the hands of talented animators and an exceptional case of actors to provide the voices; and then just allow the project to drift.  For all its promise, the movie just falls flat on its face.  I'm guessing that there was no strong guiding force with a coherent vision to bring all of it together.  Read on and you'll see what I mean.The story is simple enough, ""young robot inventor heads off to the big city to make good, encounters evil corporate titan that has unseated the benevolent founder of his business, and struggles to make things right.""  Rodney Copperbottom wants to become an inventor for Big Weld Industries, and work for his idol, Mr. Big Weld -- whose philosophy has always been to make life better for the common robot.  The overall vision of this alternative robot universe is quite compatible with the far, far better Monsters Inc., but the details just seem to get jumbled.  Consider the transportation system of Robot City, which combines elements of the game MouseTrap, pinball arcade games and gyroscopic toys from the 50's.  It all makes for a great visual, and a chuckle or two, but does little to advance the story.The animation is detailed and well done, perhaps a little too well done.  The detail is extraordinary, and I suspect it looked great on a movie house screen.  But viewing it on DVD, you're tempted to hover over the pause button just to answer the many ""what the heck was that in the background?"" questions.  But again, these little details do little more than generate a smile or two, while the story just limps along.That brings us to the cast.  Ewan McGregor and Greg Kinnear provide the voices for Rodney and his nemesis Ratchet, and they do a good job with generally bland material.  But the tragedy of this production is that someone recruited Robin Williams and Mel Brooks (arguably two of the funniest men on the planet), and then gave them sober pills!  Whereas on Disney's Aladdin, Williams was given free rein to adlib and build his character, on can almost see the script supervisor hovering over him as he stood at the microphone reading his lines for Robots.  The same with Mel Brooks, the voice is there but the jokes obviously came from someone else.It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it's not worthy of the popularity that the previous work from this creative team (Ice Age) turned out.  It ends up looking rushed and pieced together, and never really makes a connection with the audience.",2,It should have been better!,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,2513,"['Robots', 'what', 'when', 'take', 'simple', 'story', 'put', 'hands', 'talented', 'animators', 'exceptional', 'case', 'actors', 'provide', 'voices', 'then', 'just', 'allow', 'project', 'drift', 'promise', 'movie', 'just', 'flat', 'face', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'strong', 'guiding', 'force', 'coherent', 'vision', 'bring', 'together', 'Read', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'young', 'robot', 'inventor', 'heads', 'big', 'city', 'make', 'good', 'encounters', 'evil', 'corporate', 'titan', 'unseated', 'benevolent', 'founder', 'business', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'Rodney', 'Copperbottom', 'become', 'inventor', 'Big', 'Weld', 'Industries', 'work', 'idol', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Weld', 'philosophy', 'always', 'been', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'common', 'robot', 'overall', 'vision', 'alternative', 'robot', 'universe', 'quite', 'compatible', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'details', 'just', 'seem', 'get', 'jumbled', 'Consider', 'transportation', 'system', 'Robot', 'City', 'elements', 'game', 'MouseTrap', 'pinball', 'arcade', 'games', 'gyroscopic', 'toys', '50', 'great', 'visual', 'chuckle', 'two', 'little', 'advance', 'story.The', 'animation', 'detailed', 'well', 'done', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'done', 'detail', 'extraordinary', 'suspect', 'looked', 'great', 'movie', 'house', 'screen', 'viewing', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'tempted', 'hover', 'pause', 'button', 'just', 'answer', 'many', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'background', 'questions', 'again', 'little', 'details', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'generate', 'smile', 'two', 'story', 'just', 'along.That', 'cast', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'voices', 'Rodney', 'nemesis', 'Ratchet', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'generally', 'bland', 'material', 'tragedy', 'production', 'someone', 'recruited', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'arguably', 'two', 'funniest', 'men', 'planet', 'then', 'gave', 'sober', 'pills', 'Whereas', 'Disney', 'Aladdin', 'Williams', 'was', 'given', 'free', 'rein', 'adlib', 'build', 'character', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'script', 'supervisor', 'hovering', 'over', 'stood', 'microphone', 'reading', 'lines', 'Robots', 'same', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'voice', 'there', 'jokes', 'obviously', 'came', 'someone', 'else.It', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'worthy', 'popularity', 'previous', 'work', 'creative', 'team', 'Ice', 'Age', 'turned', 'out', 'up', 'looking', 'rushed', 'pieced', 'together', 'never', 'really', 'connection', 'audience']",N/A

However, the being said, it IS a good little movie.One of the things I noticed about it that makes it a bit different from other cartoonish type animation movies out right now is that this one had a lot of adult innuendo that the other movies don't have. While a younger child, of say age 3-9 or 10 might not notice it, my son was 11 when he watched it, and he got a lot of the 'adult' innuendo in the jokes. He was slow on the uptake, but on one scene, he turned around and looked at me and said, ""Oooohhhh, I GET it now!""While I liked the movie, and so did my daughter and son, I found myself diappointed in my expectations of what this movie would be about and what it would be like. If you let go of those expectations and realize that this is NOT Monsters, Inc. or Cars, or a Bug's Life, or any of the others like this, you might be able to enjoy the movie for what it is. Otherwise, you'll probably be disappointed too.I don't recommend the movie for little kids. The only thing about the movie that will appeal to them is the actual animation.

634126,AHF97M45JFCB,B00005JNQS,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","From the beginning, the computer-animated feature film genre has been a back and forth battle between Pixar and DreamWorks and then a new contender arrived seemingly overnight to offer legitimate competition in the form of the Ice Age series (which is now a trilogy with a spin off called Rio nearly complete).  The company, of course, is Blue Sky and with distribution being handled by 20th Century Fox, the studio has had an impressive run of CG hits including the Dr. Seuss classic Horton Hears a Who.  Robots snuck into the mix back in 2005 with a cast that was impressive even for a big budget CG feature!The story follows Rodney Copperbottom, voiced by Ewan McGregor, a small town robotic inventor with aspirations of moving beyond his quaint surroundings.Rodney embarks on a journey to Robot City to meet his idol, the majestic inventor Bigweld, voiced by none other than Mel Brooks.Once in the big city, Rodney discovers that things aren't at all like they seemed on television. Before long he hooks up with the Rusties, a ragtag group of street-smart outdated bots including Fender (Robin Williams), his spunky kid sister Piper (voiced by Amanda Bynes), Crank (Drew Carey), and Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge- that would be Stiffler's mom from American Pie folks).The main cast is only further extenuated by a back up cast that includes Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Paul Giamatti, Jay Leno, Paula Abdul, Terry Bradshaw, Al Roker and James Earl Jones reprising his famous Darth Vader voice.Vocal word aside, the film just plain works on many levels.  The visuals border on sensory overload at times with almost too much going on in the backgrounds.  Multiple viewings are mandatory to fully absorb all of the gags and laughs going on somewhere in the distance at all times.The humor itself is layered enough to where adults will find themselves snickering at much of the dialog/ sociological (and sometimes light sexual) references while the kiddies will be sufficiently entertained by the sheer novelty of watching the bots' onscreen interaction.Comparisons to Pixar's Wall-E are inevitable due to the nature of the protagonists but in all honesty, the two projects have about as much in common as Star Trek and Buck Rogers (but they're both about space right?).  Where Wall-E tells the tale of a solitary garbage-cleaning robot on earth and his unlikely journey toward repopulating the planet, Robots is a family-based coming of age comedy in an all-robot world (in fact there is no reference to humanity ever having existed here).Perhaps the piece's greatest strength is it is one of few that I am aware of that actually demands the computer-animated medium to get its point across.

Fifty years passed by, and still Hollywood want us to believe that this is the bussiness entour we must protect (and I am not even sure that this kind of enterprise existed once).

It led me to the web site where they snuck in a couple bits of the film, including -- at that time -- the longest single scene of animation work produced!  It looked terrific, and also had the added advantage of the voice of Robin Williams as one of the more neurotic robots.  Despite the simple story, which is not a bad thing, ""Robots"" manages to get you to root for our underdog who decides to right the wrongs being done by the large corporation ""upgrading"" what THEY consider to be inferior robots, including our hero's dad!You can't ask for more incentive than that, and so our hero Rodney sets off on his journey and finds along the way others that are willing to help him achieve his goal.  Basically a gang of misfits and mismatched robots made of what can best be described as ""leftover parts""!  I am no professor of fimdom, but this tale is one told many times before in many a different context.  Here it is presented in terrific animation, with engaging action and well written dialog.  That dialog gets spoken by Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Amanda Byrnes, Jim Broadbent, Drew Carey and the aforementioned Robin Williams (""That's me all over..."").  A good deal of the reason for the success of this film must go to the screenwriting of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, who keep the our robotic friends full of wit and vigor.This is really one of the landmark films in animation and is a treat for the whole family!  The Blu-Ray disc really shows off the level of detail that it takes create a marvelously simple tale told to perfection.  The extras on the disc are also worthwhile, especially ""Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty"", which is an appropriate description of the robot with a considerable 'caboose'!  The DTS 5.1 sound makes this film jump at you -- especially with the sound effects of the robots just moving about and occassionally coming apart!

Zwick,"[1, 4]","**1/2Despite its clean and shiny look, its stellar cast of voices and its expert animation, ""Robots"" offers little to interest the adult audience.  Set in a world made up entirely of mechanical creatures, the film tells the tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom who leaves home to find fame and fortune in the Big Bad City.  Once there, he discovers that a major manufacturing company has decided to stop making affordable replacement parts for the robots of the world, instead forcing them to either pay for expensive upgrades or face annihilation in the city's infamous chop shop.  Soon, Rodney and his new assorted pals are taking on the villain and taking a stand for oppressed robots every where.In addition to its rather trite and hackneyed storyline, the screenplay lacks the sharp humor and satirical edge of the ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"" movies, relying instead on a series of uninspired double entendres - and a plethora of flatulence jokes - that seem a trifle inappropriate in a film aimed mainly at young children.

Otherwise, I could've left this one on the shelf and waited till it came on HBO or any of those cable channels.",2,It was alright,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,516,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'buy', 'cartoon', 'DVD', 'last', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'were', 'funny', 'really', 'good', 'bought', 'Robots', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'fan', 'so', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'when', 'watched', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'then', 'rest', 'were', 'just', 'okay', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'worth', '2', 'stars', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'acting', 'Otherwise', 'could', ""'ve"", 'left', 'one', 'shelf', 'waited', 'till', 'came', 'HBO', 'cable', 'channels']",N/A
634162,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JNQS,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 3]","Unlike the Pacifier that ""entertained"" (I use that term loosely) without really giving a message, Robots entertains more thoroughly and gives a somewhat cliched but very important message that kids of all ages should know.Rodney Copperbottom, the main hero and inventor, has been getting ""hand me down"" spare parts ever since he was a child.  His family is poor and can't afford the ""upgrades"" he deserves.  One day Rodney decides to go to Robot City to find a great inventor who proclaims that everyone is special, regardless of how shiny they are, because he wants to become an inventor.  Complications arise and Rodney and friends end up having to save the robots who are considered junk.What follows is a bunch of laughs and funny situations, most of which have been done before.  But it has a good cast of people including Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and, of course, Robin Williams.  The animation is great and there are some nice action sequences that really made me smile.Having been created by the team that brought us Ice Age, Robots injects some similar mechanics.  In Ice Age we had Scrat (who returned in a preview for Ice Age 2...poor Scrat, so funny) and in Robots we have Rodney's washing machine assistant, a small flying robot Rodney created to help his father.  He adds some funny scenes to the mix in a lovable way that Scrat and his eternal quest for the acorn did.  Very cute.I guess in the end if you were to compare this movie to say Incredibles or Finding Nemo, you'd find this movie lacking.  But where I consider the Pacifier to be junk as far as a family film goes, this movie is gold.  Take your kids, friends and those young at heart.  It has a great (if cliched) message about how even those who don't have the most expensive upgrades or the most shiny parts can make a difference.  And I think that while this message has been seen a lot in movies, kids still need to hear it.  It's a good message.  And it's a good movie.

It's a wild and crazy adventure through Rodney Copperbottom's trip to Robot City.Ewen Mcgregor was good. He wasn't the best one, but he was good. I think he played Rodney a little too dramatic in the Big Weld scene, and that's what threw me off a bit with him.Robin Williams, however, was a hoot as Fender! He, as always, probably improvised with a lot of things. He did such a great job when he was ""singing in the oil"". Not to mention, he sang for help two times. Now that kicks!Amanda Bynes was very cute as the little sister, Piper. She sounded so relaxed, and that was what made her character shine.The animation was just like any other CGI film, except for two amazing scenes. The scene where Rodney and Fender are in that bubble type car just is amazing! It looks like it could be a ride itself! And, the Big Weld domino scene was really cool too. It made the shape of Big Weld, and not to mention, it looked like an ocean, and it sure was!I really enjoyed this movie. Every single character played a funny role, which I liked. Some minor role point-outs were Al Roker as the mailbox, and Paul Giamatti as Tim, the gate guard of Big Weld Industries. All in all, I'd give this a solid B+. After all this praising you may ask, why did she give a B+? Well, I thought The Incredibles kicked butt, so I guess it's down there with Ice Age and stuff.By the way, this to the kid who judged the movie on its bad poster and trailer: YOU probably look bad too!

As a young man, he sets off to the big city to meet Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the creator of all of the robots, a great benevolent robot.  Rodney wants to be an inventor and knows that Big Weld will value and help him with his ideas. Upon arrival, he learns that Big Weld's corporation has been taken over by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent). Rodney soon learns of their plans and enlists the aid of his new friends to help him.""Robots"", directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, the folks behind ""Ice Age"", is a bright, colorful, richly detailed film with very little plot.The animation is very well done. All of the robots have slightly burnished edges or area where the paint is wearing away. This detail, coupled with an overall 50s-era visual reference creates a unique and interesting visual style that many adults may find interesting. Hopefully, because that is about all the adults will enjoy.It is very easy to tell each of the studios animated films apart. The Disney and Pixar films are at the top of the heap. They contain an attention to detail unrivaled. Characters and story are developed to the point that they could be real people. The films contain true comedy, suspense or drama, as the story dictates. The films are also worked out to contain a lot of interesting moments for young and old alike. They appeal to everyone, which is why they will become classics. Dreamworks has a mixed record, but their ""Shrek"" films are classics, containing all of the thought and attention to detail found in a Disney film. The ""Shrek"" films are funny, irreverent gag filled fairy tales which appeal to everyone. The Fox animated films are none of these things. ""Robots"" is fun to look at, but the story if overly simplistic.None of the voice actors is memorable or funny. Ewan McGregor seems to be auditioning for his next dramatic role. Halle Berry, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, Drew Carey and many more all join in, to little or no effect. The only actor who seems to be a natural fit is Robin Williams. But he is basically doing the same shtick he always does. And it is less funny than it was in ""Aladdin"".""Robots"" will clearly enchant the children with the bright colors and the fast moving sequences. The adults will most likely find the short preceding the film more funny than ""Robots"".

634168,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNQS,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","If you remember Chris Wedge's previous work 'Ice Age,' you know what I am trying to say.  Like that enjoyable animation film, his new film 'Robots' offers striking visuals, but no orignal story.  Having said that, I find 'Robots' very entertaining.The film begins when a new member arrives to the Copperbottoms family.  Actually, a robot boy is literally 'delivered' to them, and after long toilsome 'labor' our hero robot Rodney is born.The situation is surely corny, but let's wait for a while.  The film barely succeeds in concealing that fact by giving some silly sight gags when Rodney grows up (yes, he grows ... don't ask me how) to be an amateur inventor.  Aspiring to be 'somebody' Rodney (voiced by Ewen McGregor without Scottish accent) goes to the big city called 'Robot City' where he thinks he can meet THE greatest inventor Doctor Bigweld (voiced by Mel Brooks).Actually, as you know, what Rodney finds there turns out different.  Instead of seeing his dream come true, Rodney is treated bad (especially by the annoying guard voiced by Paul Giamatti).  Broken-hearted Rodney meets new friends there, one of whom is Fender (Robin Williams in his fast-talking mood), who gives some funny slapstick gags using his own body.Two things are memorable.  One of them is the film's visuals.  The color texture of the robots (including their nuts, screws, even the shadows) are realized with delicate touch, and the long shot showing the big city is simply beautiful.  Other great thing about the film is its voice cast, which includes, besides the players named above, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Greg Kinnear, Jay Leno, James Earl Jones, Jennifer Coolidge, Diane Wiest, Stanley Tucii, Dan Hedaya, Natasha Lyonne, and Jim Broadbent.  Some of them appear, however, very short -- James Earl Johns as phone booth, for instance -- so do not miss their voices.The jokes are not particualry new, and some of them are too tired, gross, or sexual, I am afraid, for the kids.  But still 'Robots' remains delightful to see throughout.

634169,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNQS,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 5]","ROBOTS opens with an overly excited robot father, Herb Copperbottom (Stanley Tucci), racing down the streets of Riveton (a place that looks lik a mechanical version of a Norman Rockwell-small town) telling everyone he is going to be a father. Upon his arrival at home, he and the wife get to work putting together their baby boy. The baby ""grows"" up by replacing his parts every year. Rodney grows up watching a Mr. Bigweld show on television with his father. Mr. Copperbottom looks up to Mr. Bigweld as the greatest robot in the world. Bigweld is responsible for a huge production company in Robot City that produces replacement parts for Robots around the world. He also has an open-door policy encouraging any robot with an idea to come see him.After causing havoc in the kitchen where Rodney's father works, Rodney boards a train and sets forth to Robot City to meet Bigweld. He meets up with a group of outcasted robots--Piper, Crank, and Fender--who help him find a place to stay and get a start on his own after learning that Bigweld is no longer running his company and that an evil executive named Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) is now in charge.  Ratchet has plans to get rid of outmoded robots and turn them into scrapmetal. It eventually ends up leading to a battle between differing values, the old-school, common 'bots fighting against Ratchet and his army of sweepers and hatcheteers.Visually, ROBOTS is unbelievable. The robots in the movie appear more life-like than any animated robots seen on screen before. Vivid colors brilliantly fill the screen filling one with wonderful optic sensations. Younger children especially will be attracted to the film because of the bold use of color.The movie is also filled with all kinds of humor and cultural references. There's the occassional juevenile toilet gag thrown in, but many of the jokes go beyond that.In a movie that is largely about color, it also uses sound throughout. In a world filled with robots, it would only seem appropriate that things are more noisy than they are in the real world. With all the metal clunking around, noise is bound to be made. In addition, there the movie boasts a fairly decent soundtrack that set the mood for many of the movie's scenes.I enjoyed watching ROBOTS. However, as much as I liked it, I felt that the general plot and pacing of the movie suffered. Though the movie's general plot might not be all that original, it seemed that the filmmakers initially set out to give their own original take on the story.  The movie moved along at a nice pace and didn't feel forced. But that changed during the last half of the movie.  Right around the time that Rodney and Cappy go to Bigweld's mansion, things domino downhill. Up to that point the movie was fine, but from that point on it felt as if the filmmakers wanted to rush to the movie's conclusion to get it over. The last 1/3rd of the film doesn't fit or flow with everything previous to it. Cliches are overused and everything is just too pat-pat. For instance, a ""romance"" between Cappy & Rodney is forced, but the movie would have been more interesting if Piper and Rodney got together. It makes me wonder how much of the film was cut or edited out so that Fox could release it ""on time"".Therefore, the movie itself is just an average animated flick. However, the theatrical release of ROBOTS includes a couple of extras that improve the general movie-going experience. Just prior to ROBOTS there is an animated short featuring Scrat from ICE AGE.  Unbeknownst to many, this short is the first promo announcing the upcoming ICE AGE sequel. In addition to that, because ROBOTS is from FOX animation, the long trailer for REVENGE OF THE SITH is supposed to be shown before every ROBOTS showing.

The voice-overs were bland, the animation was dull (with the exception of one ""wow"" sequence), the story has been done a thousand times over, and some of the characters were flat-out gratuitous (namely Halle Barry's). On top of all of this, the writing was cliched, broad, and immature; in no way would any of it appeal to kids above the age of eleven. As I see more of these animated films from companies other than Pixar, I'm seeing less and less intelligence. To me, great animation is thoughtfully and respectfully made for all ages. The best example of this would be last year's ""The Incredibles"" (yes, from Pixar, the only non-anime company to turn out great work in the genre these days). It contained both simpler messages for children and more complex messages for adults (specifically married couples). ""Incredibles"" was an animated film to which I could respond, ""Deep stuff."" It was real and honest: a near-masterpiece. But besides the afore mentioned anime companies and Pixar, studios --like Disney-- continue to dumb down their work (and quality of animation) to give us crap like ""Robots,"" which in the end is the cinematic equivelant to setting a pile of money on fire.

634172,AUTBHG6070SL4,B00005JNQS,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[8, 11]","Let's get the easy parts out of the way: the animation is incredible. That cross-town ride is pretty hard to forget, and the dominoes were a nice set-piece. What kept working, though, was that all of the robots were unique, and there were hundreds of them, maybe thousands, sometimes hundreds in a single scene. And they all moved right! That's a pretty big statement when ""right"" means ""right for that particular body"", and all the bodies were different. Even complex motions, like roller-derby, came across well. Technical excellence is easy, though. (If you're a super-nerd, watch for the reflections.)Good characters are hard, and good relationships are harder. Yes, this is a movie for kids, so we're not talking about any deep subtleties. Still, you really care about Rod Copperbottom, you really feel for his parents, you really like Aunt Fanny even if you'd never want to be seen in public with her, and it's kind of sweet that Mr. Bigweld likes her for her conspicuous assets. And a little bathroom humor never hurts.Nor does a charmingly manic performance by Robin Williams. The whole production team seems to have caught his spirit, and keeps the little visual and verbal jokes coming in a steady stream. Remember what I said about good motion? That even translated into physical humor. Movies like ""Final Fantasy"" may look good, but can't deliver a prat-fall that you'll really believe.OK, maybe you won't remember this one in ten years. Still, whhen you see it again, you'll like it again. It's fun, it's put together well in just about every way, and it's kid-safe. And there's plenty to keep an adult amused while s/he chaperones the li'l darlin'.

634173,A12BTR2MVK2BR5,B00005JNQS,xenofan,"[0, 1]","I liked this movie to begin with.  Unfortunately, once Rodney had arrived at Robot City, I soon began to lose interest.The biggest problem with this movie is that there are far, far too many characters that crowd each other and overwhelm the plot.  Robin Williams is annoying and old - his jokes are repetitive and have been done already in other movies.  I just watched Disney's Aladdin a few weeks back, and couldn't help thinking Robin Williams' performance in robots was ""robot genie!""  Most of the other characters are very forgettable.The animation looks good and the movie does not feel too dated.  The world was very detailed and interesting.  It felt huge and populated.The plot itself was very simplistic and didn't really develop much beyond its basic ""you can follow your dreams whoever you are"" beginnings.  The world was nice and left me with that feeling that you could watch the movie a dozen times and always notice something fun and interesting going off in the background.  Unfortunately, I could barely get through this movie once and won't be watching it again.  The whole thing left me clock-watching and bored.Robots was not a particularly funny movie, and I thought the humor in places was plain obnoxious-fart and ass jokes?  No thanks.  There were a couple of jokes in there that only the adults might get (most of them background stuff, that you'll only spot if you're paying attention) but for the most part, this movie didn't earn more than a ""hah"" from me.  Very disappointing.The ending made me happy only because I was glad the movie was over.
