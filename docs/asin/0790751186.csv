121221,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0790751186,Acute Observer,"[1, 14]","Heartbreak Ridge, 1987 filmThe story begins with newsreels of the war in Korea. There is a scene in a jail, a man is challenged and fights. ""This is your last chance."" Gunnery sergeant Tom Highway had some problems in his past. He is sent to a new unit by bus. There are scenes that are not funny. NCOs must ""lead by example"". Highway introduces himself to his men; they are not enthusiastic. Highway meets an old friend in a bar. We see differences of opinion in this bar. Highway drills his men. Follow the leader. ""I never heard of that school."" A jammed rifle? Highway shows his leadership skills. There is a training exercise. The AK-47 has a distinctive sound. The Recon group plans an ambush. The Major objects to these tactics. Are the Recon troops trained for a real war?A general arrives, like a deus ex machina. One soldier has a problem. Highway visits his ex-wife and talks. The story continues in a bar, then in jail. Later there is a parachute drop and a race to the top. Which group is the winner? Will the Recon group testify against Highway? No. A party is interrupted by a recall of soldiers. These Marines are sent to Granada, a small country in the Caribbean. There is little resistance at first. The Cubans resist, but are defeated. They arrive at a ""School of Medicine"". Students are freed. Next they recon a hill. An armored car fires on them. Can a credit card bring help? Helicopters arrive to knock out an armored car. Next they attack an old brick fort from the 18th century. ""Just enjoying the view."" Back in the states there is a greeting for the returning troops.There were many better war movies in the 1940s and 1950s than this one. It seems to lack a unifying viewpoint. The island of Grenada had Cuban engineers to build a 7,000 foot airport, This would allow jumbo jets to land and bring tourists to Grenada, competition with other resorts.This invasion ended those plans. So what happened over the next thirty years?

121226,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,0790751186,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[4, 6]","Spits Gunnery Sgt Tom Highway to his fellow Sgt after his initial meeting with his milketoast Platoon office Lt Ring, on his return to an active Marine unit. There is a fair amount of formula and predictability to the story here, as Eastwood plays the aforementioned Highway, old, battle scarred, wise and more than a little grizzled - charged with whipping a bunch of misfits into an elite recon unit. His senior officer hates him, his ex wife is still bitter, and he's way to close to retirement for his own comfort, but you know he will somehow triumph in the end. It's interesting to note, that shortly after it's release, it was condemned by some in the military for it's portrayal of Marines, chiefly as being top heavy on bad language, so sensitive types be warned. There's plenty of Eastwood style quips to keep most amused alongside a fairly good, if straightforward story, laced with some action along the way. For me, however the power of the film is the subplot that runs in tandem with the main story, about a lifelong military man, coming to terms with the end of his career, and reflecting on a failed marriage, as well as many other life events along the way. Although this is handled ""in character"" with more than a large dose of macho dialogue, there's a subtle depth to the role, that is often thought provoking, and compliments the rest of the picture very well. One minor complaint would be making the minor skirmish that was the liberation of the island of Grenada into a lavish military operation, which is a bit of a stretch. But considering that (at time of production) this was the only real topical choice for a factual based War, so to speak you can be forgiving. Probably NOT one of Eastwoods best movies by any means, but hugely enjoyable and good for more than a few repeat viewings.

One of those films that we just love to have on, even in the back ground.We also all have a list of films that we call our ""guilty pleasures"" that when pressed we really don't admit watching or liking.This film is both. So completely, uncompromising and totally biased but never-the-less a total ""hoot"" to watch. One of the themes of this film is that they ""don't make them like that any more"" in reference to the main character but they just don't make films like this any more either.There are so many reasons I shouldn't like this film. I am extraordinarily liberal, female and gay but yet this film so appeals to me it almost embarrassing. This film was NOT made for me but honest to goodness, what a great film.I saw this film originally in the cinema when it came out and its been one of my guilty pleasures ever since. It's so full of machismo and testosterone but yet has more truth in it than many academic documentaries that I have seen.I could go over the plot here but read other people's review as they do it more justice than I can, but one thing I love about this film is how the main character (Gunny Highway) actually gets to come home, even if its not all what he expected. The tender way it shows a man who gave his whole life to protecting ours so unselfishly and admirably is wonderful. At one point he states ""I am coming to the end of it, I just want it to be as good as it was when I started"". At that point we all want him to get that moment of happiness even if its fleeting. He deserves it but more so we owe it to him.I find it fitting that I am writing this review in the American Memorial Day when people should be thanking their bloody stars for men like Gunny Highway. They are not 0-1-1. In my mind they are all winners. I sleep better at night knowing they are out there and I thank the heavens that they have been there for us over and over.

121230,A3LRFGYJVXKPDI,0790751186,Bennett Turk,"[2, 5]","My review of &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; is based on what I saw at the threatre, not the DVD release.  &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot;, (named after a battle that took place during the 1950-1953 Korean War), was first supposed to be set in an Army Unit, but, the Army backed out, (too much foul language), so it has a Marine Corp setting.  Clint Eastwood is an older, (but not softer), Marine whose job it is too whip some new soldiers into shape.  Since it's been 8 years since the end of the Vietnam war, they don't take it too seriously, but then they have to go into Grenada where the war is real.  Clint also has a drinking problem and his wife, portrayed by Marsha Mason, has seen it all.  While the film has it's share of memorable scences, many of them based on historical facts; the movie has a huge omission--there is not one word about the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon Oct. 22,1983. For this movie to ignore Lebanon will make it look like a public relations gimmick, instead of the very good film it is.  Many people, at the time, said Grenada was an attempt to take the country's mind off of what was happening in the Middle East.  The White House said Grenada was in the planning stage long before Oct. 22. The film shows Clint and Marsha at a party the night the bombing occured, (before Clint gets called into action), and that's when they could have brought up the incident.  The barracks bombing killed a great many people and the French troops in Lebanon were also attacked with a bomb that same day. Soon after, the Americans, French, and Italians, (who were there as peace keepers), left Lebanon, and the Syrians moved in.  I really liked this movie, but, they should have said something about Lebanon.  A movie about Americans serving in uniform that doesn't say a word about a great many other Americans serving in uniform being killed, (at the exact same time), is inexuseable.  I think this is the only &quot;Hollywood&quot; film about Grenada, although PBS did a documentary on it, and another one about Lebanon.",4,"Not a word about Lebanon, Oct. 22, 1983!",1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,2048,"['review', 'quot', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'quot', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'threatre', 'not', 'DVD', 'release', 'quot', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'quot', 'named', 'battle', 'took', 'place', '1950-1953', 'Korean', 'War', 'was', 'first', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'Army', 'Unit', 'Army', 'backed', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'foul', 'language', 'Marine', 'Corp', 'setting', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'older', 'not', 'softer', 'Marine', 'job', 'too', 'whip', 'new', 'soldiers', 'shape', 'been', '8', 'years', 'end', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'then', 'have', 'go', 'Grenada', 'where', 'war', 'real', 'Clint', 'also', 'drinking', 'problem', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'seen', 'film', 'share', 'memorable', 'scences', 'many', 'based', 'historical', 'facts', 'movie', 'huge', 'omission', 'not', 'one', 'word', 'bombing', 'Marine', 'barracks', 'Lebanon', 'Oct.', '22,1983', 'movie', 'ignore', 'Lebanon', 'will', 'make', 'look', 'public', 'relations', 'gimmick', 'instead', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Many', 'people', 'time', 'said', 'Grenada', 'was', 'attempt', 'take', 'country', 'mind', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Middle', 'East', 'White', 'House', 'said', 'Grenada', 'was', 'planning', 'stage', 'long', 'before', 'Oct.', '22', 'film', 'Clint', 'Marsha', 'party', 'night', 'bombing', 'occured', 'Clint', 'called', 'action', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'incident', 'barracks', 'bombing', 'killed', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'French', 'troops', 'Lebanon', 'were', 'also', 'attacked', 'bomb', 'same', 'day', 'Soon', 'Americans', 'French', 'Italians', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'peace', 'keepers', 'left', 'Lebanon', 'Syrians', 'moved', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'something', 'Lebanon', 'A', 'movie', 'Americans', 'serving', 'uniform', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'great', 'many', 'other', 'Americans', 'serving', 'uniform', 'being', 'killed', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'inexuseable', 'think', 'only', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'film', 'Grenada', 'PBS', 'did', 'documentary', 'one', 'Lebanon']",N/A

Alot of Marines felt it was far-fetched, and not the way Marines act. If this were true then they shouldn't show any movies about the Marine Corps, and that in order to know, and apprecieate what the Marines are all about enlist, and go through boot camp. I know that the movie was all too real to me. I feel that it grasped what a Marine is supposed to be all about: You improvise, adapt, overcome. In another movie called ""Tribes"" which is about a hippie's take on the Marine Corps shows a sign in the barracks saying: ""Can't Means Won't."" The Marines aren't looking for recruits just commmitments which is a billboard I see as I drive along. That's a real Commitment to Excellence, and this is probably what Eastwood was thinking when directing this movie that perhaps the military was getting too soft, and losing the plot about what it was all about, and that was defending the country. Veitnam did soften the military a bit as with the introduction of Selective service instead of a draft notice, and the introduction, or should we say the reintroduction of the G.I. bill to where you can finish your education in the military which is a good thing, but remember the commitment you made when you signed on the first and utmost thing is the defense of your country. This is a rather good movie, and it was done up reverently as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't know as I know I'm too chicken to sign up for military duty, and I don't think I would last.

Gunny commences to whipping his young Marines into shape while tangling with his ex-wife to repair their failed marriage.  Meanwhile, Gunny is one step away from  being under-mined and kicked out by his nemesis.  The film culminates with Gunny's Marine battalion deployed to intervene the crisis on the Island of Grenada (actual operation in 1983), with his reconnaissance platoon leading the way into combat.  It is here where the plot unfolds to reveal if Gunny's training has worked, and if his wife will return to him.  The story is likable, but it suffers from immature male humor, and a lot of profanity.  The feature has significant technical flaws such as an absence of other officers in the battalion, and Gunny's dangerous training methods that would probably result in his being relieved from duty - not to mention a particularly disturbing scene during the Grenada operation when Gunny is portrayed killing a wounded enemy soldier.

Highway longs for one last chance at combat, and for a reconciliation with his fiesty ex-wife (nicely played by Marsha Mason).  What he gets is a platoon of misfits to whip into shape (including Mario Van Peebles), and a steep learning curve in being a sensitive 80's kind of guy.The movie has some fun moments, as when Eastwood matches wits with his new platoon and with his insufferable boss, and when he attempts to be sensitive with his ex-wife.  The action really begins when the Marines are activated for Grenada.  A nasty fight with the Cubans becomes a setting for heroism and a chance for Highway's Marines to shine.

Late in his career he's called in to shape up a batch of new recruits. It's an interesting, if somewhat cliche-ridden movie. I'd suppose that ex-marines would enjoy looking back on all the stereotypes and get a good chuckle. Eastwood is as tough as he is in any of his movies, but there's relatively little fighting, mostly because Eastwood dispatches the bad guys in only a few blows. Add in a bit of romance with an ex-wife and a bit of the war in Granada. In any case, the movie presents a view into the inner life on a military base.

I didn't care for it the first time I saw it, and my first opinion still stands.  It's not a terrible movie (it is a Clint Eastwood film), but it's very conventional, predictable, and a bit tired too.  It's still head and shoulders above most filmmakers' best work, as Eastwood is an artist and great craftsman so even his lesser work is still worth watching.  The film is about Eastwood, a regular army Sergeant, having to train a very slack platoon of Marines and prepare them for battle.  The film ends in Grenada, where Eastwood and his platoon save American students from guerillas.  Many have thought that Eastwood was endorsing the Grenada invasion, but it isn't really like that.  Clint just used that as a catalyst for the bigger picture, so to speak.  There's no political agenda here.Clint gives an excellent performance here.  His character may be a cliche, but it's great to see Clint give new life to that cliche.  Marsha Mason is fine as his ex-wife, Bo Svenson plays a sleazy bar owner convincingly, and Mario Van Peebles is pretty funny as the undesignated leader of the platoon.  The other recruits aren't particularly distinguished, and the actors portraying them are rather stiff.  It is also interesting to note that this is another film where a bar room brawl occurs in an Eastwood film (the others are Bronco Billy, The Rookie, and Every Which Way but Loose).

Plain and simple, it is a horrible movie.  The plot is awkward, the characters flat and unconvincing, and the dialogue for the most part nausiatingly lame.  An example of how bad this movie is comes near the end: althought ordered not to, the squad charges up the hill and comes under fire.  The men run into a nearby building under heavy fire, yet none are hit; now pinned down down, the building takes a few hits from an armored vehicle, which results in the death of one of the soldiers; the Lt. becomes suddenly morose and guilt-ridden for having led them into this mess and getting one of his men killed; along comes Eastwood and tells him to snap out of it, and the Lt. literally says &quot;Ok, hey I know how to get us some help&quot; and holds up a phone (I mean, here we could have had a nice dramatic moment, but instead...); as the phone is dead, Eastwood orders a man up on the roof to find out where the line is cut; they soldier gets up there and despite a hail of bullets miraculously manages to find the problem, and begins to fix it, but how exactly it's fixed isn't clear, because the scene cuts back to inside the building; he comes running up saying that the problem is fixed, so they make a call to their HOME BASE IN THE USA to order in an air strike (I mean, come on!); now Eastwood runs out to mark their position, but seemingly gets blown away by a shot from the armored vehicle; but just at this moment--within an unrealistically short period of time--air support arrives: two heliocopters, one of which fires two rockets, and therewith obliderates the enemy; all the men run out to see if Eastwood is alright, and sure enough he is.

He's cast as an aging Marine sergeant whose whole life has been devoted to the military. Along the way he and his wife, played by Marsha Mason, have split up and he's determined to win her back. He's served in Korea and Vietnam and is now charged with the task of training some raw recruits.  They sure are the sorriest lot of trainees I've ever seen and they hate him of course.

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[56, 63]","When this film came out, aeons ago, a sneering newspaper reviewer called it an the utltimate ""OC"" movie, ""OC"" meaning ""of course."" He was referring to the fact that there isn't a single character or situation in ""Heartbreak Ridge"" that could be called remotely original -- it's basically a 1980s version of every 1940s, '50s, & '60s war movie you ever saw. His evidence:1 - crusty yet somehow loveable sergeant2 - crusty yet somehow loveable sidekick3 - pencil-pushing jerk senior officer4 - green platoon leader5 - woman from past6 - bumbling soldier who needs to grow up7 - assorted Cental Casting platoon members8 - generic training sequences9 - generic trial by fire10 - predictable endingAll this is completely true. I just don't care. The stupid reviewer was too busy being smug to understand that the reason this story has been told so many times is because it is a classic, and classics are timeless. Especially under the tender care of Clint ""Shoot First, Ask Questions Never"" Eastwood.""Ridge"" is the story of Tom Highway (as in ""My Way Or The...""), a bullet-scarred, gravelly-voiced Marine sergeant who has fought in three wars, won a bucketfull of medals, and is now facing mandatory retirement. Ol' Gunny Highway ain't takin' it too well, either -- he drinks, fights with the cops, and gets yelled at by his superiors. Banished to a supply billet, all he yearns for is one last chance to lead combat troops, and before you can say ""of course,"" he's packed off to his old unit -- you know, the same one he was kicked out of years before, for insubordination and conduct unbecoming (you know, the usual Eastwood Offences).Of course, his old unit is run by an unblooded, chin-thrusting martinet named Powers, who is described at one point in the film as being the sort who consults the manual before he mounts his old lady. Powers hates Highway and wants to run him out of the Corps, so he saddles him with a platoon of losers and ungovernable misfits run by a nerdy and clueless lieutenant. Chief among these dolts is the slick-talking Corporal Stitch Jones, played with glib hustla's charm by Mario Van Peebles.Of course, Highway's embittered yet sexy ex-wife is still in town, and of course, Highway is still in love with her, in his foul-mouthed way. When he's not getting shot down by his ex, Highway guzzles beer and reminisces with his old war buddy, Sgt Major Choozoo, who's even more foul-mouthed than Highway. There's even a foul-mouthed female bartender who sits around pouring beers and dispensing crusty Corps wisdom. Honestly, this movie has the best cursing I've ever heard.Of course, Highway's tough love approach is a hard swallow for everybody. Powers is after his stripes, his ex-wife's boyfriend (the guy who played Buford Pusser in the latter two entires in the ""Walking Tall"" movie series) wants to clean his clock, and his Marines wish he would just seize up and die like an old lawnmower. Little do they know that his brutal regimen will one day save their lives! For unbeknownst to all, the villainous Fidel Castro has ordered his military to seize power on the tiny Caribe resort island of Grenada, which houses lots of drunken American medical students. President Reagan ain't takin' this too well, so before you can say ""Semper Fi"" Highway and company are choppering off to put theory into practice and kick communist butt.Do Highway's boys perform up to spec? Will Powers get his commupance? Will the sexy ex-wife be waiting when and if Highway returns? Of course, of course, and of course. But who cares? This movie is hilarious and hugely entertaining. Eastwood's over-the-top alpha-male performance is about as subtle as a bullet to the solar plexus, but it's great fun. So is the glaring villainy of Powers, the charming nerdiness of Ring, the slick charm of Jones, and the crusty bulldog loyalty of Choozoo. These cliched characters are like old friends.""Ridge"" has some funny trivia attached to it. Originally, it was written for an army character, but it seems the army wanted to make the movie a commercial for all its latest weaponry, so Eastwood tapped the Corps instead. When the Marine brass saw it, however, they were so appalled by the language they withdrew their endorsement. And these are Marines we're talking about, the guys who may have actually invented 6 of the 7 words you can't say on TV. It just goes to show you that four or five years in the Pentagon can ruin anybody.More interestingly, the movie's title, ""Heartbreak Ridge"" is a glaring anachronism -- Heartbreak Ridge was taken by the Army's 4th Infantry Division, not the Marines. Clint was too in love with the title to change it, so he threw in a line about how Highway fought in Korea with the army but ""joined the Corps later.""

121290,AZHYK52TCF07I,0790751186,Michael A. Black,"[2, 3]","Clint Eastwood's ""Heartbreak Ridge"" is an outstanding movie that was actually ahead of its time in giving us insight into how much one has to sacrifice when completing a career in the military. The movie is set in 1983, and Eastwood plays a grizzled gunnery sergeant in the USMC. He's been in just about every conflict since the battle on the frozen hill of Korea, from which the title is taken. It's a pretty typical military movie, with veteran Clint taking a bunch of low performing gyrines and whipping them into a top-notch unit. The characters are well cast, espeically the commanding officer, who gets his just desserts in a one-on-one faceoff with Eastwood. The subplot, detailing Eastwood's failed marriage to gorgeous Marsha Mason is perfectly handled as well. You can't help rooting for Clint and her to get back together, but the relationship is handled in very adult manner, leaving that question unanswered untilthe final sequence. The climax, set against the backdrop of the Granada invasion, reminds us all of the high risks our soldiers take to every day keep us all free. It also marks the transitionary phase toward increased professionalism our military was going through during the years of neglect after the fall of Saigon. As a vet who served during that time, I felt especially vindicated when I first saw this movie back when it was released in the theaters. Although I suspect it never got its due from the critics, it's a classic and can be enjoyed over and over.

For me it was a good mix of themes of redemption, reconciliation, coming to terms with retirement, old ways vs. new, duty and perseverance mixed with generous helpings of comedy and classic Clint one-liners.Coming towards the end of his career as a Marine, Tom Highway finds himself taking on the task of whipping into shape a rather hilariously pathetic collection of new Marine recruits. After numerous attempts to drive him off initially, he perseveres and gets them to a point where they can handle themselves in the Grenada invasion that serves as the movies' backdrop.Tom also finds himself trying to reconcile and revive the relationship his ex-wife (Marsha Mason), and also trying to come to terms with a military full of young know-it-alls who have no concept of real-world experience (prompting the line ""Does his mother know he's out running around playing Army?"").Some of the best comic moments are found in Highway's interactions with ""Stitch"" Jones (Mario Van Peoples), especially where  ""Stitch"" gets his comeuppance after hustling Highway out of a meal and then leaving him stranded (havng to hitchike the rest of the way to his base).One caution, the language in this film is pretty brutal, but if you can look past that , you do get a good solid Clint Eastwood outing here.

121307,A2FA18B50XGXJX,0790751186,Sam Damon Jr.,"[12, 42]","We seem to forget a major detail here; and Clint Eastwood should have known better: U.S. Army Rangers rescued the American medical students on Grenada in 1983, marine force recon didn't even do the beach reconnaissance missions, U.S. Navy SEALs did it. U.S. Army Rangers and 82d Airborne Paratroopers did most of the fighting/dying on Grenada and perhaps its fitting that Eastwood chose to title the film &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; after an Army battle to steal glory for those that didn't deserve it. The main character, Gunny Highway and his Sergeant Major friend were in the U.S. Army in Korea when Highway won his Congressional Medal of Honor, then joined the marines afterwards. As a marine during the time this film came out it was highly embarrasing to try to make excuses for this film when there really are none (&quot;Just pretend they are Army Rangers and enjoy the film&quot;). Its one thing to be disappointed that the mc did not get much action in Grenada, it another to use Hollywood as a vehicle to take the exploits of U.S. Army Rangers/Paratroopers and falsely portray these deeds being done by marines, is this &quot;improvising, adapting and overcoming&quot;?. The blame has to be on Eastwood for not checking his facts and his screenwriter for factual integrity. All too often people begin to believe the movies for their view of reality; if its a good movie this is more than OK, if its &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; it inexcusable.The one good thing about the film is that Highway has to fight the official status quo in order to get combat-ready; and in a twist of art imitating life, the marines actually helped Eastwood film the movie on location (wrong location) at Camp Pendleton, California rendering official support for a film which is a LIE. Its true in life that good people have to &quot;fight city hall&quot; which is usually corrupted by bureaucracy. The character, Highway is stellar in that right. But the man playing Highway, Eastwood should not have made it a film about marine recon; all he had to have done was pick up a newspaper of the Grenada operation and used the 75th Ranger Battalion as the protaganists, used their daring combat jump into Point Salines airfield and this film would resonate with reality; veterans would welcome it and not just be the subject of bathroom humor for introducing salty phrases and cliches.",1,Minor detail: U.S. Army Rangers did the rescuing,971222400,"10 11, 2000",2000,2370,"['seem', 'forget', 'major', 'detail', 'here', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'rescued', 'American', 'medical', 'students', 'Grenada', '1983', 'marine', 'force', 'recon', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'beach', 'reconnaissance', 'missions', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'did', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Rangers', '82d', 'Airborne', 'Paratroopers', 'did', 'most', 'fighting/dying', 'Grenada', 'perhaps', 'fitting', 'Eastwood', 'chose', 'title', 'film', 'quot', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'quot', 'Army', 'battle', 'steal', 'glory', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'main', 'character', 'Gunny', 'Highway', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'friend', 'were', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Korea', 'when', 'Highway', 'won', 'Congressional', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'then', 'joined', 'marines', 'afterwards', 'marine', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'was', 'highly', 'embarrasing', 'try', 'make', 'excuses', 'film', 'when', 'really', 'are', 'none', 'quot', 'Just', 'pretend', 'are', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'enjoy', 'film', 'quot', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'disappointed', 'mc', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'action', 'Grenada', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'vehicle', 'take', 'exploits', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Rangers/Paratroopers', 'falsely', 'portray', 'deeds', 'being', 'done', 'marines', 'quot', 'improvising', 'adapting', 'overcoming', 'quot', 'blame', 'be', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'checking', 'facts', 'screenwriter', 'factual', 'integrity', 'too', 'often', 'people', 'begin', 'believe', 'movies', 'view', 'reality', 'good', 'movie', 'more', 'OK', 'quot', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'quot', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'Highway', 'fight', 'official', 'status', 'quo', 'order', 'get', 'combat-ready', 'twist', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'marines', 'actually', 'helped', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'movie', 'location', 'wrong', 'location', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'California', 'rendering', 'official', 'support', 'film', 'LIE', 'true', 'life', 'good', 'people', 'have', 'quot', 'fight', 'city', 'hall', 'quot', 'usually', 'corrupted', 'bureaucracy', 'character', 'Highway', 'stellar', 'right', 'man', 'playing', 'Highway', 'Eastwood', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'marine', 'recon', 'had', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'pick', 'up', 'newspaper', 'Grenada', 'operation', 'used', '75th', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'protaganists', 'used', 'daring', 'combat', 'jump', 'Point', 'Salines', 'airfield', 'film', 'would', 'resonate', 'reality', 'veterans', 'would', 'welcome', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'subject', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'introducing', 'salty', 'phrases', 'cliches']",N/A

121312,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,0790751186,Steffan Piper,"[2, 3]","I'm a huge fan of this film as I remember seeing it in the theatres and also seeing it on VHS many, many times. This is a film that can either strike you as a 'made for TV movie' or a very serious piece of film about military life that hasn't been this accurate in a long time.The main thing to know about this film is that:1. It has some of the best and most incredibly imaginitive military dialouge ever put on screen.2. There is a strange realism in this film about the true nature of being a human being while also being a soldier that is grossly absent in just about every other war film ever made.I would love to quote some of the dialogue, but Amazon forbids a person from placing expletives in a review. However, maybe I can just bullet point some of the big scenes to watch out for, or listen to when you watch this. It starts:1. Gunny Hiway (Eastwood) is in a jail cell story-telling, surrounded by other convicts, drunks and punk kids. An altercation ensues between Hiway and would-be Motorcycle gangster. Hiway hurts the guy pretty bad and probably hurts his ego more than the man's body.2. After being released from jail by the judge, Gunny Hiway is accosted by the arresting Sherrif. Wow. Classic film dialogue.3. While Sleeping on a Greyhound Bus, Gunny Hiway shares a beer with 'Stitch Jones' (Van Peebles)4. Gunny Hiway meets, haranges and demoralizes his new Recon Platoon all in a fast moving three minutes which is powerful.5. Going to meet his ex-wife at her new job as a waitress in a bar (owned by her new boyfriend), Gunny Hiway gets into a direct altercation with this guy who offers to wrap a wooden bat around his head and Hiway offers to 'bend him over and nail him in the keester' (good grief - it get's gripping right here for sure).6. Meeting his men once more in the early morning before a run and demoralizing them  by name.7. The false deployment scene where Hiway utters the now famous word on film: Clusterf ...8. Any scene where Gunny Hiway and Sgt. Major Choozoo laugh and growl about what they've done. Classic.The strongest aspect of this film is the dialoge and it's no misunderstanding, when you read the script, which I have, why Eastwood not only chose to star in this film but also Produce and Direct it. What's interesting is that when you examine this film and Eastwood's career, one can easily surmise that it was this film that possibly made Eastwood direct more and have a tighter control over his projects ever after. Had he made that decision before hand, this probably would've had the culteral impact of a 'Shawshank Redemption'. A year later though, Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' premiered, supposedly setting the standard. I think it lowered it actually, even though it's an epic and masterful piece of film. It's a subtle point, but an important one. Heartbreak Ridge doesn't romanticize Marine Corps life as badly as many other films out there.While Heartbreak Ridge really is a good film, and not just a good movie (notice I said it's a film and not a movie, which is a big difference) some of the things that really lay waste to it, is obviously the third act, which sends them into action in the historical retelling of Grenada, rather than just honestly documenting military life, which is what the true story of this film is and should've stayed focused on.Some of the characters come across thinly and pretty much the same as some of the others, failing to stand out. Some of Van Peebles scenes in this are honestly unwatchable and cringe-worthy, while some are very gripping. It's inconsistent, and one the first things the viewer notices. 'Stitch Jones' strikes this viewer as an attempt to be a vehicle for Van Peebles to do other movie work, and insincere. Historically, for a short period of time, it seemingly was, as he did a handful of movies directly after this, none of which really stood out -- well, except for the epic New Jack City, but I'm sure he'd disagree completely.Marsha Mason's character 'Aggie' isn't really given her moment to shine in this, but you can almost feel that it's just about to explode across the screen. Unfortunately, we never see this because either it was never written and shot (which I doubt), or it never made it past the editing because of run-time (which I can believe). The relationship between the hardened, aging Marine and the military wife is incredibly touching, very deep and without need of exposition. Eastwood probably never had a woman on screen with him with so much workable chemistry before or after. Just saying. It comes across as a missed opportunity.You can tell that there are musically a few touches of Eastwood in this, but not many. One wonders why such a possibly monumental film just really fell apart, whether it was in the planning, the writing, production, or post-production, we'll never know. Honestly, though, I wish I did. The DVD offers no documentaries, commentary, extras, deleted scenes, nada. A lot of people loathe that stuff, but I eat it up.I really adore this film for the realism that it conveys about military life. Nothing is romanticised, nothing is exaggerated, the uniforms are spec and mannerisms are accurate. I applaud the production people or the military liason to this film and woven into this wonderful film, that unfortunately - and ultimately fails - is an incredibly honest telling of military life. Failed relationships, failed deployments, failed expectations and aspirations, failed careers, failed engagements, all of it.Military life, for a lot of people who go in and serve 2,4 or 8 years, experience this as an indelible transition in their lives that effects them ever after. Gunny Hiway serves as the Boatman through this for both the young men he's entrusted to train, and for us, the observer. You leave this film with much more than you go in with.I actually find this film to be Eastwood's most memorable, as it seems as though his cold stare and gravelly voice were made specifically this film and this film alone....",5,"Be Advised ...

Is it the amount of quotable lines? Is it the transition from one scene you love to the next scene you love to the next to the next, etc. I'm not 100% sure WHY, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've put a lot of thought into it, and I still can't figure it out. Eastwood is there, in his growling, raspy prime, and it has a stroing, albiet odd supporting cast of characters (some who border on caricatures) and a bevy of awesome, repeatable lines. Lets face it...for every person who loved Eastwood in Gran Torino, the character was developed in Gunny Highway. Eastwood is getting up there in years, and I can't think of a single actor I will miss as much when he finally stops acting and directing. He's on top of his game here, and even when the movie dips into farce, it still tugs at your heart in a way that a war/drama/comedy shouldn't. This movie asks a lot of questions...where does a man derive his value? Can an old Marine fit into the modern Corps? Can you reconcile a relationship with time and effort? Ultimately, can people (him, his Recon Unit) change? You may rent Heartbreak Ridge and find none of this, but I do every time I watch it. Rent it if you must, but at least have your money set aside to buy it when you fall in love with the movie.",5,"highly likeable, highly quotable, Eastwood masterpiece",1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,1389,"['How', 'person', 'really', 'determine', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ability', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'amount', 'quotable', 'lines', 'transition', 'one', 'scene', 'love', 'next', 'scene', 'love', 'next', 'next', 'etc', ""'m"", 'not', '100', '%', 'sure', 'WHY', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', ""'ve"", 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'Eastwood', 'there', 'growling', 'raspy', 'prime', 'stroing', 'albiet', 'odd', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'border', 'caricatures', 'bevy', 'awesome', 'repeatable', 'lines', 'face', 'person', 'who', 'loved', 'Eastwood', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'character', 'was', 'developed', 'Gunny', 'Highway', 'Eastwood', 'getting', 'up', 'there', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'actor', 'will', 'miss', 'as', 'much', 'when', 'finally', 'acting', 'directing', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'movie', 'farce', 'still', 'heart', 'way', 'war/drama/comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'movie', 'lot', 'questions', 'where', 'man', 'derive', 'value', 'Can', 'old', 'Marine', 'fit', 'modern', 'Corps', 'Can', 'reconcile', 'relationship', 'time', 'effort', 'Ultimately', 'can', 'people', 'Recon', 'Unit', 'change', 'may', 'rent', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'find', 'none', 'do', 'time', 'watch', 'Rent', 'must', 'least', 'have', 'money', 'set', 'aside', 'buy', 'when', 'fall', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

The plot of the movie...which SHOULD have been pretty easy to have written, given that it was supposed to be based on the Grenada invasion...assumes that we really care about a bunch of smart-mouthed recruits and an arrogant platoon leader's love life.To call this a ""military"" or ""war"" movie is really stretching it. Only at the hour and thirty-five minute mark does the movie take a turn toward some type of military action. But even that ""action"" has the feel of a movie filmed in someone's backyard.All around, one of the worst...if not the worst...military movies ever released, and an insult to those who were involved in Grenada and to all those who ever donned the Marine uniform. Given that this film was released only three years after the Grenada invasion, you'd think it would have still been fresh enough to produce an interesting and accurate movie. This certainly is neither.The transfer...if you just MUST have this dog of a movie...is fine.

121323,AP3B615GM191G,0790751186,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Last year, Clint Eastwood wowed moviegoers with his gritty, realistic performance as Walt ""Get Off My Lawn!"" Kowalski in the film ""Gran Torino"".  In ""Heartbreak Ridge"", the U.S. Marines are the ""lawn"" and Eastwood (once again) isn't taking any prisoners.Basically, the film centers on a Marines Recon unit of the 1980s that, in all aspects, has ""gone soft"" in a time of peace.  Gone is the strict military discipline of the 1940s-1960s, and in its place is a disrespectful, laissez-faire attitude towards fighting for our freedoms.  That all changes, of course, when Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood) is brought in to lead the unit.  Though Highway is only given the assignment as a disciplinary measure, it quickly becomes clear to him how far the Marines have fallen.  No angel himself (Highway is shown instigating a prison riot at the beginning of the film), Highway goes about instilling into a rag-tag bunch of young men the kind of military values that he holds near and dear.Much like ""Gran Torino"", then, the most entertaining portion of this film is watching Eastwood embody that kind of old-world toughness that is on its way out (for better or worse) as the World War II and Korea veterans begin to pass away.  Both Highway and Kowalski are the type of men who will have your back to the end if you respect them and do right by them, but the only way they know how to show it is through harsh profanity, crude jokes, and a crotchety demeanor that belies their true emotions.  Whereas Walt bonds with a young boy who shows potential but just needs some strong leadership in his life, Thomas Highway runs the same emotional gamut with his Marines Unit.There are only a few things that keep this movie from ""instant classic"" status, those being Highway's rather un-interesting love life on the military base, as well as an ending that just seemed to fall a bit flat considering the entertainment that preceded it.  ""Torino"" was a bit more adept (and thus more deserving of a five-star rating) at handling the emotional drama of Eastwood's character, as well as providing a better send-off.Thus, whether you want to look at ""Heartbreak Ridge"" as a prequel to ""Gran Torino"", or ""Torino"" as a sequel to ""Ridge"", the similarities between both films are readily apparent.  If you loved watching Eastwood's gruff, tough Walt Kowalski portrayal, you will love this film as well.  If you were offended by the type of prejudices that Walt held, steer a wide berth around this movie.",4,"Could Easily Be A Prequel To ""Gran Torino""",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2483,"['Last', 'year', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'wowed', 'moviegoers', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'performance', 'Walt', 'Get', 'Off', 'My', 'Lawn', 'Kowalski', 'film', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'U.S.', 'Marines', 'are', 'lawn', 'Eastwood', 'once', 'again', ""n't"", 'taking', 'prisoners.Basically', 'film', 'centers', 'Marines', 'Recon', 'unit', '1980s', 'aspects', 'gone', 'soft', 'time', 'peace', 'Gone', 'strict', 'military', 'discipline', '1940s-1960s', 'place', 'disrespectful', 'laissez-faire', 'attitude', 'towards', 'fighting', 'freedoms', 'changes', 'course', 'when', 'Sergeant', 'Thomas', 'Highway', 'Eastwood', 'brought', 'lead', 'unit', 'Highway', 'only', 'given', 'assignment', 'disciplinary', 'measure', 'quickly', 'clear', 'how', 'far', 'Marines', 'have', 'fallen', 'angel', 'Highway', 'shown', 'instigating', 'prison', 'riot', 'beginning', 'film', 'Highway', 'instilling', 'rag-tag', 'bunch', 'young', 'men', 'kind', 'military', 'values', 'dear.Much', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'then', 'most', 'entertaining', 'portion', 'film', 'watching', 'Eastwood', 'embody', 'kind', 'old-world', 'toughness', 'way', 'better', 'worse', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Korea', 'veterans', 'begin', 'pass', 'away', 'Highway', 'Kowalski', 'are', 'type', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'back', 'end', 'respect', 'do', 'right', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'show', 'harsh', 'profanity', 'crude', 'jokes', 'crotchety', 'demeanor', 'true', 'emotions', 'Whereas', 'Walt', 'bonds', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'potential', 'just', 'strong', 'leadership', 'life', 'Thomas', 'Highway', 'same', 'emotional', 'gamut', 'Marines', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'keep', 'movie', 'instant', 'classic', 'status', 'being', 'Highway', 'rather', 'un-interesting', 'love', 'life', 'military', 'base', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'just', 'seemed', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'considering', 'entertainment', 'preceded', 'Torino', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'adept', 'thus', 'more', 'deserving', 'five-star', 'rating', 'handling', 'emotional', 'drama', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'better', 'send-off.Thus', 'want', 'look', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'prequel', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Torino', 'sequel', 'Ridge', 'similarities', 'films', 'are', 'readily', 'apparent', 'loved', 'watching', 'Eastwood', 'gruff', 'tough', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'portrayal', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'offended', 'type', 'prejudices', 'Walt', 'held', 'steer', 'wide', 'berth', 'movie']",N/A
