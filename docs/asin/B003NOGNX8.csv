Based on that alone, I can highly recommend this video. After the initial 8mm footage of the drive with Mama Cass, I wasn't expecting much, but this feature delivered.Another reviewer hit the nail on the head regarding the latter portion of the video, however--it being all CSN-centric. That said, I learned some things, and appreciated both Graham Nash's sensitivity and intelligence. He's quite a spokesperson!There were MANY more individual stars and groups to emerge from Laurel Canyon than is presented herein, however, and that's the only place where this production comes up short.To help complete the story, I recommend viewingAtlantic Records: The House That Ahmet Built, about Ahmet Ertegen and his Atlantic Records. There is also aThe Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegunthat was just released last year. The other production that helps with this story is PBS' American Masters installment regarding David Geffen (the subject of Joni Mitchell's Free Man In Paris).

1355882,AC0C4R4RK1WP7,B003NOGNX8,"Jim Stalker ""Jim Stalker""","[10, 11]","LA's Laurel Canyon music scene has been well documented through a variety books and movies. Laurel Canyon was where Miss Pamala found her super-groupie training wheels trying to shag Byrd Chris Hillman. Every LA music history has a chapter (or more) devoted to the goings on in this 'Eden above Sunset."" This now almost-mythic place was where Frank Zappa was regualarly providing a place to crash and David Geffen was getting knotted up with business before becoming a Free Man in Paris (and billionare in the process).Canyon of Dreams by Harvey Kubernick is the best book on this topic. Kubernic provides some well researched context (and photographs) for how and why the canyon developed into the So Cal hippie epicenter it became. From the red cars to beatniks, to the pothead hippies and then the mainstream - it is quite a story. One that is distinctly LA. All captured quite well in Dreams.Haight Ashby had the Dead, and LA had the Monkees. SF had Janis and Grace Slick and LA had Mama Cass and Van Dyke Parks.  Major contrasts. In Laurel Canyon Joni Mitchell's house had ""two cats in the yard."" Graham Nash met Crosby and Stills for the first time. John Lennon walked around with a Kotex on his head. It was all happening, at least for a time, in Laurel Canyon.It would have been great to have burned a few doobies with some of those musicians who had to ""work"" down the hill at the Roxy or Troubadour - ending the evening at Barney's Beanery. It really was quite a scene, and before everyone got spooked by the Manson family, the Canyon was a bit of nirvana where hitchhikers could get a ride and pot was everywhere. Music was everywhere. This was before the coked out success-excess-ed-stressed artists became robotic hit-makers who made the break to clam down in Malibu (after detox).Legends of the Canyon - a new DVD from Classic Aritists captures some of this time with a documentary featuring a narrative spun primarily by rock photographer Henry Diltz. Dlitz seemed to be at the center of it snapping pictures of everyone en route to his over 80 album cover photos. Clearly he was there, is articulate, and has perspective that isn't overly hyperbolic. Diltz is the kind of hippie you wish was your neighbor today. Someone loaded with stories and whose brownies need consideration before ingestion.Legends of the Canyon offers some unfamiliar vintage video footage along with photo montages of some more familiar pictures. The talking heads do a good job of at the zeitgeist of the Canyon. The only problem is the narrative focus gets a bit lost and the film forgets it is about about the Canyon, not just the history of Crosby, Still, Nash & Young.Anyone who has read Michael Walker's Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-and-Roll's Legendary Neighborhood or Barney Hoskyn's Waiting for the Sun: A Rock and Roll History of Los Angeles  knows there is a lot of great stories and details missing from this earnest documentary (a common problem with any documentary BTW). Almost all of what is there is interesting.Legends of the Canyon, while not brilliant, succeeds at  conveying the magic that was at the Brill Building of the Southern California music scene, Laurel Canyon, which fittingly for LA was up in the mountains.",4,The best video doc on this facinating topic....,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,3240,"['LA', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'music', 'scene', 'been', 'well', 'documented', 'variety', 'books', 'movies', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'was', 'where', 'Miss', 'Pamala', 'found', 'super-groupie', 'training', 'wheels', 'trying', 'shag', 'Byrd', 'Chris', 'Hillman', 'Every', 'LA', 'music', 'history', 'chapter', 'more', 'devoted', 'goings', ""'Eden"", 'Sunset', 'now', 'almost-mythic', 'place', 'was', 'where', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'was', 'regualarly', 'providing', 'place', 'crash', 'David', 'Geffen', 'was', 'getting', 'knotted', 'up', 'business', 'becoming', 'Free', 'Man', 'Paris', 'billionare', 'process', '.Canyon', 'Dreams', 'Harvey', 'Kubernick', 'best', 'book', 'topic', 'Kubernic', 'well', 'researched', 'context', 'photographs', 'how', 'why', 'canyon', 'developed', 'So', 'Cal', 'hippie', 'epicenter', 'became', 'red', 'cars', 'beatniks', 'pothead', 'hippies', 'then', 'mainstream', 'quite', 'story', 'One', 'distinctly', 'LA', 'captured', 'quite', 'well', 'Dreams.Haight', 'Ashby', 'had', 'Dead', 'LA', 'had', 'Monkees', 'SF', 'had', 'Janis', 'Grace', 'Slick', 'LA', 'had', 'Mama', 'Cass', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Parks', 'Major', 'contrasts', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'house', 'had', 'two', 'cats', 'yard', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'met', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'first', 'time', 'John', 'Lennon', 'walked', 'Kotex', 'head', 'was', 'happening', 'least', 'time', 'Laurel', 'Canyon.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'burned', 'few', 'doobies', 'musicians', 'who', 'had', 'work', 'hill', 'Roxy', 'Troubadour', 'ending', 'evening', 'Barney', 'Beanery', 'really', 'was', 'quite', 'scene', 'everyone', 'got', 'spooked', 'Manson', 'family', 'Canyon', 'was', 'bit', 'nirvana', 'where', 'hitchhikers', 'could', 'get', 'ride', 'pot', 'was', 'everywhere', 'Music', 'was', 'everywhere', 'was', 'coked', 'success-excess-ed-stressed', 'artists', 'became', 'robotic', 'hit-makers', 'who', 'made', 'break', 'clam', 'down', 'Malibu', 'detox', 'Canyon', 'new', 'DVD', 'Classic', 'Aritists', 'time', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'narrative', 'spun', 'primarily', 'rock', 'photographer', 'Henry', 'Diltz', 'Dlitz', 'seemed', 'be', 'center', 'snapping', 'pictures', 'everyone', 'en', 'route', '80', 'album', 'cover', 'photos', 'Clearly', 'was', 'there', 'articulate', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'overly', 'hyperbolic', 'Diltz', 'kind', 'hippie', 'wish', 'was', 'neighbor', 'today', 'Someone', 'loaded', 'stories', 'brownies', 'need', 'consideration', 'ingestion.Legends', 'Canyon', 'unfamiliar', 'vintage', 'video', 'footage', 'photo', 'montages', 'more', 'familiar', 'pictures', 'talking', 'heads', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'zeitgeist', 'Canyon', 'only', 'problem', 'narrative', 'focus', 'bit', 'lost', 'film', 'Canyon', 'not', 'just', 'history', 'Crosby', 'Still', 'Nash', 'Young.Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Michael', 'Walker', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'Inside', 'Story', 'Rock-and-Roll', 'Legendary', 'Neighborhood', 'Barney', 'Hoskyn', 'Waiting', 'Sun', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'History', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'lot', 'great', 'stories', 'details', 'missing', 'earnest', 'documentary', 'common', 'problem', 'documentary', 'BTW', 'Almost', 'what', 'interesting.Legends', 'Canyon', 'not', 'brilliant', 'conveying', 'magic', 'was', 'Brill', 'Building', 'Southern', 'California', 'music', 'scene', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'fittingly', 'LA', 'was', 'up', 'mountains']",N/A
1355883,AFE0AGQT50MBJ,B003NOGNX8,KV Trout,"[6, 6]","I enjoyed watching this but it has some problems:1) The cover and title makes you think it's going to go into the history of all these groups but it barely touches on the Byrds, Mamas and Papas and Joni Mitchell.I'd say the percentage is about 75% Crosby Stills and Nash and the other 25% is divided between all the others.2) For whatever reason they did not give Neil Young his say (or he refused to participate?) even though the implication from the others is that he ruined CS&N; by being egotistic and wanting to do his own thing and not being a ""team player"". I feel that even if this is ""true"", he should have had a chance to give his thoughts.3) This goes back to 1) but there were no interviews with Joni Mitchell, Roger McGuinn, or other L.A. musicians - it was all about CS&N;4) the documentary just was not directed or edited that well. If you watch Joni Mitchell ""A Woman of Heart and Mind"" you can see how great this documentary COULD have been, had they interviewed more of the main players and put a little more production value into it. Where was Jackson Browne? Roger McGuinn? Joni?Okay, those are the reasons this gets only 4 stars (and in reality I'd have probably given it only 3 and 1/2 if I could have).The good:Very interesting stuff about Crosby Stills Nash (and sometimes Y). I learned a lot about how they got together and how they worked together. The interviews with those people were great to hear!The verbal history from Diltz about who lived in the canyon at that time and how they all interacted was interesting as well - I just wish they'd have had some interviews with some of the principles.All in all if you're a classic rock fan and love CS&N; and sometimes Y then this is well worth renting or buying. If, however, you are looking for an overview of the L.A. sound, well then you'll have to wait for someone to make one, and hopefully they will before McGuinn, Joni and others kick the bucket. While it was a different sound, I still think it's hard to mention L.A. and not talk about the Doors. At least there are some good dvd's about the Doors out there.This is good but I wouldn't buy it.

Adding color and texture, rock photographer Henry Diltz contributes photographs, some never before exhibited as well as rare (albeit silent 8mm) footage of the musicians that made up the tribe of the Canyon.This film captures a magical -- perhaps naive -- time of hope that seems so distant and foreign it might as well be fiction.Funky bonus features include: Henry Diltz's original 8mm footage, a fan's bootleg footage from Oklahoma City ""Stills Tour,"" extended Interviews, the Naming Of ""Buffalo Springfield,"" Henry Diltz's acid trip and photo Galleries.",3,3 STARS FOR EVOKING THE ERA,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,1081,"['late', '60s', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Byrds', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'Buffalo', 'Springfield', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'other', 'musicians', 'era', 'lived', 'Laurel', 'Canyon.This', 'elite', 'community', 'harmony', 'created', 'history-changing', 'music', 'echoed', 'world', 'LEGENDS', 'THE', 'CANYON', 'engaging', 'documentary', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'intimacy', 'creative', 'life', 'legendary', 'canyon', 'hidden', 'Hollywood', 'hills.True', 'tales', 'times', 'are', 'shared', 'interviews', 'many', 'artist', 'Adding', 'color', 'texture', 'rock', 'photographer', 'Henry', 'Diltz', 'photographs', 'never', 'before', 'exhibited', 'as', 'well', 'rare', 'albeit', 'silent', '8mm', 'footage', 'musicians', 'made', 'up', 'tribe', 'Canyon.This', 'film', 'magical', 'perhaps', 'naive', 'time', 'hope', 'so', 'distant', 'foreign', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'fiction.Funky', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'Henry', 'Diltz', 'original', '8mm', 'footage', 'fan', 'bootleg', 'footage', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'Stills', 'Tour', 'extended', 'Interviews', 'Naming', 'Buffalo', 'Springfield', 'Henry', 'Diltz', 'acid', 'trip', 'photo', 'Galleries']",N/A

She says this to exaggerate our age differences, and to point out that we are from different generations, as if we were decades apart (As a point of fact, she was born six years, nine months and seven days after me, but who's counting?). In a sense, I can understand her point, because a lot happened in those six-plus years. For example, I can remember Beatlemania, but she wasn't born until after ""Help!"" was released. Although I was much too young to be a hippie, I identified with the youth movement, especially the music, while her point of reference usually dates back no further than the Clash. I may have only been seven years old during the `Summer of Love', but that didn't stop me from buying love beads and bell-bottom jeans (My Dad made me return the love beads). That is why I anticipated watching ""The Legends of Laurel Canyon,"" while she remained skeptical.As it turns out, I am very happy to report that she enjoyed this documentary as much as I did. For me, it reaffirmed my love for what I already knew, but for her, it was revelatory. The story begins with theories regarding how the circumstances surrounding the Kennedy assassination led the youth of the time to become skeptical of the older generation, and provided the impetus for Beatlemania as a means of rejecting the status quo. By leading us through Dylan's influence on folk music, it follows Stephen Stills and a few other key players as they settle in Laurel Canyon and form bands that emulated both the Beatles and Dylan. The Byrds and Buffalo Springfield were first, and a scene developed around clubs like the Whiskey a Go-Go and the Troubadour. Along the way, we meet the Mamas and the Papas, Joni Mitchell and others, and through their collective work, we discover a generation defined by its pursuit of intelligence, self-awareness, curiosity and sensuality.Before I go too much further, I should point out that this documentary could be subtitled ""Stephen Stills and his Influence on the California Culture of the Sixties."" Stills is by far the primary focus of this story, and it is his music that provides much of the soundtrack. The footage covering the birth of Crosby, Stills and Nash is revelatory and beautiful, covering details that I had not previously known. It also allows the story to move smoothly from the highs of Woodstock, to the subsequent lows of the Manson murders and the Kent Sate shootings.Back then, there was a phrase about never trusting anyone over thirty. Now that I'm 51, I have a different perspective on that axiom. I still identify strongly with this music, as if it were frozen in amber while I continued to age. In a sense, that is true, and happily, I believe the same is now true for my wife. Maybe I've become entirely too old, but I'd prefer to think that our time has come, and this music lives on in the spirit of all the people who experienced it firsthand when it happened, as well as those who are just now discovering its essence. As I reread this paragraph, I recognize that I need to confess to something after all: OK, so I'm a hippie.A  Tom Ryan",5,One of the Best Docs of Its Kind I've Seen,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,3180,"['wife', 'who', 'younger', 'am', 'music', 'fan', 'am', 'sometimes', 'refers', 'hippie', 'exaggerate', 'age', 'differences', 'point', 'out', 'are', 'different', 'generations', 'were', 'decades', 'apart', 'point', 'fact', 'was', 'born', 'six', 'years', 'nine', 'months', 'seven', 'days', 'who', 'counting', 'sense', 'can', 'understand', 'point', 'lot', 'happened', 'six-plus', 'years', 'example', 'can', 'remember', 'Beatlemania', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', 'Help', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'hippie', 'identified', 'youth', 'movement', 'especially', 'music', 'point', 'reference', 'usually', 'back', 'further', 'Clash', 'may', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'Summer', 'Love', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'buying', 'love', 'beads', 'bell-bottom', 'jeans', 'Dad', 'made', 'return', 'love', 'beads', 'why', 'anticipated', 'watching', 'Legends', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'remained', 'skeptical.As', 'out', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'report', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'reaffirmed', 'love', 'what', 'already', 'knew', 'was', 'revelatory', 'story', 'theories', 'regarding', 'how', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'led', 'youth', 'time', 'become', 'skeptical', 'older', 'generation', 'provided', 'impetus', 'Beatlemania', 'means', 'rejecting', 'status', 'quo', 'leading', 'Dylan', 'influence', 'folk', 'music', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'few', 'other', 'key', 'players', 'settle', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'form', 'bands', 'emulated', 'Beatles', 'Dylan', 'Byrds', 'Buffalo', 'Springfield', 'were', 'first', 'scene', 'developed', 'clubs', 'Whiskey', 'Go-Go', 'Troubadour', 'way', 'meet', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'others', 'collective', 'work', 'discover', 'generation', 'defined', 'pursuit', 'intelligence', 'self-awareness', 'curiosity', 'sensuality.Before', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'further', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', 'subtitled', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'Influence', 'California', 'Culture', 'Sixties', 'Stills', 'far', 'primary', 'focus', 'story', 'music', 'much', 'soundtrack', 'footage', 'covering', 'birth', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'revelatory', 'beautiful', 'covering', 'details', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'known', 'also', 'story', 'move', 'smoothly', 'highs', 'Woodstock', 'subsequent', 'lows', 'Manson', 'murders', 'Kent', 'Sate', 'shootings.Back', 'then', 'was', 'phrase', 'never', 'trusting', 'anyone', 'thirty', 'Now', ""'m"", '51', 'have', 'different', 'perspective', 'axiom', 'still', 'identify', 'strongly', 'music', 'were', 'frozen', 'amber', 'continued', 'age', 'sense', 'true', 'happily', 'believe', 'same', 'now', 'true', 'wife', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'become', 'entirely', 'too', 'old', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'think', 'time', 'come', 'music', 'spirit', 'people', 'who', 'experienced', 'when', 'happened', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'discovering', 'essence', 'reread', 'paragraph', 'recognize', 'need', 'confess', 'something', 'OK', ""'m"", 'hippie.A', 'Tom', 'Ryan']",N/A
