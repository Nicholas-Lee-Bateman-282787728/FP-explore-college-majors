But MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE is one of the few stand-outs.  This movie is good old fashion horror fun.  And the new re-mastered VHS looks and sounds great.  What makes this movie worth while is a cast of colorful, if not stereotypical, characters.  The performers do their best to have fun with the story and play along with the situation, no matter how outrageous it gets.  What is remarkable, is the creepy atmosphere.  The motel itself is a run-down spooky old place hidden in the woods.  It really does add a whole dimension to the movie.  And some of the set-pieces, such as an underground tunnel that travels beneath the motel rooms, make for some great moments.  Evelyn Chambers, our star and serial killer, is one hell of a nut job, and the actress who plays her does a great job of having fun with the role.

The movie feels very inconclusive and from the beggining you never get a good idea of what the hell the daughter is about anyway.  Except for maybe that she is obviously practicing witchcraft of some sort. The old woman who does all the killing is just not bizarre enough for my tastes.  She should have been a real freak.

573985,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000059PPE,Sid the Elf,"[0, 2]","As Halloween draws near we have been working hard to round up as many horror films as possible within our spare time. Ideally when choosing your Octoberfest horror flicks you want to mix it between creature features, classics, laughable B's, and slashers. In hopes to meet our slasher quota we decided to pick a lesser known movie entitled Mountaintop Motel Massacre. Sure it looks absolutely absurd, but was certainly worth a shot. The crazy grandma on the cover was intriguing enough making one say ""this woman is totally insane,"" thus giving you a sense of some possible redeemable quality. However there was none. Please understand that the elf loves horrible B movies, but they need to have something going on in the laugh department. Sure there were a few laughs from time to time, but most came in between trying to keep your eyes opened from sheer boredom. The use of this crazy woman was so poorly done that not one scare or creepy moment was anywhere to be found. Seriously is you have a deranged old lady you have to explore the studio space. Just me, my old lady, and the road.Ok here goes the plot. Evelyn is a completely whacked out old lady who has spent the better portion of her golden years in an insane asylum. Once she's released on good behavior she resumes her role as master of the house at her dump the Mountaintop Motel. While tending to the garden she starts to dip into her old realm of insanity with her sickle in hand. She then finds her daughter trying to speak to her dead father and flips her bill. This old bat goes totally nuts and gets a bit carried away with the sickle. While swinging her arms around in a total hissy fit she winds up slicing her daughters face up leaving her dead. Now she really gets crazy and continues her tirade by killing off her hotel residents. She does this by some trap doors set up throughout the motels basement. That's pretty much the meat of this nightmare of a movie. In between the killings is a heavy dose of lame boring dialogue that will leave you near sleep.Obviously in no way were we a fan of Mountaintop Motel Massacre despite going in with minimal expectations. Honestly it could have been decent if they kept the tempo up and got a little more creative with the old lady. A couple bright spots were the old fat drunk pastor and the guy that looks like Danny Tanner with a mustache. Danny Tanners brother is a total perv that understands with great mustache comes great responsibility, and is also a man responsible of awarding the film a DMF of 1. Yeah see the DMF is back baby! And it's in full rotation. Odds are you will never find this movie on t.v at anytime, even at 1 am when they run Death Ring. So in order to watch this you actually have to make an effort which we plead with you not to make. Instead of wasting an hour and a half of your time just read the review instead of watching. Even Wicked Games grab this movie by the shoulders and yells ""you were, you were a bad girl!"" This will surely get a patented Loomis of ""He's gone, the evil's gone from here"" while dumping it back into the mailbox.",1,Who's the old lady?
