But the story is good, managing to be both patriotic and cynical, until a limp ending.John Wayne battles Loyalist George Sanders and corrupt trader Brian Donlevy, who is selling arms to Indians, under the *protection* of Sanders. So Duke does what Duke does so well, busting up the shipment and seeing that the values of Western Civilization prevail. Then the movie ends not with a shootout or tomahawk battle, but rather with well-acted yet shallow courtroom intrigue. Sigh.Still, another thing that makes this movie better than the plot might otherwise allow is the charismatic Claire Trevor, beautiful even in what is basically a throwaway tomboy role. Let&#8217;s call her the Duchess, at least for the purposes of this movie; not because she was in very many notable westerns or had any particular tie to the Duke, but because she was such a consummate performer that she could hold her own in a scene with him, as she did in Stagecoach.Another point this film serves to illustrate is how even programmers like this one had better scripts than most anything produced today. Despite the lopsided story, it is evident that great care was given to the dialogue, and much devotion given to performances.In summation: Generally more entertaining than Drums Along the Mohawk; not better, mind you, just more entertaining.",3,A good cast buoys this Eastern Western.,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,1434,"['enjoyable', 'movie', 'set', 'Colonial', 'America', 'fresher', 'reason', 'maybe', 'really', 'story', 'good', 'managing', 'be', 'patriotic', 'cynical', 'limp', 'ending.John', 'Wayne', 'Loyalist', 'George', 'Sanders', 'corrupt', 'trader', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'who', 'selling', 'arms', 'Indians', '*protection*', 'Sanders', 'So', 'Duke', 'what', 'Duke', 'so', 'well', 'busting', 'up', 'shipment', 'seeing', 'values', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'prevail', 'Then', 'movie', 'not', 'shootout', 'tomahawk', 'battle', 'rather', 'well-acted', 'yet', 'shallow', 'courtroom', 'intrigue', 'Sigh.Still', 'thing', 'movie', 'better', 'plot', 'might', 'otherwise', 'allow', 'charismatic', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'beautiful', 'even', 'what', 'basically', 'throwaway', 'tomboy', 'role', 'Let', '8217', 'call', 'Duchess', 'least', 'purposes', 'movie', 'not', 'was', 'very', 'many', 'notable', 'westerns', 'had', 'particular', 'tie', 'Duke', 'was', 'such', 'consummate', 'performer', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'scene', 'did', 'Stagecoach.Another', 'point', 'film', 'illustrate', 'how', 'even', 'programmers', 'one', 'had', 'better', 'scripts', 'most', 'anything', 'produced', 'today', 'lopsided', 'story', 'evident', 'great', 'care', 'was', 'given', 'dialogue', 'much', 'devotion', 'given', 'performances.In', 'summation', 'Generally', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'not', 'better', 'mind', 'just', 'more', 'entertaining']",N/A

Wayne himself--who that same year had teamed with Trevor inStagecoach, the movie that made him a star after a decade in B's--plays a young frontiersman who spearheads a sort of armed protest against the British in 1759, when Western Pennsylvania was the ""far West.""  His grievance isn't taxes or ""quartering,"" but the apparent inability of the Redcoats to prevent smugglers from trading with the hostile Indians, and most particularly from providing them with guns, powder, and shot.  Balked by the aristocratic and scornful Capt. Swanson (George Sanders), and supported by Magistrate Duncan (Robert Barrat), he and his neighbors in the Conococheague Valley (a river of that name does exist in Pennsylvania) struggle to balk the sinister Indian trader Ralph Callendar (perennial film villain Brian Donlevy) and eventually find themselves forced to besiege and occupy the local British fort.  Wilfrid Lawson as Trevor's father ""Mac"" MacDougall, a supposed tavernkeeper who spends most of his time haunting the forests, provides both support and comic relief, and John F. Hamilton, Moroni Olsen, Eddie Quillan, and a young (and slim!) Chill Wills appear as Jim's neighbors.

249700,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,630132546X,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","The film stars Claire Trevor and John Wayne with George Sanders, Brian Donlevy, Wilfred Lawson,  Chill W ills, Robert Barrat, and Eddie Quillan. Prolific William Seiter directed for RKO. The film is based on a 1937 book ""The First Rebel"" that was taken from historical events between 1765 and 1769 called ""The Black Boy Rebellion"" because the rebels blackened their faces.Claire Trevor (1910-2000) was dubbed the ""Queen of film noir"" because of her roles in films like ""Street of Chance"" (1942), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944), and ""Born to Kill"" (1947), but in fact she had quite a varied career in multiple genres and was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Dead End"", ""Key Largo"", ""The High and the Mighty"") and an Emmy 2 times (1950, 1954). She made more than 50 films before transitioning to TV in the 50s. I liked her best in ""The High and the Mighty"", one of 4 films she did with John Wayne (the others being ""Dark Command"" and ""Stagecoach""). Trevor plays a tomboy who is in love with Wayne.John Wayne plays Jim Smith, the head of the Rebellion. Wayne was a bankable box office draw at the time. He'd made over 80 films by 1939, although most of them had been forgettable B westerns.  Then in 1939 he made ""Stagecoach"" with John Ford, and his new career as a major star began.  Stagecoach earned 5 Oscars including Best Picture. Wayne followed up with  ""Dark Command"" (1940) directed by Rail Walsh, and  then a series of war movies (e.g.,  ""Flying Tigers"" in 1942, ""The Fighting Seabees""  in 1944, ""Back to Bataan"" and ""They Were Expendable"" in 1945) and his classic westerns including ""3 Godfathers"" (1948),  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949, ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), and ""The Alamo"" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and he would finally earn an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969).Suave George Sanders (1906-1972) appeared in hundreds of films, often as a villain. He's best remembered as film critic Addison DeWitt in ""All About Eve"" (1950) for which he won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Sanders plays a British Captain assigned to quell the rebellion.Brian Donlevy (1901-72) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1939's ""Beau Geste"" as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff (Thomas Mitchell won for ""Stagecoach""). He appeared in almost 100 films between 1923 and 1969, but his busiest period was the 40s when he did more than 30 films including ""Command Decision"" (1948), ""The Virginian"" (1946), ""Two Years Before the Mast"" (1946), ""Hangmen Also Die"" (1943), and ""Billy the Kid"" (1941). Donlevy was almost always a villain, as he is in this film.Robert Barrat (1889-1970) plays a magistrate. He appeared in more than 100 films. He did 7 films with Jimmy Cagney  and appeared in such classics as ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (1937), ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Union Pacific"" (1939), and ""They Were Expendable"" (1945). He's best remembered for his role as Chingachgook in ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1939).Chill Wills (1902-78) appeared in over 100 films, usually as the grizzled sidekick and occasional comic foil. He's best remember for his Oscar nominated role as Beekeeper in John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" (1960), but he also put in memorable performances as Uncle Bawley in ""Giant"" (1956) and the storekeeper in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973). He plays one of Smith's black boys.William Seiter (1890-1964) directed more than 100 films between 1915 and 1954 when he transitioned to TV where he directed ""The Gale Storm Show"" (1956-60). His strength was in comedy and he worked with Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, and the Ritz Brothers. This was one of his few ventures into Westerns and you can see he has some problems with in, and his attempts to put humor into the film don't always work.Coming in 1939 when so many excellent films were produced ""Allegheny Uprising"" had little chance. In addition, one week before it came out John Ford's ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" appeared, and this was a far better film.  Moreover, 1939 was not a year to be releasing a film that was critical of the British, as WW 2 had just started.Another problem with the film is that the script was altered to increase Trevor's role, as she was the bigger star (she is top billed!) and the two had just appeared in ""Stagecoach"". As such, her presence seems forced rather than a natural part of the story, which was essentially an adventure. Moreover, despite her considereable acting skills, Trevor at age 29 seems to be a little too full bloom to be the ""tomboy"" she portrays.Another problem is that the California scenes do not match the lush valleys of Pennsylvania, although cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca (1892-1975) did his best. Musuraca was known as ""the painter with light"" and credited with the RKO look in the 40s. He lensed more than 100 films before transitioning to TV in the mid 50s. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""I Remember Mama"" (1948).When judged by the production values of John Ford westerns, this RKO film seems lacking. But you have to remember than in 1939 most of the westerns were truly B westerns, so by that standard this was a B+ film.There are pitifully few films set in pre revolutionary times. Among the best are the Michael Mann version of ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) and Spencer Tracey's ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) as well as ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939).All things considered this is a good B western, but definitely a B. Wayne himself called it ""an awful stinker"" but I don't think it's that bad, and certainly no worse than the 80+ other B westerns he made. At least he doesn't sing and he doesn't play second fiddle to a trick horse. Yet, from this time period you can watch ""Stagecoach"" which is an A western or see the Duke in ""Dark Command"" (1940) or ""Shepherd of the Hills"" (1941) in which he does a far better acting job.",2,Another B western,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,5864,"['film', 'stars', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'John', 'Wayne', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'Wilfred', 'Lawson', 'Chill', 'W', 'ills',

249708,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,630132546X,Only-A-Child,"[6, 14]","John Wayne had been making low budget movies for almost 15 years when he starred with Claire Trevor in the William Seiter directed ""Allegheny Uprising"". He must have felt his career was going backwards as the production values here are second rate even by the marginal standards of his earlier films. Cast before the release of ""Stagecoach"", he and Trevor were given a more central role in ""Allegheny Uprising"" as it is not an ensemble piece like ""Stagecoach"".The new popularity of the two B-Movie actors required P. J. Wolfson to alter his adaptation of Neil Swanson's novel ""The First Rebel"". In place of his straight historical fiction action-adventure tale (based on the Smith's Rebellion and Fort Loudoun in southern Pennsylvania) Wolfson was forced to add a romance and pad Trevor's role. Unfortunately adapting a novel to the screen is difficult enough without having to insert a character utterly irrelevant to a story already too expansive for easy adaptation. Contemporary viewers will find the forced insertion of Trevor into most of the scenes rather puzzling, at least in part because she has little going for herself as an actress or a screen presence. The younger John Wayne was much better when paired with talented leading ladies like Ella Raines and Cecilia Parker.Set in Pennsylvania's Conococheague Valley in 1759, Wayne plays title character James Smith who returns to the valley with a friend called The Professor (John Frank Hamilton). They find the local British commander (George Sanders) a martinet and a local civilian (Brian Donley) trading contraband goods (whiskey and weapons) with the Indians, in league with some corrupt soldiers.Trevor plays Janie MacDougall, a loud tomboy who loves Smith and manages to insert herself into his affairs at every turn.1939 was not a good time for a movie which portrayed our soon to be allies (insert the British here) as stupid and corrupt. And southern California was not a good location for shooting a film about colonial America. There are far too many shots of grassy, almost treeless, California valleys to maintain the necessary geographical illusion. Also jarring is the contemporary dialogue which leaves you expecting Mickey Rooney and Lewis Stone to pull up outside the fort in the family sedan.When not painful, the inattention to period detail is unintentionally amusing. My favorite scene involves the British soldiers laughing at the idea of the settlers taking over the fort. It will remind you of the ""Robin Huck"" episode of ""Huckleberry Hound"" where he exhorts his merry men to ""yuk it up a bit"" and they respond by going ""yuk, yuk, yuk"".All in all, a weak example of the B-movie product.Then again, what do I know?

In 1760 after three years in captivity by an Indian tribe, James Smith and his friend, the Professor, return home to find several tribes on the warpath.  These Indians have been supplied with muskets, shot and powder, and tomahawks by a trader looking to make it big.  Smith and his neighbors must figure out how to stop the traders before they too are attacked, all the while dealing with the British command nearby who thinks Smith and Co. want to destroy British goods.  This isn't a great movie, but it's an exciting movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon.  It's fun to see a movie set in the colonies before the Revolution, a period often ignored in movies.Teaming up again, Claire Trevor, with top billing, and John Wayne lead the cast.  Trevor is Janie MacDougall, a tomboy who's loved James Smith as long as she can remember and isn't about to let him slip away a second time.  Wayne plays Smith, the tough leader of his valley trying to protect the community.  The parts aren't as good as in Stagecoach, but the two still have good chemistry.  George Sanders is very good as Captain Swanson, the commander of the British troops in the valley trying to figure out exactly what's going on.  Brian Donlevy is excellent as Callendar, the trader selling guns and whiskey to the Indians, an evil bad guy role he played many times.  The supporting cast includes Wilfrid Lawson as Mac, Janie's father who loves drinking and fighting, and John Hamilton as the Professor, Smith's friend who does all the talking.  Also look out for a young Chill Wills as one of Smith's friends, that voice is instantly recognizable.The DVD is a good buy although there's some odd features added.  The movie is shown in a good-looking standard presentation, really nice considering it's 80 years old.  The features include a 16-minute live action short film about the Bill of Rights and a WB cartoon, a ""Merry Melodies,"" that's got nothing to do with the movie or the storyline.
