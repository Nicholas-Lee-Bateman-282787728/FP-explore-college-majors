1496872,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B005OUJRKK,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[1, 1]","""Make Believe"" is a surprisingly entertaining documentary covering the quest of young magicians competing to become the Teen World Champion at the World Magic Seminar in Las Vegas. This is a look at some of the most talented of the contestants before, during, and after the competition. There is a subculture for almost everything and this documentary shows that the magician culture is very much alive and active.I enjoyed seeing how the kids balanced their daily lives with the demands of preparing for the competition. These are very dedicated and determined performers that literally spend hours a day practicing and refining their acts. The filmmakers did a great job capturing the emotions and sense of anticipation in the days leading up to the event.It is easy to forget how young these magicians are when you see the first rate magic they perform. It is also easy to forget that they are competing for a title that will help propel their magic careers and land them on TV specials if they win. Which leads to the only part of the documentary that I found somewhat distasteful, it involves an older woman ""has-been"" that encourages a girl contestant to flaunt her body and uses a crude term that has no place in what would have otherwise been a kid friendly family video.The ""Extra Features"" include a deeper look at the young contestants lives and a collection of instructional magic tricks, ranging from simple to amazingly difficult, that you can learn by watching the video.This was an entertaining and informative look into a world I didn't even know existed.Recommended!CFHNote: Review copy provided by manufacturer",4,An Interesting and Entertaining Look Into The World of Teen Magicians - Recommended,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1629,"['Make', 'Believe', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'covering', 'quest', 'young', 'magicians', 'competing', 'become', 'Teen', 'World', 'Champion', 'World', 'Magic', 'Seminar', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'look', 'most', 'talented', 'contestants', 'competition', 'subculture', 'almost', 'everything', 'documentary', 'magician', 'culture', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'active.I', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'how', 'kids', 'balanced', 'daily', 'lives', 'demands', 'preparing', 'competition', 'are', 'very', 'dedicated', 'determined', 'performers', 'literally', 'spend', 'hours', 'day', 'practicing', 'refining', 'acts', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'emotions', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'event.It', 'easy', 'forget', 'how', 'young', 'magicians', 'are', 'when', 'see', 'first', 'rate', 'magic', 'perform', 'also', 'easy', 'forget', 'are', 'competing', 'title', 'will', 'help', 'propel', 'magic', 'careers', 'land', 'TV', 'specials', 'win', 'Which', 'only', 'part', 'documentary', 'found', 'somewhat', 'distasteful', 'older', 'woman', 'has-been', 'girl', 'contestant', 'flaunt', 'body', 'crude', 'term', 'place', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'kid', 'friendly', 'family', 'Extra', 'Features', 'include', 'deeper', 'look', 'young', 'contestants', 'lives', 'collection', 'instructional', 'magic', 'tricks', 'ranging', 'simple', 'amazingly', 'difficult', 'can', 'learn', 'watching', 'video.This', 'was', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'look', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed.Recommended', 'CFHNote', 'Review', 'copy', 'provided', 'manufacturer']",Make Believe

On the surface this is a film about a competition for magicians of a young age and as such it explores the fascination and need and the other painful aspects of adolescence that center on being noticed, accepted and to feel OK about themselves. That is what make this films work and why it has become an inspiration for so many young people who are trying to follow their dream - a trait too many of their subsequent generation have forsaken or found inappropriate in the dog eat dog world of making a living.Along the say in this beautifully paced docudrama we meet six contestants who will vie for the title of Teen World Champion in the World Magic Seminar in Las Vegas. Each of these contestants captures our hearts and through their penetrating focus on preparing for the competition and the notice from the public, from their families and from each other weaves a story that revisits what it is like to dream - in the vulnerable time of adolescence. This is not a peek into American teens' lives - this is a journey around the globe where we meet teens form many countries, and the disparities and similarities among these youngsters who are likely inclined in the same field is a lesson in sociology and psychology and coming of age.  It has moments of sadness, moments of anxiety and moments of humor all blended into a surprisingly entertaining and heartwarming film.

However, this is not a movie just for magicians and those interested in becoming more involved in magic. It is entertaining for all.Right at the start, I was amazed to see the skill level of this group of teens. They were true professionals right off the bat. They took their 'job' seriously and it was a huge driving force in their lives for many years.I was so pleased to 'meet' this select group of amazing kids. Each had a unique story, each had struggles and issues to overcome but each had the same goal of being crowned Teen World Champion in Las Vegas. But this documentary was not just about getting to the competition and who won but traveling the globe to bring in participants from Japan, Africa and many points throughout America.The participants, their families and their journeys are all unique as were their acts. Without giving a spoiler, I will say that I was crying at the end when the winner was announced. I felt like I was in it with these great kids and they were all in it with each other as well - supportive, and good friends to each other.Make Believe gives you a small glimpse into the skill and time it takes to make the art of prestidigitation look like anyone could do it.The movie ends with a 6 month follow-up on the teens that were featured and has some added bonus material on each teen as well as tips and tutorials for performing a few magic tricks. It should be noted that there are a couple of places that minor swears are uttered and there is a slang word used (for 'chest') that made it a little uncomfortable for me to hear in front of my 8 year old - but don't let these be a reasons to not watch the movie - it's all part the documentary feel.I was provided a copy of the movie by Passion River Films for an honest review.",5,Wonderful Documentary That Had Me Hooked from the Start,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1858,"[""'m"", 'bystander', 'when', 'magic', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'being', 'audience', 'not', 'magician', 'However', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'magicians', 'interested', 'becoming', 'more', 'involved', 'magic', 'entertaining', 'all.Right', 'start', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'skill', 'level', 'group', 'teens', 'were', 'true', 'professionals', 'right', 'bat', 'took', ""'job"", 'seriously', 'was', 'huge', 'driving', 'force', 'lives', 'many', 'years.I', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', ""'meet"", 'select', 'group', 'amazing', 'kids', 'had', 'unique', 'story', 'had', 'struggles', 'issues', 'overcome', 'had', 'same', 'goal', 'being', 'crowned', 'Teen', 'World', 'Champion', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'documentary', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'getting', 'competition', 'who', 'won', 'traveling', 'globe', 'bring', 'participants', 'Japan', 'Africa', 'many', 'points', 'America.The', 'participants', 'families', 'journeys', 'are', 'unique', 'were', 'acts', 'giving', 'spoiler', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'crying', 'end', 'when', 'winner', 'was', 'announced', 'felt', 'was', 'great', 'kids', 'were', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'supportive', 'good', 'friends', 'other.Make', 'Believe', 'small', 'glimpse', 'skill', 'time', 'make', 'art', 'prestidigitation', 'look', 'anyone', 'could', 'do', 'it.The', 'movie', '6', 'month', 'follow-up', 'teens', 'were', 'featured', 'added', 'bonus', 'material', 'teen', 'as', 'well', 'tips', 'tutorials', 'performing', 'few', 'magic', 'tricks', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'are', 'couple', 'places', 'minor', 'swears', 'are', 'uttered', 'slang', 'word', 'used', ""'chest"", 'made', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'hear', 'front', '8', 'year', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'be', 'reasons', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'part', 'documentary', 'feel.I', 'was', 'provided', 'copy', 'movie', 'Passion', 'River', 'Films', 'honest', 'review']",Make Believe
1496875,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005OUJRKK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","When I had the opportunity to watch ""Make Believe,"" I knew very little about the documentary. Having lived in Los Angeles for ten years, I always wanted to explore the infamous Magic Castle in Hollywood--but alas, I was just a mere mortal and not one of the privileged. This film, though, is about making those kind of dreams come true. And for that reason, it is pretty irresistible. If you have watched other documentaries about a particular competition (spelling, cooking, racing, etc), you will be absolutely familiar with the framework of this movie. We span the globe and are introduced to six aspiring young magicians. They then are chosen to compete in a Teen World Championship, visit the Magic Castle, journey to Las Vegas and we see much of the competition before a winner is declared. Luckily, the subjects are appealing and interesting and it's absolutely fascinating to see the dedication that each has put into perfecting the skill of illusion. In the end, maybe the film itself would qualify for four stars--but I absolutely loved it and got swept up into this world. For that reason, I've got to tell you to see this movie especially if you love magic! It's a no-brainer and my heart awards ""Make Believe"" the highest recommendation.Why? It's the kids. They are a diverse group and you find yourself rooting for each one for varying reasons. All the kids contribute greatly to the documentary, but these are the ones that really stood out for me. There's the incumbent star, Krysten Lambert, a Malibu blonde raised in this environment and considered a huge talent already. Derek McGee, from Colorado, used his love of magic to escape a life of severe shyness (a truly appealing underdog). I really liked Siphiwe Fangase and Nkumbuzo Nkonyana from South Africa, a duo who may not be the best illusionists but put together hysterical and entertaining acts. But the movie's true break-out star has got to be Hiroki Hara. Raised in an isolated region of Japan, he is completely self-taught. Since he has learned everything by himself (he can't just drop into the local magic store or even watch magic), his act has a unique style and is simply amazing. Quite seriously, I will never forget Hiroki Hara--that's how impressed I was with his journey.Of course, this is a big event in the world of magic so you will see some familiar faces. Lance Burton makes an appearance as well as magic enthusiast Neil Patrick Harris. But the film has two real stars: the performers and the acts themselves. Everything else is terrific, but somewhat superfluous. As I said, filmmaker J. Clay Tweel adheres to a fairly conventional narrative in rolling out ""Make Believe."" As expected, the final show-down plays out quite dramatically (and with surprising emotion). With all the reality based programming on TV showing that every kid already thinks he/she should be a star, it's refreshing to follow an intelligent group with actual talent! Working toward your dream is an incredible message, one that we have forgotten to teach many of the wannabe generation. That's why I loved these young stars. They have drive, skill, and perseverance. Wildly entertaining, ""Make Believe"" made me believe.

1496876,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B005OUJRKK,Noname,"[0, 0]","""Make Believe"" is a documentary following six young magicians as they compete in a teen magic competition pitting the best young magicians from around the world. Three of them are from the United States, one from Japan, and two from Africa. It was heartwarming. In fact, I was a little teary eyed when the winner was announced and the one I was rooting for won. I even googled him, because I'd love to see the kid on tour.My children were captivated, although I admit to cringing with the occasional crude language. They noticed it less than I did. The DVD includes a tutorial section on mostly card tricks that were basic but pretty ingenious. The kids immediately began trying to perform them. This film may have just inspired some budding artists.
