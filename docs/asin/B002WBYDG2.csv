1296651,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B002WBYDG2,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[2, 2]","It is so hard to believe that the original great of Family Feud, Richard Dawson has died after battling cancer of the esophagus. He really was a quick-witted game show host, whom really was the George Clooney of his era in the 60's and 70's. His game show era was remarkable, and he knew how to make people laugh, cry, and have a great sense of humor. Family Feud was a great game show during the 70's and 80's, under Dawson's era. But his works with celebrities were really where the stars came out to play, from Susan Lucci to Dick Van Patten from Eight Is Enough, all the way Mark Goodson himself and Richard Simmons. But with of the shows Richard Dawson had done, only the celebrity shows have came down video, and a lot of them are right here.Best Of All Star Family Feud, which came out in 2008, showcases Family Feud during the 70's and 80's, during Richard Dawson's first era of the show, when celebrities came out to play for charity in the funniest ways from Betty White, to Florence Henderson and The Brady Bunch, all playing for charities of their choices, and a bit of family frolic. The shows are remastered well, while in each show, Richard Dawson put on his most elegant in tuxedo and all, as each celebrity out their best and the brightest, by matching their answers with the surveys. Looking back at these shows, they are still definitely as fun to watch today, as they were back in the days that they were first aired. You are sometimes quickly reminded of what made a great game show host deliver. Richard Dawson did learn from the best, as he was at one point as panelist on Match Game with Gene Rayburn.Richard Dawson wore many hats in his career, from playing Newkirk on Hogan's Heroes, to being a talk show sidekick in the United Kingdom on Mike Stogey's talk show, to being the deviant game show host in the movie The Running Man. But the one hat everyone thinks of with Richard the most was the one he wore as the host of Family Feud. Since that era, every emcee that has done Family Feud from the late Ray Combs whom tragically committed suicide in 1996 to the latest host Steve Harvey has tried to make Family Feud his own. But no one has replicated what Richard Dawson did for the show. Survey says, Richard Dawson, you'll be missed, and that is the #1 answer.Richard Dawson 1932-2012Price: BRemastering: C+Shows: BOverall: B-",4,"Survey Says, Goodbye Richard",1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2355,"['so', 'hard', 'believe', 'original', 'great', 'Family', 'Feud', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'died', 'battling', 'cancer', 'esophagus', 'really', 'was', 'quick-witted', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'whom', 'really', 'was', 'George', 'Clooney', 'era', '60', '70', 'game', 'show', 'era', 'was', 'remarkable', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'people', 'cry', 'have', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'Family', 'Feud', 'was', 'great', 'game', 'show', '70', '80', 'Dawson', 'era', 'works', 'celebrities', 'were', 'really', 'where', 'stars', 'came', 'out', 'play', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Eight', 'Is', 'Enough', 'way', 'Mark', 'Goodson', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'shows', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'had', 'done', 'only', 'celebrity', 'shows', 'have', 'came', 'down', 'video', 'lot', 'are', 'right', 'here.Best', 'All', 'Star', 'Family', 'Feud', 'came', 'out', '2008', 'Family', 'Feud', '70', '80', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'first', 'era', 'show', 'when', 'celebrities', 'came', 'out', 'play', 'charity', 'funniest', 'ways', 'Betty', 'White', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'playing', 'charities', 'choices', 'bit', 'family', 'frolic', 'shows', 'are', 'remastered', 'well', 'show', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'put', 'most', 'elegant', 'tuxedo', 'celebrity', 'out', 'best', 'brightest', 'matching', 'answers', 'surveys', 'Looking', 'back', 'shows', 'are', 'still', 'definitely', 'fun', 'watch', 'today', 'were', 'back', 'days', 'were', 'first', 'aired', 'are', 'sometimes', 'quickly', 'reminded', 'what', 'made', 'great', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'deliver', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'did', 'learn', 'best', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'panelist', 'Match', 'Game', 'Gene', 'Rayburn.Richard', 'Dawson', 'wore', 'many', 'hats', 'career', 'playing', 'Newkirk', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'being', 'talk', 'show', 'sidekick', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'Mike', 'Stogey', 'talk', 'show', 'being', 'deviant', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'movie', 'Running', 'Man', 'one', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'Richard', 'most', 'was', 'one', 'wore', 'host', 'Family', 'Feud', 'era', 'emcee', 'done', 'Family', 'Feud', 'late', 'Ray', 'Combs', 'whom', 'tragically', 'committed', 'suicide', '1996', 'latest', 'host', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'tried', 'make', 'Family', 'Feud', 'own', 'one', 'replicated', 'what', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'did', 'show', 'Survey', 'Richard', 'Dawson', ""'ll"", 'be', 'missed', '1', 'answer.Richard', 'Dawson', '1932-2012Price', 'BRemastering', 'C+Shows', 'B-']",N/A
