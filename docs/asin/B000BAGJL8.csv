I don't blame Barney.  Children like the same thing over and over, adults don't! I also realize that actually going to the beach might increase the cost of production, but the fake one looks really fake.

I opened the door and let him touch the falling rain and sit and watch the rain. Then when I put on the video I pointed out that he had rain like the kids on the video.  He really liked that.,5,"Fun, Playful Video.",1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,326,"['34', 'One', '34', 'times', 'watched', 'video', 'was', 'raining', 'outside', 'put', 'grandson', 'little', 'chair', 'close', 'french', 'doors', 'opened', 'door', 'let', 'touch', 'falling', 'rain', 'sit', 'watch', 'rain', 'Then', 'when', 'put', 'video', 'pointed', 'out', 'had', 'rain', 'kids', 'video', 'really', 'liked']",Barney: Let's Go To The Beach
