532329,A2PS1KAU6MGELR,B00003CXQA,A Customer,"[0, 0]","I know someone who likes this movie a lot...and is intrigued by it, so I will tread lightly.First, one of the most hilarious, but awful (if intentional) puns...or one of the most incredible lapses of continuity scoping, and then the pun splats you in the face! ...when David comes to the gallery and meets Elijah's mother, they talk and are getting acquainted and she is telling some things about Elijah...she says: &quot;He has come through a lot in his life. A couple of bad spells I thought HAD BROKEN HIM.&quot; Oh my gosh...did she really say that?!!!There are so many reviews here, that there is no need to go over plot. A few dislikes...and a few likes are sufficient, I think. The worst acting in the film comes from David's wife's crying scene when she comes and asks him if he has been with anyone while they have been having problems...her sniffling is very unreal...too artificial...the same goes for the the kid actor playing &quot;Joseph&quot;... his crying is just as artificial and unbelievable... but at least, one might say that in the realm of crying he is like his &quot;mother.&quot;A scene that takes on different connotations and responses in this viewer, at least, on the second viewing (and knowing what is in the ending) ...when Elijah falls down the stairs of the subway entrance trying to follow the mysterious stranger on whom David's &quot;intuition&quot; had &quot;seen&quot; a gun...the second time I was thorougly satisfied to see the fall and hear the crunch (if you know what I mean).And when Elijah is lying in the hospital, and the camera closes in on his eye...it looks like the eye of the whale in the 1950s version of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;... then the image is put inside the circle of the logo leading into the image of the next scene.And when David stops the foreign looking gentleman at the stadium and frisks him for drugs, he should have arrested him for impersonating a film director (sorry, guys, I just had to do it!).Well, we know the flaw with the plot, don't we? What comic book hero was ever married...and had a kid? So, you say in defense, they are trying to make it a hero for these mediocre modern times...but isn't that what kills the original mythos of the comic book heroes of the 30s, 40s, and 50s? ...trying to make them synch in with modern times and mores? Aren't comic book heroes written and drawn for adolescent males to fantasize about? Do adolescent males, thinking of power and strength and muscular bodies that they might have, also fantasize about marriage...and a kid... and a job as a security guard at a football stadium?&quot;Superman&quot; always had the aesthetic and power appeal for me...but &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; had a lot of mystic aura...and that neat lightning bolt on his chest... but just don't remind us of Gomer Pyle saying you-know-what...what a way to kill a fantasy!The best photography in this film is the first outside shot of the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; gallery... the windows are nice...and the shots in the swimming pool as David is struggling to get out of the pool cover with the sparkling light coming down through the water...the painting behind David and his wife in the restaurant has unbelievably beautiful color...but that dialogue and that whole scene are tedious for me...The person I mentioned who likes this film is especially impressed with the scene in the train station when David walks down the stairs to be &quot;where there are people&quot; (as Elijah has told him to do). The train station and its lighting almost take on a cathedral like aspect...The most contrasting music versus action comes when David struggles with the killer in the bedroom...you have this very interesting heroic/almost religious music while these two guys are grappling in a very real looking bedroom...which seems pretty mediocre...and they are knocking punch impressions in the walls...The best sound in the film is when David first walks into the bedroom...the thunder...and the wind...from the rainstorm outside...the blowing strips of curtain... nice effect of sound and visual...Let's hope two and three are better and more able to stand alone on their own...does this film measure up in your mind to a possible rival for the first entry in the &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy?",4,&quot;They say this One has a surprise ending.&quot;,996969600,"08 5, 2001",2001,4278,"['know', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'lot', 'intrigued', 'will', 'tread', 'lightly.First', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'awful', 'intentional', 'puns', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'lapses', 'continuity', 'scoping', 'then', 'pun', 'face', 'when', 'David', 'gallery', 'Elijah', 'mother', 'talk', 'are', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'telling', 'things', 'Elijah', 'quot', 'come', 'lot', 'life', 'couple', 'bad', 'spells', 'thought', 'HAD', 'BROKEN', 'HIM.', 'quot', 'Oh', 'gosh', 'did', 'really', 'say', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'need', 'go', 'over', 'plot', 'few', 'dislikes', 'few', 'likes', 'are', 'sufficient', 'think', 'worst', 'acting', 'film', 'David', 'wife', 'crying', 'scene', 'when', 'been', 'anyone', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'problems', 'sniffling', 'very', 'unreal', 'too', 'artificial', 'same', 'kid', 'actor', 'playing', 'quot', 'Joseph', 'quot', 'crying', 'just', 'artificial', 'unbelievable', 'least', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'realm', 'crying', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'scene', 'different', 'connotations', 'responses', 'viewer', 'least', 'second', 'viewing', 'knowing', 'what', 'ending', 'when', 'Elijah', 'down', 'stairs', 'subway', 'entrance', 'trying', 'follow', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'whom', 'David', 'quot', 'intuition', 'quot', 'had', 'quot', 'seen', 'quot', 'gun', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'thorougly', 'satisfied', 'see', 'fall', 'hear', 'crunch', 'know', 'what', 'mean', '.And', 'when', 'Elijah', 'lying', 'hospital', 'camera', 'eye', 'eye', 'whale', '1950s', 'version', 'quot', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'quot', 'then', 'image', 'put', 'circle', 'logo', 'leading', 'image', 'next', 'scene.And', 'when', 'David', 'foreign', 'looking', 'gentleman', 'stadium', 'drugs', 'should', 'have', 'arrested', 'impersonating', 'film', 'director', 'sorry', 'guys', 'just', 'had', 'do', '.Well', 'know', 'flaw', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'What', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'was', 'ever', 'married', 'had', 'kid', 'So', 'say', 'defense', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'hero', 'mediocre', 'modern', 'times', ""n't"", 'what', 'original', 'mythos', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', '30s', '40s', '50s', 'trying', 'make', 'synch', 'modern', 'times', 'mores', 'Are', ""n't"", 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'written', 'drawn', 'adolescent', 'males', 'fantasize', 'Do', 'adolescent', 'males', 'thinking', 'power', 'strength', 'muscular', 'bodies', 'might', 'have', 'also', 'fantasize', 'marriage', 'kid', 'job', 'security', 'guard', 'football', 'stadium', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'always', 'had', 'aesthetic', 'power', 'appeal', 'quot', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'quot', 'had', 'lot', 'mystic', 'aura', 'neat', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'chest', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'remind', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'saying', 'you-know-what', 'what', 'way', 'kill', 'fantasy', 'best', 'photography', 'film', 'first', 'outside', 'shot', 'quot', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'quot', 'gallery', 'windows', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'swimming', 'pool', 'David', 'struggling', 'get', 'pool', 'cover', 'sparkling', 'light', 'coming', 'down', 'water', 'painting', 'David', 'wife', 'restaurant', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'color', 'dialogue', 'whole', 'scene', 'are', 'tedious', 'person', 'mentioned', 'who', 'film', 'especially', 'impressed', 'scene', 'train', 'station', 'when', 'David', 'walks', 'down', 'stairs', 'be', 'quot', 'where', 'are', 'people', 'quot', 'Elijah', 'told', 'do', 'train', 'station', 'lighting', 'almost', 'take', 'cathedral', 'aspect', 'most', 'contrasting', 'music', 'versus', 'action', 'when', 'David', 'killer', 'bedroom', 'have', 'very', 'interesting', 'heroic/almost', 'religious', 'music', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'grappling', 'very', 'real', 'looking', 'bedroom', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'are', 'knocking', 'punch', 'impressions', 'walls', 'best', 'sound', 'film', 'when', 'David', 'first', 'bedroom', 'thunder', 'wind', 'rainstorm', 'blowing', 'strips', 'curtain', 'nice', 'effect', 'sound', 'visual', 'Let', 'hope', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'better', 'more', 'able', 'stand', 'alone', 'own', 'film', 'measure', 'up', 'mind', 'possible', 'rival', 'first', 'entry', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'trilogy']",Unbreakable
532330,ANYRXHDVOVS17,B00003CXQA,A. Customer,"[2, 2]","The tendency to have an honest literary ending is one reason I like UNBREAKABLE.  It ends where it is supposed to end.  It ends where it would have ended in a short story.  We do not need to see Willis scrap it out with arch villain Jackson, though I think that might have made it a more successful movie.The film does not ... as some reviewers claim.  In fact, it is quite good--as a story.  And the acting and direction are competent.  Call me a fool, but I am a big Bruce Willis fan (except for LAST MAN STANDING).  Maybe the problem with the movie is that with its honest ending, it had no business being a movie.  Perhaps it ... as cinema, at least for those who like their car chases and explosions at the end.  In that sense, then, I agree that there is no ""cinematic"" payoff.Nevertheless, in the Twilight Zone/O Henry/Guy DeMaupassant tradition, it works marvelously.  There is a cerebral payoff.  You thought you knew what was happening, but you were wrong.  To make this movie good cinema, in the pop sense, the director would have had to include a bigger EXTERNAL story than the one he ultimately chose (psycho kidnaps/cohabits with family), and thereby allow the newly revealed hero to SAVE THE WORLD.  A bigger story might be a terrorist bombing of a major city, a dam's bursting, or the kidnapping of a First Lady.  He might also have allowed Samuel L. Jackson to give the fledgling hero a WORTHY PHYSICAL challenge, now that he (Jackson) has been revealed as a wheelchair bound Lex Luthor.I have heard that the thing is the first in a trilogy.

532331,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00003CXQA,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[1, 2]","Unbreakable silently sneaked its way onto the big screen, then vaporized as if never there. Why?! Bruce Willis plays someone that is on the edge of loosing everything: his family. Though the topic of unfaithfullness is addressed you can tell that there is something truly devistating between his life, and his wife's (Robin Wright Penn). The once avid spark of love has fragmented and broken, and for this reason, he takes a train ride to get a new job in New York. If the job turns out, he is leaving his wife and son. It is on this train that something tragic, and wonderful happens. The train crashes, killing every passenger...except him. He survives without a scratch. Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book dealer that is full of dark secrets, and knows after reading about Willis's survival in the train crash, that perhaps a life long search is over. Jackson is a character that has a disease in which he is very fragile, and breaks like glass. Maybe, just maybe, the survivor is his exact opposite. Someone that can withstand anything, and can't be sick, or injured. And, he believes, that superheroes could possibly exist. As he is fragile like glass, maybe there is someone on the other end of the spectrum that is unbreakable.The reason Unbreakable is so important, is if in fact there is to be a trilogy about a hero, won't you wanna find out where he came from? What was his original drive? I think one day we will look back on this movie as the first superman, or matrix. The story behind the story. That does something great. It promises No Prequals, and No bloody six year wait, as in the Star Wars series. I recommend this movie for sixth sense fans, and to those of you who love a good surprise ending. And it helps if your tastes border on drama/thriller/suspense. After watching it once I bet you'll wanna watch it again. That to me is the first and foremost way to rate a movie...the re-watch factor. Once just ain't enough. Unbreakable taunts your brain and raises a lot of questions, and is entirely believable. As for other movies I had high hopes, but this time I wasn't let down. After you watch it you will probably roll the plot around in your mind and wonder whether or not you have ever been injured, sick, or broken...

532333,A2S166WSCFIFP5,B00003CXQA,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[0, 0]","I think M. Night Shyamalan has proven that he is one of the most talented new directors today. The Sixth Sense is truly awesome, and Signs is his masterpiece. Unbreakable is definitely the lesser of the three 'big' movies Night has made, but that isn't saying it is a bad film. It's just a testimony to how good Signs and Sixth Sense are. Unbreakable is a great film itself. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson give great performances. As always the visuals (especially color) play a huge role in the telling of the story. And there is Night's twists at the end. The movie is shown in what can only be called a comic book style. I don't mean overdone or campy, but the colors, camera movements, everything about the film suggests a comic book feel. It's really a well done movie, and like his other movies, one that has to be watched many times to get it all.The dvd is packaged in an elegant slip cover, 2 disc edition, with a replica of Alex Ross's art. There is no commentary track, which is a shame. Filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan, David Fincher, Tarantino, and the Coen brothers shouldn't be allowed to not have commentary tracks on their dvds. There is just too much going on and too much that is missed by not having commentary. What it does have is a behind the scenes featurette that is very well done (not like all those we've seen that are basically 20 minute summary/trailer). There's also a featurette that discusses comic books and superheros. There are storyboards and deleted scenes (and some great scenes were deleted from this movie).What makes this film especially interesting is that instead of making a movie about a superhero, like most filmmakers would do, Night makes the movie about a man discovering he is a superhero. That's it. Simple, elegant, brillaint. M. Night Shyamalan will one day take his place amongst the great directors like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Orson Welles.

It is the origin story of a superhero with lots and lots of class.  It speaks of Dunn's (Willis) troubled home life with wife Robin Wright Penn and son, and how a man (Samuel L. Jackson) changes everything.  See, Dunn survives a train wreck in which every other passenger dies and Jackson, who has a rare disease known as Osteogenesis imperfecta which makes his bones very brittle, seeks him out, sensing that something sets Dunn apart. This is a very clever, well written thriller with one of Willis' best performances to date.  The pace of the movie is slow, methodical and deliberate, which might bore some audiences, but I found it to be incredible.  There is a twist at the end for those who were a fan the Sixth Sense, but this movie is more than an ending, it is a brilliantly crafted character story, handled with maturity and grace, a far step from any comic book movie ever released.  Two thumbs up for the movie. The DVD, in a two disc presentation, is pretty solid.  The anamorphic widescreen transfer is strong and the sound quality is great. The DVDs are also filled with special features, including a documentary with cast and crew, deleted scenes introduced by Shyamalan, and a documentary on comics and superheroes hosted by Jackson and a multi-angle feature on the ending of the movie. The lack of a commentary by the director or lead actors hurts the overall rating, but still, this DVD is a worthwhile purchase on the merits of the movie alone, the features are just a great bonus.",4,Shyamalan and Willis do it again!,993686400,"06 28, 2001",2001,1861,"['movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'perform', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'one', 'reason', 'People', 'went', 'expecting', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'were', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Sure', 'same', 'director', 'one', 'same', 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'fell', 'more', 'less', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'handled', 'very', 'maturely', 'origin', 'story', 'superhero', 'lots', 'lots', 'class', 'Dunn', 'Willis', 'troubled', 'home', 'life', 'wife', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'son', 'how', 'man', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'everything', 'See', 'Dunn', 'train', 'wreck', 'other', 'passenger', 'dies', 'Jackson', 'who', 'rare', 'disease', 'known', 'Osteogenesis', 'imperfecta', 'bones', 'very', 'brittle', 'out', 'sensing', 'something', 'sets', 'Dunn', 'apart', 'very', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'thriller', 'one', 'Willis', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'pace', 'movie', 'slow', 'methodical', 'deliberate', 'might', 'bore', 'audiences', 'found', 'be', 'incredible', 'twist', 'end', 'who', 'were', 'fan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'movie', 'more', 'ending', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'character', 'story', 'handled', 'maturity', 'grace', 'far', 'step', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'ever', 'released', 'Two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'movie', 'DVD', 'two', 'disc', 'presentation', 'pretty', 'solid', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'strong', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'DVDs', 'are', 'also', 'filled', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'documentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introduced', 'Shyamalan', 'documentary', 'comics', 'superheroes', 'hosted', 'Jackson', 'multi-angle', 'feature', 'ending', 'movie', 'lack', 'commentary', 'director', 'lead', 'actors', 'overall', 'rating', 'still', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'merits', 'movie', 'alone', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'bonus']",Unbreakable

532339,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,B00003CXQA,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Many people make the mistake of comparing Unbreakable too much to The 6th Sense or are expecting too much of the same cookie-cutter sci/fi movies being generated by Hollywood as of late. We are conditioned to think all Sci/Fi must have great special effects, dramatic fight sequences, lavish sets, and futuristic gadgetry.The old Twilight Zone series provided many a great tale with none of the above, and this is what Unbreakable accomplishes. It is a great drama (some may say a little slow and that's hard to argue, but there is a reason for it) and breaks the conventional mold of recent Sci/Fi flicks. One of the featurettes does a great job explaining the motivation and tone of the movie and makes us think differently about super heroes.The story revolves around Bruce Willis's character and the self realization that he is somewhat different from other people. But exactly how is he different, what are his limits, why is like this, and what is he supposed to do with this knowledge. This journey of self discovery is prodded along by the character of Samuel Jackson. Jackson is masterful is his characterization of a handicapped man and his view point and rational of people. He breaks down good and evil that can be explained by any comic book. He contends that there are actual 'super-heroes' here on Earth, but many aren't aware of their special nature, ergo, Bruce Willis.  Is Bruce a 'Super' hero?  What defines one as greater than a mortal man and how do you deal with it?But Willis thinks that Jackson may be deranged at first and needs to spend his time fixing other things in his life, like his marriage and his own mental health. But then things start to happen, subtle at first, they soon begin to paint a picture that Bruce knows is true but can't believe it.The movie is a bit morose, mostly with muted colors, sounds and overtly dark in nature but this serves a purpose. Color and sound (or lack of at times) are integral parts of the overall story and are characters in their own right. Sound quality is good and no visual defects.Like The 6th Sense, the ending was a shocker. Two hours moves you to these last five minutes, and it is worth it.Now onto the DVD itself. There are actually two: 1) The movie, 2) Bonus material. First off let me say the packaging is very nice. Opens up into a quad fold made out of heavy cardboard stock and looks slick. Inside is a Alex Ross collectible card that represent Bruce Willis on one side and Samuel Jackson (both in costume) on the other. Very nice, but I would have liked two separate cards instead of one image on each side..I'd like to frame these...they are that nice. The first disc is a normal DVD, basically the movie with Audio options. What is missing that I would have liked was a director's commentary track to accompany the movie....sadly there is none. Disc 2 contains the bonus material: The making of Unbreakable (about 20 minutes and pretty interesting), 7 deleted scenes (another 20 minutes by God, why were they cut?!?...they leant so much more!!), a documentary on Comic Books throughout the past few decades....very interesting to the casual person, but priceless for the comic book fan (a lot of industry names in this feature), a small 5 minute fight scene staring the director as a young teenager (pretty silly overall and wonder why it's here), and a split angle train sequence live action/storyboard (okay).There is also a small booklet included that seems slightly like filler material about the movie.Overall, a great deal, but would have liked slightly more bonus material to justify the second disc and director commentary.",4,Different type of Sci Fi Drama.

532341,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXQA,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Unbreakable' is one of those films that has aged rather well with me.  When director M. Night Shyamalan first introduced himself to the movie going public in 1999 (`The Sixth Sense' was his second film, but it was the first that got anyone to take notice) he had so much promise, but sadly `Unbreakable' is the only film since that has expounded on that promise.  One day I'll bombard you with a verbal slaughtering of `Lady in the Water', `Signs' and `The Village' (I refuse to see `The Happening'), but until then you can relish in some praise for `Unbreakable'.Shyamalan's answer to the super hero origin story, `Unbreakable' tells of David Dunn, a unhappily married man who lives a rather ordinary (if not bland) life until a tragic train accident adds a new purpose to his life.This is not your average superhero story, and it isn't anything like `The Sixth Sense', so it may be hard for many to completely get into this film.  I remember when I saw it in the theater I was let down pretty bad, and so was everyone else I was with.  We were expecting something like `The Sixth Sense', complete with the scares we felt when watching the 1999 thriller.  Instead, `Unbreakable' is a slow and brooding character study that is more haunting than scary.  Like I said, it has aged well with me.  I appreciate the film much more now than I did when I first saw it (kind of like `The Village', although I still think that `The Village' is a mediocre film).One thing that I really admire about this film is Shyamalan's direction.  Sure, his screenwriting skills have become convoluted and forced as the years have progressed (he tries way too hard, and it shows) but his direction is always near impeccable.  He knows how to capture a mood and tone.  Here, he gives a very dark and gritty atmosphere to the film without ever compromising the comic book feel (the way the film is shot is almost TOO smart).  The characters are shot in ways that accentuate their personalities and eventualities marvelously, using such clever technique to embellish what Shyamalan has crafted on the page.  In fact, upon reflection I think that this direction may be even more accomplished and noteworthy than that of `The Sixth Sense'.The acting is all very appropriate and at times even moving.  Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career in `The Sixth Sense', and he follows that up with yet another very well controlled and admirable effort.  Although he is known for his action films, for me he really shows a depth and range here that he should tap into more often.  Robin Wright Penn is also quite impressive in her scenes, and although Jackson does come off somewhat clich&eacute;d and campy at times, he evokes a genuine chill (as in `down the back of your spine') that captures Shyamalan's vision marvelously.  I actually thought that the films best performance came from Spencer Treat Clark, who understood the balance between his characters fear and admiration of his father.It was stunning and only grows more and more haunting every time I see the film.The idea of the `every man' coming into his own as a superhero has been approached before, but Shyamalan adds a layer of realism to this film by ditching the corny one-liners, ridiculous costumes and unrealistic `super villains' and their dastardly deeds, replacing them with a normal man muddling through realistic dialog, struggling to understand himself in a world with drug dealers and murderers and front page headline stories that you read about everyday.Like I said, this is not your typical superhero story...this is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies.",4,(Possibly) the most realistic superhero movie ever made...,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,3636,"['Unbreakable', 'one', 'films', 'aged', 'rather', 'well', 'When', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'first', 'introduced', 'movie', 'going', 'public', '1999', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'got', 'anyone', 'take', 'notice', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'sadly', 'Unbreakable', 'only', 'film', 'expounded', 'promise', 'One', 'day', ""'ll"", 'bombard', 'verbal', 'slaughtering', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Signs', 'Village', 'refuse', 'see', 'Happening', 'then', 'can', 'relish', 'praise', ""Unbreakable'.Shyamalan"", 'answer', 'super', 'hero', 'origin', 'story', 'Unbreakable', 'tells', 'David', 'Dunn', 'unhappily', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'not', 'bland', 'life', 'tragic', 'train', 'accident', 'new', 'purpose', 'life.This', 'not', 'average', 'superhero', 'story', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'many', 'completely', 'get', 'film', 'remember', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'pretty', 'bad', 'so', 'was', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'complete', 'scares', 'felt', 'when', 'watching', '1999', 'thriller', 'Instead', 'Unbreakable', 'slow', 'brooding', 'character', 'study', 'more', 'haunting', 'scary', 'said', 'aged', 'well', 'appreciate', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'kind', 'Village', 'still', 'think', 'Village', 'mediocre', 'film', '.One', 'thing', 'really', 'admire', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'direction', 'Sure', 'screenwriting', 'skills', 'have', 'become', 'convoluted', 'forced', 'years', 'have', 'progressed', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'direction', 'always', 'impeccable', 'how', 'capture', 'mood', 'tone', 'Here', 'very', 'dark', 'gritty', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'ever', 'compromising', 'comic', 'book', 'feel', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'almost', 'TOO', 'smart', 'characters', 'are', 'shot', 'ways', 'accentuate', 'personalities', 'eventualities', 'marvelously', 'using', 'such', 'clever', 'technique', 'embellish', 'what', 'Shyamalan', 'crafted', 'page', 'fact', 'reflection', 'think', 'direction', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'accomplished', 'noteworthy', 'Sixth', ""Sense'.The"", 'acting', 'very', 'appropriate', 'times', 'even', 'moving', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'performance', 'career', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'up', 'yet', 'very', 'well', 'controlled', 'admirable', 'effort', 'known', 'action', 'films', 'really', 'depth', 'range', 'here', 'should', 'tap', 'more', 'often', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'also', 'quite', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'Jackson', 'come', 'off', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'campy', 'times', 'genuine', 'chill', 'back', 'spine', 'Shyamalan', 'vision', 'marvelously', 'actually', 'thought', 'films', 'best', 'performance', 'came', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'who', 'understood', 'balance', 'characters', 'fear', 'admiration', 'father.It', 'was', 'stunning', 'only', 'more', 'more', 'haunting', 'time', 'see', 'film.The', 'idea', 'man', 'coming', 'own', 'superhero', 'been', 'approached', 'Shyamalan', 'layer', 'realism', 'film', 'ditching', 'corny', 'one-liners', 'ridiculous', 'costumes', 'unrealistic', 'super', 'villains', 'dastardly', 'deeds', 'replacing', 'normal', 'man', 'muddling', 'realistic', 'dialog', 'struggling', 'understand', 'world', 'drug', 'dealers', 'murderers', 'front', 'page', 'headline', 'stories', 'read', 'everyday.Like', 'said', 'not', 'typical', 'superhero', 'story', 'superhero', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'superhero', 'movies']",Unbreakable

532343,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00003CXQA,Anthony Hinde,"[84, 86]","These days any film associated with comics is likely to be a special effects extravaganza full of action and short on character development. Well director M. Night Shyamalan has taken us in a different direction, (no surprise there). His film, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, explores the action comic philosophy without becoming an action comic itself. You won't see  men in spandex leaping from tall buildings to save the day. What you will see is a thoughtful investigation of the unusual skills we humans may or may not have, and the choices we make regarding their use.I have a talent for putting holes in T-shirts. My sister can permanently stop any watch she wears for a few weeks. It's hard to see either of us becoming crime fighters or maniacal masterminds on the strength of these talents but it does makes you think. Let's stretch our imaginations a little further. What if a man had the uncanny luck to avoid virtually all injury or illness? Could this be significant? Would he even notice? Where would it lead him?Unbreakable introduces us to such a man. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the sole survivor of a tragic train derailment that killed the other 131 passengers. David walks away without a scratch and barely notices his fifteen minutes of fame on the local news channels. But at least one other person takes note of David's uncanny good fortune. Elijah Price is an art dealer, played convincingly by Samuel L Jackson. His gallery specializes in comic art and he is very passionate about the seriousness of his chosen profession and it's medium.Elijah believes that action comics represent an ancient wisdom, exaggerated and commercialized but still containing an essence of truth. His theory is that there are  people with extraordinary abilities and that these people have a destiny. Whether these people become legendary hero's or any other larger than life figure depends on them realizing their destiny and fulfilling their potential. In David Dunn, he suspects lies the heart of a hero and Elijah's obsession soon drags David and his family into a new world.Shyamalan takes his time with this story. It could have very easily been boring, because when boiled down, little actually happens. However, Unbreakable avoids that trap and becomes instead, a strange mixture of longing, suspense and doubt. We truly get to know David's wife Audrey and his son Joseph. They are not an atypical family; marital problems, boredom and some other dysfunctions feature at the start of the story. In a way, David's gradually more serious attempts to explore his &quot;gift&quot; become the catalyst to improve his home life.The sub-plot of David's crumbling relationship with Audrey, (Robin Wright), is not fully explored but we are given several clues that make it interesting. David is chasing job offers in another city, even after the accident little emotion passes between he and Audrey, and they sleep separately. All of which points to a lack of love. But to counter this we discover that David sacrificed a promising football career to capture Audrey's heart and, even in the hardest times, he has remained faithful to her. I like these quiet story lines, where nothing is forced down your throat and you have to work it out on your own.By far the most interesting character is Elijah. Born with a brittle bone disease, his life  has been crowded with pain, torment and ostracism. At school he was taunted with the moniker, &quot;Mr. Glass&quot;, and to an extent he has embraced this title. If you look closely, you will see that he is always close to glass, for example, his fragile glass walking stick. Elijah is a fighter. His mother headed off a life of seclusion when he was a depressed boy and convinced him to accept life's challenges, eventually leading to his becoming a professional success. Elijah's passion and conviction are magnetic. He not only draws David and his son into the world of duty/destiny but the audience is forced to believe, long before David starts to.Unbreakable is a subtle film about taking risks, acknowledging hope and following dreams.

""albino squirrel""","[0, 0]","I was disappointed with The Sixth Sense because I thought the movie lacked cohesion and had too many details slapped on that weren't really explained, nor were they necessary.However, Unbreakable is a totally different story.  It was deliberate, gripping, intriguing, and yet somehow, it still possessed an unimposing finesse.I did not leave this film with a sense of having finished watching a &quot;comic book story&quot;.  I felt like I had watched simply &quot;a story&quot;, and I don't expect a sequel, follow-up, or an explanation.  The ending was sufficient, the movie self-contained. Unbreakable was an unfolding of a fable, a practical impossibility portrayed in a very real manner.The camerawork, music, lighting, choice of color, and soft-focus effects (in certain shots) sustained the perfect mood and atmosphere.  The movie and images literally never let up.I was even more impressed when I recognized the gentle usage of symbolism--the super-hero's costume serving as a disguise AND protection from his mortal weakness.  The father's teenage son, the embodiment of all mere-mortal adolescents who wish they could manifest their desires to be exceptional, yet can do so only in their imaginations.  I got a bit misty-eyed when David reveals the truth to his child--the unabashed awe and love shared in that moment was priceless.This movie held me spellbound, and afterwards, I was not left griping, &quot;But how come?!  And why the heck?!&quot; as I was after The Sixth Sense.  I believe this movie was handled more carefully and the utmost attention was paid to detail, and to wonderful effect.If Shayamalan can create such &quot;fables&quot; in as meticulous a manner in the future, and with as much resonance and as little contrivance as in Unbreakable, I may actually start paying to go to movies in theatres again.

532345,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00003CXQA,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[0, 0]","Ah, the dreaded ?sophomore project?.  Director M. Night Shyamalan?s second big feature film had me hoping for the best but fearing that the typical pattern would prove true with Unbreakable.  This time the director explores the transcultural hero mythos, which according to the film?s logic is preserved in our modern culture through comic book stories.David Dunn is a security guard with a wife and kid in a big city.  He seems quite ordinary, and probably never would have suspected the truth about himself until a key event changed his life forever:  he survived a devastating train wreck.  In fact, he was the only survivor, unscathed.  There is no logical explanation for how he escaped a mutilating death, and from that point on he is on a mission to track down the answer to Why.  In the process, he meets a rare comic book dealer who explains the universal structure of the guardian/hero archetype told through stories around the world:Heroes ? appears ordinary to the world, but cannot be killed by ordinary means, exceptionally strong; life?s work is to protect the weak and innocent of his time.Villains ? opposite of the hero, but often very close to him, best friends even; life?s purpose is destruction and/or domination. It becomes clear that David was indeed born to be a hero ? but then, who is his opposite terrorizing the city anonymously?I though Unbreakable was a nicely shot in a moody, Film Noir style.  Solid performance by Bruce Willis, who is so very well-cast as an Everyman type who wakes up one day to realize who he really was all his life.  Samuel L. Jackson is his unforgettable counterpart Elijah, the comic bookstore owner -- superbly played. Just slightly slow pacing drags the plot a bit in places, but it is redeemed by a nice twist or two.  I would say that overall, this was a much better-than-average sophomore project for M.

Willis walks through the story with a melancholia that would depress a rock. He was so empty of life and love and joy that I really couldn't care much about him one way or the other. If I had been his wife, I would have divorced him years before!I also found it inconceivable that a grown man would have gone through life without ever being sick or injured -- and with obviously ""super-human"" strengths and abilities -- yet seem almost totally unaware of all of this (at one point, he has to ask his boss and his soon-to-be-ex-wife if he's ever been sick). Believe me, his mother would have realized something was unusual by the time he was 10!!!Still, there was something intriquing about the whole thing, and the acting was fairly good (given the one note that Willis was restricted to).

He figures if there is someone in this world like him, then there must be someone in this world precisely opposite, someone who can never get hurt. Bruce Willis turns out to be that person, as the only survivor of an unsurvivable train wreck. This is when Samuel L. Jackson,who runs an art studio of comic book heroes, finds Bruce Willis. Together they meet, and it is true that Bruce, as a security guard at a football stadium, does have some strange powers.

532357,AE0E6UII0VSZA,B00003CXQA,Blake Kleiner,"[2, 3]","You wake up in a rather murky setting. The stretcher beneath you creaks under your weight as you raise yourself into a sitting position. The curtains around you are mostly closed, leaving an opening the size of a small door. On the other side, you see a man lying on a hospital bed, completely wrapped in bandages, and there is a growing spot of red that tells you the man is hemorrhaging. He is about to die. Everything is kind of fuzzy, but you know that you and the dying man were both victims of the same train wreck, but while he is wrapped up like a mummy and quickly approaching death, you look at yourself, and there isn't a scratch on you.The idea of something like this happening prompts a series of thoughts to streak through your mind, and each of these thoughts is captured in director M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his masterful &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;: &quot;Unbreakable.&quot; And I think I have to answer one question before I really dig into the guts of this review: No, this one isn't as good as &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but it's still ridiculously good.&quot;Unbreakable&quot; examines a world of possibilities that is very similar to comic books. If someone like Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) exists in the world with the horrific disease of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a genetic disorder that makes bones very easy to break), then the logic of a comic book reading mind would deduce that there must be someone at the opposite end of the spectrum. Someone whose bones are unbreakable. Someone who doesn't get sick. Someone whose destiny is to utilize his or her powers to protect the rest of us.Elijah (a biblical reference to one who would pave the way for a savior) Price believes that he has found his opposite when a train crash outside Philadelphia kills everyone on board except for one man, who escapes totally unharmed. That man is David Dunn (Bruce Willis, with the double-sounding hero name like Peter Parker or Clark Kent), an ex-college football star who now works as a security guard at the local football stadium. One day, after the train wreck, David finds a note held under the windshield wiper of his car, and in it is scrawled a question that starts the true meaning of the film coming into focus: ""How many days of your life have you ever been sick?"" David makes it his mission to find out, and he makes some incredible discoveries along the way.M. Night Shyamalan does not disappoint his followers with this film. Sure, the film has its implausible moments, but that is more than forgivable, not just because of the believability of the Willis character, but because this film is, in essence, the first comic book movie that wasn't based on a comic book. The cinematography is outstanding, giving this movie the look and feel of those impossibilities that we love seeing in comics. Shyamalan shows he is quite an established shot-maker, the best I've seen since Spielberg and Sam Raimi, and he uses his music (composed by Maestro James Newton Howard) to accent every scene perfectly. And it wouldn't be an M. Night Shyamalan film without a surprise ending and some really clever sequences.&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is an uncommonly absorbing film that gripped me from beginning to end. The visual style is incredible, the characters are believable, and the acting is stellar. The ending, I thought, was rather tacked on, but nevertheless effective: It doesn't cheat. If I had to pick one movie star to be a superhero, it would be Bruce Willis. Why? Because he never fails to be cool in every single movie he does.",5,Shyamalan creates a terrific hero,988675200,"05 1, 2001",2001,3564,"['wake', 'up', 'rather', 'murky', 'setting', 'stretcher', 'beneath', 'creaks', 'weight', 'raise', 'sitting', 'position', 'curtains', 'are', 'mostly', 'closed', 'leaving', 'opening', 'size', 'small', 'door', 'other', 'side', 'see', 'man', 'lying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'completely', 'wrapped', 'bandages', 'growing', 'spot', 'red', 'man', 'hemorrhaging', 'die', 'Everything', 'kind', 'fuzzy', 'know', 'dying', 'man', 'were', 'victims', 'same', 'train', 'wreck', 'wrapped', 'up', 'mummy', 'quickly', 'approaching', 'death', 'look', ""n't"", 'scratch', 'you.The', 'idea', 'something', 'happening', 'series', 'thoughts', 'streak', 'mind', 'thoughts', 'captured', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'follow', 'up', 'masterful', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'quot', 'Unbreakable.', 'quot', 'think', 'have', 'answer', 'one', 'question', 'really', 'dig', 'guts', 'review', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'still', 'ridiculously', 'good.', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'world', 'possibilities', 'very', 'similar', 'comic', 'books', 'someone', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'world', 'horrific', 'disease', 'Osteogenesis', 'Imperfecta', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'bones', 'very', 'easy', 'break', 'then', 'logic', 'comic', 'book', 'reading', 'mind', 'would', 'deduce', 'must', 'be', 'someone', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Someone', 'bones', 'are', 'unbreakable', 'Someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'sick', 'Someone', 'destiny', 'utilize', 'powers', 'protect', 'rest', 'us.Elijah', 'biblical', 'reference', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'pave', 'way', 'savior', 'Price', 'found', 'opposite', 'when', 'train', 'crash', 'Philadelphia', 'everyone', 'board', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'totally', 'unharmed', 'man', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'double-sounding', 'hero', 'name', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'ex-college', 'football', 'star', 'who', 'now', 'security', 'guard', 'local', 'football', 'stadium', 'One', 'day', 'train', 'wreck', 'David', 'note', 'held', 'windshield', 'wiper', 'car', 'scrawled', 'question', 'true', 'meaning', 'film', 'coming', 'focus', 'How', 'many', 'days', 'life', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'sick', 'David', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'incredible', 'discoveries', 'way.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'not', 'disappoint', 'followers', 'film', 'Sure', 'film', 'implausible', 'moments', 'more', 'forgivable', 'not', 'just', 'believability', 'Willis', 'character', 'film', 'essence', 'first', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'giving', 'movie', 'look', 'feel', 'impossibilities', 'love', 'seeing', 'comics', 'Shyamalan', 'quite', 'established', 'shot-maker', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Spielberg', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'music', 'composed', 'Maestro', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'accent', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'surprise', 'ending', 'really', 'clever', 'sequences.', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'uncommonly', 'absorbing', 'film', 'gripped', 'beginning', 'end', 'visual', 'style', 'incredible', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'acting', 'stellar', 'ending', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'tacked', 'nevertheless', 'effective', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'had', 'pick', 'one', 'movie', 'star', 'be', 'superhero', 'would', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Why', 'never', 'be', 'cool', 'single', 'movie']",Unbreakable

From the dialogue to the pacing to, most importantly, the cinematography, the entire film moves, feels and sounds like it has come right off the neatly boxed pages of Stan Lee, et al.I was reminded of Shyamalan's superior ability in this regard after seeing ""A History of Violence"" just last night. Based on a graphic novel, the same aspects of ""Violence"" that have amateur reviewers (and some professionals) raving are the ones Shymalan did much earlier and much, much better. While we're talking about, comparisons to ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman"" would be worth discussing but ""Unbreakable"" goes where none of the specific adaptations could: into the ""real"" and generic world of the hero vs. villain. You could bring up ""Sin City"" in a conversation like this, but that film is remarkable for being on literally the opposite end of the spectrum: animation personified.""Unbreakable"" is a classic example of a movie written, designed and made to look and feel a very specific way.

He soley survives a fatal train wreck with nary a single scratch and, not long after, crosses paths with a shadowy stranger(the cleverly cast Samuel L.

532367,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00003CXQA,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 1]","One of the best thrillers of 2000, Unbreakable is writer/director M. Knight Shyamalan's follow up production to the 1998 blockbuster The Sixth Sense. Although not as phenomenally successful as that film, Unbreakable is nonetheless a memorable and suspense ridden picture certain to entertain. Shyamalan uses a unique comic book format to weave a tale of a superhero who fails to realize his own powers. But audiences won't confuse Unbreakable with Spiderman or Superman. The film isn't as one-dimensional with its characters, and the employment of special effects is not a focal point of the film. Instead, Unbreakable remains more of a mystery, thriller combination, and one that works well...Security Guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) makes headlines as the sole survivor of a massive train wreck which kills 130+ passengers. But not only does David survive the wreck, he emerges from the wreckage without a single scratch. Soon after, David is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), owner of a comic book art gallery and expert on the world of comics. Elijah suffers from a genetic disease which causes his bones to be extremely brittle. Confined in his home, Elijah's mother bought him comic books throughout his youth. Believing the comics to be a modern form of ancient storytelling describing the lives of real people of super-human abilities, Elijah postulates that David is one such person.The fanatical comic book lover produces evidence of David's survival of a car wreck twenty years earlier, his survival on the train, and his injury-free days as a star football player. As the polar-opposite of David, Elijah has been in search of such a person for his entire life. Now, he must convince David that he holds the aforementioned powers. As David comes to believe he holds the power of the 'unbreakable', he also develops an awareness of a special sense which gives him the ability to tell if someone has done, or is about to do, something sinister. As David comes to appreciate his special powers, the world around him crystallizes with a terrifying clarity...Featuring one of the better surprise endings of the decade, Unbreakable is one of the reasons Shyamalan's reputation has risen to such a lofty position in the world of film. Well-written and well-directed, M. Knight Shyamalan creates a brilliant follow up to The Sixth Sense with the dark and mysterious Unbreakable. Samuel L. Jackson plays his part well, employing the use of his penetrating stare and authoritative voice for maximum effect. Bruce Willis stars again in a role he knows well - that of the hero.Although it lacked the commercial success and Academy Award speculation of its forerunner, Unbreakable is nevertheless an entertaining film. Weaving a strange and exotic tale of two men who lead opposite lives in the physical realm, it makes deft use of cinematography and dripping suspense to leave its audience perched on the edge of curiosity. As a result, Unbreakable made a place for itself among the best films of 2000, and it definitely ranks as a must-see film...The DVD Report",4,Shyamalan shines again...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3075,"['One', 'best', 'thrillers', '2000', 'Unbreakable', 'writer/director', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'follow', 'up', 'production', '1998', 'blockbuster', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'not', 'phenomenally', 'successful', 'film', 'Unbreakable', 'nonetheless', 'memorable', 'suspense', 'ridden', 'picture', 'certain', 'entertain', 'Shyamalan', 'unique', 'comic', 'book', 'format', 'weave', 'tale', 'superhero', 'who', 'realize', 'own', 'powers', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'Unbreakable', 'Spiderman', 'Superman', 'film', ""n't"", 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'employment', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Instead', 'Unbreakable', 'more', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'combination', 'one', 'well', 'Security', 'Guard', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'headlines', 'sole', 'survivor', 'massive', 'train', 'wreck', '130+', 'passengers', 'not', 'only', 'David', 'survive', 'wreck', 'wreckage', 'single', 'scratch', 'Soon', 'David', 'approached', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'owner', 'comic', 'book', 'art', 'gallery', 'expert', 'world', 'comics', 'Elijah', 'suffers', 'genetic', 'disease', 'bones', 'be', 'extremely', 'brittle', 'Confined', 'home', 'Elijah', 'mother', 'bought', 'comic', 'books', 'youth', 'Believing', 'comics', 'be', 'modern', 'form', 'ancient', 'storytelling', 'describing', 'lives', 'real', 'people', 'super-human', 'abilities', 'Elijah', 'David', 'one', 'such', 'person.The', 'fanatical', 'comic', 'book', 'lover', 'evidence', 'David', 'survival', 'car', 'wreck', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'survival', 'train', 'injury-free', 'days', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'polar-opposite', 'David', 'Elijah', 'been', 'search', 'person', 'entire', 'life', 'Now', 'must', 'convince', 'David', 'aforementioned', 'powers', 'David', 'believe', 'power', ""'unbreakable"", 'also', 'awareness', 'special', 'sense', 'ability', 'tell', 'someone', 'done', 'do', 'something', 'sinister', 'David', 'appreciate', 'special', 'powers', 'world', 'terrifying', 'clarity', 'Featuring', 'one', 'better', 'surprise', 'endings', 'decade', 'Unbreakable', 'one', 'reasons', 'Shyamalan', 'reputation', 'risen', 'lofty', 'position', 'world', 'film', 'Well-written', 'well-directed', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'brilliant', 'follow', 'up', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'Unbreakable', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'part', 'well', 'employing', 'use', 'penetrating', 'stare', 'authoritative', 'voice', 'maximum', 'effect', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'again', 'role', 'well', 'hero.Although', 'lacked', 'commercial', 'success', 'Academy', 'Award', 'speculation', 'forerunner', 'Unbreakable', 'nevertheless', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Weaving', 'strange', 'exotic', 'tale', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'lead', 'opposite', 'lives', 'physical', 'realm', 'deft', 'use', 'cinematography', 'dripping', 'suspense', 'leave', 'audience', 'perched', 'edge', 'curiosity', 'result', 'Unbreakable', 'made', 'place', 'best', 'films', '2000', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",Unbreakable

532370,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00003CXQA,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 7]","I'm not usually a Bruce Willis fan by any means. I've read  though that whenever he had to audition for a role, early in his career, he literally blew hundreds of other actors out of the water with his audition.  I can believe he has that much talent based on this film and a few of his others.  Here you can see it with an end scene he has, with the boy who plays his son in this movie, when he shares a newspaper article with him at the breakfast table. It is good to see Willis recently not wasting such talent on abysmal films.  I've also been greatly disappointed by the junk movies Samuel L. Jackson has been in lately when his early roles showed such consummate ability.  Thus, both actors took me by considerable surprise playing the mirror images of one another in this film, starting with Willis's character's being the sole survivor of a train wreck.  Willis is all but unbreakable, like a superhero in a comic book, as he comes to discover with Jackson's help, whereas Jackson's bones  break so easily he was called &quot;Mr. Glass&quot; as a kid. Jackson now runs an art gallery which features comic book art.  Willis's character does not yet know his role in the universe whereas Jackson's seems to know the roles for both of them. Willis resists his theories mightily though.  Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan also made &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and I must credit him for having a wonderful imagination that doesn't just recycle and reuse Hollywood ideas already overused.  He also can make a gripping film without using explosions, car crashes, gunfire, blood and guts and the other, more usual action-adventure props. Shyamalan is fascinated by comic books as both art form and myth maker and brings that fascination home to us. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play Willis's wife and son. Shyamalan is very good at handling child actors in his films and Clark adds a lot to the story line with his belief in his father's powers. Robin Wright Penn is fast becoming the solid character actress upon whom directors can really rely.  They probably picked up on that fact from her husband's (Sean Penn) using her in his films to marvelous effect.",5,Not Expecting To Be As Good As 6th Sense &amp; Liked Even Better,994550400,"07 8, 2001",2001,2168,"[""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'fan', 'means', ""'ve"", 'read', 'whenever', 'had', 'audition', 'role', 'early', 'career', 'literally', 'blew', 'hundreds', 'other', 'actors', 'water', 'audition', 'can', 'believe', 'much', 'talent', 'based', 'film', 'few', 'others', 'Here', 'can', 'see', 'end', 'scene', 'boy', 'who', 'son', 'movie', 'when', 'shares', 'newspaper', 'article', 'breakfast', 'table', 'good', 'see', 'Willis', 'recently', 'not', 'wasting', 'such', 'talent', 'abysmal', 'films', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'junk', 'movies', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'been', 'lately', 'when', 'early', 'roles', 'showed', 'such', 'consummate', 'ability', 'Thus', 'actors', 'took', 'considerable', 'surprise', 'playing', 'mirror', 'images', 'one', 'film', 'starting', 'Willis', 'character', 'being', 'sole', 'survivor', 'train', 'wreck', 'Willis', 'unbreakable', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'discover', 'Jackson', 'help', 'Jackson', 'bones', 'break', 'so', 'easily', 'was', 'called', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'quot', 'kid', 'Jackson', 'now', 'art', 'gallery', 'comic', 'book', 'art', 'Willis', 'character', 'not', 'yet', 'know', 'role', 'universe', 'whereas', 'Jackson', 'know', 'roles', 'Willis', 'theories', 'mightily', 'Writer-director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'also', 'made', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'must', 'credit', 'having', 'wonderful', 'imagination', ""n't"", 'just', 'recycle', 'reuse', 'Hollywood', 'ideas', 'already', 'overused', 'also', 'can', 'make', 'gripping', 'film', 'using', 'explosions', 'car', 'crashes', 'gunfire', 'blood', 'guts', 'other', 'more', 'usual', 'action-adventure', 'props', 'Shyamalan', 'fascinated', 'comic', 'books', 'art', 'form', 'myth', 'maker', 'fascination', 'home', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'play', 'Willis', 'wife', 'son', 'Shyamalan', 'very', 'good', 'handling', 'child', 'actors', 'films', 'Clark', 'lot', 'story', 'line', 'belief', 'father', 'powers', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'fast', 'becoming', 'solid', 'character', 'actress', 'whom', 'directors', 'can', 'really', 'rely', 'probably', 'picked', 'up', 'fact', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'using', 'films', 'marvelous', 'effect']",Unbreakable

Our culture is bereft of Heroes and we're offered, in the best comic book tradition, a wary, unwilling, unwitting hero. Willis's performance in this film (as it was in The Sixth Sense) is just a splendidly controlled one; and Jackson, as always, is never less than completely watchable. As the ultimate &quot;breakable&quot; man, Jackson is angry, inscrutable, and brilliant.The director has a wonderful feel for children, for their fears and sensitivities; and Spencer Treat Clark turns in a fine performance as Willis's son, as does Robin Wright Penn as his long-suffering wife.Ninety percent of this film is highly compelling. The viewer anxiously, eagerly accompanies Willis along the path to recognition of his &quot;super&quot; powers, at the urging of cartoon connoisseur Jackson. We arrive at a satisfactory climax where our hero's powers get tested. It's a strong, chilling sequence. And then, splat, the whole thing falls to pieces with an entirely unbelievable ending. Sadly, it's all too obvious that the director, M. Night Shyamalan, just couldn't think of a viable resolution for the tale he'd constructed.

532376,A2ZDGC1S2QZFU0,B00003CXQA,Chris Jothi,"[6, 8]","Unbreakable is a revelation in commercial filmmaking. The director, M.Night Shyamalan aimed to combine art house flamboyance with mainstream sensibilities, and as a result has made one of the most misunderstood and underrated films of the last decade.The film possesses a strict style. It is slowly paced, acted with a subdued ambiguity and shot in a cold and obstinate manor. Kubrick's visual legacy lives on in every frame of this film.I love the fact that most critic's disregarded it as a pretentious experiment. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Lost Weekend were poorly reviewed for the same reason upon release but are now considered masterpieces. Unbreakable will begin to be realised for what it truly is; a complex, multi-faceted allegory. It poses one of the hardest questions we could ever ask ourselves: 'what was I put on this earth to do?'For ninety-eight minutes Bruce Willis is on a voyage like Travis Bickle, searching for his identity, wanting to make a change in his life and the world that surrounds him.Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as David Dunn, a man whose potential has not yet been realised. Willis may continue to make average action films but every now and again he reminds us all of his acting talents. Obviously this performance was TOO good for the Academy. Robin Wright Penn and Sam Jackson excel in their parts, but ultimately this is Willis's show.Unbreakable continues to be a rewarding cinematic experience. I respect the director for his intelligence but also his courage to make an atypical Hollywood movie that holds up the mirror to our souls and begs us to ask the same question.The DVD itself is a combination of disappoinments and surprises. The picture and sound quality is exceptional, putting other film transfers (i.e. Shawshank and The Godfather) to shame. The cinematography and musical score are equally sublime and it is fitting that this DVD does its best to showcase that....This featurette reveals new aspects of the film that I never noticed before. It entertained and informed me, which really makes this an excellent piece of material to watch.The ""Comic Book and Superheroes Documentary"" is flat out brilliant. We learn about the conventions of villains, heroes and the themes in comic books. It illuminates Unbreakable to the point where you watch the film in an entirely new perspective.Then you have the seven deleted scenes. The director introduces each one and explains why they were removed from the final cut. The quality of both the scenes and introductions are first-rate, and reveals just how good a filmmaker Shyamalan is.Then there is ""An Excerpt From a Childhood Film of M. Night Shyamalan"" It is so charming to see a director at the age of ten (or whatever) making his own short film. It of course is terrible but is now all the more significant considering where that young boy is today.The ""Train Station Sequence with Multi-Angle Feature & Sound Mix"" is kinda cool. We have seen it with the Seven and Fight Club DVDs. It reveals the effect sound has on images, and also the opportunity to see the scene drawn out in storyboards shows just how professional Hollywood can be!Ultimately though what is lacking is a filmmakers' commentary. Like Spielberg, Shyamalan does not like commentating on his films which is fair enough, but surely this did not stop the other cast and crew members from commenting on the production. Commentaries are the most valued and significant extras any DVD can offer, and it really is a shame not to find at least one on this ""Special Edition"" DVD. Quite frankly I would have preferred a commentary to the gorgeous packaging and 2 Collectable Alex Ross Illustrations.",5,In ten years this film will be seen as a masterpiece,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,3670,"['Unbreakable', 'revelation', 'commercial', 'filmmaking', 'director', 'M.Night', 'Shyamalan', 'aimed', 'combine', 'art', 'house', 'flamboyance', 'mainstream', 'sensibilities', 'result', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'misunderstood', 'underrated', 'films', 'last', 'decade.The', 'film', 'strict', 'style', 'slowly', 'paced', 'acted', 'subdued', 'ambiguity', 'shot', 'cold', 'obstinate', 'manor', 'Kubrick', 'visual', 'legacy', 'lives', 'frame', 'film.I', 'love', 'fact', 'most', 'critic', 'disregarded', 'pretentious', 'experiment', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'were', 'poorly', 'reviewed', 'same', 'reason', 'release', 'are', 'now', 'considered', 'masterpieces', 'Unbreakable', 'will', 'begin', 'be', 'realised', 'what', 'truly', 'complex', 'multi-faceted', 'allegory', 'one', 'hardest', 'questions', 'could', 'ever', 'ask', 'ourselves', 'was', 'put', 'earth', 'do', ""'For"", 'ninety-eight', 'minutes', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'voyage', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'searching', 'identity', 'wanting', 'make', 'change', 'life', 'world', 'him.Bruce', 'Willis', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'David', 'Dunn', 'man', 'potential', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'realised', 'Willis', 'may', 'continue', 'make', 'average', 'action', 'films', 'now', 'again', 'acting', 'talents', 'Obviously', 'performance', 'was', 'TOO', 'good', 'Academy', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'excel', 'parts', 'ultimately', 'Willis', 'show.Unbreakable', 'be', 'rewarding', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'respect', 'director', 'intelligence', 'also', 'courage', 'make', 'atypical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'up', 'mirror', 'souls', 'begs', 'ask', 'same', 'question.The', 'DVD', 'combination', 'disappoinments', 'surprises', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'exceptional', 'putting', 'other', 'film', 'transfers', 'i.e', 'Shawshank', 'Godfather', 'shame', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'score', 'are', 'equally', 'sublime', 'fitting', 'DVD', 'best', 'showcase', 'featurette', 'reveals', 'new', 'aspects', 'film', 'never', 'noticed', 'entertained', 'informed', 'really', 'excellent', 'piece', 'material', 'watch.The', 'Comic', 'Book', 'Superheroes', 'Documentary', 'flat', 'out', 'brilliant', 'learn', 'conventions', 'villains', 'heroes', 'themes', 'comic', 'books', 'Unbreakable', 'point', 'where', 'watch', 'film', 'entirely', 'new', 'perspective.Then', 'have', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'one', 'why', 'were', 'removed', 'final', 'cut', 'quality', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'are', 'first-rate', 'reveals', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'Shyamalan', 'is.Then', 'Excerpt', 'Childhood', 'Film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'so', 'charming', 'see', 'director', 'age', 'ten', 'making', 'own', 'short', 'film', 'course', 'terrible', 'now', 'more', 'significant', 'considering', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'today.The', 'Train', 'Station', 'Sequence', 'Multi-Angle', 'Feature', 'Sound', 'Mix', 'kinda', 'cool', 'have', 'seen', 'Seven', 'Fight', 'Club', 'DVDs', 'effect', 'sound', 'images', 'also', 'opportunity', 'see', 'scene', 'drawn', 'out', 'storyboards', 'shows', 'just', 'how', 'professional', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'lacking', 'filmmakers', 'commentary', 'Spielberg', 'Shyamalan', 'not', 'commentating', 'films', 'fair', 'enough', 'surely', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'other', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'commenting', 'production', 'Commentaries', 'are', 'most', 'valued', 'significant', 'extras', 'DVD', 'can', 'offer', 'really', 'shame', 'not', 'find', 'least', 'one', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'commentary', 'gorgeous', 'packaging', '2', 'Collectable', 'Alex', 'Ross', 'Illustrations']",Unbreakable

532383,A3C92MFCGLHDBQ,B00003CXQA,Clay,"[0, 1]","THE FILM: Unbreakable, directed by M. Night Shyalaman very, very hard to rate- the plot is original , but it moves so slowly that I would barely give the movie a three out of five. It just really isn't all that interesting- maybe if someone had paced it faster, Unbreakable would be great. Some good points are the acting: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn all do GREAT jobs, they're really believable as would-be-normal people put in strange situations. They really gave this movie a boost, although they alone weren't enough to save it completely. The idea of Unbreakable is simple: a man(Samuel L. Jackson)has the thought that if some people have disorders that make them fall ill easily, couldn't others be strong, virtually invincible? The idea is captivating, but the story is stretched out too far for it's own good.SPECIAL FEATURES: Yes, this DVD is part of the Vista Series- wouldn't you think there would be a few decent special features, then?

532384,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00003CXQA,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","How do you follow up a massive success? It's been a question long asked with certain filmmakers. How can James Cameron top Titanic, which is still the top money-making movie ever(not counting old movies and inflation). And George Lucas will pretty much be that Star Wars dude. Upstart director M Night Shyamalan came out with The Sixth Sense, an intriguing thriller with one of the best and well-known twist endings in existence. So how do you follow it up? Make something similar.A train derails and causes a huge disaster killing everyone. That is except for one: David Dunn, a security guard working at a stadium. The kicker is: not only did he survive but he didn't even get scratched, hurt, a headache or anything. This attracts the interest of a comic book enthusiast Elijah Price who gets David's attention by asking a simple question: how many times have you been sick? Turns out David can't and he can potentially be what Elijah's been looking for: a real-life comic book hero.The trailer was probably the most interesting thing about the film. Someone stumbles upon an immunity to pain and injury and we're trying to figure out how he does it. It comes out and it mentions comic books. Like subsequent films The Village and Lady in the Water, Unbreakable was an intriguing premise until it steers off in other directions. What is here though is intriguing regardless. I always was fascinated by mythology and special abilities that comic books can bring so of course, me and my nerdness gravitated towards this. The only thing is that it might be unintentionally funny. When David is told that something is like his kryptonite it's kind of like ""oh, boy"".The one thing that makes this different is that unlike the others which had character moments interspersed with full-on thriller scenes, this gears into more drama and character stuff. For some, it's a great change of pace rather than relying on scary stuff and spooks but for others it's kind of tedious and slow. The one thing that irks me though is that there's a bit too much flashyness with the camera. The camera is upside-down, reflected in mirrors, shot through that sliver of space in seats. Now granted Shyamalan is one of the few that knows where to put his camera but at times it's like ""quit showing off, man"".Performances-wise it's good all around. Bruce still talks in that kind of I-sound-super-bored voice that he always has and Robin and Spencer are good in their respective roles, a highlight scene being a little confrontation at the dinner table. Samuel L. Jackson comes in and of course acts awesome but with a haircut like a run-in with an angry blow-dryer and full pimpness complete with cane, it comes a bit close to campy. You can almost imagine characters to go ""smack!"" or ""zop!"" when someone gets punched.In terms of where his films stand, this is either everybody's least favorite(or the Village) or it's underrated and we just don't get it. I'm more in the middle.

532391,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00003CXQA,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 3]","Beings that M. Nights new movie 'Lady in the Water' is released today I decided to take a look at his previous films.  I've already reviewed 'The Sixth Sense' and anyone who knows me knows that I hold that film in the highest regard, as one of the best 'ghost' films for it's smart script and excellent direction, not to mention the chemistry between Haley and Bruce.  Now I have always been a diehard Willis fan so I was excited when I first saw 'Unbreakable'.  I was expecting another 'Sixth Sense' type vibe but what I recieved was something much different.  As everyone knows, I feel that Night has done no better than 'Sixth Sense' and I fear he never will BUT 'Unbreakable' is a very close second for many reasons.First of all, the film is far from scary, but it has very dark tones.  The entire film is directed in dark lights with eeire music and the characters are haunted by the way their life is going.  Willis plays David Dunn a man whose struggling to make his life work.  He works as a security guard and is trapped in a marriage falling apart.  The opening scene has David on a train travelling home from a job interview and he is seated next to a beautiful woman.  Just watching his character remove his wedding band and then, almost awkwardly, proceed to put the moves on this woman says a lot.  You can see the state his character is in.Moments later the news is on and Davids son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) realizes that the train his father was on has just crashed.  Come to find out his father is the sole survivor of that crash and he hasn't even suffered a scratch.  To everyone they shrug it off as coincidence, even Davids wife (played brilliantly by Robin Wright Penn) but as time passes and a strange man (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes that David may in fact be a superhero.This may sound far fetched, but come on, if we'll go see 'X-Men' or 'Superman Returns' then we can get with the program.  This is just a superhero movie for adults.  But here's what makes this movie so great to me.  This is not about being a superhero as much as it is about becomeing a superhero.  This film revolves around a man not sure of who he is or what he is for that matter and his unwillingness to believe he's more than normal, but once he does realize then it all starts to make sense...for David it all starts to make sense.You'll see that once he starts to take responsibility for himself, knowing what he needs to do and doing something about it his whole life takes a turn for the better.  This is going on the theme that many of us are unhappy with our lives because we're unhappy or unsure of ourselves.  Once David realized who he was he knew he had purpose...much greater purpose than to be a security guard who once had dreams of something greater (we see in flashbacks that David had dreams to once be a pro-football player but due to an injury...wink/wink...he gave it all up).  Knowing he had a place made him whole, made him happy, and made him see that what he had was what he wanted.The entire cast is superb, Willis especially, and the story and direction is Shyamalan at his best.  Yes, since 'The Sixth Sense' Night has slipped from a lot of people's lists and has somewhat become concidered a dissapointment (I think this is mostly due to poor advertising), but when looked at properly he really is a magnificent storyteller.  The final frames will leave you breathless and will send shockwaves down your spine.

532394,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXQA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 9]","Ah yes, here we have another example of the ""genius"" of M. Night Shyamalan, the writer/director with the uncanny ability to take a silly, fantastical story and transform it into a film that is - well, silly and fantastical.  And patronizing, as well.  The Sixth Sense was a great movie, but viewings of Lady in the Water and Unbreakable have me convinced that Shyamalan is the most overrated filmmaker to come along in years.  Unbreakable is just a bad movie, pure and simple, but what makes it ever so much agonizingly more unbearable is Shyamalan's ""holier than thou"" approach to filmmaking.  He can't put together a single scene without going all artsy-fartsy on us, as if his films are just too important for anything resembling normal cinematic techniques.  He gives us panoramic views of characters for no apparent reason, overdramatizes even the most mundane of scenes by showing the film in  time (actually, knowing Shyamalan, it's probably something like 0.7893834343 time), and oftentimes foregoes the use of background music in his far too numerous ""let's just pause right here for about five minutes"" character shots.  Thus it is that Unbreakable, a film largely inspired by comic books, is presented as if it's a cinematic masterpiece of life-changing proportions.  Well, it isn't.Here's the down and dirty description of Unbreakable.  Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a seemingly ordinary guy who just so happens to walk away unscathed from a train wreck that killed everyone else on board.  Soon thereafter, he is covertly contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), an avowed comic book collector and dealer in comic ""art"" who tries to tell him he's some kind of modern-day superhero.  Apparently, Elijah, who was born with a defect that made his bones incredibly brittle and easy to break, has spent all of his adult life seeking a real-life comic book superhero.  David blows the guy off but soon begins thinking back on his life.  The first thing he does is to try and figure out if he has ever been sick or injured.  Now you would think any sane person could answer that question himself - if you've ever been really sick, you're going to remember it, and if you've never been sick or injured over the course of multiple decades, you're going to have picked up on that fact at some point long ago.  Eventually, Elijah gets under David's skin, which leads us up to the film's final scenes.  These crucial moments in the film ought to generate cinematic fireworks, but they don't.  I looked for some excitement, and there was just none to be found.As I've indicated, I thought the storyline was pretty silly (but not as silly as that of Lady in the Water), but an equally serious problem is the lack of any chemistry whatsoever between any of the main characters, especially David and his wife and son.  Apparently, I was supposed to care about the fate of their troubled marriage - but I didn't.  I didn't even care if David lived or died, to tell you the truth.  And his son was just annoying.  Now, you do get the vintage Shyamalan twist at the very end, but the effort required to sit through this movie all the way to the end greatly exceeds the payoff of that ""surprise.""  I haven't seen all of Shyamalan's films yet, so maybe there is still some hope for him, but the evidence is definitely mounting that The Sixth Sense was a one-hit wonder for this filmmaker.",2,A better title would have been Shyamalan: Unbearable,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,3387,"['Ah', 'yes', 'here', 'have', 'example', 'genius', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'writer/director', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'take', 'silly', 'fantastical', 'story', 'transform', 'film', 'well', 'silly', 'fantastical', 'patronizing', 'as', 'well', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'viewings', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Unbreakable', 'have', 'convinced', 'Shyamalan', 'most', 'overrated', 'filmmaker', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'Unbreakable', 'just', 'bad', 'movie', 'pure', 'simple', 'what', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'agonizingly', 'more', 'unbearable', 'Shyamalan', 'holier', 'thou', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'single', 'scene', 'going', 'artsy-fartsy', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'important', 'anything', 'resembling', 'normal', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'panoramic', 'views', 'characters', 'apparent', 'reason', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'scenes', 'showing', 'film', 'time', 'actually', 'knowing', 'Shyamalan', 'probably', 'something', '0.7893834343', 'time', 'oftentimes', 'foregoes', 'use', 'background', 'music', 'far', 'too', 'numerous', 'let', 'just', 'pause', 'right', 'here', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'character', 'shots', 'Thus', 'Unbreakable', 'film', 'largely', 'inspired', 'comic', 'books', 'presented', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'life-changing', 'proportions', 'Well', 'down', 'dirty', 'description', 'Unbreakable', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'David', 'Dunn', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'walk', 'away', 'unscathed', 'train', 'wreck', 'killed', 'everyone', 'else', 'board', 'Soon', 'thereafter', 'covertly', 'contacted', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'avowed', 'comic', 'book', 'collector', 'dealer', 'comic', 'art', 'who', 'tell', 'kind', 'modern-day', 'superhero', 'Apparently', 'Elijah', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'defect', 'made', 'bones', 'incredibly', 'brittle', 'easy', 'break', 'spent', 'adult', 'life', 'seeking', 'real-life', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'David', 'guy', 'off', 'soon', 'thinking', 'back', 'life', 'first', 'thing', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'ever', 'been', 'sick', 'injured', 'Now', 'would', 'think', 'sane', 'person', 'could', 'answer', 'question', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'really', 'sick', ""'re"", 'going', 'remember', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'sick', 'injured', 'course', 'multiple', 'decades', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'fact', 'point', 'long', 'ago', 'Eventually', 'Elijah', 'David', 'skin', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'crucial', 'moments', 'film', 'ought', 'generate', 'cinematic', 'fireworks', 'do', ""n't"", 'looked', 'excitement', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'none', 'be', 'found.As', ""'ve"", 'indicated', 'thought', 'storyline', 'was', 'pretty', 'silly', 'not', 'as', 'silly', 'Lady', 'Water', 'equally', 'serious', 'problem', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'David', 'wife', 'son', 'Apparently', 'was', 'supposed', 'care', 'fate', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'David', 'lived', 'died', 'tell', 'truth', 'son', 'was', 'just', 'annoying', 'Now', 'do', 'get', 'vintage', 'Shyamalan', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'effort', 'required', 'sit', 'movie', 'way', 'end', 'greatly', 'payoff', 'surprise', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'yet', 'maybe', 'still', 'hope', 'evidence', 'definitely', 'mounting', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'filmmaker']",Unbreakable

The ...reviewer has a lot of nerve to call the story ""bordering on the juvenile""; while it is, of course, fantastic, juvenile would be garbage like ""Armageddon.""  While this isn't ""Watchmen"", it is a perfect distillation of what comic books mean to those who read them and the pure sense of hope they can offer.Yes, I said hope.  If you really need it spelled out, you should see another underappreciated film, ""The Iron Giant.""  But if you're impatient, I can only explain it this way; as any regular reader of comics knows, the best comics and characters give us something to aspire to, to be just, true, and a protector of those who cannot protect themselves.  Comics are an uniquely American creation, but the characters strike a deep human chord.  A story my dad likes to tell is of a friend in the Peace Corps; he went to a village in the West Indies that was incredibly isolated, couldn't get radio stations, had almost no technology.  He walked into a clearing...and there, carved out of a whole tree, was a statue of Superman.I've seen the photos.  It's a really inspiring sight, and it's something I suspect MNS heard about, because he tapped into it deeply with ""Unbreakable.""  His character of David Dunn is denying what he is to such a degree it's destroying his marriage, his relationship with his son and folding him into himself, rendering him number with each passing day.

532397,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00003CXQA,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[5, 7]","Life is not a comic book, and Superman doesn't exist.There are no caped crusaders, no black-cloaked night-defying vigilantes serving as unseen sentinels of Truth, Order, and Justice, watching over the harried commuter as the literal incarnation of the better angels of our Nature. The City out there has teeth and claws: you're going to get in trouble, and when you do, no one is going to come to your rescue.You see that weaselly, wizened, bespectacled clerk across the aisle from us on the train? That's the one, you got him pegged---looks like Clark Kent, doesn't he? Now, when that wild-eyed guy three rows down from him opens up his trenchcoat to reveal an AK-47 and makes the 6PM rush-hour express his personal butcher-shop, Clark Kent is going to stay just that---weaselly, bespectacled Clark Kent. No phone booth transformation for him, no salvation for you and me and our fellow passengers. Nope, he's going to scream, and try to run, and die Clark Kent, along with you and me.In our world, men and women die meanginglessly every day: in traffic pile-ups, in air disasters, pushed on the subway tracks by anonymous madmen, who later disappear in the crowd. There is no Superman; there never was, there never will be. Or will there? M. Night Shyamalan leads us right down that particular rabbit hole in the eerily profound and deeply moving ""Unbreakable"", his meditation about the meaning of a superhero in a callow age.Case in point: Security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is riding home on the train from a Manhattan job interview (he didn't get an offer---see?---real life). He checks out his seatmate; yeah he's married---but it's a bad marriage, dying a day at a time---and she's lithe, tall, slender, good facial structure. She stows her carry-on in the overhead bin, and as she does her shirt rides up, revealing a black rose tattoo. Nice.They make small-talk; she's a sports-agent on her way to meet with a rising young football star; in the football spirit, David Dunn makes a pass---and fumbles. She gets creeped out and takes a seat a few rows down. A minute later the train shakes, there's a high keening noise, another furious bump---the bad kind, the Something is Very Wrong kind---and the train derails.Everyone aboard dies. Everyone except David Dunn, who walks away from the steaming, smoldering carnage without a scratch.Shellshocked, baffled, confused, he attends the church service for the dead; staggering outside, he finds a glossy invitation---with a cryptic phrase---to a Philadelphia art gallery affixed to his windshield.That leads him to reclusive art dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson, who along with Willis carries this movie with poise and presence), taunted as ""Mr. Glass"" by his erstwhile classmates, sufferer of a rare bone disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a real disease): the slightest stress can snap his bones to splinters.In turn, we meet Elijah's true life's work: reasoning that if a man of Glass could exist the Bell Curve of human genetics would also feature a Man of Steel, he has spent years sifting through horrific accidents for survivors--and more importantly, for that one man in a million who could be a Superhero.Just as with ghosts and werewolves and vampires, you can deal every day with arguments against---but it only takes one true positive to change the world. And in David Dunn, Elijah feels he has found his Positive.Dunn isn't having any of it: besides, he has tons of evidence why he's not a comic book hero: he's just a GUY---dead-end job, marriage on the rocks, and he's not invulnerable---hell, as a rising young college football star, he was injured in a nasty car accident---with his then girlfriend and now wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn)---that injured his legs and ended his football career.The superficial have called Shyamalan a great many things: a spooky director, a horror director, a 'twist' director---but in fact, M. Night has really always been interested in probing the Human Soul, and has tilted at a wide range of genres---Alien invasion, Ghosts, Monsters in the Woods, Superheroes---to dig into the human condition. What makes us tick. What distinguishes us from the animals. Our Gods, our night terrors, our inspirations. Knowledge---of reality, of self, of destiny---comes at a price. And as this strangely sedate, moody piece winds its way to culmination, we find that Dunn's price is extraordinary frightening---and severe.Shyamalan serves ""Unbreakable"" up as a warped riff on the superhero origin story: the initial reluctance and bewilderment on the part of the crime-fighter, the secret identity, the strange ellipitical orbit of superhero and supervillain. His directing here is restrained and reticent, and this restraint is given fuller effect by cinematographer Eduaro Serra, who casts everything through a blue filter than enhances the moodiness, uncertainty, and depression.Finally, M. Night proves again that he's an actor's director: this moodpiece is brought off nicely by essentially four actors: Willis playing it with brooding---but hopeful---understatement as David Dunn; Jackson serving as perfect sounding board, foil, and fencing master for the reluctant hero Dunn; and Robin Wright Penn (Audrey) and Spencer Treat Clark bringing up the rear as the dubious wife and adoring son.Not a flashy, gangbusting epic like Spider-Man, ""Unbreakable"" is no less a moody, thoughtful treatment of the Origin Story---no less so because Shyamalan is wrestling with the hero within all of us. Prepare to be have your emotions broken---prepare to be shaken.JSG",5,Man of Steel.

I would argue that, that movie energized the surprise ending theme. And so shamalamadingdong saw that and said WOW that's amazing i'm going to make all my movies have a twist ending because it's awesome! Now, here's the difference: if you watch all of the usual suspects EXCEPT the surprise ending, it's still a great movie.

I will be the first to admit that there was no way that M. Night Shyamalan could have caught lightning in the bottle with this film.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a phenomenon and audience expectations were too high for this film.  I remember this film had a targeted Thanksgiving release date and it was probably rushed to theatres before the kinks in the story could have been ironed out.  It's obvious from the get-go where the story was going and the abrupt ending didn't help matters.  All that aside, I like this film alot.  Shyamalan is a master at mood and developing tension and it is apparent in this film.  Shyamalan does not so much copy the masters(Hitchcock and Spielberg) but pay homage to them.

532401,A36L1F0YECOAW8,B00003CXQA,David Grant,"[2, 2]","Like his previous film 'The Sixth Sense', writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' begins with a simple mystery then slowly peels back layer after layer until it reaches an emotional, startling conclusion.  David Dunn, a security guard, is returning home from a job interview in New York when his train derails. Several hundred people are killed but he survives, unharmed, not a scratch on him. A few days later he attends a memorial service for the deceased passengers. When he leaves he finds a note under the windshield wiper of his car. It reads 'When was the last time you were sick?' Funny thing is - David doesn't remember the last time he had so much as a cold. He visits the man who wrote him that letter, an art dealer and comic collector named Elijah, a man stricken with a genetic disease which makes his bones as brittle and weak as glass. A man with a rather unbelievable theory as to why David's bones don't break, why he has never been ill, and why he survived that horrible train wreck.  All the players are excellent. Bruce Willis continues to shine under Shaymalan's direction, providing a strong emotional pull with his portrayal of David. And Samuel L. Jackson's Elijah is tragic and mysterious. But the real star of the show is Shaymalan himself who once again crafts a masterpiece of mystery and suspense, showing his remarkable restraint and patience. This film does wrap itself up nicely, with a great twist ending but it definitely ends too soon and too quickly. But after watching it, after you realize what you've just seen happen on the screen, you'll understand completely.  For a two DVD set, this is remarkably light on extras. Unfortunately there is no commentary track. And the two featurettes run a scant fifteen minutes each and neither do anything but scratch the surface of their subjects. The ability to watch the amazing train sequence of the film in both it's storyboard and film representations is nice though and does give the viewer a good idea of just how much time went into plotting the film's look and feel. All in all this is a good package of a great film. Fans of 'The Sixth Sense' should feel right at home.",4,M.

Purples, blacks and blues are all strong.  The comic book art that decorates a number of settings pops.  There are cool subtleties now visible in Samuel Jackson's clothing that I had not noticed before on the DVD.

532403,A1T9YSDAYS097M,B00003CXQA,D. Bannister,"[0, 0]",Unbreakable followed on the heals of M. Night Shyamalan's big hit Sixth Sense. I had seen Sixth Sense on video and disliked it immensely but decided that I would try Unbreakable on DVD.The movie exceeds Sixth Sense in almost every way. Willis and Jackson give superb performances and the supporting cast is wonderful. Some reviews have commented on the lack of action. I thought the suspense more than made up for the lack of murder and mayhem. For me movies that depend heavily on a child actor succeed or fail largely on that basis for nothing is worse than suffering through a child's poor performance. Here Spencer Treat Clark who plays Willis' son does a magnificient job and adds signficantly to the movie's success.You really can't talk about the plot in Unbreakable without ruining the ending. The very fact that it can be given away may preclude its purchase because some people only need to see a coin disappear once. However the film is so finely constructed that I am pleased that it is now a part of my DVD collection.Unbreakable while sharing many attributes of Sixth Sense is not the same movie and from my perspective that makes it a fine and worthwhile movie to watch and own.,4,Not Sixth Sense and that is a good thing,993600000,"06 27, 2001",2001,1193,"['Unbreakable', 'followed', 'heals', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'big', 'hit', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'had', 'seen', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'video', 'disliked', 'immensely', 'decided', 'would', 'try', 'Unbreakable', 'DVD.The', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'almost', 'way', 'Willis', 'Jackson', 'give', 'superb', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'reviews', 'have', 'commented', 'lack', 'action', 'thought', 'suspense', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'lack', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'movies', 'depend', 'heavily', 'child', 'actor', 'succeed', 'fail', 'largely', 'basis', 'nothing', 'worse', 'suffering', 'child', 'poor', 'performance', 'Here', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'who', 'Willis', 'son', 'magnificient', 'job', 'signficantly', 'movie', 'success.You', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'plot', 'Unbreakable', 'ruining', 'ending', 'very', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'away', 'may', 'preclude', 'purchase', 'people', 'only', 'need', 'see', 'coin', 'disappear', 'once', 'However', 'film', 'so', 'finely', 'constructed', 'am', 'pleased', 'now', 'part', 'DVD', 'collection.Unbreakable', 'sharing', 'many', 'attributes', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'not', 'same', 'movie', 'perspective', 'fine', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'watch', 'own']",Unbreakable

532407,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00003CXQA,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[19, 29]","Like most of Shyamalan's films, ""Unbreakable"" begins beautifully and cryptically. David (Bruce Willis), returning home to Philadelphia from a job interview in New York, survives - without a scratch - a horrific train wreck that kills everyone else.  He is tracked down by Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who suffers from a rare brittle bone disease that has left him crippled. Elijah proposes a reason for David's survival as well as his own breakable bones that gives David the creeps.  David wants nothing to do with this man whom he views as insane and who is, perhaps, a threat to his son.  Yet as events unfold, David cannot escape the idea Elijah has planted.Willis' understated delivery is perfect for Shyamalan's style of cinematic suspense. Robin Wright Penn and Samuel L. Jackson follow suit with lines delivered so delicately and with such restraint that they contribute to the tension. The cinematography is brilliant, setting the mood with aplomb.  The strength of ""Unbreakable"" is not the plot but the relationships between characters - their dreams and disappointments, what keeps these people together and what threatens to break them apart.The main flaw of the movie is the last fifteen minutes, when the revelation, which is clearly meant to blow the audience away, arrives with a flatness that will disappoint many people.  I, for one, saw it coming - and hoped I was wrong.  Or that Shyamalan would do something extraordinary with it.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.

532408,A1AEDW75371P5M,B00003CXQA,Dellin Canfield (dellincanfield@hotmail.com),"[2, 3]","Unbreakable gives us another strong performance from Bruce Willis.  Although almost no critics have mentioned it, Bruce Willis is actually a tremendous actor.  You have only to watch Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys for further proof of that.  He has cultivated that sort of action star persona that has worked extremely well in the Die Hard movies, but Willis' talents far exceed that of his genre colleges such as Jean-Claude and Arnold.  Even the Die Hard movies should be clear indications of what a talent Willis actually is--Die Hard does not follow the conventions of an action movie at all (John McClean seems like more of an everyman than a superhero) yet the film is much more effective than most action films.  Similarly, Unbreakable plays with Willis' pseudo-hero, mostly regular guy, reputation.  In Unbreakable, Willis' plays an ex-football player who is the only survivor of a disasterous train wreck.  Samuel L. Jackson plays the slightly odd comic book collector who tries to convice Willis that he is in fact a superhero.  The film is different because of how down-to-earth willis is.  Rather than whoop for joy over his new potential powers, he seems awestruck and concerned over the implications this might have on his everyday life.  This film takes great efforts to examine the mind of, not only the idealized superheros we've all grown up admiring, but the connections to the real-life people who must have inspired these stories (think of the real life people who must have inspired Beowulf or even King Arthur).  One of the interesting ideas is that through the flattering exaguration, the human conflict of these inspiring people is totally lost.  The question then is, is their life experience rendered meaningless? Unbreakable is sure to keep you on your toes because it is so much different than any movie that has come before.  It doesn't try to hit you over the head with dazzling special effects or exagurated tales of human accomplishment, rather it goes at it from the human emotional side, a track that is often overlooked but equally powerful.  It may seem absurd to take comic book heros and examine their problems as though they were real people, but this movie walks the tightrope with a deft step and the results are wonderful.  Holding together the entire film is Willis' believeable performance witch is both powerful and heartbreaking.

The scene into the train with Willis (David Dunn) talking to the girl close to him is memorable, as some dialogs with his wife (almost ex-wife).The discovering of Willis' great powers with the aid of Jackson's (Elijah Price) knowledge of the world of comics is somewhat confusing, but the way we start to &quot;know things&quot; is correct. However, the scene of the son pointing his father with a gun is absolutely insignificant and out of context.The real good thing is to see Willis and Jackson far from &quot;what-they-used-to-do&quot; in late 80's.I was given advice of the absurdity of the end, but I don't think it's absurd, nave or even stupid.

532410,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXQA,D. Litton,"[2, 5]","M. Night Shyamalan struck a gold mine when his film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was released in 1999, bringing in overwhelming audiences and garnering Oscar nominations including a nod for Best Picture. It is one of the films that will go down in history, not so much as a movie like, for instance, &quot;Titanic,&quot; but still will be remembered.&quot;Unbreakable,&quot; his follow-up feature to that success, didn't do as good as its predecessor, and upon watching it for the first time, I can't understand why. There are elements at work throughout its discourse that, under Shyamalan's brilliant direction, fit together in an intricate puzzle that comes to an earth-shattering halt with the film's ending. It's a brilliant and complex piece of filmmaking.Like &quot;Sense,&quot; this film contains a mystery surrounding a central character, though this one isn't haunted by ghosts who need favors. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; begins with a horrific train accident, seen only through television footage and through the gauze of the last dying passenger as the sole survivor, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), looks on in a dazed silence. There is no scene of gory bloodshed, no sequence of special effects or derailing train cars... Shyamalan is able to prove that, through visceral images of victims' relatives and their expressions, the devastation of such an event can be just as effective without the use of a special effect.As the story continues, more pieces of David's life come into play: his marriage is suffering, he goes into deep depression, and that, added to questions he has about the fact that he suffered no injuries, not even so much as a single scratch, plague him each day. His work as a security guard seems like any other job to him, until he meets a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that comic book heroes walk the Earth.Elijah's life also has many complications: he suffers from a disease which causes his bones to break easily, ever since childbirth. His belief stems from his illness, that just as he is someone who is completely weak, there must be someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who is equally as strong. As he guides David through to the realization of his place in the world, a bigger revelation is at work, someone even as strong as David cannot withstand.In a slow, emotional process, Shyamalan brings out the best and worst of his characters. In taking his time with the story, he is able to allow David to evolve from a hardened, unbelieving survivor into someone forever changed by the realization that the he possesses can be put to good use. I'm not going to reveal just how he comes to that realization: that's for you to find out. But I will say this: it's sheer brilliance.The story structure for this film bears striking resemblance to &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but does not fail in keeping us intrigued. It begins by introducing the characters, and developing them in the midst of a very involving mystery. It then evolves into a story of realization and revelation, and just as in the previous film, there's a surprise twist ending, one that is more shocking and unexpected.Shyamalan made the right choice in bringing Bruce Willis back for this project; one could even go so far as to say that the part was written especially for him. Once again, Willis is able to define himself as a true actor, one that can go from the guns and bombs of &quot;Die Hard&quot; to the sentimentality of a man whose belief in everything is shaken in this film. Cast opposite him is Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah, who also proves he is just as effective in a wheelchair as he is on his feet.So why would this film not be as great a success as its predecessor? The answer may lie with the audience. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; drew many crowds of various types of people, the kind of people who generally don't see movies of this sort. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a much darker film, and I guess that was a turnoff for some people.But who cares? &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is everything you'd expect out of a movie and more.

532413,AHTMSD2BWUPLU,B00003CXQA,"""dokterbob""","[3, 4]","M. Night Shyamalan must be the director with the most popular first movie ever. The Sixth Sense showed his remarkable style, with which he returns to old fashioned movie making. Long, slow and silent scenes are his trademark which is a technique that just needs a good story, otherwise it doesn't work. But Shyamalan knows as no other how to keep the interest of the audience captivated untill the very last revelation, which comes, just like in The Sixth Sense, with a flash, at the end of the movie which just leaves the viewer speechless.One of the greatest abilities of M. Night Shyamalan is that he can take a subject which has been used by so many writers/directors before and which has become such a cliche but still knows how to make something original out of it. And how unlikely the story might sound, it's done with such a feel of realism and emotions, that you just believe it's all real.In his previous movie Shyamalan made us believe in spirits, wondering around in our world. Now, he takes the classic superhero story and makes it his own. But is David (Bruce Willis) a superhero? Or is he just an ordinary man, who gets brainwashed by a sick, dillusional man, who is basically sick his entire life, and as a result looses all boundaries of what it real and what is fiction.As with all of Shyamalans movies, you have to find out yourself and should know as little as possible of the story before you watch it. But you have to understand, that it's a movie leaning on it's story. You have to get swept away by it, and don't anticipate any grand action scenes. Because you won't find them. You just know, while watching the movie, that you are watching something of great brilliance, but you won't be able to say why. You just feel it.Once again, James Newton Howard delivered a terrific score and the cast is terrific (especially Samuel L. Jackson, he gives his best performance ever!) The movie also includes all the elements of a Shyamalan movie; you'll notice, if you look real closely, that everything with any importance is different.Just know that this movie isn't as different and new as The Sixth Sense was. It's got the same atmosphere as The Sixth Sense, and contains the same elements (which causes a quick thought of the word 'formulaic') but is in a way also different. The greatest thing is that you know what kind of movie you've watched only at the very end.

I enjoyed &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, M. Night Shyamalan's previous film (and to which, by some critics with incredible perceptual problems, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was described as a sequel--it is most assuredly not, in any accepted use of the term.); I've always liked Bruce Willis and usually enjoyed Samuel Jackson's acting terrifically.  The two of them were fantastic in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and I looked forward to seeing them together again.  But I found &quot;Unbreakable&quot; absolutely excruciating.  Others have mentioned the slow pace as a positive--I found it left me so totally bored with the story that by the time there was any action I simply didn't care.  It's not that I'm an action film buff--a story with little action but great writing--dialogue or plot, or with fascinating character development will captivate me.  But I found &quot;Unbreakable&quot; to have none of these.In fact, trying to pinpoint the main source of this movie's problems is quite difficult.  It's not the dialogue (for minutes at a time there isn't any!), nor the acting, and it isn't really the concept--when you put the thing away for a while and think about the ideas involved, they have some interest although too much was made of the comic book, and not enough of idea of truth behind mythology. (The premise that water was Willis's &quot;Kryptonite&quot;, and he goes out to hunt down the bad guy when it's raining buckets and manages to fall into a pool was simply absurd....please, spare me!) The music certainly didn't help matters, but it wasn't bad enough to sink the film to the depths it achieved.  I've got to put it down to the direction--it seems to me that Shyamalan tried too hard to recreate the success of &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; by starting with an unexpected twist ending, and working backwards from there.  But it didn't work for me.  The twist at the end with Jackson's character is rather good, but I had so totally lost interest in the entire film by that time that I simply didn't care, and I found it absolutely unbelievable.  Poor Jackson had the bad luck to have to utter perhaps the most ludicrous last line of any film ever made, and I have to believe that the director realized this after filming was over and everyone had gone home, because the music swells at this point, almost obscuring what must have seemed on paper a fine idea.  Thank heavens the idea of a trilogy based on this movie was abandoned.Now, if at the end Samuel Jackson had sung to Bruce Willis (to the tune of Unforgettable): &quot;Un-break me, you sweet unbreakable you....&quot;Hey, I keep waiting for Hollywood to call.",2,Unwatchable,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,2789,"['must', 'have', 'wildly', 'different', 'standards', 'film', 'reviewers', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'called', 'quot', 'great', 'great', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'wholly', 'original', 'quot', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'previous', 'film', 'critics', 'incredible', 'perceptual', 'problems', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'was', 'described', 'sequel', 'most', 'assuredly', 'not', 'accepted', 'use', 'term', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'usually', 'enjoyed', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'acting', 'terrifically', 'two', 'were', 'fantastic', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'quot', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'together', 'again', 'found', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'absolutely', 'excruciating', 'Others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'slow', 'pace', 'positive', 'found', 'left', 'totally', 'bored', 'story', 'time', 'was', 'action', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', ""'m"", 'action', 'film', 'buff', 'story', 'little', 'action', 'great', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'fascinating', 'character', 'development', 'will', 'captivate', 'found', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'have', 'none', 'these.In', 'fact', 'trying', 'pinpoint', 'main', 'source', 'movie', 'problems', 'quite', 'difficult', 'not', 'dialogue', 'minutes', 'time', ""n't"", 'acting', ""n't"", 'really', 'concept', 'when', 'put', 'thing', 'away', 'while', 'think', 'ideas', 'involved', 'have', 'interest', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'comic', 'book', 'not', 'enough', 'idea', 'truth', 'mythology', 'premise', 'water', 'was', 'Willis', 'quot', 'Kryptonite', 'quot', 'out', 'hunt', 'down', 'bad', 'guy', 'when', 'raining', 'buckets', 'manages', 'fall', 'pool', 'was', 'simply', 'absurd', '.please', 'spare', 'music', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'sink', 'film', 'depths', 'achieved', ""'ve"", 'got', 'put', 'down', 'direction', 'Shyamalan', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'recreate', 'success', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'starting', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'ending', 'working', 'backwards', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'twist', 'end', 'Jackson', 'character', 'rather', 'good', 'had', 'so', 'totally', 'lost', 'interest', 'entire', 'film', 'time', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'found', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'Poor', 'Jackson', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'have', 'utter', 'perhaps', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'believe', 'director', 'realized', 'filming', 'was', 'everyone', 'had', 'gone', 'home', 'music', 'point', 'almost', 'obscuring', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'paper', 'fine', 'idea', 'Thank', 'idea', 'trilogy', 'based', 'movie', 'was', 'abandoned.Now', 'end', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'had', 'sung', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'tune', 'Unforgettable', 'quot', 'Un-break', 'sweet', 'unbreakable', 'quot', 'Hey', 'keep', 'waiting', 'Hollywood', 'call']",Unbreakable
532420,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00003CXQA,drkhimxz,"[0, 1]","I had not known of this film when I purchased it on the name of Bruce Willis. I suppose it warrants the characterization of ""atmospheric"" since in fact that is about all there is. Action plays a subordinate role to Willis' portrayal of the man with an itch from a source he cannot fathom. The Jackson character is given limited scope, inherent in its delineation by the film's creators. Apparently, this is to be the natural history of a comic book hero born of real, normal parents, living a real man's family life but alienated from meaningful connections with the world. In the denouement, with Jackson's help, he finds that place. The ending is a distinct falling off a cliff, its abruptness being a let-down from the build-up and pinnacle.It is one of those endings which makes one feel that the creators ran out of steam and didn't know what to do next; or, perhaps, the financial chief said that there was no more money to be spent, cut it where you can.At any rate, despite the glacial pace and lack of substantial characters aside from the two stars, and the role of Willis' son, it holds interest until that lack-luster ending.Over-all, I have to fall back on the old cliche in recommending it, that is, it is the kind of film which people who like this type of film will enjoy. Anyone looking for a Bruce Willis film will probably be disappointed.I have completely forgotten seeing the film about which I wrote above. Have just seen it again some time later.

But they weren't the first to use that -- M. Night Shyamalan tackled in in ""Unbreakable,"" an eerie thriller full of solid acting and writing, but a big fat letdown of an ending.A train derails, killing everyone on board -- except everyman David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who survives without a scratch. As he tries to deal with this, he is contacted by crippled comic book dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose ""glass"" bones made him speculate: what if there were people at the opposite end of the spectrum -- real superheroes with great strength and powers, REAL ""men of steel""?Realizing that he has never been sick or endangered (except when exposed to water), David begins to explore his newly-discovered strength and second sight, despite the harm it does to his fragile marriage, even saving others from criminals. But there's a sinister side to his discovery and the accident that caused him to explore his powers...""Superhero movie"" usually makes you think of loads of colourful action and young hunky heroes. But Shyamalan takes the opposite approach --  a middle-aged Everyman hero with wife and kid, and the movie is cloaked in shadowy camerawork, not much action at all and eerie, overquiet dialogue. Still it's very geeky, and very intelligent.Instead of action, ""Unbreakable"" devotes itself to the mythic qualities of superheroes, and David's slow awakening to his own abilities. Rather than his usual suspense, Shyamalan uses atmosphere to keep the plot captivating, giving it the feeling of a creepy intense dream. And since every superhero has to fight the baddies, he weaves in some tightly-choreographed, grimy fight sequences as David finally makes use of his superstrength.So what's the problem? Quite simply, the ending is a huge letdown -- while rationally it makes sense, David's actions at the climax leave you feeling, ""That's it? That's all the 'unbreakable man' is going to do?"" And somehow it feels odd that a ""supervillain"" wouldn't really have any superabilities (or compensation for them) himself.Bruce Willis gives an excellent, understated performance as David, who longs for an indefinable something in his life, and slowly grows to realize that he is ""unbreakable."" But Jackson is even better as Elijah Price -- intense, passionate, and somewhat detached from the real world.

Firstly we can safely say Shyamalan' s day is done - and it is nice to have a film like this from his heyday. My wife and I love nearly every film he's made.Here is the classic story of the superhero. Except, of course, Night is at the helm which means nothing will be as it seems yet all will be revealed that was right in front of us all along. When Bruce Willis, a sad-sack schmoe who works security at the ballpark, meets Samuel L. Jackson, a weird comic book collector with glasslike bones that break all the time ... well, you be the judge!The fun of this film in my opinion is mostly Willis discovering who he really is; Jackson is a sort of see-through. But then Shyamalan does not want the audience to be duped or thrown into a dizzy-tizzy. Shyamalan wants the audience to THINK. This film certainly provokes thoughts that reach far beyond the world of comic book villains and heroes.Here, Shyamalan tells a better tale than ever: we all have better angels to our natures but we can also be turned into monsters. The difference is all in the choices we make. Get this and learn what a master director can do with very, very little.

The fact that Bruce Willis acting was a little over done in this one. He was still good though. Overall, I liked the movie, and the plot of having kind of super powers a person isn't quite willing to accept yet.David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is just a regular man. With very few words, he can express how he's feeling. But when he emerges from a deadly train crash without a scratch on him, he begins to wonder what's going on. He soon realizes that he's never had a sick day in his whole life going to back to the fact that there was a car accident with him in it where he also came out without a scratch. It seems David can't be hurt, or injured in anyway besides one acception that he can't go near water without practically drowning. When a strange, yet very delicate, comic collector (Samuel L. Jackson) is taking an interest on David as more and more strange things begin to happen as he finds out, he can know about other people, and their sins in the past by just a simple bump on the shoulder. When a murder becomes obvious on the mind of a worker in the train station, he sets out deciding to use his powersI still give it four stars. the acting was a little off, but still four stars. M. Night Shyamalan delivers with another success. I think the best acting was done by Samuel L. Jackson who was the weird comic collector who was obsessed with David's supernatural powers.

Why didn't I think of that.  Also the mood and color tone of the movie is consistently moving.However this is possibly the slowest movie I've seen in a long time.  I've seen Ingmar Bergman movies that move faster than this one.  Part of the problem to me is that the story and idea behind the movie suggest a thinking man's action movie.  Not that every movie I see has to have big explosions or anything, but there was nothing here.  By the time that the Willis character takes on his new 'identity,' you're so bored that it really doesn't matter.  Even the big train wreck that sets up the movie is not shown, just the aftermath from the view of a helicopter.Now I'm pretty sure that the director was deliberately going away from the action so he could focus on the story and characters.

532436,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXQA,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 1]","Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", but he outdid himself with ""Unbreakable"", a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite.  As was the case with ""Sixth Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out.  Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"").  Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.

532437,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00003CXQA,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[1, 2]","If there is one thing I love about M. Night Shamalayan's films, it is that they generally work on several levels, are thought provoking, and don't rely on generic material to tell a story. Sure, viewers of his films now look for the ""twist"" at the conclusion (thanks to The Sixth Sense), but there is so much more to the viewing experience that we shouldn't judge a film solely on its conclusion (like many did in The Village). Unbreakable is such a film that works on many levels, and has a symbolic, yet human aspect to it.The first time I saw Unbreakable at the movies, it just struck me as a strange flick, seemingly slow-moving but telling a tale of two vastly different characters. Years later, having seen the film several times since, I have a love and appreciation for this film and its depth. The film itself works as a sort of comic book story told in human form. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man who has had the remarkable fortune to been the sole survivor of a terrible train wreck. He's also never been sick in his life. You might say that, despite his fortunate moment, David is a pretty normal guy, with an uneventful, yet somewhat conflicted life. He works as a security guard at a stadium, but has had marital problems and isn't as happy as he could be with life. Shamalayan brings a real human, everyday quality to David, who comes to the realization that larger forces may be at work in his life. David's ho-hum existence will be interrupted by the man who really is his opposite, Elijah Price. Elijah (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson), is David's antithesis. Nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"", Elijah is prone to injury, sickness, uses a cane to walk; he is eccentric, odd and strange, and has a fanatic, obsessive streak about comics. Elijah is quite obsessed with David's ability to survive and sees an almost superhuman relevance to his existence. It will become evident to David only later what this encounter with the strange man means, as several conflicts surface.Unbreakable incorporates an understated level within its telling, but it is masterful in building both a symbolic and literal level of storytelling. On one side is the comic book angle of good vs. evil; both sides exist in the world and seem to balance each other out. Each of the two main characters, David and Elijah, represent these two angles. The story that is told from David's point of view brings with it a simple, but readily identifiable theme: we each have a gift, and we need to use it for the common good. One aspect of Unbreakable is really just David finding his identify and existence in the world. The scenery, visuals, colors all enhance the experience of watching as well.If there is one drawback, it is the ending, which other reviewers have noted. I don't fault it on its intentional or unintentional supposed ""twist"", but rather that it was just rushed and not thought out. The ending seemingly kills the momentum of an otherwise deep film.Still, I think that the film is excellent, and the DVD gives you fantastic extras which give background into the story of Unbreakable and the cast, but more importantly, put much of the film in perspective. Well worth the purchase.4 stars for the film, but 5 for the entire DVD package.",5,"Deep, understated film that works on several levels.

532438,A1WES59PGLHUHL,B00003CXQA,Francois Couture,"[2, 6]","We recognize Night Shyamalan's obscureness and awkwardness into this rather unjustifyingly long film. Everytime I review a movie I can almost always come up with one of two conclusions. Either the potential of the movie was entirely exploited - which is relatively rare and in which case a movie can be characterized as a masterpiece and I feel in my heart that I have to give it five stars - or, the potential was only partially exploited. Unbreakable belongs to the second category. The idea is great, the plot entertaining and original, the cast proper, the characters round and fairly developed. However... the movie is empty. As the minutes went by this question always kept popping in my head : &quot;Where is the matter??&quot;We can sense that Shyamalan has a burning desire to make the movie sound interesting and deep. However he did not succeed. We look at some scenes thinking : &quot;okay, this is supposed to be deep, and the producer really intended to make it deep, the way the characters behave and the way Willis is constantly daydreaming... but the truth is that it is a fake depth, it is totally empty and superficial.&quot; That was the impression I had when I watched the film. Whereas in the Sixth Sense, I felt a true depth and entertainment. Unbreakable left me with a taste of entertainment, and when the movie was over my disappointment was at its highest, because I thought it would get some kind of entertaining towards the end... but no. I sensed Shymalan did not have enough material but needed to make a long story anyway, and decided to throw some empty scenes all over. Although I really appreciated the work done by Samuel L. Jackson, I know he might regret being part of the cast, because this is not likely to be the role that suits him the most.I mostly have this sensation that Night Shyamalan could have created so much more, could have made a much more entertaining movie. I agree that mystery is good, but an excess of mystery is not natural and leads to boredom and disappointment. I don't know how to say it. Something was missing in this movie... maybe just a few very coherent and intelligent minutes, and I would have given it an additional star. Nonetheless, I have to give credit to Shyamalan for the very original twisted ending of this film. I believe he should be hired to create all the ending of all the mystery movies ever made, because in my opinion he has a lot of talent in closing. Gives just enough shock, and leaves just enough unknown to allow a sequel to be produced. If it is indeed, I certainly hope the matter will be deeper and richer than &quot;Unbreakable&quot;'s.

532439,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B00003CXQA,Frederick Baptist,"[1, 1]","The 6th Sense is a great film and will continue to be among my favourites but if you were to compare ""Unbreakable"" with it you're bound to be vastly disappointed.  You see they don't belong in the same genre as there is no supernatural/spirit world theme here except that it's obvious that this film has in some way inspired the tv drama series ""Heroes"" where ""normal"" guys without elaborate costumes have powers that they use either for good or for evil.  Other than being able to take huge knocks without breaking, David Dunne's truly special power is the ability to know through a simple touch what evil misdeed someone has done.  As a tribute to the comic medium as a way to tell stories/myths that has origins all the way back to the first civilisations e.g. Egyptian stone carvings etc this film will appeal more to lovers of comics and their collectors as they try to justify their addiction to and continued spending on them.It moves at a slow pace and tells a story of someone who fails to discover what his niche is in life and is hence miserable which affects all aspects of his life until a mysterious stranger shows him the way.  This film does reward the patient viewer but overall I'd say that it falls into the ok but not the great category the latter of which ""The 6th Sense"" belongs.  This Vista Series version is interesting as it comes in 2 discs with some special features such as a documentary about comics and some trailers and a making of film although overall nothing much to shout about.  The double-sided postcard with the work of Alex Ross a comic artist is included although I'm not too sure of the value of this.

I'm not amazed on how the film has managed to split its audience in two halves, the ones who love it and those who loathe it. First off, UNBREAKABLE requires a lot of patience. In fact, patience should be coming out of you ears. Because you won't really understand what's going on, and where things are going, before the film ends. And the entire film is very slow-paced, with no climaxes. Everything sort off just drifts a long. The scenes are long and the dialogues are low-key. Nobody are shouting. Nobody are firing guns. And there are no ghosts &quot;hanging&quot; around like in THE SIXTH SENSE. But when you finally arrive at the ending, after a long journey, everything will suddenly become clear to you, and the film will seem brilliant in retrospect. Trust me on that. And you'll laugh! I did, at least: I rate this as one of the coolest endings since THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Much better than THE SIXTH SENSE (but a lot of people will disagree with me on this one). But writer / director M.

532444,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00003CXQA,General Zombie,"[8, 14]","Ya know, it's so popular for people to bash on Shyamalan that he kinda drops in stature in my mind whenever I don't watch a movie of his for a while.  Then I go back and watch one of them and he pops back up.  I recently watched his last 4 movies, and he's got a very good record, with 2 brilliant films (this and 'Signs'), a very good one ('The Sixth Sense') and a good one. ('The Village').  Though I think that I like 'Signs' best as of this moment it's a tough call, and 'Unbreakable' is, in many ways, his most impressive film.  Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about it is just that it works at all: The whole 'maybe super heroes are real and the comics are just an exaggeration' angle just sounded really stupid to me, but he makes it very dramatic and dark, and creates a world that is impossible not to believe in.  And, finally, I really can't think of another film like 'Unbreakable'.The central character of the films is David Dunn, a security guard whose marriage is falling apart.  Early in the film David is involved in a horrendous train crash; everyone is killed except for David and he is utterly unharmed.  Shortly thereafter he receives a note from a comic book, I dunno, expert named Elijah Price who has some peculiar theories about who David might really be. (Along with a severe congenital defect which causes his bones to be extremely brittle.)  In short, he thinks that David may be a born hero. (Dunn never seems to get hurt or sick, has an intuitive knowledge as to who may be dangerous and is just extraordinarily strong etc.)  The rest of the film is basically their exploration of the possibility, and a look into Dunn's family life.Shyamalan's films are unusual because although they involve supernatural occurrences they are invariably about character first and foremost.  (I think this leads to the extreme mixed reactions to the films, as people who are watching this kinda of fantastical thing aren't likely looking for character, while those who traditionally would want character-driven films may generally avoid this kind of film altogether.)  Bruce Willis isn't the most avoid choice for the central role in a character-driven film, but I think he pulls it off well enough.  He's cold and stiff, yes, but that's appropriate for his character.  We only get to know him very slowly as the film move along, but I definitely liked the guy by the end.  Robin Wright Penn is good as his wife Audrey, and she's a bit more emotional and adds some warmth to the film.  Spencer Clark is fine as their son Joseph, though he's most significant as a plot device as he's particularly intrigued by the concept that David may be a hero, and rather forces the issue at a few points.  Some have complained about Samuel L. Jackson as the nutty Elijah.  I can understand why many would dislike him or find him annoying, but I think they're missing the point; I don't think you're particularly supposed to like him, and he is a monomaniacal nut and all.  He is perhaps too much of you're traditional tough/angry Jackson character at times, but I find it hard to get too worked up over that.Shyamalan's film are accused of being slow, and that they are.  'Unbreakable' may be the slowest, not just in terms of plot but in how it flows and is shot.  The film has tons of extremely long takes and talky scenes.  I suppose I can understand why people will dislike this sorta thing, but this is precisely what I like most about them, and what allows them to really have a strong impact.  Note the rather lengthy scene on the train at the opening of the film where David hits on an agent just prior to the crash.  From a purely practical standpoint this scene is unnecessary; all it really tells us is that Dunn's marriage is on the rocks, and we find that out plenty of other ways.  But that scene really draws you into the film, and really makes you feel the impact of the train crash despite the fact that you never actually see it.  And the slowness is necessary to make it all feel plausible.  There are plenty of extraordinary things going on in this film, and you need to get immersed in the world slowly for it to really hold on to you.  That and it just looks great with fine use of the widescreen format.  These long takes allow for each scene to be composed very deliberately and it's all very sharp and elegant with lot cool blues everywhere.  All of Shyamalan's films have fantastic cinematography but this is probably the best of them.  That and I just really like long takes.  I can't precisely say why.`Unbreakable' comes to a really extraordinary climax.  It is an action scene, more or less, but it's a beautiful culmination of all the build up in the film.  This is no ordinary action scene, however, it's one of the most deliberate, contained ones ever filmed.  It finds the perfect balance between the cool elegance of the visual style of the movie as a whole and the unglamorous, brute nature of the violence found here.  Had this scene been something ordinary or ineffectual it would've crippled the film, but as it is done it's really the perfect cap to it all.Lots of people have complained about the ending, but what can I say, I liked it.  It's a bit much, I'll admit, but it's really very clever, I think.On an unimportant sidenote, I can't help but mention that this film has some references to football, and it's rather abundantly obvious that Shyamalan doesn't know much about the sport.  Most amusingly, the agent on the train talks about how there's this great quarterback at Temple University who's gonna be a star.  Temple, you say? Great quarterback?  I don't think so.  Also, they talk about how Dunn won the rookie of the year trophy, yet he never played professional football, only college.  Now, they've got freshman awards and honors for college football players, obviously, but they wouldn't use the term `rookie'.  None of this matter in the slightest, but it's the sorta thing that football fans might snicker over.  I know I did.Yeah, this is a great film.

Bruce Willis returns for the role of the quiet, laid-back lead and shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson`s enigmatic presence. Like the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; also tells a mysterious slow paced story where and adult man has deep connections with a kid, but this time the plot is more interesting and original. The direction is terrific and certainly helps to create an absorbing and gripping mood and atmosphere, even if some scenes are too slow and unengaging. The score is adequate as well, as is the convincing and subtle acting. However, some energy wouldn`t hurt this movie, since it has few dynamic scenes given the overall slow rythm. And the ending is a bit anti-climatic and disappointing too, even if it provides a strange surprise.

But Shyamalan guides the film around the B-movie pit falls to produce quite an enjoyable film.  He accomplishes this by completely avoiding a comic book feel.  In every comic you or I have read since age 5, the super hero discovers their powers, instantly accepts them, and gets on about the business of saving the world.  In Unbreakable however, the majority of the movie is Bruce Willis struggling to come to grips with the powers Samuel L. Jackson claims he has.  Shyamalan allows us to see the world through Willis eyes as he slowly realizes that Jackson is right and tries to deal with what it means to be a &quot;superhero&quot;.The movie is shot in the same fashion as the sixth sense: with great use of shadow and unconventional camera angles.  This style does wonders for the suspense of the film.

532450,A3DUFMYW4GZK34,B00003CXQA,Greg White,"[1, 2]","If your like me, you liked &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, but hated Haley Joel Osment.  A lot of people aren't a fan of the kid, and I'm one of them.  Although I do give him credit, because he can act extremely well... he just annoys me.  So, going into &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, I had a few mixed emotions.  I didn't even know what the plot was, just knew that it was another thriller from Shyamalan, who, under the right circumstances, is a genius.  In my estimation, this just so happens to be one of those circumstances.  In the opening minutes, the camerawork involved got me worked up, and anticipating what was to come.Of course, if you've seen the trailors for the film, you know the basic outline: Bruce Willis becomes the Sole Survivor of a train wreck, and oddly enough, he comes out of it with not even a scratch.  He gets a mysterious letter, which makes him think about how many times he's been sick.  He can't remember a time when he was ill, and eventually meets Elijah, whose convinced that Willis contains superpowers, and just might be a superhero?  A lot of mind-boggling things happen after this, and the story only develops for the better.The thing that made me love this so damn much was the entire movie was like the first act of a regular superhero movie.  Usually the hero accepts his powers, and goes on to save the world, but Bruce Willis just doesn't want this power/burden.  The ending is one of the best I've seen in a while, and Willis and Shyamalan are thinking about making a trilogy.  A trilogy would definitely be good, but leaving it where it is now would be even better.  The film is almost flawless.The DVD isn't a slouch either.  The only other thing I wanted on this was an audio commentary, with Shyamalan, Willis, and Jackson.  That would make it a perfect package.  The transfer is beautiful(the colors are brought out magnificently), and the audio is just as lovable.  I loved the score to the film.  On the second disc are a few fun, informative featurettes that could have been a little bit longer.  There's also a multi-angle, multi-audio &quot;deconstruction&quot; of a scene that will probably only suit movie-buffs and film students.  Next up, there's a slew of deleted scenes which were really good, instead of the usual trash found with most deleted scenes.  They could have been very important in the telling of the film, but would have really slowed down the pacing.  Lastly, there's a hilarious bit in which M. Night Shyamalan includes another one of his extremely funny &quot;kid films&quot;.  This one's entitled &quot;Night's First Fight&quot;.  The sound effects and acting pretty much sum up what I'm talking about.The film is stellar, as is the DVD.  If your a fan of thrillers, this is definitely up your alley, and go into it more open-minded than usual.  You'll enjoy it much more that way.",5,Better than &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;,994032000,"07 2, 2001",2001,2852,"['liked', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'hated', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'lot', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'kid', ""'m"", 'one', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'can', 'act', 'extremely', 'well', 'just', 'annoys', 'So', 'going', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'had', 'few', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'thriller', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'right', 'circumstances', 'genius', 'estimation', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'one', 'circumstances', 'opening', 'minutes', 'camerawork', 'involved', 'got', 'worked', 'up', 'anticipating', 'what', 'was', 'come.Of', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailors', 'film', 'know', 'basic', 'outline', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Sole', 'Survivor', 'train', 'wreck', 'oddly', 'enough', 'not', 'even', 'scratch', 'mysterious', 'letter', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'sick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'ill', 'eventually', 'meets', 'Elijah', 'convinced', 'Willis', 'superpowers', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'superhero', 'lot', 'mind-boggling', 'things', 'happen', 'story', 'only', 'better.The', 'thing', 'made', 'love', 'so', 'damn', 'much', 'was', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'act', 'regular', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Usually', 'hero', 'powers', 'save', 'world', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'power/burden', 'ending', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Willis', 'Shyamalan', 'are', 'thinking', 'making', 'trilogy', 'trilogy', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'good', 'leaving', 'where', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'almost', 'flawless.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'slouch', 'either', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'wanted', 'was', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Shyamalan', 'Willis', 'Jackson', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'package', 'transfer', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'magnificently', 'audio', 'just', 'lovable', 'loved', 'score', 'film', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'few', 'fun', 'informative', 'featurettes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'also', 'multi-angle', 'multi-audio', 'quot', 'deconstruction', 'quot', 'scene', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'suit', 'movie-buffs', 'film', 'students', 'Next', 'up', 'slew', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'instead', 'usual', 'trash', 'found', 'most', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'important', 'telling', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'slowed', 'down', 'pacing', 'Lastly', 'hilarious', 'bit', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'one', 'extremely', 'funny', 'quot', 'films', 'quot', 'one', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Night', 'First', 'Fight', 'quot', 'sound', 'effects', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'sum', 'up', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about.The', 'film', 'stellar', 'DVD', 'fan', 'thrillers', 'definitely', 'alley', 'go', 'more', 'open-minded', 'usual', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'more', 'way']",Unbreakable

The visual style is still and almost claustrophobic, as though the world the characters live in is very small. I liked this, but more than that I loved the story, which is about self-realization. It was something I could relate to my own life and experience. The director picked a risky subject for a big-budget film. I also like the way he depicts husbands and wives; the relationship between David (Willis) and Audrey (Wright Penn) is beautiful. I could feel their awkwardness, their sorrows, their hopes. The director is very special in that he has the ability to create a plot so grand that it bears hard on the imagination, yet he keeps his characters subtle and ordinary. This is a good balance. The result is drama, not melodrama. Due to its pacing (compare a vinyl record to a compact disc), lack of special effects, and melancholy tone (without horror or gore as a &quot;reason&quot;), this film will not appeal to a lot of people.

However,I saw this movie recently only because I wish to watch every movie by the director of this film. I thought ""The Village"" prompted this need in me. Compared to the disquieting Village and the haunting ""Sixth Sense"", Unbreakable falls flat on it's face.I notice a reviewer talk about the patience needed to watch this film(please see the most voted review for this film). Now I am not the most acclaimed critic in the world,neither am I an above average movie watcher, but I can tell you this -Any time wasted on Unbreakable would be criminal. One needs to be really really bored to derive any sort of usefullness from this film. My subject is one of the reasons I write a review. I thought the kid in the film could have been given lesser scenes featuring him & he could not have spoken a dialogue at all. I have always taken Bruce Willis seriously but in this film, he acted as though he was under a contract to do this film and he would do so under any circumstances whatsoever.Samuel Jackson can't act. He'd make a good cocaine seller in a film like Blow because he would have less dialogues then and his facial criminal instincts would be used to the maximum of effect. The lady who played Bruce's wife in the film is just about as bad an actor as there can be. I do not like criticising films and mostly I search for the essence of every film but... Unbreakable had way too many loopholes and boredom inducing scenes for me to tolerate.MOST INTERESTING SCENE IN THE FILM - Damn! I realise that there was no scene in the film that managed to remotely impress me. The worst of films have a scene about them that can be recalled but Unbreakable had none. I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis lift weight in the film and play the role of a superman while doing it. [Had he killed Samuel Jackson (Elijah) in the end, I would have enjoyed the film a tad bit ] Now that I'm thinking Samuel Jackson's hairdo looked super hilarious in the film. I mean he looks like a monster from the 1960's really.I do not think kids should act in Science Fictions/Thrillers/Supernatural films. I thought the recently released film , War of The Worlds deserved 5 stars had they left the little blonde headed girl out of it. I'm sorry, it's my fault but I find it hard to take kids speaking dialogues seriously.I watched Unbreakable because of the same reason for which I went to the theater to watch ""the Village"" I had heard a lot of -tive reviews of the film. It's a good thing I downloaded thsi movie and did not rent/buy the dvd.If you are considering buying this dvd, do so only if you have scene the film beforehand.Secondly, don't forget to email me about how rich you are and we could be friends. I must be mad for having the urge to watch every movie out there, Rent this if only you have a similar urge to watch Unbreakable.I await M.

532458,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00003CXQA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","In the aftermath of a terrible train wreck, a man finds himself with nary a scratch in the midst of all the devastation, the corpses and the detritus. The only survivor, this seemingly ordinary man David Dunn (Bruce Willis), living a crumbling marriage and working mundanely as a security guard, comes to realize that he is very different from other people. He has never been hurt in his life, has never even had a cold. He meets an intense, strange, brittle-boned man, Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), who informs him that superheroes have always existed in one guise or another, and that David is one such - that David is, in fact, an archetype. David undergoes a  journey of self-discovery as he strives to challenge the limits of his powers, and figure out where he fits in, in a world that has become suddenly eschewed. But Elijah Price also sees himself as an archetype, and not that of a superhero...and that the roles of superhero and -villain must be played out.M. Night Shyamalan unveils his love for the genre with the film's implementation of his very heady concept: what if superheroes walked the earth? Unbreakable plumbs the comic book mythology and delves into the pop psychology of the superhero phenomenon. M. Night's conceit is that the archetypes of the Hero and the Villain have always been around, but now have been channeled into contemporary comic book superhero sensibilities. Shyamalan has his ""superhero"" follow the classic pattern as David Dunn runs the gamut of shocking discovery, the search for existential meaning, the quest for his rightful place in the world and finally, his acceptance of his unique seemingly pre-determined role. In the climactic scenes, David's shapeless poncho somewhat becomes a symbol of this acceptance, becoming, in fact, his superhero costume.The dependable Bruce Willis invests his role with his trademark, career-making everyday man persona and brings home a sense that, yes, this is how a Regular Joe would react to such unusual circumstances. I always relish when he takes the minimalist road as his acting choice (though his mouthy and brash Moonlighting and Blind Date persona is also fun). Either way, he's believable. Samuel Jackson's assured Elijah provides a very good foil for Willis's stoic David. The ever cool Jackson can be relied on to always bring in the noise, the funk and the bravado. Robin Wright Penn's character is nicely miserable but hopeful and should've been more involved in the proceedings. And, while I understand Shyamalan's need to inject a kid character into the story - to symbolize and convey the innocence and wonder of the comic book theme - the kid actor he finds ends up being cloying and annoying.Good or bad, Shyamalan goes the gloom and doom route. There is a sense of prevailing glumness to Unbreakable, a certain somberness to the music, a moroseness to the look and the atmosphere of the film. It infects David's dreary, humdrum life and his on-the-outs relationship with his wife. The pace is plodding, the action pieces far apart. In the special features, M. Night mentions that he had originally conceptualized the film in three stages: David's discovery of his inhuman abilities, his  several encounters with sundry crooks and villains, and, finally, his mega face-off with a worthy supervillain. But M. Night admits he didn't ""feel"" the last two segments and altered the storyline to this more bleak version. Shyamalan is earnest in his writing and directing effort but *sigh* I wish he'd found a happy medium between his original concept and the version with which he ended. He shoots for the grandiose moments and almost, almost gets there. But not quite. Still, I admire his sincerity and great effort and I was entertained enough to recommend this film: 3 and a half stars.Unbreakable's special features include:- Additional scenes with an intro by M. Night.- An in-depth ""Behind the Scenes"" feature.- ""Comic Books and Superheroes"" - a fascinating feature delving into the superhero/comic book mythos with avid fan Sam Jackson, the great Will Eisner, Scott McCloud, Alex Ross, Denny O'Neil, Michael Chabon and Frank Miller (Eisner talks about the origin of his Spirit hero).- A multi-angled feature on the train station sequence.- An excerpt from ""Millionaire"" - an amusing early film endeavor of a younger M.

532459,AVO9QQWRRXESK,B00003CXQA,Heather Hays,"[1, 2]","This film was rated lower than I thought on Amazon.com.It begins with Bruce Willis finding out that he is the sole survivor of a train wreck. The article is read by the sickly comic book fan Samuel L. Jackson (nicknamed Mr. Glass) who suffers from a disease that makes his bones break easily.Mr. Glass is pursueing a lifelong obsession that he has had to find someone who was on the opposite side of the spectrum from him, someone who never gets ill or injured. So, from that point on Bruce Willis begins to question his unnatural strength and finds that just like a comic book hero, he is virtually invincible.This movie is absolutely amazing and not just a panorama of special effects and cliches. It delves into all kinds of questions that address comic book stereo-types and what it means to be a hero in our modern world. The twist at the end had to be one of the best twists I have ever seen in a movie, mostly because it made such perfect sense.It's not often that a movie of such complexity and intelligence is made. I thought it stood head and shoulders above some of the other box office hits, such as ""Superman"", which I thought was a dissapointing, badly written big budget mess.But I suppose it's not the right movie to pick if you are looking for an action flic.",5,Interesting,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,1276,"['film', 'was', 'rated', 'lower', 'thought', 'Amazon.com.It', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'finding', 'out', 'sole', 'survivor', 'train', 'wreck', 'article', 'read', 'sickly', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'nicknamed', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'who', 'disease', 'bones', 'break', 'easily.Mr', 'Glass', 'pursueing', 'lifelong', 'obsession', 'had', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'opposite', 'side', 'spectrum', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'ill', 'injured', 'So', 'point', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'question', 'unnatural', 'strength', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'virtually', 'invincible.This', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'not', 'just', 'panorama', 'special', 'effects', 'cliches', 'kinds', 'questions', 'address', 'comic', 'book', 'stereo-types', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'modern', 'world', 'twist', 'end', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'twists', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'mostly', 'made', 'such', 'perfect', 'sense.It', 'not', 'often', 'movie', 'such', 'complexity', 'intelligence', 'made', 'thought', 'stood', 'head', 'shoulders', 'other', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'such', 'Superman', 'thought', 'was', 'dissapointing', 'badly', 'written', 'big', 'budget', 'mess.But', 'suppose', 'not', 'right', 'movie', 'pick', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'flic']",Unbreakable
532460,A457S8SW690NM,B00003CXQA,hi,"[7, 8]","Unbreakable, simply put, is the best PG-13 movie that I have ever seen. Period.The first time I saw this movie was a couple of years ago right after watching the sixth sense. The sixth sense was good with a shocker of an ending but was overated. Now comes Unbreakable, a movie in a so called trilogy, but this obviously got cancelled once everyone hated it. Well, I can't agree with that. And, I can't sit back while this movie gets criticized. Give me 0 out of 567777777 helpful votes, I don't care. I need to get my point across.First of all, PG-13 movies are horrible. End of story. The only good ones are the comedies. SOMETIMES ONLY THOUGH. After that, well, it's crap. The action movies are horrible with nonstop explosions and horrible acting. Simply put, well, if you look in my top 50 movies of all time (which I find to be veryaccurate), there are probably ZERO PG-13 movies. Only R. Why? Because R movies are realistic, and it's there that I can find the powerful dramas and the eye popping action movies. But wait what's this? Unbreakable, a PG-13 movie in my top 50? Scary. But true. I am very dissapointed that this movie didn't fare well because it gives all. It is a powerful movie, with excellent acting, and a fantastic ending. The plot is remarquable and finally something original. I found the movie to be very well made, with wonderful directing and writing. The actors are all connected and are great together. As for the plot, wow, it's amazing. The movie is about a man played by Bruce Willis that survives a horrific train crash. Without any injury. Without a scratch. Meet Elijah played by the always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson who does as usual an excellent job. He is very breakable, with a very serious problem that makes him very vulnerable to injuries. He is an avid comic book collector and when he hears of the crash and one survivor, he knows that he is a superhero. Like in his comic books. Of course he is crazy. Right?Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and has great chemistry with Bruce Willis. The movie has a very unpredictable ending (oh I'm sorry that I'm not as smart as the one reviewer who had it predicted in the first 5 minutes. ? He didn't even have the wreck in the first 5 minutes! We didn't even meet Elijah yet! And you want action, right? This isn't an action movie!)The movie had a very good moral and had a deeper meaning I found to be very intersting.This trully is a wonderful and compelling movie that I adore.

532461,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B00003CXQA,H. Jin,"[0, 0]","Gee, what a difference a poor marketing strategy can make.It was perhaps inevitable that 'Unbreakable' would be billed as another suspense thriller after the huge success of 'The Sixth Sense'. But while there is a supernatural element and a twist ending of sorts, in reality the two films have little in common. 'Unbreakable' is at its heart a subdued and slow-moving character study that deals with themes such as heroism and the fortunes of fate. It's easy to see why those expecting another taut psychological thriller would have confused and disappointed with this.But just judge the film for what it is. 'Unbreakable' has a fascinating premise derived from the ""superhero"" themes of comic books. Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), who suffers extremely brittle bones due to osteogenesis imperfecta, theorises that since he is weak and fragile, there must exist his polar opposite: an ""unbreakable"" man of unnatural, super-human strength. And when David Dunn (Bruce Willis) survives a massive train crash without a scratch, Price believes he has finally found the hero he has been searching for. What follows is part battle-of-wills, part character study, part supernatural fantasy, part comic book, and part crime drama, as Price attempts to convince Dunn to realise his apparent hidden powers and use them for good.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are best known for playing wisecracking larger-than-life characters, but they give very under-stated performances here that suit both the film and their characters. Jackson especially is quite restrained in his role, giving Elijah a quiet dignity and strength while hinting at the ruthless determination he is capable of. The subdued nature of the film means that some of the supporting characters aren't as memorable as they could be, although I felt that Elijah's mother provided a strong and poignant emotional presence to several scenes.Shyamalan apparently wanted this to be the first of a trilogy of films, and one criticism you could make is that the film does feel like a prequel at times. There is a long, slow build-up, and the film ends with an abrupt twist just when you think it should be getting into its stride. However, I feel that David and Elijah are such fascinating characters that they deserve the detailed exploration the film gives them, and if that means that story takes a back seat to character development then so be it. There is a typical Shyamalan twist ending, but even this is more powerful as a character revelation than as a device to further the plot.So yes, if you go in to this film expecting another `Sixth Sense', you might be disappointed. But if you are prepared to be patient and put some thought into it, `Unbreakable' is an excellent, under-rated, and unique film that will reward your efforts.Shyamalan apparently regards this as his best film, and I agree.

While not in the same class as a director as some of my other favorite directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg or Akira Kurosawa Shyamalan still has provided some great suspenseful and thought provoking films like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""The Happening"" among others. ""Unbreakable"" is another example of just how good Shyamalan can be as a movie director. A clever story line with great actors in the lead parts and a another one of those unexpected plot twists at the end of the film that you won't see coming.The story is about two men. One who's name is Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who from birth has a rare bone disorder that leaves them very fragile. The day he was born Elijah had both his arms and legs broken. As a result Elijah has had to live a careful life so not to risk injury. Elijah developes a love for comic books with a belief that superhero's live among us. David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, is just an ordinary guy who has a job in security at a sports stadium. Dunn is a man however who has never been sick or injured in his life. One day while riding the train home from work the train derails killing everyone on board save one person. David Dunn. Price is convinced Dunn is one of those superhero's who live among us and approaches Dunn about this. Dunn of course doesn't believe it. Then he gets thinking about how he has never been sick or injured. Then Dunn comes to realize that if he comes in contact with a person who is planning on doing harm to someone he can sense that something is going to happen. Dunn slowly comes to believe that maybe there is something to this super  hero stuff and with Elijah's help tried to develop his powers.The story is compelling and you can easily get caught up in the characters lives and whether Dunn is indeed a superhero. If there is one thing against it the movie does move at a slow pace a bit. Still that is not a totally bad thing. While it could move a little faster that doesn't mean ""Unbreakable"" is boring. In fact it can keep you on your toes as incidents occur and things are said in passing that come back later in the movie to have relevance to the story. It forces you to tune in to what is happening as well a guessing what will happen next.

In some ways, the film almost seems to be a parable concerning a religious transformation--I mean from sceptic to believer. Whether M. Night intended that subtext, I don't know. But I still found it interesting.Music is okay, nothing to write home about--but neither is it supposed to be, I think. Thus, no problems there.I enjoyed watching Willis' character beginning to bond with his wife and child again; and although the opening scene has been criticised, I thought (despite its pretensiousness) it caught the embarrassed tone of extra-marital flirtation very well. The main character is not really a great guy; and the film makes it fairly clear that his marital troubles mostly are his own fault.

While coping with this strange occurance, David meets Elijah.  Elijah has been born with a disease that makes his bones very brittle.  His theory is that since nature is balanced, then for every person like him there should be a person on the opposite side of the spectrum like David.  Someone who is unusually strong like Elijah is unusually weak.  As a connoisseur of comic books, Elijah perceives that person as being a superhero of sorts. David goes on a path of self-discovery and forms a bond with the compelling and successful Elijah.

532476,A3LZDCBXVW9XXM,B00003CXQA,Jay Smith,"[0, 2]","My first impression of this movie is how incredibly well Night Shyamalan can create a scene through lighting, sound and angles.  This worked incredibly well in the acclaimed &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and worked well with Bruce Willis' bland, subdued delivery.  It would be safe to say that most of us approached &quot;Unbreakable&quot; with the same expectations of surreal twists and unexpected revelations under soft light and flash-cuts.  During the first ten minutes, you know this is the same guy who creeped you out in &quot;Sixth&quot; and you cannot help but anticipate the same kind of ride.It works...to a point. This movie is the first act of a triology on the subject where one man discovers he has superheroic abilities, but not in the cheesy, spandex-clad tradition of film and comic books.  It puts the characters into a very real context and painstakingly manufactures our belief in the characters.  If you take this movie as a one-shot knock off, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, but if you accept this is only the beginning and follow the story as an &quot;origin&quot; of a hero or transformation of a character, you will understand it, but I you may - as I did - feel created that there wasn't more to the ride.  It is a self-contained story about &quot;rebirth&quot;. This, however, is not enough for a good movie in my opinion.  Here's why...The screen is gorgeous.  But what goes on is tedious. Willis mugs and grimaces with little animation, while Robin Wright Penn serves as the flat cardboard wife with little to contribute but another complication to the main character's life.  Their child is creepy, weepy and somewhat distracting in his role (clearly meant for Haley Joel Osmet since the replacement looks a lot like the current star of A.I.)  Samuel L. Jackson gets to preach again - something we've seen in every good role he's had from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars.  And while his character is one of genius, he is little more than Yoda in the Star Wars movies, a facilitating expository character who we are forced to believe is more important than he is.  He is, to extend the Star Wars metaphor, a Darth Maul...a very cool character misused and too easily dismissed from the story.So we have characters swimming on a beautifully shot canvas, whispering to one another and performing scenes that are sometime interesting, often dull, enevitably predictable.The DVD itself contains some deleted scenes that are also gorgeous, and sadly more thought-provoking than the scenes left in.  The documentaries included will thrill comic book readers who dig that sort of conversation and gives audiences an appeal to understand the film better if they watch a second time.  We're also treated to a short scene from Shyamalan's childhood filmmaking days on Disk 2 to remind us how far he's come since VHS home movies.",3,"Interesting Follow-Up a Flat, Unfinished Work",994118400,"07 3, 2001",2001,2844,"['first', 'impression', 'movie', 'how', 'incredibly', 'well', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'can', 'create', 'scene', 'lighting', 'sound', 'angles', 'worked', 'incredibly', 'well', 'acclaimed', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'worked', 'well', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'bland', 'subdued', 'delivery', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'most', 'approached', 'quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'same', 'expectations', 'surreal', 'twists', 'unexpected', 'revelations', 'soft', 'light', 'flash-cuts', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'know', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'creeped', 'out', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'anticipate', 'same', 'kind', 'ride.It', 'works', 'point', 'movie', 'first', 'act', 'triology', 'subject', 'where', 'one', 'man', 'superheroic', 'abilities', 'not', 'cheesy', 'spandex-clad', 'tradition', 'film', 'comic', 'books', 'characters', 'very', 'real', 'context', 'painstakingly', 'belief', 'characters', 'take', 'movie', 'one-shot', 'knock', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'accept', 'only', 'beginning', 'follow', 'story', 'quot', 'quot', 'hero', 'transformation', 'character', 'will', 'understand', 'may', 'did', 'feel', 'created', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'ride', 'self-contained', 'story', 'quot', 'rebirth', 'quot', 'however', 'not', 'enough', 'good', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Here', 'why', 'screen', 'gorgeous', 'what', 'tedious', 'Willis', 'mugs', 'grimaces', 'little', 'animation', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'flat', 'cardboard', 'wife', 'little', 'contribute', 'complication', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'child', 'creepy', 'weepy', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'role', 'clearly', 'meant', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmet', 'replacement', 'lot', 'current', 'star', 'A.I', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'preach', 'again', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'role', 'had', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Star', 'Wars', 'character', 'one', 'genius', 'little', 'more', 'Yoda', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'facilitating', 'expository', 'character', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'believe', 'more', 'important', 'extend', 'Star', 'Wars', 'metaphor', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'very', 'cool', 'character', 'misused', 'too', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'story.So', 'have', 'characters', 'swimming', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'canvas', 'whispering', 'one', 'performing', 'scenes', 'are', 'sometime', 'interesting', 'often', 'dull', 'enevitably', 'predictable.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'sadly', 'more', 'thought-provoking', 'scenes', 'left', 'documentaries', 'included', 'will', 'thrill', 'comic', 'book', 'readers', 'who', 'dig', 'sort', 'conversation', 'audiences', 'appeal', 'understand', 'film', 'better', 'watch', 'second', 'time', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'short', 'scene', 'Shyamalan', 'childhood', 'filmmaking', 'days', 'Disk', '2', 'remind', 'how', 'far', 'come', 'VHS', 'home', 'movies']",Unbreakable

Bruce Willis turns in some good underacting as the hero David Dunn who has been at conflict with his true identity his entire life.  Samuel L.

532478,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,B00003CXQA,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[3, 5]","I love this movie and is one of my favorites.  I love the slow pacing and the thought of a ""superhero"" story set in the real world. A real story with real world sensibilities and pacing.  True thoughts and action as a real person trying to understand that he might be extraordinary. The main character's young son being the one to push his father to believe in that possibility of something that seems to an adult mind as impossible.  I Love the character that Bruce Willis plays, he a normal guy that fell into those cracks of getting caught up in a dead end job, loosing passion for his relationship and his life in general, something I myself and others can relate to. You see him going though the motions of his Job, his relationship with his wife that is on the ropes and neither one being overly concerned about it.  Even his relationship with his son is missing something.  Then the possibility of something more and following ""your calling"".  Being presented something more, the idea your life has more meaning and getting obsessed with knowing the truth, is there more to my life then this.  That's the feeling that resonates throughout this film, figuring out your place in the world and not fighting it, but embracing your true calling.The Character that Samuel L. Jackson is one of his best roles in recent memory.  What a great character, someone you feel sorry for that is suppose to be the someone you root for, someone you care about. You understand why he does what he does, he wants to also figure out why he is what he is and his place in this world.  M. Night takes tradition comic book ideas and situations and transforms them for the real world but it's still just like a comic book heroes origin story. The Robin Wright Penn Character is also full of depth, she has her fears and those fears enable the feeling of something missing.  Sometimes it's not the relationship, it's the people in it that are lost, once they find themselves the relationship fixes itself. I like seeing these two people whom truly love one another that just hit that wall and have to move on but really have no idea where it all went wrong.I love comic books and super heroes, but here is a hero that is strong but not lifting cars, indestructible but not having bullets bounce off his eye ball, more of a real world superhero.  I so want to know what happens after this movie and how this character develops.  This movie was a pre curser to all these other superhero stories in film and the hit TV show ""Heroes"" that is about normal people figuring out they have powers, this one is done more practically.  I never thought that someone could do a movie and make a super hero and villain 100% believable.  this movie did it for me.  Even the climax fit with what M. Night was trying to say about this character, he's not a brawler, a Martial arts expert, and mentally he's not that tough...yet.  He's just a regular guy that has irregular attributes, nothing more, nothing less. Perhaps one day he'll be this grand heroic figure, but not today, today he's just a normal man trying to coupe, and handle these new ablities and respectabilities.I also love the cinematography and the subtle pallet changes.  Most of the colors dealing with Bruce Willies characters are dull and muted, the further we get in the film and the more emotion and passion are conveyed, the more the pallet gets richer and the tones get bolder.  Just look at the restaurant scene 3/4 the way in the movie, there is emotion and passion starting to drive these characters again and the walls of the restaurant is full of color, the clothes are more colorful compared to these same characters at the beginning of the film, they have nothing but dull clothes and surroundings, just like there emotional state.  Look at the rain coat/cloak of the main character.  look at it the first time he has it on and compare it to the last. All these small elements help the emotion and heightened the senses of the viewer without the viewer even knowing it.  If your not engrossed into the film it will be irrelevant. These things are small and it's easy to over due and hit you in the face with it, M.Night tried to go with the less is more approach that flows though out this film and stays true to the story, this movie is not batman nor is it the Matrix it is a true film with something to say.Some people don't like these type of character driven stories, where much of the movie is slow paced and learning everything about these characters. At first glad every character in this movie is dull and sedated even, barely showing any emotion. It's almost like they have issues that they just don't want on the surface.  By the end of the movie you see, the Mother, Father, Child and Father's Friend all have there emotional ""awakening"" and show some true passion for what is real.  It takes guts for a film maker to rely on the actors performance so much, it worked here and the Sixth Sense, didn't in his recent films. The way it is shot is contrary from every other film that is shot today.  Single set up and long takes with no cuts, and mountains of dialog.  Most movies today have so many cuts to keep the ADD audience from getting bored, but this movie has the confidence in that the characters and story will keep you engrossed.  I love characters.  You live and die by it i guess but I really cared what happened in his Marriage, with his son and his budding relationship with Elijah.  i didn't need some big action scene to justify me watching and enjoying every aspect of this movie.Under rated film in my opinion but i also realize these type of stories are not for everyone.  Most people who don't like the story or the ending want that big scene and would I guess be justified to see David do something truly superhuman, but this movie was about the unsaid things, the unseen thing, the feelings and emotion.  this movie was not about action of violence, it's about finding your calling.  It took artistic restraint and discipline to end the movie in the fashion that it did.  it makes it true to the message of the story.  this was the first chapter in the characters life, the action happens from this point on, and if you want that there are plenty of movies that deal with that. Most movies have this story in the first act, how cool to explore just this part of a hero story.",5,can heroes be real?,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,6353,"['love', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites',

532479,ATL84JW0KKIMJ,B00003CXQA,"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1""","[0, 0]","I think the assorted reviews here show that Unbreakable is a movie you'll either love or hate. As a confirmed comic geek, this movie was a dream come true, and the DVD even more so. It is a movie that treats the mythology of the superhero with the reverence and respect ignored by almost all the big budget comic-book adaptions.The problem is most people aren't comic geeks. The mixture of gritty realism with the notion that a man can be born with super powers may seem like oil and water to those who've never heard of &quot;Watchmen&quot; or &quot;The Dark Knight Returns.&quot; When I saw this movie in a theater, I distinctly recall the audience moaning and groaning at certain scenes, especially those involving Samuel Jackson's character. Many people I talked to afterwards also complained. I think what they fail to realize is that while Jackson's character seems surreal or worse, corny, it makes perfect sense. Quite simply, he's is a guy who's read too many comic books. To me, he doesn't seem corny or out of place at all. In fact, I think it was one of Jackson's best perfomances, and one of the top five of the year.The pacing also proved trying to many. I know a few people who even walked out on it. People hear &quot;super-hero&quot; and they expect punches to be thrown immediately. Granted, the pacing can be a little slow at times, but I never said the movie is perfect.From a technical standpoint, Night does an incredible job. His bizarre perspective's and subtle use of color and sound are extraordinary. Like &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; it requires several viewings to absorb. The performances, while understated (excluding Mr. Glass of course) are very genuine.The second DVD included with the set contains some really great stuff. This movie had some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen on a DVD. I also enjoyed the 20 minute feature on super-hero's and comics. It was awesome to see Will Eisner, Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons talk shop in a documentary format. I only wished it was longer. Maybe they'll include more in the sequel (Hope, hope, hope.)So, while the movie isn't perfect, it's definitely worth seeing. If you can't get into the whole comic book angle, maybe you can relate to the ultimate theme of the story: finding your place in the world. While this may not be a traditional story of good and evil, it is a story of a single man's potential, for good or ill.",4,Not for everyone (but definitely for me),993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,2403,"['think', 'assorted', 'reviews', 'here', 'show', 'Unbreakable', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'confirmed', 'comic', 'geek', 'movie', 'was', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'movie', 'mythology', 'superhero', 'reverence', 'respect', 'ignored', 'almost', 'big', 'budget', 'comic-book', 'adaptions.The', 'problem', 'most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'comic', 'geeks', 'mixture', 'gritty', 'realism', 'notion', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'born', 'super', 'powers', 'may', 'seem', 'oil', 'water', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'quot', 'Watchmen', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns.', 'quot', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'distinctly', 'recall', 'audience', 'moaning', 'groaning', 'certain', 'scenes', 'especially', 'involving', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Many', 'people', 'talked', 'afterwards', 'also', 'complained', 'think', 'what', 'fail', 'realize', 'Jackson', 'character', 'surreal', 'worse', 'corny', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Quite', 'simply', 'guy', 'who', 'read', 'too', 'many', 'comic', 'books', ""n't"", 'seem', 'corny', 'place', 'fact', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'Jackson', 'best', 'perfomances', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'year.The', 'pacing', 'also', 'proved', 'trying', 'many', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'even', 'walked', 'out', 'People', 'hear', 'quot', 'super-hero', 'quot', 'expect', 'punches', 'be', 'thrown', 'immediately', 'Granted', 'pacing', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'never', 'said', 'movie', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'Night', 'incredible', 'job', 'bizarre', 'perspective', 'subtle', 'use', 'color', 'sound', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'several', 'viewings', 'absorb', 'performances', 'understated', 'excluding', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'course', 'are', 'very', 'genuine.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'included', 'set', 'really', 'great', 'stuff', 'movie', 'had', 'best', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'also', 'enjoyed', '20', 'minute', 'feature', 'super-hero', 'comics', 'was', 'awesome', 'see', 'Will', 'Eisner', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Dave', 'Gibbons', 'talk', 'shop', 'documentary', 'format', 'only', 'wished', 'was', 'longer', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'include', 'more', 'sequel', 'Hope', 'hope', 'hope', 'So', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'comic', 'book', 'angle', 'maybe', 'can', 'relate', 'ultimate', 'theme', 'story', 'finding', 'place', 'world', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'traditional', 'story', 'good', 'evil', 'story', 'single', 'man', 'potential', 'good', 'ill']",Unbreakable
532480,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B00003CXQA,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","Before the superhero genre became really popular with X-Men, Spiderman, Hulk and Daredevil, Unbreakable slipped onto the scene with a truly fascinating look at the possibility of Superheroes and comic books being a form of modern mythology.Now before you completely discount this movie for being anything like the other Superhero movies, let me reassure you that the approach on this subject is so strictly geared toward being realistic you could very much believe the premise.  The best part is that the `hero' doesn't even know he is a hero.In an intelligent move on his part, M. Night Shyamalan reveals almost nothing about the movie except for the phrase stated in the trailers, `There is a train wreck, there is one survivor, and he is miraculously unharmed.'  With this statement we are intrigued.  How did he survive?  Not even a scratch?  How?Bruce Willis plays the survivor, David Dunn, a seemingly normal individual with a bad marriage and non-communicative relationship with his son and wife.  Immediately after the wreck he is approached by a strange individual; Elijah Price, superbly played by Samuel L. Jackson.  He states his case to Dunn, revealing to him his lack of illnesses in his lifetime and the fact that subconsciously he chose a profession as a security guard.  He lays out everything with dead on seriousness and conviction.  Intrestingly, Price has a condition of brittle bones that causes them break in even the mildest of impacts.  This is what made him seek out Dunn, their stark contrasts.As events unfold we find out along with Dunn as he discovers he can do things he never dreamed or tried.  Shyamalan smartly tones it down in order to keep us on board.  Dunn doesn't go out and suddenly lift a car over his head.  He finds that as he works out, he can add more and more weight to the bench press.  He struggles a bit, but eventually manages to lift over 900 pounds.This kind of realistic discovery about himself and the enlightenment of his own abilities starts to change his own life.  He seems to find purpose, or at least importance in what who he is.  The dichotomy of his character and Elijah truly comes to a head in the finale.  This movie is slow paced thriller, with a dramatic story and a twist that is worthy of the Sixth Sense.  There is nothing in Unbreakable that would make you predict the ending of this one.  Highly recommended, a great movie.",5,Do you believe in Heroes?,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,2396,"['superhero', 'genre', 'became', 'really', 'popular', 'X-Men', 'Spiderman', 'Hulk', 'Daredevil', 'Unbreakable', 'slipped', 'scene', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'look', 'possibility', 'Superheroes', 'comic', 'books', 'being', 'form', 'modern', 'mythology.Now', 'completely', 'discount', 'movie', 'being', 'anything', 'other', 'Superhero', 'movies', 'let', 'reassure', 'approach', 'subject', 'so', 'strictly', 'geared', 'being', 'realistic', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'believe', 'premise', 'best', 'part', 'hero', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'hero.In', 'intelligent', 'move', 'part', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'almost', 'nothing', 'movie', 'phrase', 'stated', 'trailers', 'train', 'wreck', 'one', 'survivor', 'miraculously', 'unharmed', 'statement', 'are', 'intrigued', 'How', 'did', 'survive', 'Not', 'even', 'scratch', 'How', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'survivor', 'David', 'Dunn', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'individual', 'bad', 'marriage', 'non-communicative', 'relationship', 'son', 'wife', 'Immediately', 'wreck', 'approached', 'strange', 'individual', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'superbly', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'case', 'Dunn', 'revealing', 'lack', 'illnesses', 'lifetime', 'fact', 'subconsciously', 'chose', 'profession', 'security', 'guard', 'out', 'everything', 'dead', 'seriousness', 'conviction', 'Intrestingly', 'Price', 'condition', 'brittle', 'bones', 'break', 'even', 'mildest', 'impacts', 'what', 'made', 'seek', 'out', 'Dunn', 'stark', 'contrasts.As', 'events', 'unfold', 'find', 'out', 'Dunn', 'can', 'do', 'things', 'never', 'dreamed', 'tried', 'Shyamalan', 'smartly', 'down', 'order', 'keep', 'board', 'Dunn', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'suddenly', 'lift', 'car', 'head', 'out', 'can', 'add', 'more', 'more', 'weight', 'bench', 'press', 'bit', 'eventually', 'lift', '900', 'pounds.This', 'kind', 'realistic', 'discovery', 'enlightenment', 'own', 'abilities', 'change', 'own', 'life', 'find', 'purpose', 'least', 'importance', 'what', 'who', 'dichotomy', 'character', 'Elijah', 'truly', 'head', 'finale', 'movie', 'slow', 'paced', 'thriller', 'dramatic', 'story', 'twist', 'worthy', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'nothing', 'Unbreakable', 'would', 'make', 'predict', 'ending', 'one', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'great', 'movie']",Unbreakable

532482,A1R1A3PR41O5L5,B00003CXQA,Jerald Brewer,"[1, 3]","This disc is amazing. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan stunned us with ""The 6th Sense"" and tops himself with ""Unbreakable"". I thought it was a great movie when I first saw it, but upon seeing it 18 months later I think it is a masterpiece.Enough about the movie. The disc is brilliant. Shyamalan's introductions to the deleted scenes are very insightful. I love seeing and hearing an artist talk about his work especially someone as smart as he is. The scenes themselves are astonishing. The scene with the priest and the flashback in the carnival are 2 of the best things he has ever created. I hope we see a longer version of this movie with these deleted scenes re-edited into it. The 20 minute featurette ""Comic Books and Super Heroes"" is fascinating. I was really happy to see Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons included in it. The ""making of"" piece is very cool. This disc gives you more bang for the buck than just about any other disc you'll buy.

532485,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00003CXQA,JGC,"[0, 0]","In ""Unbreakable"" Bruce plays an everyday man David Dunn who has extraordinary powers. After escaping a tragedy unharmed he starts to think that there is something wrong with him because he's never been hurt in his life. David comes to meet another gentleman on the other side of the pendulum, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who has gone out of his way to follow David's miraculous powers. The more the plot unfolds the more we learn that David is such a heroic and humbled man who just wants to find out why he is like this. Bruce Willis was especially believable during the scene with the gun. There was so much passion in his voice. But it's not until David starts to embrace his special powers that he was born with does he really start to see what is going on around with him. It's like he is able to step outside of the box and look at the entire picture and that picture isn't very pretty and it's not very nice to look at. And that's why this role was so perfect for Bruce because he was able to channel his natural abilities of drama and even action to give such power and credence to an everyday man who happens to be everyone's hero. There is a plot twist that will really catch you for a loop, I can't imagine anyone would expect it. This is a wonderful movie because it's both uplifting and empowering and shows that heroes or angels or whatever you want to call them walk among us. ""Unbreakable"" is also an affective movie for displaying evil and virtu in the most semblance and basic ways. Robin Wright was also excellent playing Bruce's wife because there was an almost severe and magnanimous quality about her character that came shining through.

This was the first project after the ground-breaking, record-setting 'I see dead people' thing, so Willis and Shylaman hooked up again for this project - and added Sam. There can be no issues with the production values, acting, filming, and directing - all are perfect. The only criticism is the story and ending (its a Shymalan movie, so it has to have a requisite unique ending you didn't see coming). I won't spoil it for you, but the poor reviews and anything I've ever heard bad about this is for its ending - not the movie itself or ANYTHING to do with the movie itself. It's great. That said, it helps if you like comic books and believe in heros, and can stand a whinny Robin Wright and a militant Afro-American (literally) Samuel L. Jackson. Also if you like your art to have some intrinsic meaning and realize that, like life, not everything is neatly wrapped up in an hour or two. Not only will you not see the ending coming, some don't like it's meaning - and then the film is over, with sort an awkward post-script sort of reminiscent of an earlier genre - perhaps a homage. In my humble opinion, you cannot can yourself a fan of any of the stars without viewing this work - it's indispensable. If you are unfamiliar with the material and just want a good movie, you will find one - but it wont' be what you expect. I'd like to see how he would have ended it with about $5-$10 million more in the budget, or (gasp!) a sequel, as we now have for anything even remotely related to this genre - but I'm not going to tell you what it is - you have to see for yourself.",4,Willis/Jackson/Shylaman - How can you go wrong?,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1679,"['Well', 'know', 'can', '3', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'individually', 'occasionally', 'together', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'first', 'project', 'ground-breaking', 'record-setting', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'thing', 'so', 'Willis', 'Shylaman', 'hooked', 'up', 'again', 'project', 'added', 'Sam', 'can', 'be', 'issues', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'filming', 'directing', 'are', 'perfect', 'only', 'criticism', 'story', 'ending', 'Shymalan', 'movie', 'have', 'requisite', 'unique', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'poor', 'reviews', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'bad', 'ending', 'not', 'movie', 'ANYTHING', 'do', 'movie', 'great', 'said', 'like', 'comic', 'books', 'believe', 'heros', 'can', 'stand', 'whinny', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'militant', 'Afro-American', 'literally', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Also', 'like', 'art', 'have', 'intrinsic', 'meaning', 'realize', 'life', 'not', 'everything', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'hour', 'two', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'meaning', 'then', 'film', 'sort', 'awkward', 'post-script', 'sort', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'genre', 'perhaps', 'homage', 'humble', 'opinion', 'can', 'not', 'can', 'yourself', 'fan', 'stars', 'viewing', 'work', 'indispensable', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'material', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'wont', 'be', 'what', 'expect', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'ended', '5-', '10', 'million', 'more', 'budget', 'gasp', 'sequel', 'now', 'have', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'related', 'genre', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'have', 'see']",Unbreakable

The movie is a pretty dreary dream that interests you but has you frustrated, actually wanting more. Plus Willis plays a dope, I mean he asks stuff like &quot;was I ever sick?&quot; and doesn't even remember if he was injured in a car wreck or not.SPOILER: On top of that, he didn't know all this time that when he touches people he can see the sins that they've done. Now how someone with powers like that didn't know about it all along is beyond me. I guess he must of avoided touching people his whole life or something.Now beyond the bad stuff, including the dumb text at the end, Unbreakable is still a very good movie. Even though Willis plays a dope, he still gives a fantastic performance. The scene where both he and his son want to see just how strong he is and keep on adding more and more weight for him to lift is just great. Speaking of his son, they have very good chemistry together. There's a scene where the son wants to prove to the father that he can't be killed and has a gun pointed at him is very emotional and heartfelt. One of the movie's more powerful scenes.Unbreakable is a superhero movie, but not another X-Men; instead it's basically about finding your role in life. The film has one cool heroic scene, though, where Willis attempts to save a family that are a hostage in their own home.Unbreakable isn't only about Willis' character though, it's also about Samuel L. Jackson's, who has unbreakable hair. No, just kidding: it looks that way, though. Jackson plays Elijah, who has had very breakable bones his entire life. Since he can't do sports or anything, his mom buys him comic books. After reading them most of his life, he finds himself convinced that he has an opposite who is kind of like one of the superheroes he reads about.

That's just plain ridiculous.

They all work well to build up to a climax that makes you realize that the movie would have been stupid if it had been made any other way.

""The Sixth Sense"" was such a tremendous success, expectations are ridiculously high for Shyamalan's other efforts.  This is at least part of the explanation for the horrid reviews some give ""Unbreakable"", which I feel is well written and well acted, with an ending that caught me more off guard than the twist ending of ""The Sixth Sense"".  The idea of a whole film dedicated to a character's discovery of his extraordinary powers (as opposed to covering that ground in 10 or 15 minutes) is clever, and Shyamalan handles the premise brilliantly.  Bruce Willis again turns in a strong performance, and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as well.  There are some powerful scenes in ""Unbreakable""- the hospital scene is excellent, and the staircase scene proves that Shyamalan is a film student who took his lessons to heart.  Just as ""The Sixth Sense"" is a ghost story that's ultimately not about the ghosts, ""Unbreakable"" is a superhero story that, in the end, isn't about super powers.

Miraculously he is the sole survivor and does not have even a single scratch on him.  Shortly after the wreck David meets a strange man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who begins to make David question himself.  How was it possible that he did not even break a bone in the wreck?  Was surviving the crash luck or was he chosen?  If he was chosen what is his purpose in life?  Elijah believes he knows the answers but will David want to believe him?This is the first DVD in the new Vista Series line.  The film is shown in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and sports both a Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 tracks.  The extras are all on the second disk and are all in anamorphic widescreen.  They include 2 featuretts, deleted scenes and more.  The seven deleted scenes run about 20 minutes and really add to the character development.  The only thing missing was some trailers.  I know its not much but its one of my favorite features and not even one was provided on the disk.The movies pacing seemed a bit slow but towards the end it really picks up.  I heard that this was written as the first part of a trilogy.  I really liked this film and hope that this is true because the last half hour is really where it pulls you in.  The film made around [amount] million dollars and the American box office.  I hope this is enough incentive to produce the next two films.

532500,A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,B00003CXQA,John,"[0, 1]","I have seen this movie twice now-first with my brother and then with my best friend-and let me tell you, even though there is nothing like the first time, this movie is just as great (or better, depending on the mood your in) with every viewing. The story is of an ordinary man, David Dunn (Willis) who survives a train wreck and eventually comes to realize (more like is forced to believe) that he cannot be physically harmed.This movie could have just been another superhero flick, but there are many things throughout the movie that give it style and character that those other movies lacked. First of all, in the beginning of the film, M. Night doesn't show us the train crash. In any other movie in this genre, this would have been a big special effects scene, but by only implying the wreck, it makes the scene much more interesting. Secondly, the fact that Bruce Willis does not have to don tights and a cape before he goes out to ""fight crime"". That (while it works in Superman and Batman) would have been just too corny. Finally and most importantly, is the thing that most reviewers have been complaining about: the fact that David Dunn goes not go out to fight the bad guys until the very end. Instead, there is a slow build up to this throughout the whole movie, while Dunn is discovering his powers and beginning to test and use them (the scene where he sees how much weight he can lift and the one where he almost catches a drug dealer in the stadium (played by M. Night)). This buildup makes the climax that much more interesting. Tell me that you did lean forwards during the scene where Dunn goes to the train station at the end and stay that way on the edge of your seat until the end, biting your nails and unable to look away from the screen! God! I love that part! It is the coolest sequence I've seen in a movie since the ending of The Matrix! (Please excuse my brief outburst of immature-ness) A more technical reason for this is the fact that this is just the beginning to what eventually will be a trilogy.Now about the DVD. First off, the packaging for this DVD looks very good, which while not being the most important thing, is an added plus because it will look good on your shelf. The actual extras on this DVD aren't as thorough as I would have liked (perhaps owing to it's (strange) lack of box office success?) I would have liked to see a commentary as well as all the other features. The extras it does have are spectacular, though. The 7 deleted scenes stand out as being interesting because they are introduced and explained by M. Night Shyamalan. This is a nice touch I think. I wish all DVD's had this. Moving on, there is also an excerpt of a film the director made when he was about ten or eleven. For some reason, I was lead to believe that this was an alternate ending to the movie, so when I viewed it I was somewhat disappointed, but it is interesting as a view into the director's childhood. There is also a short behind the scenes featurette, which is entertaining and informative, but you will wish it was longer.All in all, this definitely would make a great addition to your DVD collection. It's not just for comic book or superhero enthusiasts, all viewers can enjoy this movie. You can also watch it with a child, as there is not much language or violence, though they might not fully understand it. Go out and buy this, or better yet, get it here at Amazon (my favorite web site) and have it delivered to you the next day.",5,"""No Shooting Friends!""",1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,3474,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'now-first', 'brother', 'then', 'best', 'friend-and', 'let', 'tell', 'even', 'nothing', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'better', 'depending', 'mood', 'viewing', 'story', 'ordinary', 'man', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Willis', 'who', 'train', 'wreck', 'eventually', 'realize', 'more', 'forced', 'believe', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'physically', 'harmed.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'superhero', 'flick', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'give', 'style', 'character', 'other', 'movies', 'lacked', 'First', 'beginning', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', ""n't"", 'show', 'train', 'crash', 'other', 'movie', 'genre', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'scene', 'only', 'implying', 'wreck', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Secondly', 'fact', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'not', 'have', 'don', 'tights', 'cape', 'out', 'fight', 'crime', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'too', 'corny', 'Finally', 'most', 'importantly', 'thing', 'most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'complaining', 'fact', 'David', 'Dunn', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'very', 'end', 'Instead', 'slow', 'build', 'up', 'whole', 'movie', 'Dunn', 'discovering', 'powers', 'beginning', 'test', 'use', 'scene', 'where', 'how', 'much', 'weight', 'can', 'lift', 'one', 'where', 'almost', 'drug', 'dealer', 'stadium', 'played', 'M.', 'Night', 'buildup', 'climax', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Tell', 'did', 'lean', 'forwards', 'scene', 'where', 'Dunn', 'train', 'station', 'end', 'stay', 'way', 'edge', 'seat', 'end', 'biting', 'nails', 'unable', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'God', 'love', 'part', 'coolest', 'sequence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'ending', 'Matrix', 'Please', 'excuse', 'brief', 'outburst', 'immature-ness', 'A', 'more', 'technical', 'reason', 'fact', 'just', 'beginning', 'what', 'eventually', 'will', 'be', 'trilogy.Now', 'DVD', 'First', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'being', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'added', 'plus', 'will', 'look', 'good', 'shelf', 'actual', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'thorough', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'perhaps', 'owing', 'strange', 'lack', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'features', 'extras', 'have', 'are', 'spectacular', 'though', '7', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'being', 'interesting', 'are', 'introduced', 'explained', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'nice', 'touch', 'think', 'wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'Moving', 'also', 'excerpt', 'film', 'director', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'eleven', 'reason', 'was', 'lead', 'believe', 'was', 'alternate', 'ending', 'movie', 'when', 'viewed', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'interesting', 'view', 'director', 'childhood', 'also', 'short', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'will', 'wish', 'was', 'longer.All', 'definitely', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'not', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'enthusiasts', 'viewers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'child', 'not', 'much', 'language', 'violence', 'might', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'Go', 'buy', 'better', 'yet', 'get', 'here', 'Amazon', 'favorite', 'site', 'have', 'delivered', 'next', 'day']",Unbreakable

More importantly, can a heroic type of good exist without an equally strong, deep evil to fight against? All these themes have been explored for decades by comic book writers and artists. But I don't think any movie has fully explored the dark reality of superheroes and villians (and their identity crises) as well as Unbreakable. Yes, as many have complained, this movie has a dark, brooding side and it moves rather slowly. But I'd argue that is only fitting for a movie which explores two men (portrayed by Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson) who haven't realized who they are and what parts they play in each others' lives - not to mention the world at large. Only when they meet each other do they begin to fulfill their destinies. Until then, they are rather lost and a certain somberness seems appropriate. If you pay close attention, however, you'll notice that the serious, dark colors at the beginning of the movie change to lighter, brighter colors. And do keep your eye on the colors in each scene; they lead the way to even greater revelations. I will warn you that this movie is NOT for those who want constant action and thrills. This one forces you to think and it often goes rather slowly, giving the viewer a chance to fully appreciate every detail.

532518,A1JCOLQL6ENZJG,B00003CXQA,KC Reviews,"[0, 2]","This is a movie that makes me want to like it. It is formed with beautiful cinematography and a good cast. Unfortunately, too many of the elements remind us of a much stronger and much better Sixth Sense. I think that it is not simply that the Writer/Director Shyamalan and Willis are together again, but that you feel at the end that this was a formula. The fact is you expect the surprise and you know it's coming because you have seen Sixth Sense.However, the movie has some very strong performances. Willis proves that he is a better actor than we give him credit for being (Unfortunately, Hudson Hawk &amp; Color of Night still stick in my memory and prevent me from giving him too much credit). Also, Samuel L. Jackson, who I usually think is overrated, puts in an interesting performance as the fragile comic art collector Elijah Price. I think his scene falling down the subway stairs is incrediblely effective and Shyamalan deserves kudos for creating it. In addition, the acting is also bolstered tremendously by the key-supporting role Robin Wright plays as the football-hating wife. She is the one character I think could have been used more to create a better link between Jackson's and Willis' character.Aside from the acting, the movie has artistic and creative merit. The premise and the twist at the end show real writing strength. This along with the way the movie is shot creates a very solid outcome. The problem is that the surprise appears a bit far-fetched and when things come together at the end, you are left thinking it was silly. I think Sixth Sense has the same potential, but you are willing to suspend your disbelief. The major reason is that in Sixth Sense, unlike this movie, all of the elements come together-you really think he is what he is. Here, they appear to simply be thrown in.Overall, the movie is solid and is a good one for a Friday night and popcorn. This is not great, but I would still recommend it.",4,Nice movie.

532519,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00003CXQA,K. Driscoll,"[22, 22]","Unbreakable is about the mythology behind comic book superheroes and the purposes that each of us have in life.  The film opens with the birth of a baby boy with all four of his limbs broken.  He is Elijah Price, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson, and he has type I OI or brittle bone disease.  As his life goes on, he gets the nickname of ""Mr. Glass"" as up the point of present time in Unbreakable, Elijah had broken bones in his body 57 times.  Elijah is motivated early on to socialize in some capacity by his mother and his primary interest becomes comic books.  As he gets older he soon begins to question what the reason is for his own existence and comes to the conclusion that if people like him exist with his weakness, then surely there must be someone on the other end of the spectrum with massive strengths.  Elijah believes there is nothing scarier than to live life without knowing your purpose and he makes the assertion that there are in fact real-life superheroes.Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a security officer, who, unlike Elijah, is trying to find his own purpose in life.  He gave up his football career for his wife but now his marriage is falling apart.  David survives a train wreck that kills 131 people, and he is the only survivor.  He was completely unharmed.  Elijah believes David to be a real superhero and gradually confronts David with his theory.  David's son Joseph believes Elijah and assists David in finding out more about his potential powers. Just to add, I'm of the opinion that it is an absolute pleasure to watch Willis and Jackson act in pretty much anything.As with any M. Night Shyamalan film, giving too much away is hugely detrimental to the experience and please know that this film is entirely worth going into with no more information then I have already provided.  What Shyamalan has done here in retrospect, while considering the recent onslaught of big-budget comic book movies, is create a completely unconventional yet convincing adaptation of comic book heroes' origins. At the same time Unbreakable celebrates the mythology behind these fictional characters.  It takes a profound imagination to come up with a screenplay that gives this concept the treatment that Shyamalan has.  It is the kind of concept that might have taken almost a lifetime of brainstorming.A friend of mine once said that the Sixth Sense was a gigantic and nearly perfect movie for absolutely everyone, while as a comic book fan Unbreakable was tailored made perfectly for him.  Though I'm half the comic book fan he is, I concur with that assessment enough to confidently invoke it hear.  If you truly love comic books, Unbreakable is your film.  If you are not a lover of comic books, then try to walk into this film expecting little action and you shouldn't be disappointed.It can be argued that Shyamalan has lost his way in recent years, although he does retain his technical prowess even now.  Nevertheless, Unbreakable is still a joy to watch and is a shining example of Shyamalan during his most inspired and generative phase.",4,For Real Comic Book Fans,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,3068,"['Unbreakable', 'mythology', 'comic', 'book', 'superheroes', 'purposes', 'have', 'life', 'film', 'birth', 'baby', 'boy', 'four', 'limbs', 'broken', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'who', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'type', 'OI', 'brittle', 'bone', 'disease', 'life', 'nickname', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'point', 'present', 'time', 'Unbreakable', 'Elijah', 'had', 'broken', 'bones', 'body', '57', 'times', 'Elijah', 'motivated', 'early', 'socialize', 'capacity', 'mother', 'primary', 'interest', 'comic', 'books', 'older', 'soon', 'question', 'what', 'reason', 'own', 'existence', 'conclusion', 'people', 'exist', 'weakness', 'then', 'surely', 'must', 'be', 'someone', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'massive', 'strengths', 'Elijah', 'nothing', 'scarier', 'live', 'life', 'knowing', 'purpose', 'assertion', 'are', 'fact', 'real-life', 'superheroes.Bruce', 'Willis', 'David', 'Dunn', 'security', 'officer', 'who', 'Elijah', 'trying', 'find', 'own', 'purpose', 'life', 'gave', 'up', 'football', 'career', 'wife', 'now', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'David', 'train', 'wreck', '131', 'people', 'only', 'survivor', 'was', 'completely', 'unharmed', 'Elijah', 'David', 'be', 'real', 'superhero', 'gradually', 'confronts', 'David', 'theory', 'David', 'son', 'Joseph', 'Elijah', 'David', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'potential', 'powers', 'Just', 'add', ""'m"", 'opinion', 'absolute', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Willis', 'Jackson', 'act', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything.As', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'hugely', 'detrimental', 'experience', 'please', 'know', 'film', 'entirely', 'worth', 'going', 'more', 'information', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'provided', 'What', 'Shyamalan', 'done', 'here', 'retrospect', 'considering', 'recent', 'onslaught', 'big-budget', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'create', 'completely', 'unconventional', 'yet', 'convincing', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'origins', 'same', 'time', 'Unbreakable', 'mythology', 'fictional', 'characters', 'profound', 'imagination', 'come', 'up', 'screenplay', 'concept', 'treatment', 'Shyamalan', 'kind', 'concept', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'almost', 'lifetime', 'brainstorming.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'once', 'said', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'gigantic', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'everyone', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'Unbreakable', 'was', 'tailored', 'made', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'concur', 'assessment', 'enough', 'confidently', 'invoke', 'hear', 'truly', 'love', 'comic', 'books', 'Unbreakable', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'lover', 'comic', 'books', 'then', 'try', 'walk', 'film', 'expecting', 'little', 'action', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.It', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'Shyamalan', 'lost', 'way', 'recent', 'years', 'retain', 'technical', 'prowess', 'even', 'now', 'Nevertheless', 'Unbreakable', 'still', 'joy', 'watch', 'shining', 'example', 'Shyamalan', 'most', 'inspired', 'generative', 'phase']",Unbreakable

I don't want to give away the ending so I'll leave it there.The movie is richly filmed and beautifully crafted.  The plot works because the actors are beleavable.  No one overacts their part.  The two disk set has the extra bonus of a feature about comics.  Many people, including great comic writers and artists, Frank Miller and Alex Ross, are interviewed. The musical score is also terrific.Lastly, a reviewer said this movie is depressing.  I cannot understand why.  In the final analysis, good triumphs evil, and our hero finds peace in himself.

The acting is superb, the story compelling, and the end twist is excellent.The only major problem I have with this film, which is what brings it down to 3 stars... relates to what a wonderful director once said - that in movies, it's really all about the ending. Here, I liked the idea for the ending, and how the story actually turns out. But I hate how it gets shown to the audience- more specifically - the captions detailing what happened to the characters.It is such a weird, unnecesary component that it just boggles my mind why Shyamalan would think that the movie, given its wonderful weight and structure so far, would require 80's comedy movie type captions that describe what happens to these 2 fictional characters. I am of the firm belief that captions at the end are solely to be used for films based on some form of truth. To wrap things up by explaining what happens to the characters, without it being onscreen, seems way too silly within a fictitious story. And it makes a wonderful movie such as this seem rushed at the end. It truly angered me to see that, given the connection I'd felt so far with the movie.I guess you could put that aside and just appreciate the rest of the flick.

In fact maybe I am not so analytical during a watching than others. I try to put myself in the movie not sitting outside looking in. So therefore I dont see the film for the same reason these other viewers do. I would suggest watching the movie from a non analytical view and imagine yourself as part of the movie. It then will be 5 stars and you will want to watch it repeatedly like myself. No there is no cursing and gore and big action going on. Its a really good story. Its fiction or is it. That part of the movie is great. It kinda puts a hint of goodness in our world of sadness. I personally will re watch it many times I am sure. I try to keep my collection of DVD's limited ""no pun intended"" to the ones I can watch again and again. Get this movie while you can.

Night Shyamalan's follow-up to the superb The Sixth Sense is an equally excellent film, with masterful storytelling, great acting and strong direction from Shyamalan. The storyline is about a seemingly-normal guy David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who finds out that he is impervious to pain and stronger than Schwarzenegger, when he discovers he is the only survivor from a horrific train crash. David meets up with comic book guru Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who befriends him and tells him what he can accomplish with his extraordinary gift.While not as well-played as The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has again created a world with fascinating characters and bizzare events. And like Sixth Sense, the film does throw up a shocking twist at the end which is even more unpredictable. Utilising the same techniques, the audience is treeted to the director's compelling world, much alike to the early Spielberg films; extraordinary events happening to normal people. The top-notch acting from Willis and Jackson makes the film's ideas work even better. And the premise provides a series of weird events, building up to a thrilling finale. If it has a flaw, the pace drags sometimes, but the material is handled with aplomb. This is one of the hottest new directors around working his magic to superb effect.The extras are really good, with comprehensive &quot;making of&quot; documentaries, some deleted scenes which add little to the film but still make for an intersting watch, and the &quot;train sequence&quot; with a natty multi-angle feature that allows yout to watch the film fron different view points.

The stars include Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.The story is strange and involves parallel comic book hero and villain.  The beliefs we have of what characteristics a hero and villain have are embedded in the story.The hero is David Dunn (Bruce Willis -a Philadelphia security guard) and the villain is Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who deals in the art and culture of comic books.The movie starts with a train crash that David survives with no injuries.  All other 130 passengers die.  You also see Elijah being born and the doctor asking if anyone had dropped the baby?  The people nearby say no - and then the doctor said the bones in the legs and arms are broken.  So two extremes on the bell curve of strength that  slowly and darkly to the surprise ending.David Dunn's estranged wife (Robin Wright Penn) is deciding whether to stay or leave - their marriage is falling apart.  David was flirting with another woman after coming home from a job interview  in New York when his train derails.  He seems to know something will happen as he looks warily at the driver of the train and sounds are exaggerated.  His son sees the news of the train crash on TV at home and realizes his dad is on that train.  He meets them both unscathed.  His wife asked if he got the job in New York.  He did not - he remains a security guard, but gets a $40 raise for not taking any sick days in 5 years.Through many scenes we realize that David has hardly been injured or sick, has great strength and able to deterine if someone is carrying a gun or is about to do something bad. He is slowly convinced by his son and Elijah he is a super hero.

Jackson, the owner of a comic book art gallery who believes that Willis's character may be a super hero in the style of a comic book. The movie really explores our perceptions of ourselves and the place we have in the world and in relation to other people.

Granted, both are directed by the same man, M. Night Shyamalan.  In fact, I thought I was one of them until I read the lines at the beginning of the film about how long people take to read comics, which I believed it was strange.Bruce Willis plays a person who becomes the sole survivor of a train crash.  No scratches and no bruises, Willis is uncertain about what's happening to him until Samuel L. Jackson sheds some light on what the event possibly is.  As a collector of comics, Jackson tells Willis that he is some kind of hero.  Of course Willis doesn't believe that, but he discovers it throughout the film.  The twist at the end is really impressive, and I think you should see it in order to find out.This DVD is fantastic and the extras are interesting, but not quite as attractive.

I also think that &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a good movie, with an interesting plot, interesting characters, and a nice twist at the end.I believe that &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was such a disappointment because it's so much less than &quot;6th Sense&quot; was.  People were expecting Night to produce a film that was just as enthralling and creepy as &quot;6th Sense&quot;, and they didn't get it.  Had &quot;Unbreakable&quot; been made first, I think it would have received a far more positive reception, and would have been perceived as an interesting work from a rising artist.As it is, Night jumped right in with a record-breaking blockbuster that may well be the best film he ever makes.  Success on such a scale creates expectations that are nearly impossible to satisfy, while placing you in the precarious position of having nowhere to go but down.The situation is somewhat analogous to what happened to Pink Floyd after creating &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.  A truelly incredible album that many feel is their greatest work.  Try as they might to top it, they never could.  All of their later albums were largely judged relative to how they stood up to DSOTM.  That kind of success is a two-edged sword.So, be thankful that Night made the &quot;6th Sense&quot;, even if he never does another film, and when he DOES do other films, try to judge them objectively, instead of by how they just don't measure up to &quot;6th Sense&quot;.

Doing that is nearly as inane as saying, &quot;Well, Spielberg directed 'Duel', so 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' has to be the same kind of film.&quot;Now, with that out of the way, let me say that this is a DIFFICULT film to review.  I wanted to give it 3 stars based on the film's &quot;shaky&quot; storyline, but 5 stars for its breathtaking idea of taking a classic story and trying to mold it into the REAL world.  A superhero in our society?  How would that work?  How would he discover his powers?  In this light, the film works beautifully in terms of self-doubt on Bruce Willis' part and almost religious fervor on Samuel Jackson's.  And let's face it...it tries to delve a little more into a human being becoming a superhero based on knowledge and character as opposed to &quot;Super *whatever* one day stumbles into a radioactive factory, has these powers, and for some inexplicable reason finds himself compelled to do good for everyone!&quot;However, the plot jolts around a little while and one almost feels compelled to bang your head against the screen and tell Bruce Willis to &quot;get on with it!&quot;  Still, once one comes back to earth and realizes that the story IS supposed to take place in the real world, it becomes a little more plausible--as plausible as fictitious superheroes get.Enjoy the film!

532548,A165JPQFQQAF09,B00003CXQA,Magneto,"[1, 3]","After reading some negative reviews of ""Unbreakable"" I didn't have high expectations when I recently watched it, which goes to prove one thing - whatever the film, make up your OWN MIND about it. Needless to say, I enjoyed this a lot. As with the director's last movie, The sixth sense (TSS), Shyamalan gives the audience another ""twist"" at the end of the film. I won't give it away, but it's not as good as the one found in TSS, which instantly made the viewer want to watch the movie again. The twist in Unbreakable also seems a little less credible, but it's the journey to this twist that was highly enjoyable, and keeps the viewer hooked until it happens. Samuel L.Jackson is - as ever - great, sporting one of the coolest/funkiest/craziest (take your pick) hairdos in cinema history!. Bruce Willis is also good, though he'll never be accused of over-acting, and virtually reprises his role from TSS. Nevertheless, Willis is our (the viewer) guide through the movie. The supporting cast is also worth a mention - Robin Wright Penn (the wife), and a very impressive Spencer Treat Clark who plays the son.I loved the visual style of the film, the mood & atmosphere, and in particular the way some of the scenes were shot, from the excellent opening sequence, to Jackson's tumble down the stairs. Some people have criticized the film for it's lack of action sequences, but this isn't even something that occurred to me while watching it. As with TSS, it's just not the sort of film you expect to see any, and I didn't. This is not to say it won't hold your attention - it will. From the opening sequence with the newborn baby, to the Spencer Treat Clark-with-gun scene, right through to the twist/end credits. For me, the only scene that started to drag a little was the weight lifting scene wth Willis, this could of been trimmed down a little.

532549,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00003CXQA,"Maine Writer ""David""","[2, 6]","Let me cut to the chase. Unbreakable is another movie about middle age. ""What!"" you exclaim. ""Isn't this movie a realistic portrayal of a comic book story like all the other reviewers claim?"" It isn't. They're wrong. The comic book story is just cover. Just like the ghost story in The Sixth Sense is just cover--engrossing and enthralling cover, but just cover. Like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable cloaks a deeply personal, philosophical message in an entertaining plot. But just like The Sixth Sense isn't about ghosts, Unbreakable isn't about superheroes or super villains. The Sixth Sense was a film about how many of us are walking dead, especially in relationships. It showed us how we take each other for granted, and often only come to grips with our sleepwalking lives when it is too late. So, too, Unbreakable is about middle-age, about growing up. Bruce Willis' character has reached that point in his life that so many of us do--beaten down by time, beaten down by responsibility, swept up in complexity. It is that strange middle-ground in life when you've forgotten the youthful indulgence, that you are special, that your life has a meaning, a purpose. It strikes at the same emotional vein (though clearly not as well) as The Sixth Sense. It speaks of the modern anomie of adults in a secular, materialistic society robbed of mystery and basic human dignity and spirituality.It's a perfect message for a generation raised on the idea t that they are unique and special--even if they really aren't.",4,"Not as good as The Sixth Sense, but what is?",1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,1511,"['Let', 'cut', 'chase', 'Unbreakable', 'movie', 'middle', 'age', 'What', 'exclaim', ""n't"", 'movie', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'other', 'reviewers', 'claim', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'wrong', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'just', 'cover', 'Just', 'ghost', 'story', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'just', 'cover', 'engrossing', 'enthralling', 'cover', 'just', 'cover', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'deeply', 'personal', 'philosophical', 'message', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'just', 'Sixth', 'Sense', ""n't"", 'about', 'ghosts', 'Unbreakable', ""n't"", 'about', 'superheroes', 'super', 'villains', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'film', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'walking', 'dead', 'especially', 'relationships', 'showed', 'how', 'take', 'other', 'granted', 'often', 'only', 'come', 'grips', 'sleepwalking', 'lives', 'when', 'too', 'late', 'So', 'too', 'Unbreakable', 'middle-age', 'growing', 'up', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'reached', 'point', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'beaten', 'down', 'time', 'beaten', 'down', 'responsibility', 'swept', 'up', 'complexity', 'strange', 'middle-ground', 'life', 'when', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'youthful', 'indulgence', 'are', 'special', 'life', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'same', 'emotional', 'vein', 'clearly', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'modern', 'anomie', 'adults', 'secular', 'materialistic', 'society', 'robbed', 'mystery', 'basic', 'human', 'dignity', 'spirituality.It', 'perfect', 'message', 'generation', 'raised', 'idea', 't', 'are', 'unique', 'special', 'even', 'really', 'are', ""n't""]",Unbreakable

A significant factor, for me, was that I had no idea what this film was even about until I watched it.  So, if you don't know anything (or much) about the movie, just stop reading all the reviews and pick yourself up a copy and watch it.This movie is a thriller in a sense, but it is far from the tired old one-script thrillers we are used to (you know the plot of all those other shows: There is a hero and a bad guy, the bad guy, for some reason, has a personal vendetta against the good guy and vice versa.  The bad guy kidnaps the good guy's wife/child/friend/grandmother and uses the victim as bait to lure the good guy into a trap.  The good guy knows its a trap, but goes in anyway, frees the bait and kills the bad guy... how many times have we seen this over and over and over.  I'll give you a hint... they do this because teenagers who can barely read are the big spenders in thriller movies).In unbreakable, there is little in common with other thrillers.  The tension, along with the characters, is built slowly so that the viewer is drawn more personally into the show.  The script is fascinating, the direction is flawless.  The acting was great too.  I was never a Bruce Willis fan, but I thought he was surprisingly good in Sixth Sense, and he's not far behind in Unbreakable.  Samuel L. Jackson was very good here.  After the Star Wars movies, I forgot that he could act, but found new faith in Unbreakable.

532553,A2DJ8EU59M64DB,B00003CXQA,Marco Albini,"[5, 8]","THE STORY: I don't want to spoil the experience so all I'm saying is that David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is a Security Guard who is mysteriously unharmed after a train crash. He is contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose bones are very unstable and tend to break very fast. In David he has found his exact opposit and.. the birth of a comicbook hero.THE CAST: Bruce Willis is giving another great performance as Davud Dunn, a man who slowly realizes his purpose in the world. As much as I love to see him bleeding and cursing in action movies I think his serious roles are also convincing. His counterpart Elijah Price is played by a wonderful Samuel L. Jackson. He is one of those actors who can play anything. He has got great costume design and a.. well weird haircut to support the role.WRITING &amp; DIRECTING: The screenplay will be compared to the sixth sence. I guess it is M.Night Shyamalan's curse after its success. The story is much more inventive than the sixth sense and absolutely different. It is the most intelligent and interesting story Hollywood has come up with last year. Shyamalan directs the movie with very long shots, which lets you enjoy the great performances and slowly put you in the story. Although the movie moves very slow it never gets boring. There is always something to marvel at. Some shots are probably inspired by Hitchkock and taken to the next level. This movie features some of the most beautiful shots I have ever seen. There are repeating motives such as reflections and symetry. After the sixth sense Night came up with a much more mature film which will probably be something that isn't for everyone.ALL IN ALL: One of my all-time favourites. I don't know how Night got a brilliant idea like this. If you like comics you should take a look at this.

I can say however, the main character, played by Bruce Willis, is unbreakable, someone who lives through many disasters in his life without getting hurt. At the beginning of this movie he is in one of the greatest train disasters of all time where everyone else dies, yet he survives without getting so much as a scratch. It turns out he is also a little psychic as well -- you get that idea from the beginning of the movie but it's explored in more depth further into the movie -- those psychic skills lead him into some amazing adventures in this movie.The other leading actor, Samuel L. Jackson, is a comic book collector who marvels in superhero qualities of the heroes in those comics. He contacts Bruce Willis on the basis of his surviving this disaster without a scratch. His character is the direct opposite of unbreakable -- beginning in childbirth his bones break during birth and his life is plagued by injuries in situations where others might not even get hurt.  He is the breakable one.  Samuel L. Jackson's character pushes Bruce Willis's character to accept his amazing abilities, both psychic and physical.  That's when all the adventure begins.  There are plot twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Though the ending was a little disappointing, the movie was enjoyable as a whole.  Rent this one though, don't buy it unless you've seen it and you love it.

While most moviemakers would face the reality that moviegoers now EXPECT unbelieveable chase scenes, explosions, and impossible special effects, Shyamalan thankfully keeps the pace of the film consistent and eerily placid, providing the viewer with an uncommon viewing experience.For those who didn't like it, I think it's only because they didn't have a slot to put it in.

532562,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00003CXQA,Matthew Gladney,"[2, 9]","Let me give you the gist of a movie:1) The movie begins quietly enough, but then a sudden, jarring incident occurs, altering the protagonist's (Bruce Willis) life.  2) Things at home for the protagnist, mainly concerning his wife, are estranged, and he feels distant toward her.3) Someone needs his help, they are a weak person (perhaps afraid?), and look to him for help, comfort even.4) The person looking for help tries to convince the protagonist that he *is* special, that only he can save the day, etc.5) Meanwhile, the protagonist wonders what he can do to fix things at home  6) A character is slow to come to terms with the fact that he *does* have special powers, and then he finally uses them for good in a riveting scene which helps someone out  7) In the end, everything is set right at home, and the protagonist (Willis) can feel good about things.Now, I know most you are saying to yourself: &quot;He just reviewed the 'Sixth Sense', he's made some mistake!&quot;  Alas, only if that were true. You see, both the 'Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' follow the exact same plot-line (pretty much). Both films are directed by M. Night Shyamalan, but here, with 'Unbreakable', he's lost his deft touch present in the previous film.The main problems I had with 'Unbreakable':1) too similar, thematically, to the 'Sixth Sense', as stated above. And *this* film didn't make the plot nearly as interesting.2) the directing was way overdone. Shyamalan is on record as being very immodest about the success he had with 'Sixth Sense', and so I guess he felt it necessary to incorporate Alfred Hitchock style camera angles in his latest venture - perhaps to prove something? But what? Some of the shots border on nauseating, and some are just so completely odd (and OBVIOUSLY staged) that they *take away* from the film.3) the tone is too somber. I am NOT saying that I do not enjoy serious pieces of cinema, quite the contrary. What I *am* saying is that they have to be done well. 'Unbreakable's cinematography, acting, and total ambience is one of bleak gloom. Is is really too stark an image.4) due to the writing, and the things listed in point 3, the characters come across as stiff and uninteresting, and the plot seems a tad odd. Never once was I actually *drawn into* the story, instead I merely sat as a passive observer.So, in closing, let me just say that I *do* enjoy different, slower-paced films, but they have to be handled very well. I did not feel as though 'Unbreakable' was. And, next time, Mr. Shyamalan needs to think of a different set of plots and themes than what he has already used before.That might make the movie so much more refreshing.",2,Seen it before somewhere....,991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,2665,"['Let', 'give', 'gist', 'movie:1', 'movie', 'quietly', 'enough', 'then', 'sudden', 'jarring', 'incident', 'occurs', 'altering', 'protagonist', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'life', '2', 'Things', 'home', 'protagnist', 'mainly', 'concerning', 'wife', 'are', 'estranged', 'distant', 'her.3', 'Someone', 'help', 'are', 'weak', 'person', 'perhaps', 'afraid', 'look', 'help', 'comfort', 'even.4', 'person', 'looking', 'help', 'tries', 'convince', 'protagonist', 'special', 'only', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'etc.5', 'Meanwhile', 'protagonist', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'fix', 'things', 'home', '6', 'character', 'slow', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'have', 'special', 'powers', 'then', 'finally', 'good', 'riveting', 'scene', 'someone', '7', 'end', 'everything', 'set', 'right', 'home', 'protagonist', 'Willis', 'can', 'feel', 'good', 'things.Now', 'know', 'most', 'are', 'saying', 'quot', 'just', 'reviewed', ""'Sixth"", 'Sense', 'made', 'mistake', 'quot', 'Alas', 'only', 'were', 'true', 'see', ""'Sixth"", 'Sense', ""'Unbreakable"", 'follow', 'exact', 'same', 'plot-line', 'pretty', 'much', 'films', 'are', 'directed', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'here', ""'Unbreakable"", 'lost', 'deft', 'touch', 'present', 'previous', 'film.The', 'main', 'problems', 'had', ""'Unbreakable':1"", 'too', 'similar', 'thematically', ""'Sixth"", 'Sense', 'stated', '*this*', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'plot', 'nearly', 'interesting.2', 'directing', 'was', 'way', 'overdone', 'Shyamalan', 'record', 'being', 'very', 'immodest', 'success', 'had', ""'Sixth"", 'Sense', 'so', 'guess', 'felt', 'necessary', 'incorporate', 'Alfred', 'Hitchock', 'style', 'camera', 'latest', 'venture', 'perhaps', 'prove', 'something', 'what', 'shots', 'border', 'nauseating', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'completely', 'odd', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'staged', '*take', 'away*', 'film.3', 'tone', 'too', 'somber', 'am', 'NOT', 'saying', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'serious', 'pieces', 'cinema', 'contrary', 'What', '*am*', 'saying', 'have', 'be', 'done', 'well', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'total', 'ambience', 'one', 'bleak', 'gloom', 'really', 'too', 'stark', 'image.4', 'due', 'writing', 'things', 'listed', 'point', '3', 'characters', 'come', 'stiff', 'uninteresting', 'plot', 'tad', 'odd', 'Never', 'once', 'was', 'actually', '*drawn', 'into*', 'story', 'instead', 'merely', 'sat', 'passive', 'observer.So', 'closing', 'let', 'just', 'say', '*do*', 'enjoy', 'different', 'slower-paced', 'films', 'have', 'be', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'feel', ""'Unbreakable"", 'was', 'next', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'think', 'different', 'set', 'plots', 'themes', 'what', 'already', 'used', 'before.That', 'might', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'refreshing']",Unbreakable

Studio executives hoped that the movie, a supernatural thriller, would perform well and make a profit. To their surprise and delight, it became a smash hit all around the world. The movie was The Sixth Sense. As you most likely know, it was about a child psychologist [Bruce Willis] who tried to help a young boy [Haley Joel Osment] who claimed to see dead people. In his newest movie, Unbreakable, Mr. Shyamalan again returns to the occult with a spooky tale about a man who is a super hero and doesn't know it.Bruce Willis again stars. This time he is David Dunn, a mild-mannered, frequently depressed guy who works as a security guard in Philadelphia. As the movie opens, he is returning home on a train. He gets an odd feeling, and the next thing he knows, there is a terrible wreck. He is the only passenger who survives. His wife and son are ecstatic. Not only he is alive, he has escaped without a scratch. The fact remains that David and his wife, Audrey [Robin Wright Penn], are planning to divorce. The train trip was for a job interview in New York City. Though estranged from Audrey, David is exceptionally close to his son, Joseph [Spencer Treat Clark]. The impending separation is tearing everyone apart.Leaving a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note engraved with the words ""Limited Edition"". Inside, someone has written, ""How many times in your life have you been sick?"" He traces the note to a chic art gallery that specializes in comic book art. The note was written by the owner, Elijah [Samuel L. Jackson], a strange and slightly ominous man who suffers from a genetic disease that causes his bones to be brittle and to break easily. It is he who thinks that David is more than he appears to be. Elihah tells him he may be someone with special powers, someone who can tap into the forces of good in order to fight evil. Naturally, David thinks Elijah is a nut case. He even orders Joseph, who as accompanied him, not to drink the water Elijah has given him. Yet he also senses something in what Elijah has said. Soon, odd things start to happen, and David finally realizes that the answer to Elijah's question is that he has never been sick a day in his life. But what does this fact, as well as recent events, mean? And what is Elijah's interest in it?There are many similarities here to The Sixth Sense, including a surprise ending. For several reasons, Unbreakable doesn't work quite as well. It has many interesting elements, including lots of references to comic book heroes. There is a theme involving water that is excellent. The photography and the set decoration are impeccable. The cast is great. But Unbreakable is even more dark and brooding than The Sixth Sense, its pace is slower, and its ending is even more far fetched. As a result, many viewers will find it less enjoyable. I don't think this is all Shyamalan's fault. When your last picture was a boxoffice phenomenon, it truly is a tough act to follow.I was intrigued to discover that the director's next project, Signs, is about a farm couple who finds mysterious crop circles in their fields. The supernatural theme continues. Wouldn't it be great if Shyamalan turned out to be the next Alfred Hitchcock by devoting himself to just one genre or theme? I thought of this while watching Unbreakable because, after all, even movies by The Master of Suspense varied greatly in success, both artistically and commercially. It was the body of work by Hitchcock that was important, and I hope the same proves true of Mt.

I figured after about three minutes he hadn't been sick... why did Shayamalan have to tour us through the bloody details.  But yet I sat, wanting desperately to be entertained... yes, entertained - there are films that propose deeper levels of discourse and ask for a little patience in exploring them (something like Pi or Gattaca or Mother Night comes to mind to name a few 90's films) but this isn't one of them.  This is a simple tale - almost fable like akin to the Star Wars trilogy not The Seventh Seal or Shindler's List - it's got to entertain you.  Basically, this ended up being two hours of a dope discovering he has super powers where the average film goers would have known at least ten years before the movie began.  The reason I mention that the train crash is off screen is it sets up a comparison to another film of this year - Cast Away (also not incredibly deep).  Immediately before fifty minutes where one character will be on screen, we see a dramatic plane crash.  Why does Zemeckis show us all this?  The answer is simple... the audience needs to see what goes down because the character's ongoing state of mind is going to be the only source of dramatic tension.  Unbreakable asks us to care about its protagonist mind state and its voyage of discovery in the same way...yet we don't see what he's gone through.  Maybe if I saw the crash I'd understand why he seems so dopish and confused.  Maybe the trauma of the crash would sustain the audience through the next unbearable hour.  By the way I'm an avid comic fan and collector... trust me it doesn't help.",2,Breakable,987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,2775,"['where', 'have', 'part', 'company', 'contemporaries', 'who', 'cry', 'clamor', 'higher', 'standard', 'American', 'movies', 'Yes', 'movie', 'different', 'quirky', 'unpredictable', 'point', ""n't"", 'make', 'best', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bread', 'understood', 'movie', 'just', 'understood', 'Postman', 'Titanic', 'other', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'Hollywood', 'trash', 'not', 'good', 'because', 'other', 'reason', 'boring', 'prickly', 'little', 'critics', 'who', 'want', 'accuse', 'not', 'having', 'attention', 'span', 'greater', 'four', 'seconds', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'sense', 'indignant', 'outrage', 'just', 'listen', 'movie', 'off', 'screen', 'train', 'crash', 'followed', 'least', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'man', 'waking', 'coma', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'many', 'days', 'been', 'sick', 'Question', 'provided', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'other', 'people', 'fall', 'ill', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'sick', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'may', 'ask', 'mother', 'childhood', 'illnesses', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'boss', 'wife', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'often', ""'d"", 'taken', 'ill', 'recent', 'years', 'intelligent', 'audience', 'member', 'felt', 'someone', 'was', 'literally', 'battering', 'head', 'bat', 'figured', 'three', 'minutes', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'sick', 'why', 'did', 'Shayamalan', 'have', 'tour', 'bloody', 'details', 'yet', 'sat', 'wanting', 'desperately', 'be', 'entertained', 'yes', 'entertained', 'are', 'films', 'propose', 'deeper', 'levels', 'discourse', 'ask', 'little', 'patience', 'exploring', 'something', 'Pi', 'Gattaca', 'Mother', 'Night', 'mind', 'name', 'few', '90', 'films', ""n't"", 'one', 'simple', 'tale', 'almost', 'fable', 'akin', 'Star', 'Wars', 'not', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'Shindler', 'List', 'got', 'entertain', 'Basically', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'two', 'hours', 'dope', 'discovering', 'super', 'powers', 'where', 'average', 'film', 'goers', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'least', 'ten', 'years', 'movie', 'began', 'reason', 'mention', 'train', 'crash', 'screen', 'up', 'comparison', 'film', 'year', 'Cast', 'Away', 'also', 'not', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'Immediately', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'screen', 'see', 'dramatic', 'plane', 'crash', 'Why', 'Zemeckis', 'show', 'answer', 'simple', 'audience', 'see', 'what', 'down', 'character', 'ongoing', 'state', 'mind', 'going', 'be', 'only', 'source', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Unbreakable', 'care', 'protagonist', 'mind', 'state', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'same', 'way', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'gone', 'Maybe', 'saw', 'crash', ""'d"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'dopish', 'confused', 'Maybe', 'trauma', 'crash', 'would', 'sustain', 'audience', 'next', 'unbearable', 'hour', 'way', ""'m"", 'avid', 'comic', 'fan', 'collector', 'trust', ""n't"", 'help']",Unbreakable

532570,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00003CXQA,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[2, 2]","Why? Cos you immediately compare the two! I've seen Sixth Sense a few times before this, and I knew there was going to be a twist to the film, just like Sixth Sense. So you're constantly looking out for the twist coming, and trying to second guess what is going to happen, or what could happen to the character. I found this ruined the movie slightly, I probably would have liked it more if I could have seen it from a fresh perspective.It's such a shame that Unbreakable didn't do as well as Sixth Sense at the box office, cos it's an amazing movie to watch. It's fascinating to watch how it quickly reels the viewer - and how much you get annoyed when someone phones at the crucial moment! However, I did find it a lot slower than Sixth Sense, and I hated how it was rated a 12 - so much more could have been done, for example they could have actually shown the train derail, with a higher rating.Bruce Willis seems to be a favourite of M. Night Shyamalan's, and quite right too! He's been terrific in both Sixth Sense and this, and once again, shows he's great with kids, since he's so great with the little guy who plays his son. He also has a lot less hair in this movie - which results in him NOT needing a hairstylist! Sorry, I found that really funny!Samuel L Jackson just didn't look like his usual self in this movie. I dunno whether it was the weird, big hair or what. But his character was cool. What annoyed me at first, is when you see the baby/young Elijah, he's very much often reflected in glass. Stupid me, I didn't make the connection, cos his &quot;name&quot; is Mr Glass - as in &quot;the kids call me Mr Glass&quot;. Purely cos he breaks easily. As a newborn, he's reflected in the mirror; as a young child, he's seen reflected in a blank TV screen; he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David's (Bruce) car; he's often seen reflected in the glass frames in his art gallery, and what I found strangest of all, his walking stick is made of glass! (Although it provides a pretty spectacular scene when he falls and it shatters). As I said I didn't make the connection, but instead, I thought it was to do with him not wanting to see himself, because of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta? Just the (strange) way I see things!Unbreakable focuses heavily on comic books, including a funny scene, where Elijah brings them down around him, and then picks the one he wants! There's also a lot about colour in the movie, particularly, what I noticed, all the 'bad' guys are very often wearing bright colours, so look out for that if you can. (Oh, kinda giving the game away there!)What I found annoying to start with, but then began to like, was the amount of 'important' stuff that was introduced upside down. It gets tedious trying to twist your head to see what the hell you're looking at! These included: the TV train wreck footage; Elijah's first comic book; the &quot;Keep Out&quot; sign guarding the train's wreckage; the silver gun with the black grip, which Elijah sees in the belt of the man with the camouflage jacket while lying on his back; Audrey in the car crash flashback and Elijah's face after he falls down the stairs.This was a terrific movie, so don't believe all the bad reviews you see. If you get a chance to see it on DVD, go for it! I think certain scenes would have been much more effective on the big screen, particularly the train station scene.Oh, and watch out for M. Night Shyamalan doing a trademark - appearing in the movie! He appears twice in this, as two separate characters. (He also appears in Sixth Sense, as one of the doctors tending to Cole)Oh, and I did NOT get the twist!

Instead I found a slow-paced movie for which I kept waiting for something occur.  Bruce Willis gives one of his sleepiest performances as a security guard,who has unbreakable bones and seems to be able to sense bad people.Samuel L. Jackson is the opposite in that he was born with incredibly weak bones and goes through life constantly in and out of hospitals with fractures.  His one solace in life is comic books.  Jackson is obsessed with finding his opposite and he does this by looking for survivors of disasters.  He seeks out Willis, who is the sole survivor of a train wreck.  We later find out that Willis has never been sick and he may have survived some other disasters as well.You keep expecting Jackson to ask Willis for a bone marrow transplant or some other type operation to strengthen his bones but Jackson's motives are inspired by the comic books that hold his fascination.The director seemed to miss some opportunities in the movie.  We have a scene at the beginning, where Willis tries to pick-up his female seat mate on the train and then after the train wrecks, we know that she is dead so you later expect something more out of Willis and his feelings.Jackson also comes off as a loony throughout the film and you wonder why Willis ever talks to him at all.There is one brilliant scene, where Jackson is trying to sell a comic art print to a man and goes through the whole history behind the print.  At the end of Jackson's passionate rendition, the man says he will take the print to give to his 4-year old son (who obviously would have no sense as to the value of the print).

He is obviously a young director/writer with a vivid imagination, and perhaps a little bit too much belief in his artistry.  His third film, &quot;Signs&quot; wasn't all that great, and this middle entry, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; suffers from too much artistic input.  Now that may sound crazy, but in watching the special feature in which Night discusses his deleted scenes, and especially in the inclusion of his first home movie, I felt that his ego is a little too much considering this movie.I think the plot is very intriguing, and there are some wonderful shots, including the use of comic book colors to heighten the sense of unreality.  Bruce Willis and Spencer Treat Clark do a fantastic job in their roles; Willis is a lot better actor than many people credit him for.  Clark is an uncanny little actor, who can be seen in this year's excellent &quot;Mystic River.&quot;  I found three major problems:  first, Shamalayan over-utilized his &quot;from a distance&quot; shots.  There were too many of them where all this activity is going on in front of the leading characters and it served no purpose to me other than artistic experimentation.  The other two things wrong with this movie, for me, were the lackluster performances of both Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.

532582,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00003CXQA,Michael Crane,"[0, 0]","I think the problem with this movie was that people were expecting non-stop action, and a cheesy story with no real plot.  Sure, Bruce Willis is in it, so it HAS to have a lot of cool action and stuff, right?  Wrong.  If this movie was done the wrong way, yeah it could've had a lot of pointless chases and fights and explosions, and so on.  Don't get me wrong, all of those ingredients are great for some movies: just not THIS one.""Unbreakable,"" is a superb, and yet, underrated film that should've gotten more recognition.  This is a dark thriller that messes with your mind and emotions.  It has great acting, a great story, and most of all, an ingenious plot.  Not to mention one amazing score.  (Check out the soundtrack!)And the DVD is really great.  It looks great, it sounds great, and it has TONS of special features.  I enjoyed watching the deleted scenes.  (Try to watch the one where Samuel L. Jackson remembers when he was a kid and went to a carnival.  It's so painful to watch, and yet well constructed at the same time.)Bruce Willis is amazing in this movie, proving that he doesn't have to be in movies with only non-stop actions.  Samuel L. Jackson is also outstanding.  They couldn't had found a better person for the part.Overall, I loved the movie, and it continues to be one of my favorites.  If you like dark movies with more of a plot than action, such as ""Memento,"" ""Frailty,"" and ""Insomnia,"" then this is the movie for you.  If you want a movie with non-stop action and really no story or plot, then get something else.  This is a really great film that should've been recognized more.  Very unappreciated, but a lot of great films are.  I guess it all comes down to taste in the end.  Since you already know what to expect, just give it a shot.  If you know what you're in for, chances are you will enjoy the movie more.P.S.  Non-stop action and a lot of cool explosions does NOT make a movie great.

532583,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00003CXQA,Michael J. Mazza,"[4, 6]","&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.  The film tells the story of David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), who miraculously survives a train crash and suffers no injuries.  After this his life becomes intertwined with that of Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), a man with an unusual disability.  Elijah's obsession with David drives the plot of the film.&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a powerful drama--it's an intriguing deconstruction of the whole notion of the &quot;comic book superhero.&quot;  Shyamalan does a superb job of weaving a paranormal storyline into the lives of characters who are fully fleshed and very real.Jackson and Willis are an intriguing and unnerving screen duo.  Jackson's bold, operatic performance is stunning, and is perfectly complemented by Willis' subtle but equally powerful work.  They are backed up by some excellent supporting performances.The DVD edition of the film is full of superb supplementary material.  Especially intriguing are the deleted scenes, which are preceded by fascinating commentary by writer-director Shyamalan.  This bonus material really illuminates the creative process behind this film and vividly shows Shyamalan's passion and craftsmanship as a cinematic artist.In addition to being intelligently written and superbly acted, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a visually stylish film that is full of memorable images.  Like Sam Raimi's &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (a very different but also excellent take on the superhero genre), this film raises questions about heroism, destiny, choice, and how extraordinary people fit into the larger society.

532585,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00003CXQA,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 0]","There are some out in the world that say that comic-books are humanities? last great link to the ancient art form of expressing messages and stories through pictures. Since the dawn of human civilization when cavemen drew on walls to showcase fantastic, possibly even exaggerated, achievements of the people of the era, man has sought to express stories of ?heroes?, whether they be true or legendary, through the use of pictures so that other people in their travels through the land would know of that person?s great achievements and spread them throughout the tribes. In the centuries that would follow, this method of communication would be passed down to the ancient Egyptians who would develop the pictorial language which they would use the walls of their temples to tell the legends of their gods and their deceased rulers. Even to this very day this language art form can be found in the average comic-book shop but the surge of comic-book franchises quickly being adapted to the big screen can lead to its demise, with more interested in the aspect of profits rather then the messages their art expresses.The story centers on a man whose survival from a tragic train accident begins to unravel a mystery into who he actually is and what he was destined to do with his life. While on a train ride from New York, which he had gone to seeking a higher-profile security position, to his home town of Philadelphia, David Dunne contemplates on his life and wonders why he has this inscrutable feeling of sadness, one of which he finds himself with each and every day of his life ever since a near-fatal car accident years ago brought a direct halt to his college football career. With a flash, David finds himself lying on a bed within a hospital with no clear understanding of how he got there. After receiving strange looks from doctors and nurses checking in on him, David discovers that he is the lone survivor of a tragic train accident that took the lives of one hundred and thirty-one people. Not only that but after careful examination there appears to be not a single scratch, bruise, or mark on David?s body. David begins to fall deeper into seclusion and sadness contemplating on why he alone survived the train accident but so many more fortunate innocents did not. Why was he special? After attending a memorial offered to those who died in train accident, David discovers a note on the windshield of his car that asks the question, ?How many days of your life have you been sick?? After meeting with the mysterious Elijah Price, who Dunne first dismisses as a man who?s sickness (low protein that makes he?s bones easily breakable) has taken over his sanity, David takes the opportunity his survival from the train accident has given him to patch up the relationship with his wife and son. But the more David puts off the eccentric comic-book curator, Elijah Price, the more the truth behind the great mysteries of his life is revealed to him, in that the David may be one of the great ?superheroes? Elijah?s comic books once harkened about. The story for Unbreakable may not have had quite the impact director/writer M. Night Shyamalan had been hoping for in its initial release and that may be attributed to the fact that it was created well before its proper time. For those who witness the magnificence of this film will find its thought-provoking concepts of heroes and villains, both in the comic-book world and how those are reflected in every day life, absolutely chilling, more so when one factors in the film?s pre-9/11 release.As with most M. Night Shyamalan films, the cast of Unbreakable, namely those who?s screen time consisted of more then a mere cameo in the film?s nearly two hour timeframe, is remarkably limited with the course of the film?s story centralized on the actions of two characters that of Bruce Willis? David Dunne and Samuel L. Jackson?s Elijah Price. Bruce Willis? performance is nothing short of spectacular but even that heap of praise may be selling his role short. In essence, Willis takes on the type of role his co-star in The Sixth Sense, Haley Joel Osment, dealt with, that being a character that is so sensationally challenging and complex that only the most talented of actors can pull off the role. Not only does Willis have the play the role of the victim early on in the film but he has to seamlessly transition from that aspect to that of the rising hero by the film?s end, which not easy to do in any film and even more difficult with a script as intricate as Shyamalan?s. Samuel L. Jackson does a magnificent job in the role of Elijah Price, the mysterious comic-book artwork curator who uses his knowledge of the comic-book universe to reveal to David Dunne his true identity. The reason his role works as well as it does is the way both Willis and Jackson play off each other and how the character, while in the process of helping Dunne realize who he is, hints at the secret identity he has held back from everyone including himself. The only complaint came from Robin Wright Penn?s role as the wife of David Dunne, none of which concerned her particular portrayal of the character but rather the way she was scripted. Either she?s too whiny or she?s sitting idly in the background contributing nothing to move the story along. If were given more to do or she had a greater impact on who David Dunne will become by the end of the film, we would care more about her character but that doesn?t exist in the film audiences are seeing now.Overall, Unbreakable was greatly underappreciated at the time of its late 2000 release but since then the traumatic events that occurred on September 11th, 2001, as well as the realization that America is, and has been, in a war to combat terrorism, not only in our country but abroad, have made this film of greater significance to see in this time of our nation?s history. Triggered by those events, Americans have awakened to the truth, much in the same way David Dunne did, that ?there are extraordinary things inside themselves, as well as others? and we need not look far and wide to find ?supermen? when they live amongst us in our daily lives. Shyamalan demonstrates an increasing sense of maturity both in the script?s sophisticated dialogue as well as in the style in which he sets the complex group of characters. The rising director never ceases to amaze his audiences with the haunting atmospheres in which he set his films and the driving messages he invokes within in each and every one of them. All that can be said about this film is that it the Shyamalan?s best film to date, though Signs does come pretty closes to matching up with it based on overall satisfaction and quality. For those who have been significantly effected by the events of September 11th, whether you be a family member of a victim or simply another average American horrified watching the aftermath, Unbreakable the definitive film to raise your hopes and show to you that there are ?heroes? all around us, some whom need only to know it within themselves for that ?hero? aspect to find its way through their actions.",5,The Moose Hole - 'Unbreakable' is Remarkable,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,7112,"['are', 'world', 'say', 'comic-books', 'are', 'humanities', 'last', 'great', 'link',

532586,A9JA0MI0GFQ39,B00003CXQA,Mike Blaszczak,"[0, 0]","I deeply enjoy movies told in a comic book style, like The Crow. I didn't expect that from this movie, and was pleasantly surprised. I had read some critics who had panned the film, and didn't expect much.You're thrust into the life of David Dunn, a man who miraculously survives an incredible train wreck. The story has a slow start because the plot is very subtle. David has some problems, and the true conflict of the plot subtly emerges from each of the lesser issues he faces.The story is told in Shyamalan's slowly revealing style, where we learn little bits about the character nad their personalities. Samuel Jackson plays a fabulously underrated role as a crazed villan, and his carefully crafted character truly makes the story.The movie, throughout, has a comic-book feel in both the story line and the camera work. (Though, I got a little tired of the top-down spinning angle which was reused several times.) The realization and climax of the movie are well-told and wonderfully acted. While I would have enjoyed more examination of the aftermath, the story remained well-balanced.The only thing that bothered me about this movie was the extra features. I felt that the deleted sceens would really have helped build the characters.

532588,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00003CXQA,Mike Stone,"[2, 6]","It's been a while since I've seen a thriller with a more assured opening.  The flashback to Elijah Price's (Samuel L. Jackson) birth.  The scenes of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) on the train, trying in vain to make some human contact.  And the train wreck, never shown but subtly alluded too in a way that made my heart skip a beat, that will bring both these men together.  These moments are handled stylishly, but with a genuine purpose.Director M. Night Shyamalan frames his shots wonderfully, controlling the symbolism with an iron hand and creating the tone with a painter's palette.  Watch for his repeated use of the motif of things turned upside down (a comic book, a child watching TV, etc.) that, while being brutally obvious, never becomes heavy handed.  And he seems to drag a wonderful performance out of Willis, an actor who usually bores me.  Bruce plays a character in the midst of some depressing times, but manages to imbue him with a sense of play and willingness to go on.  The film was building up a reservoir of good will; I was willing to let it meander, with a purpose, towards the twist ending that I'd heard so much about without learning of its details.Sadly, things horribly go wrong.Like Icarus, the film's wings melt when it tries to fly too close to the sun.  Around the time David goes to meet Elijah for the first time in his art store, and Jackson lays bare the film's narrative conceit, Shyamalan ceases his attempts to make a movie, and what follows is more like a thesis paper:""It is the purpose of this film to prove that comic books, like hieroglyphics, are an important communications tool in contemporary society, shaping our myths and defining what it means to be human.""Whatever.  I didn't buy it.  Maybe if I had a comic book collection of over 3,000 issues, and I'd spent over a year of my life reading through them (as the film's title card declares to be average statistics for a comics fan) I might have been able to follow the film down this precarious plane.  But as things stand, I thought it was just silly.Even though he begins the film with promise, and the idea of him as an unwilling, unknowing superhero is somewhat intriguing, Willis blows all the good will he'd built up in the film's first third.  He rarely shifts out of first gear, playing all his scenes with that self-important whispered delivery he's developed over recent years.  It subverts the few moments of charisma that he vainly tries to engineer, such as a dark but funny scene in his weight room, where he accidentally discovers some unusual powers.  (Question:  If David Dunn were truly ""unbreakable"", wouldn't he have been able to keep some of his hair?  Just curious...)Taking their cue from the film's star, the rest of the cast seems to have trained at the Bruce Willis School of Comatose Acting.  Samuel L. Jackson is stripped of his vitality as he's saddled with a hideous fright wig and a wheelchair, not to mention of series of ludicrous monologues, that aim for philosophical but land firmly on pretentious.  Robin Wright Penn is quite ridiculous as Willis' wife.  She tries in vain to bring some humanity to Audrey, but is weighed down by some clunker dialogue of her own (&quot;No shooting friends, Joseph!"" she says to her son at one point, with utmost sincerity; is a laughably bad line that got funnier and funnier after dozens of times rewinding to listen to it again and again).  Spencer Treat Clark as Willis and Penn's son is not up to the task of the emotional scenes he's asked to play, and his affection for his father has no basis in reality.As for that notorious surprise ending, well, Shyamalan proves once again that he knows how to catch the audience off-guard.  Only by the time the sheet was pulled back, and the mystery revealed, I found myself asking ""Yeah... so what?""  By that time, the movie had so lost my trust that the ending truly didn't matter.  If the rest of the movie were up to par, the ending would have been a mind blower.  As it is, it is just a curiosity.  Waiting for this final revelation was the only thing that kept me going.  If not for that final gimmick, I would have given up much earlier.The true, hardcore comic fan may get a kick out of this flick.  For the rest of us, unable or unwilling to buy into its contrived mythology, the goings will be a lot harder.  I found it to be a sloppy and sub-standard piece of filmmaking, loaded with potential but unable to nurture any of it to a satisfying product.",2,"Half good movie, half meandering thesis",1000512000,"09 15, 2001",2001,4482,"['been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thriller', 'more', 'assured', 'opening', 'flashback', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'birth', 'scenes', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'train', 'trying', 'vain', 'make', 'human', 'contact', 'train', 'wreck', 'never', 'shown', 'subtly', 'alluded', 'too', 'way', 'made', 'heart', 'beat', 'will', 'bring', 'men', 'together', 'moments', 'are', 'handled', 'stylishly', 'genuine', 'purpose.Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'shots', 'wonderfully', 'controlling', 'symbolism', 'iron', 'hand', 'creating', 'tone', 'painter', 'palette', 'Watch', 'repeated', 'use', 'motif', 'things', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'comic', 'book', 'child', 'watching', 'TV', 'etc', 'being', 'brutally', 'obvious', 'never', 'heavy', 'handed', 'drag', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Willis', 'actor', 'who', 'usually', 'Bruce', 'character', 'midst', 'depressing', 'times', 'imbue', 'sense', 'play', 'willingness', 'go', 'film', 'was', 'building', 'up', 'reservoir', 'good', 'will', 'was', 'willing', 'let', 'meander', 'purpose', 'twist', 'ending', ""'d"", 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'learning', 'details.Sadly', 'things', 'horribly', 'go', 'wrong.Like', 'Icarus', 'film', 'wings', 'melt', 'when', 'fly', 'too', 'close', 'sun', 'time', 'David', 'meet', 'Elijah', 'first', 'time', 'art', 'store', 'Jackson', 'bare', 'film', 'narrative', 'conceit', 'Shyamalan', 'attempts', 'make', 'movie', 'what', 'more', 'thesis', 'paper', 'purpose', 'film', 'prove', 'comic', 'books', 'hieroglyphics', 'are', 'important', 'communications', 'tool', 'contemporary', 'society', 'shaping', 'myths', 'defining', 'what', 'be', 'human.', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Maybe', 'had', 'comic', 'book', 'collection', '3,000', 'issues', ""'d"", 'spent', 'year', 'life', 'reading', 'film', 'title', 'card', 'be', 'average', 'statistics', 'comics', 'fan', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'follow', 'film', 'down', 'precarious', 'plane', 'things', 'stand', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'silly.Even', 'film', 'promise', 'idea', 'unwilling', 'unknowing', 'superhero', 'somewhat', 'intriguing', 'Willis', 'good', 'will', ""'d"", 'built', 'up', 'film', 'first', 'third', 'rarely', 'shifts', 'first', 'gear', 'playing', 'scenes', 'self-important', 'whispered', 'delivery', 'developed', 'recent', 'years', 'few', 'moments', 'charisma', 'vainly', 'engineer', 'such', 'dark', 'funny', 'scene', 'weight', 'room', 'where', 'accidentally', 'unusual', 'powers', 'Question', 'David', 'Dunn', 'were', 'truly', 'unbreakable', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'hair', 'Just', 'curious', 'Taking', 'cue', 'film', 'star', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'trained', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'School', 'Comatose', 'Acting', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'stripped', 'vitality', 'saddled', 'hideous', 'fright', 'wig', 'wheelchair', 'not', 'mention', 'series', 'ludicrous', 'monologues', 'aim', 'philosophical', 'land', 'firmly', 'pretentious', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'Willis', 'wife', 'vain', 'bring', 'humanity', 'Audrey', 'weighed', 'down', 'clunker', 'dialogue', 'own', 'quot', 'shooting', 'friends', 'Joseph', 'son', 'one', 'point', 'utmost', 'sincerity', 'laughably', 'bad', 'line', 'got', 'funnier', 'funnier', 'dozens', 'times', 'rewinding', 'listen', 'again', 'again', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'Willis', 'Penn', 'son', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'asked', 'play', 'affection', 'father', 'basis', 'reality.As', 'notorious', 'surprise', 'ending', 'well', 'Shyamalan', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'catch', 'audience', 'off-guard', 'Only', 'time', 'sheet', 'was', 'pulled', 'back', 'mystery', 'revealed', 'found', 'asking', 'Yeah', 'so', 'what', 'time', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'lost', 'trust', 'ending', 'truly', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'rest', 'movie', 'were', 'up', 'par', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mind', 'blower', 'just', 'curiosity', 'Waiting', 'final', 'revelation', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'going', 'not', 'final', 'gimmick', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'much', 'earlier.The', 'true', 'hardcore', 'comic', 'fan', 'may', 'get', 'kick', 'flick', 'rest', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'buy', 'contrived', 'mythology', 'goings', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'harder', 'found', 'be', 'sloppy', 'sub-standard', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'loaded', 'potential', 'unable', 'nurture', 'satisfying', 'product']",Unbreakable
532589,A2RCXHM9298L75,B00003CXQA,Mike Wells,"[3, 5]","M.Night Shyamalen had a difficult job on his hands in making a movie to follow up the tremendously successful Sixth Sense, but with Unbreakable, I feel he actually exceeds all expectations by bettering Sixth Sense.We are introduced to David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a man who, remarkably, is the only survivor of an horrific train crash. In fact, he doesn't have a single injury to show for it. One man who happens to notice this is Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), an obscure comic book expert who has a bizarre theory on why Willis survived. Price was born with a fragile bone structure, and spent a tortured childhood knowing that even the smallest fall could break any number of bones in his body. Dunn, on the other hand, was the opposite. Neither he nor his wife Audrey (Robin Wright) could ever remember a time when he had taken time off work through illness. Price believes that the two of them are linked, at different ends of a curve. The film follows Dunn as he struggles to come to grips with who he is, and what he is capable of.It is a fascinating story with a great deal of depth to it, and it is extremely atmospheric, at times even spooky. The performances are excellent; Willis proved in Sixth Sense that he has some versatiliy, and he bettered that performance here with an excellently understated portrayal of Dunn. There was also a great chemistry between him and Samuel L Jackson, who was intense, and suprisingly chilling as Price. A geuninely thought-provoking and unusual film, Unbreakable is utterly riveting, and one of the best films of the last fifteen months - well worth buying.",5,"Better than Sixth Sense - dark, spooky and chilling.",1015286400,"03 5, 2002",2002,1605,"['M.Night', 'Shyamalen', 'had', 'difficult', 'job', 'hands', 'making', 'movie', 'follow', 'up', 'tremendously', 'successful', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'feel', 'actually', 'expectations', 'bettering', 'Sixth', 'Sense.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'man', 'who', 'remarkably', 'only', 'survivor', 'horrific', 'train', 'crash', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'injury', 'show', 'One', 'man', 'who', 'notice', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'obscure', 'comic', 'book', 'expert', 'who', 'bizarre', 'theory', 'why', 'Willis', 'survived', 'Price', 'was', 'born', 'fragile', 'bone', 'structure', 'spent', 'tortured', 'childhood', 'knowing', 'even', 'smallest', 'fall', 'could', 'break', 'number', 'bones', 'body', 'Dunn', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'opposite', 'wife', 'Audrey', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'could', 'ever', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'off', 'work', 'illness', 'Price', 'two', 'are', 'linked', 'different', 'ends', 'curve', 'film', 'Dunn', 'come', 'grips', 'who', 'what', 'capable', 'of.It', 'fascinating', 'story', 'great', 'deal', 'depth', 'extremely', 'atmospheric', 'times', 'even', 'spooky', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Willis', 'proved', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'versatiliy', 'bettered', 'performance', 'here', 'excellently', 'understated', 'portrayal', 'Dunn', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'who', 'was', 'intense', 'suprisingly', 'chilling', 'Price', 'geuninely', 'thought-provoking', 'unusual', 'film', 'Unbreakable', 'utterly', 'riveting', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'last', 'fifteen', 'months', 'well', 'buying']",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan, explores the possibility of such preposterous hypothesis in his film, Unbreakable.David Dunn (Willis) is a security guard, whose family life is crumbling. A fatal train accident miraculously leaves David as the only survivor, without a singular scratch or psychological trauma. Such strange event catches the attention of Elijah Price (Jackson).Carrier of a disease that makes him extremely fragile, Elijah has gallant ideas about David, who demonstrates skepticism and thinks in the beginning that Elijah is crazy... until slowly, he begins to discover amazing things...We must not be confused by the similarities between Unbreakable and Sixth Sense: certainly both were written and directed by Shyamalan, starred Willis, set in Philadelphia and structured in three acts, but the similarities end there. While Sixth Sense was a character drama with a supernatural touch, Unbreakable is a mysterious history with continuous growing suspense.Unbreakable tries to present to us, in the most realistic way possible, David and Elijah's journey towards the discovery of something ""greater"", beyond the human understanding, about ""that quality"" that makes some people different from the rest of humanity.Faith, coincidence and the presence of a sixth sense are constant subjects in this story, where two men opposed in many ways - physically, intellectually and philosophically- must learn to develop their instincts and to discover their mission in life. The atmosphere in the movie is less than chilling, full of anticipation and surprises.Using like reference the worlds displayed in heroes stories like Superman, Spiderman and such, Shyamalan tries to make us understand that the latter are not mythical stories where good faces evil, but human efforts to explain the very nature of the evil.The cinematographic style applied to the film maintains an involving and realistic tone: the images are deep, full of important actions; the sequences are long, full of sorrow, tension and complexity. The narrative is absorbent.While the central characters and their complicated emotional maps are exposed, we get caught by the unusual world the movie displays. Bruce Willis reflects a wide emotional turbulence as the reticent man who has to accept his destiny, while Jackson is magnetic like the man full of fantastic theories, worthy of a lunatic who has just escaped an asylum.Once again, Shyamalan demonstrates that he is a brilliant film director. Imaginative, able to surprise, confuse and please our expectations. His work in the direction keeps exploring new ways; his eagerness in the details is admirable.An unexpected end, although not as surprising as the one in Sixth Sense, will leave you with the sensation that Shyamalan, without no impudence, has made fun of us again.

I personally enjoy this film more than Sixth Sense. I am a fan of superhero films as well. I like that this is a new take on superheroes at the time.The movie revolves around this man named David Dunne, played by Bruce Willis. There was a train crash where no one survived but him. Later you find out he is basically unbreakable. You also have Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a character named Elijah Prince a.k.a Mr. Glass. He is essentially the villain to Bruce Willis. He is the one who tells David about his gift.The acting is good all around. I think Bruce Willis does a better job here than in Sixth Sense. I really like his dynamic with Samuel L. Jackson's character. My favorite scenes of the movie are when those two characters are talking to each other. The other characters are alright, but I did not care for them. I personally found David's wife to be annoying at times.The effects are great in this. The fights are not that great. However, I could forgive it because this is supposed to be a darker and more realistic take on a superhero. I also really like the theme of destiny that is played up in this film. In this film, unlike in most film, destiny is played up as not such a good thing.

While people often criticize this film for being too slow, and hard to understand, it still continues to be one of my favorite films. The fact that the films move slowly, is what gives the film its brilliance. The events unfold at a pace that really lets you soak in the story and what the characters are going through. The story succeeds on five different levels. The first being the trouble with David's job as a security guard and his fight to find his place in the world. The second is the trouble with his marriage, and David's relationship with his wife Audrey ( Robin Wright Penn).The third is the endless need to proove Elajah's theory wrong. The fourth is with David's son Joseph ( Spencer Treat Clark) and how he thinks his dad is a hero. The fifth being what David does with his life, after he finds the truth. All of these aspects are blended together beautifully to create a well rounded story. M. Night Shyamalan is also known for his endings. The ending to &quot;Unbreakable&quot; will blow you away and is extremely shocking! Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark, and Robin Wright Penn are all spectacular in their roles. Each bring an important part to the story and are equally captivating. Finally, the camera work, set designs, and use of color are amazing, and really bring the story to life.The VISTA SERIES DVD however, might be the thing of all. The extras are out of this world. They really let you see the film in a whole new light. You get additional scenes, a behind the scenes documentary, and much much more.

After mysterious happenings, David begins to wonder who he really is, and what his purpose is on Earth.  Weak-boned Elijah (SAMUEL L. JACKSON) has an idea, that David may just be the one sent to Earth to guard and protect the people against his vicious enemy.  Along the way, David finds out things about himself that could change his life, and becomes afraid of the truth.  He is literally unbreakable.MY REVIEW:&quot;Like Director M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, this film also proves that he writes the greatest stories with great and unique plots that make you think.  This film rises on all levels and is an original motion picture that deserves a lot of credit.FOR THE STORY: &quot;A&quot;, I just love it, with the twists, the believable of the unbelievable.  This mysterious movie takes you beyond the depths of the mind and takes you into a world where fantasy really could be reality.  Not that I believe in the movie, but it is a great story that keeps you guessing, and the ending is most promising, and ties it all together.FOR THE DIRECTING: &quot;A&quot;, Shyamalan did a superb job working with the story and the actors.THE ACTING:BRUCE WILLIS: &quot;A&quot;, fun, intelligent role that creates a sort of wonder in your mind, cheering for him in the silent form.  Forget Spider-Man, Batman, Superman...  David Dunn is the new great superhero of today.  BRUCE WILLIS is remarkable and gives one of his best performances yet, siding with DIE HARD, ARMAGEDDON and THE SIXTH SENSE.SAMUEL L. JACKSON: &quot;B+&quot;, this is the third time around where JACKSON and WILLIS team up together, their previous projects being PULP FICTION and DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE.  Well this film takes JACKSON to new heights, BREAKABLE heights.  Playing the strong minded comic fan who seems to put all the pieces of David's life together, who seems to come up with all the answers.  Where JACKSON isn't the main character and can't show a regular performance, being, too, this character is quite different from anyone he's played before, this performance was still well done and deserves a lot of credit.  The end is a real snap backwards for his character, but JACKSON pulls it off flawlessly.ROBIN WRIGHT PENN: &quot;B&quot;, You can't say a whole lot about her character, being she was a smaller supporting character, David's wife Audrie.  She tries to tie things together again with her husband, being they've been having marriage problems.  Her character is played the average way I would've expected.  She feels that David surviving the train crash is like a second chance for her and she wants to start over.  But you can't give her the big &quot;A&quot; because she just isn't in the movie that much.  For those of you who can't remember her too well, her most famous role is playing TOM HANKS' love interest, JENNY, in the 1994 Academy Award Winning film, FORREST GUMP.'So OVERALL: You can't give this movie less than an &quot;A-&quot;, because it is a well thought out film with big surprises and talented celebrities pieceing together the movie.  Good movies like this don't come around too often, so catch this one while you can.  Go buy UNBREAKABLE for an unforettable ride of mysterious fun.&quot;- MJV &amp; the Movies.",5,A film that is Unbreakable in itself.

532595,ADFLBRY00Y70G,B00003CXQA,M. Lohrke,"[9, 12]","the great thing about m. night shyamalan's is that their never really *about* what they purport to be.  'the sixth sense' really isn't about a kid who sees dead people.  it's about family, namely a boy and his mother, and the intricacies of their relationship.  'signs' isn't a a movie about an alien invasion, but rather about a family coming together amidst a crisis and ultimately rediscovering their faith. 'the village' isn't about creepy crawlie creatures in the woods. again, it's about families--especially what parents will do to 'protect' children.  m. night shyamala's best film, 'unbreakable,' repeats a similar theme.  on the surface, yes, it's about a simple man accepting the superhero mantle. but it's much more than that: it's about a fractured family coming back together.  this familial theme is what makes shyamalan's work so important. he's not afraid to tackle family issues in a thoughtful, honest way, cleverly spun around the 'surprise ending' for which he's so famously known.several points about 'unbreakable.'1) the writing.  as usual, m. night shyamalan has more understanding and insight into human nautre in his earlobe that most screenwriters will possess over a lifetime.  his scripts are carefully measured out. he doesn't waste dialogue.  every line reveals something important, gives us insight into the characters or advances plot.  most importantly, his characters are real. for example:audrey dunn: when did you first think we might not make it?david dunn: i had a bad dream and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it would be ok.it doesn't get much better than that.2) the acting. the four central characters--bruce willis, robin wright-penn, samuel l. jackson and spencer treat clark--are amazingly good.  wright-penn's perfomance is especially notable. when she asks bruce willis' character if 'he's been with anyone else' is so heartbreaking and delivered with such intensity and honesty that she nearly steals the film in that one scene.  bruce willis lends his character a nice bit of gravitas. and watching his mope around as the emotionally detached david dunn is strangely riveting.  samuel l. jackson, well, you just have to see him with his frederick douglas coiff and purple suit. always reliable, jacks plays a nutty character without a surprising amout of restaint which makes him all the more believable.  and finally, spencer treat clark is amazing as david's doe-eyed son, the only one who initially believes in his father's abilities (shyamalan has as incredible knack for casting the right people, especially children, in his films).those who may be put off by the subject matter need not worry. view this film as a family study and it will be that much more rewarding.",5,Shyamalan's best film to

Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Sixth Sense). The main characters in this movie are David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). David is in a terrible train accident and he is the sole survivor without a single scratch on him. He then meets Elijah who thinks David is a hero. Specifically he thinks David's a comic book hero. Elijah tries to convince David and his family that he is a hero while David tries to remember his past. David remembers that he never was sick and he never had a broken bone which leads him to thinking he is a hero which then he becomes frustrated and doesn't really know what to think of at all.The ending was surprising but you could kind of see it coming. I thought the ending was going to be really great but it turned out just to be good.There are about an hour of special features on the second disc, which are great, but I was hoping there was more.Special Features:-Behind the Scenes with Bruce Willis (15 minutes)-Comic Book and Superheroes with Samuel L.

532598,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00003CXQA,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","Whilst 'The Sixth Sense' was a brilliantly made movie that revolutionised the ghost genre and took it into the new millenium, 'Unbreakable' is a much more ordinary piece.  It concerns an apparently ordinary man (Willis) who is not just the sole survivor of a train wreck but doesn't have a scratch on him.  Then along comes a vender of comic books (Jackson) with a disease which causes him to have incredibly weak bones who informs Willis that he is a modern day superhero.The movie is an odd mixture of brilliance and mediocrity with an intriguing yet still obvious story.  Once again Shyamalan draws exceptional performances from the cast, especially Willis who all of a sudden seems to have become a very good actor indeed.  Jackson is uniformly excellent, as is Pen Wright and although the kid is certainly no Haley Joel Osmont, he is definitely a cut above most child actors.  It succeeds on a number of levels as once again Shyamalan proves that he is the master of ghostly suspense, with the few shocks included here deriving mostly from clever camera work along with stunning photography.  What is also impressive is the fact that the movie transcends its limitations so that it never seems ridiculous or descends into camp.  Moreover, it is a decidedly adult movie that should be applauded on many levels.However, this cannot account for the fact that when the characters aren't stuck in apparently inescapable situations or there's nothing happening, it can get a little dull.  Whilst being dull is not necessarily a crime there is a lot of filler here that just wasn't needed.  Plus, the parts that needed to be expanded upon such as Willis's relationship with his wife, weren't so.  This half effort to inject some humanity into the film consequently falls flat on its face.  Yet it is the ending that will make most viewers scratch their heads.  It is not only a lame twist but it also seems that Shymalan thinks that a sudden twist is enough to end a movie.  Thus abrupt and frankly unsatisfactory ending more than anything else that fails 'Unbreakable'.  In addition, it's nothing compared to 'The Sixth Sense'.",3,Not as good as 'Sixth Sense',1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,2126,"['Whilst', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'movie', 'revolutionised', 'ghost', 'genre', 'took', 'new', 'millenium', ""'Unbreakable"", 'much', 'more', 'ordinary', 'piece', 'apparently', 'ordinary', 'man', 'Willis', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'sole', 'survivor', 'train', 'wreck', ""n't"", 'have', 'scratch', 'Then', 'along', 'vender', 'comic', 'books', 'Jackson', 'disease', 'have', 'incredibly', 'weak', 'bones', 'who', 'informs', 'Willis', 'modern', 'day', 'superhero.The', 'movie', 'odd', 'mixture', 'brilliance', 'mediocrity', 'intriguing', 'yet', 'still', 'obvious', 'story', 'Once', 'again', 'Shyamalan', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'Willis', 'who', 'sudden', 'have', 'become', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'indeed', 'Jackson', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Pen', 'Wright', 'kid', 'certainly', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmont', 'definitely', 'cut', 'most', 'child', 'actors', 'number', 'levels', 'once', 'again', 'Shyamalan', 'master', 'ghostly', 'suspense', 'few', 'shocks', 'included', 'here', 'deriving', 'mostly', 'clever', 'camera', 'work', 'stunning', 'photography', 'What', 'also', 'impressive', 'fact', 'movie', 'limitations', 'never', 'ridiculous', 'camp', 'Moreover', 'decidedly', 'adult', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'many', 'levels.However', 'can', 'not', 'account', 'fact', 'when', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'stuck', 'apparently', 'inescapable', 'situations', 'nothing', 'happening', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'dull', 'Whilst', 'being', 'dull', 'not', 'necessarily', 'crime', 'lot', 'filler', 'here', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'parts', 'needed', 'be', 'expanded', 'upon', 'such', 'Willis', 'relationship', 'wife', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'half', 'effort', 'inject', 'humanity', 'film', 'consequently', 'flat', 'face', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'most', 'viewers', 'scratch', 'heads', 'not', 'only', 'lame', 'twist', 'also', 'Shymalan', 'sudden', 'twist', 'enough', 'end', 'movie', 'Thus', 'abrupt', 'frankly', 'unsatisfactory', 'ending', 'more', 'anything', 'else', ""'Unbreakable"", 'addition', 'nothing', 'compared', ""'The"", 'Sixth', 'Sense']",Unbreakable

It revolves around two men, one of whom is a 'middle-American' security guard whose marriage is on the verge of falling apart. The other is a man suffering from Osteo-Genesis Imperfecta, a disease that severely weakens the bones and causes them to break easily and often.The second man, Elijah Price, has lived his life virtually out of comic books, and has come to believe that they are really exaggerated tales of ancient mythology which, in turn, are based on actual truth.The movie is about Elijah's search for the type of person that he believes comics depict - someone whose life has been completely untainted by illness or injury, and whose senses and abilities range considerably above the norm.He believes he has found his 'hero' in David Dunn, the sole  survivor of a train derailment. As he points out several times through the film (and this becomes a crucial point towards the end of the film), there had been 3 major disasters within a short period of time that had killed an enormous number of people, and only David had come away unscathed.David is naturally sceptical to begin with, something that is aided by distorted memories of a serious car accident that he was involved in earlier in his life.His son is less sceptical and, in his desperation to prove that his dad is something special, at one point turns a gun on him.Through a series of incidences, David comes to the astounding realisation that Elijah was right all along, and there are a number of small, seemingly insignificant points that help to emphasise this.For example, there are several references to the fact that David wakes up every morning with an inexplicable sadness. This is at first explained away as being regret at having sacrificed a star football career for marriage. It is not until after David puts his new-found talents to use by saving the lives of two children from a violent intruder that he comes to understand the sadness is, in fact, the result of not doing what he was born to do - help other people.In tradition with Shyamalan's previous film, The Sixth Sense, there is a twist at the end of this film. Although it doesn't have as much impact as Shyamalan's spooky ghost story, it is still a stunner, nevertheless. Though I don't believe it would affect a person's enjoyment of the movie, I won't give the surprise away here.I know this film did not get good reviews when it was released, but I recommend that people ignore the negative publicity and give it a chance. If you're capable of suspending disbelief, even to a small degree, then the premise of Unbreakable is not such a long stretch of the imagination.And, it's a surprisingly enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",4,Enticingly Odd,1065312000,"10 5, 2003",2003,2905,"['saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'weekend', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide', 'not', 'like', 'better', 'Sixth', 'Sense.It', 'unusual', 'premise', 'really', ""'reality-based"", 'superhero', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'whom', ""'middle-American"", 'security', 'guard', 'marriage', 'verge', 'falling', 'apart', 'other', 'man', 'suffering', 'Osteo-Genesis', 'Imperfecta', 'disease', 'severely', 'bones', 'break', 'easily', 'often.The', 'second', 'man', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'lived', 'life', 'virtually', 'comic', 'books', 'come', 'believe', 'are', 'really', 'exaggerated', 'tales', 'ancient', 'mythology', 'turn', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'truth.The', 'movie', 'Elijah', 'search', 'type', 'person', 'comics', 'depict', 'someone', 'life', 'been', 'completely', 'untainted', 'illness', 'injury', 'senses', 'abilities', 'range', 'considerably', 'norm.He', 'found', ""'hero"", 'David', 'Dunn', 'sole', 'survivor', 'train', 'derailment', 'out', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'crucial', 'point', 'end', 'film', 'had', 'been', '3', 'major', 'disasters', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'had', 'killed', 'enormous', 'number', 'people', 'only', 'David', 'had', 'come', 'away', 'unscathed.David', 'naturally', 'sceptical', 'begin', 'something', 'aided', 'distorted', 'memories', 'serious', 'car', 'accident', 'was', 'involved', 'earlier', 'life.His', 'son', 'less', 'sceptical', 'desperation', 'prove', 'dad', 'something', 'special', 'one', 'point', 'gun', 'series', 'incidences', 'David', 'astounding', 'realisation', 'Elijah', 'was', 'right', 'all', 'along', 'are', 'number', 'small', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'points', 'help', 'emphasise', 'this.For', 'example', 'are', 'several', 'references', 'fact', 'David', 'up', 'morning', 'inexplicable', 'sadness', 'first', 'explained', 'away', 'being', 'regret', 'having', 'sacrificed', 'star', 'football', 'career', 'marriage', 'not', 'David', 'new-found', 'talents', 'use', 'saving', 'lives', 'two', 'children', 'violent', 'intruder', 'understand', 'sadness', 'fact', 'result', 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'born', 'do', 'help', 'other', 'people.In', 'tradition', 'Shyamalan', 'previous', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'twist', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'impact', 'Shyamalan', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'story', 'still', 'stunner', 'nevertheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'affect', 'person', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'surprise', 'away', 'here.I', 'know', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'good', 'reviews', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'recommend', 'people', 'ignore', 'negative', 'publicity', 'give', 'chance', ""'re"", 'capable', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'even', 'small', 'degree', 'then', 'premise', 'Unbreakable', 'not', 'such', 'long', 'stretch', 'imagination.And', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours']",Unbreakable

They criticized it for being overly-somber, slow-paced, and melodramatic. When did we as people stop watching movies with our head and start developing eager-to-please impatient attitudes toward film in general? When I first saw it, I thought it was just plain watchable. The languid pace and hard-to-comprehend meaning behind it I merely wrote off as one of the film's weaknesses. The following month, I had a conversation with my cousin, who is also an avid movie buff, about this film. He told me that he felt it was a wholly original and innovative suspense film that satisfied from start to finish. Well, I bought the DVD the day it was released and, I must say, after viewing it a couple more times I have raised my opinion of it considerably.However, I agree and disagree with some of what the film's supporters say. I don't feel this is a wholly original and innovative film, but I do feel it is a more-than-solid effort and definitely a step in the right direction of greatness for writer-director M. Night Shylaman. He pieces the story together in layers, beginning with a flashback scene of a mother giving birth to a baby boy that turns out to have a rare protein deficiency disorder making him extremely susceptible to illness and brittle bones. Shylaman then moves to the present day and a quiet somber-looking man riding on a passenger train on a cold gray afternoon. This man is David, played excellently by Bruce Willis who gives the character the same subtle, soft-spoken sympathy that he gave to Dr. Malcolm Crowe in 'The Sixth Sense' but with an added element of intensity here. He is a man whose marriage is failing and whose relationship with his only son is slight, at best.The passenger train derails and ends up killing all of the 131 passengers on board. But there is a sole survivor. David miraculously comes out of the accident, not only alive, but without a scratch on him. From here, the journey of self-discovery begins for him. Though not willingly. It begins when he is approached by a man named Elijah, played with dark and cool intensity by the always-impressive Samuel L. Jackson. He is the grown man who we saw as a baby being born at the beginning. He tells David a hair-raising theory he has about why he survived the horrible accident unscathed.The reason I say this is not a wholly original film is very obvious (to me, anyways). This film has the style, imagery and feel of a Hitchcock film. It's story unfolds in layers and surprises you with plot twists that you would have never guessed, and its dark overtones are all elements extracted directly from the master of suspense. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. I view Shylaman as more a disciple of Hitchcock, rather than a rip-off artist (I thought it was particularly effective the way he chose not to show the actual train wreck - it's that blank spot in everyone's memory when they're involved in a car wreck and wake up in the hospital, unsure of what has happened). He has an innovative approach to storytelling and a mind that knows no boundaries when it comes to what the imagination will take seriously. Some of the film's detractors felt that its premise - that comic books are the primary conduit of modern mythology - was decidedly juvenile. They may be right. But that may also be what gives this film a perfect balance between artistic and fun. It is something you and your sweetheart can go enjoy at a drive-in theater with a bucket of popcorn in your lap, but it also offers up much more in its social relevance and commentary on how we view our mundane and empty lives, than a mere comic book story.

532606,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00003CXQA,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[6, 8]","When M. Night Shyamalan released Unbreakable, he had quite a bit of hype to live up to.  His previous film, The Sixth Sense, was a surprise super smash hit and was even nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award.  The story of Unbreakable revolves around David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a lone survivor of a train wreck who emerges completely unharmed.  He meets an eccentric comic book collector named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a bone disease which causes his bones to break very easily.  Elijah has a theory that the world of comic books is a near reflection of our very own world, and that he and David are on the opposite ends of the spectrum.  Willis and Jackson give superb performances, and Shyamalan's attention to detail-esque direction electrifies the pace of the film, but the meat and bones of Unbreakable is the way it is written; just as The Sixth Sense was more than a film about ghosts, Unbreakable is more than a film about super heroes.  This underlying theme, combined with the twist ending (although I can see how some viewers did not like it at all) make Unbreakable a superb film on it's own right.

532609,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00003CXQA,Newton Ooi,"[2, 3]","How does one classify this movie?  Some might call it a drama, as the slow pacing, muted emotions, lack of comedy, and modern, urban setting all fit the descriptions of many modern dramas.  Some might call it a fantasy; a reluctant superhero discovered by his arch-enemy who knows no bounds.  The former has strength beyond his knowledge, while the latter uses cunning to overcome his physical limitations.  Others might call it a suspense movie, as it has all the hallmarks of a classic suspense; good guys and bad guys are only sorted out at the end, and the audience discovers things as the protagonist does.  Maybe it is a combination of all three genres, another achievement from the M. Knight Shamalayan.However one might classify this movie, it is an incredible piece of story-telling.  Its as if Shamalayan wrote a traditional fairy tale, set it in a modern American city, and then reversed all the normal rules of fairy tales.  First of, the premise of superhero ignorant of his own destiny is a common starting point; think of Harry Potter, X-Men, and Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings.  But the heroes in these stories are all young, at the beginning of their lives.  Bruce Willis's character here, David, is old, past middle age most likely, and looking back on his glory years.  Second, heroes needs to be revealed unintentionally, through accident or fate.  David is discovered by both accident and fate.  Accident put him on a train, but fate assured him to survive.  Third, each hero needs a weakness.  Superman had kryptonite, Batman had his past and Spiderman has his loved ones.  But water, who would ever imagine water to be the one weakness of David?  Last, all heroes need an antagonist, that villian they must stop.  But here, it is the villian who seeks out the hero, helps him find his power, and finally, guarantees the hero's victory by sealing his own doom.Overall, this was a great movie.

However I've got to disagree- if anything I found this to be among his most powerful. You've just got to recognize the mythic underpinnings. It all hinges on the fact that when profound evil manifests, the universe creates equally powerful good to even the balance and put things right. The universe crystallizes out a hero. Nor may a hero ignore his reason for being: he cannot deny the call.But what if the hero finds himself in a mediocre age? What if a born hero is constantly taught that he is nothing special? What if society conspires to let his abilities go to waste? Indeed, what if his, or her, society denies the very possibility of the existence of a true hero? It would make no difference. Heroes come from a higher place for a higher purpose. They are the tools that the universe uses to put things right. They will find a way to awake to their true calling no matter what. The soul of a hero cannot be diluted by a weak and soulless society.Willis is perfect as the ordinary man that slowly comes to realize that he is far from ordinary. The way that he slowly realizes that the only limitations on him are those imposed by his own doubts is most believable. Jackson's performance is equally believable as the dark mirror to Willis.As for the special features, the mini-documentary on comic books and their meaning is quite good. I especially enjoyed actually seeing Frank Millar and Alex Ross talk about their motivations. And as most of the creators point out, the motivations behind the best comics are archetypical and mythological.

Night Shyamalan has done three mainstream films. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; which is a rehash of a twist that we have seen before. &quot;Signs&quot; which is a homage to B-Movie films and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. Unbreakable is Night's most original piece but actually has no meaning and there is nothing to take away from this one at all. However there is plenty you can BRING to it because of the nostalgia of Superhero movies of the past. Night does all of that here in a modern day reworking of these themes which is played out with a hint of realism. This sort of gives it more appeal and makes it less fantastic and thus closer to reality. I will not tell you the plot or anything about it because it will ruin it for you. When released the film was based on a &quot;man&quot; who is the &quot;soul-survivor&quot; of a &quot;trainwreck&quot;. There was no mention of Superheros when this film was released.Now that it is tagged with that in the product description I think it is safe to say that this is a movie about a Superhero coming to terms with his own powers in the modern world. It is a good flick and well worth watching if you like the nostalgia of this theme. The film does work. The final twist does say ... &quot;Unbreakable 2&quot; but it is more or less there just to play with us a little and broaded the scope of the superhero theme.

I view the movie as one would an art form. I am convinced that the better films have been (for many years) a new modern day  form of artwork.This film is a fantastic work of art with meaning deeply hidden under the guise of plot or story line. We all derive our own meanings from what we see and hear, from what we experience. Mine is as follows regarding this movie:I have a different twist on the meaning(s) of and within the film in general. The feeling I received after viewing this film was a deep sense of loss. Loss as in 'Do I know My Purpose?' Our villain brought something to light. Our villain did something our hero did not. Our villain helped someone discover their greatness. Do you suppose that our 'Darkness' or the forces thereof, is that which leads us to the light? I have a feeling that our director/writer was aware of this truth of life. The movie clearly depicts the sheer amount of trauma it takes for us to realize our purpose. Who is the hero in this film? The real hero? Who knew their purpose all along? Who was the redeemer? Who the resurrector? Our hero did not know what our villain knew. Where would our hero be without our villain - and by that I do not mean the crimes committed - but the loss of crimes prevented due to our hero's cluelessness.The movie begs us to ask the question, are we also - clueless? I think this is a great question to ask ourselves in regards to the meanings in life that we overlook. Questions like this are ultimate goals of all pure art of this nature. Film is teaching us many things. Like literature film can be a great educational tool.

Night Shyamalan's newest film, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, I had no idea what I was about to see.  And I was blown away.I will not even begin to explain the story, as I feel doing so completely ruins the effect of the movie.  Go see this without knowing its plot; you will enjoy it more and really understand the depth of this film.Everything screams of ATD...Attention to detail.  The actors are all top calibur, and all give top level performances.  The director is truly a visionary, and his flow and ideas are the bedrock of this film.  There are no special effects.  There is little &quot;action.&quot;  But the film, even with its slow pace, manages to hook the viewer into this unstable world that the cinematographer and director have brilliantly created through artistic and gentle style.  The music is some of the best.  Even when I first heard the opening title music, I knew there would be something special.  The music is simply gorgeous, and matches the film perfectly.  The script is excellent.  At no point do the lines sound corny or unrealistic.  Through the entire film, you will truly believe that this film is real.I must salute the entire production team for taking such a cliched, campy, and ridiculous premise, and turning it into a gritty, realistic and gripping piece of art.  The film is not &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot;  But in my humble opinion, it is honestly some far greater, and more masterful.  After all of the big-budget popcorn movie trash that has been floating around (Pearl Harbor, Tomb Raider, Swordfish,etc), it is truly refreshing to see CINEMA.  Not a movie, but a FILM.

I believe I bought the DVD a few years ago..mostly because I was buying any DVD that caught my interest. But with each time I see it...about half a dozen times...it just seems better and better. Unbreakable is now my favorite all time movie.If I had written a review when I saw it...I probably would have given it a 3.5 stars. Why? Because I knew it enjoyed it...but I didn't truly ""get it""...in fact...that underlies the greatness of this film...it is the type of movie that you absorb. It is subtle. Unbreakable doesn't hit you with a sledgehammer. In fact, it wasn't until I began to read the over reviewers...that I understood it is a ""super hero"" movie. I certainly didn't know it was the first of a possible trilogy (I wonder now some 9 yrs later if it will happen) Why? When I saw the movie...I just got caught up in the story of a man discovering who he is...and his purpose in life. I loved the reality of this movie. For example, I loved how ""David""...after trying to pick up the player agent...slips his wedding band back on his finger. EVERYMAN is right.I keep watching it to pick up more things I missed before. I long for more because there are so many questions. For instance, I wonder just how strong Bruce Willis's character ""David Dunn"" really is? And what would happen if he was shot? Due to the incredible ending...I wonder if David's superhero career ends before it even really gets started.If you give this movie a chance, you may also be blown away by how great it is.

532623,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00003CXQA,Poor Napoleon,"[2, 3]","There are few filmakers who have such a compelling style that the style is defined in their films: Among them, Kubrik, Spielberg, Lucas; and on a more recent scale, Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, and Kevin Smith.  What has made those directors so remarkable is their instantly recognizable style.  In the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan defined his style with an intriguing suspensful story filled with twists and clues that lead to an unexpected conclusion.  Shyamalan also makes films that don't adhere to the laws of the world; that is, in Sixth Sense, the plot revolves around the supernatural.Shyamalan clearly shows his unique styling in this followup to Sixth Sense, which is a superhero comic book story thinly disguised as a suspense thriller.  However, it is laced with Shyamalan's filmaking leads to a story of heroes and villans.  Bringing superheroes to the screen has always proved a mistake in the past.  It's glammed up to sell cartoons and toys, as Jackson's character says in the film.Shyamalan asserts that comic books are part of our society - part of our history.  Here, Shyamalan brilliantly develops a sort of theme.  There is a point in the film where Willis's character says &quot;I'm just an ordinary man.&quot;  Straying from the romantic ideas of costumes and overt superpowers like flying and such, Shyamalan tries to show that heroes come in all shapes and sizes and usually don't even know it.The undeniable brilliance in this film, however, lies in the filmaking.  Like Sixth Sense, this film is full of clues and symbols.  Shyamalan uses color and objects to lay the groundwork for the ultimate end to the movie.  Somethings are very overt, like bright colors representing key characters in the film.  Shyamalan is tipping his hat to the key inspiration to this film: comic books.The rest of the cast and crew puts this film together as well.  This film is hard to imagine without Bruce Willis in the main role, who delivers a similar humble approach to his unforgettable role in Sixth Sense.  Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant in his role as the mysterious character who introduces Willis to his gift.  The music also helps create a moody suspensful atmosphere required for such a film.This film is also fun.  Shyamalin is creating a film which prior to Sixth Sense, probably wouldn't have been made.  Superhero movies are jokes unless they have high profile actors, big names and special effects to sell (like X-Men for example).  Shyamalin is making the movies that a director should make: the stuff he/she loves and thinks is fun.  The idea of superheroes is ever compelling and rarely done well in cinema.  Shyamalin does it and does it well.",5,A new standard in filmaking,993600000,"06 27, 2001",2001,2684,"['are', 'few', 'filmakers', 'who', 'have', 'compelling', 'style', 'style', 'defined', 'films', 'Kubrik', 'Spielberg', 'Lucas', 'more', 'recent', 'scale', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'What', 'made', 'directors', 'so', 'remarkable', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'style', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'defined', 'style', 'intriguing', 'suspensful', 'story', 'filled', 'twists', 'clues', 'lead', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'Shyamalan', 'also', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'laws', 'world', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'plot', 'supernatural.Shyamalan', 'clearly', 'unique', 'styling', 'followup', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'However', 'laced', 'Shyamalan', 'filmaking', 'story', 'heroes', 'villans', 'Bringing', 'superheroes', 'screen', 'always', 'proved', 'mistake', 'past', 'glammed', 'up', 'sell', 'cartoons', 'toys', 'Jackson', 'character', 'film.Shyamalan', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'part', 'society', 'part', 'history', 'Here', 'Shyamalan', 'brilliantly', 'sort', 'theme', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'Willis', 'character', 'quot', ""'m"", 'just', 'ordinary', 'man.', 'quot', 'Straying', 'romantic', 'ideas', 'costumes', 'overt', 'superpowers', 'flying', 'such', 'Shyamalan', 'show', 'heroes', 'come', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'it.The', 'undeniable', 'brilliance', 'film', 'however', 'filmaking', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'film', 'full', 'clues', 'symbols', 'Shyamalan', 'color', 'objects', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'ultimate', 'end', 'movie', 'Somethings', 'are', 'very', 'overt', 'bright', 'colors', 'representing', 'key', 'characters', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'tipping', 'hat', 'key', 'inspiration', 'film', 'comic', 'books.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'film', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'main', 'role', 'who', 'similar', 'humble', 'approach', 'unforgettable', 'role', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'role', 'mysterious', 'character', 'who', 'Willis', 'gift', 'music', 'also', 'create', 'moody', 'suspensful', 'atmosphere', 'required', 'such', 'film.This', 'film', 'also', 'fun', 'Shyamalin', 'creating', 'film', 'prior', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'jokes', 'have', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'big', 'names', 'special', 'effects', 'sell', 'X-Men', 'example', 'Shyamalin', 'making', 'movies', 'director', 'should', 'make', 'stuff', 'he/she', 'loves', 'thinks', 'fun', 'idea', 'superheroes', 'ever', 'compelling', 'rarely', 'done', 'well', 'cinema', 'Shyamalin', 'well']",Unbreakable

532638,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B00003CXQA,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","I was really surprised by this movie. It takes two relativly simple characters in Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, brings them together and makes quite an impressice movie.While the individual story points, Jackson bones breaking, marriage issues, a person who doesn't remember their past blocking their true potential and what it means to be a hero, all appear simple they are woven together and create a powerful emotional message for those able to grasp it. Bicentinal Man and Powder are other movies that are strucutured simmerily, for those who have seen/heard those movies.Following Bruce Willis's progress was surprisingly a fun ride as we all go through a period where we try and realize who we are and it's almost always interesting to view a character trying to complete that journey. Jackson to has a journey but of a different nature.There is however one problem with the movie. Both of the main characters are given a weakness during the movie, yet neither fully develop a story with it. Jackson just simply reveals he has Bruce Willis's weakness but that's it and its never mentioned again for him.Willis is given a history with the same fault but, when the oppertunity is given for him to overcome it, he doesn't. (Slight spoiler, Instead he is helped by two people who got out of the house without detection by the bad man. Really? That ruins what could've been a good scene and it also doesn't make sense, as it appears the bad man let them go but stays where he was before.)That one scene is my only problem with the entire movie in hindsight.

532640,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CXQA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Unbreakable (M. Night Shyamalan, 2000)Okay, people, get over it: M. Night Shyamalan may never make another film as good as The Sixth Sense. Very few people, especially those trapped in the Hollywood machine, may ever make another film as good as The Sixth Sense. So comparing Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense is probably not the best of ideas.Not that that will stop me.Unbreakable is the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the only survivor of a nasty train wreck outside Philadelphia. After he leaves the hospital, he is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that Dunn may be the real-life equivalent of a comic-book hero, a guy who's basically put on earth to protect the weak, get kittens out of trees, etc., etc. Looking at Dunn and the life he leads, it's not exactly an easy concept to grasp; his wife (Robin Wright Penn) is estranged, though living in the same house; his kid (Spencer Treat Clark, last seen being Russell Crowe's kid in Gladiator) is obsessivelyattached to him and lives in daily fear of the parents finally separating; Dunn himself is a simple security guard at a fictional Philadelphia university (that looks suspiciously like UPenn). This guy is a comic book hero impervious to damage who's going to save the small fry from the evil mastermind?Comparisons to Shyamalan's last film aside, it turns into a well-done story. Willis and Jackson, reunited for the first time since Die Hard with a Vengeance, have the same chemistry that made that turkey into something vaguely watchable, and everyone involved plays their parts to the hilt. Shyamalan sets everything up just so, and then lets the ball roll, and it rolls well.Problem is, this film begs to be compared to The Sixth Sense. Not just because it's Shyamalan and Willis, but because everything about it says Shyamalan was trying way too hard to reprise his earlier film. The red motif is replaced by a water motif that doesn't go nearly as far, Spencer Treat Williams could be a stunt double for Haley Joel Osment, Shyamalan makes his cameo, etc. It just doesn't have the same obsessive attention to detail that made The Sixth Sense such a wonderful experience, and so it doesn't quite pull at the heartstrings as much. But it's still a worthwhile movie, for what it is, that was unfairly bashed by many critics unwilling to see past the Shyamalan mystique. *** 1/2",4,Much better than the critics gave it credit for.,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,2370,"['Unbreakable', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', '2000', 'Okay', 'people', 'get', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'may', 'never', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'especially', 'trapped', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'may', 'ever', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'So', 'comparing', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'ideas.Not', 'will', 'stop', 'me.Unbreakable', 'story', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'only', 'survivor', 'nasty', 'train', 'wreck', 'Philadelphia', 'hospital', 'approached', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'Dunn', 'may', 'be', 'real-life', 'equivalent', 'comic-book', 'hero', 'guy', 'who', 'basically', 'put', 'earth', 'protect', 'weak', 'get', 'trees', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Looking', 'Dunn', 'life', 'not', 'exactly', 'easy', 'concept', 'grasp', 'wife', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'estranged', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'kid', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'last', 'seen', 'being', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'kid', 'Gladiator', 'obsessivelyattached', 'lives', 'daily', 'fear', 'parents', 'finally', 'separating', 'Dunn', 'simple', 'security', 'guard', 'fictional', 'Philadelphia', 'university', 'suspiciously', 'UPenn', 'guy', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'impervious', 'damage', 'who', 'going', 'save', 'small', 'fry', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'Comparisons', 'Shyamalan', 'last', 'film', 'aside', 'well-done', 'story', 'Willis', 'Jackson', 'reunited', 'first', 'time', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Vengeance', 'have', 'same', 'chemistry', 'made', 'turkey', 'something', 'vaguely', 'watchable', 'everyone', 'involved', 'plays', 'parts', 'hilt', 'Shyamalan', 'everything', 'up', 'just', 'so', 'then', 'ball', 'roll', 'well.Problem', 'film', 'begs', 'be', 'compared', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Not', 'just', 'Shyamalan', 'Willis', 'everything', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'reprise', 'earlier', 'film', 'red', 'motif', 'replaced', 'water', 'motif', ""n't"", 'go', 'nearly', 'as', 'far', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'could', 'be', 'stunt', 'double', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Shyamalan', 'cameo', 'etc', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'obsessive', 'attention', 'detail', 'made', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'so', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'much', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'unfairly', 'bashed', 'many', 'critics', 'unwilling', 'see', 'Shyamalan', 'mystique', '1/2']",Unbreakable

532642,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00003CXQA,Robert Graves,"[13, 27]","Okay, it's not unwatchable. But the fact that this did not gross half of what the 6th Sense did should tell you that it is a seriously flawed film. So regardless of anyone's opinion or review, that fact alone is very significant in comparing this film to Night's previous work, which everyone (including Night) wants to do.This film is about a security Guard, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who after miraculously surviving a train wreck without a scratch is contacted by a comic book art collector named Elijah (Samuel Jackson). Elijah has a terrible bone disease which causes him to have breaks constantly. He is the weakest of men. He contacted David because he was intrigued by his survival. We find out very quickly - so much for suspense - that Elijah believes David could be a real life superhero, straight from the comic books. The rest of the film is about David coming to terms with this at Elijah's prompting and direction.To anyone who would call this a masterpiece of filmmaking, I would propose several serious flaws in this film, which exist on practically every level of its substance.1. *General* - Night tried to remake the 6th Sense. In practically every way, shape, and form this film tried to be like its predecessor, and that in itself is not only a flaw, but a little annoying. This is a small flaw, but the most rudimentary of all of them, so I included it first.2. *Premise* - I could just honestly not believe that a top filmmaker thought it would be a good idea to make a film about a real superhero. If we're talking about Mystery Men, then fine. But this was a serious film that was quoting comic books as though they were doctrinal. The main problem here, however, is more in the presentation of the concept (see below).3. *Presentation* - If you have the DVD of the 6th Sense, you've seen a documentary in which Night makes mention of the fact that in writing the story, he deliberately ignored the reason that Osmet could see dead people. That was not the point of the film and to try and explain it would have greatly lessened its impact. Well, he should have taken his own advice in Unbreakable. Had he not included comic books as our ultimate source of truth regarding David's powers, this would have been an immensely better film. Then we would have a movie about a man who begins to realize he has a strange strength about him. This is noticed by a mysterious man named Elijah, who is intrigued by David's strength, since he himself is debilitated. Then David applies his strength to helping people, we still have our surprise ending, etc. But there would not be the ridiculous concept of comic book heroes involved. The audience should have been left to realize the movie was about a superhero by themselves, rather than have it crammed down their throat beginning before the credits even roll (Night puts up a little fact sheet about comic book collecting in America at the film's opening). Then the viewers would have left the theater saying, ""Wow, that was about a superhero,"" rather than ""Wow...that was about a superhero."" When Elijah calls David to tell him that his memory was jogged while reading issue 117 of Super Slimeman (or something) and that the reason he (David) almost drowned is because like every great superhero he has a weakness, I was reminded of the cast of Galaxy Quest figuring out how they defeated the Pod People in episode 325. One big difference - Galaxy Quest is a comedy. Unbreakable is not.4. *Premise* - I know I already mentioned this, but wow. I still can't believe someone thought this was a good idea.5. *Direction* - The film was annoyingly artsy. Every scene had to be filmed in a mirror, or with a swinging door that blocks our view of someone, or upside down, or from above, etc., etc., etc. It was distracting and put a distance between the film and the viewer. Night needs to just take it down a notch or two and get back to the fundamentals or filmmaking.6. *Story Presentation* - The story was told in a boring, drab and predictable method. It was anticlimactic in several scenes, mostly because Night insisted upon ""artfully (see above)"" ending them in unnatural methods to try and shock the audience. It just didn't work. Also in the anti-climactic category, I found it bothersome that in David's very first episode as a superhero he finds himself smack-dab in the middle of a swimming pool, his only weakness. In his first adventure as a superhero. No foreshadowing, no drama, nothing. It just happens his first time out. And then we have the big surprise ending. Well, most people saw it coming a good five minutes before it happened. It was not masked nearly as well as the 6th Sense. More than that, it was so ridiculous that it was laughable rather than shocking. If the film took place in Gotham City, then maybe. But it took place in the real world. Lastly, what was this whole deal with him moving to New York and his wife and so forth...? That kind of got brushed aside.7. *Believability* - This is different than premise, though the premise definitely falls into this category. But even if you can buy the premise of the film (and that's asking a lot) there are other serious problems with the believability of it. For example, David is a security guard. This means that he would have to occasionally rough people up, right? Basically, he would be a man who is in touch with his masculine side. So even in the remote corners of fathomable credibility where this film exists, how did David not notice that he was just a tad stronger than the average Joe? I'm sorry, but somebody who could bench press nearly 400 pounds would just simply be aware that something was not normal. And apparently superheroes have chronically bad memories. Have you ever met someone who did not know whether they had been sick before? People who have never been sick know it - always - and they are normally proud of that fact. They don't have to ask everyone they know if they remember a time when they were sick.8. *Premise* - Did I mention premise?9. *Characters* - This is the last one, I promise. The characters in this film are all incredibly unlikable and stagnant. There is very little life to them and the audience has a difficult time caring about what happens to them as a result.So this is what happens when filmmakers hit it big, as Night did with the 6th sense. They are allowed to make anything they want, no questions asked, just a bunch of yes-men surrounding them. No quality-control, just go ahead and do it. Hopefully Night got whatever it is he needed to out of his system and can get back to making good films.",2,Unwatchable,994118400,"07 3, 2001",2001,6599,"['Okay', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'fact', 'did',

How do I know who I am, without knowing who I am not?This movie is almost like reading a book. It takes time to develop, and it's in firm control as it climaxes to an unforgettable scene of realizations and surprising discoveries. The long scenes set the pace of the movie, and instead of feeling they're long, I was drawn further to the movie, and I felt like I was a part of the story as an observer, instead of just as a viewer.When Elijah Price verifies the man in fatigues has the gun David described, I was skeptical. When David lifed heavier and heavier weights, I began to believe. When David's son points a gun to his dad, in firm belief he would survive, I was speechless. Not because of the fact a son pointing a gun to his own father is shocking, but it's the fact that I was still unsure of David's power, as he is of himself.Good directors control how much the viewers know. Most of the time, movies put viewers in a position where they know. Shyamalan is in control and only when he decides, the viewer is sure; I am sure who David Dunn and Elijah Price really are.In comparison to The Sixth Sense, I knew, the audience knew the boy's secret. It was a matter of figuring out, or waiting for the time he would tell of his secret. In that sense, I felt the commercials and trailers spoiled the fun.Unbreakable really spoke to me.

The interplay between the lead character and his son was well done and interesting (though it goes way over the top at one scene, afterwards they sort of ignore that and it's fun to watch again).Bruce Willis really does a fabulous job with his lead part -- unfortunately, the scripting on that part is not up to the creative ideas that drive this film.  There is a limit to how long I can watch someone trying hard not to participate in his life before I want to walk away.

I bring it home, pop it in the tray, and kick it on. Needless to say, I fell asleep. Fast. The next day I took it back to the video store, trying to pull a fast one and return it. That didn't pan out, so I tried to sell it to a buddy. That didn't go well either. So I'm stuck with a 20 dollar piece of plastic. Two weeks later, I'm sitting at home, it's raining outside, and I've watched every other DVD I've got 2 or 3 times, so I pull ""Unbreakable"" -- which by now has gathered a thin layer of dust -- off the shelf. I pop it in, and I stretch out on my couch, expecting to be asleep before the woman even sits down next to Bruce Willis on the train. But it's different this time. I'm mesmerized. You see, when I watched it the first time, I was watching it as the follow-up to ""The Sixth Sense."" As a Bruce Willis blockbuster. But that second time, I was watching it without all that hype, with no expectations... and it was spellbinding. It's so low-key that what might initially seem boring is just the proper tone for a somber character piece like this. It's not primarily a sci-fi thriller, or a mystery, or a comic-book movie. It's about a regular guy who's trying to find meaning in his life, all the while struggling to find balance with his family, and connect with his son. The whole superhero angle, while very interesting, only functions as his own unique struggle. Bruce Willis gives another great measured performance in the vein of ""The Sixth Sense."" In fact, everybody gives reserved turns here, even Samuel L. Jackson, who isn't exactly a paradigm of subtlety in his other movies. Not that that's a bad thing, but I don't think ""Ezekiel 25:17"" would mesh here. And the movie works even better when you think of it as the first in a trilogy, which Bruce Willis confirmed it is. My advice: watch it. But watch it without preconceptions or expectations. Ignore the hype. Give it a shot.

532649,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXQA,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","As both a writer and a director, M. Night Shyamalan is attempting to bring a whole new sensibility to American moviemaking.  Unlike most filmmakers who dabble in the ""horror film"" genre, Shyamalan eschews sensationalism and gore in favor of understatement, subtlety and indirection, preferring that we, in the audience, be given room to conjure up our own demons rather than having the filmmaker do it for us. The characters in his films drift like somnambulists through worlds drained of sound, color and emotion - and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.Shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense,"" a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings - the first time to be amazed and dazzled by the sheer ingeniousness of the multileveled plotting, the second to study retroactively just how intricately each plot element fell into place, catching us unawares the first time around.It is natural that Shyamalan should have tried to duplicate that success in his next film, using virtually the same stylistic elements and the same leading man, Bruce Willis, as he did in ""The Sixth Sense.""  Unfortunately, ""Unbreakable"" fails to live up to the quality of the earlier film. For one thing, ""The Sixth Sense"" really WENT someplace - it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.  ""Unbreakable,"" for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end - nay, worse, a conclusion that is absurd, undeveloped and thoroughly unsatisfying.Shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.  Here, however, he never finds it.  Willis plays a character almost too similar to the one he portrayed in ""The Sixth Sense"" - a brooding, taciturn man who seems to wander through life in a perpetual emotionless fog of detachment and depression.  David Dunn, a man caught in what appears to be a loveless, deteriorating marriage, is the sole survivor of a Philadelphia train wreck.  Already we are alerted to ""Sixth Sense"" parallels, so much so that we begin to subconsciously suspect that this might indeed be a sequel of sorts to the previous film.  Actually, it isn't, but rest assured there is something ""not quite right"" about this man, although the revelation of what it is has no where near the kick provided by the earlier work.  After his miraculous escape, David is contacted by Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, a man suffering from a strange genetic illness that causes his bones to shatter like glass and who becomes convinced that David may be his alter ego, i.e. a man immune from injury and disease.  This premise, based on a built-in dichotomy (just as ""The Sixth Sense"" was built on the dichotomy of life and death), also tries to explore the twin dichotomies of good vs. evil and hero vs. villain, but the context in which the filmmakers launch their exploration - the world of comic books of all things - robs the film of much of its potential profundity.  We just can't take Willis very seriously when he is wandering stoically around the city, clad in a hooded sweatshirt, like some sort of ""super hero"" on Prozac, saving innocent victims from the clutches of evildoers whose purposes he senses when he brushes up against them in crowds (the tag line for this film could well be ""I see criminals"").Thus, without a decent story to tell, the film turns out to be all style and no substance.  What was artistry in ""The Sixth Sense"" becomes artiness here.

532650,A387BD735MI50R,B00003CXQA,R. Schultz,"[2, 4]","Although Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" perhaps had more chills and more of a classic twist-ending - I personally think ""Unbreakable"" is his best film. I'm not sure if you would call it's ending a ""twist,"" but it made me gasp when it suddenly brought a whole landscape of emotion into focus with an amazing depth of field.Furthermore, this movie has one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on screen. Samuel L. Jackson plays a precise and learned art dealer with a special affinity for original classic comic book drawings. His genetic affliction limits the physical activity he can engage in, but his imagination has always been free to entertain strange possibilities. This truly is an original portrayal that could never typecast Jackson. His role is not as romantic lead, not as supporting character actor, not as doctor, lawyer, merchant... It's what he is that in the end creates the shock of brilliant resolution.This is a movie whose intricacies will haunt you long after the fact. And even if you never had any interest in comic books, you will probably walk away from `Unbreakable"" with a new respect for what Joseph Campbell might call their ""power of myth.""One word about the availability of this film - I see a lot of the single-disc versions of it are available only in ""Region 2"" DVD format. You would need a ""Multi-Region"" or ""Universal"" DVD player to play these versions. As I understand it, all DVD players are manufactured with the capability of playing all DVDs. However, the players are then set by distributors to play in only one region, most often the US/Canada Region 1 - in order to block overseas bootlegging versions and other illicit overseas offerings.There are on-line sites presumably listing decoding sequences that will allow you to ""unlock"" your specific DVD player so it will play all regions. However most people I've talked with have found these decoding sequences don't work. This can be frustrating because it seems an increasing number of English or foreign movies and comedy series are being offered only in non-Region 1 formats lately.So if you want to buy one of the single-disc Region 2 versions of ""Unbreakable"" listed on this website, you might need to consider buying a ""Multi-Region"" DVD player on-line, or else you might want to go to an ethnic neighborhood (such as an East Indian community) in a large city to find a Multi-Region player.",5,Unbeatable!,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,2398,"['Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'perhaps', 'had', 'more', 'chills', 'more', 'classic', 'twist-ending', 'personally', 'think', 'Unbreakable', 'best', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'call', 'ending', 'twist', 'made', 'gasp', 'when', 'suddenly', 'brought', 'whole', 'landscape', 'emotion', 'focus', 'amazing', 'depth', 'field.Furthermore', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'precise', 'learned', 'art', 'dealer', 'special', 'affinity', 'original', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'drawings', 'genetic', 'affliction', 'physical', 'activity', 'can', 'engage', 'imagination', 'always', 'been', 'free', 'entertain', 'strange', 'possibilities', 'truly', 'original', 'portrayal', 'could', 'never', 'typecast', 'Jackson', 'role', 'not', 'romantic', 'lead', 'not', 'supporting', 'character', 'actor', 'not', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'merchant', 'what', 'end', 'shock', 'brilliant', 'resolution.This', 'movie', 'intricacies', 'will', 'haunt', 'long', 'fact', 'even', 'never', 'had', 'interest', 'comic', 'books', 'will', 'probably', 'walk', 'away', 'Unbreakable', 'new', 'respect', 'what', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'might', 'call', 'power', 'myth', 'One', 'word', 'availability', 'film', 'see', 'lot', 'single-disc', 'versions', 'are', 'available', 'only', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'format', 'would', 'need', 'Multi-Region', 'Universal', 'DVD', 'player', 'play', 'versions', 'understand', 'DVD', 'players', 'are', 'manufactured', 'capability', 'playing', 'DVDs', 'However', 'players', 'are', 'then', 'set', 'distributors', 'play', 'only', 'one', 'region', 'most', 'often', 'US/Canada', 'Region', '1', 'order', 'block', 'overseas', 'bootlegging', 'versions', 'other', 'illicit', 'overseas', 'are', 'on-line', 'sites', 'presumably', 'listing', 'decoding', 'sequences', 'will', 'allow', 'unlock', 'specific', 'DVD', 'player', 'will', 'play', 'regions', 'However', 'most', 'people', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'have', 'found', 'decoding', 'sequences', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'increasing', 'number', 'English', 'foreign', 'movies', 'comedy', 'series', 'are', 'being', 'offered', 'only', 'non-Region', '1', 'formats', 'lately.So', 'want', 'buy', 'one', 'single-disc', 'Region', '2', 'versions', 'Unbreakable', 'listed', 'website', 'might', 'need', 'consider', 'buying', 'Multi-Region', 'DVD', 'player', 'on-line', 'else', 'might', 'want', 'go', 'ethnic', 'neighborhood', 'such', 'East', 'Indian', 'community', 'large', 'city', 'find', 'Multi-Region', 'player']",Unbreakable

This is a little understandable, since both have the same lead and director. However, I have never heard anyone comparing American Graffiti, Star Wars: A New Hope, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, all of which were produced by Geroge Lucas and starred Harrison Ford. There's a reason for this: these films are DIFFERENT, and so are Unbreakable and Sixth Sense.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can say that I really did like Unbreakable. I have always been confused at why the director still gets the most credit when today's movies are good mostly because of the screenwriters and the actors. Now M. Night Shamaylon (is that spelled right?) has brought a welcome return to the kind of unique, avante-garde directing that Hitchcock and Kubrick used to do.

After a devastating train accident somehow leaves him miraculously untouched, he is contacted by a mysterious man who  tells him he may not be ordinary at all, but so extraordinary that he can no longer lead an ordinary life. The truth is even stranger, and more frightening, than it seems at first.Review (with spoilers): It is a rare thing to come across anything NEW in either the thriller OR superhero genres. This combination of both manages to do so for both. We start with a young boy, Elijah Price who is born with a terrible medical curse: his bones are so brittle that they can break under any significant strain. To motivate him to at least try to make as much use of his body as he can, his mother buys him comic books which he likes and places them on the playground across the street; Elijah accepts the challenge, and the comic-book world within...... Years later, a devastating train accident occurs, leaving security worker David Dunn (Bruce Willis) untouched though nearly everyone else is killed. Elijah, who now runs a collectibles store focused around comic memorabilia, contacts David. It seems that Elijah, because of his incredible fragility (for which the neighborhood children have nicknamed him ""Mr. Glass""), formed a theory that the bell-curve distribution of human traits demanded that there be someone on the ""opposite end"" from him: someone virtually unbreakable, superhuman. Elijah (played as an adult by Samuel L. Jackson) is clearly somewhat nuts, yet there is a wierd and compelling power about him, and about the faith he has that there is a higher power motivating these events.David does not accept this theory at once, but eventually other odd coincidences force him to at least test this nutcase's ideas... and the test results are everything that Elijah expects, stunning even David and his son.In the end, David accepts that there is, in fact, some part of him driven to seek out and oppose true evildoers -- those who kill with pleasure and so on -- and in a dramatic sequence fights his first battle as a vigilante. Ironically, even though he does NOT go looking for some funny costume and tights, the outfit he wears works *AS* a superhero costume, even supplying him with an appropriate superheroic name: ""Security"".BIG SPOILER WARNING, DO NOT READ ANY FARTHER IF YOU WANT ANY CHANCE TO WATCH THE REMAINDER OF THE FILM UNKNOWINGSomeExtraSpaceBut the true shocker comes at the end, when we discover that, in order to FIND his superhero, Elijah has been CAUSING multiple disasters, winnowing through countless scenes of destruction to find the one unbreakable man or woman. The man we thought was playing ""Professor X"" to David's X-man life is, in fact, more akin to the Joker looking for his Batman. ""Mr. Glass"" could not be a superhero, so obviously he would have to be the villain -- and FIND a hero to oppose him.Will David ever play Hero again? Despite this shock, we don't know. I would guess... yes. The ironic fact is that Mr. Glass *WAS* telling the truth. There IS a special power in David, one specifically there for finding those of true evil intent, and he truly does have a strong drive to act on it. But what a dark and sinister origin to have....",5,Interesting. Riveting.

David remains doubtful of his special powers and looks at it simply in tune conscious. David is unable to be injured and starts to discover this after a freak train crash in which 131 people are killed, and David is left the soul survivor. Retracing his steps through the past, David discovers his in depth perception of the people around him and being Unbreakable.Villians always are stereotyped into always wanting to take over the world.

532669,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00003CXQA,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[1, 1]","J. Night Shyamalan has made yet another cerebral thriller and this time its super heroes. You get all the same kind of engrossing mystery as in Sixth Sense, but this time with a little dose of comic book ""what if?"" is thrown in the mix. What comes out is a seriously cool adaptation to a theme that just about every one of us has imagined at least one time in our lives. What would it be like to have super powers?Just like his other thrillers. The beauty of the movie is slowly learning what the heck is going on. You go through this ordinary security guard's tribulation of finding out if he really is nigh invulnerable. The story is done really well in this aspect. You get really swept away in this trek to find the truth. Many of the scenes use color, sound and other cinematography techniques to bring out an even greater artistic enhancement of storytelling. These techniques almost make you feel like you are seeing techniques used in comic books to enhance the story in a subtle and realistic way. Very, very nice!The acting is superb. Bruce Willis has never disappointed me yet. When he is needed to show strength you see the inner strength. When he needed to be a vulnerable character you can see it in his eyes and the way he carries himself. Masterful work. Samuel L. Jackson plays his role as Elijah Price so well that you almost think Jackson himself is the infinitely frail. He also has a great presence and complexity that further makes him perfect for the role.Like most of Shyamalan's other movies this one isn't action based, in spite of what the story is about. Unbreakable is, however, an excellent coming-of-super-age type story with one doozy of a surprise ending... an early Shyamalan trademark. If you absolutely, positively need lots of action in your films then you might as well pass this one. However you will miss out. Anybody who likes to see more depth in his or her heroes you won't see anything better on any superhero movie hands down. Don't deprive your mind of this brain food. It's a winner.I don't really see a very compelling reason to get this Blu-Ray if you already own the two-disc Vista series DVD. The visuals don't seem like they have improved that much, but then again I didn't compare the two versions side by side. I won't say the picture isn't significantly better, but I will say it's not the kind of visual pop you would find on movies people use as high def references. Now the audio on the Blu-Ray is PCM 5.1 lossless and it's really nice. You get to hear a lot of subtle audio queues that may or may not be noticeable on the previous releases (again I didn't compare the two side by side).The special features are a 100% rehash of the Vista series extras with absolutely nothing new to the table. This kinda dissapoints me, but in the end most of the time when they make a Blu-Ray exlusive featurette it sometimes tends to be throwaway content. Here's what you get:Behind the Scenes - A documentary of interviews from the cast and crew. Not bad, but not groundbreaking.Comic Books and Superheroes - A cool analysis of comic book heroes and villans. Shows that Samuel Jackson does have a love for the genre.Deleted Scenes - There are some really cool scenes that were taken out and now you get to enjoy them. Some, of course, are obvious why they were taken out. My favorite is the weighlifting scene at the college gym.The Train Station Sequence - Uses the multiple angles feature to switch between the movie and the storyboards. Not really interesting unless you plan to direct.Night's First Fight Sequence - One a Shyamalan's home movies depicting the title sequence. Just shows the budding directory building his chops as a teen with a camcorder. Interesting bit of historic trivia, but nothing to write home about.I didn't feel the Blu-Ray really stood out on the visual end, but it did look really good. I would have liked to have seen some more content on this release like maybe a director commentary, maybe an analytical retrospective. Something new. If you already have the Vista series DVD I can't say with 100% certainty this is the one to get. I keep wondering if a new and improved Blu-Ray release will come down the pike with more features or maybe a director's cut adding some of those deleted scenes into a longer movie. If you don't have the Vista series DVD then your choice is easier as you get all the special features plus the improved visuals (likely) and audio (definitely).",4,"Blu-Ray good, but not amazing",1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,4453,"['J', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'made', 'yet', 'cerebral', 'thriller', 'time', 'super', 'heroes', 'get', 'same', 'kind', 'engrossing', 'mystery', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'time', 'little', 'dose', 'comic', 'book', 'what', 'thrown', 'mix', 'What', 'out', 'seriously', 'cool', 'adaptation', 'theme', 'just', 'one', 'imagined', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'lives', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'Just', 'other', 'thrillers', 'beauty', 'movie', 'slowly', 'learning', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'go', 'ordinary', 'security', 'guard', 'tribulation', 'finding', 'out', 'really', 'nigh', 'invulnerable', 'story', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'aspect', 'get', 'really', 'swept', 'away', 'trek', 'find', 'truth', 'Many', 'scenes', 'use', 'color', 'sound', 'other', 'cinematography', 'techniques', 'bring', 'out', 'even', 'greater', 'artistic', 'enhancement', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'almost', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'seeing', 'techniques', 'used', 'comic', 'books', 'enhance', 'story', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'way', 'Very', 'very', 'nice', 'acting', 'superb', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'never', 'disappointed', 'yet', 'When', 'needed', 'show', 'strength', 'see', 'inner', 'strength', 'When', 'needed', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'way', 'Masterful', 'work', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'role', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'so', 'well', 'almost', 'think', 'Jackson', 'infinitely', 'frail', 'also', 'great', 'presence', 'complexity', 'further', 'perfect', 'role.Like', 'most', 'Shyamalan', 'other', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'action', 'based', 'spite', 'what', 'story', 'about', 'Unbreakable', 'however', 'excellent', 'coming-of-super-age', 'type', 'story', 'one', 'doozy', 'surprise', 'ending', 'early', 'Shyamalan', 'trademark', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'need', 'lots', 'action', 'films', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'However', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'Anybody', 'who', 'see', 'more', 'depth', 'heroes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'better', 'superhero', 'movie', 'down', 'Do', ""n't"", 'deprive', 'mind', 'brain', 'food', 'winner.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'very', 'compelling', 'reason', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'already', 'own', 'two-disc', 'Vista', 'series', 'DVD', 'visuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'improved', 'much', 'then', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'versions', 'side', 'side', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'picture', ""n't"", 'significantly', 'better', 'will', 'say', 'not', 'kind', 'visual', 'pop', 'would', 'find', 'movies', 'people', 'use', 'high', 'def', 'references', 'Now', 'audio', 'Blu-Ray', 'PCM', '5.1', 'lossless', 'really', 'nice', 'get', 'hear', 'lot', 'subtle', 'audio', 'queues', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'noticeable', 'previous', 'releases', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'side', 'side', 'special', 'features', 'are', '100', '%', 'rehash', 'Vista', 'series', 'extras', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'kinda', 'end', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'make', 'Blu-Ray', 'exlusive', 'featurette', 'be', 'throwaway', 'content', 'Here', 'what', 'get', 'Scenes', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'groundbreaking.Comic', 'Books', 'Superheroes', 'cool', 'analysis', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'villans', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'have', 'love', 'genre.Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'scenes', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'now', 'get', 'enjoy', 'course', 'are', 'obvious', 'why', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'favorite', 'weighlifting', 'scene', 'college', 'gym.The', 'Train', 'Station', 'Sequence', 'multiple', 'angles', 'feature', 'switch', 'movie', 'storyboards', 'Not', 'really', 'interesting', 'plan', 'direct.Night', 'First', 'Fight', 'Sequence', 'One', 'Shyamalan', 'home', 'movies', 'depicting', 'title', 'sequence', 'Just', 'budding', 'directory', 'building', 'chops', 'teen', 'camcorder', 'Interesting', 'bit', 'historic', 'trivia', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'about.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Blu-Ray', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'visual', 'end', 'did', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'content', 'release', 'maybe', 'director', 'commentary', 'maybe', 'analytical', 'retrospective', 'Something', 'new', 'already', 'have', 'Vista', 'series', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', '100', '%', 'certainty', 'one', 'get', 'keep', 'wondering', 'new', 'improved', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'will', 'come', 'down', 'pike', 'more', 'features', 'maybe', 'director', 'cut', 'adding', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'longer', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Vista', 'series', 'DVD', 'then', 'choice', 'easier', 'get', 'special', 'features', 'improved', 'visuals', 'likely', 'audio', 'definitely']",Unbreakable
532670,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00003CXQA,S. Schell,"[3, 6]","A literal hit and miss, ""Unbreakable"" is M. Night Shyamalan's cinematic blunder, a jigsaw puzzle with integral pieces missing from its obscure image.  As can be expected, it suffers greatly at the hands of comparison to Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense"".  ""Unbreakable"" is filmed with the same swart and creepy ambience as its predecessor but hopelessly flounders from an indistinct plot and underdeveloped characters.  Where as SS genuinely bolstered interest in the supernatural and managed to include a finale with some reasonable closure, this film is severely lacking of both.  It struggles to clarify its chaotic concept and miserably fails.From the get-go, ""Unbreakable"" is a jumbled mess.  It remains so in the fact that it bears no plausible connections to the numerous theories it proposes in its laboriously paced two-hour time frame.  It strays far from its preliminary premise and sloppily interjects a scatterbrained theory from a comic book fanatic named Elijah Price, a man who has spent nearly his entire existence in the distilled milieu of hospitals.  Elijah suffers from a rare genetic disorder, one that severely depletes his bone density - his limbs will literally shatter like glass from a misstep of any kind.  In the search for his counterpart, the long-awaited news comes to him in the form of a tragic accident.  Two railway trains collide and all save one perishes - the sole survivor is David Dunn (Willis), an assumed everyday man who is currently enduring a crumbling marriage with his wife of twelve years (Penn).  He emerges from the horrific catastrophe unscathed, leaving his doctor and his family to ponder the miraculous outcome.  Elijah is intrigued and contacts David, bringing to light his inconceivable immunity to bodily harm and insisting that there is an underlying reason for his divine existence.After this assumedly concrete plot is introduced, we are led to believe by not only the trailer but also the first half-hour itself that David's incredible circumstance is an existing phenomenon that begs to be defined.  Instead, we are left in the impenetrable shadows of the movie's ethereal cinematography as the characters themselves scramble to make sense of what is going on.  Because of Shyamalan's conflicting talents as a writer and a director, the plot bends left and right with indecisiveness.  In this inconsistency, Shyamalan throws his audience to and fro and we are left with yet another surprise ending that, unlike SS, lends no ample plausibility or clarification to the rest of the film.Bruce Willis applies his near-a-whisper acting technique acquired from SS to the role of David Dunn, the man who is the moniker of this very movie.  There is never any dramatic tension from this limp character until a specific point in the movie when a gun is pointed at him from the most unlikely of people.  Robin Wright-Penn is wasted in this film as Dunn's eternally exhausted wife Audrey.  Penn always appears as if she has just taken a heavy dose of Secenol, her sluggish approach to her character almost unbearable to witness.  Samuel L. Jackson seems to be the only fire to these watery performances, but even his vehement candor is kept at a bare minimum by Shyamalan's lethargic style.  When examining the performances this film begets, I warn you: be prepared for pure somnolence.There is not much more to comment on this film except that it is a far cry from what we know Shyamalan is truly capable of, and avid fans of SS will be extremely disappointed by the lack of artistry and attention to detail.  ""Unbreakable"" is doomed from its very induction and will be broken down to the every flaw by many critics to come.",2,Unfeasible,986947200,"04 11, 2001",2001,3701,"['literal', 'hit', 'miss', 'Unbreakable', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'cinematic', 'blunder', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'integral', 'pieces', 'missing', 'obscure', 'image', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'greatly', 'hands', 'comparison', 'Shyamalan', 'Oscar-nominated', 'masterpiece', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'filmed', 'same', 'swart', 'creepy', 'ambience', 'predecessor', 'hopelessly', 'flounders', 'indistinct', 'plot', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'Where', 'SS', 'genuinely', 'bolstered', 'interest', 'supernatural', 'managed', 'include', 'finale', 'reasonable', 'closure', 'film', 'severely', 'lacking', 'clarify', 'chaotic', 'concept', 'miserably', 'fails.From', 'get-go', 'Unbreakable', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'so', 'fact', 'plausible', 'connections', 'numerous', 'theories', 'laboriously', 'paced', 'two-hour', 'time', 'frame', 'far', 'preliminary', 'premise', 'sloppily', 'scatterbrained', 'theory', 'comic', 'book', 'fanatic', 'named', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'nearly', 'entire', 'existence', 'distilled', 'milieu', 'hospitals', 'Elijah', 'suffers', 'rare', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'one', 'severely', 'bone', 'density', 'limbs', 'will', 'literally', 'shatter', 'glass', 'misstep', 'kind', 'search', 'counterpart', 'long-awaited', 'news', 'form', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Two', 'railway', 'trains', 'collide', 'save', 'one', 'sole', 'survivor', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Willis', 'assumed', 'everyday', 'man', 'who', 'currently', 'enduring', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'wife', 'twelve', 'years', 'Penn', 'horrific', 'catastrophe', 'unscathed', 'leaving', 'doctor', 'family', 'ponder', 'miraculous', 'outcome', 'Elijah', 'intrigued', 'contacts', 'David', 'bringing', 'light', 'inconceivable', 'immunity', 'bodily', 'harm', 'insisting', 'underlying', 'reason', 'divine', 'existence.After', 'assumedly', 'concrete', 'plot', 'introduced', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'not', 'only', 'trailer', 'also', 'first', 'half-hour', 'David', 'incredible', 'circumstance', 'existing', 'phenomenon', 'be', 'defined', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'impenetrable', 'shadows', 'movie', 'ethereal', 'cinematography', 'characters', 'scramble', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'going', 'Shyamalan', 'conflicting', 'talents', 'writer', 'director', 'plot', 'left', 'right', 'indecisiveness', 'inconsistency', 'Shyamalan', 'audience', 'fro', 'are', 'left', 'yet', 'surprise', 'ending', 'SS', 'ample', 'plausibility', 'clarification', 'rest', 'film.Bruce', 'Willis', 'near-a-whisper', 'acting', 'technique', 'acquired', 'SS', 'role', 'David', 'Dunn', 'man', 'who', 'moniker', 'very', 'movie', 'never', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'limp', 'character', 'specific', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'gun', 'pointed', 'most', 'unlikely', 'people', 'Robin', 'Wright-Penn', 'wasted', 'film', 'Dunn', 'eternally', 'exhausted', 'wife', 'Audrey', 'Penn', 'always', 'just', 'taken', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Secenol', 'sluggish', 'approach', 'character', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'witness', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'be', 'only', 'fire', 'watery', 'performances', 'even', 'vehement', 'candor', 'kept', 'bare', 'minimum', 'Shyamalan', 'lethargic', 'style', 'When', 'examining', 'performances', 'film', 'begets', 'warn', 'be', 'prepared', 'pure', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'comment', 'film', 'far', 'cry', 'what', 'know', 'Shyamalan', 'truly', 'capable', 'avid', 'fans', 'SS', 'will', 'be', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'artistry', 'attention', 'detail', 'Unbreakable', 'doomed', 'very', 'induction', 'will', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'flaw', 'many', 'critics', 'come']",Unbreakable

I dismissed this guy as a total schmuck who found fame in making a movie that [take] the entire plot to ""Carnival Of Souls""(and ""Jacob's Ladder"" in a way).  I don't want to get off on my essay on all the reasons why ""The Sixth Sense"" was rotten, but I want you all to understand that I HATED Shyamalan about as much as I hate Don Henley(and that's alot).  Well, after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", he could have gone on to do just about any movie he wanted.  Instead of making some multi-million dollar CGI filled, action packed ""scary"" film, he hits us with this bizarre little thriller that almost ventures into David Lynch territory.  I'm not saying that I now like Syamalan based soley on that principal..... I really did like this movie.  Sure, it's slow moving(but the best movies usually are), there aren't jump-out-of-your-seat moments every five minutes, and (this is debatable) there isn't anything really supernatural about it.  I guess I can see why people were let down by this.  I'm sure everyone was expecting this to be another ""Sixth Sense"" or even to top it.  Everyone seems to love that film more (God only knows why), but ""Unbreakable"", in my opinion, was a pretty clever piece of work.

Right from the beginning you are introduced to a mediocre character played by Bruce Willis who in my opinion plays one of the most bland and boring characters ever to require even a second of attention. You then learn he has discovered something superhuman about himself, he's survived a train crash with him being the sole survivor! Now, in real life, wouldn't that constitute a major investigation? I mean, c'mon, this movie just plays to morons! The rest of the film takes you through a series of melancholy self-discoveries of two characters that somehow balance each other based on their abilities to defy all odds of probability. One being superhuman in physicality (Bruce Willis) and one being superhuman in mastermindness (Sam Jackson). Both are equally powerful but this movie simply lacks EXCITEMENT! By the time you realize what is REALLY going, the story loses you. The ending graces you with a lame after-thought, showing commentary of both characters' success and demise.

532674,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00003CXQA,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","I'm going to risk coming off like I'm slightly off my rocker to people who are slightly less...eccentric...than I am and say what I really think of ""Unbreakable"": this movie is the first small portion of what Should happen in the real world.A train wreck kills every one of its passengers onboard (okay, that isn't the part that should happen in real life, obviously) except one survivor (played by Bruce Willis in his best role ever) who doesn't have a scratch on him.  This attracts the attention of a comic book historian, of all things, who has a most unusual theory on why this one man was able to escape even the slightest injury.  This historian, briliantly played by Samuel L. Jackson, has reasoned out a theory that seems very reasonable, and very very familiar to me personally.  In this current world, we have crime, war, poverty, neverending famine, disease, and every other malady that preys on the world.  Driven by tremendous hardship in the course of his own life, Jackson's character has wondered: could not nature somehow produce a counterbalance to everything that always goes wrong?""Unbreakable"" is filmed in a grim, dark, rather bleak style meant to highlight - in its early portions - the negative aspects of the world rather than the positive ones.  A broken world, for the most part.  And Jackson is looking for something to break the gridlock from a highly unusual source.Great performances by the whole cast, tremendous suspense, thought-provoking and dream-provoking, groundbeakingly innovative, ""Unbreakable"" is Willis's best, and possibly M. Night Shymalan's best as well.  Possibly Jackson's best along with ""Star Wars"", although he didn't play as large a role in those movies (and to be honest, there's still a couple of excellent-looking Samuel Jackson movies out there I haven't seen yet).  This could have spawned not only a sequel or two, but an entire line of movies now that the first crack is in the floodgate.  They wouldn't even have to all have the same characters; the potential for expansion on this concept into a whole movie universe is astonishing.If you're intrigued by the comic book references and parralells and would like to give one or both of the 'big' ongoing comic universes a try but don't know where to start, I have a few suggestions.

It was Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel nearly getting into a fist fight over the film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.Both thought the film was brilliant and lauded it with praise.  Siskel however thought that he should use a different scale to determine if he should give it a thumbs up or down.  The Kubrik scale.  Rather than base his rating on the merits of the film in and of itself, he decided to compare it to the director's other work.  Held up to &quot;Spartacus&quot; or &quot;2001&quot; the film didn't rate a thumbs up.  I believe a lot of the ratings here on Amazon are falling prey to this mentality.Unbreakable is a wonderful ride.  As a begining to a possible trilogy of films it is a magnificent introduction to the principal characters and gives great insight to their lives and beliefs.  As a stand alone film it tells it's story, makes it's point and builds to an ending that at least I didn't see coming.  It's not a huge revelation on par with &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, but this is a different film, isn't it?The pacing is slow, true.  But this is intentional on the part of the director.  Unbreakable is about the possibility of superheroes existing in the real world.  Here in the real world people don't wear purple spandex suits and probably wouldn't have millions of dollars at their disposal to buy jets and pnuematicly firing grappling hooks that fold into a packet on their belt.  Most people here in the real world take what they do have and make the best of it and try to do good.Shyamalan uses color well as a symbol here as is becoming his trademark.  He also seems to enjoy filling most of his frames with lots of background action, choosing to shoot a lot at train stations and sporting events.  This lends a lot of power to a simple two shot when he uses one.  Especially when Willis and Jackson share the screen.I guess it boils down to this.  If you watch this film with no previous knowledge of Shyamalan's previous work you will undoubtedly enjoy the film, especially if you are a comic geek who goes in for Frank Miller.  On the other hand, if you are expecting Sixth sense part two don't bother.

532682,A1P5HSM15HWNWV,B00003CXQA,"Steve ""xtcr7""","[1, 2]","M. Night Shyamalan's followup to his blockbuster debut The Sixth Sense is regarded by many as a tepid piece at best.  While the idea was found to be creepy enough, the speed of the plot was taken to task and cited as the primary spoiler of the experience.  Although there is merit to the criticism, Unbreakable should be seen for what it is: a superlative exercise in concept and suspense.Bruce Willis portrays David Dunn, an aptly named man whose given/surname appropriately reflect the prosaic ordinariness of his staid life; he's just a security guard, no exciting skeletons in his closet whatsoever (it seems).  His life takes a more kinetic turn when he is on a train that derails and gains a bit of fame for being the sole survivor of the wreckage.  This fact is noticed by the more exotically christened Elijah Price (brought to life by Samuel L. Jackson), a tragic figure who suffers from a congenital condition which renders his skeletal system as brittle as thin crystal.  Price is obsessed with comic books and their omnipotent characters because they represent the antithesis of his horrible physical limitations (which were conveyed effectively in a cruel scene where he tumbles down a flight of hard steps, his bones shattering like dropped china).  He has another obsession as well: he wants to locate a real superhero, for he believes at least one demigod walks among the human race.  He becomes convinced that Dunn is the one, and he wants this Clark Kent to find his inner Son-Of-Jor-El; Dunn naturally wants to ground such a flight of fancy, and he has a problem when his son- who also believes he's a derivative of DC magic- wants to test the hypothesis by shooting him (another powerful moment).  So...who's right?  Price; Dunn?  The conclusion is sinister in its revelations.One thing which must be understood about Unbreakable is that it is essentially a film-school project blown up to multiplex-ready proportions.  The dark, somber tone is never ameliorated; the narrative maintains a consistent depressive feel at home in a budding Spielberg's thesis.  This is most likely what initiated the tentative reception; but the approach actually works, because the crucial elements of the story are allowed to become the focal point for the viewer, as opposed to becoming lost and diluted by an irresistable need to increase the commercial quotient.  Shyamalan keeps any idiosyncratic histronics at bay with the actors, a predeliction which has become his trademark; this also functions as a sterilizing agent, ensuring the purity of the drama by neutralizing any contaminating Hollywood habits.  The primary directive of the piece is wish fulfillment, a desire to take the phrase &quot;science fiction&quot; and truncate the latter term, to convert fantasy into reality, to make the dreams of a child as tangible and reproducible as a chemistry experiment; to be certain, that has happened before, the successful voyage to the moon representing a single example.  But we're probably not destined to land on every moon; nevertheless, Shyamalan crafted an engaging tale of one handicapped man's epic quest to touch down on his own personal Sea Of Tranquility.Unbreakable is not a perfect film; indeed, there are one or two lapses in logic.  Still, it is worth a viewing.  One last note: it surpasses the attempts of Signs at allegorical fable-creation.",4,"For every person that is cursed, one must be blessed...",1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,3370,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'followup', 'blockbuster', 'debut', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'regarded', 'many', 'tepid', 'piece', 'best', 'idea', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'creepy', 'enough', 'speed', 'plot', 'was', 'taken', 'task', 'cited', 'primary', 'spoiler', 'experience', 'merit', 'criticism', 'Unbreakable', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'what', 'superlative', 'exercise', 'concept', 'suspense.Bruce', 'Willis', 'David', 'Dunn', 'aptly', 'named', 'man', 'given/surname', 'appropriately', 'reflect', 'prosaic', 'ordinariness', 'staid', 'life', 'just', 'security', 'guard', 'exciting', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'whatsoever', 'life', 'more', 'kinetic', 'turn', 'when', 'train', 'gains', 'bit', 'fame', 'being', 'sole', 'survivor', 'wreckage', 'fact', 'noticed', 'more', 'exotically', 'christened', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'brought', 'life', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'tragic', 'figure', 'who', 'congenital', 'condition', 'skeletal', 'system', 'as', 'brittle', 'thin', 'crystal', 'Price', 'obsessed', 'comic', 'books', 'omnipotent', 'characters', 'represent', 'antithesis', 'horrible', 'physical', 'limitations', 'were', 'conveyed', 'effectively', 'cruel', 'scene', 'where', 'down', 'flight', 'hard', 'steps', 'bones', 'shattering', 'dropped', 'china', 'obsession', 'as', 'well', 'locate', 'real', 'superhero', 'least', 'one', 'demigod', 'walks', 'human', 'race', 'convinced', 'Dunn', 'one', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'find', 'inner', 'Son-Of-Jor-El', 'Dunn', 'naturally', 'ground', 'flight', 'fancy', 'problem', 'when', 'son-', 'who', 'also', 'derivative', 'DC', 'magic-', 'test', 'hypothesis', 'shooting', 'powerful', 'moment', 'So', 'who', 'right', 'Price', 'Dunn', 'conclusion', 'sinister', 'revelations.One', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'understood', 'Unbreakable', 'essentially', 'film-school', 'project', 'blown', 'up', 'multiplex-ready', 'proportions', 'dark', 'somber', 'tone', 'never', 'ameliorated', 'narrative', 'consistent', 'depressive', 'feel', 'home', 'budding', 'Spielberg', 'thesis', 'most', 'likely', 'what', 'initiated', 'tentative', 'reception', 'approach', 'actually', 'crucial', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'allowed', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'viewer', 'opposed', 'becoming', 'lost', 'diluted', 'irresistable', 'need', 'increase', 'commercial', 'quotient', 'Shyamalan', 'idiosyncratic', 'histronics', 'bay', 'actors', 'predeliction', 'become', 'trademark', 'also', 'sterilizing', 'agent', 'ensuring', 'purity', 'drama', 'neutralizing', 'contaminating', 'Hollywood', 'habits', 'primary', 'directive', 'piece', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'desire', 'take', 'phrase', 'quot', 'science', 'fiction', 'quot', 'truncate', 'latter', 'term', 'convert', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'make', 'dreams', 'child', 'tangible', 'reproducible', 'chemistry', 'experiment', 'be', 'certain', 'happened', 'successful', 'voyage', 'moon', 'representing', 'single', 'example', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'destined', 'land', 'moon', 'nevertheless', 'Shyamalan', 'crafted', 'engaging', 'tale', 'one', 'handicapped', 'man', 'epic', 'quest', 'touch', 'down', 'own', 'personal', 'Sea', 'Tranquility.Unbreakable', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'indeed', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'lapses', 'logic', 'Still', 'viewing', 'One', 'last', 'note', 'attempts', 'Signs', 'allegorical', 'fable-creation']",Unbreakable

Most movies made nowadays seem to be content to merely photograph what is happening, not caring to a great degree about the use of color and the placement of objects and people on the screen (you know, cinematography). Well, that problem is definitely not to be found in this movie. Truly it must be watched over and over again to fully grasp all the subtle hints being tossed your way by the director. For instance, in Unbreakable green symbolizes good, and purple and orange symbolize evil. So throughout the movie, you might want to keep an eye on the color of the environments, and the colors that different people wear. Many of the scenes with Mr. Glass start by us seeing him through a reflection of through a glass window. And then there's the whole comic book aspect of the movie. If you look at the entire movie as one issue of a comic book, the angles used, the use of lighting, and the things said by characters all take on a whole new meaning.

No, I'm not talking about the plot to this movie; I'm talking about what literally happened to this film, only because it was born second. M. Night Shyamalan, who some call the next Steven Spielberg, got very lucky when his first big movie, The Sixth Sense, did as well as it did. Chilling, than surprising audiences with it's original plot and breathtaking ending, it became the golden child. Than Unbreakable came, was it bad? No. Was it good? Fairly. Was it as good as The Sixth Sense? NO. And that right there is your answer to why you heard that this movie was a complete waste of time and money. It wasn't AS GOOD.But so what. Every movie can't be amazing and if we're talking in terms of a normal, moderately interesting and somewhat well done film, than this one passes. The plot is great, the script is fine, most of the acting is good, some is terrific (Samuel L. Jackson is tremendous) there's really nothing seriously wrong with this movie.But in all fairness, I'll tell you what is. Bruce Willis, praised endlessly for his performance in The Sixth Sense, is sometimes a little too gawky and memorized. His astonishment becomes old fast, but he doesn't seem to realize that because there are very few parts of the movie where he doesn't act stupidly awed. Yes, his acting was sadly on the fine line between good and bad and tipping dangerously close to the later. But, the only other thing that I really thought was wrong was the darkness.Yes, I think there was a little too much emotional darkness. David Dunn (Willis) and his wife (Robin Wright Penn) are in the middle of a divorce, Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah, leads the most tortured, painful and joy-free life imaginable, and the ending involves criminal insanity, which is never pleasant.All this contrasts interestingly with the family aspect of the movie. The other side of the whole divorce thing and also Dunn's relationship with his young son - played by Spencer Treat Clark.So, basically, my point is, nothing is perfect. Who says that once a director makes a close to perfect movie, his next one can't have a few more flaws? Forget, The Sixth Sense while watching this movie, it'll make it easier to enjoy because it is enjoyable.",4,The under-appreciated younger child.,1029196800,"08 13, 2002",2002,2310,"['classic', 'scenario', 'average', 'younger', 'sibling', 'overshadowed', 'older', 'sibling', 'greatness', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'plot', 'movie', ""'m"", 'talking', 'what', 'literally', 'happened', 'film', 'only', 'was', 'born', 'second', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'call', 'next', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'got', 'very', 'lucky', 'when', 'first', 'big', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Chilling', 'surprising', 'audiences', 'original', 'plot', 'breathtaking', 'ending', 'became', 'golden', 'child', 'Than', 'Unbreakable', 'came', 'was', 'bad', 'Was', 'good', 'Fairly', 'Was', 'as', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'NO', 'right', 'answer', 'why', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'was', ""n't"", 'AS', 'GOOD.But', 'what', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'amazing', ""'re"", 'talking', 'terms', 'normal', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'one', 'plot', 'great', 'script', 'fine', 'most', 'acting', 'good', 'terrific', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'tremendous', 'really', 'nothing', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'movie.But', 'fairness', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'praised', 'endlessly', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'gawky', 'memorized', 'astonishment', 'old', 'fast', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', ""n't"", 'act', 'stupidly', 'awed', 'Yes', 'acting', 'was', 'sadly', 'fine', 'line', 'good', 'bad', 'tipping', 'dangerously', 'close', 'later', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'darkness.Yes', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'darkness', 'David', 'Dunn', 'Willis', 'wife', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'are', 'middle', 'divorce', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Elijah', 'most', 'tortured', 'painful', 'joy-free', 'life', 'imaginable', 'ending', 'involves', 'criminal', 'insanity', 'never', 'pleasant.All', 'interestingly', 'family', 'aspect', 'movie', 'other', 'side', 'whole', 'divorce', 'thing', 'also', 'Dunn', 'relationship', 'young', 'son', 'played', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark.So', 'basically', 'point', 'nothing', 'perfect', 'Who', 'once', 'director', 'close', 'perfect', 'movie', 'next', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'few', 'more', 'flaws', 'Forget', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'make', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'enjoyable']",Unbreakable

Burton's &quot;Batman&quot; is arguably the best of the bunch, with Raimi's &quot;Spiderman&quot; coming in a distant second. However entertaining those films might be, they miss out on the most important part of the superhero story....the hero's discovery of their powers and why they were put on this earth. &quot;Batman&quot; just jumps into Bruce Wayne's story, &quot;Spiderman&quot; spends all of 10 minutes on Peter Parker's development of his powers. But in &quot;Unbreakable,&quot; it takes our hero approximately an hour and a half to learn of his powers and why he has them. Shyamalan has created an amazingly detailed and wonderfully slow-paced film that tells us who the major players are, why they are important, and why David Dunn is, or is not, a reluctant superhero. Many reviewers of this film feel that it is too slowly paced and that it doesn't pack the action of a 'superhero-type' movie. This may be true, but this was just the first film in a proposed trilogy of films that Shyamalan would like to do about these characters. If this so-called trilogy is made(both Willis &amp; Jackson have reportedly expressed interest in completing it), then this film will be seen in a whole different light. As it is, I think this is Shyamalan's best film. Sam Jackson's portrayal of 'Mr. Glass' is quite powerful, he gets you to feel sorry for him before you find out the truth about his condition and why he is so interested in David Dun (Willis). The sheer gloom and murkiness of this film make it one of my all-time favorites and I love the fantastic camera work in this picture. Not really a film I would recommend to non-comic collectors. But for those of you who digs them as much as I do, please dive right in!(No pun intended) A great film that has strong performances from all involved and gives the viewer that fantastic jaw-dropper of an ending.

It seemed slow, and as I didn't know what to expect, in the end it even seemed a bit silly. I wasn't dissapointed by the film but I didn't like it that much either. I believe that it was due to prejudism and due to the fact that at first I didn't understand the writer's point of view. Many people sounded dissapointed at the end of the film and all this negative fuss made me believe that the film wasn't that much.I write this article after having seen the film for a third time and knowing that it is nothing less that a masterpiece. Here I present some of the factors that led me to this conclusion:-The directing of the film leads to new directions and presents the facts clearly, with a slow but steady pace that increases in climax as the film progresses. I just admired in awe how the director perceived the scenes and presented them in film. Great - Great job!!!-Bruce Willis is great!! Samuel Jackson is even better!! Both of them are what make the movie unique and even though a good script can boost the actor's performance no-one can say that they both act nothing less that perfect!!!-It's a superhero film- But then it's not!! What I mean is that it's not Batman, Superman, Spiderman and all the kinda of superheroes you know of. Its the real superhero kinda of guy that really exists! He might live near you but you just don't know it. He doesn't know it. The facts are presented so well that you only have to be mind opened to accept what the writer wants to tell in his film. Nobody has done it before. Create a myth in a single movie out of nowhere. You just know that M.S. is not only a true talent but the teacher himself who knows what he does and you can trust him. Even though Signs that followed this film was weak because I believe the writer/director was in a hurry to end the film and didn't pay that much attention to the script, I can forgive him as he really doesn't have to prove anything.So don't play this movie for your father because he won't understand it!

Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark, Charlayne Woodard, Eamonn Walker, Leslie Stefanson, Johny Hiram Jamison, Michaelia Carroll.Running Time:  106 minutesRated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including some disturbing violent content, and for a crude sexual reference.M Night Shyamalan's eagerly awaited follow-up to the astonishing, genre-defining ""The Sixth Sense"" may not hit the heady heights of its predecessor, but it is still an intriguing film.  Bruce Willis (returning with Shyamalan after his stunning performance in ""The Sixth Sense"") is American everyman David Dunn. His marriage has fallen apart and he finds it hard to relate to his young son. After years as a security guard at the local football stadium, he goes to New York for a job interview. On the journey home, the train crashes at high speed. Dunn is the only survivor and emerges from the wreckage completely unscathed and something of a media celebrity.  His story is followed closely by local comic book enthusiast Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), an unhinged loner with a rare genetic disorder that makes him prone to broken bones. Price becomes convinced that Dunn is some kind of super-human, immune to pain or injury, and constantly pesters him about his history and lifestyle. It suddenly dawns on Dunn that he has never had a sick day or been injured in any way his whole life. He also has an uncanny knack of spotting potential trouble-makers and ne'er-do-wells at the football stadium. Price claims his choice of profession was borne of a subconscious desire to protect people and urges him to harness his powers in the conquest of evil, but Dunn is a reluctant superman. Despite an improvement in his relationship with his son (who is thrilled to have a comic book hero for a Dad) he remains unconvinced he is anything other than normal man (albeit a thick-skinned one).Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in ""The Sixth Sense"" and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves,the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised.  ""Unbreakable"" never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves to be a tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves.  Not up to par with ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", but certainly worth the gander.",3,Unbreakable  (2000),1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2705,"['Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'ShyamalanCast', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'Charlayne', 'Woodard', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'Leslie', 'Stefanson', 'Johny', 'Hiram', 'Jamison', 'Michaelia', 'Carroll.Running', 'Time', '106', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'mature', 'thematic', 'elements', 'including', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'content', 'crude', 'sexual', 'reference.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'follow-up', 'astonishing', 'genre-defining', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'may', 'not', 'hit', 'heady', 'heights', 'predecessor', 'still', 'intriguing', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'returning', 'Shyamalan', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'American', 'everyman', 'David', 'Dunn', 'marriage', 'fallen', 'apart', 'hard', 'relate', 'young', 'son', 'years', 'security', 'guard', 'local', 'football', 'stadium', 'New', 'York', 'job', 'interview', 'journey', 'home', 'train', 'crashes', 'high', 'speed', 'Dunn', 'only', 'survivor', 'emerges', 'wreckage', 'completely', 'unscathed', 'something', 'media', 'celebrity', 'story', 'followed', 'closely', 'local', 'comic', 'book', 'enthusiast', 'Elijah', 'Price', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'unhinged', 'loner', 'rare', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'prone', 'broken', 'bones', 'Price', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'Dunn', 'kind', 'super-human', 'immune', 'pain', 'injury', 'constantly', 'pesters', 'history', 'lifestyle', 'suddenly', 'Dunn', 'never', 'had', 'sick', 'day', 'been', 'injured', 'way', 'whole', 'life', 'also', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'spotting', 'potential', 'trouble-makers', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'football', 'stadium', 'Price', 'claims', 'choice', 'profession', 'was', 'borne', 'subconscious', 'desire', 'protect', 'people', 'harness', 'powers', 'conquest', 'evil', 'Dunn', 'reluctant', 'superman', 'improvement', 'relationship', 'son', 'who', 'thrilled', 'have', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'Dad', 'unconvinced', 'anything', 'other', 'normal', 'man', 'thick-skinned', 'one', '.Obsessive', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'performance', 'big', 'wigged', 'Jackson', 'wide-eyed', 'stare', 'grandiose', 'dialogue', 'Willis', 'whispering', 'trick', 'again', 'did', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'portray', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'needed', 'character', 'David', 'Much', 'better', 'are', 'Clark', 'Penn', 'David', 'son', 'wife', 'whom', 'find', 'questioning', 'David', 'as', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'are', 'built', 'up', 'well', 'obligatory', 'twist', 'end', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'disguised', 'Unbreakable', 'never', 'fully', 'stride', 'end', 'when', 'be', 'tense', 'thriller', 'full', 'quasi-supernatural', 'imagery', 'Shyamalan', 'Not', 'par', 'Signs', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'certainly', 'gander']",Unbreakable

532698,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00003CXQA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 4]","I don't understand why ""Unbreakable"", M. Night Shymalan's second film is not more widely praised. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a hard act to follow, but ""Unbreakable"" is a remarkably good film and one of my favorites.If you look at the career of Shyamalan, the similarities to the career of Orson Welles are remarkable. Each started off with a bang, creating truly memorable films. Granted, ""The Sixth Sense"" is no ""Citizen Kane"", but both are remarkable in their own rites. Then each made a second film which was good, but flawed. In Welles case, this may have been the result of studio tampering. After that, each subsequent film has been less successful, less interesting, and less memorable. Welles will always be remembered for his masterful first film, and some flawed but interesting work throughout his career, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" stands out as a good example. It is far too early to tell if Shyamalan will suffer the same fate, but after the disastrous ""The Village"" and the mediocre ""Lady in the Water"", it doesn't look promising for the former wunderkind.David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard at a college football stadium in Philadelphia, travels home from New York on the train. As he flirts with a woman and contemplates how well his interview went, he begins to notice something is wrong. Then the train crashes. David is the only survivor and he doesn't have a cut on him. His wife, Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), are overjoyed to see him when he is released from the hospital. Soon, David receives an invitation from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), the owner of a rare comic book store called ""Limited Edition"", to come and visit. Elijah has a rare disease making his bones brittle. When he was born, his legs and arms were broken during delivery. Elijah is convinced that David has superpowers, but David is dubious. Soon, he begins to wonder and puts himself to various tests.""Unbreakable"" is a very intelligent, well made movie about the myth of superheroes. I think the film may have been a little ahead of its time. Shortly after the film's release, Michael Chabon published ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" and suddenly there were many projects examining the origin of myth and superheroes, giving the ideas entertaining twists and fictionalized roots. So why didn't ""Unbreakable"" catch on? I'm not sure. Perhaps the film's approach is too cerebral, rooting everything too much in the real world. People may have been disappointed because David never really takes on a super hero persona. It happens in stages, in a more subtle way.There are many layers to every character, giving them depth and interest, making it a joy to watch them. David is a minimum wage security guard struggling with his relationship with his wife and child. He is trying to get a better job, to make things easier for them, to ease the strain on the family. The train accident leaves him shell shocked, but he doesn't give it much thought. Then, when he meets Elijah, he naturally discounts the strange man's theories. But Elijah has many facets as well. He sells rare comic books and comic book art, something that kept him going through his lonely childhood. But he won't sell the prized possessions to just anyone. He is far too attached to the pieces for that, they have to be able to appreciate the work they are about to purchase. If he doesn't believe they will, he doesn't sell it. He is obsessed with all things `comic book'. As he grows older, he becomes convinced that there are real super heroes out in the world and scans newspaper stories and newscasts for stories about survivors. Then David appears, in his own hometown, and he is sure.This is one of Bruce Willis' best performances to date. As David, he is a quiet man, unsure of his status in life at any point. Then, as he begins to question why he survived this train wreck, when no one else did, he becomes even more skeptical. As he deals with these questions, he still has to deal with the problems most people have; his strained relationship with his wife (they sleep in different rooms), his son, work, money and more. As he slowly becomes convinced of Elijah's theories, he sets small tasks for himself; he bench presses huge amounts of weight, as his son watches with admiration, he can see or sense things about people just by touching them, he looks for people to help. At one point, he decides the idea is just too ludicrous and completely discounts it, causing Joseph to become confused. Joseph is so sure his dad has superpowers that he sets a test of his own. This is a very emotional scene because everyone is scared. When Joseph presents the challenge, David is scared that he may just be a regular human and will die. So he yells at his son, his wife yells at their son, finally getting him to stop.We meet Elijah, right after he is born, and learn of his condition. Later, as a young boy we learn of his loneliness. He doesn't like to go outside, to play, because he always breaks a bone and that causes him pain. Then, as an adult, Samuel L. Jackson takes over the role; walking with a glass cane, wearing predominantly purple clothes, Elijah is a memorable presence. At one point, he chases a man David stopped, to see if he is actually has an item that David saw, providing more evidence of the security guard's powers. Chasing the man, on his fragile legs, he trips and crashes down some stairs. In the next scene, David meets Elijah who is now in a wheelchair, his legs broken and immobilized to help them to heal. Elijah is even more determined to prove David has unusual powers, but David is even more reluctant. As the two characters continue to exchange ideas and thoughts, we realize there is something going on, below the surface that we can't quite identify. Something that is driving both of them.Shyamalan does a masterful job with much of the film, letting scenes play out, letting them go to places we might not expect. There are many scenes involving David and his family and many may ask why it is necessary to have to watch this. Let's get to the superhero flying. These scenes add texture and back-story to the characters. Because we know David is having trouble with his family, we understand why he is reluctant to immediately jump into the role of superhero. He doesn't want any harm to come to them. Also, he is just learning about the whole thing, we are watching the birth of the character. As he deals with his job, we learn about events in his past, revealing a lifelong reticence to create or attract attention.One particularly impressive scene happens late in the film. Almost convinced, David sets out to prove that he has some powers. With Elijah's guidance, he goes to Grand Central Station and walks slowly through the crowds of people. As he has just left work, and it is raining, he still wears his Security poncho, his cape. As he brushes against people, he is able to sense something about them; he is looking for someone to help, to save. One teenager participated in an assault, throwing a bottle at two African American couples from a passing car, injuring one of the women. Another college student took advantage of a drunken co-ed in his dorm and he now returns home to mom and dad. Then David finds him; brushing against a maintenance worker, he gets a vision of the man invading a home and causing all forms of havoc. This is David's test. He follows the man to his new home and quickly assesses the situation before setting about his task. This scene is masterful because it contains almost no dialogue, yet we always understand what is going on. It is also suspenseful and well done.Perhaps even better, is the next scene in which David reveals to his son what happened the night before. Joseph starts to cry because he is both proud of his Dad and happy to see that he was right.Shyamalan also introduces us to Elijah very early and lets us see some key moments in his life, developing the character even further. The obsession with comic books, his belief in human super heroes, and his disease will all make sense in the end.All that said, the film is available as part of a two DVD set. The second DVD has a wealth of extras, including a documentary narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and many more standard extras hosted by the director, `making of' documentaries, creation of technical aspects, etc. But the packaging is some of the worst I have ever seen. The film is packaged in a cardboard sleeve, which is encased in a cardboard slip cover. Because of this, the box was partially smashed when I received it. Removing the plastic and the security tags yanked off a large chunk of the cover art. The security sticker was stuck directly to the cardboard and the cover art. The package is completely ruined because of this. This damage could've been avoided by using the regular plastic holders 99% of DVDs are packaged in.""Unbreakable"" is a film I think about often. The performances are powerful, the story is interesting and believable and the production values are top notch.

532699,A3I2GBE2KGQV1U,B00003CXQA,"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley""","[1, 7]","&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a film that starts out wonderfully, then gets more and more lost as it goes.  The basic premise - to make superheroes genuinely possible - is another bold move from Shyamalan, but that can only take a flawed film so far.M. Night Shyamalan, or Night, as most film journalists call him, is a master of creating atmosphere, and this is quite a grim film.  It almost makes his previous &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; seem bright and cheery.  However, when you consider the over the top action and flamboyancy of the recent &quot;Batman&quot; movies, as well as many other comic book films of the past, this is a generally wise move.  It makes it all seem just a little more plausible.The characters are well-written and real:  no one is the bold and noble hero, no one is the evil-to-the-core villain.  Even Dunn's (Willis') family is going through some hard times, with him carrying his share of the blame.  Willis' plays his character as a man lost in thought a good majority of the time, and considering everything this man has to endure before he even discovers his potential, this is entirely real.Samuel L. Jackson, who is well known for his own tough-guy image, has to imagine himself in the shoes of a man who has never been tough, never been strong, no matter how much he wanted to be.  Jackson pulls it off wonderfully, emphasizing humor and some charm, traits that are winning when you're physical presence may not be.So far, so good.  However, as the film progresses into it's final half-hour, it makes some serious judgement errors, and some of the results are laughable.  It's horrible to see a good movie go to waste because the people behind it seemed to have forgotten what they wanted to have happen.  Dunn's first &quot;outing&quot; as a superhero is a bit anti-climactic, and then everything that follows is just plain silly.I didn't find this to be a three-star movie, but it's closer to that than it is to two.  As it stands, I plan on seeing the first of the two sequels.  However, if this new twist on the superhero genre goes wrong a second time, you can bet that I'm out of the third.",3,A new twist...,986256000,"04 3, 2001",2001,2126,"['quot', 'Unbreakable', 'quot', 'film', 'out', 'wonderfully', 'then', 'more', 'more', 'lost', 'basic', 'premise', 'make', 'superheroes', 'genuinely', 'possible', 'bold', 'move', 'Shyamalan', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'flawed', 'film', 'so', 'far.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Night', 'most', 'film', 'journalists', 'call', 'master', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'grim', 'film', 'almost', 'previous', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'bright', 'cheery', 'However', 'when', 'consider', 'top', 'action', 'flamboyancy', 'recent', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'past', 'generally', 'wise', 'move', 'seem', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'plausible.The', 'characters', 'are', 'well-written', 'real', 'one', 'bold', 'noble', 'hero', 'one', 'evil-to-the-core', 'villain', 'Even', 'Dunn', 'Willis', 'family', 'going', 'hard', 'times', 'carrying', 'share', 'blame', 'Willis', 'character', 'man', 'lost', 'thought', 'good', 'majority', 'time', 'considering', 'everything', 'man', 'endure', 'even', 'potential', 'entirely', 'real.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'own', 'tough-guy', 'image', 'imagine', 'shoes', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'tough', 'never', 'been', 'strong', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'be', 'Jackson', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'emphasizing', 'humor', 'charm', 'traits', 'are', 'winning', 'when', ""'re"", 'physical', 'presence', 'may', 'not', 'be.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'However', 'film', 'final', 'half-hour', 'serious', 'judgement', 'errors', 'results', 'are', 'laughable', 'horrible', 'see', 'good', 'movie', 'go', 'waste', 'people', 'seemed', 'have', 'forgotten', 'what', 'wanted', 'have', 'happen', 'Dunn', 'first', 'quot', 'outing', 'quot', 'superhero', 'bit', 'anti-climactic', 'then', 'everything', 'just', 'plain', 'silly.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'three-star', 'movie', 'closer', 'two', 'plan', 'seeing', 'first', 'two', 'sequels', 'However', 'new', 'twist', 'superhero', 'genre', 'wrong', 'second', 'time', 'can', 'bet', ""'m"", 'third']",Unbreakable

The first half of the movie was awesome, but as Shyamalan movies tend to do, it got weird, in this case too weird for me. While I love Samuel L. Jackson, his character was just annoying and I didn't really consider him a threatening villain. Bruce Willis on the other hand was terrific, but his character was just naturally dull. Shyamalan wanted to keep the story as real and believable as possible, but a superhero who just can't get hurt and has no other real powers is just kind of stupid.

This will be a short review on the contrary of what 95% of the viewers have given the movie (four to five stars).From what I gathered, the movie is about one hour and forty minutes of Bruce Willis' character realizing just what he is...a seemingly immortal, ""unbreakable"" human being.Along the way, it's almost as if it's a search for an arch enemy.  When you watch this movie, you will understand, I guess.The reason i give this film two stars is that nothing really happens in the film.  It's a really good idea that misses out with it's slow and methodical tempo.  I won't necessarily say it's ""unwatchable,"" but I was disappointed with the anticipation I had for this movie.  Boredom and bedtime is really what pops through the mind once you reach the first hours end.Aside from the general idea of the movie, the only good thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty ... good.I realize I am in the minority in this review...but there are two sides to every story.

Bruce Willis was found to have semi-super strength and ESP type powers.  But this didn't mean he could life cars and buildings or control peoples minds.  It just meant he could lift more weight than would be expected of him, he could take a beating and be fine and would get visions of peoples thoughts if he touched them.  This movie did not try to create a hero who would be unbelievable in the real world.  After watching this movie people could actually believe that people like Bryce Willis existed.  The only flaw of this movie is the director.  The day before I watched this I watched &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

As a matter of fact, I cringe when they come out because they are all too often done poorly. The general public wants to be entertained by comic book movies... Comic book fans are more concerned with intergrity. Anyone who's read &quot;The Watchmen&quot; would probably understand. We appreciate it when the story isn't outweighed by the special effects. Slow? Yes, but then a lot of my favorite movies move at a snails pace (&quot;Round Midnight).

Unbreakable is not a &quot;superhero&quot; movie in the vein of Superman or Robocop or even in the vein of Die Hard and other action films that are essentially superhero movies.  Unbreakable takes itself extremely seriously, and many people fault it for this, but The Iliad and The Odyssey, to name a couple, also take themselves seriously despite the fantastic occurrences which take place in them, don't they?  Unbreakable is meant to be a modern day myth; a legend.  Another reason for all the disappointed reviews is that people were expecting Unbreakable to be a thriller, so realize before watching it that it's a very slow moving, very melancholy and brooding drama.

532709,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00003CXQA,V. Berk,"[0, 0]","M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is very rare class of superhero film, trying to be incredibly logical, while also having plenty of absurd moments.  This is okay, sense the director's other films have also followed a similar formula... But, typically with his films you find yourself taken away by the emotional drama and characters, and the films move along so quickly you never really get a chance to stop and question the logic behind the events, because if you had the chance to question it you'd realize how ridiculous the entire situation is.We are introduced to the story with an awkward man by the name of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard, who seems to have some serious issues in regards to being social, and communicating.  While on his way back to New York he winds up being the only man to survive a colossal train crash (the other is seen dying from substantial injuries, giving us a wonderful shot of Willis being counseled by the doctor as you slowly see a flailing sheet soak in blood).  He emerges from this crash completely unharmed, which leads to speculation and confusion from doctors, and the media.  Soon after he is given a letter from an art gallery, which displays comic book art entitled ""Limited Edition"".  There he meets the owner, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a man who has suffered from multiple injuries as a result of weak bones, making kids call him ""Mister Glass"".  Since he spent one third of his life in the hospital he has read many comic books, and takes them to a serious level of philosophy and sub textual meanings, and he believes David to be a real life hero.  To Elijah, comics aren't children's tales about men in brightly colored outfits fighting menacing beings of evil seeking the destruction of good, but as one of mankind's most important visual arts.As the plot moves on the evidence of ""truth behind the panels"" become clear to David and Elijah, though David doesn't want to accept this, for the already strained relationship between his wife and son has only just started to mend itself after the train crash.  The audience can tell that this will ultimately end with David accepting the truth and mending relations with his family, and they can also anticipate the typical Syamalan twist ending.Yes, this is a drama with a concept that is hard to take seriously, but Willis and Jackson do take it seriously and that's all that really matters in a movie like Unbreakable, where acting can be the saving grace of the plot's weaknesses.  The two leading actors' performances are worth noting, as is the director's keen attention to details, and sense of visual style.  The music score is at times rather slow, not really capturing the right emotion for the events taking place on screen and that lessens the power of the film.  The twist at the end will probably be anticipated by most moviegoers, or comic book readers, but it isn't as simple as the twist in films such as The Village (Honestly, shame on you if you didn't see that one coming).  This film isn't as good as `Signs', or `The Sixth Sense', but fans of Shymalan's other films will certainly accept this one with arms open wide.The best parts for me (as a writer, and a comic reader) came from Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah Price.  When he got in character and talked about how grand and important the story-telling history behind comic books I felt completely attached to the character.  I grew attached in these moments because I do believe comics are much more than simple stories to amuse children.  They are a very important way of communication, and have been for centuries.  Struggles of good versus evil, right and wrong, they have modeled lots of our cultural traits, whether we believe it or not.  These, philosophical speeches he gives describing comics, and the art styles characters are drawn in captures the truth behind comics, and I hope if anything people can come out of seeing this film with a greater respect for this age old genre of story-telling.Unbreakable does suffer several problems, which is why the highest rating I can bring myself to give it is four stars.  The main problems, for me, are found in the musical score and the pace of certain scenes.  At times this film is incredibly...well boring.  By boring I do not me it lacks action (you shouldn't expect much adrenaline pumping action in ANY of Shyamalan's films, because he lacks a visual style suited for action), but as in some scenes just don't have any compelling force to catch the audience's attention.  The music, as I said is slow, and I feel it could've really improved these slow scenes if it would've had the musical score that caught your attention, not as in loud and obnoxious, but subtle and mysterious, because for me this film was a supernatural mystery tale, so I think the score should've been more mysterious, dark, and forbidding.Unbreakable is not as good as `Signs' or `The Sixth Sense' (my personal opinion, so don't get testy if you disagree), but if you DID enjoy those two previously listed films you'll probably enjoy Unbreakable.  If you only liked `Signs' and `The Sixth Sense' because of their suspense, sci-fi, supernatural, and horror aspects, well, you need to realize Unbreakable is a totally different supernatural-drama, so you might want to ignore this one if you don't want to see a superhero film where the ""Hero"" only takes up the task of fighting evil in the last twenty minutes of the film.  If you watch Shymalan's films because of their style, and emotion, than hop aboard, sit back, relax, and enjoy Unbreakable for what it is.Shaky, but manages to squeeze out a 4/5 from me due to all the things it did RIGHT, and for the performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis",4,Comics as a fine art,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,5744,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Unbreakable', 'very', 'rare', 'class', 'superhero', 'film', 'trying', 'be',

532717,A1H8HHH9WCHZO9,B00003CXQA,"William A Baurle ""WeeWillyWinky""","[3, 4]","I was initially disappointed with the climax of this film. My heart sank, not so much because of what had occurred in the movie but because I felt that my growing admiration for M. Night Shyamalan had been seriously damaged. The climax felt trite, contrived, and thoroughly unrewarding. I felt for a moment that the things Night's detractors had said about him were true. That is, until I took the DVD out and decided to give what I had just seen some serious thought. After a few minutes the realization sank in: the climax to Unbreakable is the only conclusion it could logically have come to, given everything that precedes it and given the themes it develops. In this way it is nearly on par with The Sixth Sense.Ostensibly, this is a film concerning the relationship between David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the lone survivor of a train derailment, and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a collector and afficianado of comic books. Elijah believes Dunn to be the superhero he has been looking for all his life, the exact opposite of himself, as Elijah has been afflicted since birth with a medical condition which causes his bones to break very easily. The story follows Elijah's efforts to convince Dunn that he is truly a superhero. But in Unbreakable, as with most of Night's films, there are many different stories and themes inter-acting with one another. On the simplest level, it's a story about a superhero, his classic reluctance to attain to his role due to a quiet humility and a lack of selfish ambition. It's also a love story, and, as is typical with Night's masterful storytelling, there are several love relationships being examined: father and son (Dunn and Joseph), mother and son (Elijah and his mother), and husband and wife. Intertwined with that there is a story of frustration, anger, resentment, and evil. Since this is a film about opposites, there are equal glimpses into the workings of good and evil, and the various types and magnitudes of both. On the side of the good we see the common love of parents for their children, the sacrifice of a promising career and great success for the sake of romantic love, and the selfless intervention at the scene of a horrendous crime to save the innocent. On the side of evil we see petty theft, barbarous torture and murder, and calculated, catastrophic massacre.I could go on and on about the possible themes treated in this amazing film. The one that really jumped out at me is the old argument between Freewill and Determinism. How Elijah Price comes to be the person he is is brilliantly executed, especially in a flashback scene where his mother entices her son to go outside and get a gift she has left for him on a park bench. The gift turns out to be a comic book, and Elijah's mother tells him that she has bought a bunch of them. So Elijah is rewarded for his virtuous effort of going out into a dangerous world by acquiring access to a fantasy world where heroism and virtue are delineated with vivid clarity. But being the intelligent child that he is, Elijah also sees that for every hero there is a villain, for every act of good, a contrary act of evil; for every good thing, a bad thing: a balance. It is not for nothing that when Elijah opens the gift the comic book is upside down. He will see things upside down at another point in the film, and there is a strong thematic purpose behind it, as there is a strong thematic purpose in his interest, even obsession, with comics.What has this to do with freewill versus determinism? A lot. Was Elijah's personality mapped out for him by his initial circumstances? Certainly his medical disability is not his choice, but to what extent does the vulnerability and weakness caused by that disorder effect his character, his life choices, his destiny? Some would say a great deal, others would say his choices were entirely his own despite the disadvantages he was beset with. It's a huge ethical issue which goes far beyond the parameters of a simple superhero flick. And it's an issue which in bygone days I thought I was decided on, but which now leaves me entangled in doubt and wonder.Unbreakable is also a study in the struggle for identity and sense of purpose, and in this respect it has something in common with the later film, Lady in the Water.

532721,AEGBJ94DCVH5Y,B00003CXQA,x_bruce,"[5, 6]","Comparing The Sixth Sense to Unbreakable, and this is a fair thing to do as they share several plot and thematic ideas, finds Unbreakable being a sombre but ulitimately positive and affirming film.There is considerable restraint in the acting with good use of body language and facial expression to a somewhat gritty to mildly surreal series of events. Bruce Willis plays a haunted, sole survivor of a train wreck. His character is bewildered and unsure of himself. This has been noted in other reviews but the road to understanding who and what he is drives the film.Samuel Jackson's character is nicely set up through scenes of his birth and childhood. His character is a mystery, at once authoritative but physically fragile. As a man he is detatched and difficult to like although he commands interest. His life also reveals itself by the end of the film.In general Unbreakable is about connections, paralells and contrast. It's dark and brooding look fits the story well. It is a slow paced film with a surprise ending that works and explains details of how the story came to develop. The film is quiet as well which also helps focus on the self descovery theme.The acting is very good, Jackson has a knack for playing unique roles in big budget and modest films as well. For a leading man figure it is refreshing to see him shift to a character actor type of role where he can stretch his acting skills.The shared items with The Sixth Sense are in the surprise ending, road to discovery themes, timeless sense and a host of smaller ideas that make both films similar except for their endings although both deal with coming to terms and being ready.Since The Sixth Sense was such a success impossibly high expectations were made of Unbreakable, expectations that couldn't be lived up to due to the subject matter and concept of it's plot and characters.

Night Shyamalan, movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and even ""Lady in the Water"" (provided you view it with the right perspective) can be enjoyed again and again.  ""Unbreakable"" is a little different in that it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings.  However, the first viewing will still provide a mind-bending experience worthy of M. Night.For a basic plot summary, ""Unbreakable"" focuses on David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who walks away from a horrible train wreck as the only survivor...and without a scratch on him.  After meeting with eccentric comic book dealer ""Mr. Glass"" (Samuel L. Jackson), David begins to question whether or not that train wreck survival was a ""miracle"" at all.  When he discovers that he has never been sick that he can remember and that he possess certain prognosticative powers, he begins to wonder just who (or what) exactly he might be.This film is typical M. Night fare in that it weaves a great mystery and gets you thinking all the way through.  It isn't a ""sit back and pop the popcorn"" kind of flick.  Instead, it thrives on the viewer using some mental effort and getting caught up in the seemingly impossible tale of David Dunn and Mr. Glass.  As such, it might be a bit slow for some viewers, but if you like any of M. Night's other works (or even those type of movies) you'll have no trouble here.About the only bad thing I have to say about this film is that it is only truly remarkable on the first viewing.  After that (unless you have a short memory!) it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings.  The reason?  This one is ALL about the mystery, lacking the strong auxiliary characters like ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"".Overall, ""Unbreakable"" is a fine film that showcases the M. Night mysterious style of film-making.
