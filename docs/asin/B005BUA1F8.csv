1452834,ASU4YD8GKQBH,B005BUA1F8,Ellery,"[0, 0]","I remember in the late 1980s,Nickleodean would air back-to-back episodes of Dennis The Menace on Saturday afternoons. I began taping and saving these episodes thinking that this may be the last chance to archive these shows.As it turned out it would be the last time these shows were broadcast for many years,so I was very glad I had my 4 VHS tapes of Dennis.I still have those tapes,but I now have 3 of the 4 seasons on DVD.I'll always remember how precious those tapes and that show were to me. I remember Dennis being there in the earliest days of my youth in the mid 1960s.Probably at about 8 AM on Channel 10 in Philadelphia.Was it on sick days ? I remember the gloomy light of early morning and that theme song with the cartoon tornado that was to represent Dennis.It's this and so much more that always takes me back to being a small boy, and what a joy it was to watch this show back then. So often I wish that these shows,along with Leave It To Beaver,could have been rerun on Sunday nights ,when there were never any good shows broadcast in my area.I'm now my own station manager in charge of what goes on the air on Sunday nights here at my house. This is our latest addition,Season Three of Dennis The Menace. It's the last full season for Joe Kearns as Mr. Wilson.I've learned over the years what a versatile actor Kearns was in the days of Old-Time Radio. If you're curious, please do yourself a favor and do a little on-line research on him,then play some old Jack Benny shows,with Joe playing Jack's live in security guard Ed,who lives year round in Benny's basement,guarding Jack's fortune.Or maybe play an episode of Suspense where Joe was the main &#34;tour guide&#34; to the show for many years.He was probably the busiest man in radio.How strange it was for him to be replaced,after his sudden death.by perhaps the second-busiest man in radio history, Gale Gordon. Gordon was another of my all-time favorite caracter actors.There's no need for me to analyze season three.It's just more of the same fun.The Chemistry  of Kearns and the frustrating Dennis is enough to keep us all smiling for years to come.

The episodes are wholesome and always packed with a lot of fun and mayhem. The season 3 set includes all 38 eps, in the original broadcast order on a total of 5 discs. These are the complete episodes and the video and audio quality is exceptional (Shout! always does a great job). Some of my favorite eps include the Christmas show and The Fifty-Thousandth Customer. Both Joseph Kearns and Jay North were always absolutely hysterical together. Each of the discs includes a color, silkscreen picture on it and an insert with an episode guide is also included (see scans of everything I posted). No special bonuses are offered, but at this price even Mr. Wilson would agree that it's more than worth it.

The one { 1 } thing that I Don't like to much is that they had Replaced Mr. Wilson with his brother { the Character, NOT in Real Life }, and there Wasn't anything explaining why he was Replaced, they just all of a sudden had Written Out the Original Mr. Wilson and in his place they had brought into the show his brother { in Character that is, NOT in Real Life }.  Why didn't they say that he was leaving the show because of illness, going to be with a Dying Family Member, or a Very Good and Close Friend or something like that?

I highly recommend seasons one through three.  I will get season four when it comes out, but am not sure if it will be as good as the first three seasons without Joseph Kearns and as Jay North gets older.

It's good clean show and back when times were simplier and much more ""family oriented"" as I wish it still was today. Dennis seems to get in all sorts of funny situations and I personally love the entire series as Season 3 seems to be pretty good.
