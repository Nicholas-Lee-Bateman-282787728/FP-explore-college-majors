I knocked one star off because the video transfer was done for speed rather than top notch quality, but if you're a Bama fan and want to replay this game, you won't be disappointed.*Spoiler* Bama still wins big. ;-)This was a great game and a satisfying culmination of the season for fans who hurt over the previous year's loss to Florida.Note that I did not see the same problems the April 8th reviewer noted. I'm thinking that he either received a bad DVD or has player problems.",4,A solid game film,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,519,"['CBS', 'coverage', 'game', 'knocked', 'one', 'star', 'video', 'transfer', 'was', 'done', 'speed', 'rather', 'top', 'notch', 'quality', ""'re"", 'Bama', 'fan', 'want', 'replay', 'game', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', '*Spoiler*', 'Bama', 'still', 'big', 'was', 'great', 'game', 'satisfying', 'culmination', 'season', 'fans', 'who', 'hurt', 'previous', 'year', 'loss', 'Florida.Note', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'same', 'problems', 'April', '8th', 'reviewer', 'noted', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'either', 'received', 'bad', 'DVD', 'player', 'problems']",2009 SEC Championship: Alabama Crimson Tide Vs.

I read the reviews and even though I was happy that there was a DVD of the game available, the reviews made me nervous.  So I took the chance and bought it.  This is what I discovered...1) According to a few of the Reviews the DVD was poor quality and was not worth buying.* I found that to be untrue with MY copy of the DVD.  It wasn't HD quality but for me that doesn't matter.  It is just like watching it in 'real time' without the commercials.... (The commentators are still just as annoying....) :)2) As I said it doesn't appear to be in HD....  but it is the SEC Championship game.... Do you really care if it is in HD?So for a die hard Alabama Fan.... (like myself)... who wants to replaythe glorious victory over the once #1 ranked Gators.... this is a great way to see the game again and again....Roll Tide!",5,Great Game!

I can tell you and these people, the one on August 29th review and April 8th review, YOU ARE NOT TRUE CRIMSON TIDE FANS!!!! It was just like or even a little better than watching these replays on regular TV when they have, THe Greaest SEC replays. These usually come on during August of every year on my local ABC affiliate. This DVD is a lot clearer than those replays.
