The only downside is that the video quality of the first four seasons was geared for standard definition televisions and looks rather pixelly on a large screen. Still a compelling purchase, one that I intend to make. If the series is ever released in high definition I will buy it all over again.Update 8-16-2012I just watched the first episode of season 5 and I must say I am impressed. The picture quality appears to be much improved over the first four seasons. Kudos to CBS for putting so much care into this set. I am really anticipating the release of season 6 this fall and have high hopes that the rest of the seasons will follow. This set makes me wish for a re-issue of the first four seasons with comparable picture quality. I don't expect that will ever happen but it would be really nice if it does. I'm sure it won't take me long to watch the rest of this set, probably before the next season is released. This is such a good show...!!!
