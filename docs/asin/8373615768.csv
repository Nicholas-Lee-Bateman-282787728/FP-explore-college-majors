Tatie Danielle pretends to be a needy geriatric, yet she upends the lives of well-meaning family members through her misanthropic plots.

I'm not a whiz at these things, so I still don't know how to get things set up that aren't in the usual &#34;settings&#34; places.  This film was re-formatted &#34;to fit your screen&#34;, but I'm not sure what screen they had in mind---it's certainly not a modern flat screen.  People are flat topped, and walk out of scenes while still in the same room.  It's not quite as bad as &#34;Sunset Boulevard&#34; where everyone is stretched sideways and looks like they're on the Wicked Witch's TV screen, but it's not a good adaptation.The movie, on the other hand, is as good as I remember it.  Too bad we can't get a good modern US copy.  Subtitles are white but well placed and readable.  The French translation seems to be a bit better also---I remember the dog Gardez Vous being translated on VHS as &#34;Onyourmark&#34;, here his name is more close to the original intent.  Tatie Danielle is as nasty and as selfish as ever.  Her Parisian nephew and family are perfect if baffled foils for her miserable behavior, until they go away on vacation and leave her with a woman every bit as selfish as she is.For folks who like foreign films, and comedies, this one holds up well.",4,"Dark Comedy, Well Done.

It is French cinema at its best, couldn't have been made here.  We are so programmed to think of old people as being nice, it's so refreshing to see a mean old b-tch who hates and uses her family.  However, what goes around, comes around, and she indeed has her eyes opened by a beautiful young caregiver.  I've had 2 copies of this for many years; people either loved it (as do I) or hated it.

With the impending thoughts that this is what our mother would turn into someday.  Thankfully, 20 years later?  We have things like oxycontin and xanix.  Ever wonder why people become addicted to their prescription meds and die?  It's because no one likes anyone who's mean. Really, it's better they have medication...Tatie Danielle is manipulative, a trouble-maker.  She feigns to be dependent in her illness, sneaking and lurking around behind the scenes every chance she gets.  And she also gets a private charge out of hurting other people!  (This is what people do when they don't like themselves.)The theme of this movie is psychological, satirical observation.  We get to witness Tatie, able to screw around, mess with people's heads, constantly hitting them under the belt and using her moods and financial leverage to control people's lives.  And people kow-tow to her...  Because she has a house, some money left from the death of her husband, and her pension.  She gets away with a lot of bad behavior just because she can! Casually watching her own house-sitter fall to her death, you can't help but wonder - what had Tatie's marriage been like?!  But that's just the beginning...

It kind of has a NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION meets VERY BAD THINGS vibe. (end of review) I'm giving this 5 stars because I laughed so hard, yes. Because it's well put together, yes. Because the actors all play their parts perfectly, sure. But let's be honest; I gave this 5 stars because the central character IS my grandmother to a T. Sad to say, but I couldn't possibly be more serious! Someone who will cuss you out, and try to hit you, but then scream at the top of their lungs if you even suggest something they don't like. Someone who's only joy in life is manipulating people into currying her favor. Someone who can cause other people to practically come to blows with one another because they're sick to their eye-teeth of dealing with her but can't take it out on her. A person who's only happy making others miserable, accosting strangers with rude comments, embarrassing anyone within eye shot and blaming others for the precisely devious deeds she has committed herself. Yeah. I still had mild stereotypically generalized 'American' reservation about France and it's people, until I saw this film. Any country that has the guts to put this film out and give 3 of it's actresses C&eacute;sar Awards has a clean slate in my book. Any country where the authorities would actually understand the situation, instead of laming out makes me want to move there. Heck, I might just go visit and let them abuse me for a while. I now realize, they couldn't say or do anything to me that hasn't already been done by my own blood. And I now notice this is hardly a film review... as much as a purging of emotion. I can't imagine this movie would be for anyone but the 'lucky' few (and maybe those with a healthy sense of humor), but for those who understand it could be a revelation. You're not alone.
