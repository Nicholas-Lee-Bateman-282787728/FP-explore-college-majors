195563,ANGH6401L9Y0T,1896306357,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","A spooky movie based on a true story set in New Zealand in 1880. Jody Foster plays Victoria Thompson and John Lithgow plays Oliver Thompson. The circumstances of their marriage were strange enough: John picked out Victoria from an orphanage, and the second time she even saw him was their wedding day. She asked later how he came to choose her, whether someone told him about her, but he didn't answer.Oliver was a business man, ran a string of grocery stores. His younger brother George worked for him, and was apparently quite smitten with his new sister-in-law. But Oliver was a bit of a pig. For one thing, he had holes drilled in the wall of Victoria's bedroom and watched her undress without her knowing it for some time. He was domineering and would not let her go anywhere without his servant as an escort, and was generally a loud-mouthed bully.Since the movie opens with Victoria being tried for murdering Oliver, the only mystery is whether she is innocent or guilty. Or perhaps whether she is found guilty or not by the court.The title comes from the fact that the local minister, who was a friend of theirs, was interested in mesmerism and got Victoria interested in it. One evening at dinner, he tried (not very seriously, it seemed to me) to hypnotize Oliver, but said he was too strong willed to be a good subject. He then successfully hypnotized Victoria with the greatest of ease. What became of this interest in hypnotism -- mesmerism, as it was then called -- is part of the mystery and the explanation for the title.Meanwhile the minister, the doctor, and Brother George all seem to be in love with Victoria. Well, she does look like a young Jodie Foster, after all.",4,Jodie Foster is Mesmerizing,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1687,"['spooky', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'set', 'New', 'Zealand', '1880', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'Victoria', 'Thompson', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Oliver', 'Thompson', 'circumstances', 'marriage', 'were', 'strange', 'enough', 'John', 'picked', 'out', 'Victoria', 'orphanage', 'second', 'time', 'even', 'saw', 'was', 'wedding', 'day', 'asked', 'later', 'how', 'came', 'choose', 'someone', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'answer.Oliver', 'was', 'business', 'man', 'ran', 'string', 'grocery', 'stores', 'younger', 'brother', 'George', 'worked', 'was', 'apparently', 'quite', 'smitten', 'new', 'sister-in-law', 'Oliver', 'was', 'bit', 'pig', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'holes', 'drilled', 'wall', 'Victoria', 'bedroom', 'watched', 'undress', 'knowing', 'time', 'was', 'domineering', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'anywhere', 'servant', 'escort', 'was', 'generally', 'loud-mouthed', 'bully.Since', 'movie', 'Victoria', 'being', 'tried', 'murdering', 'Oliver', 'only', 'mystery', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'perhaps', 'found', 'guilty', 'not', 'court.The', 'title', 'fact', 'local', 'minister', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'theirs', 'was', 'interested', 'mesmerism', 'got', 'Victoria', 'interested', 'One', 'evening', 'dinner', 'tried', 'not', 'very', 'seriously', 'seemed', 'hypnotize', 'Oliver', 'said', 'was', 'too', 'strong', 'willed', 'be', 'good', 'subject', 'then', 'successfully', 'hypnotized', 'Victoria', 'greatest', 'ease', 'What', 'became', 'interest', 'hypnotism', 'mesmerism', 'was', 'then', 'called', 'part', 'mystery', 'explanation', 'title.Meanwhile', 'minister', 'doctor', 'Brother', 'George', 'seem', 'be', 'love', 'Victoria', 'Well', 'look', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster']",N/A
195564,AGEWC5R7T5QLY,1896306357,"Betty Boop ""BB""","[0, 0]","It is a strange twisting plot, but the acting of Foster and Lithgow is, as usually, excellent.The main reason I bought this movie is because Lithgow is in it , and I think Foster is one of the best. The music is great, and the whole experience is bizarre.I think she did a good job for what she had to work with, which was a pretty dull script. The costuming and sets were all pretty top notch, as was most of the acting. John Lithgow, who played her husband, did a good job, in that he gave me the creeps. There was pretty good chemistry between she and her brother in law, making you believe they could have a thing goin' on.An orphaned New Zealand girl married to an older, wealthy businessman learns to deal with his strange sexual desires.There are so many problems with Mesmerized, it is difficult to decide just where to begin with them. This was a very poor screenplay with stilted dialog, zero character development & the plot drags like a stubborn mule. To sum it up, this film is dull, slow-paced and pretentious. This movie suffered from poor cinematography with dulled-out color & poor lighting. Jody Foster also served as co-producer.Whatever happened behind the scenes with Mesmerized, it is clear that Jodie Foster bears culpability for much of this film's awfulness. She gave what was quite possibly the single worst performance in her acting career thus far. Throughout the entire movie, Foster's eyes have the glazed look that is so typical of cocaine users.. This is interesting in light of the fact that in December 1983, she was arrested and charged with possession of a small amount of cocaine. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year's probation and had to pay the costs of court.I really like Jody Foster but this is her worst.

This is the flip side of Jodie Foster in her younger years as she had been put in an orphanage by her biological mother's father as an infant ""unnamed.""  The matron called her Victoria for the reigning Queen of England, and she grows into a beautiful, pensive, young lady in New Zealnd.  Out of the blue, an older, well-to-do merchant, Oliver Thompson, marries her, but she still has to stay at the orphanage not yet free (where her beauty is wasted) until she is of age.  Wehn she does go to him, a long voyage, he abuses her horribly.  She was never ""free"" as she was never ""free"" as she went from one bondage to a different kind, much worse.  It was as different as dark from light, or cold from heat.She's called Madam in her own home, but things are not what they seem.  She has her own pianoforte.  He accused her of ""putting on airs"" -- a fine lady.  His crudity makes her quite ill.  Young brother, George comforts her and it turns into true love.  They try to run away, but there is an accident and she is the dummy who will be held responsible.  FAther and son consired to keep her as a prisoner.  She'd told George that ""I would have died had I stayed in that house.""  However, he survived and wrote her a letter which is kept hidden from her.  When she finds it, a true-love confession about providence and ""you are always in my thoughts.""Like the oldest living Confederate widow, her much older husband takes advantage of her youth and is mean and cruel to her.  As she cares enough to give emotional support, things turn from bad to worse, and her baby is born dead because of his abusive manner toward her. She asks the priest why she didn't die, too.  I've often wondered that myself.  Oliver makes demands, distrusts her.  There appears a hypnonotist her like Terrence Weber in ""Born Yesterday"" who hyponotizes her and she is completely mesmerized and looked like a porcelian doll with those staring blue eyes.  He uses emotional abuse and she fights back by putting chloroform in his milk occasionally so that  he will fall asleep.  He had castigated her about not showing respect for old age.The eyes and the hands of the devil are everywhere.  The priest encouraged her to divorce, as she has ""a long life ahead of you.""  The priest vanishes as soon as she is arrested for the murder of her husband.  The new doctor, Finch, makes house calls and finds mercury poisoning which attacks the liver.  He is told that it was from pesticides.  ""Your life is more important surely.""  He has no suspension of purposeful poisoning.  Oliver at the end is hysterical and suffers with his throat.  He'd been told that the state of his illness was not serious and he was fit as a fiddle.His father accuese her of killing his son; after she is arrested she writes to George in Australia.  It was perceived that she had been spooked by supernatural forces, but the trial is held and the housekeeper testified against her.

Fact is, I understood the story,  making it utterly real.  John Lithgow was superb in his role, and Jodie Foster portrayed the character as numb - the only way a young girl would cope with a situation such as Victoria found herself.  The editing left a few holes but hey, the acting was fine with two excellent figures doing their best.  I would like to have read a book with more details, because it was a fascinating character study, though I still haven't taken enough showers to get the goo off me.  At the same time, it was creepy enough to hold my attention throughout the film, proving in my mind that it was a good story.

It is based upon the Victoria Thompson murder trial that took place in New Zealand during the late nineteenth century. Victoria is raised is some sort of orphanage from birth. At the age of seventeen, it is arranged for her to marry Mr. Thompson, a weird, older man whom she has never before met. She dutifully marries him, and when she comes of age goes to live with him in his home, which is run by his two creepy servants. Victoria soon discovers just how weird her husband really is. She ultimately takes the bull by the horns and finds herself standing trial for his murder by the time she is nineteen years old.Jodie Foster places the role of Victoria Thompson, as if she were doing so under duress. She takes a character that is potentially sympathetic and makes her merely pathetic, leaving the viewer cold. John Lithgow fares somewhat better, as he does a credible job playing the weird Mr. Thompson, doing the best he can with the material with which he has to work. The film, unfortunately, is choppy and poorly edited, the story so muddled as to be nearly incomprehensible. The direction seems to be almost nonexistent, as it looks like it is every man for himself.This film was originally released under the title, ""Mesmerized"". Word about the film must have traveled fast, as bad news so often does. When the film was released for the home market, it was retitled as ""Shocked"". So, now it has been released again, this time under its original screen name. The only thing shocking about this film is that it was ever released in the first place. It is a complete travesty.
