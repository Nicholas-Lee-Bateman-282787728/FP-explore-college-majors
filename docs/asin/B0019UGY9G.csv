I was very surprised that my friend had not heard of it, and so I got it for her for Christmas this year.  She liked it as much as I had hoped she would, especially the little boy's acting at the end.  I still remembered all the details that had so impressed me all those years ago, perhaps because, not only was the story a very plausible one, but besides the little boy, it was very well acted by Martin Sheen and Blythe Danner, two lead actors whose work I admire.  I would definitely recommend this movie.",5,This was a gift for a friend,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,585,"['loved', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Child', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'friend', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'so', 'got', 'Christmas', 'year', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'especially', 'little', 'boy', 'acting', 'end', 'still', 'remembered', 'details', 'had', 'so', 'impressed', 'years', 'ago', 'perhaps', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'story', 'very', 'plausible', 'one', 'little', 'boy', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'work', 'admire', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie']",Man Woman & Child

1164724,A1P2DHHCZ3K6JP,B0019UGY9G,O. B. Tryggvason,"[1, 1]","Sheen discovers that an affair some ten years ago resulted in a child. When the boy's mother dies, Sheen must admit his adultery and get to know the son he never knew he had.Blythe Danner gives a superb performance as Sheen's wife, both incredibly sympathetic and believable in her actions. Sheen doesn't fare as well, playing a rather one-note and not all that likable character. Young Sebastian Duncan does remarkably well in his poorly written role as the youngster who's life changes drastically.Overall; ""Man, Woman and Child"" is an OK tearjerker. The supporting cast is great with ""Coach"" himself Craig T. Nelson playing a sports fanatic (what else!) and the criminally underrated David Hemmings pops up in two scenes. Rather silly and overly sentimental scenes (particularly near the end) hurt the film and while it's never boring, it never quite takes off the way it should.The music is great, though.",2,OK tearjerker,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,909,"['Sheen', 'discovers', 'affair', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'resulted', 'child', 'When', 'boy', 'mother', 'dies', 'Sheen', 'must', 'admit', 'adultery', 'get', 'know', 'son', 'never', 'knew', 'had.Blythe', 'Danner', 'superb', 'performance', 'Sheen', 'wife', 'incredibly', 'sympathetic', 'believable', 'actions', 'Sheen', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'rather', 'one-note', 'not', 'likable', 'character', 'Young', 'Sebastian', 'Duncan', 'remarkably', 'well', 'poorly', 'written', 'role', 'youngster', 'who', 'life', 'changes', 'drastically.Overall', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Child', 'OK', 'tearjerker', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'Coach', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'playing', 'sports', 'fanatic', 'what', 'else', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'up', 'two', 'scenes', 'Rather', 'silly', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'end', 'hurt', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'never', 'quite', 'way', 'should.The', 'music', 'great', 'though']",Man Woman & Child
1164725,A2GRDEM5D6OTCD,B0019UGY9G,Richard Behmer,"[1, 1]",This movie goes back many years but still manages to hold together in content and emotional tugging of the heart. Relationship movies are always interesting to me and this is no exception. Martin Sheen gives a marvelous performance as a man who's past suddenly catches up with him. The turmoil that this long-married couple must endure takes the viewer through a realistic situation that could happen to anyone; and probably has to many. The ending is both heartbreaking and uplifting and I think this movie should have done much better than it did when released. Watch it some day and you will see.,4,Very good story,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,599,"['movie', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'still', 'hold', 'together', 'content', 'emotional', 'tugging', 'heart', 'Relationship', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'interesting', 'exception', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'past', 'suddenly', 'up', 'turmoil', 'long-married', 'couple', 'must', 'endure', 'viewer', 'realistic', 'situation', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'probably', 'many', 'ending', 'heartbreaking', 'uplifting', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'released', 'Watch', 'day', 'will', 'see']",Man Woman & Child
1164726,A1KMYEXWGIPFWF,B0019UGY9G,shadowmaster,"[1, 1]","I watched this sad and heart moving movie on betamax video when I was 13 years old with my mom. My mom cried and I followed. I have seen this movie countless times and can't keep hold of my emotion particularly the last scene with Martin Sheen's son. A unique love story, drama and family movie about Martin's extra marital affair during his brief visit to France. Martin as always is in his prime a dashing man who had a one night love affair with a French doctor who is totally attracted to him. After 8 years Martin received a call that this woman passed away leaving a boy unbeknownst to him that he had sired a child with her. Martin decided to have the child come over to America with his wife only aware and keeping the secret to their 8 and 9 year old daughters. Martin is gradually paving his son's assimilation to his American family and this is where the plot thickens and the conflict starts until the painful climactic revelation of the truth. I dare anyone who is not hard enough as a stone not to break down on the last scene. A good movie but with a sad ending and a moral lesson.",5,Man woman & ready your hanky,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1096,"['watched', 'sad', 'heart', 'moving', 'movie', 'betamax', 'video', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', 'mom', 'mom', 'cried', 'followed', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'countless', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hold', 'emotion', 'particularly', 'last', 'scene', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'son', 'unique', 'love', 'story', 'drama', 'family', 'movie', 'Martin', 'extra', 'marital', 'affair', 'brief', 'visit', 'France', 'Martin', 'always', 'prime', 'dashing', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'night', 'love', 'affair', 'French', 'doctor', 'who', 'totally', 'attracted', '8', 'years', 'Martin', 'received', 'call', 'woman', 'passed', 'away', 'leaving', 'boy', 'unbeknownst', 'had', 'sired', 'child', 'Martin', 'decided', 'have', 'child', 'come', 'America', 'wife', 'only', 'aware', 'keeping', 'secret', '8', '9', 'year', 'old', 'daughters', 'Martin', 'gradually', 'paving', 'son', 'assimilation', 'American', 'family', 'where', 'plot', 'thickens', 'conflict', 'painful', 'climactic', 'revelation', 'truth', 'dare', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'stone', 'not', 'break', 'down', 'last', 'scene', 'good', 'movie', 'sad', 'ending', 'moral', 'lesson']",Man Woman & Child
