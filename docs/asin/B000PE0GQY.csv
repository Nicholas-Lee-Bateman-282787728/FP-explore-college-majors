However, I have some bones to pick.I did not like seeing an elderly man (Lou Gosset) with an earring. That was not cute. An old man should set a good example of being dignified. It's like my daddy wearing an earring. That is the problem you have the elderly men trying to relive their youth, and setting bad examples for young males.Church scene was culturally inaccurate. 95% of the women in the audience did not have a hat on their head. This doesn't exist in a real black church. Hats are church sistah's crown and glory. No woman over the age of 18 would dare come to the church without a hat.Monty was not properly dressed for a traditional black church congregation. He should have had a classic suit. In the funeral scene, he wore a dark suit. Why not keep the costuming culturally accurate and consistent with the church scene.I did not like the comment ""you are going to need God and two white people."" It suggests that whites are God, and if they don't come to your aid, you are up the creek without a paddle. Also, there are some historical truths to this comment.The movie ended abruptly. The ending was bad. I feel that the movie should have been about 20 minutes longer. Monty and Julia's are portrayed as going off into the sunset and everything will be alright. These are two very different types of people. I am absolutely a fan of Tyler's, but he is not the best story teller and should enlist the help of one.I appreciated the story line focusing on the plight of educated women finding a good, normal and productive man. It is a real challenge. I feel for my sistahs.  However, I feel that the story line is not realistic.  I have the sneaking suspicion that Tyler is subliminally encouraging accomplished black women to take on losers.  What can this man offer this woman other than a good role in the hay?  He is uneducated, barely able to survive, and has three children.  A woman like the character is absolutely getting the short in of the stick.

I think Tyler Perry was reading a few back issues of Essence magazine and was inspired to write the film. The plot was predictable and almost every character was a walking stereotype.

While I would have to say this movie was ""ok"" it certainly was not my favorite Tyler Perry production.  I found it to be unrealistic to the point of annoyance; case in point no child services on the planet would hand over children to a mother living with a drug dealer and one who so obviously displays temper issues and questionable behavior, in addition a school principal hearing and witnessing this behavior would most certainly have to report it.  The storyline of Monty being a convicted rapist who was freed and his conviction reversed was an unnecessary complication which further added to the problem of unrealistic situations.  The ending was totally predictable.  On the plus side the acting was well executed and the dynamic of the neighborhood coming together to turn things around was inspiring.

""Daddy's Little Girls"" should expose the horrors that gang activity brings upon communities; the foolishness of class envy and ridicule; and the need for men and women to treat each other with respect at all times.  Yet, I wonder if some people didn't watch this movie and go right back to doing things the wrong way.  I'm sure I'll meet up with someone in a few days who saw this movie and didn't even realize it had a message in it.It is hard to rate a movie like this anything but 5 stars.  The message was fantastic, the acting on par with any other movie made recently, and the plot flowed together amazingly well.As far as I'm concerned Idris Elba is one heck of an actor.  He is virtually flawless in his role as Monty, a man determined to do what's right when nothing in his life is headed in the right direction.  I knew very little about Elba before watching this movie.  Now I know that Hollywood, Independent film makers, and even Bollywood would be making a big mistake if they didn't make place this man in more leading roles.Gabrielle Union is excellent as Julia, a Ivy League Lawyer who wins all her cases but lacks the street skills to get along with the little people.  Union is beautiful, knows how to deliver a line, and is just a complete joy to watch on screen.  Combining Elba and Union on screen was a perfect match.  How could anyone help but root for these two to be successful in the end?Louis Gossett Jr., man has this guy been in some films or what?  His filmography page goes back to the 1950s!  What an amazing career.  He is a great addition to this film as Willie, the garage owner where Monty works on cars and dreams of one day being the owner.  His character is a little one dimensional but he still has what it takes to deliver those ""You better get your butts in gear"" message.  I will forever believe that his performance in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was one of the best performances ever, by anyone.Tasha Smith plays Jennifer, Monty's evil-EX and mother to the little girls.  She did a great job being evil.  I know this because I found myself wanting to reach through my television screen and slap her!

Granted there were a few errors in the movie that liberal critics will point out but like Perry's previous films, Daddy's Little Girls isn't a movie for the critics. Gabrielle Union is good as always as she kind of brought the same vibe into the female lead Julia that she did to the title character in Deliver Us From Eva. Idris Elba as Monty played the romantic lead very well  by turning Monty into the type of character whose struggle you can empathize with and I hope he gets more lead roles in the future as he played the good guy role very in the film. The chemistry between the two of them is strong enough to make their scenes together work. The film wasn't as funny as Perry's previous work but then the message that Perry was trying to convey was didn't really need any cheap laughs.  My only compliant with the film was it did drag a bit in some parts, but the climax and conclusion more than make up for it.

His only help is his ex's mother, whose terminally ill; before she dies, she tells Monty he should take the girls instead of their mother, a hustler living with the neighborhood, drug dealer.  Backed by her boyfriend's drug money, the girl's mom is able to win custody.Enter Julia: a successful attorney with plenty of attitude.  She meets Monty during his short stint as her driver.  First impressions are taken, and their relationship starts off rough, but soon enough they fall for one another.  Now, Julia has the power and the will to get Monty's daughters back.The acting was a little shaky, the only aspect of the movie I wasn't too keen on.  Gabrielle Union was the biggest weak link in this movie; her acting was too theatrical for Hollywood and came off cheesy.  Idris Elba was excellent as Monty, the most convincing role in the whole movie.  But the three girls - Sierra, China, and Lauryn McClain - were cute and fit their children roles.I will admit it was refreshing to see a movie with a single father who's the hero.

He doesn't get into drag and play Madea in this movie -- in fact, he doesn't appear onscreen at all (unless he had an unaccredited cameo where I didn't recognize him). The final product remains representative of the writer/director/producer's abilities and his common themes of the power of family and how much a community can accomplish when they band together. ""Daddy's Little Girls"" has its funny moments, but overall it's fairly somber from the start.The movie's opening scene is a montage of people of different ages on a city street, with children playing and men cooking dinner on the grill and women chit-chatting, showing the good aspects of a close-knit neighborhood. Later in the film, Willie stands up in a community meeting with police and politicians and tells his neighbors that the police and government have never and will never do anything to help them, and they all have to band together to help themselves. Perry grew up in New Orleans, and wondered if this scene was meant to reflect his feelings about the poor handling of post-Katrina rebuilding by, well, by damn near everyone except the residents themselves.The one benefit of Julia (Gabrielle Union) and Monty's (Idris Elba) relationship is that it allows the story to branch out to wax philosophical about one more conflict: class. Julia's friends are not the kind to be amused or in favor of a relationship between a successful legal partner and a struggling auto-mechanic. The snobbery allows the movie to take on some of the all-too-frequent stereotypes that are automatically applied to black men, particularly ideas about being a ""baby's daddy"" or forty-year-olds in over-sized jerseys. Monty breaks all of these stereotypes as a caring, responsible adult who is still struggling through life despite those character traits. It's nice to see this kind of positive role model portrayed strongly on screen instead of reinforcing negative ideas.Parts of ""Daddy's Little Girls"" may be predictable and convenient as the movie tells its tale but there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. The film is one of those ubiquitous ""feel good movies"" and as such it does its job well. When the final credits roll you'll feel good and maybe, through the film's attempts to challenge a few negative stereotypes, even feel a little better about the human race's ability to come together in moments of adversity. You'll laugh; probably tear a little; and most importantly feel good.

Once again this becomes another film where the trailer does not truly do it justice. Idris Elba plays Monty James who is a hard working single Dad. Monty has three little girls, China (China Anne McClain) Lauryn (Lauryn Alisa McClain) and Sierra (Sierra Aylina McClain) who all are also sisters in real life. Monty comes home from work only to find out that his daughter's grandmother on their mother's side who babysits for him is dying from lung cancer. She explains to Monty that she wants him to take full custody of the children. Now this is when we're are introduced to the girl's mom Jennifer (Tasha Smith). You know she must be bad when her own mother doesn't even want her to have her own children.Jennifer has found happiness living with her new drug-dealing boyfriend Joe (Gary Anthony Sturgis) who is breaking down the neighborhood little by little. Every time the cops get hold of him he just beats court with his big time lawyer. Jennifer who has this power because of Joe is focused on breaking Monty's pride and heart by taking what he loves most from him, his daughters. Jennifer gets custody of the girls because of a fire while he was working. While in her custody Jennifer tries to make the girls into little hustlers telling them that nothing in life is free. Monty ends up driving when he's not being a mechanic to make extra money so he can buy an auto shop from his boss Willie. Now he must save the money to be able to afford a lawyer to get his kids back.Monty meets Julia Rossmore (Gabrielle Union) who is partner of a firm but is very mean. She's trying to find a boyfriend but is mad because she can't find a descent one. Monty just happens to end up driving for her and well you'll have to see the movie to find out the rest. The first and major point of this film is the amazing writing coming from Tyler Perry. The story is too good for words, he really put a lot into this and it turned out great. The dialogue is also on point, he new the right words to give his actors at the perfect time. The casting was hot; every actor played their characters with so much emotion and realness.Gabrielle Union and Idris Elba might be the two names that stick out the most but everybody killed their roles especially the little girls who you felt for the entire time. Those three sisters have a bright future ahead of them and if they stick with Perry like they have they will go far. There was comedy but it was put in the right spots in the movie, the pacing was perfect and when it came time for music that was added right. The music played a nice part and was selected well.

1070303,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000PE0GQY,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 13]","**1/2No one could ever accuse Tyler Perry of being the soul of subtlety - either as a filmmaker or as a storyteller.  His set-ups are often painfully contrived, with characters who are two-dimensional and stereotypical, and messages that are pat and overly simplistic, to put it mildly.  Yet, in this era when too many black characters are either rappers, street thugs, prostitutes or drug dealers, Perry speaks to audiences yearning to see a more positive vision of the African-American experience portrayed on screen.  That's certainly an admirable goal, but the problem is that Perry himself is not above indulging in many of those very same stereotypes if, in so doing, it helps him to get his message across.In ""Daddy's Little Girls,"" the first ethnic stereotype Perry admirably endeavors to shatter is that of the absent or indifferent urban black father.  His protagonist, Monty, is a divorced dad of three who works as an auto mechanic in a garage run by none other than Louis Gossett Jr.  Monty's ex has pretty much flown the coop, leaving the kids to be raised by her mother who is currently dying of lung cancer.  After the woman's death, Jennifer decides she now wants to raise the children, even though she's living with a gangsta' boyfriend who's so low he even sells drugs to the kids in the neighborhood schoolyard.  This sets up a fierce custody battle between Monty and Jennifer with the three girls caught in the middle.As stated previously, it is commendable that Perry wishes to make Monty a model for young male viewers to emulate, but in order to establish Monty's bona fides as a caring father, the filmmaker for some reason has found it necessary to ratchet up the mother's vileness past the point of believability.  In fact,  Jennifer makes Cinderella's evil stepmother look like June Cleaver and Carol Brady in comparison.  Indeed, she is so over-the-top in her villainy that one wonders how such a seemingly level-headed and sweet-tempered soul as Marty could ever have been fooled into marrying her in the first place.Perry doesn't do much better with the main female character, a snooty, high-priced African-American lawyer named Julia, who looks down her nose on poor working-class stiffs like Monty who takes a position as her much-abused chauffeur in order to make a little money on the side.  Monty soon discovers that all the over-stressed Julia needs is a good man to bring meaning to her sterile, empty life.  Thus, with the character of Julia, Perry manages to insult blacks, career women and specifically black career women in one fell swoop.The movie makes some interesting points about the role class consciousness plays in the black community, with wealthy blacks sometimes more dismissive of their less well-off counterparts than are wealthy whites.  Unfortunately, this theme is played out in the context of a fairly formulaic romance between Monty and Julia, with the ""little girls"" of the title reduced to not much more than walk-on roles in the story.  Idris Elba is appealing and solid as the sincere, hardworking Monty, while Gabrielle Union does what she can with the poorly written part of Julia.The narrative also suffers from what first-year screenwriting students (or ""Crash"" deriders) like to refer to as ""coincidence overload,"" with characters bumping into one another at all-too-convenient moments or just happening to learn crucial bits of information from news stories on TV.""Daddy's Little Girls"" starts off with the best of intentions, and there are certainly some poignant, touching moments to be found in the film, but the movie is so fixated on pandering to the emotions of its audience, especially in the melodramatic final reel, that most of the goodwill one brings to the project has pretty much evaporated by the time the closing credits come rolling by.",2,"Noble intentions, weak execution",1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,3822,"['**1/2No', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'accuse', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'being', 'soul', 'subtlety', 'filmmaker', 'storyteller', 'set-ups', 'are', 'often', 'painfully', 'contrived', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'stereotypical', 'messages', 'are', 'pat', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'put', 'mildly', 'era', 'when', 'too', 'many', 'black', 'characters', 'are', 'rappers', 'street', 'thugs', 'prostitutes', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Perry', 'audiences', 'yearning', 'see', 'more', 'positive', 'vision', 'African-American', 'experience', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'certainly', 'admirable', 'goal', 'problem', 'Perry', 'not', 'indulging', 'many', 'very', 'same', 'stereotypes', 'so', 'doing', 'get', 'message', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'first', 'ethnic', 'stereotype', 'Perry', 'admirably', 'endeavors', 'shatter', 'absent', 'indifferent', 'urban', 'black', 'father', 'protagonist', 'Monty', 'divorced', 'dad', 'three', 'who', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'garage', 'run', 'none', 'other', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Monty', 'ex', 'pretty', 'much', 'coop', 'leaving', 'kids', 'be', 'raised', 'mother', 'who', 'currently', 'dying', 'lung', 'cancer', 'woman', 'death', 'Jennifer', 'now', 'raise', 'children', 'even', 'living', 'gangsta', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'so', 'low', 'even', 'drugs', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'schoolyard', 'up', 'fierce', 'custody', 'battle', 'Monty', 'Jennifer', 'three', 'girls', 'caught', 'middle.As', 'stated', 'previously', 'commendable', 'Perry', 'make', 'Monty', 'model', 'young', 'male', 'viewers', 'emulate', 'order', 'establish', 'Monty', 'bona', 'caring', 'father', 'filmmaker', 'reason', 'found', 'necessary', 'ratchet', 'up', 'mother', 'vileness', 'point', 'believability', 'fact', 'Jennifer', 'Cinderella', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'look', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'Carol', 'Brady', 'comparison', 'Indeed', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'villainy', 'one', 'how', 'such', 'seemingly', 'level-headed', 'sweet-tempered', 'soul', 'Marty', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'fooled', 'marrying', 'first', 'place.Perry', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'snooty', 'high-priced', 'African-American', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Julia', 'who', 'down', 'nose', 'poor', 'working-class', 'stiffs', 'Monty', 'who', 'position', 'much-abused', 'chauffeur', 'order', 'make', 'little', 'money', 'side', 'Monty', 'soon', 'over-stressed', 'Julia', 'good', 'man', 'bring', 'meaning', 'sterile', 'empty', 'life', 'Thus', 'character', 'Julia', 'Perry', 'insult', 'blacks', 'career', 'women', 'specifically', 'black', 'career', 'women', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'points', 'role', 'class', 'consciousness', 'plays', 'black', 'community', 'wealthy', 'blacks', 'sometimes', 'more', 'dismissive', 'less', 'well-off', 'counterparts', 'are', 'wealthy', 'whites', 'Unfortunately', 'theme', 'played', 'out', 'context', 'fairly', 'formulaic', 'romance', 'Monty', 'Julia', 'little', 'girls', 'title', 'reduced', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'walk-on', 'roles', 'story', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'appealing', 'solid', 'sincere', 'hardworking', 'Monty', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'what', 'can', 'poorly', 'written', 'part', 'Julia.The', 'narrative', 'also', 'what', 'first-year', 'screenwriting', 'students', 'Crash', 'deriders', 'refer', 'coincidence', 'overload', 'characters', 'bumping', 'one', 'all-too-convenient', 'moments', 'just', 'happening', 'learn', 'crucial', 'bits', 'information', 'news', 'stories', 'TV', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'best', 'intentions', 'are', 'certainly', 'poignant', 'touching', 'moments', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'movie', 'so', 'fixated', 'pandering', 'emotions', 'audience', 'especially', 'melodramatic', 'final', 'reel', 'most', 'goodwill', 'one', 'project', 'pretty', 'much', 'evaporated', 'time', 'closing', 'come', 'rolling']",N/A

I'll even buy extra tickets just to boost the numbers, so that should tell you something right there ;)That said, I'm always disappointed in some of the elements in his movies (just a teensy FEW & never EVER enough to spoil my overall enjoyment), but, then again, I always love, love, love how nitty-gritty REAL all his characters are &, let's face it folks:People (even Christians) really do these things (even wrong & immoral things), whether we like it, or not, & I know that Perry doesn't endorse immorality, he's just keepin' it REAL.And so it's for that reason I can forgive all the Sex-In-The-City-ness of the movie (which is not a show I've ever seen -- since I don't watch TV -- but I read some other reviews that mentioned the similarities & so that's where I'm getting my information), since, apparently, (because of that show), hopelessly vain, empty & immoral career women are considered the new ""normal""?But because I'm NOT interested so much in how sinful everyone in the movie is (I mean, hello? aren't we ALL? Romans 3:23), but rather about how they FIND REDEMPTION in the end ...Which is what a Tyler Perry movie is all about.And so I found the dad's struggles -- as well as the struggles of his extended family & community -- EXTREMELY moving & compelling (to say the least!) & therefore worth watching ...And ESPECIALLY since you don't see many movies these days with such a strong father-figure ...And it's about time! \o/(Although, in one of those strange, magical, mystical & unexplainable moments of synchronicity, I went to see ""Bridge To Terabithia"" the very next day -- which ALSO features an incredibly strong father-figure [who is not the main character] -- but the unexpected coincidence made me think that perhaps we are entering a new era: The Age of the DAD flick.)But, back to the movie, the OTHER reason I will go see any Tyler Perry movie (any time, any where, no questions asked, plus extra tickets) is because, in all his movies, there is ALWAYS at least one spiritual ""gotcha"" that stays with me as I leave the theatre ...And, in this movie (without giving anything away), one of those ""gotchas"" was said by the pastor (during his sermon) & the other was said by Aunt Rita (in passing) ...So, for me, it's the ""take away"" factor (i.e. something inspirational that I can [& do] apply to my personal life) that makes a Tyler Perry movie worth its weight in gold.And to the critics who objected to the movie's ending, I say this:""You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face. To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that!"" -- 2 Corinthians 11:19-21And, like Paul, I am being facetious, because NO ONE should put up with abuse. Not at home. Not at school. Not at work. Not in church. Not here. Not now. Not ever. Amen.And for THAT reason, this is a GREAT movie, ending & all \o/",5,"""Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."" -- James 4:7",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,3184,"['First', 'am', 'die-hard', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'first-run', 'movies', 'time', 'where', 'questions', 'asked', 'price', 'too', 'high', 'premise', 'too', 'low', 'just', 'send', 'e-mail', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', ""'ll"", 'even', 'buy', 'extra', 'tickets', 'just', 'boost', 'numbers', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'right', 'there', 'said', ""'m"", 'always', 'disappointed', 'elements', 'movies', 'just', 'teensy', 'FEW', 'never', 'EVER', 'enough', 'spoil', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'then', 'again', 'always', 'love', 'love', 'love', 'how', 'nitty-gritty', 'REAL', 'characters', 'are', 'let', 'face', 'People', 'even', 'Christians', 'really', 'do', 'things', 'even', 'wrong', 'immoral', 'things', 'like', 'not', 'know', 'Perry', ""n't"", 'endorse', 'immorality', 'just', 'keepin', 'REAL.And', 'reason', 'can', 'forgive', 'Sex-In-The-City-ness', 'movie', 'not', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'TV', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'mentioned', 'similarities', 'so', 'where', ""'m"", 'getting', 'information', 'apparently', 'show', 'hopelessly', 'vain', 'empty', 'immoral', 'career', 'women', 'are', 'considered', 'new', 'normal', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'interested', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'sinful', 'everyone', 'movie', 'mean', 'hello', 'are', ""n't"", 'ALL', 'Romans', '3:23', 'rather', 'how', 'FIND', 'REDEMPTION', 'end', 'Which', 'what', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'so', 'found', 'dad', 'struggles', 'as', 'well', 'struggles', 'extended', 'family', 'community', 'EXTREMELY', 'moving', 'compelling', 'say', 'least', 'therefore', 'worth', 'watching', 'ESPECIALLY', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'such', 'strong', 'father-figure', 'time', '\\o/', 'one', 'strange', 'magical', 'mystical', 'unexplainable', 'moments', 'synchronicity', 'went', 'see', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'ALSO', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'father-figure', '[', 'who', 'not', 'main', 'character', ']', 'unexpected', 'coincidence', 'made', 'think', 'perhaps', 'are', 'entering', 'new', 'era', 'Age', 'DAD', 'flick', 'back', 'movie', 'OTHER', 'reason', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'time', 'where', 'questions', 'asked', 'extra', 'tickets', 'movies', 'ALWAYS', 'least', 'one', 'spiritual', 'gotcha', 'leave', 'theatre', 'movie', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'one', 'gotchas', 'was', 'said', 'pastor', 'sermon', 'other', 'was', 'said', 'Aunt', 'Rita', 'passing', 'So', 'take', 'away', 'factor', 'i.e', 'something', 'inspirational', 'can', '[', 'do', ']', 'apply', 'personal', 'life', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'worth', 'weight', 'gold.And', 'critics', 'who', 'objected', 'movie', 'ending', 'say', 'gladly', 'put', 'up', 'fools', 'are', 'so', 'wise', 'fact', 'even', 'put', 'up', 'anyone', 'who', 'exploits', 'advantage', 'pushes', 'forward', 'slaps', 'face', 'shame', 'admit', 'were', 'too', 'weak', '2', 'Corinthians', '11:19-21And', 'Paul', 'am', 'being', 'facetious', 'ONE', 'should', 'put', 'up', 'abuse', 'Not', 'home', 'Not', 'school', 'Not', 'work', 'Not', 'church', 'Not', 'here', 'Not', 'now', 'Not', 'ever', 'Amen.And', 'THAT', 'reason', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'ending', '\\o/']",N/A
1070307,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000PE0GQY,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 1]","Pros:  At the end of this movie, I was so salty that there wasn't more.  I was entertained throughout and once again, Tyler Perry has created a masterpiece. I love the way he takes on controversial topics and creates believable tales that so many people can relate to.  In this movie, we learn about a father who was imprisoned in the past and is now trying to do right for his children and himself. Of course there are obstacles, like his trifling wife who thinks money and the street life make the best men; a thug who likes to ridicule anyone who isn't on the same grind that he is; child custody; an ill mother; and an outstandingly snobbish lawyer who he has been hired to drive around to make ends meet outside of his job as a mechanic.  When I saw the previews for this movie, I was thinking ""Oh my gawd.  Gabrielle Union is the lead in ANOTHER movie.""  I'd grown so tired of seeing her, but I LOVED her in this movie.  To all you Union fans, now I understand why y'all love her so much. She was excellent.  She brought out so many other sides of her acting that I'd never seen before (ex. vulnerability, elitism, comedy).  Her comedic performance had the whole audience (it was packed in that theater) holding their sides in laughter. I never knew she could be so funny.  The lead male character was so believable in his role to the point where I was wondering did he really live this life.  I also love how the casting directors picked REAL people to be the extras; people you see everyday in church, walking down the street, living in the neighborhood, etc.  I was also impressed with Tyra's friend, who plays the mother of Monty's children.  I knew she was a good acting coach, but I didn't know she was this good of an actress!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to many more.  Perry hasn't failed me yet, and I doubt he could.Cons: The guy who played the main thug was not very good at it.  He just looked like a grown, educated man trying to look hard. I wish they would've picked someone more believable to play his part.  He looked more like he should've been the lawyer who was trying to put him in jail than the actual drug dealer.",5,Is that It?,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2164,"['Pros', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'salty', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'was', 'entertained', 'once', 'again', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'created', 'masterpiece', 'love', 'way', 'controversial', 'topics', 'believable', 'tales', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'learn', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'past', 'now', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'children', 'course', 'are', 'obstacles', 'trifling', 'wife', 'who', 'money', 'street', 'life', 'make', 'best', 'men', 'thug', 'who', 'ridicule', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'same', 'grind', 'child', 'custody', 'ill', 'mother', 'outstandingly', 'snobbish', 'lawyer', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'drive', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'job', 'mechanic', 'When', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'gawd', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'lead', 'ANOTHER', 'movie', ""'d"", 'grown', 'so', 'tired', 'seeing', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'Union', 'fans', 'now', 'understand', 'why', ""y'all"", 'love', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'excellent', 'brought', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'sides', 'acting', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'ex', 'vulnerability', 'elitism', 'comedy', 'comedic', 'performance', 'had', 'whole', 'audience', 'was', 'packed', 'theater', 'holding', 'sides', 'laughter', 'never', 'knew', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'funny', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'role', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'wondering', 'did', 'really', 'live', 'life', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'casting', 'directors', 'picked', 'REAL', 'people', 'be', 'extras', 'people', 'see', 'everyday', 'church', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'living', 'neighborhood', 'etc', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Tyra', 'friend', 'who', 'mother', 'Monty', 'children', 'knew', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'coach', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'good', 'actress', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'many', 'more', 'Perry', ""n't"", 'failed', 'yet', 'doubt', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'thug', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'looked', 'grown', 'educated', 'man', 'trying', 'look', 'hard', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'someone', 'more', 'believable', 'play', 'part', 'looked', 'more', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lawyer', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'put', 'jail', 'actual', 'drug', 'dealer']",N/A

1070317,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000PE0GQY,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[13, 18]","I thought this was the weakest of all the Tyler Perry movies, my favorite being ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". I'm sorry, but a lot of it just didn't make sense to me. I wanted to love this film, knowing the premise of it, but there was just too many contradictive characters and scenarios in this movie to make it believable. However, the best part of the movie  was watching Idris Elba (""The Wire"") as Monty, who made this film watchable for me. He does a good job with the role of an attentive, hard-working black single father who truly loves his children and wants custody of them after their guardian (his ex's mother) passes away. His role drives home the point that contrary to what is widely believed about black men not giving a damn about the children they bring into this world, there are PLENTY of men like Monty out there!! It's time they got the credit that they deserve instead of being pigeon-holed as deadbeats who don't care. I have to give Tyler Perry props for attempting to dispel a stereotype in the black community by making this movie. This was the main reason why I was so anxious to see this film when it came out in the theatres. However, to truly enjoy this movie, you need to abandon any sense of reality, sensibility and logic because ""Daddy's Little Girls"" lack all three.Beyond Monty's character and the three adorable girls who portray his daughters, though, the film, the story and the other characters just don't cut it. The story isn't even about ""Daddy's Little Girls"" but everyone else around them. The performance of Tasha Smith, who plays Jennifer, Monty's ex-wife and the mother of the three girls, is so shamefully over the top (like mostly everything else in this movie) it's almost laughable. She's an uncaring, overbearing, heartless and totally ghetto-fabulous parent who only cares about bling-bling and is dating a notoriously feared neighborhood drug dealer (Gary Sturgis, who constantly plays the same type of character in different movies, and badly, I might add).  She gives Monty no respect and shows her kids no love. How in the world, you wonder, did a good-hearted man like Monty get involved with a shrew like this?? To me, it's just ridiculous that custody of these children could be granted to her when everyone and their mama in the film (including the police) knows her live-in boyfriend is a criminal. Plus, what is Jennifer's reason for wanting custody, when she shows nothing but contempt for them and really doesn't want them around? Where is Children's Protective Services in this case? Didn't they do ANY kind of investigation into the kind of household that these girls would be placed into? I'm sorry, but this is not reality.Gabrielle Union does the best she can as Julia. But her character was just too high and mighty for me to feel any kind of connection with her, not unlike most of the roles she plays. In this film, she's an uptight high-powered attorney with an acrid and condescending attitude - a typical Alpha female whose career is her life, and money and status means everything, and yes, she's been hurt in the past. Yet she complains about how she can't find a man on her level. Well, excuse us. For someone who looks down on most black men as being trifling and good for nothing - especially black men who were NOT white collar - how could she expect to find ANYONE? She was hard to sympathize with. It seemed extremely unlikely that Julia would not only agree to represent Monty in court, who clearly didn't have the funds to pay her, but end up falling for him as well. Monty is strictly a blue collar working class guy, holding down two jobs as a mechanic and a chauffeur. What in the world could they possibly have in common? Why would Julia lower her standards and settle for someone she REALLY doesn't want, just because she's lonely? It doesn't make sense that she would change her mind just like that; getting pissy drunk on her birthday being with Monty wouldn't and shouldn't have made a difference. I've noticed a pattern in most (not all, but most) of Tyler's films: good guy is a man who is just an average, working class joe, villain is the man who has power and money and abuses them both to manipulate the people around him, a woman who has been abused in some form or fashion, and don't forget to throw in an evil, vindictive female as someone's mother.Her stuck-up buppie friends (Terri J. Vaughn, Tracey Ellis Ross) are annoying and just as convoluted as the movie is. They fix her up on blind dates with losers, and for women who are as class-conscious and picky as they are, the choice of these men as ideal dates for Gabrielle's character is baffling. One is a loud, uncultured 40-year-old wannabe rapper who is ""between jobs"" and the other a charming, but cheating Lothario whose wife happens to be pregnant and has a houseful of kids - yet they have the nerve to look down on Monty, who is single, working not only one but TWO jobs and is trying to go into business for himself. Even with all this going for him, in their eyes, he wasn't good enough for their homegirl - but those other guys were??? There is something seriously WRONG with this entire picture because that concept made NO sense whatsoever. There are more holes in this script than a slice of Swiss cheese, so need I go on?Again, I have to say that I can appreciate the message Tyler Perry wanted to make with this movie, but this is just a hot mess all around. Not even the addition of the great Oscar-winning Louis Gossett, Jr. to the cast could save this. I really love TP's stage work, but this is a real comedown from what we saw in ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" and ""Madea's Family Reunion"", and I'm not just saying that because there's no Madea in this movie. The entire screenplay is just all over the place and extremely uneven. If you are a fan of Tyler's work then you will love it, but then again, I am a HUGE fan of his and I didn't. Hope his next production, ""Why Did I Get Married?"" fares a lot better.Rating: 2 1/2 stars",3,"I know most folks won't agree with me, but....",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,6010,"['thought', 'was',

You can tell that Idris and Gabrielle were feeling each other(had a mutual attraction for those who didn't get that earlier statement), and they kept it without getting into a scene and all that. i respect Tyler for that. Another thing that I took away from this was the sense of community that was there. This guy was absolutely scared to raise three girls by himself, but stepped to the plate and gave it his best shot. He made mistakes, he endured heat from others as well as those he loved, but through it all, he kept his head on and you cannot help but love Idris Elba for it.The McClain Sisters were adorable and look forward to more from them. A part of the movie I didn't care for was Tracee Ellis Ross and Terri Vaughan's roles as the judgmental,funky girlfriends who poo pooed on Julia(Gabrielle Union's role)for Monty and his life, but yet they kept hooking her up with silly, hilarious, funky trifling men. One was married to boot. I truly loved the Aquarium scene and have made a mental note to go to the Georgia Aquarium myself and admire that for myself.

But when the courts award custody of his daughters to his corrupt, drug dealing ex-wife, Monty desperately tries to win them back, enlisting the help of Julia, a beautiful and hard nosed attorney he meets during his short stint as a chauffeur. While Monty and the Ivy-League-educated Julia couldn't be less alike, an unexpected romance blossoms, and it soon begins to feel like true love. But in order for their relationship to survive, the couple must reconcile their two very different worlds, and overcome the forces that threaten to tear Monty's family apart.

The DVD release was scheduled in time for Father's Day, but the plot seemed to be centered (more) around a love-sick lady attorney who was looking for an excuse to hop into bed with the first man that she felt comfortable with, than the manner in which the father of the girls actually interacted with his daughters in times, other than dramatic-moments.  I have one other Tyler Perry Movie, and the evidence from my viewing, is that althought his work center around family, it does not represent true African American Culture.  It only reflects the thoughts that people of other races view African Americans. Those of different pursuasions no longer have to voice their opinions of us, because you can see it when you pop the DVD into the player.",2,"Daddy""s Little Girls",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,790,"['movie', 'fell', 'short', 'expectations', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'scheduled', 'time', 'Father', 'Day', 'plot', 'seemed', 'be', 'centered', 'more', 'love-sick', 'lady', 'attorney', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'excuse', 'hop', 'bed', 'first', 'man', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'manner', 'father', 'girls', 'actually', 'interacted', 'daughters', 'times', 'other', 'dramatic-moments', 'have', 'one', 'other', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Movie', 'evidence', 'viewing', 'althought', 'work', 'center', 'family', 'not', 'represent', 'true', 'African', 'American', 'Culture', 'only', 'thoughts', 'people', 'other', 'races', 'view', 'African', 'Americans', 'different', 'pursuasions', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'voice', 'opinions', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player']",N/A
