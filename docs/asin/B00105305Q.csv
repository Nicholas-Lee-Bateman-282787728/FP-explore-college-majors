Hoffman ""That Guy""","[2, 2]","I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",5,"One of the few ""non-agenda"" children's programs",1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,821,"['am', 'so', 'sick', 'programming', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'teaching', 'boy', 'want', 'get', 'down', 'tree', 'need', 'giant', 'piece', 'celery', 'slide', 'down', 'try', 'give', 'child', 'other', 'things', 'do', 'reality', 'sometimes', 'just', 'more', 'appropriate', 'let', 'watch', 'TV', 'can', 'stand', 'agenda', 'people', 'making', 'programs.Then', 'ran', 'Curious', 'George', 'were', 'relieved', 'agendas', 'politically', 'correct', 'subject', 'matter', 'illogical', 'logic', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'one', 'was', 'taking', 'shoes', 'off', 'long', 'walk', 'summer', 'day', 'aaahhhh.To', 'top', 'off', 'DVD', 'only', '10', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', '10', 'different', 'titles', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'one', 'thus', 'will', 'copy', 'paste', 'review', 'one', 'them.This', 'one', 'happy', 'dad', 'who', 'annoying', 'monkey']",Curious George: Goes to the Doctor and Lends a Helping Hand!
