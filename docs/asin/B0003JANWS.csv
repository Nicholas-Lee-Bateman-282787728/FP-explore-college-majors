Lo and behold, a little further on, Sean young's character's actually watching Vertigo on TV. Hate to say it, but the original Hitchcock's were much better.

Matt Dillon plays the perfect cold and calculating killer. Sean Young was not as bad in this movie as everyone says. but yet she wasn't perfect. Matt is the guy that made this movie good and suspenseful but i was glad when he got hit by a train at the end.The opening death scene was pretty shocking and when he found Sean Young at the mother's house i was sure she was gonna get it for sure. if you love a movie with alot of violence,supsense,and a hot sex scene then you will love this .

The original from the 50's with Robert Wagner was soo much better than this fantasy. Matt Dillon who has never been considered a serious actor, plays a psycho killer who grows up poor and wants untold riches and success. Sean Young who apparently needed money for rent appears as the one twin who Dillon throws off the roof of an office tower. Next we see Young as the ""other"" twin looking like a total butch dyke who we are supposed to believe has fallen in love with Dillon.

854794,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0003JANWS,Larry VanDeSande,"[10, 11]","This is the type of movie that separates me from most movie critics. They said this was awful, poorly directed, incompetently acted, foolishly presented and an insult to the 1956 original and book. One critic went so far as to say Sean Young played two roles (twins) which gave her the opportunity to play two roles poorly.I don't argue with any of that. My wife guessed one of the principal clues about 5 mintues into the movie. However, I have to say this movie was interesting from the opening scene and it kept me and my wife involved throughout. It may have been bad but it was effective. It had great studio values and the overly dramatic musical score gave some scenes an affect they didn't have otherwise. Its violent scenes had more of a surreal-life 1970s aura than the cliinically, computer graphic displayed overlay of a 1990s movie. It is also the first film I've ever seen where a train runs over someone (not too graphically).If you haven't seen ""A Kiss Before Dying"", the story involves a disturbed young man (Matt Dillon) who romances one sister, then her twin, (and kills a few people in the process) to gain access to her rich dad's wealth. It's taken from a popular 1950s book by Ira Levin and this is the second film treatment, the first coming in 1956 with then-young Robert Wagner in the role of the psycho.Critics everywhere lamabasted this film as being inane, overdone, sophomoric and so excessively violent it bordered on exploitation. All I can say about that is I tried to watch ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" the night before and was so bored by the silly thing I turned it off after a half-hour. Meanwhile, I stood attentive to ""A Kiss Before Dying"" to the bitter end, which I might add introduces questions not resolved during the story.Maybe this says something about my taste in movies. I'm betting it also says something about the entertainment values in films and I think there's more of it in this one than a lot of people want to admit.",3,"A thriller, not a great one, but a thriller nonetheless",1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1977,"['type', 'movie', 'most', 'movie', 'critics', 'said', 'was', 'awful', 'poorly', 'directed', 'incompetently', 'acted', 'foolishly', 'presented', 'insult', '1956', 'original', 'book', 'One', 'critic', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Sean', 'Young', 'played', 'two', 'roles', 'twins', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'play', 'two', 'roles', 'poorly.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'argue', 'wife', 'guessed', 'one', 'principal', 'clues', '5', 'mintues', 'movie', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'opening', 'scene', 'kept', 'wife', 'involved', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'was', 'effective', 'had', 'great', 'studio', 'values', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'score', 'gave', 'scenes', 'affect', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'otherwise', 'violent', 'scenes', 'had', 'more', 'surreal-life', '1970s', 'aura', 'cliinically', 'computer', 'graphic', 'displayed', 'overlay', '1990s', 'movie', 'also', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'train', 'someone', 'not', 'too', 'graphically', '.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'A', 'Kiss', 'Dying', 'story', 'disturbed', 'young', 'man', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'one', 'sister', 'then', 'twin', 'few', 'people', 'process', 'gain', 'access', 'rich', 'dad', 'wealth', 'taken', 'popular', '1950s', 'book', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'second', 'film', 'treatment', 'first', 'coming', '1956', 'then-young', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'role', 'psycho.Critics', 'everywhere', 'lamabasted', 'film', 'being', 'inane', 'overdone', 'sophomoric', 'so', 'excessively', 'violent', 'bordered', 'exploitation', 'can', 'say', 'tried', 'watch', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'night', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'silly', 'thing', 'turned', 'off', 'half-hour', 'Meanwhile', 'stood', 'attentive', 'A', 'Kiss', 'Dying', 'bitter', 'end', 'might', 'add', 'introduces', 'questions', 'not', 'resolved', 'story.Maybe', 'something', 'taste', 'movies', ""'m"", 'betting', 'also', 'something', 'entertainment', 'values', 'films', 'think', 'more', 'one', 'lot', 'people', 'want', 'admit']",N/A

It isn't a great movie, but it's fun to watch Sean Young, as the twin of a murdered young woman (killed by Matt Dillon's character), as she attempts to prove that her sister did not commit suicide.In the beginning, I especially liked the somber child staring out at a train - incidentally one with the name of a powerful family on the side - and then follow his machinations as he grows up obsessed with this very family.

Ira Levin's novel (even Ayn Rand liked it!) had been effectively adapted for the screen in 1956 but heaven forbid that the urge to fix things unbroken should remain unfulfilled! ""Fixing,"" in this case, includes gimmicks. Instead of two mere sisters we have...ta DA!...IDENTICAL TWINS! And not merely content to have a psycho male character, why not have the normal female character played by a real-life SUSPECTED psycho?! Sean Young has given me the creeps since No Way Out, and it seems my hunch was justified; I later read assertions of some pretty bizarre behavior (it has been my experience that where smoke is evident, fire must be nearby). In addition, we have the antagonist staging his own death to throw his mama off the track, a cigarette lighter, ...you get the idea.Unlike the (much more tasteful) original, this film is sometimes explicitly sexual, so if viewing AKBD is, for some reason, essential to your well-being and titillation is a priority, go for this one by all means, especially if fidelity to the source material isn't important (be aware, though, that it's much less suspenseful than the original). The print looks and sounds good and is widescreen, so things could be worse (I guess).Speaking of weirdness, just to give you an idea of what we're dealing with here, either Young has managed to channel Virginia Leith (the original's female lead) or is bending over backwards to sound just like her.
