Gammill,"[10, 11]","For anyone who grew up in the late 60's and early 70's, Saturday mornings simply weren't complete without a healthy does of cartoons from Hanna-Barbera studios.  These colorful and fun programs may not have been the best animated shows in the world, but they were more than enough for us kids.Inch High Private Eye (1973) only lasted one season, but I think it holds up as well as most HB shows from the same era.  Mysteries and crime-solving, typically with young protagonists and some kind of animal, were the studio's bread and butter.  And while the dimunitive hero of Inch High stands out among his animated peers, the show doesn't stray far from the tried-and-true formula.  Inch has his young human sidekicks Lori (for a 5 year old boy in  1973, the prettiest girl outside of Josie & the Pussycats), her beefy boyfriend Gator, and canine companion Braveheart (voiced by Scooby Doo's Don Messick).  Their adventures pit them against the standard assortment of larger-than-life baddies, monsters, etc.While the show may be a hard sell for today's kids accustomed to a faster pace, I think it holds up quite well for those who enjoyed it growing up.  Like all cartoons from its era, it's all perfectly innocent, largely non-violent, and witty in a juvenile sort of way.As with all their recent made-on-demand relases, Warner Bros. has given this one the ""no frills"" treatment.  All you get is the cartoons, spread over 2 discs.  There are no subtitles or other language tracks.  Picure and audio quality are quite good, although it is obvious no extensive remastering has been done.  I viewed the discs on my Blu-ray player on a 52"" screen and was mostly satisfied with the results.  Definitely recommended for fans of the show, or anyone who likes ""old school"" Saturday morning fun. :-)",4,Another forgotten gem from Hanna-Barbera,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,1791,"['anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'simply', 'were', ""n't"", 'complete', 'healthy', 'cartoons', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'studios', 'colorful', 'fun', 'programs', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'animated', 'shows', 'world', 'were', 'more', 'enough', 'kids.Inch', 'High', 'Private', 'Eye', '1973', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'think', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'HB', 'same', 'era', 'Mysteries', 'crime-solving', 'typically', 'young', 'protagonists', 'kind', 'animal', 'were', 'studio', 'bread', 'butter', 'dimunitive', 'hero', 'Inch', 'High', 'out', 'animated', 'peers', 'show', ""n't"", 'stray', 'far', 'tried-and-true', 'formula', 'Inch', 'young', 'human', 'sidekicks', 'Lori', '5', 'year', 'old', 'boy', '1973', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'beefy', 'boyfriend', 'Gator', 'canine', 'companion', 'Braveheart', 'voiced', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Don', 'Messick', 'adventures', 'pit', 'standard', 'assortment', 'larger-than-life', 'baddies', 'monsters', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'sell', 'today', 'kids', 'accustomed', 'faster', 'pace', 'think', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'growing', 'up', 'cartoons', 'era', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'largely', 'non-violent', 'witty', 'juvenile', 'sort', 'way.As', 'recent', 'made-on-demand', 'relases', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'given', 'one', 'frills', 'treatment', 'get', 'cartoons', 'spread', '2', 'discs', 'are', 'subtitles', 'other', 'language', 'tracks', 'Picure', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'obvious', 'extensive', 'remastering', 'been', 'done', 'viewed', 'discs', 'Blu-ray', 'player', '52', 'screen', 'was', 'mostly', 'satisfied', 'results', 'Definitely', 'recommended', 'fans', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'school', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'fun']",Inch High Private Eye

1539755,A11DSVTOJO61A8,B007XTDWO2,Leslie,"[3, 3]","This is not your usual private eye series. This detective is employed by Mr. Finkerton of the Finkerton Detective Agency, and is assisted by his niece Lori, her boyfriend Gator who is an expert at disguises, and his always alert, faithful, fearless, canine crusader against crime, Braveheart.The only thing that sets him apart from all the other private eyes is that he is the world's biggest little detective called, Inch High, and goes where no man has gone before, and will never want to go.Mr. High says that each case is closed by the cunningness and craftsmanship of his detective work, except they are filled with comedy and bungled detective work on his part, but worked out mainly by his assistants. But most of all, if Mr. Inch High asks a question he likes to answer it himself and gets annoyed if someone butts in.Braveheart is mostly his mode of transport when they are not in the Hushmobile, but do not mention the word C A T or he will disappear in the opposite direction. In the right situation he is a great help to his colleagues and would put Scooby-Doo to shame.Mr. Finkerton wishes that Inch High would just disappear most of the time, as his office is in ruins by the time he leaves. His cases gets bungled and Mr. Finkerton is firing and hiring him in all thirteen episodes of this two-disc collection.While fighting some of the toughest crooks like King Ra and Spumsmi the Great, Mr. High teams up with the amazing Super Flea and Goldie, the world's greatest goldfish.Famie Farr, Kathy Gori, Ted Knight, Bob Lutterell, and others lent their voices to this amazing series. While Lennie Weinribb did an excellent job of Inch High, and Don Messick's voice is Braveheart, they all do a good job of it.This complete set is a wonderful collection of animation and gets five stars from me, as it was original in concept and I enjoyed watching the complete series.",5,The Biggest Inch High Private Eye,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1880,"['not', 'usual', 'private', 'eye', 'series', 'detective', 'employed', 'Mr.', 'Finkerton', 'Finkerton', 'Detective', 'Agency', 'assisted', 'niece', 'Lori', 'boyfriend', 'Gator', 'who', 'expert', 'disguises', 'always', 'alert', 'faithful', 'fearless', 'canine', 'crusader', 'crime', 'Braveheart.The', 'only', 'thing', 'apart', 'other', 'private', 'eyes', 'world', 'biggest', 'little', 'detective', 'called', 'Inch', 'High', 'where', 'man', 'gone', 'before', 'will', 'never', 'want', 'go.Mr', 'High', 'case', 'closed', 'cunningness', 'craftsmanship', 'detective', 'work', 'are', 'filled', 'comedy', 'bungled', 'detective', 'work', 'part', 'worked', 'out', 'mainly', 'assistants', 'most', 'Mr', 'Inch', 'High', 'question', 'answer', 'annoyed', 'someone', 'butts', 'in.Braveheart', 'mostly', 'mode', 'transport', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'Hushmobile', 'do', 'not', 'mention', 'word', 'C', 'A', 'T', 'will', 'disappear', 'opposite', 'direction', 'right', 'situation', 'great', 'help', 'colleagues', 'would', 'put', 'Scooby-Doo', 'shame.Mr', 'Finkerton', 'Inch', 'High', 'would', 'just', 'disappear', 'most', 'time', 'office', 'ruins', 'time', 'cases', 'bungled', 'Mr.', 'Finkerton', 'firing', 'hiring', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'two-disc', 'collection.While', 'fighting', 'toughest', 'crooks', 'King', 'Ra', 'Spumsmi', 'Great', 'Mr.', 'High', 'up', 'amazing', 'Super', 'Flea', 'Goldie', 'world', 'greatest', 'goldfish.Famie', 'Farr', 'Kathy', 'Gori', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'Bob', 'Lutterell', 'others', 'lent', 'voices', 'amazing', 'series', 'Lennie', 'Weinribb', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Inch', 'High', 'Don', 'Messick', 'voice', 'Braveheart', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'it.This', 'complete', 'set', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'animation', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'original', 'concept', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'complete', 'series']",Inch High Private Eye
