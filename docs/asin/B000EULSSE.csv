Cardella,"[0, 1]","Louis C.K.: One Night Stand gives you a 30 minute dose of Louis C.K. and his ""no hold"" brand of observational humor that has earned him a cult following. Louis touches upon the sometimes crazy moments one experiences in everyday married life, and many other common day to day observations, much like George Carlin did in his stand-up. Carlin was a major influence on Louis C.K. and his direct ""tell it like it is"" style. If you are a fan of the great late George Carlin like I am, you will appreciate Mr. C.K.'s brand of humor.

Little did I know that we would fine such an amazing and talented comedian.  Louis CK is quick, funny and so hilarious.  We had to watch this special three times to catch all the jokes we missed because we could not stop laughing.
