Fortunately, I have plans to do that and that's why I bought the video. There were some parts that just brought a smile to my face. One of them is when Dr. Noah Hutchings is shown sitting by a young boy out in the desert. The young boy says something to Noah and they both grin. It was real, not rehearsed.The more studious parts of the DVD were well done. I learned more in watching this DVD than I had previously in everything I've read. It also left me wanting to know still more, which is what I want when I study a topic.The video is definitely not a secular travel video, as the title indicates.I loved it!Comment",5,I Greatly Enjoyed Seeing Petra And Hearing Noah Hutchings On The Prophecy Regarding Petra,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,701,"['DVD', 'made', 'want', 'jump', 'plane', 'travel', 'Petra', 'see', 'person', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'plans', 'do', 'why', 'bought', 'video', 'were', 'parts', 'just', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'One', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Noah', 'Hutchings', 'shown', 'sitting', 'young', 'boy', 'desert', 'young', 'boy', 'something', 'Noah', 'grin', 'was', 'real', 'not', 'rehearsed.The', 'more', 'studious', 'parts', 'DVD', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'learned', 'more', 'watching', 'DVD', 'had', 'previously', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'also', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'still', 'more', 'what', 'want', 'when', 'study', 'topic.The', 'video', 'definitely', 'not', 'secular', 'travel', 'video', 'title', 'indicates.I', 'loved', 'Comment']",N/A

1123692,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B00102F5XY,J. Munyon,"[4, 4]","South Radio Church (A.K.A. Southwest Radio Ministries) is the oldest, longest running Christian radio ministry in the United States.  Dr. E. F. Webber pioneered a radio station in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1933, and after his passing in 1959, Rev. Noah W. Hutchings took the regional ministry to becoming international.  Rev. Hutchings has authored over 100 books, led numerous tours and missions to the Far East, Asia, China, Mongolia, Russia, Europe, Central America, and Cuba, as well as 50 tours to Israel and the Middle East.This video is part of Rev. Hutchings' legacy, and he appears on this DVD as he shares some of the significance of the city of Petra.  The ancient ruins date back approximately 5,000 years to Esau (Jacob and Esau of the Bible story in Genesis; or also referenced by the Talmud), who is held by most scholars and researchers to have built the city of Petra; otherwise known is a major city of the Edomite people.What I was hoping for from this video was a visual tour in, around, and through the caves and structures known as the ancient city of Petra.  This was made popular by the 1989 Steven Spielberg movie ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" with Denholm Elliott, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford; who search for the Holy Grail and ultimately end up at the city of Petra.  Poetic license heavily exploited by Hollywood (as it usually is), I was fairly certain the city of Petra has no such extravagant enormous cavern as depicted in the Indiana Jones film, but I wanted some authoritative video footage of the city of Petra so I can see just what is there.  The city of Petra being as old as it is, it doesn't take much imagination to see it as a significant city of history, and buying this DVD ""Petra; Prophecy Revealed"" is rumored to be the most informative single resource for those who want to see the city of Petra, but due to health or financial restrictions cannot otherwise tour that ancient location.The video footage of this ancient place is said to be the best available on one DVD, and although I can't say I am thoroughly convinced this is the best DVD for touring the city of Petra, it does have more information than any other resource I have engaged in my quest for learning.  Most people aren't interested in somebody else's interpretation of the Bible prophecies about the ""end times"" (eschatology) and will have a tough time listening to the narration (by Rev. Hutchings and Ken Klein) because if the Bible was a simple, easy to read and understandable book, the United States wouldn't have over 600 formally recognized, licensed denominations of religion.  The DVD should be a little clearer that this is intended primarily to be convincing as a religious study of Bible prophecy more than it is a video footage tour of the ancient city of Petra, although it still rates IMHO as a professionally done 60 minute film that will tell you about and show you video footage of Petra.",4,covers a lot more than just the city of Petra,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2931,"['South', 'Radio', 'Church', 'A.K.A', 'Southwest', 'Radio', 'Ministries', 'oldest', 'longest', 'running', 'Christian', 'radio', 'ministry', 'United', 'States', 'Dr.', 'E.', 'F.', 'Webber', 'pioneered', 'radio', 'station', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'Oklahoma', '1933', 'passing', '1959', 'Rev', 'Noah', 'W.', 'Hutchings', 'took', 'regional', 'ministry', 'becoming', 'international', 'Rev', 'Hutchings', 'authored', '100', 'books', 'led', 'numerous', 'tours', 'missions', 'Far', 'East', 'Asia', 'China', 'Mongolia', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'Central', 'America', 'Cuba', 'as', 'well', '50', 'tours', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East.This', 'video', 'part', 'Rev', 'Hutchings', 'legacy', 'DVD', 'shares', 'significance', 'city', 'Petra', 'ancient', 'date', 'back', 'approximately', '5,000', 'years', 'Esau', 'Jacob', 'Esau', 'Bible', 'story', 'Genesis', 'also', 'referenced', 'Talmud', 'who', 'held', 'most', 'scholars', 'researchers', 'have', 'built', 'city', 'Petra', 'otherwise', 'known', 'major', 'city', 'Edomite', 'people.What', 'was', 'hoping', 'video', 'was', 'visual', 'tour', 'caves', 'structures', 'known', 'ancient', 'city', 'Petra', 'was', 'made', 'popular', '1989', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'search', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'ultimately', 'end', 'up', 'city', 'Petra', 'Poetic', 'license', 'heavily', 'exploited', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'was', 'fairly', 'certain', 'city', 'Petra', 'such', 'extravagant', 'enormous', 'cavern', 'depicted', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'film', 'wanted', 'authoritative', 'video', 'footage', 'city', 'Petra', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'there', 'city', 'Petra', 'being', 'as', 'old', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'imagination', 'see', 'significant', 'city', 'history', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Petra', 'Prophecy', 'Revealed', 'rumored', 'be', 'most', 'informative', 'single', 'resource', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'city', 'Petra', 'due', 'health', 'financial', 'restrictions', 'can', 'not', 'otherwise', 'tour', 'ancient', 'location.The', 'video', 'footage', 'ancient', 'place', 'said', 'be', 'best', 'available', 'one', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'convinced', 'best', 'DVD', 'touring', 'city', 'Petra', 'have', 'more', 'information', 'other', 'resource', 'have', 'engaged', 'quest', 'learning', 'Most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'somebody', 'else', 'interpretation', 'Bible', 'prophecies', 'end', 'times', 'eschatology', 'will', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'listening', 'narration', 'Rev', 'Hutchings', 'Ken', 'Klein', 'Bible', 'was', 'simple', 'easy', 'read', 'understandable', 'book', 'United', 'States', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'over', '600', 'formally', 'recognized', 'licensed', 'denominations', 'religion', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'clearer', 'intended', 'primarily', 'be', 'convincing', 'religious', 'study', 'Bible', 'prophecy', 'more', 'video', 'footage', 'tour', 'ancient', 'city', 'Petra', 'still', 'rates', 'IMHO', 'professionally', 'done', '60', 'minute', 'film', 'will', 'tell', 'show', 'video', 'footage', 'Petra']",N/A

I thought there would be archaeological, geologic and historical information, but virtually everything was how Petra fulfills some cryptic Biblical prophesy.  Virtually all that was said about the city was that it was founded by Esau, according to the Bible, and somehow I doubted that he built/carved it all by himself.  Who did it? Why go to all that hard work?  Who lived there?  Do we know any of this?The geology of the site is strange.  According to this video, this is a volcanic outcropping, but the stones are sandstone, and sandstone is sedimentary, certainly not volcanic.
