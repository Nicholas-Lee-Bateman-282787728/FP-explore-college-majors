778557,AIMR915K4YCN,B0000DG990,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[9, 9]","Richard Burton is a priest at a catholic school for boys. One day during latin class he tells the boys about the sanctity of confession, and that the priest who hears it is bound to not reveal the confession to anyone. This is true even if the confessor has committed murder. Well, this puts ideas into the heads of some of the lads, who set out to use this information against the priest himself. False confessions are made, as well as a confession of murder! Burton's character is sent into turmoil trying to get to the bottom of things. He's made a fool of and also gets drawn into a dark plot to destroy him. ABSOLUTION has many twists and creepy moments. I was surprised at how good it turned out to be. I was expecting some dumb religious movie!

The movie takes many twists and turns making it facinating as to what is really going on. The reason for not giving this movie 5 stars is in the quality of print to DVD. A remastered print in it's originality would certainly make this movie even more enjoyable and sort after. Still a great film though.,4,Another great Burton performance,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,373,"['really', 'good', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'great', 'Burton', 'performance', 'movie', 'many', 'twists', 'making', 'facinating', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'reason', 'not', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'quality', 'print', 'DVD', 'A', 'remastered', 'print', 'originality', 'would', 'certainly', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'sort', 'Still', 'great', 'film']",N/A

Maybe that says something about his frame of mind.

778561,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0000DG990,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""Absolution"" surprised me. I expected a boring melodrama with Richard Burton as a priest in a Catholic boy's school, but was pleasantly surprised with genuine creepiness and interesting plot developments.Despite numerous scenes of Latin class and related academic pursuits, the film has an interesting storyline and some surprising developments. Burton makes the error of telling his students that anything said in confession can never be revealed, even to the police. This gives the boys an idea for a great practical joke at Burton's expense, but things turn ugly fast, first for a banjo-toting hippie, and later for others. The student under suspicion is cunning, perhaps even more cunning than Burton, and things rapidly spin out of control as Burton reaps an unexpected whirlwind.Not all is as it seems, however. Part of the final plot point requires a suspension of disbelief, but overall the film has a haunted, harrowing feel that is rarely matched in psychological thrillers. Burton does occasionally give in to the temptation to overact, and the scenery chewing is contagious in the cast, particularly in the closing moments. Despite those drawbacks (and a dreadful bit of comic opera performed by the boys), I liked the film, and found it absorbing.",4,"""Why Should I Give You The Comfort Of Martyrdom?""",1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1260,"['Absolution', 'surprised', 'expected', 'boring', 'melodrama', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'priest', 'Catholic', 'boy', 'school', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'genuine', 'creepiness', 'interesting', 'plot', 'developments.Despite', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Latin', 'class', 'related', 'academic', 'pursuits', 'film', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'surprising', 'developments', 'Burton', 'error', 'telling', 'students', 'anything', 'said', 'confession', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'revealed', 'even', 'police', 'boys', 'idea', 'great', 'practical', 'joke', 'Burton', 'expense', 'things', 'turn', 'ugly', 'fast', 'first', 'banjo-toting', 'hippie', 'later', 'others', 'student', 'suspicion', 'cunning', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'cunning', 'Burton', 'things', 'rapidly', 'spin', 'control', 'Burton', 'unexpected', 'whirlwind.Not', 'however', 'Part', 'final', 'plot', 'point', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'film', 'haunted', 'harrowing', 'feel', 'rarely', 'matched', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'Burton', 'occasionally', 'give', 'temptation', 'overact', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'contagious', 'cast', 'particularly', 'closing', 'moments', 'drawbacks', 'dreadful', 'bit', 'comic', 'opera', 'performed', 'boys', 'liked', 'film', 'found', 'absorbing']",N/A
