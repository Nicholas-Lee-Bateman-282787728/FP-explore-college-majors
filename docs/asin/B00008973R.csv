735803,A2DTK0I1MGXWP4,B00008973R,"B. Simms ""Bevpianolady""","[14, 15]","I have always been an avid exerciser:  competitive swimming until my late 40s, step aerobics for 20+ years, and Zumba for the past 3 years.  I was desperate, therefore, when I broke my 5th metatarsal bone (completely in two) 7 weeks ago and was told by my podiatrist that I'll be in a wheelchair for at least 16 weeks!  I ordered several dvd workouts, all claiming to have aerobic benefits, but did find any of them worth repeating until I found this one.  While it does not get my heart rate up to where it needs to be for aerobic conditioning, it still gets me moving and does so safely and with a lot of fun.  Yes, the music is terrible (electronic, poorly arranged, and Muzak-like), and some of the people in the video look really out of it.  BUt the movements are very good and they actually DO correspond to movements one would do in the various dances represented.  I have to modify the movements with my broken leg side in order to prevent pressure on that foot, but this is easily done even with the huge air cast that I have to wear.I also like the use of paper plates for part of the workout.  I also have a broken right hand (in a hard cast), and I can hold the paper plates easily.  They are great substitutes for clapping my hands together!The workout is silly, corny, and the set is really dated, but I am VERY grateful for this DVD and will use it every day for the next several months!",4,A lifesaver during my long recovery from a broken foot!,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,1402,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'avid', 'exerciser', 'competitive', 'swimming', 'late', '40s', 'step', 'aerobics', '20+', 'years', 'Zumba', 'past', '3', 'years', 'was', 'desperate', 'therefore', 'when', 'broke', '5th', 'metatarsal', 'bone', 'completely', 'two', '7', 'weeks', 'ago', 'was', 'told', 'podiatrist', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wheelchair', 'least', '16', 'weeks', 'ordered', 'several', 'dvd', 'workouts', 'claiming', 'have', 'aerobic', 'benefits', 'did', 'find', 'worth', 'repeating', 'found', 'one', 'not', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'where', 'be', 'aerobic', 'conditioning', 'still', 'moving', 'so', 'safely', 'lot', 'fun', 'Yes', 'music', 'terrible', 'electronic', 'poorly', 'arranged', 'Muzak-like', 'people', 'video', 'look', 'really', 'BUt', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'actually', 'DO', 'correspond', 'movements', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'various', 'dances', 'represented', 'have', 'modify', 'movements', 'broken', 'leg', 'side', 'order', 'prevent', 'pressure', 'foot', 'easily', 'done', 'even', 'huge', 'air', 'cast', 'have', 'wear.I', 'also', 'use', 'paper', 'plates', 'part', 'workout', 'also', 'have', 'broken', 'right', 'hand', 'hard', 'cast', 'can', 'hold', 'paper', 'easily', 'are', 'great', 'substitutes', 'clapping', 'hands', 'together', 'workout', 'silly', 'corny', 'set', 'really', 'dated', 'am', 'VERY', 'grateful', 'DVD', 'will', 'use', 'day', 'next', 'several', 'months']",N/A

I was hoping that this DVD would give me a good upper body workout with some fun music.The music is okay, but most of these exercises for the upper body are simply the same arm movements with your fingers pointing or with your hands clapping and waving. There was no effort to focus on anything particular muscle groups of the arms, chest or abdomen; but there are plenty of shoulder rotations and stretching.Half way through most of these routines, I was bored with the lack of arm work and began doing other movements with my arms, just to keep active. There were long periods of just slapping your knees, clapping your hands or hitting paper plates together.I cannot do any of the footwork, but it was obvious that the footwork was also repetitious. How many knee bounces or toe taps make for a good work out?As for the trainer, Jodi speaks rapidly, when giving her initial instructions...as though everyone should know what she is about to do. She seems to have rehearsed her people on the video for the routines, she doesn't give her audience much preparation. I felt like was always one step behind her throughout all of the activities.I will give this DVD away; and I cancelled my other order for one of Jodi's DVDs, because this one was so disappointing.",2,Not for handicapped people and too repetitious.,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1323,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'handicapped', 'wheelchair', 'was', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'would', 'give', 'good', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'fun', 'music.The', 'music', 'okay', 'most', 'exercises', 'upper', 'body', 'are', 'simply', 'same', 'arm', 'movements', 'fingers', 'pointing', 'hands', 'clapping', 'waving', 'was', 'effort', 'focus', 'anything', 'particular', 'muscle', 'groups', 'arms', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'are', 'plenty', 'shoulder', 'rotations', 'stretching.Half', 'way', 'most', 'routines', 'was', 'bored', 'lack', 'arm', 'work', 'began', 'doing', 'other', 'movements', 'arms', 'just', 'keep', 'active', 'were', 'long', 'periods', 'just', 'slapping', 'knees', 'clapping', 'hands', 'hitting', 'paper', 'plates', 'together.I', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'footwork', 'was', 'obvious', 'footwork', 'was', 'also', 'repetitious', 'How', 'many', 'knee', 'bounces', 'toe', 'taps', 'make', 'good', 'work', 'out', 'trainer', 'Jodi', 'rapidly', 'when', 'giving', 'initial', 'instructions', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'rehearsed', 'people', 'video', 'routines', ""n't"", 'give', 'audience', 'much', 'preparation', 'felt', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'activities.I', 'will', 'give', 'DVD', 'away', 'cancelled', 'other', 'order', 'one', 'Jodi', 'DVDs', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'disappointing']",N/A
