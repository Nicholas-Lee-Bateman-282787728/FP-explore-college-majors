It seemed like a cross between The Grudge and The Ring only not nearly as creepy.  The premise was good though.  For free, if you don't have anything else to do, I would say watch it.  It wasn't terrible.  I didn't find it too scary though.",3,Okay movie,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,354,"['movie', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'time', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'seemed', 'cross', 'Grudge', 'Ring', 'only', 'not', 'nearly', 'creepy', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'though', 'free', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'would', 'say', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'scary']",Watch Me

1169501,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B001B093T2,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[0, 0]","So, yes, the production values were low, probably due to the budget. However, the story was engaging and kept my interest throughout. The acting ranged from adequate to not but again, the strengths carried the film above its limitations. The visuals were effective and creepy. I'm talking here about the red headed girl. The underground film collector was a very interesting character and his contributions in the plot development were an important part of what made it good. I am not sorry I watched this at all, actually I'm glad I did, and it stands head and shoulders above its competition, in terms of similarly low budgeted offerings. This is coming from  a lifelong horror fan, who watches a horror film a day and I give almost anything a chance. My expectations are realistic, so you won't catch me bashing a film for being other than it possibly could be. I don't expect every horror movie to be a defining moment in the genre's history. Given the overall state of the genre in the last 10-15 years, I wouldn't expect anything like that to appear on a streaming only release. I would be surprised (though ecstatic) if something even close to that was released theatrically nowadays.. This one satisfied the horror junkie (though I wouldn't make the mistake of watching these lo, lo budgets during primetime viewing hour).",4,The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1330,"['So', 'yes', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'low', 'probably', 'due', 'budget', 'However', 'story', 'was', 'engaging', 'kept', 'interest', 'acting', 'ranged', 'adequate', 'not', 'again', 'strengths', 'carried', 'film', 'limitations', 'visuals', 'were', 'effective', 'creepy', ""'m"", 'talking', 'here', 'red', 'headed', 'girl', 'underground', 'film', 'collector', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'contributions', 'plot', 'development', 'were', 'important', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'good', 'am', 'not', 'sorry', 'watched', 'actually', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'head', 'shoulders', 'competition', 'terms', 'similarly', 'low', 'budgeted', 'offerings', 'coming', 'lifelong', 'horror', 'fan', 'who', 'horror', 'film', 'day', 'give', 'almost', 'anything', 'chance', 'expectations', 'are', 'realistic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'bashing', 'film', 'being', 'other', 'possibly', 'could', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'horror', 'movie', 'be', 'defining', 'moment', 'genre', 'history', 'Given', 'overall', 'state', 'genre', 'last', '10-15', 'years', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'appear', 'streaming', 'only', 'release', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'ecstatic', 'something', 'even', 'close', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'nowadays..', 'one', 'satisfied', 'horror', 'junkie', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'watching', 'lo', 'lo', 'budgets', 'primetime', 'viewing', 'hour']",Watch Me

People die after watching a porno-snuff film either from a disc or on the Internet. A young pale woman with punk dyed red hair appears, walks like something from Juon (at times) and then kills the viewer. Sometimes people disappear a matter of seconds after watching the film, sometimes they drag it out. Because of the low budget aspect you don't see any killing, so they attempt to create suspense by playing the same 4 piano notes over and over. Toward the end of the film we discover there is an additional mystery aspect that wasn't developed, and that is some people who view the film don't get killed, but they don't know why.The movie has that super VHS quality to it. The best part is that the pain of watching this film lasts for just 78 minutes...if you don't kill yourself before it is over. Lines not well written. Characters not developed.

Sipos,"[2, 3]","First off, if you really want WATCH ME, you can buy it cheaper as part of theMidnight Horror Collection V.2DVD set.This film interested me because it was described as a slavish ripoff ofThe Ring, one of my favorite horror films of this century's first decade. (Not ofRingu, which I didn't like as much.) Sure, Japanese ghosts have been done to death in recent years, but WATCH ME sounded like an extremely shameless ripoff. I was intrigued.Turns out WATCH ME is worse than I expected. And while it borrows from The Ring, it seems to steal as much fromThe Grudge(another of my favorites).WATCH ME is set in Australia, aside from a prologue in Beijing. Story concerns two college women doing term papers for cinema studies. They plan to research and analyze obscure snuff films. In the process, they stumble upon a ghost who curses their computer, sending a snuff film over their email accounts. You watch it, you die. (Usually.)This is an amateurish, micro-budgeted production. Lighting is flat, inept, and ugly. The light's color temperature changes from room to room, so that some scenes have a warm, yellowish hue, others a cold, bluish hue, or whatever else.That's great if such alternating light tones had an artistic intent behind them. But here it seems the filmmaker simply used whatever lamps were available in a room (florescent, incandescent, whatever), without aesthetic intent or coherency, creating a sloppy look. Color temperature, hues, shadows, however the scene looked after turning on whatever lights were in the room, that's how the filmmaker left it. At least that's how it looks.Compare that toThe Ring, with its consistent aqua-marine (i.e., WATERY) hues throughout the film, aesthetically supporting the tale of a girl who was DROWNED, as did the location (Seattle, with its RAIN)The actors in WATCH ME are pretty bad, especially the lady detective, who neither looks (slovenly hair and dress) or sounds (bad dialog -- the writer's fault) like a detective.Even so, I didn't hate this film. It's better than theTotal Recall remake, a film a saw several weeks ago that was SO bad I'm still trying to bash it from my memory.",2,"crappy, but I've seen worse -- buy it cheaper",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,2144,"['First', 'off', 'really', 'want', 'WATCH', 'ME', 'can', 'buy', 'cheaper', 'part', 'theMidnight', 'Horror', 'Collection', 'V.2DVD', 'set.This', 'film', 'interested', 'was', 'described', 'slavish', 'ripoff', 'ofThe', 'Ring', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'century', 'first', 'decade', 'Not', 'ofRingu', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'Sure', 'Japanese', 'ghosts', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'recent', 'years', 'WATCH', 'ME', 'sounded', 'extremely', 'shameless', 'ripoff', 'was', 'intrigued.Turns', 'out', 'WATCH', 'ME', 'worse', 'expected', 'Ring', 'steal', 'as', 'much', 'fromThe', 'Grudge', 'favorites', '.WATCH', 'ME', 'set', 'Australia', 'aside', 'prologue', 'Beijing', 'Story', 'concerns', 'two', 'college', 'women', 'doing', 'term', 'papers', 'cinema', 'studies', 'plan', 'research', 'analyze', 'obscure', 'snuff', 'films', 'process', 'stumble', 'ghost', 'who', 'computer', 'sending', 'snuff', 'film', 'email', 'accounts', 'watch', 'die', 'Usually', 'amateurish', 'micro-budgeted', 'production', 'Lighting', 'flat', 'inept', 'ugly', 'light', 'color', 'temperature', 'changes', 'room', 'room', 'scenes', 'have', 'warm', 'yellowish', 'hue', 'others', 'cold', 'bluish', 'hue', 'great', 'such', 'alternating', 'light', 'tones', 'had', 'artistic', 'intent', 'here', 'filmmaker', 'simply', 'used', 'lamps', 'were', 'available', 'room', 'florescent', 'incandescent', 'aesthetic', 'intent', 'coherency', 'creating', 'sloppy', 'look', 'Color', 'temperature', 'hues', 'shadows', 'however', 'scene', 'looked', 'turning', 'lights', 'were', 'room', 'how', 'filmmaker', 'left', 'least', 'how', 'toThe', 'Ring', 'consistent', 'aqua-marine', 'i.e.', 'WATERY', 'film', 'aesthetically', 'supporting', 'tale', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'DROWNED', 'did', 'location', 'Seattle', 'RAIN', 'actors', 'WATCH', 'ME', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'especially', 'lady', 'detective', 'who', 'looks', 'slovenly', 'hair', 'dress', 'bad', 'dialog', 'writer', 'fault', 'detective.Even', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'better', 'theTotal', 'Recall', 'remake', 'film', 'saw', 'several', 'weeks', 'was', 'SO', 'bad', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'bash', 'memory']",Watch Me

It played the wrong music scores for the scary scenes. The music chosen was more of a person finding a clue than music scores that deliver the &#34;dun dun dun&#34; type of intro to creep the viewer out.The actors chosen did not sell the scare like they could have. They were to nonchalant in convincing the audience of a malevolent presence. And us real horror buffs know what I mean.In conclusion I was on the edge of my seat waiting for that combination of intense music scores and the blood and gore which accompany such films. I did not get it. The 3 star rating I gave is because it could have been a whole lot better.
