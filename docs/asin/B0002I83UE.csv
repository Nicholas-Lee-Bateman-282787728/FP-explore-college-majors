I did not understand a word that came out of his mouth! he's not a singer. he's a below average guitar player. listen to his solos!!! those are as basic as they come!why did he mumble through all the songs???? the band didnt' sound tight at all.there was no chemistry on stage. everyone was just doing their own thing!mike's voice on his latest album is ok, but still not that good at all. And after watching this dvd, OMG! this guy can't sing, can't pronounce any word properly, ....he plainly sucked!Now i know why this guy will never go mainstream, he's not even near average. And he had the guts to diss guns n rose!!!! LOL. he wasted all that money on a gibson, but doesnt' even know how to do a solo on it!from the sex, love, rock n roll, two songs are good. number 1 and 2. well...number 10 is ok too i guess. other than that, it sucked.mike ness does not sing, nor does he scream. he freakin' mumbles and even makes a hick-up crap on one of the song! WTF!? lolsocial distortion is crap. that is my opinion. keep this dump underground! i wasted my money!!!",1,dag,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,1108,"['mike', 'ness', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'sing', 'live', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'word', 'came', 'mouth', 'not', 'singer', 'below', 'average', 'guitar', 'player', 'listen', 'solos', 'are', 'as', 'basic', 'come', 'why', 'did', 'mumble', 'songs', 'band', 'didnt', 'sound', 'tight', 'all.there', 'was', 'chemistry', 'stage', 'everyone', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'mike', 'voice', 'latest', 'album', 'ok', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'watching', 'dvd', 'OMG', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pronounce', 'word', 'properly', 'plainly', 'sucked', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'guy', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'mainstream', 'not', 'even', 'near', 'average', 'had', 'guts', 'diss', 'guns', 'n', 'rose', 'LOL', 'wasted', 'money', 'gibson', 'doesnt', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'solo', 'sex', 'love', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'two', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'number', '1', '2.', 'well', 'number', '10', 'ok', 'too', 'i', 'guess', 'other', 'ness', 'not', 'sing', 'scream', 'freakin', 'mumbles', 'even', 'hick-up', 'crap', 'one', 'song', 'WTF', 'lolsocial', 'distortion', 'crap', 'opinion', 'keep', 'dump', 'underground', 'i', 'wasted', 'money']",N/A

Age and years of touring show.  Mike Ness's vocals are not quite what they used to be but despite that he still is one of the most powerful singers.  Average effort as far as the direction is concerned.  If SD were captured at their pinnacle I would recommend it for everybody but I can only recommend this for SD fans.  If you are new to SD, don't let this deter you from purchasing some of their CDs, especially ""White Light, White Heat, White Trash"", which is a classic that I recommend for everybody.",4,Still one of the best,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,594,"['only', 'DVD', 'documentation', 'SD', 'performance', 'must', 'have', 'SD', 'fans', 'Age', 'years', 'touring', 'show', 'Mike', 'Ness', 'vocals', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'singers', 'Average', 'effort', 'as', 'far', 'direction', 'concerned', 'SD', 'were', 'captured', 'pinnacle', 'would', 'recommend', 'everybody', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'SD', 'fans', 'are', 'new', 'SD', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'purchasing', 'CDs', 'especially', 'White', 'Light', 'White', 'Heat', 'White', 'Trash', 'classic', 'recommend', 'everybody']",N/A
834759,A84STPNHGN7QW,B0002I83UE,Deanmozzer,"[4, 5]","Having been to a few of their shows, I thought a live performance of theirs on DVD couldn't go wrong.  Many of the other reviewers cited the poor performance/lack of motivation in this show.  I totally agree.  This show was far from the energy usually put into their other live shows.  You can tell Mike Ness probably rolled out of bed that morning saying ""S#%T man, I gotta go to work tonight"".  It shows by the dazed/confused look he has on his face during ""Making Believe"".  He almost appears to be making goo-goo eyes at an infant instead of his trademark scowl.  Trust me, it wasn't just that song.  Even the crowd didn't seem to be feeling it.Still, I would take Social D on their worst night over most other bands.  The DVD itself isn't too bad, and if you consider yourself a hardcore fan, you certainly want to pick this up.  The extras are pretty interesting as it captures the band in a documentary-type setting (without the one-on-one closeups), a soundcheck, and the ""Nona Split"" which presents most of the show with around nine different angles at once.Highlights:Rollin' for 4-5-6Mike brings out a small child wearing a ""Mommy's Little Monster"" shirt.  It was HILARIOUS to see the look on this kid's face (who was understandably a little stage shy), as Mike grips the nape of this kid's neck.  Mike didn't mean anything by it, i'm sure those tattooed paws wear a little heavy on anyone...much more so on such a young kid.Nothing says PRISON BOUND like rolling around in a '36 Ford 3-window coupe with your chihuahua.The band has gotten softer, which often comes with age.  The DVD showcases the band at this time in their careers.  It won't be for everyone, but if you can find it for under ten bucks it's a pretty good buy.  The guys obviously love what they do if they're still producing quality music today, but that was an off night.  I forgive you as well Mike, just next time...maybe along with a video collection...make a show more like the LIVE AT THE ROXY cd.",3,A must for fans....but try and keep it under $10,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,1983,"['Having', 'been', 'few', 'shows', 'thought', 'live', 'performance', 'theirs', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'cited', 'poor', 'performance/lack', 'motivation', 'show', 'totally', 'agree', 'show', 'was', 'far', 'energy', 'usually', 'put', 'other', 'live', 'shows', 'can', 'tell', 'Mike', 'Ness', 'probably', 'rolled', 'bed', 'morning', 'saying', 'S', '%', 'T', 'man', 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'work', 'tonight', 'dazed/confused', 'look', 'face', 'Making', 'Believe', 'almost', 'be', 'making', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'infant', 'instead', 'trademark', 'scowl', 'Trust', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'song', 'Even', 'crowd', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'feeling', 'it.Still', 'would', 'take', 'Social', 'D', 'worst', 'night', 'most', 'other', 'bands', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'consider', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'certainly', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'band', 'documentary-type', 'setting', 'one-on-one', 'closeups', 'soundcheck', 'Nona', 'Split', 'most', 'show', 'nine', 'different', 'angles', 'once.Highlights', 'Rollin', '4-5-6Mike', 'brings', 'out', 'small', 'child', 'wearing', 'Mommy', 'Little', 'Monster', 'shirt', 'was', 'HILARIOUS', 'see', 'look', 'kid', 'face', 'who', 'was', 'understandably', 'little', 'stage', 'shy', 'Mike', 'nape', 'kid', 'neck', 'Mike', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', ""'m"", 'sure', 'tattooed', 'paws', 'wear', 'little', 'heavy', 'anyone', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'young', 'kid.Nothing', 'PRISON', 'BOUND', 'rolling', 'around', ""'36"", 'Ford', '3-window', 'coupe', 'chihuahua.The', 'band', 'gotten', 'softer', 'often', 'age', 'DVD', 'band', 'time', 'careers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'can', 'find', 'ten', 'pretty', 'good', 'buy', 'guys', 'obviously', 'love', 'what', 'do', ""'re"", 'still', 'producing', 'quality', 'music', 'today', 'was', 'off', 'night', 'forgive', 'well', 'Mike', 'just', 'next', 'time', 'maybe', 'video', 'collection', 'make', 'show', 'more', 'LIVE', 'AT', 'THE', 'ROXY', 'cd']",N/A

The only problem with the show is that the guys are getting older and it shows. There is not much energy like you expect to see. I think Mike Ness summed it up best, when he refered to the crowd as the Sunday Nighters.  The crowd seems a little lackadaisical.  Probably due to it being an all ages crowd.  The DVD has great extras, and the production value is excellent. You need to check it out, but of course it is not classic Social Distortion.

It's either black and white, WITHOUT those stupid lines running vertically from side to side, or it's color. It's not BOTH!&quot;Why do directors get in the way of great live performances and, when they're released on DVD, we either get strobe-like camera shots, that make you seasick after one song, or a switch between color and black and white, that makes no sense?This is a wonderful performance from a great rock and roll band. But somewhere along the line, the director decided he was gonna be a star too, as so many of them do.And why do the bands approve of this crap?DON'T, I repeat, DON'T let this keep you from acquiring this DVD. Mike Ness' performance is worth the cost of the disc alone, and the new song, FOOTSTEPS ON MY CEILING, is incredible!I wish more bands would take Pearl Jam's lead and just shoot the show from a few angles, and let the camera rest when a great angle is achieved. We don't need a director getting in the way with visuals that weren't offered to the original audience in the first place. Why would they think we want them now?Sound is sterling, and the performance is great.A five-star if I ever saw one, but I deduct a star because of the direction.
