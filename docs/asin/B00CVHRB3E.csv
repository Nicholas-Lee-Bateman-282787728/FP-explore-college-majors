1651324,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00CVHRB3E,Cindy Navarro,"[0, 0]","""Faith, Family, Football"" is what is on the dvd cover, and that sums up the 3 most important things in Jeremy Williams life...and in the order of their importance. This documentary on the final coaching season of Greenville High School (GA) football coach, Jeremy Williams, due to ALS (aka Lou Gehrig's Disease) could be a tear-jerker that leaves you feeling sad. It is not! This is an inspiring story of one man who, while facing an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease, continues to love his God, his family, his players, his friends, and puts others ahead of his own needs. Many would have given up after such devastating news, but Jeremy quickly went into action to do what was best for others. He surrounded himself with a community of family and friends who would work with him as a team to accomplish what needed done while he could still do it.Interspersed with highlights of the games played during William's final season of coaching, we also see both his faith and family in action. He was still speaking at churches, encouraging others to trust in Jesus at all times, and taking part in activities that support ALS research. His family, though, are as amazing and strong as Williams himself. Jeremy's bravery is echoed by his wife, Jennifer, who says, ""This is God's story for the Williamses."" Their son, Jacob, born with Spina Bifida, is confined to a wheelchair, but positive outlook, determination, and sheer joy made me smile several times. Daughter, Josey,is a remarkable young girl who cheerfully helps her dad and younger brother with tasks they are unable to do. Her giggles when Williams is teasing her about something prove her to be a loving cheerleader who is very proud of her dad and a loving caregiver, but one who still knows the joy of childhood. This is a family who knows how to lean on one another and their faith when things are rough.The special features in this 89 minute dvd includes footage featuring images from Williams' college days, footage of the 2009 Greenville football team and the ""Extreme Makeover Home Edition"" segment. If you are looking for a film on team spirit and about the importance of ""going the distance"", this is about a man who goes beyond expectations. Very inspirational.I received a copy of this dvd at no charge from WORD in hopes I would review it. No expectations were given for a good review, but for an honest one. All opinions given were my own.",4,Season of a Lifetime,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,2423,"['Faith', 'Family', 'Football', 'what', 'dvd', 'cover', '3', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'Jeremy', 'Williams', 'life', 'order', 'importance', 'documentary', 'final', 'coaching', 'season', 'Greenville', 'High', 'School', 'GA', 'football', 'coach', 'Jeremy', 'Williams', 'due', 'ALS', 'aka', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'Disease', 'could', 'be', 'tear-jerker', 'feeling', 'sad', 'not', 'inspiring', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'facing', 'incurable', 'progressive', 'neurodegenerative', 'disease', 'love', 'God', 'family', 'players', 'friends', 'others', 'ahead', 'own', 'needs', 'Many', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'such', 'devastating', 'news', 'Jeremy', 'quickly', 'went', 'action', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'others', 'surrounded', 'community', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'work', 'team', 'accomplish', 'what', 'needed', 'done', 'could', 'still', 'do', 'it.Interspersed', 'highlights', 'games', 'played', 'William', 'final', 'season', 'coaching', 'also', 'see', 'faith', 'family', 'action', 'was', 'still', 'speaking', 'churches', 'encouraging', 'others', 'trust', 'Jesus', 'times', 'taking', 'part', 'activities', 'support', 'ALS', 'research', 'family', 'are', 'amazing', 'strong', 'Williams', 'Jeremy', 'bravery', 'echoed', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'who', 'God', 'story', 'Williamses', 'son', 'Jacob', 'born', 'Spina', 'Bifida', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'positive', 'outlook', 'determination', 'sheer', 'joy', 'made', 'smile', 'several', 'times', 'Daughter', 'Josey', 'remarkable', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'cheerfully', 'dad', 'younger', 'brother', 'tasks', 'are', 'unable', 'do', 'giggles', 'when', 'Williams', 'teasing', 'something', 'prove', 'be', 'loving', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'very', 'proud', 'dad', 'loving', 'caregiver', 'one', 'who', 'still', 'joy', 'childhood', 'family', 'who', 'how', 'lean', 'one', 'faith', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'rough.The', 'special', 'features', '89', 'minute', 'dvd', 'footage', 'featuring', 'images', 'Williams', 'college', 'days', 'footage', '2009', 'Greenville', 'football', 'team', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'Home', 'Edition', 'segment', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'team', 'spirit', 'importance', 'going', 'distance', 'man', 'who', 'expectations', 'Very', 'inspirational.I', 'received', 'copy', 'dvd', 'charge', 'WORD', 'hopes', 'would', 'review', 'expectations', 'were', 'given', 'good', 'review', 'honest', 'one', 'opinions', 'given', 'were', 'own']",Season of a Lifetime

1651328,A8N3FYDA2VUYY,B00CVHRB3E,"Pirate2240 ""Kat""","[0, 0]","When faced with the challenge of having to face coming to terms with being diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, head coach of the Greenville Patriots, Jeremy Williams chose a different path than looking at his life with a definitive end point ahead of him. His story is now being captured in the DVD release from Word Films, Season of a Lifetime, showcases how he uses his faith to pull through what would be the end for most of us when faced with a terminal illness at such a young age.Jeremy was showcased on Extreme Home Makeover and the viewers get a glimpse of that season's show as well as how he inspired the cast and crew in their own walk of faith as they prepared a home that would enable him and his younger son Jacob, who is was diagnosed with spinal bifoda which keeps him confined to a wheelchair to enjoy life more.He shares his life with his teenage daughter as well as his high school sweetheart he married.What this DVD captures is much more than Jeremy's final season as coach for the Greenville Patriots, it captures the resilience of a man faced with a difficult disease that will claim his life all too soon, and how he uses that faith to motivate the men he coaches on his football team. It's pretty inspirational to watch how Jeremy never sees what happened to him as a crutch but as a tool to motivate others to never give up. It's simply over, when it's over.I received Season of a Lifetime compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. This is not a fictional based movie but more along the lines of watching the last season in Jeremy's life as a coach and how he motivated his team not only to become a great football team but to become better people outside of the game. His goal is to inspire others and I think he does just that, not only with the members of his church family, but fellow coaches and players in rival teams. It truly does change your perspective in how will you face life when adversity comes your way. Hopefully we will all follow Jeremy's example and do it with grace, strength and dignity. I personally rate this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",5,More than just a movie about football!!!,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,2188,"['When', 'faced', 'challenge', 'having', 'face', 'coming', 'terms', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'ALS', 'also', 'known', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'disease', 'head', 'coach', 'Greenville', 'Patriots', 'Jeremy', 'Williams', 'chose', 'different', 'path', 'looking', 'life', 'definitive', 'end', 'point', 'ahead', 'story', 'now', 'being', 'captured', 'DVD', 'release', 'Word', 'Films', 'Season', 'Lifetime', 'how', 'faith', 'pull', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'most', 'when', 'faced', 'terminal', 'illness', 'young', 'age.Jeremy', 'was', 'showcased', 'Extreme', 'Home', 'Makeover', 'viewers', 'get', 'glimpse', 'season', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'inspired', 'cast', 'crew', 'own', 'walk', 'faith', 'prepared', 'home', 'would', 'enable', 'younger', 'son', 'Jacob', 'who', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'spinal', 'bifoda', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'enjoy', 'life', 'more.He', 'shares', 'life', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'Jeremy', 'final', 'season', 'coach', 'Greenville', 'Patriots', 'resilience', 'man', 'faced', 'difficult', 'disease', 'will', 'claim', 'life', 'too', 'soon', 'how', 'faith', 'motivate', 'men', 'football', 'team', 'pretty', 'inspirational', 'watch', 'how', 'Jeremy', 'never', 'what', 'happened', 'crutch', 'tool', 'motivate', 'others', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'simply', 'over', 'when', 'over.I', 'received', 'Season', 'Lifetime', 'compliments', 'Word', 'Films', 'Edify', 'Media', 'Inc', 'honest', 'review', 'received', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'favorable', 'one', 'not', 'fictional', 'based', 'movie', 'more', 'lines', 'watching', 'last', 'season', 'Jeremy', 'life', 'coach', 'how', 'motivated', 'team', 'not', 'only', 'become', 'great', 'football', 'team', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'game', 'goal', 'inspire', 'others', 'think', 'just', 'not', 'only', 'members', 'church', 'family', 'fellow', 'coaches', 'players', 'rival', 'teams', 'truly', 'change', 'perspective', 'how', 'will', 'face', 'life', 'when', 'adversity', 'way', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'follow', 'Jeremy', 'example', 'do', 'grace', 'strength', 'dignity', 'personally', 'rate', 'one', '4.5', '5', 'stars']",Season of a Lifetime

He is a person who never gives up and who keeps praising God no matter what happens in his life.  So many times we complain about ever little thing, but we are so blessed with everything we have and above all our health. Watch this DVD to see a truly courageous man and his wonderful family.One part of this documentary that I love and find so inspiring is the day Jeremy and his wife find out that he has ALS he tells her we will cry today, but after today we will live life to the fullest, just like nothing has happened. Precious people and they love the Lord so much.I love the way Jeremy cares for his players on his football team. They consider him a father figure. That is very special since some of them have no father. He cares and loves his team and family. Also besides Jeremy's disease his son was born with Spina Bifida and many other troubles.
