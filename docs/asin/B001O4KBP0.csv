We assume Don and Ann did get married and live happily every after, if they were real people in our world Ann would be a widow now since Don, Ted Bessell is dead in real life.Carol Brady, Florence Henederson is a tv widow with out Mr. Brady,Robert Reed, Oliver would have been a widow since Lisa, Eva Gabor died years earlier. Andy Taylor would be a widow again since Helen Crump Anita Corsait has passed too.George is without Weezy either.

Reruns of That Girl kept me sane during the cold, bitter winter of 2006! I spent over $300 so I could own all five seasons on DVD. In Season Five of That Girl, Ann Marie and Donald get engaged to be married. Guess how the show ends? Ann Marie has gone from a Jackie O' haircut to silky, black hair. Donald's hair is longer. The instrumental That Girl theme now has lyrics. Marlo Thomas played a stereotypical Chinese woman on Bonanza. In Hong Kong Nocturne(1967) and Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968), starlets Cheng Pei Pei and Li Ching look like Marlo Thomas! If That Girl had stayed on the air until 1979, we'd see Ann and Donald dancing to disco music or seeing a screening of Star Wars(1977)! I guess it was good that the show ended in 1971. By 1971, Marlo Thomas wanted to move on to other projects. She was in the drama Jenny(1970). She was in the It's a Wonderful Life remake. She made an uncredited cameo in Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalow(1999). Ted Bessell died in the mid 1990's. He wanted to direct a That Girl movie. He was also in a short lived TV show where Patty Duke played a female U.S. President in an alternate timeline. That Girl was spoofed on SNL, The Nanny and Animaniacs.

Beyond  the new Marlo Thomas hairstyle (yuck!) and the fact that her dad was in few episodes (replaced it seems by Don's boss with more focus on his workplace) was the attempt by the writers to make the show ""hip"" by doing contemporary topics instead of character comedy. The result is that there are full episodes with nothing funny about them, especially the closer they get to the end.It is filled with guest stars who are usually misused (Joe Flynn as Lew's brother? Seriously?). Look for Jennifer Aniston's dad in one episode, which is ironic since Marlo went on to play Jennifer's mom on Friends!By the time it gets to the final episodes (about a bachelor party, horse racing and Ann picketing Newsview with an ecology group) Marlo Thomas is overacting to the point of hysteria, saying lines that are stupid and not funny.

1222214,AF56EQJXPK0S9,B001O4KBP0,Mr. O,"[0, 0]","Right now I am still on season 4. I haven't gotten to 5 yet but, each season that I have purchased has turned out to be fine. In fact, everything from Amazon for me has been on the money thus far. So I am confident that the conditions of these discs are just fine as always.As far as the show is concerned, I grew up with this and have always loved Marlo Thomas. It was the favorite show of my favorite aunt at that time. Also, this is from a time when television was a good, good place to visit. A time when TV was a good baby sitter and a good communicator. Even a good educational tool. The show was well written and the people truly had talent. It also shows the mod of the times that had hit the US with the British invasion. What some people don't know is that before something came to be all the rage here it was in the UK first. And Marlo brought all of that from London to the United States on this show. It was also one of the first shows on television that would feature a relationship that was totally platonic, at a time when television was a good clean place for the family to be.I had always missed this show and I thought it to be lost forever. But thankfully, I have it and can watch it at any time I wish. And so I watch it the way it was aired back in 1966. One episode a week. And this way I know that it will last me a long time before I have to do the re-run thing. And there are so many other shows of that time that I am currently buying as they become available.The 1960's and 70's I think were the best times of television. It was still somewhat new, since it had only become available to the consumer in and around 1950. The censors were ever present and made sure that there was nothing there that might be considered offensive or inappropriate for children. It was the time before cable would come and really ruin many things about something that should have remained wholesome and clean for children and the family.",5,"I just love ""That Girl""!",1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1945,"['Right', 'now', 'am', 'still', 'season', '4', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', '5', 'yet', 'season', 'have', 'purchased', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fine', 'fact', 'everything', 'Amazon', 'been', 'money', 'thus', 'far', 'am', 'confident', 'conditions', 'discs', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'always.As', 'far', 'show', 'concerned', 'grew', 'up', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'was', 'favorite', 'show', 'favorite', 'aunt', 'time', 'Also', 'time', 'when', 'television', 'was', 'good', 'good', 'place', 'visit', 'time', 'when', 'TV', 'was', 'good', 'baby', 'sitter', 'good', 'communicator', 'Even', 'good', 'educational', 'tool', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'people', 'truly', 'had', 'talent', 'also', 'mod', 'times', 'had', 'hit', 'US', 'British', 'invasion', 'What', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'something', 'came', 'be', 'rage', 'here', 'was', 'UK', 'first', 'Marlo', 'brought', 'London', 'United', 'States', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'television', 'would', 'feature', 'relationship', 'was', 'totally', 'platonic', 'time', 'when', 'television', 'was', 'good', 'clean', 'place', 'family', 'be.I', 'had', 'always', 'missed', 'show', 'thought', 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'thankfully', 'have', 'can', 'watch', 'time', 'wish', 'so', 'watch', 'way', 'was', 'aired', 'back', '1966', 'One', 'episode', 'week', 'way', 'know', 'will', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'do', 're-run', 'thing', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'am', 'currently', 'buying', 'become', 'available.The', '1960', '70', 'think', 'were', 'best', 'times', 'television', 'was', 'still', 'somewhat', 'new', 'had', 'only', 'become', 'available', 'consumer', '1950', 'censors', 'were', 'ever', 'present', 'made', 'sure', 'was', 'nothing', 'there', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'offensive', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'was', 'time', 'cable', 'would', 'come', 'really', 'ruin', 'many', 'things', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'wholesome', 'clean', 'children', 'family']",That Girl: Season 5

1222216,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B001O4KBP0,Retro Pixie,"[1, 1]","The old adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" should have been applied to ""That Girl"" in its final season.  After four glorious seasons of Ann Marie's (Marlo Thomas) innocence, puppy-like zest for life and hope-springs-eternal attitude, there were changes galore for ""That Girl.""In this fifth season,1970/71, Ann's hair is different; gone are the trademark bangs, Donald's hair is longer, they add lyrics to the theme song, Ann has become more politically conscious with stories focusing on racism, feminism and the environment.  And in the midst of it all, Don and Ann get engaged.  Why I'm not sure, since Marlo Thomas was adamant that the show not end with a wedding...which it doesn't.  The engagement almost depresses me, since it seems to cause more arguments than good times.Don't get me wrong; there are still a few cute episodes, but for the most part this season has such a different feel.  Some of these episodes aren't that funny to me.  The worst of the lot being the final episode; they certainly went out with a whimper.""That Girl"" should have never been about anyone's social consciousness or opinions; it just should have always been about what they gave us for the first four years - lighthearted fun.  The message was clear without beating us over the head.  This was an independent young woman making it on her own...and it was done with joy, not preaching.Guest stars in this season include:  Danny Thomas, Cloris Leachman, Milton Berle and Regis Philbin.The DVD quality is good for all 24 episodes.  The only bonus extra is audio commentary by Marlo and series co-creator Bill Persky.  Anyone who has listened to this on previous seasons knows that it's akin to watching paint dry.  Marlo has many talents, but commenting on her own show seems to stump her.It's a personal judgment call on whether to get the final season.  I wanted it, because there are still a few entertaining moments and this show was so important to me in my childhood.  Others may not want to spend the money, because this season doesn't follow true to form.

1222218,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001O4KBP0,trebe,"[1, 2]","In the four years since moving to New York City, Ann Marie had come a long way, and star Marlo Thomas, decided that the fifth season of That Girl would be the last.  Opening with a new theme song with lyrics, it is clear from the jump, that things have changed significantly, as in the season opener ""Counter-Proposal"", Ann's boyfriend Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell) proposes marriage.With the loving couple now engaged, many of the episodes are concerned with their impending nuptials, which provides the opportunity to see whole new sides of the characters.  A more confident Ann, seems less concerned with finding a job that would make her famous.  Things remain mostly light, but one of the most emotionally touching episodes is ""A Limited Engagement"", where Donald expresses reservations about getting married.  As always, Ann's father Lew Marie (Lew Parker) is there to support his daughter, until Don comes to his senses.Another highlight is ""Those Friars"", which features showbiz legends Milton Berle, and Danny Thomas, performing in a show with Ann Marie.  Based on an actual event, ""Super Reporter"" is a memorable episode that features Don wearing a kooky superhero costume, as he is about to receive a writing award.In ""That King"" Ann meets a young boy who is the ruler of a foreign country, and then gets involved in a diplomatic incident.  Ann's face appears on another woman's body in a magazine centerfold, in ""I Ain't Got No Body"".  And the ever helpful Ann, unwittingly robs the department store where she is employed, in ""That Shoplifter"".After appearing just twice in Season Four, Bernie Kopell makes a prominent return as Don's best friend and co-worker Jerry Bauman, appearing in 8 of the 24 episodes.  Newcomer Alice Borden becomes the third actress to play Ruth Bauman, while James Gregory has a reoccurring role as Mr. Adams, Don't boss at Newsview magazine.  Sadly, Rosemary De Camp, who played Ann's mother for four seasons, is completely absent in Season Five, so Ann never gets to share the experience of being engaged with her mom.Marlo Thomas was adamant that the series would close without the traditional storybook ending that so many were hoping for, a marriage between Ann and Don.  While Thomas is to be admired for her principles, the series ends with a thud, rather than on an enthusiastic high.Although never too heavy handed, That Girl continued to deal with social matters, exploring the issues of racial stereotypes, women's liberation, gender roles, ageism, and environmental concerns.  Writers Saul Turtletaub and Bernie Orenstein assumed creative control of the writing in Season 4, and while the program did venture into new territories, the quality of their writing was spotty.  Being men, they did not have the same sensibilities as Ruth Brooks Flippen, the script consultant in the second and third seasons.  Responsible for writing about half the episodes in Season Five, Turtletaub and Orenstein deliver some absolute winners like ""A Limited Engagement"", and ""Counter-Proposal"", but also produced some rather mediocre stories, particularly the series closer ""The Elevated Woman"", which features a series of flashbacks from episodes in Season One, and has Ann questioning Don's devotion to her.  After five years, it's a pretty weak way to conclude this wonderful series.Shout Factory's release maintains the same packaging motif, but with some softness, and less than vibrant colors, image quality isn't as good as the earlier seasons.  The only extra is a single commentary featuring Thomas and co-creator Bill Persky.  Unfortunately after five seasons, they still seem unaware of what most fans are looking for in a commentary track.With a gutsy Marlo Thomas shouldering much of the responsibility, That Girl contributed greatly to the evolution of women's roles on television, blazing a trail that other programs would follow.  Thomas and Ted Bessell (1935-1996) were absolutely wonderful together, and the romance between Ann and Don that began with a magical sense of innocence, matured into one characterized by understanding and love.  Poised to enter a new phase in life, Ann Marie was no longer that naive girl from Brewster, with stars in her eyes, but had come as far as Marlo Thomas was prepared to go.  Definitely ahead of her time, Thomas achieved much, both as a very talented actress, and as feminist role model who perhaps has yet to receive the recognition she is due.",4,"the trailblazing That Girl, remains unconventional to the end...",1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,4436,"['four', 'years', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'had', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'star', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'decided', 'fifth', 'season', 'Girl', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'Opening', 'new', 'theme', 'song', 'lyrics', 'clear', 'jump', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'significantly', 'season', 'Counter-Proposal', 'Ann', 'boyfriend', 'Donald', 'Hollinger', 'Ted', 'Bessell', 'marriage.With', 'loving', 'couple', 'now', 'engaged', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'concerned', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'opportunity', 'see', 'whole', 'new', 'sides', 'characters', 'more', 'confident', 'Ann', 'less', 'concerned', 'finding', 'job', 'would', 'make', 'famous', 'Things', 'remain', 'mostly', 'light', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'episodes', 'A', 'Limited', 'Engagement', 'where', 'Donald', 'reservations', 'getting', 'married', 'always', 'Ann', 'father', 'Lew', 'Marie', 'Lew', 'Parker', 'there', 'support', 'daughter', 'Don', 'senses.Another', 'highlight', 'Friars', 'showbiz', 'legends', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'performing', 'show', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Based', 'actual', 'event', 'Super', 'Reporter', 'memorable', 'episode', 'Don', 'wearing', 'kooky', 'superhero', 'costume', 'receive', 'writing', 'award.In', 'King', 'Ann', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'ruler', 'foreign', 'country', 'then', 'involved', 'diplomatic', 'incident', 'Ann', 'face', 'woman', 'body', 'magazine', 'centerfold', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Got', 'No', 'Body', 'ever', 'helpful', 'Ann', 'unwittingly', 'department', 'store', 'where', 'employed', 'Shoplifter', '.After', 'appearing', 'just', 'twice', 'Season', 'Four', 'Bernie', 'Kopell', 'prominent', 'return', 'Don', 'best', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'Jerry', 'Bauman', 'appearing', '8', '24', 'episodes', 'Newcomer', 'Alice', 'Borden', 'third', 'actress', 'play', 'Ruth', 'Bauman', 'James', 'Gregory', 'reoccurring', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'Do', ""n't"", 'boss', 'Newsview', 'magazine', 'Sadly', 'Rosemary', 'De', 'Camp', 'who', 'played', 'Ann', 'mother', 'four', 'seasons', 'completely', 'absent', 'Season', 'Five', 'so', 'Ann', 'never', 'share', 'experience', 'being', 'engaged', 'mom.Marlo', 'Thomas', 'was', 'adamant', 'series', 'would', 'close', 'traditional', 'storybook', 'ending', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'hoping', 'marriage', 'Ann', 'Don', 'Thomas', 'be', 'admired', 'principles', 'series', 'thud', 'rather', 'enthusiastic', 'high.Although', 'never', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Girl', 'continued', 'deal', 'social', 'matters', 'exploring', 'issues', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'women', 'liberation', 'gender', 'roles', 'ageism', 'environmental', 'concerns', 'Writers', 'Saul', 'Turtletaub', 'Bernie', 'Orenstein', 'assumed', 'creative', 'control', 'writing', 'Season', '4', 'program', 'did', 'venture', 'new', 'territories', 'quality', 'writing', 'was', 'spotty', 'Being', 'men', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'sensibilities', 'Ruth', 'Brooks', 'Flippen', 'script', 'consultant', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'Responsible', 'writing', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Five', 'Turtletaub', 'Orenstein', 'deliver', 'absolute', 'winners', 'A', 'Limited', 'Engagement', 'Counter-Proposal', 'also', 'produced', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'stories', 'particularly', 'series', 'closer', 'Elevated', 'Woman', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'Ann', 'questioning', 'Don', 'devotion', 'five', 'years', 'pretty', 'weak', 'way', 'conclude', 'wonderful', 'series.Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'same', 'packaging', 'motif', 'softness', 'less', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'image', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'only', 'extra', 'single', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'Thomas', 'co-creator', 'Bill', 'Persky', 'Unfortunately', 'five', 'seasons', 'still', 'seem', 'unaware', 'what', 'most', 'fans', 'are', 'looking', 'commentary', 'track.With', 'gutsy', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'shouldering', 'much', 'responsibility', 'Girl', 'contributed', 'greatly', 'evolution', 'women', 'roles', 'television', 'blazing', 'trail', 'other', 'programs', 'would', 'follow', 'Thomas', 'Ted', 'Bessell', '1935-1996', 'were', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'together', 'romance', 'Ann', 'Don', 'began', 'magical', 'sense', 'innocence', 'matured', 'one', 'characterized', 'understanding', 'love', 'Poised', 'enter', 'new', 'phase', 'life', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'was', 'longer', 'naive', 'girl', 'Brewster', 'stars', 'eyes', 'had', 'come', 'as', 'far', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'was', 'prepared', 'go', 'Definitely', 'ahead', 'time', 'Thomas', 'achieved', 'much', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'feminist', 'role', 'model', 'who', 'perhaps', 'yet', 'receive', 'recognition', 'due']",That Girl: Season 5

I think we all know this is a TV show while watching but to me they are as legit a couple as you will ever find on TV.. and beyond. The amount of dialogue learned for some episodes is often staggering, check out Counter Proposal the first episode of the season.. the exhaustive explanation Ann gives for not wanting to see the price or her ring and the ways around that are simply marvelous! Another plus is Shout factories continued consistent packaging and not skimping on the extras just because this is a final season. Plus the scripts are still often fairly strong for a 5th season; That Script, Counter Proposal, and Uncle Herbert come to mind.-ChipsWhere on earth did they get the crazy notion for a theme song change to this degree? I am a fan of music of this era but I have to say the new theme song is horrendous! I'm not really crazy about Ann's new shaggy mop. The show benefits from a certain innocence and looking at Ann's mop sort of reminds me of the real world of this era.. hard to explain. Lastly, I have to mention the major flop of 'That Senorita', wow, just painful to watch. The script is overly PC and poorly acted imo and tries to make a point on racial stereo-types and the very next episode they meet Uncle Herbert at the airport and are greeting by Asian tourists who all take pictures of each other. I thought it was hilarious but out of step with the message of the previous episode.",4,+Chaps and -Chips!
