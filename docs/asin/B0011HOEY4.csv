Shot the old-fashioned way, the film brought three films to my mind:  `The French Connection,' `The Godfather,' and `Serpico'.  They don't make `em like they used to, but Scott really resurrects the seventies in this true tale story of Black organized crime--never told quite this way in movies to my mind.  Even the details are transporting:  the Nixon and Vietnam broadcasts, Muhammad Ali on a small black and white television, and newly acquired microwaves take us to Harlem and connecting places during that time.Frank Lewis (Denzel Washington) is smart.  His boss, Bumpy, passed away with much fanfare, but gives Frank, his former driver and apprentice, a chance to fill his shoes.  Knowing how keep inconspicuous, Frank goes about life business as usual.  He is flanked by celebrities and knows to stay away from his heroin operation unless absolutely necessary.  Some of the tensest scenes come from confrontations he has with others who draw too much attention to themselves, and much of the violence is on a par with 'Goodfellas'.On his trail without knowing it, is Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), an officer going to school to become a lawyer.  He has everything stacked against him.  Like Serpico he refuses to take money from bribes or drug busts, which is very tempting since he has to go to court over custody of his son.  His partner seems to go along with him until it is revealed that he is doing drug busts to benefit from the graft.  Trying to revamp the entire Drug Enforcement Agency, Richie must face a dishonest fellow officer from New Jersey (Josh Brolin) who as a top drug enforcement official, gains the most from bribes that keep the drug operation on the street.  Trying to find new fellow recruits (like John Hawke) that are both honest and competent is a trial in itself.To keep even more unassuming, Frank makes his own connections to Bankok, where he notes heroin is the purest and a connection is stationed in Vietnam.  Noting also that there is a high addiction rate among soldiers helps him to smuggle the smack with relative ease.  Also learning a business principle from an appliance store, Frank eliminates the middle man--in more ways than one.  This maneuvering also gives Frank more leverage when negotiating with the Italian Mafia, whom he reduces in revenue and importance.Besides an intricate story, Ridley Scott offers the best aspects of celebrated seventies movies.  Denzel Washington is as smooth as ever, and Russell Crowe, Josh Brolin, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are in fine form, especially comparing their other roles this year in '3:10 to Yuma,' `No Country for Old Men,' and  `Talk to Me' respectively.When Frank's family leaves church with the sounds of ""Amazing Grace,"" one can't help but think of `The Godfather' where Michael Carleone (Al Pacino) witnesses his son's baptism as scenes of blood and violence interrupt the images of stained glass and solace in the church.  One of the great draws of this film is how it demonstrates so many ironies working together in one true life gangster story. Just like `Traffic` before it, `American Gangster' offers that supply and demand is a mighty tool that can make or break people's lives.  As Frank himself says, ""Either you're somebody or you're nobody.""  What I liked so much about the film is that even with the grim contrast between haves and have nots, the movie left me with hope, which is a good way to leave a film.

I only gave my review that title because of how Denzel's character takes over the territory and whacks out the previous gangster who held it over 20%!! Wow!Never get to cocky when a man has a gun to your head!I am a fan of the good old mafia movies, but this movie is slightly different in the sense that Denzel's character has to climb his way to the top of the crime world, but the most enjoyable things about this movie is that it shows even the hardest of criminals as real people with real problems that you can't help find yourself sympathizing with! Yet there iso ne scene where I couldn't help find myself hating Denzel's character where there is an ODed woman on the bed an baby sitting next to her crying... scared because mommy isn't moving anymore!!Not too much blood, gore and murder in this one for a gangster movie, but there are a lot of graphic drug abuse scenes that really made me cringe! (I'm the type of person that isn't really bothered with blood and gore scenes, yet these made me cringe). A pretty graphic nudity scene in there too with the ladies working on processing the heroin! But, the rating on the movie should be a clear warning to all, and now you know what to watch out for.A very touching story, even more so because it is based on true events that took place!

1131249,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B0011HOEY4,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[0, 0]","This movie weighs in at two hours and thirty eight minutes and for most of that time I was glued to the screen. It's a classic story of the lone honest cop tracking down the powerful gang boss, but with a twist.Denzel Washington, mezmerizing as always, plays a man who builds a powerful drug trafficking empire, smuggling drugs direct from Vietnam using U.S. military personnel and planes to ship the pure heroin to the streets of New York. Washington loves his mama, dresses in expensive suits, looks after his family and pursues the American dream. He is also ruthless, prepared to shoot a rival in the head in the middle of a crowded Harlem street in broad daylight without fearing anyone would testify against him.The twist is his character's assertion that what he is doing is nothing more or less than pure American capitalism. He has a business to run and he runs it. He becomes rich -- but that is no more than the legitimate and just reward for his enterprise. ""This is America,"" he says at one point. And the fact is that the police, with the exception of the Russell Crowe character, are just as corrupt as the criminals, all on the take and making their own living from the drugs trade.I should add here that I was a little nervous about watching this film because I have a low threshhold for screen violence. But there isn't much violence, those scenes that are included are necessary to the plot and the camera does not dwell on them too much.The movie falters a little in its final 20 minutes which consist of an extended coda after the climactic scene. However, in general this is first-class entertainment which should also raise a few questions in viewers' minds as well.",4,Quite riveting with interesting comment on America,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,1689,"['movie', 'two', 'hours', 'thirty', 'eight', 'minutes', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'classic', 'story', 'lone', 'honest', 'cop', 'tracking', 'down', 'powerful', 'gang', 'boss', 'twist.Denzel', 'Washington', 'mezmerizing', 'always', 'man', 'who', 'powerful', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'empire', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'direct', 'Vietnam', 'using', 'U.S.', 'military', 'personnel', 'planes', 'ship', 'pure', 'heroin', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Washington', 'mama', 'expensive', 'suits', 'family', 'American', 'dream', 'also', 'ruthless', 'prepared', 'shoot', 'rival', 'head', 'middle', 'crowded', 'Harlem', 'street', 'broad', 'daylight', 'fearing', 'anyone', 'would', 'testify', 'him.The', 'twist', 'character', 'assertion', 'what', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'pure', 'American', 'capitalism', 'business', 'run', 'rich', 'more', 'legitimate', 'just', 'reward', 'enterprise', 'America', 'one', 'point', 'fact', 'police', 'exception', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'character', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'corrupt', 'criminals', 'take', 'making', 'own', 'living', 'drugs', 'trade.I', 'should', 'add', 'here', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'low', 'threshhold', 'screen', 'violence', ""n't"", 'much', 'violence', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'necessary', 'plot', 'camera', 'not', 'dwell', 'too', 'much.The', 'movie', 'little', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'consist', 'extended', 'coda', 'climactic', 'scene', 'However', 'general', 'first-class', 'entertainment', 'should', 'also', 'raise', 'few', 'questions', 'viewers', 'minds', 'well']",American Gangster
1131250,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B0011HOEY4,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 0]",I finally got a chance to see this movie in full for the first time last night and I have to say not only was the well done but to think a story like this acautly took lace in real life is amazing to me. Something like this going on today you could never see it happing but this was truly a great movie to me. One of the things that helped sell this movie to me even more was the fact that the was the movie was set up it made it belivable that this took place back in the 1960's and 1970's. Denzel Washington and Russel Crow played there parts so well in this movie. Two totally opposite characters but they deserved to be in the roll they were in during this movie. The movie is interesting as Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington does not have allot of money at this point but once his idol Bumpy Johnson dies he decicides to take over his position. It is truly an amazing story because back in the time American was a very racist country so no one belived that a black man like this had this much power. Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) has recently had allot of problems with his wife and is going through a divorce. This whole situation makes it seem like he is even more focused on cataching the people that are bringing heroine into this country. The movie is really long so you have to be able to sit down and pay attention becasue while it is not super confusing it involves your attention becasuse there is a decent ammount of stuff going on. At the end the ending is what it had to be beause it was based on a true story but I would have like a different ending for schock value. It is interesting that Russel Crow represented Denzel Washingtons character in this movie and in real life for the trial and at least the way the movie is portrayled when Frank Lucas gets out Richie Roberts is there to meet and great him. I have to go high on this movie because it was based on a true story. I have to go with 4.5/5 and a strong recomendation to pick the DVD up. I am going to round it up for my star rating because it deserves better then a 4 on here. Great stuff and I have not even got a chance to check out the special features yet.,5,A great real life story turned into a movie that you wont want to turn off,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,2136,"['finally', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'full', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'think', 'story', 'acautly', 'took', 'lace', 'real', 'life', 'amazing', 'Something', 'going', 'today', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'happing', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'One', 'things', 'helped', 'sell', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'made', 'belivable', 'took', 'place', 'back', '1960', '1970', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Russel', 'Crow', 'played', 'parts', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'Two', 'totally', 'opposite', 'characters', 'deserved', 'be', 'roll', 'were', 'movie', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'not', 'have', 'allot', 'money', 'point', 'once', 'idol', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'take', 'over', 'position', 'truly', 'amazing', 'story', 'back', 'time', 'American', 'was', 'very', 'racist', 'country', 'so', 'one', 'belived', 'black', 'man', 'had', 'much', 'power', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'recently', 'had', 'allot', 'problems', 'wife', 'going', 'divorce', 'whole', 'situation', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'focused', 'cataching', 'people', 'are', 'bringing', 'heroine', 'country', 'movie', 'really', 'long', 'so', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'down', 'pay', 'attention', 'becasue', 'not', 'super', 'confusing', 'attention', 'decent', 'ammount', 'stuff', 'going', 'end', 'ending', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'different', 'ending', 'schock', 'value', 'interesting', 'Russel', 'Crow', 'represented', 'Denzel', 'Washingtons', 'character', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'trial', 'least', 'way', 'movie', 'portrayled', 'when', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'out', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'there', 'meet', 'great', 'have', 'go', 'high', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'go', '4.5/5', 'strong', 'recomendation', 'pick', 'DVD', 'up', 'am', 'going', 'round', 'up', 'star', 'rating', 'better', 'then', '4', 'here', 'Great', 'stuff', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'got', 'chance', 'check', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'yet']",American Gangster
1131251,AK0CENM3LUM28,B0011HOEY4,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","American Gangster (Blu-Ray) / B001EIOOVS*Spoilers*This is a fascinating movie, something akin to the Godfather series, but with a serious and critical look at police misconduct. I cannot say with any authority how accurate this movie is, in comparison with the actual history, but the drama here is fantastic and worth taking in.American Gangster is the story of a poor Harlem black man who takes over the business and leadership of the area's most influential and recently deceased small-time crime lord, and builds a drug empire with his own two hands. Drugs are shipped in directly from Vietnam, via military planes, and are flooded onto the streets at high purities and low prices. And in the midst of all this, corrupt police simultaneously threaten and protect the drug dealers, working the system to milk it for all it is worth.There are several things I like about this movie, several points that undermine popular Hollywood conventions. Frank Lucas is not presented as an oppressed angel, nor as a lionized dark hero. He is a character with control and caution, but this control is not deemed as a virtue, and it is made clear than violence simmers under the surface, when he attacks employees and family members who have foolishly failed to adopt his careful control. And Richie Roberts, our intrepid detective, is presented  carefully, with plenty of flaws. Rather than use his numerous affairs to build up his character as a 'real' man, it is made clear that he is a somewhat shallow human being, who cares more about winning than about his son, and who does not cut off contacts with known criminals who are old friends.I appreciate that this movie is careful to show the casualties of the drug empire built by Frank Lucas. Unlike The Godfather (which I am fond of, make no mistake), where you rarely remember (or care) what the family is selling, you never forget that Lucas is selling hard drugs. And no matter where you stand on legalization, you recognize that flooding a market used to 5% purity with a product that is nearly 100% purity, and without warning, is going to result in some pretty gruesome overdoses. And it does.In the end, though, what I like most about this movie is that Roberts isn't just interested in the drug dealers - he wants the crooked cops, too. He recognizes that crooked cops are a danger to society and a smirch on his own standing as a cop, and he works within the system to improve the system. And that is something we need more of, both in real life and from Hollywood.This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account. I enjoy the movie immensely and am considering purchasing a copy for my home library.",4,American Justice,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,2754,"['American', 'Gangster', 'Blu-Ray', '/', 'B001EIOOVS*Spoilers*This', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'something', 'akin', 'Godfather', 'series', 'serious', 'critical', 'look', 'police', 'misconduct', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'authority', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'comparison', 'actual', 'history', 'drama', 'here', 'fantastic', 'worth', 'taking', 'in.American', 'Gangster', 'story', 'poor', 'Harlem', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'business', 'leadership', 'area', 'most', 'influential', 'recently', 'deceased', 'small-time', 'crime', 'lord', 'drug', 'empire', 'own', 'two', 'hands', 'Drugs', 'are', 'shipped', 'directly', 'Vietnam', 'military', 'planes', 'are', 'flooded', 'streets', 'high', 'purities', 'low', 'prices', 'midst', 'corrupt', 'police', 'simultaneously', 'threaten', 'protect', 'drug', 'dealers', 'working', 'system', 'milk', 'worth.There', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'several', 'points', 'undermine', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'not', 'presented', 'oppressed', 'angel', 'lionized', 'dark', 'hero', 'character', 'control', 'caution', 'control', 'not', 'deemed', 'virtue', 'made', 'clear', 'violence', 'simmers', 'surface', 'when', 'employees', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'foolishly', 'failed', 'adopt', 'careful', 'control', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'intrepid', 'detective', 'presented', 'carefully', 'plenty', 'flaws', 'Rather', 'use', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'build', 'up', 'character', ""'real"", 'man', 'made', 'clear', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'more', 'winning', 'son', 'who', 'not', 'cut', 'off', 'contacts', 'known', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'friends.I', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'careful', 'show', 'casualties', 'drug', 'empire', 'built', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Godfather', 'am', 'fond', 'make', 'mistake', 'where', 'rarely', 'remember', 'care', 'what', 'family', 'selling', 'never', 'forget', 'Lucas', 'selling', 'hard', 'drugs', 'matter', 'where', 'stand', 'legalization', 'recognize', 'flooding', 'market', 'used', '5', '%', 'purity', 'product', 'nearly', '100', '%', 'purity', 'warning', 'going', 'result', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'overdoses', 'end', 'though', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'movie', 'Roberts', ""n't"", 'just', 'interested', 'drug', 'dealers', 'crooked', 'cops', 'too', 'crooked', 'cops', 'are', 'danger', 'society', 'smirch', 'own', 'standing', 'cop', 'system', 'improve', 'system', 'something', 'need', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'Hollywood.This', 'version', 'closed', 'caption', 'option', 'hard', 'hearing', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'movie', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'Online', 'account', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'immensely', 'am', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'copy', 'home', 'library']",American Gangster
1131252,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,B0011HOEY4,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[1, 2]","First off this is a great film and well worth seeing at the big screen.  The acting was good and the period feel was well done.  Enough said.I don't like to rehash plot or write spoilers, so here's why this is a must see film:It clearly shows why the America war on drugs is a losing battle and fraught with evils greater than the disease.  Much like the movie Traffic showed (and Blow, Scar Face, etc.) the drug world is ugly and it's not going away not matter what governments do; in fact, governments usually just make things worse.The Russell Crow character points out in the film (okay a bit of a spoiler here) that maybe the government really doesn't want to eradicate drugs; too many jobs are at stake.Sure things aren't so bad in the police department as they were in the 1970's, crime is down, two thirds of drug enforcement cops aren't on the take like they were in New York during the period of the film, however I live in Orange County California and the top sheriff just got indicted by the feds.  Power and money still corrupt even in the twenty first century, even in white professional (O.C.

1131255,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B0011HOEY4,Andrew Desmond,"[0, 2]","""American Gangster"" is a powerful film.  The cast is exemplary and wonderfully led by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  It has been apparently overlooked for Oscar nominations and this is both a surprise and a mistake.The film is set in the late sixties and early seventies and covers police corruption in the exercise of drug enforcement in the New York City area.  The apex of this corruption is Frank Lucas, as played by Denzel Washington, who is a smooth but thoroughly brutal importer of heroin directly from the golden triangle.  He distributes favours and skilfully supports a web of personnel based mainly in Harlem.  He manages to largely slide under the radar until he is spotted in ring side seats at the Ali versus Frazier fight in Madison Square Garden.  How is this ""no one"" able to have such a seat?  Who is he?  It is at this point that his world begins to unravel.The forces for law are led by Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, who is an apparently incorruptible cop based in New Jersey.  He is relentless in his pursuit of Lucas even though this has personal consequences.  In the end, he gets his man.  He also manages to implicate a vast swathe of his fellow law enforcers.  Lucas's network extends far and deep.I found this film to be absolutely enthralling.  It moves languidly until interspersed and confronting violence drags the viewer's attention back to the forces at work.  Washington and Crowe are great in their roles.  The support cast is commendable and the soundtrack is powerful as it evokes images of the late sixties and the era of Vietnam against which backdrop the film evolves.  I can thoroughly recommend this film.",5,Powerful and Compelling,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1666,"['American', 'Gangster', 'powerful', 'film', 'cast', 'exemplary', 'wonderfully', 'led', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'been', 'apparently', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'surprise', 'mistake.The', 'film', 'set', 'late', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'covers', 'police', 'corruption', 'exercise', 'drug', 'enforcement', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'area', 'apex', 'corruption', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'smooth', 'thoroughly', 'brutal', 'importer', 'heroin', 'directly', 'golden', 'triangle', 'favours', 'skilfully', 'web', 'personnel', 'based', 'mainly', 'Harlem', 'largely', 'slide', 'radar', 'spotted', 'ring', 'side', 'seats', 'Ali', 'versus', 'Frazier', 'fight', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'How', 'one', 'able', 'have', 'such', 'seat', 'Who', 'point', 'world', 'unravel.The', 'forces', 'law', 'are', 'led', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'apparently', 'incorruptible', 'cop', 'based', 'New', 'Jersey', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'Lucas', 'even', 'personal', 'consequences', 'end', 'man', 'also', 'implicate', 'vast', 'swathe', 'fellow', 'law', 'enforcers', 'Lucas', 'network', 'far', 'deep.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'absolutely', 'enthralling', 'languidly', 'interspersed', 'confronting', 'violence', 'viewer', 'attention', 'back', 'forces', 'work', 'Washington', 'Crowe', 'are', 'great', 'roles', 'support', 'cast', 'commendable', 'soundtrack', 'powerful', 'images', 'late', 'sixties', 'era', 'Vietnam', 'backdrop', 'film', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'film']",American Gangster
1131256,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0011HOEY4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","As a huge fan of Russell Crowe (I don't even know if the word `huge' can really relay how much I do absolutely love this man) I obviously had to see `American Gangster'.  It was just a huge plus to have greats like Denzel Washington and the under-seen Josh Brolin (what a breakout year for him this was) included in the cast.  I mentioned this movie a bit when reviewing the stunning `Zodiac' and while their similarities are few I can see why some would link the two together.  They both utilize lengthened scenes to enhance a moody atmosphere, `Zodiac' leaning towards the creepy unsettling feeling of never catching the bad guy (whom they never catch) but `American Gangster' uses these scenes and apparent slowed pace and long running time to accomplish something else, fuller characters.  I think that's probably the one thing that I loved most about `American Gangster' is that by the time the credits began to role I felt as if I knew everyone, even those with few scenes, those with limited speaking lines; I still felt as though I knew them inside and out.Many have noted that `American Gangster' brings nothing `new' to the table; that it adds nothing to the crime genre but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  `American Gangster' may, in the sense of plot formula, add nothing new but it does take that `same old same' and add layers of class.  `American Gangster' feels so genuine; it feels so realistic, gritty and raw that you feel as though you are walking the streets with drug kingpin Frank Lucas.  The wardrobe (I feel weird calling them costumes), the music, the buildings; even the way the actors walk all bring to life the time in which the film takes place.  Everything is spot on authentic and genuinely engaging.I feel a need to defend this film because so many have attacked it for the buzz and accolades that it has garnered.  Many feel pressured to compare this to last year's megastar `The Departed' and this serves as a disservice to `American Gangster' because it substitutes to glitter and Hollywood glam of `The Departed' for grit.  `American Gangster' feels like an older film.  This is a positive in my book but some have turned this into a negative.  The other problem many have with `American Gangster' is that it didn't prove to be `Training Day Part II' as many had hoped it would be.  Denzel Washington does not reenact his Oscar Winning role here but is much more subtle and reserved.  I have my reservations about his performance which I will get to in a minute but in my defense of this I will say that Frank Lucas is not Alonzo and it's unfair to expect him to be.  Neither of these complaints carries much weight with me for they take nothing away from the film in general.`American Gangster', as many are probably privy to already, follows drug lord Frank Lucas' rise to infamy in the Harlem underworld.  It also tracks his pursuit by Detective Richie Roberts.  It almost plays as two films, two companion pieces.  We have Frank Lucas building his drug empire, amassing great wealth and prestige and then we have Richie Roberts falling out among his peers and losing his family life but retaining his conscience as he works to incarcerate Lucas.  Lucas and Roberts have their own sets of demons but they share some enemies, namely the crooked cops that permeate the area.The cast is extensive and for the most part marvelous.  Josh Brolin sizzles as crooked Detective Trupo.  I've been a fan of Brolin's for a while and I am so happy that this year he was given the opportunity to embrace his acting talents and take off so-to-speak.  Ejiofor also delivers a great performance as Lucas' brother Huey.  He's sorely underused but what he contributes is memorable.  In fact his few scenes had me wishing he would have been cast as Frank instead of Washington, but I'll get to that in a minute.  RZA, Common and T.I. take a break from rapping to act and all do well.  Cameo performances like that from Cuba Gooding Jr. and the sensational Ruby Dee are also captivating.  I was wondering what happened to Cuba and I was glad to see him embrace his few moments of screen time to give us a memorable cameo, but it was Ruby Dee who delivered one of the most powerful performances in the film.  I don't even think you can call what she did acting.  The way she let her hands grab her knees in excitement or the way she trembled in frustration you felt her emotions so purely, so naturally.But this movie of course has two bigger stars battling it out for your attention; Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  Well, to be completely honest, and I say this with no bias, Russell Crowe is the champ here.  Denzel just doesn't grasp who this man is.  Yes, Lucas was a man that believed in a low key profile, a man who stayed purposely out of the limelight so as not to attract the kind of attention you don't want but Denzel takes this too an extreme he didn't need to take it.  He never let his charisma shine.  In some of his final scenes alongside Crowe (in the interrogation room for instance) we get a glimpse of the sarcastic and confident side of Lucas and it made me angry that Washington waited until the very end to show us what he could have done all along.  He has his moments (mostly with regard to his brothers) where he dominates his character and delivers beautiful scenes but for the most part he was kind of boring.  Crowe on the other hand masterfully got inside Richie to flesh out his demons and his admirable qualities and always did so with charm and in a manor that drew you to him.  You wanted to watch him.  Crowe had such a knockout year with this and `3:10 to Yuma' under his belt that it makes his Oscar snub so undeniably heartbreaking.  Crowe's ability to lose himself inside his characters is one of the many things I love about him.In the end I feel that `American Gangster' is a very strong film, a film that stands on its own merits and delivers beautifully.  Is it the best film out this year?  No, but it's far from the worst.  In fact it's a very solid film that manages to engage it's audience and deliver thrills, chills and that feeling of satisfaction we receive when we watch something that truly entertains.  This feeling is all thanks to the marvelous Ridley Scott who just adds yet another mastered genre to his resume.  Scott is probably one of our greatest American Directors working today.  He's taken genre after genre (unlike some who never leave their comfort zone) and delivered consistently solid work.  From swords and sandals epics to war films to sci-fi horror films to cross country dramas to the gangster film Scott has stamped his signature mark on modern cinema with flair and perfection.  Please, someone, give him his Oscar.",5,"Dark, gritty and raw; this gangster hits his mark...",1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,6720,"['huge', 'fan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know',

1131257,ARA48345JZPZR,B0011HOEY4,Archmaker,"[1, 2]","Well you've got a powerful lot of talent collaborating on this film and this time out it really pays off.  I don't think there's a better screenwriter than Steve Zaillian, who has an amazing range of superior work to his credit, and he comes through again, getting to the guts of a complex and morally ambiguous story. Putting this difficult work in the hands of an accomplished technician like Ridley Scott was likewise fortunate, for although Ridley's work is always slick and professional the foundations of some of his films have sometimes been a tad shallow. Here he has some real tough stuff to work with, and his craft enables a large story to be told well.  I can't find fault with either script or execution, and found this nearly 3 hour epic moved nimbly and was thoroughly engrossing as well as entertaining.And then you get two heavyweights in the leads with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe doing fine work in what are essentially two different movies that tell parallel stories until their final convergence in the last third or so of the film.  And they are great stories of the cop and the gangster, paradoxical and ironic in their depiction of the two men's contrasting values and lives.  They are aided and abetted with strong performances in all the supporting roles.Denzel's Frank Lucas is a charismatic, pragmatic, and ultimately ambiguous figure.  A man capable of anything in the name of business, in this instance the business of heroin trafficking in Harlem of the 60's and 70's. Trusting no one else, he brings his North Carolina family into this world, and his personal life is kept immaculate, natty, ordered and even loving.  He is by turns a cool and enigmatic charmer, and a wily and thoroughly ruthless and violent criminal.  Nobody can play that kind of character combining the steely gaze of the calculating manipulator with the suddenly disarming killer smile better than Denzel Washington and he is terrific.Russell Crowe's Richie Roberts is an obsessively honest cop alienated within a New York police force of that era rife with corruption.  The flow of money and the moral ambiguity has reached the point where even the famous French Connection dope has been stolen out of impoundment and re-sold to the dealers.  Richie's personal life is a disaster when we first meet him, and his stubborn and rigorously solitary ways have alienated his wife as well as his cop peers.  A seemingly hopelessly stalled career as a cop is resuscitated when he is selected to lead his own hand-picked crew to specialize in going after big time dope dealers, a move that will eventually put him on a collision course with Denzel's Frank Lucas.  Crowe finds not only the ornery tenacity of a man who cannot compromise his principles, but also the difficulty of life around and with such an individual, and the price he pays for his rigor.Fine work all around, beautifully filmed, with a vibrant and exciting pace and exceptionally fine story-telling in enabling the audience to follow these two diverse and complicated threads.  This film takes its place with the best of the genre, and there are echoes and recognition and respect paid to those great films like Goodfellows and most especially The French Connection.

Does the mix sound right? Oh...how unoriginal. I wish I knew that the movie was going to be nearly three hours long before I rented the flick. Had I knew, I wouldn't have been interested in seeing the movie until five years later. The fact that Ridley Scott directed the film makes it all worse. At least I was hoping for a good Denzel Washington performance. Nope...I didn't get that. All he did was look and walk around. Or in other words, Denzel was Denzel. The story was all derivative and completely uninteresting, as if the plot was done million times over. So, what else new can be offered through American Gangster? Pretty much...nothing. Josh Brolin does his best to look like Razor Ramon. In a particular scene, I thought one guy looked extremely familiar until I figured it out that this cop was the serial killer from Silence of the Lambs. Mighty interesting, is it? Every time a subplot develops, it gets discarded right away. Say for an example, Cuba Gooding's character disrespects the black don loser, so as a follow-through, I was expecting the black don loser to give him a b***h slap, pour kerosene on his body, light him on fire, and shoot him about hundred of times just to make sure he feels it. Of course, the director felt it unimportant and moved on. It's hard for me to think of suggestions to improve American Gangster, but it's a lot easier to say that the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place since it glorifies the black don loser as a Jesus Christ figure or perhaps simply as noble as Denzel Washington. At the same time, I am not forgetting that this loser killed thousands of people, white or of his color, through his ""brand name."" In short, American Gangster is boring, uninteresting, too long, and a huge waste of time. Wondering that I didn't make a mention of Russell Crowe yet?

In the early '30s, hard guys like James Cagney, Paul Muni and Edward G.Robinson paraded the sick dazzle of Prohibition - era thugs. Forty years later the Corleones ruled, but on the margins were the subgenera of African Americans gangster films: SUPERFLY, BLACK CAESAR and their bloody kin. Beneath the violent fantasies of these films was a historical fact: African American mobsters were seizing power from the Italians, who had run the underworld. AMERICAN GANGSTER, is the real - life microcosm of that story. Frank Lucas (DENZEL WASHINGTON) was a Harlem drug lord who, the Vietnam era, revolutionized the Heroin trade by importing the nasty white stuff directly from Southeast Asia, often in the caskets of U.S.soldiers. As Lucas amassed a $50 million fortune, investigator Richie Roberts (RUSSELL CROWE) pusued him. Their story was told in a magazine article that is the source for this film. Director RIDLEY SCOTT and scriptwriter, STEVEN ZAILLIAN (who last collaborated on HANNIBAL) aren't your standard shoot-em-up types, so they'll be painting Lucas as a prototype of white-collar criminals and, even more crucially, highlightingthe element of race in the heroin business. The Mafia, considered African Americans as its customers, not the rivals. Lucas and the more notorious NICKY BARNES(played by CUBA GOODING Jr.) changed all that. The movie surely has another motive.

With great performances by both DenzelWashington as drug kingpin Frank Lucas and Russell Crowe as cop Richie Roberts the film takes on both the gangster lifestyle and the currupt police problem of New York.The film has all the earmarks of an epic. The story written by Steve Zaillian, while a bit long at times, effectively portrays life on the streets at the time period. The camara work by Harris Savides is both gritty and dark.The disc I viewed was the HD DVD and while presenting a great picture and sound field is not without its problems. Now that HD has fallen to Blu Ray this may just be a passing footnote to the industry. The disc presents both the HD movie and the standard definition extended cut( some 18 minutes of additional scenes). Both versions present an audio commentary by Scott and Zaillian which is very informative.

1131277,A35NFVV9QLIPOB,B0011HOEY4,carnage,"[8, 68]","I want to share with you a few of the tentative conclusions I've reached regarding Ridley Scott's diatribes. And I stress the word ""tentative,"" because the subject of what motivates Ridley is tricky and complex. Before I say anything else, let me remind Ridley that I must ask that his proxies avoid the extremes of a pessimistic naturalism and an optimistic humanism by combining the truths of both. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to shatter and ultimately destroy our most precious possessions. If we are powerless to create greater public understanding of the damage caused by his hatchet jobs, it is because we have allowed Ridley to spawn delusions of recidivism's resplendence. To state it in stark and simple terms, some lubricious, foul-mouthed lousy-types actually insist that no one is smart enough to see through his transparent lies. This is the kind of muddled thinking that he is encouraging with his beliefs. Even worse, all those who raise their voice against this brainwashing campaign are denounced as meddlesome nymphomaniacs.Let me move now from the abstract to the concrete. That is, let me give you a (mercifully) few examples of Ridley's outrageous ineptitude. For starters, his ""I'm right and you're wrong"" attitude is backwards because it leaves no room for compromise. That's our situation today, in very rough outline. Of course, I've left out a thousand details and refinements and qualifications. I've not mentioned that by excluding any possibility of comparison, Ridley Scott can easily pass off his own ""compromises"" as works of genius. And I've ignored neopaganism altogether.

1131278,A3BM2T57AB9UDB,B0011HOEY4,Chanfrancisco,"[10, 25]","I love gangster movies.  I'm predisposed to liking the genre.  I had trouble sitting through this thing.  The acting, casting, character development and especially the writing was horrid.  I never accepted the premise, and was totally unconvinced by the plot. The ""babe"" of the movie was moderately attractive.  I believed the love-at-first-sight ""thunderbolt"" that struck Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"", but the meaningful stares from across the room in American Gangster were more like one of those wind-up joke hand buzzers.This is the worst Russell Crowe movie ever.  Am I the only person who thinks that Denzel Washington is a horrible actor?  Apparently so.  Did Ridley Scott get hit in the head with a cinder block and lose all of his talent.  Also apparently so.There's a scene where the Denzel Washington character throws a $50,000 chinchilla coat in a fireplace.  It's supposed to be a very dramatic moment, and Mrs. American Gangster gasps and cringes like some silent movie diva who just got an ice cube dropped down her dress.  She gave the chinch coat to Denzie, so she's all sorry about the fuss that was caused for her gangster hubby.  All I could think about how stinky that big mansion was going to smell after this fur pelt was burned.  I know how funky burning human hair smells, and I doubt if scorched animal hair smells any better.Mrs. American Gangster gave Mr. American Gangster a matching chinchilla hat that made the extraordinarily handsome Denzel Washington look kind of like he had a floppy velour mixing bowl on his head.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking dorky to the max.  One of the duties of any spouse is to say to their better half, ""You aren't really going to wear that thing out of the house, are you?""  Mrs. A.G. seriously fell down in her duties really bad.  I mention this hat because Denzel did not burn the chinch hat with the chinch coat.  At least, I didn't see it hit the logs.  I didn't look at the ""special features"" for this movie, but was there more plot about the chinch hat?  Did the Denzel character keep the hat?  Did Mrs. A.G. come suddenly enter the master bedroom to find Mr. A.G. posing in his chinch hat in front of the mirror. Did Mr. A.G. then jerk the jauntily angled chinch hat from his head and hide it behind his back?  If, as they say in the movie, that the chinch coat is worth $50k, the hat, by volume, must be worth about, say $4166.66.  You don't just give that expensive an item to the Goodwill.  Or maybe, the Fur Coat Club For Gangsters had a special - ""Buy A Chinch Coat And Get A Matching Chinch Hat For Free"" sale.  (I can only speak for myself, but I would have worn the coat as a bathrobe, but not that hat.  I would, however, be willing to use the hat as a coaster for an ice bucket.)  So what happened to the hat?  Maybe Denzel Washington got to keep it for his scrapbook.  All of these gangsters have nicknames (e.g., Jimmy ""The Weasel"" Frattiano).  Did the American Gangster's buddies call him ""The Chinch"" or ""Chilla"" or ""Furry Boy"" after he wore that outfit? We may never know.I take it back.

But Frank has a plan to dramatically increase his share of business in the highly competitive New York City heroin trade. Frank goes directly to the source, the Golden Triangle region of Thailand, to buy massive amounts of pure heroin which he brings back to the U.S. on military aircraft. By  selling his higher quality ""Blue Magic"" heroin at a lower price, Frank undercuts the competition and becomes not only wealthy but the new ""Robin Hood"" of Harlem. Along the way he purchases a mansion for his mother, brings his relatives up to help run the business and marries Miss Puerto Rico.In a parallel storyline, Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a honest cop in a police department full of corruption. When Richie gets the opportunity to head a federal drug investigation his group gets nowhere until they are finally able to recognize that Frank Lucas is the man running the show. But even after the law begins bearing down on him, Frank, fueled by pride and perhaps greed, refuses to ""quit while he's ahead"" and remains in the drug business. I won't spoil the ending. But it includes an interesting twist that maybe I should have seen coming but didn't.It's true that this movie is a genre piece with some rather cliche angles - corrupt cops, a gangster with ""a heart of gold"" etc. And it is a bit overlong and could have used some additional editing. But still this movie features high quality film making that never left me bored. Washington and Crowe are both excellent actors and their characters are more compelling and multi-dimensional than in your typical Hollywood flick. The sounds and settings were also well done, impressively capturing NYC in the 70's with Nixon in office and the Vietnam War winding down. It remains to be seen whether this movie will have the staying power of classic gangster movies like ""Scarface"" and the ""Godfather"".

1131280,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0011HOEY4,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","I think that for a film to be truly successful, it has to resonate with the audience on more levels than mere entertainment. It has to be compelling, connecting emotionally as well as stylistically, in turn allowing for a genuine emotional response. Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster""--based on Mark Jacobson's magazine article ""The Return of Superfly""--is about as compelling as films get, giving an account of the rise and fall of Harlem heroine kingpin Frank Lucas. I never once felt as if I was watching an adaptation of a true story: every character and every event is incredibly convincing, so much so that it occasionally veers into unnerving territory. To be so uncompromising is both refreshing and repulsive, and that's probably why the film works so well.Taking place between 1968 and 1973, ""American Gangster"" tells two stories that exist harmoniously, despite having no interaction until twenty minutes before the film's end. The first story focuses on Lucas (Denzel Washington), a hardened criminal who has no tolerance for incompetence or disloyalty; he'll willingly set one enemy on fire and shoot another in the head in broad daylight. At the same time, he's collected and low key, about as inconspicuous as an everyday businessman. Indeed, business is what he lives for, and he makes sure to follow the guidelines that define American Capitalism: work hard, give respect to those who deserve it, and reap the benefits. This would be fine if only it weren't through the distribution of heroine, which he buys wholesale from a Thai drug lord. Lucas credits his knowledge of business and loyalty to Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III), who was a Harlem icon before his untimely death.As a man who values devotion, it's disturbing to think that (1) he gets married, and (2) that members of his own family got involved in his drug trafficking. In the film, the only member left in the dark about his life is his mother (Ruby Dee), an elderly woman blindsided by his lavish gift giving (not only does he buy her a house on private property, he also places a perfect replica of a lost, beloved vanity table in her bedroom). At one point, his baseball-star nephew confesses that he doesn't want to play ball anymore--he wants to be like his uncle, making millions by overseeing the distribution of drugs. Lucas doesn't react to this immediately, and in that brief moment of sedate reflection, I couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking.The other story centers on Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a New Jersey narcotics detective. For a cop that believes in doing the right thing, he certainly has a fair number of problems, not the least of which is studying to become an attorney: for one thing, his personal life is in shambles because of a bitter divorce and custody battle; but more importantly, his moral compass doesn't earn him any respect from the Department. Consider the confiscation of nearly one million dollars in drug money--he actually turns it in when he could have taken it all and shared it with his partners.But as he delves further into the underground world of drugs, he learns that this is only the tip of the iceberg. A large number of cops, especially those in the Narcotics division, are taking bribes, not only from Lucas, but from many other dealers, as well. Roberts' superior--Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin)--is one of those involved, so much so that at a certain point, I found it difficult to determine whose side he was on (his own, probably). Roberts eventually realizes that Lucas isn't the one he should be after, but rather whomever Lucas is buying his stash from. In order to find out who this is and where the operation is located, Roberts has to find some way to catch Lucas. Of course, this won't be so easy; there's virtually no physical evidence linking Lucas to anything.This detailed, complex sequence of events unfolds with extreme precision, so extreme that it almost becomes burdensome. But I think that was the point: a rough, multifaceted story is being told, and the audience needs to feel as much a part of it as the characters do. It didn't seem as if I was watching this movie, but rather participating in it, feeling and thinking along with the actors were thinking and feeling in their roles. I don't think I've ever had this experience with a film before, so I can't say that I'm used to it. But I can say that I deeply appreciated this film's ability to involve me, to draw me in so thoroughly that I left emotionally drained. And at a hefty two and a half hours, there's plenty of time for the draining to occur.Oddly enough, this is the brilliance of ""American Gangster."" Ridley Scott has crafted a film so focused that it doesn't just play, it actually happens. Both Washington and Crowe give incredibly realistic performances, pretty much to the point of not seeming like performances at all. I can't say how often this happens, but I'd guess that it isn't too often. It probably helps that the screenplay is based on actual events--a purely fictional piece is rarely capable of drama this compelling.",5,Money Is Everything,1194134400,"11 4,

Inspired by true events, Denzel does an excellent job of actually making the audience feel some 'sympathy' for a murdering gangster! Not an easy task for an actor, or the screenwriters. We are given the story of a working man who only wanted a better life for his entire family, and he does his best to provide the best for them and his wife. However, he was a killer. It is only through the most superb writing and acting that a story like this can evoke the deeply mixed emotions brought to the surface.

It shows that the police in the movie are not that much different from the gangsters.  The police were corrupt and thought nothing of keeping the drug money that they should have been turning in as evidence during seizures for themselves.  The character portrayed by Russell Crowe was isolated within the force because he turned over nearly a million dollars to the evidence room. He was basically ridiculed. This indicates that the police force, at least at the time depicted in the movie, was very corrupt.The two different aspects of the film were interesting because it illustrated Denzel Washington's character becoming a drug kingpin while Russell Crowe was trying to put together a case against him using the law.  Also, interesting was the fact that Washington travelled to Vietnam,  which was the source of the drugs and negotiated agreements with the leaders in that country.The movie had some very violent parts but was mostly in keeping with the times and the tenor and themes.  Some nudity and some sex.  Showed a rarity, a Black man becoming an entrepenuer and this shocked the law enforcement who did not think that was possible.All in all, excellent and I would suggest it to others.",3,Review of American Gangster,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,1252,"['film', '34', 'American', 'Gangster', '34', 'excellent', 'police', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'different', 'gangsters', 'police', 'were', 'corrupt', 'thought', 'nothing', 'keeping', 'drug', 'money', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'turning', 'evidence', 'seizures', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'isolated', 'force', 'turned', 'over', 'nearly', 'million', 'dollars', 'evidence', 'room', 'was', 'basically', 'ridiculed', 'police', 'force', 'least', 'time', 'depicted', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'corrupt.The', 'two', 'different', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'interesting', 'illustrated', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'character', 'becoming', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'case', 'using', 'law', 'Also', 'interesting', 'was', 'fact', 'Washington', 'travelled', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'source', 'drugs', 'negotiated', 'agreements', 'leaders', 'country.The', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'violent', 'parts', 'was', 'mostly', 'keeping', 'times', 'tenor', 'themes', 'nudity', 'sex', 'Showed', 'rarity', 'Black', 'man', 'becoming', 'entrepenuer', 'shocked', 'law', 'enforcement', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'possible.All', 'excellent', 'would', 'suggest', 'others']",American Gangster

1131285,A18D0R137EYS6C,B0011HOEY4,Clinton Enlow,"[0, 0]","I don't know whether the crime film is actually dead or dying as some would say to movies like American Gangster or We Own the Night (which is more cliche in its black and white storyline)but truthfully I found American Gangster to be an absolutely fascinating film...mostly. If you've been living under a rock or haven't been reading a single thing on this product page the movie details the rise of Frank Lucas a harlem gangster who rose from being the driver/confidante of deceased gangster Bumpy Johnson to being one of the top crime leaders in New York City in the seventies. The film details the exact method of his rise where in he sees a report on drug use in Vietnam and flies there to secure a distribution from the Golden Triangle around Thailand paying off US army brass to import the heroin in caskets of dead soldiers. On the opposite end of this spectrum is officer Richie Roberts who after the death of a troubled partner from Heroin called Blue Magic and an appointment to lead a special investigation begins slowly to seek out the source of the drugs. Thats the story in a nutshell I suppose as the film takes a route I've always liked in being very procedural in the details from Lucas' operation and problems dealing with crooked cops to troubled family members to Richie's problems with crooked cops, the fact that he found a load of money which earned him ire when he turned it in to the fact that a criminal is godfather to his son and he won't take a bribe. The acting is great all around with a lot of great supporting work and Ridley Scott in that way Ridley Scott can makes everything from the bell bottoms and afros to the cars look cool. If anything brought the production down to me I'd have to fault two things. One is extraneous story in a nearly three hour film. While I won't fault all of the things in the Lucas storyline the Roberts plot has a storyline involving trouble with his wife who is moving away and taking her son because of him and the hard lifestyle he lives. Sure it shows Roberts work affecting his homelife but its cliche and not really needed. Also theres a sharp tonal shift at the end of the film that I found rather weird as Frank who's been shown as an absolutely ruthless crime lord changes into somewhat a kind of a hero when he helps Roberts crackdown on police corruption. Two hours twenty minutes seeing him shoot beat and cause the death of people then ten minutes later He's not such a bad guy. Features on the DVD detail all the work Lucas did to help Roberts in obtaining this and the fact that both became great friends afterward. Still to me it felt odd to the film although it ends the storyline of the crooked police officers better than a subscript as the movie rolls on credits.So thats what I think of the film so hows the DVD. As usual pretty good and worth the money for fans of the film. Theres a two disc unrated version and three disc collectors edition. I bought the two disc version as the three disc has mostly a booklet and extraneous docs about hip-hop influence, a Dateline report on the movie, a music video and the films trailer. The two disc of course has more material on the movie which was enough for me with commentary from Scott who's always detailed in his commentaries enough to be fascinating to listen to. The unrated material is a little extraneous with most of it coming at the end where Lucas is released after his fifteen year stay in prison. Thankfully this isn't unrated extended only and you're given the option of watching the either the extended or theatrical version of the film. On disc two theres also featurettes on production of certain scenes, deleted scenes and always my favorite with movies detailing a point of history a featurette with interviews from the real men the actors portray and their thoughts on the story and how they're reflected in the movie. The two disc in my opinion is a complete package for those wanting to know about the movie but hey if your a fan of the film go for the three disc. Everything is good in my opinion.",4,American Gangster,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,4052,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'crime', 'film', 'actually', 'dead', 'dying', 'would', 'say', 'movies', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Own', 'Night', 'more', 'cliche', 'black', 'white', 'storyline', 'truthfully', 'found', 'American', 'Gangster', 'be', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'film', 'mostly', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'reading', 'single', 'thing', 'product', 'page', 'movie', 'details', 'rise', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'harlem', 'gangster', 'who', 'rose', 'being', 'driver/confidante', 'deceased', 'gangster', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'being', 'one', 'top', 'crime', 'leaders', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'seventies', 'film', 'details', 'exact', 'method', 'rise', 'where', 'report', 'drug', 'use', 'Vietnam', 'flies', 'there', 'secure', 'distribution', 'Golden', 'Triangle', 'Thailand', 'paying', 'off', 'US', 'army', 'brass', 'import', 'heroin', 'caskets', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'officer', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'who', 'death', 'troubled', 'partner', 'Heroin', 'called', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'appointment', 'lead', 'special', 'investigation', 'slowly', 'seek', 'out', 'source', 'drugs', 'Thats', 'story', 'nutshell', 'suppose', 'film', 'route', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'being', 'very', 'procedural', 'details', 'Lucas', 'operation', 'problems', 'dealing', 'crooked', 'cops', 'troubled', 'family', 'members', 'Richie', 'problems', 'crooked', 'cops', 'fact', 'found', 'load', 'money', 'earned', 'ire', 'when', 'turned', 'fact', 'criminal', 'godfather', 'son', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'bribe', 'acting', 'great', 'lot', 'great', 'supporting', 'work', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'way', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'can', 'everything', 'bell', 'bottoms', 'afros', 'cars', 'look', 'cool', 'anything', 'brought', 'production', 'down', ""'d"", 'have', 'fault', 'two', 'things', 'One', 'extraneous', 'story', 'nearly', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fault', 'things', 'Lucas', 'storyline', 'Roberts', 'plot', 'storyline', 'involving', 'trouble', 'wife', 'who', 'moving', 'away', 'taking', 'son', 'hard', 'lifestyle', 'Sure', 'Roberts', 'work', 'affecting', 'homelife', 'cliche', 'not', 'really', 'needed', 'Also', 'sharp', 'tonal', 'shift', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'rather', 'weird', 'Frank', 'who', 'been', 'shown', 'absolutely', 'ruthless', 'crime', 'lord', 'somewhat', 'kind', 'hero', 'when', 'Roberts', 'crackdown', 'police', 'corruption', 'Two', 'hours', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'seeing', 'shoot', 'beat', 'cause', 'death', 'people', 'then', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'Features', 'DVD', 'detail', 'work', 'Lucas', 'did', 'help', 'Roberts', 'obtaining', 'fact', 'became', 'great', 'friends', 'afterward', 'Still', 'felt', 'odd', 'film', 'storyline', 'crooked', 'police', 'officers', 'better', 'subscript', 'movie', 'rolls', 'credits.So', 'thats', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'DVD', 'usual', 'pretty', 'good', 'worth', 'money', 'fans', 'film', 'two', 'disc', 'unrated', 'version', 'three', 'disc', 'collectors', 'edition', 'bought', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'three', 'disc', 'mostly', 'booklet', 'extraneous', 'docs', 'hip-hop', 'influence', 'Dateline', 'report', 'movie', 'music', 'video', 'films', 'trailer', 'two', 'disc', 'course', 'more', 'material', 'movie', 'was', 'enough', 'commentary', 'Scott', 'who', 'always', 'detailed', 'commentaries', 'enough', 'be', 'fascinating', 'listen', 'unrated', 'material', 'little', 'extraneous', 'most', 'coming', 'end', 'where', 'Lucas', 'released', 'fifteen', 'year', 'stay', 'prison', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'unrated', 'extended', 'only', ""'re"", 'given', 'option', 'watching', 'extended', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'disc', 'two', 'theres', 'also', 'production', 'certain', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'always', 'favorite', 'movies', 'detailing', 'point', 'history', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'real', 'men', 'actors', 'portray', 'thoughts', 'story', 'how', ""'re"", 'reflected', 'movie', 'two', 'disc', 'opinion', 'complete', 'package', 'wanting', 'know', 'movie', 'hey', 'fan', 'film', 'go', 'three', 'disc', 'Everything', 'good', 'opinion']",American Gangster
1131286,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0011HOEY4,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","Despite the fact I like Blade Runner and Alien, I always found Ridley Scott's career rather spotty. Known not sticking to the same genre, there's times where he'll offer an interesting film, other times he misses the ball severely and others will outright praise a film that really had little to go for it. That's where I always find fault with his films, especially current ones: they're directed with such gusto and flair and outright spectacle at times that whatever story there is gets excused since it's got an ""epic"" story thanks to the visuals. American Gangster doesn't have the huge visuals but it's long with lots of speaking roles and is one of those kind of films where it'll entertain you in spots and divide in others.After Bumpy Johnson dies, his right-hand man Frank Lucas takes up his mantel but does things a little differently this time. Rather than buying heroin from the Mafia, Lucas goes straight to the source in Southeast Asia, strikes a deal which cuts down on costs and thanks to Lucas' low price, it becomes a smash in Harlem though there's more overdoses thanks to the heroin's purity. Keeping family members involved and considerably well looked after, Lucas rises to the top of the drug underworld.On the other side of the law, Richie Roberts is an almost too-honest cop more well known for reporting near a million in unmarked bills than his cop work. With his personal life not as strong and cops not wanting to work with him because of his anti-corruption views, he eventually joins a drug task force designed to go after the big suppliers and players as opposed to small-town dealers. Unbeknownest to him, Lucas is the man to go after but how can you catch someone that doesn't even stand out in the crowd?I'm at that age finally where I can appreciate the more longer, character-driven films where emphasis is placed more on acting and pacing as opposed to getting the story over and done with (Seven Samurai, despite being over 3 hours, never feels it) but on occasion, a film comes out that, while not long as any others, still feels like trimming could've benefited the film. Like Kingdom of Heaven, it's not a film long because of so much twists and turns but rather just seeing character's lives and who they are. There's times where the story gets really fascinating and you get caught up in it but then others, you're looking at the running time and find only an hour has passed. It doesn't add anything to the genre or even does what it does the best, but it's probably hard film to walk out on as well.It's hard to deny that American Gangster is similar to other crime dramas but one that pops up is Heat with a look at both sides who are just as adept at what they do rather than good guy is good, bad guy evil. But whereas Robert De Niro's side is more interesting in that film, here the film is more on the good side since he's just as likable and interesting as a character and although Russell Crowe is quickly becoming like Martin Scorsese's own De Niro...(oh yeah, he doesn't use him anymore, more like DiCaprio), he does deliver a good performance. One that's disappointing is Denzel Washington since, despite having a strong screen presence, he's just not that interesting a character and seems more like his Training Day role part two.Like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven as well as the phenomenal Blade Runner release recently, Scott loves the big DVD's with tons of features. With the original as well as the extended cut along with several featurettes, it's an interesting look at the film that's just memorable enough to recommend but not enough to absolutely love.",4,"Impressive set, good movie",1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,3623,"['fact', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Alien', 'always', 'found', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'career', 'rather', 'spotty', 'Known', 'not', 'sticking', 'same', 'genre', 'times', 'where', ""'ll"", 'offer', 'interesting', 'film', 'other', 'times', 'ball', 'severely', 'others', 'will', 'outright', 'praise', 'film', 'really', 'had', 'little', 'go', 'where', 'always', 'find', 'fault', 'films', 'especially', 'current', 'ones', ""'re"", 'directed', 'such', 'gusto', 'flair', 'outright', 'spectacle', 'times', 'story', 'excused', 'got', 'epic', 'story', 'thanks', 'visuals', 'American', 'Gangster', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'visuals', 'long', 'lots', 'speaking', 'roles', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'where', ""'ll"", 'entertain', 'spots', 'divide', 'others.After', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'up', 'mantel', 'things', 'little', 'differently', 'time', 'Rather', 'buying', 'heroin', 'Mafia', 'Lucas', 'straight', 'source', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'deal', 'down', 'costs', 'thanks', 'Lucas', 'low', 'price', 'smash', 'Harlem', 'more', 'overdoses', 'thanks', 'heroin', 'purity', 'Keeping', 'family', 'members', 'involved', 'considerably', 'well', 'looked', 'Lucas', 'top', 'drug', 'other', 'side', 'law', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'almost', 'too-honest', 'cop', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'reporting', 'million', 'unmarked', 'bills', 'cop', 'work', 'personal', 'life', 'not', 'strong', 'not', 'wanting', 'work', 'anti-corruption', 'views', 'eventually', 'drug', 'task', 'force', 'designed', 'go', 'big', 'suppliers', 'players', 'opposed', 'small-town', 'dealers', 'Unbeknownest', 'Lucas', 'man', 'go', 'how', 'can', 'catch', 'someone', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', ""'m"", 'age', 'finally', 'where', 'can', 'appreciate', 'more', 'longer', 'character-driven', 'films', 'where', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'more', 'acting', 'pacing', 'opposed', 'getting', 'story', 'done', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'being', '3', 'hours', 'never', 'occasion', 'film', 'out', 'not', 'long', 'others', 'still', 'trimming', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'film', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'not', 'film', 'long', 'so', 'much', 'twists', 'turns', 'rather', 'just', 'seeing', 'character', 'lives', 'who', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'fascinating', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'then', 'others', ""'re"", 'looking', 'running', 'time', 'find', 'only', 'hour', 'passed', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'genre', 'even', 'what', 'best', 'probably', 'hard', 'film', 'walk', 'out', 'well.It', 'hard', 'deny', 'American', 'Gangster', 'similar', 'other', 'crime', 'dramas', 'one', 'up', 'Heat', 'look', 'sides', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'adept', 'what', 'do', 'rather', 'good', 'guy', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'evil', 'whereas', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'side', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'here', 'film', 'more', 'good', 'side', 'just', 'likable', 'interesting', 'character', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'own', 'De', 'Niro', 'oh', 'yeah', ""n't"", 'use', 'anymore', 'more', 'DiCaprio', 'deliver', 'good', 'performance', 'One', 'disappointing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'having', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'character', 'more', 'Training', 'Day', 'role', 'part', 'Gladiator', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'as', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'release', 'recently', 'Scott', 'big', 'DVD', 'tons', 'features', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'cut', 'several', 'featurettes', 'interesting', 'look', 'film', 'just', 'memorable', 'enough', 'recommend', 'not', 'enough', 'absolutely', 'love']",American Gangster

1131289,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0011HOEY4,Craig Matteson,"[2, 4]","While there is a real grit to this film, it is never sensationalistic and does not glorify crime.  This is the story of two real life people, Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts.  Frank Lucas grew up in North Carolina and fled to New York to avoid trouble with the law.  On the streets of Harlem he became the right hand man of a gangster who ruled Harlem under the Italian mafia, Bumpy Johnson.  After Bumpy died, Frank rethought his position in life and what he wanted to do about it.What he decided to do was become the main supplier of Heroin in New York and New Jersey.  He hatched a scheme to go to Vietnam and Thailand and from there into the mountain jungles to buy uncut heroin direct and cut out all the middlemen in the drug trade.  How he got it back to the states is one of the interesting plot points of the movie and if you were alive during those years you probably remember the news stories after he got busted.Along the way, he brings his family up from North Carolina and they build their own drug business that is so effective (the Blue Magic brand heroin they sell is twice as potent at half the price) that the Mafia works out a deal to buy wholesale from him!  Yes, he is ruthless.  Yes, we see the squalor of what his drugs do to people.  Yes, we see the degradation of the women who work to cut and package his dope and have to work naked so they can't steal anything.  We briefly see the brothels, but the way they are shown nothing could be less sexy.  It is all just so sad and filthy.  Unlike the Godfather films, this movie doesn't try to pretend there is nobility and doesn't separate us from where Frank's millions come from.  However, Frank separates himself.  We see scenes of him at Church with his mother, of them holding hands and praying around their Thanksgiving Day meal, and so on.  Frank views himself as just another business man moving a commodity that people want and are going to buy with or without him.  So, he rationalizes, why not cash in.Pursuing Frank is Detective Richie Roberts.  Remember, this was the time of the movie ""Prince of the City"" and the police force was notoriously corrupt.  This was especially true of the drug squads.  Richie will not take.  He just wants to be an honest cop and this confuses and enrages the crooked cops, but gets him on a team trying to actually go after the big drug dealers.  The death of his former partner who got into heroin gives him a lead to the Blue Magic brand.  You see, the junkies weren't used to the stuff being so potent and there were many deaths from it.  The movie's main plot is how Richie learns about Frank and finally brings him down.  A nice twist in the film that was also a part of real life is that Richie was also going to law school and passed the bar.  So, when it came time to prosecute Frank, Richie did it.The extras disk has a feature that shows the real Richie and Frank and how they are still friends today.  Richie eventually became a defense attorney and worked to defend Frank and get him out of jail after serving 15 years instead of the 70 he was sentenced to.An interesting and honest film that I found quite compelling.  Frank is played by Denzel Washington and Richie is played by Russell Crowe.  They both do superb work.",5,A compelling crime story that never glamorizes crime and let's us see its horrible effects,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,3250,"['real', 'grit', 'film', 'never', 'sensationalistic', 'not', 'glorify', 'crime', 'story', 'two', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'grew', 'up', 'North', 'Carolina', 'fled', 'New', 'York', 'avoid', 'trouble', 'law', 'streets', 'Harlem', 'became', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'gangster', 'who', 'ruled', 'Harlem', 'Italian', 'mafia', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'Bumpy', 'died', 'Frank', 'rethought', 'position', 'life', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'about', 'decided', 'do', 'was', 'become', 'main', 'supplier', 'Heroin', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Jersey', 'hatched', 'scheme', 'go', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'there', 'mountain', 'jungles', 'buy', 'uncut', 'heroin', 'direct', 'cut', 'out', 'middlemen', 'drug', 'trade', 'How', 'got', 'back', 'states', 'one', 'interesting', 'plot', 'points', 'movie', 'were', 'alive', 'years', 'probably', 'remember', 'news', 'stories', 'got', 'busted.Along', 'way', 'family', 'up', 'North', 'Carolina', 'build', 'own', 'drug', 'business', 'so', 'effective', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'brand', 'heroin', 'sell', 'twice', 'as', 'potent', 'price', 'Mafia', 'out', 'deal', 'buy', 'wholesale', 'Yes', 'ruthless', 'Yes', 'see', 'squalor', 'what', 'drugs', 'do', 'people', 'Yes', 'see', 'degradation', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'cut', 'package', 'dope', 'have', 'work', 'naked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'steal', 'anything', 'briefly', 'see', 'brothels', 'way', 'are', 'shown', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'less', 'sexy', 'just', 'so', 'sad', 'filthy', 'Godfather', 'films', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'pretend', 'nobility', ""n't"", 'separate', 'where', 'Frank', 'millions', 'come', 'However', 'Frank', 'see', 'scenes', 'Church', 'mother', 'holding', 'hands', 'praying', 'around', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'meal', 'so', 'Frank', 'just', 'business', 'man', 'moving', 'commodity', 'people', 'want', 'are', 'going', 'buy', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'cash', 'in.Pursuing', 'Frank', 'Detective', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Remember', 'was', 'time', 'movie', 'Prince', 'City', 'police', 'force', 'was', 'notoriously', 'corrupt', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'drug', 'squads', 'Richie', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'cop', 'confuses', 'crooked', 'cops', 'team', 'trying', 'actually', 'go', 'big', 'drug', 'dealers', 'death', 'former', 'partner', 'who', 'got', 'heroin', 'lead', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'brand', 'see', 'junkies', 'were', ""n't"", 'used', 'stuff', 'being', 'so', 'potent', 'were', 'many', 'deaths', 'movie', 'main', 'plot', 'how', 'Richie', 'Frank', 'finally', 'down', 'nice', 'twist', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'Richie', 'was', 'also', 'going', 'law', 'school', 'passed', 'bar', 'So', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'prosecute', 'Frank', 'Richie', 'did', 'it.The', 'extras', 'disk', 'feature', 'real', 'Richie', 'Frank', 'how', 'are', 'still', 'friends', 'today', 'Richie', 'eventually', 'became', 'defense', 'attorney', 'worked', 'defend', 'Frank', 'get', 'jail', 'serving', '15', 'years', 'instead', '70', 'was', 'sentenced', 'interesting', 'honest', 'film', 'found', 'quite', 'compelling', 'Frank', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Richie', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'do', 'superb', 'work']",American Gangster

I feel the reason is that if you dare to give negative reviews, the fans of the item will dump on negative responses, and, of course, many want the approval ratings. Perhaps, Amazon should adjust their ranking methods.Now the review: I feel this flick is good, not great. *** 1/2.What I liked best was the historical sweep.  Although, I was aware that heroin was coming out of Nam in body-bags, like a blizzard, and that the inner city dope trade was booming, the fim graphically puts the pieces together in such a way, that one must understand that the brutal continuation of these wars has something to do with the hundreds of thousands that are employed by it, as one of the characters points out. I say 'wars' because the largest producer of hard drugs today is Afganistan. I really appreciated that insight, although of course, there are many other killings spawned by that evil racket, war.  As far as the historical accuracy - I hear that Frank Lucas said only about 20% was true.  Otherwise, I felt that the screenwriters were up against the wall with too much material and too many characters to develop in this venue - it would have made a much better mini-series, at least six hours of material here - even a full season.  For this reason, the script was compromised, choppy, compressed, and full of cliches - whether it was done before in Serpico, Shaft, or elsewhere, the film hardly displayed the kind of character development we see in the Godfather, Once Upon A Time in America, Casino, or the smooth interplay between story, character, and hard-hitting violence we see in L.A. Confidential (that forgotten, underrated Crowe performance).  On that note, there's no substitute for good, old-fashioned violence in a gangster film.

And nothing--absolutely nothing--is going to stop these two men...except each other.To say ""American Gangster"" is a thrill to watch is, quite simply, a horrible understatement.  Ridley Scott's film rockets along (despite it's epic length) at break-neck speed, fueled by stellar performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe (and when the two men meet, in the interrogation room, you'll be so enthralled you'll have to try not to giggle in excitement).

The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.I'm not saying ""American Gangster"" is perfect; it has its flaws, such as a couple of unnecessary side plots, and the fact that Roberts's story parallel's ""Serpico"" so much (it's a true story, so we can't change the facts; however, having just watched ""Serpico"" not too long ago, it was stuck in my head).

The movie never really takes flight.  Indeed, the film not only suffers from an overly-familiar plot, but also cinematography that is sometimes drab and colorless.

As such, this is one of the most distasteful parables of American capatalism.While ""American Gangster"" is suffused with the requisite ""family ties,"" grisly killings, duplicitous associates, cops on the make and other betrayals, it may be that we've seen too many better-made mafia movies.

While it might not be anything new to the genre it does what some try and fail to do.  That's keep the audience entertained for the whole movie.  Its based on Frank Lucas and the cop who go toe to toe with each other throughout the movie.

1131302,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0011HOEY4,D. Hartley,"[0, 0]","There is a key scene in Ridley Scott's riveting crime epic ""American Gangster"" that speaks volumes about the personal code that drives one of the film's principal characters. ""Look at the way you're dressed,"" says the impeccably groomed and tastefully attired 1970s Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in disgust, to his ostentatiously pimped-out brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), ""...it's a look that says: `arrest me'. Remember, the loudest one in the room is also the weakest one in the room.""It's one of the axioms Lucas picked up while paying his dues working as a driver for his mentor, an old-school Harlem crime lord (Clarence Williams III). By the time his boss keels over from a heart attack, Lucas has been thoroughly schooled in the shrewd business acumen of how to remain a ""wolf in sheep's clothing""; no matter how venal your methods are for getting to the top and maintaining your position, if you're able to swing it while maintaining a respectable public appearance, everybody will still love you.Scott's film is all about ""appearances""; judging a book by its cover, if you will. When we are first introduced to the film's other main character, New Jersey police detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), we're not sure if we're observing a cop and his partner serving a warrant, or if we're watching a disheveled street thug and his pal pulling a B & E on someone's apartment. While his personal grooming habits may be questionable, it is apparent that his integrity is of the highest order. He is an honest cop in a department that is swimming in corruption (he's sneered at as a ""boy scout"" when he turns in nearly one million dollars in cash discovered in a dealer's car).Lucas, on the other hand, maintains the outward appearance of an upstanding citizen. He has prospered via an ingenious Southeast Asian heroin pipeline that bypasses any pesky ""middlemen"". He buys an estate in the suburbs and sets up house for his brothers and his mother (played by the great Ruby Dee, who we don't see enough of these days). He marries a beautiful Latina (Lymari Nadal) and ingratiates himself as a pillar of the community.Steven Zailian's screenplay is based on true events; the story takes place in the same seedy 70s N.Y.C. milieu that inspired films like ""The French Connection"", ""Serpico"" and ""Prince of the City"". There are numerous references made to the real-life French connection case, as well as the police corruption that was depicted the latter two films.Scott uses a trick that worked well for Michael Mann in the similarly structured ""Heat"".  He builds a considerable amount of dramatic tension by keeping his two powerhouse stars apart for the lion's share of the film, while steadily teasing on the inevitability that the two men's professional paths are destined to cross. When Washington and Crowe finally do share a scene together, it proves to be well worth the wait (when you see it, watch closely for the coffee cup prop that becomes a proxy chess piece; it's a masterstroke of gesture from both actors).Scott utilizes his patented ultra-slick visual style, although a grittier look might have served the story better. Despite the deliberate pacing for the first 2 hours, something about  the denouement feels curiously rushed (sorry, can't elaborate-potential spoiler!) The performances by Washington and Crowe are superb, with a nice turn as well from Josh Brolin as a corrupt Special Investigations Unit cop, and Armand Assante as a mob big shot. I liked the period soundtrack as well, although we need to declare a moratorium on Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"".

He not only wants to corner it, he wants to sell Grade A pure dope by cutting out the middleman and getting his supply direct from where it is made:  in the jungles of Southeast Asia.  So he goes to Vietnam himself (during the height of the Vietnam War) to establish his contacts, then smuggles the heroin into the country via military cargo planes.  His dope becomes such a runaway success he quickly becomes the biggest underground kingpin in New York--a mobster who effectively eludes the clutches of the city's corrupt police force, which wants in on the action--and the target of a 24/7 investigation by a handful of honest police officers.Such a story, if fictitious, would defy believability; but truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  Based on the true story of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, director Ridley Scott's AMERICAN GANGSTER is an outstanding depiction of the gritty, violent underworld, set in the turbulent Seventies.  Scott doesn't just film a scene; he presents a powerful visual that makes the viewer flinch.  From smoke-filled bars in Saigon to filthy Harlem tenements, Scott tells this gripping story through impressive, thought-provoking cinematography.Equally impressive is the cast, headlined by Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts.  Both actors are superb:  Washington as the brooding, sometimes sinister gangster; Crowe as the honest cop with several vices of his own.  Both roles are on an inevitable collision course; yet when this collision ultimately occurs, it's anticlimactic and almost glossed over, which was my only disappointment with this most remarkable film.  I was also impressed with Josh Brolin, the ringleader of the corrupt New York detectives on the take.Packed with action, drama, suspense, and intrigue, AMERICAN GANGSTER brings a difficult story to uneasy life, and shows that Scott plus Washington plus Crowe are a winning combination indeed.--D.

However, it really doesn't do anything wrong as a film, and does perform a wonderful public service in showing the reality and depth of corruption and collusion between drug lords and the ""system"" (=local law enforcement, court/prison system, politicians, business, etc.).  That by itself is a wonderful relief from the usual ""good guys vs. bad guys"" simplistic dualism that the media usually bombards us with when covering the so-called ""war on drugs.""  So there is a refreshingly down to earth, let's-be-real-folks sensibility here, not some puerile moral soapbox. The fact that it's based on a true story, despite the inevitable poetic Hollywood embellishments, only makes it that much more powerful.Director Ridley Scott has not made a truly bad movie in ages, and here he picks the two best leads out there to carry the film, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, both of whom effortlessly command the viewer's attention in every scene they're in.  The narrative unfolds slowly at first but then quickly gears into a brisk pace (not as brisk as a Scorsese film, but plenty brisk) and together with Scott's trademark mastery of visual framing, made the 2.5 hours' runtime really fly by.  There is actually not that much graphic violence for a movie of this genre, so don't expect a ""Scarface"" or ""New Jack City.""There is, God bless, a fair amount of very very yummy eye candy for male viewers (whom I'd imagine are the main audience for this type of movie) through Crowe's luscious ex-wife and especially his SMOKIN' HOT lawyer whom he's boinking on the side, oodles of gorgeous black women especially the ones working in Washington's heroin lab who are not allowed to wear clothes for fear they'd steal the goods, and of course Washington's Puerto Rican wife.

This is not just a gangster flick, but, like The Godfather & Heat, is also a psychological drama. It tells the story of Frank Lucas, an African-American man who becomes a #1 drug importer in 60's Harlem. Richie Roberts is the cop who's willing to bring Lucas and his tainted business down. Seems like a simple story, but the film itself is far more complex. There is more story than action (not to say it is bad, but it really stands out with other awe-inspiring motion pictures). Ridley Scott simply knows how to make a great film, and this is one of his greatest. The performances here are also memorable. Washington, Crowe, Brolin, Gooding Jr., Nadal, Dee, Common, and T.I. give their roles their all, and they do it almost flawlessly. I'm surprised Washington wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. And the costumes and sets are just ravishing!

1131312,A1SXS2P1B80I82,B0011HOEY4,"Erik Aleksander Moe ""riddion""","[2, 5]","First of all, I love the movie. When I watched this movie in the theater I was dazed and couldn't believe the great imagery, the magnificent acting by Denzel Washington (one of my favorite actors) and Russell Crowe, but also the seamless and very personal direction by Ridley Scott, who has made such great films as Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, and Gladiator. I was looking forward to getting this movie and it was one of the reasons I bought a HD DVD player last January (not the only reason, of course). Which is why this release is such a letdown.The picture quality on this release didn't stand out as much as Batman Begins or Bourne Supremacy, or even The Thing, did, but it is quite good. The picture was just too dark several times and the colors were toned down, which can also be because of Scott's chosen palette for the film. Otherwise is the picture quite good, but not great.The sound is a big letdown. I would expect Universal to include a Dolby TrueHD track especially on this release, because of it's importance to Universal's HD DVD support. The sound itself is Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 and it is alright. I never feel like I am hearing the HD soundtrack, like with Batman Begins or The Matrix trilogy, but it is better than a normal DVD soundtrack, which tends to be very narrow. The sound on this release is much more open but it not the knockdown HD sound that Warner has included on the aforementioned movies and with Blade Runner.The extra features is very meager. The extended version of the film can only be seen in the standard definition side B of the disc, which is a major letdown to all fans of the movie and HD DVD. It does have a commentary track with Scott and Steven Zaillian, the writer, which is interesting. The disc has no documentary on the making of the film, just a 4 minute long mini documentary of the real Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. Universal can really learn from Warner with it's releases of the Matrix trilogy and Blade Runner on how to properly release really great movies. It seems like Universal has gone out  it's way to release feature packed version on DVD and not on HD DVD. Has Universal lost it's confidence in HD DVD can one wonder.And another thing. I really dislike these combo versions of a film. As I see it it's a no win situation for the consumer. A person that doesn't have a HD DVD player and buys it would be frustration because he/she payed so much for a version of the film that they cannot see before they invest in a HD DVD player. And if a person that has a HD DVD player buys it he/she feels cheated because of fact that they had to pay extra for a version of the film that they wouldn't see. And in addition there have been reported errors with them. On the disc that I have it froze halfway through the film. I restarted my player and then the playback went fine from that point.I would still recommend this release to people who have a HD DVD player, because the film is so great and the disc isn't all that bad.",4,A near miss for Universal's most prestigious HD DVD release,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,3000,"['First', 'love', 'movie', 'When', 'watched', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'dazed', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'great', 'imagery', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'also', 'seamless', 'very', 'personal', 'direction', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'who', 'made', 'such', 'great', 'films', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Gladiator', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'bought', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'last', 'January', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'course', 'Which', 'why', 'release', 'such', 'letdown.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'Batman', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'even', 'Thing', 'did', 'quite', 'good', 'picture', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'dark', 'several', 'times', 'colors', 'were', 'toned', 'down', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'Scott', 'chosen', 'palette', 'film', 'picture', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'great.The', 'sound', 'big', 'letdown', 'would', 'expect', 'Universal', 'include', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'track', 'especially', 'release', 'importance', 'Universal', 'HD', 'DVD', 'support', 'sound', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'alright', 'never', 'feel', 'am', 'hearing', 'HD', 'soundtrack', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'better', 'normal', 'DVD', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'very', 'narrow', 'sound', 'release', 'much', 'more', 'open', 'not', 'knockdown', 'HD', 'sound', 'Warner', 'included', 'aforementioned', 'movies', 'Blade', 'Runner.The', 'extra', 'features', 'very', 'meager', 'extended', 'version', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'standard', 'definition', 'side', 'B', 'disc', 'major', 'letdown', 'fans', 'movie', 'HD', 'DVD', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'Scott', 'Steven', 'Zaillian', 'writer', 'interesting', 'disc', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'just', '4', 'minute', 'long', 'mini', 'documentary', 'real', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Universal', 'can', 'really', 'learn', 'Warner', 'releases', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'how', 'properly', 'release', 'really', 'great', 'movies', 'Universal', 'gone', 'way', 'release', 'feature', 'packed', 'version', 'DVD', 'not', 'HD', 'DVD', 'Has', 'lost', 'confidence', 'HD', 'DVD', 'can', 'one', 'wonder.And', 'thing', 'really', 'dislike', 'combo', 'versions', 'film', 'see', 'win', 'situation', 'consumer', 'person', ""n't"", 'have', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'would', 'be', 'frustration', 'he/she', 'payed', 'so', 'much', 'version', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'invest', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'person', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'he/she', 'feels', 'cheated', 'fact', 'had', 'pay', 'extra', 'version', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'addition', 'have', 'been', 'reported', 'errors', 'disc', 'have', 'froze', 'halfway', 'film', 'restarted', 'player', 'then', 'playback', 'went', 'fine', 'point.I', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'release', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'disc', ""n't"", 'bad']",American Gangster

The key to this story is that the US army supports his efforts and is the means for the distribution and entry of drugs into the USA.The intricate web of support created by Frank Lucas is under observation by a New Jersey cop by the name of Richie Roberts, played masterfully by Russell Crowe. He is a cop who studies law and passes the bar, something that allows him to understand the consequences of each and every action and makes him a rather interesting character.Richie Roberts is honest to a fault, not taking kick-backs, even when it appears that no one is looking and that it is in his best interest to do what all other cops are doing. The subject of good versus evil in this movie is a constant force that makes us be riveted on the screen.Frank Lucas follows rules that protect him, trying hard to NEVER call attention to his person, but falls prey to the vanity of wearing a chinchilla coat his wife purchases for him. His beautiful Puerto-Rican wife fully understands who he is, and yet at some point, you can sense the guilt of never having confronted her husband to MAKE him leave a life that ultimately destroys their marriage.

It takes a while to get used to it, but, ultimately, you'll understand and appreciate it. One story has to do with Washington who become a leader of a Black family who controls the NYC drug scene. The second story has to do with Crowe, who is a somewhat discredited NYC Police detective who is put in charge of an investigation of the NYC drug scene. The movie alternates back and forth between the two independent stories but as the movie proceeds, the stories intertwine in a stirring climax. It's an interesting filming technique and well done.The acting is good, the characters and setting are believable, the filming is good, the stories flow along appropriately.

1131321,AHB0L35LOICAN,B0011HOEY4,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[10, 14]","There's no doubt that American Gangster is a great film overall, especially if you're into this sort of movie. The cast is excellent, and I'm particularly thrilled that Ruby Dee just won a SAG Award for her supporting role in the film. It just serves as validation for a lifetime of incredible work. And of course Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington deliver spot on performances as always, bring the perfect amount of intensity and vibrancy to their characters.But there's just something about the story, the way in which it was structured, that just didn't connect with me in the way I'd hoped it would. The story is broken up so that we bounce back and forth between Washington's character, as he builds his drug empire, and Crowe's character, as he mounts his investigation to find and take down this man. Both characters are, as I've already said, excellently portrayed, yet I could never quite find reason to become emotionally involved with either. Frank Lucas (Washington) seems a cold-blooded killer who shows no hint of concern as he brings his brothers into his business, and I never quite understood why this man became who he was. From the very beginning, he is driven to better his predescessor and to rule the underworld. But I never understood exactly why, and in life, there's always a reason for people becoming who they are. I'd like to have seen what Lucas' reasons were. Crowe's character was better fleshed out, but the fact that he seemed to be the only clean cop in New York just rang a bit strangely in a film based on real life. Nothing is ever quite that black and white.Another thing that bothered me was that because we bounce back and forth between Washington and Crowe, we get scenes from each of their lives, but again we never get emotionally involved with either. For me, anyway, it's that emotional investment in a character that makes a film truly compelling. And while I found nothing technically wrong with this movie as a whole, it seemed to be done in a semi-documentary style that took away from the underlying story of who these two men were. And in such a movie with such intense violence and action, you'd think the ending would be good. But because the film does not end with the final confrontation between Washington and Crowe, and what develops after that moment, it seemed somewhat anti-climatic. I think that disappointed me more than anything else.Overall, it's not that American Gangster isn't a great piece of cinema. It's just that for me personally, the story fell short of really taking me inside the head of these characters, and never really gave me a chance to feel empathy for either of them.

1131325,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0011HOEY4,Grady Harp,"[77, 94]","This viewer rented the DVD form of AMERICAN GANGSTER, having passed it by in the theatrical run, thinking that it was yet another 'crime and corruption in New York' genre film.  It was surprising to discover that this very long film (just under three hours in the Unrated version) is completely riveting and in a way far different than the usual gangster film: this story, based on real people as outlined in an article by Mark Jacobson (transformed for the screen by Steven Zaillian), and while it has its share of grisly killings, it seems more concerned with the issues of integrity in the face of police corruption as embodied in the character of Richie Roberts, the etiology of the heroin use escalation following the Vietnam War, and the presence of a 'Black Mafia' lead by one Frank Lucas.  It is delivered with compelling gusto and intelligence by director Ridley Scott and has some of the best acting of the year.  In other words, this is not a film to be lightly dismissed as a Hollywood retread, but instead it is a tense drama with many very fine points.Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) follows the footsteps of his idol Bumpy (Clarence Williams III) who 'ran' the Harlem streets, and when Bumpy dies, Lucas inherits his mantle.  Lucas is wise, cunning, a gentleman, a powerhouse of ideas, and quickly finds a way to bring the best uncut heroin from the Far East to the streets of New York at a price that undercuts the other mobsters' product.  To establish his control he enlists his family, including his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and rapidly becomes the kingpin of the streets.Simultaneously within the NYPD we meet Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose personal life is a mess but who, with his partner Lou (Ted Levine) discovers corruption in the NYPD and more particularly the Drug Enforcement sector of the police: Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) works with the existing drug lords, grabs their drugs and money and then recycles both to his benefit.  During a particular drug bust, Richie and Lou discover a stash of nearly a million dollars and turn the money into the police - a deed that makes the duo seem foolish and lose the respect of their fellow cops but establishes Roberts as a man who is committed to being a good detective.From these two separate studies the film weaves the development of each character and the interaction between Roberts and Lucas we know will take place.  The end result may be known to those who followed the story as it developed in the 1970s, but for those for whom this true story is new information, the resolution of the film is fast-paced, thrilling, illuminating, and just plain fine cinema.  Both Washington and Crowe  are in peak form, as are those in the many small roles (Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Carla Gugino, Cuba Gooding etc).  This is more of a drama than an action film and while many may feel the final moments of the movie are weak, they do reveal the true ending of the story and say a lot about the narrow line between crime and criminal investigation. This is one of Ridley Scott's most successful films and one that will be around for many years as a model for the medium.

There is a documentary on DVD called 'Mr. Untouchableabout Nicky Barnes and his crew.

This movie (American Gangster) showed Nicky Barnes (played by Cuba Goodings Jr) in a very negative way. The truth was that Nicky Barnes was more like the way that Denzel Washington portrayed Frank Lucas and the way Cuba Goodings Jr acted was more like the way Frank Lucas behaved. Also in Bumpy Johnson's widow's book (Harlem Godfather), she said that Frank Lucas was never close to Bumpy Johnson.

It is not either the case of a clean cop who arrests all those gangsters and then turns lawyer and takes as his first client the fink of a gangster he arrested first and has his prison term reduced to 17 years instead of 70. The real point here is that this gangster is black. He becomes the dominant drug dealer in New York in the early 70s. He uses direct buying in Vietnam during the last war years and has that drug flown to him in military cargo planes, the last time in the coffins of dead soldiers. The only interesting thing here is the fact that he is black and no one can believe that famous gangster who no one knows can be black in New York, in spite of the ethnic and racial cleansing practiced by the mafia. But the film proves nothing, except that those who are anti-black racists are also anti-jew racists. Anti-Semitism goes along with racial racism. But that is nothing new under the sun. The film is well done and shows cruelly well how a cop from New Jersey has better not come and hunt on the land of the police of New York, on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, or whatever. But that still does not make it a great film.

1131340,A1IIBAE9HHDEMW,B0011HOEY4,J. Alvarez,"[3, 7]","I wanted to like this film.  The idea of Crowe & Washington working together again (remember VIRTUOSITY?) with Ridley Scott directing the real life story of Frank Lucas seemed too good to pass up.  I just wish I avoided this film as it was a complete waste of my time.LOCATION: The only reason I start with this is because its the first thing I noticed in the film.  If you're a NYer (and I have been all my life) you'll recognize locations in films that you've either driven past, walked to or view from a distance. Opening shot involving the dirty police is right by the famous Domino Sugar Plant in Bklyn right by the Williamsburg Bridge, meanwhile the description on the bottom of the screen states New Jersey.  Already, the film has me worried.Movie takes place in 1970s Harlem.  Sh!#hole doesn't begin to describe the place in those days (just look at blaxploitation films SUPERFLY & SHAFT to see what it looked like so long ago).  Harlem looks pretty here and that also took me out of the picture.Look, I know they film movies within ""NY"" in Toronto (FRINGE TV Show) or Australia (The Matrix Trilogy) but I thought that the film was going for authenticity and it obviously didn't show.  This began the descent of my giddiness for a film I had high hopes for.STORY: The story involves the rise and fall of Harlem Kingpin Frank Lucas.  You get introduced to his life, the struggles that come with being a gangster / drug lord, police interaction, etc.  I couldn't get into Frank Lucas.  I didn't feel like he was a threat or smart.  If anything, he seemed lucky.  I just couldn't connect to this character.  Crowe's cop subplot was useless.  The subplot was designed to give Crowe's character humanity but it felt more like filler than anything else.  The only interesting aspect of the story was the smuggling of the drugs. Other than that, I struggled like crazy to stay with this film.  That alone should have told me to bail the theater.As I continued to watch this film, I couldn't help but feel that I've seen other films with similar plots had turned out a better product: Godfather I & II, GOODFELLAS, SCARFACE, CASINO, DONNIE BRASCO, BLOW, CITY OF GOD and BOYS IN THE HOOD.  These films were able to transport viewers to a world that no longer exists (or, perhaps, still does).  They allow you to be a fly on the wall & see everything for what it is.  This particular film did none of that for me.ACTING:  Denzel was as stiff as his crippled character in THE BONE COLLECTOR and most of his co stars are just as bad.  Crowe's bklyn accent kept slipping due to his aussie accent. I thought this was an A list film so why am I seeing C list acting?  The only one that nails it is Josh Brolin who plays scumbag cop like nobody's business (reminded me of my dad - LOL!).  He takes this secondary role and eleveates it to a level that so called stars couldn't reach.  I can't wait to see him in meatier roles / starring roles like this one in the near future.DIRECTING: There's a reason why Ridley Scott's current films haven't been doing so well.  Other than ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, LEGEND or GLADIATOR, he hasn't been doing great.  Much like this film, the hype is bigger than the substance.OVERALL: You want to see a good gangster film?  See the films I listed in the STORY section.  If you want to see more on the drug trade in the 70s / 80s, I high recommend the documentaries COCAINE COWBOYS (based on the Miami drug trade that inspired movies like SCARFACE) and MR. UNTOUCHABLE (the story of Harlem Kingpin Nicky Barnes.  He tells his own story to the viewer along with his lieutenants and the cops that busted him).",1,"BORING, OVERHYPED AND OLD TERRITORY",1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,3628,"['wanted', 'like', 'film', 'idea', 'Crowe', 'Washington', 'working', 'together', 'again', 'remember', 'VIRTUOSITY', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'directing', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'seemed', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'just', 'wish', 'avoided', 'film', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.LOCATION', 'only', 'reason', 'start', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'film', ""'re"", 'NYer', 'have', 'been', 'life', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'locations', 'films', ""'ve"", 'driven', 'past', 'walked', 'view', 'distance', 'Opening', 'shot', 'involving', 'dirty', 'police', 'right', 'famous', 'Domino', 'Sugar', 'Plant', 'Bklyn', 'right', 'Williamsburg', 'Bridge', 'meanwhile', 'description', 'bottom', 'screen', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Already', 'film', 'worried.Movie', 'place', '1970s', 'Harlem', 'Sh', 'hole', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'place', 'days', 'just', 'look', 'blaxploitation', 'films', 'SUPERFLY', 'SHAFT', 'see', 'what', 'looked', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Harlem', 'pretty', 'here', 'also', 'took', 'picture.Look', 'know', 'film', 'movies', 'NY', 'Toronto', 'FRINGE', 'TV', 'Show', 'Australia', 'Matrix', 'Trilogy', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'authenticity', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'began', 'descent', 'giddiness', 'film', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'for.STORY', 'story', 'rise', 'fall', 'Harlem', 'Kingpin', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'get', 'introduced', 'life', 'struggles', 'come', 'being', 'gangster', '/', 'drug', 'lord', 'police', 'interaction', 'etc', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'threat', 'smart', 'anything', 'seemed', 'lucky', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'character', 'Crowe', 'cop', 'subplot', 'was', 'useless', 'subplot', 'was', 'designed', 'give', 'Crowe', 'character', 'humanity', 'felt', 'more', 'filler', 'anything', 'else', 'only', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'story', 'was', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'Other', 'struggled', 'like', 'crazy', 'stay', 'film', 'alone', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'bail', 'theater.As', 'continued', 'watch', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'similar', 'plots', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'product', 'Godfather', 'II', 'GOODFELLAS', 'SCARFACE', 'CASINO', 'DONNIE', 'BRASCO', 'BLOW', 'CITY', 'OF', 'GOD', 'BOYS', 'IN', 'THE', 'HOOD', 'films', 'were', 'able', 'transport', 'viewers', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'perhaps', 'still', 'allow', 'be', 'fly', 'wall', 'see', 'everything', 'what', 'particular', 'film', 'did', 'none', 'me.ACTING', 'Denzel', 'was', 'as', 'stiff', 'crippled', 'character', 'THE', 'BONE', 'COLLECTOR', 'most', 'co', 'stars', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'Crowe', 'bklyn', 'accent', 'kept', 'slipping', 'due', 'aussie', 'accent', 'thought', 'was', 'A', 'list', 'film', 'so', 'why', 'am', 'seeing', 'C', 'list', 'acting', 'only', 'one', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'scumbag', 'cop', 'nobody', 'business', 'reminded', 'dad', 'LOL', 'secondary', 'role', 'level', 'so', 'called', 'stars', 'could', ""n't"", 'reach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'meatier', 'roles', '/', 'starring', 'roles', 'one', 'near', 'future.DIRECTING', 'reason', 'why', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'current', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'Other', 'ALIEN', 'BLADE', 'RUNNER', 'LEGEND', 'GLADIATOR', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'great', 'Much', 'film', 'hype', 'bigger', 'substance.OVERALL', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'gangster', 'film', 'See', 'films', 'listed', 'STORY', 'section', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'drug', 'trade', '70s', '/', '80s', 'high', 'recommend', 'documentaries', 'COCAINE', 'COWBOYS', 'based', 'Miami', 'drug', 'trade', 'inspired', 'movies', 'SCARFACE', 'MR.', 'UNTOUCHABLE', 'story', 'Harlem', 'Kingpin', 'Nicky', 'Barnes', 'own', 'story', 'viewer', 'lieutenants', 'cops', 'busted']",American Gangster
1131341,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0011HOEY4,Jason,"[2, 2]","Rags to riches, it's the American dream. All too often in the movies, however, this dream is accomplished through crime. That's the story for Harlem gangster Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who has no problem selling drugs and/or murdering people to get to the top.Lucas is mentored by Harlem crime boss Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson in the late 60s. He learns everything from Bumpy, the ins and outs of the business. When Bumpy dies of a heart attack, the city is wide open and waiting for the next person to take over. As Johnson's heir of sorts, Lucas feels it's his duty to collect on past debts and keep the neighborhood status quo. To do this, Lucas turns to selling heroin.With the assistance of his brother in Vietnam, Lucas manages to import 100% pure product, something with which even the slightest dosage a person becomes addicted. In no time at all he has the market cornered with his product, ""Blue Magic"", and he is a millionaire with street-cred, and some serious clout.His rise to fortune comes with unwanted fame and trouble, however. He has trouble from other local drug dealers, from corrupt cops looking for a bribe, and from legit cops looking for a bust. Lucas realizes the eventual burden and responsibility; so, he calls on his family members to work for him and do the majority of the actual crime. When this becomes too profitable, and when a death occurs at the hands of ""Blue Magic"", he attracts the attention of Det. Richie Roberts (Crowe), a gum-chomping, do-gooder, workaholic whose only mission in life is to catch criminals.Just as in ""Training Day"", Denzel Washington is mesmerizing, commanding attention as a person who seems to have no limits and no conscience. His evil side, or at least a character capable of evil as in ""Man on Fire"", is fascinating, a truly marks Washington as one of Hollywood's elite. In this movie, he does not disappoint. Likewise, Russell Crowe nails his role as Richie Roberts. The mannerisms, the speech, the ragged nature, all exude the exact feel and look of the character he's portraying. What's disappointing, however, is that there is no epic meeting of the stars like when DeNiro and Pacino met in the diner in ""Heat"". They barely share the screen, and the viewer is left wondering what could have happened if they locked horns in a truly important and powerful scene.Another knock on the movie is its length: a whopping 2 hrs 37 min. It wouldn't have been bad if there were more action, but that just isn't the case. Aside from three or four real action scenes, the movie is boringly slow at times, and drags in others. It's wonderful story telling, but j u s t a l I t t l e s l o w. As a connoisseur of gangster movies, I expected much more in the actual ""committing crimes""-department, even if slightly insignificant, in only to keep blood pumping.Nevertheless, American Gangster is a worthwhile movie. The drama and storyline alone are worth the price of admission. To see two heavyweights like Washington and Crowe square off makes it all that much more enjoyable.",3,"With Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, it should be a lot better",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,3038,"['Rags', 'riches', 'American', 'dream', 'too', 'often', 'movies', 'however', 'dream', 'accomplished', 'crime', 'story', 'Harlem', 'gangster', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'problem', 'selling', 'drugs', 'murdering', 'people', 'get', 'top.Lucas', 'mentored', 'Harlem', 'crime', 'boss', 'Ellsworth', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'late', '60s', 'everything', 'Bumpy', 'ins', 'outs', 'business', 'When', 'Bumpy', 'heart', 'attack', 'city', 'wide', 'open', 'waiting', 'next', 'person', 'take', 'over', 'Johnson', 'heir', 'sorts', 'Lucas', 'duty', 'collect', 'past', 'debts', 'keep', 'neighborhood', 'status', 'quo', 'do', 'Lucas', 'selling', 'assistance', 'brother', 'Vietnam', 'Lucas', 'import', '100', '%', 'pure', 'product', 'something', 'even', 'slightest', 'dosage', 'person', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'time', 'market', 'cornered', 'product', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'millionaire', 'street-cred', 'serious', 'clout.His', 'rise', 'fortune', 'unwanted', 'fame', 'trouble', 'however', 'trouble', 'other', 'local', 'drug', 'dealers', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'looking', 'bribe', 'legit', 'cops', 'looking', 'bust', 'Lucas', 'eventual', 'burden', 'responsibility', 'so', 'family', 'members', 'work', 'do', 'majority', 'actual', 'crime', 'When', 'too', 'profitable', 'when', 'death', 'occurs', 'hands', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'attention', 'Det', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Crowe', 'gum-chomping', 'do-gooder', 'workaholic', 'only', 'mission', 'life', 'catch', 'criminals.Just', 'Training', 'Day', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'mesmerizing', 'commanding', 'attention', 'person', 'who', 'have', 'limits', 'conscience', 'evil', 'side', 'least', 'character', 'capable', 'evil', 'Man', 'Fire', 'fascinating', 'truly', 'Washington', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'elite', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Likewise', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'role', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'ragged', 'nature', 'exude', 'exact', 'feel', 'look', 'character', 'portraying', 'What', 'disappointing', 'however', 'epic', 'meeting', 'stars', 'when', 'DeNiro', 'Pacino', 'met', 'diner', 'Heat', 'barely', 'share', 'screen', 'viewer', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'locked', 'horns', 'truly', 'important', 'powerful', 'scene.Another', 'knock', 'movie', 'length', 'whopping', '2', 'hrs', '37', 'min', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'were', 'more', 'action', 'just', ""n't"", 'case', 'Aside', 'three', 'four', 'real', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'boringly', 'slow', 'times', 'drags', 'others', 'wonderful', 'story', 'telling', 'j', 'u', 's', 't', 'l', 't', 't', 'l', 'e', 's', 'l', 'o', 'connoisseur', 'gangster', 'movies', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'actual', 'committing', 'crimes', '-department', 'even', 'slightly', 'insignificant', 'only', 'keep', 'blood', 'pumping.Nevertheless', 'American', 'Gangster', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'drama', 'storyline', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'see', 'two', 'heavyweights', 'Washington', 'Crowe', 'square', 'off', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable']",American Gangster

1131345,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0011HOEY4,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 4]","I like this movie for what it's worth. We're treated to either side of mobster film, both unlawful and law enforcement; ""American Gangster"" plays like an assortment of 'Scarface' (there's a ruthless low hit-man becoming a drug emperor), 'The Godfather' (a calm, respectful, business like man rules over his mafia empire), 'The French Connection' (undercover cops go pursuing cryptic criminals in America, who do business in foreign lands), 'The Untouchables' (incorruptible good cop selects hand-picked team of cops he trusts to bring down notorious gangland leader), and you know all the rest. It's an intriguing, entertaining, and entrancing crime story. ""American Gangster"" is a solid mob movie. It's amazing watching this film and realizing how long he went unnoticed and unsuspected by the NYPD.Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington hand in non-surprising solid performances and Ridley Scott directs the story tastefully, although it could have used a bit more speed. You find yourself looking at your watch a couple of times. Where Scorsese and even De Palma have directed overlong gangster movies that keep you on the edge of your seat from the first minute to the last, Scott made this one as unagitated as most of his great movies (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiatior"") - and apparently people like him for it, so maybe it's just me who's got a problem with that.Personally, I didn't feel connected enough. The main characters don't ever meet each other until the very end and then it's over way too quickly. Especially, Denzel Washington's change of ambition seems a bit rushed there and the ending is more than a bit reminiscent of ""GoodFellas"". Pretty much the whole film doesn't really feel fresh anymore even though I took well to Washington's role. Sure he's just like he is in most of his other movies but we routed for him just like how we routed for Al Pacino in Scarface. In fact, Peter Travers calls this movie the black Scarface. I agree with him partially. The tense job an unbribable cop has to do in a corrupt environment, the schizophrenic life of a gangster who is a loving family man in one minute and brutal killer with no qualms in the next, the glamorous rise and fall of a gangster boss. It never really gets old, but the more movies like this are being made, the less surprising they'll become.",4,3.5-Ridley Scott--is not a rip-off; it's an homage to every wise-guy classic to touch the screen,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2325,"['like', 'movie', 'what', 'worth', ""'re"", 'treated', 'side', 'mobster', 'film', 'unlawful', 'law', 'enforcement', 'American', 'Gangster', 'assortment', ""'Scarface"", 'ruthless', 'low', 'hit-man', 'becoming', 'drug', 'emperor', 'Godfather', 'calm', 'respectful', 'business', 'man', 'rules', 'mafia', 'empire', 'French', 'Connection', 'undercover', 'cops', 'go', 'pursuing', 'cryptic', 'criminals', 'America', 'who', 'do', 'business', 'foreign', 'lands', 'Untouchables', 'incorruptible', 'good', 'cop', 'selects', 'hand-picked', 'team', 'cops', 'bring', 'down', 'notorious', 'gangland', 'leader', 'know', 'rest', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'entrancing', 'crime', 'story', 'American', 'Gangster', 'solid', 'mob', 'movie', 'amazing', 'watching', 'film', 'realizing', 'how', 'long', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'unsuspected', 'NYPD.Russell', 'Crowe', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'hand', 'non-surprising', 'solid', 'performances', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'story', 'tastefully', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'speed', 'find', 'looking', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'Where', 'Scorsese', 'even', 'De', 'Palma', 'have', 'directed', 'overlong', 'gangster', 'movies', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'first', 'minute', 'last', 'Scott', 'made', 'one', 'as', 'unagitated', 'most', 'great', 'movies', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Gladiatior', 'apparently', 'people', 'so', 'maybe', 'just', 'who', 'got', 'problem', 'that.Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'connected', 'enough', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'meet', 'other', 'very', 'end', 'then', 'over', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'Especially', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'change', 'ambition', 'bit', 'rushed', 'there', 'ending', 'more', 'bit', 'reminiscent', 'GoodFellas', 'Pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'fresh', 'anymore', 'even', 'took', 'well', 'Washington', 'role', 'Sure', 'just', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'routed', 'just', 'how', 'routed', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Scarface', 'fact', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'movie', 'black', 'Scarface', 'agree', 'partially', 'tense', 'job', 'unbribable', 'cop', 'do', 'corrupt', 'environment', 'schizophrenic', 'life', 'gangster', 'who', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'one', 'minute', 'brutal', 'killer', 'qualms', 'next', 'glamorous', 'rise', 'fall', 'gangster', 'boss', 'never', 'really', 'old', 'more', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'less', 'surprising', ""'ll"", 'become']",American Gangster
1131346,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0011HOEY4,J from NY,"[1, 2]","During the entirety of ""American Gangster"", the story of legendary scumbag Frank Lucas who ran the Harlem Mafia for 20 years, I wanted Denzel Washington to stop acting princpled, gentlemanly, professional and revert to ""Training Day"" mode.  Nostalgia for his monstrously depraved, charismatic dirty cop hit me in waves, particularly when he was conversing with Russsell Crowe at the end of the movie.Altogether, this is less an attempt at an honest portrayal of what the brilliant drugdealer was like than an attempt to create a ""black Godfather"".  Lucas is not the guy for this and despite Denzel Washington's superb acting skills, one cannot turn a heroin dealer from the ghetto into Marlon Brando's Don Corleone with this cast lineup.  The supporting actors are not there and the film moves too fast from nightclub to nightclub, sporadic murder to murder, betrayal to betrayal.  Crowe's Richie Roberts, a cop who did what he was suppposed to do at a time very few others were, has said that this movie is only ""20 percent"" true. In Frank Lucas' own words: ""They should have never made a movie about me.""Washington's Lucas is too evasive to really grab a hold of.  He is a bad dude, that much is clear: when a particularly nasty rival challenges him to shoot ""in front of everybody"" on a Harlem streetcorner, he obliges.  Washington's performance is so compelling that one wants to know more about Lucas--where did he come from, why did he end up with Bumpy Johnson, why is he such a tough guy, and what are his motives for even being in this business? But the flash and glitter of the film allow for no such answers.  What is clear is that Lucas is simply another capitalist in many ways.  When a rival by the name of Nikki Barnes cuts the purity of his infamous ""Blue Magic"" down for no apparent reason, Washington visits him and says: ""Blue Magic"" is like ""Pepsi"".  Okay?  I stand behind the product, and it's fast selling.""  Lucas may not even see what he's doing as evil.  It's simply the way he makes money and it's very successful.This is movie is basically a testoterone rush and as that it works very well.

1131347,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B0011HOEY4,J. O. Booker,"[3, 4]","On another film I reviewed on Amazon, I said that I only follow directors and not actors. Here, I'll make two strong exceptions. But, first let me digress a moment to applaud Mr. Scott for yet another great film. There are directors who I look upon as the infrastructure--the superhighways--on today's movie landscape. Spielberg, Cameron, Scorsese, Scott (Tony), Lynne, Tarantino, Greengrass, Nolan, Greenaway, Tykwer, Verhoeven, Noe, Amoldavar, Jackson, Inarritu, Anno, Lee--when I see these names attached to any movie, I automatically know that the movie's going to at least be decent, if not, damn good. If Hollywood had a Mount Rushmore, Ridley Scott's image--and those of his contemporaries--should be deeply etched one stratum below the immortal images of Hitcock, Fellini, Bergman, Lang, Coppola, Powell, Kubrick, Kurosawa, etc. From BladeRunner, to Alien, to Gladiator, and now American Gangster, Ridley Scott's canon of films are among the best films ever.Now, to my two exceptions: First, Denzel Washington. The man ages like wine. Like DeNiro or Clint Eastwood, Washington is a ticket pull all by himself. His presence and machismo overpowers the screen. He makes a bad movie watchable. In fact, I can't recall the last bad movie he starred in, which speaks a lot of his intelligence in selecting quality scripts.Secondly, there's Russell Crowe. Like Denzel, Russell Crowe is a man's man in every role he plays, whether he's playing good-guy or bad-guy it doesn't matter. He proves that the leading man doesn't have to be Brad-Pitt-pretty-boy to be a Hollywood leading man. Russell's got the kind of durable rugged looks and powerful rottweiler build you're likely to see on some guy in the middle of the road driving a jackhammer through the pavement. Or the kind of guy you'd envision out on probation--the kind of guy you wouldn't want to see at night in a dark alley. Like Denzel, Russell can carry a movie on his back, and also like Denzel, Russell knows how to select quality scripts.American Gangster is the story of Frank Lucas and his rise to the pinnacle of Harlem's organized crime world. Under the tutelage of his ailing mentor, Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas foresees the end of the old model of organized crime based on middlemen, exaggerated profits, and diluted product. Young Lucas is Johnson's personal driver and sole prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Following Johnson's death, Harlem's drug scene washes into a violent free-for-all with up and comers battling to succeed Bumpy as Harlem's kingpin. Meanwhile, Frank Lucas is aloof. Even before Bumpy's death, Frank had been quietly formulating his own schemes for life and crime AFTER ol' Bump, who'd constantly lament about the good old days of customer service, middlemen, and respect among thieves. Bumpy's death frees Frank to do business a different way.He disrupts the monopoly of the New York Italian Mafia. Frank personally flies to Asia and establishes a direct link to smuggle heroin into the U.S.  He enlists a distant cousin, U.S. Army sergeant Leslie ""Ike"" Atkinson, to transport his dope into the U.S. inside the coffins of dead soldiers. With no middlemen, Frank's dope, called Blue Magic, is 100% pure on the streets of Harlem. Frank organizes his immediate family and cousins in ancillary posts--or fronts--throughout his drug network, from processing, measuring, and packaging, to receiving and distribution. Because Frank carries himself conservative and low-key, he's able to avoid the cops.Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a persistent New Jersey Cop determined to find out who's taken over Bumpy's turf. For a while, Frank is invisible. Then, one night he makes a big mistake. He shows up at an Ali fight in full regalia, draped from head to toe in mink and chinchilla, and festooned in diamonds and gold. He's shaking hands with the movie stars, the boxers, and the Mafia figures. Richie Roberts spies all of this from a distance through his binoculars--now the cops know who has taken over Bumpy's turf.Richie, however, has his own problems; he's a poor and honest cop. Discovering almost one-million dollars in the trunk of a car, Richie does the wrong thing and turns in the money without divvying it up with the force. His wife is leaving him because he makes peanuts as an honest cop.Both Richie and Frank are opposite sides of a coin: want of money disrupts Richie's life; wealth is not enough to prevent Frank's marriage and family from disintegrating. Richie's on the right side of the law, and Frank's on the wrong side of the law. Both lose everything.From the music, the sets, the cars, and the costumes, American Gangster is solid entertainment all the way.",5,Can ya feel me!!!,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,4670,"['film', 'reviewed', 'Amazon', 'said', 'only', 'follow', 'directors', 'not', 'actors', 'Here', ""'ll"", 'make', 'two', 'strong', 'exceptions', 'first', 'let', 'digress', 'moment', 'applaud', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'yet', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'directors', 'who', 'look', 'infrastructure', 'superhighways', 'today', 'movie', 'landscape', 'Spielberg', 'Cameron', 'Scorsese', 'Scott', 'Tony', 'Lynne', 'Tarantino', 'Greengrass', 'Nolan', 'Greenaway', 'Tykwer', 'Verhoeven', 'Noe', 'Amoldavar', 'Jackson', 'Inarritu', 'Anno', 'Lee', 'when', 'see', 'names', 'attached', 'movie', 'automatically', 'know', 'movie', 'going', 'least', 'be', 'decent', 'not', 'damn', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'image', 'contemporaries', 'should', 'be', 'deeply', 'etched', 'one', 'stratum', 'immortal', 'images', 'Hitcock', 'Fellini', 'Bergman', 'Lang', 'Coppola', 'Powell', 'Kubrick', 'Kurosawa', 'etc', 'BladeRunner', 'Alien', 'Gladiator', 'now', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'canon', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'films', 'ever.Now', 'two', 'exceptions', 'First', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'man', 'wine', 'DeNiro', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Washington', 'ticket', 'presence', 'machismo', 'overpowers', 'screen', 'bad', 'movie', 'watchable', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'last', 'bad', 'movie', 'starred', 'lot', 'intelligence', 'selecting', 'quality', 'scripts.Secondly', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Denzel', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'man', 'man', 'role', 'playing', 'good-guy', 'bad-guy', ""n't"", 'matter', 'leading', 'man', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Brad-Pitt-pretty-boy', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'man', 'Russell', 'got', 'kind', 'durable', 'rugged', 'looks', 'powerful', 'rottweiler', 'build', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'guy', 'middle', 'road', 'driving', 'jackhammer', 'pavement', 'kind', 'guy', ""'d"", 'envision', 'out', 'probation', 'kind', 'guy', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'night', 'dark', 'alley', 'Denzel', 'Russell', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'back', 'also', 'Denzel', 'Russell', 'how', 'select', 'quality', 'scripts.American', 'Gangster', 'story', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'rise', 'pinnacle', 'Harlem', 'organized', 'crime', 'world', 'tutelage', 'ailing', 'mentor', 'Ellsworth', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'end', 'old', 'model', 'organized', 'crime', 'based', 'middlemen', 'exaggerated', 'profits', 'diluted', 'product', 'Young', 'Lucas', 'Johnson', 'personal', 'driver', 'sole', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Following', 'Johnson', 'death', 'Harlem', 'drug', 'scene', 'washes', 'violent', 'free-for-all', 'up', 'comers', 'battling', 'succeed', 'Bumpy', 'Harlem', 'kingpin', 'Meanwhile', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'aloof', 'Even', 'Bumpy', 'death', 'Frank', 'had', 'been', 'quietly', 'formulating', 'own', 'schemes', 'life', 'crime', 'AFTER', 'ol', 'Bump', 'who', ""'d"", 'constantly', 'lament', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'customer', 'service', 'middlemen', 'respect', 'thieves', 'Bumpy', 'death', 'frees', 'Frank', 'do', 'business', 'different', 'way.He', 'monopoly', 'New', 'York', 'Italian', 'Mafia', 'Frank', 'personally', 'Asia', 'direct', 'link', 'smuggle', 'heroin', 'U.S', 'distant', 'cousin', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'sergeant', 'Leslie', 'Ike', 'Atkinson', 'transport', 'dope', 'U.S.', 'coffins', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'middlemen', 'Frank', 'dope', 'called', 'Blue', 'Magic', '100', '%', 'pure', 'streets', 'Harlem', 'Frank', 'immediate', 'family', 'cousins', 'ancillary', 'posts', 'fronts', 'drug', 'network', 'processing', 'measuring', 'packaging', 'receiving', 'distribution', 'Frank', 'conservative', 'low-key', 'able', 'avoid', 'cops.Richie', 'Roberts', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'persistent', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Cop', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'Bumpy', 'turf', 'while', 'Frank', 'invisible', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'big', 'mistake', 'up', 'Ali', 'fight', 'full', 'regalia', 'draped', 'head', 'toe', 'mink', 'chinchilla', 'festooned', 'diamonds', 'gold', 'shaking', 'hands', 'movie', 'stars', 'boxers', 'Mafia', 'figures', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'distance', 'binoculars', 'now', 'cops', 'know', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'Bumpy', 'turf.Richie', 'however', 'own', 'problems', 'poor', 'honest', 'cop', 'Discovering', 'almost', 'one-million', 'dollars', 'trunk', 'car', 'Richie', 'wrong', 'thing', 'money', 'divvying', 'up', 'force', 'wife', 'leaving', 'peanuts', 'honest', 'cop.Both', 'Richie', 'Frank', 'are', 'opposite', 'sides', 'coin', 'want', 'money', 'disrupts', 'Richie', 'life', 'wealth', 'not', 'enough', 'prevent', 'Frank', 'marriage', 'family', 'disintegrating', 'Richie', 'right', 'side', 'law', 'Frank', 'wrong', 'side', 'law', 'lose', 'music', 'sets', 'cars', 'costumes', 'American', 'Gangster', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'way']",American Gangster

This is a Horatio Alger story, Harlem-style -- the rise and fall of a drug lord who bests the competition with old-fashioned MBA tactics: a product twice as good at half the price.The entrepreneur is Frank Lucas, played by wolfishly lean-and-hungry Denzel Washington. His product is ""Blue Magic,"" heroin smuggled to the States from Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War years. In the august American tradition, Lucas manifests his destiny with a little get-up-and-go, innovative marketing/distribution tactics, name-branding, and ends by establishing a business monolith on the streets of New York.""American Gangster"" would make an interesting (if near unwatchable) double-feature with ""There Will Be Blood."" Both are gruesome, indicting explorations of the American Dream skewed, twisted, and transformed into the American Nightmare. Both examine the Darwinian nature (""red in tooth and claw"") of American capitalism -- kill or be killed, survival-of-the-fittest, last man standing. Both feature repulsive yet hypnotic antiheroes whose ambition is matched by their amorality. Both movies are long, violent, and bludgeoning.Unfortunately, ""Gangster"" lacks ""Blood's"" obsessive focus on its main character. Washington is magnetic as the cool but volatile Lucas, while his costar Russell Crowe gets stuck with the perfunctory part of dogged detective on Lucas' trail, the one good cop in a corrupt city. This parallel storyline adds unnecessary poundage to an already flabby script, especially the sub-subplot involving divorce proceedings with the requisitely long-suffering wife. (Perhaps Denzel is getting revenge. Remember a movie from years back called ""Virtuosity""? Probably not, but if you do it's only because a young, relatively unknown Aussie named Russell Crowe stole the movie blind from its supposed star, Denzel. Now it's Denzel's turn to slow-burn as the bad guy.)The viewer has to wade through a whole lot of muck to arrive at the big showdown between Russell and Denzel (I mean, Richie Roberts and Frank Lucas). It's almost worth the wait. Their scenes together have a wit and energy the rest of movie lacks.

Denzel plays Frank Lucas, who eventually becomes a heroine kingpin after his boss, and mentor, dies in 70's Harlem. What makes Frank so different in the drug game is that his stuff isn't chopped up or diluted in any form, it's indeed the purest heroine that anyone has ever seen before. What makes this movie so good is that they actually show you how Frank succeeded in trafficking these drugs into the U.S for years without our government knowing anything about it. Don't get me wrong, I also wanna make mention of one of my favorite rappers too, and that's T.I who plays Stevie Lucas, and that's Franks nephew. With that said, Denzel made this movie once again.

The saga of heroin kingpin Frank Lucas is a darkly compelling story, and it's told brilliantly in American Gangster. The movie is raw and tense, uncompromising in its depictions of both the drug-driven underground and the society that allows it to exist. Indeed, one of this movie's biggest strengths is that it manages to create the only kind of context in which someone like Frank Lucas can be a hero, and even a sympathetic character- in the film's world of greed, blind ambition, and bottomless corruption, Frank is just another guy trying to make a living. He just happens to be really good at it.Of course, it doesn't hurt that Denzel Washington is absolutely stunning is Lucas, playing the part with a hypnotic- and utterly heartless- charisma. He oozes raw cool and restrained magnetism, moving and speaking with a kind of quiet (but utterly acidic) grace. Russell Crowe (as Richie Roberts, Lucas' policeman rival) doesn't even come close to topping Washington, but he's still fantastic.To be fair, the movie isn't perfect- it's a bit longer than its story allows, filling out its running time with a few too many Roberts scenes. It's not that he isn't a compelling character, but the finer details of his personal life (a custody battle, a messy divorce, etc.) aren't nearly as interesting as Lucas' megalomaniacal rise to power, and as a result they cause the film's energy to drag. In general, there's a lot of unnecessary setup, and a few ideas that aren't as well developed as they could have been.

However, I never read much about it first, and therefore didn't realize that it was based on a true story which happened in the 1970s.  I saw it simply as another Hollywood formula flick with Denzel Washington cast as the drug kingpin and Russell Crowe cast as the honest cop who brings him down.  That said, I relaxed and enjoyed the film, but I must say that I laughed out loud often because of what seemed like a very contrived plot.  For example, the cop character turns in a million dollars in unmarked bills making him hated by other cops and therefore incorruptible.  And the African American drug kingpin from the South buys a house for his mama.  Denzel Washington plays it cool, so cool in fact that he seems unreal, especially in the scenes where he goes to Southeast Asia to buy drugs from the source.  He is always dapper and in control of all emotions.  His role called for little if any subtleties.  Russell Crowe, on the other hand, had a more difficult role to play.  His character was always full of self doubt.  In spite of that, or perhaps because of that, it became a mission for him to arrest Denzel Washington.  How it all plays out makes a fast, well paced film, which held my interest throughout.It was only at the end of the film that I realized that the story was real, and then I went flying to the internet to learn more background.  This gives the film a different context and I appreciated it more.

He didn't go walking through the jungle in Vietnam to meet the people who sold the drugs. He wasn't a socially sophisticated guy. He was a hick from North Carolina who figured out a way to smuggle the high quality drugs which became available in southeast asia after 1970 to the US through a friend in the army. He was well known to police. As far as I can tell, he never killed people in broad daylight in the street and then continued his lunch. He wasn't arrested coming out of Church with his mother. He didn't slap around Nicky Barnes. And all the stuff about him feuding with police (blowing up cars and so on) is also made up.And when Frank Lucas was arrested, he didn't get his sentence reduced by going after corruption in the police. He got his time reduced by becoming a government witness against almost everyone else in the drug trade on the east coast.Nearly all of the story of Richie Roberts (the prosecutor) is also false. The whole notion of him as the sole crusader who took down Frank Lucas is false. He wasn't even the lead on the case. And many of the stories he tells about himself had no other source but him.The film is ok for what it is. But people should not use real names and real events in what is an entirely fictional story. And thats what happened in this film. Half the fiction in the film seems to serve no other purpose but to turn Lucas into a somewhat sympathic character. The other half (Richie Roberts) seems designed for little more than providing a way to attack the police.The film would have been much better if it had sticked to the truth and eliminated the Richie Roberts character.

1131375,A17BUUBOU0598B,B0011HOEY4,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[30, 34]","American Gangster 2-Disc Unrated Extended EditionIn American Gangster Ridley Scott has created the perfect storm of an American movie masterpiece.  An amazing group of actors, headlined by Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe, produces a very convincing period piece of 1970s New Jersey and New York and the crime culture that existed there.  It's hard to feel anything but shame watchig this movie.  This movie is both believable and tragic, and it startles me that neither Crowe nor Washington received nominations for two incredible performances.The Story and the ScriptThe story is supposed to be based on the real life exploits of Frank Lucas.  Movies like this usually exaggerate.  The fact that this movie is so believable makes it all the more tragic.  There are no black and white characters and we are left to choose between murdering drug pushers and crooked cops.The writing and the story structure are both excellent.  The plot is developed slowly and masterfully.  While there is less shooting and action than one would expect from such a tale, the movie is filled with drama and suspense.CinematographyThey have managed to create a period piece here that is beautiful, gritty, real and romanticized.  The framing of the actors and the skylines are beautiful.  Much of the scenery and shots are darkly lit.  This is most often used in the scenes with the police in their shadowy research rooms, clearly to juxtapose them against the Lucas empire, almost always shown in the light.The first disk in the unrated edition is in a beautiful widescreen.  Don't know why they list this as full-screen, perhaps because there is a full screen version available on the other side.  TheActing and DirectionI don't know whether it's award winning acting or directing that makes the end result so good, but I would be willing to guess that it's both. Denzel is steady and appears to be taking on a similar persona in his recent films.  Crowe is more fantastic than even his normal performance, portraying the troubled police investigator caught between a crime ridden New York / New Jersey and the even more criminal Special Investigative Unit.All the acting is great, and this movie could easily have won for best ensemble cast.  Josh Brolin is solid in a limited though well executed part.  The directing is textbook mastery.Bottom line, this movie should have gotten nominated for best actor, best supporting actor, best direction and best picture.  It probably should have one a few of those categories.  Michael Clayton, Eastern Promises?  Give me a break.The nominations for art direction and for Ruby Dee as best supporting actress in a very limited role were not enough compared to the strength of this movie.Features and ExtrasThe unrated extended edition has an entire disk of special features.  The making-of extra is not just a featurette, it's a feature-length documentary.  You get an in-depth look into every aspect of the film's creation.There are also three in depth ""case-files"" on film research, script adaptation and police techniques.The deleted scenes include an alternate opening sequence.  Finally, the theatrical trailer includes writer and director feature commentary.  A very nice set of extras indeed.ConclusionThis is absolutely a masterful , one of the best this year.  This DVD needs to be added to your collection.Enjoy!",5,American Gangster - Awesome and Tragic (Spoiler Free Review),1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,3351,"['American', 'Gangster', '2-Disc', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'EditionIn', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'created', 'perfect', 'storm', 'American', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'amazing', 'group', 'actors', 'headlined', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'very', 'convincing', 'period', 'piece', '1970s', 'New', 'Jersey', 'New', 'York', 'crime', 'culture', 'existed', 'there', 'hard', 'feel', 'anything', 'shame', 'watchig', 'movie', 'movie', 'believable', 'tragic', 'Crowe', 'Washington', 'received', 'nominations', 'two', 'incredible', 'performances.The', 'Story', 'ScriptThe', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'exploits', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Movies', 'usually', 'exaggerate', 'fact', 'movie', 'so', 'believable', 'more', 'tragic', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'choose', 'murdering', 'drug', 'pushers', 'crooked', 'cops.The', 'writing', 'story', 'structure', 'are', 'excellent', 'plot', 'developed', 'slowly', 'masterfully', 'less', 'shooting', 'action', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'tale', 'movie', 'filled', 'drama', 'suspense.CinematographyThey', 'have', 'managed', 'create', 'period', 'piece', 'here', 'beautiful', 'gritty', 'real', 'romanticized', 'framing', 'actors', 'skylines', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Much', 'scenery', 'shots', 'are', 'darkly', 'lit', 'most', 'often', 'used', 'scenes', 'police', 'shadowy', 'research', 'rooms', 'clearly', 'juxtapose', 'Lucas', 'empire', 'almost', 'always', 'shown', 'light.The', 'first', 'disk', 'unrated', 'edition', 'beautiful', 'widescreen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'list', 'full-screen', 'perhaps', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'available', 'other', 'side', 'TheActing', 'DirectionI', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'award', 'winning', 'acting', 'directing', 'end', 'result', 'so', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'guess', 'Denzel', 'steady', 'be', 'taking', 'similar', 'persona', 'recent', 'films', 'Crowe', 'more', 'fantastic', 'even', 'normal', 'performance', 'portraying', 'troubled', 'police', 'investigator', 'caught', 'crime', 'ridden', 'New', 'York', '/', 'New', 'Jersey', 'even', 'more', 'criminal', 'Special', 'Investigative', 'Unit.All', 'acting', 'great', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'solid', 'limited', 'though', 'well', 'executed', 'part', 'directing', 'textbook', 'mastery.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'best', 'direction', 'best', 'picture', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'one', 'few', 'categories', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Give', 'break.The', 'nominations', 'art', 'direction', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'very', 'limited', 'role', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'compared', 'strength', 'movie.Features', 'ExtrasThe', 'unrated', 'extended', 'edition', 'entire', 'disk', 'special', 'features', 'making-of', 'extra', 'not', 'just', 'featurette', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'get', 'in-depth', 'look', 'aspect', 'film', 'creation.There', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'depth', 'case-files', 'film', 'research', 'script', 'adaptation', 'police', 'techniques.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'writer', 'director', 'feature', 'commentary', 'very', 'nice', 'set', 'extras', 'indeed.ConclusionThis', 'absolutely', 'masterful', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'DVD', 'be', 'added', 'collection.Enjoy']",American Gangster
1131376,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0011HOEY4,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","The late 60s and early 70s gave us a lot of different things to remember. Apparently one of them was the burgeoning business of drug dealing. While a number of drug smugglers came and went, there was one that made a killing, literally, during this time. His name was Frank Lucas and his story is told in this dynamic drama/biopic.Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, the right hand man of criminal mastermind Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). When Bumpy passes away, Frank takes over his action in the streets of Harlem. At the same time, several others attempt to do the same. It only ends in a bloody finish with Frank on top.Looking for a way to make the sale of heroin more profitable, Frank decided to cut out the middle man and go direct. Via his cousin in Vietnam, he contacts one of the largest wholesale dealers there. The pair strike a deal and soon Frank is smuggling in large amounts, cutting it less than his competition and selling more and more.At the same time, an overly honest cop by the name of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is doing his best to put an end to the dope dealers. Disliked by other policemen because of his honesty (he even turns in $1,000,000 that he finds during a stake out), Frank is sought out by his supervisor when a drug task force is formed in New Jersey. Choosing their men carefully, the team sets out to take down the suppliers of drugs rather than the street hustlers.The paths of these two men will eventually cross, but the story revolves more around Frank Lucas. Frank brings in his brothers to back him in his business dealings and sales. He rules the streets with a savage brutality and at the same time does what he can to help the people of the neighborhood. These people look up to him full well knowing what it is he does for a living.Preferring to attract as little attention to himself as possible, a single night wearing a fur coat to a championship boxing event leads to Frank's picture being taken. This is the first step that Richie and his team take to discovering that Frank is the main supplier of heroin in the city. It is the first step in the end of Frank's reign of the streets.As always, Washington does a fantastic job in his performance here, exuding the cool, calculated ways of Frank Lucas as well as the outburst of anger and menace when times change. Crowe does an admirable job as well, showing Richie's discomfort with public speaking and his change, the confidence he gains as he reaches that moment where he captures the man behind the myth.Brutal, honest and a true story to boot, this movie is one that should be seen not only for the tale of two individuals but as a precautionary tale for anyone considering this lifestyle as well as the toll taken by heroin users. A bonus here is interviews with both the real life Richie Roberts and Frank Lucas who helped with the making of this movie. To think that Lucas made it back to the free world is amazing. To think he lived to see a movie made of his life is even more so.",5,"A ""REAL"" AMERICAN",1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,3005,"['late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'gave', 'lot', 'different', 'things', 'remember', 'Apparently', 'one', 'was', 'burgeoning', 'business', 'drug', 'dealing', 'number', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'came', 'went', 'was', 'one', 'made', 'killing', 'literally', 'time', 'name', 'was', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'story', 'told', 'dynamic', 'drama/biopic.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Lucas', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'When', 'Bumpy', 'away', 'Frank', 'action', 'streets', 'Harlem', 'same', 'time', 'several', 'others', 'attempt', 'do', 'same', 'only', 'bloody', 'finish', 'Frank', 'top.Looking', 'way', 'make', 'sale', 'heroin', 'more', 'profitable', 'Frank', 'decided', 'cut', 'out', 'middle', 'man', 'go', 'direct', 'Via', 'cousin', 'Vietnam', 'one', 'largest', 'wholesale', 'dealers', 'there', 'pair', 'strike', 'deal', 'soon', 'Frank', 'smuggling', 'large', 'amounts', 'cutting', 'less', 'competition', 'selling', 'more', 'more.At', 'same', 'time', 'overly', 'honest', 'cop', 'name', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'doing', 'best', 'put', 'end', 'dope', 'dealers', 'Disliked', 'other', 'policemen', 'honesty', 'even', '1,000,000', 'stake', 'out', 'Frank', 'sought', 'out', 'supervisor', 'when', 'drug', 'task', 'force', 'formed', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Choosing', 'men', 'carefully', 'team', 'out', 'take', 'down', 'suppliers', 'drugs', 'rather', 'street', 'hustlers.The', 'paths', 'two', 'men', 'will', 'eventually', 'cross', 'story', 'more', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Frank', 'brothers', 'back', 'business', 'dealings', 'sales', 'rules', 'streets', 'savage', 'brutality', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'people', 'look', 'up', 'full', 'well', 'knowing', 'what', 'living.Preferring', 'attract', 'little', 'attention', 'possible', 'single', 'night', 'wearing', 'fur', 'coat', 'championship', 'boxing', 'event', 'Frank', 'picture', 'being', 'taken', 'first', 'step', 'Richie', 'team', 'take', 'discovering', 'Frank', 'main', 'supplier', 'heroin', 'city', 'first', 'step', 'end', 'Frank', 'reign', 'streets.As', 'always', 'Washington', 'fantastic', 'job', 'performance', 'here', 'exuding', 'cool', 'calculated', 'ways', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'as', 'well', 'outburst', 'anger', 'menace', 'when', 'times', 'change', 'Crowe', 'admirable', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'Richie', 'discomfort', 'public', 'speaking', 'change', 'confidence', 'gains', 'moment', 'where', 'man', 'myth.Brutal', 'honest', 'true', 'story', 'boot', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'tale', 'two', 'individuals', 'precautionary', 'tale', 'anyone', 'considering', 'lifestyle', 'as', 'well', 'toll', 'taken', 'heroin', 'users', 'bonus', 'here', 'interviews', 'real', 'life', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'who', 'helped', 'making', 'movie', 'think', 'Lucas', 'made', 'back', 'free', 'world', 'amazing', 'think', 'lived', 'see', 'movie', 'made', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'so']",American Gangster

But Russell Crowe's child custody subplot is unnecessary as they could've mentioned it in one scene or even a line and it would've had the same impact.Plus, it lacks the scope and visceral shock of movies like the first two Godfather films or Goodfellas. There's nothing here you haven't really seen before (unless you're totally unfamiliar with the gangster genre) and no memorable/iconic sequences.Ridley Scott should probably stick to directing sword & sandal epics or sci-fi thrillers because this doesn't play to his strengths.

1131380,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B0011HOEY4,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[2, 5]","Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"" is a film of contrasts: the have and the have nots and the have and the have more than enough. It is also about the American Dream: realizing it, losing it and striving for it and never quite achieving it.All of this is centered on two characters: Frank Lucas (the incredibly strong and charismatic Denzel Washington) and Richie Roberts (the equally strong and charismatic Russell Crowe).Denzel plays Frank Lucas, a Harlem gang lord who runs a heroin empire circa 1969 in New York City bettering even the Mafia on their own turf with shrewd and knowing procurement of the drug directly from the producers in Asia. Crowe plays Richie Roberts, a New Jersey Cop, who pursues Lucas.Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has set up some interesting and dynamic contrasts here: Roberts (on the ""right"" side of the law) and Lucas (on the wrong side) are exact opposites in nature and in action. Roberts is a loose cannon at work (he is despised by his fellow officers because he turns in a million dollars that he and his partner find in an abandoned car: money that would have been divvied up among the cops on the take), craving a family (he has a wife and a son) who puts in none of the work that goes into sustaining such a relationship. Roberts's family is his group of fellow officers determined to bring down the drug traffickers. When Roberts's wife (Carla Gugino) wants to move to Las Vegas to begin a new life, Roberts half-heartedly makes an attempt to legally prevent her from doing so but in the end he concedes to her wishes because, basically a good, honest man, he realizes that his son would be better off without him.Lucas, on the other hand, is all about a huge extended family: Moms (a resplendent Ruby Dee), Wife (Lymari Nadal), brothers and sister and a bunch of in-laws who not only work for Lucas but also make sure to sit down to dinner at Moms every Sunday. Lucas puts in the work necessary to keep his family together and functional yet the family is supported by the unlawful distribution of heroin.(When Lucas is being interrogated by Roberts he says, ""I took care of Harlem, now Harlem is gonna take care of Me."")Lucas is also the ultimate in cool and control. He dresses like a banker, conducts himself with reverence for his Moms and his wife. At his mentor's funeral, he wipes up a glass spill and sets down a coaster so as to avoid this from happening again. The movie is filled with this type of telling character and behavior traits. Roberts dresses like a bum, conducts himself like a man without any social graces, lives in a hovel yet he is going to school at night to become a lawyer which requires major dedication and work.Zallian has set up an ambiguous and interesting situation in which our loyalties are torn between the ancient friction between good and bad: a bad man who does some good and a good man who does some bad. In the end we are genuinely disappointed when Lucas is caught and imprisoned.All the time I was watching the big broad Epic of Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"" all I could think about was: how much better, as in committed to this subject matter Sidney Lumet would have been. Lumet (all you have to do is watch what he does in ""The Verdict"" or ""The Prince of New York"" to see what I mean) would have brought a grounded sense of thoughtfulness and humanity to the proceedings that Scott almost achieves here which is not to say that ""American Gangster"" is without any of those things but more than anything this has to do with the exemplary performances of both Denzel and Russell Crowe who bring their best game to this film.""American Gangster"" is not a great film but it is a very good one with magnificent performances by Denzel and Russell Crowe. Don't come to ""American Gangster""expecting clear, precise morality fed to you with your popcorn...because you won't get it. What you will get is a conflicted, obtuse treatise on the folly and foibles inherent when pursuing your dreams in a country where all is possible, all is available yet nothing is guaranteed.",4,The Duel,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,4052,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'American', 'Gangster', 'film', 'contrasts', 'have', 'have', 'nots', 'have', 'have', 'more', 'enough', 'also', 'American', 'Dream', 'realizing', 'losing', 'striving', 'never', 'quite', 'achieving', 'it.All', 'centered', 'two', 'characters', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'equally', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'Russell', 'Crowe', '.Denzel', 'plays', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Harlem', 'gang', 'lord', 'who', 'heroin', 'empire', 'circa', '1969', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'bettering', 'even', 'Mafia', 'own', 'turf', 'shrewd', 'knowing', 'procurement', 'drug', 'directly', 'producers', 'Asia', 'Crowe', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Cop', 'who', 'Lucas.Screenwriter', 'Steve', 'Zaillian', 'set', 'up', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'contrasts', 'here', 'Roberts', 'right', 'side', 'law', 'Lucas', 'wrong', 'side', 'are', 'exact', 'opposites', 'nature', 'action', 'Roberts', 'loose', 'cannon', 'work', 'despised', 'fellow', 'officers', 'million', 'dollars', 'partner', 'find', 'abandoned', 'car', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'divvied', 'up', 'cops', 'take', 'craving', 'family', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'none', 'work', 'sustaining', 'such', 'relationship', 'Roberts', 'family', 'group', 'fellow', 'officers', 'determined', 'bring', 'down', 'drug', 'traffickers', 'When', 'Roberts', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'move', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'Roberts', 'half-heartedly', 'attempt', 'legally', 'prevent', 'doing', 'so', 'end', 'wishes', 'basically', 'good', 'honest', 'man', 'son', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'him.Lucas', 'other', 'hand', 'huge', 'extended', 'family', 'Moms', 'resplendent', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Wife', 'Lymari', 'Nadal', 'brothers', 'sister', 'bunch', 'in-laws', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'Lucas', 'also', 'make', 'sure', 'sit', 'down', 'dinner', 'Moms', 'Sunday', 'Lucas', 'work', 'necessary', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'functional', 'yet', 'family', 'supported', 'unlawful', 'distribution', 'heroin', 'When', 'Lucas', 'being', 'interrogated', 'Roberts', 'took', 'care', 'Harlem', 'now', 'Harlem', 'gon', 'take', 'care', 'Me', 'Lucas', 'also', 'ultimate', 'cool', 'control', 'banker', 'reverence', 'Moms', 'wife', 'mentor', 'funeral', 'up', 'glass', 'spill', 'sets', 'down', 'coaster', 'so', 'avoid', 'happening', 'again', 'movie', 'filled', 'type', 'telling', 'character', 'behavior', 'traits', 'Roberts', 'bum', 'man', 'social', 'graces', 'lives', 'hovel', 'yet', 'going', 'school', 'night', 'become', 'lawyer', 'major', 'dedication', 'work.Zallian', 'set', 'up', 'ambiguous', 'interesting', 'situation', 'loyalties', 'are', 'torn', 'ancient', 'friction', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'man', 'who', 'good', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'bad', 'end', 'are', 'genuinely', 'disappointed', 'when', 'Lucas', 'caught', 'imprisoned.All', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'big', 'broad', 'Epic', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'American', 'Gangster', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'committed', 'subject', 'matter', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Lumet', 'have', 'do', 'watch', 'what', 'Verdict', 'Prince', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'grounded', 'sense', 'thoughtfulness', 'humanity', 'proceedings', 'Scott', 'almost', 'here', 'not', 'say', 'American', 'Gangster', 'things', 'more', 'anything', 'do', 'exemplary', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'bring', 'best', 'game', 'film', 'American', 'Gangster', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Do', ""n't"", 'come', 'American', 'Gangster', 'expecting', 'clear', 'precise', 'morality', 'fed', 'popcorn', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'conflicted', 'obtuse', 'treatise', 'folly', 'foibles', 'inherent', 'when', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'country', 'where', 'possible', 'available', 'yet', 'nothing', 'guaranteed']",American Gangster

1131383,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B0011HOEY4,Mike Zimmerman,"[2, 4]","Back in the late 60s, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) was a driver for one of New York's leading crime figures. But after said person has a fatal heart attack that claims his life, Frank ponders where to go from there. That comes in the form of heroin, which he brings into the country inside coffins containing wounded soldiers who died in the Vietnam war. The heroin is pure, uncut stuff, which he calls ""Blue Magic"". With the help of his hoodlum bretheren (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Common, Warner Miller, Albert Jones, J. Kyle Manzay), he makes a profit off of it, and eventually marrying Miss Puerto Rico (Lymari Nadal) in the process.Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), an honest police detective, is not very popular with his crooked partners and is going through a divorce battle with his ex-wife Laurie (Carla Gugino). Now working with a cleaner team of drug enforcers, he can now take down Lucas' empire without much problems.""American Gangster"", along with ""Lions for Lambs"", is one of the many much anticipated films this fall looking to get cozy with the Golden Globe and Oscar crowd. One stars award winners Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and the other one has Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise. My pick? ""Gangster"", all the way.Of course, this isn't no ordinary crime drama that you've seen. All that's on the screen has been based on a true story (as instigated as the film kicks off) about real-life crime figure Frank Lucas. In 157 minutes of running time, ""American Gangster"" is told like a ""Scarface""-esque rags-to-riches story about a nobody who became a somebody from selling drugs. With that, he gets the money, power, and respect. But like ""Scarface"", the kingpin eventually doesn't maintain power forever. It's standard stuff, but director Ridley Scott manages to make some solid, riveting stuff out of it, thanks to a large cast of today's most popular African and Caucasian actors.Washington is in true form, but is anyone shocked? As Frank Lucas, the actor sells the stuff, whether it's waxing poetic about business, sharing time with his family (which also includes a welcome performance from Ruby Dee as Lucas' mother), confronting his rivals (Cuba Gooding Jr. leaves a huge chunk of a mark on the film as the flashy and flamboyant Nicky Barnes), or confronting Richie Roberts for the first time (it's shades of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's confrontation in Heat). It's standard stuff, but Washington is capable of finding ways to keep its shelf life dust-free.Russell Crowe makes an excellent adversary to Washington. Also doing another performance as a cop (he did L.A. Confidential, remember?), Crowe is able to juggle Richie Roberts' squeaky clean performance on the job to his flawed family life where he's about to lose his wife and kid to Las Vegas.Before I get into the rest of the cast, I'll need to do a little ribbing on Roger Bart. A usually fierce actor, he suffers from the Keira Knightley school of overcompensating and crap method acting. As a creepy attorney, he turns all indication lights and spews a racist tirade at Richie Roberts. The man can be usually reliable (""The Producers Musical"" - he's better suited in movies like that), but here, it's way out of place for a movie that requires relaxed acting (especially from Carla Gugino, whom Bart could've studied, cause she could've gone over the top too, but didn't). Regardless, it's only a small cameo. Moving on...Ridley Scott also assembled a star-studded cast to back up both Washington and Crowe: we've got Josh Brolin as a crooked cop (unlike Bart, Brolin doesn't need to overcompensate when playing a crooked figure), direct-to-video action star Armand Assante as a Mafia godfather, Idris Elba as one of Lucas' rivals, T.I. as a nephew who becomes enamored with his uncle's lifestyle (following in the footsteps, Ice Cube and LL Cool J, Mr. Clifford Harris is evolving into one of the more talented rapper-turned-actors; ""ATL"" definitely was no fluke), Anthony Hamilton in a cameo as a lounge singer, Wu-Tang head honcho RZA as one of Richie Roberts' new DEA co-workers, and some additional support from Ted Levine and ""Miami Vice""'s John Hawkes and John Ortiz.Sure, 157 minutes is long. But Scott does whatever he can to keep the audience's eyes glued to the screen. With nary a drawback in sight, and a soundtrack replete with 70's R&B; and rock (look out for Bobby Womack's soulful ""Across 110th Street""), ""American Gangster"" is definitely another crime epic to fit in a DVD collection of a fan who O.D.'s on films like ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather"".",5,"""This is my home.

1131386,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B0011HOEY4,Mr. J. Murdock,"[0, 0]","Denzel Washington did a marvelous job portraying Frankie Lucas as a debonair gentleman and entrepreneur who takes care of his family when the real life Lucas is uneducated, illiterate, vicious, mean spirited--in other words, the on-screen Lucas is the exact opposite of the real life Frankie Lucas.Lucas is a drug dealer who deals in premium quality drug known as ""Blue Magic""--which is 100% pure heroin. He sells it at a much cheaper price because he gets his supplies from a Vietnamese drug kingpin introduced to him by his cousin Nate, a soldier who is serving in Vietnam. This aggravates rival gangs and even corrupt police officers who sell their stuff more watered down than Blue Magic at a much higher cost. Obviously, if junkies need their fix they will go to Lucas and not to other competitors. This effectively puts them out of business so he made a lot of enemies throughout his career as a businessman.But American Gangster wants us to sympathize with Frankie Lucas who is sincere in getting his family out of poverty in the Deep South and moving them into his expensive mansion and using his connections to get his nephew a once-in-a-lifetime chance into major league baseball. What a guy!On his tail is Richie Roberts a New Jersey police officer who is battling a child custody case with his estranged wife Laurie. The truth, however, is the real life Richie Roberts never had a son. In the movie, we are led to believe that Richie single handedly, against all odds, with corrupt NYPD police officers and a partner who himself is a junkie was able to apprehend the biggest drug kingpin in the business with a small ragtag group of dedicated officers whose only objective is following the law. Roberts is portrayed as the ultimate boyscout who wouldn't even take $987,000 in stolen drug money recovered.Although much of the story in American Gangster has proven to be false, it still makes for entertaining viewing.

1131388,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B0011HOEY4,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","Wow.  After a glut of mediocre movies, how satisfying to find an intelligent, superbly shot and edited movie that works on several levels, and telling a true story to boot.Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, the Harlem drug lord who started as driver and general right hand man to the previous drug King of Harlem.  When his boss dies, Lucas brings a business ethic - capitalist thinking that any business school would be proud of, to the business.  Rebuilding the drug trade without relying on the middle men or the Mafia, and undercutting the competition, he created a brand name - a business success story as it were.  He uses a sound business model to beat the previously untoppled opposition.  If he is presented as a superb businessman, we also see him as a violent man, almost a thug, when `necessary'.  Make no mistake - this is not a film about action scenes, but where there is violence (and that means from the very first scene) it is stark and brutal., and not for the fainthearted.Russell Crowe on the other hand plays a cop - and in 70's Harlem, a real oddity - he's an honest cop, a man of integrity in his job.  Being an honest cop means he is the only one in a position to head up a new task force, hand picked by Crowe, to make major arrests to stem the drug flow into the city - and he sets his sights on Lucas' organisation.What's fascinating about the movie is the comparison of the two men.  In the same way `Heat' had flawed characters that refused to be stereotyped into pure good and pure bad, we equally have realistic characters here that make you uncomfortable.  We admire Lucas's business acumen and honesty in his relationship, and find ourselves trying to excuse his bursts of violence.  And on the other hand we admire the integrity of Crowe's cop, handing in a million bucks to do `the right thing', and ultimately confronting corruption in the cops (as exemplified in Josh Brolin's caharacter) even when it means alienating himself from his colleagues... and yet at the same time his marriage is a mess as he is a serial adulterer.. so is he a man if integrity when he can't bring the same uprightness into his marriage..?  His wife feels the very pain as a victim of dishonesty of her husband at home, that he seeks so hard to stamp out at work.  It's a fascinating character study that refuses to airbrush out flaws, but those very same dichotomies in the individuals make the ending so much more understandable, and indeed, plausible.Beyond these two, there are very few niggling problems - the wives are not well written and although important in the men's lives we never get a feel of what really makes them tick.  The length may put some people off - but I watched the extended version, which was 2 hours 38 minutes, and it flew past for me.The highlight of the movie is probably the moment, as in Heat, when the two men meet and have their head to head.  The d&eacute;nouement turns out not to be a Scarface orgy of violence, but something quite unexpected (unless you know the story already).This movie passed me by at the cinema for some reason, and what a shame.  For this is intelligent moviemaking for adults, multilayered fare to stimulate discussion and thought.  It's not an easy watch - the violence is sudden, strong and senseless, there is nudity, sex and violence, and the characters are not cuddly white hat and dark hat ciphers.  Instead we have a morally murky movie that actually tells a layered story, a story examining both character and capitalism .  It's a `Heat [Blu-ray]'-like period meld of `Serpico (Widescreen Edition)' and a Harlem `The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD', depending whose viewpoint you favour in the movie, and a welcome intelligent addition to the period crime genre.",5,Modern period crime classic,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,3767,"['Wow', 'glut', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'how', 'satisfying', 'find', 'intelligent', 'superbly', 'shot', 'edited', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'telling', 'true', 'story', 'boot.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Harlem', 'drug', 'lord', 'who', 'started', 'driver', 'general', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'previous', 'drug', 'King', 'Harlem', 'When', 'boss', 'dies', 'Lucas', 'business', 'ethic', 'capitalist', 'thinking', 'business', 'school', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'business', 'Rebuilding', 'drug', 'trade', 'relying', 'middle', 'men', 'Mafia', 'undercutting', 'competition', 'created', 'brand', 'name', 'business', 'success', 'story', 'were', 'sound', 'business', 'model', 'beat', 'previously', 'untoppled', 'opposition', 'presented', 'superb', 'businessman', 'also', 'see', 'violent', 'man', 'almost', 'thug', 'when', 'necessary', 'Make', 'mistake', 'not', 'film', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'violence', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'stark', 'brutal.', 'not', 'fainthearted.Russell', 'Crowe', 'other', 'hand', 'cop', '70', 'Harlem', 'real', 'oddity', 'honest', 'cop', 'man', 'integrity', 'job', 'Being', 'honest', 'cop', 'only', 'one', 'position', 'head', 'up', 'new', 'task', 'force', 'hand', 'picked', 'Crowe', 'make', 'major', 'arrests', 'stem', 'drug', 'flow', 'city', 'sights', 'Lucas', 'organisation.What', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'comparison', 'two', 'men', 'same', 'way', 'Heat', 'had', 'flawed', 'characters', 'refused', 'be', 'stereotyped', 'pure', 'good', 'pure', 'bad', 'equally', 'have', 'realistic', 'characters', 'here', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'admire', 'Lucas', 'business', 'acumen', 'honesty', 'relationship', 'find', 'trying', 'excuse', 'bursts', 'violence', 'other', 'hand', 'admire', 'integrity', 'Crowe', 'cop', 'handing', 'million', 'bucks', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'ultimately', 'confronting', 'corruption', 'cops', 'exemplified', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'caharacter', 'even', 'when', 'alienating', 'colleagues', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'marriage', 'mess', 'serial', 'adulterer..', 'so', 'man', 'integrity', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'same', 'uprightness', 'marriage..', 'wife', 'very', 'pain', 'victim', 'dishonesty', 'husband', 'home', 'so', 'hard', 'stamp', 'out', 'work', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'airbrush', 'out', 'flaws', 'very', 'same', 'dichotomies', 'individuals', 'make', 'ending', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'understandable', 'indeed', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'niggling', 'problems', 'wives', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'important', 'men', 'lives', 'never', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'really', 'tick', 'length', 'may', 'put', 'people', 'watched', 'extended', 'version', 'was', '2', 'hours', '38', 'minutes', 'flew', 'me.The', 'highlight', 'movie', 'probably', 'moment', 'Heat', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'meet', 'have', 'head', 'head', 'd', 'eacute', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'Scarface', 'orgy', 'violence', 'something', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'know', 'story', 'already', '.This', 'movie', 'passed', 'cinema', 'reason', 'what', 'shame', 'intelligent', 'moviemaking', 'adults', 'multilayered', 'fare', 'stimulate', 'discussion', 'thought', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'violence', 'sudden', 'strong', 'senseless', 'nudity', 'sex', 'violence', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'cuddly', 'white', 'hat', 'dark', 'ciphers', 'Instead', 'have', 'morally', 'murky', 'movie', 'actually', 'layered', 'story', 'story', 'examining', 'character', 'capitalism', 'Heat', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', ""'-like"", 'period', 'meld', 'Serpico', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Harlem', 'Godfather', 'Coppola', 'Restoration', 'Giftset', 'DVD', 'depending', 'viewpoint', 'favour', 'movie', 'welcome', 'intelligent', 'addition', 'period', 'crime', 'genre']",American Gangster

Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 6]","Though it languished in development-hell for some time, American Gangster has finally seen the light of day, with none other than visionary director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien, Blade Runner) at the helm.  Oscar winning mega-stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are the prime drawing point of the film, and both actors chew every bit of scenery that they can during the film's duration.  Washington is Frank Lucas, the newly christened drug kingpin of Harlem after taking the reigns from legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III), and soon finds himself hounded by crooked cops, rival dealers, and honest cop Richie Roberts (Crowe).  Though it really doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in the gangster epic genre, American Gangster is still a rousing and worthwhile crime epic that is carried by the power of its stars and director.  The action and set pieces are well done, but the film as a whole doesn't come close to the greatness that it aspires to emulate from other classics in the genre like Serpico and The Untouchables.  Flaws aside though, American Gangster is still a more than admirable true crime drama, which can be evidenced even more so on the unrated extended cut, which is included here along with the theatrical release.  The extended cut features much more character development, which isn't a bad thing at all when the cast includes Chiwetel Eliofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr, Ted Levine, Armand Assante, Deadwood's John Hawkes, rappers RZA and Common, and Ruby Dee in a brief Oscar nominated turn as Lucas' mother.

Russell Crowe is Det. Richie Roberts a Jewish straight cop whose honesty makes his department look bad. Roberts is assigned to bust drug barons while Lucas remains low-profile and takes control of Manhattan block by block.As far as gangster movies go this is no Scorsese, however it is a very good drama and there is a substantial twist in the end that makes it worth while.

I do however have a couple of negative points to make. First, the sound quality. Like Starr* Burst's review earlier, I found the dialogue difficult to hear and had to turn up the volume. The second point is the cast. It was difficult to envisage Cuba Gooding Jr as the flamboyant character he plays as I always see him in goofy kid movies and it kind of watered down the believability factor. The same goes with Denzel Washington, although he is a classy actor with some great movies under him, I had a hard time picturing him as this ruthless character Lucas, kind of like Tom Hanks playing a hitman in Road To Perdition, you know he's a nice guy.

In 1968 every news station reported that more and more people were beginning to experiment with this relatively new drug from Southeast Asia. It took just one man to put 2 and 2 together and take a quick trip to Vietnam before he was selling heroin that was twice as pure for half as much. And life was very good, but when life is too good people notice.I enjoyed the calm and collected manner in which Frank Lucas carried himself at almost all times. It is hard not to respect what he was able to do, despite the lives he ruined. I thought Denzel Washington did a good job as Lucas for most of the movie. Unfortunately for me, and I am not generally a Denzel fan, towards the end he started to pick up the flagrant arrogance and short temper that won him an Oscar in Training Day.I liked American Gangster, but I didn't love it. I don't like Denzel, but he was better than usual. I don't like Russell Crowe...and he wasn't any better than usual. Frank Lucas was an interesting man who tried to do things the right way, if there is a ""right way"" to grow your drug empire. I liked the movie because of the man it was about, not the execution.

Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[15, 18]","'American Gangster' is the story of Frank Lucas (Washington), the Harlem druglord who began as a driver and bodyguard for the notorious Bumpy Johnson, and ended up controlling a multi-million dollar heroin empire in his peak. Most of the film takes place during the Vietnam War, and without giving too much away, this circumstance plays a major role in Lucas' success. In fact, some may be shocked by the nefarious actions revealed by this aspect of the film. And of course, what's a good gangster flick without the righteous yet down on his luck cop, played here by Crowe, serving as the determined antagonist to Lucas' dreams of grandeur? There are also plenty of crooked cops to go around, and this plays an important role in the story as well.It is a very well-crafted film, and Washington and Crowe put on remarkable performances as usual, but unfortunately the film doesn't really offer anything new. At bottom, it is just another glamorized rendition of a ruthless criminal figure (who maintains a veneer of respectability) who has claimed his piece of the American pie through crime and brutality. Take Goodfellas, throw it into a pot with New Jack City, add a dash of Serpico, and voila; you have American Gangster. Also, the film is apparently only semi-true, as many liberties have been taken with the story.

It was a long wait, but I am glad I did see it. As many others have acknowledged, the acting was superb. Denzel & Russell provide tour-de-force performances, which of course is at its sweetest when they are together in a scene. Denzel gives a beautifully layered performance, showing the charm & attractiveness of the man, but then being able to turn on a dime into a ruthless monster. However, even when he is being ruthless, that is underpinned by the man's own sense of right & wrong, and you can understand why he does what he does, even though you don't agree with it or support it. I was able to empathize with where he came from and his family values, while also seeing his story as an example of how we reap what we sow in life.Josh Brolin was a real plus to this movie, playing a dirty detective. I am amazed at his versatility, and I am delighted to see his career taking off the way it is. This is a quality role and he is perfect in it.American Gangster is an interesting expose on a real-life person, and gives a good feel to the life & times of this person. It didn't grab & awe me the way The Departed did (I still can't get that movie out of my mind, I loved it so much), I think the story wasn't as strong, and it didn't have the heart & heart-pounding action that The Departed did.

1131409,A2C3P362BXV4XM,B0011HOEY4,Raiden777,"[0, 0]","Apparently not.This man is the greatest living hollywood actor that i know of. He puts mind, heart, spirit and soul into his roles, his whole self it seems.With each movie ive seen, he alone makes the movie, even if its not a masterpiece (john Q), he alone, his very performance, is worth the price of admission to get a seat in a packed theater.American Ganster is no exception. A well done inspiring picture that tells the story of a man living outside of the law, who desired to give his family the best, whose strong work ethic took him to the top of his community, and the repercussions he was delt for the choices he made to get there. In short, he was very much his own man. Living above the lawful, and the lawless.I dont pretend to know the real life story of our main character, Frank Lucas, so i cant say if this is the truest most accurate depiction of how things went down, but i do know, that i was given an inspiring performance, with good supporting performances from Russel Crowe and others.As the movie progressed, around every corner , i was worried for Frank, i didnt want the man to get blown away. Thats how involving the film is, and thoughts how much i liked Frank's character. I dont know if id care much for the real man, but if he was anything like how Denzel portrayed him to be, then id be rooting for him.Its crazy, Mr. Washington can take even a criminal , an apparent bad guy, and make us get up and cheer when he gets away, or feel a genuine sense of concern when the characters life seems to be in danger.He became this man, i totally forgot i was watching a movie, thats how good it was.Through all the harassment, the raids, the warrants, the attempts on his life, through all the crooked cops, through all the years, Frank Lucas had composure.Sure, he deserved what he got in the end, but hes no different than most people, trying to do something with themselves, who dont do things exactly like a saint would. But i think, out of all the gangsters ive seen portrayed in films...from Little Cesar to John Gotti, no one seemed as honest nor meant more well, than Frank Lucas.Now i could be very wrong, but this film made me a believer. It moved me. One of the best scenes ive ever seen a gangster film is probubly when Frank is confronted by his mother near the end when things start to fall apart....it was such a painful, emotional and powerful scene, between mother and son. I felt some tears in my eyes as i watched that part.Again, im not sure as to how historically accurate this film is. But based on how it was all done, it kept me coming back for more. Good high intensity moments, very good acting, a memorable story, a character you cant help but care about played by Denzel Washington, and i must note that Russell Crowe, who plays the cop whose in pursuit of Frank Lucas, does a good job in his role as well, although i just couldnt keep my self from wishing he'd fall in a ditch somewhere so that Denzel's character could get away and live happily ever after, but reality kicks in i guess.If you like gangster films , i think this a welcome addition to the old black and white gangster films, to the 70s God Father films , to The Departed Film.  Though American Gangster is nowhere as grand or great as lets say, The Godfather, or as totally unforgettable as lets say, The Goodfellas......American Gangster tells the tale of a unique organised crime boss in Harlem, who wasnt of italian or irish decent, but was of african decent. Here we see a different world within organized crime...its not big guys doing buisness over a plate of pasta...the fellas in American Gangster are getting chinese take out! LOLBut in all seriousness, we see our share of self ran clubs, partys, big family dinners, and the ""good life"" and all that success brings...but its interesting to see it done with a different type of soul.I tell ya, i would of loved to have lived in Frank Lucas's house, and have dinner with that family. Scenes of the times he had with family nearly made us forget he was who he was, you just wanted to see more time with him and his big family, how he took care of everyone, and how much love there was.

It is this poor prioritizing that provides the impetus for their actions.  Crowe's character was somewhat more redeemable than Washingtons' whose character indeed had anger management issues which were all supposedly explained away because of societal pressures - blah, blah, blah...It is also interesting that many of Washington's characterizations don't necessarily warrant much attention unless they are somewhat less than socially redeeming.Notwithstanding, it is indeed a good film with flaws like any other (hardly a masterpiece) but well worth becoming a part of your film collection.

Considering he was a black person from Harlem at a time when there were plenty more powerful gangsters in New York, this 'achievement' makes him a business phenomenon.The movie is a somewhat interesting story on a gangster related topic but does not convey what Frank Lucas was and could have been more accurate towards his life which in reality was extraordinary.Lucas imported drugs inside coffins JUST ONCE whereas the movie portrays it as the usual business model. The point here is that the movie is good as a fictional creation but compared to Lucas and his life it is just an average movie and certainly not in the league of GoodFellas or The Godfather - But it could have been as good if not better.Most people will also not realize that Frank Lucas 'over-dressing' for the boxing match and sitting in seats in front of the Italian Mafia was a huge blunder. This single incident was a miscalculation (due to his wife) and which drew attention to Lucas.

It is a story of a man driven to succeed in the only trade he knew, at any price.  He uses Italian Mafia tactics and employs his immediate family and cousins to help him with distribution.  The genius of his channel distribution is that he has arranged for drug delivery via MP transport between military bases on the US east coast and Vietnam where the war was fought.  As he pushes competition away with his superior products and takes away cut from the middle man that happens to be NYC Special Investigation Unit, he starts building enemies, slowly but surely.  The moral of the story is that this man, Frank Lucas, no matter how ruthless is the picture perfect of the American Dream.  He works hard, he is driven and dermined and has his goal.  He becomes someone that white people have to recon with.  But at the end, his empire is like a house of cards where he takes NYC police department, his family and himself down to the dungeons.  His wealth and success are not saving him from the justice system where he spends 15 years of his life before he can be free again.  Wonderful cast and a great story.

This movie takes place about a decade after the French Connection and in the early storyline they mention that the dope that Egan and Grosso (the real life Popeye and Cloudy of the French Connection) turned in, was being systematically raided and sold by dirty cops.  Yes, this movie illustrates the evolution of the eventual loss of the &#34;war on drugs&#34;.  It also occurs to me that the director Scott pays tribute to Friedkin's Oscar winning film in other ways.  Scott films this in 1:85 aspect ratio like Friedkin instead of the more cinematic and  panoramic 2:35 , he also avoids flash color and achieves a similar realistic look of the time and place.  Scott also spends a great deal of time as Friedkin did on the drudgery of the research and endless surveillance that goes along with a large bust.  He avoids falling into the trap of trying to duplicate the greatest car chase in movie history but has a very tense foot chase...All that said, for me this is a deeply satisfying movie that works so much more than graphic shoot em up movies (which I also like) with incredibly rich character development and two starring performances that are staggeringly good.Run the French Connection, have a nice meal , and then watch this..... for a terrific double header.I'd like to hear from anyone out there what they think the evolution (next film) in this series might be....

He and his partner make a million dollar bust--and anger the whole police department by having the audacity to turn the money in against his partner's advice.  This marks Roberts as a troublemaker.Roberts has his own view of the system: ""Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians. They stop bringing dope into this country, about a hundred thousand people are gonna be out of a job."" It's basically the theory so many people espouse about Government--it's not here to solve problems, but to manage them.  Roberts sees thousands killed everyday from drugs and related violence and wants to stop it. And, he wants to stop police corruption as well.Roberts is not the kind of man who takes the easy way out.  When his former partner is caught in a tenement having shot a drug dealer with an angry mob outside, Roberts goes in alone to help.  His solution to get his partner out alive is ingenious--and keeps you on the edge of your seat.It's inevitable the two men are going to collide.  The film essentially deals with the build-up of Frank's business, Roberts' investigation, and the ending for both men.The supporting cast in ""Gangster"" was strong.  Of particular note are Ruby Dee in a nomination-worthy performance as Mama Lucas and Josh Brolin as Lt. Trupo, a cop so crooked he made the gangsters look good.The research on this film is obvious.  I saw an interview with Denzel Washington talking about the time he spent with Frank Lucas trying to get into character. Even at an advanced age, the original American Gangster was still in charge.Director, Ridley Scott did an amazing job recreating a 30 year old world.  The details from the rotary telephones to the music played are spot on.Warning:  The world ""American Gangster"" depicts isn't often pretty--drug preparation, use, and abuse are shown in graphic detail. There's some nudity and violence; however, the film was not near as vicious as I expected it would be.",5,Well worth full price admission and later purchase of the DVD,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,2993,"['What', 'world', 'order', 'when', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'boss', 'dies', 'Frank', 'up', 'plate', 'take', 'over', 'Harlem', 'Being', 'astute', 'businessman', 'significant', 'problem', 'Local', 'drug', 'dealers', 'are', 'buying', 'heroin', 'Mob', 'then', 'get', 'busted', 'NYPD', 'NYPD', 'dope', 'down', 'enough', 'evidence', 'convict', 'then', 'drugs', 'drug', 'dealers.Frank', 'figures', 'can', 'go', 'Vietnam', 'can', 'get', 'heroin', 'straight', 'fields', 'fly', 'US', 'Army', 'planes', 'can', 'use', 'substantial', 'family', 'act', 'distributors', 'plan', 'action', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'Harlem', 'storm', 'Soon', 'Frank', 'managed', 'do', 'what', 'other', 'Black', 'man', 'could', 'making', 'terms', 'Mafia', 'living', 'American', 'Dream', 'dining', 'stars', 'athletes', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'arm', 'still', 'taking', 'care', 'Harlem', 'too', 'handing', 'out', 'turkeys', 'Thanksgiving', 'old', 'boss', 'did.Meanwhile', 'Det', 'Ritchie', 'Roberts', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'taking', 'law', 'classes', 'beat', 'partner', 'make', 'million', 'dollar', 'bust', 'whole', 'police', 'department', 'having', 'audacity', 'turn', 'money', 'partner', 'advice', 'Roberts', 'troublemaker.Roberts', 'own', 'view', 'system', 'Judges', 'lawyers', 'cops', 'politicians', 'stop', 'bringing', 'dope', 'country', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'people', 'are', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'job', 'basically', 'theory', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'espouse', 'Government', 'not', 'here', 'solve', 'problems', 'manage', 'Roberts', 'sees', 'thousands', 'killed', 'everyday', 'drugs', 'related', 'violence', 'stop', 'stop', 'police', 'corruption', 'well.Roberts', 'not', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'easy', 'way', 'out', 'When', 'former', 'partner', 'caught', 'tenement', 'having', 'shot', 'drug', 'dealer', 'angry', 'mob', 'Roberts', 'alone', 'help', 'solution', 'get', 'partner', 'alive', 'ingenious', 'edge', 'seat.It', 'inevitable', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'going', 'collide', 'film', 'essentially', 'build-up', 'Frank', 'business', 'Roberts', 'investigation', 'ending', 'men.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Gangster', 'was', 'strong', 'particular', 'note', 'are', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'nomination-worthy', 'performance', 'Mama', 'Lucas', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Lt.', 'Trupo', 'cop', 'so', 'crooked', 'made', 'gangsters', 'look', 'good.The', 'research', 'film', 'obvious', 'saw', 'interview', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'talking', 'time', 'spent', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'trying', 'get', 'character', 'Even', 'advanced', 'age', 'original', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'still', 'charge.Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'recreating', '30', 'year', 'old', 'world', 'details', 'rotary', 'telephones', 'music', 'played', 'are', 'spot', 'on.Warning', 'world', 'American', 'Gangster', 'depicts', ""n't"", 'often', 'pretty', 'drug', 'preparation', 'use', 'abuse', 'are', 'shown', 'graphic', 'detail', 'nudity', 'violence', 'however', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'vicious', 'expected', 'would', 'be']",American Gangster
1131421,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0011HOEY4,RMurray847,"[2, 3]","This is a fascinating, interesting story.  Telling the tale of Frank Lucas, the black ""businessman"", whose business was to run the Heroin trade through Harlem and much of the NYC area in the early '70s was a fine idea.  The study of his approach to his business (avoiding flashy clothing to escape notice, a genteel attitude, surrounding himself with family) feels very specific and authentic.  His occasional bursts of brutal violence and temper are all the more shocking because of his normally placid demeanor.Juxtapose that story with that of the cop who finally brought him to justice, and you've got a juicy story.The film is exceedingly well crafted.  It feels like NYC of another era, before it was cleaned up.  You can practically smell the smoke and uncollected trash.  Director Ridley Scott brings a great attention to detail, and he never overplays his hand.  He's not always been the best at showing restraint...but here he knows that carefully layering this story and bringing the two threads closer and closer together is the right approach.Scott has also cast his movie very well.  Lots of familiar faces in smallish roles, including Chiwetal Ejiofor as Frank's brother, Ted Levine as the police captain, Cuba Gooding Jr. as a rival drug dealer and Rudy Dee as Lucas' mother.  But the central focus is on the two lead performances:  Russell Crowe as the honest cop and Denzel Washington as the suave crime lord.  Crowe is dirty, disheveled, sweaty and apparently a pretty bad husband and father.  He's also very honest.  Washington is clean-cut, intelligent, charming and a psychopath.Crowe is one of those actors who immerses himself into each role.  I think back on how different he was in THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR and A BEAUTIFUL MIND (three Oscar nominations in a row).  Each character looked different, felt different.  Crowe carries himself differently no matter who he is playing.  In AMERICAN GANGSTER, he's aware of his faults, yet clings stubbornly to the idea that he's doing the right thing.  Not out of nobility, but really because that's the only truly good quality he has left...an uncompromised approach to his work.  While it isn't his greatest acting achievement...it is solid work indeed.Washington has long brought the exact same suaveness, quick smile, even quicker frown to his work.  He oozes charisma, and he brings it on big-time in his role here.  He needs it, because we must care to some degree about this horrific man.  But I'm not seeing anything Washington hasn't done about 100 times before.  He hasn't really stretched his acting chops in a long time.  The role is more outsized that usual perhaps...but his portrayal is, frankly, a little predictable.The whole movie is just a smide predictable.  It feels like a really well executed episode of ""Law and Order"" for much of it.  I'm so tired of the cliched bulletin board with push-pinned photos of all the bad guys hanging from it.  Seems like every cop movie or TV show made these days has a version of this.  How often can we see a montage of the cops standing around and rearranging these photos as a way of indicating that their investigation is progressing.For every lazy scene like that, the film does have one or two inventive ones.  All the scenes that feature the corrupt cops (led by Josh Brolin) crackle with violence that almost but never quite reaches the surface.In the end, as the story began to wrap up, I realized that while I was content to see how everything played out...I didn't really CARE all that much.  After investing nearly 2.5 hours, I should have been much more tense or excited.  But I was merely interested.  Not much passion there.So while there is much to admire, and I certainly do recommend it for an adult audience...this movie is not quite the classic it aspires to be.",4,Well crafted but a little cold.,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,3804,"['fascinating', 'interesting', 'story', 'Telling', 'tale', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'black', 'businessman', 'business', 'was', 'run', 'Heroin', 'trade', 'Harlem', 'much', 'NYC', 'area', 'early', ""'70s"", 'was', 'fine', 'idea', 'study', 'approach', 'business', 'avoiding', 'flashy', 'clothing', 'escape', 'notice', 'genteel', 'attitude', 'surrounding', 'family', 'feels', 'very', 'specific', 'authentic', 'occasional', 'bursts', 'brutal', 'violence', 'temper', 'are', 'more', 'shocking', 'normally', 'placid', 'demeanor.Juxtapose', 'story', 'cop', 'who', 'finally', 'brought', 'justice', ""'ve"", 'got', 'juicy', 'story.The', 'film', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'crafted', 'NYC', 'era', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'can', 'practically', 'smell', 'smoke', 'uncollected', 'trash', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'never', 'hand', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'best', 'showing', 'restraint', 'here', 'carefully', 'layering', 'story', 'bringing', 'two', 'threads', 'closer', 'closer', 'together', 'right', 'approach.Scott', 'also', 'cast', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'Lots', 'familiar', 'smallish', 'roles', 'including', 'Chiwetal', 'Ejiofor', 'Frank', 'brother', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'police', 'captain', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'rival', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Rudy', 'Dee', 'Lucas', 'mother', 'central', 'focus', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'honest', 'cop', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'suave', 'crime', 'lord', 'Crowe', 'dirty', 'disheveled', 'sweaty', 'apparently', 'pretty', 'bad', 'husband', 'father', 'also', 'very', 'honest', 'Washington', 'clean-cut', 'intelligent', 'charming', 'psychopath.Crowe', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'role', 'think', 'back', 'how', 'different', 'was', 'THE', 'INSIDER', 'GLADIATOR', 'A', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'three', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'row', 'character', 'looked', 'different', 'felt', 'different', 'Crowe', 'differently', 'matter', 'who', 'playing', 'AMERICAN', 'GANGSTER', 'aware', 'faults', 'yet', 'stubbornly', 'idea', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Not', 'nobility', 'really', 'only', 'truly', 'good', 'quality', 'left', 'uncompromised', 'approach', 'work', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'acting', 'achievement', 'solid', 'work', 'indeed.Washington', 'long', 'brought', 'exact', 'same', 'suaveness', 'quick', 'smile', 'even', 'quicker', 'frown', 'work', 'charisma', 'big-time', 'role', 'here', 'must', 'care', 'degree', 'horrific', 'man', ""'m"", 'not', 'seeing', 'anything', 'Washington', ""n't"", 'done', 'about', '100', 'times', 'before', ""n't"", 'really', 'stretched', 'acting', 'chops', 'long', 'time', 'role', 'more', 'outsized', 'usual', 'perhaps', 'portrayal', 'frankly', 'little', 'predictable.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'smide', 'predictable', 'really', 'well', 'executed', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'much', ""'m"", 'so', 'tired', 'cliched', 'bulletin', 'board', 'push-pinned', 'photos', 'bad', 'guys', 'hanging', 'cop', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'made', 'days', 'version', 'How', 'often', 'can', 'see', 'montage', 'cops', 'standing', 'around', 'rearranging', 'photos', 'way', 'indicating', 'investigation', 'progressing.For', 'lazy', 'scene', 'film', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'inventive', 'ones', 'scenes', 'feature', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'led', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'crackle', 'violence', 'almost', 'never', 'quite', 'surface.In', 'end', 'story', 'began', 'wrap', 'up', 'realized', 'was', 'content', 'see', 'how', 'everything', 'played', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'CARE', 'much', 'investing', 'nearly', '2.5', 'hours', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'tense', 'excited', 'was', 'merely', 'interested', 'Not', 'much', 'passion', 'there.So', 'much', 'admire', 'certainly', 'do', 'recommend', 'adult', 'audience', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'classic', 'be']",American Gangster

To be sure, the story is pretty run-of-the-mill:  after a long apprenticeship with a Harlem manipulator, a young hustler figures out a new way to get pure heroin into the country.  He then runs it like a business, establishing a superior brand and building an empire.  Meanwhile, a cop focuses on him, and you can guess the rest.What made this a fabulous experience was the acting:  Washington is second to none in his ability to project an entire environment and background into every gesture.  Crowe is also superb as an honest, though troubled cop, who gets extraordinary powers to build a team and pursue him.  In between, you get a vivid (and thankfully not too detailed) picture of the times, from the Vietnam War to the changing role of blacks in US society.

1131424,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,B0011HOEY4,Rocco Dormarunno,"[0, 0]","For the longest time, it has been argued that ""The Godfather"" (from the book and movie of the same title) is not about Vito Corleone but about Michael Corleone because it is about his ascent/descent into the underworld. And, at the very end, he is the godfather to Connie's son while his rivals are being executed. In the same respect, I had to wonder about who the real gangster is here: Frank Lucas (Washington) or Special Detective Truppo (Brolin). While we do watch Lucas' burgeoning success as a drug dealer, it is Truppo who acts with the viciousness of a gangster. He and his flock of black-jacketed, vulture-like crooked cops are more terrifying and brazen than Lucas. Lucas acts with compassion at times--even while burning an enemy alive in the opening sequence, he mercifully blasts him away before the flames can prolong his agony. In fact, any time he resorts to violence seems forced. Truppo has no compunction about saying things like ""Maybe next time I throw you and your brother in the river."" In fact Truppo is a nemesis to both Lucas and Officer Roberts (Crowe). His malevolence is everywhere.Then, like ""The French Connection"" it is about the complex world of drug-trafficking and the frustrations of law enforcement to understand it--especially in the wild and wooly days of the late-60s to late-70s. Crowe does an exceptional job of expressing this frustration and confusion (he cannot believe that a Black man could do what the Italian Mafia could not--monopolize the drug trade in all five boroughs and then the outer counties, including New Jersey). To make matters worse, Roberts has to contend with the corruption in his own department.All this makes for a dark but engrossing film that leaves you impressed with director Scott's ability to recreate a world that has vanished a few decades ago, at least in appearance.So why not a perfect score? Two things: First, the prolonged scenes concerning Roberts' divorce are way too distracting. While I love looking at Carla Gugino, her thankless role in thankless scenes detract from the film's pacing. Second, the second disc--with its self-congratulatory nods to the costume designers, set designers, fried egg designers--really aren't worth watching. The only thing on that disc worth watching is the discussion between the real Frank Lucas and the real Richie Roberts. And even that discussion is marginally interesting.

1131426,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0011HOEY4,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","****1/2In what is possibly the best gangster picture since ""Goodfellas,"" Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a real life drug lord who reigned over Harlem from the late 1960's to the early 1970's.  Lucas rose to prominence when he began buying his supplies directly from a military connection in war torn Vietnam, allowing him to push a ""purer"" product at a cheaper price than any of his mob competitors.  Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an ""honest cop"" from New Jersey who leads an undercover investigation into the source of all this suddenly abundant street heroin, a search that ultimately leads him to Lucas himself.As written by Steven Zaillian (derived from an article by Marc Jacobson) and directed by Ridley Scott - two old pros who certainly know how to craft a quality movie - ""American Gangster"" is an epic tale of crime and punishment  that pays due homage to all the classic gangster pictures that have come before it.  Americans have always had a love/hate relationship with law breakers and gangsters.  Although we may be appalled by their callous indifference to the suffering of others, we can't help but admire their steely-eyed determination and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as their ability to turn the American Dream on its head with impunity (until they`re finally caught that is).  And Lucas is no exception, for here is the classic figure of gangster mythology - a boy from the streets who rises from obscurity to command his own empire, only to have it crumble before his very eyes when his own hubris and overreaching prove too much even for the gods themselves to countenance. In a strange moral paradox, much as we may like to see gangsters succeed, we also like to see them brought low and given their just desserts - if for no more morally admirable reason that that we envy them.  Lucas comes replete with that special cognitive dissonance that all gangsters seem to possess, and which allows them to live two entirely separate and compartmentalized lives, free of the guilt and hypocrisy that keep the rest of us duty-bound and law-abiding.  For despite his ferocious temperament, indifference to human suffering, and callow willingness to exploit human tragedy for his own personal gain, Lucas protects his neighborhood, dotes on his mother and family, and loves his wife.Ironically, Roberts, the cop, has less worth celebrating in his own life - his wife is divorcing him and moving with their son to Las Vegas, his fellow cops don't trust him (for the reason that he ISN'T on the take), and his hopes of becoming a defense attorney may come to naught if he can`t conquer his paralyzing fear of public speaking.  Yet, Roberts has one thing going for him that Lucas doesn't - he knows the difference between right and wrong, even though he doesn't always act on that knowledge when it comes to his own personal (as opposed to professional) life.Yet what truly distinguishes ""American Gangster"" from its recent movie counterparts - more even than the storyline or characterizations - is the tremendous amount of texture Zaillian and Scott bring to the picture.  Every scene is filled with intense interactions between characters, intriguing background information (especially the TV reports from Vietnam), and spot-on period details.  And even though Washington and Crowe appear together only in the closing moments, their powerhouse performances make the two concurrently running stories feel all of a piece.  It should also be noted that, for a gangster picture, ""American Gangster"" doesn't feel the need to wallow in excessive violence or gratuitous sadism.  It is much more concerned with the people involved than with their on-the-job activities.As with even the best of movies these days, ""American Gangster"" could use a little trimming in its later stages, where it suffers a bit from distention and attenuation.

Comparing them is really an education. Especially with one star actor and two directors in different years.GANGSTER is directed by Ridley Scott. Daniel Espinos directed SAFE HOUSE. See GANGSTER's 2-stars? HOUSE, my rating's 5+. See one right after the other and see if you agree. I saw Denzel shine in one, not the other. Story, plot, director, player's persona.Why a 3-star difference? Movies have evolved for one thing, while audiences have too,learning from good films, becoming more sophisticated, educated discriminating and critical from and about movies. Welcome Third Millennium. H'mmm,I just excluded exploitative mayhem movies.Compare GANGSTER's direction and editing: Long stagy scenes, mostly dialogue, with frequent static camera shots. Long scenes (5-10 minutes+) one after another filling almost the whole movie. Predominantly talk suborning action. Contemporary films have many 5-10 second cuts. Visuals/actions lead words not visa-versa. Note more visual SAFE HOUSE action-led direction. Which is better? It's a subjective call, but movies (music and other creative products create new tastes don't they? Time/experience changes anything/everything in everybody.) Now faster and faster.Key too is writing quality; GANGSTER is trite, cliched, mostly predictable, familiar and so flat-footed. See one scene, you'll expect what the next one will be. No twists, zzzzz...HOUSE is fast, surprising,unorthodox, exciting while engaging on every level; with more levels, more drama, more attention to exposing motivations. With no cliches, less racial/ social stereotypes. Like, more surprises - which equals more excitementRemember pundit Marshall McCluhan's 'Cool vs. Hot communication? Cool:Let audiences fill in blanks, allow them participate, translate scenes. So now they feel more, relate to the film's story, characters. It's a kick to catch on without being told something, yes?Why did GANGSTER age so fast? Methinks Hollywood Studio execs have so many preconceptions. For a wrenching example, suffer through Depp's THE LONE RANGER (wait abit to buy it if youdo;10-cents will be offered soon in Amazon marketplace... Well, maybe.So I'm not just pointing a finger at Scott. His KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, with international inputs not Hollywood studio dicta is brilliantKingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut (Four-Disc Special Edition)Dated, traditional thinking drives too many American movies, just like Hollywood society politics run the Oscars; stunting. which is why Asian and Euro films are rising above American movie products for the first time In quality and boxoffice.

Bumpy laments the loss of the middleman in business, the jobs lost to overseas companies, the end of the era of the working man.  When Bumpy dies and Frank takes over, he omits the middleman too and purchases his heroin directly from Bangkok and ships it via military aircraft through Vietnam to the US.  Frank is on his way up, and he doesn't let anyone stand in his way, even those who think now that Bumpy is dead, so is his business.Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an honest cop who's taking night classes to become a lawyer.  He's well aware of how corrupt the Drug Enforcement Division is, the police taking busted dope from evidence, cutting it, and reselling it on the streets.  Richie and his partner find $1M in the trunk of a dealer's car, and against his partner's warning they turn in the money.  Now they can't get backup and the other cops won't work with them because they can't trust honest cops.While Frank represents The American Dream (even if it's the wrong dream) by being a gentleman, a good family man who loves his mother, his wife, and America, Richie the honest cop is a failure at his marriage, a womanizer, and a absent father to his son.Frank's on top of the world, until an innocent gift from his wife begins his decline.  Always counseling his brothers not to dress flashy and attract attention, he makes the mistake of wearing the showy, fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and hat his wife gave him to a boxing match.  Sitting in better seats than the Italians, shaking hands with Joe Lewis, and standing out like a sore thumb, he catches the attention of Richie, who's heading a task force to nail all the big time drug players.  The cops are onto Frank now, both the good ones and the bad ones.  Frank is exposed, and his world is about to change.Though based on a true story, I've never heard of the case so I can't comment on how close to reality the film came.  The movie starts slow, and is kind of hard to get into.  Keep watching, the movie comes together and the pace quickens.  It's a movie where you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy even though you shouldn't, because Frank seems like such a nice guy (except when he's shooting people).  It's also a movie you'll want to view again, to catch all the nuances in the relationships.  On a personal note, I liked all the old cars they found to use in the movie, not one car was outside the time frame.

There are a number of parts I liked, but on the whole, something just doesn't gel, or perhaps it's too obviously a mish mash of other gangster movies.  Crowe seems like he's overacting (a lot).  It may be his worst performance yet. I'm starting to think this dude takes himself way too seriously. I think I saw somewhere that he dissed DeNiro. (Crowe, you need to sit down with Bobby D movies and see how it was done. He's not the same Bobby D these days, but back in his day he could run method acting circles around you.) And Washington seems like he's sleepwalking through the role (a first for him). Compare this performance with his performance in Training Day.  True, different characters, but it's also a question of a scipt realizing the character. An actor can only do so much. American Gangster does not.  Why? Well, for one, it's boring.

1131438,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0011HOEY4,Sky,"[4, 5]","American Gangster arrived on my doorstep back at the very beginning of March. So here I am approximately 3 months later finally writing my silly little review about it. Why? Why did it take me 3 months to get to a movie that was by some so highly praised?Why did I view movies likeRambowhich was good,Cloverfieldwhich was good, andAliens vs. Predator - Requiemwhich was bad the day they arrived at my house from Amazon, only to wait 90 days to watch American Gangster? NO, not because I'm adolescent minded! It's the time....Almost 3 hours for the Unrated/Extended Edition of American Gangster required some time-dedication.Look, Ridley Scott is a great director, but sometimes I think Hollywood can get a little self-indulgent with the time they take to tell a story. I mean too many movies these days are well over 2 hours. There better be something really compelling to get people to sit for 3 hours, and as I suspected, Amercan Gangster was good, but it didn't need to be 3 hours long.The story in American Gangster was simple enough: it depicted the life a Frank Lucas played by the always fun to watch Denzel Washington from his rise to power to his inevitable fall. And I say ""depicted"" as opposed to ""documented"" because there are disputes as to whether Lucas was actually ""the boss"" of the Blue Magic empire or if it was really Zach Walker (according to gangster Bumpy Johnson's widow) or if it was really gangster Nicky Barnes (according to some NY area Bronx locals). Walker didn't even get a mention in American Gangster and Barnes (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) had only a brief appearance.The action in American Gangster was few and far between, but the story was very well told. However, most of the movie was forgettable. I already remember less about American Gangster than I do about Rambo or Cloverfield. As for Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem?....Let's just say that it would be nice if Ridley Scott got back into the Alien franchise and revived what the last two Alien/Predator directors killed.",3,Riddled With Length by Scott,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2012,"['American', 'Gangster', 'arrived', 'doorstep', 'back', 'very', 'beginning', 'March', 'So', 'here', 'am', 'approximately', '3', 'months', 'later', 'finally', 'writing', 'silly', 'little', 'review', 'Why', 'Why', 'did', 'take', '3', 'months', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'highly', 'praised', 'Why', 'did', 'view', 'movies', 'likeRambowhich', 'was', 'good', 'Cloverfieldwhich', 'was', 'good', 'vs', 'Predator', 'Requiemwhich', 'was', 'bad', 'day', 'arrived', 'house', 'Amazon', 'only', 'wait', '90', 'days', 'watch', 'American', 'Gangster', 'NO', 'not', ""'m"", 'adolescent', 'minded', 'time', '.Almost', '3', 'hours', 'Unrated/Extended', 'Edition', 'American', 'Gangster', 'required', 'time-dedication.Look', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'great', 'director', 'sometimes', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'self-indulgent', 'time', 'take', 'tell', 'story', 'mean', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'are', 'well', '2', 'hours', 'better', 'be', 'something', 'really', 'compelling', 'get', 'people', 'sit', '3', 'hours', 'suspected', 'Amercan', 'Gangster', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', '3', 'hours', 'long.The', 'story', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'simple', 'enough', 'depicted', 'life', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'played', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'rise', 'power', 'inevitable', 'fall', 'say', 'depicted', 'opposed', 'documented', 'are', 'disputes', 'Lucas', 'was', 'actually', 'boss', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'empire', 'was', 'really', 'Zach', 'Walker', 'according', 'gangster', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'widow', 'was', 'really', 'gangster', 'Nicky', 'Barnes', 'according', 'NY', 'area', 'Bronx', 'locals', 'Walker', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'mention', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Barnes', 'played', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'had', 'only', 'brief', 'appearance.The', 'action', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'few', 'far', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'However', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'forgettable', 'already', 'remember', 'less', 'American', 'Gangster', 'do', 'Rambo', 'Cloverfield', 'Aliens', 'vs', 'Predator', 'Requiem', 'just', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'got', 'back', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'revived', 'what', 'last', 'two', 'Alien/Predator', 'directors', 'killed']",American Gangster
1131439,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,B0011HOEY4,Some Gravity,"[0, 1]","""American Gangster"" tells the true story of Frank Lucas(portrayed by Denzel Washington),a Harlem drug kingpin who,in 1968,began a drug operation of Southeastern Asia heroin--that pertained to the Vietnam War. The operation and what came out of it,as well as the life that Frank Lucas lived at the time and what the New Jersey and New York City police had to do,alongside the efforts of detective Ritchie Roberts(portrayed by Russell Crowe)that were made during an unmerciful period in Roberts' life,are all documented by ""American Gangster"".There are several ways in which ""American Gangster"" could have been done. The way that was chosen? Telling the true story behind ""American Gangster"" in order by year,but twisting the events around. While this is a risky theory,it works pretty well. It is a theory that tells viewers the story they have come for--but makes them think and put pieces of the puzzle together while acquiring the film's information. While ""American Gangster"" would have had more life to it and stood out more if it had been directed by Oliver Stone(it is closer to the films and style of Stone than it is to the films and style of Ridley Scott),Ridley Scott's style of direction on ""American Gangster"" still works well. This is by Ridley Scott allowing ""American Gangster"" to balance out the drug operation depicted by the movie and the documentation of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts' personal lives to not overlap,the operation depiction being suspenseful and a thorough and entertaining portrait of New York City in the 60's and 70's being painted.

A nice departure from usual organized crime films about italian families or the modern day rap star gang bangers. Denzel Washington is a fabulous actor. He consumes the leading role of Frank Lucas, a man from Carolina that is tutored under a crime boss in Harlem for 15 years. After his mentor passes away, he fights to maintain the ""kingdom"" that was established. He revolutionizes the way that his ""type"" of business is conducted. Being a true story, I'm glad they didn't only glamourize the gangster lifestyle. They show the way that the drug trade affects the everyday people, including showing junkies passed out on filthy floors while Frank and his family eat Thanksgiving dinner.

I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I do have the Standard Def 2 disc version but this is not a side by side comparison.At first, when I looked at the Blu Ray cover, I got worried as I , initially, didn't see where it listed it as having both the theatrical and extended versions.  Oops, did I make an error in my purchase?  Nope, the Blu Ray does contain both versions and I watched only the extended version for which this review is based upon.VIDEO...The transfer is very clean with no artifacting or disturbing grain.  The standard def DVD was also pretty darn good so I doubt if this is a remaster but it is an upgrade never the less with greater contrast.  There was no stair stepping in any scene as you might expect from the wide angle shots of traffic and trains.  The colors are fairly desaturated and muted so there nothing that will pop out at you video-wise.  Just expect a beautiful transfer appropriate to what the director was looking for.  The muted colors matched the often bleak landscape of the Bronx.  I was born there and remember it well.  Mbps rate averages in the low 20's but, never the less, the video is as clean a transfer as it needs to be.AUDEO...In many ways, the audio is the star of the Blu Ray presentation.  The disc defaults to a lossless DTS HD 5.1 and the sound editors were given full liberty, I assume, to do a masterful job of audio steering.  There are a great many pans between the front and rear sound stages when appropriate as well as a plentiful and enveloping soundscape throughout the film.  The directional use of the rear and front side speakers come in to use very often as needed and this discreet channeling of audio really made the film come alive for me.  That the audio is lossless only makes for more transparent and realistic sound as it does here.  It can be easy to lose awareness of the full home theater's use but I am always conscious of well done audio as The American Gangster on Blu Ray does.Extras...A couple of deleted scenes, an alternate opening and pretty much all the extras found on the original Standard Def release.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions.

It reminded me of the movie Blow and also of the classic mob movie Casino.  As is the fashion these days, the movie tries to pack way too much into 2 1/2 hours.

1131448,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0011HOEY4,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[84, 110]","we've been here many times before.  This film offers nothing new to the genre, but it is still a terrific film.Ridley Scott is an already proven director who is well overdue for an Oscar, but just what attracted him to this story is something of a mystery.  Perhaps being a diverse director with films like the firstAlienandGladiatorhe wanted to add another genre to his credits and that is admirable (more admirable than Martin Scorsese who keeps making the same film over and over again and then wonders where the Oscar is).  However, Scott could have selected a gangster film that didn't include so many tributes to better films in the genre (The Godfather,The UntouchablesandSerpicocome to mind).  In this regard the film disappoints even though Scott directs his great cast in both subtle and stylized fashion.  He deserves kudos for his efforts if not for the end result.Speaking of the cast, it is hard to criticize Crowe and Washington, however, their roles are not very original and Crowe, while good, pales in comparison to the ever-charismatic Washington who is simply playing a variation of his Oscar-winning character inTraining Day.  Crowe is simply playing a more subdued version of Al Pacino'sSerpicorole of the honest, but conflicted cop up against criminal elements both within the police force and outside of it and it takes its toll on his personal life.  I know much has also been made about Cuba Goodling's cameo role in this film, but there is seriously nothing great here.  It's a whole lot of news about nothing really.  I do not see Oscar nods for anyone in this film as solid as they are; they just never reach that level of excellence.  In fact, I don't see Oscars for this film at all as the plot and characters are too familiar, the film needed editing/trimming, the photography is too often murky (even out of focus at times), and the music was often monotonous or just plain forgettable.Okay, Steve, then why give four stars to a film in which I have so many negative things to say?  Well, as I've said this before in other reviews, just because a film has some significant flaws doesn't mean it isn't entertaining.  I greatly enjoyed this film.  Washington, while not giving an Oscar-caliber performance this time around, is always compelling to watch.  Crowe is sympathetic and believable as the cop out to bring down Washington.  In addition, he story does have its clever moments and plot twists and just as Brian DePalma wisely had few scenes in hisThe Untouchableswherein Eliot Ness (Costner) and Al Capone (DeNiro) actually face off, this film follows in that same vein.  Washington and Crowe share very little screen time and in this kind of story that approached worked for which the writers and the director deserve praise.  Lastly, while Ridley Scott does nothing boldly new with his entry into this genre, he is a top-notch director who is only a little off his game with this film.I don't think many will be disappointed with this film if they go into it with lower expectations.  I enjoyed it very much and look forward to purchasing it when it's released on DVD.  It has good repeat value and I hope the DVD has extras that include background on the true story on which it is loosely based.Warning:  As a parent of a 15  year old and an 11 year old, I'm careful about what my kids view, but I have been known to let them see some R rated films on rare occasions, but only at home where we can talk about what we are viewing.  I've recently started seeing some R films with just my son as he is extremely mature and is obviously growing up and out of many PG and PG-13 kind of films.  His first really ""mature"" film was the recent Michael Clayton with George Clooney and he loved that.  It's mature in that its both R rated for language and adult content, and is story/character-driven and not propelled by mindless violence and sexuality.  This film, American Gangster, was his second mature film.  He is a huge Denzel fan and he loves mobster films, so this was a ""must-see"" for him.  While there is no nudity in the brief sex scene in this film, there is considerable nudity as Denzel's character has nude girls make his drug packages.  They are nude so that they can't hide any drugs on them.  The scenes lack any sexuality to them, but it is nudity just the same (and there is quite a bit of it).  As a parent of a middle teen, I was okay with it and my son handled these scenes maturely, but I thought it fair to mention this to other parents who may be in the same boat as myself raising maturing teenagers.With Respect,Steve",4,"Excellently acted and directed, but . . .",1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,4578,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'here', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'genre', 'still', 'terrific', 'film.Ridley', 'Scott', 'already', 'proven', 'director', 'who', 'well', 'overdue', 'Oscar', 'just', 'what', 'attracted', 'story', 'something', 'mystery', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'diverse', 'director', 'films', 'firstAlienandGladiatorhe', 'wanted', 'add', 'genre', 'credits', 'admirable', 'more', 'admirable', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'who', 'making', 'same', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'then', 'wonders', 'where', 'Oscar', 'However', 'Scott', 'could', 'have', 'selected', 'gangster', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'so', 'many', 'tributes', 'better', 'films', 'genre', 'Godfather', 'UntouchablesandSerpicocome', 'mind', 'regard', 'film', 'disappoints', 'even', 'Scott', 'great', 'cast', 'subtle', 'stylized', 'fashion', 'kudos', 'efforts', 'not', 'end', 'result.Speaking', 'cast', 'hard', 'criticize', 'Crowe', 'Washington', 'however', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'Crowe', 'good', 'pales', 'comparison', 'ever-charismatic', 'Washington', 'who', 'simply', 'playing', 'variation', 'Oscar-winning', 'character', 'inTraining', 'Day', 'Crowe', 'simply', 'playing', 'more', 'subdued', 'version', 'Al', ""Pacino'sSerpicorole"", 'honest', 'conflicted', 'cop', 'up', 'criminal', 'elements', 'police', 'force', 'toll', 'personal', 'life', 'know', 'much', 'also', 'been', 'made', 'Cuba', 'Goodling', 'cameo', 'role', 'film', 'seriously', 'nothing', 'great', 'here', 'whole', 'lot', 'news', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'anyone', 'film', 'as', 'solid', 'are', 'just', 'never', 'reach', 'level', 'excellence', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Oscars', 'film', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'film', 'needed', 'editing/trimming', 'photography', 'too', 'often', 'murky', 'even', 'focus', 'times', 'music', 'was', 'often', 'monotonous', 'just', 'plain', 'forgettable.Okay', 'Steve', 'then', 'why', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'film', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'things', 'say', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'said', 'before', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'film', 'significant', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Washington', 'not', 'giving', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'time', 'always', 'compelling', 'watch', 'Crowe', 'sympathetic', 'believable', 'cop', 'bring', 'down', 'Washington', 'addition', 'story', 'have', 'clever', 'moments', 'plot', 'twists', 'just', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'wisely', 'had', 'few', 'scenes', 'hisThe', 'Untouchableswherein', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'Costner', 'Al', 'Capone', 'DeNiro', 'actually', 'face', 'off', 'film', 'same', 'vein', 'Washington', 'Crowe', 'share', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'kind', 'story', 'approached', 'worked', 'writers', 'director', 'deserve', 'praise', 'Lastly', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'nothing', 'boldly', 'new', 'entry', 'genre', 'top-notch', 'director', 'who', 'only', 'little', 'off', 'game', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'go', 'lower', 'expectations', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'look', 'forward', 'purchasing', 'when', 'released', 'DVD', 'good', 'repeat', 'value', 'hope', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'background', 'true', 'story', 'loosely', 'based.Warning', 'parent', '15', 'year', 'old', '11', 'year', 'old', ""'m"", 'careful', 'what', 'kids', 'view', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'let', 'see', 'R', 'rated', 'films', 'rare', 'occasions', 'only', 'home', 'where', 'can', 'talk', 'what', 'are', 'viewing', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'started', 'seeing', 'R', 'films', 'just', 'son', 'extremely', 'mature', 'obviously', 'growing', 'up', 'many', 'PG', 'PG-13', 'kind', 'films', 'first', 'really', 'mature', 'film', 'was', 'recent', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'George', 'Clooney', 'loved', 'mature', 'R', 'rated', 'language', 'adult', 'content', 'story/character-driven', 'not', 'propelled', 'mindless', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'film', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'second', 'mature', 'film', 'huge', 'Denzel', 'fan', 'mobster', 'films', 'was', 'must-see', 'nudity', 'brief', 'sex', 'scene', 'film', 'considerable', 'nudity', 'Denzel', 'character', 'nude', 'girls', 'make', 'drug', 'packages', 'are', 'nude', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'drugs', 'scenes', 'lack', 'sexuality', 'nudity', 'just', 'same', 'quite', 'bit', 'parent', 'middle', 'teen', 'was', 'okay', 'son', 'handled', 'scenes', 'maturely', 'thought', 'mention', 'other', 'parents', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'boat', 'raising', 'maturing', 'teenagers.With', 'Respect', 'Steve']",American Gangster

1131454,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B0011HOEY4,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[0, 0]","It is a generally accepted fact that organized crime has been and always will be an amazingly lucrative and profit driven enterprise that seeks new and innovative ways to do just one thing: impact positively the bottom line. The money that is garnered through different organized crime ventures whether they be of an illegal gambling nature or a drug trafficking nature is really the main reason as to why in fact in some ways crime does indeed pay.Though it is a sad commentary on not just our current society but rather upon human civilization, crime has always been focused more on making as much money as possible and by whatever means might be necessary to get there. New York City in the 1970's was really no different.Directed by Ridley Scott, American Gangster tells the story of a true life drug kingpin by the name of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). Though Lucas might not seem to necessarily fit the mold of what we would traditionally think a drug dealer to be, what Lucas has done is create an entire drug enterprise for which he predominantly serves in a sort of CEO position of the drug trade.When Lucas' mentor Bumpy Johnson passes away, Lucas is given the keys to the streets of Harlem and is on his way to serving as a man of the people to the junkies and casual users alike. He quickly makes it known that he is now the man in charge on the streets of Harlem and that his goods are the products that will be sold to the people of his streets.""I got Harlem, I took care of Harlem so Harlem's gonna take care of me,"" stated Frank Lucas showing that he knew that his support amongst those around him was exponentially stronger than anyone might initially imagine. The fear and esteem that Lucas was able to instill in those around him simultaneously is what truly helped Lucas strive.Like any good businessman, Lucas needs to ensure that he provides for his customer base a product that is worthy of repeating business with him thereby building a committed group of customers that yearn solely for his product. Lucas reaches out to Vietnam and becomes an importer of Blue Magic, a heroin that is basically about as pure as it can get. The Blue Magic takes the addicts of Harlem by the throat and quickly Lucas' product becomes the talk of the town and the drug of choice.However, when crime begins to spiral out of control you can rest assured that the police and powers that be are not far behind. However, due to rampant conspiracies and episodes of police being on the take, the larger population of police in the NYPD drug units seem to not concern themselves much with what is taking place in Harlem.When Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is assigned to spearhead a federal taskforce on the drugs in the Harlem area, Roberts takes his assignment far more serious than some of his previous counterparts. Roberts, who is attending night school to become an attorney, makes it his passion to hunt down those that are poisoning and killing so many people in the Harlem area. Though they knew who the everyday small players were involved in the operation, no one knew the magnitude to which Lucas played a role in the drug trade mainly because he flew under the radar.The film documents the entire tracking down of Lucas and the subsequent court proceedings that both he and Roberts were a part of. The film serves as a good cop gets bad guy kind of movie and there are decent action scenes throughout the film that help serve as an added bonus to the film.What American Gangster was able to do is show the viewers the amount of calculation and precision that went into the 1970's drug market in Harlem. Often times we are quick to imagine the strung out junkie on the corner passing a bag in exchange for ten dollars to another junkie but we do not think of the larger, more businesslike approach that people like Lucas bring to the entire drug culture.Overall, American Gangster was a very well done film with two excellent actors portraying each of their roles in an accurate and precise way. The story behind the film is an interesting yet not utterly unique story but the way in which the actual facts were translated into this film was done so in a very professional and well thought out way.",4,Will Harlem in fact take care of you?,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,4222,"['generally', 'accepted', 'fact', 'organized', 'crime', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'amazingly', 'lucrative', 'profit', 'driven', 'enterprise', 'new', 'innovative', 'ways', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'impact', 'positively', 'bottom', 'line', 'money', 'garnered', 'different', 'organized', 'crime', 'ventures', 'be', 'illegal', 'gambling', 'nature', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'nature', 'really', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'fact', 'ways', 'crime', 'indeed', 'sad', 'commentary', 'not', 'just', 'current', 'society', 'rather', 'human', 'civilization', 'crime', 'always', 'been', 'focused', 'more', 'making', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'possible', 'means', 'might', 'be', 'necessary', 'get', 'there', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1970', 'was', 'really', 'no', 'different.Directed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'American', 'Gangster', 'story', 'true', 'life', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'name', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Lucas', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'necessarily', 'fit', 'mold', 'what', 'would', 'traditionally', 'think', 'drug', 'dealer', 'be', 'what', 'Lucas', 'done', 'create', 'entire', 'drug', 'enterprise', 'predominantly', 'sort', 'CEO', 'position', 'drug', 'trade.When', 'Lucas', 'mentor', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'away', 'Lucas', 'given', 'keys', 'streets', 'Harlem', 'way', 'serving', 'man', 'people', 'junkies', 'casual', 'users', 'alike', 'quickly', 'known', 'now', 'man', 'charge', 'streets', 'Harlem', 'goods', 'are', 'products', 'will', 'be', 'sold', 'people', 'streets', 'got', 'Harlem', 'took', 'care', 'Harlem', 'Harlem', 'gon', 'take', 'care', 'stated', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'showing', 'knew', 'support', 'amongst', 'was', 'exponentially', 'stronger', 'anyone', 'might', 'initially', 'imagine', 'fear', 'esteem', 'Lucas', 'was', 'able', 'instill', 'simultaneously', 'what', 'truly', 'helped', 'Lucas', 'strive.Like', 'good', 'businessman', 'Lucas', 'ensure', 'customer', 'base', 'product', 'worthy', 'repeating', 'business', 'thereby', 'building', 'committed', 'group', 'customers', 'yearn', 'solely', 'product', 'Lucas', 'out', 'Vietnam', 'importer', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'heroin', 'basically', 'about', 'as', 'pure', 'can', 'get', 'Blue', 'Magic', 'addicts', 'Harlem', 'throat', 'quickly', 'Lucas', 'product', 'talk', 'town', 'drug', 'choice.However', 'when', 'crime', 'spiral', 'control', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'police', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'However', 'due', 'rampant', 'conspiracies', 'episodes', 'police', 'being', 'take', 'larger', 'population', 'police', 'NYPD', 'drug', 'units', 'seem', 'not', 'concern', 'much', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'Harlem.When', 'Detective', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'assigned', 'spearhead', 'federal', 'taskforce', 'drugs', 'Harlem', 'area', 'Roberts', 'assignment', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'previous', 'counterparts', 'Roberts', 'who', 'attending', 'night', 'school', 'become', 'attorney', 'passion', 'hunt', 'down', 'are', 'poisoning', 'killing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Harlem', 'area', 'knew', 'who', 'everyday', 'small', 'players', 'were', 'involved', 'operation', 'one', 'knew', 'magnitude', 'Lucas', 'played', 'role', 'drug', 'trade', 'mainly', 'flew', 'radar.The', 'film', 'documents', 'entire', 'tracking', 'Lucas', 'subsequent', 'court', 'proceedings', 'Roberts', 'were', 'part', 'film', 'good', 'cop', 'bad', 'guy', 'kind', 'movie', 'are', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'help', 'serve', 'added', 'bonus', 'film.What', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'show', 'viewers', 'amount', 'calculation', 'precision', 'went', '1970', 'drug', 'market', 'Harlem', 'Often', 'are', 'quick', 'imagine', 'strung', 'out', 'junkie', 'corner', 'passing', 'bag', 'exchange', 'ten', 'dollars', 'junkie', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'larger', 'more', 'businesslike', 'approach', 'people', 'Lucas', 'bring', 'entire', 'drug', 'culture.Overall', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'two', 'excellent', 'actors', 'portraying', 'roles', 'accurate', 'precise', 'way', 'story', 'film', 'interesting', 'yet', 'not', 'utterly', 'unique', 'story', 'way', 'actual', 'facts', 'were', 'translated', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'very', 'professional', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'way']",American Gangster

As much harm as he does, Lucas' boss also does good, handing out turkeys on Thanksgiving, for instance. When his boss dies, Lucas takes over and expands the empire. He immediately tries to figure out a way to import his drugs, taking out the middleman and increasing the potency, making his empire grow all the faster.

Richie can't do anything but turn it in to the evidence room but his partner worries they will be ostracized. Sure enough, his partner's prediction comes true.

Richie takes his picture, because he has better seats than the head of the local Mafia (Armand Assante), and tells his crew Frank Lucas is their new goal.

From the moment the first frame of film rolls through the projector, you get a feel for the time and place. This story takes place in New York in the early 70s. Director Scott gives the film a brownish tinge, painting the images in a gritty, worn tone, emulating the films made during this period. I almost expected Al Pacino to walk onscreen as Serpico. As with any of Ridley Scott's films, the production values are excellent, costume and production design further cement our feeling of the time and place.Washington and Crowe have each created some very memorable characters and each is almost always, at the least, good. The two haven't appeared together in a feature film for a long time, and the mere idea of their appearance together has generated a lot of buzz and is driving big box office. But ""Gangster"" tells two parallel stories through most of the film's running time. The two actors don't appear on screen together, facing off, until late in the film. This isn't really a criticism, because each actor does such an excellent job of establishing and running with their character. But the fact they don't appear together on screen for such a long period of time contributes to the lack of fireworks.Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, a determined man, with a definite sense of what he wants and how to get it. When his boss dies, he sits at the memorial service and watches all of the other people in the room, noting how they talk about his deceased boss and how they treat him. He witnesses more than a little disrespect and makes a mental note to correct the problems later.As he steps into his boss's shoes, he tries to figure out ways to increase profits and his power, leading him to come up with a plan to import the drugs directly. That means he has to travel to Thailand and Cambodia, at the height of the Vietnam War and meet with the drug lords who manufacture the heroin. Using a cousin who is serving in the Army, he arranges to have the drugs shipped back in the coffins of deceased servicemen. With this part of the plan in place, Frank set up a distribution network and the money starts to roll in. But Frank is a smart guy and he knows the best way to stay under the radar is to drive an old car and wear natty suits. He admonishes his brother (Ejiofor) for wearing a flashy outfit and goes against his better judgment when he wears the expensive, and flashy, chinchilla coat his wife gives him to the Louis fight. Naturally, this is what causes Richie to set his eyes on Lucas.Washington does a great job of making Lucas seem real. Yes, he is a killer and a drug dealer, but he seems more of a businessman. Everything he does is the result of trying to expand his empire. He brings his family north and sets them up in the boroughs of New York because he knows he can trust them. If he is going to have other people handling his money and his product, he wants them to be family. He can trust family. When a rival boss (Idris Elba, HBO's ""The Wire"", ""28 Weeks Later"") demands an unreasonable payment for `rent', Frank tries to reason with him. When that doesn't work, he takes matters into his own hands.As you watch Washington portray all of the different facets of this character you realize the performance is all the more convincing because he could easily be mistaken for an ambitious businessman. Part of this can be attributed to Lucas' desire to remain under the radar by trying to blend in. On the few occasions he lets his better judgment lapse, he doesn't seem comfortable, or entirely convincing for that matter. In a way, this helps Washington's portrayal, because we realize how uncomfortable he is wearing a chinchilla coat and why.Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, the detective who is too honest for his own good. As soon as Richie says he has to return the money he and his partner found, his partner knows they will be ostracized. Cops aren't that honest, if they are, they are probably snitching on other cops. They turn in the money and his partner's prophecy comes true. Richie tries to continue to do his job, but a pivotal moment leads him to realize they will never get the support they need from their department. This is why he welcomes the opportunity to head up the new Drug Enforcement Agency branch in New Jersey. After handpicking the members of his team, he continues to live an extremely honest life, to the amazement of his own team. But he sets an example they follow.Richie is very determined to pull in some big scores and when he sets his sights on Lucas, he almost becomes a pit bull, refusing to let go until he has the man behind bars. Crowe does a very good job of weaving all of these attributes together. Crowe brings all of Roberts' determination to life and makes it believable. It is also interesting to see the few glimpses we have into Roberts' personal life, as these illustrations only serve to further reinforce everything we know about him. Because he is so determined to catch the man, we understand this is a trait of Roberts'. Once he sets his mind to something, he doesn't do much else except pursue leads. This is why he is going through a bitter divorce with his wife (Carla Gugino) and fighting with her for custody of their son. This is why he has meaningless one-night stands with stewardesses. This is why his apartment is a sty.After Richie forms his new task force, he sets his eyes on an Italian Mafioso who is known to be involved in the drug racket. Armed with a camera, he attends the Joe Louis fight and watches Lucas and his wife, both dressed in expensive fur coats, walk to the first row and sit in better seats than the Mafioso. He quickly puts two and two together and determines Lucas is his new target. He and his team start a massive surveillance effort and begin to amass information about Lucas and his dealings.As the story progresses, we learn more and more about these two men and all of the people involved in their lives. Steve Zaillain, one of the most well regarded writers working in Hollywood, gives each character a back-story and makes them an interesting part of this very involving story.Scott, as always, does a good job keeping all of the various threads lively and interesting.But ""American Gangster"" lacks fireworks. You would expect Lucas to get into a number of confrontations and a number of situations leading to deadly outcomes. While there are a few, there are also a number of instances when you might expect something like this to happen only for the story thread to disappear with no resolution. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a rival gangster, complete with the flashy clothes and bling. When Lucas has a problem with him, he confronts Nicky (Gooding, Jr.) in his own club. They throw threats at each other. You would probably expect Lucas or one of his brothers to go out and dispatch the rival. This never happens and there are other examples of this. Without these fireworks, ""Gangster"" becomes more of a police procedural and less a gangster film. I have no doubt this film is a true depiction of what actually happened, and it is very good. But I was expecting more action, more violence, and more fireworks. Heck, I was hoping for it. I don't like it when films have nonstop gratuitous violence, but when you go to see a film about gangsters, you should expect some.That said, ""American Gangster"" is very good. It features fine performances from two of the best actors working in the business today. It also features a wealth of interesting supporting performances. It is a film definitely worth seeing.",4,"Washington and Crowe Face Off - Ala ""Heat""",1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,9588,"['American', 'Gangster', 'new', 'film', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott',

1131458,A27FYYS44LH7KD,B0011HOEY4,Thucydides 1,"[1, 1]","Although this may have revealed Denzel Washington in a nominal performance, it was a waste of Crowe. Crowe is ten times the actor Washington is, even with all his ""badazz"" creations functioning perfectly. Mr Washington typically imbues the characters he portrays with a shallow, one-dimensional personna, fully of crisp anger, combustive energy, and a mentality that expresses itself through perfunctory displays of martial rage. Just once I'd like to see him portray a character who doesn't seem like he's about to put his fist into a windshield every five minutes.But, yes, at first, Washington dazzles with his edgy gangster projection. The street scene where he pops the guy with a .45 semi-auto and then returns to lunch comes to mind. But after a while (and this movie lasts for what seems like half the DAY), all of this gets boring.The Crowe character counters it more effectively toward the ending of the movie, obviously, but still...what a waste. Crowe, matching wits with a simple, one-dimensional criminal.  That got boring, too.Oh, I know that many will find it impossible to resist comparisons with ""Scarface"", and actually, many of those comparisions would be accurate. Both movies became boring and repetitive in their concocted violence, but at least ""American Gangster"" had Crowe.  And although Crowe may have been wasted in this movie, it's the reason I gave it two stars.",2,"An inconsistent, wearisome L-O-N-G bore",1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,1392,"['may', 'have', 'revealed', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'nominal', 'performance', 'was', 'waste', 'Crowe', 'Crowe', 'ten', 'times', 'actor', 'Washington', 'even', 'badazz', 'creations', 'functioning', 'perfectly', 'Mr', 'Washington', 'typically', 'characters', 'shallow', 'one-dimensional', 'personna', 'fully', 'crisp', 'anger', 'combustive', 'energy', 'mentality', 'perfunctory', 'displays', 'martial', 'rage', 'Just', 'once', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'portray', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'put', 'fist', 'windshield', 'five', 'minutes.But', 'yes', 'first', 'Washington', 'edgy', 'gangster', 'projection', 'street', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', '.45', 'semi-auto', 'then', 'returns', 'lunch', 'mind', 'while', 'movie', 'what', 'DAY', 'boring.The', 'Crowe', 'character', 'counters', 'more', 'effectively', 'ending', 'movie', 'obviously', 'still', 'what', 'waste', 'Crowe', 'matching', 'wits', 'simple', 'one-dimensional', 'criminal', 'got', 'boring', 'too.Oh', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'impossible', 'resist', 'comparisons', 'Scarface', 'actually', 'many', 'comparisions', 'would', 'be', 'accurate', 'movies', 'became', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'concocted', 'violence', 'least', 'American', 'Gangster', 'had', 'Crowe', 'Crowe', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wasted', 'movie', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'stars']",American Gangster
1131459,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0011HOEY4,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 3]","Take a pair of great actors at the top of their game and add a director who plays this movie to his greatest strengths. Add a solid supporting cast. Find a true-crime tale that mixes classic good vs evil into a Mobster story, and you have ""American Gangster."" For those that have well viewed copies ofScarface,BugsyorThe Godfather Collectionin your DVD library, then ""American Gangster"" should be on your shortlist for fall theater going.The interesting parallel stories between Crowe's Richie Roberts and Washington's Frank Lucas are what makes a near three hour movie rush by so seamlessly. Both men are doggedly determined to be the uncompromising men they know they should be, with Roberts getting into rocky ground by turning in - and not keeping for himself - a huge stash of found money, and Lucas by deciding he is going to take on the drug trade by reshaping it in his own image. Each man has quirks that show their character's depth, be it Lucas' strict codes of behaviour (a scene where he dresses down his brother for looking like a bad 70's blaxploitation character is very funny) to Richie's marital discord. These scenes show two men on a collision course. Indeed, they don't even share any real screen time till near the end of the movie.But it is that headlong charge towards the inevitable that gives ""American Gangster"" its edge. There are hardly any wasted moments here, and given the film's running time, that lack of filler says a lot. Standout performances from Ruby Dee as Momma Lucas and Josh Brolin's cop-on-the-take Lt Trupo also give the movie power. The contrast in lives (Richie's collapsing family as he battles evil compared to Lucas' exceptionally tight-knit family that goes to church on Sunday and distributes Thanksgiving Turkeys even as they sell heroin to anyone with a ten dollar bill) makes for some jarring, disturbing moments. A dark humor leavens parts of the violence...this is a movie that opens with a particularly grisly murder just before a main character bemoans the dearth of local businesses in the old neighborhood. Lucas takes his cue from his old boss, telling his new bride ""The man I worked for had one of the biggest companies in New York City. He didn't own his own company. White man owned it, so they owned him. Nobody owns me, though.""However, the real story is that Lucas does make his mistakes, which begin as he breaks one of his own rules and wears a conspicuous coat and draws the eyes of Richie's unit. Lucas' luck lasts as long as the VietNam war plays out, but Scott also throws in one more great line from the overseas supplier that Lucas gets his heroin directly from. They both know that the end of the war means not only is the game over, but anything else they do is of a great risk. What gets Lucas caught is ultimately his own greed, because even his supplier tells him ""It's not in my best interest to say this Frank, but quitting while you're ahead, is not the same as quitting."" Lucas still can't stop, and arranges one last big score.The fall of Frank Lucas may filmatically begin there, but this real life ""Superfly"" is still a bad man we love to see. Washington plays him as all charm and control, love of efficiency and family, a shiny smart veneer covering an explosive and dangerous person. He's the perfect movie villain, and watching Washington play him makes you smell Oscar. After all, we love our Gangster Dramas come Oscar time (The Godfather,The Departed,GoodFellasandThe Untouchablesto name a few), and with a film as brilliant as ""American Gangster,"" it will be hard for the Academy not to notice.",5,The loudest person in the room is the weakest person in the room,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,3591,"['Take', 'pair', 'great', 'actors', 'top', 'game', 'add', 'director', 'who', 'movie', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'Add', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Find', 'true-crime', 'tale', 'mixes', 'classic', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'Mobster', 'story', 'have', 'American', 'Gangster', 'have', 'well', 'viewed', 'copies', 'ofScarface', 'BugsyorThe', 'Godfather', 'Collectionin', 'DVD', 'library', 'then', 'American', 'Gangster', 'should', 'be', 'shortlist', 'fall', 'theater', 'going.The', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'stories', 'Crowe', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Washington', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'are', 'what', 'near', 'three', 'hour', 'movie', 'rush', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'men', 'are', 'doggedly', 'determined', 'be', 'uncompromising', 'men', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'Roberts', 'getting', 'rocky', 'ground', 'turning', 'not', 'keeping', 'huge', 'stash', 'found', 'money', 'Lucas', 'deciding', 'going', 'take', 'drug', 'trade', 'reshaping', 'own', 'image', 'man', 'show', 'character', 'depth', 'be', 'Lucas', 'strict', 'codes', 'behaviour', 'scene', 'where', 'down', 'brother', 'looking', 'bad', '70', 'blaxploitation', 'character', 'very', 'funny', 'Richie', 'marital', 'discord', 'scenes', 'show', 'two', 'men', 'collision', 'course', 'Indeed', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'share', 'real', 'screen', 'time', 'till', 'end', 'movie.But', 'headlong', 'charge', 'inevitable', 'American', 'Gangster', 'edge', 'are', 'hardly', 'wasted', 'moments', 'here', 'given', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'lack', 'filler', 'lot', 'Standout', 'performances', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Momma', 'Lucas', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'cop-on-the-take', 'Lt', 'Trupo', 'also', 'give', 'movie', 'power', 'contrast', 'lives', 'Richie', 'collapsing', 'family', 'evil', 'compared', 'Lucas', 'exceptionally', 'tight-knit', 'family', 'church', 'Sunday', 'Thanksgiving', 'Turkeys', 'even', 'sell', 'heroin', 'anyone', 'ten', 'dollar', 'bill', 'jarring', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'dark', 'humor', 'parts', 'violence', 'movie', 'particularly', 'grisly', 'murder', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'dearth', 'local', 'businesses', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Lucas', 'cue', 'old', 'boss', 'telling', 'new', 'bride', 'man', 'worked', 'had', 'one', 'biggest', 'companies', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'did', ""n't"", 'own', 'own', 'company', 'White', 'man', 'owned', 'owned', 'Nobody', 'though', 'However', 'real', 'story', 'Lucas', 'make', 'mistakes', 'begin', 'one', 'own', 'rules', 'conspicuous', 'coat', 'eyes', 'Richie', 'unit', 'Lucas', 'luck', 'lasts', 'as', 'long', 'VietNam', 'war', 'out', 'Scott', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'great', 'line', 'overseas', 'supplier', 'Lucas', 'heroin', 'directly', 'know', 'end', 'war', 'not', 'only', 'game', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'great', 'risk', 'What', 'Lucas', 'caught', 'ultimately', 'own', 'greed', 'even', 'supplier', 'not', 'best', 'interest', 'say', 'Frank', 'quitting', ""'re"", 'ahead', 'not', 'same', 'quitting', 'Lucas', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'one', 'last', 'big', 'score.The', 'fall', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'may', 'filmatically', 'begin', 'there', 'real', 'life', 'Superfly', 'still', 'bad', 'man', 'love', 'see', 'Washington', 'charm', 'control', 'love', 'efficiency', 'family', 'shiny', 'smart', 'veneer', 'covering', 'explosive', 'dangerous', 'person', 'perfect', 'movie', 'villain', 'watching', 'Washington', 'play', 'smell', 'Oscar', 'love', 'Gangster', 'Dramas', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'Godfather', 'Departed', 'GoodFellasandThe', 'Untouchablesto', 'name', 'few', 'film', 'as', 'brilliant', 'American', 'Gangster', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'Academy', 'not', 'notice']",American Gangster

1131461,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0011HOEY4,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","I'm not particularly fond of Russell Crowe, but when he came together with Ridley Scott, some terrific movies got made. Throw Denzel Washington into the mix and you have the makings of an epic drama. American Gangster was beloved by critics and the academy alike, but it also received negative reviews from the people the story was based on, who claimed it was ninety percent fiction. The film takes almost 3 hours to tell us the story of Frank Lucas, a man who was mentored by the great Bumpy Johnson, and ran Harlem, along with much of the heroin on the east coast from 1969 to 1977. In passed years, even prior to this film, Frank Lucas has been immortalized as some kind of hero. Many believe that he kept the people of Harlem out of poverty and ultimately did the right thing, once his conscience caught up with him. The film American Gangster seems to agree with this take on the story and portray Lucas as a man larger than life, who you want to like, despite his criminal activity. The truth is that Lucas was no hero, as for a decade he ran a crew as large as any organized crime family, and he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people who overdosed on his junk. When Lucas turned states evidence, leading to the arrest of 150 people, most of whom were corrupt officials in New York City, it had nothing to do with his conscience, he just wanted to stay out of jail. That's not how it portrayed and was the only thing that really kept this film from getting a five star rating. American Gangster is shot much in the same style as Heat, with a large cast and fasting moving scenes. Denzel Washington is always good, but when he's playing someone from his own community he really steps it up to a whole other level. Washington absolutely should have received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Lucas. Regardless of how true the story may have been, Washington was just amazing. Denzel is paired with Russell Crowe, who portrays the man who is chasing him, a very deep and interesting man that seemed to fit Crowe's personality to a tee. American Gangster is a long, fast moving story, that may not be all that accurate, but you will be hard pressed to find a better cast then the one they had and for that, American Gangster is labeled as a must see movie.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,2282,"[""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'when', 'came', 'together', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'terrific', 'movies', 'got', 'made', 'Throw', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'mix', 'have', 'makings', 'epic', 'drama', 'American', 'Gangster', 'was', 'beloved', 'critics', 'academy', 'alike', 'also', 'received', 'negative', 'reviews', 'people', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'ninety', 'percent', 'fiction', 'film', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'mentored', 'great', 'Bumpy', 'Johnson', 'ran', 'Harlem', 'much', 'heroin', 'east', 'coast', '1969', '1977', 'passed', 'years', 'even', 'prior', 'film', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'been', 'immortalized', 'kind', 'hero', 'Many', 'believe', 'kept', 'people', 'Harlem', 'poverty', 'ultimately', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'once', 'conscience', 'caught', 'up', 'film', 'American', 'Gangster', 'agree', 'take', 'story', 'portray', 'Lucas', 'man', 'larger', 'life', 'who', 'want', 'like', 'criminal', 'activity', 'truth', 'Lucas', 'was', 'hero', 'decade', 'ran', 'crew', 'as', 'large', 'organized', 'crime', 'family', 'was', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'thousands', 'people', 'who', 'overdosed', 'junk', 'When', 'Lucas', 'turned', 'states', 'evidence', 'leading', 'arrest', '150', 'people', 'most', 'whom', 'were', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'conscience', 'just', 'wanted', 'stay', 'jail', 'not', 'how', 'portrayed', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'kept', 'film', 'getting', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'American', 'Gangster', 'shot', 'much', 'same', 'style', 'Heat', 'large', 'cast', 'fasting', 'moving', 'scenes', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'always', 'good', 'when', 'playing', 'someone', 'own', 'community', 'really', 'up', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'Washington', 'absolutely', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'Lucas', 'Regardless', 'how', 'true', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Washington', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'Denzel', 'paired', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'chasing', 'very', 'deep', 'interesting', 'man', 'seemed', 'fit', 'Crowe', 'personality', 'tee', 'American', 'Gangster', 'long', 'fast', 'moving', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'accurate', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'better', 'cast', 'then', 'one', 'had', 'American', 'Gangster', 'labeled', 'must', 'see', 'movie']",American Gangster

While it has it's problems, it is worth a watch.The performances are good, but not outstanding.  Washington gave his now standard hard-nosed straight shooter performance we have seen from him many times.  While I like him, it would be nice to see some range.  Crow also stayed with his normal performance, which has never had range.  He managed to take a conflicted character and make him fairly run-of-the-mill.  Both men held their role together and didn't negetively affect the movie, but also didn't shine.  The only performance I really had a problem with was Brolin.  I am of mixed opinions whether the dumbed down, one shade crocked cop was his doing, or the writing.  I actually liked Cuba Gooding Jr. in his role.  He took an obnoxious character and ran with it, playing it to the hilt.  I also really liked Ric Young's performance.  He and Washington really played off each other, and you could sense the characters general affection for each other.The writing itself is passable, but again, doesn't shine.  The Brolin sub-plot is down right boring, the crocked ex-partner is un-interesting, and most everything not directly connected to Washington's character feels like a different movie.What makes this movie more then just a three start run of the mill bio-pic is the story of Bumpy Johnson. The man was interesting, and it is what carries everything.  Also, the rise of the Harlem drug trade and the dynamics of the gang control of the area is also fascinating.As a straight up film, this movie is run of the mill.

When holding Ridley Scott's foray into the world of the mob against most average films, ""American Gangster"" looks like a classic, but when compared to The Godfather, the crime films of Scorsese or even The Sopranos, this feature seems stuck in a pair of cement galoshes""Gangster"" details the meteoric rise and fall of Frank Lucas (Washington), a 1970s narcotics drug lord from Harlem.  In what could be a lesson in an introductory business class, the film shows how Lucas was able to create a monopoly in the drug world by providing a better product at a lower price.  A true capitalist innovator, Lucas achieved his bargain basement prices by eliminated the dozen or so buffers between the opium fields and the street.  He flew to Southeast Asia himself, bought his product and had his family sell it on the street.  With no skimmers taking a piece at each port, truck depot, or airfield, Lucas built a company that crushed his competition.Because of the skills of Denzel Washington, Lucas is both monstrous and human.  His work ethic, creativity and dedication paint the picture of a man who could have been the CEO of a major company had life dealt him different cards.  Instead, he built an empire described as more powerful that the mafia.  His counterpart (and equal in many ways) is Richie Roberts (Crowe) the unrelenting by-the-book New Jersey cop who brought him down.By casting these titans as leads, Scott is able to camouflage many of his flaws.  Washington and Crowe both deliver what for other actors would be career-defining performances, but ""Gangster"" doesn't offer the total package of other crime stories.  It lacks the humor and cinematic artistry of Goodfellas and The Sopranos and fails to grasp the regalness of The Godfather.  The most creative element of the film is the Scorsese-like trailer with the retro sounds of Jay-Z`s  Heart of the City.  Many films would fail when compared to the best of the mob genre, so that does not mean ""American Gangster"" is without merit.  With two of America's finest actors at the top of their game and an irresistable story that brushes up against Vietnam, Ali and Nixon, the lack of creativity on the part of Ridley Scott is all that's keeping this from being one of the best films of the decade.",4,"Solid Film, But Not Among the Genre's Best",1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,2426,"['Unfortunately', 'American', 'Gangster', 'story', 'genre', 'provided', 'richest', 'contributions', 'pop', 'culture', 'last', 'half', 'century', 'When', 'holding', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'foray', 'world', 'mob', 'most', 'average', 'films', 'American', 'Gangster', 'classic', 'when', 'compared', 'Godfather', 'crime', 'films', 'Scorsese', 'even', 'Sopranos', 'feature', 'stuck', 'pair', 'cement', 'galoshes', 'Gangster', 'details', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'fall', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'Washington', '1970s', 'narcotics', 'drug', 'lord', 'Harlem', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'lesson', 'introductory', 'business', 'class', 'film', 'how', 'Lucas', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'monopoly', 'drug', 'world', 'providing', 'better', 'product', 'lower', 'price', 'true', 'capitalist', 'innovator', 'Lucas', 'achieved', 'bargain', 'basement', 'prices', 'eliminated', 'dozen', 'so', 'buffers', 'opium', 'fields', 'street', 'flew', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'bought', 'product', 'had', 'family', 'sell', 'street', 'skimmers', 'taking', 'piece', 'port', 'truck', 'depot', 'airfield', 'Lucas', 'built', 'company', 'crushed', 'competition.Because', 'skills', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Lucas', 'monstrous', 'human', 'work', 'ethic', 'creativity', 'dedication', 'paint', 'picture', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'CEO', 'major', 'company', 'had', 'life', 'dealt', 'different', 'cards', 'Instead', 'built', 'empire', 'described', 'more', 'powerful', 'mafia', 'counterpart', 'equal', 'many', 'ways', 'Richie', 'Roberts', 'Crowe', 'unrelenting', 'by-the-book', 'New', 'Jersey', 'cop', 'who', 'brought', 'down.By', 'casting', 'titans', 'leads', 'Scott', 'able', 'camouflage', 'many', 'flaws', 'Washington', 'Crowe', 'deliver', 'what', 'other', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'career-defining', 'performances', 'Gangster', ""n't"", 'offer', 'total', 'package', 'other', 'crime', 'stories', 'humor', 'cinematic', 'artistry', 'Goodfellas', 'Sopranos', 'grasp', 'regalness', 'Godfather', 'most', 'creative', 'element', 'film', 'Scorsese-like', 'trailer', 'retro', 'sounds', 'Jay-Z', 's', 'Heart', 'City', 'Many', 'films', 'would', 'fail', 'when', 'compared', 'best', 'mob', 'genre', 'not', 'mean', 'American', 'Gangster', 'merit', 'two', 'America', 'finest', 'actors', 'top', 'game', 'irresistable', 'story', 'up', 'Vietnam', 'Ali', 'Nixon', 'lack', 'creativity', 'part', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'keeping', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'decade']",American Gangster

Whether it be the U.S. military flying drugs out of Asia, the corruption of U.S. cops, or the almost surreal life of mobster Frank Lucas, all those real-life accounts are riveting, making one question how such things could possibly happen in our great country.Yet, as portrayed in this film, those stories became quite overextended or overblown, as a result making this film seem like a documentary instead of real life-inspired drama.  True, I did watch the Extended Edition, but I am confident that the 18-minute less Theatrical Edition would have improved things only slightly.  The film moves along at a snails pace, which while probably necessary in order to portray all the complex emotions of the movie, still may make the viewer feel as though this is a marathon viewing.Also, the acting in this film is pretty toned down as well.  I'm not sure if this was because that was just what the real-life people were like, but either way it was underwhelming.  The cool, intense Denzel Washington only comes out in glimpses, which is a shame in a movie that features so much of him.  Only Russell Crowe's character shows great character development, and even that is not up to the standards of most dramas.To conclude, then, this film was likely the best it possibly could have been...but still doesn't translate into compelling drama.  The complex drug storyline is very interesting, but the movie's extremely long run time and mellow acting will often make you feel as if you have been watching forever.",3,"A Great (True) Story, But Falls A Bit Flat On Film",1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,1614,"['one', 'were', 'focus', 'strictly', 'plot/story', 'when', 'evaluating', 'film', 'would', 'easily', 'receive', 'five', 'stars', 'be', 'U.S.', 'military', 'flying', 'drugs', 'Asia', 'corruption', 'U.S.', 'cops', 'almost', 'surreal', 'life', 'mobster', 'Frank', 'Lucas', 'real-life', 'accounts', 'are', 'riveting', 'making', 'one', 'question', 'how', 'such', 'things', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'great', 'country.Yet', 'portrayed', 'film', 'stories', 'became', 'quite', 'overextended', 'overblown', 'result', 'making', 'film', 'seem', 'documentary', 'instead', 'real', 'life-inspired', 'drama', 'True', 'did', 'watch', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'am', 'confident', '18-minute', 'less', 'Theatrical', 'Edition', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'things', 'only', 'slightly', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'snails', 'pace', 'probably', 'necessary', 'order', 'portray', 'complex', 'emotions', 'movie', 'still', 'may', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'marathon', 'viewing.Also', 'acting', 'film', 'pretty', 'toned', 'down', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'real-life', 'people', 'were', 'like', 'way', 'was', 'underwhelming', 'cool', 'intense', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'only', 'out', 'glimpses', 'shame', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Only', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'character', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'not', 'up', 'standards', 'most', 'dramas.To', 'conclude', 'then', 'film', 'was', 'likely', 'best', 'possibly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'still', ""n't"", 'translate', 'compelling', 'drama', 'complex', 'drug', 'storyline', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'extremely', 'long', 'run', 'time', 'mellow', 'acting', 'will', 'often', 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'forever']",American Gangster

The acting was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of either Denzel or Russel Crow.  That's not saying they are ""bad"" actors, I'm just ""not a fan""!  I thought the movie became hokey during certain parts, like when Denzel walks out of the church when he finds out they're on to him, and ""Amazing Grace"" is being sung by the choir in the background.  Hollywood seems to overuse the beautiful hym in alot of films, and it's becoming corny, like, oh no something traumatic happened, cue ""Amazing Grace"".  Use something original to evoke emotion, instead of relying on the easy way out.  They also used ""110th Street"" in the film, which was used in Jackie Brown!  It's like whoa, it's too soon to use that cool song in a movie again.  Blatant.  My favourite parts of American gangster were the scenes with Ruby Dee.  (All 2 of them).  For them to nominate her for this role is bizarre.  Ruby Dee was so much better in ""Jungle Fever"".  Her character was similar to the one in this movie but it was much more dynamic in Jungle Fever.  Why didn't they nominate her for that role, huh????  Oh yeah, it's a Spike Lee movie, I forgot.  Ruby Dee also had a much better role in ""The Stand"".  She is just a fantastic actress. And that's the good part, now for more bad...  The end of the film seemed a bit rushed and just didn't end on a good note.  It sort of made the whole movie collapse on itself. This is good for a one time viewing, the story was interesting, but been done before in a lot of other films.",3,Gangster?...Nothin' to brag about baby!,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,1577,"['put', 'gun', 'head', 'would', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'genuinely', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Denzel', 'Russel', 'Crow', 'not', 'saying', 'are', 'bad', 'actors', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'fan', 'thought', 'movie', 'became', 'hokey', 'certain', 'parts', 'when', 'Denzel', 'church', 'when', 'out', ""'re"", 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'being', 'sung', 'choir', 'background', 'Hollywood', 'overuse', 'beautiful', 'hym', 'alot', 'films', 'becoming', 'corny', 'oh', 'something', 'traumatic', 'happened', 'cue', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'Use', 'something', 'original', 'evoke', 'emotion', 'instead', 'relying', 'easy', 'way', 'also', 'used', '110th', 'Street', 'film', 'was', 'used', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'whoa', 'too', 'soon', 'use', 'cool', 'song', 'movie', 'again', 'Blatant', 'My', 'favourite', 'parts', 'American', 'gangster', 'were', 'scenes', 'Ruby', 'Dee', '2', 'nominate', 'role', 'bizarre', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'character', 'was', 'similar', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'dynamic', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'nominate', 'role', 'huh', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'forgot', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'also', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'Stand', 'just', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'good', 'part', 'now', 'more', 'bad', 'end', 'film', 'seemed', 'bit', 'rushed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'good', 'note', 'sort', 'made', 'whole', 'movie', 'collapse', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'lot', 'other', 'films']",American Gangster
