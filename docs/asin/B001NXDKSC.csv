Gives you a brief history of how Alex ended up in Central Park Zoo, Melman finally revealing his true feelings to Norman and Marty realizing his being unique from other zebras. They start off in their quest of going back home to NY with the King Julien, Maurice & Mort tagging along and the Penguins at the helm of the controls of the makeshift airplane. When they crash landed somewhere in Africa, it is where Alex reconnects with his family and the adventure begins for the rest of the bunch. This is a totally entertaining sequel although I agree with one reviewer that the Penguins dvd packaged here with the movie wasnt much, wasnt worth the extra cost.

1221200,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,B001NXDKSC,"Kimba W. Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[5, 8]","I repeatedly hear comparisons of Madagascar 2 with The Lion King. I don't see anything more than a _very_ superficial similarity between the two movies. Not enough to even be worth a comment.However, much of the opening sequence is a direct steal from a far better movie,Two Brothers (Widescreen Edition). The way the sequence ends suggests that it is not theft so much as one of the many ""references"" made in this movie, but I doubt enough people saw Two Brothers to make the reference really work.There are also many similarities to another movie,Jungle Emperor Leo, beginning at the end of that same opening sequence and running throughout all of Alex's story. I can't see that being an intentional reference.But my reason for a weak star rating is that they simply tried to do too much in Madagascar 2. They have at least 5 stories going on simultaneously, all of which needed more screen time to be satisfying. Alex's story gets the most screen time; unfortunately it is a story we've all seen hundreds of times, and it is still so rushed that there's not enough time to add the little touches that would have made the journey to the foregone conclusion worthwhile.As for the second disc in this 2-pack, you get 2 TV-style cartoons featuring the penguins and some of the lesser characters from the movie (there is no continuity with the movie storyline). They're cute and funny, but it's only 25 minutes plus some minor ""special features"", so considering the extra cost of this pack over the single-disc movie only, it's not really good value for your money.Overall, Madagascar 2 is a safe enough kid's movie -- most kids probably won't notice the lack of substance -- with nothing to make the parents squeamish (unless you're offended by screen-filling butt shots), but there's also nothing to elevate it to the level of the two movies I noted above.",3,Too much for one movie.,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,1856,"['repeatedly', 'hear', 'comparisons', 'Madagascar', '2', 'Lion', 'King', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'more', '_very_', 'superficial', 'similarity', 'two', 'movies', 'Not', 'enough', 'even', 'be', 'comment.However', 'much', 'opening', 'sequence', 'direct', 'steal', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'way', 'sequence', 'not', 'theft', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'many', 'references', 'made', 'movie', 'doubt', 'enough', 'people', 'saw', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'make', 'reference', 'really', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'similarities', 'movie', 'Jungle', 'Emperor', 'Leo', 'beginning', 'end', 'same', 'opening', 'sequence', 'running', 'Alex', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'intentional', 'reference.But', 'reason', 'weak', 'star', 'rating', 'simply', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'Madagascar', '2', 'have', 'least', '5', 'stories', 'going', 'simultaneously', 'needed', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'be', 'satisfying', 'Alex', 'story', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'times', 'still', 'so', 'rushed', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'add', 'little', 'touches', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'journey', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'worthwhile.As', 'second', 'disc', '2-pack', 'get', '2', 'TV-style', 'cartoons', 'featuring', 'penguins', 'lesser', 'characters', 'movie', 'continuity', 'movie', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'cute', 'funny', 'only', '25', 'minutes', 'minor', 'special', 'features', 'considering', 'extra', 'cost', 'pack', 'single-disc', 'movie', 'only', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'value', 'money.Overall', 'Madagascar', '2', 'safe', 'enough', 'kid', 'movie', 'most', 'kids', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'lack', 'substance', 'nothing', 'make', 'parents', 'squeamish', ""'re"", 'offended', 'screen-filling', 'butt', 'shots', 'also', 'nothing', 'elevate', 'level', 'two', 'movies', 'noted']","Move It, Move It: (Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa / The Penguins of Madagascar)"
1221201,A36WTXJBYS3DB6,B001NXDKSC,N. B. Kennedy,"[16, 24]","This duo was given to my son the other day. After watching the original movie, I was pretty sure I wouldn't like one or two references and scenes, but I gave this one a chance, just so I wouldn't be the mean old parent.What a mistake! This movie, a PG, is not anything you'd want your child to watch. For 10 or 15 minutes, we laughed, but then I no longer could laugh when the blatant sexual references began to pile on. In addition to the suggestive language, the characters make pointed references to each other's bodies and the song lyrics are salacious at times.Beyond that, the writers seem to think that physical violence is hilarious, so the viewer is faced with scenes of guns and beatings -- and not the momentary cartoon violence of a Three Stooges movie. Regrettably, the vindictive old woman with the pocketbook figures largely in this sequel, and most of her scenes feature harangues and beatings.The movie isn't worth watching beyond the first 10 minutes anyway. There's not a laugh to be had after that. The love story between two of the main characters drags the story down. Even at 10, my son isn't interested in this sort of plot. Why is our culture so intent on sexualizing young children?Next time, I'll listen to my inner parent and just say no.
