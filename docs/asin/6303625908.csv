I'm pretty sure the old Beta version I watched with my grandma 15 years ago was better than this. I am watching this on an HD flatscreen but that doesn't seem to improve the picture quality.However, my review  is of the movie itself, not the pic quality. This is my favorite Christmas movie. It's not a popular movie and I don't know how I ended up watching it to begin with but I'm so glad I did. My grandma loved Christmas movies and this was one that we watched together when I was about 10 years old. I was so glad to run across this on Amazon. I never imagined that it would be out on DVD.I highly recommend this. Great family movie and I think your kids would love it.

He can't forget that when he was 10-years-old his father, who had lost his job as a traveling salesman due to changing times, left the family for life as a hobo. Now, after 25 years away, his Dad (played well by Barnard Hughes) has decided it is time to come home for Christmas.Charlie's resentment toward his Dad runs deep. Three years ago Charlie had lost his job as a steel worker, but instead of running away, as he perceives his father did, he went on to join the police force in Salt Lake City. Two years ago his wife died and he has juggled single-parenting and a demanding job since then. When his dad shows up at the police station Charlie, obviously angry, offers to drive him back to the rail yards, but will not let him come home with him for Christmas.*Spoilers*Later, as Charlie relates the experience to his girlfriend, she says she thinks he should reconsider because the children deserve to know their grandfather. He relents and goes to find his father, but tells him it is only for one day. The children are happy to have a grandfather and want him to stay for Christmas, but the tension between father and son is often high. Though they share a love for the children and a love of woodworking, Charlie sees an unbridgeable chasm between them because of the difference in the way they handled things when they each lost their jobs while supporting their families.Reluctantly Charlie lets his dad stay for the holiday and Chance (Charlie's Dad) involves his hobo friends in the Christmas celebration. It is a little unconventional, but heartwarming. However, it was only for the holiday. The next day the kids will wake to find that Grandpa is gone. The closure comes when Chance is finally able to quit trying to make excuses for his past and admit that he was wrong.Though the portrayal of the hobos (a seemingly dated term, as are a few other things in this movie from a few decades ago) may be somewhat sanitized, I appreciated the message of forgiveness and giving loved ones another chance that the movie emphasizes. It is family friendly. I wouldn't say it is exactly geared to children, though it will be too tame for people who are used to action and intrigue. This is a movie about people and relationships. I am glad to have it in my Christmas movie collection.

The father  (Gerald MacRainey) is estranged because the granpa, took off and left him--and only sent post cards while he wished his daddy was near.  Now that he has shown up--he wants him gone ASAP!!  No uncertain terms--But the little grandson is thrilled to meet gramps and is doing all he can to get daddy to keep him.  Many tricks, many excuses--all falling on a deaf ear.  You get so envolved in this story you don't want to leave your seat.  So stange that this fine film was never much acknowledged by reviewers or seen on TV.!!  It certainly deserved to be.  It isn't found in every stack you see for sale either.  I don't think it ever made it to DVD.  It is well made, beautiful to see--and there is a happy ending of course ( but a tear may fall from your eye!)
