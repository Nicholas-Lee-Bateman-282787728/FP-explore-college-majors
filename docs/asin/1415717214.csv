169758,A1JUD55XV8FDWS,1415717214,Adam,"[0, 0]","I watch and collect lots of TV on DVD, and after watching the first season of Beverly Hills 90210 it is, by far, my favorite TV show. It contains everything that any good TV show should: great acting, characters, storylines, and plenty of addicting drama.From the pilot to the finale, each episode is worth watching over and over. The issues in the show are issues that trigger your emotions, make you have flashbacks, or help you go through the issues you may be going through now.At the beginning, the show focuses on a family moving to Beverly Hills and trying to get used to the way people live, the danger of their new address, making new friends and dealing with issues that they haven't dealt with before.I fell in love with these characters at first sight.- Cindy and Jim Walsh are the best parents, they're understanding at times, but they are still 'parents'. They are trying to get used to life in Beverly Hills.- Brandon Walsh is an easy going teen who everyone wants as a friend. He falls for a lot of girls and it sometimes gets the best of him, but he's a great guy.- Brenda Walsh is Brandon's rebellious twin. She is very over dramatic, it's so funny to watch her.- Kelly is Brenda's first friend in Beverly Hills. She seems like the very conceited and stuck up rich girl, but once we get to know her she is a great friend with a lot of problems, too.- Steve is Kelly's ex boyfriend. He is a lot like Kelly, and seems like the stuck up rich guy, but there's a side to him that has feelings and a good heart.- Dylan is the 'bad' boy that Brenda falls for. Jim doesn't want Brenda seeing him, but beneath the rough exterior, he is one of the best guys on the show with a rocky past.- Andrea is who we think is the usual geek who takes a liking to Brandon. But as the show progresses, we can't help but love her!- Donna is a part of the gang who is close friends with Kelly. It's hard to understand her sometimes because she's quiet, but through the show we gain more respect for her character.- David starts out as a freshman who can only dream of hanging out with the gang, a total geek. But in the end, David isn't so bad after all.When these characters collide, love, drama, new friends and flings occur.Some of the darker issues that come up include things that a lot of people go through: sneaking into clubs, losing virginity, cheating on exams, parents abusing drugs, marriages being threatened, date rape victims, discovering alcohol and drunk driving, even spending a night in jail, cancer scares, shoplifting, befriending someone who could actually kill someone, etc, etc, etc.But it's not all drama. There are some light subjects to balance the issues out: moving to a new town, rescuing someone from dorwning, beach parties, secrets that come out at slumber parties, awful hair dyes, road trips, teens trying to rebel, and much more.In the finale, there are very serious things happening. Will the Walshes have to leave the place where they've dealt with so many new things and made so many great new friends? A dramatic break up occurs, is it the end? The cliffhanger that occurs in the final moments of the finale will make you NEED to have season 2 ASAP!If you are thinking about buying this season, you wouldn't regret it.

Maybe this show was a little to wild for me but by today's standards, this little gem seems pretty tame now. I love Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth, they play such close friends on the show, that it was such a surrpise to me that they hated each other in real life. Rest in peace Aaron Spelling, and thanks to Darren Starr for creating one of the most important and spellbinding shows of the '90s. Anyone who was ever a fan of this show, should get season one as soon as possible. So sit back and take a trip down memory lane with Brandon, Brenda, Kelly, Steve, Andrea, Dylan, Donna, and David, and that weirdo that accidentally shot himself in season two.

169760,A1JHQT5ZS4JDCC,1415717214,Alex,"[2, 6]","I am among the generation of people who grew up watching this show. I was like 12 when it aired in Costa Rica. I remember I used to sit with my mom to watch it. Some people think the show was superficial and non-sense, but for me, the first 3 seasons showed a lot of values and positive messages: danger of AIDS, handycap needs, sex before marriage, self-defense, overcome learning disabilities, etc, etc. Yes, it has its ups and downs, like everything, but in the end you enjoy it pretty much.As I said before, for me, the show lasted 3 season until the highschool graduation day. Beyond that, they did what they do to most of aaron spelling shows: take advantage of the popularity and ratings generated to trash it as much as they can by turning it into a soap opera. The same happen to melrose place and charmed.People consider Shannen doherty as a trouble-maker. For me, she was the reason 90210 was worth it as well as for charmed. In both tv shows, when she left, that was it.I cant wait to see all over again: the arrival of the walshes to beverly hills, getting to know new friends and new characters, getting jobs, learning that not everything should be judge by appereances and watch the characters grow up with the show.I recommend this as a must-have to a die fan of the show!!",5,Not the best show.... but great 3 first seasons!,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,1289,"['am', 'generation', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'was', '12', 'when', 'aired', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'remember', 'used', 'sit', 'mom', 'watch', 'people', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'superficial', 'non-sense', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'showed', 'lot', 'values', 'positive', 'messages', 'danger', 'AIDS', 'handycap', 'needs', 'sex', 'marriage', 'self-defense', 'overcome', 'learning', 'disabilities', 'etc', 'etc', 'Yes', 'ups', 'downs', 'everything', 'end', 'enjoy', 'pretty', 'much.As', 'said', 'show', 'lasted', '3', 'season', 'highschool', 'graduation', 'day', 'Beyond', 'did', 'what', 'do', 'most', 'aaron', 'spelling', 'shows', 'take', 'advantage', 'popularity', 'ratings', 'generated', 'trash', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'turning', 'soap', 'opera', 'same', 'happen', 'melrose', 'place', 'charmed.People', 'consider', 'Shannen', 'doherty', 'trouble-maker', 'was', 'reason', '90210', 'was', 'worth', 'as', 'well', 'charmed', 'tv', 'shows', 'when', 'left', 'was', 'it.I', 'cant', 'wait', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'arrival', 'walshes', 'beverly', 'hills', 'getting', 'know', 'new', 'friends', 'new', 'characters', 'getting', 'jobs', 'learning', 'not', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'judge', 'appereances', 'watch', 'characters', 'grow', 'up', 'show.I', 'recommend', 'must-have', 'die', 'fan', 'show']",Beverly Hills 90210 - The First Season [DVD]

169762,A1PASRZ81DY9C,1415717214,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","I never watched the show when it aired, but the reruns caught my attention years ago. I enjoyed the episodes, and they were compelling. Recently, I decided to pick up the DVDs of Season One, and I've enjoyed the show once again. Again, the acting is impressive given what they had to work with. It's much better than anything that's on television the past decade. I wanted to make a commentary of some of the episodes. First thing I noticed is how many characters appear in one episode and then be never seen again. Having said that, notice how Brandon Walsh averages a woman per show. He is also a cheat, liar, racist, and drunk driver who could have killed somebody. He is easily pissed off and starts taking somebody's head out if slightly provoked. He acts like a saint with a conscience yet he is the biggest hypocrite I've seen on the show. At this point, I have a hard time debating who is worse: him or Brenda. She seems to have the flair of being so melodramatic, no matter the situation. She tries to take advantage of every opportunity to make the parents to feel worse by creating useless spats. I actually feel sorry for the parents, and I question their ever flowing leniency. On the other hand, I liked the rest of the characters, and they seem to be fine to me, even if they have innocuous glaring faults except for Steve Sanders. One episode ""One on One,"" Brandon makes the basketball team yet we never see him playing basketball ever again in the rest of the season. Another episode where Brandon discovers how lowly paid the third world workers are, and he decides to write a report on the owner of the caf&eacute;. So what happened? Really...I am still amazed how the other characters suddenly get dropped out like flies after showing up for one episode. I was thinking also where were the friends of Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Steve because it's impossible that, given their popularity in school, they were friendless before the Walshes moved in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, I liked the issues such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity. I know there is a lot of morality problem with the show while the characters delve themselves in the immoralities of life and still think they lead a life of morals. It's a tricky thing; however, the show is watchable regardless. That's why I enjoy it. For the DVD, it has been good, and letting you know, the pilot episodes are actually contained in the Season One package. That means you don't need to buy a separate DVD of the pilot show.",5,Great show.

Fans of the Aaron Spelling produced drama have been waiting for the show to arrive on DVD for years. Finally, the shows first season is available on DVD.Beverly Hills 90210 premiered on the Fox network in the fall of 1990. The show was a breakout success with teens all around the world and really was one of the first huge one hour hits for the network.The season begins with parts 1 and 2 of the show's pilot. It's really neat seeing just how young all of the cast members look. In the early scenes of the pilot we are introduced to Brenda and Dylan Walsh. They have just moved to California after living in the Midwest, Minnesota to be exact. Brenda and Dylan roll up to school on their first day in their old car and are amazed at all of the luxury cars in the school parking lot and Brenda utters the classic line, ""We're going to need a bigger allowance.""The majority of the major cast members are introduced in the pilot. Brenda quickly becomes friends with Kelly whom she meets in chemistry class. Brandon meets Steve in Spanish class, a class he shares with Andrea Zuckerman. He later meets her again when he goes attempts to join the school paper. David, who is a freshman, is scene hanging around campus with his young friend. They make plans to crash a no freshman party. We learn during part 1 of the pilot that Steve and Kelly used to be an item. Kelly's nose job over the summer is also the talk of the town. David also finds out that Steve's mother is a famous actress.It's the second episode of the season when show favorite Dylan McKay is introduced. He and Brandon hit it off and Brandon soon sees a side of the ""bad boy of West Beverly High,"" that most people don't see.Season one highlights include Brenda's run in with the law after a friend shoplifts, Brenda's budding relationship with Dylan, Brandon's struggle with cheating, and the many adventures the Walsh twins face during their first year at West Beverly High.The Beverly Hills 90210 DVD box set includes 21 season one episodes and the 2 part show pilot. The music has been changed for the DVD presentation of the show but the show's theme song is in tact.Special features include-Show commentary by Darren Star on select episodes-""Beginnings With Darren Star"" Featurette-""Meet The Class of West Beverly High""90210 Behind The Scenes Featurette-Looking Back Season one-The Recap",5,Very Pleased With 90210 Season One DVD,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2441,"['Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'teen', 'drama', 'television', 'history', 'Fans', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'produced', 'drama', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'show', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'years', 'Finally', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'available', 'DVD.Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'premiered', 'Fox', 'network', 'fall', '1990', 'show', 'was', 'breakout', 'success', 'teens', 'world', 'really', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'huge', 'one', 'hour', 'hits', 'network.The', 'season', 'parts', '1', '2', 'show', 'pilot', 'really', 'neat', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'young', 'cast', 'members', 'look', 'early', 'scenes', 'pilot', 'are', 'introduced', 'Brenda', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'California', 'living', 'Midwest', 'Minnesota', 'be', 'exact', 'Brenda', 'Dylan', 'roll', 'up', 'school', 'first', 'day', 'old', 'car', 'are', 'amazed', 'luxury', 'cars', 'school', 'parking', 'lot', 'Brenda', 'classic', 'line', ""'re"", 'going', 'need', 'bigger', 'allowance', 'majority', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'introduced', 'pilot', 'Brenda', 'quickly', 'friends', 'Kelly', 'whom', 'chemistry', 'class', 'Brandon', 'meets', 'Steve', 'Spanish', 'class', 'class', 'shares', 'Andrea', 'Zuckerman', 'later', 'again', 'when', 'attempts', 'join', 'school', 'paper', 'David', 'who', 'freshman', 'scene', 'hanging', 'campus', 'young', 'friend', 'make', 'plans', 'crash', 'freshman', 'party', 'learn', 'part', '1', 'pilot', 'Steve', 'Kelly', 'used', 'be', 'item', 'Kelly', 'nose', 'job', 'summer', 'also', 'talk', 'town', 'David', 'also', 'out', 'Steve', 'mother', 'famous', 'actress.It', 'second', 'episode', 'season', 'when', 'show', 'favorite', 'Dylan', 'McKay', 'introduced', 'Brandon', 'hit', 'off', 'Brandon', 'soon', 'side', 'bad', 'boy', 'West', 'Beverly', 'High', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'see.Season', 'one', 'highlights', 'include', 'Brenda', 'run', 'law', 'friend', 'shoplifts', 'Brenda', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Dylan', 'Brandon', 'struggle', 'cheating', 'many', 'Walsh', 'face', 'first', 'year', 'West', 'Beverly', 'High.The', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', '21', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', '2', 'part', 'show', 'pilot', 'music', 'been', 'changed', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'show', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'tact.Special', 'features', 'include-Show', 'commentary', 'Darren', 'Star', 'select', 'episodes-', 'Beginnings', 'Darren', 'Star', 'Featurette-', 'Meet', 'Class', 'West', 'Beverly', 'High', '90210', 'Scenes', 'Featurette-Looking', 'Back', 'Season', 'one-The', 'Recap']",Beverly Hills 90210 - The First Season [DVD]

169779,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,1415717214,Geneva,"[1, 1]","Although I was too young to watch 90210 when it originally aired, I began watching it soon after it ended, and have since been watching the re-runs on TV throughout the years (mainly on SOAPnet) and it has easily become one of my favorite shows, especially Shannen Doherty (one of my favorite actresses) was a main character (aka Brenda Walsh) during the first four seasons. Anyway, I'm very greatful that this season, along with seasons 1-5 (soon to be 6 also) have been released, and hopefully seasons 7-10 will soon follow. And yes, it is disappointing that music has been changed, and scenes have been cut, but I'm still have to be able to own this show on DVD (after all, I can watch the original versions on TV, but with the DVDs, ill be able to watch my favorite episodes anytime I want!)Although some of the earlier seasons have a lot of episodes that may be considered tacky and laughable nowadays (especially season 1, seeing as how it started in 1990!) I love them because like I said, they feature Shannen Doherty, and during season 1 you get to see her characters relationship with Dylan Mckay, played by Luke Perry (in my opinion, they will always be one of the cutest TV couples ever!)Now I'm sure for the most part, a majority of you have heard of ""90210"" and have atleast seen an episode or two (after all, the show was on for 10 years!) but here's a brief summary of season 1, just in case:The long-running series begins with the arrival of the Walsh family (brenda, Brandon, and their two parents, Jim and Cindy), who move from Minnesota to Beverly Hills. Brenda (played by Shannen Doherty) and her twin brother, Brandon (played by Jason Priestley) have different ways of adjusting to their new home. Brenda quickly befriends Kelly Taylor, the most popular girl in school, and begins to feel the pressures that come along with running in such a social circle (in the early episodes she gets a fake ID, sneaks into a club where she meets an older guy and lies to him about her age, and even plans on losing her virginity to him until he finds out her true age) meanwhile, Brandon has a harder time fitting in, until he befriends Steve Sanders (the most popular guy in school) joins the school newspaper, run by Andrea Zuckermann (aka the school-nerd, played by Gabrielle Carteris) and becomes friends with a cute, mysterious loner named Dylan Mckay (played by Luke Perry, who eventually becomes Brendas boyfriend and first love) also among the cast? Donna Martin (played by Tori Spelling) who is a friend of Kelly's, and David Silver (played by Brian Austin Green) a geeky freshman who is desperate to be popular (he eventually becomes part of the infamous 90210 gang) and crashes Steve Sanders car in the pilot episode when Steve drunkenly insists that he drive his car home for him.During this season, you'll see how Brenda and Brandon adjust to life in Beverly Hills, Brendas new popular girl status, find out that Kelly Taylor isn't as perfect and problem free as people perceive her to be, how Brandon and Dylan become friends...etc...and best of all: how Dylan and Brenda meet, and the beginning of their two-year relationship (I never grow tired of watching the ""spring fling"" episode, in which Brenda loses her virginity to him!)The thing I love most about this show is the great chemistry that all the actors have together (which you'll continue to see grow as the show progresses)So if you still have not watched this show, what are you waiting for?!",5,one of my favorite shows of all time,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,3478,"['was', 'too', 'young', 'watch', '90210', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'began', 'watching', 'soon', 'ended', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 're-runs', 'TV', 'years', 'mainly', 'SOAPnet', 'easily', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'especially', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'aka', 'Brenda', 'Walsh', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'very', 'greatful', 'season', 'seasons', '1-5', 'soon', 'be', '6', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'hopefully', 'seasons', '7-10', 'will', 'soon', 'follow', 'yes', 'disappointing', 'music', 'been', 'changed', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', ""'m"", 'still', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'own', 'show', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'original', 'versions', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'ill', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'anytime', 'want', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'have', 'lot', 'episodes', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'tacky', 'laughable', 'nowadays', 'especially', 'season', '1', 'seeing', 'how', 'started', '1990', 'love', 'said', 'feature', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'season', '1', 'get', 'see', 'characters', 'relationship', 'Dylan', 'Mckay', 'played', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'opinion', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'cutest', 'TV', 'couples', 'ever', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'part', 'majority', 'have', 'heard', '90210', 'have', 'atleast', 'seen', 'episode', 'two', 'show', 'was', '10', 'years', 'here', 'brief', 'summary', 'season', '1', 'just', 'case', 'long-running', 'series', 'arrival', 'Walsh', 'family', 'brenda', 'Brandon', 'two', 'parents', 'Jim', 'Cindy', 'who', 'move', 'Minnesota', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Brenda', 'played', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'twin', 'brother', 'Brandon', 'played', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'have', 'different', 'ways', 'adjusting', 'new', 'home', 'Brenda', 'quickly', 'Kelly', 'Taylor', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'feel', 'pressures', 'come', 'running', 'such', 'social', 'circle', 'early', 'episodes', 'fake', 'ID', 'club', 'where', 'older', 'guy', 'age', 'even', 'plans', 'losing', 'virginity', 'out', 'true', 'age', 'meanwhile', 'Brandon', 'harder', 'time', 'fitting', 'Steve', 'Sanders', 'most', 'popular', 'guy', 'school', 'school', 'newspaper', 'run', 'Andrea', 'Zuckermann', 'school-nerd', 'played', 'Gabrielle', 'Carteris', 'friends', 'cute', 'mysterious', 'loner', 'named', 'Dylan', 'Mckay', 'played', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'who', 'eventually', 'Brendas', 'boyfriend', 'first', 'love', 'also', 'cast', 'Donna', 'Martin', 'played', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'who', 'friend', 'Kelly', 'David', 'Silver', 'played', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'geeky', 'freshman', 'who', 'desperate', 'be', 'popular', 'eventually', 'part', 'infamous', '90210', 'gang', 'crashes', 'Steve', 'Sanders', 'car', 'pilot', 'episode', 'when', 'Steve', 'drunkenly', 'drive', 'car', 'home', 'him.During', 'season', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'Brenda', 'Brandon', 'adjust', 'life', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Brendas', 'new', 'popular', 'girl', 'status', 'find', 'out', 'Kelly', 'Taylor', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'problem', 'free', 'people', 'perceive', 'be', 'how', 'Brandon', 'Dylan', 'become', 'friends', 'etc', 'best', 'how', 'Dylan', 'Brenda', 'meet', 'beginning', 'two-year', 'relationship', 'never', 'grow', 'tired', 'watching', 'spring', 'fling', 'episode', 'Brenda', 'virginity', 'thing', 'love', 'most', 'show', 'great', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'have', 'together', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'see', 'grow', 'show', 'So', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'show', 'what', 'are', 'waiting']",Beverly Hills 90210 - The First Season [DVD]

169784,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,1415717214,JGC,"[8, 10]","I was insanely crazy about ""90210."" This was my all-time favorite show as a tween. Because ""90210"" really was the very first American TV show that actually spoke to kids and had real issues that everyone could relate to. During the first season we got to meet the entire gang...Most of the eps either revolved around Brandon (Jason Priestely,) or someone else in the Walsh House. Didn't it almost seem like Brandon had a new girl every other week? Cindy (Carol Potter) and Jim Walsh (James Eckhouse) were such cool parents. I often wished that my parents were as understanding as they were, especially Mrs. Walsh. (I suppose that's what TV writers do best; make the parents look perfect?) As a kid, my favorite character was always Brenda Walsh (played by none other than the original Britney Spears ~ Shannen Doherty.) Brenda was always so forthright and honest about her feelings. Some fans have even said that Brenda was ""mean."" I tend to disagree. I think she was just a girl who knew exactly what she wanted and wasn't afraid to say it. But as an adult, watching this set, I have an entirely new fondness for Brandon. He was such a kind-hearted young man, and always so willing to go out of his way for others and help any way he could. Brandon was a total mensch. And wasn't he so cute, too? I loved when he smiled because he had the most adorable dimples.Throughout the very beginning of season 1, Kelly Taylor (Jenny Garth) and Donna Martin (Tori Spelling, of course) were portrayed as brain-dead snobs. Donna, especially, came off as such a superficial air-head. But after you scratched the surface a little and got to know them you saw a couple of very sweet girls who were really no different from any other American teenagers.I always enjoyed Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) and Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering.) Dylan was the quiet loner who was often the voice of reason. He's a lot likeJake Hanson. Like Donna and Kelly, at first Steve came off as very superficial and incredibly spoiled. But once I got to know him I saw a very sensitive young man. I love the ep during season 1, when Steve's Corvette was stolen by those 2 girls and he starts crying and Brandon tries to make him feel better.Rounding out the cast were the 3 egg-heads, Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris,) David Silver (Brian Green, FKA Brian Austin Green) and the rarely-seen Scott Scanlon (Douglas Emerson.) Out of these 3, Andrea was the only one who was welcomed into the gang during season 1. I was never crazy about her though because she always seemed so needy and a touch on the greedy side. Andrea had somewhat of a chip on her shoulder because she was poor and the rest of the kids weren't. Over the years, David did get cool, but in season 1 he was just a lowly freshman that no one else wanted to hang around with. Except for his bff, Scott.Here's all the eps from season one:Class of Beverly HillsThe Walsh's get used to life in Beverly Hills. In syndication, this ep airs in 2 parts. Note: the original title of the series was ""Class Beverly Hills.""The Green RoomBrandon meets a new girl at the beach. Note: this is the first ep with Dylan.Every Dream Has Its Price (Tag)Brenda doesn't feel like one of the girls while shopping with them.The First TimeSheryl, Brandon's girlfriend comes for a visit and stays overnight with him. See what I mean about having cool parents?One on OneBrandon and Andrea think there is a conspiracy among school officials when they see a student who doesn't appear to be a resident of Beverly Hills.Higher EducationBrandon's American History teacher grades the class by an unreasonable curve.Perfect MomBrenda really likes Kelly's mom, Jackie (Ann Gillespie.) But she thinks differently of her when it's revealed that Jackie's just a negligent addict.The 17-Year ItchMr. and Mrs. Walsh celebrate their 17th wedding anniversary.The Gentle Art of ListeningBrenda and Andrea volunteer at a teen crisis hotline. The girls both try to help a student when it is revealed that she is getting r-a-p-e-d by some of the football team.Isn't It Romantic?Brenda catches Dylan taking a shower in her bathroom. Did I say how cool Jim and Cindy are?B.Y.O.B.Brandon and Brenda have a party when their parents are away and poor Brandon gets arrested for drunk driving.One Man and a BabyBrandon befriends Melissa, a senior with a baby boy who has dreams of going to college.Slumber PartyThis is one of my very favorite eps! The girls have a slumber party. Kelly brings along this total b itch, Amanda (Michele Abrams.) I love it when Bren says to her, ""you've been acting like a total b itch since you got here."" David and Scott swing by the Walsh home to spy on the girls. Steve and Brandon have a hot evening with a couple of chicks; that is, until Steve's Vette is stolen.East Side StoryJim and Cindy allow their maid's friend, Carla to use their address so she can attend West Beverly. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. And Brandon (the little detective that he always was, in season 1,) sets out to find out the truth about Carla.A Fling in Palm SpringsEveryone except for Brandon and Andrea goes to Palm Springs. Dylan and Brenda get in a big fight.Fame Is Where You Find ItBrandon gets a part on a popular TV show. He even starts dating the star of the show, Lydia Leeds (Marcy Kaplan.)Stand (Up) and DeliverThis is another favorite of mine. Brandon decides to run for class president with Andrea as his campaign advisor. Things get out of hand when Kelly Taylor takes over. Meanwhile, Bren housesits for an older friend and learns that being on her own may not be all it's cracked up to be.It's Only a TestThe gang takes their S.A.T.'s. Brenda finds a lump in her chest.April Is the Cruelest MonthBrandon interviews Roger (Matthew Perry,) an all-star student, for the school paper and learns some troubling details about him.Spring TrainingThis is another favorite of mine because it shows how sweet Bran was. He coaches a Beverly Hills peewee baseball team and learns how competitive and stuck-up some of the parents can be.Spring DanceThe gang all go to ""The Spring Fling"" and Kelly becomes ""Spring Princess."" Meanwhile, Bren and Dylan slip off to a hotel room.Home AgainThe Walsh's may have to go back to MN because Jim is faced with a transfer. Andrea decides to sleep with Brandon as a going away gift. Everything seems to be back to normal when Jim decides not to move back. But at their party at The Pit, Bren reveals to Dylan that she missed her period!""90210"" was on for 10 years, and like many fans, I stopped watching way before that. Unfortunately, after Shannen Doherty left the series it was nowhere near as entertaining. (It's almost like what happened toThree's Companyafter Suzanne Somers was fired.) Because it just wasn't the same without Brenda. Should they have kept Shannen? Many of the cast members have stated that she was incredibly difficult to work with. Shannen was also famous for starting viscous cat-fights with the other girls on the show. She absolutely despised Gabrielle Carteris with a passion and would verbally berate her any chance she got. I think it was Ian Ziering who went on Arsenio (right around the time she was fired) and had a few choice words to say about her. The show still went on for 6 seasons without Shannen (I think I stopped watching by end of season 6/beginning of season 7) but it was never the same. And, none of the seasons were as captivating or groundbreaking as season 1 always was!Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break onFather Murphy, playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that isLittle House on the Prairie. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in theLittle House TV movieseven after the series was canceled!In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic,Girls Just Want to Have Fun. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other thanHeathers!In ""Heathers"" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that ""Heathers"" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titledClass Beverly HillsA year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called90210. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on ""90210"" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, ""90210"" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of ""90210"" Shannen became a bona fide star!Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to ""90210,"" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made ""90210"" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a ""90210"" spin-off in the summer of '92;Melrose Place! And less than two years later, ""90210"" which begat ""Melrose,"" begat ""Models!"" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, ""ask me if I care!""Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled ""Blindfold."" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving ""90210!"" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of 90210 aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, ""A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story"" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a ""misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!""The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, ""Mallrats,"" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: ""Gone in the Night,"" ""Friends 'Til the End,"" ""Ticket"" and ""Nowhere."" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, ""Charmed."" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!Unlike ""90210,"" ""Charmed"" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!The producers of ""90210"" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the ""90210"" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)After leaving ""Charmed,"" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, ""Scare Tactics."" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: ""View of Terror,"" ""Another Day"" and ""Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.""In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, ""Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty."" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' ""View"" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, ""this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!"" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, ""Defuct."" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped ""Kiss Me Deadly;"" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!",5,the hottest number on TV,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,15206,"['was', 'insanely', 'crazy', '90210', 'was', 'all-time',

I watched the pilot and got hooked! The show has its lame moments, it is dated, but it is still fun to watch!!! My favorite characters are Brenda and Brandon Walsh. The Walsh family is likeable and realistic. The show isn't as dramatic as it became. Rather, each episode presents a different situation a teen might be dealing with. From addict parents to alcohol, shoplifting to abuse, as well as some more lighthearted moments, like the episode where Brenda cares for a stray dog and Brandon coaches a snotty little league team. Some younger viewers might find the show dated and irrelevant, but for the last of the ""Gen Xers"", this show is perfect.The music, fashions, and lingo will take you back to your 1990-1991 schoolyear.

This classic cult series revolves around the 16-year-old Walsh twins, Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda (Shannen Doherty), who undergo massive culture shock when their family relocates from Minnesota to sunny Beverly Hills, California. Brandon and Brenda adjust to their new lives pretty quickly, with the help of new friends Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth), Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), Donna Martin (Tori Spelling), Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris), and of course the James Dean-esque Dylan McKay (Luke Perry). Season 1 contains some of the show's most famous episodes, including Brenda's experience manning the teen hotline, Kelly's mother's first rehab stint,and of course Brandon's DUI.

Everybody slept with everyone ad nauseum and, like interchangeable parts in a car, cast members who left the series were replaced by clones with even less acting talent and depth than their predecessors. And, of course, every two years or so FOX trotted out its latest tribute to 90210 where the cast members, production staff, and writers waxed poetic about what a milestone the series was, how it broke new ground, how wonderful they all were, blah, blah, blah, blah -- nauseating self-congratulations for a show truly about nothing (my apologies to Seinfeld fans).

I knew that the original music would be gone and i was mad about that but I got them anyway...not knowing that the music was the least of the problems.  These DVDs are missing parts of scenes.  I think that its criminal for paramount to sell them this way.  I know this because I have all of the episodes recorded on tape and I compared them scene for scene.  The DVDs are totally incomplete.  I will never buy another season.  Some of the episodes are missing scenes that help make the whole show to make sense.  These dvds make me not want to buy any show on DVD ever again.

Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[1, 3]","I have to agree with everyone else here in saying that I was really looking forward to finally getting Beverly Hills 90210 the complete first season on dvd!!! Although Shannen Doherty left the show on a sour note, she was definately the breakout star during her reign as Brenda Walsh!!! I had forgotten how fantastic the first season was, considering I had'nt seen this show in many years, not even the butchered re-runs. Why bother when tv shows on dvd rule!!!I decided to make my purchase in the store on the day of release, considering it came with the show's soundtrack and a five dollar gift card!!! My only complaint is the replaced music because the music sounds so generic. Perhaps I would'nt be so disappointed if I could truly understand why the studios have such difficulty in securing the rights of the original music. I suppose that's the hold up in releasing The Wonder Years on dvd. Thank goodness Universal released Miami Vice with it's original music, because Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight go hand in hand with Crockett and Tubbs riding in that awesome car on the open road!!!Fortunately, the music from Beverly Hills 90210 was'nt that essential  and I'm just glad it finally got released on dvd, considering so many trash tv shows get released alot faster???",5,"BRENDA & DYLAN FOREVER!!!!
