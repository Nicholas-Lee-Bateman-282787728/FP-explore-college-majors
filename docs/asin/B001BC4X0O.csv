As part of his conversion, he helps a girl he has wronged a number of times get back in shape for her tennis match.  It is all very pleasant.  And I have to say, I think one of the biggest assets of this company's movies is that they are clean and religious, but not preachy.  They do seem to be inbreeding some of their actors.  But other than that, I really don't see any flaws.  The acting is just a tad bit amateurish, but not to the point of being bothersome.
