298383,A141INO5311NA,6302156815,Cas,"[0, 0]","Back in the 90s, Sylvester Stallone made a few forays into comedy and thereby demonstrated that he actually has incredibly good comic timing. &#34;Oscar&#34; is one of those comedies, and it is not only one of his very best movies but also one of the best ensemble comedies I've ever seen.Stallone plays Angelo &#34;Snaps&#34; Provolone, an incredibly wealthy 1920s-era bootlegger and gangster who promises his dying father (played in a brief cameo by Kirk Douglas!) that he will go straight--he'll give up crime and begin a new life as an honest man. Accordingly, he sets up an appointment with some bankers to discuss his new life as an investor with them. But there will be a few hiccups on that road to honest living, starting with some secrets his handsome young accountant (brilliantly played by Vincent Spano), imperious Irish maid Nora, and spoiled-brat poor-little-rich-girl daughter all need to tell him right now, and all the while, the cops are spying on him so they can get enough dirt on him to arrest him.The central conceit to the movie is a switcheroo routine with a couple of valises, and I cringe whenever that's onscreen, but the rest of the movie is hilarious and fun to watch thanks to a talented cast that works stupendously well together. Snaps' wife, Sofia, is played with deadly intensity by Ornella Muti; her voice ranges from delicately feminine to thunderously matriarchal at the drop of a hat, and it's very clear she's lost not a single bit of her allure since her dangerous princess days from &#34;Flash Gordon.&#34; Tim Curry plays a speech therapist/coach who gets drawn into the family's drama-of-the-day; his cheerful, reserved professor is very clearly out of his element entirely when confronted with Snaps' wily daughter (played by Marisa Tomei, obviously enjoying the heck out of herself). Peter Riegert plays a pitch-perfect second-in-command and straight man running a household of crooks and thieves (including Chazz Palminteri as a dense-as-an-ox goon). Martin Ferrero and Harry Shearer show up as a pair of high-end tailors and Don Ameche sails in a couple of times as a bewildered priest. William Atherton plays his usual stuffy, snobby cad as the head of the bankers.With several subplots and a constantly-changing-hands maguffin shell game going on, it's a chaotic, frenetic movie with a lot to pay attention to, the sort of movie that'll surprise you with new things upon every re-watching. But without Stallone's talent to pull them all together, it would be excruciating. As it is, he handles his role with aplomb--he's fascinating to watch as he navigates the trials of the most stressful day of his life.I recommend this movie wholeheartedly. With no offensive elements (beyond the stereotyping of Italian-Americans), no sex, no violence, and only the barest hints of scandal, this is one the entire family can enjoy.",5,One of Stallone's very best movies.,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2870,"['Back', '90s', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'made', 'few', 'forays', 'comedy', 'thereby', 'demonstrated', 'actually', 'incredibly', 'good', 'comic', 'timing', '34', 'Oscar', '34', 'one', 'comedies', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'movies', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Stallone', 'plays', 'Angelo', '34', 'Snaps', '34', 'Provolone', 'incredibly', 'wealthy', '1920s-era', 'bootlegger', 'gangster', 'who', 'dying', 'father', 'played', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'will', 'go', 'straight', ""'ll"", 'give', 'up', 'crime', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'honest', 'man', 'Accordingly', 'up', 'appointment', 'bankers', 'discuss', 'new', 'life', 'investor', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'hiccups', 'road', 'honest', 'living', 'starting', 'secrets', 'handsome', 'young', 'accountant', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Spano', 'imperious', 'Irish', 'maid', 'Nora', 'spoiled-brat', 'poor-little-rich-girl', 'daughter', 'need', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'while', 'cops', 'are', 'spying', 'can', 'get', 'enough', 'dirt', 'arrest', 'him.The', 'central', 'conceit', 'movie', 'switcheroo', 'routine', 'couple', 'valises', 'cringe', 'whenever', 'onscreen', 'rest', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'fun', 'watch', 'thanks', 'talented', 'cast', 'stupendously', 'well', 'together', 'Snaps', 'wife', 'Sofia', 'played', 'deadly', 'intensity', 'Ornella', 'Muti', 'voice', 'delicately', 'feminine', 'thunderously', 'matriarchal', 'drop', 'hat', 'very', 'clear', 'lost', 'not', 'single', 'bit', 'allure', 'dangerous', 'princess', 'days', '34', 'Flash', 'Gordon.', '34', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'speech', 'therapist/coach', 'who', 'drawn', 'family', 'drama-of-the-day', 'cheerful', 'reserved', 'professor', 'very', 'clearly', 'element', 'entirely', 'when', 'confronted', 'Snaps', 'wily', 'daughter', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'obviously', 'enjoying', 'heck', 'herself', 'Peter', 'Riegert', 'pitch-perfect', 'second-in-command', 'straight', 'man', 'running', 'household', 'crooks', 'thieves', 'including', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'dense-as-an-ox', 'goon', 'Martin', 'Ferrero', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'show', 'up', 'pair', 'high-end', 'tailors', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'couple', 'times', 'bewildered', 'priest', 'William', 'Atherton', 'usual', 'stuffy', 'snobby', 'cad', 'head', 'bankers.With', 'several', 'subplots', 'constantly-changing-hands', 'maguffin', 'shell', 'game', 'going', 'chaotic', 'frenetic', 'movie', 'lot', 'pay', 'attention', 'sort', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'surprise', 'new', 'things', 're-watching', 'Stallone', 'talent', 'pull', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'excruciating', 'role', 'aplomb', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'trials', 'most', 'stressful', 'day', 'life.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'offensive', 'elements', 'stereotyping', 'Italian-Americans', 'sex', 'violence', 'only', 'barest', 'hints', 'scandal', 'one', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy']",Oscar VHS

298386,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302156815,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","I remember seeing ""Oscar"" when it was in the theatres in 1991.  The critics heaved a collective yawn.  When I saw it there was a group of mentally challenged people in the audience laughing hysterically throughout.  I was laughing along with them.  Why has this terrific film fallen into relative obscurity?  My guess is that people don't normally associate the action oriented Sylvester Stallone in a broad comic vehicle.  But if one follows the trajectory of his career this is not the first time that Stallone has extended himself into the comic realm.  No, I'm not talking about ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"" which I haven't seen but was heaped with almost universal disdain, fair or unfair.  In 1978 Stallone adapted his serio-comic novel ""Paradise Alley"" to the big screen and I thought it was a terrifically offbeat film.  ""Oscar"", however, is a collaborative effort between star and director.  John Landis is trying to evoke the breathlessness of classic screwball comedy of Hawks, Sturgis, and Wilder and it works to a tee.  The film is replete with mistaken identities, switched bags, and slamming doors and in lesser hands would be cliched but it works here to a tee.  Stallone is in perfect synch with his director and his gangster attempting to go legitimate, Angelo ""Snaps"" Provolone, anchors the film's breakneck pace.  The film also has a great ensemble cast notably Marisa Tomei, in an early part, as Snaps' randy daughter and Tim Curry as Snaps' elocutionist.  I think the greatest compliment you can pay a film is that some part of it stays in your subconscious.  There's a throwaway line Snaps' henchman Aldo (Peter Riegert) says to a German chauffeur that became part of my everyday vernacular.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Okay, I do think that Sly has managed to produce two fairly good comedies in his career (and we'll just ignore the mind-numbingly disastrous STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT, shall we?). Surprisingly, I enjoyedRhinestonefor Sly's fish-out-of-water turn as a country singer-in-training. And the gangster farce OSCAR is actually one of my favorite Stallone flicks. I don't know how many folks have heard of OSCAR (I'm betting, not many), but it sure slipped way under the radar when it came out back in '91. I'm thinking people were probably turned off because it featured Sly in something other than the expected action adventure genre. Well, people missed out, because OSCAR is hilarious.OSCAR is based on the 1967 French comedy classic of the same name, that one starring the brilliant Louis de Funes. Check that one out, too, if you get the chance. But, in this American version, the year is 1931, deep in the days of the Depression and Prohibition, and Chicago mobster Angelo ""Snaps"" Provolone is about to mend his ways (he'd promised on his father's deathbed). OSCAR takes place mostly in Snaps's opulent mansion and covers one very chaotic morning in Snaps's life. This is the day when Snaps officially goes straight, you see, as he's about to smoothly transition into the banking business. But, to follow in the screwball comedy tradition, it just ain't that easy. Not when he has to face a thieving accountant (his own), a pregnant daughter (who's not pregnant), another girl passing herself off as his daughter, confused henchmen, bewildered FBI agents, lost loves, and three frustrating black bags who seemingly have minds of their own. Man, some days, it's just really hard to quit the thuggery business...Note: For the curious, by the way, Oscar is the name of the much absent chauffer who used to work for Snaps. He's not much in the movie.The secret, I think, is that OSCAR doesn't put too much pressure on Stallone to carry the entire load. The bit characters are wonderful and are allowed many opportunities to grab the spotlight comedically. Too many supporting actors to mention, but stand-outs are Peter Riegert and Chazz Palminteri, who simply kill it as Sly's henchmen, Tim Curry as the Henry Higgins-like elocution guru, and Harry Shearer and Martin Ferrero as the meek Finucci Brothers. Stallone is pretty much relegated to a straight man role, although he does induce a share of the laughs. Sly is often times caught in reaction mode as the much put-upon master of his domain, so there's plenty of that thing at which John Wayne used to excel later in his career, which is delivering those martyred slow burns and blustery double takes. Early in the film, on the verge of hearing some unpleasant news, Snaps Provolone mutters: ""This doesn't bode well."" Thankfully, for us, the reformed hoodlum was right.There's a lot going on in this film, plot wise; you do have to keep your eyeballs stuck on the screen, or you're bound to miss a curve or a gag. OSCAR tries for that 1930s screwball type of rhythm and nuttiness, and mostly achieves it (Riegert is particularly good with his lines). Also lending to that feel are the Damon Runyonesque names which pop up (Snaps Provolone, Johnny Elbows, Louis ""the Lug"" McGurk, etc.). The movie feels a bit like a busy stage play in the sense that most of the scenes take place in Snaps' digs, with lots of doors opening and closing and the harried Stallone going up and down the stairs, and giving the illusion of constantly being in motion.Really, give this one a try. I think you'll like it and you'll laugh quite a bit.

You even feel quite exhausted after it's all said and done since there's so much going on.  This has always been a favorite of mine, and I'm glad to see that it has finally found its way on DVD.I'm going to be very brief when going over the storyline.  The great thing about the movie is being surprised minute by minute.  The basic story is about ""Snaps"" Provolone, a powerful Chicago gangster that is feared by many.  However, Snaps is about to go straight because he promised his dying father on his deathbed that he would go legit.  However, it's not going to be easy.  In only 24 hours of trying to be straight, everything goes straight  to hell, and everything that could go wrong does.  And that's when all of the fun begins.This is a terrific comedy that can be enjoyed by just about everyone.  It's only PG, so it's something that even the whole family can enjoy.  Sylvester Stallone can really be a card and is hilarious when given the right opportunity.  His facial expressions and outbursts are truly unforgettable.  And there's so many great people in this out-of-control loony bin (many that you'll recognize in a heart-beat).The movie has a lot of brains too.  For a comedy it is extremely complex and well-thought out.  John Landis does a terrific job of directing this movie.  The screenplay is brilliantly funny and very surprising with every step.  You'll find yourself repeating many of the lines as you watch this over and over again.The DVD really doesn't have much to offer, but for a movie like this there's really no need to have a lot of special features (it would've been nice to have SOME though!).  There's not even a theatrical trailer, so be warned.  The picture and sound quality is pretty good (nice to see that it's enhanced for 16x9 TVs).  So, it could've been a better DVD, but in all honesty I'm just glad to see that it is finally on DVD.""Oscar"" is an outstanding comedy that proves that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time.  Bring the family and enjoy the chaos that happens in this crazy circus of gangsters, not-so-smart hit-men, crooked accountants, snobbish bankers, frustrated cops, confused priests, and more.

The styles ofclothes, the automobiles, the store fronts, the buildings, themannerisms  of people... all that is there to convince the publicthey are witnessing those times.

Based on the box office receipts, I guess the answer is a resounding 'no.'  Has that status changed in the decade-and-a-half since the film's theatrical release?  Based on the majority of reviews found here, I'd say the answer is an emphatic 'yes!'Look, my loyal pee-pees, the sad truth is that when Sly turned to comedy in the early-90s, he was looked at as wanting to expand his fanbase the way Arnold did in the late-80s beginning with the movie ""Twins.""  People forget that Sly was in a very funny comedy called ""Rhinestone"" way back in 1984.  Comedy was nothing new to him.  ""Oscar"" was a broad farce, well directed by John Landis.  It features a great ensemble cast.  Sly is often sort of a straight man to the much more colorful supporting characters, but it needs to be pointed out that he carries the movie with a light, effective comic touch.

Landis shrewdly sets his satire in the Depression period to provide for the same kind of contrast between rich and poor that he showcased in ""Trading Places"", when Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche wagered to see what will happen when poor African American Eddie Murphy is allowed into their world to make business decisions.In ""Oscar"" the story begins in a scene where Don Ameche appears again, but this time as family priest saying the last rites for syndicate tycoon Kirk Douglas.  Former Universal siren Yvonne De Carlo is also in the scene, which provides an interesting opening to the film as Douglas implores son Sylvester Stallone to get out of the crime business and go legitimate, slapping him several times in a robust closing act to dramatically make his point.When Douglas passes on loyal son Stallone, despite misgivings, agrees to give up his criminal enterprise.  When an important meeting is scheduled with bankers we see a hilarious study in contrasts as Stallone's old hoods have great difficulty shaking their old personas and behaving like gentlemen.While Stallone encounters problems enough with the transition to business executive his accountant tells him he wants a raise because he is in love and wants to marry Stallone's daughter.  Stallone becomes enraged and states that the fianc&eacute;e in question is not actually his daughter.  Meanwhile his own daughter that he acknowledges, who wants to move out from under the suffocating enclosure of the family mansion under her father's constant thumb, begins making marriage noises of his own.Stallone is forced to constantly shift gears, all the while bemoaning that his concentration is being disrupted on the day of his important meeting with leading bankers who will  propel him out of the crime field.  When the identity shifts and strategic jockeying reaches a crescendo it reminds one of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello's ""Whose on First?"" routine.Eventually former Stallone mansion domestic Linda Gray of ""Dallas"" television fame surfaces.  She makes a startling announcement near the film's conclusion that clears up identity problems in a manner that shocks Stallone.",4,Landis Scores With Another Spoof,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,2334,"['John', 'Landis', 'scored', 'big', 'spoof', 'high', 'finance', 'Trading', 'Places', 'similar', 'terrain', 'Oscar', 'only', 'time', 'big', 'money', 'was', 'made', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'field', 'Landis', 'shrewdly', 'satire', 'Depression', 'period', 'provide', 'same', 'kind', 'contrast', 'rich', 'poor', 'showcased', 'Trading', 'Places', 'when', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'wagered', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'poor', 'African', 'American', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'allowed', 'world', 'make', 'business', 'decisions.In', 'Oscar', 'story', 'scene', 'where', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'again', 'time', 'family', 'saying', 'last', 'rites', 'syndicate', 'tycoon', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Former', 'Universal', 'siren', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'also', 'scene', 'interesting', 'opening', 'film', 'Douglas', 'son', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'get', 'crime', 'business', 'go', 'legitimate', 'slapping', 'several', 'times', 'robust', 'closing', 'act', 'dramatically', 'make', 'point.When', 'Douglas', 'loyal', 'son', 'Stallone', 'misgivings', 'give', 'up', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'When', 'important', 'meeting', 'scheduled', 'bankers', 'see', 'hilarious', 'study', 'contrasts', 'Stallone', 'old', 'hoods', 'have', 'great', 'difficulty', 'shaking', 'old', 'personas', 'behaving', 'gentlemen.While', 'Stallone', 'problems', 'enough', 'transition', 'business', 'executive', 'accountant', 'tells', 'raise', 'love', 'marry', 'Stallone', 'daughter', 'Stallone', 'enraged', 'states', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'question', 'not', 'actually', 'daughter', 'Meanwhile', 'own', 'daughter', 'who', 'move', 'out', 'suffocating', 'enclosure', 'family', 'mansion', 'father', 'constant', 'thumb', 'making', 'marriage', 'noises', 'own.Stallone', 'forced', 'constantly', 'shift', 'gears', 'while', 'bemoaning', 'concentration', 'being', 'disrupted', 'day', 'important', 'meeting', 'leading', 'bankers', 'who', 'will', 'propel', 'crime', 'field', 'When', 'identity', 'shifts', 'strategic', 'jockeying', 'crescendo', 'one', 'Bud', 'Abbott', 'Lou', 'Costello', 'Whose', 'First', 'routine.Eventually', 'former', 'Stallone', 'mansion', 'domestic', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'Dallas', 'television', 'fame', 'surfaces', 'startling', 'announcement', 'film', 'conclusion', 'up', 'identity', 'problems', 'manner', 'Stallone']",Oscar VHS
