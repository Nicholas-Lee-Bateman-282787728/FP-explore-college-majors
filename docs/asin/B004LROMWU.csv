This is just another zombie apocalypse series with CGI aliens substituting for flesh-eating humans. What struck me as most interesting was that the much-feared mythical electro-magnetic pulse wiped out not only modern electronics (despite the fact extensive research has shown the myth of the EMP: stuff works just fine) but also wiped out excess fat (everyone is slender in the series, whereas in real life everyone is either fat or obese) and, most amazingly of all, also wiped out the classic Boston accent. So the gallant band of survivors heads for Marblehead instead of ""maahblehed.""In short this is just another boring me-too apocalypse-with-guns tedious imagination-free CGI rehash with nothing whatsoever to commend it.

1413547,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B004LROMWU,Andre Dursin,"[12, 18]","This enjoyable variation on ""War of the Worlds"" from executive producer Steven Spielberg finds a group of survivors struggling to maintain their existence in a post-alien invasion Boston. Noah Wylie stars as one of the de facto leaders of a resistance movement intended to stop the aliens, who mostly leave the deserted suburban areas of Massachusetts alone outside of occasional patrols, but who also abduct younger humans for their own - as of yet unknown - reasons. Wylie often clashes with military veteran Will Patton over balancing the group's safety with trying to make a dent against the extraterrestrials, all the while taking care of his family, including three young sons.Though familiar, ""Falling Skies"" is entertaining stuff, mainly because the quality production values are matched with a strong human component. Wylie, so good for many years as John Carter on ""ER,"" makes for a perfect everyman - a professor reluctantly thrust into battle, who often finds himself reflecting on the group's predicament in the context of history - and he's matched by a fine supporting cast including Patton, Moon Bloodgood  and Sarah Carter. Fine special effects and a satisfying mix of sci-fi action and human drama make ""Falling Skies"" well worth checking out.Warner's Blu-Ray edition of ""Falling Skies"" looks terrific with 1080p transfers and DTS MA soundtracks. A good selection of extras include commentaries, a San Diego Comic-Con featurette, behind the scenes featurettes, a sneak peak at Season 2 and a BD exclusive look at the Dark Horse comic book.In some ways ""Falling Skies"" comes off feeling like Spielberg's second stab at ""War of the Worlds,"" but the series ultimately works better thanks to better fleshed out, and more likeable, characters. Before Season 2 hits the TNT airwaves this summer, newcomers would do well to check out Warner's Blu-Ray Season 1 release when it streets on June 5th.",4,"More Entertaining than ""War of the Worlds""",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,1907,"['enjoyable', 'variation', 'War', 'Worlds', 'executive', 'producer', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'group', 'survivors', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'existence', 'post-alien', 'invasion', 'Boston', 'Noah', 'Wylie', 'one', 'de', 'facto', 'leaders', 'resistance', 'movement', 'intended', 'stop', 'aliens', 'who', 'mostly', 'leave', 'deserted', 'suburban', 'areas', 'Massachusetts', 'alone', 'occasional', 'patrols', 'who', 'also', 'abduct', 'younger', 'humans', 'own', 'yet', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'Wylie', 'often', 'military', 'veteran', 'Will', 'Patton', 'balancing', 'group', 'safety', 'trying', 'make', 'dent', 'extraterrestrials', 'while', 'taking', 'care', 'family', 'including', 'three', 'young', 'sons.Though', 'familiar', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'entertaining', 'stuff', 'mainly', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'matched', 'strong', 'human', 'component', 'Wylie', 'so', 'good', 'many', 'years', 'John', 'Carter', 'ER', 'perfect', 'everyman', 'professor', 'reluctantly', 'battle', 'who', 'often', 'reflecting', 'group', 'predicament', 'context', 'history', 'matched', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Patton', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'Sarah', 'Carter', 'Fine', 'special', 'effects', 'satisfying', 'mix', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'human', 'drama', 'make', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'well', 'checking', 'out.Warner', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'terrific', '1080p', 'transfers', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtracks', 'good', 'selection', 'extras', 'include', 'commentaries', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic-Con', 'featurette', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'sneak', 'peak', 'Season', '2', 'BD', 'exclusive', 'look', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'comic', 'book.In', 'ways', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'off', 'feeling', 'Spielberg', 'second', 'stab', 'War', 'Worlds', 'series', 'ultimately', 'better', 'thanks', 'better', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'likeable', 'characters', 'Season', '2', 'TNT', 'summer', 'newcomers', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'check', 'out', 'Warner', 'Blu-Ray', 'Season', '1', 'release', 'when', 'June', '5th']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)

1413554,A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X,B004LROMWU,anonymous,"[7, 14]","The title of my review is something Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) said in Season 1, and I think it sums up how I (and maybe the rest of the audience) was feeling while watching this show because it sure moved slowly.  Like others have said, I thought I would like this show because it's about an alien invasion and it's got Spielberg attached to it, so I gambled and bought it even though the only footage I had seen were promos for Season 2 on TNT.  Sadly, I was wrong.Wyle's performance was the best thing about this series, and if it weren't for him I probably wouldn't have made it through all 10 episodes.  Some of the other actors did a good job, but I hated Will Patton's acting nearly every time he was on screen.  His character, Weaver, was annoying as well because he almost always disagreed with whomever he was talking to, especially Tom, so conversations with him became predictable.  It was hard to take him seriously with that pony tail: he acted all military but yet had a hairstyle that normally wouldn't be allowed in the armed forces.  Some of the kids' acting was ok, but others made me groan they were so bad.  Pope is the show's answer to Sawyer, the shaggy-haired rebel on ""Lost"" who acted too cool to hang with the others and did his own thing.  That much they have in common.  However, Pope lacks Sawyer's charisma and charm and comes off looking and sounding like Dennis Miller, who thinks he's funny but isn't.  FS writers: why don't you make him a bad ass instead of a failed wise ass? I might like him then.As others have pointed out, this show is more of a family drama than it is a sci-fi series, which I wasn't expecting.  I could do without all the hugging, movitivational pep talks and feel-goood moments.  In one scene, the 2nd Mass takes a break from war to watch a movie in the gym of the school they've made their hidden base.  Ok, but the movie they're showing is a cartoon--not a well-respected animated feature film like most of Pixar's films but a children's cartoon--and everyone in the audience is laughing hard.  Really? I understood what the writers were trying to do, but did they truly expect us to believe that even the adults found that cartoon hysterically funny? Fail.  And would Weaver really have wasted the gasoline needed to run the generator that powers the projector just so people could blow off a little steam? That's hard to believe unless they had access to an endless supply of gas, but I didn't think that was the case since we saw the 2nd Mass searching for gas in abandoned vehicles.I was hoping a show about people fighting back against an alien invasion would have lots of fighting, but there was little action in each episode, and the season-long build up to the resistance fighters' attack was a big let down.  I was hoping we'd finally be treated to a huge battle, a feast for the eyes heavy on visual effects, but that wasn't the case.  As far as effects go, some worked but others didn't: the tiptoeing mechs (which were obvious rip offs of the two-legged AT-ST walkers from ""Return of the Jedi"") didn't always look like they occupied the same space as the background they were drawn over.  And what's with that moaning sound they make? Is it meant to be scary? Sorry, it's just silly.TNT has been hyping the hell of out the 2-hour Season 2 premiere, which airs tonight.  I will probably watch it out of curiousity, hoping this year the show will focus more on action, effects and the mythology of the alien visitors.

1413558,A24IZL1YQF0YBJ,B004LROMWU,"Art Scott ""Statsmonster""","[3, 4]","Please note:  The following was originally a rebuttal to a certain review which many found helpful, yet contained AT LEAST 10 errors in science/logic.I find Falling Skies to be a well done sci-fi show with the only major failings to be in the special effects department, but then this show was OBVIOUSLY not made with the budget of a Network prime time series, so you have to be able to get past the &#34;not so good&#34; special effects, ALONG with the usual problems people have with Sci-Fi shows, such as &#34;how did the Aliens get past the faster than light travel&#34;  How, with the limited forces that we see, did the Aliens manage to wipe out the entire US military? If the world's military was obliterated, how are small insurgent bands able to kill them?  Now, those were MY problems with the show, which is why it would only get 3 1/2 stars IF I were allowed to do that. I can't, so I rounded up.  If you generally don't like Sci-Fi, it's probably a 2 1/2 star show.  That is, this is no &#34;Walking Dead&#34; or &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; which people love DESPITE the genre.  I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't like Sci-Fi.  If you don't like Star Wars OR Star Trek (let alone both), don't bother.  If you DO like Sci-Fi, and could stomach shows like Battlestar Gallactica, Andromeda, et. al., it's well worth the time. That's my honest assessment of the show.Now, here's a simplified list of just SOME of the alleged flaws I've seen listed which are followed by an explanation of why their alleged claims of flaws are flawed  :)SPOILER ALERT: There are things below which might give away parts of the show if you're yet to watch it.Just a &#60;Ahem&#62; few things...1. &#34;These People are too lucky&#34;Throughout the known history of earth and war on earth, there are examples of things which sound truly unbelievable--things which make most, if not ALL fiction seem reasonable by comparison--yet actually happened.  If you need some examples, do a search in the quality search engine of your choice on the narratives of people who've been awarded the Medal of Honor non-posthumously, and you'll find LOTS of &#34;WAY! stranger than fiction&#34; examples of the &#34;hard to believe&#34; actually occurring.2.  &#34;All teens want to see their schools shut down, so why would they use it as a rebel base?&#34;Just because SOME kids would love to see their school shut down, hardly means ALL kids feel that way.  Along with MANY of my friends, the LAST thing we wanted was to see our school shut down.  If things were as bad as they say, certainly NO kids would return to visit their high schools after the end of each of their first few semesters of college were over, and THAT'S at a time when there are still teachers and RULES.  I'll grant that I graduated back in '82 and doubtlessly some things have changed.  Still, my step-son returns to his HS after each of his college semesters end, and he looks back on his HS years as a great time, as do I.  I CERTAINLY didn't want to see my school shut down, and believe the hyperbole is FAR from accurate re: teens and school.  Maybe THEY don't or didn't like HS, but it was one of the best times of my life.  Only in HS and college was I surrounded with so many beautiful girls/young women with such easy excuses to meet them (that's if you needed an excuse at all).  To boot, what ANY of that would have to do with where teens would choose to house/hide themselves when there are NO teachers, bells, mandatory homeroom periods, during a period of an alien invasion, or even a civil war, etc... is beyond me.3. &#34;We never see any non-major characters in a science lab turned hospital&#34;There are people CONSTANTLY being treated in the background.  Heck, the pediatric M.D. even tells one such non-named character &#34;I know this sounds like a joke, but take 2 of these, and see me in the morning.&#34;  Third, the show isn't ABOUT the medical care of people during an alien invasion. It's about the insurgency.  Were it about medical care, I'm sure we'd see PLENTY of them, but it's obviously not the focus of the show.  Last, we see MORE than the occasional non-major character being treated in the background, but there's a REASON they don't concentrate on them.  I would be bored to TEARS if I had to watch the few people with medical training of any kind treat characters I didn't care about, and do it on a regular basis.  Why would I WANT to?4. &#34;Teens shouldn't be strutting around with automatic weapons&#34;This could only be claimed as a flaw by those who have little knowledge of the way it ACTUALLY is in the military within a combat zone.  Depending upon the unit, the penalties for leaving your weapon somewhere someone else could take it, while in a combat zone range from written reprimand to court-martial.  As a retired Army officer, and combat chopper pilot, my M9 stayed loaded and on my person even in my sleep.  For 11 bang bangs in a combat zone, SLEEPING with your weapon in hand, or otherwise tied to your body is mandatory.  Given that, I would call it a BIGGER flaw if I saw &#34;fighters&#34; (as opposed to &#34;eaters&#34;) NOT carrying around their weapons while &#34;strutting&#34; down the hallway.5. &#34;It's just a story about a boy and his dad&#34;The story is absolutely NOT!, by ANY means, about a boy and his dad.  Anyone who says that hasn't REALLY watched the show.  It's a story about one unit (the 2nd Mass.) which is part of a much larger unit, all of whom are part of the insurgency against an alien military which has effectually taken over the earth, and enslaves human children, and this unit's drive to push the aliens off of the planet.6. &#34;The 'hot doctor' walks around with her hands [bloody]&#34;There are plenty of doctors who are hot, and one's empirical physical beauty has little or nothing to do with one's intellect or squeamishness.  Considering she's also a major romantic interest for the most charismatic character in the unit (or at least it's how he's portrayed), I would find it more UNBELIEVABLE if she were UGLY!  But, again, what does that have to do with anything!?!  If she weren't hot, Tom Mason would be involved in a romance with some other chick, not the doctor.  Just because there are aliens trying to take over the earth doesn't mean men are going to fail to notice a hot chick.7. Similar to #1, these people have too many good things happen to them.As far as the things you see and don't see,  It has to do more with what's relevant in advancing the plot, and what we find interesting, than coincidence.  Day to day things are not interesting.  As human beings, the MAJORITY of us aren't interested in watching the normal, average, and boring.  There's a reason there are more movies about Audie Murphy than any other soldier.  We're MOST interested in the UNCOMMON, the NOT so normal.  Do you really want to watch them taking off their clothes, and taking a dump? Or doing laundry? Or having each meal?  In a show about an alien invasion, would you really WANT to watch doctors fixing up every boo-boo?  Even shows about DOCTORS don't show the boring little crap.  House M.D. (in accordance with the absolute genius performance by Hugh Laurie) showed us just how BORING fixing up cuts, scrapes, and abrasions really is.  The reason you see the wildly lucky and heroic in shows and movies is because watching those who AREN'T lucky generally get killed, which aside from cutting down on the possibilities of the direction and length of the show, would have a horrible ending, and the other option would be watching cowardice, which, especially should it go unpunished, is something MOST humans find morally reprehensible.  Maybe OTHERS would prefer to watch the stories of the people being slaughtered (and I would argue they've shown LOTS of slaughter within the show), but they'd be the oddballs.  If we wanted to watch sad endings, and butchery, or how savage humans can be to one another, we can always watch the news.8.  &#34;How is it these aliens who have the technology to reach earth can't instantly kill us&#34; or &#34;can't see us.&#34;Re: Aliens not seeing the 2nd Mass. I've watched every episode of the show, the first couple seasons more than once, and I can't recall seeing &#34;hundreds&#34; of people hanging out in an open field even once, but even were it so, there are 7 billion people on this planet.  If if 90% were killed in the first 7 or 8 months, it would still leave hundreds of millions, and the aliens OBVIOUSLY don't have that kind of numbers, which is why they're kidnapping kids.  Look at it this way: every mentally healthy person I've met despises cockroaches, and would do whatever they could think of within their power to kill them.  I think it's rather obvious we are even FURTHER ahead of cockroaches technologically than the fish heads (those who enslaved the skitters in the first place--for those who don't know the terminology, the &#34;skitters&#34; are the Alien's version of infantry, the fish heads would be the commissioned &#34;general officers&#34;) are supposedly over us, yet somehow we can't seem to wipe the surfeit of those nauseating creatures from the earth.  We're not even MARGINALLY close to doing it.  If you legitimately watched the first episode of the second season, you should KNOW the fish heads never expected the level of resistance they received, thus traveled from who knows where, for who knows how long without bringing sufficient numbers and firepower.  This has happened and continues to happen in real world battles all the time, all throughout history.  Humans have proved themselves the single most adaptable known species of animal ever to walk the earth.  To think it would be so easy for any alien which is neither omniscient nor omnipotent to wipe human beings off the face of the earth, ESPECIALLY now, is about as silly as thinking we should already have wiped out the cockroaches, or hell, even a single SPECIES of cockroach which is equally ubiquitous as man on earth, especially when that was NOT their main objective.  These aliens aren't NEARLY as far advanced technologically as you give them credit for being.  Using the same analogy, we are far, FAR, FAAAAARRRRR!!! more advanced technologically than the cockroach (or rat, or bed-bug, make it the evil of choice), but just SEEING something, hating it, knowing how to kill it, and having the tools, (ALL of which are true of roaches, rats, and bed-bugs), doesn't mean they're so easy to kill, let alone eradicate.  Even KNOWING something's there (rats, cockroaches, and bed-bugs are great examples of things we KNOW are there, WANT to eradicate, yet can't) doesn't make it easy to eradicate, no matter HOW good our technology is, or HOW well we understand the motivations and mechanisms by which these things operate.  I submit, barring a removal of liquid water, or a thorough terraforming of the earth, or other major ELE, it would be next to impossible for any alien &#62;= same size/mass of humans to eradicate man from the earth.  In fact, IMO we are more a danger to ourselves than these obviously NOT so ubiquitous aliens.9.  &#34;They shouldn't have all those medical supplies&#34; or &#34;They made one drug run, now have every medication they need&#34;Re: drugs, and the run to the drugstore, there are few things here I find to be disingenuous in this argument.  First, do they REALLY have to show you EVERY TIME they make a run, or find a supply of medications?  I've NEVER thought for a MOMENT that was the ONLY time they made a run on a place with medical supplies and/or medication.  If you've ever been in a Big Pharma warehouse, you know with absolute certainty there would be no shortage of drugs available during an alien invasion, especially one where, within 8 months or so (we know the invasion started roughly 7 to 8 months before the show starts), human beings have been reduced to a point where they're walking around in groups of only a few hundred.  It is simply IMPOSSIBLE for that small a population of humans to go through even ONE of the Big Pharma warehouses, not to mention the drug stores, hospitals, pharmacies within supermarkets and superstores, and on top of that, prepper/survivalist caches, and so forth within 8 months.  Thus, I find it VERY easy to believe, the 2nd Mass., which consists of something like 100-200 soldiers, and no more than 200 civilians (we're given this number in an early episode), has been able to find PLENTY of medication to fit their needs.  Remember also, in the first 6 months of such an invasion, the vast majority of people who depend on medications or electricity to survive will be gone... dead, thus no longer needing medication.  The one episode dedicated to them acquiring a nice stockpile of medications was meant, at least IMNSHO, as a means of showing us that yes, they DO have to go out occasionally and get more meds, but also that there ARE medications, and large stockpiles at that, to be found pretty much no matter where you are, as long as it was within the USA/Canada, and once had a relatively large human population.  Thus I think it's fair to conclude from the amount of medications maintained by a single CVS, Eckherds, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Super Target, and so on, let alone military bases, hospitals, and Big Pharma warehouses, prepper caches, etc... the 2nd mass would have PLENTY of medication for the ~400 of them, and it should be no mystery to anyone who takes the time to work out the equation.10.  &#34;They use gasoline powered vehicles, so should be out of fuel by now, or at least soon&#34;Who says they have to rely upon gasoline? A deuce&1/2 can run on just about anything, even discarded engine oil, even vegetable and/or animal fat if necessary.  There's little of much of anything liquid and flammable a deuce&1/2 cannot use for fuel.  It's also REMARKABLY easy to get normal everyday combustion engine cars to run on wood gas.  During WW2 it was a regular thing for families to have an automobile that ran on wood gas.  Whereas it's SOMEWHAT limited in that there are only so many trees on the planet, it would be VERY easy for a force as small as the 2nd Mass to run all of their automobiles without a problem until the end of time.  If someone is that ignorant on these matters, it leads me to wonder why they would watch ANYTHING in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Gothic Horror genre.  What's worse, their lack of knowledge of the science of things has actually driven people away from a really good show, at least if you enjoy Sci-Fi/Post Apocalyptic shows (see: V, Jericho, Revolution, Walking Dead, Resident Evil, et. al.)I mean, they didn't show us where these people are going potty every day, but I think it's safe to assume they ARE going through their biological imperatives.AND LAST:&#34;The show tends to have happy endings&#34; or &#34;smiley face&#34; endings.I'm BEYOND where they get the &#34;smiley face&#34; notion (I mean, humans killing other humans in the face of alien invasion? The SINGLE MOST LIKELY thing to bring an end to humanity's inhumanity toward itself? And we even see an example of THAT! level of hopelessness in the show... How is THAT so &#34;smiley face&#34;?).  Whereas yes, there are endings which leave us with a feeling of hope, and not one of desperation and sorrow, I submit if it were written any other way, only a true misanthrope would enjoy watching it.  When it comes to movies, television, a good book, a great P&P; RPG session, or ending of a well conceived computer game (the ending of the very firstEA Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection, and the entire experience of Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War II, if something doesn't end on a happy note, or a hopeful one, I don't want to watch it.  After all, what is entertainment but an escape from the realities of our lives?You want realism?  Turn on the news, or read lots of True Crime (Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit,Deadly Innocence,Journey Into Darkness,The Evil That Men Do: FBI Profiler Roy Hazelwood's Journey into the Minds of Sexual Predators,Dark Dreams: A Legendary FBI Profiler Examines  Homicide and the Criminal Mind,Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist, and I could go on, are all EXCELLENT books, with LOTS of realism).  If you want to escape, however, why would you want UNHAPPY endings? Are you so miserable you can't stand others being happy or can't enjoy a show which tries to give people a feeling of hope even when there's little quality of life remaining? This is something I'll never understand.  In my own PERSONAL choices for entertainment, if something doesn't have a happy ending, I consider the entire project a failure for the reasons stated above.  We understand fiction is supposed to be entertaining, meaning we can choose whatever ending we like.  I submit those who want, or prefer UNHAPPY or TRAGIC endings, at least on a regular basis, suffer from a personality disorder of some form.I hate that reviews like the ones containing any of the above flawed reasoning may have driven some Sci-Fi fans away from a really good show.  I mean, there are more scientific fallacies on Walking Dead than there are within Fallen Skies (of course, I think Walking Dead is probably the 2nd best television series on today, and that's second only to Game of Thrones), yet Walking Dead is AGAIN the highest rated show on television (Caution: shameless plug coming: and I highly recommend investments into a &#62;=9.8 graded #1 copies of Walking Dead, at least if you can find someone who's selling them one).  The point?  Realism is FAR from the most important factor when determining how good a show is, and if you're aware you can make as many errors as the ones above re: Falling Skies, I suggest you either worry about realism less, or ask someone who knows what they're talking about when it comes to the science.I hope this clarifies things for some of the viewers out there who've been on the fence, whether it be TO watch it, or NOT to watch it.  Either way, my goal whenever I take the time to do a review like the one above, is to be sure those of you who would LIKE the show, know enough to watch, and those of you who WOULDN'T like the show, don't waste their time trying to find out if they'll like it.My apologies in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors.  I don't see any way to preview my post before submitting it.",4,A Rebuttal on Comments Claiming Lack of Realism Within the Show,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,18414,"['Please', 'note', 'following',

Heck, I've probably seen every last one of them at some point. Up until Falling Skies, my favorite sci-fi show of this nature has always been V. What sets Falling Skies apart-however-is the fact that, with each episode, you become more invested in the characters and the tension slowly mounts. You realize that there really is a threat facing everyone now that the invasion has happend and we lost against them. When we catch up to Tom Mason, he and Capt. Weaver(chief soldier, major hard-a$$)are tryng to figure out how to protect what humans are left and how to fight back against a vastly superior alien force, called Skitters(a group of spider-like beings from outer space).  What neither he nor anyone else can figure out is exactly what the aliens' agenda might be. It isn't until the final episode that we finally get some clarity as to what that might be.While the first season is a great one and is worth getting, it does suffer some major flaws in its' execution. One flaw is the fact that there's very little special effects. What FX there are aren't anything to wrote home about. I've seen better in movies on the SyFy Channel, hate to admit. Not only that but most episodes tend to be too talkified with little to no excitement to keep us interested. Course, it goes back to what I was saying that, with each episode-- you become more invested in the characters and want to see what happens next with them.Sure, we've seen this story a miliion times but Falling Skies is worth getting into.",5,Falling Skies: The Complete First Season.......,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,1684,"['Just', 'editorial', 'review', 'first', 'season', 'Falling', 'skies', 'states', 'was', 'shortage', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'aliens', 'invading', 'Earth', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'came', 'along', 'Heck', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'last', 'one', 'point', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'nature', 'always', 'been', 'V.', 'What', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'apart-however-is', 'fact', 'episode', 'become', 'more', 'invested', 'characters', 'tension', 'slowly', 'mounts', 'realize', 'really', 'threat', 'facing', 'everyone', 'now', 'invasion', 'happend', 'lost', 'When', 'catch', 'up', 'Tom', 'Mason', 'Capt', 'Weaver', 'chief', 'soldier', 'major', 'hard-a', 'are', 'tryng', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'protect', 'what', 'humans', 'are', 'left', 'how', 'fight', 'back', 'vastly', 'superior', 'alien', 'force', 'called', 'Skitters', 'group', 'spider-like', 'beings', 'outer', 'space', 'What', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'aliens', 'agenda', 'might', 'be', ""n't"", 'final', 'episode', 'finally', 'get', 'clarity', 'what', 'might', 'be.While', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'one', 'worth', 'getting', 'suffer', 'major', 'flaws', 'execution', 'One', 'flaw', 'fact', 'very', 'little', 'special', 'effects', 'What', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'wrote', 'home', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'movies', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'hate', 'admit', 'Not', 'only', 'most', 'episodes', 'tend', 'be', 'too', 'talkified', 'little', 'excitement', 'keep', 'interested', 'Course', 'back', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'episode', 'become', 'more', 'invested', 'characters', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'them.Sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'miliion', 'times', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'worth', 'getting']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)

The hope of an (almost) clean slate. The way it takes cartoon characters out of a graphic novel and puts them into people I feel I am sharing my world with.

More gripping than Revolution , which feels flat and trite to me, this storyline is compelling enough to have me jumping to the next episode.

I am not surprised, though.  These types of reviewers probably offer similar criticism for everything else they encounter.  Some of those critiques come off like first year film or literature students who toss out phrases like &#34;too many holes in the plot&#34; or &#34;characters are not well developed&#34;, etc.When I watch a film or television show, as I mentioned, I am really just interested in being entertained.  It seems counterproductive to sit and look for any sort of flaw when the real purpose of engaging in the activity is relaxation.  So, the question about this series is whether or not it is entertaining.  It is.  There is a nice balance in that there are action segments, dramatic segments as well as emotional segments.  It is lacking in the comedic or romantic areas, but it should be.  The topic is serious.  The timeline of Season 1 suggests that the invasion has just occured.  Trying to pursue too much comedy or romance would be inconsistent with what would be expected.  There are hints at romantic connection that, I hope, play out and develop in the other seasons.  Perhaps some more comedy would fit better there as well.Again, I would hate to see readers of viewer comments pass up on giving this series a chance just because there may be some holes in the plot or not enough character development.  I enjoy watching the show and that is good enough for me.  In fact, I find it very entertaining, which is why I engage in viewing television to begin with.Everyone has different tastes.  So, in short, give it a shot.  If you aren't pulled in after a couple of episodes, move on.  If you find yourself interested in the story line, watch more.  I plan to watch Season 2.  If it entertains me, I will keep watching.  If not, I will move on.  You won't find me on here writing a dissertation on why I stopped watching, though.  The reason will be simple enough.  It wasn't entertaining me.If that wasn't superficial enough for you who are reading my comments, then the only other thing I can say is that I think I fell in love with the &#34;Maggie&#34; character at the very end of the season.

Most of the negatives are just to be negative as I see it. The positive reviews are well thought out and accurate for the most part, Why this is another alien vs the human race plot? Come on folks! It's entirely possible that will happen!Noah portrays a believable prof in unbelievably difficult situations - and rises to the occasion. Of course he does, he's the main protagonist! The human element, with human needs and wants is also well portrayed. I doubt in real life it would be any different. Of course there would be times of non-action - and others?  It's all about being a human being and retaining that special manner. In any way possible, considering the odds. The story certainly allows the participants to rise to the occasion. My question is would we really behave that well. Would we watch out for others...or take care of ourselves only, ultimately wiping us all out and leaving Earth to cockroaches. I don't know, and that's a question that couldn't possibly be answered unless this very thing happened.I am particularly impressed in the manner of behavioral portrayal. Things would change. For children especially, for their parents certainly, for everyone, definitely.If anyone knows how to blow up Voyager? Please do. That was one of the biggest mistakes we ever made as far as the human race. In my humble opinion, of course. If anything resembling this story line were to happen I'd bet everything Voyager as the initiating factor(s).Again, if anyone disbelieves there are bad guys from other planets/galaxies? Not bright. If we can evolve, so could other species. That's simple math. There may be good guys - but would they come here for brunch? Not likely, Good guy aliens? Probably stay at home. Bad guy aliens? Yep.

I hadn't researched the show in the slightest, I simply decided to take a chance after noticing I had missed out on some sci-fi that looked promising. I'm glad I didn't read the negative reviews before watching; it is now clear that many of these folks didn't watch the full season... or perhaps they expected a serial of the caliber of Battlestar Galactica (2004). Falling Skies has carved out its own niche, and has not copied any show in recent memory. The comparison to ABC's ""V"" (2009) is valid in theory because both are about alien invasions--but really they are nothing alike. ""V"" ran on the premise of an accident waiting to happen, whereas the worst has already happened in Falling Skies.In the post-apocalyptic world of Falling Skies, you are left with an insurgency that is about equal to what you might expect from a ragtag group of civilians who are lucky enough to have a military Captain, a physician, and a hodgepodge of skill sets in the mix; after the apocalypse, even criminals have a shot at becoming valued members of the gang. And a gang is what the survivors become, just as Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama suggests in BSG during the trial of Gaius Baltar: ""...we're not a civilization anymore. We are a gang, and we are on the run, and we have to fight to survive."" Yet the group of known survivors in Falling Skies is vastly smaller than in BSG; it is closer to (although a fair bit larger than) that of our heroes in The Walking Dead, a post-apocalyptic show with many similarities. By the end of Falling Skies Season 2, our heroes are beyond being just a gang... the sentiment is closer to what Glenn expresses in The Walking Dead as he is digging graves for the casualties his group suffers in the episode Say the Word: ""they were family.""They make mistakes, yes, but given that they live in a new world that is only an echo of the civilization that they lost very recently, I wouldn't expect smooth sailing. Unfortunately for them, they need to learn the hard way what works and what doesn't. We are there to experience this along with them, including down to the level of father with sons. I agree with another reviewer that it is refreshing to see the pragmatic and non-confrontational relationship between the leading father and his eldest son. Although the characters can sometimes be annoying, this can be said to add to the realism of the show rather than detracting from the viewing experience.Overall, this doesn't quite make 5 stars. The script often isn't tight, and sometimes I get the feeling that I've seen the same thing somewhere else (much of sci-fi seems familiar if you watch enough of it). It doesn't really grab you from the start... it is more of an evolution of good television as the seasons progress. To all the haters: Season 2 has some nice twists (you are missing out if you quit prematurely).",4,"May grow on you, like a skitter harness on kids",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2894,"['watched', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'span', 'one', 'week', 'had', ""n't"", 'researched', 'show', 'slightest', 'simply', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'noticing', 'had', 'missed', 'out', 'sci-fi', 'looked', 'promising', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'watching', 'now', 'clear', 'many', 'folks', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'full', 'season', 'perhaps', 'expected', 'serial', 'caliber', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', '2004', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'carved', 'out', 'own', 'niche', 'not', 'copied', 'show', 'recent', 'memory', 'comparison', 'ABC', 'V', '2009', 'valid', 'theory', 'are', 'alien', 'invasions', 'really', 'are', 'nothing', 'alike', 'V', 'ran', 'premise', 'accident', 'waiting', 'happen', 'worst', 'already', 'happened', 'Falling', 'Skies.In', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'are', 'left', 'insurgency', 'about', 'equal', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'ragtag', 'group', 'civilians', 'who', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'military', 'Captain', 'physician', 'hodgepodge', 'skill', 'sets', 'mix', 'apocalypse', 'even', 'criminals', 'have', 'shot', 'becoming', 'valued', 'members', 'gang', 'gang', 'what', 'survivors', 'become', 'just', 'Captain', 'Lee', ""'Apollo"", 'Adama', 'BSG', 'trial', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', ""'re"", 'not', 'civilization', 'anymore', 'are', 'gang', 'are', 'run', 'have', 'fight', 'survive', 'group', 'known', 'survivors', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'vastly', 'smaller', 'BSG', 'closer', 'fair', 'bit', 'larger', 'heroes', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'post-apocalyptic', 'show', 'many', 'similarities', 'end', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'Season', '2', 'heroes', 'are', 'being', 'just', 'gang', 'sentiment', 'closer', 'what', 'Glenn', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'digging', 'graves', 'casualties', 'group', 'suffers', 'episode', 'Say', 'Word', 'were', 'family', 'make', 'mistakes', 'yes', 'given', 'live', 'new', 'world', 'only', 'echo', 'civilization', 'lost', 'very', 'recently', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'Unfortunately', 'need', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'are', 'there', 'experience', 'including', 'down', 'level', 'father', 'sons', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'refreshing', 'see', 'pragmatic', 'non-confrontational', 'relationship', 'leading', 'father', 'eldest', 'son', 'characters', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'annoying', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'add', 'realism', 'show', 'rather', 'detracting', 'viewing', 'experience.Overall', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', '5', 'stars', 'script', 'often', ""n't"", 'tight', 'sometimes', 'get', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'thing', 'somewhere', 'else', 'much', 'sci-fi', 'familiar', 'watch', 'enough', ""n't"", 'really', 'grab', 'start', 'more', 'evolution', 'good', 'television', 'seasons', 'progress', 'haters', 'Season', '2', 'nice', 'twists', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'quit', 'prematurely']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)

After spending 15 years on the series ER one had to figure the next major TV Series he chose to attach his name and reputation to would be good. I waited for the price to come down before buying. That this is a another post apocalyptic tale of alien invasion, think V, was not an immediate turn-on but the strength of this series is not in the battle sequences between man and alien but in the relationships between people.Wyle's Tom has three sons. The rather mature looking 16-year-old Hal played by stunningly handsome 25-year-old Drew Roy. His nine-year-old Matt whom Tom is attempting to allow to retain his childhood, people grow up too fast in refugee camps. And twelve or so Ben who is enslaved by alien technology. Tom we learn repeatedly was an American History Professor before his world fell apart and his wife was killed. He is second in command to a cell of 100 soldiers and 200 civilians commanded by the rather militaristic Will Paton who looks after his soldiers and considers the civilians a liability. Throw in a female doctor as Tom's potential love interest and a surgeon who abandoned Tom's wife to her death and you have the principal characters. I was surprised to see Wyle resort to fisticuffs, he looks more at home cuddling his young son and hugging the teen. The scene which shows Hal cradling his brother Matt in his sleep is poignant.The upright walking 8-legged aliens must have been a challenge to the robotics department. What do you do with eight legs? Their warrior robots clomp around on two hooves that leave tracks not unlike the T-Rex's in Jurassic Park.

One doesn't see the typical plot driven stupidity that one often encounters in adventure or science fiction television (e.g. we know that there are vampires in the town, but when we hear strange noises in the basement we assume it's cousin Clem playing a prank and stroll down into the darkness).Even when the characters behave in ways that seem unreasonable its generally an action that fits the nature of their character.I find it wonderful that the writers have the leaders of the group make use of all of their assets, using women and even teenagers as fighters.The story is engaging, the characters are people that we can care about and the situation is one that causes viewers to ask ""What choices would I make in that circumstance.""Now for the bad stuff.

1413751,A17SD0E4QSTJMG,B004LROMWU,JackOfTrades,"[0, 0]","I began watching the episodes of this series a few days ago, and found it to be entertaining for the most part.  As some of the reviewers have mentioned, there are lapses in the quality of the acting, but overall it does not too much detract from the viewer's enjoyment.  Generally speaking, there are times when the characters just don't appear to be very concerned with their situation.  Where it shows most often is in scenes with many players, and some in the background just have improper facial expressions?What prompted me to write a review is just this:Amazon has the first two years of the series available as part of the Prime program.  That means free live stream viewing.  The third year, however, must be purchased at this time, for $1.99 per episode or $19.99 for all 10.  That is something I am unwilling to do, and it makes me regret having watched the first two seasons.  I guess that this last season might become Prime eligible sometime in 2014?I think that the lesson here is: If I consider watching a series, I should first go to each year and see whether it is part of the Prime program, or whether one or more are only available on a purchase basis.  Then I can decide whether to watch only the ones which are Prime eligible, or none.  Or, I could pay for the non-Prime episodes.... (not likely!)UPDATE 12/18/13Glad I came to my account and looked over my reviews, so I could add this information:Merely a few weeks after I mentioned that the third season was not available via Prime Online Stream, that changed.  I WAS able to watch all of the season 3 episodes, via that system.  No worries, mate.  Some of the action that goes on in the third season ...

1413769,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B004LROMWU,Jason,"[4, 7]","Dystopian future films are seemingly popular, but sci-fi always has a difficult transition to television.  In Falling Skies, many of the difficulties are present, and may eventually prove to be fatal to the series.  As it is, a group of survivors known as the 2nd Massachusetts (Revolutionary War reference) attempts everyday survival and resistance against green, spider-like aliens referred to derisively as ""skitters"" in the aftermath of world destruction.The characters are real.  They are fighters and survivors who grow beyond themselves yet recognize the power of camaraderie and numbers.  Everyday people thrust into a post-apocalyptic, planetary takeover do not commandeer jets like in Battlefield Earth; they certainly do not gain stageThe Hunger Gamesor become the world's leading expert inThe Book of Eli; and they do not suddenly turn into a homogenous community of General Patton clones.  They scratch, claw, and fight for survival.Speaking of Patton, I don't know why Will Patton, as Capt. Dan Weaver, is taking such a beating by some.  I think his performance as a troubled leader of a rag-tag group of survivors is great.  Regardless of personal experience, a military commander is going to face extreme difficulties when dealing with an assorted group of people lacking the rigid structure and discipline possessed by those in the military.  Even his executive officer, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle), displays just enough disobedience to usurp some of Patton's power, and ultimately weaken his stature amongst the 2nd Mass survivors.  Adding to his headache is scene stealer John Pope (Colin Cunningham), an outsider, loose-cannon who mixes aplomb with insanity.The sci-fi and FX are a mixed bag.  Sometimes the blending is seamless.  In other instances, it's pretty movement is a bit choppy.  Story-wise, the technology is sufficiently advanced that humans don't suddenly start incorporating it to its fullest extent (looking at you,Independence Day).  In one gruesome plot-line, the aliens attach mind-controlling devices (called ""harnesses"") to the spinal columns of children.  This has been criticized by some, but it's not like adults and children have ever been divided in sci-fi before,right?I truly enjoy the series for what it is.  It's more drama than action, an evenly paced storyline that reveals just enough to entice.  Unfortunately, like so many other good sci-fi series (Firefly, Sarah Connor, V, Terra Nova), I expect this series to be cancelled in favor of the next CSI, SVU, cooking, auction, or repo ""reality"" show.(Extras: Extended pilot, audio commentary, Comic-Con panel, Behind the Scenes features (Skitter & Harness makeup), deleted scenes, and a Season 2 preview)",5,Great sci-fi show.

As a movie, this type of post-apocalyptic show would be easy to execute, fitting a story line nicely into 90 - 120 minutes.

In addition to keeping the story line moving along, you have to maintain a certain degree of realism for the situation.I believe that Falling Skies achieves these qualities satisfactorily.

Like in similar stories, what remains of mankind is simultaneously trying to survive, and to strike back, sort of guerilla warfare against the remaining aliens (conveniently, having taken over major cities and wiped out military bases, most of them departed leaving only a &#34;garrison&#34; behind that our heroes are harassing.There's a significant cast over 4 episodes; the one I recognized immediately in season one was Noah Wyle from &#34;ER&#34;.  He's a history professor with 2 sons, who has lost his wife in the invasion.  Seems to be potential chemistry between him and Moon Bloodgood.

1413827,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B004LROMWU,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[3, 4]","The only reason I bought Season 1 of Falling Skies is that Season 2 was just so much better, I wanted the full set. This is why we have to stick with a show! I get so annoyed when people watch 3 or 4 episodes of a show and decide it just isn't very good and turn it off. Instant gratification has been responsible for the loss of many brilliant shows. I'm not sure why TNT decided to pick this up again because this season was....OK. There was way too much talking, too many emotional scenes and not nearly enough action in Season 1. I love sci fi, so I stick with pretty much anything in that genre. Especially when the story is a post apocalyptic thriller. However, I admit that I almost dropped this show because Season 1 was so slow.As for the characters, when I first found out that Noah Wylie was going to star in a sci fi show, I didn't believe it. I honestly didn't think he had the acting ability to handle guns and bombs and monsters. I was wrong. He is fantastic in Falling Skies. Then there is Moon Bloodgood, a personal favorite of mine who plays the show's doctor. Will Patton who is also one of my favorite supporting actors. And a whole bunch of new young actors I do not recognize, but who carry this story. This is one of those shows that just came together suddenly, became family, and it all made sense.After the mediocre Season 1, the producers listened to what the fans wanted and Season 2 came out of the cable almost a different show. Less soap opera, much more action. A lot more information on the aliens (in this show, the thrumming noise they make actually gives me the creeps, and monsters usually don't scare me), more information about the children taken by them and what happens to them, much more edge of your seat action. So, it often pays to stick with a show, and that includes TNT, who gets a high five from me for not dropping this one, something NBC and ABC do way to often to the point that I don't even watch new shows on those networks. Why get hooked when it's just going to get canceled? Nevertheless, you need to buy and watch Season 1 to understand the characters and stories in Season 2. So definitely start from the beginning and understand that Season 2 will knock your socks off!

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[150, 179]","When the TNT network announced a Spielberg produced science fiction epic for its summer slate of programming, I was eager to sample the wares. With its massive advertising campaign, the network clearly had high expectations--and initial ratings were strong and instantaneous causing the show to receive an immediate second season order. Season One consists of ten episodes that weave a solid story of survivors in the aftermath of an alien invasion. Channeling a low key energy, as opposed to a pulse pounding tone, the show does a nice job establishing every day folks caught up in extraordinary circumstances. The piece's central theme is that we're all heroes in our own way and we're all stronger for standing together. It is a remarkably earnest presentation that remains mildly downbeat without ever seeming hopeless. This matter-of-fact feel is both one of the strongest elements of the show, but also one of the things that kept me from truly investing in the drama.In truth, there is nothing particularly revelatory in the plotting of ""Falling Skies."" While I enjoyed the creature conception of the skitters (one of the alien life forms), admired the ambitious special effects, and was intrigued by some of the concepts (particularly the harnessed children)--I couldn't escape the general feeling that I'd seen it all before in countless similar variations. With a familiar feeling narrative, then, it is left to the screenwriters and the characterizations to make the show really pop. And I'm not sure that a memorable cast of characters has yet to evolve. Noah Wyle does most of the heavy lifting and makes an admirable every man hero. But many of the peripherals don't really stand out as interesting or fully developed individuals. When Steven Weber shows up for a few episodes, he creates real passion. When Henry Czerny pops around, there is a nice sense of menace. None of the regular supporting cast makes as much of an impression as these guest stars.I'll take that back--we have Colin Cunningham as a unscrupulous villain that might be on the path to reform. His scenes have such urgency, such humor, such unpredictability. And in contrast, the other members of the cast seem a bit dour or unfocused. The show is still in its infancy, and I hope that in the return there is an imperative on distinguishing the individual characters a bit more. Still, if you like this sort of survivor drama, you'll probably enjoy ""Falling Skies."" As the season progressed to the inevitable big showdown finale, the resolution did feel a bit underwhelming. As it stands, the show had a decent (if not spectacular) debut but needs to heighten the action and human drama in its sophomore year. It has a talented cast, they just need to be allowed to shine. I want to love ""Falling Skies,"" but merely like it. As a viewer, I need an urgency from the writing that makes me feel like I'm in the trenches with heroes that I really care about in a meaningful way. I just haven't gotten there yet....KGHarris, 8/11.Bonus Features: DVD set is 3 disc, Blu-ray is 2 disc.

1413874,A19OXFY4DO4L3H,B004LROMWU,Lucian A. Sperta,"[0, 1]","Keep reading my RECANT below>>>>>Hi all, I recently purchased the entire first season of Falling Skies, first of all the wording on Amazon was confusing, I thought it said 2 hour Season premier for $1.99, so I thought this must be the movie before the mini-series began. But I was dumbfounded when I learned (after calling Amazon) in actuality you have to purchase each episode for $1.99, after speaking and reviewing the customer service, she also agreed it was misstated and could see how it can be read this way. Well I buckled, I purchased the entire season with the blessing of Amazon on a discounted price.Unfortunately when I reached #3, I was lost and not interested any longer and called back for a full refund. In a word HORRIBLE!!!, I expected in the line of Steven Spielberg's Taken, which is a down right EXCELLENT mini series with all the drama, intensity, and wonderful acting with a great storyline, much more believable and thought provoking than Falling Skies, and yet CGI was incredible it didn't look 'cartonoish' and unbelievable as it did in Falling Skies. Falling Skies was not worth the anticipation its getting for the release of its DVD. On Monday TNT will have a non-stop all day showing of this mini series and the following I think will be June 4, 2013.I thought the acting was shotty, and the whole viewing experience did not drag me in as in the classic Taken by director Steven Spielberg. It felt cheaply made, and the acting was not believable and intense as it was in Taken. Taken stands out as one of the best in mini series by this Director and also another mini-series was intense 'Dark Skies' this also was such a great mini series by Sony Pictures was a 5 star EXCELLENT mini series with so much in depth information regarding the famed MJ-12 and its secret dealings with UFO's it also appears to be more historically accurate as per my own research way before I saw this mini series. I have to say even the Fourth Kind was much more believable than Falling Skies.Buyer beware, Falling Skies may have had many 5 Star reviews but if your looking for real historical accuracy and information on the UFO issue, then Taken, and Dark Skies 1996 mini series is your best bet. If you just want junk entertainment and pop corn shows, then Falling Skies is your best pic. I got my refund and will use it wisely, and Amazon please be aware of the labeling of these movies, I felt as though I was tricked into believing it was a 2 hour movie not a bunch of mini-series...Thank God for your customer service and professionalism in  understanding what I was trying to say over the phone, and the operator agreed the wording was off and needs to be corrected. Seek and you shall find the truth..Dark Skies is a nice place to begin with!.MY RECANT......below!I decided to give this series another peek, and although, it does start very slow in the first 3-5 episodes...as the each episode goes on it becomes a monster of a mini-series. Too many teary scenes, but in the light of so much intensity and the story line, they switch back and forth to high octane fighting with our Alien invaders, to love, family and unity. I completed the entire series in two full days, and I must tell you...in the second season, it was fantastic, well done, CGI was great, effects were awesome, Yet still in the last episode of season 2, it still does not say why they came, what they are after, its remains vague and confusing.

1413878,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B004LROMWU,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This first season of initially promising new SF series about human resistance against mysterious alien invaders is, to my considerable regret, a globally failed attempt. Which is a pity, because it had potential and some characters (and actors playing them) are reasonably good. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.In a very near future (like tomorrow) Earth was invaded by aliens and almost the whole planet was conquered, with almost all the major cities around the globe ruined by massive bombardment. In the first episode, on the East Coast of USA some last remnants of military, completed by a hastily organised militia of all able bodied men and women who can and want to fight, still resist alien mopping operations. Those series follow the tribulations of one such militia unit, the 2nd Massachusetts, a roughly 250 fighters strong outfit, led by Captain Dan Weaver (Will Patton) and his second in command, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle).Weaver used to be a professional soldier before retiring and becoming a businessman - he was recalled to duty and promoted to captain of militia after most of regular army was destroyed in initial alien attack. Mason used to be a history teacher and even if he is second in command he doesn't seem to have a military rank, but he is obeyed and respected, because of his natural charisma, great bravery in combat - and also absolute honesty...Amongst other members of 2nd Massachusets important for the story are Mason's two surviving sons (his wife was killed and his third son is missing), Hal and Matt. Hal is a precociously adult 16 years old soldier and squad leader, when Matt is still a, troubled and quite unhappy, little boy... There is also Karen, Hal's teen age girlfriend - and also a hardened battle veteran; Dai, a man of few words, trusted member of Tom Mason's own squad; Jimmy Boland, a 13-years old child soldier and Anthony, a tough and powerful black man, former Boston police officer.Later on more important characters will appear, two of which are the most crucial - a certain Pope (Collin Cunningham), a man with heavy criminal past but also some unsuspected skills, about whom I will say no more and Maggie (Sarah Carter) an absolutely gorgeous young woman with an attitude and a very, very difficult past...This tale of last humanity survivors trekking amongst he ruins of the world to find a place of safety when also bringing the fight to their opressors could and should have been an interesting show - but it ISN'T! Most of every episode is a lot of extremely boring, tedious talking about always the same thing: what were you doing before the invasion? how do you feel about the invasion? dad, I love you, do you love me? blah, blah, blah; what will you do after the invasion? do you remember how our house looked before the invasion? etc.etc. It is almost all the time talking, talking, talking, without ever saying anything interesting - and also with Tom Mason trying to teach (rather lamely) history to everybody...Aliens are roughly divided into two categories: organic creatures named &#34;skitters&#34; and war robots called &#34;mechs&#34;. The &#34;skitters&#34; are supposed to be dangerous - but they NEVER carry any weapons or body armour and can be killed by just anything, including knives! The &#34;mechs&#34; are much tougher, have excellent armor and pack some serious heat - but they all the time emit loud trumpeting noises warning everybody that they are around and at night they also use powerful lamps, making them visible from many miles...))) There are also some flying patrols but they are virtually completely blind, only seeing warm, moving targets...)))In fact, those alien invaders who crossed the distance between stars and destroyed all human armies in a matter of days seem to be now completely unable to find and destroy a company of light infantry, traveling all the time in a convoy of vehicles with ALL LIGHTS TURNED ON AT NIGHT! Even more ridiculous, after all the modern armies in the world failed to make much effect against the aliens, at one moment their whole base is devastated by just ONE antiquated RPG-7 rocket...)))Now, of course, in this kind of films without plot holes bad guys would always win and a civilization travelling between stars MUST have military technology we cannot even dream about at our stage of development - especially a civilization which is THAT aggressive, destructive and CRUEL (I cannot really dwelve on the topic of cruelty here, beause that would be giving spoilers here - but believe me, those guys are really abject, and I don't mean by that their physical aspect...). But, come on, in those series the scenarist didn't even TRY to make something even remotely plausible - and that hurts those series very, very badly indeed.Even worse is the fact that almost every time when a good idea appears, it is crushed and destroyed and almost every time when an interesting character appears, he/she is killed immediately. Yes, there is a couple of attempts to produce twists - but they are all so obvious and anti-climactic, that we can see them coming well in advance, every single time... Also, if you think some social and moral issues like those posed by the &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; series will be treated - well, think again! There is not even one ounce of originality or of courage in &#34;Falling skies&#34;, just banalities and also some political correctness (of course the ONLY violent human gang which 2nd Massachusetts has to fight is entirely made of whites)!I watched this first season until the very end and I must say that I was very disappointed. The only reason why I give it two stars instead of one, resides in two female characters amongst 2nd Massachusetts, doctor Ann Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and young nurse Lourdes Delgado (Seychelle Gabriel) - even if they are not allowed as much screen time as I would like to, those two characters provide at least a reason to keep watching. Middle aged doctor Glass, formerly a pediatrician, who lost all her family during the invasion and is now the combat surgeon for 2nd Massachusetts and young Lourdes, formerly a 2nd year medicine student who is now the chief nurse in the field hospital, are the kind of women we not only fall in love with - we worship the ground on which they walk...The fact that they are both very beautiful women doesn't hurt either...Now, those series get a tiny little bit more interesting in the last episode of first season and also during the second season - not much, but still... It doesn't change my opinion about &#34;Falling skies&#34; as mostly a failulre - but still, it can be a reason to carry on the watching, awaiting for the - very small - amelioration...Bottom line, this is not a good thing, in fact it is even slightly less good than the new &#34;V&#34; series (which in itself were not very good) and of ourse it CANNOT be compared to the amazing show that was &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34;.

Wasn't the last one bad enough, with its crappy SFX (special effects), random chaotic action, and the addition of a generic romance the producers shoved at you?  Certainly you're thinking, Why should I bother to see this if there are so many other shows I could watch?The truth is, &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is an amazing show (go ahead: watch it and see!).  The production value is WAY up: the SFX (both digital and incendiary) are brilliantly done, the writing is authentic and heartfelt, and the actors are top quality.  Though I was drawn to this show first of all because of its premise--a rag-tag militia fighting a horde of aliens--I stayed because I fell in love with each and every character.  This show is less about alien horde than about an extended family desperately trying to stick together and make a life for themselves.  Not to say there isn't plenty of action too--the grit and grime of war appear in every scene.  I once described this show as a post-apocalyptic family-centered drama with aliens, spaceships, motorbikes, 50 cal. machine guns, and the American Minute Men.  The story elements are endless, and yet somehow they blend together seamlessly in an entertaining mini-series that hold you transfixed in suspense, excitement, horror, love, and hope.Is this show for you?

1413912,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B004LROMWU,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[57, 67]","Produced by Stephen Spielberg and teleplay contributions by a number of writers, including Robert Rodat (best known for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) and Mark Verheiden (who wrote 9 episodes for the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and will be an executive producer for the upcoming DARK TOWER series). First off, this is not INDEPENDENCE DAY, people. It's a grim survival tale of humans almost wiped out by an alien invasion some six months ago. The remnants we focus upon are roughly 300 men, women and children and most of them have no military experience.There's an interesting opening in which the children explain an alien invasion of Earth through drawings to their teachers. Electricity and satellites are knocked out and something like over 90% of humanity is gone. About the only reason the humans are able to even mildly resist is simply that the alien force has left the planet with garrisons but you don't know what's happening over the rest of the world which leads to some intriguing presumptions and rumors. Said garrisons have giant bots helping them and  the sinister means to mind control the human children through ""harnesses"" (alien membranes that attack from the neck all the way down to your lower back). Even when the children are freed from the harnesses there are surprises like the aliens finding ways to control those children at opportune times.Noah Wyle, a military professor turned sub commander, is the main character in this tale who tries to give hope to the survivors even though his wife is dead and his middle child has been taken and harnessed by the invaders. Wyle is good enough in his role butacting is all over the board. Some are very good (like Colin Cunningham as the gang leader turned cook/problem solver), some are subdued but done well enough (like Will Patton as the grizzled Desert Storm veteran who all see as their leader or Dale Dye as Colonel Porter who is best remembered as Colonel Sink in BAND OF BROTHERS) and others are in the ""C-ish"" grade range (like some of the teenagers and medical people). I think the second season will have more episodes and give us a better feel for the acting range of this cast.Special effects feel like they're on budget at times but you have to remember that this is TNT. I'd say they're good enough and the reveals as to the special powers/technology of the aliens are fairly well done. The biological hierarchy of aliens was a good idea especially as revealed at the finale. As I said above the tone is grim but not hopeless.The first season was met with positive reviews and the two-hour premiere was watched by 5.9 million viewers, making it cable television's biggest series launch of the year, with more than 2.6 million adults 18-49 and 3.2 million adults 25-54. The first season finale received 5.6 million viewers, the highest rated episode since the series premiere; with 2.5 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. (Wiki source).This show was approved for a second season and hopefully it will be more than ten episodes.STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B; SETTING/FOCUSES: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 2011.",4,MY GRADE: B to B plus.,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3151,"['Produced', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'teleplay', 'contributions', 'number', 'writers', 'including', 'Robert', 'Rodat', 'best', 'known', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'Mark', 'Verheiden', 'who', 'wrote', '9', 'episodes', 'new', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'will', 'be', 'executive', 'producer', 'upcoming', 'DARK', 'TOWER', 'series', 'First', 'off', 'not', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'DAY', 'people', 'grim', 'survival', 'tale', 'humans', 'almost', 'wiped', 'out', 'alien', 'invasion', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'remnants', 'focus', 'upon', 'are', 'roughly', '300', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'most', 'have', 'military', 'interesting', 'opening', 'children', 'explain', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'drawings', 'teachers', 'Electricity', 'satellites', 'are', 'knocked', 'out', 'something', '90', '%', 'humanity', 'gone', 'only', 'reason', 'humans', 'are', 'able', 'even', 'mildly', 'resist', 'simply', 'alien', 'force', 'left', 'planet', 'garrisons', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'rest', 'world', 'intriguing', 'presumptions', 'rumors', 'Said', 'garrisons', 'have', 'giant', 'bots', 'helping', 'sinister', 'mind', 'control', 'human', 'children', 'harnesses', 'alien', 'membranes', 'attack', 'neck', 'way', 'lower', 'back', 'Even', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'freed', 'harnesses', 'are', 'surprises', 'aliens', 'finding', 'ways', 'control', 'children', 'opportune', 'times.Noah', 'Wyle', 'military', 'professor', 'turned', 'sub', 'commander', 'main', 'character', 'tale', 'who', 'give', 'hope', 'survivors', 'even', 'wife', 'dead', 'middle', 'child', 'been', 'taken', 'harnessed', 'invaders', 'Wyle', 'good', 'enough', 'role', 'butacting', 'board', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Colin', 'Cunningham', 'gang', 'leader', 'turned', 'cook/problem', 'solver', 'are', 'subdued', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'Will', 'Patton', 'grizzled', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'veteran', 'who', 'see', 'leader', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'Colonel', 'Porter', 'who', 'best', 'remembered', 'Colonel', 'Sink', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'others', 'are', 'C-ish', 'grade', 'range', 'teenagers', 'medical', 'people', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'episodes', 'give', 'better', 'feel', 'acting', 'range', 'cast.Special', 'effects', 'feel', ""'re"", 'budget', 'times', 'have', 'remember', 'TNT', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'good', 'enough', 'reveals', 'special', 'powers/technology', 'aliens', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'biological', 'hierarchy', 'aliens', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'especially', 'revealed', 'finale', 'said', 'tone', 'grim', 'not', 'hopeless.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'met', 'positive', 'reviews', 'two-hour', 'premiere', 'was', 'watched', '5.9', 'million', 'viewers', 'making', 'cable', 'television', 'biggest', 'series', 'launch', 'year', 'more', '2.6', 'million', 'adults', '18-49', '3.2', 'million', 'adults', '25-54', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'received', '5.6', 'million', 'viewers', 'highest', 'rated', 'episode', 'series', 'premiere', '2.5', 'million', 'viewers', '18-49', 'demographic', 'Wiki', 'source', '.This', 'show', 'was', 'approved', 'second', 'season', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'ten', 'episodes.STORY/PLOTTING', 'B', 'B', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'B', 'SETTING/FOCUSES', 'B', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'B', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', '2011']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)

Instead, we have lots and lots and lots of quiet conversation, down time, and what is presumably meant as character development, but which just comes across as filler, meaningless chat, and stock characters. If the planet were really devastated by aliens and people were hunted by advanced machines, the remaining people would be desperate, frightened, and frazzled. But the characters here are relaxed, chatty, and might as well be on vacation. Other than the very infrequent moments when they are actively encountering the aliens, there is no sense at all that any aliens exist. And how is it that these advanced, interstellar travelers can't see a group of 300 people traveling together on foot? The production values are cheap and easy, and while the digital work on the aliens is at least acceptable, there is far too little of it. TV budgets are not movie budgets, of course, but look at what Spielberg can do with sounds and the implied presence of hostile aliens in a movie like War of the Worlds.

(The worse a show is the more he enjoys watching it and laughing at the stupidity).The episodes in season 1 seem pretty repetitive and predictable.  And only on TV would this group of ""rebels"" and civilians have lasted this long.  They are large convoys, and really loud and who cares about things like lights - the enemy (who is close) won't see us. . . and of course, they are horrible shots.  They finally develop bullets that will pierce and kill the enemy but the writers/directors seem to forget that as few get taken out.  ... The aliens have these huge metal men that are also very noisy - both by the sounds they make as well as how hard they hit the ground with each step - and they have huge beams of light coming out of them, but gee nobody seems to know they're coming until they are right on top of them.  And the list of crap like this just goes on and on.  (Told ya - I just don't understand how this show got such good reviews)If you want a somewhat intelligent/interesting sci-fi show, this is NOT for you.

They might have an emotional outburst, but it doesn't -change- anything about the way they behave later (see House for a great example of how people change because of events). Philosophical and emotional speeches abound, and in most cases the main characters tend to be absorbed into the community minded fluffiness that might make for a great group of people to live in, but not a great show to watch as it feels very dated. I found myself walking away from the screen to do stuff around the house because there was frequently very little tension, and I didn't particularly care about anyone.

This ends up revealing that the conquered human children are not only being controlled, but slowly turned.A father is followed closely as he seeks to protect his family. He is a professor in history, particularly fond of wartime stories.

The viewer may not have empathy yet, but they should at least be interested in what's happening.By the twelve minute mark (and that is what my review is based on), I had learned I was uninterested in the characters, the story was unoriginal, the dialogue was just plain bad, and sad to say I didn't want to watch anymore.  The VFX were bad as well, though they probably had a very minimal budge for it.  I just didn't care about the story, and that is a sad day.Now, Spielberg's name is on this show, but that doesn't automatically make it a good product.I wanted more from it.  If they had spent more time in writing room, developing the characters more (with depth and edge), gotten a more original story (how many stories are there with the aliens taking over earth), and created better drama and dialogue, then this show would have had me.I will not be watching this again.",2,Tea: Another miss for me,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,1098,"['Overall', 'based', 'what', 'little', 'saw', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'all.Basically', 'have', 'ten', 'minutes', 'less', 'opinion', 'five', 'minutes', 'hook', 'viewer', 'story', 'introduce', 'main', 'character', 'viewer', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'empathy', 'yet', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'interested', 'what', 'twelve', 'minute', 'mark', 'what', 'review', 'based', 'had', 'learned', 'was', 'uninterested', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'unoriginal', 'dialogue', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'sad', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'anymore', 'VFX', 'were', 'bad', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'had', 'very', 'minimal', 'budge', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'sad', 'day.Now', 'Spielberg', 'name', 'show', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'good', 'product.I', 'wanted', 'more', 'had', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'writing', 'room', 'developing', 'characters', 'more', 'depth', 'edge', 'more', 'original', 'story', 'how', 'many', 'stories', 'are', 'there', 'aliens', 'taking', 'earth', 'created', 'better', 'drama', 'dialogue', 'then', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'me.I', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'again']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)

1413993,A16GM9G38VTJMV,B004LROMWU,RedConOne,"[2, 4]","Falling Skies is by far my favorite TV show. While there were moments in its Season 2 that made me question if i would continue to like it. However this review is on Season 1.Falling Skies season one follows the 2nd Mass (namesake from the revolutionary war 2nd Massachusetts Regiment) which is a resistance force fighting the aliens. Specifically it follows primarily Tom Mason (Noah) and his family and close group of friends and his fire team. In Falling Skies aliens arrive at earth and hover high in the air for roughly 29 days refusing to respond to any attempts of communication. Then without any warning they attack. In the first few days they manage to wipe out the majority of earths population. The majority of the earths military forces are wiped out leaving civilians to fight for humanities freedom. The intent and reasons for the attack are unknown, however the aliens do kidnap children (appears children between 9-18 years of age) they proceed to harness them with what the aliens call a ChemLock it is a grub like organism with 12 metallic spikes that bores into the child's spine and grows roots and allows the aliens to control them. This season follows Tom and the battles of the 2nd Mass along with Tom's struggle to find his harnessed middle son, Ben, and dealing with the challenges of the new world.There is plenty of drama in the show that has the potential to reach out and grab you. There are moments where you can really feel for Tom as he struggles to hold everything together. If your someone who has ever felt like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and that you have to hold it all together. Then you can relate to Tom's character. I certainly enjoy the action when it finally arises and the action can be intense for a TV show however relatively short action scenes. But the build up to the firefights can lead for them to be short but intense and emotionally intense. You find yourself rooting for Tom, his fire team, and the 2nd Mass. For a TV show it has a tendency to keep me on the edge of my seat, for example there comes a time when a man who has made a deal with the aliens where he trades kids for amnesty. He tricks the 2nd Mass in turning over their children which he intended to turn over to the aliens. I found myself having butterflies in my stomach as i watched the event occur. Intently watching to see how it would turn out. The show also has this uncanny ability to make you like even the worst or meanest character in the show by giving them a human side that reveals itself every now and then.Another interesting thing to note about Falling Skies is the vast array of firearms they use there is certainly more than just AK47s and M4/M16s. As a 'gun nut' i found it interesting to see how they certainly broke the mold of standard firearms. There was everything from a SIG 552, Mauser Kar98, L1A1's, FN FAL, and a M240B machine gun to name a few (however the M240B is seen in only 3 episodes). Also there were attempts to teach viewers about firearms, specifically the common misconception that a clip is a magazine. Someone who likes guns will certainly be impressed with how they broke the mold that many TV shows go by (only using M4/M16s and AK47s as rifles).If your someone who likes disaster shows/post apocalyptic/science fiction/ war drama then Falling Skies will likely appeal to you. Falling Skies does however sometimes take a while to build up to a action scene which will appeal to those who like drama.Overall Falling Skies gets 5/5 stars. There is plenty of drama that keeps you connected to the characters. They do a good job showing the love characters have for each other and depicting relationships. The show often throws curve balls to the viewers that completely changes things. This will keep you guessing if what you know is actually the truth. The drama will build up to intense action scenes where the fate of a character or the 2ndMass itself relies on winning the battle. For those of you who like firearms like me you enjoy the variety in the show and how they actually try to throw in some real information and educate the viewers. With all this and more going for it makes it hard to say no to such a good show with so much to offer to so many types viewers (for the sake of those who are reading this trying to figure out if they want to buy it i will leave the rest out so i don't spoil the show for them).Without a doubt worth watching and enjoying.",5,Awesome Show,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,4445,"['Falling', 'Skies', 'far', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'were', 'moments', 'Season', '2', 'made', 'question', 'i', 'would', 'continue', 'like', 'However', 'review', 'Season', '1.Falling', 'Skies', 'season', 'one', '2nd', 'Mass', 'namesake', 'revolutionary', 'war', '2nd', 'Massachusetts', 'Regiment', 'resistance', 'force', 'fighting', 'aliens', 'Specifically', 'primarily', 'Tom', 'Mason', 'Noah', 'family', 'close', 'group', 'friends', 'fire', 'team', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'arrive', 'earth', 'hover', 'high', 'air', 'roughly', '29', 'days', 'refusing', 'respond', 'attempts', 'communication', 'Then', 'warning', 'attack', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'manage', 'wipe', 'out', 'majority', 'earths', 'population', 'majority', 'earths', 'military', 'forces', 'are', 'wiped', 'out', 'leaving', 'civilians', 'fight', 'humanities', 'freedom', 'intent', 'reasons', 'attack', 'are', 'unknown', 'however', 'aliens', 'do', 'kidnap', 'children', 'children', '9-18', 'years', 'age', 'proceed', 'harness', 'what', 'aliens', 'call', 'ChemLock', 'grub', 'organism', '12', 'metallic', 'spikes', 'child', 'spine', 'roots', 'aliens', 'control', 'season', 'Tom', 'battles', '2nd', 'Mass', 'Tom', 'struggle', 'find', 'harnessed', 'middle', 'son', 'Ben', 'dealing', 'challenges', 'new', 'world.There', 'plenty', 'drama', 'show', 'potential', 'reach', 'out', 'grab', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'Tom', 'hold', 'everything', 'together', 'someone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'weight', 'world', 'shoulders', 'have', 'hold', 'together', 'Then', 'can', 'relate', 'Tom', 'character', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'action', 'when', 'finally', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'intense', 'TV', 'show', 'however', 'relatively', 'short', 'action', 'scenes', 'build', 'up', 'firefights', 'can', 'lead', 'be', 'short', 'intense', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'find', 'rooting', 'Tom', 'fire', 'team', '2nd', 'Mass', 'TV', 'show', 'tendency', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'example', 'time', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'deal', 'aliens', 'where', 'kids', 'amnesty', '2nd', 'Mass', 'turning', 'over', 'children', 'intended', 'turn', 'over', 'aliens', 'found', 'having', 'butterflies', 'stomach', 'i', 'watched', 'event', 'occur', 'Intently', 'watching', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'show', 'also', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'make', 'even', 'worst', 'meanest', 'character', 'show', 'giving', 'human', 'side', 'now', 'then.Another', 'interesting', 'thing', 'note', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'vast', 'array', 'firearms', 'use', 'certainly', 'more', 'just', 'AK47s', 'M4/M16s', ""'gun"", 'nut', 'i', 'found', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'certainly', 'broke', 'mold', 'standard', 'firearms', 'was', 'everything', 'SIG', '552', 'Mauser', 'Kar98', 'L1A1', 'FN', 'FAL', 'M240B', 'machine', 'gun', 'name', 'few', 'however', 'M240B', 'seen', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'Also', 'were', 'attempts', 'teach', 'viewers', 'firearms', 'specifically', 'common', 'misconception', 'clip', 'magazine', 'Someone', 'who', 'guns', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'broke', 'mold', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'go', 'only', 'using', 'M4/M16s', 'AK47s', 'rifles', '.If', 'someone', 'who', 'disaster', 'shows/post', 'apocalyptic/science', 'fiction/', 'war', 'drama', 'then', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'will', 'likely', 'appeal', 'Falling', 'Skies', 'however', 'sometimes', 'take', 'while', 'build', 'up', 'action', 'scene', 'will', 'appeal', 'who', 'like', 'drama.Overall', 'Falling', 'Skies', '5/5', 'stars', 'plenty', 'drama', 'connected', 'characters', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'love', 'characters', 'have', 'other', 'depicting', 'relationships', 'show', 'often', 'curve', 'balls', 'viewers', 'completely', 'things', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'what', 'know', 'actually', 'truth', 'drama', 'will', 'build', 'up', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'fate', 'character', '2ndMass', 'relies', 'winning', 'battle', 'who', 'firearms', 'enjoy', 'variety', 'show', 'how', 'actually', 'try', 'throw', 'real', 'information', 'educate', 'viewers', 'more', 'going', 'hard', 'say', 'such', 'good', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'so', 'many', 'types', 'viewers', 'sake', 'who', 'are', 'reading', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'want', 'buy', 'i', 'will', 'leave', 'rest', 'so', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'show', 'doubt', 'watching', 'enjoying']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)

The characters are boring and one dimensional. One feels like the writers spun a wheel and decided to stick in every stock character from better shows. You got the idealistic protagonist, the grizzled army commander, the criminal who usually gets the best lines and the innocent kids who are hanging around the story line to be all cute and annoying.None of these characters develop from the first episodes. They simply keep going along from one terrible episode to the next without any level of engagement.However, one should note that the most egregious part of the show is the music cues. This is a show that has decided to pseudo-patriotic music is a substitute for characterization, realistic dialogue, interesting plots or any originality whatsoever. When one knows exactly how the pitch came about (""It's like The Walking Dead, but with aliens and clumsy appeals to patriotism""), it's not a good scene.I tried hard to give this show the benefit of the doubt and even adjust my expectations accordingly (after all it's a show about alien invasion. I shouldn't expect Mad Men) but every time I think I can lower my standards and just accept that this is a dumb show, the show gets even dumber. Lines like ""you drank the Kool Aid"" and ""We gotta hit them with everything they got"" don't belong in dialogue for a show that costs thousands to make with the backing of a network. They belong in self-published novels by teenagers who are trying to break into the place where they are allowed to Star Wars tie-in books.And if you want to know just how bad this show is, consider this - most of the positive reviews are one sentence long and say the same thing.

1414043,A10CR7JQLFS1JS,B004LROMWU,"Silver City Slim ""SCSlim""","[0, 0]","I'm still going through the series. The basis of the storyline is at least plausible at the root - an invading force essentially wipes out America and leaves scattered resistance militias to carry on the fight. Militias are made up of men, women, and teenagers - whoever is capable of using a gun and following tactical orders from the militia command. The aliens have a few decades or a century or so jump on Earth in terms of technology, but they're not invincible - they can be killed with ordinary weapons (even knives, or in one case, a scalpel), their scout/fighter craft can be shot down, and their ""mechs"" (robots) can be handled with heavy machine guns or explosives. The aliens themselves look like something that might be boiled alive and eaten with drawn butter, except that they're pretty big, agile, and physically strong. They are controlled by or answer to manager or executive that is of another species of alien and looks nothing like them. Many commonly-shared societal values are explored, tested, and sometimes bent and pushed to their limits.The only thing I'd like to see improved about the series would be to shoot more daylight scenes. Most of the action takes place in the dark. I guess it's easier (and probably cheaper) to do at night, especially in terms of making the special effects more believable. But watching it on a laptop's LCD display requires a dark room and the screen brightness turned all the way up in order to properly see what's going on.It's one of the better made-for-TV sci-fi shows I've watched in the last few years that kept me wanting to see the next episode. Others have come and gone that didn't do that.Post Script: Watched all episodes of both seasons. As usual, the producers and/or studio decided two seasons were enough and left everyone hanging. They did that with the original Star Trek series on TV and look where that went. Maybe it's time for a ""Falling Skies"" feature length movie.

Like all dystopian sci-fi stories, this struggles to have some relevance to the &#34;real world.&#34; The overall theme of Season 1 is (too) similar to the Walking Dead (there's just a substituting of aliens for zombies) in that the main antagonist is other humans (&#34;man's inhumanity to man&#34;). The alien invaders are almost incidental to the story until the final three episodes.

Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, and broadcast on TNT, this series prominently features minors, and tends to soften the violence, minimize casualties, and tailor the material to be suitable for teens.Much must be taken on faith, beginning with a mysterious invasion by powerful robotic aliens, nicknamed ""skidders"".  These creatures capture children, take over their bodies, and use them to carry out their aims.  Using kids this way, just doesn't seem like the most efficient thing to do, but keeping blinders on your critical eye, often seems necessary, as the societal construct, and the way most characters behave, often seems open to question.The story centers on a group of survivors located near Boston, called the 2nd Massachusetts, a combination of 200 military personnel (""fighters""), and 100 civilians, led by Captain Weaver (Will Patton), who initially seems to resent the civilians.  Tom Mason (Noah Wyle), a former college professor, is second in command, and tasked with overseeing the welfare of the civilians.Focused on securing the basecamp, Weaver and his command, spend the first part of the season doing little fighting.  Instead it is Mason, whose son has been captured by the aliens, and an assortment of soldiers, civilians, and children, who mostly engage the enemy, usually as part of an effort to gather supplies, or rescue lost children.Cable TV has come a long way, but Falling Skies doesn't feature the same level of violence as The Walking Dead.  The numerous fights against CGI aliens, features tons of automatic fire, but with lots of flash and few casualties, the action scenes soon become mostly eye candy.  Interestingly,  most fatalities occur when humans kill each other.Discipline is generally very lax, as following orders often seems ""optional"".  Only when Weaver becomes delusional, does the matter of command really become an issue, for this less than cohesive group.  Their inability to communicate and gather information is a real handicap, and it takes up to Episode 9, for them to finally attempt to attack the enemy.  This effort soon fizzles out, as the season ends on a most intriguing note.Although just a handful of characters are fleshed out, the acting performances are pretty good.  Mason is cast in the superhero role, a fighter, a father, a leader, and perhaps a savior as well.  It's a little too much at times, but Noah Wyle, pulls it off fairly well.  Weaver isn't the ideal leader, but Will Patton brings some gruff humanity to the role.  Colin Cunningham as the renegade Pope, generates internal conflict, and provides some dark humor.  Moon Bloodgood is enjoyable, as the cheerful doctor for the unit.Season One contains only ten episodes, and to the show's credit, the plot generally does move forward during each one, revealing more about a situation that is mostly shrouded in mystery.  What unfolds is a scenario with some cool new elements, as well as some very familiar post apocalyptic themes.  With teens as front line fighters, and PG-13 sensibilities strongly emphasized, Falling Skies aims for a wide audience.  The potential is there for something special, but the writing falters in too many places, as bullets and battles are too often used as a solution.  Falling Skies is entertaining, but its shortcomings make it a frustrating watch at times.

For some reason, every show on the tube has to have some kind of family drama to go along with the lizards, zombies, or whatever is threatening the American ma/pa cohort.  Not to say this does not work for me because I like the Walking Dead.  However, this show spends too much time with trite dad, kid, friend characters that we have seen before and not enough time establishing any interesting alien science.  Walking Dead is grittier with characters that have a complexity far beyond those in this series.  Walking Dead presents a society that is truly dystopian showing us how these characters must change to deal with the new and very horrible world.  The science in that series is also sparse but it fits and enhances character and plot.  This is not happening in Falling Skies.  Nor did it happen in Terra Nova with its obnoxious nuclear family.

Lots of actions - stuff blowing up all the time - and demographics was laid out to make sure they had at least one member in every camp.I give it four stars as opposed to less because of something I learned from my father - a very bright intellectual man who I used to catch watching &#34;Dukes of Hazard&#34;.  When I asked him why he would watch such an IQ draining program (beside Daisy Duke), he replied that somethings it was just great to let things go  and waste a little time with something that demanded nothing from you (as in programs like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad - or Shakespear).

1414115,AP3B615GM191G,B004LROMWU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Despite being a big fan of science-fiction television fare, I never really gave &#34;Falling Skies&#34; much of a chance upon its initial airing.  The main reason?  I'm not into post-apocalyptic drama.  Upon continuous pressuring from family members telling me how much I would like the show, I finally decided to give it a try.  Boy, had I ever been missing some great television.For a basic plot summary, this first season of &#34;Falling Skies&#34; introduces a group of survivors from the Massachusetts area who are engaged in a war with alien creatures that are trying to colonize planet Earth.  The aliens (primarily mechanical robots--Mechs--and spiderlike crawlies---Skitters--) always seem to have the upper hand, and it looks grim for the survivors.  Yet, as we get to know this band of resistance fighters, we discover that they have quite a human spirit burning inside them and will do whatever it takes to survive and endure.Though the post-apocalyptic setting initially turned me off, rest assured that it is only in setting.  &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is really a show that focuses on the &#34;human element&#34; of the drama, featuring strong characters and many moral situations that must be faced in the wake of the alien attack.  Some of my favorite moments/characters from this first season include:-Tom Mason (Noah Wyle), who could be consider the somewhat-central character of the show.  A former schoolteacher now thrust into very much a military role, it is interesting to see how Tom adapts to this &#34;new society&#34; while still retaining the lessons of the past.  Tom's relationship with sons Hal (Drew Roy), Ben (Connor Jessup), and Matt (Maxim Knight) also provide some great drama as he must balance his love for them with their usefulness to the war effort.-Captain Weaver (Will Patton), commander of the military forces.  Over the course of this first season, his character easily makes the most dramatic strides.  What you think might be a cardboard, one-dimensional character turns out to be the exact opposite!-Pope (Colin Cunningham), a drifter who pledges loyalty to no man but himself.  Provides an interesting perspective on how certain individuals could interpret a world catastrophe.Basically, what it comes down to is that I never should have doubted a show executive produced by Steven Spielberg.  &#34;Falling Skies&#34; features come of the greatest science fiction scenarios ever put to screen, while also balancing out that action and unique scenarios with incredible human drama as well.  With only ten episodes this season, the action has to (and does) steadily progress in order to get anything accomplished.  Even though that seems like a relatively short run-time, a remarkable amount of character development and plot progression occurs from episode one through episode ten.I compare &#34;Falling Skies&#34; very favorably to the remake of &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34;.  Both shows touch on very, very similar themes, but while BSG did it in space, FS is grounded here on Earth.  I will hit Season Two off and running as soon as I can!",5,More Than Meets The Eye,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,3091,"['being', 'big', 'fan', 'science-fiction', 'television', 'fare', 'never', 'really', 'gave', '34', 'Falling', 'Skies', '34', 'much', 'chance', 'initial', 'airing', 'main', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'post-apocalyptic', 'drama', 'continuous', 'pressuring', 'family', 'members', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'show', 'finally', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Boy', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'missing', 'great', 'television.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'first', 'season', '34', 'Falling', 'Skies', '34', 'introduces', 'group', 'survivors', 'Massachusetts', 'area', 'who', 'are', 'engaged', 'war', 'alien', 'creatures', 'are', 'trying', 'colonize', 'planet', 'Earth', 'aliens', 'primarily', 'mechanical', 'robots', 'Mechs', 'spiderlike', 'crawlies', '-Skitters', 'always', 'seem', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'grim', 'survivors', 'Yet', 'get', 'know', 'band', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'discover', 'have', 'quite', 'human', 'spirit', 'burning', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'survive', 'post-apocalyptic', 'setting', 'initially', 'turned', 'off', 'rest', 'assured', 'only', 'setting', '34', 'Falling', 'Skies', '34', 'really', 'show', '34', 'human', 'element', '34', 'drama', 'featuring', 'strong', 'characters', 'many', 'moral', 'situations', 'must', 'be', 'faced', 'wake', 'alien', 'attack', 'favorite', 'moments/characters', 'first', 'season', 'include', '-Tom', 'Mason', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'consider', 'somewhat-central', 'character', 'show', 'former', 'schoolteacher', 'now', 'very', 'much', 'military', 'role', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Tom', '34', 'new', 'society', '34', 'still', 'retaining', 'lessons', 'past', 'Tom', 'relationship', 'sons', 'Hal', 'Drew', 'Roy', 'Ben', 'Connor', 'Jessup', 'Matt', 'Maxim', 'Knight', 'also', 'provide', 'great', 'drama', 'must', 'balance', 'love', 'usefulness', 'war', 'effort.-Captain', 'Weaver', 'Will', 'Patton', 'commander', 'military', 'forces', 'course', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'easily', 'most', 'dramatic', 'strides', 'What', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'cardboard', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'exact', 'opposite', '-Pope', 'Colin', 'Cunningham', 'drifter', 'who', 'loyalty', 'man', 'Provides', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'how', 'certain', 'individuals', 'could', 'interpret', 'world', 'catastrophe.Basically', 'what', 'down', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'doubted', 'show', 'executive', 'produced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', '34', 'Falling', 'Skies', '34', 'features', 'come', 'greatest', 'science', 'fiction', 'scenarios', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'also', 'balancing', 'out', 'action', 'unique', 'scenarios', 'incredible', 'human', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'ten', 'season', 'action', 'steadily', 'progress', 'order', 'get', 'anything', 'accomplished', 'Even', 'relatively', 'short', 'run-time', 'remarkable', 'amount', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'progression', 'episode', 'one', 'episode', 'ten.I', 'compare', '34', 'Falling', 'Skies', '34', 'very', 'favorably', 'remake', '34', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', '34', 'shows', 'touch', 'very', 'very', 'similar', 'themes', 'BSG', 'did', 'space', 'FS', 'grounded', 'here', 'Earth', 'will', 'hit', 'Season', 'Two', 'running', 'as', 'soon', 'can']",Falling Skies: S1 (DVD)
