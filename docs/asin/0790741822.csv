Fairbanks""","[0, 0]","A road movie for the fairer sex, ""Boys on the Side"" is helped immeasurably by the performances of Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore, and Whoopi Goldberg. The latter plays a lesbian nightclub singer (!) who agrees to share the wheel with repressed, straight-laced Parker on a trip to San Diego. Following a serious misadventure with her drug pusher boyfriend, the still pixy-ish  Barrymore joins the journey.""Boys on the Side"" is as contrived as a soap opera with each character facing a personal crisis, but the three stars are so good, it's easy to overlook the frequently smarmy plot developments and enjoy the performances. Parker is particularly good, especially when she unwinds by lip-synching to Elvis Presley's ""Jailhouse Rock."" The soundtrack is nicely compiled, too, and features performances by the likes of Sarah McLachlan, Bonnie Raitt, The Indigo Girls, and Annie Lennox.Brian W.

109346,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0790741822,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","Boys on the Side tantalizes with an intriguing cast and concept. Though you might get to see a little bit of what Letterman saw on his birthday, mostly the movie doesn't deliver.What you do get is kind of a female buddy/road picture that morphs into an AIDS picture. It takes that and the other serious issue of domestic violence, but doesn't really handle either one well. Still, there are some surprising and unexpected moments that do work, and it is hard not to like Drew Barrymore, even if the movie is not so great. When BOTS gets all serious, it really bogs down. Robin (Mary-Louise Parker) speaks in such a low whisper that you can't even hear what she is saying. Hasn't she ever heard of a stage whisper? Everything gets much too serious. In the film's beginning Robin really did a great job of negotiating between Holly Pulchik (Drew Barrymore) and her drug dealing boyfriend, Nick, (Billy Wirth). It was a surprising scene, a positive take on Real Estate agents, and Mary-Louise really closed the deal. But like an agent who closes a deal and then lets it fester in escrow and won't return your calls, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the promise of the beginning.Jane Deluca (Whoopi Goldberg) is a rock singer and in the opening she sings Piece of My Heart. I like her version better than Faith Hill's because she at least had heard the original by Janis Joplin and was striving for a similar effect, unlike Faith who hadn't heard it and didn't care.There is another scene where Jane gets a piano and uses it to serenade Robin with Superstar, the Leon Russell song that was a hit for Karen Carpenter. Whoopi does it very well, not technically, as it is rather fragile, but all the more heartfelt for being so. It is touching because earlier Robin confessed to singing Carpenters songs and was met with a cynical rolling of the eyes. It reminded me of where Whitney Houston sang I Will Always Love You to Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard after having heard the original Dolly Parton version on a juke box in a country western bar.Drew Barrymore is not beautiful but she is cute as a button and her winning personality warms the cockles of my heart. I hear she is heading up a new project about roller derby girls, and has already gotten loads of talent on board.Whoopi is now on The View, and is really a diplomat. Unlike Rosie or even the Whoopi of recent past, she is very respectful of others views and perspectives. What happened? She is kind of the buffer zone now. Whoopi cushion?Mary-Louise Parker was just in the smash hit, Sex in the City. Wait, that was Sarah Jessica Parker. Never mind.The movie made me think of a million things, but if I followed all the tangents to their illogical conclusions, we'll be here all week. Or I will, as you will have clicked on another link long ago.10 Films Featuring Whoopi, Drew, and Mary-LouiseGirl, Interrupted(1999) .... Valerie Owens, RN was portrayed by Whoopi.How Stella Got Her Groove Back(1998) .... Delilah Abraham was Whoopi.Ghost(1990) .... Oda Mae Brown was a role that won an Oscar for Whoopi.The Color Purple(1985) .... Celie Johnson was also played by Whoopi, and she was nominated for an Oscar for her leading role.Naked in New York(1993) .... Joanne White was played by Mary-Louise, and Whoopi was Tragedy Mask on Theater Wall.Fried Green Tomatoes (Widescreen Collector's Edition)(1991) .... Ruth Jamison was played by Mary-Louise Parker.Charlie's Angels (Special Edition)(2000) .... Dylan Sanders was played by Drew. Very bad, but watchable if only for Drew and Lucy Liu. Ditto squared for Full Throttle.Riding in Cars with Boys (Special Edition)(2001) .... Beverly Donofrio was Drew. How about Riding in Cars with Boys on the Side?Poison Ivy(1992) .... Ivy as played by Drew was really poison, but HOT poison.The Wedding Singer - Totally Awesome Edition(1998) .... Julia was Drew and Adam Sandler was the Wedding Singer. Totally awesome chemistry. Don't like Sandler's comedy style but here it was totally awesome, the exception to the fool.One last quote, Robin and Holly discussing the folly of gays falling for straights and Jane's lost, last love:Robin: But this person who dumped her, she was gay, right?Holly: Yeah, but even with gay girls there are no guarantees. They're very emotional. That's about all I know. They love uniforms and don't break their hearts.Robin: Uniforms?Holly: Oh, yeah, all kinds.

Maybe there are some of you guys out there reading this who'll disagree. Feel free to chime in, preferably in the comments section.This is one of my favorite films but it is the kind of film that is a guilty pleasure. I can't seem to avoid watching it when I catch it on television but I am always left wondering WHY I find it so addictive.Is it because of Mary Louise Parker, an actress some can't stand but who I find to be both quirky and charming, with her performances in Fried Green Tomatoes, Angels in America and this film (Boys on the Side)? Looking as frail as she often does, with a face that isn't classically beautiful, she is a walking poster for someone needing help although she is spunky and stubborn enough to not seem totally pathetic?But I don't think that is the whole reason I'm drawn to this film. Perhaps it is it the wild series of events, however improbable, that get me to both laugh, mostly at Drew Barrymore who can wring the comedy out of every moment, however sad.There are moments in this film that also make me teary (won't say why, no spoilers here). Drew Barrymore is just so irreverent when it comes to her very disorganized, chaotic life and her romantic issues. Not surprisingly, she doesn't just skirt the law, she practically raises her shirt (as she did on David Letterman) and displays her assets to the world.Whoopie Goldberg is in fine form, too, generally unflappable and adding some great heart to this film, the main nurturer and caretaker of the group. Anyway, this movie always hooks me, like some fish destined for dinner.P.S. On a totally unrelated note, I find the closing scene of Three Days of the Condor, with Max Von Sydow, to be just as addictive. ""It will happen like this..."" he says, almost as though he were reciting poetry and them speaks so softly of a terrible day to come, in the most soothing and practical tones imaginable.

The movie opens with Whoopi Goldberg as a musician in a club with not a lot of appreciation. When a member of her band realizes the club doesnt want them to perform there anymore, she realizes she needs a different plan. With her stubborn humor and her way or the highway attitude, she goes it alone. She answers an ad by Mary Louise Parker to drive cross country to California where both women plan to start a different existence, for very different reasons. Along the way, Whoopi Goldberg wants to check in on her friend Drew Barrymore, who is being abused by her no good drug dealing and using boyfriend.Surprises along the way make you bond with all of the characters for different reasons. Robin (Mary Louise Parker) is likeable for the same reason that Charlotte was likeable for sex and the city. She is a perfectionist, everything needs a plan, and she has high hopes for the future. Holly (Drew Barrymore) is very flirtatious and young and sexy in her prime. While she wallows for her boyfriend that she left behind, she realizes what else life has in store for her. Whoopi Goldberg (Jane) is kind of like the parental unit that holds it all together.

Having seen 'The Opposite of Sex' and 'Diabolique' though, I'm impressed with Dan Roos' attention to his characeters. Each of the three leads here sports a maverick and perhaps even borderline controversial touch but turns in a performance that is so invested and heartfelt you wonder if this did not truly happen.Lest that sound serious/sentimental, this is a comic character study of three bosom pals (fitting expression in this case given the gender) who set off on a road trip following what they thought was a murder they inadvertently committed. They meet nutcases and nitwits on the way, befriending some, avoiding others.Sounds like a light vein, not to mention the frivolous title, but the film has its heart in the right place and depths that are not immediately obvious.

The one who answers her ad is a dred-lock-wearing black lesbian (played masterfully by Whoopi Goldberg)... and both are a little startled by each other and how contrasting their lives are. Parker is slightly horrified that her traveling companion is gay and Goldberg is very horrified that she's going to be trapped in a car for over a week with this psycho, anal woman.Goldberg's character makes a quick diversion to visit a friend (Drew Barrymore) and a crazy turn of events puts Barrymore in the van with Goldberg and Parker.The three of them all have skeletons in their closets and all sorts of emotional baggage that they have not dealt with, much less shared with anyone else. This dynamic mix of diverse personalities is first a cauldron of irritation, frustration and prejudices, but together the women face some crazy circumstances that bring them together.It turns out they all have much more in common than they realized.  There are very touching scenes where only the most stone-hearted individual will not feel a crack in their throat... and there are scenes that will make you laugh so hard, you might just lose bladder control.Themes include family, loyalty, race, bigotry, domestic violence, unrequited love, romance, loss, terminal illness and death.  This may seem like a lot of themes for just one movie, but the film is so real, you feel like you're one of the girls in the van, hanging out with them. They become your friends and you quickly bond with them. The film was directed by Herbert Ross who is known for directing ""Steel Magnolias."" This film is just as powerful, if not more so.My less than perfect rating is due to the lack of extras on the DVD.  How about interviews with the director and the cast? Trailers?

109382,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,0790741822,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 1]","Herbert Ross' ""Boys on the Side"" is a road trip film with a different perspective.  In the cinematic world, the road trip film typically revolves around a gang of friends who hit the road hoping to find their true calling along the way.  There are highs and lows during this voyage of discovery, but ultimately matters end on a generally positive note.  Not so with this film.  ""Boys on the Side"" is a road trip film with such a depressing low at its conclusion that any joy found along the way is seriously muted.Jane Deluca (Whoopi Goldberg) decides to head west after she loses her job in New York.  She hooks up with Robin (Mary-Louise Parker) who is heading the same way and wants to share the driving with someone else.  The pair picks up a third traveler in Pittsburgh when Jane's friend Holly Pulchik (Drew Barrymore) joins the westward trek in order to escape her abusive boyfriend Nick (Billy Wirth).  Along the way there are a series of revelations with one in particular leading to a painful loss.""Boys on the Side"" is a film with the dramatic twists and turns of a soap opera.  However, it fares much better in comparison because of the higher quality of acting and the more mature approach to the material.  The whimsical interaction between the three women is a joy to watch as Goldberg, Parker, and Barrymore light up the screen from start to finish.  Parker's performance is especially powerful and will most likely be the one aspect of the film that will continue to linger in your thoughts after it concludes.  ""Boys on the Side"" is about the strong bond of friendship and how this strong bond helps friends to deal with the sad realization that life is difficult and unfair.  It is not the easiest film to sit through but it is a rewarding experience for those that manage to do so.",3,"&quot;I do the best I can, honey.&quot;",1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,1802,"['Herbert', 'Ross', 'Boys', 'Side', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'different', 'perspective', 'cinematic', 'world', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'typically', 'gang', 'friends', 'who', 'hit', 'road', 'hoping', 'find', 'true', 'calling', 'way', 'are', 'highs', 'lows', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'ultimately', 'matters', 'end', 'generally', 'positive', 'note', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'Boys', 'Side', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'depressing', 'low', 'conclusion', 'joy', 'found', 'way', 'seriously', 'muted.Jane', 'Deluca', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'head', 'west', 'job', 'New', 'York', 'up', 'Robin', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'who', 'heading', 'same', 'way', 'share', 'driving', 'someone', 'else', 'pair', 'up', 'third', 'traveler', 'Pittsburgh', 'when', 'Jane', 'friend', 'Holly', 'Pulchik', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'westward', 'trek', 'order', 'escape', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Nick', 'Billy', 'Wirth', 'way', 'are', 'series', 'revelations', 'one', 'particular', 'leading', 'painful', 'loss', 'Boys', 'Side', 'film', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'turns', 'soap', 'opera', 'However', 'much', 'better', 'comparison', 'higher', 'quality', 'acting', 'more', 'mature', 'approach', 'material', 'whimsical', 'interaction', 'three', 'women', 'joy', 'watch', 'Goldberg', 'Parker', 'Barrymore', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'start', 'finish', 'Parker', 'performance', 'especially', 'powerful', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'linger', 'thoughts', 'Boys', 'Side', 'strong', 'bond', 'friendship', 'how', 'strong', 'bond', 'deal', 'sad', 'realization', 'life', 'difficult', 'unfair', 'not', 'easiest', 'film', 'sit', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'manage', 'do', 'so']",N/A
