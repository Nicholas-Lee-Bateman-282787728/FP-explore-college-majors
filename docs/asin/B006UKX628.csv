This is a classic case of right/wrong casting choices and the impact it has on a popular show. I would like to point out that I am in no way blaming Julia Duffy for this. She is an extremely talented actress and did her best with what she was given. I think the problem was The producers wanted to clone Suzanne/Delta Burke. In hindsight, they are probably wishing they had just worked out their differences with Delta. The new character of Allison had all of the negative characteristics/traits of Suzanne. She was vain, selfish, self-centered, shallow and very politically incorrect. However, she lacked the lovability that Delta Burke brought to the role of Suzanne Sugarbaker. It was easy to forgive Suzanne's shortcomings because she still lovable. The viewers were given the impression that Suzanne was just a naive former beauty queen who did not know any better, and at the end of the day she had a huge heart. Allison never clicked this way with viewers. She was smarter than Suzanne so it was harder for the viewers to write off her negative quips as anything, but bitchy and hateful. The bottom line is the writers were obviously trying to find another ""Suzanne"" and hoped the viewers would not know the difference.One the other hand, Jan Hooks' as ""Carlene"" was a winner. She was Charlene's sister, so she had the same values, morals and even accent as Charlene. However, she had enough individuality that she was able to forge her own identity on the show. Still, one has to wonder where she was when Charlene would talk about her three sisters, Darlene, Marlene and Harlene (I think was the third one?) If you are buying the entire series, you'll want to get this one to complete your collection. If you are only buy the best seasons, stick with 1 through 5 and maybe 7. I love Judith Ivey, but she is still no Delta Burke! I think Delta's series ""Women of the House"" would have done better if they had spun off Suzanne into her own series while Designing Women was still on the air. Too much time had passed and Delta had another series in the interim. I read and article once where Jean Smart said she would only consider coming back to Designing Women if Delta Burke came back. I have to agree with her. I always thought Delta's departure has something to do with Jean Smart leaving that same season.",3,She Was No Suzanne!!!!,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2400,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'season', '6', 'Designing', 'Women', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'classic', 'case', 'right/wrong', 'casting', 'choices', 'impact', 'popular', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'am', 'way', 'blaming', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actress', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'think', 'problem', 'was', 'producers', 'wanted', 'clone', 'Suzanne/Delta', 'Burke', 'hindsight', 'are', 'probably', 'wishing', 'had', 'just', 'worked', 'out', 'differences', 'Delta', 'new', 'character', 'Allison', 'had', 'negative', 'characteristics/traits', 'Suzanne', 'was', 'vain', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'shallow', 'very', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'However', 'lacked', 'lovability', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'brought', 'role', 'Suzanne', 'Sugarbaker', 'was', 'easy', 'forgive', 'Suzanne', 'shortcomings', 'still', 'lovable', 'viewers', 'were', 'given', 'impression', 'Suzanne', 'was', 'just', 'naive', 'former', 'beauty', 'queen', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'better', 'end', 'day', 'had', 'huge', 'heart', 'Allison', 'never', 'clicked', 'way', 'viewers', 'was', 'smarter', 'Suzanne', 'was', 'harder', 'viewers', 'write', 'off', 'negative', 'quips', 'anything', 'bitchy', 'hateful', 'bottom', 'line', 'writers', 'were', 'obviously', 'trying', 'find', 'Suzanne', 'hoped', 'viewers', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'difference.One', 'other', 'hand', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'Carlene', 'was', 'winner', 'was', 'Charlene', 'sister', 'had', 'same', 'values', 'morals', 'even', 'accent', 'Charlene', 'However', 'had', 'enough', 'individuality', 'was', 'able', 'forge', 'own', 'identity', 'show', 'Still', 'wonder', 'where', 'was', 'when', 'Charlene', 'would', 'talk', 'three', 'sisters', 'Darlene', 'Marlene', 'Harlene', 'think', 'was', 'third', 'one', 'are', 'buying', 'entire', 'series', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'one', 'complete', 'collection', 'are', 'only', 'buy', 'best', 'seasons', 'stick', '1', '5', 'maybe', '7', 'love', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'still', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'think', 'Delta', 'series', 'Women', 'House', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'had', 'spun', 'off', 'Suzanne', 'own', 'series', 'Designing', 'Women', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'had', 'passed', 'Delta', 'had', 'series', 'interim', 'read', 'article', 'once', 'where', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'said', 'would', 'only', 'consider', 'coming', 'back', 'Designing', 'Women', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'came', 'back', 'have', 'agree', 'always', 'thought', 'Delta', 'departure', 'something', 'do', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'leaving', 'same', 'season']",N/A

But since it changed, let's take a look at season six.The cast acquired Julia Duffy as cousin Allison and Jan Hooks as Charlene's sister Carlene(funny, Carlene was not one of the sisters in Season One...but now appears. Something like Rhoda, who had a sister named Brenda but on MTM had a sister named Debbie). Most people I talked to always put the blame on Duffy. Why? She was perfect! I totally believed Allison Sugarbaker to be 'real' and very funny. I found the fault to be with the Carlene character, played by Jan Hooks. What were the writers thinking? For five seasons, we were drawned to Designing Women because we cared about the characters. Now is season 6, we have 4 characters + 1 caricature. The writers didn't seem to know how to make Carlene a 'real' person. This, to me, was the start of Designing Women's downfall. (The other would be in season 7 marrying Anthony).In spite of the shortcomings, season six has some very funny and poignant episodes involving Julia, Mary Jo and (yes) Allison!",4,Don't Blame Julia (Duffy),1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,1082,"['true', 'Designing', 'Women', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'changed', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'season', 'six.The', 'cast', 'acquired', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'cousin', 'Allison', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'Charlene', 'sister', 'Carlene', 'funny', 'Carlene', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'sisters', 'Season', 'One', 'now', 'Something', 'Rhoda', 'who', 'had', 'sister', 'named', 'Brenda', 'MTM', 'had', 'sister', 'named', 'Debbie', 'Most', 'people', 'talked', 'always', 'put', 'blame', 'Duffy', 'Why', 'was', 'perfect', 'totally', 'believed', 'Allison', 'Sugarbaker', 'be', ""'real"", 'very', 'funny', 'found', 'fault', 'be', 'Carlene', 'character', 'played', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'What', 'were', 'writers', 'thinking', 'five', 'seasons', 'were', 'drawned', 'Designing', 'Women', 'cared', 'characters', 'Now', 'season', '6', 'have', '4', 'characters', '+', '1', 'caricature', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'Carlene', ""'real"", 'person', 'was', 'start', 'Designing', 'Women', 'downfall', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'season', '7', 'marrying', 'Anthony', '.In', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'season', 'six', 'very', 'funny', 'poignant', 'episodes', 'involving', 'Julia', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'yes', 'Allison']",N/A

1520057,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B006UKX628,Kasey G,"[27, 31]","During the summer of 1991, ""Designing Women"" was riding high in the Nielsens with its biggest ratings ever due to all the publicity the show was receiving in the tabloids after the dismissal of Delta Burke. After much speculation about her successor, it was revealed that Julia Duffy (having recently come off a 7-season stint as spoiled Stephanie on ""Newhart"") would be her replacement. At the time the producers were quoted as saying ""There are very few actresses who can play spoiled, stuffy characters without making you hate them...and Julia Duffy is one of those few"". That statement was spot-on and viewers had their hopes as high as the Thomasons that the show would continue to enchant audiences. ""Saturday Night Live"" alumna Jan Hooks would be taking over for Jean Smart, who's departure was so overshadowed by Delta's, it practically slipped under everyone's radar and was hardly mentioned.The hour-long season-premiere on September 16, 1991 titled ""The Big Desk"" generated such buzz it brought in viewers by the millions and was only bested by the season-premiere of lead-in ""Murphy Brown"". The episode was brilliantly-written to introduce the two new characters as well as send-off Jean Smart, whose promises to return for guest spots never materialized.Thank God for Shout Factory! I was worried they would stop after Season 5 but bless their little hearts, they have come through with the Season I have been waiting for most of all. With Pam Norris still producing, the vibe is very similar to Season 5 despite the cast changes. Although some of the writing is a little weaker in spots, the delivery and comic timing of all the actresses is impeccable, and I found myself laughing out loud many times over the course of these 23 episodes.Julia Duffy does her best with a difficult role. The writers basically painted themselves into a corner by giving cousin Allison Sugarbaker the dreaded Obnoxious Personality Disorder then expecting Duffy to win over audiences. Jan Hooks had a much easier time of it as the naive, sometimes unknowingly tactless Carlene. But if nothing else, Bernice (Alice Ghostley) gets more screen time than ever this season and begins bellowing her signature song at Anthony every opportunity she gets (""Black Man, Black Man...Wherrrrre did you come from?"").Some of the best episodes this season include ""All About Odes to Atlanta"" where Carlene enters a singing contest and acquires a needy groupie named Heather; ""Mamed"" has Anthony casting Julia as Auntie Mame in a community theatre production that features a hilarious guest spot by Gretchen Wyler; Anthony's infamous former cellmate T. Tommy Reed takes a shine to Allison when the ladies partake in a prison outreach program in ""Last Tango In Atlanta""; Jackee appears as Anthony's new squeeze, sassy Vanessa Chamberlain in ""Shades of Vanessa""; and ""The Strange Case of Clarence (Thomas) and Anita (Hill)"" though now dated--features what may be the fastest reaction to current events a scripted TV show ever managed to pull off.I'm nitpicking and don't mean to sound like an ingrate, but to die-hard fans, the cover art looks a little odd since it features Season 1 shots of Carter and Potts mixed in with Sixth Season shots of Duffy and Hooks. But I'm so glad Shout is delivering the goods with one of my favorite seasons, I'll forgive them!If you look at Season 6 as a whole new show and forget what Delta and Jean Smart brought to the table, you'll be surprised how much fun these episodes are. Anyone who was turned off by the topical women's issues this show preached during its earlier seasons will probably like this incarnation better since the comedy is front and center. Also, for all the hate spewed towards this season, it should be noted that more people watched these episodes of ""Designing Women"" than any of the ones with the original cast. The series reached at an all-time peak in the ratings during 1991-92, coming in at #6 among all programs on the air--ironic!Kudos to Shout Factory because ""The Big Desk"" is presented in its original hour-long format, not split into two parts as it was in syndication. Also, some episodes featured original classic '60s songs such as ""It's My Party"" and ""When Will I Be Loved"" over the closing credits and they appear intact here.

1520065,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B006UKX628,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[1, 1]","OVERVIEWDesigning Women was one of those shows that was so funny that it seemed it would never end. This statement was questioned in 1991, when the series started its sixth season. Many fans will remember the controversy that surrounded the firing of Delta Burke, who was credited as being the sitcom's breakout star; and also the dismissal of Jean Smart, who wanted to move on with her career. To fell the void, producers brought in Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks as their replacements beginning in the sixth season.MY REVIEWBefore I purchased season six of Designing Women, I had read and heard from others that I would be disappointed. Online fan clubs and so forth encouraged me to stop ordering seasons after season five. Being a die-hard fan of Delta Burke's Suzanne Sugarbaker, I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue with the series anyways. But I decided it would be stupid not to complete the series, with only two seasons left to order. When season six finally arrived, I was nervous and anxious about the outcome of the first episode, ""The Big Desk"", which was surprisingly very entertaining and hilariously funny.From what I have gathered from Designing Women's sixth season is: the previous reviews were far too harsh and bullheaded. The main complaint in the reviews I've read was the addition of Julia Duffy as the snobby Allison. Many reportedly accepted Jan Hooks as Carlene.Personally, I don't find Allison that bad. Yes, she is snobby and somewhat unlikable, but that does not need to be blamed on Julia Duffy. Her humor is more self-centered, but that's the way the writers wrote her, not the way Julia Duffy played her. In my personal opinion, Duffy as Allison has a hard-bitten humor, which is overly funny, or it does for me, anyways. Jan Hooks was cited as an ""okay"" addition, due to previous popularity on Saturday Night Live, and she is the ideal successor to Jean Smart's down-to-Earth, sweet-natured humor.To be honest, I don't think the addition of Julia Duffy or Jan Hooks necessarily hurt Designing Women, I just think the show was getting ""tired"", like most shows do after some time. Critics cited that the sixth season of Designing Women had ""jumped the shark"" and I somewhat agree. When a show goes through the abrupt changes Designing Women went through in 1991, it never really recovers. Stories thereafter are usually more outlandish and more unrealistic than they have been before. Season Six of Designing Women follows this formula, but it's still a good piece of entertainment. This season of Designing Women made me think: How often do replacements work on TV shows anyways? Not very often. The originals are always the best. There have been some ""smooth"" replacements in TV history, such as Cheryl Ladd entering Charlie's Angels and Don Knotts coming on Three's Company, but the majority of replacements are disastrous.Season six is not bad. While it is less creative than earlier years, it is definitely not as bad as others have made it out to be. Season six was like a whole new show of some sort. The writers were trying to strict the legs of there two new actresses, but were eventually defeated by it. However, unlike most, I don't think season seven is any better. Judith Ivey was not better than Julia Duffy. Sorry. If it had been my choice, Julia Duffy would have stayed and Judith Ivey could have become another silly supporting character, much like Bernice.
