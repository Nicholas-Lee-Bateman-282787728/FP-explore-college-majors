Some of the things in the movie didn't happen, and it was more of a nod to the movies more so than the novels. One thing that is a running gag in the movie is a hat always being thrown on the hat rack, which never actually happens in the novels. So, a lot of people would believe that is what inspired it, but it is just a joke to the movie. Still, it is fun to watch and is very entertaining. The sad thing is, I have never heard of Jason Connery doing anything recently, which is a shame.",5,Fun Movie,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,571,"['movie', 'Bond', 'fans', 'have', 'see', 'nice', 'collectable', 'own', 'things', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', 'more', 'nod', 'movies', 'more', 'so', 'novels', 'One', 'thing', 'running', 'gag', 'movie', 'hat', 'always', 'being', 'thrown', 'hat', 'rack', 'never', 'actually', 'novels', 'So', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'believe', 'what', 'inspired', 'just', 'joke', 'movie', 'Still', 'fun', 'watch', 'very', 'entertaining', 'sad', 'thing', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'doing', 'anything', 'recently', 'shame']",Spymaker: The Secret Life of Ian Fleming [VHS]

It has all the action of any of Connery's Bond films, as many beautiful women, and a touching love story on top of all that.  Pity it's not available on DVD, but Bond fans are a different lot these days, and the widows haven't made a Bond film even close to Fleming's character in twenty years.

967801,A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP,B000E56Q7W,"Sebastian Sanjurjo ""mr.movie expert""","[0, 0]","Never had it crossed my mind that Ian Fleming himself was once an agent himself. After viewing this neat TV movie it doesn't surprise me how Fleming was inspired to create his literary hero, soon to become cinematic emblem.The movie begins with the origin of young Ian Fleming, he was a son of rich parents, he never needed anything, and everything was at his disposal. As we see him transcend to young adulthood we see a very similar persona to that of 007. We see him as a womanizer and a man of wit and class. shortly in the film he is expelled from various private schools due to misadventures with women. His mother decides to put him in a military academy so he can learn a lesson...he ends up doing the same thing; finally his mother decides to put him in a news bureau known as Reuters. While working there he finally accommodates and begins to take his life a bit more seriously.Trough the picture we see him transform from a young aristocrat into a secret agent spying on the Soviet Union; and the best part of all this is the actor they chose for the part, Jason Connery. Jason Connery is Sean Connery's son; Sean was the first theatrical actor to play 007. Here his son brings the exact class style and vulnerability of his father. Like they say like father like son.Now the movie is not without being criticized, the movie in the end is more fantasy than fact. Sure many of the things mentioned in the film did occur according to his biographies and interviews but in the end the movie represents a fictionalized version of his life. now that does not mean the movie is not worth it, on the contraire it's highly worth it, due it's story, trauma and the amazing love story between Fleming and a fellow agent. Overall the movie is highly recommended. it's unfortunate that is only available on VHS; and not to mention that it has long since been out of print. I'm sure you can still find good copies here at Amazon for a fare price.MY PERSONAL RAITNG: 3  OUT OF 5",4,Interesting Look At The Life Of The Creator Of the Most Popular Secret Agent,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,1975,"['Never', 'had', 'crossed', 'mind', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'was', 'once', 'agent', 'viewing', 'neat', 'TV', 'movie', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'how', 'Fleming', 'was', 'inspired', 'create', 'literary', 'hero', 'soon', 'become', 'cinematic', 'emblem.The', 'movie', 'origin', 'young', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'was', 'son', 'rich', 'parents', 'never', 'needed', 'anything', 'everything', 'was', 'disposal', 'see', 'transcend', 'young', 'adulthood', 'see', 'very', 'similar', 'persona', '007', 'see', 'womanizer', 'man', 'wit', 'class', 'shortly', 'film', 'expelled', 'various', 'private', 'schools', 'due', 'misadventures', 'women', 'mother', 'put', 'military', 'academy', 'can', 'learn', 'lesson', 'up', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'finally', 'mother', 'put', 'news', 'bureau', 'known', 'Reuters', 'working', 'there', 'finally', 'take', 'life', 'bit', 'more', 'picture', 'see', 'transform', 'young', 'aristocrat', 'secret', 'agent', 'spying', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'best', 'part', 'actor', 'chose', 'part', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'son', 'Sean', 'was', 'first', 'theatrical', 'actor', 'play', '007', 'Here', 'son', 'exact', 'class', 'style', 'vulnerability', 'father', 'say', 'father', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'criticized', 'movie', 'end', 'more', 'fantasy', 'fact', 'Sure', 'many', 'things', 'mentioned', 'film', 'did', 'occur', 'according', 'biographies', 'interviews', 'end', 'movie', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'life', 'now', 'not', 'mean', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'contraire', 'highly', 'worth', 'due', 'story', 'trauma', 'amazing', 'love', 'story', 'Fleming', 'fellow', 'agent', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'unfortunate', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'not', 'mention', 'long', 'been', 'print', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'good', 'copies', 'here', 'Amazon', 'fare', 'price.MY', 'PERSONAL', 'RAITNG', '3', 'OUT', '5']",Spymaker: The Secret Life of Ian Fleming [VHS]

Having said that, it isn't so obvious and imposing in this film. This fun, period jape of a movie supposedly tells the story of Ian Flemming and how he came to devise the ingenious Bond character we all know today. For sure, the Casino Royale references are obvious (although I hate the comedy version of James Bond in the Peter Sellers version - utter garbage!) and there are other little tidbits of 'Bond' especially at the begining. This is a fun movie to watch, but I feel this is more of a romatic view of Ian Flemming, with a lot of 'poetic licence' taken. What the hell, it is a lot of fun. The period sets and acting - very stiff-upper-lip-British, old boy - is spot on. Fact or fiction?
