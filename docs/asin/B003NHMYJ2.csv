It was awkward at first but once you get in to the story with the voice acting, it's actually quite cool. It's amazing how they can take the exact comic artwork and sort of bring it to life. Joss Whedon's X-Men run is absolutely amazing. I hope they put the rest of his run in this motion format because I'll buy it immediately.

If you are looking for an X Men movie with more mature subject matter this is in your wheelhouse. The movie is done as a motion comic which views basically as a comic panel with the motion consisting of lips moving (like a dubbed movie) or some body parts moving but NOT full animation. I was hesitant at first but when you watch the movie after a while the story takes over and you forget about the motion. (In fact I bought the next 2 titles, Dangerous and Torn) The other complaint is that the movie is shown in episode style and the episodes are short, like under 15 minutes each, and they have a long credit sequence.",4,Gifted X Men,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,766,"['are', 'casual', 'animated', 'fan', 'then', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'are', 'expecting', 'normal', 'animated', 'movie', 'again', 'not', 'are', 'looking', 'X', 'Men', 'movie', 'more', 'mature', 'subject', 'matter', 'wheelhouse', 'movie', 'done', 'motion', 'comic', 'basically', 'comic', 'panel', 'motion', 'consisting', 'lips', 'moving', 'dubbed', 'movie', 'body', 'parts', 'moving', 'NOT', 'full', 'animation', 'was', 'hesitant', 'first', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'story', 'forget', 'motion', 'fact', 'bought', 'next', '2', 'titles', 'Dangerous', 'Torn', 'other', 'complaint', 'movie', 'shown', 'episode', 'style', 'episodes', 'are', 'short', '15', 'minutes', 'have', 'long', 'credit', 'sequence']",Astonishing X-Men: Gifted

1355286,A2M0Y868LHDVR5,B003NHMYJ2,Dan Carver,"[1, 1]","In my mind there are a afew simple facts:X-MEN (and their comic franchises) Were one of Marvel's Greatest Collections of Stories, Characters, and Drawing.Bryan Singer RUINED The X-Men both in his involvement in the Films and the ComicsJoss Whedon knows how to put together a Good Story to Unfold over time and maintain suspence.I stopped Reading the X-Men comics about 10 years ago. I moved on to other focuses and grew up as I moved on to College Life. However, my interest was always there as I went to see all the movies, and was dissapointed each and every one of them. From time to time, I'd pick up one of the comics by a magazine stand and read it and see how Bryan Singer's abomination had worked it's way into the pages of the comic itself and I'd put it down.I ran across ""The Astonishing X-Men: Gifted"" on iTunes. I had seen something about a Motion Comic before, with Spiderwoman, but never watched it. What got me into trying this was the name: Joss Whedon. What I loved from him was his creation of the TV Series based on his movie ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" which despite superficial first looks, is quite an indepth show that dealt with things such as Self-Loathing, Drug Abuse, Coming to Terms with Self, the struggle between light and dark in ourselves.. a million things... all in a creative fashion. As an X-Men Fan.. I was very intregued by his Whedonized retelling of the Classic X-Men Storyline ""The Dark Phoenix Saga"" using Willow as his ""Phoenix."" The comparisons are undeniable and to learn that Joss has been an X-Men fan just confirm it (not to mention his brief allusion to Dark Phoenix in the series during this storyline). (If you're an X-Men fan, check out Season 6 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to see what I mean.. He really does Re-Tell the Phoenix Saga better than the X-Men Movies tried to).ANYWAY, Joss is what made me decide to try out this X-MEN Motion Comic.I was not suprised to learn that Jean Grey was dead, again, but a bit taken back that Scott had taken up with Emma Frost and I'm still unclear about where Xavier is, or why beast looks more... beastly than usual. The story telling, the humor, the build up and suspence are all Classic Joss Whedon with the X-Men flare and is great. He re-captures the comic style of each of these characters as I remember them and I quite enjoyed each episode, of which there are 6. I HOPE For More..My ONE Complaint... I'm tired of ""The Cure"" which we've been going on and on about since Cable was a baby.ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW: This Isn't A Cartoon, as you may be acustomed to. Essentially it is a group of Voice Actors reading the Comic to you ""In Character"" with Panels of the Original Print Comic Book, shown on the screen and manipulated to appear as tho they are talking, or moving.There is a PREVIEW Available on Amazon.com and i'm sure on iTunes so you can get a taste of what to expect before you buy.I consider this a must for any Prodigal X-Fan who wants to catch up and see where it's been going.",4,Great Story and Storytelling,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,2994,"['mind', 'are', 'afew', 'simple', 'facts', 'X-MEN', 'comic', 'franchises', 'Were', 'one', 'Marvel', 'Greatest', 'Collections', 'Stories', 'Characters', 'Drawing.Bryan', 'Singer', 'RUINED', 'X-Men', 'involvement', 'Films', 'ComicsJoss', 'Whedon', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'Good', 'Story', 'Unfold', 'time', 'maintain', 'suspence.I', 'stopped', 'Reading', 'X-Men', 'comics', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'moved', 'other', 'focuses', 'grew', 'up', 'moved', 'College', 'Life', 'However', 'interest', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'went', 'see', 'movies', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'one', 'time', 'time', ""'d"", 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'comics', 'magazine', 'stand', 'read', 'see', 'how', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'abomination', 'had', 'worked', 'way', 'pages', 'comic', ""'d"", 'put', 'down.I', 'ran', 'Astonishing', 'X-Men', 'Gifted', 'iTunes', 'had', 'seen', 'something', 'Motion', 'Comic', 'Spiderwoman', 'never', 'watched', 'What', 'got', 'trying', 'was', 'name', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'What', 'loved', 'was', 'creation', 'TV', 'Series', 'based', 'movie', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'superficial', 'first', 'looks', 'quite', 'indepth', 'show', 'things', 'such', 'Self-Loathing', 'Drug', 'Abuse', 'Coming', 'Terms', 'Self', 'struggle', 'light', 'dark', 'ourselves..', 'million', 'things', 'creative', 'fashion', 'X-Men', 'Fan..', 'was', 'very', 'intregued', 'Whedonized', 'retelling', 'Classic', 'X-Men', 'Storyline', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Saga', 'using', 'Willow', 'Phoenix', 'comparisons', 'are', 'undeniable', 'learn', 'Joss', 'been', 'X-Men', 'fan', 'just', 'confirm', 'not', 'mention', 'brief', 'allusion', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'series', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'X-Men', 'fan', 'check', 'Season', '6', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'see', 'what', 'mean..', 'really', 'Re-Tell', 'Phoenix', 'Saga', 'better', 'X-Men', 'Movies', 'tried', '.ANYWAY', 'Joss', 'what', 'made', 'decide', 'try', 'out', 'X-MEN', 'Motion', 'Comic.I', 'was', 'not', 'suprised', 'learn', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'was', 'dead', 'again', 'bit', 'taken', 'back', 'Scott', 'had', 'taken', 'up', 'Emma', 'Frost', ""'m"", 'still', 'unclear', 'where', 'Xavier', 'why', 'beast', 'more', 'beastly', 'usual', 'story', 'telling', 'humor', 'build', 'up', 'suspence', 'are', 'Classic', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'X-Men', 'flare', 'great', 'comic', 'style', 'characters', 'remember', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'are', '6', 'HOPE', 'More..My', 'ONE', 'Complaint', ""'m"", 'tired', 'Cure', ""'ve"", 'been', 'going', 'Cable', 'was', 'baby.ONE', 'THING', 'YOU', 'NEED', 'TO', 'KNOW', ""n't"", 'A', 'Cartoon', 'may', 'be', 'acustomed', 'Essentially', 'group', 'Voice', 'Actors', 'reading', 'Comic', 'Character', 'Panels', 'Original', 'Print', 'Comic', 'Book', 'shown', 'screen', 'manipulated', 'appear', 'tho', 'are', 'talking', 'PREVIEW', 'Available', 'Amazon.com', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'iTunes', 'can', 'get', 'taste', 'what', 'expect', 'buy.I', 'consider', 'must', 'Prodigal', 'X-Fan', 'who', 'catch', 'up', 'see', 'where', 'been', 'going']",Astonishing X-Men: Gifted

1355288,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003NHMYJ2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","First, the comic book gives you more, in case you haven't read it yet. But this motion comics adaptation ain't so shabby, either. Apologies to Grant Morrison and his quirk and others who did decent in their X-Men runs, but no one's done it better recently than Joss Whedon.  So if a comic book company were to launch a new platform to showcase its comics, mining Whedon's brilliance seems a straight-up no-brainer. Artist John Cassaday helped, too. Of course, DC was the actual pioneer in this field, having come out with its rough WATCHMEN motion comics some years ago.ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED is Whedon's first X-Men arc and, reading it, you knew right away that you're in for some spectacular times. Whedon pulls out all the usual tools from his utility belt: the wit, the humor, the emotional gut checks, the pop culture plunge, the plot swerve. He makes you love the characters, even characters you didn't give an ef about going in (I'm looking at you, Cyclops). And, after you grow to care about them, he kills them off. I'm not saying that that happens here. But Whedon is a notorious serial killer.Whedon gets a crack at writing Kitty Pryde, and if you don't fall in love with her, you are some sort of soulless. She returns to the X-Men proper here, and as a member of Xavier Institute's faculty, all grown up. In terms of character development, Kitty is the richest character. Love Kitty Pryde.The central conflicts in the story: An alien mercenary called Ord from the Breakworld - the wonderfully snide Emma Frost refers to him as the ""alien berk"" - is running amok, taking hostages, testing the X-Men for whatever reason. Meanwhile, with the ever present anti-mutant hysteria as a backdrop, a brilliant geneticist publicly announces a cure for the mutant gene. Two separate plot threads but, as it turns out, it's all one single thread. As a bonus, Nick Fury shows up and S.W.O.R.D. is introduced. And just to demonstrate that Whedon doesn't only kill people off, an X-Man returns from the dead.Don't get it twisted, what's featured here isn't full blown animation or a cartoon or what have you. Motion comics is a medium perched somewhere between the comic book and animation (text captions and word/thought balloons are excised in exchange for spoken dialogue). The movements aren't that fluid or continuous. Think of it as taking the original artwork from the comic book and tweaking it here and there just enough so that there are bits of movement. It's pretty minimal stuff, but in spite of the inherent stiffness and the limits to this new medium, the computer graphic artists do wonders. The neat thing to this concept is that there is absolute devotion to the source material, the comic book's original artwork is preserved, as well as the words. In ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED  the ""animators"" are all very keen to keep faith with John Cassaday. Thanks to them - and thanks to project overseer Neal Adams and Cassaday himself - this motion comics achieves a sort of dynamic flow. The voice actors - a bunch of unknowns - flesh out the characters and are pitch perfect for their roles. And we already know Joss Whedon's story itself has legs.I'm still not sold on this motion comics thing. If Marvel, and whichever other comic book company, were to stick with its best products, then motion comics might make a go of it as a valid medium. I'd love to see John Byrne's 1980s run on FANTASTIC FOUR to get this treatment or Miller & Mazzucchelli's BATMAN: YEAR ONE. I like what I saw in GIFTED because Cassaday's art is stunning stuff, never mind that this new technology is still tottering on baby legs. Neal Adams has stated that he someday wants this medium to get a movie theater release, but that is some serious reaching at this early stage. Let's wait and see.ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED collects all six episodes, each running at around 12 to 14 minutes. The DVD's bonus material: Joe Quesada and Neal Adams talk about the genesis and development of Marvel's first motion comic book, with Quesada also going into the process of acquiring Joss Whedon as X-Men's then newest writer (00:17:10 minutes long); the pretty cool ""Rise Up"" music video; the ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED trailer; a chronological history of the X-Men, narrated in text, except that if your television screen is small, then you may not be able to read the print; ""Behind the Scenes with Marvel Knights Animation"" delves even more technically into the motion comics process (00:05:12 minutes); an Artist's Gallery featuring John Cassaday's incredible stuff; ""Marvel Super Heroes: What The--?!"" presents Marvel characters auditioning for roles in ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED: Episode #1 (""There's No Business Like Snow Business""), Episode #2 (""Red Carpet M.O.D.O.K.""), and Episode #11 (""Deadpool FYC""); and trailers for other Marvel motion comics (SPIDER-WOMAN: AGENT OF S.W.O.R.D., the shaky looking BLACK PANTHER, and IRON MAN: EXTREMIS).",4,"""So, what?

There are very few creative forces in the pantheon of Fanboy/girl obsession that have more slavish devotees than Joss Whedon. The reason for this is simple: Just about every project he touches turns to gold. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DOLLHOUSE, and the SERENITY feature film... he is a geek god. And then he came into the world of Comics. He started out with the futuristic Vampire Slayer series FRAY, and then he was given the opportunity to helm the flagship X-Men title for the new millenium: ASTONISHING X-MEN. The series comes directly after the fallout of the Grant Morrison run, which saw Jean Grey die (again), Scott Summers fall in love with Emma Frost, a Magneto-wannabe destroy a lot of Manhattan and all of the X-Men's uniforms turn into black and yellow leather.Joss Whedon and PLANETARY's illustrious illustrator John Cassaday joined up to bring a less bizarre but more intense run than Morrison ever could have done.I'm not really going to get into the plot because you can find that all on the TPB review pages. What I'm going into here is the Motion Comic. It does a great job at retelling and somewhat animating the ""Gifted"" arc. The voice talent is all no-name, but they all fit their respected characters perfectly.

1355296,AHF97M45JFCB,B003NHMYJ2,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","It was only a matter of time before I&#8217;d succumb to the charms of the motion comic genre and now that I&#8217;ve finally purchased and watched a few, I can firmly attest to the fact that Astonishing X-Men Gifted is a success on all fronts.To begin, do try to ignore all of the negative reviews that bash products like this one and the many other motion comics on the market (easily identifiable in Marvel&#8217;s thanks to the &#8220;Marvel Knights&#8221; branding right on the package) for poor or choppy animation. This is a motion comic after all, not an animated series.  That&#8217;s like faulting a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese for not being spaghetti.Anyway, if the idea of a motion comic means nothing to you, think the actual pages of the graphic novel on which the story is based scanned into a computer one panel at a time and Photoshop used to move limbs, turn heads, make mouth flaps match spoken dialog etc.  Never does this claim to be nor replace traditional animation practices.Instead (as the commentary on this particular DVD eloquently confesses), this is an entirely new entertainment medium altogether.  One that bridges the gap between the static panels of a comic and the acting/ motion of a film or cartoon.  As such, the experience of viewing is pretty unique and quite enjoyable.  Truly it captures the tone, look and feel of the comic like no other medium I&#8217;m aware of but does so with just enough energy to keep it very separate from say, reading a comic book on the Marvel app.I personally found myself noticing its uniqueness for the first few segments of the first episode (there are 6 contained on this disc in total/ based on issues # 1-6) but by the end, had forgotten entirely that this was in fact a motion comic and not simply a TV series.  Perhaps some of this can be attributed to Joss Whedon&#8217;s engaging story-line, which, in the event that you haven&#8217;t read the graphic novels on which these Marvel Knights&#8217; Astonishing X-Men motion comics are based, is quite impressive.Without giving up too many spoilers, the plot introduces a &#34;mutant cure&#34; designed by Benetech scientist Dr. Kavita Rao, who was secretly sponsored by the gladiator alien Ord. The prospect of &#34;real&#34; humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation and all the while the lines drawn between society and mutant-kind are becoming venerable walls.In short, now only is the plot intriguing and rich but the dialog is spot-on as well, with witty quips and awesome character exchanges aplenty.  Pacing is entirely too quick though for my taste as the 6 roughly 10-minute episodes are over just as the action is heating up.Which brings me to my only complaint, to get the story in its motion comic entirety, one must purchase separate DVDs for Volume 2 (Dangerous), Volume 3 (Torn) and Volume 4 (Unstoppable).  At around $10 a pop, you&#8217;re looking at close to $50 to enjoy the tale in its entirety.  Worse still is that Marvel Knights isn&#8217;t stopping with just Joss Whedon&#8217;s take on the X franchise either as already Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk, Wolverine Vs. Sabretooth, Wolverine Origin, and Weapon X Tomorrow Dies Today have already been released.  Building up a Marvel Knights motion comic collection can add up really quickly and it&#8217;s addicting enough to warrant doing so.  It would really be nice if Shout! Factory, at the very least, would have bundled up all of the Joss Whedon arc of the franchise into a single DVD box-set rather than forcing buyers to pick up 4 separate releases to get the full story.  Note that since the time of this review&#8217;s writing, that have done exactly this for the Blu-ray edition of the material calling it Marvel Knights: Astonishing X-Men BluRay Box.That single complaint aside, it&#8217;s very easy to recommend picking up Astonishing X-Men Gifted to dedicated comic fans and neophytes alike.  Truly the experience is entirely unique even from those as seemingly similar as the various animated incarnations of the franchise throughout the years (and certainly much more loyal to the source material than all of the live action films combined).Gifted represents my first foray into the motion comic genre and will certainly not be my last.  I&#8217;m already quite interested in picking up InHumans and Black Panther in my next binge.

When I saw Amazon had the motion comic on DVD I had to purchase it.What is a motion comic?  Its a bit of a hybrid genre-- the video looks like someone was able to animate the spaces between the panels in a comic book.  The conversation bubbles are replaced by voice actors.  The voice acting is spot on.  Emma Frost drips with her elite mannerism.  Wolverine is gruff and quick-witted.  The voice actors do a great job of dramatically portraying the x-men without going over the top into the field of campy or too corny: It is not a Saturday morning cartoon-- in some ways it much better.I loved the 1990's x-men cartoon, but as I grew up so did the X-men.  Astonishing X-men are still dealing with some of the issues of discrimination and intolerance that have been a hallmark of x-men series since the comic debuted in the 1960s but in a much more sophisticated manner.  In these episodes a cure for mutants is discovered, and the x-men are torn between inner conflicts as well as inter-stellar conflicts.I wont give anything away, but the acting and animation is paced so that the suspense never slackens.  The only thing I don't like about this is that there are ONLY six episodes.  I would gladly buy ever x-men issue as motion comic as well as a paper issue if they were as well made as these episodes.If you grew up with the x-men, you'll appreciate Gifted for its many allusions to their 40 year comic history.

There is a lot done with mouths and subtle facial expressions; lots of close-ups and reveals that make this not splashy but perhaps more effective for the young motion comic phenomenon and interested persons would do well to start here.Joss Whedon, who does a great job with team dynamics, seems perfectly fitted for this caper as he opens up a new X-Men storyline that includes Emma Frost as an important chemical piece in the mix.  She will long be the Elvira of the X-Men set I suppose.  The heart of this story, which you've seen many a time as long as you're not new to comics, is the promise or potential to nix the effects of the mutant genome.

Also, Kitty is surprised by whom she finds in the dungeons of an alien vessel.  But backing up the team dynamics and verbal repartee, while not of the highest degree, is still where this story catches and holds you.  3.75 stars.",4,We gotta wear costumes?

Hells yeah!That's where the good ended... it's not a movie at all it's a motion comic. Basically they scanned the comic panels into a computer & used photoshop to turn, angle & warp the image to give it the appearance of really crappy animation.Then they remove the word bubbles and hire voice actors. The voice acting was not half bad but nobody in their right mind would pay $15 for a movie that is just comic panels flashed on the screen while people read the text. At least when they did it for the Watchman graphic novel it was during the watchmen hype when the movie was out AND they said straight on the package it was a motion comic.... this is just shameless money grubbing and nowhere on the packaging does this say anything about being a motion comic.I made it through the first episode but they couldn't even make the credits smooth... this is going back tomorrow morning.",2,"good story but ""not a movie""",1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,983,"['bought', 'wal-mart', 'yesterday', 'animated', 'X-Men', 'movie', '15', 'story', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Hells', 'yeah', 'where', 'good', 'ended', 'not', 'movie', 'motion', 'comic', 'Basically', 'scanned', 'comic', 'panels', 'computer', 'used', 'photoshop', 'turn', 'angle', 'warp', 'image', 'give', 'appearance', 'really', 'crappy', 'animation.Then', 'remove', 'word', 'bubbles', 'hire', 'voice', 'actors', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'nobody', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'pay', '15', 'movie', 'just', 'comic', 'panels', 'flashed', 'screen', 'people', 'read', 'text', 'least', 'when', 'did', 'Watchman', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'watchmen', 'hype', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'out', 'AND', 'said', 'straight', 'package', 'was', 'motion', 'comic', 'just', 'shameless', 'money', 'grubbing', 'nowhere', 'packaging', 'say', 'anything', 'being', 'motion', 'comic.I', 'made', 'first', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'credits', 'smooth', 'going', 'back', 'tomorrow', 'morning']",Astonishing X-Men: Gifted
