I watch a lot of foreign films so I'm used to the slower pace that some movies may have.  However, this one, for me, was excruciatingly slow.  I understand the sentiment the director was trying to convey.  However, it did seem to drag, especially near the end.  The plot is an interesting one.  Two strangers meet when notified that their spouses had been seriously injured (comatised) as the result of a car accident.  They come to realize that the spouses had been having an affair.  The way the two connect is really natural with lots of silence.

996675,A1DI3PU62K8KZ0,B000FVEAN2,Duchess Darcy,"[14, 14]","*******(Contains spoilers)*******Borrowing a theme similar to Harrison Ford's ""Random Hearts"", we have Bae Yong-jun (In-su) and Son Ye-jin (Seo-yung) as two married individuals whose spouses have been involved in a tragic car accident. The driver of the other car is killed, while their spouses suffered grave injuries. One remains in a coma after surgery. At the hospital it doesn't take long for In-su and Seo-yung to discover that his wife and her husband were having an affair. What follows is the realization that their assumed happy marriages weren't as perfect as they thought it was. The deliberately slow progression of the story mirrors a more true to life passage of time. We see the daily visits of In-su and Seo-yung as they try to care for their injured loved ones and at the same time try to understand why their spouses did, what they did. In turn they question their own worth but find few answers to satisfy their confusion.Whether their marriages will survive is not just related to how quickly or if their spouses will heal, but also to why they strayed in the first place. The hurt of the betrayal follows In-su and Seo-yung in their daily activities. As the wronged wife, Seo-yung remarks, at least when her husband wakes up, she'll get an explanation. She hopes she does. Thrown together with In-su in their mutual suffering, they come to care for each other, lean on each other for support. When Seo-yung jokingly says they should have an affair of their own as revenge, it doesn't seem to far fetched an idea. Through the extradinary of circumstance of their spouses accident, they came together. But it is because of their pain, their confusion, their need to feel wanted, that they choose to be close.I read somewhere they have re-released this film in Japan with an additional twenty or thirty minutes. When will that extended version be available here?The soundtrack is haunting in it's melodies. The classical style compositions very much enriches the storyline. The only reason I gave this film four stars instead of five is because it was short, clocking in at 1 hour, 43 min. I wanted more.",4,Winter. Spring.

996677,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000FVEAN2,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","Bae Yong-joon as In-soo and Son Ye-jin as Seo-young are the romantic leads in a tragic themed romantic drama of two spouses of two others who are absolutely unaware their their counterparts have been having a passionate affair. Tragedy occurs when the cheating pair have a horrific auto accident that lands them in the ICU of a hospital. It does not take long for In-soo and Seo-young to figure out what had been going on. The moral center of the film is what each unwitting spouse does and thinks. The film's director uses a continuous series of cut away shots delinking scene from scene to suggest a general sense of confusion between In-soo and Seo-young. Neither has a road map of internal morality to guide them. Though the director does not state explicitly the nature of the marriages prior to the accident, he implies that the non-cheating spouses were blissfully unaware of any pre-existing stresses. In one subtly nuanced scene of a growing realization of the cheaters' infidelity, In-soo and Seo-young view a recorded session on a mini-cam of the lovemaking of the soon to be doomed pair. There is surprisingly little conversation; most of the dramatic impetus is a combination of facial close-ups and slight conversation. Despite the tragedy, In-soo and Seo-young try to cope and in this case the coping centers on their own realization that their respective marriages were empty shams. They grow closer until Seo-young suggests possibly jokingly possibly not that they have an affair. They do have one, an act which further muddies an already muddy scene. What should each do with their erring spouses? It would seem heartless to suggest divorce while the cheating spouses are at death's door. What they do is to follow their hearts and in a closing scene (which I shall not here reveal), the falling of April snow which has been omnipresent throughout suggests that behind a typical occurrence like snow or marriage, there are often wildly opposing undercurrents. APRIL SNOW is a deliberately slow-paced film that chooses to reveal the motivation of the cheaters and the reactions of their respective spouses in the manner of the peeling of an onion. Each new layer simply points to another. Highly recommended.",4,Motivation is Often Like the Peeling of an Onion: Slow but Sure,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,2225,"['Bae', 'Yong-joon', 'In-soo', 'Son', 'Ye-jin', 'Seo-young', 'are', 'romantic', 'leads', 'tragic', 'themed', 'romantic', 'drama', 'two', 'spouses', 'two', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'absolutely', 'unaware', 'counterparts', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Tragedy', 'when', 'cheating', 'pair', 'have', 'horrific', 'auto', 'accident', 'ICU', 'hospital', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'In-soo', 'Seo-young', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'moral', 'center', 'film', 'what', 'unwitting', 'spouse', 'thinks', 'film', 'director', 'continuous', 'series', 'cut', 'away', 'shots', 'delinking', 'scene', 'scene', 'suggest', 'general', 'sense', 'confusion', 'In-soo', 'Seo-young', 'Neither', 'road', 'map', 'internal', 'morality', 'guide', 'director', 'not', 'state', 'explicitly', 'nature', 'marriages', 'prior', 'accident', 'non-cheating', 'spouses', 'were', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'pre-existing', 'stresses', 'one', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'scene', 'growing', 'realization', 'cheaters', 'infidelity', 'In-soo', 'Seo-young', 'view', 'recorded', 'session', 'mini-cam', 'lovemaking', 'soon', 'be', 'doomed', 'pair', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'conversation', 'most', 'dramatic', 'impetus', 'combination', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'slight', 'conversation', 'tragedy', 'In-soo', 'Seo-young', 'try', 'cope', 'case', 'coping', 'centers', 'own', 'realization', 'respective', 'marriages', 'were', 'empty', 'shams', 'grow', 'closer', 'Seo-young', 'possibly', 'jokingly', 'possibly', 'not', 'have', 'affair', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'act', 'further', 'muddies', 'already', 'muddy', 'scene', 'What', 'should', 'do', 'erring', 'spouses', 'would', 'seem', 'heartless', 'suggest', 'divorce', 'cheating', 'spouses', 'are', 'death', 'door', 'What', 'do', 'follow', 'hearts', 'closing', 'scene', 'shall', 'not', 'here', 'reveal', 'falling', 'April', 'snow', 'been', 'omnipresent', 'typical', 'occurrence', 'snow', 'marriage', 'are', 'often', 'wildly', 'opposing', 'undercurrents', 'APRIL', 'SNOW', 'deliberately', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'reveal', 'motivation', 'cheaters', 'reactions', 'respective', 'spouses', 'manner', 'peeling', 'onion', 'new', 'layer', 'simply', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

996681,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000FVEAN2,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[5, 5]","I'm not an idiot, I know there are a number of romantic dramas that aren't full of clich&eacute; and stereotypical characters. The problem is finding the right one to review. (This is only my second review for a PURE romantic theme flick so don't heckle me; I avoided a romantic comedy) I chose ""April Snow"" because it is one I did like and even with its similarities to ""Random Hearts"" (with Harrison Ford); I found it to be a very good film directed by Jin Ho-hur. I've reviewed a subversive love story before; ""Green Chair"", a surreal love story ""Oasis"" and the teen romance ""My Sassy Girl"", time to tackle the infidelity theme. I rarely review a pure love story so I will avoid the stereotypical Korean love stories with an ailing woman such as ""A Moment to Remember"". (Yea, I went there!)April Snow is a story of a man and a woman who faces their spouses' accident and infidelity together and loses the balance on their lives. The two meet in the hallway in front of an operating room. As the two rush in upon hearing of the spouses' accident, they realize that the man's wife and the woman's husband had an affair together. They also realize that they share the same sadness. The two get lost in despair and confusion and anger but they unexpectedly start to fall in love and jump to the same affair as their spouses' did. They hesitate at this new emotion that may cause further heartache and pain.April Snow is a film with a purpose. Instead of going through the usual road with cheating spouses and angry spouses; it goes to another direction. It successfully promotes going forward in spite of emotional pain and shows a unique ability to engage its audience with its simplicity. Why do I like ""April Snow""? The film does have a few surprises and the way it is shot is quite beautiful. It offers a LOT of subtle details even for the most experienced movie watcher. Viewers may miss the moment the first time Insu and Seo-young hold hands and the very warm chemistry when they shared a cup of noodles unless they are very attentive. The film offers a sense of irony that the two main characters are caught in the same lie and deceit their respective spouses have engaged in before.The film is also emotionally driven. At first, Insu and Seo-Young are shown in denial and then they try to accept the fact of their spouses' betrayal. Seo-Young was decisive in playing the dutiful wife in taking care of her bed-ridden husband. As with Insu, he was very caring to his wife in the hospital. It is ONLY after Insu sat beside Seo-Young did things start to change, they found comfort from each other that will ultimately blossom into something else. It was to the director's credit that he managed to convey the needed emotions from the two leads. Guilt was especially expressed during their first getaway and the time Insu's father-in-law came by for a visit. What I found more interesting is that the guilt being expressed didn't feel like it was because of their own unfaithfulness but guilt that they didn't want to take advantage of the other's vulnerability. The subtle details are there, the simplicity in its execution is what made ""April Snow"" a very good film.Refreshingly beautiful Son Ye-jin carries most of the film's weight with her excellent acting and her charisma (She also saved ""Moment to Remember""). She plays her character with such incomparable depth and expresses raw emotion even when she isn't saying anything. Bae Yung-jun's acting may seem a bit stiff and wooden at times but women are sure to be swooned by his charisma.Most of the film's strengths may come from its simplicity but its simplicity is also its main weakness. People who aren't paying attention may find that the premise should go further than the ""hurt"" feelings and the proceedings have a bit of a ""sleepy"" feel. Also, the spouses of Insu and Seo-young don't seem to be viable characters (They were in love, it just turned out that they were married) but only plot devices. I DON'T agree with cheating on your spouse for any reason, but I do agree in moving forward and moving on from the pain. The way to approach this film is to see the subtlety in its beauty.Despite its faults, ""April Snow"" is a very good film that is worth watching. I liked the final act in the film, which asked a subtle question: Where do we go from here?HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
