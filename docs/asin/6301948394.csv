274004,A2IK9YLARCZ9YG,6301948394,Bud Sturguess,"[1, 2]","The producers of this film took an already tasteless and exploitative book (Bob Woodward's ""biography"" of John Belushi) and turned it into a bloated, senseless, still tasteless and exploitative movie. Notorious for both its controversial depiction of Belushi and disastrous reception upon release, ""Wired"" follows the too-soon-gone comic/actor (played by Michael Chiklis) in a Charles Dickens-like journey through his life (that is, if Charles Dickens had been a vulture), guided by his guardian angel...named Angel (Ray Sharkey).The ill-advised scene attempting to comically depict Belushi's autopsy should be enough to keep anyone away, but add a stale script and you've got one bad movie. Although, despite its reckless abandon of taste, ""Wired"" does feature a burgeoning Chiklis trying his best, though weighed down by poor writing. The character he plays is certainly effective, even if it's not quite John Belushi he's portraying. Ray Sharkey is also somehow entertaining in his role as the angel of death, finding the often-underrated late actor managing to pull off a watchable performance of a bad character.There was certainly a movie that could have been made about the life of one of America's most popular comic actors, but ""Wired"" blew it.",2,Unavailable on DVD for Obvious Reasons,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1253,"['producers', 'film', 'took', 'already', 'tasteless', 'exploitative', 'book', 'Bob', 'Woodward', 'biography', 'John', 'Belushi', 'turned', 'bloated', 'senseless', 'still', 'tasteless', 'exploitative', 'movie', 'Notorious', 'controversial', 'depiction', 'Belushi', 'disastrous', 'reception', 'release', 'Wired', 'too-soon-gone', 'comic/actor', 'played', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Charles', 'Dickens-like', 'journey', 'life', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'had', 'been', 'vulture', 'guided', 'guardian', 'angel', 'named', 'Angel', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', '.The', 'ill-advised', 'scene', 'attempting', 'comically', 'depict', 'Belushi', 'autopsy', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'anyone', 'away', 'add', 'stale', 'script', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'bad', 'movie', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'taste', 'Wired', 'feature', 'burgeoning', 'Chiklis', 'trying', 'best', 'weighed', 'down', 'poor', 'writing', 'character', 'certainly', 'effective', 'even', 'not', 'quite', 'John', 'Belushi', 'portraying', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'also', 'somehow', 'entertaining', 'role', 'angel', 'death', 'finding', 'often-underrated', 'late', 'actor', 'managing', 'pull', 'off', 'watchable', 'performance', 'bad', 'character.There', 'was', 'certainly', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'life', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'popular', 'comic', 'actors', 'Wired', 'blew']",Wired VHS
274005,A1YUDUB20HKEDS,6301948394,"Jesse Nelson ""scazzy""","[1, 4]","I think it sort of mimics the crazy roller coaster life that Belushi led. The scene with Woodward confronting his subject at the end, particularly from a writer's perspective, was very interesting. And there's some pretty dark humor... Belushi's ghost aware during the autopsy, or being put on the plane in his body bag instead of coffin because the coffin won't fit. Some complained about the Hell insinuation at the end. But think about it... his whole situation became an uncontrollable hell. That's partially shown in the nightclub scene, as he tries to escape the drugs, but can't.If you like the surreal, I'd recommend checking this out. At the very least, it doesn't deserve the bad reputation it has. Back when it came out, part of the reason it got so trashed was because of how it hopped around time wise. That became a much more accepted film staple throughout the 90's. I always thought this might become a cult film. Look for it on YouTube to give it a fair shake.",5,Very Surreal,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,977,"['think', 'sort', 'mimics', 'crazy', 'roller', 'coaster', 'life', 'Belushi', 'led', 'scene', 'Woodward', 'confronting', 'subject', 'end', 'particularly', 'writer', 'perspective', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'dark', 'humor', 'Belushi', 'ghost', 'aware', 'autopsy', 'being', 'put', 'plane', 'body', 'bag', 'instead', 'coffin', 'coffin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'complained', 'Hell', 'insinuation', 'end', 'think', 'whole', 'situation', 'became', 'uncontrollable', 'hell', 'partially', 'shown', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'escape', 'drugs', ""can't.If"", 'surreal', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'very', 'least', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'bad', 'reputation', 'Back', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'part', 'reason', 'got', 'so', 'trashed', 'was', 'how', 'hopped', 'time', 'wise', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'accepted', 'film', 'staple', '90', 'always', 'thought', 'might', 'become', 'cult', 'film', 'Look', 'YouTube', 'give', 'fair', 'shake']",Wired VHS
274006,AM5WLF25DW3XU,6301948394,Joe Comer,"[1, 6]","The only thing that really hurts this film were the attempts by Dan Aykroyd and others to keep it and the book it was based from seeing the light of day.  The spineless journalists of television and the newspapers  who were obviously influenced by those attempts wrote less about the film  and more from a paranoia and a jump-on-the-bandwagon mentality that was  grossly unjust.  This is especailly unfair in a business like film that has  had a reputation for being creatively liberal.  John Belushi lived a very  dangerous life.  He constantly walked on the edge.  His death offered  little surprise for the people who knew him and loved him.  So why not  write a book about the behind-the-scenes life of this immensly talented  human being!  Consequently, why not make a faithful and accurate motion  picture from that book!But the film doesn't stop there.  In adding the  aspect of the guardian angel (Ray Sharkey), a character not in the book, it  explores new territory not touched upon in other biographies.  What if  Belushi did have the chance to see how he messed up?  What would he do?  Of  course, this addition was used as an argument by the movie's detractors.  They used it to condemn the whole film.  Not a valid argument.  Just  because it had never been attempted before was no reason not to try it this  time.  The film's enemies were, in truth, trying to come up with something  that they thought people would reason was not a good idea, then use that to  camouflage the real reason they didn't like it.In the days of Louis B.  Mayer, Harry Cohn, Darryl Zanuck, Jack Warner and the other movie moguls,  the truth had a way of disappearing.  With the 50's and the beginning of  the demise of the studio system the film industry started becoming a great  deal more honest with itself.  Unfortunately, not every movie became  protected by this gradual change.  WIRED is such a movie.  But it's not  just the truth about Belushi that made certain executives and other bigwigs  cringe.  It is mainly the film's views about the industry and how it is  represented here and in the book that made them paranoid.Nevertheless,  except for a couple of flaws-lack of chronology of events and the  intersplicing of scenes with Bob Woodward, the author of the book, which  makes things confusing and the lack of substance in some of the  characters-this film deserves to be watched.  Although the episodic nature  of this work makes things a little jumpy, it also manages to move it along  at a good pace.  Michael Chiklis as Belushi, Patti D'Arbanville as Cathy  Smith, his killer, Lucinda Jenney as his wife and Alex Rocco as his manager  all give memorable performances.  The script, as mentioned before, is  faithful to the book (although not chronologically) and the imagination  shown is something that Belushi himself would have been proud of.Skip  the other things said and written about this movie and see it.  Whether a  Belushi fan or not, it might be the perfect exercise in open-mindedness!",4,Imaginative and thought-provoking!,956534400,"04 24, 2000",2000,3009,"['only', 'thing', 'really', 'film', 'were', 'attempts', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'others', 'keep', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'seeing', 'light', 'day', 'spineless', 'journalists', 'television', 'newspapers', 'who', 'were', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'attempts', 'wrote', 'less', 'film', 'more', 'paranoia', 'jump-on-the-bandwagon', 'mentality', 'was', 'grossly', 'unjust', 'especailly', 'unfair', 'business', 'film', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'creatively', 'liberal', 'John', 'Belushi', 'lived', 'very', 'dangerous', 'life', 'constantly', 'walked', 'edge', 'death', 'offered', 'little', 'surprise', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'loved', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'write', 'book', 'behind-the-scenes', 'life', 'immensly', 'talented', 'human', 'being', 'Consequently', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'faithful', 'accurate', 'motion', 'picture', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'adding', 'aspect', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'character', 'not', 'book', 'new', 'territory', 'not', 'touched', 'other', 'biographies', 'What', 'Belushi', 'did', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'course', 'addition', 'was', 'used', 'argument', 'movie', 'detractors', 'used', 'condemn', 'whole', 'film', 'Not', 'valid', 'argument', 'Just', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'attempted', 'was', 'reason', 'not', 'try', 'time', 'film', 'enemies', 'were', 'truth', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'thought', 'people', 'would', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'then', 'use', 'camouflage', 'real', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.In', 'days', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'Harry', 'Cohn', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'other', 'movie', 'moguls', 'truth', 'had', 'way', 'disappearing', '50', 'beginning', 'demise', 'studio', 'system', 'film', 'industry', 'started', 'becoming', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'honest', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'movie', 'became', 'protected', 'gradual', 'change', 'WIRED', 'such', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'truth', 'Belushi', 'made', 'certain', 'executives', 'other', 'bigwigs', 'cringe', 'mainly', 'film', 'views', 'industry', 'how', 'represented', 'here', 'book', 'made', 'paranoid.Nevertheless', 'couple', 'flaws-lack', 'chronology', 'events', 'intersplicing', 'scenes', 'Bob', 'Woodward', 'author', 'book', 'things', 'confusing', 'lack', 'substance', 'characters-this', 'film', 'deserves', 'be', 'watched', 'episodic', 'nature', 'work', 'things', 'little', 'jumpy', 'also', 'move', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Belushi', 'Patti', ""D'Arbanville"", 'Cathy', 'Smith', 'killer', 'Lucinda', 'Jenney', 'wife', 'Alex', 'Rocco', 'manager', 'give', 'memorable', 'performances', 'script', 'mentioned', 'faithful', 'book', 'not', 'chronologically', 'imagination', 'shown', 'something', 'Belushi', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'other', 'things', 'said', 'written', 'movie', 'see', 'Belushi', 'fan', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'perfect', 'exercise', 'open-mindedness']",Wired VHS
274007,A6MBZMLJL6WYB,6301948394,"""tluk""","[3, 5]","John Belushi was a great comedian.&quot;Wired&quot; is not a great movie. True, the material follows that which is transcribed in Bob Woodward's biography of Belushi. However, unlike the serious normality of  the book, &quot;Wired&quot; is doomed from the start - I am spoiling  nothing to say that the beginning of the movie has the ghost of Belushi  trying to escape the autopsy room in just a hospital sheet for  clothing.I find that to be a rather grim idea and way to present this  movie. Whilst Michael Chiklis does a passable impersonation of John  Belushi, the supporting cast seem to be sleepwalking their way through this  film.Unlike the book that &quot;Wired&quot; comes after, the movie is  erraticly paced - slow and plodding most of the time, interspersed with  scenes of high energy that have little effect.I don't mean to sound  deliberately harsh about &quot;Wired&quot;. It's just best to steer clear  if you're a fan of Belushi - I know that I am and watching this movie, I  learnt nothing I didn't already know.

274008,A17Z53UM2E111A,6301948394,T. P. Watt,"[2, 2]","The lopsided nature of the book Wired is amplified in the movie version. While the book focused very heavily on Belushi's drug addictions, there were references to his work and other facets of his personality outside of the cocaine-addled, binging monster; there was at least an attempt to provide a rounded portrait of Belushi as a human being (admittedly a weak attempt, but one nonetheless). With Wired the movie, one gets little sense of Belushi as being anything other than an obnoxious celebrity who took drugs. In addition, the movie has Belushi acting in SNL skits that never existed, singing Blues Brothers songs that the band never sung, and many of the persons in Belushi's real life have different names in the film (as the production was threatened with many lawsuits even before filming began). The filmic convention of having the recently deceased Belushi's ghost viewing various drug binges he undertook while alive is poorly executed, and the final scenes of Belushi's ghost playing a pinball game with his guardian angel in exchange for his life back if he wins are in the poorest taste (as is the vivid implication that Belushi went to hell because of the way he died). The narrative is all over the place in terms of chronology, with too many fast-forwards and flashbacks - unless one has read the book very carefully, one would be excused for being confused many times during the film as to when what is happening onscreen was supposed to have taken place. About the only parts of the film that work well and ring slightly true are the scenes lifted verbatim from Woodward's book, along with an energetic performance by Michael Chiklis as Belushi. Those two elements, along with a strong (if misguided) sense of courage on the part of the producers for making the film at all (considering the pressure they were under not to) give this a two-star rating.",2,"Disjointed, inaccurate and unsatisfying",1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,1875,"['lopsided', 'nature', 'book', 'Wired', 'amplified', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'focused', 'very', 'heavily', 'Belushi', 'drug', 'addictions', 'were', 'references', 'work', 'other', 'facets', 'personality', 'cocaine-addled', 'binging', 'monster', 'was', 'least', 'attempt', 'provide', 'rounded', 'portrait', 'Belushi', 'human', 'being', 'admittedly', 'weak', 'attempt', 'one', 'nonetheless', 'Wired', 'movie', 'one', 'little', 'sense', 'Belushi', 'being', 'anything', 'other', 'obnoxious', 'celebrity', 'who', 'took', 'drugs', 'addition', 'movie', 'Belushi', 'acting', 'SNL', 'skits', 'never', 'existed', 'singing', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'songs', 'band', 'never', 'sung', 'many', 'persons', 'Belushi', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'different', 'names', 'film', 'production', 'was', 'threatened', 'many', 'lawsuits', 'even', 'filming', 'began', 'filmic', 'convention', 'having', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Belushi', 'ghost', 'viewing', 'various', 'drug', 'binges', 'undertook', 'alive', 'poorly', 'executed', 'final', 'scenes', 'Belushi', 'ghost', 'playing', 'pinball', 'game', 'guardian', 'angel', 'exchange', 'life', 'back', 'are', 'poorest', 'taste', 'vivid', 'implication', 'Belushi', 'went', 'hell', 'way', 'died', 'narrative', 'place', 'terms', 'chronology', 'too', 'many', 'fast-forwards', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'read', 'book', 'very', 'carefully', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'excused', 'being', 'confused', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'when', 'what', 'happening', 'onscreen', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'only', 'parts', 'film', 'work', 'well', 'ring', 'slightly', 'true', 'are', 'scenes', 'lifted', 'verbatim', 'Woodward', 'book', 'energetic', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Belushi', 'two', 'elements', 'strong', 'misguided', 'sense', 'courage', 'part', 'producers', 'making', 'film', 'considering', 'pressure', 'were', 'not', 'give', 'two-star', 'rating']",Wired VHS
