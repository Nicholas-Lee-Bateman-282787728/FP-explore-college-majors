It's a pity its considered ""little""; maybe in futre decades, it will become ""big.""I've read the novel that this is based on, and I actually like the film bette!! Not that the novel isn't good. The movie, hoever, manages not only to cover the same ground more efficiently, but it packs in some extra nuances. And the way Joan Plowright and Jean Moreau both manage to play decades off their real ages is extremely impressive.  And Julie Walters pulls off being impressively stupid.One caveat: Jeanne Moreau's character is supposed to be English, and she clearly isn't.  This means that once in a while it's hard to tell what she's supposed to be saying. . .",5,Quirky masterpiece!,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,738,"['movie', 'so', 'priceless', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'crime', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'pity', 'considered', 'little', 'maybe', 'futre', 'decades', 'will', 'become', 'big', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', 'based', 'actually', 'film', 'bette', 'Not', 'novel', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'hoever', 'not', 'only', 'cover', 'same', 'ground', 'more', 'efficiently', 'extra', 'nuances', 'way', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Jean', 'Moreau', 'manage', 'play', 'decades', 'real', 'ages', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'being', 'impressively', 'stupid.One', 'caveat', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'English', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'once', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'saying']",N/A

Jeanne Moreau's lines and necklaces make you want to rush right out and become old and outrageous, and the great scenes are between Moreau and Plowright.  When those two get drunk together, it's such a hoot and the ending is so over the top you can't believe it's an English film.  The rich atmosphere created by veteran character actors, scenery and writing never fails to restore me.  BUT, what the heck is the French-lesson-lover saying to the flegmatic engenue when she sees him with the dead body of the gypsy?  I've looked at several versions with the volume up to max' and I can't catch it.  Anybody know?
