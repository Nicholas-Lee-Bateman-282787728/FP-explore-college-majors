Tom Ryan informs the couple that they have 24 hours to do as he says, or he will kill the Randall's daughter. It is here that this thriller gets moving.Overall, Shattered isn't a bad thriller. The story is a good one, and the acting is very good. But what ultimately shatters Shattered is the poor script. The dialog between characters is poorly crafter, leaving this strong pool of actors with very little to work with other than cliches.Also, you find yourself saying (over and over again): ""she should have..."", ""why didn't he..."", and ""I can't believe they didn't do so and so, I would have..."".

1111116,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000WP07F6,Dave. K,"[8, 9]","Going into Shattered I wasn't sure what to expect since the movie went direct to video. Just because a movie is DTV doesn't mean its bad there are many reasons for that; It could be the studio doesn't have the money to give a theatrical run or it could also be a movie that is tough to market it could be a great movie, but doesn't have mass appeal and than there is because the movie just isn't very good.Seeing the cast list I should have known better; Maria Bello is an actress I quite like, while she may not be a household name she is well known enough not to go DTV and with Gerard Butler quite popular right now and of course Pierce Brosnan I should have known there was a reason this went DTV in the States when it has 3 known actors. But I still gave the movie a chance.As a whole Shattered is by no means a bad movie. It's well acted and mostly well made, but what does this movie in is the clich&eacute;s. That is the biggest problem here. Writer William Morrissey writes the standard suspense/thriller. A man takes a couple hostage and if they don't do what he says their daughter dies. That is one of the most over-used plots in not just film, but TV as well. How many times have we seen that concept done with a family member in danger? Of course there comes a point when one of the characters goes against the villain and he gives them another chance. The villain messes with his hostages and proceeds to shatter their lives.Again we have seen this done so many times and done better for that matter. The audience is almost always one step ahead and you'll figure out most of the plot twists before they happen and that is pretty much never a good thing. William Morrissey doesn't write a bad script, just one that is very clich&eacute;d. Sometimes the movie can still be a fun ride, but not this time.Director Mike Barker doesn't do a bad job, but more often than not his scenes lack any real suspense or tension. In fairness the script was very clich&eacute;d so there is only so much he could do, but even the directing is by the books. All his scenes seem like a rehash of other movies and he never really tries to mix things up. Shattered wasn't a badly directed movie, but again it was just too by the book. There was a couple of fairly decent suspense moments, but not enough to really make this movie anything, but about average.About the only time Shattered does actually work well is the final act; there was some decent suspense and there is a pretty decent twist. First off you know Tom Ryan played by Pierce Brosnan has some kind of connection to the people he's messing with. That was the only thing I didn't figure out. The twist is hardly original, but it works well, but it's not that good a twist to salvage this movie.Brosnan though gives an excellent and even creepy performance to bad he was stuck in such a clich&eacute;d movie. Gerard Butler as Neil Randall also gives a good, but typical performance and the problem was he wasn't all that likeable and becomes even less likeable in the final act. Actually when the final act rolls around you might find yourself rooting for Brosnan's character rather than Butler's. Maria Bello delivers an excellent performance, but her role was just too typical for this type of movie. But Bello, handles the role well and is a much underrated actress.Like I said the biggest problem with Shattered is that it plays out exactly like every single suspense/thriller out there. It takes a very clich&eacute;d plot and never once offers us anything different. The final act though does offer a decent twist that if you pay close attention you might just be able to figure out. But the motive was a little extreme for what happened, but it does sort of work and makes Shattered a little better, but a good final act that still has some clich&eacute;s cannot save a movie filled with them.Despite my 2-star rating Shattered is by no means a bad movie; like I said it just suffers way too much from the been there, done that. Sometimes that can work well, but not in this case. Despite 2-stars, Shattered isn't bad, but due to the clich&eacute;s I had to deduct a star. This movie has gotten mixed reaction and I can understand why some people like it, but when all is said and done the lack of originality did it in for me.",2,"Not bad, but brought down by too many cliches",1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,4291,"['Going', 'Shattered', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'went', 'direct', 'video', 'Just', 'movie', 'DTV', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'could', 'be', 'studio', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'give', 'theatrical', 'run', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'movie', 'tough', 'market', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'mass', 'appeal', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'good.Seeing', 'cast', 'list', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'actress', 'quite', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'household', 'name', 'well', 'known', 'enough', 'not', 'go', 'DTV', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'quite', 'popular', 'right', 'now', 'course', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'reason', 'went', 'DTV', 'States', 'when', '3', 'known', 'actors', 'still', 'gave', 'movie', 'chance.As', 'whole', 'Shattered', 'bad', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'mostly', 'well', 'made', 'what', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'Writer', 'William', 'Morrissey', 'standard', 'suspense/thriller', 'man', 'couple', 'hostage', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'daughter', 'dies', 'one', 'most', 'over-used', 'plots', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'TV', 'as', 'well', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'concept', 'done', 'family', 'member', 'danger', 'course', 'point', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'villain', 'chance', 'villain', 'messes', 'hostages', 'proceeds', 'shatter', 'lives.Again', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'done', 'better', 'matter', 'audience', 'almost', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'most', 'plot', 'twists', 'happen', 'pretty', 'much', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'William', 'Morrissey', ""n't"", 'write', 'bad', 'script', 'just', 'one', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'ride', 'not', 'time.Director', 'Mike', 'Barker', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'scenes', 'lack', 'real', 'suspense', 'tension', 'fairness', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'do', 'even', 'directing', 'books', 'scenes', 'seem', 'rehash', 'other', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'Shattered', 'was', ""n't"", 'badly', 'directed', 'movie', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'book', 'was', 'couple', 'fairly', 'decent', 'suspense', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'anything', 'only', 'time', 'Shattered', 'actually', 'work', 'well', 'final', 'act', 'was', 'decent', 'suspense', 'pretty', 'decent', 'twist', 'First', 'know', 'Tom', 'Ryan', 'played', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'kind', 'connection', 'people', 'messing', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'twist', 'hardly', 'original', 'well', 'not', 'that', 'twist', 'salvage', 'movie.Brosnan', 'excellent', 'even', 'creepy', 'performance', 'bad', 'was', 'stuck', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'movie', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Neil', 'Randall', 'also', 'good', 'typical', 'performance', 'problem', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'even', 'less', 'likeable', 'final', 'act', 'Actually', 'when', 'final', 'act', 'rolls', 'might', 'find', 'rooting', 'Brosnan', 'character', 'rather', 'Butler', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'excellent', 'performance', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'typical', 'type', 'movie', 'Bello', 'role', 'well', 'much', 'underrated', 'said', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Shattered', 'out', 'exactly', 'single', 'suspense/thriller', 'there', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'never', 'once', 'anything', 'different', 'final', 'act', 'offer', 'decent', 'twist', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'motive', 'was', 'little', 'extreme', 'what', 'happened', 'sort', 'work', 'Shattered', 'little', 'better', 'good', 'final', 'act', 'still', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'filled', 'them.Despite', '2-star', 'rating', 'Shattered', 'bad', 'movie', 'said', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'work', 'well', 'not', 'case', '2-stars', 'Shattered', ""n't"", 'bad', 'due', 'clich', 'eacute', 'had', 'deduct', 'star', 'movie', 'gotten', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'lack', 'originality', 'did']",N/A

This is the story of a couple, Neil and Abby Randall, who on a night out, have their young daughter kidnapped. Neil is a successful businessman and Abby is a SaHM.  They are considered to be the perfect family, and for reasons we don&iexcl;t know just yet, Tom (Brosnan) wants to destroy everything they have.  While the daughter is at the house with the babysitter (who is working for Tom), Tom is holding holding Abby and Neil hostage riding around town making them do outrageous things (i.e. clean out their bank accts, deliver a sealed envelope to Neil&iexcl;s boss, etc).  Everything is designed to test just how much they are willing to give up.  Things tense up b/t the couple, and we start to see that maybe they&iexcl;re not so perfect after all.In the climax of the movie, we discover some interesting info that adds another dimension to the story.  Tom continues to bait Neil who is nearing a breaking point and Neil is forced to make a decision that could effectively destroy his life.  Near the end, there&iexcl;s another twist that lays all the pieces into place.I&iexcl;m very picky about movies and rarely go these dyas, but this is easily one that could find its way into my collection. I don't remember seeing any ads for this? The story wasn&iexcl;t anything groundbreaking, but due to excellent performances, steady pacing, and a straightforward storyline that didn&iexcl;t try to squeeze in tons of material, it was very easy to sit through w/no breaks.  I didn&iexcl;t figure out the first twist (that was a surprise), but I did, sort of, guess the second. Well, not really guess, but a certain scene put me on alert.  But to the movies credit, that didn&iexcl;t happen til the end   I also liked that there weren&iexcl;t really any loose ends.

1111126,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WP07F6,Grady Harp,"[18, 31]","SHATTERED (also known as BUTTERFLY ON A WHEEL) is one of those films that starts out with a solid cast of highly respected actors to pull audiences in and then proceeds to squander talent in a script that should be still on the reject shelf.  The film has all the markings and big budget of a major Hollywood money maker, but there is a very valid reason why the theatrical run was brief and unheralded, sending the movie to television and to DVD post haste: it just is a very weak work.Writer William Morrissey had a thought, camouflaged  behind the meaning of an obscure line from Pope ('butterfly on a wheel') that refers to the degree of torture one can take before breaking.  The problem is that this  tale of the consequences of infidelity has been done many, many times before with far better results.  The astute viewer will find all the cracks in the plot line of this supposed 'startling thriller' from the first few frames: watching suspicions play out is very anticlimactic.  Morrissey depends on what he imaged as a 'big surprise' ending and it just doesn't surprise!Gerard Butler, Maria Bello, and Pierce Brosnan are all strong actors and one wonders why they opted to participate in this movie. It is not the best work of any of the three, trying to make credible characters out of the double-sided puzzle: kidnapping, testing of relationships, facing consequences of behavior. Director Mike Barker lets the drama sag when it most needs to be pushed.  Unless the viewer just wants to see more of the three stars (even in a weak film) then that is the justification for sitting through this.  Otherwise, pass...

A husband and wife are the ideal couple, with husband working at a big company doing something or another.2. One day, out of the blue (or so it seems) a guy comes along and kidnaps the daughter of the husband and wife and takes the husband and wife for a ride-- during which he forces them to do his bidding.3. The Bad Man and the couple spend a lot of time together, with his forcing them to do progressively more humiliating things.4. Eventually, it reaches a head when it comes out that the husband is having an affair with another woman-- who happens to be the wife of the Bad Man.5. In the end, it comes out that the whole kidnapping was staged by the wife so that the husband could know what it felt like to lose everything.Comments:1. Pierce Brosnan looked extremely silly in this role. Maybe I've seen him in too many 007 movies, but believing him in this role was a real stretch.2. Can a person really believe that a wife would go through all of this to make a point to her husband?3. Can a plan like the one executed in this film really have gone off without a hitch? Even though there were SO many people that could have foiled it? Police everywhere. Banks with panic buttons all over the place.4. The suspense was waaaaayy too drawn out. When you stop to reconsider the movie, the plot was actually pretty thin. Do you mean to tell me that this was turned into a whole movie?5. The Bad Man gives the husband a gun (to shoot the victim) and the husband doesn't have sense enough to turn it on the Bad Man (who did not have a gun drawn at that time)?6.

She turns on the light and finds her husband with her birthday present.  They embrace and turn to find their little daughter watching them.  Off to bed they go.  The next morning is a typical one in the life of the Randalls of an upscale Chicago suburb.  Lovely house, beautiful little daughter, Abby's nice friend arriving, Neil being charming and heading off to work.But the menacing music as we pan over the tall buildings of Chicago, clue us that all is not as it seems as we are soon to discover.  We zoom in to see a man in dark clothes looking through binoculars, as Neil walks along the street below.Neil Randall (Gerard Butler -""300"") is shown in the next scenes to be narcissistic as he fixes his hair in the elevator mirror;  a shark at work who undermines his colleague while pretending to help him; and a flirt - if not worse.After a romantic dinner that evening with ""our song"" in the background, the next morning we see Abby (Maria Bello - ""History Of Violence"") and Neil welcoming the babysitter, and leaving for the day in the city.On the freeway husband and wife have minor chit-chat, when suddenly from the seat behind a man rises up with a gun.  And a very terrifying announcement - ""I've got your child.""This is Tom Ryan (Pierce Brosnan) and over the rest of this day he terrorizes the couple by making them do everything to dismantle their successful life.  Our job as viewers is to figure out the motivation of this guy.  What does he want?Neil is the ""shattered"" one by the end.  But Ryan will never be whole again, nor will Abby.  This story is of revenge, hate, distrust, infidelity and psychotic behavior.  So who does shatter a butterfly by using a cannon?Only those crazed by all of the above.I give this 7/10 and think it is a real 'water-cooler' film.

The parents (Butler and Bello) and the kidnapper (Brosnan) engage in a game: the kidnapper has them complete certain tasks in exchange for their daughter's life. Soon though, the parents realize that the tasks, while laying ruin to their own lives, bring no true advantage to the brute. But, all is not what it seems...While the seed of the idea is fantastic, it needs a Hitchcock level of skill before it can be transported into the ""gripping-thriller territory"". As it is, there are some severe holes in the plot that make the entire story unconvincing. I was never sold on the fact that the couple should have felt threatened to the point of obeying the kidnapper unquestioningly. Without this credibility, the entire story collapses. No story, no film...Furthermore, the movie does have a made-for-tv feel (it could be a good play...). I find it visually challenging as well, due to the monotonous colors: it is difficult to tell settings apart (with the exception of the all white interiors of the ""competition"" office).Skip it, unless you are a die hard fan of any of the three actors.

I'm usually very cautious regarding films in which this happens, but I loved the three stars in this film so much that I just had to take a chance on this film and I'm glad I did.I honestly can't reveal anything about the plot because, contrary to some reviewers on here, this is a solid mystery story that is a bit low-key and low-budget, hence, my ""TV"" film headline.  The film is a lot of fun as Pierce Brosnan, previously known as James Bond, gives an outstanding performance as ""the bad guy"" in this film who takes great pride in torturing a couple that is well-played by Butler,The Phantom of the Operaand Bello,World Trade Center.  I don't think his fans like him in such a role and that may be why this film suffered at the box-office just as his other excellently played bad guy role inThe Matadorwhich is definitely worth your viewing.  Add in a low-budget feel to the film and I can see why some bulked at it, but it is so much better than most will expect if they give it a shot.  Failure at the box-office does not mean the film is a failure or of no quality, just as great success at the box-office is no guarantee of a pleasurable experience either.Well, I don't want to go on further and inadvertently give up any information that will lead people to figure out the mystery in this film, but it is very clever and you will be very perplexed until the end when you finally discover just why Brosnan's character is angry at this couple that he does the outlandish things that he does.

It certainly seems at home on DVD. Before Bond, Pierce Brosnan's career was reduced to TV movies and direct-to-video outings, and with this his post-Bond career seems to be following suit - he even wears the same kind of leather jacket-and-designer-stubble combo he used to favour in the 80s and early 90s too. It's not difficult to see why this ended up skipping cinemas and ending up as a direct-to-DVD release (in the US it went straight to television): though it's a watchable enough family-in-peril thriller, for most of the running time it lacks the kind of quality to distinguish it from a good cable TV movie for all the energy director Mike Barker tries to inject in the proceedings.Gerard Butler is the perfect husband who has everything only to suddenly find Pierce Brosnan's bad tempered Irishman with a grudge forcing him and wife Maria Bello to play a game of Simon Says for their child's life. With the stakes constantly increasing as Brosnan strips everything away from Butler, it's obvious that there's a big twist down the line, but when it comes it's a doozy. Unfortunately, the first hour or so of the picture just can't match it, largely because of a typically dreadful performance from Butler, wildly overacting and over-emoting to absolutely no effect whatever in a performance that's as phoney as his terrible American accent that makes him sound like Chris Penn with a cold. With a decent leading man this could have worked a lot better, but he has neither the charisma nor the acting ability to make you believe in, let alone care about the character. By contrast Brosnan is good (though he's been better) and Maria Bello is superb, especially in her latter scenes, but Butler's hamming sadly sinks most of it until the last 25 minutes throw in enough neat twists to at least partially fill the void at the film's centre. There is one neat scene in the middle of the film when Brosnan's plans are briefly interrupted when he runs into the very last person from his regular life he expected to see, though...",3,Butterfly on a Wheel,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2234,"['Uniting', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', 'Bond', 'Man', 'Who', 'Desperately', 'Wanted', 'Be', 'Bond', 'Butterfly', 'Wheel', 'aka', 'Shattered', 'probably', 'lot', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'big', 'one', 'certainly', 'home', 'DVD', 'Bond', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'career', 'was', 'reduced', 'TV', 'movies', 'direct-to-video', 'outings', 'post-Bond', 'career', 'be', 'following', 'suit', 'even', 'same', 'kind', 'leather', 'jacket-and-designer-stubble', 'combo', 'used', 'favour', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'too', 'not', 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'skipping', 'cinemas', 'ending', 'up', 'direct-to-DVD', 'release', 'US', 'went', 'straight', 'television', 'watchable', 'enough', 'family-in-peril', 'thriller', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'kind', 'quality', 'distinguish', 'good', 'cable', 'TV', 'movie', 'energy', 'director', 'Mike', 'Barker', 'inject', 'proceedings.Gerard', 'Butler', 'perfect', 'husband', 'who', 'everything', 'only', 'suddenly', 'find', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'bad', 'tempered', 'Irishman', 'grudge', 'forcing', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'play', 'game', 'Simon', 'Says', 'child', 'life', 'stakes', 'constantly', 'increasing', 'Brosnan', 'everything', 'away', 'Butler', 'obvious', 'big', 'twist', 'line', 'when', 'doozy', 'Unfortunately', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'picture', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'largely', 'typically', 'dreadful', 'performance', 'Butler', 'wildly', 'overacting', 'over-emoting', 'absolutely', 'effect', 'whatever', 'performance', 'as', 'phoney', 'terrible', 'American', 'accent', 'sound', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'cold', 'decent', 'leading', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'lot', 'better', 'charisma', 'acting', 'ability', 'make', 'believe', 'let', 'alone', 'care', 'character', 'contrast', 'Brosnan', 'good', 'been', 'better', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'superb', 'especially', 'latter', 'scenes', 'Butler', 'hamming', 'sadly', 'most', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'throw', 'enough', 'neat', 'twists', 'least', 'partially', 'fill', 'void', 'film', 'centre', 'one', 'neat', 'scene', 'middle', 'film', 'when', 'Brosnan', 'plans', 'are', 'briefly', 'interrupted', 'when', 'very', 'last', 'person', 'regular', 'life', 'expected', 'see']",N/A

Other movies, like director Mike Barker's psychological melodrama ""Shattered"" (***** out of *****) [a.k.a. ""Butterfly on a Wheel""] with Pierce Brosnan & Gerald Butler, pose problems because you cannot plunge into details without divulging crucial plot points that would ruin the film's quotient of mystery and suspense for folks who want to see it. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Shattered,"" but my closest and dearest friends absolutely detested it from start to finish. Evidently, the film did not fare well at the box office because it didn't play in the sticks where I live, Columbus, Mississippi, and it didn't last long in theaters. Since I don't subscribe to the crappy cable where I lived, little did I know that it premiered on TNT. I envy those audiences that did see it in theaters. Again, I had a blast watching this tense, white-knuckled, nightmare of a suspense thriller.The first time that I saw Mike Barker's ""Shattered,"" I watched it with the commentary track playing because I had bought it used at a Movie Gallery sale in case the DVD skipped and I had to wait any length of time before I could replace it. . I've never had a problem watching a movie that I learn stuff about as I am watching it. In fact, the second time that I watched ""Shattered,"" I appreciated it the way some people savor good food. Now, the married couple that saw ""Shattered"" took an immediate dislike to it and the surprise ending didn't leaving them gasping, and they generally didn't like anything about it, especially Maria Bello.Pierce Brosnan, the former James Bond on the big-screen and Remington Steele on the small screen, has been monkeying around with his cinematic persona since the Bond producers sent him packing after ""Die Another Day."" He let his belly hang out in ""After the Sunset,"" admittedly a routine caper film, and most recently, he sang in ""Mama Mia."" Between these epics, Brosnan played the villain in ""Shattered"" and he is convincing without going overboard as a psychotic lunatic.An unshaven renegade with a grudge, Tom Ryan (Pierce Brosnan) forces his way into the lives of successful Chicago advertising executive Neil Randal (Gerald Butler of ""300"") and his pretty blond wife Abby (Maria Bello of ""Payback"") as Neil is taking Abby off to a girls' night out rendezvous before he leaves on a jet for a trip with his boss. No sooner have our happily married couple hit the road than Tom pops up out of the backseat and holds them at gunpoint. Not surprisingly, Neil and Abby react with shock and their shock intensifies when Tom explains that the babysitter is part of his grand kidnapping scheme. Tom assures the Randalls that with his cell phone he can order his accomplice to kill their adorable little girl Sophie if they refuse to follow his orders.Now, if you're the kind of person that likes to pick holes in plots before the film has even reached its climax, you will HATE ""Shattered."" My friends were bombarding me with questions and trying to guess the outcome. The wife had figured part of it out, but there was a red herring that threw them off the scent for a while. Anyway, Tom has been watching Neil so we know that he knows something and the something that Tom knows is the exact amount of Neil's bank account, over $142-thousand dollars. At this point, we know that Neil is an egotistical sort of guy and that he has a knack for landing big accounts at his advertising agency. The Randalls have a luxurious house in the Chicago suburbs and Abby is a photographer. She appears to be happy with her husband because the sky seems to be the limit for Neil. Neil has a lot of tenacity and he isn't afraid to admit it. He is a tiger at what he does, until he runs into Tom. At the bank, Neil and Abby withdraw everything and hand it over in an attach&eacute; case to Tom. Tom wastes no time. He pulls out a sheaf of bills and sets fire to it and then he drops the burning currency into the attach&eacute; case and tosses it lock, stock, and barrel off a bridge in Chicago.Indeed, ""Shattered"" is for all practical purposes a kidnap thriller and initially I was intrigued but grew impatient with it. However, the more that I watched it, the more entertaining it became. Nobody gave a bad performance and I loved the surprise ending. Unfortunately, I don't want to say anything else, except I feel that ""Shattered"" qualifies as an excellent, edge-of-your seat movie and happily most of the people who wrote about it at Amazon shared my sentiments. The filmmakers took the original title ""Butterfly on a Wheel"" from an Alexander Pope poem that basically translates as smashing a butterfly with a hammer with a fly swatter would serve the same purpose. Once you see the film, you'll understand the title. I love watching Maria Bello in any film and I wish that her career were more prestigious than it is because she is a talented lady. Altogether, my review doesn't do justice to this spine-tingling, nail-biter that ripples with one surprise after another surprise.""Shattered"" is in the same league with the fantastic David Fincher thriller ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas and ""Derailed"" with Clive Owen. Although ""Shattered"" received an R-rating, this hairraising opus contains no nudity, little bloodshed, but several tense moments and ""B. Monkey"" lenser Ashley Rowe's scintillating widescreen photography at times may induce vertigo.",5,"This Surprise-Laden, White-Knuckled Suspense Thriller Casts Pierce Brosnan as the
