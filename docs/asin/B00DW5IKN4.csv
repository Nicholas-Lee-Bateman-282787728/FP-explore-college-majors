1661976,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00DW5IKN4,a,"[1, 1]","Like many, I've been a fan of Gillian Anderson since ""The X-Files,"" yet like many, I have actually not seen her in very much over these many years except for a few films and occasional television appearances. I was excited to see her in her own series, albeit a limited five-episode arc that runs just slightly over five hours. Anderson is excellent, as I suspected she would be, but there's actually a lot more to like about ""The Fall"" than just her star performance. ""The Fall"" is an intense, dark, and richly detailed character study of a serial killer and the police investigator dedicated to tracking him down.Though clearly Anderson is the star as Detective Stella Gibson, it's the killer himself, Paul Spector (played by Jamie Dornan) who really sells the series and probably has a slight majority on screen time. Unlike most police procedurals, there really is no murder mystery here. The killer is known from the start, and at least half the series is devoted to exploring his two-part world, that of a devoted husband and father and that of a troubled loner who stalks and murders young women. In a series that's very subtle and intelligent, one of the least subtle ironies is that the killer has a more stable life than the detective on his trail. Beyond the pursuit of the serial killer, ""The Fall"" boasts a couple of interesting, possibly connected subplots and vivid supporting characters, including Anderson's supervisor, a flirtatious babysitter, and the killer's unsuspecting wife. As other reviewers have pointed out, the pace is slow and sometime plodding, much like real police work. That said, that was not much of a problem for me. I actually appreciated the methodical exploration of the characters and the realistic crime scene investigation. I've always thought wrapping up murder mysteries in 42 minutes plus commercials was a real cheat, and it pleased me to really invest myself in a story arc that slowly played itself out.In that way, ""The Fall"" reminded me a little of ""Twin Peaks."" Like FBI Agent Dale Cooper on ""Twin Peaks,"" Gillian Anderson, an outsider brought in to help local law enforcement, sticks around to solve a particular crime, and along the way finds out that there's a lot more going on than she anticipated. Also like ""Peaks,"" as others have mentioned, ""The Fall"" has no resolution at the end of this first series. But my comment is, why should it? Most television series have gripping cliff hangers that encourage people to tune back in after a break. Production is slated to begin on the second series in January 2014, and I suspect I might be able to view it about a year from now. That's a while to wait, of course, but I've waited a lot longer in-between episodes of ""Doctor Who."" Ultimately, I liked ""The Fall"" enough to return for a second visit whenever that should occur. While perhaps a bit slow at times, I appreciated the pace and look forward to the day when I can see this story through to the end.",4,"Methodical, character-driven crime drama",1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,2960,"['many', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'X-Files', 'yet', 'many', 'have', 'actually', 'not', 'seen', 'very', 'much', 'many', 'years', 'few', 'films', 'occasional', 'television', 'appearances', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'own', 'series', 'limited', 'five-episode', 'arc', 'just', 'slightly', 'five', 'hours', 'Anderson', 'excellent', 'suspected', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'lot', 'more', 'like', 'Fall', 'just', 'star', 'performance', 'Fall', 'intense', 'dark', 'richly', 'detailed', 'character', 'study', 'serial', 'killer', 'police', 'investigator', 'dedicated', 'tracking', 'down.Though', 'clearly', 'Anderson', 'star', 'Detective', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'killer', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'who', 'really', 'series', 'probably', 'slight', 'majority', 'screen', 'time', 'most', 'police', 'procedurals', 'really', 'murder', 'mystery', 'here', 'killer', 'known', 'start', 'least', 'series', 'devoted', 'exploring', 'two-part', 'world', 'devoted', 'husband', 'father', 'troubled', 'loner', 'who', 'murders', 'young', 'women', 'series', 'very', 'subtle', 'intelligent', 'one', 'least', 'subtle', 'ironies', 'killer', 'more', 'stable', 'life', 'detective', 'trail', 'pursuit', 'serial', 'killer', 'Fall', 'couple', 'interesting', 'possibly', 'connected', 'subplots', 'vivid', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'Anderson', 'supervisor', 'flirtatious', 'babysitter', 'killer', 'unsuspecting', 'wife', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'pace', 'slow', 'sometime', 'plodding', 'much', 'real', 'police', 'work', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'problem', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'methodical', 'exploration', 'characters', 'realistic', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'wrapping', 'up', 'murder', 'mysteries', '42', 'minutes', 'plus', 'commercials', 'was', 'real', 'cheat', 'pleased', 'really', 'invest', 'story', 'arc', 'slowly', 'played', 'out.In', 'way', 'Fall', 'reminded', 'little', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Dale', 'Cooper', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'outsider', 'brought', 'help', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'sticks', 'solve', 'particular', 'crime', 'way', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'anticipated', 'Also', 'Peaks', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Fall', 'resolution', 'end', 'first', 'series', 'comment', 'why', 'should', 'Most', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'gripping', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'encourage', 'people', 'tune', 'back', 'break', 'Production', 'slated', 'begin', 'second', 'series', 'January', '2014', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'year', 'now', 'while', 'wait', 'course', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'lot', 'longer', 'in-between', 'episodes', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Ultimately', 'liked', 'Fall', 'enough', 'return', 'second', 'visit', 'whenever', 'should', 'occur', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'appreciated', 'pace', 'look', 'forward', 'day', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'end']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

I liked how it took it's time to tell the story,  how little details were preserved.  This could have been rushed into a 2 hour film,  but giving it 5 hours to tell the tale allowed for quiet moments,  for an expansion of detail.  I loved almost everything about it,  how complex Stella Gibson (Anderson) was,  how hard to read her character;  all the cops and their foibles; the density of the politics,  regular office politics but overshadowed by the Irishness of it all.  I loved the depiction of the serial killer,  how you sat through his work with him,  the domestic moments and then the obsessive killing moments.Spoilers ahead -I was not expecting the ending I got,  but I found it curiously satisfying nonetheless.

1661979,A1248JRIINWRTH,B00DW5IKN4,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[0, 0]","The Fall uses the same playbook as The Killing, but isn't quite as engaging as the latter.Gillian Anderson plays a tough detective trying to catch a killer. The show does a great job of showing the parallels between her character and the killer, played by Jaimie Dornan. But really, that's about all. It does get a bit more intense toward the end - especially as the killings escalate. There are a few odd crimes that will tie to the serial killer, but it was hard to say just how and why.Unfortunately, overall the show is slow. It saves those WOW moments for the very end - which makes it a long journey between episodes. The Killing kept viewers going through entire episodes. I think the show could have been done in about two hours rather than five episodes.This season did not end. I was pretty aggravated at The Killing for not finding Rosie Larsen's killer at the end of the first season. I wasn't as aggravated here, because I wasn't nearly as engaged with The Fall.The Fall isn't bad, but it isn't a must-watch for me. It might be interesting to see the detective catch the killer, but I'm not interested in watching several seasons for that to happen.If you are looking for the next The Killing, this isn't exactly it, but if you like the serial format - where you get a cliffhanger ending until the next season - this show might be for you.",3,"Slow, but intense",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1352,"['Fall', 'same', 'playbook', 'Killing', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'engaging', 'latter.Gillian', 'Anderson', 'tough', 'detective', 'trying', 'catch', 'killer', 'show', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'parallels', 'character', 'killer', 'played', 'Jaimie', 'Dornan', 'really', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'end', 'especially', 'killings', 'escalate', 'are', 'few', 'odd', 'crimes', 'will', 'tie', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'hard', 'say', 'just', 'how', 'why.Unfortunately', 'show', 'slow', 'WOW', 'moments', 'very', 'end', 'long', 'journey', 'episodes', 'Killing', 'kept', 'viewers', 'going', 'entire', 'episodes', 'think', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'about', 'two', 'hours', 'rather', 'five', 'episodes.This', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'aggravated', 'Killing', 'not', 'finding', 'Rosie', 'Larsen', 'killer', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'aggravated', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'engaged', 'Fall.The', 'Fall', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'must-watch', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'detective', 'catch', 'killer', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'watching', 'several', 'seasons', 'happen.If', 'are', 'looking', 'next', 'Killing', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'like', 'serial', 'format', 'where', 'get', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'next', 'season', 'show', 'might', 'be']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"
1661980,A3K4SHKV5H9OSU,B00DW5IKN4,"Anonymous ""Anonymous""","[0, 0]","Binge-watching-worthy set of five episodes. If you like suspenseful, scary detective story thrillers that keep you tensely (in a cathartic way) watching to see what happens next, you may, like me, fall for this series. Warning- violence and corruption abounds. Gillian Anderson is outstanding as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson.  Gillian doesn't need great lines so much as she simply is an expressive actress.  She may be icy, of few words, but she projects so much. Her character is very focused and cerebral and is the first to realize there are linked, serial murders happening in Belfast. Her nemesis, serial murderer Paul Spector, is a revelation as the type of psychopath that is never suspected by anyone.  One realizes the damage he does will be staggeringly magnified once he is caught and people who knew him will be cut to the quick trying to comprehend how this grief counselor, father of two young children and husband to a devoted trusting wife, hid a furtive double life of depraved premeditated murderer.  At one point Spector's wife puzzles about their 8 year old daughter's recurring nightmares, and wishes she knew what was going on in her daughter's mind.  Spector,who is hiding his drawings, photos, murder trophies, and journal in the crawl space just above his daughter's bed, says, ""No one knows what's going on in someone else's mind.  Life would be terrible if we did.""In some ways this series reminds me of ""The Wire"".  It holds nothing back and equally exposes the multi-leveled corruption as it follows the police involved in the investigation as well as the miscreant and his family.  Although the writing and story are compelling, it is the acting and directing that are so well done here. It is not so much the beauty of the presentation, as it is fascinating as the camera hunts and stalks, often from intriguing angles,  and reveals to the viewer, just what is really happening here.I often watch ""Criminal Minds"" on TV.  Although the acting and problem solving are very good,they present a complete story in a limited hour framework. I am often left wanting something more.  Sure there is the great camaraderie on Criminal Minds, excellent actors, and a plot--sometimes too gruesome to bear watching. Then mystery is solved, and it all ends so quickly with perhaps a final scene with the team flying home and usually a great literate quote.  In contrast, this extended multi-episode style of presenting one case, feels more intimate and gives more character input to ponder. At times the narrative parallels the various characters: Spector and his shadow journal, Detective Gibson and her dream journal during the night and the daughter's teacher at school calling both parents in for a conference over the daughter's drawings.  The teacher is concerned about the  drawings and how they relate to what's going on at home. Or a sequence with Spector setting out on another skulking murder, which may end with him bathing the corpse and posing it for photos, while his wife, a neonatal nurse, attends a grieving parent who can not bear to let go of her newborn child who has just passed. She kindly suggests she bathe and dress the baby so the mother may take some photos before releasing her child. There's a stoic Detective Gibson swimming her morning laps in the pool while in another part of Belfast Spector is out on a morning training jog, and so on. The series has been approved to film another season, ""The Fall"".  Quite a disturbing series, and a clarion call for mankind to step up and look at how we are functioning on this planet.",5,A series worthy of Gillian Anderson,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3583,"['Binge-watching-worthy', 'set', 'five', 'episodes', 'like', 'suspenseful', 'scary', 'detective', 'story', 'thrillers', 'keep', 'tensely', 'cathartic', 'way', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'may', 'fall', 'series', 'Warning-', 'violence', 'corruption', 'abounds', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'outstanding', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'Gillian', ""n't"", 'need', 'great', 'lines', 'so', 'much', 'simply', 'expressive', 'actress', 'may', 'be', 'icy', 'few', 'words', 'projects', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'very', 'focused', 'cerebral', 'first', 'realize', 'are', 'linked', 'serial', 'murders', 'happening', 'Belfast', 'nemesis', 'serial', 'murderer', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'revelation', 'type', 'psychopath', 'never', 'suspected', 'anyone', 'One', 'damage', 'will', 'be', 'staggeringly', 'magnified', 'once', 'caught', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'will', 'be', 'cut', 'quick', 'trying', 'comprehend', 'how', 'grief', 'counselor', 'father', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'husband', 'devoted', 'trusting', 'wife', 'hid', 'furtive', 'double', 'life', 'depraved', 'premeditated', 'murderer', 'one', 'point', 'Spector', 'wife', 'puzzles', '8', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'recurring', 'nightmares', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'daughter', 'mind', 'Spector', 'who', 'hiding', 'drawings', 'photos', 'murder', 'trophies', 'journal', 'crawl', 'space', 'just', 'daughter', 'bed', 'one', 'what', 'going', 'someone', 'else', 'mind', 'Life', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'did', 'ways', 'series', 'Wire', 'nothing', 'back', 'equally', 'multi-leveled', 'corruption', 'police', 'involved', 'investigation', 'as', 'well', 'miscreant', 'family', 'writing', 'story', 'are', 'compelling', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'beauty', 'presentation', 'fascinating', 'camera', 'hunts', 'stalks', 'often', 'intriguing', 'angles', 'reveals', 'viewer', 'just', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'here.I', 'often', 'watch', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'TV', 'acting', 'problem', 'solving', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'present', 'complete', 'story', 'limited', 'hour', 'framework', 'am', 'often', 'left', 'wanting', 'something', 'more', 'Sure', 'great', 'camaraderie', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'excellent', 'actors', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'too', 'gruesome', 'bear', 'watching', 'Then', 'mystery', 'solved', 'so', 'quickly', 'perhaps', 'final', 'scene', 'team', 'flying', 'home', 'usually', 'great', 'literate', 'quote', 'contrast', 'extended', 'multi-episode', 'style', 'presenting', 'one', 'case', 'feels', 'more', 'intimate', 'more', 'character', 'input', 'ponder', 'times', 'narrative', 'parallels', 'various', 'characters', 'Spector', 'shadow', 'journal', 'Detective', 'Gibson', 'dream', 'journal', 'night', 'daughter', 'teacher', 'school', 'calling', 'parents', 'conference', 'daughter', 'drawings', 'teacher', 'concerned', 'drawings', 'how', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'home', 'sequence', 'Spector', 'setting', 'out', 'skulking', 'murder', 'may', 'end', 'bathing', 'corpse', 'posing', 'photos', 'wife', 'neonatal', 'nurse', 'grieving', 'parent', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'let', 'go', 'newborn', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'passed', 'kindly', 'bathe', 'dress', 'baby', 'mother', 'may', 'take', 'photos', 'releasing', 'child', 'stoic', 'Detective', 'Gibson', 'swimming', 'morning', 'laps', 'pool', 'part', 'Belfast', 'Spector', 'out', 'morning', 'training', 'jog', 'so', 'series', 'been', 'approved', 'film', 'season', 'Fall', 'disturbing', 'series', 'clarion', 'call', 'mankind', 'step', 'up', 'look', 'how', 'are', 'functioning', 'planet']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","This British/Irish crime series drama--five episodes around an hour each in length--by Allan Cubitt will chill the viewer with its stunningly eerie portrayal of serial killer Paul Spector (no spoiler here, the identity of the killer from the viewer's perspective is known from the start) as he shuffles his penchant for murder, his life as a loving husband/father and his role as a draw-outside-the-lines grief counselor.  Played by Jamie Dornan in a departure from his role as the ""Huntsman""in ABC's Once Upon A Time, Spector relentlessly scopes out his potential kills with the methodical relish of an art connoisseur acquiring just the right work of art to further complete his collection. With his choir boy looks foiling his Herculean strength, he manages to trigger a fresh sense of lurid fascination for viewers despite the fact that they have cut their eye teeth on the character of Hannibal Lector and have subsequently become immune to the horrific details of the unconventional mind. Spector intrigues; in spite of being inundated with Dexter, Dr. Joe Carroll of ""The Following"" and a raft of other killer crazies, we want to know what his backstory is.  Why does he kill?  Why only brunettes?  And why the poses?In a parallel narrative format, Gillian Anderson of X-Files fame enters as the cool, calm and collected British detective Stella Gibson in the still troubled arena of Northern Ireland who eventually delineates some pattern to what others see as random crimes. The viewer does not know much about Gibson other than the fact that she is driven, intellectually and educationally challenging and has a penchant for one night stands that she calls ""sweet nights."" Her seemingly emotionless focus is anything but--her underlying sensitivity seems comparatively cold when viewed alongside her male colleagues. Nonetheless, in these five episodes, she is bent on the successful discovery and arrest of this killer who seems hard-pressed to ramp up his lurid activities in a crescendo of action whose speed precipitates some mistakes that are devoid of his former and complete anonymity. As she tightens the noose around Spector's neck, we find out a scant more about her personal life with full awareness that more of this will be revealed as the series continues onward into further seasons.The turbulent city of Belfast acts as a frenetic backdrop to the crimes; the killings are viewed by its investigators as affiliated with some long shadow cast by the city's historic troubles. Add to this state of perpetual unrest side stories that include a seductive fifteen year old babysitter, the execution of a police officer, a sleazy escort service, die-hard underground groups with long memories and the police prejudice amped by long-term religious sides.  The result?  A chaotic blend of fact and fiction that breathes with a gritty reality.Bottom line? The BBC series ""The Fall"" is being renewed for a second season where more will be revealed about Detective Superintendent Gibson and serial killer Paul Spector.

1662001,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00DW5IKN4,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""The Fall: Series One"". . . .Fans of edgy modern crime dramas such as ""Prime Suspect,"" ""Luther,"" and ""The Killing"" will find a lot to celebrate in this magnificently produced, methodically unsettling series, starring Gillian Anderson as an English police inspector placed in charge of a Belfast-area manhunt for a serial killer who stalks women and strangles them in their homes.Anderson's performance as Inspector Stella Gibson is one of the enigmatic portrayals in contemporary police dramas, best matched by Mireille Enos' equally prickly Det. Sarah Linden, in ""The Killing."" Inspector Gibson is more of a cipher than Linden, however, a fiercely capable, utterly focussed criminologist who is seemingly ""all about the job."" The inner demons that drive other TV detectives clearly exist for Gibson, but by the end of this season, we still have no idea what they are. Her prim, icy detective is balanced by a far more complex, infinitely more unnerving portrayal of the killer (played by Irish actor Jamie Dornan) a seemingly normal family man who is compulsively and fetishistically drawn to the most sadistic and gruesome of crimes, a process that the audience sees from beginning to end, as the police follow up, steadily putting the clues together and drawing the net tighter.  Although I am not a fan of either police procedurals (ala ""CSI,"" etc) or of snuff shows in general, this complex, genuinely horrifying drama was utterly compelling, and crept into the recesses of my mind up until the last episode, an ending that made me eager for the next installment (which sadly isn't scheduled to broadcast for another year or so...)In short, this is a very good, very intelligent crime show. Well written, well acted and superbly directed, with plenty to recommend it to discerning viewers across the globe. Give it a try - you'll be glad you did.

1662003,A26DQMYF5E0GL6,B00DW5IKN4,Don Walton Jr.,"[0, 0]","The premise is basic enough, Gillian Anderson plays a no-nonsense detective with 'hundreds of degrees' who comes to Belfast to solve a murder.  While she's there, more murders pop up and she notices a trend and points towards a probable serial killer.  At the same time, we as viewers, spend just as much time, if not more with the killer.  Going through his methods and stalking his victims, but also watching him get the squeeze from his boss at work, feeding his children, dealing with day-to-day home situations, etc.  It's not in a 'Dexter' sort of way, and I never felt sympathetic towards the serial killer.  He's not an antihero, he's a psycho.  Anderson has many faults of her own throughout the short, five-episode season, as well.  I guess the show creator is trying to show both leads as fallible humans.The way the killer leaves obvious indications of his presence (leaving an orange peel behind, taking a cup of hot tea, etc) felt like he was just dying to interact from outside of his comfort zone.  Like the guy who throws half a Miller Lite at the stage during a Ted Nugent concert.  It's an anonymous gesture, but instantly gets the victims attention.  This kind of detail added a different dimension to the killer, and was a nice touch to flesh out his motivations.My only knock on the series is the inclusion of a few odd side stories.  The first victim we meet has an estranged husband, whom we assume will be a prime suspect, but instead is throwing coke and hooker parties and having his daddy clean up his mess.  It didn't feel interesting and I had to remind myself what show I was watching.  There's also a lot of infidelity subplots involving both the leads and minor characters.  Again, at this point in the series, it didn't make much sense or add anything.  I'm a fan of films that let the audience settle in with the characters (Jackie Brown and There Will Be Blood for example) and 'The Fall' felt like a five hour movie that really lets you get comfortable.  You pretty well know how the characters will react to certain situations, so when they drop the ball, it feels jilted.  The killer sets up a weird safety net when he finally gets a chance to meet with the police.  It felt sloppy.  The ending is very unusual and I have to assume that the large 'SERIES 1' in the title of the DVD means another series is coming soon.The tension is tight.  The dialog is sharp.  The acting is top notch.  The environments are well constructed.  Overall, I really enjoyed this very 'adult' thriller from episode to episode, and will look forward to future 'series' entries.",4,Not Dexter and not quite The Shield either...,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,2595,"['premise', 'basic', 'enough', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'no-nonsense', 'detective', ""'hundreds"", 'degrees', 'who', 'Belfast', 'solve', 'murder', 'there', 'more', 'murders', 'pop', 'up', 'trend', 'points', 'probable', 'serial', 'killer', 'same', 'time', 'viewers', 'spend', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'not', 'more', 'killer', 'Going', 'methods', 'stalking', 'victims', 'also', 'watching', 'get', 'squeeze', 'boss', 'work', 'feeding', 'children', 'dealing', 'day-to-day', 'home', 'situations', 'etc', 'not', ""'Dexter"", 'sort', 'way', 'never', 'felt', 'sympathetic', 'serial', 'killer', 'not', 'antihero', 'psycho', 'Anderson', 'many', 'faults', 'own', 'short', 'five-episode', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'show', 'creator', 'trying', 'show', 'leads', 'fallible', 'humans.The', 'way', 'killer', 'obvious', 'indications', 'presence', 'leaving', 'orange', 'peel', 'taking', 'cup', 'hot', 'tea', 'etc', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'dying', 'interact', 'outside', 'comfort', 'zone', 'guy', 'who', 'Miller', 'Lite', 'stage', 'Ted', 'Nugent', 'concert', 'anonymous', 'gesture', 'instantly', 'victims', 'attention', 'kind', 'detail', 'added', 'different', 'dimension', 'killer', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'flesh', 'out', 'motivations.My', 'only', 'knock', 'series', 'inclusion', 'few', 'odd', 'side', 'stories', 'first', 'victim', 'meet', 'estranged', 'husband', 'whom', 'assume', 'will', 'be', 'prime', 'suspect', 'instead', 'throwing', 'coke', 'hooker', 'parties', 'having', 'daddy', 'up', 'mess', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'interesting', 'had', 'remind', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'watching', 'also', 'lot', 'infidelity', 'subplots', 'involving', 'leads', 'minor', 'characters', 'Again', 'point', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'add', 'anything', ""'m"", 'fan', 'films', 'let', 'audience', 'settle', 'characters', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'example', 'Fall', 'felt', 'five', 'hour', 'movie', 'really', 'get', 'comfortable', 'pretty', 'well', 'know', 'how', 'characters', 'will', 'react', 'certain', 'situations', 'so', 'when', 'drop', 'ball', 'jilted', 'killer', 'up', 'weird', 'safety', 'net', 'when', 'finally', 'chance', 'meet', 'police', 'felt', 'sloppy', 'ending', 'very', 'unusual', 'have', 'assume', 'large', '1', 'title', 'DVD', 'series', 'coming', 'soon.The', 'tension', 'tight', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'environments', 'are', 'well', 'constructed', 'Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'thriller', 'episode', 'episode', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'future', ""'series"", 'entries']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"
1662004,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B00DW5IKN4,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[1, 1]","Like many others, when I saw The Fall staring Gillian Anderson I jumped on this two disk BBC television show.  I found the show to be quite engrossing, with fairly tight writing, and Gillian Anderson continues to provide strong performances as a British female detective in a male dominated field of employment.  To a certain degree Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) is more profiler than detective, which I really enjoy.  The main antagonist, Paul Spector, a serial killer who is terrorizing Belfast is a refreshing character, who is given nearly equal air time allowing for greater depth to his character.  Unlike nearly all other serial killers portrayed in shows, Paul Spector has a wife and two children who are (obviously/thankfully) unaware of his activities. Moreover, he ironically works as a bereavement counselor, a position that allows him the freedom to access victims and stalk/kill without causing suspicion.  I also like the fact that The Fall is an on-going show, and not an episodic show.What I was disappointed about was the fact that The Fall, Series 1, is only five episodes long (306 minutes)!  Just enough to whittle ones appetite, then leaving them to unfortunately wait a full year for the next series.  There is a 12 minute behind the scenes featurette that I found quite wanting, nor are there any commentaries.

Everyone knows her best as Scully from the ""X Files"" but she has shown that she has quite a range as an actress.  This time, she is an investigator flown in from London to investigate a string of murders in Belfast, Ireland.  As always, Gillian does the ""sexy professor"" gig amazingly well!The series also stars Jamie Dornan as a man with a double-life.  By day, he is a family man with a wife & 2 kids and a career as a shrink.  By night, he has a hunger to strangle women to death.  Dornan is convincing as the intelligent, cunning & meticulous whackjob.  As a sidenote, I just hope this project doesn't have an adverse affect on his real-world social life!All things Irish must have 3 components:  a somber tone, a great deal of passion (think William Butler Yeats here) and a fiery Irish redhead.  THE FALL delivers on all 3 facets, with Niamh McGrady delivering the ""goods"" on the Irish redhead facet of the production.  She portrays a compassionate Belfast police officer who feels guilt for not being able to protect 1 of the eventual victims.  As a Thespian she is, in short, dazzling!  I'd like to see more projects of her's in the future.This is a high drama, kind of like the C.S.I. shows, only with a great deal more character depth & development.  THE FALL is dark & subtle.

Besides she is easy on the eyes, truth be told, she is downright sexy. This may be part of why I liked this season premier of The Fall. Some of the things I did not like was how difficult it was for me at times to understand what they were saying, in English mind you. Another thing I did not care for was the darkness, black and grey blue visual tones that sets the tone for this  crime drama. I believe this was done to emphasize the darkness of the subject matter. Is there a color to represent creepy? If so maybe they saturated the  screen with it. This show had me feeling the heebie-jeebies  throughout  it's duration. The music fits the mood  the storyline perfectly, it is disturbingly right on point. The moments of silence before the serial murderer strikes, the pacing and panning of the camera all create an atmosphere that makes you want to hide under your blanket. The show quickly reveals who the killer is and it then becomes a study in human or in this case inhumane nature. The killer is a creepy guy because he could be your neighbor.......or guidance counselor. Imagine that , taking guidance from a serial killer. When he starts messing around with the baby sitter you want reach out for the TV and say that is enough and tell the girl to run as fast as she can from this guy.  The irony and profile of the madman, as it is revealed, is like the slow dance of death he methodically carries out on his unsuspecting victims. The show is as much about the killer as it is about dear Detective Superintendent Gillian. What is revealed is a contrast in character study where  what appears to be good is evil. When the new police  Detective Superintendent Gibson arrives in Belfast to take control she quickly learns that a killer is on the loose, not to mention the political situations surrounding Belfast, Ireland, a hotbed of radical politics where a murder is being investigated. The pace is slow and deliberate but extremely captivating. I was sucked in even though I didn't want to see this guy in action and was hoping against hope that the beautiful red head heroine would catch this guy and the show would come to a happy conclusion. Instead I followed the story to the end only to be disappointed with Sir Creeps-a lot riding off into the sunset much like that other serial murderer, Dexter. As much as I didn't like the ending it did not take away from the drama and the inevitable message that the killer is always amongst us.

1662010,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00DW5IKN4,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 3]","Save for Jack the Ripper, the serial killer phenomenon is comparatively new to us and it continues to fascinate us. It's a central theme to any number of movies and TV series'. There are a wide variety of approaches to it and this is one of the better and more unique entries into the genre.Here's the scoop. Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) is brought in to help solve a murder case in Belfast. She sees a link to an earlier murder which no one else wants to make. When a third murder occurs she's convinced they're dealing with a serial killer. She forms a task force and uses her smarts to try and find the killer.This is a very smart and subtle approach to the genre. It's not overwrought or another exercise in histrionics. It's clever and quiet (maybe too quiet for American sensibilities). You get an in depth look into the killer's world, and they don't dump his entire back story on you at one time. You get little bits and pieces of it throughout all five episodes. It shows up in almost unnoticeable ways. Look at the women he kills and then look at his wife. Likewise with Anderson's Gibson. She is the other side of the same coin. She's well educated, as is he, and needs to exert control over those around her, as does he. She's a female professional in a man's world. She's pretty and dresses in subtly, sexy clothing. It keeps the men around her off balance. There is good use of leitmotif. You really need to keep your eyeballs pealed to catch some of the nuance. There are some side plots that have there own story but dovetail, softly, into the main plot.These are the first five episodes. Some complain that it doesn't really end. If they decide to continue the series there are plenty of  places for the story/stories to go. If they don't continue the series that's okay too because life doesn't always tell a story that gets wrapped up in a neat little package.

He is a hunter and we begin to uncover some of his background. At first, there is a single dead woman.A detective (Gillian Anderson) is brought in to Belfast to assist the police in profiling the murder of the first young woman and makes the connection that she is dealing with a very clever serial killer. His victims are not sexually attacked and the killer leaves absolutely no traces behind that could possibly identify him. He collects trophies and keeps meticulous records of every crime and appears to derive sexual satisfaction from the act of strangulation.Both of these lead characters are hunters in their own fashion. The high ranking detective appears to be emotionally detached and is determined to hunt down and capture this killer. The killer is equally determined to remain anonymous. She is finally put in charge of a team named Operation Music Man charged with the task of apprehending this serial killer.The series is composed of five episodes and I cannot wait for series 2 of The Fall because the ending is not an ending but a tantalizing departure.The entire cast is brilliant and each character completely believable because of the superb acting.

1662016,A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B00DW5IKN4,Grieger,"[0, 0]","I will try my best not to spoil anything but if you're sensitive to spoilers, I suggest skipping my review cause the main caveat can't be described without spoiling things a little.We good? Okay, read on:The Fall is a five-episode arc following Gillian Anderson's character, Stella Gibson, as she lands herself in the middle of a hunt for a serial killer in Belfast, Northern Ireland. There are obvious echoes of Prime Suspect here though, personally, I feel like the Prime Suspect series is just well above this and many other crime series out of Britain.The story unfolds from both Stella Gibson's perspective and that of the killer. Gibson arrives in Belfast to follow up on a rather well publicised unsolved murder that remains unsolved weeks later. Gibson feels the murder is just one of a series but it takes another murder while she's in Belfast to convince people she's right. What ensues is a pair of parallel stories that begin to converge towards the end.Anderson's character is a self-assured and seasoned detective. She's not perfect and she might rub some people the wrong way, especially with her view on relationships and men, but I feel like that just makes her character a bit more unique. She's got some history with some of her colleagues in Belfast so drama does ensue. But, I think if I have any sort of criticism with her character, it's that there is little back story that's really filled in. There are details here and there about a past case, about how she's handled herself, and about how she thinks and derives her hunches, but they're sparse. You could argue that just leaves more material for subsequent series. My counter argument is that they could have just added some more in...it's not like this is an epic length mini-series.The serial killer, played by Jamie Dornan, a native of Belfast, lives a life precariously balanced between the routine of family life and a lackluster job and the drive to murder. We get to spend some time with him as he plans and executes his killings which I think is a mixed blessing. It can be disturbing essentially lying in wait with him as he finds the opportune time to pounce on his victims. But, at the same time, instead of some lurking shadow that's hidden by the writers' and director's guiding hand, we get to see him do his thing and even get into his head.One of the best things about this series, though, is the cast. Except for a couple of notable exceptions (including Gillian Anderson), most of the actors are actually natives of Belfast. A subplot illustrates just how much hasn't changed in Belfast and adds an interesting element, at least for me. It reminds me of the Jack Taylor series where except for the star, everyone else in the cast was a native of Galway. It doesn't always come across on the screen but I imagine it made it very easy for the actors to feel like Belfast was their home...because it was or is.Now, to the caveat I mentioned. While the production is solid and the story is very compelling the biggest flaw...the thing that I had to knock a star off for, though I wanted to knock more off but the quality of the series kept me from going that far, was the series ends largely unresolved. It reminds me of The Killing (the US version) and its first season. I'm sure you can figure out what's not resolved so I don't have to spell it out. Sure, it means there's a great reason to do a second series but it doesn't even seem like they were expecting to. They've announced the second series and that all them major players involved are signed on for it. I can't even imagine how they thought they'd end it the way they did and wouldn't even consider a second series a done deal.That's why, even though it's a great series (so far) and definitely worth watching, I'm reluctant to say it's hands down worth the pick-up. Sure, you're going to get some resolution with that second series (I hope) but I believe they're only going to start principal filming in February. Don't get me wrong. I love non-Hollywood endings to film and don't mind cliffhangers in TV series...as long as you know the resolution's coming next season. But, the way they ended this, we were digging around the DVD box thinking we were missing a disk.That said, if you're looking for a British crime drama, this is a great pick. Be forewarned that there won't be full closure at the end but with the second series starting early next year (2014), you'll be on track to get some satisfaction soon enough.",4,Great British (or Irish really) crime drama with a big caveat,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,4476,"['will', 'try', 'best', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'spoilers', 'suggest', 'skipping', 'review', 'cause', 'main', 'caveat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'described', 'spoiling', 'things', 'little.We', 'good', 'Okay', 'read', 'Fall', 'five-episode', 'arc', 'following', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'character', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'middle', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'Belfast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'are', 'obvious', 'echoes', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'here', 'personally', 'feel', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'series', 'just', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'crime', 'series', 'Britain.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'perspective', 'killer', 'Gibson', 'Belfast', 'follow', 'up', 'rather', 'well', 'publicised', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'unsolved', 'weeks', 'later', 'Gibson', 'murder', 'just', 'one', 'series', 'murder', 'Belfast', 'convince', 'people', 'right', 'What', 'pair', 'parallel', 'stories', 'begin', 'converge', 'end.Anderson', 'character', 'self-assured', 'seasoned', 'detective', 'not', 'perfect', 'might', 'rub', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'especially', 'view', 'relationships', 'men', 'feel', 'just', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'unique', 'got', 'history', 'colleagues', 'Belfast', 'so', 'drama', 'ensue', 'think', 'have', 'sort', 'criticism', 'character', 'little', 'back', 'story', 'really', 'filled', 'are', 'details', 'here', 'there', 'past', 'case', 'how', 'handled', 'how', 'hunches', ""'re"", 'sparse', 'could', 'argue', 'just', 'more', 'material', 'subsequent', 'series', 'counter', 'argument', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'added', 'more', 'not', 'epic', 'length', 'mini-series.The', 'serial', 'killer', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'native', 'Belfast', 'life', 'precariously', 'balanced', 'routine', 'family', 'life', 'lackluster', 'job', 'drive', 'murder', 'get', 'spend', 'time', 'killings', 'think', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'can', 'be', 'disturbing', 'essentially', 'lying', 'wait', 'opportune', 'time', 'pounce', 'victims', 'same', 'time', 'instead', 'lurking', 'shadow', 'hidden', 'writers', 'director', 'guiding', 'hand', 'get', 'see', 'do', 'thing', 'even', 'get', 'head.One', 'best', 'things', 'series', 'cast', 'couple', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'including', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'natives', 'Belfast', 'A', 'subplot', 'just', 'how', 'much', ""n't"", 'changed', 'Belfast', 'interesting', 'element', 'least', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'series', 'where', 'star', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'was', 'native', 'Galway', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'screen', 'imagine', 'made', 'very', 'easy', 'actors', 'feel', 'Belfast', 'was', 'home', 'was', 'is.Now', 'caveat', 'mentioned', 'production', 'solid', 'story', 'very', 'compelling', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'thing', 'had', 'knock', 'star', 'wanted', 'knock', 'more', 'off', 'quality', 'series', 'kept', 'going', 'far', 'was', 'series', 'largely', 'unresolved', 'Killing', 'US', 'version', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'not', 'resolved', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spell', 'out', 'Sure', 'great', 'reason', 'do', 'second', 'series', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'were', 'expecting', ""'ve"", 'announced', 'second', 'series', 'major', 'players', 'involved', 'are', 'signed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', 'how', 'thought', ""'d"", 'end', 'way', 'did', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'second', 'series', 'done', 'deal.That', 'why', 'even', 'great', 'series', 'far', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'reluctant', 'say', 'hands', 'down', 'pick-up', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'resolution', 'second', 'series', 'hope', 'believe', ""'re"", 'only', 'going', 'start', 'principal', 'filming', 'February', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'non-Hollywood', 'endings', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'cliffhangers', 'TV', 'series', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'resolution', 'coming', 'next', 'season', 'way', 'ended', 'were', 'digging', 'DVD', 'box', 'thinking', 'were', 'missing', 'disk.That', 'said', ""'re"", 'looking', 'British', 'crime', 'drama', 'great', 'pick', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'full', 'closure', 'end', 'second', 'series', 'starting', 'early', 'next', 'year', '2014', ""'ll"", 'be', 'track', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'soon', 'enough']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

It seemed like it took forever to get going and then it just stops in the middle and leaves you hanging for Series 2. When will that be released? Who knows but I will probably have lost interest in the series since it wasn't all gripping in the first place. The production values were fine and so was the acting. It just the story moved along to slow for my tastes. For this to be a drama there really wasn't anything so dramatic that made me to say, ""Oh my!"".Some of these BBC series can be a real miss, like this one. BBC series like Ripper Street are fantastic and, of course, wouldn't you know they canceled it after the second season. Typical. The Fall will probably drawn out for five or more seasons, knowing BBC. These executives who make these stupid decisions should be horsewhipped. Makes me wonder how they got these jobs in the first place. Anyway, I can't recommend The Fall unless you're hard up for a drama. At best, I say wait until Series 2 is released and buy them together.

1662019,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00DW5IKN4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","The Brits are so polite they insist on calling a serial killer a ""serial offender,"" as if the miscreant's most heinous crime is that he persistently takes lunch money. But don't let our brethren across the pond mislead you with their understated ways. Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson of the Metropolitan Police, for one, may be a cold fish but, damn, she's an enigmatic, fiercely independent, utterly capable investigative officer. Gillian Anderson's performance renders Gibson a fascinating, beguiling character.But we'd caught a glimpse of Gillian Anderson's powerful talent before in prestigious British projects such as Great Expectations and Bleak House. She's established her creds. The Fall's secret weapon is Jamie Dornan, him what plays her opposing lead. The Fall makes no bones of presenting the identity of its big bad from jump. It's Paul Spector (Dornan), him what's a considerate husband and a doting father, a grievance counselor by day, a brutal ""serial offender"" by night. Spector is a freak and a fetishist, and a compelling one. High marks to Dornan (and, I guess, the writers) for attributing a dichotomous complexity to his character.Det. Superintendent Gibson is dispatched to Belfast to review a stalled investigation of a murdered woman. Only, in surveying the case, Gibson comes to suspect a cunning and meticulous serial killer, excuse me, serial offender may be at work. It's not too long before another young professional woman surfaces, brutalized and strangled and artistically posed.The Fall runs five episodes, is a slow burn police procedural, is a disturbing psychological thriller. You've got to have patience with the show. The pace is leisurely. Time is taken to develop the moody atmosphere and the character beats. We observe the maniac and the detective as they go about their respective hunts; the camera alternates between their two arcs. It examines the human appepites, the appetite for predation and ultimate control and sexual conquest (and are you even sure I'm talking about Spector?). I love that we're all invited to crawl into the minds of an unexpected sociopath and an unconventional woman grappling with her own inner demons and urges. Comparisons have been drawn between Gibson and Prime Suspect's icy, calculating Jane Tennison, and Anderson in an interview has admitted that the parallels were intentional. As with Tennison, Gibson is fiercely her own woman, a tough, ambitious professional who doesn't sacrifice a smidge of her femininity. Don't tell her to lay off her ""sweet nights.""The Fall isn't a whodunit as much as it is a whatdunit or whydunit or whenwilltheycrosspathsdunit. Me, I couldn't wait for Gibson and Spector to interact. Know that the tease goes on until the final, fifth episode. That their showdown was going to be good was never in doubt. It in fact makes me wish they'd engaged so much sooner. Know, too, that the ending doesn't go down that beaten path. I thought it a nice swerve. You may not.Belfast, with its local color and social demarcations and its hard men and pockets of sectarianism, helps to glue the narrative down. The city of Belfast is shot so vividly, it becomes a secondary character in its own right. Water cooler talk is that The Fall has been renewed for a second series, but I wonder if they'll pick up on those several dangling threads. I wonder if we'll see these same minor characters that flesh out the story so well. Particularly, I hope to see more of Archie Panjabi's magnetic pathologist, Niamh McGrady's sensible Ferrington, and John Lynch's conflicted Jim Burns. As well, I long for more of the marvelous Bronagh Waugh, but she plays the killer's wife, so I dunno...Anyway, The Fall deserves a seat at the table with other superb, character-driven crime dramas like Prime Suspect and Luther. I'm very much looking forward to The Fall, Series 2. I hope Gillian Anderson can juggle this show and her supporting roles in Hannibal and the upcoming NBC hostage drama, Crisis. That's a lot of back and forthing across the pond.Five episodes on two discs.

1662020,A25E01HTNT53KL,B00DW5IKN4,James M. Rawley,"[6, 7]","Last things first: this nicely watchable five-episode show has at least three main plot threads, and more than ten minor ones, and not a single, solitary one of them is tied up. That's annoying. Some people say it's like real life, and therefore they don't mind. More power to them. I'm always glad when people are happy. But I myself think of a crime drama, especially a serial killer crime drama, as artificial, as artificial as a limerick, and to me this five-hour show was like a limerick without its last two lines.Spoilers follow, fans, but since the show won't even begin to be over till the second season ends, sometime in May 2014 from what I hear, at worst I'm spoiling only the first half of the drama.1. In the last episode, the serial killer phones the investigating cop and tells her he'll quit and she'll never catch him. We're not supposed to believe him, but that's more of an ending than the other plot threads get.2. The heroine's boss is protecting a whole gang of lowlifes, because though he's a high-level police official he's under the thumb of some politician, whose son is in the gang. Not one character from this lowlife gang is caught, except for a police officer who got involved with it. Very few of them are even brought in and charged. Yet they occupied more than an hour of screen-time. How are they relevant to the serial-killer theme? That isn't discussed either.3. The serial killer is an ordinary family man -- and a hard-driving versatile one at that. He does such good work at his job that his co-workers resent and undermine him, and the fact that he's a serial killer in no way impairs his ability to tell his bosses off when they pull petty regulation reprimands on him. But what will happen to his family if he's caught? How will his wife react? How will his daughter, already apparently emotionally damaged and unconsciously suspicious of her own father, get over seeing what he is? Answer: the family just barely begins to show some of the stress and wham! the season is over.I couldn't begin to cover all the smaller problems that are left stranded. A policeman is shot seven times in the back and three times in the head. We never find out who killed him, let alone see that person brought to justice. The serial killer gets off on torturing thirty-something career women, but that doesn't stop him from getting highly involved with a sexually precocious fifteen-year-old babysitter. What happens to her from all this? Again, we don't find out.You can't help envying that serial killer, though. His wife wants him; his babysitter wants him; he has such strong effect on a grieving couple he's counseling that the husband threatens to kill him and the wife obeys his every command. He's incredibly strong from constant exercising, including jogging and chin-ups. And his serial killing hobby shows he's not only a good researcher and stalker, but also gifted at sketching and novel-writing (he produces accounts of his crimes illustrated by photographs and drawings). He's billed as ""an ordinary guy,"" but he's obviously the Leonardo da Vinci of serial killers. Did I mention that he quotes Nietzsche? But maybe you already guessed that.Meanwhile top cop Gillian Anderson comes up with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; about serial killers, things like, ""It's the power that he likes!"" She utters these clich&eacute;s as if she is slowly, laboriously working them out right there in front of us, though she could hardly have reached her present high rank in the police if she hadn't known them for years. She's even more impressive than the serial killer. She can pick up any man she wants in a second, but it turns out that after a man has had one sweet night with her, he's obsessed with her forever. She doesn't know that (she just knows it's easy for her to pick up men), so she's utterly ruthless. One of her ex-lovers says to her, ""I would have left my wife for you. My children."" She stares at him blankly.Oh, and why then didn't the guy leave his wife and children for her? Not explained. Perhaps she was so uninterested in him even a ruined sex-slave could see it. Perhaps he would have had to give up his golf games too, and that was too much for him. Just one more dropped plot thread.The show is a lot of fun to watch, though deliberately slow-paced. It helps to think of it as the first five hours of a ten-hour drama but who knows? Maybe the sequel won't end anything either. Maybe it's always going to be just like life, and you can stop watching it and look out the window instead.",4,Left me happy but cool,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,4543,"['Last', 'things', 'first', 'nicely', 'watchable', 'five-episode', 'show', 'least', 'three', 'main', 'plot', 'threads', 'more', 'ten', 'minor', 'ones', 'not', 'single', 'solitary', 'one', 'tied', 'up', 'annoying', 'people', 'say', 'real', 'life', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'More', 'power', ""'m"", 'always', 'glad', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'happy', 'think', 'crime', 'drama', 'especially', 'serial', 'killer', 'crime', 'drama', 'artificial', 'as', 'artificial', 'limerick', 'five-hour', 'show', 'was', 'limerick', 'last', 'two', 'lines.Spoilers', 'follow', 'fans', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'be', 'till', 'second', 'season', 'ends', 'sometime', 'May', '2014', 'what', 'hear', 'worst', ""'m"", 'spoiling', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'drama.1', 'last', 'episode', 'serial', 'killer', 'investigating', 'cop', ""'ll"", 'quit', ""'ll"", 'never', 'catch', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'believe', 'more', 'ending', 'other', 'plot', 'threads', 'get.2', 'heroine', 'boss', 'protecting', 'whole', 'gang', 'lowlifes', 'high-level', 'police', 'official', 'thumb', 'politician', 'son', 'gang', 'Not', 'one', 'character', 'lowlife', 'gang', 'caught', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'Very', 'few', 'are', 'even', 'brought', 'charged', 'occupied', 'more', 'hour', 'screen-time', 'How', 'are', 'relevant', 'serial-killer', 'theme', ""n't"", 'discussed', 'either.3', 'serial', 'killer', 'ordinary', 'family', 'man', 'hard-driving', 'versatile', 'one', 'such', 'good', 'work', 'job', 'co-workers', 'resent', 'undermine', 'fact', 'serial', 'killer', 'way', 'ability', 'tell', 'bosses', 'off', 'when', 'pull', 'petty', 'regulation', 'reprimands', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'family', 'caught', 'How', 'will', 'wife', 'react', 'How', 'will', 'daughter', 'already', 'apparently', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'unconsciously', 'suspicious', 'own', 'father', 'get', 'seeing', 'what', 'Answer', 'family', 'just', 'barely', 'show', 'stress', 'wham', 'season', 'over.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'cover', 'smaller', 'problems', 'are', 'left', 'stranded', 'policeman', 'shot', 'seven', 'times', 'back', 'three', 'times', 'head', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'let', 'alone', 'see', 'person', 'brought', 'justice', 'serial', 'killer', 'off', 'torturing', 'thirty-something', 'career', 'women', ""n't"", 'stop', 'getting', 'highly', 'involved', 'sexually', 'precocious', 'fifteen-year-old', 'babysitter', 'What', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'envying', 'serial', 'killer', 'though', 'wife', 'babysitter', 'such', 'strong', 'effect', 'grieving', 'couple', 'counseling', 'husband', 'kill', 'wife', 'obeys', 'command', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'constant', 'exercising', 'including', 'jogging', 'chin-ups', 'serial', 'killing', 'hobby', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'researcher', 'stalker', 'also', 'gifted', 'sketching', 'novel-writing', 'accounts', 'crimes', 'illustrated', 'photographs', 'drawings', 'billed', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'obviously', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'serial', 'killers', 'Did', 'mention', 'Nietzsche', 'maybe', 'already', 'guessed', 'that.Meanwhile', 'top', 'cop', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'up', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'serial', 'killers', 'things', 'power', 'clich', 'eacute', 'slowly', 'laboriously', 'working', 'out', 'right', 'there', 'front', 'could', 'hardly', 'have', 'reached', 'present', 'high', 'rank', 'police', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'years', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'serial', 'killer', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'man', 'second', 'out', 'man', 'had', 'one', 'sweet', 'night', 'obsessed', 'forever', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'men', 'utterly', 'ruthless', 'One', 'ex-lovers', 'her', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'wife', 'children', 'blankly.Oh', 'why', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'guy', 'leave', 'wife', 'children', 'Not', 'explained', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'so', 'uninterested', 'even', 'ruined', 'sex-slave', 'could', 'see', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'golf', 'games', 'too', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'dropped', 'plot', 'thread.The', 'show', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'deliberately', 'slow-paced', 'think', 'first', 'five', 'hours', 'ten-hour', 'drama', 'who', 'Maybe', 'sequel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'anything', 'Maybe', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'like', 'life', 'can', 'stop', 'watching', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'instead']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

Gillian Anderson of ""X-Files"" fame portrays a British detective, Stella Gibson, who arrives in Belfast, Ireland, to review several cases involving the murders of two young women who could've passed as sisters.  Soon, another murder occurs and it becomes evident that they are all the victims of the same psychosexual predator.  The series focuses on Gibson's numerous attempts to capture the killer, Paul Spector, portrayed by Jamie Dornan.  It chronicles both their lives.  Spector, who works as a bereavement counselor, is the ultimate of hypocrites.  He creates more bereavement than he alleviates; he tears families apart rather than uniting them.Gillian Anderson's performance is good, but not great.  Given her ""X-Files"" background as a medical doctor, she adeptly portrays the professional female detective--a detective who abuses her power.  However, her British accent gives her a haughty, superior quality that I found rather annoying.  Also, her character's moral values are not what I would associate with a respectable, likeable heroine.  She cold-heartedly seduces a male subordinate and justifies it by claiming that men do it all the time; therefore, it must be fine.  I don't expect my heroines to be virgins but I expect them to exhibit moral decency.  Anderson is a superb detective; however, I can't respect her as a person.""The Fall"" is filled with much tension.  The body count climbs as it progresses.  The medical and police procedures are very interesting.  The depiction of the serial killer's family and how he tries to prevent them from discovering his identity are fascinating.  The police grow ever closer to learning his identity but this wily, intelligent, deceitful man always manages to slime his way out of everyone's grasp.  He is a sick, perverted killer who grows more devious and destructive.  He is a ticking time bomb that will soon explode if Gibson doesn't permanently defuse him.  She seems to be the only one clever and intelligent enough to do it.If you, like me, enjoy mysteries that are set in foreign countries, then you will definitely enjoy ""The Fall, Series 1.""  Thankfully, it is presented with a widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and has SDH subtitles.  It doesn't matter whether or not you are hard of hearing.  The Irish accents can be difficult to understand.  You will probably want to watch it with the subtitles on.  Another television mystery series that I recommend from Acorn is ""Jack Taylor: Set 1"" (Jack Taylor: Set 1).  Set in Ireland, it centers on an alcoholic detective who solves grisly murders involving serial killers.  Each of its three ninety-minute episodes is based on a novel written by best-selling author Ken Bruen.Joseph B.

1662025,A1O97WKID9L3IA,B00DW5IKN4,"Jeff Wignall ""Photographer, Author and Radio ...","[0, 0]","OK, just so I can get this out of the way at the top, I had no idea who Gillian Anderson was before this series (though she looks familiar, but what actress doesn't?) but this woman has the most intense beautiful blue eyes with very sharp black pupils. I found myself missing dialog because I was focusing on her eyes, lol. There, I got it out of the way.I've been watching a lot of Brit & Irish-based mystery series lately and this is probably the best of the lot. Yes, the premise is a bit contrived--a superintendent is brought in to help solve a murder and she decides that it's the work of a serial killer, blah, blah, blah. It's kind of obvious to the viewer that this is the work of a serial killer since you actually witness a lot of the crimes happening. That's a kind of odd twist in itself that you might think would dilute the tensions, but actually it has the strange effect of increasing the drama because you can see the paths of characters interchanging and getting closer to one another, but the other characters don't know this is happening. You almost want to shout things to the screen once in a while because you already know what is going on. It's fun.Also, there is the traditional and predictable tension between Anderson's character and both her superiors and subordinates, all of this is somewhat trite and trodden ground, yes. And also the first episode drags quite a bit, much more so than the remaining episodes, by the way. But if you suspend annoyance (at the contrived aspects) and if you put up with the slow start, the series is quite engrossing--and I really mean that. You do come to like (most of) Anderson's character, you (predictably) dislike her superiors (and feel pity for their ignorance) and you are wondering what the evil protagonist will do next (and if he isn't some type of red herring....ahhh, the mystery of that). There are some things I despise about some of the writing (Anderson's character has a bit of a mildly slutty side to her) and, being a writer myself, I wish I could have doctored the scripts a bit, but so be it. I was entertained, the mystery is maintained, the Belfast setting is great (but if it's Belfast, why didn't they get Van Morrison to write a soundtrack? A gross oversight, I think) and there are those laser blue eyes.The crimes in this series are, by the way, vile and graphic, but that's fine with me, it's all pretend isn't it. There are also a lot of fine naked bodies--tragically, most of them are dead.A good mystery series for a winter weekend (which is when I enjoyed it) but please, let's get the next season ready--there are some unresolved issues.By the way, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, which is the purpose of having pubic reviews, but I'm kind of at a loss when I see the one-star reviews for this. Even it it's not my favorite mystery series, it's still very well done.

And she seems to pull off the accent because she spent years there as a child, and she seemingly doesn't try too hard. She succeeds where most American actresses fail.

This is a subtle but taught narrative about a string of Belfast murders the police just can't solve They call Scotland Yard in for help which arrives in the form of a Chief Inspector ,played brilliantly by Anderson, who character is an expert in serial killings.Then there is the criminal played convincingly by British actor Jami Dornan, who many will remember is playing the male lead in Fifty Shades of Grey. He is pernicious as a brutal rapist and killer who is also a baby faced, loving father and husband. You hate him and are seduced by his good looks at the same time.

1662030,AEJAGHLC675A7,B00DW5IKN4,John Williamson,"[1, 1]","Ever since seeing Gillian Anderson's performances as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully in the ""The X-Files"" TV series that spanned nine seasons (1993 to 2002), like so many others I was hooked... and I'm not one to go out of my way to watch that many sci-fi or horror series.The Fall, Series 1, is a highly absorbing and gritty five-hour story that follows a serial killer acting in an uninhibited fashion in Belfast, Ireland. He's a man who stalks and murders attractive young women while maintaining the pretense of a stable family man, and one who hides behind the facade of working as a grief counselor. Gillian Anderson delivers a truly subtle performance as London-based Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson, the tenacious investigator who is brought in to track down the killer.The Fall sets up an alarming, grimy and persuasively realistic scenario right from the unusual opening scenes of the first episode. After two young professional women are found assaulted and murdered in their apartments, with their bodies left in carefully posed, the Belfast police call upon Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson to offer her proficiency and find out if the murders are in some way connected. Her supervisor, Police Captain Jim Burns (John Lynch), thinks that the most recent killing may have been related to the victim's former fianc&eacute;e. After a brief examination of the facts, Stella Gibson feels that both murders were done by the same person, and that the entire department needs to act speedily to prevent yet another murderous catastrophe from occurring.While all this is going on, we see the upstanding family man Paul Spector (well played by Jamie Dornan) going out on nightly runs during which he clandestinely observes a young woman named Sarah Kay (Laura Donnelly). Breaking into her apartment while she's out, Spector rearranges things, leaving her subtle notes that she's being shadowed. The understandably distraught Kay calls the police for their protection, but they're limited in what they can do. When the third obvious victim of this killing spree turns up, Detective Gibson increases the department's investigation, despite resistance from both her superiors and the police-adverse Irish people that she questions. In the meantime, Spector continues to hide his deviant practices from his nurse wife, Olivia (Sarah Beattie) and his two young children.The Fall initially seems to be an intense if slow (and somewhat mechanical) thriller. It opens up in unpredictably fascinating ways, especially when it comes to Stella Gibson and how she relates with those around her. She is initially seen as a no-nonsense, somewhat emotionless type whose British reserve alienates the police personnel she has been assigned to deal with. In the second episode, though, she spontaneously propositions one of the detectives to meet with her in her hotel room, where they share a passionate moment of intimacy. It's revealed in time that there was a similar occurrence with another professional colleague in her past.This sensual side of Stella Gibson also displays itself during interactions with other females, like Police Constable Danielle Ferrington (well played by Niamh McGrady), a tough officer who reveals another side to her life during a moment of downtime. To have a main character display her quirky amatory side may seem strange at first, but the tactic serves as a way for Gibson to understand the motivations of the killer and track his movements before they happen. The Gibson vs. Spector dynamic is the most fascinating aspect of The Fall, but the series does an excellent job of showing a realistic world with a number of scenes that don't directly relate to the primary characters, but nevertheless paint a gritty yet enjoyable image as a backdrop.The video quality of this DVD is good. Filmed digitally with a purposely dark and grainy look, the 1.77:1 (more commonly known as 16:9), widescreen image ends up looking good on disc. The image is well-modulated, and the darks never seem too murky. The audio is a straightforward Dolby Digital stereo mix, leaving the viewer with comprehensible dialogue and sound effects.As far as performances go, Gillian Anderson is even better than she was inThe X-Files Season 1,The X-Files Season 2, or any other season for that matter, and this series is a good showcase for the range of her talents. It's another facet to her amazing capabilities, and far better than her performance as a middle aged businesswoman inClosure(2007).Irish actor Jamie Dornan (Sheriff Graham Humbert inOnce Upon A Time) played Paul Spector quite convincingly, and it's no wonder that he will have the male lead in the upcoming film adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" The Fall series was created by Allan Cubitt and expertly directed by Jakob Verbruggen; the casting and the settings are quite authentic.Don't shoot the messenger, but for those who like their series to end a season summing everything up in a nice, tidy package, with all the questions answered, this one may not be for you.  Throughout the series we saw Detective Superintendent Gibson's tough determination to prove herself as the dominant female in a male-dominated world; be that through her icy behavior in the workplace or her approach to office romance. Hers is a character that needs to have control over men, so it's not even thinkable that she can let a serial killer like Spector, who preys on women's insecurities, continue on his twisted path. To come so close, only for the murderer to have evaded her capture only makes her tenacity stronger.""It won't be over until I stop you.""The Fallexemplifies an excellent British television series. With inspiring psychological drama, it is quite suspenseful, tough, darkly realistic and thoughtfully produced. This series will continue into its next season, and it's only a matter of time until Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson finally gets her man. This one is highly recommended.JW &#9642; 1/7/2014",5,"The Fall, Series 1: ""It won't be over until I stop you""",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,5980,"['Ever', 'seeing', 'Gillian', 'Anderson',

1662031,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00DW5IKN4,Jon Wynne,"[1, 1]","As one of maybe three people on the planet who has never seen an episode of The X-Files, I have rarely had the opportunity to see and enjoy Gillian Anderson&#8217;s work. Not long ago, while taking the tube in London, I saw a poster for a play Ms Anderson was doing in the West End. Given her background in theatre, this was impressive. Recently I saw her outstanding performance in The Crimson Petal & The White, and was very impressed by her performance as the madame of a brothel. Made up like an old crone, she was the opposite of Hollywood glamour.Shame on me for not knowing much about one of the great actresses of our time.The only other actress imaginable as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson, seconded from the Metropolitan Police to review a murder investigation in Belfast, Ireland, is Helen Mirren. That says a lot. Anderson is amazing in the role and the way she gradually reveals that her DS Gibson is almost as cold as the murderer she is trying to capture, is breathtaking.I&#8217;m not quite sure why the series is called THE FALL. I thought it might have something to do with the Fall from Grace, with all the inherent spirituality the subject suggests. After five episodes I still couldn&#8217;t decide why, though it hardly matters. THE FALL is an amazing achievement.The rest of the cast is perfect. Particularly ultra-handsome Jamie Dornan, who is magnificent as the serial killer, Paul Spector. In fact, there really isn&#8217;t a false note among the huge cast list. One of the comments made in the behind the scenes featurette reinforces this, remarking that a lot of well-established Irish actors were champing at the bit to be involved in this A-level production.It&#8217;s apparent by the writing, direction, acting and the cumulative impact of the entire production why the show was such a hit. A six-part second series has been commissioned, to begin filming in January, 2014. Since all of the major cast has signed to appear, this suggests that the story in series 1 isn&#8217;t over yet, a very tantalizing thought. Having said that, the recent announcement out of Hollywood that Jamie Dornan, the sex-obsessed killer in THE FALL, has been signed to star in the big screen adaptation of 50 SHADES OF GREY, may throw that idea into jeopardy. We shall have to wait and see. The hotly-anticipated 50 SHADES is a natural fit for Dornan, with its erotic blend of sex and obsession. If THE FALL was Dornan&#8217;s audition for the part of Christian Grey it couldn&#8217;t have been more convincing!There&#8217;s a lot of abuse of women on hand, but the battle of the sexes is given a fresh take the way the series develops. Anderson&#8217;s character is pretty ruthless herself and is not above taking advantage of her position in life to get what she wants. The difference between her and murderer Spector is that she lives her life within the law, though sometimes outside the circle of conventional morality. By the way, it is not a spoiler to say Dornan plays the killer as we learn that almost immediately. This is not a &#8220;who done it?&#8221; or even a &#8220;How done it?&#8221; It is more of a &#8220;Why done it and is he going to get away with it?&#8221; There are some genuine surprises and chills within that approach.There&#8217;s a lot of bad language which, once again, arguably isn&#8217;t necessary. This and some pretty rough sexual assault scenes are mentioned for those whose tastes may incline to a less graphic presentation.THE FALL is wonderful television: fresh, intriguing and as good as anything out there. Approximately half of that success is directly attributable to the brilliant Gillian Anderson, with Jamie Dornan not far behind.",5,Brilliant but disturbing.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3697,"['one', 'maybe', 'three', 'people', 'planet', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'X-Files', 'have', 'rarely', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'enjoy', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', '8217', 's', 'work', 'Not', 'long', 'ago', 'taking', 'tube', 'London', 'saw', 'poster', 'play', 'Ms', 'Anderson', 'was', 'doing', 'West', 'End', 'Given', 'background', 'theatre', 'was', 'impressive', 'Recently', 'saw', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Crimson', 'Petal', 'White', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'performance', 'madame', 'brothel', 'Made', 'up', 'old', 'crone', 'was', 'opposite', 'Hollywood', 'glamour.Shame', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'one', 'great', 'actresses', 'time.The', 'only', 'other', 'actress', 'imaginable', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'seconded', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'review', 'murder', 'investigation', 'Belfast', 'Ireland', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'lot', 'Anderson', 'amazing', 'role', 'way', 'gradually', 'DS', 'Gibson', 'almost', 'as', 'cold', 'murderer', 'trying', 'capture', 'breathtaking.I', '8217', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'series', 'called', 'THE', 'FALL', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Fall', 'Grace', 'inherent', 'spirituality', 'subject', 'suggests', 'five', 'episodes', 'still', 'couldn', '8217', 'decide', 'why', 'hardly', 'matters', 'FALL', 'amazing', 'achievement.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Particularly', 'ultra-handsome', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'who', 'magnificent', 'serial', 'killer', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'fact', 'really', 'isn', '8217', 'false', 'note', 'huge', 'cast', 'list', 'One', 'comments', 'made', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'remarking', 'lot', 'well-established', 'Irish', 'actors', 'were', 'champing', 'bit', 'be', 'involved', 'A-level', 'production.It', '8217', 'apparent', 'writing', 'direction', 'acting', 'cumulative', 'impact', 'entire', 'production', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'such', 'hit', 'six-part', 'second', 'series', 'been', 'commissioned', 'begin', 'filming', 'January', '2014', 'major', 'cast', 'signed', 'appear', 'story', 'series', '1', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'yet', 'very', 'tantalizing', 'thought', 'Having', 'said', 'recent', 'announcement', 'Hollywood', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'sex-obsessed', 'killer', 'THE', 'FALL', 'been', 'signed', 'star', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', '50', 'SHADES', 'OF', 'GREY', 'may', 'throw', 'idea', 'jeopardy', 'shall', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'hotly-anticipated', '50', 'SHADES', 'natural', 'fit', 'Dornan', 'erotic', 'blend', 'sex', 'obsession', 'FALL', 'was', 'Dornan', '8217', 'audition', 'part', 'Christian', 'Grey', 'couldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing', '8217', 's', 'lot', 'abuse', 'women', 'hand', 'battle', 'sexes', 'given', 'fresh', 'take', 'way', 'series', 'Anderson', '8217', 's', 'character', 'pretty', 'ruthless', 'herself', 'not', 'taking', 'advantage', 'position', 'life', 'get', 'what', 'difference', 'murderer', 'Spector', 'life', 'law', 'sometimes', 'circle', 'conventional', 'morality', 'way', 'not', 'spoiler', 'say', 'Dornan', 'killer', 'learn', 'almost', 'immediately', 'not', '8220', 'who', 'done', '8221', 'even', '8220', 'How', 'done', '8221', 'more', '8220', 'Why', 'done', 'going', 'get', 'away', '8221', 'are', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'chills', '8217', 's', 'lot', 'bad', 'language', 'once', 'again', 'arguably', 'isn', '8217', 'necessary', 'pretty', 'rough', 'sexual', 'assault', 'scenes', 'are', 'mentioned', 'tastes', 'may', 'incline', 'less', 'graphic', 'presentation.THE', 'FALL', 'wonderful', 'television', 'fresh', 'intriguing', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'there', 'Approximately', 'half', 'success', 'directly', 'attributable', 'brilliant', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'not', 'far']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

Gillian Anderson plays the lead investigator of a series of murders with a strange detachment that is both compelling and a little bit frustrating.  However, she does it so well that it's easy to forgive the her for the character's shortcomings.  As dispassionate as Anderson's portrayal is at times, Jamie Dornan's acting is equally compelling and more than passionate enough to draw you into the story.  He plays the serial killer's multiple sides with an apparent ease that needs to be seen to be believed.  If he wasn't on your radar as a great actor, this performance may change your mind.The question is whether or not the police in Belfast can catch up with a killer who is nothing if not thorough and leaves little to be found.  The Fall is one of those programs that does not really give up once you're hooked.  Every move seems carefully calculated.  The twists keep on coming throughout and are very difficult to telegraph.  Great acting, an intriguing premise, and a cast of characters that balance each other better than real life make this a must watch program.  Feels incomplete, though, and some casting choices and characters vastly underdeveloped or disposed of too soon with no apparent reason.  Be warned, too, this is not for the faint of heart.  The Fall really needs a second series to put to rest any linger questions, of which there are unfortunately many, and that leaves this just short of being a complete and rounded series.

It's well-written, dark and twisted in a deeply disturbing way.  We, as the audience, know what's going on from the first episode -- a serial killer is terrorizing Belfast by targeting young, professional women.  He tortures them, washes them, and poses them in a creepy game of cat and mouse with the police.  And he's escalating.  The Detective Superintendent in charge of the case is Stella Gibson, played by the incredible Gillian Anderson. Stella Gibson is smart, hard-driven, and lets off steam by having safe sex without connection with a fellow officer.  It's not that Gibson is aloof -- she just lives her life as she wishes to live it. Kinda like a man.  When the officer she hooked up with is shot outside his house, well, things can only get worse.The serial killer is so creepy, he's a man with a family -- and a wife that works all day and all night as a pediatric nurse. He *knows* his victims. He stalks them and learns their ways. He could be the guy next door, and, well, he *is.*  And he's more than a match for Stella Gibson. Their game of sociopathic cat and mouse is disturbing and weirdly beguiling.  It draws you in. This is definitely a crime series for grown-ups.The Fall belongs in an elite group with the original Danish version of The Killing, The US version of The Killing, and the French series The Returned.

1662038,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B00DW5IKN4,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","The first episode opening shots in the BBC&#8217;s The Fall show Gillian Anderson as DS Stella Gibson wearing flannel pyjamas and a clay beauty mask, scrubbing the bathtub with no bra on. Casting an actress famed for physical beauty and poise, then immediately stealing both, presages what this series offers. It&#8217;s a dark-hued, unromantic explosion of police efficiency and criminal precision, making us question who&#8217;s the real villain here.When a murder goes unsolved one month on, Belfast police contract London Metropolitan legend Stella Gibson to audit their system. She quickly notices the connections between this and another unsolved murder, but Belfast refuses to acknowledge a serial killer. That is, until dispassionate, meticulous Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) takes his third victim, and begins stalking his fourth. Suddenly, police must dodge blame while tracking a killer who knows their strategies.Anyone watching this series expecting Anderson to reprise her classic X-Files role will feel acutely disappointed. DS Gibson lacks either Dana Scully&#8217;s early reasoned efficiency or later credulous zeal. Gibson is professionally ruthless, intellectually aggressive, sexually voracious, and masks an vengeful core beneath protocol and dispassion. If you were a crime victim, you&#8217;d want her on your investigation, but you&#8217;d never buy her a drink.In a parallel narrative, serial killer Spector leads a dual life. By day, he has a beautiful young family, exercises obsessively, and counsels bereaved parents. By night, he stalks dark-haired thirtysomething professionals. He has perfected the art of scaring his victims in ways police can&#8217;t prosecute. And he&#8217;s meticulous in keeping an impenetrable wall between his bucolic middle-class life and his midnight murders. Spector and Gibson never meet.Gibson and Spector&#8217;s mutual hunt unfolds against Belfast&#8217;s brick-paved backdrop, where lingering sectarian divides mean standing on the wrong street could get you killed. Police must weigh every action, not just via the law, but against political ramifications that could start riots. Though The Troubles are long over, factional divides survive, and two arrests on the same street can resemble political oppression, as Gibson learns only too late.Audiences unaccustomed to British TV conventions might find this series&#8217; pacing offbeat. The languid narrative tempo more resembles French horror films than American cop dramas. Events unfold with Andrei Tarkovsky-like lack of haste, punctuated with sudden stabs of action so abrupt, they touch deep, primal, pre-evolutionary fears. But this better emphasizes the show&#8217;s innately horrifying themes, for viewers who can adjust themselves to its idiosyncratic rhythms.Director Jakob Verbruggen cherry-picks his favorite components from thriller formulae, crafting an arc that sometimes obeys audience expectation, sometimes subverts it. From sooty streets to CSI nerd-talk to police infighting, many scenes will appear downright comfortable. But nobody saves the puppy in Act III. Every time we attempt to predict the story&#8217;s twists, Verbruggen submarines us, rekindling the sense of dislocation that first attracted many audiences to classic crime thrillers.While Spector&#8217;s crime spree permeates this five-episode series&#8217; core, subplots develop as police involved with the investigation, or involved with Gibson, prove darkly corrupt. Gibson has an incautious liaison with a Belfast detective who gets assassinated less than twenty-four hours later; and as Detective Olson&#8217;s sordid side business becomes visible, Gibson finds herself tainted. The two plots form a self-feeding cycle of crime and sleaze.The camera loves both Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Though Anderson&#8217;s beauty is already renowned, Verbruggen never squanders an opportunity to showcase her with blouse open, or in a swimsuit, or charmingly unkempt. Dornan, a former Armani model, is less famous, but about the third time he does shirtless chin-ups, you&#8217;ll understand his casting as Christian Grey. Fair warning: despite minimal violence, this series&#8217; frank sexuality may curl parents&#8217; hair.Even Belfast itself plays a remarkable character in this story. The contrast between the slick, glass-and-steel city centre, and the cobblestone residential streets, is frequently jarring. Gibson&#8217;s hotel has no trace of anything antique or genuinely Irish, while Spector has the kind of Victorian rowhouse that Americans consider quintessentially British. But Gibson and Spector&#8217;s pursuits take them into crumbling Shankhill and Falls Road areas where poverty has a manifest odor.Dramas like this seldom play well on American TV. The closest I can recall is Steven Bochco&#8217;s Murder One, which never found its audience in the mid-1990s. This more resembles a novel than a bog-standard cop drama.

Game on.Aficionados of CBS TV may already think they've seen this a hundred times before. They have, but not like this. With clever direction and editing, a brilliant cast (in addition to the two stars I especially liked Ms. Archie Panjabi as the medical examiner and John Burns as the head honcho of the Belfast police), the show tries to paint a realistic portrayal of crime-solving, and it requires close attention on the part of the viewer lest clues be missed.But Anderson's Gibson is the real revelation. Now 45 she plays a woman virtually without empathy, and she's probably as much of a sociopath as the killer she's seeking. She's cold, haughty, impatient, and somewhat of a feminist--but a feminist who knows that its best to worship ""the god of  things as they are."" Scully has grown up, and magnificently so.Notes and asides: Series 1 ends without resolution. There will be a series 2. There are no miraculous computer face recognition tricks.

Early on Stella believes it may be the work of a serial murderer and is soon proven right.Simultaneously, we meet the villain, who lives a double life and seems an unlikely candidate to perpetrate these murders.  So, it's a bit cat and mouse as Stella begins to identify just what kind of individual is doing these crimes and why, drawing nearer to the killer.The acting is subdued and deep.  There's a menacing atmosphere pervading.  For my own taste, I prefer less violent and graphic crimes.  However, the series was so well-done and the acting riveting by Gillian Anderson as Stella that I couldn't not watch.  The plot and denouement is original and I will sample the next installment in the series.  5 stars if you are okay with the violence and some nudity.

1662044,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B00DW5IKN4,Lola's Mom,"[0, 1]","Where to start? First of all, I see some similarities in this heroine and Prime Suspect's. Both are kick-rear women who see what they want and obtain it, being men or serial killers.Both are leading detectives or in this case, DCIs, and like PS, we don't get to know the heroine all that well. This leads me to an issue I had with this series. The heroine has no personality at all. What makes her mad? What makes her sad? What drives her? We literally learn nothing about this woman at all in five hours. Which is sad, as I'm a fan of Gillian Anderson and I must say, this is such a drastic change from her character in X-Files...she's def a good actress. If she was told to play a bad-butt woman with no personality, she aced it.In a nutshell: Gillian plays a lady DCI trying to track down a serial strangler of women. He targets brunettes, successful women, single. He poses them, takes mementos, shows no remorse for his acts...except in one instance. And this is not a whodunit. You know whodunit from the get-go. It's a family guy, a man with a daughter!! It's disturbing and it makes one think of how just about anybody can be a sociopath and we don't know it. He's even a psychiatrist, albeit I don't think a very good one.The heroine...again, all I can say about her is she's tough, which is a good thing though I still wish I'd learned more about her personally. She surprised me. She told a reporter to...blank off. LOL. She approached a random cop she thought was good looking and just rattled off her room number and hotel name for  a ""sweet"" night. Ballsy.But that brings to another complaint. Why is it TV portrays every single strong or tough woman as promiscuous?Though I must applaud her for her comment about how when a man blanks woman, man subject, blanks verb, woman object, that's ok, but when it's woman subject, man object, it's not ok. That was a total WOW moment for me and probably my favorite my part.Anyway, in five hours, we see 3 women murdered and one put in a coma. We get to know the killer, his double life, his family, his children. I know more about the killer than the detective herself. We see little slip-ups and clues...I was on the edge of my seat...but then...the season ended...with..no conclusion. She's on to him and yet he's driving away...and that's it. UGH. I was hoping when I agreed to review this that this particular case would be resolved and a new season would bring in a new case...I guess I should stick to Law & Order, eh? Every case resolved in one hour.Hum.Anyway, I liked it, but hated the lack of personality, didn't care for the inconclusion, and question why confidence in a woman must always mean having sex with men she doesn't know.OH--and I loved the motorcycle-riding pathologist lady.

She, herself, is written as cold, and we don't see who or what she cares about except catching the killer. We know nothing about her life or how she got the way she is. She doesn't really turn out to be interesting.The killer, whom we watch almost from the start, is noticed actually the brilliant 'entry into the mind of a serial killer' he is described as being. If he has 'multiple personality disorder' we don't see his switching from one alter ego to another. We don't see the cold hate it would take to murder woman after woman. The women bear resemblances to each other but some insight into who they represent to him would have been nice. This is no psychological thriller. We don't understand these people. I don't know how to describe my inability to describe the character of the killer and how, somehow, wrong he seems to be; how not up to serial killer-ness he is written or directed. In his work as a grief counselor he seems to do adequately well, although he draws breasts on a drawing of the woman instead of notes during one couples' session; which makes us worry for her life but which turns out to be a red herring. Again, when he takes care of his children and puts them to bed we are a bit chilled as we wonder how much danger they are in.We don't see his needs, what triggers his need to kill again. Again, we don't see 'inside his mind'.At the end it appears, suddenly, that the woman outside consultant and the killer have been in a conscious, personal contest with each other, evidenced by something she says on the phone to him just before the end. This is lifted from some other, much older thrillers and doesn't work, as she divulges too much, it seems almost unprofessionally out of character for her and it is thought of too late.There is an intertwining crime subplot which I didn't understand, can't begin to explain and don't know why it was in there.

I liked her in X-Files so after looking at the reviews it seemed like something worth watching.  Her character in The Fall sure is different from Dana Sculley.  Here she plays a no-nonsense, cold and humorless character who is put in charge of finding a serial killer, played by Jamie Dornan.This is more of a psychological, rather than action-type thriller; some reviews complained about the slow pace but that's in line with developing the characters. Most of the screen time focuses on the actions of the two leads, with some side situations playing out but it's always drawn back to Anderson's efforts to find Dornan, and Dornan's actions as he goes about planning the murder of his next victim.While it starts off slow, just watching the characters and getting to know them drew me in and got me looking forward to finding out what would happen next. There's a menacing suspense that put me on edge during the scenes with Dornan, seeing what he would do next.  Meanwhile I watch Anderson and think what a cold person she is in this role but nevertheless I keep watching to see how she's going to find the killer.  The suspense keeps me hooked, and the lack of action (like car chases, shootings, etc.) doesn't bother me in the least.

The Fall was not disappointing. The Fall is a five part psychological thriller ripe with intrigue. Anderson plays a female detective in London's Metropolitan Police Service who visits Belfast to assist with a murder case. A woman in a man's world, she dives into the gruesome murder investigations with gusto and has no qualms about getting her hands dirty as she hunts down a serial killer.One interesting aspect of this series is that its not just about the police looking or the killer. The scenes are divided pretty evenly between the detective and the murderer, giving you a disturbing look inside a deranged mind. Jamie Dornon does an outstanding job of bringing his vile character to life in true Hannibal Lector style.  Its chilling watching him go from a mild mannered family man to a cold-blooded killer.  In fact, there are a lot of comparisons between this series and Silence of the Lambs, including the connection between the cop and the serial killer. Throughout the show, the detective is striving to outwit the killer before he takes another victim. While it isn't particularly past-faced, what it lacks in action it makes up for in tenseness.

Gillian Anderson's The Fall is oh so much more.Revolving around the dual stories of Anderson's Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson and serial murder Paul Spector, the first series spans five episodes of tense drama as Spector stalks and kills while Gibson rallys the Belfast police to track him down. As the show progresses and Spector takes more risks and makes more mistakes, Gibson has to contend with politics, conspiracies, and general misogyny while trying to deal with both the killer and the other crisis that develop (including the murder and suicide of two policemen).I love Anderson's Gibson... she's brilliant, driven, and no nonsense. All qualities that benefit and occasionally hinder her in a boy's club still seemingly not ready for her. There's a point in the middle of the series where a fellow detective confronts her on a separate case she is only peripherally related to that has some tremendously prescient lines concerning feminism and the double standards of modern society. Great stuff!Spector's storyline is almost as compelling, suffering from the fact of you're never on his side as he goes about stalking, brutalizing, and murdering these women. Still, despite his glaringly obvious flaws, it's nice to have a serial killer living a relatively normal life outside of his darkness. It's something that even Dexter was missing thanks to the inner monologue we get from Michael C. Hall in that show, always reminding us how damaged he is. With Spector (played by Jamie Dornan) we see a devoted father and a seemingly similar husband... who betrays and manipulates all masterfully in order to maintain both his freedom and his anonymity.I think The Fall has to be my second favorite series to come out of Britain... the first being ITV's Endeavour series feature a younger Detective Morse.

Gillian Anderson is superb as the police investigator on the trail of a serial killer in Belfast. Jamie Dornan is equally good as the killer.Now, if it seems as if I may have included a spoiler, I should make it clear that the killer's identity is clear from early on. So &#34;The Fall&#34; is not so much a mystery as a crime drama. But it's more than just a crime drama. Just as Helen Mirren's character had to fight against a system that wasn't quite right for a woman in her position, Anderson's character faces some battles of her own, in part because of her decisions regarding her romantic partners. (To be honest, I thought &#34;The Fall&#34; was a little--but only a little--heavy-handed in its references to misogyny, not in the existence of the problem but in the multiple references outside of the immediate context of Anderson's dealings with others.)My biggest objection to the series was the fact that it ends without a resolution for much of anything. I would not call the fifth episode's ending a true cliffhanger, but neither is the pursuit of the killer resolved. If there is a second series (season) that resolves the issues, I'll be certain to watch it.

These episodes focus on a serial killer and the detective brought in to solve the crimes. Both Anderson and Dornan are tremendous in their parts. Anderson is strong, complex and competent as the inspector. Her accent is light but feels genuine. She also looks fantastic. Dornan is equal parts tortured soul and calculating psychopath. One thing I really like about this series is that you know right away who the killer is. There is also a side plot about police corruption. It is engaging.I had not really understood that this was part one but I did feel the 5 episodes created a satisfying arc. There is a significant amount of violence and viewers should know that going in.

1662065,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00DW5IKN4,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","Crime dramas are a dime a dozen, so what is it about &#8220;The Fall&#8221; that makes it stand out? Three points spring to mind.First of all, Gillian Anderson as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson is a joy to behold (but would you have expected anything else from her?) In what is very much an ensemble cast, she is the closest thing the show has to a protagonist, playing a woman brought in from England to Ireland to oversee the investigation into the murder of successful architect Alice Monroe. A cold and clinical woman, she&#8217;s immensely good at what she does and is not about to tolerate anyone getting in her way. Oozing self-assurance and class, Stella effortlessly takes command and re-galvanizes the police department in their hunt for the killer.Secondly (and surprisingly), the show makes no secret of who the killer is. Paul Spector is a family man and grief counsellor who is first seen breaking into the home of a female solicitor and arranging her underwear on her bed. His wife and children have no idea who he really is, and so the audience is invited to watch him juggle his work and family life with his nocturnal affairs, all the while trying to avoid undue attention from the police. It&#8217;s a chilling performance by Jamie Dornan, whose normal exterior and fondness for his family doesn&#8217;t erase his terrifying drive for violence and domination.Lastly, the setting of Belfast makes for some rich interplay between characters and environment. As is pointed out to Stella early on, policing in this city is both deeply political. The PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) is portrayed as passionately devout yet often corrupt, involved in anything from extra-marital affairs to prostitution rings and drug-dealing. Emotions run high in the police headquarters, not helped by a memorial plaque on the wall dedicated to those murdered in the line of duty. Not killed, but murdered. This attitude spills out onto the streets, where not even a simple arrest can be made or a murder scene investigated without an angry mob showing up to hurl things at the police.Written by Allan Cubitt and directed by Jakob Verbruggen, &#8220;The Fall&#8221; is an exquisitely shot and performed drama that delves into the psychology of not only a killer, but the people who hunt them down. With dozens of characters and a myriad of subplots, it&#8217;s a show that demands your full attention as threads weave in and out of each other, many seemingly irrelevant but eventually tied in with the larger whole. Co-workers, babysitters, family members, reporters, former lovers &#8211; all of them get some degree of screen-time across the first season&#8217;s five episodes, and all of them pack a punch.But the real interest lies in the creepy parallels between Stella and Spector. Both are cold and detached people, but Spector has a much easier time of hiding it behind a veneer of warmth and geniality. It is that it is Stella (our hero) who is such an ice queen that it&#8217;s difficult to get a grasp of her personality, and for much of the drama she remains an enigma; more a force of nature than an actual person. There are even a few eerie parallels between normality and Spector&#8217;s perversity, such as when his wife (a neonatal nurse) suggests to a grieving mother than they wash, dress and take some pictures of her deceased infant &#8211; the very same thing that her husband does to his murder victims.It ends on something of a cliff-hanger (so abruptly that I was left searching for a sixth episode), but thankfully a second season has been commissioned. While it lasts it&#8217;s compelling and insightful drama, sometimes disturbing but never too gratuitous, with impeccable actors at the top of their game. I&#8217;d definitely recommend for fans of crime drama who think they&#8217;ve seen it all &#8211; or simply want to watch beautifully crafted television drama.",5,"""This is the Third Murder in Three Months...""",1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,3911,"['Crime', 'dramas', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'what', '8220', 'Fall', '8221', 'stand', 'out', 'Three', 'points', 'spring', 'mind.First', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'joy', 'behold', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'very', 'much', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'closest', 'thing', 'show', 'protagonist', 'playing', 'woman', 'brought', 'England', 'Ireland', 'oversee', 'investigation', 'murder', 'successful', 'architect', 'Alice', 'Monroe', 'A', 'cold', 'clinical', 'woman', '8217', 'immensely', 'good', 'what', 'not', 'tolerate', 'anyone', 'getting', 'way', 'Oozing', 'self-assurance', 'class', 'Stella', 'effortlessly', 'command', 're-galvanizes', 'police', 'department', 'hunt', 'killer.Secondly', 'surprisingly', 'show', 'secret', 'who', 'killer', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'family', 'man', 'grief', 'counsellor', 'who', 'first', 'seen', 'breaking', 'home', 'female', 'solicitor', 'arranging', 'underwear', 'bed', 'wife', 'children', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'really', 'so', 'audience', 'invited', 'watch', 'juggle', 'work', 'family', 'life', 'nocturnal', 'affairs', 'while', 'trying', 'avoid', 'undue', 'attention', 'police', '8217', 's', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'normal', 'exterior', 'fondness', 'family', 'doesn', '8217', 'erase', 'terrifying', 'drive', 'violence', 'domination.Lastly', 'setting', 'Belfast', 'rich', 'interplay', 'characters', 'environment', 'pointed', 'out', 'Stella', 'early', 'policing', 'city', 'deeply', 'political', 'PSNI', 'Police', 'Service', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'portrayed', 'passionately', 'yet', 'often', 'corrupt', 'involved', 'anything', 'extra-marital', 'affairs', 'prostitution', 'rings', 'drug-dealing', 'Emotions', 'run', 'high', 'police', 'headquarters', 'not', 'helped', 'memorial', 'plaque', 'wall', 'dedicated', 'murdered', 'line', 'duty', 'Not', 'killed', 'murdered', 'attitude', 'out', 'streets', 'where', 'not', 'even', 'simple', 'arrest', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'murder', 'scene', 'investigated', 'angry', 'mob', 'showing', 'up', 'hurl', 'things', 'police.Written', 'Allan', 'Cubitt', 'directed', 'Jakob', 'Verbruggen', '8220', 'Fall', '8221', 'exquisitely', 'shot', 'performed', 'drama', 'psychology', 'not', 'only', 'killer', 'people', 'who', 'hunt', 'down', 'dozens', 'characters', 'myriad', 'subplots', '8217', 's', 'show', 'full', 'attention', 'threads', 'weave', 'other', 'many', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'eventually', 'tied', 'larger', 'whole', 'Co-workers', 'babysitters', 'family', 'members', 'reporters', 'former', 'lovers', '8211', 'get', 'degree', 'screen-time', 'first', 'season', '8217', 'five', 'episodes', 'pack', 'punch.But', 'real', 'interest', 'creepy', 'parallels', 'Stella', 'Spector', 'are', 'cold', 'detached', 'people', 'Spector', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'hiding', 'veneer', 'warmth', 'geniality', 'Stella', 'hero', 'who', 'ice', 'queen', '8217', 'difficult', 'get', 'grasp', 'personality', 'much', 'drama', 'enigma', 'more', 'force', 'nature', 'actual', 'person', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'eerie', 'parallels', 'normality', 'Spector', '8217', 's', 'perversity', 'such', 'when', 'wife', 'neonatal', 'nurse', 'grieving', 'mother', 'wash', 'dress', 'take', 'pictures', 'deceased', 'infant', '8211', 'very', 'same', 'thing', 'husband', 'murder', 'victims.It', 'something', 'cliff-hanger', 'so', 'abruptly', 'was', 'left', 'searching', 'sixth', 'episode', 'thankfully', 'second', 'season', 'been', 'commissioned', '8217', 'compelling', 'insightful', 'drama', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'never', 'too', 'gratuitous', 'impeccable', 'actors', 'top', 'game', '8217', 'd', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'fans', 'crime', 'drama', 'who', 'think', '8217', 've', 'seen', '8211', 'simply', 'want', 'watch', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'television', 'drama']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

1662068,A2UYGOYMV73826,B00DW5IKN4,Rushmore,"[1, 1]","This series has been named to Entertainment Weekly's Top Ten for 2013.  It has been called fascinating, gripping, a taut psychological thriller.  The major criticism of the DVD set among Amazon reviewers is that Series 1 ends abruptly without much resolution, not what the viewer would expect from a story with basically the single plot point of catching a serial murderer before he strikes again.  However, I have other issues with this series.My major problem is the lack of relatability among the major characters.  The chief investigator Stella Gibson is a cold fish indeed. I expected more passion from a woman who is investigating the horrific murders of other women.  Obviously as a female in a male-dominated business, she has had to prove herself over and over again.  The producers have chosen to strip away all vestiges of emotion from her character.  Consequently, she has justice on her side but not much more.  It's hard for me to cheer her on.Paul Spector, the serial killer, is equally emotionless and ten times creepier.  I do not buy for one minute that he cares about anybody in his life.  He intermittently goes through the motions of acting like the loving family man, but he is not really present in these scenes.  In the background his mind seems to be going through thousands of calculations in preparation for his next hit, or figuring out how not to get caught for what he has already done. Why does he do it?  We hear that he had a troubled childhood, just that with no details.  From my perspective that is way too pat of an explanation.There are only a couple of characters I cared about, both women.  Archie Panjabi as Dr. Tanya Reed Smith, the pathologist in the investigation, is pretty brilliant.  What a refreshing departure from her role in The Good Wife.  Also Dani Ferrington, a police constable assisting Gibson, is compelling but ultimately without much ability to impact the outcome.  Both of these women display compassion, in a world otherwise devoid of it.  Paul's wife Sally Ann is an interesting character.  Early on, in maybe the only vaguely light-hearted moment of the series, they are in bed together and she calls him a ""horrible man.""  That's what passes for irony in this show.  I hate that she is so clueless about the man Paul really is.  Sad to say, I don't find her to be a very sympathetic character.The second major issue for me is the unrelenting bleakness of it all.  I realize it's not a happy story, but it's exhausting to watch.  I guess this would be the time to mention that the soundtrack is perfect at creating that ominous creepy atmosphere.The ending-that-is-not-an ending is annoying.  Apparently filming has not started yet on Series 2.  To me, it seems manipulative on the part of the producers to assume that viewers will be hooked enough to wait a year or more for the story to resume.  I don't care enough about the major characters to wait that long.  Of course Paul Spector must be stopped before he kills more women.  But I really don't want to sit through another 5 hours (or, God forbid, longer) of bringing that story to a resolution.My husband watched the show separately from me.  His reaction:  he almost turned it off midway through the first episode, but he ended up watching 3 episodes the first night and finished it up the second night.  He was displeased about the ending but definitely plans to watch Series 2, with or without me.  We discussed my objections to the show, and he was actually the one who helped me realize that Dani and Tanya are sympathetic characters.  He did seem to find some redeeming value here.  Without his input, I probably would have given it 2 stars.",3,Cold and dark,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,3668,"['series', 'been', 'named', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'Top', 'Ten', '2013', 'been', 'called', 'fascinating', 'gripping', 'taut', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'major', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'set', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'Series', '1', 'abruptly', 'much', 'resolution', 'not', 'what', 'viewer', 'would', 'expect', 'story', 'basically', 'single', 'plot', 'point', 'catching', 'serial', 'murderer', 'again', 'However', 'have', 'other', 'issues', 'series.My', 'major', 'problem', 'lack', 'relatability', 'major', 'characters', 'chief', 'investigator', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'cold', 'fish', 'indeed', 'expected', 'more', 'passion', 'woman', 'who', 'investigating', 'horrific', 'murders', 'other', 'women', 'Obviously', 'female', 'male-dominated', 'business', 'had', 'prove', 'over', 'again', 'producers', 'have', 'chosen', 'strip', 'away', 'vestiges', 'emotion', 'character', 'Consequently', 'justice', 'side', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'hard', 'cheer', 'on.Paul', 'Spector', 'serial', 'killer', 'equally', 'emotionless', 'ten', 'times', 'creepier', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'one', 'minute', 'anybody', 'life', 'intermittently', 'motions', 'acting', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'not', 'really', 'present', 'scenes', 'background', 'mind', 'be', 'going', 'thousands', 'calculations', 'preparation', 'next', 'hit', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'what', 'already', 'done', 'Why', 'do', 'hear', 'had', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'just', 'details', 'perspective', 'way', 'too', 'pat', 'explanation.There', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'characters', 'cared', 'about', 'women', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'Dr.', 'Tanya', 'Reed', 'Smith', 'pathologist', 'investigation', 'pretty', 'brilliant', 'What', 'refreshing', 'departure', 'role', 'Good', 'Wife', 'Also', 'Dani', 'Ferrington', 'police', 'constable', 'assisting', 'Gibson', 'compelling', 'ultimately', 'much', 'ability', 'impact', 'outcome', 'women', 'display', 'compassion', 'world', 'otherwise', 'devoid', 'Paul', 'wife', 'Sally', 'Ann', 'interesting', 'character', 'Early', 'maybe', 'only', 'vaguely', 'light-hearted', 'moment', 'series', 'are', 'bed', 'together', 'horrible', 'man', 'what', 'irony', 'show', 'hate', 'so', 'clueless', 'man', 'Paul', 'really', 'Sad', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character.The', 'second', 'major', 'issue', 'unrelenting', 'bleakness', 'realize', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'exhausting', 'watch', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'creating', 'ominous', 'creepy', 'ending-that-is-not-an', 'ending', 'annoying', 'Apparently', 'filming', 'not', 'started', 'yet', 'Series', '2', 'manipulative', 'part', 'producers', 'assume', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'hooked', 'enough', 'wait', 'year', 'more', 'story', 'resume', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'major', 'characters', 'wait', 'long', 'course', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'more', 'women', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', '5', 'hours', 'God', 'forbid', 'longer', 'bringing', 'story', 'resolution.My', 'husband', 'watched', 'show', 'separately', 'reaction', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'midway', 'first', 'episode', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', '3', 'first', 'night', 'finished', 'up', 'second', 'night', 'was', 'displeased', 'ending', 'definitely', 'watch', 'Series', '2', 'discussed', 'objections', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'who', 'helped', 'realize', 'Dani', 'Tanya', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'did', 'seem', 'find', 'redeeming', 'value', 'here', 'input', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given', '2', 'stars']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

You have no idea how slow this 5 episode series is. I have seen snails move quicker. To give you an idea, the single thing that you will see more of in this series is Walking. Example; one police officer is shown walking down a long hallway, all the way from the beginning to the end. Every last detail is drawn out and out. The entire 5 episodes could have easily been condensed into one. I fast forwarded through half the series just because I had to see how it ended. What a waste of time as the ending was inconclusive and disappointing. Basically there is no ending.The characters are shallow and not developed at all. Anderson is brought to Belfast to help with an investigation into a murder. She spouts the usual cliches relating to murder investigations. Little to no insight is provided to her character in the way of background and she acts timid as an investigator. She is giving a lecture to other officers regarding the case, one officer shows up late, still eating and she says nothing. She just ignores it rather than chastise the officer for showing disregard for the importance of the case.Anderson does finally come up with a few insights into the murderer but they are so broad that they are of little use.Some of the other reviews lauded that this series took the time so we could get to know the murderer. But we do not as there was nothing in the way of reasons for the murderer's actions other than something that happened in college. How that can possibly relate to the killer's current motives is never explained.Overall a boring, slow and disappointing detective mystery series.

Like most television dramas the ending left plenty of questions in order for people to watch the next season's episodes which regrettably  may not be available for a while. I enjoyed the series and dvd.Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan drive the series. They are outwardly, in many ways, the opposite of what you would expected them to be.Anderson is a female detective who Is convinced that there is a serial killer on the lose. Her character is  cold, calculating, tough, and driven. She is not interested in having a relationship or family but picks a male detective to spend the night with based on his looks.Dornan is a serial killer who is a grief counselor and a family man with a wife and two children. Outwardly, his character seems to care about his family and comes across as a warm, caring family man. His character shows characteristics, as the series progresses, that indicate who he really is as does Anderson's character.This is very much dialogue driven. I loved the dialogue and the development of the two main characters.  While there is violence it is not as much as I would have expected in a series about a serial killer.The series is only six episodes.  The ending leaves some big questions. The problem is, according to a number of sources on the web, the next season is not set to start production until January of February 2014. Since this appeared on the BBC I think it could be a while for the next season to become available to American viewers.Lately it seems like a number of series will take six to 10 months, and on some occasions more than a year, between seasons. I don't appreciate that and it makes me think less of those who create the series.The picture and sound quality of the dvd is very good. There is a short feature about the making of the series that is just okay.I will be on the look out for the next season of this series and will watch it. Yet, if for some reason season two never makes it to American television I won't be overly upset. This is a good series that given time to develop could be great but I am not counting the months until season two begins.",4,Good Series that Could Be Great But the Next Espisodes Will Not Be Available For A While,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2296,"['dialogue', 'driven', 'crime/serial', 'killer', 'drama', 'slow', 'first', 'episode', 'up', 'speed', 'next', 'four', 'episodes', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'dvd', 'was', 'fine', 'most', 'television', 'ending', 'left', 'plenty', 'questions', 'order', 'people', 'watch', 'next', 'season', 'episodes', 'regrettably', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'while', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'dvd.Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'drive', 'series', 'are', 'outwardly', 'many', 'ways', 'opposite', 'what', 'would', 'expected', 'be.Anderson', 'female', 'detective', 'who', 'convinced', 'serial', 'killer', 'lose', 'character', 'cold', 'calculating', 'tough', 'driven', 'not', 'interested', 'having', 'relationship', 'family', 'male', 'detective', 'spend', 'night', 'based', 'looks.Dornan', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'grief', 'counselor', 'family', 'man', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'Outwardly', 'character', 'care', 'family', 'across', 'warm', 'caring', 'family', 'man', 'character', 'characteristics', 'series', 'indicate', 'who', 'really', 'Anderson', 'character.This', 'very', 'much', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'loved', 'dialogue', 'development', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'violence', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'series', 'serial', 'killer.The', 'series', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'ending', 'big', 'questions', 'problem', 'according', 'number', 'sources', 'web', 'next', 'season', 'not', 'set', 'start', 'production', 'January', 'February', '2014', 'appeared', 'BBC', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'while', 'next', 'season', 'become', 'available', 'American', 'viewers.Lately', 'number', 'series', 'will', 'take', 'six', '10', 'months', 'occasions', 'more', 'year', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'think', 'less', 'who', 'create', 'series.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'dvd', 'very', 'good', 'short', 'feature', 'making', 'series', 'just', 'okay.I', 'will', 'be', 'look', 'out', 'next', 'season', 'series', 'will', 'watch', 'reason', 'season', 'two', 'never', 'American', 'television', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'overly', 'upset', 'good', 'series', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'am', 'not', 'counting', 'months', 'season', 'two', 'begins']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

It just have to draw me in to the point that I THINK it's perfect.  Looking back at this series I do admit that Gillian Anderson's accent wavers a bit at times.  However I was so enthralled with her character that it didn't really bother me.  In fact I started watching this series late on a weeknight intending to just watch the first episode. Five episodes later I was wondering if it was worth even trying to get any sleep. I have watched it twice since then, each time enjoying the story and characterization equally.This is a serial killer/police procedural set in Belfast, Northern Ireland. There is a serial killer operating in Belfast and when the Police Service of Northern Ireland is unable to close the case within 28 days Gillian Anderson's character, Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson is brought in to review the case.  Driven, intelligent and self contained, DS Gibson is not above making a mistake that will haunt her as she struggles to identify the killer.I've been fascinated by the reaction to Anderson's character as well. Some people have said that the character of the serial killer is more attractive and easier to like than Anderson.  I would argue that this is clearly intentional.  The serial killer (whose identity is not a secret) is living a total lie.  He is shown as having great affection for his children but hides evidence of his crimes in his daughter's room.  When he is caught out about an intended victim he immediately turns the incident to his own advantage.  Why would anyone prefer the sociopath whose whole life is a construct to the rough edged detective?  I think it has a lot to do with gender expectations. Anderson's character acts against what one would expect of a woman in a protective role.  But this ignores the fact that Anderson is not in the protector, she is the hunter instead.I thought the ending was satisfying but others have disagreed.  I'm rather hoping that things will be further considered in a future episode.Recommended for those who appreciate a well written, well acted series.By the way, I hope everyone noticed that the episode titles were from John Milton's Paradise Lost.",5,Loved It!

McGee,"[0, 0]","Dark, dark, dark...Even the camera seems to have found only shades of grey and black when this gripping noir miniseries was shot -- the occasional glimpses of red or any other bright color almost hit me between the eyes. Similarly, there's an undercurrent of depression and angst among its main characters, who range from Gillian Anderson (as an icily efficient and unemotional top cop from Scotland Yard) to Jamie Dornan, featured as a Belfast grief counselor by day/serial killer by night.The novelty of this five-part series lies in that juxtaposition: we see at least as much of killer Paul Spector's home life and his struggles to balance his dual identity as we do Stella Gibson's apparent inability to form any kind of identity that isn't tied to her job. Whether it's office politics, violence on the streets, the death of a fellow cop: nothing seems to rattle her almost impenetrable facade. Only when she comes face to face with Spector's victims and their lives do we see a hint of the emotional damage that a life spent investigating violent crime can create.I found the first episode to be almost unrelievedly bleak, but while that tone remained, the plot and characters reeled me in until I became addicted, and stayed up late one night to watch to the end. My only major quibble with the latest in a long series of excellent imports of British crime miniseries was the fact that the ending itself was so ambiguous that at 3 a.m. I found myself hunting around online to be sure that my DVD set was complete and there were only five episodes and not a sixth one that had been left out -- and after that, to scour the web, in vain, in search of information about a second series. The writers and director have set the stage for a very, very intriguing followup...If you find a massive cliffhanger at the end of a series incredibly frustrating, this may not be great material for you. On the other hand, if you've watched shows likeLutheror Sherlock: Season One (2010), this offers a similar combination of a dark edge, great writing, intense drama and solid acting by all concerned.

1662076,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00DW5IKN4,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 2]","THE FALL, (2013), is a British television series, a BBC production of a psychological mystery that stars the beauteous Gillian Anderson, an Emmy and Golden Globe winner as Agent Scully of THE X FILES. Anderson plays steely Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson of London's Met, who has been sent to Belfast, Northern Ireland to help solve a high-profile murder.  But she recognizes the work of a serial killer, and stays on in Belfast to work the case.  However, we realize Paul Spector, the charismatic killer, outwardly a loving family man and caring grief counselor, as played by Jamie Dornan, MARIE ANTOINETTE, has already targeted his next victim, the comely young attorney Sarah Kay.  Also starring are Archie Panjabi, (THE GOOD WIFE) and John Lynch, (IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER).  This dramatic thriller was created by the greatly talented Allan Cubitt, PRIME SUSPECT 2. The entertainment consists of a 306 minute box set, five  episodes on two DVDs, and a behind the scenes featurette. My TV found subtitles, which were welcome, considering the local accents.  The entertainment is intended for mature audiences.What we have here, clearly, is a suspenseful tale of two lone hunters, killer and  detective, circling each other. Each is mesmerizing, as played by highly-talented actors.  We also have the city of Belfast as the killing ground, with a starring presence. It is no longer the city many viewers will remember from its murderous Troubles decades ago, but quite a presentable modern city that has its own charm.  Still, it apparently remains home to tough guys aplenty.  At one point, Spector ventures into the Shankill neighborhood, where streets once ran with blood, and is reminded by the locals that this is the Shankill and he should not be there.  Ever again.  The title of the entertainment may be another reference to the Troubles: the Falls, another area where blood once flowed.The five episodes all bear titles taken from the medieval Italian poet Dante's THE INFERNO:Disc 1Episode 1, Darkness Descends.Investigation into the murder of a Belfast architect of prominent family goes cold, Gibson is sent down from London to help.  But the killer is already stalking his next victim.Episode 2 Darkness Visible.The attorney is found dead in her home. Gibson is certain the crime shows a serial killer at work; she convinces the local police to put her in charge of the investigation.  Spector has  taken  keepsakes from his victim, and  is furious when he suspects the flirtatious teenaged babysitter has snooped in his office.Episode 3.Insolence & Wine.Gibson's relationship with detective James Olson comes under scrutiny in the wake of his assassination. Meanwhile, she holds a press conference to alert the city that  three recent murders may be linked. Spector, on a visit to his in-laws' house, finds an empty shack; he feverishly fantasizes about the victim he's picked to take there.Disc 2Episode 4. My Adventurous Song.As the sordid details and big local names attached to Olson's death come out, the investigation takes its toll. On the other hand, Gibson catches a break: the killer contacts one of his victim's families.Episode 5. The Vast Abyss.The grisly aftermath of Spector's latest attack  foils  his plans. He is frantic and infuriated,  flees the crime scene, hastily disposes of evidence, all while trying to placate his wife and the babysitter, and keep his home life from falling apart. Gibson inches nearer to discovering his identity.At one point, Spector writes down lines from THE HOLLOW MAN, a famous poem from the greatly-honored Anglo-American poet T.S. Eliot, and thanks to IMDb users for helping in their explication.""Between the ideaAnd the realityBetween the motionAnd the ActFalls the Shadow.""So there we have the falls again.  Also the Shadow, another name for a ghost, or specter.  Further, the poem states the world ended ""not  with a bang but with a whimper.""  As does the series we see.  So it seems clear  writer/creator Cubitt was inspired by THE HOLLOW MAN.A thinking man's mystery, along the fondly-remembered lines of PRIME SUSPECT.  We found it rich, multi-layered, engrossing viewing in this house.  But beware: some of the crime scenes are disturbing; they do involve nudity, violence.  And this British mystery does move slowly, by American standards.

This is an Acorn product. I generally love this &#8220;mini-series&#8221; and I really like Gillian Anderson as an actress, so I was looking forward to this DVD. Unlike the US, the BBC runs short &#8220;series of 5 to 6 episodes, making it easier to get through a season. But most have story lines that are resolved in each episode or, certainly, by the end, though there may be a cliff hanger. &#8220;The Fall&#8221; is  different.  There is just ONE storyline (a serial killer and the detective looking for him) and, since each episode is 61 minutes long, it&#8217;s really a 6-hour plus film. And though I don&#8217;t like to give &#8220;spoilers&#8221; in my reviews, I feel it necessary to say that the story arc is not resolved at the end  and will carry over to &#8220;Series 2&#8221;.There were two other issues I had with this series &#8211; but they are, honestly, subjective. I found the story moving slowly- way too slow for me &#8211; and I found the serial killer (Jamie Dorman) really creepy and almost &#8220;dirty&#8221; (if I&#8217;m choosing the right word). Again, how you feel about really deranged folks working in professions like &#8220;counseling&#8221; will determine how you react to the series.The set has one bonus: a 12-minute &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurette.This is really the first of the Acorn BBC DVDs that I felt I could only rate &#8220;It&#8217;s Ok&#8221; (3 stars)I hope the info in this review was informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",3,"""Series 1"" is one long 6 hour mystery &#8211; that isn&#8217;t resolved in the end.",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1807,"['copy', '8220', 'Fall', '8221', 'DVD', 'was', 'sent', 'Amazon', 'part', '8220', 'Vine', 'Reviewer', '8221', 'program', 'send', 'items', 'selected', 'group', 'reviewers.I', 'have', 'reviewed', 'many', 'BBC', 'crime', 'shows', 'Amazon', 'released', 'BBC', 'Home', 'Video', 'Acorn', 'Acorn', 'product', 'generally', 'love', '8220', 'mini-series', '8221', 'really', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'actress', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'US', 'BBC', 'short', '8220', 'series', '5', '6', 'episodes', 'making', 'easier', 'get', 'season', 'most', 'have', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'resolved', 'episode', 'certainly', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'cliff', 'hanger', '8220', 'Fall', '8221', 'different', 'just', 'ONE', 'storyline', 'serial', 'killer', 'detective', 'looking', 'episode', '61', 'minutes', 'long', '8217', 's', 'really', '6-hour', 'plus', 'film', 'don', '8217', 't', 'give', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', 'reviews', 'feel', 'necessary', 'say', 'story', 'arc', 'not', 'resolved', 'end', 'will', 'carry', '8220', 'Series', '2', '8221', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'issues', 'had', 'series', '8211', 'are', 'honestly', 'subjective', 'found', 'story', 'moving', 'slowly-', 'way', 'too', 'slow', '8211', 'found', 'serial', 'killer', 'Jamie', 'Dorman', 'really', 'creepy', 'almost', '8220', '8221', '8217', 'choosing', 'right', 'word', 'Again', 'how', 'feel', 'really', 'deranged', 'folks', 'working', 'professions', '8220', 'counseling', '8221', 'will', 'determine', 'how', 'react', 'series.The', 'set', 'one', 'bonus', '12-minute', '8220', 'Scenes', '8221', 'featurette.This', 'really', 'first', 'Acorn', 'BBC', 'DVDs', 'felt', 'could', 'only', 'rate', '8220', '8217', 'Ok', '8221', '3', 'stars', 'hope', 'info', 'review', 'was', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

Well, not so in the BBC's five-part series, The Fall.  Defying both convention and viewer expectations, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) is a husband and father.  This dichotomy of character is deeply, deeply disturbing.  As is much of what is depicted in The Fall.  This is dark stuff.  The police hunting this killer, led by Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson, are some pretty dark characters themselves, leading to a rather moody and atmospheric production.That said, this is smart television.  British series always seem to be more along the line of what viewers in the US might see on premium cable.  Things are a bit edgier and more graphic.  The writing and performances in The Fall are sharp.  And despite knowing from the start who-done-it, the tone of the series is unrelentingly suspenseful.The Fall won't appeal to everyone.  This is a grim telling of a sad story.  Also, it should be noted, this first series does not come to a neat resolution.  Personally, I'm a fan of these more realistic endings, but the BBC has promised more of The Fall, so we shall all have to see what comes next.",4,BBC's The Fall is a dark take on a familiar genre,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1187,"['What', 'old', 'clich', 'eacute', 'serial', 'killers', 'was', 'quiet', 'kept', 'Well', 'not', 'so', 'BBC', 'five-part', 'series', 'Fall', 'Defying', 'convention', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'husband', 'father', 'dichotomy', 'character', 'deeply', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'much', 'what', 'depicted', 'Fall', 'dark', 'stuff', 'police', 'hunting', 'killer', 'led', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'are', 'pretty', 'dark', 'characters', 'leading', 'rather', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'production.That', 'said', 'smart', 'television', 'British', 'series', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'line', 'what', 'viewers', 'US', 'might', 'see', 'premium', 'cable', 'Things', 'are', 'bit', 'edgier', 'more', 'graphic', 'writing', 'performances', 'Fall', 'are', 'sharp', 'knowing', 'start', 'who-done-it', 'tone', 'series', 'unrelentingly', 'suspenseful.The', 'Fall', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'grim', 'telling', 'sad', 'story', 'Also', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'first', 'series', 'not', 'come', 'neat', 'resolution', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'fan', 'more', 'realistic', 'endings', 'BBC', 'promised', 'more', 'Fall', 'shall', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'next']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"
1662080,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B00DW5IKN4,Talvi,"[2, 3]","The Fall was on Entertainment Weekly's end of year list: Top 10 BEST TV Shows of the Year.  Here is what it said: ""It cleverly juxtaposes a take-charge, sexual female with a pseudo-strong, psycho mysogynist.""When Jamie Dornan was named as the actor who would play Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie, Lena Dunham tweeted: ""Wasn't allowed to be attracted to him on The Fall bc he played a sexmurderer. 50 Shades is my big chance...""  It's very similar  to how I feel about the series The Fall, because it feels wrong to like it since it takes you to an unsettlingly intimate place with Jamie Dornan's serial killer Paul Spector.Jamie Dornan had recently appeared in Once Upon a Time as Sherrif Graham/The Huntsman, and I can remember a fan outcry when his character met with an early demise. However, if you decide to see this movie based on his performance on that American TV series, you may not recognize him.  Jamie Dornan is mesmerizing in The Fall, with an uncanny ability to play an unassuming family man and social worker one minute and a calculating killer struggling to sate his monstrous desires the next. It leaves you feeling haunted watching this husband and father of two kiss his family goodbye to then go and pick out a new female victim, stalk her, break into her flat, and then slowly and with great pleasure kill her.Jamie Dornan's superb performance is matched by the understated control of Gillian Anderson, who plays a Detective Superintendent in the Metropolitan Police Service who travels from London to Belfast to investigate. She is a shrewd, confident, but cold woman who sees someone she wants upon arrival, invites him to her hotel room, and directs him through expeditious sex with an interest only for her own gratification. Later, when he texts her a cameraphone photo, she's displeased and dismissive. It is easy to understand why men find her so threatening and so desirable. Our first view of her is that of a hunter of men, just as our early exposure to Paul Spector is that of a hunter of women. Both are seeking their own gratification with a ruthless disregard.  Obviously they are on very different levels, but the similarities are drawn, and as the series continues, you know that Paul will be drawn to Gillian Anderson's Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson.The direction on this series is excellent, though viewing it leads you to chillingly think of the comments you often hear in the news after someone does something atrocious - ""he seemed like such a normal guy."" The series takes you mercilessly through Paul's encounters with his victims, leaving you feeling helpless and desperately hoping for the last minute intervention that so often comes in other films and TV series.  Paul is very careful, and almost tenderly cleans and prepares his murder scenes and victims.  You watch as he can't stop himself from seeking his next victim, and as he does, the police become more frustrated and under greater pressure to stop him.The suspense and the visceral agony of this series leaves a lasting impression that is difficult to shake off. It is not just a police procedural. It takes a very deep dive into the psyches of the main characters, and the stark portrayals uncomfortably resonate.  The tension in this series is both exquisite and agonizing, and the no-resolution ending of season one leaves you a little haunted.If you like MI:5/Spooks, The State Within, Orphan Black, dark dramas or police procedurals, you may enjoy this. Just know going into it that it will take you along for several hours of excruciating tension and helplessness before giving you some hope that Paul will be stopped.",5,Extremely well made series that is a tense and painfully intimate view of a serial killer and the woman trying to catch him.,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3659,"['Fall', 'was', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'end', 'year', 'list', 'Top', '10', 'BEST', 'TV', 'Shows', 'Year', 'Here', 'what', 'said', 'cleverly', 'take-charge', 'sexual', 'female', 'pseudo-strong', 'psycho', 'mysogynist', 'When', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'was', 'named', 'actor', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Christian', 'Grey', 'Fifty', 'Shades', 'Grey', 'movie', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'tweeted', 'Was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'be', 'attracted', 'Fall', 'bc', 'played', 'sexmurderer', '50', 'Shades', 'big', 'chance', 'very', 'similar', 'how', 'feel', 'series', 'Fall', 'wrong', 'like', 'unsettlingly', 'intimate', 'place', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'serial', 'killer', 'Paul', 'Spector.Jamie', 'Dornan', 'had', 'recently', 'appeared', 'Once', 'Time', 'Sherrif', 'Graham/The', 'Huntsman', 'can', 'remember', 'fan', 'outcry', 'when', 'character', 'met', 'early', 'demise', 'However', 'decide', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'performance', 'American', 'TV', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'mesmerizing', 'Fall', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'play', 'unassuming', 'family', 'man', 'social', 'worker', 'one', 'minute', 'calculating', 'killer', 'struggling', 'sate', 'monstrous', 'next', 'feeling', 'haunted', 'watching', 'husband', 'father', 'two', 'kiss', 'family', 'goodbye', 'then', 'go', 'pick', 'out', 'new', 'female', 'victim', 'stalk', 'break', 'flat', 'then', 'slowly', 'great', 'pleasure', 'kill', 'her.Jamie', 'Dornan', 'superb', 'performance', 'matched', 'understated', 'control', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'Service', 'who', 'London', 'Belfast', 'investigate', 'shrewd', 'confident', 'cold', 'woman', 'who', 'someone', 'arrival', 'hotel', 'room', 'expeditious', 'sex', 'interest', 'only', 'own', 'gratification', 'Later', 'when', 'texts', 'cameraphone', 'photo', 'displeased', 'dismissive', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'men', 'find', 'so', 'threatening', 'so', 'desirable', 'first', 'view', 'hunter', 'men', 'just', 'early', 'exposure', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'hunter', 'women', 'are', 'seeking', 'own', 'gratification', 'ruthless', 'disregard', 'Obviously', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'levels', 'similarities', 'are', 'drawn', 'series', 'know', 'Paul', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Stella', 'Gibson.The', 'direction', 'series', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'chillingly', 'think', 'comments', 'often', 'hear', 'news', 'someone', 'something', 'atrocious', 'seemed', 'such', 'normal', 'guy', 'series', 'mercilessly', 'Paul', 'encounters', 'victims', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'helpless', 'desperately', 'hoping', 'last', 'minute', 'intervention', 'so', 'often', 'other', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'Paul', 'very', 'careful', 'almost', 'tenderly', 'cleans', 'murder', 'scenes', 'victims', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'seeking', 'next', 'victim', 'police', 'become', 'more', 'frustrated', 'greater', 'pressure', 'stop', 'him.The', 'suspense', 'visceral', 'agony', 'series', 'lasting', 'impression', 'difficult', 'shake', 'off', 'not', 'just', 'police', 'procedural', 'very', 'deep', 'dive', 'psyches', 'main', 'characters', 'stark', 'portrayals', 'uncomfortably', 'resonate', 'tension', 'series', 'exquisite', 'agonizing', 'no-resolution', 'ending', 'season', 'one', 'little', 'haunted.If', 'MI:5/Spooks', 'State', 'Within', 'Orphan', 'Black', 'dark', 'dramas', 'police', 'procedurals', 'may', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'know', 'going', 'will', 'take', 'along', 'several', 'hours', 'excruciating', 'tension', 'helplessness', 'giving', 'hope', 'Paul', 'will', 'be', 'stopped']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"
1662081,A1C139F5C7Y38P,B00DW5IKN4,"The Matrix Fan ""Video Gamer since 1979.""","[0, 0]","This review is written from the desk of an X-Phile. I won't lie, initially the only thing which drew me into watching this DVD set was Gillian Anderson's face on the cover. As I watched ""The Fall"", however, I found myself fascinated by (and also deeply disturbed by) Jamie Dornon's character. Hopefully my review will explain how that happened.THE SHOW:In our game of cat and mouse, we have Stella Gibson (played by Gillian Anderson), a detective superintendent called in from London to review some killings in Belfast. Her opponent is Paul Spector (played by Jamie Dornon), a bereavement counselor by day and serial killer by night.It did take me a while to get used to watching this show - I usually watch network TV shows which give me about 42-45 minutes per episode, and those have buildups to commercial breaks. However, each episode of The Fall clocks in at an average of 58 minutes, and I found myself glued to the screen to make sure I didn't miss anything.Gillian Anderson did a great job in her portrayal of Stella Gibson. She lives alone and only seems interested in working the case from the get-go. She doesn't make many lasting connections with people, professionally or personally. She has a ""Sweet Night"" with another character, and it's devoid of any emotional connection. Gibson works the case as clinically and coldly as possible, in front of her computer with a glass of wine and lots of silence. To this effect, she doesn't show the same type of focus on the crimes or the killer as Will Graham did in the TV show Hannibal. It seems her life has no meaning without a monster to chase.As the series went on, I found that Jamie Dornon absolutely stole the show as Paul Spector. From the first episode we see the depths of his depravity - he sneaks into a woman's house, smells her underwear, takes pictures, and even calmly eats an orange right before his intended victim returns home. As he returns to his house, we see the flip side of his personality as he comforts his young son and tucks him back into bed before returning to his own bedroom and the comfort of his wife. His ability to play the roles of counselor and killer so convincingly made his crimes all the more disturbing and unsettling to watch.The music was minimal throughout each episode, usually coming in whenever Paul Spector was hunting his next victim or whenever Stella Gibson was working the case files. This seemed to reflect the emptiness in each of their lives, which couldn't be filled by their individual actions.I found the most powerful moments in this crime drama were the subtle points which usually get overlooked in American-produced shows. For example, in one crime scene the medical examiners mentioned being surprised at the lack of bodily fluids around the corpse of a strangled woman, expecting more mess. They came to the realization that the killer bathed his victim and cleaned the bedding. These types of dialogue can end up on the cutting room floor in shows like CSI or Hannibal, but their inclusion gave strength to this show.There were a few plotlines that felt too rushed or never got resolved, but since this is only season one, I can't determine if they're simply hanging threads to get resolved in the season(s) to come. I'll have to wait and see.DVD EXTRAS:""The Fall - Behind the Scenes"" is a 12 minute featurette on disc 2 with segments from Julian Stevens (Producer), Gillian Anderson, Jakob Verbruggen (Director), Jamie Dornan, Pamela Smith (Makeup & Hair Designer), and Tom McCullough (Production Designer). They talk about the show, the characters, the production crew, and shooting the show in Belfast which serves to break images of The Troubles from years past.All episodes and the featurette are close-captioned.FINAL THOUGHTS:This season, though far too brief with only 5 episodes, was able to capture my interests. I found myself completely absorbed by Jamie Dornan's portrayal of Paul Spector. One minute I would be repulsed by his actions and his apparent disconnection from morals, and in the next segment he'd be watching his daughter performing a cute dance routine or kissing his son's teddy bear good night and I'd think ""Oh, that's so sweet...wait, what's the matter with me?!?""For me, ""The Fall"" represented the journey from one end of my comfort zone to the other, and back again. I'm looking forward to season two.Highly recommended!",4,Picked it up for Gillian Anderson - and became mesmerized by Jamie Dornan.,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,4379,"['review', 'written', 'desk', 'X-Phile', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'initially', 'only', 'thing', 'drew', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'face', 'cover', 'watched', 'Fall', 'however', 'found', 'fascinated', 'also', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'Jamie', 'Dornon', 'character', 'Hopefully', 'review', 'will', 'explain', 'how', 'SHOW', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'have', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'played', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'detective', 'superintendent', 'called', 'London', 'review', 'killings', 'Belfast', 'opponent', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Dornon', 'bereavement', 'counselor', 'day', 'serial', 'killer', 'night.It', 'did', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'watching', 'show', 'usually', 'watch', 'network', 'TV', 'shows', 'give', '42-45', 'minutes', 'episode', 'have', 'buildups', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'However', 'episode', 'Fall', 'average', '58', 'minutes', 'found', 'glued', 'screen', 'make', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything.Gillian', 'Anderson', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'alone', 'only', 'interested', 'working', 'case', 'get-go', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'lasting', 'connections', 'people', 'professionally', 'personally', 'Sweet', 'Night', 'character', 'devoid', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Gibson', 'case', 'clinically', 'coldly', 'possible', 'front', 'computer', 'glass', 'wine', 'lots', 'silence', 'effect', ""n't"", 'show', 'same', 'type', 'focus', 'crimes', 'killer', 'Will', 'Graham', 'did', 'TV', 'show', 'Hannibal', 'life', 'meaning', 'monster', 'chase.As', 'series', 'went', 'found', 'Jamie', 'Dornon', 'absolutely', 'stole', 'show', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'first', 'episode', 'see', 'depths', 'depravity', 'woman', 'house', 'underwear', 'pictures', 'even', 'calmly', 'eats', 'orange', 'right', 'intended', 'victim', 'returns', 'home', 'house', 'see', 'flip', 'side', 'personality', 'young', 'son', 'back', 'bed', 'returning', 'own', 'bedroom', 'comfort', 'wife', 'ability', 'play', 'roles', 'counselor', 'killer', 'so', 'convincingly', 'made', 'crimes', 'more', 'disturbing', 'unsettling', 'watch.The', 'music', 'was', 'minimal', 'episode', 'usually', 'coming', 'whenever', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'was', 'hunting', 'next', 'victim', 'whenever', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'was', 'working', 'case', 'seemed', 'reflect', 'emptiness', 'lives', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'filled', 'individual', 'actions.I', 'found', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'crime', 'drama', 'were', 'subtle', 'points', 'usually', 'get', 'overlooked', 'American-produced', 'shows', 'example', 'one', 'crime', 'scene', 'medical', 'examiners', 'mentioned', 'being', 'surprised', 'lack', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'corpse', 'strangled', 'woman', 'expecting', 'more', 'mess', 'came', 'realization', 'killer', 'bathed', 'victim', 'cleaned', 'bedding', 'types', 'dialogue', 'can', 'end', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'shows', 'CSI', 'Hannibal', 'inclusion', 'gave', 'strength', 'show.There', 'were', 'few', 'plotlines', 'felt', 'too', 'rushed', 'never', 'got', 'resolved', 'only', 'season', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'determine', ""'re"", 'simply', 'hanging', 'threads', 'get', 'resolved', 'season', 'come', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'see.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Fall', 'Scenes', '12', 'minute', 'featurette', 'disc', '2', 'segments', 'Julian', 'Stevens', 'Producer', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Jakob', 'Verbruggen', 'Director', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'Pamela', 'Smith', 'Makeup', 'Hair', 'Designer', 'Tom', 'McCullough', 'Production', 'Designer', 'talk', 'show', 'characters', 'production', 'crew', 'shooting', 'show', 'Belfast', 'break', 'images', 'Troubles', 'years', 'past.All', 'episodes', 'featurette', 'are', 'close-captioned.FINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'season', 'far', 'too', 'brief', 'only', '5', 'episodes', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'interests', 'found', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'portrayal', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'One', 'minute', 'would', 'be', 'repulsed', 'actions', 'apparent', 'disconnection', 'morals', 'next', 'segment', ""'d"", 'be', 'watching', 'daughter', 'performing', 'cute', 'dance', 'routine', 'kissing', 'son', 'teddy', 'bear', 'good', 'night', ""'d"", 'think', 'Oh', 'so', 'sweet', 'wait', 'what', 'matter', 'Fall', 'represented', 'journey', 'one', 'end', 'comfort', 'zone', 'other', 'back', 'again', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'season', 'two.Highly', 'recommended']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

The series follows a PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) investigation, led by Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson), a Brit transfered to Belfast for the case after it remains open for 28 days. Under her new leadership, she leads the local detectives in their efforts to track down and stop the serial killer, Paul Spector, who is attacking young, professional women in the city of Belfast.""The Fall"" takes its time and allows its moody atmosphere to develop at an unrushed pace. it's not giving anything away to say that you know a lot about the person Stella Gibson is hunting early on. The show uses crime and violence as a framework to examine assumptions about class, sanity, and social hierarchies. It is mindful of how the media and often the public sort crime victims into two different categories; the true victims who deserve pity and the tramps who had it coming to them. Stella refuses to adhere to that mentality.Gillian Anderson is back in her biggest, and best role since ""The X-Files"", as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson in this new five-part thriller ""The Fall"", created for the BBC. She plays an unapologetic woman in her sexual prime; Stella is sexually confident and comfortable in her own skin. If she finds a man attractive, she doesn't hesitate to make the first move. She's much more feminine than agent Dana Scully ever was and she revels in it. She is also not above using it as an asset or a weapon (whichever way you chose to look at it), if she needs to do it.""The Fall"" recalls classic female protagonists. Stella doesn't apologize or explain herself. She is remote and chilly much of the time to those around her, and she clearly doesn't care what they think of her professional choices. Stella uses everything society vilifies women for using, her beauty and her intelligence. She has the ability to get results and that irks both her superiors and peers.""The Fall"" is ultimately the battle for supremacy between two hunters, a strong intelligent woman hunting a killer and misogynic killer hunting strong women who broke out of their defined role.

These shows are supposed to be dopy. If the main suspect calls the police, they are supposed to do an elaborate finger snapping and motion to indicate that they want to trace the call. If the suspect is talking on a burner, that should be accepted as a reason why the cops don't send squad cars to that location in order to grab the one lone guy talking on a cell phone about murder. Sure, all those phones have GPS tracking and the calls are traced the second the number is dialed, but sometimes you just must accept that cops on television shows are really stupid. If most of the investigative angles are ignored in favor of people standing around looking at pictures, then that's just what happens.The same goes for the weird subplot about the cop who gets shot dead in front of his house. The fact that his partner commits suicide from fear for his life and the shame of being caught sleeping with this dead partner's wife may not make much sense in terms of the cops that inhabit these shows or the streets, but you should go with it because maybe the Irish cops are really sensitive and sad cases.Depicting the killer as a family man who can totally hide in plain sight is another moron move. Most serial killers are weird shut-ins and even the ones who have personality like Ted Bundy give themselves away in subtle and important ways. Usually their friends chalk it up as ""there is something off"" about them. They do not just go to work and maintain families and then go off killing.Still, there are two points that keep the show from being forgiven for the standard sins. First, the show is relentlessly dour. The murderer and Gillian Anderson might as well be robots for all the emotion that they can muster in any scene (with apologies to Wall-E and C3PO) and while that's better than the woman police officer who is crying in the bathroom over all the murders (that happens with the doctor) it's still anemic. Second, the killer gets away. We slog through 5 episodes of this dour nonsense that pretends that it can make up for stupidity by having its characters talk as if everything is important and necessary, and then we don't even get the money shot of the killer going to jail?Overall, this is a stupid show and while that is not entirely a sin, its dourness keeps it from being as entertaining as it could be.",2,Stupid and Dour - a deadly combination,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,2841,"['can', 'get', 'spoiled', 'police', 'procedural', 'point', 'know', 'more', 'investigating', 'murder', 'scene', 'know', 'own', 'relatives', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'are', 'articles', 'coming', 'out', 'what', 'shows', 'get', 'wrong', 'Apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'social', 'security', 'number', 'address', 'psychological', 'profile', 'identity', 'suspect', 'hair', 'samples.In', 'context', 'little', 'unfair', 'judge', 'cop', 'show', 'based', 'expectations', 'previous', 'shows', 'knowledge', 'shows', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'dopy', 'main', 'suspect', 'police', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'elaborate', 'finger', 'snapping', 'motion', 'indicate', 'want', 'trace', 'call', 'suspect', 'talking', 'burner', 'should', 'be', 'accepted', 'reason', 'why', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'send', 'squad', 'cars', 'location', 'order', 'grab', 'one', 'lone', 'guy', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'murder', 'Sure', 'phones', 'have', 'GPS', 'tracking', 'calls', 'are', 'traced', 'second', 'number', 'dialed', 'sometimes', 'just', 'must', 'accept', 'cops', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'really', 'stupid', 'most', 'investigative', 'angles', 'are', 'ignored', 'favor', 'people', 'standing', 'looking', 'pictures', 'then', 'just', 'what', 'happens.The', 'same', 'weird', 'subplot', 'cop', 'who', 'shot', 'dead', 'front', 'house', 'fact', 'partner', 'commits', 'suicide', 'fear', 'life', 'shame', 'being', 'caught', 'sleeping', 'dead', 'partner', 'wife', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'terms', 'cops', 'inhabit', 'shows', 'streets', 'should', 'go', 'maybe', 'Irish', 'cops', 'are', 'really', 'sensitive', 'sad', 'cases.Depicting', 'killer', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'totally', 'hide', 'plain', 'sight', 'moron', 'move', 'Most', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'weird', 'shut-ins', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'personality', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'give', 'away', 'subtle', 'important', 'ways', 'Usually', 'friends', 'chalk', 'up', 'something', 'off', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'work', 'maintain', 'families', 'then', 'go', 'off', 'killing.Still', 'are', 'two', 'points', 'keep', 'show', 'being', 'forgiven', 'standard', 'sins', 'First', 'show', 'relentlessly', 'dour', 'murderer', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'robots', 'emotion', 'can', 'muster', 'scene', 'apologies', 'Wall-E', 'C3PO', 'better', 'woman', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'crying', 'bathroom', 'murders', 'doctor', 'still', 'anemic', 'Second', 'killer', 'away', 'slog', '5', 'episodes', 'dour', 'nonsense', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'stupidity', 'having', 'characters', 'talk', 'everything', 'important', 'necessary', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'money', 'shot', 'killer', 'going', 'jail', 'Overall', 'stupid', 'show', 'not', 'entirely', 'sin', 'dourness', 'keeps', 'being', 'as', 'entertaining', 'could', 'be']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

But we worry when he is alone with a 15 year old baby sitter who wants to be a temptress or with a grieving client who wants to be held.

1662088,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B00DW5IKN4,"VIDFAN ""specfellow""","[1, 1]","Why are the lives of serial killers all the rage this these days on TV?  Not long ago I reviewed the first season of ""Jack Taylor"", another BBC series in which the villain, was, alas, a serial killer. In the U.S., there's ""The Following"" (Kevin Bacon) and of course, the highly popular ""Dexter.""Now here's ""The Fall"" with the sexy and charismatic Gillian Anderson of ""X-Files"" fame.She's the best thing about this show, which introduces her character in the context of a crime investigation of a serial killer who first mocks his unwitting victims' single lifestyles before actually showing up and doing his dastardly deeds. The show is well-shot, technically accomplished, and held my attention throughout.  There is an undeniable tension and the acting was excellent. So why only three stars?Read on.My biggest beef about the first season of this show is how much airtime is spent on the character of the killer, Paul Spector (an homage to murderer and musician Phil Spector, perhaps?). Yes, we know serial killers (like Ted Bundy) can be good at acting like ""one of us"" but the idea that a serial killer can not only be outwardly charming but also great at his job as a counselor (a job that requires evident empathy and sensitivity) as well as have a stable marriage and family really stretched my credibility.You don't have to be a psychologist to know that most serial killers tend to be loners, have poor social skills and work in low-stress, undemanding occupations that don't require much thinking or feeling (i.e, Dahmer worked in a chocolate factory).  They'd rather torture small animals than kiss their kids goodnight. Thanks to the success of ""Dexter"" however, the latest TV trend now is to romanticize them, as if being a serial killer was a ""lifestyle choice"", one somehow worthy of understanding and respect, rather than seeing the person as the personification of evil we want to keep our distance from. Even ""Silence of the Lambs"" didn't waste time showing us how ""normal"" Hannibal Lector could be - most of the film was about Jodie Foster and her investigation. Hannibal was to be avoided, not seen as John Q. Public as this show seems to encourage viewers to do.Now, some might argue that the point of humanizing the killer is to lessen our distance from him, as if to say, ""we all could be him, we all could be murderers.""  I disagree. Just like we all can't be brain surgeons, not everyone has it in him/her to be Hitler, Jack the Ripper or Bluebeard.I confess I lost interest every time Gillian wasn't on the screen.  Yes, the show kept me guessing but the storyline is so subtly misogynist I was tempted to give up watching several times. While other reviewers have characterized Anderson's character as a female version of the stereotypical male detective (she's cold, aloof, picking up dates only to drop them after one night), I feel there's a subtle anti-feminist message by pairing an independent woman detective with a ""lovable"" serial killer who just happens to murder only well-off, well-educated and happily independent females. None of the victims are prostitutes or poor, as was the case with Jack the Ripper, Dahmer, or Bundy.The show is entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying. If the show's writers get rid of the serial killer by season 2, I'd be more interested in watching the series. Hopefully future episodes will deal more with Gilliam's character and feature a more original storyline than this one.",3,"Lose the Serial Killer, Keep Gillian, and I""ll Keep Watching",1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,3446,"['Why', 'are', 'lives', 'serial', 'killers', 'rage', 'days', 'TV', 'Not', 'long', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'first', 'season', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'BBC', 'series', 'villain', 'was', 'alas', 'serial', 'killer', 'U.S.', 'Following', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'course', 'highly', 'popular', 'Dexter', 'Now', 'here', 'Fall', 'sexy', 'charismatic', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'X-Files', 'fame.She', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'character', 'context', 'crime', 'investigation', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'first', 'unwitting', 'victims', 'single', 'lifestyles', 'actually', 'showing', 'up', 'doing', 'dastardly', 'deeds', 'show', 'well-shot', 'technically', 'accomplished', 'held', 'attention', 'undeniable', 'tension', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'So', 'why', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'Read', 'biggest', 'beef', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'airtime', 'spent', 'character', 'killer', 'Paul', 'Spector', 'homage', 'murderer', 'musician', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'perhaps', 'Yes', 'know', 'serial', 'killers', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'acting', 'one', 'idea', 'serial', 'killer', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'outwardly', 'charming', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'counselor', 'job', 'evident', 'empathy', 'sensitivity', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'stable', 'marriage', 'family', 'really', 'stretched', 'credibility.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'psychologist', 'know', 'most', 'serial', 'killers', 'tend', 'be', 'loners', 'have', 'poor', 'social', 'skills', 'work', 'low-stress', 'undemanding', 'occupations', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'i.e', 'Dahmer', 'worked', 'chocolate', 'factory', ""'d"", 'rather', 'torture', 'small', 'animals', 'kiss', 'kids', 'goodnight', 'Thanks', 'success', 'Dexter', 'however', 'latest', 'TV', 'trend', 'now', 'romanticize', 'being', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'lifestyle', 'choice', 'one', 'somehow', 'worthy', 'understanding', 'respect', 'rather', 'seeing', 'person', 'personification', 'evil', 'want', 'keep', 'distance', 'Even', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'showing', 'how', 'normal', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'investigation', 'Hannibal', 'was', 'be', 'avoided', 'not', 'seen', 'John', 'Q', 'Public', 'show', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'do.Now', 'might', 'argue', 'point', 'humanizing', 'killer', 'lessen', 'distance', 'say', 'could', 'be', 'could', 'be', 'murderers', 'disagree', 'Just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'brain', 'surgeons', 'not', 'everyone', 'him/her', 'be', 'Hitler', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Bluebeard.I', 'confess', 'lost', 'interest', 'time', 'Gillian', 'was', ""n't"", 'screen', 'Yes', 'show', 'kept', 'guessing', 'storyline', 'so', 'subtly', 'misogynist', 'was', 'tempted', 'give', 'up', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'characterized', 'Anderson', 'character', 'female', 'version', 'stereotypical', 'male', 'detective', 'cold', 'aloof', 'picking', 'up', 'dates', 'only', 'drop', 'one', 'night', 'feel', 'subtle', 'anti-feminist', 'message', 'pairing', 'independent', 'woman', 'detective', 'lovable', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'just', 'murder', 'only', 'well-off', 'well-educated', 'happily', 'independent', 'females', 'None', 'victims', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'poor', 'was', 'case', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Dahmer', 'Bundy.The', 'show', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'show', 'writers', 'get', 'rid', 'serial', 'killer', 'season', '2', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'watching', 'series', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'episodes', 'will', 'deal', 'more', 'Gilliam', 'character', 'feature', 'more', 'original', 'storyline', 'one']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"

1662090,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00DW5IKN4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","A slow burning thriller, ""The Fall"" is primarily a character driven series focusing on the pursuit of a serial killer who stalks his victims by breaking in to their homes and leaving behind ""warning"" signs to increase the thrill and cool, detached detective Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) assigned to the case. Gibson enjoys casual sex (often with married men) and often ""stalks"" those that she chooses as one night stand partners based on a whim acting very much as a mirror for the killer (Jamie Dornan) who works as a grief counselor feeding off the tragedies of others.I should warn viewers that this ends on a cliffhanger which will resolved with the second series. Those into a more conventional narrative and conclusion may be disappointed.While starting off as fairly conventional, the series begins to take some interesting and unexpected turns for those patient enough to stay with the series past the first episode. A well written and directed series, ""The Fall"" takes its cue from well structured novels gradually connecting these two telling the parallel stories that eventually intersect against the tragic and violent background of Northern Ireland.Anderson gives a subtle, well controlled and nuanced performance and enjoys strong support from a mixture of British and Irish acting veterans including ""The Good Wife"" actress Archie Panjabi. Dornan provides a nice contrast as a killer who masquerades as someone who helps others through their grief while also maintaining the facade of a loving family man with two of his own children.The gritty, dark presentation (the show was shot digitally) compliments the atmosphere of the series and the Dolby 5.1 mix is subtle through out (if you watch this streaming it is presented with a nice sounding stereo mix as well).The special feature for the DVD from Acorn Entertainment is, as with most of their releases, limited to a single featurette. This one runs about 12 minutes. It would have been nice to have a commentary track from Anderson, Dornan or the series creator/writer/producer Allan Cubitt (who wrote the second s dries for ""Prime Suspect"").Although it takes a little while for ""The Fall"" to find its footing, once the series does midway through the second episode, the series rarely stumbles and will provide those willing to stock with this 5 episode series with a fascinating experience.",4,"""The Fall"" may take a bit to find its footing but once it does this character driven thriller rarely stumbles.",1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,2365,"['slow', 'burning', 'thriller', 'Fall', 'primarily', 'character', 'driven', 'series', 'focusing', 'pursuit', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'breaking', 'homes', 'leaving', 'warning', 'signs', 'increase', 'thrill', 'cool', 'detached', 'detective', 'Stella', 'Gibson', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'assigned', 'case', 'Gibson', 'casual', 'sex', 'often', 'married', 'men', 'often', 'stalks', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'partners', 'based', 'whim', 'acting', 'very', 'much', 'mirror', 'killer', 'Jamie', 'Dornan', 'who', 'grief', 'counselor', 'feeding', 'off', 'tragedies', 'others.I', 'should', 'warn', 'viewers', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'resolved', 'second', 'series', 'more', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.While', 'starting', 'off', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'series', 'take', 'interesting', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'patient', 'enough', 'stay', 'series', 'first', 'episode', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'series', 'Fall', 'cue', 'well', 'structured', 'novels', 'gradually', 'connecting', 'two', 'telling', 'parallel', 'stories', 'eventually', 'intersect', 'tragic', 'violent', 'background', 'Northern', 'Ireland.Anderson', 'subtle', 'well', 'controlled', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'strong', 'support', 'mixture', 'British', 'Irish', 'acting', 'veterans', 'including', 'Good', 'Wife', 'actress', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'Dornan', 'nice', 'contrast', 'killer', 'who', 'someone', 'who', 'others', 'grief', 'also', 'maintaining', 'facade', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'two', 'own', 'children.The', 'gritty', 'dark', 'presentation', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'digitally', 'atmosphere', 'series', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'mix', 'subtle', 'out', 'watch', 'streaming', 'presented', 'nice', 'sounding', 'stereo', 'mix', 'well', '.The', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Acorn', 'Entertainment', 'most', 'releases', 'limited', 'single', 'featurette', 'one', '12', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'Anderson', 'Dornan', 'series', 'creator/writer/producer', 'Allan', 'Cubitt', 'who', 'wrote', 'second', 's', 'dries', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'little', 'while', 'Fall', 'find', 'footing', 'once', 'series', 'midway', 'second', 'episode', 'series', 'rarely', 'stumbles', 'will', 'provide', 'willing', 'stock', '5', 'episode', 'series', 'fascinating', 'experience']","THE FALL, SERIES 1"
