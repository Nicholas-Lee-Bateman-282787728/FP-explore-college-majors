It is actually on my top five list of favorite movies. This movie is definitely not for everyone. I myself, found the movie EXTREMELY entertaining and funny. This was actually the very first independent film I ever saw and it got me into the whole Indie scene way back in the day.What's up buttercup? The rent and I'm not paying.. NA-TASH-A!The ""imitate a cat puking"" part makes me laugh to this day! Parker Posey is very very talented ... along with the other members of the cast.A trained monkey learned this system on PBS in a matter of hours! Re-coat it!The character Posey plays in the movie, Mary, wants to be a librarian and make something of herself. Granted, she is also a Party Girl, so this makes for some interesting scenarios in the movie. I would give this movie 10 stars if I could. Maybe I'm just partial to it because it was the first non-mainstream/non-Hollywood UNIQUE movie I ever saw and it broadened my horizons, but, who knows, maybe you will like it too. ;)I want to be a librarian!(I also highly recommend the soundtrack to the movie.)",5,I'll have a falafel with hot sauce...,1006905600,"11 28, 2001",2001,1213,"['side', 'order', 'babaganouj', 'seltzer', 'please.Ok', 'have', 'seen', 'Party', 'Girl', 'more', 'times', 'other', 'movie', ""'re"", 'talking', 'hundreds', 'times', 'here', 'actually', 'top', 'five', 'list', 'favorite', 'movies', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'found', 'movie', 'EXTREMELY', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'first', 'independent', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'got', 'whole', 'Indie', 'scene', 'way', 'back', 'day.What', 'up', 'buttercup', 'rent', ""'m"", 'not', 'paying..', 'NA-TASH-A', 'imitate', 'cat', 'puking', 'part', 'day', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'very', 'very', 'talented', 'other', 'members', 'cast.A', 'trained', 'monkey', 'learned', 'system', 'PBS', 'matter', 'hours', 'Re-coat', 'character', 'Posey', 'movie', 'Mary', 'be', 'librarian', 'make', 'something', 'herself', 'Granted', 'also', 'Party', 'Girl', 'interesting', 'scenarios', 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '10', 'stars', 'could', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'partial', 'was', 'first', 'non-mainstream/non-Hollywood', 'UNIQUE', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'broadened', 'horizons', 'who', 'maybe', 'will', 'like', 'too', 'want', 'be', 'librarian', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'soundtrack', 'movie']",Party Girl VHS

I had seen Posey in &quot;The House of Yes&quot; and didn't like the film, but liked her. The film has great music and a good back drop of the club scene between drugs, fashion-tinged clothing, and club kids. I was not familiar with Omar Townshend, but he is believable as the Lebanese falafel vendor that Posey gets involved with. This is a light, enjoyable flick and of the variety that romantic comedies should be: sweet, intelligent, and with a happy ending.

Posey's obviously natural state of perpetual twitchiness is put to good use in the role of librarian by day, party animal by night. (Naming the character &quot;Mary&quot; is an obvious goof on &quot;Marian the Librarian&quot;.)The scene where a drunken Mary breaks into the library after hours, bound and determined to master the Dewey Decimal System by dawn is quite a howl. On a sliding scale of similar New York Downtown Scene films, with &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; at the top and the dismal &quot;Slaves Of New York&quot; at the bottom, this one falls somewhere in the middle.

391177,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,6303947875,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[3, 3]","This film is a delightful, light hearted look at both sides of where the ""club kid"" rave scene blends with the New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo by the omnipresent Miss Bunny).  This is ""Torch Song Trilogy"" for the perky-post-teen girls.  ""That Girl"" for our disaffected, affected millenium times.The dialogue is fast and funny, and Parker Posey's costumer deserves - if not an academy award, at least - a stadium ""wave"" of kudos.Of course, this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss Posey, and she is perfectly cast.  Like a lot of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey... but it all WORKS.  She is an entertainer, and this film entertains, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it drop to the floor.Mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing desinger clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend.  On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care-less in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that caring is neccessary to life.The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the Aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two... but... hey... this is comedy.  The best performance is by the fallafel selling boyfriend.  We should all be so lucky.I rate this as a 4 because it isn't a great moment of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing).

I didn't know anything of the film until last year, and totally got the reason why it was revered as a cult classic among those with brains and a sense of humor.The great thing about this movie is the leading lady, Parker Posey. Anyone who doesnt crack up the moment she opens her mouth has obviously had a seriously deprived childhood. Among all contemporary actresses, theres not one that has the instinctive comic likeability and timing that Posey has. Well, maybe Lisa Kudrow, but shes busy wasting away her life on 'Friends'.Parker plays Mary, a Party Girl to reckon with ('I'm a girl who parties like a man', the film's soundtrack tells us). However, with bills to pay and the feeling of self-worth to satisfy, Mary falls at the feet of her godmother, who gives her a job at the library. While the film itself is irreverent, the wondrous job it extracts from its' leading cast is superb. Parker's Middle Eastern lover, her gay best friend, and her English DJ room-mate, all spicen up the proceedings, as Mary works her way through this thing called life, only to discover that the only thing that really matters is the ability to party the best you can.Aside from spouting some of the most unfortgettable one-liners, Parker's sullen performance as a librarian, and her transformation into a care-a-hang nightlife girl is extremely watchable. I personally preferred her performance here to the more respected one she gave in the dark 'The House of Yes'. Its also far better and substantial than the one she gave us in 'Henry Fool'.The film also has a stunning soundtrack. The only pity is that it is not yet available on DVD.

391184,A38EDDASAM1W0V,6303947875,M. Cookson,"[3, 7]","Mary wants nothing more out of life than to party 'til she drops.  Unfortunately, she lands herself in jail and needs her godmother's help for the bail.  However, she draws the line at giving Mary more money, and a penniless Mary finds herself agreeing to work at the same library her godmother works at.  For a while, Mary exists as a Party Girl at night and a librarian by day.  None of her friends see her as anything other than the Party Girl, and it's only after she starts working at the library that she starts to see herself as someone with a future.Granted, this movie definitely has problems.  The romance with the falafel salesman is weak, and it's not exactly a subtle movie.  Mary and her friends can be absolutely clueless (everyone's mentioned the ""Imitate a cat puking"" bit, but I'll mention it again - I discovered that it was possible to laugh and cringe at the same time).  As someone who works in the library, however, I have to say that some of the library humor is really fabulous.  I can't count how many times I've wanted to do what Mary did and give the people who reshelve things just anywhere a piece of my mind.  All the librarians I know who've seen this movie have loved it, so, if you work at a library, I would definitely suggest seeing this.
