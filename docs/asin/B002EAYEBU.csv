Rod Steiger give an emotional and powerful performance and John Phillip Law's innocent, country like young soldier holds true to characterization.

1265074,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B002EAYEBU,Kasey G,"[7, 8]","Not available in stores is this Manufacture-on-Demand release from the WB Archives program of 1968's ""The Sergeant"" starring Rod Steiger. While some may find the price steep for a bare-bones DVD release, your best bet is to check Warner's website daily for One Day Sales like I did. Persistence does pay off.The story revolves around Rod Steiger as a decorated G.I. with over a quarter-century service. In the prologue, set in WWII, we see him commit a heroic act during an attack in France and kill one of the enemy with his bare hands.Flash-forward to 1952 and Steiger returns to France to whip a lax company into shape. The ineffectual Captain is more than happy to let Steiger take over. Almost immediately, Steiger takes an interest in lanky recruit John Philip Law. He makes short work of convincing Law to take a clerical job so as to keep the object of his desire close. Slowly but increasingly, Law learns that the freedom and perks that come with being the Sergeant's ""pet"" come with a price.The movie held my interest for all of its near two-hour running time. Steiger is fantastic in the title role but I wish that someone other than Law had been cast as the object of lust. A more traditionally handsome and rugged actor like Van Williams or Gary Lockwood would have made a much better casting choice and been more believable. Perhaps the producers found Law's tall, lean physique a good contrast to the portly Steiger. Since the movie depends on the chemistry and relationship between their two characters, a stronger actor in Law's role would have made for an even better picture.The film apparently flopped upon its release due to the ""uncomfortable"" subject matter, but it has aged well. Though it supposedly takes place in 1952, the bar scenes find all the extras dressed in contemporary 1968 garb. Speaking of which, one such bar scene features a Freudian touch when the closeted Steiger is debating with the Francophones about the virtues of the American hot dog!The widescreen print does suffer from a few blemishes, dirt and specks, but I have seen official DVD releases of vintage films that have looked no better.Must-see viewing for those interested in vintage '60s gay-themed cinema such as ""Boys in the Band"" or ""Reflections in a Golden Eye"".",4,Worth Viewing For Steiger's Performance Alone,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,2269,"['Not', 'available', 'stores', 'Manufacture-on-Demand', 'release', 'WB', 'Archives', 'program', '1968', 'Sergeant', 'starring', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'may', 'find', 'price', 'steep', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'release', 'best', 'bet', 'check', 'Warner', 'website', 'daily', 'One', 'Day', 'Sales', 'did', 'Persistence', 'pay', 'off.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'decorated', 'G.I', 'quarter-century', 'service', 'prologue', 'set', 'WWII', 'see', 'commit', 'heroic', 'act', 'attack', 'France', 'kill', 'one', 'enemy', 'bare', 'hands.Flash-forward', '1952', 'Steiger', 'returns', 'France', 'whip', 'lax', 'company', 'shape', 'ineffectual', 'Captain', 'more', 'happy', 'let', 'Steiger', 'take', 'over', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'Steiger', 'interest', 'lanky', 'recruit', 'John', 'Philip', 'Law', 'short', 'work', 'convincing', 'Law', 'take', 'clerical', 'job', 'so', 'keep', 'object', 'desire', 'close', 'Slowly', 'increasingly', 'Law', 'freedom', 'perks', 'come', 'being', 'Sergeant', 'pet', 'come', 'price.The', 'movie', 'held', 'interest', 'near', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'Steiger', 'fantastic', 'title', 'role', 'wish', 'someone', 'other', 'Law', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'object', 'lust', 'more', 'traditionally', 'handsome', 'rugged', 'actor', 'Van', 'Williams', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'casting', 'choice', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'found', 'Law', 'tall', 'lean', 'physique', 'good', 'contrast', 'portly', 'Steiger', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'stronger', 'actor', 'Law', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'picture.The', 'film', 'apparently', 'flopped', 'release', 'due', 'uncomfortable', 'subject', 'matter', 'aged', 'well', 'supposedly', 'place', '1952', 'bar', 'scenes', 'find', 'extras', 'dressed', 'contemporary', '1968', 'garb', 'Speaking', 'one', 'such', 'bar', 'scene', 'Freudian', 'touch', 'when', 'closeted', 'Steiger', 'debating', 'Francophones', 'virtues', 'American', 'hot', 'dog', 'widescreen', 'print', 'suffer', 'few', 'blemishes', 'dirt', 'specks', 'have', 'seen', 'official', 'DVD', 'releases', 'vintage', 'films', 'have', 'looked', 'better.Must-see', 'viewing', 'interested', 'vintage', 'gay-themed', 'cinema', 'such', 'Boys', 'Band', 'Reflections', 'Golden', 'Eye']",The Sergeant
