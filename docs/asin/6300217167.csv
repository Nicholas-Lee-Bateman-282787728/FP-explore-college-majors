I understand she was a supporting actor;  But the support she gave in this film is ""Thelma at her BEST"".This movie should have been released on some kind of home media years ago. It's incredible it still isn't on VHS or DVD to this day!!!Thank you Amazon for making this movie available for instant viewing - so that I don't have to wait to see it on TMC.  There is a list of other enjoyable films I would like to see added to the Instant Viewing Library; Perhaps Amazon will consider adding a forum for this type of viewing requests if there is not one already.  And if there is one, where can I find it on the website?Thanks Amazon for all that you do.

223936,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,6300217167,Brian,"[3, 3]","This forgotten romantic comedy from Paramount, 1951, is a small treasure.  Filled with clever dialogue, unexpectedly textured performances and familiar-yet-fresh domestic chaos, 'The Mating Season' (don't let the stale-sounding title fool you) is a pleasant piece of '50s marital-mixup fun with a strong dose of rapid-fire '40s screwball sensibility.  While I could easily say that the always wonderful Thelma Ritter steals the show, truth is the admirably equitable screenplay (adapted by big pens Charles Bracket, Walter Reisch and Richard Breen from the play 'Maggie') sees to it that all players get their due representation.  Beautiful (though sometimes glass-eyed) Gene Tierney is surprisingly agile in her role as the noble-hearted but genetically snobbish bride/daughter; B-lister John Lund is appealing and appropriately reactive as the anxious, plain-principled groom/son; and supporting stalwarts the likes of Miriam Hopkins, Larry Keating, Jan Sterling, Ellen Corby, Billie Bird, etc., round out the cast with the perfect touches of weight and humor; all efficiently directed by Mitchell Leisen ('Easy Living,' 'Midnight').

223946,A42QN9MM6LKKM,6300217167,Lee in S.F.,"[10, 10]","What a find this movie was!  The story line is timeless: do we choose those close to us based on social class, or do we choose people based on who they are and how we feel about life when we're with them? How the movie answers this question kept my attention the entire time, such that I didn't want this to end.Thelma Ritter plays the lead male's mother.  I had a prior impression of her as being too brash for my tastes.  In this movie, however, she showed the scope of her acting skills, and I was impressed!  (No wonder she won the Academy Award for best supporting actress.) Yes, she can and did play brash, but here she also expresses a diverse range of behaviors and emotions.Gene Tierney was someone I was unfamiliar with before seeing this video, and initially, I was worried that she'd end up being just a two-dimensional doll.  Not true, as she hit just the right notes of graciousness, warmth, sincerity, and big-heartedness in her role as the ambassador's daughter.  Her screen husband, also a hunk, was not a disappointment, either, delivering a surprisingly nuanced interpretation of his role as her husband (and Thelma Ritter's screen son).  As for two-dimensional characters, this is a comedy, and so some just have to be included!  In this regard, Tierney's screen mother was presented as a narcissistic shrew, and we saw the boss's son as a superficial, sleazy schemer.  Both created essential plot tension, and did great jobs at being villainous.The story line took viewers on a twisting, turning ride, keeping me glued to the screen.  Moreover, the witty writing was delicious!  It had a quality seldom seen in modern films (which I say with resignation--because regarding current offerings, I'd trade all the special effects in the world for well-written scripts like this one!).This movie delivers so much heart and decency that you'll leave it uplifted.  OK, perhaps the finale was just a little too good to be true.  (It'd be amazing if real life always concluded so well!)  Even so, by then you've genuinely come to care about the main characters, such that it's easy to smile at the wrap-up.
