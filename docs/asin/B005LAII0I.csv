The evil queen is still jealous and obsessed with being the fairest in the land.  Snow White is still sweet and innocent, although a bit tougher than the traditional princess.

To me, the draw of the film isn't so much that it's a version of Snow White, but rather that it's a quirky re-telling of a fairy tale. There is just enough humor and just enough odd scenes that it keeps your attention. Even the settings are kind of strange. They are a mix of medieval and fantasy. Nathan Lane and Julia Roberts make for a very engaging and comical pairing. The seven dwarfs are played by well-known short actors and are very quirky but funny. This movie seems like it will delve into some cruel or violent scenes, but somehow it manages to always pull back enough not to spoil things.

1478304,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAII0I,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","At the beginning of the year we were teased with the prospect of two vastly different live action interpretations of the `Snow White' fairytale.  First released with the family oriented `Mirror Mirror', which looked to take a campy comedic approach and starred the rather washed up (yes, she's a 90's actress who has failed to deliver since her Oscar twelve years ago) Julia Roberts.  The second, which was to be released more in line with awards season, was the dark and fantastical looking `Snow White and the Huntsman' starring the world's favorite celebrity, Charlize Theron.I was holding out for the `Huntsman'.Sadly, the stars did not align for me and I had a pretty terrible month with stress filled work environment and sick children and so I never got around to seeing Theron scream her way to victory.  The reviews weren't kind anyways, so waiting for it to be released on DVD isn't that big of a deal, I guess.  My daughter happened to see a commercial for the DVD release of `Mirror Mirror' though, and she was spellbound.  She had to see it and so I buckled and rented it.  I really wasn't expecting much at all, and sadly, I didn't get much either.Good lord this movie is stupid.I understand that alterations need to be made to bring this classic story into the modern era.  No, this is a `modern interpretation' but what I mean is that to appeal to modern audiences they felt it necessary to alter aspects of the film.  Sadly, many of the alterations just don't work, and it wound up feeling silly for silly's sake.  The dialog is stilted and unfunny and no one can really deliver them with authority outside of Julia Roberts who is actually really funny here, especially towards the end of the film.  The rest of the acting is a sore spot, with the dead-eyed dull spirit known as Lily Collins completely ruining this film, and the adorable Armie Hammer embarrassing himself in more ways than one.  The dwarfs, all of them, are terrible actors and the alterations made to their characters were ridiculous, from the names (I wanted to punch the television) to their stilts.Visually, the film is appealing.  The sets and those costumes are delicious, but overall this is just a massive failure.  Tarsem has a track record of creating visually appealing films that don't quite fill in the other areas, but `Mirror Mirror' is his biggest misstep.  At the end of the day, the film is just dull.",2,What's the dullest movie of them all?,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2404,"['beginning', 'year', 'were', 'teased', 'prospect', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'live', 'action', 'interpretations', 'Snow', 'White', 'fairytale', 'First', 'released', 'family', 'oriented', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'looked', 'take', 'campy', 'comedic', 'approach', 'starred', 'rather', 'washed', 'up', 'yes', '90', 'actress', 'who', 'failed', 'deliver', 'Oscar', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'second', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'more', 'line', 'awards', 'season', 'was', 'dark', 'fantastical', 'looking', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'starring', 'world', 'favorite', 'celebrity', 'Charlize', 'Theron.I', 'was', 'holding', 'out', ""Huntsman'.Sadly"", 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'align', 'had', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'month', 'stress', 'filled', 'work', 'environment', 'sick', 'children', 'so', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'Theron', 'scream', 'way', 'victory', 'reviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'kind', 'anyways', 'so', 'waiting', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'guess', 'daughter', 'happened', 'see', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'release', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'though', 'was', 'spellbound', 'had', 'see', 'so', 'buckled', 'rented', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'either.Good', 'lord', 'movie', 'stupid.I', 'understand', 'alterations', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'bring', 'classic', 'story', 'modern', 'era', 'No', 'modern', 'interpretation', 'what', 'mean', 'appeal', 'modern', 'audiences', 'felt', 'necessary', 'alter', 'aspects', 'film', 'Sadly', 'many', 'alterations', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'wound', 'up', 'feeling', 'silly', 'silly', 'sake', 'dialog', 'stilted', 'unfunny', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'deliver', 'authority', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'actually', 'really', 'funny', 'here', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'rest', 'acting', 'sore', 'spot', 'dead-eyed', 'dull', 'spirit', 'known', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'completely', 'ruining', 'film', 'adorable', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'embarrassing', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'dwarfs', 'are', 'terrible', 'actors', 'alterations', 'made', 'characters', 'were', 'ridiculous', 'names', 'wanted', 'punch', 'television', 'stilts.Visually', 'film', 'appealing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'delicious', 'overall', 'just', 'massive', 'failure', 'Tarsem', 'track', 'record', 'creating', 'visually', 'appealing', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fill', 'other', 'areas', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'biggest', 'misstep', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'just', 'dull']",Mirror Mirror

A quick synopsis for those who were able to avoid the story or been indoctrinated by Disney. The King becomes a father. The wife dies in childbirth. By accident or by design the king marries a witchy woman. She's so vain she thinks this story is about her doesn't she? Naturally the daughter Snow White (Lily Collins) outshines the Queen and must be dispatched. The tale contains a prince that cannot stay clothed, giant dwarfs, and an evil beast of the forest.In one scene Nathan Lane is turned into a cockroach. I thought it was a jab at Franz Kafka.They tried too hard to be cutesy. I must say the absence of animation or songs was refreshing. As usual Julia Roberts made a nice witchy woman.

The costumes reminded me of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Marie Antionette type costumes but still having originality. You could tell that all the actors enjoyed their roles! Julia Roberts and Lily Collins shined as The Evil Queen and Snow White! I can't wait to see Lily Collins as Clary Fray in the Mortal Instruments movie based on the book series. I think the best actors are the ones who enjoy acting and being the characters they were given rather than just doing it for the money. I also loved that this film was a comedy and it didn't take itself too seriously. I also loved the magic mirror now that was different where you go inside the mirror and go into this alternate world.

The Dwarfs -- each one proving to be a skilled comic actor -- easily run off with huge chunks of their scenes.This is not inappropriate for family viewing by any stretch, but this caters to a higher sense of humor. It's Grimm Grows Up, and I'd rank this as palatable and a very pleasant choice for a popcorn-and-comedy night at home.The film loses one star in my rating for overuse of the mountain of gold fabric that was obviously bought in bulk, a swatch or several yards of which were shoe-horned (""Blue Ball Gown?

1478343,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAII0I,Chris Kennison,"[1, 4]","""Mirror Mirror"" is ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in an alternate universe. The creators have taken many liberties with the story that we all grew up with and are familiar with. Snow White (Lily Collins) lives in the castle with the Queen (Julia Roberts) because her father, the King, has disappeared in the woods and has been gone for years. There is a mirror and there is an apple and there are seven dwarfs, but the story isn't the same and most notably, the Dwarfs aren't named Dopey, Doc, Sleepy etc. etc. They are given new names like Napoleon, Half Pint, Grub, Butcher, Chuckles, Grimm and Wolf.""Mirror Mirror"" is a light-hearted movie that can be enjoyed by all members of the family and that is the best part about it. While Julia Roberts' Evil Queen is certainly evil, vain, self-centered and short sighted, she does so with wit and charm that is more like a pampered New York Socialite than the devilish queen we're familiar with. Snow White is the subject of that thing that happens once or twice a year where dueling movie studios both had the same idea and see who's film does better. For a more twisted and devilish taste of Snow White, you'll have to wait for ""Snow White and the Huntsmen"" slated for June with Twilight's Kristen Stewart.This version is creative and refreshing but unfortunately hampered with comedy that doesn't really make you laugh all that much, although the dwarves did make me laugh a few times. The story is creative but really doesn't have a whole lot of meat to it or make you feel like there is anything vital at stake. The Queen's stranglehold on the community around her isn't felt enough. Snow White's relationship with the dwarves grows too quickly and we never get a chance to feel it.Ultimately, despite all the big name stars in the film, the production seemed sort of cheap and the script lacked flair. The movie is mostly a combination of ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Ella Enchanted"" but doesn't capture either one of those films magic. It tries to and it definitely has its moments, but ""Mirror Mirror"" sort of falls flat. The only magic is that they managed to cast the perfect people, but still weren't able to gel the story into something that made you feel anything about what was happening on screen.",3,Boring script that misses lots of opportunities,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2258,"['Mirror', 'Mirror', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'alternate', 'universe', 'creators', 'have', 'taken', 'many', 'liberties', 'story', 'grew', 'up', 'are', 'familiar', 'Snow', 'White', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'castle', 'Queen', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'father', 'King', 'disappeared', 'woods', 'been', 'gone', 'years', 'mirror', 'apple', 'are', 'seven', 'dwarfs', 'story', ""n't"", 'same', 'most', 'notably', 'Dwarfs', 'are', ""n't"", 'named', 'Dopey', 'Doc', 'Sleepy', 'etc', 'etc', 'are', 'given', 'new', 'names', 'Napoleon', 'Half', 'Pint', 'Grub', 'Butcher', 'Chuckles', 'Grimm', 'Wolf', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'light-hearted', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'members', 'family', 'best', 'part', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'certainly', 'evil', 'vain', 'self-centered', 'short', 'sighted', 'so', 'wit', 'charm', 'more', 'pampered', 'New', 'York', 'Socialite', 'devilish', 'queen', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Snow', 'White', 'subject', 'thing', 'once', 'twice', 'year', 'where', 'dueling', 'movie', 'studios', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'see', 'who', 'film', 'better', 'more', 'twisted', 'devilish', 'taste', 'Snow', 'White', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsmen', 'slated', 'June', 'Twilight', 'Kristen', 'Stewart.This', 'version', 'creative', 'refreshing', 'unfortunately', 'hampered', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'dwarves', 'did', 'make', 'few', 'times', 'story', 'creative', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'meat', 'make', 'feel', 'anything', 'vital', 'stake', 'Queen', 'stranglehold', 'community', ""n't"", 'felt', 'enough', 'Snow', 'White', 'relationship', 'dwarves', 'grows', 'too', 'quickly', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'feel', 'it.Ultimately', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'film', 'production', 'seemed', 'sort', 'cheap', 'script', 'lacked', 'flair', 'movie', 'mostly', 'combination', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', ""n't"", 'capture', 'one', 'films', 'magic', 'definitely', 'moments', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'sort', 'falls', 'flat', 'only', 'magic', 'managed', 'cast', 'perfect', 'people', 'still', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'gel', 'story', 'something', 'made', 'feel', 'anything', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen']",Mirror Mirror

I was truly happiest in the noted characters (more about that later) with Julia Robert's part in the telling of the Evil Queen - but that was about it. Nathan Lane? You must have been paid well. Prince Charming - Arnie Hammmer's best scene was when under a spell from said evil queen, behaving as a dog...a puppy, to be exact. Let's face it, it isn't as though he needs the money, is it? Lily whoever the heck she is as Snow White really needed her eyebrows plucked - I mean REALLY - and even hairier, her character took nearly identical ideas and scenes from Once Upon a Time on ABC. The Seven Dwarfs were by far the best actors and entertainers of all however, keeping closest to the original tale characters, and kept me watching the darn movie...yet these incredible actors received so very little accolades it was sad and downright wrong. Grimm's Fairy Tales are all melded with horror, intended to be so, and this? Well, I'm sorry I bought it. Actually bought this nonsense, yes, I admit it. According to Bollywood-style, there was, of course, a dancing/singing piece at the end after Snow White did NOT eat the poison apple! Who thought of THAT anyway? I literally forced my endurance of a piece of the ending which was, of course, the singing dancing happy happy joy joy Bollywood junk. Arnie? You have two or three left feet, but you're nice to look at in the scenes that took advantage of your chest hair. The storyline is not at all like the original, though it could have been enjoyable, had it had any merit of course - which it doesn't. Sadly looking at my wallet having been plucked by this awful film, I look forward to Snow White and the Huntsman to purchase - hmmm, perhaps rent, as well as continuing to watch Once Upon a Time and Grimm - both (almost) free on HULU.

At this point, I don't think anyone can argue that there is a glut of fairy tale projects.  I already had my fill when this one came along.  The nicest thing I can say about this film is that it is exceedingly beautiful.  They definitely paid a pretty price to make it so lovely.  The darn thing practically blinds it's that sparkly.  Unfortunately, you can only stare at a bauble for just so long before boredom overtakes and attention begins to lag.  Bedazzled or not, I blame the writers for making such an ageless story so dimwitted.  (For a second there I fully expected Rocky and Bullwinkle to show up, surely this was a lost episode of Fractured Fairy Tales!)  To suggest their spin was a tad dopey doesn't give them nearly credit enough.  The dialog was in turns coy then juvenile.  They needed much more than pretty props to pull this off.  Slapping Julia Roberts into the feature was simply not enough (a meaner person might say she was more of a hindrance than any help).

Julia Roberts as the evil queen does an okay job, but isn't really given much to do other than look irritated for most of the film. The dwarfs were fun and provided little quips that gave them a little more edge than what we've seen in previous adaptations.

1478380,A3OZ7RXT1XGZR9,B005LAII0I,freeismylife,"[4, 5]","On Wednesday night (3/28), my son and I attended an advance screening of Mirror Mirror, the movie that gives a new take on the story of Snow White.I was really looking forward to seeing Mirror Mirror.  I had seen the ads for the movie and it looked like it was going to be very funny.  I had also run a giveaway on my blog for the Soundtrack to Mirror Mirror so I knew that the music was going to be great.  And I loved the over-the-top clothing in the movie so much that I even did a Mirror Mirror Pinterest board. So I was expecting to have great time and overall my son and I liked the movie.Mirror Mirror is told from the perspective of the Evil Queen (played by Julia Roberts).  When the movie opens, the Evil Queen is fully in power and has drained the poor villagers dry of all their money to support her lavish lifestyle of over the top gowns and parties. Her parties are so crazy that she even plays a game of chess with human chess pieces.Snow White (played by Lilly Collins) has pretty much been locked in her room for the past ten years after her father, the King, disappeared in the forest. The Evil Queen has been controlling poor Snow White by putting her down every chance she can get - and boy oh boy does the Evil Queen do a great job of bullying Snow White. Some of her comments to Snow White are brutal.On Snow White's 18th birthday, she finally gets the courage to leave the castle and visit the village and she finds that all the once happy people are now dirt poor. But she lacks the confidence to do anything about it. By chance she rescues Prince Alcott, the handsome prince who is passing through the land and has been robbed by the Seven Dwarfs. Yes, you read that correctly. In this version of the Snow White story, the Seven Dwarfs are thieves who live in the forest. At one time, they worked respectable jobs in the village, but the Evil Queen had them banished because of their appearance.The Queen wants to marry Prince Alcott for his money.  But, Prince Alcott is completely taken with Snow White. So taken in fact that the Queen wants her dead.  The story unfolds from there as Snow White finally ends up getting the courage to fight back.Julie Roberts is the star of this movie and she is fabulous as the Evil Queen.  She has the best clothes and the best one liners that you will ever hear. There is a scene where she has a ""beauty treatment"" that is totally beyond words. And she is so evil that you will have to look twice to remember that this role is being played by the actress who is the sweetheart of Hollywood.  The way Julia played the Evil Queen reminded me a lot of how Meryl Streep played Miranda Priestly in the movie The Devil Wears Prada. Adults will love the Evil Queen and kids will be scared to death.  My son actually flinched in his seat a few times.Another great role in Mirror Mirror is Nathan Lane as Brighton, the Evil Queen's butler.  He was just a riot and he had some of the funniest one liners in the whole movie.Lilly Collins as Snow White was all goodness and sweetest and kids will love her. But she and Prince Alcott (played by Armie Hammer) were upstaged for most of the movie by Julia Roberts as the Evil Queen. I loved their characters at the beginning and the end, but I think they were overpowered by all the fancy clothing (or in Prince Alcott's case - lack of clothing) for most of the movie.  Arnie Hammer had to take off his shirt so many times that I was wondering if this was a kids movie.  And Lilly Collins looked great, but she really needed a few more sword fighting lessons.The Seven Dwarfs were great and a few of them were so funny that everyone in the audience was laughing out aloud.The end of Mirror Mirror is wonderful and exciting. Good vs Evil is always thrilling and this movie has some great fight scenes. My son was so into the physical comedy and sword fights that I could hardly keep him in his seat. But despite all the clothing, and sword fighting and evilness, the middle of this movie is a tad boring - hate to say it.Overall Mirror Mirror is a visually appealing movie that both kids and parents will enjoy.  It was fun and outrageous. It was sweet and cute. And it was evil and exciting. It was also a little bit boring, But the end is definitely worth the entire movie.

Above all, it is sweet, something that is lacking in most modern revisionist fairy tales. I laughed a lot. This may be Julia Robert's best film in years. She certainly seems to be having fun! The entire cast is likable. The dialogue is contemporary, but not obnoxiously so. Wisely, the filmmakers didn't adhere to a faithful retelling -- that's been done -- but did a lovely riff on the legend. It even has a beautiful background score by Alan Menken. It amazes me that anyone can dump on a well-crafted, unpretentious film such as this while praising far less worthy efforts. I'm looking forward to ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" because it's going to be a darker, ""Lord of the Rings"" type of fantasy, but I seriously doubt that Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth will match Lily Collins and Armie Hammer's appeal.

However, you don't always judge a book by its cover much like you don't judge a movie by it's customs and special effects. The Storyline will always be more important no matter how flamboyant the cast's clothes looked.So, unfortunately this film's writers weren't as expensive as Julia Robert's wardrobe for this film. The idea behind Mirror Mirror is that it's meant to be a parody or a comical retelling of the Classic Snow White tale that I'm sure everyone knows from their childhood, but as the openings suggests it's supposedly from the Queen's POV not Snow White. There are 2 sides to every story right? Didn't Happen! It won't be long before anyone recognizes that the story is in favor of Snow White even though she's not supposed to be the main character. The Evil stepmother is still evil, Snow White is still beautiful and the Prince still falls in love with her. The Only twist is that Snow White doesn't end up eating the apple which makes me question the directors choice? What was the point of that apple scene anyways? To ensure that the Oh so evil Marie Antoinette version of this fairytale the step mother dies? Come On! She could've met her ultimate and tragic fate in a different way or to keep things lighter she could've just vanished once and for all.There isn't much dialogue going on and frankly it's all flat and boring. The Characters are all two dimensional at best except for the Evil step mother but even that didn't save the movie from being lame. The Bollywood ending is also very stupid? To sum it all up, this is movie is for stupid people I don't mean that the people who liked this movie are stupid just that the characters are stupid! I know it's meant to be funny but when was funny equivalent for stupid? And the Macho, Noble Prince wasn't even Macho he was more like a toy actually. They even got the characterization wrong in a bad way.I know, this is meant to be a kid's movie and I shouldn't take it seriously but even for a PG film this was lame. I can think of Way better films out of the top of my head. With the Economy drifting and expenses rising wouldn't you want to watch something worthwhile? Something entertaining and unique at the same time? To compensate for your money?Instead of a unoriginal, unfunny retelling of a classic fairy tale that you'll forget about after 2 minutes from the rolling credits?I think this film would've been more interesting if they made Snow White the evil one and the Step Mother the good one just to shake things up.

How many times will they remake ""Snow White"" and when will we tire of seeing it? At least this time it's billed as ""The untold adventures..."" and is from the queen's point of view.In this version, our evil queen is played by a wry, dry Julia Roberts, who is clearly having the time of her life, so let's get ready for a new wrinkle on an old story. Her acerbic digressions are a hoot as this is a far more adult (and more comic) take.This cast promises more than a light touch of comedy:* Julia Roberts (""Larry Crowne"") is a four-times-married widow who instantly sees potential in the handsome prince who comes adventuring into her poverty-stricken realm. In order to throw a party for him, she raises taxes.* Lily Collins (""Priest"") is our orphaned Snow White, slated for an early death in the forest as soon as the queen realizes the threat from her burgeoning beauty. Collins has the eyebrows of a young Elizabeth Taylor.* Armie Hammer (""J. Edgar"") is very funny as the dauntless prince. He is earnest, sincere and quite handsome. He keeps losing all but his skivvies to the dwarfs and has to beg for pants. Wait until you see his tooth sparkle just before he is given the love potion.* Nathan Lane (""Modern Family"") is the queen's minion. He is the unwilling bearer of all the bad tidings, e.g., when taxes are raised, and when Snow White is found to be alive after all.* Sean Bean (""Game of Thrones"") as the king, long thought dead.* Mare Winningham (LOTS of TV) as the scullery maid who is loyal to Snow White and her long-absent father.Snow White doesn't have good or bad things just happen to her. She has to toil, study, practice and fight, for what she values. I liked seeing her apply herself with a goal in mind; so even though small children were a bit bored, the lessons for their older siblings were good ones. The adult one-liners that made all of us laugh went over the tots' heads, but the lengthy CGI-loaded fight scenes (with G-rated monsters) were tedious for ALL of us.

Julia Roberts is the middle-aged wicked queen who has a fiscal problem in her palace and wants to marry into some money to solve it.  Lily Collins is the 18 YO ""Snow"" who gets out from under the Queen's thumb and is becoming independent, liberated and more assertive.  The seven dwarfs are played by .... seven dwarf actors, who are disgruntled bandits (they get on stilts and do acrobatic manuevers when they rob a victim).  Roberts the Queen has her Cougar eye on a younger boy-toy prince (played by Arnie Hammer) who keeps getting his clothes robbed by the bandits and shows up in front of her without a shirt.  But of course, Snow and the Prince are really in love.  The Queen's assistant is played by the very funny Nathan Lane.  Lots of fun little scenes and a nice, competant, entertaining fairly forgettable plot.  The dwarfs are a funny, edgy bunch, with good interplay and banter. The strong, independent Snow (taught by the dwarf bandits) duels creepy puppet zombies, the Prince himself, and the ""beast"" at the end.  I guess she's supposed to be the new role-model for strong, successful women, while the men (the Prince, the Assistant) are silly twits.  Roberts plays a good wicked queen character in another strong female role.  Like a pushy middle-age Cougar boss at work.I thought that it was a PG-13 but it seems the MPAA rates it a PG.  One non-family-friendly part is when the Queen's assistant is turned into a cockroach by magic.  When he ""gets better"" he's bemoaning his nightmare, saying that ""the worst part was, a grasshopper had his way with me!""  Ha-ha.  Try explaining that to your 10 YO child, that he was buggered by another insect.

It doesn't pretend to have other ambitions than to give us a merry good laugh - but in this mission it succeeds very nicely.This is a very unorthodox retelling of the Snow White fairy tale, but the principal characters are all there.The Evil Queen (Julia Roberts) is probably the main attraction in this show. She was ""modernized"" (she is in fact a gold digger exhausting financial resources of successive husbands) and ""upgraded"" (she can do REALLY BAD magic - it is not just disguise and poison). Her Magic Mirror is also much more powerful than earlier versions. Julia Roberts clearly had lots of fun playing this character and she is simply excellent! She is also very atractive in this film - frankly, I think even more attractive than Snow White... And the scene in which she takes care her of her body, face, skin, lips, hair etc. to better ensnare the Prince Charming is worth an Oscar!Snow White (Lilly Collins) is of course also more ""modern"" than the one in Disney classical movie, but she is definitely not a modern teenager. She is brave, clever, funny and has much more ambition than just being rescued by the Prince Charming, but she is also a true lady: she is always impeccably dressed, never raises her voice, never curses, is always polite (even to the enemies) and although she can swordfight if necessary, she has also all the charm (and timidity) of a very young girl who was never allowed much out of her house... Last but not least, she is clearly a real future queen material - because with all her charm, manners and timidity she can also be ruthless, when necessary...The Prince Charming (Armie Hammer) is a handsome young man, a little bit arrogant and conceited in the beginning, but also courageous, clever, resourceful and ultimately rather likeable. He can also quite well spank young ladies with his sword...)))The Seven Dwarves are a very special bunch and I will not say much more about them, to avoid spoilers. But they certainly give a great show! After the end, just before the credits we learn what happened to them later - do NOT miss that part!This film has a lot of easy and pleasant humour, with the results of magic used by the Evil Queen (magic is always a little unpredictable) and her comments on the developing story being the best moments. A good advice - never get changed into a cockroach. And if it happens, beware of grasshoppers...))) Also, before serving somebody a magic elixir, check well the notice...Towards the end of the film Sean Bean drops by just in time to conclude the film and give away Snow White in marriage and he is a very impressive presence. And no, just for once, his character doesn't get killed in this one...)))All in all, this is a very amusing, nice little film, watchable by all family, with two very beautiful women, one very handsome young man and seven very amusing unusually short freedom fighters!

1478453,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAII0I,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I have to say after watching so many modern day versions of fairy tales I've decided I've joined to ranks of old fogies. I just don't like new fangled updates of classic tales. Perhaps that's not fair. Reworking a classic fairy tale while not saying so directly has turned out okay for some films. But to say this is the real thing when it's not makes for some bad movies. Like MIRROR MIRROR.From all the advertising and promotions you would think that this movie isn't about Snow White at all and in a sense you'd be correct. It even begins with the evil queen narrating the tale. As played by Julia Roberts all I could think of while watching this was that she's gone from a talented actress to one that wants to be the center of attention. The evil queen is a part of the story but not the focus.The fairy tale gets twisted to suit the needs of the actors involved with the King marrying the Queen (Julia Roberts) while Snow (Lilly Collins) is young, disappearing and leaving the Queen in charge. Snow lives more along the lines of Cinderella without the work involved, forced to stay out of the public eye while the queen throws parties and more.Traveling through a local forest is Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) seeking fame and fortune. Unfortunately he is set upon by bandits in the form of seven dwarves on bouncing stilts. Robbed of clothing and money, the Prince is saved by Snow and taken to the castle where the Queen takes a fancy to him, not just because of his looks but because her constant spending has left the castle treasury empty. When Snow catches the eye of the Prince the Queen becomes jealous and has her taken to the forest to be killed, but we know how that ends.Instead Snow finds the home of the thieving dwarves and asks to be taken in just for the night. Finally relenting, they allow her to stay and find themselves enjoying her company and help. She stays and they teach her how to survive which comes in handy when the Prince shows up later and is accosted by the dwarves once again.The story goes back and forth with the love interests played out nicely and the Queen fulfilling the role of being evil and nasty. The whole poisoned apple that so many remember from the story (and of course the Disney version) is tossed out only to be dropped in at the last minute but played out differently. The kiss from the Prince to save Snow in the traditional sense is gone as well. And just so you know this isn't your grandparents telling of Snow White, a Bollywood song is tossed in at the very end.The acting seems plain to me and in parts somewhat amateurish or perhaps it was just the script and the things the actors were doing on screen. The concept of the dwarves becoming steam punk looking robbers didn't set right with me. It shows children that stealing is okay if you have a reason. And the concept of taxing the poor seemed more out of Robin Hood than the story of Snow White. Is this something children understand yet? Then again with the way things are going perhaps the sooner they learn about taxes the better.I'm sure this is me just not feeling that the story needed retelling or rebooting but while it looked gorgeous it just felt empty to me. I know my great great niece loved it, then again she's 6 and my guess is hasn't seen the Disney version. Knowing that, perhaps the kids in your house will enjoy it as well. But for me it was just a movie to pass time, like a fast food meal that fills you up but leaves you unsatisfied.",2,THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL IS MISSING,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,3474,"['have', 'say', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'day', 'versions', 'fairy', 'tales', ""'ve"", 'decided', ""'ve"", 'joined', 'ranks', 'old', 'fogies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'fangled', 'updates', 'classic', 'tales', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'fair', 'Reworking', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'not', 'saying', 'so', 'directly', 'turned', 'out', 'okay', 'films', 'say', 'real', 'thing', 'when', 'not', 'bad', 'movies', 'MIRROR', 'MIRROR.From', 'advertising', 'promotions', 'would', 'think', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'Snow', 'White', 'sense', ""'d"", 'be', 'correct', 'even', 'evil', 'queen', 'narrating', 'tale', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'could', 'think', 'watching', 'was', 'gone', 'talented', 'actress', 'one', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'evil', 'queen', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'focus.The', 'fairy', 'tale', 'twisted', 'suit', 'needs', 'actors', 'involved', 'King', 'marrying', 'Queen', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Snow', 'Lilly', 'Collins', 'young', 'disappearing', 'leaving', 'Queen', 'charge', 'Snow', 'more', 'lines', 'Cinderella', 'work', 'involved', 'forced', 'stay', 'public', 'eye', 'queen', 'throws', 'parties', 'more.Traveling', 'local', 'forest', 'Prince', 'Alcott', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'seeking', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Unfortunately', 'set', 'bandits', 'form', 'seven', 'dwarves', 'bouncing', 'stilts', 'Robbed', 'clothing', 'money', 'Prince', 'saved', 'Snow', 'taken', 'castle', 'where', 'Queen', 'fancy', 'not', 'just', 'looks', 'constant', 'spending', 'left', 'castle', 'treasury', 'empty', 'When', 'Snow', 'eye', 'Prince', 'Queen', 'jealous', 'taken', 'forest', 'be', 'killed', 'know', 'how', 'ends.Instead', 'Snow', 'home', 'thieving', 'dwarves', 'asks', 'be', 'taken', 'just', 'night', 'Finally', 'relenting', 'allow', 'stay', 'find', 'enjoying', 'company', 'help', 'teach', 'how', 'survive', 'handy', 'when', 'Prince', 'up', 'later', 'accosted', 'dwarves', 'once', 'again.The', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'love', 'interests', 'played', 'out', 'nicely', 'Queen', 'fulfilling', 'role', 'being', 'evil', 'nasty', 'whole', 'poisoned', 'apple', 'so', 'many', 'remember', 'story', 'course', 'Disney', 'version', 'tossed', 'out', 'only', 'be', 'dropped', 'last', 'minute', 'played', 'out', 'differently', 'kiss', 'Prince', 'save', 'Snow', 'traditional', 'sense', 'gone', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'so', 'know', ""n't"", 'grandparents', 'telling', 'Snow', 'White', 'Bollywood', 'song', 'tossed', 'very', 'end.The', 'acting', 'plain', 'parts', 'somewhat', 'amateurish', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'script', 'things', 'actors', 'were', 'doing', 'screen', 'concept', 'dwarves', 'becoming', 'steam', 'punk', 'looking', 'robbers', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'right', 'children', 'stealing', 'okay', 'have', 'reason', 'concept', 'taxing', 'poor', 'seemed', 'more', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'story', 'Snow', 'White', 'something', 'children', 'understand', 'yet', 'Then', 'again', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'perhaps', 'sooner', 'learn', 'taxes', 'better.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'not', 'feeling', 'story', 'needed', 'retelling', 'rebooting', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'just', 'felt', 'empty', 'know', 'great', 'great', 'niece', 'loved', 'then', 'again', '6', 'guess', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Disney', 'version', 'Knowing', 'perhaps', 'kids', 'house', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'pass', 'time', 'fast', 'food', 'meal', 'up', 'unsatisfied']",Mirror Mirror

One of them was Mirror Mirror.I was hopeful that this would be good but wasn't holding out hope. I am usually let down by movies lately. Tainted I guess. It is mostly a time thing and if it turns out not to be good, I get upset by the time I wasted.We start the movie hearing Julia Roberts tell us that this movie is about her, ""the most beautiful Queen"". She tells us that this is her story. Julia is perfect as the Queen. She is evil but not in a scary way for children.Watching the cartoon version of this Grimms Fairy Tale by Disney still makes kids nervous. My daughter leaves the room when the witch is on screen and I remember closing my eyes too. This is much more enjoyable and no nightmares is always a plus. The world is scary enough when you are a kid.This movie was enjoyable because:I wasn't embarrassed to watch it with my kids. Completely child friendly.The all star cast including some surprises like Mare Winningham (I was wondering where she has been) the King played by Sean Bean from my newest favorite show Game of Thrones and well, Julia. I love her!It is funny, fast paced, and filled with adventure.While I have read some reviews I believe this movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously. It is a modern take with a twist on a fairy tale. How can you take that seriously. It is merely a movie created for enjoyment and hopefully you have a laugh.Great colors and great effects!I asked the kids what they liked about it:Handsome loved the 7 dwarfs and found them hysterically funny.

You know the drill: evil but beautiful stepmother turned queen, Snow White, a dashing prince, and a mirror.  That's about all director Tarsem Singh really remembers about Snow White and it's all you need to know to enjoy this vehicle that stars Julia Roberts.Julia Roberts is in this movie a lot. She's the evil queen.  The evil mirror reflection that lives in the mirror in a hut on a lake looks just like her (played by Lisa Roberts Gillan).  Roberts preens, she sneers, she glares, she makes mutters possibly ad-libbed barbs, and despite taking up fifty percent of the movie's screen time has remarkably little to do.Oh right, the other characters.  There's Snow White (Lily Collins), so lovely and angelically lit that she seems more like a mannequin than a real person. Prince Andrew Alcott (Armie Hammer, is distinguished primarily by his ability to take off his shirt and act like a dog (literally and figuratively as he displays charming misogyny with several whacks to White's rear during a sword fight).The only characters of substance are manservant Brighton (Nathan Lane) and the racially diverse seven dwarves: Butcher (Martin Klebba), Chuck (Ronald Lee Clark), Grimm (Danny Woodburn), Grub (Joe Gnoffo), Half Pint (Mark Povinelli), Napoleon (Jordan Prentice), and Wolf (Sebastian Saraceno). At least the dwarves get to walk around on stilts.The plot lurches along with the usual beats.  Boy meets dwarves, shirtless boy meets girl, girl meets dwarves, REVOLUTION! And then a Bollywood song.Singh clearly had too much budget to work with - for reasons that are never explained, the evil queen has to walk through a mirror on one side and rise out of water on the other.  Someone gets turned into a cockroach.  But the bulk of the budget is reserved for the breathtaking sets, the gorgeous costumes, and Julia Roberts.As a kid's vehicle to pass a few hours, ""Mirror, Mirror"" is a pleasant confection.  But as a movie of substance it's pretty dull.",2,Pretty dull,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,2392,"['Fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'new', 'vampires', 'stampede', 'fairyland', 'become', 'rather', 'crowded', 'lately', 'dueling', 'features', 'have', 'covered', 'legend', 'Snow', 'White', 'television', 'Grimm', 'Once', 'Time', 'big', 'screen', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'really', 'generous', 'Asylum', 'direct-to-video', 'Grimm', 'Snow', 'White', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'version', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'know', 'drill', 'evil', 'beautiful', 'stepmother', 'turned', 'queen', 'Snow', 'White', 'dashing', 'prince', 'mirror', 'director', 'Tarsem', 'Singh', 'really', 'Snow', 'White', 'need', 'know', 'enjoy', 'vehicle', 'Julia', 'Roberts.Julia', 'Roberts', 'movie', 'lot', 'evil', 'queen', 'evil', 'mirror', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'hut', 'lake', 'just', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Roberts', 'Gillan', 'Roberts', 'preens', 'sneers', 'mutters', 'possibly', 'ad-libbed', 'barbs', 'taking', 'up', 'fifty', 'percent', 'movie', 'screen', 'time', 'remarkably', 'little', 'do.Oh', 'right', 'other', 'characters', 'Snow', 'White', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'so', 'lovely', 'angelically', 'lit', 'more', 'mannequin', 'real', 'person', 'Prince', 'Andrew', 'Alcott', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'distinguished', 'primarily', 'ability', 'take', 'off', 'shirt', 'act', 'dog', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'charming', 'misogyny', 'several', 'whacks', 'White', 'rear', 'sword', 'fight', 'only', 'characters', 'substance', 'are', 'manservant', 'Brighton', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'racially', 'diverse', 'seven', 'dwarves', 'Butcher', 'Martin', 'Klebba', 'Chuck', 'Ronald', 'Lee', 'Clark', 'Grimm', 'Danny', 'Woodburn', 'Grub', 'Joe', 'Gnoffo', 'Half', 'Pint', 'Mark', 'Povinelli', 'Napoleon', 'Jordan', 'Prentice', 'Wolf', 'Sebastian', 'Saraceno', 'least', 'dwarves', 'get', 'walk', 'stilts.The', 'plot', 'lurches', 'usual', 'beats', 'Boy', 'dwarves', 'shirtless', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'girl', 'meets', 'REVOLUTION', 'then', 'Bollywood', 'song.Singh', 'clearly', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'budget', 'work', 'reasons', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'evil', 'queen', 'walk', 'mirror', 'one', 'side', 'rise', 'out', 'water', 'other', 'Someone', 'turned', 'cockroach', 'bulk', 'budget', 'reserved', 'breathtaking', 'sets', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'Julia', 'Roberts.As', 'kid', 'vehicle', 'pass', 'few', 'hours', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'pleasant', 'confection', 'movie', 'substance', 'pretty', 'dull']",Mirror Mirror

The tale in itself would be predictable and dull if they didn't take certain liberties with the fairy tale. The biggest change is that Snow White is more of a heroine than a peaceful damsel in distress and she turns to banditry with her dwarf friends. There's a lot of light humor (sometimes using modern context) within which helps propel the tale forward.Lily Collins plays Snow White and Armie Hammer plays the charming prince, who ends up coming across as lovable oaf at times. At first he's to marry the wicked queen but his heart, of course, remains for Snow White. He does a good job when under the wicked queen's love potion (called ""Puppy Love"") but the real male stars are the dwarves. The epilogue shows what happens to the dwarf bandits who helped Snow White secure her kingdom. A dance score follows with the end credits.There are obvious themes of true love and believing in yourself. Nothing too deep, mind you, but all in light fun.Snow White is a tale from the Brothers Grimm.

1478475,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B005LAII0I,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","I like the Snow White fairytale.  The combination of dwarves, poisoned apples, and a beautiful princess is a definite classic and one that many have been in love with for ages.  And so there are a lot of remakes of the tale, almost more than any other fairytale out there except perhaps Cinderella.  This one was sweet and innocent and good fun, but ultimately very hokey.Snow White has grown up in the castle a shut-in after her father's disappearance.  Once a spoiled daughter she's now subject to the whims of her step-mother the Queen, who is only concerned with her beauty.  The story is actually told through the Queen's eyes, sort of, and so we get a glimpse behind why she thinks she does and wants to oppress Snow White.  Using tax money to fund grand parties, the Queen is quickly bringing the kingdom to ruin, and when Snow White finally finds out how the people are surviving, she vows to do something about it.  Which of course brings the attention of the Queen on her and she must run for her life, only to be found by seven dwarves, who have an interesting work all their own.Characters:Snow White:  Lily CollinsThe Queen:  Julia RobertsPrince Alcott:  Armie HammerBrighton:  Nathan LaneThe King:  Sean BeanI can't say that any of the actors were well suited to their roles.  Julia Roberts was simply too nice to be an evil Queen, in fact she was more vain and self centered and hardly seemed capable of doing any real harm.  Prince Alcott I just couldn't figure out.  Sure Armie Hammer was nice to look at, but I require a little more from an actor than that.  Not much, but a little more.  Lily Collins as Snow White was ok.  She had a soft spoken way about her and definitely was able to put off that naive vibe.  I do think that Nathan Lane as Brighton was good.  He was the perfect toady for the Queen and always licking her boots.  The Seven Dwarves were definitely individuals and pretty funny, but I just couldn't figure out why one of them was a cowboy.  It seemed a little strange especially with some of the other pairings.So I did say the movie was hokey.  And it was.  Even the special effects contributed to that.  Although they weren't used often, just seeing little animated stars and such around a characters head causes me to groan a bit.  A little over the top and it was almost like the director was making fun of his own movie and couldn't take it seriously.  You kind of have to have one or the other, because mixing a serious with comedic elements like that confuses the watcher.  At least id did me.  I did enjoy that Snow White could take care of herself in this one.  Much better than having to constantly be rescued by the prince.  She could do anything that he could do, albeit with more dramatic flair.A cute movie, but not the best remake of the Snow White story.  I think it's definitely appropriate for younger audiences and probably a good family movie to watch.Review by M.

There are also numerous tired Hollywood cliches.  The characters do the most unaccountably and uncharacteristically dumb things time after time.  It becomes difficult to suspend one's disbelief.Many of the characters don't even have names.  They are simply ""The Prince,"" or ""The King.""Half of the characters are played by English actors, and have English accents.  The other half are played by American actors, and have American accents.  I'm not sure where this story is set, but maybe Canada?  That's halfway between the US and England, isn't it?  At least culturally?Julia Roberts was a particularly poor choice to play The Queen.  She does not do villainy well.The film also makes some rather bold political statements, considering it is a fairy tale and a family film.  There are numerous references to the poor economic state of the kingdom and to the tendency for greater taxation to deepen the recession.  One character even makes a reference to ""tax dollars,"" which is a term that feels completely out of place in a medieval fantasy story.  While the film makes some good points regarding politics and economics, that really isn't what I was looking for in a fairy tale.The film is full of beautiful costumes, sets, hair, makeup, and special effects, but they don't make up for the film's other shortcomings.

Lilly Collins as Snow White was made to look like Jennifer Connolly in ""Labyrinth."" The humor is simple and basic enough for everyone to enjoy. There are some minor hidden political commentary for us adults. Such as when Julia instructs Brighton (Nathan Lane) to use his imagination and tell the people ""bread is meat"" (ketchup is a vegetable).  But the film doesn't get bogged down trying to be political, it is just a fun film about aging women desperately attempting to hold on to their youth while competing with their daughter for suitors. (I didn't mention Kardashian.)The background is CG which gives the film a fairy tale look. The dwarfs are quirky and more akin to the ones we knew in ""Time Bandits"" than the bumbling group Disney gave us. They made good use of the sound track, one that could have been used in any film from 1935 to 1970...until the end when they did some ridiculous lip-sync song, directed at the young princesses in the audience.

You've ...","[2, 6]","I bought this movie because I was having a friend over, and we have a mutual interest in fantasies and fairy tales. Generally we can find *something* we like about it, but we couldn't even sit through this. I finished it later so I could review it, or else I would have just forgotten about it.Whatever you do, DON'T FORGET that Julia Roberts is in this movie. Remember that Julia Roberts plays the ""evil"" queen. She is on the posters, the blu ray cover, and on every other post on the movie's Facebook page. From the time they first started marketing this to the end of the flick, they could not stop harping on her being the star. She got way too much screen time considering the plot (what there was of it), and I think they were counting on her star power to sell more tickets.From the promotion, I thought I was going to at least get some good eye candy, and I did in the animated opening. Then they kept showing the queen in the same yellow dress.I've seen that tiara somewhere before.You keep thinking it will get better, but it doesn't. The wardrobe at the queen's wedding was a bitter disappointment, and by the end I think they were digging things out of a recycle bin.They must have blown the budget by the time they got to animating the lake and the beaver dam in Narnia. Every time Julia Roberts went there, they used the same sequence with her rising up from the water, and the exterior looked like something I could have rendered in Bryce about ten years ago.The movie is just bad. Remember when it was cool to see a girl swordfight? Now it's just cheesy. They do this in a montage, too. I'm all for strong female protagonists, but they need to stop doing it at the expense of making the men into nothing but comedy fodder and complete fools.The comedy isn't funny. I get that Julia Roberts' beauty treatments are gross, but I bet they didn't sell a lot of popcorn during that segment. Armie Hammer does his level best to play the bumbling prince, but they don't give him a lot to work with. He is capable of much more. It's hard to play a buffoon when they forgot the funny in the script.It's a criminal misuse of Nathan Lane. Even Lane can't make this movie funny. I was SO looking forward to seeing him, and it was AGONIZING to watch that much talent wasted. THEN Sean Bean actually manages to chew the scenery when he finally shows up onscreen with the horrible dialogue he's given. It's like watching Ned Stark poof in out of nowhere, deliver a few super serious lines and then just stand around. (That's literally what he does, too.)Lily Collins' song just doesn't fit with the movie. It looks like they made Sean Bean, Nathan Lane and Armie Hammer watch while they filmed it, too. It was bad enough watching it on screen; I can't imagine having to see and hear it live. You don't see Julia Roberts standing around, though, because she's the STAR, you know, in case you forgot.I can't believe I almost gave it two stars-- for what?Alan Menken's scoreis the only good thing about it, but you can get that separately. Don't waste your time or your money. It never gets any better than the opening sequence, and you'll be wishing you could forget it.

Based upon live action (rather than animation), the film is loaded with special effects, gorgeous imagery, and action.One of the main strengths of the film is the active role Snow White takes.  She is not a passive character who exists only as a victim of her evil stepmother that must be rescued by Prince Charming.  Snow fights her way through the film, teaches the dwarves more than one lesson, and even rescues the Prince on more than one occasion.The other main strength I found in the movie is the fantastic scenery, costumes, and makeup.  I would not be surprised if the wardrobe and makeup were up for award nomination -- Julia Roberts wears what appear to be dozens of gowns and dresses.  The sets are broad and beautiful also.On the other hand, the acting is over the top, and the slapstick and other humor, particularly involving the dwarves, can get quite silly at times.

Even playing a wicked queen, her amazing charisma is overwhelming. But I can't figure out what accent she was being forced to use. Everything she said sounded just a bit off and unnatural.The dwarfs were awesome except in any scene that required stilts; then it looked fake and bizarre. And while some of the dwarfs were good (and half pint was majorly cute), there were a couple of actors that were obviously hired because they fit the description of the part, because they couldn't act worth anything.Both Snow White and the prince did good. Armie Hammer really threw himself into the role, especially when he was required to portray ""puppy"" love.But what made this movie horrible was the settings. Yes, the story was wafer thin, and the plot made little if any sense. The final twist regarding the beast not only came out of nowhere, it is never explained or even remotely justified. All of that would be forgivable, though, if only Tarsem hadn't filmed the entire movie on two sets that would have looked fake in a 1950s movie. The castle never looks real, and the forest is just one step beyond a third grade play. It all felt so cheap and amateur that I actually paused the movie and went online to see if they had a tiny budget or something and couldn't afford anything better.This was a cute movie, predictable but pushing all the right buttons with a cast that for the most part gave it all. But ultimately it felt like watching the aforementioned third grade play. I still watch ""The Cell"" - a movie with a compelling plot and an amazing style - and I was hoping that even if the story wasn't that great, Tarsem's direction and art sense would make it beautiful.

With her husband gone, Snow is the only threat to The Queen's rule, so she keeps her confined to the castle. When speaking to Snow, she claims it's for safety reasons, but when her subjects inquire about the matter, she makes it appear as though the princess they've never seen is in a fragile state as a result of either physical or mental illness. All the while, her excesses have seen a once happy, wealthy kingdom turned into a fiefdom in dire financial straits populated by overtaxed miserable subjects. Her closest advisor, Brighton (played as an obsequious toady by the talented Nathan Lane) informs her that her best hope is to marry a Baron who has made numerous overtures in the past. But while the Baron possesses the wealth she desires, he is older and not particularly attractive. Then, as luck and uncreative storytelling would have it, a prince from a wealthy, faraway kingdom (played by Armie Hammer) is robbed, bound, and gagged by bandits inhabiting the woods, freed by Snow White, who has left the castle without the Queen's permission, and then brought to the castle by the royal guard so that she might offer an apology and, of course, the King's vacant seat in the throne.Now, of course, there have been numerous successful films based on fairy tales. Tangled (based on Rapunzel), Beauty and the Beast, and the original Disney version of Cinderella in a film simply titled Cinderella. While the two older films may not have the same appeal with the youth audience that Tangled does, they have greater appeal with older audiences, not just because of nostalgia, but because they are quality films. So, if you're a parent and your children have been begging you to take them to this film, make whatever effort you can to convince them to watch the older classic film or the more recent Disney features based on other fairy tales. This one just doesn't hold up.",2,The worst kind of kids' stuff,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2697,"['Imagine', 'oldest', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Have', 'got', 'No', 'not', 'one', 'Have', 'got', 'now', 'Yeah', 'Now', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'again', 'brain', 'trust', 'Relativity', 'Media', 'asked', 'question', 'came', 'back', 'resounding', 'yes.Snow', 'White', 'played', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'only', 'child', 'benevolent', 'king', 'referred', 'only', 'King', 'played', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'late', 'wife', 'who', 'detail', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'Snow', 'Collins', 'not', 'referred', 'King', 'was', 'raising', 'Snow', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'rule', 'kingdom', 'was', 'consumed', 'beast', 'known', 'inhabit', 'woods', 'long', 'could', 'happen', 'King', 'gone', 'Snow', 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'take', 'throne', 'duty', 'passed', 'wife', 'Clementianna', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'husband', 'gone', 'Snow', 'only', 'threat', 'Queen', 'rule', 'confined', 'castle', 'When', 'speaking', 'Snow', 'safety', 'reasons', 'when', 'subjects', 'inquire', 'matter', 'appear', 'princess', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'fragile', 'state', 'result', 'physical', 'mental', 'illness', 'while', 'excesses', 'have', 'seen', 'once', 'happy', 'wealthy', 'kingdom', 'turned', 'fiefdom', 'dire', 'financial', 'straits', 'populated', 'overtaxed', 'miserable', 'subjects', 'closest', 'advisor', 'Brighton', 'played', 'obsequious', 'toady', 'talented', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'best', 'hope', 'marry', 'Baron', 'who', 'made', 'numerous', 'overtures', 'past', 'Baron', 'wealth', 'older', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'Then', 'luck', 'uncreative', 'storytelling', 'would', 'have', 'prince', 'wealthy', 'faraway', 'kingdom', 'played', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'robbed', 'bound', 'gagged', 'bandits', 'inhabiting', 'woods', 'freed', 'Snow', 'White', 'who', 'left', 'castle', 'Queen', 'permission', 'then', 'brought', 'castle', 'royal', 'guard', 'might', 'offer', 'apology', 'course', 'King', 'vacant', 'seat', 'throne.Now', 'course', 'have', 'been', 'numerous', 'successful', 'films', 'based', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Tangled', 'based', 'Rapunzel', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'original', 'Disney', 'version', 'Cinderella', 'film', 'simply', 'titled', 'Cinderella', 'two', 'older', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'appeal', 'youth', 'audience', 'Tangled', 'have', 'greater', 'appeal', 'older', 'audiences', 'not', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'are', 'quality', 'films', 'So', ""'re"", 'parent', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'begging', 'take', 'film', 'make', 'effort', 'can', 'convince', 'watch', 'older', 'classic', 'film', 'more', 'recent', 'Disney', 'features', 'based', 'other', 'fairy', 'tales', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up']",Mirror Mirror
1478532,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAII0I,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Mirror Mirror"" is a family picture based on a tale of Snow White. Directed by Tarsem Singh (""The Cell,"" ""The Fall,"" and ""Immortals""), the film is great to look at (Oscar-winning designer Eiko Ishoika's final work), and some characters are fun to watch, but the retold version of a well-known fairy tale does not offer much else.""Mirror Mirror"" retains most of the elements found in a Brothers Grimm book - a dark forest, a magical mirror, a poisoned apple, a kiss, etc. - but they are used in a totally different way. In the modern-day take of the fairy tale, the heroine Snow White (Lily Collins) learns swordsmanship, fights for her own destiny, and changes the others' for the better. Well, except one.Julia Roberts plays a wicked queen. Actually she plays two roles, the queen and her (much darker) reflection. Perhaps I am not the only one who thought the cynical version of her on the magical mirror is more interesting than the ""original,"" which somehow lacks the complexity the other is given. Things liven up when the queen attempts to entice the rich and handsome prince (Armie Hammer) into marriage. We need more of it.This is not to say ""Mirror Mirror"" is bad. It is just most of the film's episodes are tame. The film needs a narrative that is faster and brisker. The rousing musical number at the end (a Bollywood-style rendition of an old Nina Hart song) has the razzle-dazzle and fun that is much needed in the narrative that precedes it.",3,"Updated ""Snow White"" is Great to Look at",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,1455,"['Mirror', 'Mirror', 'family', 'picture', 'based', 'tale', 'Snow', 'White', 'Directed', 'Tarsem', 'Singh', 'Cell', 'Fall', 'Immortals', 'film', 'great', 'look', 'Oscar-winning', 'designer', 'Eiko', 'Ishoika', 'final', 'work', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'retold', 'version', 'well-known', 'fairy', 'tale', 'not', 'offer', 'much', 'else', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'most', 'elements', 'found', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'book', 'dark', 'forest', 'magical', 'mirror', 'poisoned', 'apple', 'kiss', 'etc', 'are', 'used', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'modern-day', 'take', 'fairy', 'tale', 'heroine', 'Snow', 'White', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'swordsmanship', 'fights', 'own', 'destiny', 'others', 'better', 'Well', 'one.Julia', 'Roberts', 'wicked', 'queen', 'Actually', 'two', 'roles', 'queen', 'much', 'darker', 'reflection', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'thought', 'cynical', 'version', 'magical', 'mirror', 'more', 'interesting', 'original', 'somehow', 'complexity', 'other', 'given', 'Things', 'liven', 'up', 'when', 'queen', 'attempts', 'entice', 'rich', 'handsome', 'prince', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'marriage', 'need', 'more', 'it.This', 'not', 'say', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'bad', 'just', 'most', 'film', 'episodes', 'are', 'tame', 'film', 'narrative', 'faster', 'brisker', 'rousing', 'musical', 'number', 'end', 'Bollywood-style', 'rendition', 'old', 'Nina', 'Hart', 'song', 'razzle-dazzle', 'fun', 'much', 'needed', 'narrative']",Mirror Mirror
