Janine Garofalo plays a senator's aide from Boston whose boss, the senator, wants her to travel to Ireland .  He wants her to find any family of his that might be left there from 3 generations back that have immigrated to Boston.  She goes to a tiny little town in Ireland, not knowing that there's a matchmaking festival going on.  Early on she meets an Irish journalist at the hotel she's staying at.  A matchmaker attempts to set them up, as he has made several successful marriages.  As the story unfolds, with a few little twists and turns, she finds love, only to have it taken away.  It really is a nice movie with several appealing characters.  You'll recognize some.

The story begins with a Senator's aide, played by Janeane Garofalo, whose senator is seeking re-election, in order, to stir up votes, he decides that he wants his aide to go on a small business trip to a small fishing village in Ireland.The reason for the senator wanting his aide to travel to Ireland is because he sees himself as a J.F.K. clone, in that, like J.F.K.'s real roots being Irish, so this senator is lead to believe by his father that their family is of Irish descent, too, whose surname is McGlory; hence, his reasons for having his aide travel across the Atlantic over to Ireland to discover his Irish roots, in order, to muster up the Irish vote in Boston, where the senator's home is. Figuring that like J.F.K. had Irish roots, then he views himself as someday being president, this is implied; although, as fas as I can remember, never actually stated, but the innuendo is prominent.Once, the senator aide reaches Ireland at the beginning of the film she runs into all kinds of problems from almost missing her flight, to flying on a small cramped plane, to almost missing her bus and landing in the water, the movie is chock full of hilarious moments, but you'll have to rent or buy the VHS or DVD version, in order, to discover other silly adventures, which befall the main character, the senator's aide played by Janeane Garofalo.I give this five stars for it's humor and one poignant scene.Rent it, or buy it, you'll be glad you did!*(Due to some mature adult themes may be unsuitable for those under 18).*",5,"Humorous, delightful",1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,1605,"['Hi', 'found', 'Matchmaker', 'be', 'amusing', 'delightful', 'humorous', 'film', 'story', 'Senator', 'aide', 'played', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'senator', 'seeking', 're-election', 'order', 'stir', 'up', 'votes', 'aide', 'go', 'small', 'business', 'trip', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'Ireland.The', 'reason', 'senator', 'wanting', 'aide', 'travel', 'Ireland', 'J.F.K', 'clone', 'J.F.K', 'real', 'roots', 'being', 'Irish', 'senator', 'lead', 'believe', 'father', 'family', 'Irish', 'descent', 'too', 'surname', 'McGlory', 'hence', 'reasons', 'having', 'aide', 'travel', 'Atlantic', 'Ireland', 'discover', 'Irish', 'roots', 'order', 'muster', 'up', 'Irish', 'vote', 'Boston', 'where', 'senator', 'home', 'Figuring', 'J.F.K', 'had', 'Irish', 'roots', 'then', 'someday', 'being', 'president', 'implied', 'as', 'fas', 'can', 'remember', 'never', 'actually', 'stated', 'innuendo', 'prominent.Once', 'senator', 'aide', 'Ireland', 'beginning', 'film', 'kinds', 'problems', 'almost', 'missing', 'flight', 'flying', 'small', 'cramped', 'plane', 'almost', 'missing', 'bus', 'landing', 'water', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'hilarious', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'have', 'rent', 'buy', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'version', 'order', 'discover', 'other', 'silly', 'adventures', 'befall', 'main', 'character', 'senator', 'aide', 'played', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo.I', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'humor', 'one', 'poignant', 'scene.Rent', 'buy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', '*', 'Due', 'mature', 'adult', 'themes', 'may', 'be', 'unsuitable', '18', '*']",The Matchmaker VHS

I would like to add a little comment on the characteristics that I liked most and that will make me remember this work.There are many reasons to see this movie, even now that it is ten years old.The first is that it stands the test of time: it is still as fresh and entertaining as when it came out and it deals with timeless problems that have somehow become cliches: raskally political men, the importance the Americans give to finding their roots, overwork, the difficulty of a womans role, loneliness and love.The second is that all the actors are well casted, very good and true to life, they don't seem to come out of a refinished, glossy out of the world reality.The third is that its humoristic with fine ironic dialogue that makes a laugh or two.But the fourth reason is the most important of all and it is the lively, precise and poetic description of the beauty and tradition of Ireland's West Coast from Connemara to Aran Island to Lisdoonvarna's long standing matchmaking tradition.If at this point the reader is not bored I would like to make the point on how a good script makes a good movie.Lisdoonvarna's Matchmaking Festival held every year in September-October dates back to the 18th Century, when after the summer harvesting rich Irish countrymen went to Lisdoonvarna for the famous spa with warm waters. Here they arranged marriages for their sons and daughters with the help of the traditional figure of the Matchmaker (man or woman) of which I believe a few still survive today. Lisdoonvarna is in County Clare to the south of the West Irish Coast, while the movie was shot in the more picturesque Roundstone Connemara north of Galway and on Aran Island, but the atmosphere of this beautiful corner of the world is all there.Ireland also has a tradition of singing contests that is well depicted in the movie. The soundtrack is really important in defining the atmospheres and all the songs are chosen with real feeling as can be seen by all the reviews that ask for the soundtrack.It is incredible and a little pedantic to say but from this movie we not only get entertainment but also a little bit of culture.",4,Matchmaking never goes out of fashion!,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2251,"['plot', 'Matchmaker', 'been', 'told', 'depth', 'many', 'reviewers', 'as', 'well', 'talent', 'shown', 'actors', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'little', 'comment', 'characteristics', 'liked', 'most', 'will', 'make', 'remember', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'old.The', 'first', 'test', 'time', 'still', 'fresh', 'entertaining', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'timeless', 'problems', 'have', 'somehow', 'become', 'cliches', 'raskally', 'political', 'men', 'importance', 'Americans', 'give', 'finding', 'roots', 'overwork', 'difficulty', 'womans', 'role', 'loneliness', 'love.The', 'second', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'casted', 'very', 'good', 'true', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'refinished', 'glossy', 'world', 'reality.The', 'third', 'humoristic', 'fine', 'ironic', 'dialogue', 'laugh', 'two.But', 'fourth', 'reason', 'most', 'important', 'lively', 'precise', 'poetic', 'description', 'beauty', 'tradition', 'Ireland', 'West', 'Coast', 'Connemara', 'Aran', 'Island', 'Lisdoonvarna', 'long', 'standing', 'matchmaking', 'tradition.If', 'point', 'reader', 'not', 'bored', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'point', 'how', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'movie.Lisdoonvarna', 'Matchmaking', 'Festival', 'held', 'year', 'September-October', 'dates', 'back', '18th', 'Century', 'when', 'summer', 'harvesting', 'rich', 'Irish', 'countrymen', 'went', 'Lisdoonvarna', 'famous', 'spa', 'warm', 'waters', 'Here', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'sons', 'daughters', 'help', 'traditional', 'figure', 'Matchmaker', 'man', 'woman', 'believe', 'few', 'still', 'survive', 'today', 'Lisdoonvarna', 'County', 'Clare', 'south', 'West', 'Irish', 'Coast', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'more', 'picturesque', 'Roundstone', 'Connemara', 'north', 'Galway', 'Aran', 'Island', 'atmosphere', 'beautiful', 'corner', 'world', 'there.Ireland', 'also', 'tradition', 'singing', 'contests', 'well', 'depicted', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'important', 'defining', 'atmospheres', 'songs', 'are', 'chosen', 'real', 'feeling', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reviews', 'ask', 'soundtrack.It', 'incredible', 'little', 'pedantic', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'entertainment', 'also', 'little', 'bit', 'culture']",The Matchmaker VHS

This is one of those examples which, proves that good acting and a great screen presence is not reserved for stars with huge names and multi-million dollar signing contracts (though, it's a shame that Ms. Garofalo isn't pulling down super-star paychecks). This story is set in an Ireland that may be quaint but also shows it's cracks; they just aren't afraid of them. Instead it's the rough and tumble flaws of this country's people and locales that makes it so endearing as the primary setting. Janeane is a misplaced campaign employee trying to track down the roots of her boss, the candidate, who believes he has roots in a particular town on the coast of Ireland. To make matters worse than her difficulty getting to this place she lands in the midst of a matchmaker's festival. She has no interest in getting hooked up and only wants to get her job done so she can return to civilization. What she finds are scammers, overbooked hotels and a matchmaker desperate to hook her up with a rough-around-the-edges local son recently returned home. Dennis Leary plays a conniving campaign manager who is more focused on victory than on relative facts and also treats folks like Janeane's character like an under-achieving serf. Without giving too much away Janeane is a delight and a genuine talent. I doubt that this film did very well and that's a shame.

Women from all over come to this particular spot in Ireland to find a husband.  And Dermot O'Brien is the best of the matchmakers--or so he claims.""The Matchmaker"" only got funnier the second time we saw it.  My husband and I were laughing so hard in places, we had to pause the DVD so we didn't miss anything.If you enjoy Irish music and biting humor--this is definitely a film for you.

435241,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6304766742,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[2, 2]","""The Matchmaker"" is a charming comedy set in rural Ireland and starring an unlikely heroine: Janeane Garofalo, better known as a stand-up comedienne who's worked with Ben Stiller, SNL, and Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. Janeane stars as Marcy Tizard, harried assistant to Senator John McGlory in the middle of his reelection campaign. The campaign isn't going well, and McGlory and his chauvinistic, power-hungry handler Nick (Denis Leary) send Marcy to Ballinagra, Ireland to look up the senator's Irish roots in a bid to connect with Irish-American voters.Marcy arrives in the middle of the town's matchmaking festival, where every male wants nothing more than to propose, from the dashingly handsome to the decrepit. Getting information from the locals is more of a challenge than she'd realized. The small village is full of colourful characters, and Marcy becomes attached to Sean (David O'Hara), a former journalist who's dead-ended himself as bartender. The charming Milo O'Shea as the town's matchmaker brought to mind David Kelly in ""Waking Ned Devine.""The scenery of the rugged Irish coast (Cliffs of Moher) and Aran Isles (one of the last bastions of Irish Gaelic, as evidenced by Irish-language signs and greetings) and the rollicking Irish score, with contributions by Van Morrison, the Chieftains, Waterboys, and more, will appeal to lovers of Celtic lore, unusual romances, and low-key comedies.  I was pleasantly surprised by the charming sum of its parts, although I could have done with a little less of the smarmy politics, given the current political atmosphere and media saturation it receives.

A different kind of romance with a sense of adventure. Jeanne Garofarlo plays the cynical, sarcastic Marcy. An aide to a Boston senator McGlory. McGlory sends Marcy to a remote village of Ballinagra to dig up some McGlory relatives to help in his campaign. Along her way she meets some interesting locals. There she catches the eye of matchmaker Dermot played by Milo O'Shea. Dermot senses the chemistry between Marcy and the equally cynical Sean played by David O'Hara. A former journalist who has just returned to his local village to write a book.The best parts are the meeting of the two wayward singles. Marcy bumps into Sean in her bathroom at this hotel she didn't actually plan on. She got caught in a jam of finding proper room & board during the Matchmaking Fest. Now, isn't that fate or what? The scenes with his dog are so funny. As are the scenes in the pub. The singing contest. The hiliarious scene with the folk they scourged up to be the misfit McGlory clan. It was a riot! And the always growing relationship between the two lonely singles, Marcy and Sean.When all good things come to a close with the death of Dermot the Matchmaker. Marcy must return with her boss back to Boston. Marcy's last visit to Dermot's cottage to find a package waiting for her. She leaves what really mattered in her life behind her.  It ends in a very sweet reunion of the two lovers. It's just a really darlin' sweet film. It tells one that you can find love where you least expect it. It's a feel good film, when you're feeling down. It has some of the most beautiful cinematography of breath-taking Ireland. And the music is really great. Traditional and very Irish!

I really don't know why, but that one failing cannot even begin to touch the beauty of the land and the people of Ireland. As for those who thought it was using every cheap stereotype of Ireland and the Irish people, it just shows how ignorant Americans can be--they can't laugh at themselves, so why should another culture be able to create humour out of the very stereotypes Americans have created. Let's get back to the positive! The music was beautifully scored, and anyone who has actually made the effort to go to the stones of D&uacute;n Aengus on Inis M&oacute;r could not possibly think that this movie cheapens any part of the Irish Spirit.
