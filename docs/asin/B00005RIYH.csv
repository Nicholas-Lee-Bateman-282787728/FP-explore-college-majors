Burchfield,"[0, 0]","Some of the reviewers are complaining about scratched/ used DVDs, be sure to select ""New"" when you're buying one of these!I got my copy on eBay, (new I think) years ago and found that while the case says NTSC, Region 1 (the U.S.) isn't listed- it plays on both of my players anyway. The music is, of course, beautiful- you'll get 13 different videos each of a different style- some you're bound to like better than others.I don't find any sort of menu or scene selection, the disc just starts playing. Playback is clear although the soundtrack may be a bit subdued for some listeners. I've noted some pause/ glitches in a few selections on my DVD, #3 ""Storms in Africa"" being the worst (Enya freezes for just a moment once and the other- some Elephants freeze for a few seconds), you may not even notice if you aren't looking right at the screen at the moment.Great music & since it looks as though Enya hasn't recorded anything in years- if you don't mind the pricing- this DVD is worth owning.",5,Great music- some issues with DVD setup,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,995,"['reviewers', 'are', 'complaining', 'scratched/', 'used', 'DVDs', 'be', 'sure', 'select', 'New', 'when', ""'re"", 'buying', 'one', 'got', 'copy', 'eBay', 'new', 'think', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'case', 'NTSC', 'Region', '1', 'U.S.', ""n't"", 'listed-', 'players', 'anyway', 'music', 'course', 'beautiful-', ""'ll"", 'get', '13', 'different', 'videos', 'different', 'style-', ""'re"", 'bound', 'like', 'better', 'others.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'sort', 'menu', 'scene', 'selection', 'disc', 'just', 'playing', 'Playback', 'clear', 'soundtrack', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'subdued', 'listeners', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'pause/', 'glitches', 'few', 'selections', 'DVD', '3', 'Storms', 'Africa', 'being', 'worst', 'Enya', 'just', 'moment', 'once', 'other-', 'Elephants', 'freeze', 'few', 'seconds', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'notice', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'right', 'screen', 'moment.Great', 'music', 'Enya', ""n't"", 'recorded', 'anything', 'years-', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'pricing-', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

Of course this does seem very disappointing when she has oh so many fans in america.  Loads of speculation has been going on what all the delay is, and let me lay some that to rest.  The official word from representatives around her is that there is problems with making sure the DVD is properly produced in Dolby 5.1, and possibly other modes too.  Even still, I am not sure what could be taking so long to make sure all those little technical details in the sound are.  Surely it shouldn't have taken well over a year to do all that, but I'm no techno geek as far as understanding what all is involved in making all those little adjustments.  There possibly might be other little problems as far as what all the video selections for the american version will be, as far as making sure all the proper licencing are in place.  We are perhaps also waiting to make sure most (if not all) of her videos ever done will be on it, for one ultimate DVD video collection.  One can only hope.I've only given this release a 4 star rating, just because of the major delay.  Her voice obviously deserves a perfect 5, there is not doubt about that.  So when it does come out for america, enjoy it to the extreme.  Have been a fan of hers for many many years, ever since about her second album hit the market.  First thing I ever bought of hers was a single that was released in rarity at the time (Oiche Chiun - Silent Night in Gaelic, and also had a couple of other lovely pieces on it too).  I started using it as a nice little stocking stuffer type gift for many christmas's after then, and still do when I meet new friends who I haven't given it to already (mostly cause I stock piled many copies back then fearing it would disappear for a long long time).  It has since then been released a bit more, and been included on her ultimate cd set that was just released late in 2002.  Be sure to try and look for all of her CD's, if you haven't tried buying her ultimate collection (Only Time: Collection Box Set).  Buying that would get you most everything, except for some very rare tracks only available on imported singles and stuff.  So enjoy that till this DVD finally gets it's release.  And if your desperate, you might want to try and pick up a VHS copy of her Moonshadow collection of videos released about 10 years ago, which has 5 of her more popular songs from back then.And no Enya didn't delay the release here because of her political hatred for what america is doing right now.  Don't even go there.  You'd have to hear about what she thinks directly from her if you really want to know.",4,Be patient for Enya's Ameircan DVD debut,1048982400,"03 30, 2003",2003,2670,"['moment', 'still', 'not', 'much', 'word', 'Enya', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'america', 'course', 'seem', 'very', 'disappointing', 'when', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'america', 'Loads', 'speculation', 'been', 'going', 'delay', 'let', 'lay', 'rest', 'official', 'word', 'representatives', 'problems', 'making', 'sure', 'DVD', 'properly', 'produced', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'possibly', 'other', 'modes', 'too', 'Even', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'make', 'sure', 'little', 'technical', 'details', 'sound', 'are', 'Surely', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'well', 'year', 'do', ""'m"", 'techno', 'geek', 'as', 'far', 'understanding', 'what', 'involved', 'making', 'little', 'adjustments', 'possibly', 'might', 'be', 'other', 'little', 'problems', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'video', 'selections', 'american', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'far', 'making', 'sure', 'proper', 'licencing', 'are', 'place', 'are', 'perhaps', 'also', 'waiting', 'make', 'sure', 'most', 'not', 'videos', 'ever', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'ultimate', 'DVD', 'video', 'collection', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'given', 'release', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'major', 'delay', 'voice', 'obviously', 'perfect', '5', 'not', 'doubt', 'So', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'america', 'enjoy', 'extreme', 'Have', 'been', 'fan', 'hers', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ever', 'second', 'album', 'hit', 'market', 'First', 'thing', 'ever', 'bought', 'hers', 'was', 'single', 'was', 'released', 'rarity', 'time', 'Oiche', 'Chiun', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Gaelic', 'also', 'had', 'couple', 'other', 'lovely', 'pieces', 'too', 'started', 'using', 'nice', 'little', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'type', 'gift', 'many', 'christmas', 'then', 'still', 'do', 'when', 'meet', 'new', 'friends', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'already', 'mostly', 'cause', 'stock', 'piled', 'many', 'copies', 'back', 'then', 'fearing', 'would', 'disappear', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'then', 'been', 'released', 'bit', 'more', 'been', 'included', 'ultimate', 'cd', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'late', '2002', 'Be', 'sure', 'try', 'look', 'CD', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'buying', 'ultimate', 'collection', 'Only', 'Time', 'Collection', 'Box', 'Set', 'Buying', 'would', 'get', 'most', 'everything', 'very', 'rare', 'tracks', 'only', 'available', 'imported', 'singles', 'stuff', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'finally', 'release', 'desperate', 'might', 'want', 'try', 'pick', 'up', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Moonshadow', 'collection', 'videos', 'released', '10', 'years', 'ago', '5', 'more', 'popular', 'songs', 'back', 'then.And', 'Enya', 'did', ""n't"", 'delay', 'release', 'here', 'political', 'hatred', 'what', 'america', 'doing', 'right', 'now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'there', ""'d"", 'have', 'hear', 'what', 'directly', 'really', 'want', 'know']",N/A

I've been a fan of Enya for at least 20 yrs and I'm so happy to finally have been able get a copy of this DVD. Even the interview with Enya is very moving as you hear her story and about how she and those who are involved in making the music and the videos; plus two special features on the making of the videos is very interesting. I feel this DVD is quite a soul stirring and heart warming experience. She is quite beautiful on the inside as well as the outside, it's a must for any Enya fan. Out of the countless music or concert DVD's I own, in all its simplicity and beauty, I can't think of any which is more personal and emotionally satisfying than this DVD.",5,Absolutely Beautiful,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,770,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'hard', 'get', 'DVD', 'performer', 'who', 'so', 'popular', 'DVD', 'incredible', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Enya', 'least', '20', 'yrs', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'finally', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'copy', 'DVD', 'Even', 'interview', 'Enya', 'very', 'moving', 'hear', 'story', 'how', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'making', 'music', 'videos', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'videos', 'very', 'interesting', 'feel', 'DVD', 'quite', 'soul', 'stirring', 'heart', 'warming', 'experience', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'inside', 'as', 'well', 'outside', 'must', 'Enya', 'fan', 'countless', 'music', 'concert', 'DVD', 'own', 'simplicity', 'beauty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'personal', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'DVD']",N/A
