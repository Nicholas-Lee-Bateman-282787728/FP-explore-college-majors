1041901,A18D0R137EYS6C,B000LXS6H0,Clinton Enlow,"[21, 24]","So on the same day The Departed hits shelves American audiences finally recieve the original Hong Kong trilogy on DVD. So is it worth the purchase. Definitely in my opinion but don't watch it if you're interested in seeing The Departed. I like Scorsese's adaptation good enough (not enough to call it best picture of the year which it will probably walk away with {at which point does he credit the original filmmakers with his first oscar}) but watching this series before hand it took away some of the suprises that were relevant in that film.So how are these films not compared to their American counterpart? Well the first one hits all the right notes as suprisingly slick an intelligent thriller. I don't get all of the religious ideas that the filmmakers used in writing the script but you can't deny the power of the filmmaking and writing put forth. Theres a nice back and forth and when the suprises that ruined The Departed they are rather well timed for the perfect emotional payoff. The acting is great, and I didn't even mind the comic relief from Chapman To as one of the gangsters. And to bolster the acting writing that makes the characters deeper than they'd be in a lesser film. I will also say the darker ending in which things don't go as planned for the hero also gets higher marks in my book.Infernal Affairs II is a prequel that was made directly after the original showing how the policeman was recruited to be a mole and spy on his uncle, a mobster trying to hide his doings and avenge the murder of his father by Mob boss Sam and the soon to be police mole Ming. Theres was a lot that I loved in this film making me overlook the faults, mainly that it went on a little too long and could be overly dramatic at times. Joining the cast for this outing Carina Lau is great as wife of mob boss Sam who's the secret love of Ming and in love with Anthony Wong. And Francis Ng is just excellent as the villain of the film. This was the first film I noticed him in and I've been a fan ever since in films like The Mission or Exiled.Infernal Affairs III. I won't say much about this one as doing so would spoil events in part one. Just to say it involves a character surviving from the first one who's deceit is driving him slowly insane. Again this film goes on too long and was melodramatic in places, but the writing was so good and the characters so interesting that in my opinion this little craveat didn't bother me as much as it would others. Excellent additions to the cast include Leon Lai as a shadowy cop who might be another triad mole, and Hero's Chen Dao Ming playing a mainland gangster who in flashbacks was scene to be setting up business with Eric Tsangs Sam and in the present is seen as shadow character whose motivations aren't known.Anyway to wrap this up as I feel I've gone into ramble mode. This is a real good series that entertained the hell out of me. I haven't seen The Dragon Dynasty release, but everything here is good enough to warrant a look from fans of the Scorsese film are fans of Hong Kong films in general.",5,Infernal Affairs Trilogy,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,3063,"['So', 'same', 'day', 'Departed', 'shelves', 'American', 'audiences', 'finally', 'recieve', 'original', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'trilogy', 'DVD', 'So', 'purchase', 'Definitely', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'Departed', 'Scorsese', 'adaptation', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'enough', 'call', 'best', 'picture', 'year', 'will', 'probably', 'walk', 'away', 'point', 'credit', 'original', 'filmmakers', 'first', 'oscar', 'watching', 'series', 'hand', 'took', 'away', 'suprises', 'were', 'relevant', 'film.So', 'how', 'are', 'films', 'not', 'compared', 'American', 'counterpart', 'Well', 'first', 'one', 'right', 'notes', 'suprisingly', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'religious', 'ideas', 'filmmakers', 'used', 'writing', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'power', 'filmmaking', 'writing', 'put', 'forth', 'nice', 'back', 'forth', 'when', 'suprises', 'ruined', 'Departed', 'are', 'rather', 'well', 'timed', 'perfect', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'acting', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'comic', 'relief', 'Chapman', 'one', 'gangsters', 'bolster', 'acting', 'writing', 'characters', 'deeper', ""'d"", 'be', 'lesser', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'darker', 'ending', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'hero', 'also', 'higher', 'marks', 'book.Infernal', 'Affairs', 'II', 'prequel', 'was', 'made', 'directly', 'original', 'showing', 'how', 'policeman', 'was', 'recruited', 'be', 'mole', 'spy', 'uncle', 'mobster', 'trying', 'hide', 'doings', 'avenge', 'murder', 'father', 'Mob', 'boss', 'Sam', 'soon', 'be', 'police', 'mole', 'Ming', 'Theres', 'was', 'lot', 'loved', 'film', 'making', 'faults', 'mainly', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'could', 'be', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'times', 'Joining', 'cast', 'outing', 'Carina', 'Lau', 'great', 'wife', 'mob', 'boss', 'Sam', 'who', 'secret', 'love', 'Ming', 'love', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'Francis', 'Ng', 'just', 'excellent', 'villain', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'noticed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'ever', 'films', 'Mission', 'Exiled.Infernal', 'Affairs', 'III', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'one', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'spoil', 'events', 'part', 'one', 'Just', 'say', 'character', 'surviving', 'first', 'one', 'who', 'deceit', 'driving', 'slowly', 'insane', 'Again', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'melodramatic', 'places', 'writing', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'characters', 'so', 'interesting', 'opinion', 'little', 'craveat', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'others', 'Excellent', 'additions', 'cast', 'include', 'Leon', 'Lai', 'shadowy', 'cop', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'triad', 'mole', 'Hero', 'Chen', 'Dao', 'Ming', 'playing', 'mainland', 'gangster', 'who', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'scene', 'be', 'setting', 'up', 'business', 'Eric', 'Tsangs', 'Sam', 'present', 'seen', 'shadow', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', ""n't"", 'known.Anyway', 'wrap', 'up', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'ramble', 'mode', 'real', 'good', 'series', 'entertained', 'hell', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'release', 'everything', 'here', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'look', 'fans', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'are', 'fans', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'films', 'general']",The Infernal Affairs Trilogy Infernal Affairs 1 / Infernal Affairs 2 / Infernal Affairs 3

It's a nonstop beating to the brain.  There are so many messages in Part One.Part Two which was explained heavily in the press before its release is about how venal and callow the youth are who join the triad are - but there's an unspoken message - how is it possible integrity-wise for the son of the triad to want to join the force.  If you were true police, really honorable, you don't go near them if you aren't clean and cleared.  You don't glom on.Part Thee surprisingly is awesome because I was never a fan of Leon Lai but I was for this film and havent seen him in anything since.  I loved that in some death fantasy (funereal blue cords abound in this film as if we were in some Mulholland Drive type of dream), the hero of Part One is validated by Mainland and higher up Hong Kong police.But given Part Two's origin story of the &#34;hero&#34;  this could just be the grandiose fantasy of some scion of crime wanting something that doesnt belong to him.
