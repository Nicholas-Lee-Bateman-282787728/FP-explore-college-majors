But I ordered this video because of all the reviews about how it works on relaxation and stretching along with cardio. And it is amazing! I love it! It starts you out slow and it gets your heart rate up without killing you. And then it incorporates a lot of perfect pregnancy work outs and stretches that make me feel so great after the it is over. I also never feel bored or ready for it to be over before it is. The pace is really well suited for pregnant women and allows you to get the max or the min from the work out, whatever kind of work out you are looking for that day. I also think that Erin is a fabulous trainer. She talks to you and motivates you throughout the video. She also throws in some things here and there about what is important to remember when you're working out when pregnant and how to keep yourself safe and healthy.

Mangan,"[40, 41]","I'm a second time mommy-to-be who still runs and regularly does yoga and other prenatal workouts - I thought this workout would be easy but I was pleasantly surprised! The leg work (inner thigh and derriere) is especially good, and I find my muscles are still sore (in a good way) the following day. There is not nearly as much arm work as Karyne Steben's ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout,"" so I alternate them. True, the electronic version of ""Frere Jacques"" that plays during the menu is grating, but the music during the workout is barely noticeable. I love the length of the workout, too - it's 40 minutes broken up into warmup, dynamic movement, floor work, and stretch and relaxation sections.Other reviewers don't like the ""homemade"" feel of the production, but I do - Erin O'Brien is down to earth (no makeup, incorporates time for water and bathroom breaks), not overly peppy, but still encouraging and upbeat. She's also challenging - I find a lot of these prenatal workouts too coddling, I like being pushed. I found myself in a great mood after finishing this.I have mentioned this in other reviews of pre- and postnatal workouts, but I have had two very easy pregnancies (so far) and a very easy first delivery and recovery. Two doctors attributed that to my exercise pre-, during, and postpregnancy. I am determined to exercise as much as I can for this pregnancy, too (my little guy seems to like it, too). Mommies to be - get out there and exercise! You will be so grateful you did!

For fitness videos, before purchase (unless it's under $10), I recommend either finding a clip on the Internet, or borrowing it from the library before purchase.  This one is one that I'm definitely glad I tried it before I bought it.I""m sensitive to production.  One thing I like about my workout videos is being able to feel like I'm almost mirroring the person doing the video.  This was immediately impossible with this video, as that their were schizophrenic cuts between even just one extension movement - home video to grainy film close-up to silhouette front shot - all in 5 seconds.  I found this kind of production destabilizing when I was trying to balance.The movements were also a little to quick to start at first. I take a bit of time to warm-up and get moving, and I felt like I was just being launched straight into needing to move quickly.I wasn't impressed with this video at all, and returned it to my library as soon as I watched it.  It may be something that suits other people who can get past the production value, and like the instant intensity, but if you're like me, definitely check out a few clips or try the video from the library before you buy it.",2,Distracting Production,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1263,"['was', 'skeptical', 'video', 'so', 'actually', 'borrowed', 'local', 'library', 'fitness', 'videos', 'purchase', '10', 'recommend', 'finding', 'clip', 'Internet', 'borrowing', 'library', 'purchase', 'one', 'one', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'glad', 'tried', 'bought', 'it.I', 'm', 'sensitive', 'production', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'workout', 'videos', 'being', 'able', 'feel', ""'m"", 'almost', 'mirroring', 'person', 'doing', 'video', 'was', 'immediately', 'impossible', 'video', 'were', 'schizophrenic', 'cuts', 'even', 'just', 'one', 'extension', 'movement', 'home', 'video', 'grainy', 'film', 'close-up', 'silhouette', 'front', 'shot', '5', 'seconds', 'found', 'kind', 'production', 'destabilizing', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'balance.The', 'movements', 'were', 'also', 'little', 'quick', 'start', 'first', 'take', 'bit', 'time', 'warm-up', 'get', 'moving', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'launched', 'straight', 'needing', 'move', 'quickly.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'video', 'returned', 'library', 'as', 'soon', 'watched', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'suits', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'production', 'value', 'instant', 'intensity', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'few', 'clips', 'try', 'video', 'library', 'buy']",COMPLETE PREGNANCY FITNESS

I just wanted more of a workout, especially in the beginning. Oh and I never used the postnatal workout.  I tried it once and just turned it off.

1060969,A3KUH4O2S6EEEG,B000NVKZWY,Texi,"[1, 1]","This is my favorite prenatal workout.  It actually gets me moving around a bit.  I'm not the super athletic type, but I've found most other prenatal workouts are downright wimpy by comparison when it comes to cardio, even for my standards.The main 40-minute workout for Complete Pregnancy Fitness starts with an energetic warm-up and then moves to a ""Dynamic Movement"" section that really gets the heart-rate going (but not overdoing it) while keeping everything low impact.  Lots of lunges, squats, and some ballet movements that I found unique and fun.  These are interspersed with some strength training for the arms.  There is a brief section for floor work (on all fours or lying on your side, never on your back), followed by a stretch and relaxation segment.  Other things worth noting:- Erin is great about explaining good posture and form with each movement.  Very important in keeping yourself and the baby safe.- It is what it claims:  a complete workout.  A lot of emphasis is placed on core work and balance as you work other areas of your body at the same time.- Challenging yet safe for all three trimesters.- All exercises utilize furniture you'd find in your living room (coffee table, chair, couch, wall) as opposed to using weights.  This is great... unless you are working out in a home gym instead of a living room, in which case you'll have to get creative.- My only real complaint about this dvd is the music:  elevator music style nursery songs set to a beat, which, half the time, is not in sync with the workout.  The good news is it's not very loud, so you can almost tune it out.  The workout itself is so good that I consider this nothing more than a minor irritation.The 20-minute partner workout looks fun and challenging, not to mention a great way to bond with the baby's father. :)  I'll admit I haven't gotten around to doing it because I always get such a great workout from the main section, but it is nice to have the option.I LOVE that there is a postnatal workout included as well.  Will post a review on this once I have a chance to use it.UPDATE:  I tried the postnatal workout several weeks after delivery, and I HIGHLY recommend it, as it helps you safely ease your way back into exercise.  It's broken down into 3 progressive segments, all of which help to rehabilitate your muscles (especially abdominal). It only takes 15 minutes a day, and once you've mastered the third segment, you can feel safe in moving on to ""real"" workouts again. :)",5,The ONLY prenatal workout that makes me sweat!,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2487,"['favorite', 'prenatal', 'workout', 'actually', 'moving', 'around', 'bit', ""'m"", 'not', 'super', 'athletic', 'type', ""'ve"", 'found', 'most', 'other', 'prenatal', 'workouts', 'are', 'downright', 'wimpy', 'comparison', 'when', 'cardio', 'even', 'standards.The', 'main', '40-minute', 'workout', 'Complete', 'Pregnancy', 'Fitness', 'energetic', 'warm-up', 'then', 'moves', 'Dynamic', 'Movement', 'section', 'really', 'heart-rate', 'going', 'not', 'overdoing', 'keeping', 'everything', 'low', 'impact', 'Lots', 'lunges', 'squats', 'ballet', 'movements', 'found', 'unique', 'fun', 'are', 'interspersed', 'strength', 'training', 'arms', 'brief', 'section', 'floor', 'work', 'fours', 'lying', 'side', 'never', 'back', 'followed', 'stretch', 'relaxation', 'segment', 'Other', 'things', 'worth', 'noting', 'Erin', 'great', 'explaining', 'good', 'posture', 'form', 'movement', 'Very', 'important', 'keeping', 'baby', 'safe.-', 'what', 'complete', 'workout', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'core', 'work', 'balance', 'work', 'other', 'areas', 'body', 'same', 'time.-', 'Challenging', 'yet', 'safe', 'three', 'trimesters.-', 'exercises', 'utilize', 'furniture', ""'d"", 'find', 'living', 'room', 'coffee', 'table', 'chair', 'couch', 'wall', 'opposed', 'using', 'weights', 'great', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'home', 'gym', 'instead', 'living', 'room', 'case', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'creative.-', 'My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'dvd', 'music', 'elevator', 'music', 'style', 'nursery', 'songs', 'set', 'beat', 'time', 'not', 'sync', 'workout', 'good', 'news', 'not', 'very', 'loud', 'can', 'almost', 'tune', 'out', 'workout', 'so', 'good', 'consider', 'nothing', 'more', 'minor', 'irritation.The', '20-minute', 'partner', 'fun', 'challenging', 'not', 'mention', 'great', 'way', 'bond', 'baby', 'father', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'doing', 'always', 'get', 'such', 'great', 'workout', 'main', 'section', 'nice', 'have', 'option.I', 'LOVE', 'postnatal', 'workout', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'Will', 'post', 'review', 'once', 'have', 'chance', 'use', 'it.UPDATE', 'tried', 'postnatal', 'several', 'weeks', 'delivery', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'safely', 'ease', 'way', 'back', 'exercise', 'broken', 'down', '3', 'progressive', 'segments', 'help', 'rehabilitate', 'muscles', 'especially', 'abdominal', 'only', '15', 'minutes', 'day', 'once', ""'ve"", 'mastered', 'third', 'segment', 'can', 'feel', 'safe', 'moving', 'real', 'workouts', 'again']",COMPLETE PREGNANCY FITNESS
