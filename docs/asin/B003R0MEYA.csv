1359517,A3PFKE8EFXAXQE,B003R0MEYA,"cornbreadthedog ""larue""","[0, 0]","I loved the original 'V' mini-series from the 1980's!Sure,it didn't have a big fancy-shmancy multimillion dollar budget and didn't have an all-star cast; but 'V' rocked and still holds up some 30 years later! Dude, I was so excited that ABC television was going to do a reboot/remake of the old iconic series!However, this updated version is nowhere as near as fun or exciting as the original series from the '80's. In the original 'V' television mini-series, there was an actual war going on! There was battles against the ""visitors"" over land and sea,in the streets, in parking lots,on city rooftops,in hospitals,on horseback, and on country-sides. It really felt like a epic struggle against an invading alien force that's deeply imbedded with our political and social structure!Sadly, V:THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is just a bunch of endless talk with very little action. With the advancement of special effects nowadays, when compared to the original series, I was totally looking for epic battles and to see beloved cast members to die off heroically defending earth from the ""visitors"" every single episode. Unfortunately, for me, a single solitary episode of this second season felt like hours of my life had gone by and I was getting ever closer and closer to my first social security check; even though I'm only 36 years away from being eligible.Come to think of it, the story-telling of this second (and final season) of 'V' kept on reminding me and reminding me of another ABC t.v. show, LOST. LOST wasted an obscene amount of screen time with building up the show's likeable and memorable characters but then turned around and ruined it all with a lot of endless talking and island walking that never ever went anywhere. 'V:THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON' is just more of the same. I actually kept falling asleep on a lot of the episodes because there was just all this endless talking. Please hang onto this series if you suffer from insomnia because it's way cheaper than sleeping pills.Surprisingly,I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever with the casting. Although, there should have really been at least a dozen 5TH COLUMN fighters. Okay, we had the main four protagonists:the mercenary, the F.B.I. agent, the priest, and the ""visitor"" whose now on our side fighting for our Earth. Yet, there should have been more minor 5TH COLUMN characters dying alongside the pivotal four as the series went on. Each death could and should have inspired the 5TH COLUMN to more action and to be involved in more fire-fights/missions.At least it would have been something!Again, it's the painfully dialogue-heavy writing, the horrifically slow pacing, and the total absence of actual action in a tale about insidious global occupation that robs this show of having a continued place in my DVD collection!After watching the first season of this rebooted version, I was very curious and wanted to see where this second season was headed. It cost me $16, a trip to my  local mailbox service, and 12 hours of my life, and 7 recharges on my portable DVD player.A shame that AMAZON.COM doesn't have customer support resolutions option for that.",2,A NICE TRY BUT THE ORIGINAL 'V' SERIES HAD WAY MORE ACTION &  WAY MORE ADVENTURE THAN THIS!,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,3139,"['loved', 'original', 'V', 'mini-series', '1980', 'Sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'fancy-shmancy', 'multimillion', 'dollar', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'all-star', 'cast', 'V', 'rocked', 'still', '30', 'years', 'later', 'Dude', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'ABC', 'television', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'reboot/remake', 'old', 'iconic', 'series', 'However', 'updated', 'version', 'nowhere', 'as', 'fun', 'exciting', 'original', 'series', ""'80"", 'original', 'V', 'television', 'mini-series', 'was', 'actual', 'war', 'going', 'was', 'battles', 'visitors', 'land', 'sea', 'streets', 'parking', 'lots', 'city', 'rooftops', 'hospitals', 'horseback', 'country-sides', 'really', 'felt', 'epic', 'struggle', 'invading', 'alien', 'force', 'deeply', 'imbedded', 'political', 'social', 'structure', 'Sadly', 'V', 'COMPLETE', 'SECOND', 'SEASON', 'just', 'bunch', 'endless', 'talk', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'advancement', 'special', 'effects', 'nowadays', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'totally', 'looking', 'epic', 'battles', 'see', 'beloved', 'cast', 'members', 'die', 'off', 'heroically', 'defending', 'earth', 'visitors', 'single', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'single', 'solitary', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'felt', 'like', 'hours', 'life', 'had', 'gone', 'was', 'getting', 'ever', 'closer', 'closer', 'first', 'social', 'security', 'check', 'even', ""'m"", 'only', '36', 'years', 'away', 'being', 'eligible.Come', 'think', 'story-telling', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'V', 'kept', 'reminding', 'reminding', 'ABC', 't.v', 'show', 'LOST', 'LOST', 'wasted', 'obscene', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'show', 'likeable', 'memorable', 'characters', 'then', 'turned', 'around', 'ruined', 'lot', 'endless', 'talking', 'island', 'walking', 'never', 'ever', 'went', 'anywhere', 'V', 'COMPLETE', 'SECOND', 'SEASON', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'actually', 'kept', 'falling', 'asleep', 'lot', 'episodes', 'was', 'just', 'endless', 'talking', 'Please', 'hang', 'series', 'suffer', 'insomnia', 'way', 'cheaper', 'sleeping', 'pills.Surprisingly', 'have', 'absolutely', 'complaints', 'whatsoever', 'casting', 'should', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'least', 'dozen', '5TH', 'COLUMN', 'fighters', 'Okay', 'had', 'main', 'four', 'protagonists', 'mercenary', 'F.B.I', 'agent', 'priest', 'visitor', 'now', 'side', 'fighting', 'Earth', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'minor', '5TH', 'COLUMN', 'characters', 'dying', 'pivotal', 'four', 'series', 'went', 'death', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'inspired', '5TH', 'COLUMN', 'more', 'action', 'be', 'involved', 'more', 'fire-fights/missions.At', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'Again', 'painfully', 'dialogue-heavy', 'writing', 'horrifically', 'slow', 'pacing', 'total', 'absence', 'actual', 'action', 'tale', 'insidious', 'global', 'occupation', 'show', 'having', 'continued', 'place', 'DVD', 'collection', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'rebooted', 'version', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'wanted', 'see', 'where', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'headed', 'cost', '16', 'trip', 'local', 'mailbox', 'service', '12', 'hours', 'life', '7', 'recharges', 'portable', 'DVD', 'player.A', 'shame', 'AMAZON.COM', ""n't"", 'have', 'customer', 'support', 'resolutions', 'option']",V: Season 2

The second season dragged. I accidentally watched the last episode for S2 and I thought I had actually watched the season 2 premier. Everything you needed to know was in that last season. It was like it picked up right off the last season of season 1. I can't imagine watching all of the other episodes in between. Here's why:First, season 1 built up the premise that yeah, humans are stupid and politically and emotionally motivated morons who allow their saviors (the V) to infiltrate and amass a virtual gestapo surveillance operation right in front of them. Nothing our heroes do can match the V's counter intelligence and thus, they were always one step ahead of the good guys--for the whole season. The good guys did get a bomb off and destroyed the queens babies, but that was pretty much it.Enter Season 2. From what I can gather, after watching the last episode, nothing much happens between the end of season 1 and the end of season 2. It must have moved very slowly. Too slowly with the same ""V"" out maneuver humans theme. Ok enough, we get it. We don't need 13 more episodes of season one--move to another theme already.Spoiler Alert!Season 2 ends with our heroin being abducted by--FINALLY--the good guys, ""Earth's last great hope."" This is an underground brain center where earths finest have been monitoring the V--unknown to the V--wow really, finally? I can't wait for Season 3. Finally we're going to get out of the aliens beat humans in every way, politically, intelligence gathering, technology, etc., to some type of conflict and strategy oriented season. It should be interesting.I can only imagine how boring season two was, except for the last episode. From what I can understand, it was simply an extension of season 1 without any new information about anything.

I thought Jane Badler was the most beautiful woman in the world when I was a child (which was when I first saw it).  When the series was remade, I was concerned that it wouldn't be as good.  At first, I wasn't impressed, but as it progressed I began to appreciate it.  The original is still my favorite, but I like this one too.I was really excited about Season 2, particularly when Jane Badler made her appearance.  She is older--but she is still sexy! Of course, while I liked the idea of her being Anna's mother, I found it frustrating that her role was so passive for so long.  Season 2 was much more exciting, and the plot development was really interesting! As time went on, it didn't even really need Jane Badler to make it exciting--though I still was upset about the finale in regards to her character.It is a shame the series was cancelled just when it was getting really juicy, but I am glad to have the DVDs.  As for the DVDs themselves, I was pleased that they came in a good package.  I don't like the ""paper"" type of sets the original and Final Battle came in.

We start to learn a lot more about the V's this season including exactly what they look like under their human skin. This season also marks the return of Jane Badler from the original as Diana. She plays the mother of Anna and the scenes between them are awesome. Mark Salling from the original V also appears in the finale, leaving his role open for season 3.

1359530,AZMMN9R6QIL0Y,B003R0MEYA,Jeffrey R. Charles,"[2, 2]","In my opinion, this version of V was no match for the 1983-1984 version. The new series is twice as long, and less happened between fewer characters. The show can hold your attention, but when each episode was over, I found myself thinking: ""I spent an hour on this?""Most of the story seemed to be told among 4 or 5 resistance fighters huddled in a basement hideout than in scenes that showed much of the population at large. One reason for the so-so rating is how many hours of viewing time it takes for so little story. Sometimes shorter is better.This version had graphic violence that didn't contribute to the story. Most of this was V-lizards biting each other (and people when they felt like it) on the neck with their 100 plus needle like teeth that were reminiscent of teeth in a barracuda or in the evil clown in Stephen King's ""It"". It doesn't make sense that the lizards would bite others to kill them, when they have immolation guns and other sophisticated weapons that don't require struggling in close quarters.The lizard hidden under human skin in the new V's had an unrealistic anatomy. The multiple rows of long V-lizard needle teeth take up so much of their head that the area remaining for a brain was maybe 1/4 the size of a human brain at best. This is not consistent with the V's technical development. The old version V-lizard was more believable, even if the effects were 1980's.There wasn't mouse eating, but a rat and a deer were on the menu. People are not on the menu in the new version, but the lizards eat their partner after mating. The lizard queen also uses her teeth to take a bite out of who she thinks are perpetrators of crime or sedition. The V-lizards are after human DNA to enhance their own through inter-breeding with humans, then plan to destroy the human race after they get what they want.There is a mystical telepathic mind control called ""bliss"" that Anna, the Lizard Queen uses to control her fellow lizards and some people. However, this does not add to the story, and seems an overly simplistic way of showing how she controls her subjects, and its mechanism for addiction and mind control isn't explained.Promising sub-plots like using potential biological agents against the V's are introduced, but then are either just dropped, are not adequately followed up, or are foiled due to lack of foresight, leaving the show too simplistic for the amount of one's time it takes to watch.All to often, we're back to seeing leaders of the 5th Column resistance network in their basement hideout, wondering what to do next. None of them seem to have much attention to detail, so the evil V lizard queen Anna can easily foil their plans.The story also relies heavily on what a few 5th Column leaders say is happening to the population at large, but other scenes don't adequately support it. For example, in season 1, the leaders say the Visitors are gaining the ""devotion"" of people all over the world, but this is conveyed only in conversations between the lead characters, and is not fleshed out much in other less often seen characters or extras.Some footage for characters in foreign cities looked two dimensional, as though just a few actors were in front of a rear projection screen of background buildings. The foreground and background lighting just didn't seem to match, and it was distracting as a result. Sort of a low budget look. The floors some people were standing on in the space ship didn't look real either.A certain scene of a shuttle arriving at the mother ship seemed be used over and over again. There were also some props, including those for oddly positioned bodies, that seemed to show up so often they might as well have been given names. As far as tech, the new V's have flying fragmentation devices and Immolation suicide pills, but the former is reminiscent of disintegrating aliens in the 1967 TV series ""The Invaders"".The female V-lizards also have long tails, but the strength of the tail (the thin tail could lift the V's own weight up to over the V's head) didn't seem realistic. The female lizards were able to casually run a person through or otherwise quickly dispatch them with their tails, but in the story, the she-lizards would conveniently forget that they had this capability, so they;d fail to turn on their pursuers and use their tails when being pursued by the main characters.The series was slow and plodding (and often boring) due to frequent emphasis on the emotional baggage of some characters. I'm not sure why this baggage stuff got to be the norm for scripts over the last couple of decades, since it doubles the length of time it takes to tell a given story. These are fictional characters after all, and the copious time it takes to watch the emotional baggage of characters on TV would better be spent interacting with real people in the real world.In this series, it was also fairly predictable when a character was going to get knocked off, and how it was going to happen. The same predictability was true of when a character would betray the others.  There is a lot of hostage taking to manipulate characters, and the resistance against the V's is more like small scale terrorism than organized world wide freedom fighting.  This aspect is reminiscent of the movie ""Red Dawn"", but is not as well done as in Red Dawn.The ending was very ambiguous and probably the worst part of the story. Way too many loose ends. For example, humans had just become susceptible to lizard bliss, lizard queen Anna was for the first time smiling a smile of joy and showing emotion rather than a cold and sinister smile, and it was hard to tell if the swarm of V ships were coming or going in the final scene.Ideally, this V series would have made a follow up 2-hour show to tie up loose ends.  Even if the follow up never aired and was sold only on DVD and on demand, it would make the series seem complete, and tie up the loose ends, much like the movie ""Ark of Truth"" tied up loose ends after the end of the Stargate SG-1 series.Fortunately, there were two areas where the plot of V was interesting or promising:One was how Diana (the lizard queen from the original series, who was imprisoned by her daughter Anna, the lizard queen in the new series) seemed to understand what the human soul was, but Anna was totally clueless, thinking that the soul was something that could be removed surgically, while leaving the human being alive and intact. Some reviews said that the Diana in this series is not the Diana in the previous series, but it seems clear that she is the same Diana, because she discussed having cut short a previous invasion of earth.Anna was equally clueless when talking to priests. One disappointing part was that the story shows the leadership of the Catholic church caving to Anna's intimidation in a matter of hours, portraying the priests as not even considering how God might fit into the situation, or even consulting Him in prayer for that matter. This could have been more interesting if the writers had better insight into such things.The other promising area was the possibility that Diana (who wanted peace with the human race in the new series) could return to power and forge peaceful coexistence with the human race. This was only briefly visited, and the story cut off this avenue for Diana.If Diana had been left in the story, the vast, unexplored subject of making and keeping the peace between V's and humans in a ""post war"" situation (one analogous to many real world situations) could have been explored in subsequent seasons.  This would have let the V series evolve into something that could be taken seriously. (Maybe it still could, if Diana can be salvaged via high tech medicine like one of the medical doctors who had presumably been killed was.)Much of the acting seemed flat, but a notable and consistent exception was the superb acting by Morena Baccarin, who plays the evil lizard Queen Anna. She put on such a strong performance that she became the Lizard Queen one loved to hate. It reminded me of the powerful performance by Richard Crenna as the ruthless Colonel Skimmerhorn in the 1970's TV series ""Centennial"", where he was the Colonel one loved to hate.In V, Anna runs the gamut from calmly saying she will eviscerate some of her enemies, or ""my eggs need nourishment"" (before predictably having her mate for lunch), to screaming in grief over a loss of eggs, to rehearsing how to cry crocodile tears (good term for a lizard!) to manipulate a widow. There is some really good acting there. Too bad the rest of the series didn't measure up. I'd have rated it higher if it wasn't as long compared to its story content.",3,Not as consistent as original V series.

1359532,A2XD1IYPRTS0O5,B003R0MEYA,Joel Kovacik,"[0, 0]","""V"" is the type of riveting, suspense-laden sci-fi drama you could plop down in an easy chair to begin watching -- and theoretically remain seated in, until the series' conclusion (presumably ten years later, if need be).Show stealer Morena Baccarin, as the two-faced, reptilian Queen Anna, and leader of the invading Visitors, is one of the most attractively compelling, deliciously evil villains ever to appear on screen. Presenting before the people of Earth an inscrutable mask of gift-bestowing benevolence, we, the audience, quickly come to realize that behind her human facade is a merciless killer, embarked on a death-dealing mission to conquer our world and annihilate mankind.Actors Joel Gretsch, Logan Huffman (and Elizabeth Mitchell, in particular) do a brilliant job lending sincerity and credulity to a storyline admittedly fraught with logic-defying implausibilities, yet, at the same time, abounding in the kind of compensatory plot twists that'll make you smile appreciatively each and every time they hit you squarely over the head.Beautiful settings and realistic special effects (as adjuncts, rather than centerpieces in themselves), go a long way toward adding to the luster of ""V"".  And, as a precious little lagniappe, actress Jane Badler (erstwhile iniquitous leader of the Visitors back in 1984) reappears in a surprisingly unexpected role.Note:  Get your ABC voodoo doll primed and ready to stick pins into, because at the end of Season II -- after a cliff-hanging episode that will literally have you SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER for Season III, the network bigwigs -- to their utter disgrace (and hopefully to their eternal damnation) -- canceled the series.",5,"Brilliant (""Popcorn"") Matinee Fare!",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,1682,"['V', 'type', 'riveting', 'suspense-laden', 'sci-fi', 'drama', 'could', 'plop', 'down', 'easy', 'chair', 'begin', 'watching', 'theoretically', 'remain', 'seated', 'series', 'conclusion', 'presumably', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'need', 'be', '.Show', 'stealer', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'two-faced', 'reptilian', 'Queen', 'Anna', 'leader', 'invading', 'Visitors', 'one', 'most', 'attractively', 'compelling', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'villains', 'ever', 'appear', 'screen', 'Presenting', 'people', 'Earth', 'inscrutable', 'mask', 'gift-bestowing', 'benevolence', 'audience', 'quickly', 'come', 'realize', 'human', 'facade', 'merciless', 'killer', 'embarked', 'death-dealing', 'mission', 'conquer', 'world', 'annihilate', 'mankind.Actors', 'Joel', 'Gretsch', 'Logan', 'Huffman', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'particular', 'do', 'brilliant', 'job', 'lending', 'sincerity', 'credulity', 'storyline', 'admittedly', 'fraught', 'logic-defying', 'implausibilities', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'abounding', 'kind', 'compensatory', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'make', 'smile', 'appreciatively', 'time', 'hit', 'squarely', 'head.Beautiful', 'settings', 'realistic', 'special', 'effects', 'adjuncts', 'rather', 'centerpieces', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'adding', 'luster', 'V', 'precious', 'little', 'lagniappe', 'actress', 'Jane', 'Badler', 'erstwhile', 'iniquitous', 'leader', 'Visitors', 'back', '1984', 'surprisingly', 'unexpected', 'role.Note', 'Get', 'ABC', 'voodoo', 'doll', 'primed', 'ready', 'stick', 'pins', 'end', 'Season', 'II', 'cliff-hanging', 'episode', 'will', 'literally', 'have', 'SCREAMING', 'BLOODY', 'MURDER', 'Season', 'III', 'network', 'bigwigs', 'utter', 'disgrace', 'hopefully', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'canceled', 'series']",V: Season 2

Despite the immense cliffhanger, Season 2 is FAR superior to Season 1 and has tremendous replay value.  This is one of those shows like ""Firefly"" that got cancelled only to discover just how much of a cult following it had.  The episodes look great and make an excellent addition to my collection.

The only problem i have with this is that it is very different from the original series.  For example, V- the first season said that when anna found out about the hybrid baby she said she thought it wasn't possible and in the beginning of season 2(which they brought back diana, which is great) diana also thought it wasn't possible for humans andVs to have a baby.  That didn't make sense because in the original series, it was diana that had the V(Brian)to sleep with Robin Maxwell, which produced ""elizabeth"".  That's just one example.  But this series is still really great.  I was thrilled to see Marc Singer at the season 2 finale.  He said he was leader of project aries to save humanity.  It was neat to see that Erica's bosses, who acted like they were trying to destroy her, which turns out they were just making sure she could be trusted to join project aries.  I just wish that Marc singer would have come back as ""mike dovovan"" instead of ""Lars""  I hope how season 2 ended isn't as it seems. Don't want to give too much away.  It would be great if they brought back Faye Grant ""julie parish"", Frank Ashmore ""philip"", Jennifer Cook ""elizabeth"".  I can't wait for season 3 to premiere.

Well it ended all right, abruptly, and with viewers hanging. This is not ""justice to the original series"".I'm surprised this series on DVD makes a ranking of any kind.
