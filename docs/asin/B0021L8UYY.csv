It's a remake of the original ""Stepfather"" film that came out a couple decades ago. It's about a teenage kid who has problems with a stepfather who's secretly a killer. That's basically the main point of the film. The whole film doesn't really get intense until the ending, with occasionally a little sprinkling of thrills before the first hour, but all we get is a little sprinkling. I'll give this film 1 and a half stars though, because the ending is pretty intense and full of action, which was pretty good, but the altogether outcome of the ending, I didn't like. Another thing was that I saw the director's cut, which didn't have that swinging chainsaw thing, which was always in the trailers. It looked kinda creepy.

The story of a family where the mother remarries  and the guy ends up becoming a psychotic killer had so many chills and thrills.  Everything about it just worked.  Here we have a remake of that film.  There are a lot of terrible reviews here and if comparing it to the original they are indeed justified.  But it can be looked at for its own merits.  It's like a grade B thriller and Dylan Walsh does a pretty good job as the creepy stepfather.  Certainly no O'Quinn but still good.  Sela Ward adds a certain intelligent naivite to the mother and is fine.  The true star of this film though is Penn Badgley as the suspicious son.  It was a suspicious daughter in the original and the switch up works.  The way the film is directed pretty much shows that a film of the caliber of the original wasn't really being looked for.  Emphasis is on Badgley and his girlfriend.  The house has a pool and both stars are attractive and we get lots of bathing suit scenes.  Definitelty B horror level stuff.But there is some suspense and surprises.  If you like any of the stars you will like the film.  The blu ray has excelent video with strong crispness and clarity.  Colors are strong and pop with flesh tones very realistic.  Black/white ration is also good.  Audio works well too with dialogue strong and present and surround speakers put to good use for the chills and suspense.  I am a huge fan of the original and am looking at this film for what it is.  And as a light suspense film with likable stars and excellent presentation on blu ray I can recommend it.  Just know what you are getting.

E Jackson,"[2, 3]","The Stepfather is a typically suspenseful film about a father who happens to notice a mother with two boys at a local supermarket, and immediately connects with the woman prompting the two of them to quickly get involved with each other.  Soon after, the guy moves into the family's home. Little does the family know the guy has a dreaded dark history of being a psychotic killer.Soon however, the children (an older teenage boy with college plans along with his younger brother) begin to notice something is not quite right with their new stepfather which leads to immediate confusion and questioning, and a need to look after themselves more carefully.The build-up is pretty standard fare. The stepfather kills a few ""problems"" along the way, which of course temporarily upsets the family and friends... but the killing continues to take place around the house until well, you know. I don't want to spoil what eventually happens (though you probably already know without even having to WATCH it).  I guess the only surprise is that the real father plays more of a role than I thought he would.  He makes a few appearances.  Oh, and the older brothers blonde girlfriend is the hottest girl ever, haha.The only major problem is that the final showdown is pretty lackluster and melodramatic.

The PG-13 editions are frequently watered down, family-lite versions of their superior R-rated predecessors. But take the case of 1987's The Stepfather, a slow, dark, sleepy drama about the conflict between a 16-year-old girl and her new stepfather, a murderous sociopath who preys on families. Even with its gruesome premise, the original was not really a horror film. It wasn't even that suspenseful. There were only two onscreen deaths, and not a whole hell of a lot of tension to speak of. Some haters might disagree, but this reboot actually improves on its predecessor. As the new father figure, Dylan Walsh really ups the ante. His creepy, passive/aggressive affability really gets under your skin. Penn Badgely from Gossip Girl is the son who's just returned from military school. Amber Heard (All the Girls Love Mandy Lane, Zombieland) plays his supremely irritating girlfriend whose only saving grace is that she spends 90% of her screen time in a bikini. The Stepfather is by no means a perfect film, but if you're into breezy escapism like Disturbia or The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, it can definitely work its magic if the timing is right!

One good thing that this movie has going for it is that the main character's girlfriend played by Amber Heard is really hot and is in a bikini or underwear for at least 75% of the scenes she's in.

While the original did not rely on blood and gore to win over the audience, the implied violence and terrifying performance by Terry O'Quinn left audiences stunned. Dylan Walsh brings a good amount of intensity to his interpretation of the character, but as a whole, the film proves to be a flaccid and unnecessary attempt. David is a mild mannered salesman that is marrying in to a broken family with three kids, but as his fiance's ex-husband, the neighbors, and his co-workers begin growing suspicious of his shrouded past, he must go to any length to protect his dark secrets. The most noticeable misstep in this version is the family size. The film introduces three children into the storyline, but only develops the eldest son while the other two are absent in nearly the entire picture. For whatever reason, the filmmakers must not have found Walsh's performance to be dramatic enough, as the script relies on countless false scares using all of the cheapest tactics and music cues to try to drum up audience reactions. The filming is cold and sterile, which reflects David's despondent existence, but also cuts out any emotional response in the viewing.

After what I can only suppose is a short courtship he moves in with her and her two kids, a third child that was in reform school but looks 22 comes home for summer break and starts to get suspicious of Daddy Dearest. And what does a 17 y/o do if he gets suspicious of his mom's new boyfriend now in the 21st century? Internet?  Why no of course not, if he did the movie would last 15 minutes. No the guy is super suspicious, he even creeps him out and this 17 y/o doesn't even Google the guy. Then I thought ""well maybe it's because they have only one computer in the house and he doesn't have a smartphone"" but no, the guy has a laptop on his desk in his room.Yes folks that's how dumb this movie is, because as Hitchcock said when you do a suspense film and for instance the guy can't go to the police you have to establish early on why he can't go to the police, or else the audience is like ""Well why doesn't he just go to the police?"". Here if they would have at least given a reason as to why no one goes to the net and gives a search for this guy it would have played off better, the ex eventually does it but lets face it too little too late.I wouldn't buy this movie if I were you.",1,No Internet?,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,1848,"['will', 'not', 'compare', 'movie', 'original', 'rarely', 'think', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'movie', 'week', 'predictable', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous.Dylan', 'Walsh', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'preys', 'single', 'moms', 'families', 'always', 'have', 'perfect', 'family', 'eventually', 'something', 'someone', 'will', 'get', 'way', 'be', 'suspicious', 'ex', 'nosey', 'neighbor', 'other', 'drivel', 'Now', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'what', 'happened', 'womans', 'face', 'always', 'considered', 'natural', 'beauty', 'well', 'too', 'bad', 'single', 'mom', 'not', 'have', 'cable', 'never', 'watched', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'suppose', 'short', 'courtship', 'two', 'kids', 'third', 'child', 'was', 'reform', 'school', '22', 'home', 'summer', 'break', 'get', 'suspicious', 'Daddy', 'Dearest', 'what', '17', 'y/o', 'do', 'suspicious', 'mom', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'now', '21st', 'century', 'Internet', 'Why', 'course', 'not', 'did', 'movie', 'would', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'guy', 'super', 'suspicious', 'even', 'creeps', 'out', '17', 'y/o', ""n't"", 'even', 'Google', 'guy', 'Then', 'thought', 'well', 'maybe', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'computer', 'house', ""n't"", 'have', 'smartphone', 'guy', 'laptop', 'desk', 'room.Yes', 'folks', 'how', 'dumb', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', 'said', 'when', 'do', 'suspense', 'film', 'instance', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'have', 'establish', 'early', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'else', 'audience', 'Well', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'police', 'Here', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'given', 'reason', 'why', 'one', 'net', 'search', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'off', 'better', 'ex', 'eventually', 'face', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'were']",N/A

1247369,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0021L8UYY,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","The best scene of ""The Stepfather"" is the opening sequence, which takes place in a suburban home at Christmastime. A man, currently assuming the identity of Grady Edwards (Dylan Walsh), stands in front of the bathroom mirror and changes his appearance, dying his hair and trimming off his beard. He then goes downstairs and, calmly as can be, pours himself a cup of coffee and fixes up some peanut butter toast. He gathers his suitcases, and just as he gets ready to leave the house, we finally see the bodies of a woman and three young children lying amidst strewn Christmas decorations. We then cut to a scene in which a team of investigators discuss the specifics of the case; Edwards, who has no picture ID and pays for everything in cash, marries divorced or widowed women who already have children and then disappears once they're found dead. Because he has no record, tracking him down would be next to impossible.We quickly see the film's biggest flaw once these scenes end and the story proper begins: Because we've already seen that Walsh is playing a deceitful and murderous character, there's absolutely nothing he can say or do that we won't already be expecting. We know he'll charm another husbandless mother into marrying him. And when she and her children disappoint him--and inevitably, they will--we know he'll fly off the handle. Dull, tension-free, and devoid of shocks (save for a few throwaway pop-out scares), ""The Stepfather"" is a movie whose structure seemed to have been inspired by a high school essay, rigidly taught as having to have an introductory paragraph, a concluding paragraph, and three body paragraphs that are each assigned a supporting position. You begin watching this movie and right off the bat can predict what will happen, when it will happen, and who it will happen to.Based on the 1987 film directed by Joseph Reuben (unseen by me), ""The Stepfather"" goes through the motions yet lacks the conviction needed in order to work. The title character alone is a bundle of tired psychological clich&eacute;s, an orderly, methodical man who wants the perfect family but has unreasonably high standards. It sort of makes you wonder, then, why he would intrude on the lives of the Hardings, where the teenage son, Michael (Penn Badgley), has spent the last year in military school for behavioral problems following his parents' divorce. To be his stepfather would require a lot of compromise, understanding, and above all, patience. Edwards, who now goes by the name David Harris, proves time and time again that he possesses none of those qualities. ""Family is the most important thing,"" he says early on. ""Without family, you have nothing."" Given this simplistic and inflexible standpoint, it's implausible that he would even pretend to invest in bringing the Hardings back together.But because he's a psychopath, I guess he's supposed to follow faulty logic. In all honesty, the most disturbing character in this movie is not the Stepfather, but his new wife, Susan (Sela Ward), a woman so blindsided by her own need for happiness that she fails to notice little things about him pretty much everyone else notices. Why does he suddenly quit his job as a realtor when asked to fill out social security forms and other government papers? Why does he call his dead daughter Michelle one minute and Lisa the next? Why do sketches on the America's Most Wanted website bear a resemblance to him? How could he know the details of a neighbor's death when he was never told about them? And why does he have padlocked cabinets down in the basement? Growing increasingly suspicious of his stepfather, Michael takes it upon himself to do what his mother isn't willing to do: Get to the bottom of things.The final twenty minutes could have been engaging had they not been so formulaic. Every thrill is so unflatteringly predictable, it's as if the filmmakers included them only out of obligation to keep with tradition. Would it surprise you to learn that it takes place during a rainstorm? In the middle of the night? I half expected a sudden power outage (the old cutting-the-phone-line gimmick has officially died--everyone uses a cell phone these days).A lot of this probably could have been overlooked if there was some level of mystery woven throughout the plot. Unfortunately, we had the Stepfather character figured out before we even entered the theater. So with nothing to surprise us, what else is there? The problem with ""The Stepfather"" is not that it's gory, vulgar, or in poor taste--it's just so bereft of originality that it's flat-out boring. The only stimulation I got from watching this movie was the constant back-and-forth glancing at the clock on my iPod. The director is Nelson McCormick and the writer is J.S. Cardone, both of whom were responsible for the disaster that was the 2008 remake of ""Prom Night."" It wouldn't be worth noting that ""The Stepfather"" is a better film. That would be like comparing ninety-day-old cheese to thirty-day-old cheese.

1247371,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B0021L8UYY,Craig Whittle,"[3, 4]","THE STEPFATHERSTARRING: Dylan Walsh, Penn Badgley, Amber Heard, Sela Ward, Sherry Stringfield, Jon Tenney, Paige Turco and Jessalyn GilsigWRITTEN BY: J.S. Cardone, Donald E. Westlake, Carolyn Lefcourt and Brian GarfieldDIRECTED BY: Nelson McCormickRated: PG - 13Genre: Horror / ThrillerRelease Date: 16 October 2009I'll admit that as a fan of the original 1987 version of The Stepfather, I was slightly concerned for the remake when I learned that Dylan Walsh was playing the evil daddy. I'm a huge fan of the show Nip/Tuck on which he plays a real softy. He is such a likeable and sweet guy on the show that I had serious doubts if he would be able to pull of such a nasty role as this. Well just as Heath Ledger surprised all of us in The Dark Knight, Walsh did the same for me here.His portrayal of David Harris is one of the best performances I have seen from anyone this year. I think what worked so well for me was that he is not at all a creepy looking guy. He is very charming and kind-spirited, so when he gets into this particular character who is a very sinister individual, it really bothers you. How could a guy like this have such a Norman Bates like quality to him?I think my favorite portion of the film was the first five minutes. You have no idea what the hell is going on. You just see this guy shaving in the mirror and staring at himself oddly. Then he dies his hair. You know something is up but you don't know what exactly. Then he gets dressed and goes downstairs and helps himself to some peanut buttered-toast and coffee. As far as he is concerned, everything is fine. But we know better; the director makes sure of it.Then out of nowhere we see a child sprawled over the kitchen table; dead, in the middle of breakfast. We know that he is aware of the dead body and yet he continues to act as if nothing is the matter. Now we are creped out. Next he walks around the house preparing to leave and we see other dead bodies. He steps around them as if they were a child's toy or a sleeping dog in his path and it really gets under your skin; especially the way he looks at them, no doubt envisioning how he killed them earlier. It's not very gory, but it's unsettling. Then he turns up the AC and leaves.I generally despise PG - 13 horror films. They are typically watered down and aimed at junior high school kids with an early bed time. They are very frustrating and disappointing. This is the best one I have seen in years; right up there with The Ring and The Grudge.I'm not saying it's better than the original, but it's just as good. It's as different from the earlier version as Scream is from Psycho. You get more gore in the first film for sure but you get more wit and suspense out of this one. I'm glad that both films exist.We learn that David has a history of doing this. The authorities are onto him but don't know exactly who he is. He moves away to a small town in Oregon, changes his identity completely, and looks for a new potential family.He is very much into having a family, despite the fact that something clearly didn't work out so well with the last one he had.He meets Susan Harding (Sela Ward) and her small children, casually in a grocery store and the two of them hit it off right away. We flash forward to sometime in the future and learn that they are to be married, are now living together and that Susan has an older son who's about to come back into the picture. He was sent away to a Military reform school for his poor behavior.Penn Badgley plays Susan's son Michael. Michael is suspicious of David from the get-go and I suspect David gathered this and made a quick effort to win Michael over. At their first meeting he takes Michael downstairs and offers him a drink of liquor from his secret stash and asks him not to tell his mother. David's liquor cabinet in the basement is only one of his many locked compartments which we soon learn the contents of.Everything is all hunky-dory for a while and then people outside of the family begin to grow suspicious of David; like the old lady across the street that recognizes him from the news and then winds up dead.Soon enough David's charm starts to wear off and Michael is no longer too fond of him. He seems to be the only one noticing all of the eerie things going on with David. He begins to become infatuated with learning who David is and where he comes from, as things that David has told him about his past, start to not add up.One of the things that really creeped me out was how David was so interested in what Michael and his girlfriend Kelly (Amber Heard) are doing when no one is around. David is fine with sharing some alcohol with Michael but the thought of his new step-son having sexual relations under hiss roof seems to really get to David.There is a very well acted scene between David and Kelly alone in the kitchen while Michael is out in the pool. Now Kelly too starts to see that there may be something off with David. I wish that they would have gone a little further with it, but it was still nice.Eventually David starts to catch on that Michael may be onto him and things start to really heat up. Like I said, the film isn't that gory with its PG - 13 rating; but it's a lot like a Hitchcock film where suspense rather than blood pumps through its veins. And David does some very sick and shocking things.The climax was very entertaining and Walsh's performance near the end only became more astonishing. He's a much underrated actor and is in definite justification to receive more lead roles of this stature.Perhaps what kept the film from being better were the other characters and the actors that played them. The actors weren't bad but they weren't great either. David's character was so well developed; I felt that the other people in the story could have used some attention as well.",4,The Stepfather Review,1261008000,"12 17,

Robinson ""Electrojunkie""","[1, 1]","This was a very bad remake of the Stepfather, I don't even know where to begin.This is filled with typical cliches that you see in films. Rebel child returns home from military camp or wherever he came from, meets new boyfriend and doesn't like him and kind of fight for male dominance of the house. How many times have we seen that in films, but hey you need some kind of angst in the film right to give it drama.The mom acts clueless like she doesn't know what's going on around her. Even her sister is telling her how this man quit his job immediately after she asked for him to fill out papers for tax purposes, mom never find it odd how there is no picture of him in the house, just met him a couple of months and already moved him into her house and yet she doesn't even know his own religion and the only thing she can say is the ever so tired ""Why can't people just be happy for me!"" They want to be happy for you, but stop being an idiot and open your eyeballs. The only redeeming quality that she had is when she learned her boyfriend put his hands on the younger son, she had a nice reaction and telling him that she would not tolerate physical discipline on her children.The son and his stupid ass girlfriend did nothing in this film but walk around in swimwear and under garments wtf. They had nothing else to do but get wet. The son had his suspicions and rightfully so, so he didn't look like an idiot like the mother and girlfriend. The girlfriend is the village dumbass in this film. Boyfriend is telling her of the holes in stepfather's story, and showing her proof of his suspicions and all she does is wave it off and yet she is written to be the smart one and be a good influence on the son, really? How's she a good influence when she's an idiot, I bet no college accepted her.Remakes are nothing more than glossed over modern versions of the original. It's sad what Hollywood has turned into when they resort to making remakes and not their own ideas or be creative. You would think that this particular film was set back a couple of years when technology wasn't as advanced as it is today and it would be believable that the stepfather would be able to hide his identity with ease but it didn't so it makes it hard to believe that only one person in that neighborhood being the lady next door is able to recognize him and nobody at the welcome home party didn't. You think the stepfather would want to be careful while he's out and about.They could have done better and taken their time with these films, especially if it's going to be a remake.",1,Bad Remake,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,2569,"['was', 'very', 'bad', 'remake', 'Stepfather', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin.This', 'filled', 'typical', 'cliches', 'see', 'films', 'Rebel', 'child', 'returns', 'home', 'military', 'camp', 'wherever', 'came', 'new', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'fight', 'male', 'dominance', 'house', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'hey', 'need', 'kind', 'angst', 'film', 'right', 'give', 'drama.The', 'mom', 'acts', 'clueless', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Even', 'sister', 'telling', 'how', 'man', 'quit', 'job', 'immediately', 'asked', 'fill', 'out', 'papers', 'tax', 'purposes', 'mom', 'never', 'find', 'odd', 'how', 'picture', 'house', 'just', 'met', 'couple', 'months', 'already', 'moved', 'house', 'yet', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'own', 'religion', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'ever', 'so', 'tired', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'people', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'want', 'be', 'happy', 'stop', 'being', 'idiot', 'open', 'eyeballs', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'had', 'when', 'learned', 'boyfriend', 'put', 'hands', 'younger', 'son', 'had', 'nice', 'reaction', 'telling', 'would', 'not', 'tolerate', 'physical', 'discipline', 'children.The', 'son', 'stupid', 'ass', 'girlfriend', 'did', 'nothing', 'film', 'walk', 'swimwear', 'garments', 'wtf', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'get', 'wet', 'son', 'had', 'suspicions', 'rightfully', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'idiot', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'girlfriend', 'village', 'dumbass', 'film', 'Boyfriend', 'telling', 'holes', 'stepfather', 'story', 'showing', 'proof', 'suspicions', 'wave', 'off', 'yet', 'written', 'be', 'smart', 'one', 'be', 'good', 'influence', 'son', 'really', 'How', 'good', 'influence', 'when', 'idiot', 'bet', 'college', 'accepted', 'her.Remakes', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'glossed', 'modern', 'versions', 'original', 'sad', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'turned', 'when', 'resort', 'making', 'remakes', 'not', 'own', 'ideas', 'be', 'creative', 'would', 'think', 'particular', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'back', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'technology', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'advanced', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'believable', 'stepfather', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'hide', 'identity', 'ease', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'hard', 'believe', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'neighborhood', 'being', 'lady', 'next', 'door', 'able', 'recognize', 'nobody', 'welcome', 'home', 'party', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'stepfather', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'careful', 'out', 'about.They', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'taken', 'time', 'films', 'especially', 'going', 'be', 'remake']",N/A

So when I heard about the remake I was curious to see how an updated version would work.The good news is that they kept the same basic story of a psycho nutjob slicing his way through one family after another as his expectations of the ideal family are dashed. And I liked Dylan Walsh in the lead role, he doesn't look menacing or crazy, and for this movie to work, you needed a good lead actor in the titular role.The bad news is everything else.Yes the killer moves from one family to the next in the film, but it's a rather bloodless affair. I'm not what you would call a ""gorehound"" and I don't need to see ""Saw"" type bloodshed in every film, but when you're talking about a ""slasher"" film...it helps if there is some slashing and a bit of the red stuff flowing here and there. The hapless family is amazingly dull, you almost begin rooting for the Stepfather to finish them off...and quickly as they are so painfully stupid you hope he puts them out of their misery.Maybe if the director had spent as much time building up some suspense as he did filming bikini shots of Amber Heard we could have had an eerie little flick? Not that there's anything wrong with Amber Heard in a bikini....As it stands, dust off a place on the shelf next to other useless remakes like ""Black Christmas"", ""Prom Night"" and ""The Fog"" as ""The Stepfather"" is just as forgettable.",2,Watchable...But Basically Another Wasted Remake,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,1471,"['am', 'fan', 'original', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'film', 'Stepfather', 'even', 'loved', 'Stepfather', '2', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'when', 'heard', 'remake', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'updated', 'version', 'would', 'work.The', 'good', 'news', 'kept', 'same', 'basic', 'story', 'psycho', 'nutjob', 'slicing', 'way', 'one', 'family', 'expectations', 'ideal', 'family', 'are', 'dashed', 'liked', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'lead', 'role', ""n't"", 'look', 'menacing', 'crazy', 'movie', 'work', 'needed', 'good', 'lead', 'actor', 'titular', 'role.The', 'bad', 'news', 'everything', 'killer', 'one', 'family', 'next', 'film', 'rather', 'bloodless', 'affair', ""'m"", 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'gorehound', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Saw', 'type', 'bloodshed', 'film', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'slasher', 'film', 'slashing', 'bit', 'red', 'stuff', 'flowing', 'here', 'there', 'hapless', 'family', 'amazingly', 'dull', 'almost', 'begin', 'rooting', 'Stepfather', 'finish', 'off', 'quickly', 'are', 'so', 'painfully', 'stupid', 'hope', 'misery.Maybe', 'director', 'had', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'suspense', 'did', 'filming', 'bikini', 'shots', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'eerie', 'little', 'flick', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'bikini', 'dust', 'off', 'place', 'shelf', 'other', 'useless', 'remakes', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'Prom', 'Night', 'Fog', 'Stepfather', 'just', 'forgettable']",N/A

It's the nice looking, Kurt Rusell-esque guy next door to be concerned about.  In this instance, ""The Stepfather"" has a few things going to exemplify the weaknesses of human nature. For one, David Harris (Dylan Walsh) is invited into these homes by women who are attractive, single and operate as the primary parent.  But what does he do to enamor himself with these ladies?  Charisma and charm can be used for good and evil, but you decide your own case.  David does a few things that speak to the voids in the women he entangles in his web. David:--Finds attractive, single mothers shopping in stores with their children and engages them by being open and vulnerable (""My wife and daughter were killed in a car accident...I'm new in town and don't know my way around."")--Targets attractive women with children, because an attractive, eligible, and tolerant man to bring into their world might initially be challenging. David makes himself available.--Plays it cool.  David isn't stressed and seems indifferent to what the women might do. But, because he's figured out their psychodynamics, he feels confident he can predict what they're inclined to do, which is to invite him into their lives.---Interacts well with the children.  To get the cow express interest in her calf!  If David demonstrates he is father material, the women can quickly envision him being an addition to a newly formed family. They get a new mate and the children get a new father.All in all, ""The Stepfather"" is instructional for illustrating the precepts to getting one's feet in the door to any opportunity, whether it's finding a new love or exploring new job opportunities.I recommend ""The Stepfather"" for these ""Take aways"" alone.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute",3,Lessons Learned for Enhancing Charisma,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,1876,"['Stepfather', 'psycho-drama', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Jason', 'Vorhees', 'be', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'nice', 'looking', 'Kurt', 'Rusell-esque', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'be', 'concerned', 'instance', 'Stepfather', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'exemplify', 'weaknesses', 'human', 'nature', 'one', 'David', 'Harris', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'invited', 'homes', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'attractive', 'single', 'operate', 'primary', 'parent', 'what', 'do', 'enamor', 'ladies', 'Charisma', 'charm', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'good', 'evil', 'decide', 'own', 'case', 'David', 'few', 'things', 'speak', 'voids', 'women', 'web', 'David', 'attractive', 'single', 'mothers', 'shopping', 'stores', 'children', 'being', 'open', 'vulnerable', 'wife', 'daughter', 'were', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', ""'m"", 'new', 'town', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'Targets', 'attractive', 'women', 'children', 'attractive', 'eligible', 'tolerant', 'man', 'bring', 'world', 'might', 'initially', 'be', 'challenging', 'David', 'available.', 'cool', 'David', ""n't"", 'stressed', 'indifferent', 'what', 'women', 'might', 'do', 'figured', 'out', 'psychodynamics', 'confident', 'can', 'predict', 'what', ""'re"", 'inclined', 'do', 'invite', 'lives.', 'well', 'children', 'get', 'cow', 'express', 'interest', 'calf', 'David', 'father', 'material', 'women', 'can', 'quickly', 'envision', 'being', 'addition', 'newly', 'formed', 'family', 'get', 'new', 'mate', 'children', 'get', 'new', 'father.All', 'Stepfather', 'instructional', 'illustrating', 'precepts', 'getting', 'one', 'feet', 'door', 'opportunity', 'finding', 'new', 'love', 'exploring', 'new', 'job', 'opportunities.I', 'recommend', 'Stepfather', 'Take', 'aways', 'alone.Edward', 'BrownCore', 'Edge', 'Image', 'Charisma', 'Institute']",N/A

He would cooly whistle and smear peanut butter on toast, pick up his coat and walk by a room full of family corpses.Switch to this 2009 ""re-imagining"", as the director describes it in the ""Making of..."" documentary. Dylan Walsh does the honors this time but there's nothing remotely chilling about him.  Instead of a daughter this time, he has a step-son, Penn Badgley, who is so vacant, surly and cold you can understand the step-father's urge to murder him.So much of the movie is spent with the son and his irritating girlfriend, Amber Head, who live in their bathing suits by the pool. Her total refusal to believe her boyfriend's suspicions about his step-father is so relentless you wish that she could have been an early victim.Unlike the original, there's zero suspense here. The cast is a talented one but none can do much with this lousy script and direction.It would be so wonderful if our modern movie-makers would spent the $60 million it took to make this brainless mess on a brand new horror script.

This movie was very slow-moving, did not have a lot of character development and the overall plot was just rather bland. I do not understand why the bulk of the story centered around Penn Badgley's character. He played a teenage boy who comes home from military school and starts to suspect that there is something wrong with his future stepfather (Dylan Walsh). And what was up with trying to make him into this rebel. The kid was about as badass as a gold fish swimming belly up. The producers also tried to go out of their way to make the movie look ""modern"" and updated, complete with electronic communication devices, cohabitation before marriage, a leftist mother who doesn't believe in hitting and of course the token lipstick-lesbians. But this just is another point that the movie fails because instead of developing the story, the writers thought it more prudent to detail the overall atmosphere which played very little into what wound up happening. The only person I sorta liked was Nancy Linehan Charles, as Mrs. Cutter; the neighborhood resident-kook. She was believable because she totally portrayed the busy-body cat-lady as we have come to expect this character. But overall, the entire movie should have had more suspense and more violence and excitement.

1247387,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B0021L8UYY,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[15, 23]","Why a remake after all these years?  Was there anything new to bring to the table in this new version?  A little, perhaps, but not necessarily anything groundbreaking.  If you are a fan of the TV show ""Lost"" (though I really hope you aren't), you may get a little more satisfaction from the original version of ""The Stepfather"" starring that show's Terry O'Quinn (""John Locke"").I saw the original version in the theaters way back in the day.  I loved it!  O'Quinn's shrewd performance in the title role helped elevate what could have been just another pedestrian thriller into a real nail-biter.  It didn't hurt having director Joseph Ruben running the show, either.  It was low-budget but it was taut and effective.  Not a wasted scene in the whole movie.This new version, though, feels somewhat padded by comparison.  The original was brief yet brisk.  The new one somehow feels longer than it needs to be.One of the more noticeable differences comes courtesy of the new film's PG-13 rating.  The original film opens with a chilling reveal where the villain walks nonchalantly through the bloodbath he created, the bodies of his viciously murdered family covered in blood and lying all about the living room and entrance hall.  In this new version, there is no blood in that scene.  We see the bodies of his family, but we just presume them to be dead based on the eerie music and the premise of the story.  Just to look at the bodies, one really can't tell if they are dead or merely unconscious.  (How did he kill them?  There were no visible signs.  Did he poison them?  Did he make them watch a ""Lost"" marathon and bore them to death?  We don't find out for sure until a later scene).  So instead of having a punch-to-the-gut opening like in the original, we get a scene that lays the groundwork for the character in a somewhat tame and less dangerous way.There are some necessary technological and administrative updates in this version, however.  This new Stepfather has to sidestep the very large issue of needing to have no ID paper trail, an issue the first movie conveniently avoided altogether.  When the 2009 stepfather starts his new job in a realtor's office, he keeps the job only until he can no longer stall having to come up with photo ID and SSN for the mandatory employment tax records.  That also necessitates another change from the original - he has not yet wed his new fianc&eacute;e, he merely lives with her and her family.  Try getting married without any kind of ID, folks.  The first film doesn't deal with that at all but you're generally too caught up in the story to notice.  Also, there are some key moments courtesy of some cellphones.I think the film might have been better and more interesting if our villain had found a creative way to circumvent these administrative issues rather than simply running from them.  It would have made him seem to be a far more intelligent and cunning villain rather than just a disturbed man with a twisted plan.There are several other key differences too, including the number of stepchildren, extended family members, outside victims, and the film's climax and d&eacute;nouement.  It definitely has a contemporary feel to it,  but it lacks much of the menace and dread that permeated the original.  In the original, it was the young stepdaughter who became suspicious of the new man in her family, and the audience feared for her safety.  In the remake, the suspicious one is the older and definitely athletic stepson, who looks like he would have little trouble taking on his stepdad in a fight.  That dilutes the dread factor more than a little bit.  You still have that stepchild to root for, but you really don't fear for him as much.Instead of the new stepfather marrying a widow with a child, as in the original, here he woos a divorcee whose ex-husband figures into the story a little  (and the bickering between the two exes certainly rings true to life).  But as a fan of the original film I can't help thinking that the writers of the new film just went point-for-point against the old script and tried to make some minor elements different just for the sake of doing so, or for no other reason than to simply put a different stamp on things.But will you like this remake even if you haven't even seen the original?  Hard to say.  The new cast is certainly attractive enough.  There's a little eye candy for everyone.  But I'd have to go with the original in every other category, and those are the categories that matter.And given the larger number of peripheral characters in this new one, I'm a little surprised the body count wasn't a bit higher.  It didn't necessarily need to be higher, but this story already stretches plausibility pretty thin anyway so the filmmakers might as well let the audience have a little fun.And of course, we can't forget the film's score.  Where the original had a creepy synthesizer score (courtesy of one of the keyboard players for the band Yes), this film's soundtrack is peppered with enough pop and rock songs to fill a soundtrack CD.  That's pretty much par for the course nowadays, ain't it?  Whatever happened to ambience for ambience's sake?I can't say I cared too much for the ending.  The story ties up a bit too quickly and easily.  It's kind of a cop-out.  Also, at the screening I attended the sound mix way way off -- the music track was SO LOUD that it all but drowned out the dialog from the confrontation in the kitchen all the way until the very end of the film.  I don't know if the problem was the film mix itself or something the local theater projectionist had a hand in.Overall, though, the acting was decent enough.  I just think the execution of the film as a whole was a let-down.  Even the scenes of violence, the cornerstones for depicting the evil twistedness of the title character, were tame and too PG-13 to be effectively scary.Skip this version and watch the original.  It is taught and tight.  This one feels padded yet somehow empty by comparison.Final note --  Sela Ward costars in this film.  Her appearance can be summed up in two words: Hubba hubba!",3,Slightly biased review,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,6109,"['Why', 'remake', 'years', 'Was', 'there', 'anything', 'new', 'bring', 'table',

We later see that his house is strewn with bodies (of people that he must have killed).2. Next scene, he meets a woman at a store and feeds her the line about his wife and child dying in a car crash.3. Don't-you-know-it ! six months later they are moved in together and engaged to be married.4. The woman's son (and ex-husband) suspect that something is wrong with the New Guy. (So, too, does a Nosey Next Door Neighbor-- who is eventually murdered by the New Guy in broad daylight.)5. The son gets wise to what is going on and he and the Stepfather clash violently. The Stepfather sustains a mirror shard in his neck and a fall off the roof. But he still manages to wake up (after falling off the roof) and escape-- and not be seen at any hospital anywhere or caught by anyone while running through a neighborhood full of people with eyes.6. He eventually gets a job in a store somewhere (with no change in appearance and presumably still with no IDs), where he sees a woman with two other kids and The Cycle Begins Again.Comments:1. Maybe the reason that this plot seems so derivative is because it *is*. Even if you didn't know that this was a remake of an older movie, it still *feels* that way for some reason.2. There are just way too many holes in this to make it plausible. The Stepfather gets a job with no license or social security card-- or any other single piece of Photo ID. He kills the neighbor in broad daylight, and no one notices. She stays dead for some amount of time, and gets discovered later. There is no inquest into her murder  and no one thinks to ask how she died (since falling down the stairs is not that often enough to kill anyone). He later kills someone by holding her head underwater for, like, 2 seconds. And no one sees or hears any of this.3. There was lots of T&A; in the movie (the son's girlfriend), and thought it was nice to look at, one gets the impression that the director put it there because he hoped that we would not notice something that the plot was so thin.This is not worth spending rental money on.

Not much new there.The done-before story-line is elevated by some atmosphere and good acting, especially from exquisite Penn Badgley, the delicious anti-hero from Gossip Girl. He was the reason I found this film, which would have gone unnoticed otherwise. Aside from the welcome eye-candy he provides, he has a compelling screen presence which makes everything he does interesting to watch.Penn's new house has a swimming pool in the back yard (hooray for California) so he appears several times lounging around in a bathing suit. Even if he couldn't act, or was not so obviously intelligent, Penn Badgley is certainly a genius from the neck down. And it's always good to see a director who knows how to use his attractive star.The step-father in question seems to have it in for poor Penn (too handsome?), but tries to disguise it under a bland and over-polite exterior which fairly drips with 'concern' -- the dead give-away of a psychopath in a thriller. It takes plenty of nocturnal stealth and surreptitious sleuthing on Penn's part (usually in shorts and t-shirt) to uncover the older man's dreadful secret which, in one last cliche of the genre, is hidden in the basement. But therein lies the atmosphere and chills the movie provides -- apart from the very real fear that our star will not get into a bathing suit again.Movie alone? Three stars.

1247408,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0021L8UYY,RMurray847,"[25, 30]","I hate to start a review with an admission of guilt, but I have to admit that I agreed to see a bargain showing of THE STEPFATHER to placate my bored daughter without any expectations that the film would be decent.  So I didn't exactly have an open mind.  Sadly, the film did NOTHING to change the mind I had almost made up in advance.The 1987 original was, in its day, a creepy success.  Terry O'Quinn (John Locke on LOST) was a calm, cool & collected psycho killer whose friendly demeanor could shut off in split second and become icy deadness.  The basic story is similar in the two movies.  The stepfather ingratiates himself into a family where the mother is feeling alone and in need of male companionship, and thus, may overlook a few strange moments in her new beau.  There are kids already in place, and their new stepfather works hard to win them over...but they pick up on the fact that a lot of it is fake emotion.  When the kids inevitably ""disappoint"" their new dad, bloody hell takes over and the family is killed, and ""dad"" moves on to another family.In the original, the stepfather actually was always juggling two families.  He already knew that one would inevitably disappoint him and he'd need another household to move to.  When you think about it, this IS pretty creepy...he knows it's just a matter of time before he has to kill everyone, so why not have another family readily at hand.  In the remake, the stepfather (Dylan Walsh, from NIP/TUCK) just goes from one to another...as though he thinks each family will be THE ONE.The story is pretty predictable and familiar (and I bet if I looked back at 1987's film again, it would seem pretty tame...although I doubt the power of O'Quinn's performance will have diminished).  New guy  moves in and little details about him just don't seem right.  Kids grow suspicious, but the newly married mother is oblivious or in denial.  As the puzzle comes together, dad becomes more unhinged and all this leads to a final, bloody confrontation.  A story as neatly laid out as this requires credible acting and a good pace and good editing sense to have a chance of giving us the creeps we need to feel.  The new STEPFATHER doesn't measure up at all.Walsh is an acceptable choice as the lead character.  In NIP/TUCK, Walsh's character Sean is always the guy who on the surface seems like the nice, understanding, decent counterpart to his hedonistic partner, but often behaves just as stupidly.  You could argue that he  hasn't strayed all that far afield in THE STEPFATHER, but the role of the nice guy with a dark heart fits him.  He doesn't do anything spectacular with the role, but he is acceptable.  Sela Ward, always a solid if unspectacular actress, plays his new wife...and she's solid but unspectacular.  Her dialogue, when she's defending her new man, is hardly of  help to her.  It's of the ""Why can't everyone just be happy for me?"" ilk.So, two crucial characters are in place, and they are okay, particularly for an unambitious, low-budget genre film.  But then we've got Penn Badgley and Amber  Heard (PINEAPPLE EXPRESS) as the ""kids.""  Each actor is  about 23, but supposedly of high school age.  Neither looks remotely that young.  Badgley is the troubled son who has just come back for the summer from military school.  He's sullen and vaguely unhappy, but never convinces as a kid that was bad enough to be sent away.  He's mostly petulant, and, frankly, a bad actor.  Heard is his long-time girlfriend, and it is apparently her lifelong ambition to strut around in front of her marginally interested boyfriend in a skimpy bikini.  I felt somewhat bad for her...she's supposed to be the ""rock"" that keeps her boyfriend steady and grounded, and she's constantly giving him advice...but it's always in her bikini.  Heard is not up to the task, so she comes across as an airhead who is reading lines.  And the bikini seems even more out of place, because even though the two are ALWAYS hanging around the backyard pool, the film is lit in such a way that it always feel vaguely overcast and cold outside...I was always thinking she would be covered in goosebumps.  It's these two characters who are supposed to finally put two-and-two together about the new man in their lives...but they seem so bland and vacuous that I never believed a single thing either of them said or did on screen.  And if you dislike these characters, it's really tough to give a darn about what happens to them.Also, the movie is PG-13, and this doesn't help.  Walsh commits several violent acts, but we always cut away tastefully before we see much of anything, and while I don't need to wallow in gratuitous violence, not seeing ANYTHING really happen never really allows us to fear this guy.  For goodness sake, he kills a little old lady from across the street, and we don't feel a thing.There are occasional amusing elements, such as watching Walsh come up with excuses not to provide a social security number to his new employer...but when the climactic confrontations come, they are bland and unexciting.  The movie spends a lot of time leading up to the final you-know-what hitting the fan, but when it does, all we can do is shrug ""so what.""There was no really good reason to remake THE STEPFATHER.  But having decided to, the filmmakers put very little effort into it.  It's as though they decided that marketing should do all the work for them...they didn't actually need to make a good film.  And they at least succeeded in that.",1,"Pointless remake, badly executed",1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,5495,"['hate', 'start', 'review', 'admission', 'guilt', 'have', 'admit', 'agreed', 'see',

1247409,ABFQUOV57SWOR,B0021L8UYY,robb1138,"[2, 3]","""The Stepfather"" is a mediocre film at best. We watch movies like ""The Stepfather"" for the suspense, the action, the atractive females, and the drama. This movie has this as well as Dylan Walsh from ""Nip/Tuck."" I must be watching too much ""Criminal Minds,"" as I was working on a profile of Walsh's David Harris character the whole movie. The movie stars Sela Ward, a divorced mother with two pre-teen children and a boy nearing adulthood. TV star Penn Badgley, coupled with Amber Heard's bikini clad body round out the main cast.David Harris's unknown childhood drives him to want the perfect family, if this doesn't work out he kills the family, as seen in the opening of this film. Moving on to a new city, changing his looks, his name, and always paying in cash, David Harris finds himself a new victim. Staking out a grocery store, looking for the perfect surrogate family, Harris comes across Susan Harding, played by the still extremely attractive Sela Ward, and her two pre-teen children. Seeing hismself as the perfect father for this family, Harris introduces himself, turns on the charm and starts anew. Sometime later, Susan's oldest son Michael, played by Penn Badgley, returns from military school for the summer and the plot thickens, as they say. Unsure of his position in his family, Michael takes his time adjusting, lounging by the pool with girlfriend Kelly, played by Amber Heard. David's pyschosis starts to surface when Michael's younger brother Sean, played by Braeden Lemasters, ignores his mother and plays his video games too loudly. David grabs Sean by the neck and squeezes hard, scaring the kid into submission. After taking a job showing houses for Susan's sister Jackie, and doing well, Jackie asks for some personal identification for tax forms and David quits. David deals with these intrusions into his delusions the only way he seems to know how, violence. As you can guess Michael catches on to David pretty quickly and trouble soon ensues. From here on out, the rest is predictable.I think Dylan Walsh's character although incomplete was the most developed. Walsh's creepy acting helped to counter-act the weak character development that the story's writers left him. When strangling the family's estranged father in the basement, I could see in Dylan's eyes, not anger but desparation, not evil, but fear. His glances, his hand gestures, his facial gestures all appear original and convincing. Sela Ward, on the other hand, plays her character way too trusting, a bit too naive, and less convincing as Walsh. Penn Badgley does a better job in staying on the fence about the stepfather. Michael seems to envision a happier, idealized family at first, willing to let go of the past and start anew. Perhaps the writers handed Badgley more character than they did the rest of the cast. In contrast, Amber Heard, plays a blonde in a bikini, no depth, no woman's intuition until its too late. Eye candy is all she is.A good thing about this film is the pacing. The prologue is a series of quick cuts allowing the audience to form impressions rather than to take in fully the carnage. Slower shots as the location and main characters are lightly developed. I think director Nelson McCormick, realizing he was in trouble, reacts, by picking up the pace and shortens the scenes, compensting for a lack of story development. McCormick pauses, perhaps a bit too long on the pool scenes, to let the camera caress Amber Heard's supple body. Quick edits help keep the film's pace on track and the suspence building till the end of the movie, which comes blissfully faster. The other key ingredient for keeping this film moving and the suspense building the the music. Perhaps overdone on parts, however, this movie needed the overemphasis badly to keep the tension from fading.I never quite came up with a great profile for this character, other than what appeared to be his basic need for a family. I could conjecture, that Edward was abused when he was a child, abandoned or neglected. The writers don't give any direct references to the Walsh's character's past. This is why I think this film falls into the  mere slasher movie category and nothing more. Watch this movie only if you are looking for a cheap thrill, keep your expectations low and get close to your signicant other.",3,Who am I here?,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,4308,"['Stepfather', 'mediocre', 'film', 'best', 'watch', 'movies', 'Stepfather', 'suspense', 'action', 'atractive', 'females', 'drama', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Nip/Tuck', 'must', 'be', 'watching', 'too', 'much', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'was', 'working', 'profile', 'Walsh', 'David', 'Harris', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'divorced', 'mother', 'two', 'pre-teen', 'children', 'boy', 'nearing', 'adulthood', 'TV', 'star', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'coupled', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'bikini', 'clad', 'body', 'round', 'out', 'main', 'cast.David', 'Harris', 'unknown', 'childhood', 'drives', 'want', 'perfect', 'family', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'family', 'seen', 'opening', 'film', 'Moving', 'new', 'city', 'changing', 'looks', 'name', 'always', 'paying', 'cash', 'David', 'Harris', 'new', 'victim', 'Staking', 'out', 'grocery', 'store', 'looking', 'perfect', 'surrogate', 'family', 'Harris', 'Susan', 'Harding', 'played', 'still', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'two', 'pre-teen', 'children', 'Seeing', 'perfect', 'father', 'family', 'Harris', 'charm', 'anew', 'Sometime', 'later', 'Susan', 'oldest', 'son', 'Michael', 'played', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'military', 'school', 'summer', 'plot', 'thickens', 'say', 'Unsure', 'position', 'family', 'Michael', 'time', 'adjusting', 'lounging', 'pool', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'played', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'David', 'pyschosis', 'surface', 'when', 'Michael', 'younger', 'brother', 'Sean', 'played', 'Braeden', 'Lemasters', 'mother', 'video', 'games', 'too', 'loudly', 'David', 'grabs', 'Sean', 'neck', 'hard', 'scaring', 'kid', 'submission', 'taking', 'job', 'showing', 'houses', 'Susan', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'doing', 'well', 'Jackie', 'personal', 'identification', 'tax', 'forms', 'David', 'quits', 'David', 'deals', 'intrusions', 'delusions', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'violence', 'can', 'guess', 'Michael', 'catches', 'David', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'trouble', 'soon', 'ensues', 'here', 'out', 'rest', 'predictable.I', 'think', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'character', 'incomplete', 'was', 'most', 'developed', 'Walsh', 'creepy', 'acting', 'helped', 'counter-act', 'weak', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'writers', 'left', 'When', 'strangling', 'family', 'estranged', 'father', 'basement', 'could', 'see', 'Dylan', 'eyes', 'not', 'anger', 'desparation', 'not', 'evil', 'fear', 'glances', 'hand', 'gestures', 'facial', 'gestures', 'appear', 'original', 'convincing', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'other', 'hand', 'character', 'way', 'too', 'trusting', 'bit', 'too', 'naive', 'less', 'convincing', 'Walsh', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'better', 'job', 'staying', 'fence', 'stepfather', 'Michael', 'envision', 'happier', 'idealized', 'family', 'first', 'willing', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'start', 'anew', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'handed', 'Badgley', 'more', 'character', 'did', 'rest', 'cast', 'contrast', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'blonde', 'bikini', 'depth', 'woman', 'intuition', 'too', 'late', 'Eye', 'candy', 'is.A', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'pacing', 'prologue', 'series', 'quick', 'cuts', 'allowing', 'audience', 'form', 'impressions', 'rather', 'take', 'fully', 'carnage', 'Slower', 'shots', 'location', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'lightly', 'developed', 'think', 'director', 'Nelson', 'McCormick', 'realizing', 'was', 'trouble', 'reacts', 'picking', 'up', 'pace', 'scenes', 'compensting', 'lack', 'story', 'development', 'McCormick', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'pool', 'scenes', 'let', 'camera', 'caress', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'supple', 'body', 'Quick', 'help', 'keep', 'film', 'pace', 'track', 'suspence', 'building', 'end', 'movie', 'blissfully', 'faster', 'other', 'key', 'ingredient', 'keeping', 'film', 'moving', 'suspense', 'building', 'music', 'Perhaps', 'overdone', 'parts', 'however', 'movie', 'needed', 'overemphasis', 'badly', 'keep', 'tension', 'fading.I', 'never', 'quite', 'came', 'up', 'great', 'profile', 'character', 'other', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'basic', 'need', 'family', 'could', 'conjecture', 'Edward', 'was', 'abused', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'abandoned', 'neglected', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'direct', 'references', 'Walsh', 'character', 'past', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'mere', 'slasher', 'movie', 'category', 'nothing', 'more', 'Watch', 'movie', 'only', 'are', 'looking', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'get', 'close', 'signicant', 'other']",N/A

1247411,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0021L8UYY,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""The Stepfather"" is a competent - though somewhat superfluous - remake of the relatively well-received horror flick of the same name (I mean, is it really necessary to be doing-over films from the `80s already?). As in the previous venture, the main character (Dylan Walsh) is a serial killer who woos unsuspecting young women (in this case, Sela Ward) with children into letting him move in as a apart of the family, then coldly dispatches them in a gruesome display of bloodletting and violence.The major difference between this version and the previous one is that the oldest child (Penn Badgley), who becomes convinced of the stepfather's true identity over time, has been changed from a daughter in the original to a son here, just as the daughter's psychiatrist has been converted into a lesbian aunt (Paige Turco) for this version.  Otherwise, the premise and the execution are virtually the same.As written by J.S. Caldone and directed by Nelson McCormick, ""The Stepfather"" is a relatively straightforward, conventional and restrained horror movie, heavier on the plot mechanics than on the blood.  There are times when the characters are almost absurdly nave and get themselves into predicaments that a few moments of cautious forethought might have helped them to avoid.  Heck, even the killer himself is prone to some pretty dumb moves at times, especially for a man who has ostensibly been plotting out his every move for years now.That being said, ""The Stepfather"" can't really help but pull you in, even with a somewhat lackluster climactic scene.",3,no more than competent,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,1561,"['Stepfather', 'competent', 'somewhat', 'superfluous', 'remake', 'relatively', 'well-received', 'horror', 'flick', 'same', 'name', 'mean', 'really', 'necessary', 'be', 'doing-over', 'films', '80s', 'already', 'previous', 'venture', 'main', 'character', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'woos', 'unsuspecting', 'young', 'women', 'case', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'children', 'letting', 'move', 'apart', 'family', 'then', 'coldly', 'gruesome', 'display', 'bloodletting', 'violence.The', 'major', 'difference', 'version', 'previous', 'one', 'oldest', 'child', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'who', 'convinced', 'stepfather', 'true', 'identity', 'time', 'been', 'changed', 'daughter', 'original', 'son', 'here', 'just', 'daughter', 'psychiatrist', 'been', 'converted', 'lesbian', 'aunt', 'Paige', 'Turco', 'version', 'Otherwise', 'premise', 'execution', 'are', 'virtually', 'same.As', 'written', 'J.S', 'Caldone', 'directed', 'Nelson', 'McCormick', 'Stepfather', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'conventional', 'restrained', 'horror', 'movie', 'heavier', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'blood', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'absurdly', 'nave', 'get', 'predicaments', 'few', 'moments', 'cautious', 'forethought', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'avoid', 'Heck', 'even', 'killer', 'prone', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'moves', 'times', 'especially', 'man', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'been', 'plotting', 'out', 'move', 'years', 'now.That', 'being', 'said', 'Stepfather', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'pull', 'even', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'climactic', 'scene']",N/A

1247413,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B0021L8UYY,Stuart Conover,"[1, 2]","Nelson McCormick directs this remake of the 1987 film that goes by the same name. While prior to this Nelson mostly has worked in television, the other film credit to his name was directing another horror remake the year before ""Prom Night."" This recent remake's screenplay was written by J.S. Cardone who also worked with nelson on Prom Night though has written a few other films previously.The story focuses around David Harris (Dylan Walsh from Nip/Tuck) and opens showing David finishing brutally murdering a family followed by skipping town. Now to start with if you are a loyal Nip/Tuck addict I'm about to insult you. Dylan Walsh can't act. Now I'm not someone who watches Nip/Tuck so maybe he actually can act and just choose not to for this film, which is quite possible. If you've seen the original 1987 version of The Stepfather it was also by no means groundbreaking but what absolutely made the movie was the performance of Terry O'Quinn in the first movie showing off his acting chops as someone who is genially insane and wants the perfect family. Dylan just not play a convincing David as he never comes near the absolute twisted evil that is required for the part.Now I understand a lot of writers are willing to sacrifice scenes and story to get a PG-13 rating, most of these writers also understand that horror movies are mainly for adults. So at this point in my little ranging David meets Susan (Sela Ward) and woos his way into her heart. Here has found the latest (in apparently a long string) of candidates for the wife to fit in and be part of his perfect family. He quickly also has the daughter feel comfortable with him and when the son returns home he is, at first, almost comfortable with him - that feeling of comfort ends quickly. While he is able to show himself off as the best potential husband in the world there are not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 people who are suspect of David.Amazingly 3 of these (the crazy cat lady across the street, the ex-husband who still cares, and the lesbian sister) who confront Susan about their concerns are all killed off. Of course I assume if you were a psycho killer attempting to make the perfect family than you would probably try to kill off anyone who was telling your seemingly perfect wife that she was in the wrong as well. The son is able to stay alive by just being comfortable enough with David to keep from pushing him too far.By the end of the movie it comes down to her semi-estranged son who is a 'bad boy' to save the day as clearly no one else is left alive to. Now I could be wrong but if you had 3 different people straight out tell you that you were making a mistake wouldn't you at least put some effort into investigating it?I want to be clear that I'm not being harsh on this movie since it's a remake. If done right I actually strongly enjoy a remake of a film. Take Dawn of the Dead for instance, one of George A. Romero's best works and the remake was",1,I tried a lobotomy to try to forget watching this,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2944,"['Nelson', 'McCormick', 'remake', '1987', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'prior', 'Nelson', 'mostly', 'worked', 'television', 'other', 'film', 'credit', 'name', 'was', 'directing', 'horror', 'remake', 'year', 'Prom', 'Night', 'recent', 'remake', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'J.S', 'Cardone', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'nelson', 'Prom', 'Night', 'written', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'previously.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'David', 'Harris', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Nip/Tuck', 'showing', 'David', 'finishing', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'family', 'followed', 'skipping', 'town', 'Now', 'start', 'are', 'loyal', 'Nip/Tuck', 'addict', ""'m"", 'insult', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'Nip/Tuck', 'so', 'maybe', 'actually', 'can', 'act', 'just', 'choose', 'not', 'film', 'quite', 'possible', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', '1987', 'version', 'Stepfather', 'was', 'also', 'means', 'groundbreaking', 'what', 'absolutely', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'performance', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'first', 'movie', 'showing', 'off', 'acting', 'chops', 'someone', 'who', 'genially', 'insane', 'perfect', 'family', 'Dylan', 'just', 'not', 'play', 'convincing', 'David', 'never', 'absolute', 'twisted', 'evil', 'required', 'part.Now', 'understand', 'lot', 'writers', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'scenes', 'story', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'most', 'writers', 'also', 'understand', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'mainly', 'adults', 'So', 'point', 'little', 'ranging', 'David', 'meets', 'Susan', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'woos', 'way', 'heart', 'Here', 'found', 'latest', 'apparently', 'long', 'string', 'candidates', 'wife', 'fit', 'be', 'part', 'perfect', 'family', 'quickly', 'also', 'daughter', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'when', 'son', 'home', 'first', 'almost', 'comfortable', 'feeling', 'comfort', 'ends', 'quickly', 'able', 'show', 'off', 'best', 'potential', 'husband', 'world', 'are', 'not', '1', 'not', '2', 'not', '3', '4', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'suspect', 'David.Amazingly', '3', 'crazy', 'cat', 'lady', 'street', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'still', 'lesbian', 'sister', 'who', 'confront', 'Susan', 'concerns', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'course', 'assume', 'were', 'psycho', 'killer', 'attempting', 'make', 'perfect', 'family', 'would', 'probably', 'try', 'kill', 'off', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'telling', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'wife', 'was', 'wrong', 'as', 'well', 'son', 'able', 'stay', 'alive', 'just', 'being', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'David', 'keep', 'pushing', 'too', 'far.By', 'end', 'movie', 'down', 'semi-estranged', 'son', 'who', ""'bad"", 'boy', 'save', 'day', 'clearly', 'one', 'else', 'left', 'alive', 'Now', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'had', '3', 'different', 'people', 'straight', 'out', 'tell', 'were', 'making', 'mistake', 'would', ""n't"", 'least', 'put', 'effort', 'investigating', 'want', 'be', 'clear', ""'m"", 'not', 'being', 'harsh', 'movie', 'remake', 'done', 'right', 'actually', 'strongly', 'enjoy', 'remake', 'film', 'Take', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'instance', 'one', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'best', 'works', 'remake', 'was']",N/A

It was a nice scene, almost surreal in how it was done. We know David is the family slasher as his charming self meets up with a new mommy (Sela Ward). After 6 months they are engaged. Her son Michael (Penn Badgley) initially takes to the new stepfather, but then starts to have his doubts as does other people. Michael's girlfriend (Amber Heard) provides the film with some token bikini eye candy.The movie concentrates mostly on the building of the new relationship and the clues David drops that he is not what he claims to be. As people figure out his identity, he must eliminate them one by one until we get to the expected climax scene, which even by modest slasher standards, was a bit of a let down.

1247415,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0021L8UYY,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 3]","I must confess that the major reason I went to see this movie was for Dylan Walsh.  Being a huge fan of his character Sean McNamara on the FX show ""Nip/Tuck"", I was enticed to see him play a different type of character.  Now I have seen Mr. Walsh in other things than Nip/Tuck or even this movie.  Does anyone remember ""Loverboy"" or ""Congo""?As for the wave of movie remakes in the past couple of years, I am not really into them.  This is just a signal that Hollywood and movie makers have run out of ideas.  I vaguely remember the original ""The Stepfather"" (circa 1987); from what I can recall it was a creepy little movie.  It was just recently released on DVD; I plan on picking it up.  I don't state or claim that this rendition of ""The Stepfather"" is better than the original.  Subsequently, I believe this remake is very entertaining and much better than I thought it would be.The plot is very simple and not the most original concept (per the remake factor), a man (Dylan Walsh) is a grifter/chameleon in the sense that he is looking for the perfect family.  Instead of meeting a woman and having children, he wants to insert himself in a family that is already established (minus a father).  Yet if the formula becomes inexhaustible the charlatan slowly slips into madness.Enter Susan (Sela Ward); she meets David (Dylan Walsh) the name being used for this charade.  Well to make a long story short David appears to be the perfect all American guy and everyone just loves him, save for Michael (Penn Badgley) the teenage son who doesn't believe David is everything he avows.  It isn't too long before David's past catches up with him and he releases his wrath.The movie was rated PG-13 which had me a bit concerned, but I felt the film makers did a good job living within these parameters.  I was rather taken back by how much Michael's girlfriend Kelly (Amber Heard) was ""pimped out"" in this movie.  In almost every scene she was in she was wearing either a skimpy bikini or revealing panties.  Not that I have a problem with this, alternately it was not a very discreet way to sell sex.As for the acting, it was pretty solid, much better than the story should permit.  Dylan Walsh was the glue that held this film together, he really had the ""psycho waiting to burst while under still waters"" down pat.  Many of the sub textures of his performance were strictly facial expressions; this is a sign of a fine performance.  If nothing else, this movie states that Mr. Walsh has range and is able to play a role.Overall, I found this movie to be a great way to escape life for 90 minutes (or so).  Will it win any awards? No. Will it be viewed better than the original?  Doubt it.  Will it be remembered 25 years from now?  Probably not, but anything is possible.  Is it entertaining? I would say yes.",4,The Stepfather: psycho waiting to burst while under still waters,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2807,"['must', 'confess', 'major', 'reason', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'character', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'FX', 'show', 'Nip/Tuck', 'was', 'enticed', 'see', 'play', 'different', 'type', 'character', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Walsh', 'other', 'things', 'Nip/Tuck', 'even', 'movie', 'anyone', 'remember', 'Loverboy', 'Congo', 'wave', 'movie', 'remakes', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'just', 'signal', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'run', 'ideas', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'original', 'Stepfather', 'circa', '1987', 'what', 'can', 'recall', 'was', 'creepy', 'little', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'plan', 'picking', 'do', ""n't"", 'state', 'claim', 'rendition', 'Stepfather', 'better', 'original', 'Subsequently', 'believe', 'remake', 'very', 'entertaining', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be.The', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'concept', 'remake', 'factor', 'man', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'grifter/chameleon', 'sense', 'looking', 'perfect', 'family', 'Instead', 'meeting', 'woman', 'having', 'children', 'insert', 'family', 'already', 'established', 'father', 'formula', 'inexhaustible', 'charlatan', 'slowly', 'madness.Enter', 'Susan', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'David', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'name', 'being', 'used', 'charade', 'Well', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'David', 'be', 'perfect', 'American', 'guy', 'everyone', 'just', 'save', 'Michael', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'David', 'everything', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'David', 'past', 'up', 'wrath.The', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'had', 'bit', 'concerned', 'felt', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'living', 'parameters', 'was', 'rather', 'taken', 'back', 'how', 'much', 'Michael', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'was', 'pimped', 'out', 'movie', 'almost', 'scene', 'was', 'was', 'wearing', 'skimpy', 'bikini', 'revealing', 'panties', 'Not', 'have', 'problem', 'alternately', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'discreet', 'way', 'sell', 'sex.As', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'should', 'permit', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'was', 'glue', 'held', 'film', 'together', 'really', 'had', 'psycho', 'waiting', 'burst', 'still', 'waters', 'down', 'pat', 'Many', 'sub', 'textures', 'performance', 'were', 'strictly', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sign', 'fine', 'performance', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Walsh', 'range', 'able', 'play', 'role.Overall', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'escape', 'life', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'Will', 'win', 'awards', 'Will', 'be', 'viewed', 'better', 'original', 'Doubt', 'Will', 'be', 'remembered', '25', 'years', 'now', 'Probably', 'not', 'anything', 'possible', 'entertaining', 'would', 'say', 'yes']",N/A
