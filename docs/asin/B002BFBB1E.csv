Espudo ""degrassiboi""","[0, 0]",I didnt by this box set from Amazon or any store instead i was at a pawn shop and bought it for only $40 which was way cheaper then what amazon had it for. Now i started watching it (I love the show) season 1 and season 2 nothing was wrong with them they played all the way through the disc were not ruined. How ever i looked at the other season and season 3 and 5 are missing the plastic case that season 2 had that holds the dvds. Insted they have the dvds in a plastic back on on a foam circle which is glued to the cover. Now im scared that the dvd in season 3 and 5 are ruined. I am just about getting ready to start season 3 so i will see of those dvd plays in the mean time i have to get a cd case to hold the cds from season 3 and 5.If your going to buy this see if you can buy it at a regular story,3,Love the show,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,807,"['didnt', 'box', 'set', 'Amazon', 'store', 'instead', 'i', 'was', 'pawn', 'shop', 'bought', 'only', '40', 'was', 'way', 'cheaper', 'then', 'what', 'amazon', 'had', 'Now', 'i', 'started', 'watching', 'love', 'show', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'nothing', 'was', 'wrong', 'played', 'way', 'disc', 'were', 'not', 'ruined', 'How', 'ever', 'i', 'looked', 'other', 'season', 'season', '3', '5', 'are', 'missing', 'plastic', 'case', 'season', '2', 'had', 'dvds', 'Insted', 'have', 'dvds', 'plastic', 'back', 'foam', 'circle', 'glued', 'cover', 'Now', 'scared', 'dvd', 'season', '3', '5', 'are', 'ruined', 'am', 'just', 'getting', 'ready', 'start', 'season', '3', 'so', 'i', 'will', 'see', 'dvd', 'plays', 'mean', 'time', 'i', 'have', 'get', 'cd', 'case', 'hold', 'cds', 'season', '3', '5.If', 'going', 'buy', 'see', 'can', 'buy', 'regular', 'story']",The Office: Seasons 1 - 5 Collection

However, you would want to have extra time in your day to watch.  The series show the life of a manager and his employees in an office.. (ironic since people want to get out of their offices and not think of work)  but it's a fun comedy and the characters (michael, jim and dwight) make the series worthwhile.i would recommend it to anyone.",5,Fun to watch,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,423,"['Office', 'fun', 'comedy', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'want', 'own', 'full', 'series', 'However', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'extra', 'time', 'day', 'watch', 'series', 'show', 'life', 'manager', 'employees', 'office..', 'ironic', 'people', 'want', 'get', 'offices', 'not', 'think', 'work', 'fun', 'comedy', 'characters', 'michael', 'jim', 'dwight', 'make', 'series', 'worthwhile.i', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone']",The Office: Seasons 1 - 5 Collection

Maybe I was simply lucky in terms of the quality of the DVDs that I received in my box set, but I only had an issue with one DVD which skipped at one part. That's it. No biggie. It's too bad that others have had problems with theirs, but you can always return the product if it turns out to be defective. I lucked out I guess.",5,Best 'Office' seasons.
