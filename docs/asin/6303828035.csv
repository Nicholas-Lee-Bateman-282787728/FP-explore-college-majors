In this movie a boy discovers that he can bring small action figures to life by using a small, old, wooden cupboard.  The first figure he brings to life is a Native American.  As the story progresses, the boy learns important lessons about life from his new friend, &quot;Little Bear.&quot;The story is exciting without being frightening, educational without being stuffy, and fun without being extreme.  &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; presents an excellent entertainment offering for pre-teens who often see too much programming centered on overstimulation of sight, sound, and action (e.g., Pokemon...).I also like the fact that the boy in the story doesn't look like he stepped right out of an advertising agency, or off of the cover of a magazine.  He is a regular guy...his hair is a little messy, his teeth haven't gone through an orthodontic program, and he wears normal clothes.All in all, this is top-notch entertainment for the whole family.

The cupboard has a lock, but no key. Fishing through a pile of keys belonging to his Mother, Omri finds one that fits the lock. It turns out to be a special key given to his Mother by her Mother just before she died. Omri iis allowed to keep it and so the adventure begins.You see something special happens to any toy locked away in this strange little cupboard, they come to life once unlocked. Conversely, toys that have been brought to life can be returned to their inanimate state when returned to the cupboard.At first it all seems great fun. Omri tests his magical box with various toys, a dinosaur and Darth Vader, but when he unlocks a small replica of an Iroquois Indian from the cabinet he discovers he's not just playing a game anymore. A living, breathing 19th century Indian warrior named Little Bear emerges. Little Bear is not just an animated toy, he is a real person with a real life that has been mysteriously plucked out of his 19th home and deposited in miniature form into Omri's twentieth century bedroom.Little Bear teaches Omri the meaning of being a warrior and taking responsibility for your own actions, scolding him for tampering with the lives of others he tells the young boy, ""You should not do magic you do not understand.""This is great family entertainment containing a message we should all take to heart. It's a message of tolerance and understanding towards cultures and people different from ourselves.The entire cast is terrific! The British medic (Steve Coogan) and the cowboy Boo-Hoo Boone (David Keith) were perfect in their supporting roles, while the two main characters Omri (Hal Scardino) and Little Bear (Litefoot) were absolutely magical together.

His friend wants a toy too so he puts the cowboy figure in and out comes a swaggering, funny David Keith as the gunslinger.  Britain's popular comic Steve Coogan shows up too as a British medic that the boys use to help when both the Indian and the cowboy are wounded.Adults may find it a little too ""cutesy"" but it's heart is in the right place and Scardino is an affecting little hero.

Alass, this movie took what could have been a wonderful adaptation, and turned it into a dumbed-down pile of insipid script and mostly forced acting. When I first saw it, I loved everything about it and immediately fell in love with the boy playing Omri, but now, I realize that his acting is horrible, but it's not his fault. The script is below mediocre; it's pitifully babyish. Lyn Reed Banks's stories had a charm of old-fashioned nostalgia to them, not so with this film. It has been completely modernized, including a few curse words, a relocation to the US, and a total emphasis on stereotyping the characters and making as many comical gags at their expense as possible. I will admit that there are several very touching moments, and even a little educational value to this, since Litefoot plays his character perfectly, and Frank Oz did feel inclined to at least include a song and a few sundry bits of the Iroquois language here.

386180,AQGISDG8KML8W,6303828035,"Quaker Annie ""reader""","[15, 17]","This video made it to our family library long ago. Entertaining, enjoyable  for adults and children, with relatively little violence (there are some  battle scenes), it opens up avenues for dinner time conversation about  reality, fantasy, Native Americans, friendship and bullies.  In addition,  watching this movie led us to the book series, which my then 6 year old  listened to intently.What we liked - fantasy mixed with reality, much  like Small Soldiers or E.T. (though not nearly as good as E.T.) With the  help of a magical key and cabinet, our hero, Omri, brings a figurine,  Little Bear,  to life (in miniature form).  He watches Little Bear build a  home and finds a wife for him.  Omri's best friend, Patrick, doesn't quite  understand the difference between play and real lives, and brings Boone, a  cowboy and his horse to life, setting off a small battle between the two  people.Boone brings a touch of comic relief to the film, which deals  with some serious issues.  Death is lightly touched on, when Omri's first  attempt to find a friend for Little Bear pushes an elderly figurine into  cardiac arrest, with serious effects on Omri's comprehension of his 'toys.'  War, too, is addressed slightly when he brings a tiny World War I medic  back to care for a miniscule character's real life wounds.Parallel to  this story is Omri's move into a new neighborhood, away from his best  friend and into some slight confrontations with bullies (further developed  in the sequel to this video).We started with the video, which led us to  the book series (by Lynne Reid Banks).  The video is almost as good as the  book, with convincing special effects, good acting, entertainment and more  meaningful after-movie talk than most children's.  A good view, and if you  get the version(s) with the figurines, they are very close to the movie  miniatures!Thumbs up from all of our family members - hope you enjoy it  (and read the books!!!)",4,Toy Story Comes To Life....,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,1945,"['video', 'made', 'family', 'library', 'long', 'ago', 'Entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'adults', 'children', 'relatively', 'little', 'violence', 'are', 'battle', 'scenes', 'up', 'avenues', 'dinner', 'time', 'conversation', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'Native', 'Americans', 'friendship', 'bullies', 'addition', 'watching', 'movie', 'led', 'book', 'series', 'then', '6', 'year', 'old', 'listened', 'liked', 'fantasy', 'mixed', 'reality', 'much', 'Small', 'Soldiers', 'E.T', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'E.T', 'help', 'magical', 'key', 'cabinet', 'hero', 'Omri', 'figurine', 'Little', 'Bear', 'life', 'miniature', 'form', 'Little', 'Bear', 'build', 'home', 'wife', 'Omri', 'best', 'friend', 'Patrick', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'difference', 'play', 'real', 'lives', 'Boone', 'cowboy', 'horse', 'life', 'setting', 'off', 'small', 'battle', 'two', 'people.Boone', 'touch', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'serious', 'issues', 'Death', 'lightly', 'touched', 'when', 'Omri', 'first', 'attempt', 'find', 'friend', 'Little', 'Bear', 'elderly', 'figurine', 'cardiac', 'arrest', 'serious', 'effects', 'Omri', 'comprehension', ""'toys"", 'War', 'too', 'addressed', 'slightly', 'when', 'tiny', 'World', 'War', 'medic', 'back', 'care', 'miniscule', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'wounds.Parallel', 'story', 'Omri', 'move', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'away', 'best', 'friend', 'slight', 'confrontations', 'bullies', 'further', 'developed', 'sequel', 'video', '.We', 'started', 'video', 'led', 'book', 'series', 'Lynne', 'Reid', 'Banks', 'video', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'convincing', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'acting', 'entertainment', 'more', 'meaningful', 'after-movie', 'talk', 'most', 'children', 'good', 'view', 'get', 'version', 's', 'figurines', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'movie', 'Thumbs', 'family', 'members', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'read', 'books']",N/A
