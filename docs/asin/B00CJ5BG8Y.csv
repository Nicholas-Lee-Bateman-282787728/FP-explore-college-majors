This movie isn't breaking any new group and is hardly breathtaking, but if you're looking for an upbeat movie with some laughs - then this could probably quench that thirst.Steve Carell delivers, as usual, a very sturdy and funny performance. Jim Carrey does Jim Carrey best by playing a very outlandish and over-the-top magician as well. The supporting characters are enough to keep you at least interested in the continuing plot of the movie and your main stars.The movie also has some nice slight-of-hand and magic tricks involved, and generally - it's a fun movie.

It is always enjoyable watching comic actors do what they do best, and this is no exception. Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, and Jim Carrey are all comically fun to watch.

For the moment however, he attracts enormous crowds, much as car wrecks do. This part of the story is very dark, not for the squeamish, and where the film is supposed to amuse there really are few laughs. In general it's a melancholy story, one of frustration and failure that a calculated happy ending doesn't fully redeem.As for Burt (Steve Carell) and partner in prestidigitation Anton (Steve Buscemi), these friends since boyhood have come to loathe each other. As their audience dwindles to a few oldsters, Anton wants to liven things up, to break free of the same old patter and tired tricks. Burt's giant ego won't allow him to agree and ultimately the two split after a heavily publicized outdoor stunt turns disastrous. Bizarrely, Burt continues the act alone and unchanged. He talks to a partner who's no longer there to answer, and tries to perform two-man tricks alone.The owner of the hotel & casino (James Gandolfini) that has been the home of Burt and Anton all these years fires the clueless Burt. It's just another step on the quick road to rock bottom oblivion for the ""incredible"" Burt Wonderstone, and it may take more than magic to restore him.Help comes from the unlikeliest place when Burt meets his boyhood idol, magician Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) who's now a crochety old man. Rance agrees that Gray is no magician, but he has his doubts about Burt, too...",3,"""Let me tell you about Steve Gray. All that guy does is mumble and cut himself. Anybody can do that.

Heck, it may not even be a good one.It's surely derivative, and even though Jim Carrey has his standard moments of brilliance, I kept thinking that I've seen it all before.  There was a scene that reminded me of ""The Jerk""; I can't remember what that scene was even 12 hours after watching.  And there is a ripoff of the old Ricky Bobby line:  ""With all due respect. . . "" and then the subsequent insult, which is all OK of course because of the ""respect"" part that came before it.But as you should know -- and as the critics know but ignore anyways -- these types of movies aren't created to stimulate your brain.  In any way.  But they are made to stimulate your funny bone, and it surely does that here and there.It was strange to see James Gandolfini here, so soon after he died.  Some people may say, ""Oh, it's too soon!  Is it OK to watch this film anyways?""  Of course it is; this is America, after all, and we are free to do whatever we want.  And we are free to watch Steve Buschemi get openly ridiculed for being, err, not a pretty boy, to put it nicely, and I really liked the fact that Mr. Buschemi seems to just take it in stride.  While he certainly doesn't have the prettiest skin, he does have some seriously thick skin.

He receives a &#34;Rance Halloway&#34; magic set for his birthday and is so thrilled...now he has a way to make everyone like him!Well, the only one who seems to like him is his new friend, played by Steve Buscemi.  They grow up doing magic tricks together...and finally discover fame and fortune in Sin City as The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton:  A MAGICAL FRIENDSHIP!However......underneath the public &#34;magical friendship,&#34; Burt and Anton have started to loathe each other....mostly due to Burt Wonderstone's incredible growing ego!Yes, Burt Wonderstone has turned into a very unlikable  oaf.  Plus, he has grown weary of performing magic - the thrill, as they say, is gone for him.Enter Jim Carey's character:  a guerilla street magician who delivers thrills during his edgy new-style magic show called Brain Rapist.  Brain Rapist is really more about gross outs and pure endurance as opposed to real magic...but no matter...the younger audience loves his act.  They love it a lot more than the &#34;old fashioned&#34; sort of magic delivered by Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton!So there is the set-up for this movie.  There is also a woman involved, along with Alan Arkan playing Rance Halloway, the old-time magician who first sparked Burt's love of magic.Can Rance help Burt rediscover his love of magic?Will Burt and Anton become &#34;magical friends&#34; once again?But most importantly, IS THIS MOVIE FUNNY?Well, I'll tell you.....I found the movie funnier the SECOND time I watched it!

A few years back a magician named David Blaine came onto the scene doing street magic that changed the way everybody looked at the business. The traditional magic show lost its luster a little bit. People like David Copperfield and acts like Siegfried & Roy became a stale and overdone display. When Blaine sort of stepped out of the limelight, a magician named Criss Angel took over and took street magic to a whole new level. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is an obvious poke at Criss Angel and a imalgorithm of Copperfield, Siegfried & Roy.Criss Angel's television show is called ""Mind Freak"". Jim Carrey plays a character named Steve Gray, who's television show is called ""Brain Rape"". So, as you can see, there is no hiding who the target of the movies jokes are for. Gray is a guy who is doing crazy tricks like driving nails into tables with his head or pulling cards out of his bloody cheek. So when Gray starts gaining popularity and Wonderstone's (Steve Carell) ticket sales begin to drop, as you can guess, Burt and his partner Anton's (Steve Buscemi) ride at the top of the magic world comes crashing down.Alan Arkin, James Gandolfini and Olivia Wilde round out a nice cast of characters who put on a good show. Surprisingly though, with comedians like Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, I didn't find ""Wonderstone"" all that funny. Yet, there are a few moments that I was glad that I was the only one in the movie theatre on a beautiful Friday afternoon because I laughed harder than I had in a long time. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is mildly funny for the most part but that doesn't stop it from having an interesting concept that is always interesting to watch. I mean, who doesn't like a good magic show.The creators could have taken this incredible concept movie to a better level in my opinion, but to their credit, they never cheapened their film with gimmick jokes or crudeness. As I said in the beginning though, the comedic angle on magicians in Las Vegas is a fresh one. I just wish that the comedy had been more effective throughout the film, instead of just at certain times. It was fun to take a trip to Vegas for a bit though, and it was fun to take a different look at a always interesting and mysterious business.",3,"MOMENTS of hilarity, but mostly pretty plain",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2374,"['amazing', 'concept', 'yet', 'be', 'explored', 'Hollywood', 'guess', 'inevitable', 'eventually', 'happened', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'magician', 'named', 'David', 'Blaine', 'came', 'scene', 'doing', 'street', 'magic', 'changed', 'way', 'everybody', 'looked', 'business', 'traditional', 'magic', 'show', 'lost', 'luster', 'little', 'bit', 'People', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'acts', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'became', 'stale', 'overdone', 'display', 'When', 'Blaine', 'sort', 'stepped', 'limelight', 'magician', 'named', 'Criss', 'Angel', 'took', 'over', 'took', 'street', 'magic', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'obvious', 'poke', 'Criss', 'Angel', 'imalgorithm', 'Copperfield', 'Siegfried', 'Roy.Criss', 'Angel', 'television', 'show', 'called', 'Mind', 'Freak', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'character', 'named', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'who', 'television', 'show', 'called', 'Brain', 'Rape', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'hiding', 'who', 'target', 'movies', 'jokes', 'are', 'Gray', 'guy', 'who', 'doing', 'crazy', 'tricks', 'driving', 'nails', 'tables', 'head', 'pulling', 'cards', 'bloody', 'cheek', 'So', 'when', 'Gray', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'Wonderstone', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'ticket', 'sales', 'begin', 'drop', 'can', 'guess', 'Burt', 'partner', 'Anton', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'ride', 'top', 'magic', 'world', 'crashing', 'down.Alan', 'Arkin', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'round', 'out', 'nice', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'Surprisingly', 'comedians', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Wonderstone', 'funny', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'theatre', 'beautiful', 'Friday', 'afternoon', 'laughed', 'harder', 'had', 'long', 'time', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'mildly', 'funny', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'stop', 'having', 'interesting', 'concept', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'mean', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'good', 'magic', 'show.The', 'creators', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'incredible', 'concept', 'movie', 'better', 'level', 'opinion', 'credit', 'never', 'cheapened', 'film', 'gimmick', 'jokes', 'crudeness', 'said', 'beginning', 'comedic', 'angle', 'magicians', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'fresh', 'one', 'just', 'wish', 'comedy', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'film', 'instead', 'just', 'certain', 'times', 'was', 'fun', 'take', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'bit', 'was', 'fun', 'take', 'different', 'look', 'always', 'interesting', 'mysterious', 'business']",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone

I loved the way his character is used in the finale, and it's one of the most memorable moments for me this year at the movies.  Add to that I was laughing so hard at the ending credits' depiction of what happens to the magician duo's big illusion set piece as time goes on that my friend turned to me and said ""It's funny, but it's not THAT funny"" because I was lost in laughing so hard I was practically losing my breath.  As I've noticed many times in life, comedy is personal, and this one happened to be fascinating and entertaining to me on several levels.  I love variety acts, and magicians in particular.

I had never seen Olivia Wilde before and thought her wonderful in this.

1648292,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00CJ5BG8Y,C. Sawin,"[2, 5]","""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is the worn out story of a young boy discovering magic to make up for his inability to mesh well with society. His magic attracts another boy who is the only kid in school nerdier than he is and a magical friendship is born. Ten years later and the two of them are headlining one of the biggest hotels in Las Vegas. But in the present day, Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and his over inflated ego have more than taken their toll on his partner Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi). Their dated act is overshadowed by the sickening antics of an obnoxious street magician named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey). Now with a five year contract on the line, it's a magician's battle royal to see who can be proclaimed the king of Las Vegas.This film is like one big, unfunny jab at Siegfried and Roy. The suggestive commentary becomes overwhelming only ten minutes in. You witness Burt and Anton's act a total of three times and it isn't anything to brag about the first time around. Are they taking volunteers for the hangman illusion? You might consider signing up just to make it easier to get away from this monstrosity sooner.All of the humor rests on the shoulders of Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, and Jim Carrey who only seem to act like jackasses whenever the camera is put on them. The humor feels too juvenile to properly hit its mark. ""Oh, I have to pee,"" ""My bed is the biggest in Vegas,"" and ""we've been together so long that I can't stand the sight of you."" The rest of the time the comedy is just yelling and making stupid faces, which loses what little charm it had to begin with once Steve Gray doesn't blink for like 72 hours and shoots pepper spray in his eyes.Alan Arkin is the best part of this dog and pony show, but even he seems like he doesn't really want to be there. There are a few snicker worthy moments while Burt Wonderstone is trying to adjust to being poor and the restaurant scene where Burt and Anton are reunited is slightly humorous, but is really just expanded on from a bit in ""Anchorman.""""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is the age old tale of out with the old and in with the new and is mostly just a groansfest from beginning to end. Grown individuals shouting at each other, stomping around, and acting childish when they don't get their way gets massively tiresome really fast and ""Burt Wonderstone"" doesn't know when to quit while it's ahead.

Steve Carell is a sometimes effective comic actor who, at his best, conveys an appealing mixture of nebbishness and melancholy -you wind up rooting for him even through miscue and miscue. And he's mildly effective as caricature -see, for instance, Dinner for Schmucks, not a great movie but Carell's part works. Plus, we like Carell. Steve Buscemi is another actor rather than comedian who usually brings a great deal to his roles. Fargo was his best but he's turned in solid performances in any number of movies. At his best, Jim Carey is a brilliant comic actor.  He isn't always good, sometimes he's just excessive, but he's absolutely fearless as an actor. At his best, he does the kind of comedy that made Andy Kaufman brilliant. (Carey played Kaufman in 1999's Man on the Moon.)  He's a better mugger than Kaufman but maybe because of that, not quite as far out, but he radiates energy all over when he's on screen. And Alan Arkin! What can I say? A genius and great comic.  As far as its cast goes, this movie should have sizzled.But it doesn't. The movie is overblown, over-sentimental, and, worst of all, soggy. Everything's signaled way too obviously. It blows its opportunities for being either real satire or a real love story. (The love sequence is trite. It climaxes -bad choice of words, probably- in a scene in bed with a young woman magician, played by Olivia Wilde, in which both magicians, through sleight of hand, produce condoms. I didn't find the scene funny and it certainly wasn't romantic.)Carell plays Burt Wonderstone, who with his childhood friend, Anton Marvelton (played by Buscemi) has been doing magic since childhood. Burt and Anton have now been headliners in Vegas for over ten years. Their performance is tired, no life in it any more, and their audience is drifting away, lured by more exciting performers. Old is bad, New is good. Along comes Steve Gray (Carey), a charismatic street performer who hosts a weekly television show where he does such revolting stunts as holding in his urine for weeks on end and sleeping on a bed of hot coals. His climactic stunt comes in a showoff contest with Burt where he drills a hole in his head with a power drill.  It's not funny, and it's cruel.That's one of the problems with this movie. Where the movie isn't hackneyed, it's usually off base in its sense of humor. Too much Potty Humor -and too many scenes where the laughs are supposed to be provoked by watching someone be abused.  It's mean spirited.There are some good scenes in this movie, just not many of them. There are some scenes between Burt and his childhood inspiration, Rance Holloway (played by Arkin). Holloway is old now, long since retired, but Burt draws him out again. There is a lovely scene -all too soon over- where Burt and Rance try out their fledgling magic act on the old folks at Rance's retirement home, and the start of a scene where Burt puts on his act for a children's birthday party -but this second scene quickly turns nasty when Gray/Carey intrudes, and it's downhill from then on.It looks like a lot of money was spent on special effects in this movie. Why is it, then, that the most magical moments are two when ordinary magic tricks are performed, depending not on camera wizardry or digital re-imaging but on the magician's legerdemain?This could have been a really wonderful movie but it certainly didn't come out one.",2,"GOOD STARS, BUT A DISAPPOINTING RESULT",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,3680,"['want', 'see', 'how', 'perfectly', 'awful', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'produced', 'talented', 'actors', 'big', 'enough', 'budget', 'do', 'wowza', 'special', 'effects', 'tricks', 'see', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'probably', 'mark', 'year', 'Rotten', 'Tomato', 'awards.We', 'saw', 'cast', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'sometimes', 'effective', 'comic', 'actor', 'who', 'best', 'conveys', 'appealing', 'mixture', 'nebbishness', 'melancholy', '-you', 'wind', 'up', 'rooting', 'even', 'miscue', 'miscue', 'mildly', 'effective', 'caricature', '-see', 'instance', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Carell', 'part', 'like', 'Carell', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'actor', 'rather', 'comedian', 'who', 'usually', 'great', 'deal', 'roles', 'Fargo', 'was', 'best', 'turned', 'solid', 'performances', 'number', 'movies', 'best', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'actor', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'sometimes', 'just', 'excessive', 'absolutely', 'fearless', 'actor', 'best', 'kind', 'comedy', 'made', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'brilliant', 'Carey', 'played', 'Kaufman', '1999', 'Man', 'Moon', 'better', 'mugger', 'Kaufman', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'far', 'energy', 'when', 'screen', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'genius', 'great', 'comic', 'As', 'far', 'cast', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'sizzled.But', ""n't"", 'movie', 'overblown', 'over-sentimental', 'worst', 'soggy', 'Everything', 'signaled', 'way', 'too', 'obviously', 'opportunities', 'being', 'real', 'satire', 'real', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'sequence', 'trite', 'climaxes', '-bad', 'choice', 'words', 'probably-', 'scene', 'bed', 'young', 'woman', 'magician', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'magicians', 'sleight', 'hand', 'produce', 'condoms', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scene', 'funny', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'Carell', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'who', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Anton', 'Marvelton', 'played', 'Buscemi', 'been', 'doing', 'magic', 'childhood', 'Burt', 'Anton', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'headliners', 'Vegas', 'ten', 'years', 'performance', 'tired', 'life', 'more', 'audience', 'drifting', 'away', 'lured', 'more', 'exciting', 'performers', 'Old', 'bad', 'New', 'good', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'Carey', 'charismatic', 'street', 'performer', 'who', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'where', 'such', 'revolting', 'stunts', 'holding', 'urine', 'weeks', 'end', 'sleeping', 'bed', 'hot', 'coals', 'climactic', 'stunt', 'showoff', 'contest', 'Burt', 'where', 'hole', 'head', 'power', 'drill', 'not', 'funny', 'cruel.That', 'one', 'problems', 'movie', 'Where', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hackneyed', 'usually', 'off', 'base', 'sense', 'humor', 'Too', 'much', 'Potty', 'Humor', '-and', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'laughs', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'provoked', 'watching', 'someone', 'be', 'abused', 'mean', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'many', 'are', 'scenes', 'Burt', 'childhood', 'inspiration', 'Rance', 'Holloway', 'played', 'Arkin', 'Holloway', 'old', 'now', 'long', 'retired', 'Burt', 'out', 'again', 'lovely', 'scene', '-all', 'too', 'soon', 'over-', 'where', 'Burt', 'Rance', 'try', 'out', 'fledgling', 'magic', 'act', 'old', 'folks', 'Rance', 'retirement', 'home', 'start', 'scene', 'where', 'Burt', 'act', 'children', 'birthday', 'party', '-but', 'second', 'scene', 'quickly', 'nasty', 'when', 'Gray/Carey', 'downhill', 'then', 'on.It', 'looks', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'Why', 'then', 'most', 'magical', 'moments', 'are', 'two', 'when', 'ordinary', 'magic', 'tricks', 'are', 'performed', 'depending', 'not', 'camera', 'wizardry', 'digital', 're-imaging', 'magician', 'legerdemain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'one']",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone

It's a light, predictable comedy with a few good laughs and a wealth of filler material. Although Steve Buscemi and Jim Carrey appear in supporting roles, the spotlight is largely reserved for Steve Carell, who's merely okay as an out-of-touch, egomaniacal Las Vegas magician. Carrey is particularly wasted in his role, a Criss Angel-David Blaine hybrid that amounts to little more than a barbed punchline, and doesn't even receive the dignity of an endgame. The film is at its most entertaining when Carell is insufferable, a snobby celebrity lost in his own self-image, but quickly loses steam when Carrey's grim not-quite-magic act forces him to wake up. The plot becomes fairly paint-by-numbers from there, with a tour of skid row and a telegraphed love interest (Olivia Wilde) lining Wonderstone's path to redemption, and navigates no sharp turns on its way to an empty happy ending.

Burt has become an egotistical womanizer, while his partner chafes at his second banana status.  When a Jackass-like imposter, played by Jim Carrey appears on the scene  offering an irresistible alternative (he also uses a newfangled video camera to record the stunts), the pair is considered obsolete and dumped by their sponsor. Burt's character arc is identical to so many Will Ferrell roles, in which the guy whose ego needs serious deflating, must deal with a heavy load of Life Lessons in order to be redeemed and become a better person.Will Ferrell could have done the Steve Carrell role in his sleep, and I found myself wishing that he was the lead instead.  Buscemi seems kind of out-of-it, and Jim's stunts didn't seem particularly dramatic, horrifying or repulsive in this day and age, when anything can be posted on YouTube.

1648314,A26SV90ILK5BNO,B00CJ5BG8Y,Ethan,"[3, 6]","When I entered the theater to view The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, I thought I knew exactly what I was getting into. The film was advertised as a comedy. With stars Steve Carell and Jim Carrey, this film seemed to seem in the same style as the stars' other collaboration, Bruce Almighty.The movie begins promising enough. We learn of Burt's (Carell) difficult childhood. A typical nerd, loner type who found himself bullied by all but one kid, Anton (played by Steve Buscemi), Burt finds refuge in a magic kit. This passion leads the two, Burt and Anton, to eventually become partners in a magic act. Soon they are headlining a show in Las Vegas, and they seem to be on top of the world.Fast forward ten years, and the two are still performing the same act at the same hotel. The show has not aged well. The first time we see the two perform the show, comedy is found not in the wackiness of the production but just by the observation of how stupid and outdated it is. Underneath the bright lights of showbiz, larger problems arise. Burt and Anton resent each other and can't even make it between set pieces without arguing. Burt has become a womanizing egomaniac who thinks the entire act revolves around him. With their relationship in turmoil and ticket sales falling, the two are urged by the hotel owner (James Gandolfini) to ""freshen up"" their act.Their assistant, Jane (Olivia Wilde) attempts to help them with the new act. But Burt's ego won't allow it. Soon, Anton leaves the act and the hotel discontinues the show. Burt finds himself out of work and with no one to turn to. It seems that magic has been replaced by the grotesque stunts as performed by Steve Gray ( Jim Carrey), kind of a cross between Chris Angel and David Blaine.On a whim, Burt ends up performing at the nursing home that houses his own magician idol, played by Alan Arkin of Little Miss Sunshine and more recently Argo. With his help, Burt sets out to rekindle his love of magic and to rebuild his life.As always, Jim Carrey is perfect at capturing the crazy and absurd character. He is really a scene stealer in this film. Unfortunately, I'm not convinced that this movie really needed that kind of character. It sets out to be this off the wall comedy in the style of Will Ferrell, but Steve Carell is a completely different kind of actor. His dry, often quiet delivery just doesn't work here. There are few moments in the movie that caused me to laugh out loud, and with the way the film played at the box office, I fear that is the case for most viewers. This movie may have worked as a smaller, somewhat quirky tale of a man's path to self discovery.

In that film the movie was screened and labeled a bomb, so the studio dumped $6 Million on Eddie Morphy to shoot a handful of scenes. Those scenes were then edited into the ""bomb"" and Eddie Murphy's name made top billing even though he was in just 6 minutes. Murphy later said it almost ruined his career.Now Jim Carey was certainly in the movie more than 6 minutes, but the interaction between Carey and Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi is so limited at the start I wondered if he was added in as an afterthought. Even the credits state ""Starring Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi"" leaving Cary out.It might be a good career move to be left out of this billing for Carey since his last several movies hae been less than spectacular. What happened to the ""Bruce Almighty"" Jim? It seems he is doing the Eddie Murphy career dive only without the Disney-esque personality change.Buscemi is one of my favorite actors, but miscast as the Steve Carell side-kick. He is just not believable. I think Buscemi would have been better in the role the late Gandolfini had. Although not miscast, Gandolfini was just not ethnic enough for the way the character was written. It seemed to me the character of the casino owner was kind of bland, where it could have been amazing.As long as I'm pooping on everyone, I should excrete equally on Steve Carell since he was equally responsible for this movie's failure. Come on STEVE! Please don't just play the same guy over and over like Jerry Lewis. You are an amazing actor, so come up with something new. If the director does not have the vision to let you be the great star you are then punch him/her in the nasty bits. Sometimes you have to just say NO to playing the same character over and over again.The movie had its funny moments but was very predictable. The only unexpected scene was the Buscemi goes to Africa segment. But the rest we all saw coming.It does not even make sense in the continuity and timeline for much of the film.Don't pay for this, wait until it's on free TV. It's not so bad for free.

1648318,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00CJ5BG8Y,FNDNreview,"[3, 11]","There are some actors that are better off staying on television.  It's a fact, because there's obviously a massive difference between movies and television.  No - this isn't going to be a lecture about poor acting, but it is a reminder that television success does not always translate well to the big screen.  Yes, movie stars have occasionally made the trip to television (which works, sometimes), but movie-goers and TV watchers have difference expectations.  If a television show has a bad episode, they can possibly right the ship in the next episode or even the following season - but failure on the big screen is a much grander debacle because it's permanent.  The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a perfect example of TV stars failing miserably on the big screen.  Wonderstore features actors/actress that either are or have been successful on television.  With that point being stated, we will continue with this subject in a moment, but first...here's the synopsis for The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.Directed by Don Scardino (NBC's 30 Rock), The Incredible Burt Wonderstone stars Steve Carell  as Burt Wonderstone, a successful Las Vegas magician that began practicing magic as a boy.  Along with his stage partner and best friend, Anton Marvelton (Steve Busemi), the pair stars in a once popular magic show that goes stale and becomes too predictable to maintain an audience.  Eventually, the lack of success forces the pair to end their friendship and go their separate ways.  At the same time, a new ""magician,"" Steve Gray (Jim Carrey), comes to town with a ""shock-and-awe"" street act that garners a great deal of attention - essentially putting Wonderstone's act out of business.  Trying to find his confidence and revitalize his career, Wonderstone attempts to rekindle his friendship with his former friend/partner and take back the spotlight.  Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin, and James Gandolfini also star in supporting roles.Unless you're a fan of The Office, Steve Carell can be a tough individual to digest - mostly because his brand of humor is so awkward (often times dry) that viewers easily be turned off by it.  However, in his defense, he's usually one of those actors that you either love or hate - possibly love to hate.  Keep in my, most of his fans enjoyed his television performance on The Office, but since he's left the show, he has obviously made the transition to film - with a series of questionable roles.  In typical Carell fashion, his new role as Burt Wonderstone is on par with the roles he usually plays in film and on television, as a sort of outcast that lacks confidence, yet somehow rises to the occasion to achieve his goal just in time for the credits to roll.As it pertains to Wonderstone, this film is by far and away Carell's worst film role to date.  This particular comedy (if you should even call it that) is a combination of a poorly written script (not to mention ridiculous plot) and a bland sense of humor.  His attempt to create laughs in this film is feeble and childish, making for a long, long viewing experience.  Steve Busemi's presence in this film is also quite out of place, since he's currently pretty well-known as playing the leading role in the HBO gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire.  And, while this should have been an easy role for Busemi to pass on, there he is in all of his dull-witted, poorly written glory - and not nearly as entertaining as his previous cameos in films, such as Grown Ups or I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.  The only saving grace (in the acting department) is Olivia Wilde and James Gandolfini (also both television stars on the big screen), who are both charming and amusing in their respective roles.  And, let's not forget to mention the always delightful wit of Alan Arkin, who is always a treat to watch.Anytime you're going to watch a film, you should always give a film the benefit of the doubt before judging it, but Wonderstone fails in every single department.  Not only does Wonderstone fail to deliver the laughs, it fails miserably with the plot.  The ending is even more bothersome, since it lacks the ""wow"" factor that should come from a movie about magic - and frankly, it will have you thinking about making a quick break for an exit.  If there was ever a movie that you should save your money on...look no further than The (less than) Incredible Burt Wonderstone.P.S. - For those wondering about Jim Carrey's role - complete letdown is the nicest way to describe it.Overall Film Grade: D-FNDNreview.com",1,The (less than) Incredible Burt Wonderstone,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,4515,"['are', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'staying', 'television', 'fact', 'obviously', 'massive', 'difference', 'movies', 'television', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'lecture', 'poor', 'acting', 'reminder', 'television', 'success', 'not', 'always', 'translate', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Yes', 'movie', 'stars', 'have', 'occasionally', 'made', 'trip', 'television', 'sometimes', 'movie-goers', 'TV', 'watchers', 'have', 'difference', 'expectations', 'television', 'show', 'bad', 'episode', 'can', 'possibly', 'right', 'ship', 'next', 'episode', 'even', 'following', 'season', 'failure', 'big', 'screen', 'much', 'grander', 'debacle', 'permanent', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'perfect', 'example', 'TV', 'stars', 'failing', 'miserably', 'big', 'screen', 'Wonderstore', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'television', 'point', 'being', 'stated', 'will', 'continue', 'subject', 'moment', 'first', 'here', 'synopsis', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone.Directed', 'Don', 'Scardino', 'NBC', '30', 'Rock', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'successful', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'magician', 'began', 'practicing', 'magic', 'boy', 'stage', 'partner', 'best', 'friend', 'Anton', 'Marvelton', 'Steve', 'Busemi', 'pair', 'once', 'popular', 'magic', 'show', 'stale', 'too', 'predictable', 'maintain', 'audience', 'Eventually', 'lack', 'success', 'forces', 'pair', 'end', 'friendship', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'magician', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'town', 'shock-and-awe', 'street', 'act', 'great', 'deal', 'attention', 'essentially', 'putting', 'Wonderstone', 'act', 'business', 'Trying', 'find', 'confidence', 'revitalize', 'career', 'Wonderstone', 'rekindle', 'friendship', 'former', 'friend/partner', 'take', 'back', 'spotlight', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.Unless', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Office', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'individual', 'digest', 'mostly', 'brand', 'humor', 'so', 'awkward', 'often', 'dry', 'viewers', 'easily', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'However', 'defense', 'usually', 'one', 'actors', 'love', 'hate', 'possibly', 'love', 'hate', 'Keep', 'most', 'fans', 'enjoyed', 'television', 'performance', 'Office', 'left', 'show', 'obviously', 'made', 'transition', 'film', 'series', 'questionable', 'roles', 'typical', 'Carell', 'fashion', 'new', 'role', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'par', 'roles', 'usually', 'film', 'television', 'sort', 'outcast', 'confidence', 'somehow', 'occasion', 'achieve', 'goal', 'just', 'time', 'credits', 'roll.As', 'Wonderstone', 'film', 'far', 'away', 'Carell', 'worst', 'film', 'role', 'date', 'particular', 'comedy', 'should', 'even', 'call', 'combination', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'not', 'mention', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'bland', 'sense', 'humor', 'attempt', 'create', 'laughs', 'film', 'feeble', 'childish', 'making', 'long', 'long', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Steve', 'Busemi', 'presence', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'place', 'currently', 'pretty', 'well-known', 'playing', 'leading', 'role', 'HBO', 'gangster', 'drama', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'role', 'Busemi', 'pass', 'dull-witted', 'poorly', 'written', 'glory', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'entertaining', 'previous', 'cameos', 'films', 'such', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'acting', 'department', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'also', 'television', 'stars', 'big', 'screen', 'who', 'are', 'charming', 'amusing', 'respective', 'roles', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'always', 'delightful', 'wit', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'always', 'treat', 'watch.Anytime', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'film', 'should', 'always', 'give', 'film', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'judging', 'Wonderstone', 'single', 'department', 'Not', 'only', 'Wonderstone', 'fail', 'deliver', 'laughs', 'miserably', 'plot', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'bothersome', 'wow', 'factor', 'should', 'come', 'movie', 'magic', 'frankly', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'making', 'quick', 'break', 'exit', 'was', 'ever', 'movie', 'should', 'save', 'money', 'look', 'further', 'less', 'Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone.P.S', 'wondering', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'complete', 'letdown', 'nicest', 'way', 'describe', 'it.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'D-FNDNreview.com']",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone

1648322,AU10YGO10MUCA,B00CJ5BG8Y,Gary Lee,"[0, 2]","*Spoilers*  I watched this film at a family event with my young grandchildren.  Their parents thought these restless kiddos on a hot summer night might be diverted by a movie about magic.  But BURT ""WONDERBALLS"" is raunchy, full of adult humor, and, possibly most disturbing of all for young children, contains gory and frightening masochistic stunts by the Jim Carrey character.  Oops.  Back to HUGO for the little ones.  That film truly captures the magic of illusion, and has a protagonist kids can relate to.WONDERSTONE is a highly predictable Hollywood product that has some funny moments, but a lot of the jokes a fall flat.  Magic stunts pop up throughout the movie, but most look like wizardry, not magic.  They aren't believable in the way that theatrical magic must have a tantalizing plausibility to it no matter how mystifying the stunt may be.  Consider MARY POPPINS (this example may apply to Harry Potter as well, but I'm not as familiar with those films).  When Mary Poppins is on the scene, magic loses its suspense--you know she can't fail--and thus there is no ""hold your breath"" quality as to whether she can pull it off, no sigh of relief and admiration when she does, no wonder as to how the heck she did that.  Poppins' invincibility established the supernatural nature of her character and thus worked fine in the Disney film.  But WONDERSTONE's characters are most definitely mere mortals.The script is actually not terrible as it trods the formulaic path of a cad (narcissistic idiot Burt Wonderstone, superstar magician on the Vegas Strip) whose arrogance leads to his downfall (fresh competition by a punk magician on the street prompts a disastrous attempt by Wonderstone and his partner to update their image), abandonment (partner leaves act, casino owner fires Wonderstone), and learning life lessons(abetted by hot babe and elder magician).  All ending, of course, with climactic vanquishing of competitor, romantic conquest of aforementioned hot babe, and triumphant reunion with alienated friend and partner.  Yawn.  I mean, we've seen it all a million times before, just dressed up with some magic this time.Carell is an actor who is great at projecting withering self-doubt and insecurity, but not at conveying Wonderstone's overbearing self-confidence and hubris.  Watching him flounder in the lead only made me wonder whether a master at portraying comic self-delusion like Peter Sellers could have made this a memorable picture.  Steve Buscemi as Wonderstone's put-upon partner looks too old to have been Wonderstone's childhood buddy, and he's not much of a comedian.  Jim Carrey as Wonderstone's revolting rival is his usual manic, mildly amusing self.  James Gandolfini as the casino tycoon says his lines competently and collects his paycheck.  Alan Arkin as Wonderstone's retired muse is the true magician here, showing what wonders an acting veteran can do with mediocre material.  Olivia Wilde as the love interest looks pretty and seems to have a sense of humor about the whole thing.While the subject of the barbs might seem to be outsized show business egos and excesses, I think the real target is modern audiences' thirst for ever more bizarre and perilous types of entertainment, exemplified by the over-the-top Vegas scene portrayed here, and even more specifically, by this very movie.  In that sense, BURT WONDERSTONE is a film that satirizes itself.  Too bad it doesn't have the guts to do so more savagely, in a DR. STRANGELOVE sort of way.

Denick,"[0, 0]","This movie seems to be a love it or hate it type affair, but I didn't see it that way- I thought it was very funny for the most part, worthy of four stars, but certainly not a future classic. I loved seeing Steve Carrell, Steve Buscemi, and Jim Carey prancing about in long, luxurious wigs, spoofing on all the stereotypes of the flamboyant magician. Alan Arkin also does a great job as Rance Holloway, very funny stuff! To me, Jim Carey stole the show as up and coming street illusionist Steve Gray. His array of absurd ""tricks"", such as becoming a human pinata, were just the right touch of poking fun at the ""Mind Freak"" guy. His personality was hilarious, as was his ridiculous appearance, including chain tattoos across his body and rock star hair. Yes, the movie is predictable and rather sophomoric, but that's what it's supposed to be... this is a comedy designed to be silly and outrageous, not ""Gone With The Wind"".Also noteworthy was James Gandolfini's role. I'm not sure if this was his last role before his untimely passing, but if so, he went out on a high note. He's still likable and funny as he portrays his character, despite the fact that there is nothing whatsoever likable about the character himself- testimony to Gandolfini's extraordinary charisma.But man, Steve Carrell's wig... that thing is incredible!

I can think of precious few with the exception of the new Muppett Movie. So, it was with low expectations yet high hopes that I sat down to watch ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"". Ladies and gentlemen, laughter was achieved.Young Albert is a loser. He is beaten up and made to eat bark not sixty seconds after we meet him. His mother is never home and he has to bake is own tenth birthday cake. His only outlet is a Rance Holloway Magic Set. He soon meets Anthony, another outcast who, according to doctors is ""dangerously close to being a girl"". Through the years their friendship and love of magic grows until they become ""The Incredible Burt and Anton"" working their way up the magician's ranks around the world. Burt is soon contracted to Bally's Casino in Las Vegas and Burt agrees but only as long as Anton comes too. ""We are a team. Always have been always will be.""Cut to a decade later and the ""magic"" is gone. Burt and Anton have done the same exact show every night for ten years. Burt (Steve Carrell) has become a petulant prima donna who abuses his friend and only cares about getting the show over with so he can sleep with an audience member. Anton (Steve Buscemi) tries to go with the flow, but Burt keeps firing assistants. ""That's the second one this month!"" Anton complains.Enter Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) a street magician and Criss Angel clone with a cable T.V. show ""Brain Rapist"". He's new and exciting, never mind that he doesn't do any actual magic tricks. ""He just mumbles and cuts himself. My niece does that"", Burt scoffs. But that doesn't matter to casino owner Doug (James Gandolfini). ""You guys are doing the same [crap] as when I hired you."" He wants something new.From here the plot is pretty standard. The duo breaks up, a romantic interest is introduced, and Steve Gray taunts them at every turn. But here's the thing. It doesn't feel stale. Yes, the notes are all there, but they are played with a lighter touch. The dialogue is witty instead of mechanical and the sentimentality is far less forced. The actors play their roles with a gusto rarely seen in this age of cookie cutter comedies and the typical beats are measured out to a different timing than we are used to. Will Steve Gray get his comeuppance? Will Burt and Anton change, grow, forgive, and rejoin forces to get the ""big gig""? Will the two romantic leads get together in the end? We know the answers, but the way the movie gets us there is refreshing and humorous. The ending itself is slapstick of the highest order, changing the tone of the final triumph completely and in the best way possible.Hands down some of the best moments belong to Alan Arkin as Rance Holloway. Watching him in the previews for this movie I read his character one way, but in the movie he is a different animal altogether and they are both equally side splitting. Alan Arkin is a master of dry humor and with little to no perceivable effort he can change a line from self-deprecating to a barb at his co-star without changing a word.As a final word about the actors, this is the funniest I have seen some of these actors in a very long time. Carrey, Carrell, and Buscemi have returned to quality comedy with this offering and I hope they do not go back to the dim witted sentimental schlock we saw from them in other stages of their respective careers. I'm looking at you, ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"".""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is not perfect. It may push a couple of its jokes a trifle too far, but this movie was obviously made with an eye on quality and laughs rather than pumping out a quick product of dubious entertainment value. If I had to have a complaint it would be that some of the CG is pretty cheap, but honestly the material was so good I found myself forgiving the obvious effects. Modesty aside, I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over.

With Steve Carrell, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey and Alan Arkin in the line up, what can go wrong with this idea?Well quite a lot, as it turns out since they all get upstaged by James Gandolfini as the casino manager and Alan Arkin as the aging mentor, and the film lingers on the wrong scenes too long while missing the opportunities afforded by the premise. Carrey is funny as an extreme Kris Angel caricature though the implausibility of some of his masochistic routines starts to wear thin. Carrell's character is just plain unlikable and watching his non-stop berating of everyone around him goes on far too long for the audience to really connect with him by the time he has to change. Buscemi has great comic timing but is fundamentally underused.There are some laughs throughout but the jokes aren't nearly as good as you would expect with such a strong cast playing cheesy 1980s magicians in Vegas. The biggest flaw is that the plot is one of the most predictable I've seen in years - by the midpoint, I turned to my wife and predicted every major event through to the end. The forced love interest with Olivia Wilde is a weak afterthought and the finale is so absurd that even for a comedy it really doesn't work with the tone of the film.Overall, this is fine as a cheap rental (or hopefully a release on Prime) but really misfires.

I had no clue what this was about or when it came out.  I saw something on one of the late shows last night.  It had Jim Carrey talking and showing a scene.  The scene made me want to see the movie.  Oh how much of a mistake that was.  Ok, I guess I should tell you why.  Read on!This movie had so many things happening, it felt like I was spazzing out on sugar and every time I would come back into reality, it would be a different movie.  Here is what is happening in this movie.1. A boy with no friends and a busy mom gets something that gives him joy.2. While doing something from what he got for his birthday, he meets another boy.  They become friends.3. Time goes by and they become magicians.4. Over time they start fading away and having less of a crowd.5. The man looses his friend and tries to do his act alone.6. Man meets the man that made him what he is.7. Man starts to fall for a lady that works with him.8. Man is being out done by a freaking moron who does things to hurt himself.9. Man has to realize that things must change over time and everyone is important.Got it?  That is the movie.  Now, seems simple enough right?  Wrong.  I did laugh at parts of this movie.  As did some of the other people in the theater.  But I have the weirdest feeling that I was watching a drama.  I kind of sat there like a zombie.  Some of the things they do is just dumb.  Like when the friend leaves and the man is doing the two man show by himself.  You can see him climb the stairs on his hands and knees.  It was stupid.  ALL the things that Jim Carrey's character did, just made me feel uncomfortable.  He did things that were very intense and would kill someone if they tried it.  The last thing he did, was one of the stupidest things I have ever seen.  Nothing about it was funny.  The audience just sat there silent.  The things that the two men do to try and win a contest at the end, while it was funny, is taken to far when at the very end, you see them doing things to people in order for the trick to work.  That was a common thing with this movie.  They just went on for to long with a single thing  On and on and on.  So many little things happen that I found myself asking why?  This would have been a lot better if they had kept the character that Jim Carrey played out of the movie.  It just made it feel cheap and sleazy.  I think that character ruined the movie.  You get the feeling that you are watching some stupid teenage thing on youtube when his parts come on.  The thing I saw on the late show was not what I thought it was.  Once again, they took it to far.The title of this review, the movie felt SO long.  Yet, I feel like I learned nothing and honestly have no clue what happened.I have a feeling that if I would have been seeing this by myself, I would have laughed much more.  If I saw it at home, I would laugh and laugh.  Sometimes having an audience can effect your mood.  When everyone just sat there quiet, it killed the mood.  I will buy then on blu ray when it comes out and give it another try.  But as for seeing it in a theater and paying almost $9 a ticket, all I can say is go with the right person.  Someone with an almost Airplane type of humor.  Other wise you may end up feeling like I did.RethinkingI was eating dinner and thinking about this movie.  I think the problem was I did not know the type of comedy it was going to be.  It is very spoof.  The stuff Jim Carrey does is the way it has to be.  His character does shock stuff to get peoples attention.  One of the characters even says he is an idiot.  The stuff when Carells character is doing his act on his own is supposed to look dumb.  He is doing a two man act alone.  So after thinking about what I saw I have come to the conclusion that the movie was funny.  I will buy it when it comes out.As for what the first person who reviewed this, I would NEVER take a kid to see this movie.  Some of the things are very violent.  While adults can see the difference, I do not believe kids would.",3,"The 100 minute, 6 hour movie.",1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,4113,"['MAY', 'BE', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOW', 'try', 'keep', 'main', 'things', 'out.Ok', 'mom', 'were', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'saw', 'something', 'one', 'late', 'shows', 'last', 'night', 'had', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'talking', 'showing', 'scene', 'scene', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'Oh', 'how', 'much', 'mistake', 'was', 'Ok', 'guess', 'should', 'tell', 'why', 'Read', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'happening', 'felt', 'was', 'spazzing', 'out', 'sugar', 'time', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'reality', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'movie', 'Here', 'what', 'happening', 'movie.1', 'boy', 'friends', 'busy', 'mom', 'something', 'joy.2', 'doing', 'something', 'what', 'got', 'birthday', 'boy', 'become', 'friends.3', 'Time', 'become', 'magicians.4', 'time', 'start', 'fading', 'away', 'having', 'less', 'crowd.5', 'man', 'friend', 'tries', 'do', 'act', 'alone.6', 'Man', 'man', 'made', 'what', 'Man', 'fall', 'lady', 'him.8', 'Man', 'being', 'out', 'done', 'freaking', 'moron', 'who', 'things', 'hurt', 'himself.9', 'Man', 'realize', 'things', 'must', 'change', 'time', 'everyone', 'important.Got', 'movie', 'Now', 'simple', 'enough', 'right', 'Wrong', 'did', 'laugh', 'parts', 'movie', 'did', 'other', 'people', 'theater', 'have', 'weirdest', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'drama', 'kind', 'sat', 'zombie', 'things', 'do', 'just', 'dumb', 'when', 'friend', 'man', 'doing', 'two', 'man', 'show', 'can', 'see', 'climb', 'stairs', 'hands', 'knees', 'was', 'stupid', 'things', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'character', 'did', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'did', 'things', 'were', 'very', 'intense', 'would', 'kill', 'someone', 'tried', 'last', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'one', 'stupidest', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Nothing', 'was', 'funny', 'audience', 'just', 'sat', 'silent', 'things', 'two', 'men', 'do', 'try', 'win', 'contest', 'end', 'was', 'funny', 'taken', 'far', 'when', 'very', 'end', 'see', 'doing', 'things', 'people', 'order', 'trick', 'work', 'was', 'common', 'thing', 'movie', 'just', 'went', 'long', 'single', 'thing', 'So', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'happen', 'found', 'asking', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'kept', 'character', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'played', 'movie', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'cheap', 'sleazy', 'think', 'character', 'ruined', 'movie', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'watching', 'stupid', 'teenage', 'thing', 'youtube', 'when', 'parts', 'come', 'thing', 'saw', 'late', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'Once', 'again', 'took', 'far.The', 'title', 'review', 'movie', 'felt', 'SO', 'long', 'feel', 'learned', 'nothing', 'honestly', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seeing', 'would', 'have', 'laughed', 'much', 'more', 'saw', 'home', 'would', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'Sometimes', 'having', 'audience', 'can', 'effect', 'mood', 'When', 'everyone', 'just', 'sat', 'quiet', 'killed', 'mood', 'will', 'buy', 'then', 'blu', 'ray', 'when', 'out', 'give', 'try', 'seeing', 'theater', 'paying', 'almost', '9', 'ticket', 'can', 'say', 'go', 'right', 'person', 'Someone', 'almost', 'Airplane', 'type', 'humor', 'Other', 'wise', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'did.RethinkingI', 'was', 'eating', 'dinner', 'thinking', 'movie', 'think', 'problem', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'type', 'comedy', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'spoof', 'stuff', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'way', 'be', 'character', 'shock', 'stuff', 'get', 'peoples', 'attention', 'One', 'characters', 'even', 'idiot', 'stuff', 'when', 'Carells', 'character', 'doing', 'act', 'own', 'supposed', 'look', 'dumb', 'doing', 'two', 'man', 'act', 'alone', 'So', 'thinking', 'what', 'saw', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'will', 'buy', 'when', 'out.As', 'what', 'first', 'person', 'who', 'reviewed', 'would', 'NEVER', 'take', 'kid', 'see', 'movie', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'violent', 'adults', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'kids', 'would']",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone

Then there are movies where the actors read the script, ask their agents ""how much are they willing to pay me again?"" and go for it, mailing everything in.  The latter scenario describes ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,"" which considering its fairly high caliber of acting power boils down to nothing more than an extremely predictable riches-to-rags-to-redemption story.Two nerdy eighties kids obsessed by a mail order magician's kit grow up to be Burt Wonderstone (a glammed-up Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (a less glammed-up Steve Buscemi), the magician superstars of the Vegas strip.  However, offstage they hate each other and their popularity among the flyover crowds who adore them is being threatened by Steve Gray (Jim Carrey, who fifteen years ago would have starred in this), a ""street magician"" in the mold of Criss Angel and David Blaine, whose idea of magic is pulling a playing card out of a self-inflicted facial wound and holding his urine for weeks.  After an attempt at edgy magic goes awry, Burt and Anton go their separate ways, Anton distributing magic kits to third world children and Burt reduced to entertaining at a nursing home for former Vegas performers.  Lo and behold, the magician who inspired him as a child (Alan Arkin) lives at the home and ... I'm sure you can guess the rest.""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" isn't horrible, it's just REALLY predictable.  I felt bad for Olivia Wilde, who's the only one that turns in a credible performance--she's also the only one who delivered a line that made me laugh.  However, her character also becomes reduced to cliche.  I'm no comedy snob, considering my all-time favorite movie is ""Amimal House,"" but ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is just another in a very long line of multiplex filler between the summer blockbuster season and the serious award season.

1648407,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00CJ5BG8Y,Paul Allaer,"[6, 9]","""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Burt Wonderstone (played by Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (played by Steve Buscemi), friends since childhood and now a headling magic act at the Bally's in Las Vegas. Think of Burt and Anton as Siegfried and Roy without the tigers. But their popularity starts to wane when a street magician named Steve Gray (played by Jim Carrey)--think along the lines of David Blaine--comes onto the scene. After a badly failed attempt to regain the momentum, Anton quits and Burt now must try to survive without his magic act partner. To tell you much more of the plot would be pointless. If you've seen the trailer of the movie, you know pretty much exactly how it's all going to play out.Several comments: the plot of the movie is utterly predictable but that is not the point of this movie. Indeed the heart and soul of the movie lies in the staging of the various magic tricks and acts. As we get deeper and deeper into the movie, Steve Gray goes more and more extreme, which in turn prompts Burt and Co. to try and match. The last part of the movie is an outright ""magic-off"" between Steve and Burt (with assorted friends). The secondary, and more wistful, point of the movie is the life-long friendship between Burt and Anton. The opening scenes of the movie show us how they become friends as boys in the 1980s and these scenes are just wonderful and nostalgic (in the best sense).One of the reason the movie works so well is that we are treated to an all-star cast which simply delivers. Let's start with Steve Carell. Let me note upfront that I will go see just about anything with him in it (and last year's ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" might have been his best performance ever). As it happens, Carell plays a character who is very unlikeable for most of the movie, and pulls it off! Steve Buscemi does great as the ""sidekick"". Jim Carrey steals a number of scenes with his over-the-top character of the Davie Blaine-alike Steve Gray. But wait! there is more! Olivia Wilde as the ""magician's assistant"" just oozes charm and is utterly delightful. Alan Arkin as the statesman elder magician brings yet another short but impactful role, like so many recently (Argo, anyone?). Last but not least, James Gandolfini as the casino owner finally gets to play a non-mafia/mob role and is great. Bottom line is that I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. No, this is not art with a capital A, but it is mindless entertainment that delivers what it promised: a movie about, with featuring plenty of great, magic acts and tricks. And the all-star cast certainly didn't hurt!",4,"Thoroughly enjoyable ""magic-off"" with an all-star cast",1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2663,"['Incredible', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', '2013', 'release', '100', 'min', 'story', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Anton', 'Marvelton', 'played', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'childhood', 'now', 'headling', 'magic', 'act', 'Bally', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Think', 'Burt', 'Anton', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'tigers', 'popularity', 'wane', 'when', 'street', 'magician', 'named', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'think', 'lines', 'David', 'Blaine', 'scene', 'badly', 'failed', 'attempt', 'regain', 'momentum', 'Anton', 'Burt', 'now', 'must', 'try', 'survive', 'magic', 'act', 'partner', 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'how', 'going', 'play', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'plot', 'movie', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'not', 'point', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'staging', 'various', 'magic', 'tricks', 'acts', 'get', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'more', 'more', 'extreme', 'turn', 'prompts', 'Burt', 'Co.', 'try', 'match', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'outright', 'magic-off', 'Steve', 'Burt', 'assorted', 'friends', 'secondary', 'more', 'wistful', 'point', 'movie', 'life-long', 'friendship', 'Burt', 'Anton', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'become', 'friends', 'boys', '1980s', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'wonderful', 'nostalgic', 'best', 'sense', '.One', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'treated', 'all-star', 'cast', 'simply', 'delivers', 'Let', 'start', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Let', 'note', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'just', 'anything', 'last', 'year', 'Seeking', 'Friend', 'End', 'World', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'Carell', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'most', 'movie', 'off', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'great', 'sidekick', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'number', 'scenes', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'Davie', 'Blaine-alike', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'wait', 'more', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'magician', 'assistant', 'just', 'charm', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'statesman', 'elder', 'magician', 'yet', 'short', 'impactful', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'recently', 'Argo', 'anyone', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'casino', 'owner', 'finally', 'play', 'non-mafia/mob', 'role', 'great', 'Bottom', 'line', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'No', 'not', 'art', 'capital', 'A', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'what', 'promised', 'movie', 'featuring', 'plenty', 'great', 'magic', 'acts', 'tricks', 'all-star', 'cast', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt']",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone

Of course one automatically thinks of former Vegas kings Siegfried & Roy and the current Criss Angel.But what held such high promise in the posters and trailers for a crazy, over-the-top illusionist smack-down switches gears before midpoint and becomes a treacley sweet redemption story that tracks Steve Carrell's Wonderstone through his humiliating fall from favor to the restoration of his cold heart and dead soul.  Jim Carrey is the only one who seems to get the proper tone of the film with his insane portrayal of a masochistic trickster whose gimmick is that he has none.  He really does burn and cut himself for the sake of the ""illusion.""  Olivia Wilde is a comely assistant who has little to do and Alan Akin steals the few scenes he's in as a curmudgeonly TV magician in a retirement home.  The outrageous stunt that precedes the final credits is what should have happened at midpoint.  Then we'd have something to talk about and a trigger that would escalate the story to a climax deserving of the great premise of crazed, battling Vegas magicians.I was very disappointed at the relatively few ""tricks"" that were performed.  Whether practical or CGI, we want to be dazzled and amazed by cinematic magic when we fork over our hard-earned cold cash to be taken away in a story that promises big laughs and wonderment.

But I have to this....Carell, Wilde, Buscemi, Arkin, and Carrey...how did the writers screw up a film with stellar cast?????First, Carrey is the brightest spot in this flick as a shock street performer, and does a great job as a supporting actor. He actually plays his moronic self (drilling into his skull), and he works as a street idiot magician that is a blatant slam to Criss Angel. From there, I cannot believe the rest of this A-List cast signed for this Formula Hollywood fiasco. I like Carell movies (brilliant in Seeking a Friend for The End of The World), I think Buscemi is one of the most underrated actors of our age (but he looks like this role is phoned in), and who doesn't love Arkin? BTW, somebody had to have something on Wilde to get her to do this film.With THIS kind of talent, the story of a jaded self centered fallen magician could have been hilarious. Instead, it was simply a formula film that you KNEW the soggy script in the first five minutes. I kept waiting for this to take the road to insanity funny, but it kept sinking into a new version of a lame kids show.Here are the highlights...Arkin is really funny in his role as a retired magician in an old folks home, especially in his `I had a stroke' bit, and then the last 3 minutes. That's it. I have a feeling the original script may have been more bizarre, and Hollywood made it cream toast.Oh, the OTHER best performance in this film is Jay Mohr's spot shots as the magician Rick the Implausible. He NAILS the role with his spoof on Vegas lounge performers with his comb-over and inability to tell a single joke properly. And I mean he nails it. If they had shown him blowing it on stage, instead of just the bar spots, this would have been funnier.I gave this 2 stars simply for Carrey, Mohr, and Arkin. I won't give you a synopsis of the movie, because I am sure you can guess it it from the other comments.I would recommend you have many many drinkies before watching the dvd. Might make it funnier.

Steve Carell stars as the titular ""incredible"" and plays Wonderstone in all of his one-dimensional caricature and lacking any irony.  He's not unlikable even though he's completely out of touch and self-absorbed to the detriment of having any real personal relationship; if the movie would have taken the risk of making him unlikable it would have lost its lighter touches and felt less a comedy but certainly more personal and connectable.  Wonderstone doesn't work alone; he's a tag-team comedian a la Penn & Teller or other duo acts (mostly reminiscent of Sigfried and Roy though; though sequins were mesmerizing!).  His wizardly companion is Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi--probably giving the best perferomance here out of the whole cast--and sheepishly taking cheap shots around his snaggle-toothed bug-eyed looks), a buddy from childhood who got picked on and teased just like the young Burt did.  Marvelton is also Burt's brains and when the partnership finally breaks Wonderstone's posh and insulated carreer magically disappears (see what I did there? yeah, most of the jokes in the film are pretty weak too).The remaining story is the return to infamy of Burt Wonderstone and his overcoming the David Blaine/ Criss Angel/ Marquis de Sade inspired freakworks of on-the-rise performer (""magician"" doesn't really apply) Steve Gray (an outlandish character played for some reason with too much restraint by rubber-faced Jim Carrey).  Olivia Wilde, doing some decent acting in some of the later scenes, plays Nicole...I mean Jane...Burt's love interest (love her eyes!) and the talented always underrated Alan Arkin shows up as the magician who inspired them all.The ending of the film, with the protagonists pulling off their greatest magical feat (making the audience disappear...insert your own joke here), took me out of the movie as they showed us beforehand how they were doing it and, while it ends on a note that made me chuckle, this problem of allowing us to see the magic de-fanged takes away some of what could have been ZING at points in the movie, and that's too bad.In summing up this movie I will say that there seemed to have been many missed opportunities...especially within the area of wowwing the audience with what appeared to be actual magic.

1648460,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00CJ5BG8Y,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[7, 9]","Magicians and illusionists have been entertaining people for a very long time and the magicians life can make for some fascinating film (e.g. THE PRESTIGE) and television (e.g. ""The Amazing Falsworth"" and ""Mr. Magic"" episodes of AMAZING STORIES). However, there aren't very many comedies made about magicians. In fact, the only thing that comes to mind is Gob Bluth on ARRESTED DEVLEOPMENT. Therefore, when I first heard about Steve Carell's movie, THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE, I was intrigued by the concept and eager to see how the film would be.Carell plays title character, Burt Wonderstone, the front man of a magician act in Las Vegas that he stars in with his best friend, Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi). Burt and Anton have been best friends since they were kids and have been doing the same act to sold out crowds for a decade. However, when a new street ""magician"" named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) appears on the scene, Wonderstone and Marvelton's audiences start to dwindle. After a botched attempt at a street spectacle of their own, the duo break up and go their separate ways and Wonderstone has to do a lot of soul searching and rediscovery before he's ready to attempt a triumph return to the limelight.I really enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE. It's not a great movie, but it is a good movie that has a lot of heart. It's a redemption story full of zany, comical moments. The film made me laugh out loud several times. Initially, the movie garnered a lot of negative reviews after its theatrical release. I'm not sure why except that ever since THE OFFICE, critics seem to expect too much from Steve Carell. He's a great actor and a very funny man, but every production he's in isn't going to be another THE OFFICE and every character he plays can't be Michael Scott. The critics need to lighten up a little and enjoy Carell's character and the movie for what they are and not for what they are not.Besides Carell, Buscemi turns in a nice performance. Buscemi is actually a great actor that has made a solid career, despite having less than stellar looks. Still, as an actor he doesn't always get the credit or roles he deserves. Although he takes second billing to Carell, it's nice to see him playing a role with larger recognition. Jim Carrey does a good job as the antagonist of the movie. Carrey doesn't make many movies anymore, so it's nice to see him when he does pop up. Alan Arkin seems to be everywhere recently and does a nice job in the supporting role of Wonderstone's inspiration. Olivia Wilde is beautiful as always, but her character is one that's actually completely unnecessary for the story.Overall, THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE is an entertaining and humorous world at the look of a magician's life. It's not the type of comedy than many might expect from Steve Carell. Instead, it's more of a classical comedy with a touch of zany edginess and a whole lot of heart. It's might not be a great movie (or one of Carell's best movies), but it is a good movie, nonetheless.",4,A Tin Man Finds His Heart,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,3019,"['Magicians', 'illusionists', 'have', 'been', 'entertaining', 'people', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'magicians', 'life', 'can', 'make', 'fascinating', 'film', 'e.g', 'THE', 'PRESTIGE', 'television', 'e.g', 'Amazing', 'Falsworth', 'Mr.', 'Magic', 'episodes', 'AMAZING', 'STORIES', 'However', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'comedies', 'made', 'magicians', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'mind', 'Gob', 'Bluth', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVLEOPMENT', 'Therefore', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'movie', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'BURT', 'WONDERSTONE', 'was', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'be.Carell', 'plays', 'title', 'character', 'Burt', 'Wonderstone', 'front', 'man', 'magician', 'act', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'best', 'friend', 'Anton', 'Marvelton', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Burt', 'Anton', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'were', 'kids', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'same', 'act', 'sold', 'out', 'crowds', 'decade', 'However', 'when', 'new', 'street', 'magician', 'named', 'Steve', 'Gray', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'scene', 'Wonderstone', 'Marvelton', 'audiences', 'start', 'dwindle', 'botched', 'attempt', 'street', 'spectacle', 'own', 'duo', 'break', 'up', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Wonderstone', 'do', 'lot', 'soul', 'searching', 'rediscovery', 'ready', 'attempt', 'triumph', 'return', 'limelight.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'BURT', 'WONDERSTONE', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'redemption', 'story', 'full', 'zany', 'comical', 'moments', 'film', 'made', 'loud', 'several', 'times', 'Initially', 'movie', 'garnered', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'ever', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'critics', 'seem', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'great', 'actor', 'very', 'funny', 'man', 'production', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'critics', 'need', 'lighten', 'up', 'little', 'enjoy', 'Carell', 'character', 'movie', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'not.Besides', 'Carell', 'Buscemi', 'nice', 'performance', 'Buscemi', 'actually', 'great', 'actor', 'made', 'solid', 'career', 'having', 'less', 'stellar', 'looks', 'Still', 'actor', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'credit', 'roles', 'second', 'billing', 'Carell', 'nice', 'see', 'playing', 'role', 'larger', 'recognition', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'good', 'job', 'antagonist', 'movie', 'Carrey', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'movies', 'anymore', 'nice', 'see', 'when', 'pop', 'up', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'be', 'everywhere', 'recently', 'nice', 'job', 'supporting', 'role', 'Wonderstone', 'inspiration', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'beautiful', 'always', 'character', 'one', 'actually', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'story.Overall', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'BURT', 'WONDERSTONE', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'world', 'look', 'magician', 'life', 'not', 'type', 'comedy', 'many', 'might', 'expect', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Instead', 'more', 'classical', 'comedy', 'touch', 'zany', 'edginess', 'whole', 'lot', 'heart', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'Carell', 'best', 'movies', 'good', 'movie', 'nonetheless']",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone

1648467,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[3, 6]","I should say up front that I was really prepared to like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.  The cast line-up - Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey, Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and James Gandolfini - was top-notch.  The premise - a comedy about stage magicians who've worked so long together that they can barely stand each other being faced with a new and upcoming rival - held a lot of potential.  But the actual film turned out to be quite a disappointment.  It does have its moments where a breath of life seems to stir, but on the whole there are so many problems with it that it's hard to even know where to begin.  It's not a _bad_ film, exactly. It's watchable, even if you can count the number of unpredictable moments in the film on one hand without using all your fingers. But given the talent involved, it could've been so much more.The story begins with two boys - Albert and Anthony (engagingly played by Mason Cook and Luke Vanek) - who meet up as kids and bond over a fascination with stage magic. Fast forward over the years showing them becoming Burt (Carell) and Anton (Buscemi), partners as professional stage magicians to the current day, where they've been headlining at a major Las Vegas casino run by Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) for the last ten years. Part of their shtick is their alleged ""magical friendship"" that they share, but the reality is that their act has gotten really stale and the two of them can barely stand each other. Not hard to understand really, particularly since while Anton has remained a pretty nice guy, Burt has evolved into an obnoxious egomaniac - with an obsession about having ""the biggest bed in Las Vegas"" - who treats everyone around him like crap. Including their much put-upon stage assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) whom he keeps calling ""Nicole"" because he goes through so many assistants he can't be bothered to remember any new names.But the trouble between Burt and Anton - and with their stale act - is suddenly exacerbated by the appearance of the new magician on the block, Steve Gray (a jaw-droppingly over-the-top Jim Carrey), who is starting to steal the limelight with his wince-and-flinch-inducing shock-and-awe form of street magic. So much so that Doug is thinking of replacing Burt and Anton with Gray when he opens the new casino he's having built.  Will Burt and Anton be able to resolve their differences and meet this threat?  Of course.  Is there ever even the slightest doubt that this will happen?  No, because you've seen this clich&eacute;d formula a hundred times already.  Will you even care?  Maybe, but only after Alan Arkin finally appears to inject some actual feeling into the story.A big part of the problem with The Incredible Burt Wonderstone seems to stem from the fact that the screenplay and story got worked and reworked so much (seven different writers in total, over a span of five years) that the result was something so formulaic that it wouldn't surprise a seven-year-old. And another part of the problem was that the original director quit after only two months, to be replaced by Jim Scardino, who although he had a lengthy record of directing TV shows had never directed a feature film before.  And who apparently has no sense of real comedy whatsoever. It's often been said that in comedy, timing is everything, and here the timing always seems to be off.  You know from what's happening that you're supposed to laugh, but the feeling just isn't there.  In addition, the film keeps throwing up lame jokes and then keeps _repeating_ them, as if in the desperate hope that maybe the third or fourth time you get hit with them you might laugh.Another problem with the film is that you never buy into the premise that Burt and Anton are headliners at a major Las Vegas casino for the last ten years.  Their act is so cheesy that they couldn't be headliners in Hoboken for ten days. In magic, to make it work, you've got to get the audience to believe, and the same applies in film.But the biggest part of the problem is that Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi are badly miscast here. The film could've worked if they'd cast Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as Burt and Anton. Think Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy, or especially Talladega Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobby, and it's immediately obvious how much more they could've done with this film. Ferrell has the ego-driven git down so seamlessly that he could patent the role, just as Reilly does the loyal and much put-upon sidekick role. But when Carell does Anton, you're always awkwardly aware that he's _acting_ to play Anton; it never comes across as natural. The problem is even worse for Buscemi because the script never allows him to do what he's really good at: making dryly acerbic observations on the things the other characters say and do. Just as with Carell's Burt, you never buy into Buscemi's Anton. Superbly talented as both men are, they were simply wrong for these roles.An additional problem is that most of the other actors - particularly Olivia Wilde and James Gandolfini - are largely wasted here.  The only two actors who seem to breath any life into the film are Alan Arkin as the veteran old-school stage magician Rance Holloway and Jim Carrey's that's-gotta-hurt magician/performance-artist/masochistic-maniac Steve Gray. Arkin, even at seventy-nine still one of the best actors in the business, once again delivers a convincing - and scene-stealing - performance as Holloway. The best scenes in the film are when Carell's down-and-out Burt meets up with Arkin's Holloway in the retirement home where the desperate-for-any-work Burt has taken a job and where Holloway, the magician who inspired him as a boy to learn stage magic, now lives. Carell drops the whole jerk-version of Burt and becomes much more likeable. And more importantly, believable. After the tedium that makes up the first half of the movie, the retirement home scenes where Holloway rekindles Burt's sense of wonder and joy of performing are a welcome breath of fresh air and one of the only times where I found myself actually enjoying the movie.Barely recommended, mainly for the scenes with Alan Arkin's old-school magic and for Jim Carrey's over the top flinch-and-wince inducing ones.",2,Incredibly disappointing - Carell & Buscemi badly miscast in mechanically-directed formula,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,6245,"['should', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'was', 'really',
