1498604,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005S9EJ14,,"[0, 1]","So last night I watched The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was kind of stupid and anticlimactic in a pretty large way (it just went nowhere) but it was fun and flew by despite the two hour running length (movies like this could easily edit to 90 minutes, but I honestly didn't feel it drag).The film centers on a group of senior citizens at a crucial turning point in their lives and they all pick up and move to India.  They don't know one another but all wind up living in the same hotel, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  You have a woman who lost her savings after her husband died.  You have a gay man in pursuit of his long lost lover.  You have a couple financially strapped due to a wayward daughter.  You have a grandmother fed up with being used by her daughter.  You have an elderly man trying desperately to regain his youth through some tantric sex and you have an old racist in need of a new hip.  Together they make an eclectic bunch.  Upon their arrival to India all is not as they expected, especially the hotel, which is nearly in ruins.  The hotel manager, the young and exuberant Sonny, is in way over his head, but he is determined to make this work.  Some of the group immediately start to embrace their newfound surroundings, while others are dead set on hating it.Over the course of the next two hours, this group seeks for something (nothing we can really put our finger on) and then finds something else (again, I'm not sure what) and the end comes, which works out all right (because obviously when things were going bad they weren't at the end yet).My issues with The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel stem from lackluster writing.  Dench's voiceover is supposed to shed light on the group's progressive nature and yet it just feels empty and void of any real substance.  Like I said, there doesn't seem to be any resolve and even when the film draws to a close and they're talking about not finding what you were looking for but finding something better I was scratching my head wondering just what it was that they actually found.I mean, India was pretty.Still, this is a very easy film to watch and the entire cast shines in their respecative ways.  Dench turns out a true `Meryl Streep in a role Meryl Streep isn't trying to get Oscar nominated for' performance, you know, the roles that usually land Meryl a filler Oscar nomination anyways.  She's great here and I actually think it may be one of her finest performances ever since she lightens up and has some fun.  She's always so serious.  I'm glad that Nighy did not play Graham, the gay man, because it would have been far too obvious.  Thankfully, Tom Wilkinson gets it all sorts of right (more on that in a minute).I am stumped on something though.  Why is Maggie Smith getting singled out here?  Sure, she's funny, but like she's played this character in nearly every other movie she's been in.  Ha, I know that this is an argument that meets serious opposition by her devoted fans, and I am one of her fans so don't take that wrong, but Smith has fallen back on stuffy old English woman for quite some time now.  In her prime she was all sorts of marvelous (`California Suite' is one of the greatest showcases for her talent) but I'm talking about the past decade.  Still, she's been singled out and even received a SAG nomination and is considered in the running for an Oscar nomination for this.  Seriously?  I'm struggling to understand what it is that she does that is so special.  She plays a racist who has a change of heart and learns to walk again.  Problem is, it's a rather underwritten part and she doesn't have much to chew on other than a scene or two where she spouts a funny line.  Instead, I really wish that Tom Wilkinson were getting the awards attention.  The way he molds Graham with limited screen time and yet such backstory is sensational.  His confession scene with Dench is beautiful, and that hug is heartbreaking, and even though his lighthearted revelation comes off a bit underdeveloped (like, I'm not even sure he knows what he's getting at) he delivers it with such warmth and adds a beautiful layer to his character.I don't think I'd nominate him myself, since so far this year has been a bounty of supporting performances, but it is truly best in show and deserves to be noted as such.So, at the end of the day I have to say that I was pleased with the overall experience.  It is light and fun and has some emotional heft, but it lacks development and winds up being very forgettable because it essentially says absolutely nothing.",3,A fun forgettable journey...,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,4596,"['So', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'kind', 'stupid', 'anticlimactic', 'pretty', 'large', 'way', 'just', 'went', 'nowhere', 'was', 'fun', 'flew', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'length', 'movies', 'could', 'easily', 'edit', '90', 'minutes', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', '.The', 'film', 'centers', 'group', 'senior', 'citizens', 'crucial', 'turning', 'point', 'lives', 'pick', 'up', 'move', 'India', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'wind', 'up', 'living', 'same', 'hotel', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'have', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'savings', 'husband', 'died', 'have', 'gay', 'man', 'pursuit', 'long', 'lost', 'lover', 'have', 'couple', 'financially', 'strapped', 'due', 'wayward', 'daughter', 'have', 'grandmother', 'fed', 'up', 'being', 'used', 'daughter', 'have', 'elderly', 'man', 'trying', 'desperately', 'regain', 'youth', 'tantric', 'sex', 'have', 'old', 'racist', 'need', 'new', 'hip', 'Together', 'make', 'eclectic', 'bunch', 'arrival', 'India', 'not', 'expected', 'especially', 'hotel', 'nearly', 'ruins', 'hotel', 'manager', 'young', 'exuberant', 'Sonny', 'way', 'head', 'determined', 'make', 'work', 'group', 'immediately', 'embrace', 'newfound', 'surroundings', 'others', 'are', 'dead', 'set', 'hating', 'it.Over', 'course', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'group', 'something', 'nothing', 'can', 'really', 'put', 'finger', 'then', 'something', 'else', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'end', 'out', 'right', 'obviously', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'end', 'yet', 'issues', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'stem', 'lackluster', 'writing', 'Dench', 'voiceover', 'supposed', 'shed', 'light', 'group', 'progressive', 'nature', 'yet', 'just', 'empty', 'void', 'real', 'substance', 'said', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'resolve', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'close', ""'re"", 'talking', 'not', 'finding', 'what', 'were', 'looking', 'finding', 'something', 'better', 'was', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'found.I', 'mean', 'India', 'was', 'pretty.Still', 'very', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'entire', 'cast', 'shines', 'respecative', 'ways', 'Dench', 'out', 'true', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'role', 'Meryl', 'Streep', ""n't"", 'trying', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'know', 'roles', 'usually', 'land', 'Meryl', 'filler', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'anyways', 'great', 'here', 'actually', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'ever', 'up', 'fun', 'always', 'so', 'serious', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Nighy', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'Graham', 'gay', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'obvious', 'Thankfully', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'sorts', 'right', 'more', 'minute', 'am', 'stumped', 'something', 'Why', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'getting', 'singled', 'out', 'here', 'Sure', 'funny', 'played', 'character', 'nearly', 'other', 'movie', 'been', 'Ha', 'know', 'argument', 'serious', 'opposition', 'devoted', 'fans', 'am', 'one', 'fans', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wrong', 'Smith', 'fallen', 'back', 'stuffy', 'old', 'English', 'woman', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'prime', 'was', 'sorts', 'marvelous', 'California', 'Suite', 'one', 'greatest', 'showcases', 'talent', ""'m"", 'talking', 'past', 'decade', 'Still', 'been', 'singled', 'out', 'even', 'received', 'SAG', 'nomination', 'considered', 'running', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Seriously', ""'m"", 'struggling', 'understand', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'racist', 'who', 'change', 'heart', 'walk', 'again', 'Problem', 'rather', 'underwritten', 'part', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chew', 'other', 'scene', 'two', 'where', 'funny', 'line', 'Instead', 'really', 'wish', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'were', 'getting', 'awards', 'attention', 'way', 'Graham', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'yet', 'such', 'backstory', 'sensational', 'confession', 'scene', 'Dench', 'beautiful', 'hug', 'heartbreaking', 'even', 'lighthearted', 'revelation', 'off', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'getting', 'such', 'warmth', 'beautiful', 'layer', 'character.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'nominate', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'been', 'bounty', 'supporting', 'performances', 'truly', 'best', 'show', 'be', 'noted', 'such.So', 'end', 'day', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pleased', 'overall', 'experience', 'light', 'fun', 'emotional', 'heft', 'development', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'forgettable', 'essentially', 'absolutely', 'nothing']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

1498606,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B005S9EJ14,,"[0, 1]","With Judy Dench and Maggie Smith in a film about English people who come to stay  at a hotel in an exotic landscape, one is tempted to make comparisons with ""A Room With A View"";  you could, but that'd be like trying to link ""Doc Martin"" to ""Northern Exposure"", sure there are comparisons to be had, yet at the end it's an exercise in wishful thinking.  But don't think that this film doesn't measure up.With each having his own reasons, a group of aging Brits find themselves staying at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, in Jaipur;  an old Raj Era hotel that may have started business as a palace, run by an earnest young man who's trying to succeed where his father's life dream failed:  Bring the hotel back to its glory, and make money, albeit as a home for seniors, in effect out-sourcing the West's old folk who can't afford to live with dignity in their own country.  The young man is Dev Patel, who at times seems the embodiment of a Disney animated character.  His persona is that of a sweet faced, earnest young man, but that facade breaks (frequently) and his eyes widen, he smiles broadly and reveals a goofier interior.  It reminds me of Shaggy, in his earlier work (""Carolina"") where the tough-cool reggae image would also crack, he'd throw his head back, roll his eyes and grin broadly;  it's an endearing trait in both.The basic idea of the film is that a bunch of Westerners come to India to live out their lives, and die, and in the process discover an entirely new life they'd never imagined.  And for the most part that is the film, but there's a downside, sort of like the politician behind the ads:  Like entirely too many Western films, there is a not so subtle racism that permeates the film.  The Indians, in their own country, are clearly made out to be the lesser beings;  how they managed to build a civilization, let alone one of the world's booming modern economies; how Indian men stood up to their mothers, on behalf of their girl friends, or ran their businesses without the help of a kindly white person is anybody's guess.  You see it all the time on this side of the pond, with minorities in film and TV:  ""Northern Exposure"" and it's sub-caste natives;  African Americans get it all the time, playing the sage, the pimp, the maid---kindly and knowing; the fool, but almost never the equal.  In the end it makes us white folks look bad.Having said that, if I walked out of every film that irritated me in one way or another, I'd have given up on films altogether by now.  I think the issue needs to be dealt with, and it would help if more people tagged the behavior when it's manifested.The movie is very entertaining, romantic, and funny by turns;  the story unfolding mostly within the hotel, but there are wonderful street scenes that provide interest and color, and in some instances, glimpses of modern India, where a big new concrete tower rises amidst fields of trash and dirt;  with the tents of the workers making a temporary slum alongside (if we remember our ""Shantaram"").  It probably would have been better if the perspective had been reversed, with the white folks as incidentals and the Indians carrying more of the story, an Indian film in other words;  but for what it is, it is very watchable and would bear multiple viewings.I should note that I watched the streaming version and the quality was quite good.",3,"Very Entertaining, Romantic, Warmly Funny Film",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,3361,"['Judy', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'film', 'English', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'stay', 'hotel', 'exotic', 'landscape', 'one', 'tempted', 'make', 'comparisons', 'A', 'Room', 'A', 'View', 'could', ""'d"", 'be', 'trying', 'link', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'sure', 'are', 'comparisons', 'be', 'had', 'yet', 'end', 'exercise', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up.With', 'having', 'own', 'reasons', 'group', 'aging', 'Brits', 'find', 'staying', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'Jaipur', 'old', 'Raj', 'Era', 'hotel', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'business', 'palace', 'run', 'earnest', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'succeed', 'where', 'father', 'life', 'dream', 'failed', 'Bring', 'hotel', 'back', 'glory', 'make', 'money', 'albeit', 'home', 'seniors', 'effect', 'out-sourcing', 'West', 'old', 'folk', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'live', 'dignity', 'own', 'country', 'young', 'man', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'who', 'times', 'embodiment', 'Disney', 'animated', 'character', 'persona', 'sweet', 'faced', 'earnest', 'young', 'man', 'facade', 'breaks', 'frequently', 'eyes', 'widen', 'broadly', 'goofier', 'interior', 'Shaggy', 'earlier', 'work', 'Carolina', 'where', 'tough-cool', 'reggae', 'image', 'would', 'also', 'crack', ""'d"", 'throw', 'head', 'back', 'roll', 'eyes', 'grin', 'broadly', 'endearing', 'trait', 'both.The', 'basic', 'idea', 'film', 'bunch', 'Westerners', 'come', 'India', 'live', 'out', 'lives', 'die', 'process', 'entirely', 'new', 'life', ""'d"", 'never', 'imagined', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'downside', 'sort', 'politician', 'ads', 'entirely', 'too', 'many', 'Western', 'films', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'racism', 'film', 'Indians', 'own', 'country', 'are', 'clearly', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'lesser', 'beings', 'how', 'managed', 'build', 'civilization', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'world', 'booming', 'modern', 'economies', 'how', 'Indian', 'men', 'stood', 'up', 'mothers', 'behalf', 'girl', 'friends', 'ran', 'businesses', 'help', 'kindly', 'white', 'person', 'anybody', 'guess', 'see', 'time', 'side', 'pond', 'minorities', 'film', 'TV', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'sub-caste', 'natives', 'African', 'Americans', 'get', 'time', 'playing', 'sage', 'pimp', 'maid', '-kindly', 'knowing', 'fool', 'almost', 'never', 'equal', 'end', 'white', 'folks', 'look', 'bad.Having', 'said', 'walked', 'film', 'irritated', 'one', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'up', 'films', 'altogether', 'now', 'think', 'issue', 'be', 'dealt', 'would', 'help', 'more', 'people', 'tagged', 'behavior', 'when', 'manifested.The', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'romantic', 'funny', 'turns', 'story', 'unfolding', 'mostly', 'hotel', 'are', 'wonderful', 'street', 'scenes', 'provide', 'interest', 'color', 'instances', 'glimpses', 'modern', 'India', 'where', 'big', 'new', 'concrete', 'tower', 'amidst', 'fields', 'trash', 'dirt', 'tents', 'workers', 'making', 'temporary', 'slum', 'alongside', 'remember', 'Shantaram', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'perspective', 'had', 'been', 'reversed', 'white', 'folks', 'incidentals', 'Indians', 'carrying', 'more', 'story', 'Indian', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'very', 'watchable', 'would', 'bear', 'multiple', 'viewings.I', 'should', 'note', 'watched', 'streaming', 'version', 'quality', 'was', 'quite', 'good']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
1498607,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005S9EJ14,,"[12, 34]","The easiest way to describe this film is by saying it's about a group of British old people making a fool of themselves in India. That's essentially the film in one sentence, but also doesn't really seem fair in the long run.Seven retirees from Britain all decide to travel to India for different reasons. Muriel (Maggie Smith) is having hip surgery, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton)'s daughter invested their life savings into a get rich quick scheme that still hasn't paid off, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is looking for a change in scenery after her husband has passed, Graham (Tom Wilkinson) grew up in India and is looking forward to returning there, Madge (Celia Imrie) is looking for a rich suitor who can make her feel like a desirable woman again, and Norman (Ronald Pickup) is just lonely and looking for that particular someone to make the last few years of his life worth living. With the low cost and exotic scenery of India enticing them, they all decide to stay at the newly restored Marigold Hotel. Unfortunately things aren't as advertised and the hotel is still undergoing massive renovations when they arrive. While the trip they wind up taking doesn't end up being the one they planned, it evolves into something they never could have counted on and are forever affected by their stay there.The most unique thing about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that everyone has different personalities. Everybody seems to be so different from one another on the surface, but are much more alike underneath than they could have ever imagined. Muriel is the most surprising, especially if you've only seen Maggie Smith in the Harry Potter franchise. Her ignorant racist comments result in some of the most memorable scenes in the film. Douglas felt like the character I related to the most (I'm sure it'll probably be different for everyone). His tendency to stay quiet the majority of the time, but then blow everyone away with his sarcastic wit reminded me quite a bit of myself. Graham seemed very private at first, but the film immediately becomes more sentimental once he reveals why he actually came back to India. Evelyn's journey is the most emotional. You also spend the most time with her, but seeing her life transform from the beginning of the film to its conclusion is pretty spectacular.The only character I couldn't stand was Jean. She was so hypocritical and close-minded. Then to top it off, she threw several hissy fits because she didn't get her way and because ""India is hot."" Those types of people get on my last nerve and I couldn't wait to see the last of her. Sonny's (Dev Patel) blind optimism is a little irritating especially since everything is going so terribly for him, but his enthusiasm causes him to be the comedic relief in nearly every scene he's in.When asked what I thought after the movie ended, my big joke was, ""I think I was about 40 years too young for that."" In all honesty though, it isn't quite that bad. While I don't necessarily fall into the demographic it's aimed towards, there are still things to enjoy and appreciate along the way. The humor featured in the film did seem to fall flat more often than not, but I found things were at their strongest whenever somebody told a story about their past. That's when things would become the most emotional, genuine, and absorbing. The heartfelt moments were greater than the attempts at humor. The message the film gives is also easy to relate to as everyone wants to reach the top of that mountain and life is always taking turns we don't expect.

1498620,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B005S9EJ14,,"[17, 69]","I watched ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in a theater full of senior citizens and, as we were exiting the theater, I heard approximately two of them saying that they had actually enjoyed the movie.  That's understandable.  While ""Marigold Hotel"" is, for all practical purposes,  a movie of, by and for senior citizens, its appeal may fall short of expectations.The story is simple.  A group of English retirees answer the call to spend their golden years in affordable luxury at the titular hotel in India.  After flight cancellations force the group to catch a bus and tuk-tuks (three-wheeled auto rickshaws) to their destination, they are disappointed to find that the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a rundown mess, a ruin of its former glory (or perhaps not).  Many mishaps ensue as the Brits try and make the best of the situation and not run back to England with their collective tails between their legs.  The movie, a comedy-drama has tons of potential and should have been so much better, but director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"") has fashioned an old fashioned movie with so little humor or drama that the movie is rendered lifeless.The elite cast that Madden has assembled could perform the roles of these stereotypical characters in their sleep.  There's a recently widowed woman who has never done a thing on her own (Judi Dench); a browbeaten husband and his nagging scold of a wife (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton); a desperately flirtatious golddigger of a certain age (Celia Imrie); a gay judge suffering tremendous guilt over events in the past (Tom Wilkinson); a fun-loving tomcat ready to pounce on any woman who'll say yes (Ronald Pickup); and, of course, Maggie Smith as a sour-faced ex-housekeeper (as opposed to her usual role as a sour-faced aristocrat).  The situations the actors are thrown into are telegraphed far in advance, and there are absolutely no surprises.  We already surmise that one of the characters will not make it to the end of the movie, and it's an egregious irritant that director Madden reaches back to film mores of the fifties to ensure that it's the ""right"" character who dies.Other than Celia Imrie, and a lovely turn by Diana Hardcastle (as randy Pickup's understanding conquest), I think the Indian actors come off best.  ""Slumdog Millionaire's"" Dev Patel is delightful as young Sonny, the inexperienced and cash-poor proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (which he inherited from his equally inexperienced and inept father).  Sonny's efforts to keep the hotel afloat and his genuine concern for his residents shine through in Patel's radiant performance.  Tena Desae, as Sonny's girlfriend, a call-center operator, also amuses and does her best to keep her character afloat in an overpopulated dead sea of clich&eacute;s.Ben Davis' cinematography wonderfully captures the many hues and the whirling dervish continuity of life, which makes this film all the more disappointing.

My immediate reaction had been that this is a movie that I wanted to see over and again, if just for the pure pleasure in seeing people who can prove that it's good to be over sixty and be able to explore new horizons. For me, this is unquestionably one of the best movies of the year.Director John Madden's comedy about English retirees in India is a fascinating mix of both the familiar and the exotic. Ol Parker's screenplay is an adaptation from British author Deborah Moggach's bookThese Foolish Things(2004), and the casting is true perfection. It begins in the UK with brief sketches of seven British senior citizens, which sets the stage.We find Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) on the phone in her London flat, trying to communicate with a robotic operator at an Indian call center. She's a recent widow and is forced to sell her home after learning that her deceased husband had misused their life savings. It's Evelyn's blog entries, read aloud as narrative, that set the film's timeline.There's Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a xenophobic, crabby shrew, a never-married retired housekeeper bound to her wheelchair. She needs a hip replacement, and makes the trip because in India the surgery will be cheaper and doesn't require a month long wait. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are an argumentative couple that sank their nest egg into their daughter's failing start-up company.Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) and Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) are two singles looking for a change from the older British dating scene. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) is a retired judge with a guilty past who grew up in Jaipur, and is returning there for the first time since his youth.All seven are drawn to ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the elderly and beautiful"" in Jaipur, India, based on an advertisement inspired more by the proprietors' hopes than on reality. The seven seniors travel to India, and as we find out, the hotel is anything but the Best or Exotic.It's here at the Marigold Hotel that they meet their host, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), a nave, completely disorganized yet highly enthusiastic young man. Must admit that I had to stifle my laughter in the theater and again when viewing the DVD, watching Sonny trying to explain to his guests that the hotel has no working telephones and that some rooms are without doors, something that had been neglected ahead of time. He is the film's comic lead, and his often-hyperactive performance often borders on pure slapstick. His exclamation was perfect:""Everything will be all right in the end... if it's not all right then it's not the end.""Sonny is under extreme pressure from his arrogant, domineering mother to give up the hotel as a lost cause and go along with an arranged marriage in Delhi. But complicating matters, Sonny is in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae), a call center worker. It gets interesting (and a bit ironic) when Evelyn takes a job in the call center instructing the workers how to speak to British people on the phone... classic Judi Dench.Watching Muriel's gradual transformation from a racist and crabby shrew to a caring and sensitive woman may have stretched credibility a bit. But considering the never-married housekeeper background of her character, it's something that few besides Maggie Smith could pull off so well.The overall plot is beautifully interwoven with the subplots, and viewers will be treated to some mild surprises. Without dropping any spoilers, watch for Douglas (Bill Nighy) having a blast exploring the nearby temples and such, yet that does have its results with his wife. The antics of Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) in their quests for romance are hilarious in parts. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) offers a touching performance on many levels as he proceeds with his personal quest.If there was any disappointment at all for this viewer, it was the hope that somewhere and at some point, Bill Nighy would break out of playing his role as a browbeaten husband and burst into that mad aging rocker that he did to well inLove Actually, but we can't have everything.The Best Exotic Marigold Hotelis lively, irreverent and enjoyable when Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton are doing their crabby senior citizen performances. It produces some real laughs and offers truly brilliant performances from a highly experienced cast.

I found it to be quite captivating and am very glad that I made the effort to see it.  I recommend it to others.In brief, the film revolves around the coming together of seven elderly and somewhat impecunious Britons who, of their own volition, and quite separately, decide to retire to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur.  They discovered the place on the internet and, as we all should know, the internet can sometimes be a bit misleading.  Indeed, this is the case here.  The hotel had been billed as a marvelous palace when, in fact, it was tired and chaotic.The seven visitors form the key members of the cast and are led by Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy.  Some can adjust to the way of life in India while others fail completely.  Along the way, we are given a peek into daily life in India in all its colour and noise.The movie is often funny but always enthralling.  I will say no more as to the plot.

It's a story about a group of seven elderly British citizens who decided one way or another to spend their time in a rundown hotel in India for ""the elderly and beautiful"".  Of course, none of them knew before leaving England that this hotel was NOT as shown in the glossy brochure they saw, but a dilapidated place in India, managed by a young man whose dream was much bigger than his wallet.  At first, the group was horrified, but they soon adjust to their exotic environment.  Each had their reason for going to India.  Some in search of lost love, while others in search of independence and, in one case, a new hip.The screenplay was witty and the plot moved along.  My only complaint was that the introduction was rather rushed so was bit confusing.  But never mind.  The movie had a GREAT cast and the director did a fine job of weaving the scenes!

I had no idea what to expect when I saw the title ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" come up on HBO's list of movies...but with Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Judi Dench I knew it wasn't something to take lightly.  I was hooked by the time that fabulous score took off in the airport lounge, and I was soaring right with it.  The pacing of the film, the score, the photography, the casting--superb.My hat is off especially to Penelope Wilton, who gave a pitch-perfect portrayal of a ""Brit control-freak"" barely holding it together with that British stiff upper lip.  I suppose the term ""seriocomic"" could be used to describe her performance, since this is definitely not a tense, dramatic film--but the way she was able to craft her character, who finally came to terms with who she had been/was being, and was able to let go, was emotionally so satisfying to feel and watch.At age 67, I could absolutely imagine myself in every moment of this film--and wished I was.  I have mentioned it to friends who are under 50 who do not seem interested in seeing it--so perhaps it speaks more to those of us who have gone beyond trying to succeed in this success-driven society, living inauthentic lives to a greater or lesser extent.I have watched Marigold Hotel at least half a dozen times and will no doubt continue to watch it many times more.

The characters all feel genuine and all have a realistic feel to them. Each character is more dynamic than you expect them to be and the problems that each character faces are ageless.

1498706,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,B005S9EJ14,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[1, 1]","I put the video in and was confronted with several 20th Century Fox ads for their Blu-Ray movies that lasted about 5 minutes. I clicked the Play button and the video stopped. I had to start all over again with the ads for their movies. By that time I almost lost interest in watching the film. So, each time you want to view this video, you have to watch the same ads over again: no skipping ahead to avoid them. Annoying to the point that I won't buy any other videos distributed by 20th Century Fox....The film has been described well already. It is an interesting look at those having to make decisions as to where to live when life diminishes money and health. The choice of the internet ad for an Exotic Indian Hotel is a typical overblown description of its true condition, and each person reacts differently to life in India.The characters are not all fully developed, but one man does have a particular interest in re-visiting his old neighborhood -- which has changed completely. We see his anguish and a later reaction, thus making his story more interesting. Maggie Smith does a particularly good representation of those who only go to India for cheaper surgery than in England, and her part is well presented all through the film. Her role changes from one aspect to an ending which is a surprise.The film is one you want to say is ""wonderful."" However, it almost glosses over too many characters who cannot all have their stories developed. Dench portrays a widow who decides to ""go it alone"" instead of moving in with her children, and I waited for a better storyline than quickly finding a job -- and then she almost flounders through the rest of the film. As always, a good performance, but not up to the par we expect.The young owner of the hotel and his mother have a more involved and interesting portrayal of the traditions of Indian families, and he is the ""best"" character in the film, IMO.It is a film for those who enjoy a rather slow-moving peek into seniors' lives who must find a less expensive way of living. The busy streets of the city are what you can see/hear on any very short travel video. I can recommend it with reserve, but don't expect an exciting adventure or even an intensive look into each character's personality or the changes that may or may not happen to them. I happen to like this type of film, but it isn't for everyone. The actors are fine, but it lacks substance. Again, just my opinion.",3,One Flaw: 20th Century Fox.

It is not a Ha Ha comedy,it is a black comedy that the Brits do so well. Like ""One Foot In the Grave"" and such. You get humor and reality all rolled into one, just a whole lot like real life. What appealed to me, besides the great cast, was being set in India. I like seeing and learning about other cultures and lifestyles and I get ""into"" it as if I was there trying to make my way through the crowds and hearing all the noises that are the large cities in India. I also appreciate that everything is not the whites only country club setting, and we see the hard scrabble side as well. I think they did a good job of showing the up sides and the down sides of anglo-european/anglo-americans that try to live outside of their native lands in countries where they tend to feel they are special. This is even more unusual being that they are all older and in theory set in their ways, yet most of them manage to adjust and decide to stay on. Only one decides she can not and will not cope, she is totally unhappy to the point of making everyone else miserable too, and you are releaved to see her head home. Watch this, then watch ""Jewel in the Crown"" to see the difference in the attitudes of the Brits. Bear in mind that Jewel is set circa world war 2 and the feeling of entitlement is so much stronger. Another good one to compare this one to is ""Ghandi"" or ""Passage to India"" All great British made flicks. I have to watch this one again anyway just to absorb more of the backround. Most scenes there is so much going on, it is hard to see everything...

The basic premise of the movie is that a group of older Britons travel to India to reside in a hotel near Jaipur. What they have been sold, and what they actually get, are two different things, but, between them, somehow, this group of strangers finds something worthwhile. On this, the book and the movie agree, but on many significant points, the movie differs greatly from the novel. Norman, well played by Ronald Pickup, is much less objectionable in the movie. Maggie Smith does a wonderful portrayal of Muriel Donnelly, as does Judi Dench of Evelyn Greenslade. Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) is a similar character in both movie and novel, but Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) is markedly different. Graham Dashwood, played by Tom Wilkinson, is an entirely new character who seems to be a composite of Adam Ainslie, Graham Turner and Dorothy Miller. Celia Imrie does a magnificent job playing Madge Hardcastle (MadgeRheinhart in the book) and Dev Patel is marvellous as Sonny Kapoor, another composite (Sonny Rahim and Minoo Cowsajee).

The hotel, as often is the case when viewing something on the net, turns out to be not what is expected and actually far from it.  It is a story of contrasts from that point on. Some of the travelers embrace the sights, sounds, and adventures that lie ahead and some fight the differences from the start. Not done strictly for laughs though there are many hilarious moments, there are poignant scenes that resonate as well as scenes that exemplify how sensitive people can be at times and how blind they can be at others.

A group of British pensioners decide to spend their last days - exactly why is not made quite clear - in a rundown hotel in Jaipur.  Some of them learn to adapt to new ways of life; others find it difficult, if not impossible.  John Madden's film emphasizes the importance of learning how to listen and look, especially when living in another culture.  On occasions the film resorts to crude stereotyping to make its point: Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) comes across as the well-meaning yet inefficient hotelier, while Penelope Wilton's Jean Ainslie remains a total snob throughout, believing that India lacks the 'civilized' aspects of Britain.  By contrast Judi Dench's Evelyn Greenslade is a masterpiece of understatement, as she discovers things about herself that she could never have found while in England.  Ronald Pickup's Norman Cousins realizes that he retains sexual energy, while Tom Wilkinson's Graham Dashwood comes to terms with his past.  While the film ends with a rather banal voiceover informing us about how age is no barrier to self-discovery, it is nonetheless entertaining to watch.",3,Good Film if You Like to Watch British Actors Doing Their Stuff,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1235,"['BEST', 'EXOTIC', 'MARIGOLD', 'HOTEL', 'strong', 'echoes', 'other', ""'British-in-India"", 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'HEAT', 'AND', 'DUST', 'A', 'PASSAGE', 'TO', 'INDIA', 'A', 'group', 'British', 'pensioners', 'decide', 'spend', 'last', 'days', 'exactly', 'why', 'not', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'rundown', 'hotel', 'Jaipur', 'learn', 'adapt', 'new', 'ways', 'life', 'others', 'find', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'John', 'Madden', 'film', 'importance', 'learning', 'how', 'listen', 'look', 'especially', 'when', 'living', 'culture', 'occasions', 'film', 'resorts', 'crude', 'stereotyping', 'make', 'point', 'Sonny', 'Kapoor', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'well-meaning', 'yet', 'inefficient', 'hotelier', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Jean', 'Ainslie', 'total', 'snob', 'believing', 'India', ""'civilized"", 'aspects', 'Britain', 'contrast', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Evelyn', 'Greenslade', 'masterpiece', 'understatement', 'things', 'herself', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'found', 'England', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Norman', 'Cousins', 'sexual', 'energy', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Graham', 'Dashwood', 'terms', 'past', 'film', 'rather', 'banal', 'voiceover', 'informing', 'how', 'age', 'barrier', 'self-discovery', 'nonetheless', 'entertaining', 'watch']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","In ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" seven British retirees fall for an Internet come-on that advertises a reasonably priced, grand and peaceful retreat in Jaipur, India.  After an exhausting trip, the travelers finally reach their destination, only to learn that the retreat is far from grand and not particularly peaceful.  The hotel is rather decrepit, and the surrounding area is teeming with bicyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, beggars, children at play, and sidewalk vendors loudly hawking their wares.John Madden directs with a sure touch, eliciting superb performances from his stellar cast.  Judi Dench is the recently widowed Evelyn; she is eager to manage on her own after decades of relying on her husband.  Tom Wilkinson is Graham, a high court judge with a secret that has weighed on his mind for years.  Maggie Smith, the never married Muriel, is in India to have inexpensive hip replacement surgery; she is an unabashed racist who makes no secret of her bigotry.  Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are Douglas and Jean, an unhappily married couple who stay together more out of habit than desire.  Celia Imrie is Madge, a lonely woman who craves male companionship, and Ronald Pickup is Norman, who is desperate to snuggle up to an attractive female.  The guests are greeted at the Marigold Hotel by its irrationally exuberant manager, Sonny, played to the hilt by Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame.  Sonny is trying to obtain funding so that he can transform the hotel into the beautiful retirement facility that currently exists only in his imagination.  Unfortunately, his overbearing mother is determined to take him back to New Delhi and away from his sexy girlfriend, Sunaina.The screenplay by Ol Parker is uneven; there are melodramatic and far-fetched elements throughout the film that require a sizeable suspension of disbelief.  Nevertheless, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is terrific entertainment, with its colorful palette that shows off India's energy and spirit.  There are quite a few deliciously humorous scenes.  For instance, Judi Dench educates young Indian call-center workers on how to handle overseas calls with tact, grace, and humanity, instead of speaking robotically from a script.  Other funny bits include Norman trying to convince a young woman that he would be a good catch and Sonny's mother loudly browbeating her son in public.  The film is poignant in its depiction of the humiliation and physical deterioration that can make old age so daunting.  Muriel reveals her somewhat gloomy history to a woman who speaks only Hindi; Madge gloomily contemplates her solitary future; and Douglas and Jean finally acknowledge that they have grown apart.  The feel-good conclusion is contrived, but the acting is so wonderful that audiences will be thrilled to watch a movie about real people, instead of superheroes, trying to cope with life's disappointments and daring to embrace its undreamed of possibilities.",4,"""Can we be blamed for feeling we are too old to change?""",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2963,"['Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'seven', 'British', 'retirees', 'fall', 'Internet', 'come-on', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'grand', 'peaceful', 'retreat', 'Jaipur', 'India', 'exhausting', 'trip', 'travelers', 'finally', 'reach', 'destination', 'only', 'learn', 'retreat', 'far', 'grand', 'not', 'particularly', 'peaceful', 'hotel', 'rather', 'decrepit', 'surrounding', 'area', 'teeming', 'bicyclists', 'motorcyclists', 'pedestrians', 'beggars', 'children', 'play', 'sidewalk', 'vendors', 'loudly', 'hawking', 'wares.John', 'Madden', 'sure', 'touch', 'eliciting', 'superb', 'performances', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Evelyn', 'eager', 'manage', 'own', 'decades', 'relying', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Graham', 'high', 'court', 'judge', 'secret', 'weighed', 'mind', 'years', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'never', 'married', 'Muriel', 'India', 'have', 'inexpensive', 'hip', 'replacement', 'surgery', 'unabashed', 'racist', 'who', 'secret', 'bigotry', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'are', 'Douglas', 'Jean', 'unhappily', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'stay', 'together', 'more', 'habit', 'desire', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'Madge', 'lonely', 'woman', 'who', 'male', 'companionship', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Norman', 'who', 'desperate', 'snuggle', 'up', 'attractive', 'female', 'guests', 'are', 'greeted', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'irrationally', 'exuberant', 'manager', 'Sonny', 'played', 'hilt', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'fame', 'Sonny', 'trying', 'obtain', 'funding', 'so', 'can', 'transform', 'hotel', 'beautiful', 'retirement', 'facility', 'currently', 'only', 'imagination', 'Unfortunately', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'determined', 'take', 'back', 'New', 'Delhi', 'away', 'sexy', 'girlfriend', 'Sunaina.The', 'screenplay', 'Ol', 'Parker', 'uneven', 'are', 'melodramatic', 'far-fetched', 'elements', 'film', 'require', 'sizeable', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Nevertheless', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'terrific', 'entertainment', 'colorful', 'palette', 'India', 'energy', 'spirit', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'deliciously', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'instance', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'young', 'Indian', 'call-center', 'workers', 'how', 'handle', 'overseas', 'calls', 'tact', 'grace', 'humanity', 'instead', 'speaking', 'robotically', 'script', 'Other', 'funny', 'bits', 'include', 'Norman', 'trying', 'convince', 'young', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'catch', 'Sonny', 'mother', 'loudly', 'browbeating', 'son', 'public', 'film', 'poignant', 'depiction', 'humiliation', 'physical', 'deterioration', 'can', 'make', 'old', 'age', 'so', 'daunting', 'Muriel', 'somewhat', 'gloomy', 'history', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'Hindi', 'Madge', 'gloomily', 'solitary', 'future', 'Douglas', 'Jean', 'finally', 'acknowledge', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'feel-good', 'conclusion', 'contrived', 'acting', 'so', 'wonderful', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'watch', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'instead', 'superheroes', 'trying', 'cope', 'life', 'disappointments', 'daring', 'embrace', 'undreamed', 'possibilities']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

This is exactly what happens under the reins of director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) with this whimsical 2012 dramedy that brings together a sterling cast of accomplished British veterans to play seniors who choose to ""outsource"" their retirement in India's colorfully mythical Rajasthan region. What they discover upon their arrival is a decrepit hotel run by an irrepressible young owner appropriately named Sonny. Optimistic to a buoyant extreme, he tries to gloss over the hotel's numerous shortcomings with a mix of responses from his rather addled guests, and their individual transitions into the local culture is what makes up their narrative adapted by screenwriter Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's 2004 novel,These Foolish Things.The group of seven strangers who turn up on the steps of the Marigold Hotel is led by Evelyn, a recent widow who finds she has been saddled with her husband's seemingly insurmountable debts. Through her blog, she provides the film's central voice as she identifies her tentative steps toward not only assimilation into the Indian way of life but her own personal emancipation. Graham is a high-court judge who chooses early retirement in order to find the love of his youthful ardor when he lived in Jaipur as a boy. There's Muriel, an irascible spinster who is looking for a cheap hip replacement and plans to go back to England given her acute xenophobia. An unhappily married couple, Douglas and Jean, have come to the Marigold because they can't otherwise afford a retirement residence that meets her material needs. And then there are two singles both looking for mates in a new locale - saucy Madge who pretends to be Princess Margaret to gain entry into an exclusive club and incorrigible Norman who catches the eye of a lonely widow.Sonny has his own issues as he faces stern maternal protest to his efforts to save the family hotel and marry the fetching girl he loves, an employee at a local call center. Needless to say, each character figures out what to do to work through their challenges as their lives change in the process. The cast is unsurprisingly excellent even though some of the characters are rather sketchily developed. Judi Dench lends her particular gravitas to Evelyn as she evolves from fearful to empowered due to her fulfilling job as a cultural instructor at the call center. Tom Wilkinson makes Graham's journey to India a genuinely poignant one with an unexpected denouement. Maggie Smith steals scenes easily as Muriel, although I have to admit I found her changed attitude the most incredulous to accept. Bill Nighy plays put-upon Douglas with charming vulnerability, while Penelope Wilton has the unenviable task of playing the shrewish, frightened Jean with conviction.In roles originally slated for Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole (...how lovely it would have been to see such cinema icons in this film), Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup provide a nice blend of impudence and optimism to Madge and Norman. Bringing youthful vigor to their lives is Dev Patel in his first major role sinceSlumdog Millionaire, and he brings a welcome comic ebullience to the proceedings as Sonny. Despite the creakiness of some of the plot devices, Madden keeps the pacing nimble enough so that no one character's arc dominates the tone of the film, which is crucial in reinforcing the message of hope he and Parker are conveying within the context of retirement and old age, that indeed life can get better with the proper attitude. Particular kudos need to be given to cinematographer Ben Davis (The Debt) who captures the teeming life and colorful splendor of Jaipur and Udaipur. This is not a film for the Avengers fanboys, but clearly the appeal of the distinguished cast and exotic locales has a clear target audience.",4,Distinguished Veteran Cast Handle Late Game Changes in Faraway India,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,3991,"['Exotic', 'locations', 'old-fashioned', 'storytelling', 'conventions', 'are', 'nothing', 'revolutionary', 'movies', 'when', 'executed', 'professionalism', 'abundant', 'heart', 'can', 'make', 'charming', 'entertainment', 'exactly', 'what', 'reins', 'director', 'John', 'Madden', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'whimsical', '2012', 'dramedy', 'together', 'sterling', 'cast', 'accomplished', 'British', 'veterans', 'play', 'seniors', 'who', 'choose', 'outsource', 'retirement', 'India', 'colorfully', 'mythical', 'Rajasthan', 'region', 'What', 'discover', 'arrival', 'decrepit', 'hotel', 'run', 'irrepressible', 'young', 'owner', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Optimistic', 'buoyant', 'extreme', 'gloss', 'hotel', 'numerous', 'shortcomings', 'mix', 'responses', 'rather', 'addled', 'guests', 'individual', 'transitions', 'local', 'culture', 'what', 'up', 'narrative', 'adapted', 'screenwriter', 'Ol', 'Parker', 'Deborah', 'Moggach', '2004', 'novel', 'Foolish', 'Things.The', 'group', 'seven', 'strangers', 'who', 'turn', 'up', 'steps', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'led', 'Evelyn', 'recent', 'widow', 'who', 'been', 'saddled', 'husband', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'debts', 'blog', 'film', 'central', 'voice', 'tentative', 'steps', 'not', 'only', 'assimilation', 'Indian', 'way', 'life', 'own', 'personal', 'emancipation', 'Graham', 'high-court', 'judge', 'who', 'early', 'retirement', 'order', 'find', 'love', 'youthful', 'ardor', 'when', 'lived', 'Jaipur', 'boy', 'Muriel', 'irascible', 'spinster', 'who', 'looking', 'cheap', 'hip', 'replacement', 'plans', 'go', 'back', 'England', 'given', 'acute', 'xenophobia', 'unhappily', 'married', 'couple', 'Douglas', 'Jean', 'have', 'come', 'Marigold', 'ca', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'afford', 'retirement', 'residence', 'material', 'needs', 'then', 'are', 'two', 'singles', 'looking', 'mates', 'new', 'locale', 'saucy', 'Madge', 'who', 'be', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'gain', 'entry', 'exclusive', 'club', 'incorrigible', 'Norman', 'who', 'eye', 'lonely', 'widow.Sonny', 'own', 'issues', 'stern', 'maternal', 'protest', 'efforts', 'save', 'family', 'hotel', 'marry', 'fetching', 'girl', 'employee', 'local', 'call', 'center', 'Needless', 'say', 'character', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'work', 'challenges', 'lives', 'change', 'process', 'cast', 'unsurprisingly', 'excellent', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'sketchily', 'developed', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'particular', 'gravitas', 'Evelyn', 'fearful', 'empowered', 'due', 'fulfilling', 'job', 'cultural', 'instructor', 'call', 'center', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Graham', 'journey', 'India', 'genuinely', 'poignant', 'one', 'unexpected', 'denouement', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'steals', 'scenes', 'easily', 'Muriel', 'have', 'admit', 'found', 'changed', 'attitude', 'most', 'incredulous', 'accept', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'put-upon', 'Douglas', 'charming', 'vulnerability', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'unenviable', 'task', 'playing', 'shrewish', 'frightened', 'Jean', 'conviction.In', 'roles', 'originally', 'slated', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'how', 'lovely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'such', 'cinema', 'icons', 'film', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'provide', 'nice', 'blend', 'impudence', 'optimism', 'Madge', 'Norman', 'Bringing', 'youthful', 'vigor', 'lives', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'sinceSlumdog', 'Millionaire', 'welcome', 'comic', 'ebullience', 'proceedings', 'Sonny', 'creakiness', 'plot', 'devices', 'Madden', 'pacing', 'nimble', 'enough', 'one', 'character', 'arc', 'tone', 'film', 'crucial', 'reinforcing', 'message', 'hope', 'Parker', 'are', 'conveying', 'context', 'retirement', 'old', 'age', 'indeed', 'life', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'proper', 'attitude', 'Particular', 'kudos', 'need', 'be', 'given', 'cinematographer', 'Ben', 'Davis', 'Debt', 'who', 'teeming', 'life', 'colorful', 'splendor', 'Jaipur', 'Udaipur', 'not', 'film', 'Avengers', 'fanboys', 'clearly', 'appeal', 'distinguished', 'cast', 'exotic', 'locales', 'clear', 'target', 'audience']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

John Madden, 2011, 124 minutes) is one of the funniest and most delightful British films ever to have been made. It isn't just the star power, the lovely novelty of the story or the humor. It is one of those rare films that completely transcends the sum of its parts. With this kind of 'British Who's Who', that is an accomplishment indeed.A short list of elderly, retired and otherwise 'autumn years' Britishers decide to retire to the eponymous Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly & Beautiful in Jaipur, India. Now, I can't say what might drive retirees and widows to India from English soil, so it seemed like a stretch to me - but I settled in for the fun anyway. A list is not sufficient: I am also including the ages of these actors. It is one thing you absolutely will not believe.Tom Wilkinson (64) plays a retired High Court judge with many secrets but was born and raised in India;Bill Nighy (63) is a retired civil servant looking for a better quality of life than a crummy flat has to offer and seems oblivious to the nervous rage of his wife (Penelope Wilton, 66);Dame Judi Dench (78) is a desperate, debt-riddled widow;Dame Maggie Smith (78) is a low-class racist who needs hip replacement and can only find it quickly in a trial program in India;Ronald Pickup (72) is a tired old aristo with a sagging love life;Celia Imrie (60) is a fed-up grandmother who seems to loathe babysitting her grandkids.What a LIST! And they are better here than I've seen them in years, HARRY POTTER years included. At the hotel - which is in India, so of course it's an absolute condemned building as they discover - they find the ""lunatic"" Sonny (a marvelous and rather attractive Dev Patel) running the place in fulfillment of his late father's dream.I had to wonder whether this is a remake ... I happen to know Jaipur, the scenes were somewhat familiar, but for the life of me I cannot say this is a remake of anything, it is based on a novel, yet I feel I have seen this film before. It's my belief that instant classics sometimes do that to you.This film echoes a few others I love:Love Actually,Another Year,Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, and the American-madeOutsourced(see my reviews for the latter three films).

Judi Dench, Grande Dame of all British performance art, is a widow facing complete dissolution owing to the demise of her spouse, who has run everything; Tom Wilkinson, a leading barrister, has reached the end of playing footsie with bureaucracy; Muriel (Maggie Smith) needs an expensive hip replacement, which can be managed far more efficiently, not to mention cheaply, in Jaipur. Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) are facing placement in a restricted home for the old and incompetent; Norman (Ronald Pickup) is a lonely elder gent who just wants to find a compatible lady. In desperation, they turn to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful in Jaipur, India - a place where, the brochure assures, they can live out their golden years in comfort.The establishment presents more challenges, inevitably, than are assured in the flyer. Things don't work; rooms have not been lived in in apparent decades; difficulties in cultural assimilation have not been addressed. However that is, some of the senior recruits dive into their new environment with enthusiasm, while others look upon their surroundings with little less than horror. One in particular has lived here before, and his attempts to revisit the well-remembered locations of his youth are bittersweet at the finest. One, who arrives a confirmed bigot, evolves in the most lovely way into an informed and sympathetic advocate. And all, apparently, experience an epiphany of restricted values, with the possible exception of one lady who simply cannot evolve into a new frame of thinking.I found myself numerous times on the verge of tears, of affinity, of you-go, of understanding. When you reach a certain age, you begin to weigh your options; I can't deny that I've thought about exotic locales that are purported to be very reasonable to live in - but the thought of uprooting myself to put down roots in an entirely different culture is daunting. Judi Dench's embracing of the life in India is refreshing to say the  least.Dev Petel (Slumdog Millionaire)as the proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has his own problems to work through, with a domineering mother who aspires for a more advantageous union for her third son, while he has already decided that he wants nothing less than Sunaina (Tena Desae) who is a lowly worker at a call center.This is a most involving film.  I never realized two hours had passed, and was truly invested in the convoluted lives of both the inhabitants of the Marigold Hotel and its hapless and striving proprietor. Maggie Smith in particular, Grande Dame who should be knighted, if that's possible, is particularly intriguing to watch; her evolution from confirmed bigot to informed lady is beautiful to watch.I cannot invest too much credit upon this film. It is one of the best I have seen in years. Enjoy it with an open heart and an open mind, and thoroughly enjoy the performances of several established masters of the craft of acting.",5,curry for the soul,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,3402,"['Let', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'coming', 'someone', 'looking', 'down', 'sights', 'very', 'big', 'geriatric', 'gun.This', 'undeniably', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year.A', 'number', 'older', 'retirees', 'number', 'reasons', 'decides', 'India', 'place', 'where', 'will', 'live', 'out', 'golden', 'years', 'more', 'acceptance', 'others.This', 'film', 'presents', 'performances', 'premier', 'British', 'actors', 'times', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Grande', 'Dame', 'British', 'performance', 'art', 'widow', 'facing', 'complete', 'dissolution', 'owing', 'demise', 'spouse', 'who', 'run', 'everything', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'leading', 'barrister', 'reached', 'end', 'playing', 'footsie', 'bureaucracy', 'Muriel', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'expensive', 'hip', 'replacement', 'can', 'be', 'managed', 'far', 'more', 'efficiently', 'not', 'mention', 'cheaply', 'Jaipur', 'Douglas', 'Jean', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'are', 'facing', 'placement', 'restricted', 'home', 'old', 'incompetent', 'Norman', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'lonely', 'elder', 'gent', 'who', 'just', 'find', 'compatible', 'lady', 'desperation', 'turn', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'Elderly', 'Beautiful', 'Jaipur', 'India', 'place', 'where', 'brochure', 'can', 'live', 'out', 'golden', 'years', 'comfort.The', 'establishment', 'presents', 'more', 'challenges', 'inevitably', 'are', 'assured', 'flyer', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'rooms', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'lived', 'apparent', 'decades', 'difficulties', 'cultural', 'assimilation', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'addressed', 'However', 'senior', 'recruits', 'dive', 'new', 'environment', 'enthusiasm', 'others', 'look', 'surroundings', 'little', 'less', 'horror', 'One', 'particular', 'lived', 'here', 'before', 'attempts', 'revisit', 'well-remembered', 'locations', 'youth', 'are', 'bittersweet', 'finest', 'One', 'who', 'confirmed', 'bigot', 'most', 'lovely', 'way', 'informed', 'sympathetic', 'advocate', 'apparently', 'experience', 'epiphany', 'restricted', 'values', 'possible', 'exception', 'one', 'lady', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'evolve', 'new', 'frame', 'thinking.I', 'found', 'numerous', 'times', 'verge', 'tears', 'affinity', 'you-go', 'understanding', 'When', 'reach', 'certain', 'age', 'begin', 'weigh', 'options', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'exotic', 'locales', 'are', 'purported', 'be', 'very', 'reasonable', 'live', 'thought', 'uprooting', 'put', 'down', 'roots', 'entirely', 'different', 'culture', 'daunting', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'embracing', 'life', 'India', 'refreshing', 'say', 'least.Dev', 'Petel', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'proprietor', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'own', 'problems', 'work', 'domineering', 'mother', 'who', 'more', 'advantageous', 'union', 'third', 'son', 'already', 'decided', 'nothing', 'less', 'Sunaina', 'Tena', 'Desae', 'who', 'lowly', 'worker', 'call', 'center.This', 'most', 'involving', 'film', 'never', 'realized', 'two', 'hours', 'had', 'passed', 'was', 'truly', 'invested', 'convoluted', 'lives', 'inhabitants', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'hapless', 'striving', 'proprietor', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'particular', 'Grande', 'Dame', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'knighted', 'possible', 'particularly', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'evolution', 'confirmed', 'bigot', 'informed', 'lady', 'beautiful', 'watch.I', 'can', 'not', 'invest', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Enjoy', 'open', 'heart', 'open', 'mind', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'several', 'established', 'masters', 'craft', 'acting']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Sounded like a great story but what a disappointment.Except for the (as usual) stellar performances of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, I thought the movie was boring and pretentious. It seemed the actors were merely reading their lines throughout this movie. There was no emotion conveyed, at least not enough for me to get into the story and forget that it was just a movie. When that happens, I love it. In this case, I never did get past the &#34;acting&#34; throughout.I also thought the story line about Tom Wilkinson being involved with a Indian man sexually, many years before and then that man ending up marrying an Indian woman in later life,didn't ring true. I don't think that would be in line with traditional Indian values and that this man in all likelihood would have remained an outcast and shunned by his family. Not accepted as a husband to this woman; in spite of her being able to accept and live with, his past.This movie could have been so much better. It had potential.

Boating one of the finest casts of veteran actors from England it is a film that pays attention to the lives and emotions of senior citizens  - and has a terrific time in the process.A group of British retirees decide to ""outsource"" their retirement to less expensive and seemingly exotic India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.  The story begins in London where the brief but necessary groundwork for our group of elder citizens is established - the frustrations of retirement, the death of a husband, the crumbling of a marriage of convenience, and the need for feeling physically attractive when facing a mirror. Once our entourage arrives in Jaipur (amongst the squalor of poverty matched by the sense of freedom of living in the moment) they are greeted by the young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, whose enthusiasm and optimism suffuse the entire film.The new tenants are a varied bunch: Muriel (Maggie Smith) has come to India (despite her hideous bigotry and racism) for a hip replacement, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a new widow unable to afford a retirement home in England and longing for adventure, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and his chronically cranky wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) likewise cannot afford the embarrassment and finances of a British retirement facility, Norman (Ronald Pickup) who cannot `face' aging and the lack of feminine accompaniment, Madge (Celia Imrie) who longs to discover a man to love, and Graham (Tom Wilkerson) a gay man whose lived in the closet in England forever guilty about his true love he left in India many years ago.  Stir this kettle, add romance (not only from Sonny and his lower caste girlfriend Sunaina -Tena Desae, but also the awakening of new love in most all of the tenants o the Marigold), and out pours a film of physical beauty, memorable bits of philosophy from both the old and young, and a sense of discovery which is always at the end  - `or it isn't the end.'

All seem to play a character written just for them. That happens sometimes for one actor, but this time it's for many in one film. Perhaps it just seems that way because they are legendary contemporary actors, always at top performance, and make their characters seem so real. Either way, it's British Comedy/Drama perfection.Begin with Dame Judi Dench (Cranford, Love in a Cold Climate, As Time Goes By) and Dame Maggie Smith (Downton Abbey, Harry Potter). Those 2 in one film almost guarantees 5 stars. Then add some more favorites like Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean), Ronald Pickup (Fortunes of War, Jennie), Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey, South Riding), and Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Titanic, Calendar Girls). To top off the cast, they are given a great dialogue script. It's fast-pace but keeping up with this set of old-timers is pure joy.Deborah Moggach wrote the adapted novel, ""These Foolish Things."" She also wrote: Love in a Cold Climate, Diary of Anne Frank, To Have and To Hold, Pride & Prejudice, and more for TV &/or film.Youth will give this a pass, but older adults will LOVE it. It's so right on for anyone old enough to look forward to retirement. But truth shows in the story, it's not always what is expected. Body or spirit or relationships.

The teaser line about British pensioners in an Indian residence hotel seemed a setup for one cultural cliche after another.  Well, the cliches are certainly present, but before we condemn all cliche we should look at the origins of the word itself.  A 'cliche' was originally the term applied to recurrent patterns of words and letters in the early days of moveable type.  The printer would bind these familiar sequences together so they could be used entire. In essence a cliche was a cluster of words that was familiar through repetition - and therefore worthy of being kept available for frequent use.In this case the familiar social issues (cliches) are in the hands of a super-star cast of characters who treat them with the respect - even reverence - they are due.

It is so refreshing to see a film not about teenage angst but about adults at the end of their lives taking charge of the short time they have left and living each day to the fullest.  When I saw this film recently in the theatre, the median age of the viewer had to be at least 63 years of age. As I waited in line, practically everyone in front of me said, ""one senior for `Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'."" And the audience didn't talk, didn't send text messages or check their phones. They applauded at the end of the movie too.The film, directed by John Madden, stars  Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.  My apologies to the other cast members if they are well-known. I did not recognize them. I did learn later that the young Indian actor Dev Patel was in ""Slumdog Millionaire.""  The subtle soundtrack does not intrude. The acting to a person is quite wonderful with no one actor stealing the show, a good thing I think. There are wonderful lines that will make you laugh although some of them are a bit over used-- we know that old people say they do not purchase green bananas, for instance-- but if you are not careful you will find your eyes burning in a place or two. The movie is based on a novel by Deborah Moggach entitled THESE FOOLISH THINGS. She also wrote TULIP FEVER. One of the characters is seen reading this novel, a nice touch and endorsement for the author. Seven Brits of retirement age all converge on a hotel in India that they have seen on the internet, only to find that all that glitters is not gold. How many of us have had the same experience? Postage-stamp-sized photographs of exotic hotels in far-away places that we find on the internet seldom look like the quarters when we check in, often to a room that we can barely turn around in.Such a fine message this film has: whatever you were planning to do, do it now.

I must warn the would be viewer, however, that the movie title fails to live up to its name.  The hotel is far from the best and is only exotic in the sense it takes place in a dusty, small town in India.  The hotel also appears to be on the verge of financial collapse.  The young manager, played by the charming Dev Patel, does his utmost to keep up the appearances of this seemingly fourth rate business.The would be guests complain about the hotel right from the very start.  Maggie Smith's character, who decides to stay at the hotel beause it is near a hospital that performs cheap and prompt hip replacement surgery, insists that only a British doctor may touch her.  Several of the others plan to use the Marigold hotel as a retirement home.  Tom Wilkinson hopes to find a former Indian lover there from whom there was an unfortunate break up.  Another couple decides to put an end to a 40 year marriage that apparently has lasted 35 years too long.One of best aspects of Marigold Hotel is its gentle humor, much of which is related to the foibles of each of the guests.  One particularly funny scene concerns some items that one of the women desires to purchase from a street vendor.  One of the male guests gives some advice to the would be purchaser to prevent her from being cheated.  His advice fails badly.  There are also several lovely romantic moments in the film.

It has a well-told story, perfectly paced, with superb acting, much humor, and sentimentality. The theme is ""everything turns out well at the end, and if it doesn't it is not the end."" Seven old men and women who have lost virtually all of their money and who are searching for some meaning in their life respond to a misleading advertisement that a hotel in India will give them an inexpensive and enjoyable stay, for it is the ""best"" and it is ""exotic."" The seven find that they spent money they can ill-afford to spend for a run-down deteriorating hotel managed by a very likable but totally incompetent owner.The seven are a woman whose husband mismanaged their funds who just died leaving her poor with nothing to do; a husband and wife who invested in their daughters business and lost everything, he has a good and respectful approach to people and events, she is bitchy and satisfied with nothing; a man who is gay who betrayed his lover when he was young, who had no satisfactory life afterwards, and wants to return to India and see him; a woman who is searching for a rich husband; a man who wants to regain his potency and have sex and an on-going relationship; and a woman who was once a housekeeper who was fired because she is old, who is prejudiced against anyone who is not British.The young hotel owner is in love with a poor young woman.

The hotel is old and unusual by western standards.  Most of the room don't even have doors and the food is too spicy. The new guests have difficulties adjusting to their environment, but each copes in his or her own way.  Evelyn must take a job at a call center that caters to English businesses; Jean and Doug quarrel, Jean staying in the hotel and Doug exploring the sights of Jaipur; Graham has come to find the Indian boy who was his lover when they were in school together; Muriel overcomes her racism and becomes friends with her doctor and the hotel maid; Madge looks for a rich husband by trying to pass as Princess Margaret; Norman, trying to pick up well-to-do women, finds himself being introduced to 'Princess margaret.""  And the irrepressible Sunny attempts to save his hotel from his greedy brothers, who want to tear it down, and his love for a local girl from his mother, who wants an arranged marriage.The manner in which the characters explore their own lives while interacting with the others weaves a heartwarming tale of life and love, joy and despair.

In this movie, we watch the inner lives of several characters ""of a certain age"" unfold and expand. With the bloom of youth past, retirement upon them and circumstances inducing radical change, all of them decide to retire in India at the Marigold Hotel. When they arrive, they find that the hotel isn't the luxurious retreat for the elderly that was described in the brochures that led them there. It is not without its charms, however, and the manner in which the retirees meet both the good and the bad of their new home lays the groundwork for their blended individual stories. The dialogue is excellent, the cast and the acting is brilliant, and the message is hopeful without violating believability. Baby boomers will see themselves in one or more of the characters' situations, and they will come away from the film with a renewed sense of hope and worth.The film's perspective on two ways to grow older is beautifully executed. Not all the characters ""make it."" Given the same opportunity for adjustment and change as their companions, a couple of them cannot forgive, hope or move forward. Others, however, find a new beginning by embracing change and welcoming a future which is completely different from the past they left behind.In all, the movie is provocative. It is funny, sad, engaging and substantive. A refreshing change from saccharine happily-ever-after or hopeless all-is-doomed films, this is a thinker's must-see for people in their sixties and a please-see for the young.

Apparently local taste does not run to British verbal humor and charm; around here, the market is for anything animated, films where humans are killed or dismembered and the understated subtlety of Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies. Of course, the lack of an audience for Indo-British films might be because we have no Indians and only two British-born inhabitants (I am one of the Brits). I'm sure others living in rural areas have found the same. I eventually caught the movie on a long plane trip and was happy to while away the hours in the company of Maggie Smith, Judy Dench and co. As all travelers will know, planes aren't the ideal venue for movies, given the ambient noise, the person in the next seat wanting to use the restroom and the delivery of meals at the most crucial points in the plot, so I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD at home.I did see and hear enough to know that this is a charming film. The British members of the cast, all well-seasoned veterans of many movies and TV series, play their parts convincingly and with relish, especially the inimitable Dame Maggie Smith. Such is the stock of mature British actors that a whole genre of film-making (Old Britcoms) would be possible and would find a ready audience among baby-boomers. However, the movie was raised out of the ordinary for me by a marvelous performance by Dev Patel, the young Indian actor, whose boundless energy, infectious enthusiasm and never-say-die attitude give the film a wonderfully uplifting mood.I can't say this movie has caused me to want to move to Jaipur (even at Sonny's prices), although I am fast approaching the age when a move might be on the cards, but if he ever decides to open a sister hotel in this area, I'll be checking it out.

The marketing had led me to think this was a comedy about a handful of older Brits who moved to India and then experienced culture shock in a slapstick way.  To be honest, with such a scenario I wouldn't have gotten this film at all were it not for the cast.  I am such a huge fan of all of these actors, so I figured anything with Judy Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith was worth seeing - no matter how lame the material.  Was I ever wrong about the material and the story!This is an incredible film about re-purposing one's life, about taking risks and making changes no matter what age and about that even when things don't turn out as expected, often better things come instead.Set in India, the film is so visually stunning and I loved the soundtrack so much, I ordered that too.  Most important, it deals with change, with loss, with acceptance, with redemption and forgiveness, with holding on to what matters and letting go to what doesn't.  The trick, of course, is for each viewer to figure out those in his/her own life.  Each of the characters in this film must figure these out too.

Where most, at their age, would be content with the idea of living out the rest of their days in the same place they've always been, they decide otherwise. Many different people - with even more different and sometimes contrasting, lives and lifestyles - leave everything they've ever known, for a whole new world, they know nothing about. But, who could resist the beautiful and exotic rest haven offered in the Marigold brochure?? Arriving at their new abode, only to find it run down and in need of major repairs, they realized that the motel was the only first, of many, newly acquired impositions. Forced to share their environment, their opposing characters clash with some, find solace in others and, in the end, find that they are not so entirely different from the others, as originally believed. Surprisingly, the biggest difference was from within! And, witnessing the young owner's struggle to achieve his dreams of not only success, but love, brings forth the vitality they hadn't had since their youth, further allowing them to dream, to believe, to fight, to love........

1499052,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005S9EJ14,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is proof positive that you don't need all the things Hollywood thinks you do to make a great movie. You don't need naked actors, explosions, violence or nubile young starlets. When you make a movie with heart, with feeling and emotion, you make something that can stand the test of time rather than just the number of weeks it can hold a top spot on the charts.The plot behind the story involves a number of elderly Brits who for one reason or another find themselves seeking a different means of living on what little they have. Evelyn (Dame Judi Dench) has just lost her husband only to find he left her with enough debt that she must sell their flat. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge who decides the time is right to retire before he becomes the old fogey giving a boring retirement speech. Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are a retiring couple who may have lost everything investing in their daughter's internet company. Norman (Ronald Pickup) is an older gent wanting to feel young just one more time. Madge (Celia Imrie) is an woman searching for one last rich husband. And Muriel (Maggie Smith) is an elderly woman in need of a hip replacement who can either wait 6 months or get immediate attention in India, the location that all of these people decide to go to.Having read about the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel via brochure, they become traveling companions on their way to a new adventure. Unfortunately the hotel isn't quite what it pretended to be. Sonny (Dev Patel) is the son of the now deceased owner who is trying to make the hotel what his father once dreamed of. But rather than just becoming a place for tourist, the hotel caters to the elderly looking for a place to stay either short term or until the end. But none here are close to that, at least not in spirit.Each character has their own story. Evelyn is the center piece, giving us background as she starts a blog to let folks back home know of her adventures. She goes so far at to take a job helping a phone sales group understand how to talk to English people. Norman is there to rekindle something that happened in his past, something that happened in this very town.Douglas finds himself fascinated with the area and attempts to absorb each and every item he can see and experience. His wife Jean is just the opposite, choosing to stay in the hotel and complain about each and every thing that happens. She's an unhappy woman and lets everyone know about it. Madge and Norman both gravitate to the local posh club in town where they hope to meet someone and find their fortunes at getting lucky improve. Muriel is another complainer but hers is more along the lines of prejudices against the people of India that are based more on what she's heard than what she's experienced.Interwoven in the guests stories is that of Sonny who has chosen to make his father's dream come true. In love with a local girl that his mother decides is unsuitable for him to marry; he must either decide to follow his heart or his family.The movie moves along at an even pace, never rushing through one story or another and blending each of them together smoothly rather than place each in a time limit only to go to the next. Even though they all have their tale to tell, the fact that they've chosen to become best friends (in some cases eventually) shows who these people are. And while their trip to this country at first seemed due to a case of need, they soon find themselves enchanted by the area they've chosen as their new home.The sights and sounds of India are on display here from moment to moment. Not just the grand and glorious colors and images that seem beautiful but the poorer sections as well. This feels more like the real India and not just a travelogue showing us the best. And the characters experience it just as much as the viewer.The idea of getting older, of not knowing what your future holds or how long you have to enjoy that future is what makes this film work. We're presented with different ways of looking at life here, good and bad, and how the characters choose what path to take. The acting is superb but why wouldn't it be with the talent pool collected here. Not one actor slips or slides in this film where each shines instead.It's time for a feel good movie. And this one suits that need. It won't have you sitting on the edge of your seat, but it will hold your attention from start to finish. And perhaps when it ends, you'll hope that your life comes to the same wonderful world that these folks enjoy.",4,AS YOUNG AS YOU FEEL,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,4557,"['BEST', 'EXOTIC', 'MARIGOLD', 'HOTEL', 'proof', 'positive', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'things', 'Hollywood', 'thinks', 'do', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'naked', 'actors', 'explosions', 'violence', 'nubile', 'young', 'starlets', 'When', 'make', 'movie', 'heart', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'make', 'something', 'can', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'rather', 'just', 'number', 'weeks', 'can', 'hold', 'top', 'spot', 'charts.The', 'plot', 'story', 'number', 'elderly', 'Brits', 'who', 'one', 'reason', 'find', 'seeking', 'different', 'means', 'living', 'what', 'little', 'have', 'Evelyn', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'just', 'lost', 'husband', 'only', 'find', 'left', 'enough', 'debt', 'must', 'sell', 'flat', 'Graham', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'judge', 'who', 'time', 'right', 'retire', 'old', 'fogey', 'giving', 'boring', 'retirement', 'speech', 'Douglas', 'Jean', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'are', 'retiring', 'couple', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'everything', 'investing', 'daughter', 'internet', 'company', 'Norman', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'older', 'gent', 'wanting', 'feel', 'young', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Madge', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'woman', 'searching', 'one', 'last', 'rich', 'husband', 'Muriel', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'elderly', 'woman', 'need', 'hip', 'replacement', 'who', 'can', 'either', 'wait', '6', 'months', 'get', 'immediate', 'attention', 'India', 'location', 'people', 'decide', 'go', 'to.Having', 'read', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'brochure', 'become', 'traveling', 'companions', 'way', 'new', 'adventure', 'Unfortunately', 'hotel', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'pretended', 'be', 'Sonny', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'son', 'now', 'deceased', 'owner', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'hotel', 'what', 'father', 'once', 'dreamed', 'rather', 'just', 'becoming', 'place', 'tourist', 'hotel', 'caters', 'elderly', 'looking', 'place', 'stay', 'either', 'short', 'term', 'end', 'none', 'here', 'are', 'close', 'least', 'not', 'spirit.Each', 'character', 'own', 'story', 'Evelyn', 'center', 'piece', 'giving', 'blog', 'let', 'folks', 'back', 'home', 'know', 'adventures', 'so', 'far', 'take', 'job', 'helping', 'phone', 'sales', 'group', 'understand', 'how', 'talk', 'English', 'people', 'Norman', 'there', 'rekindle', 'something', 'happened', 'past', 'something', 'happened', 'very', 'town.Douglas', 'fascinated', 'area', 'attempts', 'absorb', 'item', 'can', 'see', 'experience', 'wife', 'Jean', 'just', 'opposite', 'choosing', 'stay', 'hotel', 'complain', 'thing', 'unhappy', 'woman', 'everyone', 'know', 'Madge', 'Norman', 'gravitate', 'local', 'posh', 'club', 'town', 'where', 'hope', 'meet', 'someone', 'find', 'fortunes', 'getting', 'lucky', 'improve', 'Muriel', 'complainer', 'hers', 'more', 'lines', 'prejudices', 'people', 'India', 'are', 'based', 'more', 'what', 'heard', 'what', 'experienced.Interwoven', 'guests', 'stories', 'Sonny', 'who', 'chosen', 'make', 'father', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'love', 'local', 'girl', 'mother', 'decides', 'unsuitable', 'marry', 'must', 'either', 'decide', 'follow', 'heart', 'family.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'even', 'pace', 'never', 'rushing', 'one', 'story', 'blending', 'together', 'smoothly', 'rather', 'place', 'time', 'limit', 'only', 'go', 'next', 'Even', 'have', 'tale', 'tell', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'cases', 'eventually', 'shows', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'trip', 'country', 'first', 'seemed', 'due', 'case', 'need', 'soon', 'find', 'enchanted', 'area', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'new', 'home.The', 'sights', 'sounds', 'India', 'are', 'display', 'here', 'moment', 'moment', 'Not', 'just', 'grand', 'glorious', 'colors', 'images', 'seem', 'beautiful', 'poorer', 'sections', 'well', 'more', 'real', 'India', 'not', 'just', 'travelogue', 'showing', 'best', 'characters', 'experience', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'viewer.The', 'idea', 'getting', 'older', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'future', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'enjoy', 'future', 'what', 'film', 'work', ""'re"", 'presented', 'different', 'ways', 'looking', 'life', 'here', 'good', 'bad', 'how', 'characters', 'choose', 'what', 'path', 'take', 'acting', 'superb', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'talent', 'pool', 'collected', 'here', 'Not', 'one', 'actor', 'slides', 'film', 'where', 'instead.It', 'time', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'suits', 'need', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'perhaps', 'when', ""'ll"", 'hope', 'life', 'same', 'wonderful', 'world', 'folks', 'enjoy']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

As a reviewer you just never know what you are going to get. My expectations are never high and I love being pleasantly surprised.  This movie surprised me!Storyline by Maria We meet all of our players at the beginning and find out why all these people will be heading to India to live out their golden years. Whether it is because they are newly widowed, looking for something new, receiving a hip replacement or a slew of other reasons they all meet at the airport and our story begins..The hotel isn't quite what they expected and is run by a young entrepreneur named Sonny played by Dev Patel. Sonny has a vision and explains to his mother that he is ""outsourcing old age"" because ""there are many countries where they don't like old people"".My favorite quote from the movie comes from Sonny who is always optimistic; ""Everything will always be alright in the end and if it is not alright than trust me, it is not yet the end.""Actors: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson are wonderful! Judi Dench as Evelyn the widowing who is trying to find herself, gets a job and enjoys the beauty around her. Loved her character. Oh and Maggie Smith as the prejudice Muriel, is one feisty spitfire.Location: I loved it! From overcrowded buses, rickshaws, mopeds, and colorful clothing and buildings.

It isn't challenging in the slightest, which has caused many critics to downgrade it, or damn it with faint praise. All I know is that the audience in the packed theater where I saw the film applauded at the end, and I applauded with them.By now everyone knows the story of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" A group of English retirees decides for various reasons (mostly financial) to move to India. The retirement hotel they choose sounds glorious from the brochure, but turns out to be a rundown, if once-grand, hulk run by a young Indian with much more enthusiasm than skill. A lot of comedy ensues, and a little conflict and tragedy; attitudes are changed, old bonds broken, and new bonds forged.The ensemble cast of British character actors ranges among the super-famous (Judi Dench, Maggie Smith), the moderately famous (Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) and the not-so-famous (Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie), with the addition of one young rising star (Dev Patel, of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame). All of them are as charming, funny and touching as they possibly could be. Meanwhile, Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker do an excellent job of blending and articulating the various plotlines, aided by the gorgeous photography by Ben Davis and the insinuating score by Thomas Newman. Considering the effort all these master professionals made to give an audience a good time, it seems churlish to give ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" any less than five stars.",5,A thoroughly delightful film.,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1633,"['John', 'Madden', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'beginning', 'end', ""n't"", 'challenging', 'slightest', 'caused', 'many', 'critics', 'downgrade', 'damn', 'faint', 'praise', 'know', 'audience', 'packed', 'theater', 'where', 'saw', 'film', 'applauded', 'end', 'applauded', 'them.By', 'now', 'everyone', 'story', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'group', 'English', 'retirees', 'decides', 'various', 'reasons', 'mostly', 'financial', 'move', 'India', 'retirement', 'hotel', 'choose', 'sounds', 'glorious', 'brochure', 'out', 'be', 'rundown', 'once-grand', 'hulk', 'run', 'young', 'Indian', 'much', 'more', 'enthusiasm', 'skill', 'lot', 'comedy', 'ensues', 'little', 'conflict', 'tragedy', 'attitudes', 'are', 'changed', 'old', 'bonds', 'broken', 'new', 'bonds', 'forged.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'super-famous', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'moderately', 'famous', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'not-so-famous', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'addition', 'one', 'young', 'rising', 'star', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'fame', 'are', 'charming', 'funny', 'touching', 'possibly', 'could', 'be', 'Meanwhile', 'Madden', 'screenwriter', 'Ol', 'Parker', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'blending', 'articulating', 'various', 'plotlines', 'aided', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'Ben', 'Davis', 'insinuating', 'score', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'Considering', 'effort', 'master', 'professionals', 'made', 'give', 'audience', 'good', 'time', 'churlish', 'give', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'less', 'five', 'stars']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

1499081,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005S9EJ14,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Stocked with a plethora of gifted British actors of a certain age, director John Madden produces a fine film full of color and life if a little short of substance.  Deborah Moggach's novel, adapted for the screen by Ol Parker, begins in England with a look at the various characters as they decide how to live out their retirement.  Most are on a limited budget so one option is a retirement home in Jaipur, India.  The on-line information suggests a modern upscale facility in what used to be a glamorous hotel.Judi Dench heads the cast as Evelyn Greenslade, recently widowed and on her own for the first time.  She also serves as the narrator, documenting her days in a journal.  The always fun to watch Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are a couple that you immediately wonder why they are together.  Tom Wilkinson is a closeted gay returning to the area where he spent his early adult years, looking for a former lover.  Maggie Smith is a racist grump looking for a cheap hip replacement.  There are others with their own backgrounds.  Then there is the young hotel manager (Dev Patel) whose modest ruse to lure residents has a noble purpose.Mixing this all up doesn't really deliver much in the way of originality, but watching these veteran actors interact is certainly fun and entertaining.  Madden's visuals are beautiful.  He mixes in the chaotic street life with the color and personalities of the Indian people.  While we can see where this is all going, the trip is enjoyable.The transfer to Blu ray is excellent.  As usualy it comes with a 1080p resolution and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  When our characters leave grey looking England and land in colorful India, the video display pops as well with an inundation of orange,green, pink, turquois.  The palet is clear and crisp.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio and is likewise excellent.  While the film is dialog heavy, there is enough music and street life to keep the surrounds busy.  Car horns, trains and planes send plenty of information to keep the viewer centered in the story.

Probably many others, but this one is a treat!This is a great British film, although the British have many great films in comedy and drama, this takes the cake! It is a great film about a group of Brits that go to India for different reasons!Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a widow and seeks not only to take care of the debts left to her by her now-passed on husband, but she decides that maybe she might like it in India and might want to work there!Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge, decides to retire in India, and he wants to look for an old friend he knew since childhood and meet up with him again.Jean (Penelope Wilton) and Douglas (Bill Nighy)  are wanting to retire in India, although as the story comes along Jean hates it there and Douglas is just happy to be there because it's different, its new and it's wonderful to him!While single mom Madge (Celia Imrie) goes there to find another husband, another singleton on the trip Norman (Ronald Pickup)  is going there to feel young again...yes feel young again, and not in the way you might want to think either.Muriel (Maggie Smith), a retired housekeeper who is in great physical pain,  goes to India to seek a less expensive service of doing it.  However, Muriel has some issues with Indians since she is so Anglo-centric in nature.Of course this is how the hotel comes into play!  There is a side story about the hotel owner named Sonny (Dev Patel), who does all he can to keep the hotel and convince the group Brits and everyone else that it's a great hotel!  He also plans to keep the heart of his beloved girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae) even though his mother and her brother prefer it not be that way!The story has a wonderful plot, a lot of funny parts, and a lot of sad ones too.

1499097,A1W3S1TDCURM3L,B005S9EJ14,My Three Cents,"[2, 2]","What a marvelous, sensitive and humorous movie this was!  Well cast and perfect character portrayals.  A loving chronicle of a group of ""mature"" people (Give us a break!  I'm almost 78 and HATE to be called ""old"" because that's not how I feel or believe I am inside!).  The group finally welds together at a run down, barely there hotel in Jaipur, India.  Each character is taking a shot at trying to make right their struggles with a physical handicap, a partner who disapproves of everyone and everything (especially her mate), widowhood, a former lover, a femme fatale whose ""attributes"" have spread out, fallen down and are misfiring, and a man in desperate need of Viagra to fulfill his fantasy as a ""stud-still-in-residence""! Young love is struggling too, as the ambitious young owner of the hotel loves a young woman whose family couldn't be more disapproving (not to mention his own interfering obnoxious mother); he's trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by making a success out of the seemingly doomed hotel he loves and wants to reinvent.  He is obstinately refusing to recognize that his hotel can't even provide basic amenities for current guests and hardly encourages future patronage - if it survives that long!  The sights and sounds of Jaipur are colorful, noisy, and make your senses reel and jump for joy.  Life is so different in Jaipur and it is unlike anything any of the group have experienced before, except for one group member, a former resident of Jaipur, looking for a lost love from years ago through circumstances that will bring you to tears.  This group overcomes prejudice, physical and mental disabilities, uncomfortable surroundings and chronicles inconveniences unimaginable under most normal circumstances.  The guests find a welcome release from the tedium of life they have been drowning in as well as a renewal of their internal juices and bright hope for their futures by new surroundings, strange food, customs and dress, and the freedom from fear of harsh censure by finally expressing their personal likes and dislikes; they also discover a new way they can live out the remainder of their lives under better, warmer and more loving circumstances.  Whew!  All that said, I encourage everyone (not just ""mature"" viewers) to see this movie.  If you're young or middle-aged, you might get a new perception of what lies ahead for you; you may learn how you can get a jump on those bumps in the road that may occur.  Know this for sure:  As long as you're still kicking you can change yourself or your circumstances if you set your minds and hearts to do so (except getting rid of arthritic pain and body parts that won't work the way they used to when you were younger [Oh!

Most older people have had enough tragedies in their real lives not to need to see others suffer for entertainment. Real life almost never lives up to the promises and we are lucky if we end up somewhere that is at least interesting and interested in improvement. So even with the cliched characters, unlikely coincidences and improbably timed events it is a pleasure to watch this group struggle to deal with the situation as it is. Even the inevitable death is well timed to avoid complications.This movie has hardly left my DVD player since I bought it a few days ago. I have researched locations and the ages of the actors online and watched Evil Under the Sun where a younger Maggie Smith plays a very different type of innkeeper. So I had to give it 5 stars even though I recognize the flaws. There are a few places that I now skip over and others that always amuse me. I recommend pausing the DVD to check out the ""Have you lost your vigor"" poster in the clinic when Norman goes to get a little help. When Sunaina suggests to Evelyn that she imagine her listeners naked I am inclined to suspect that I would be unable to speak because I would be staring at her brother Jay (Sid Makeer) with my mouth open.If there is a cliche that irritates me here it is the idea that one must have a lover to be happy. This is exemplified when Madge Hardcastle confides that she is afraid that she is no longer attractive to men and ""what else is there""? The answer is ""lots of things"". This may be why several people have found the characters of Madge and Norman less satisfying than the ones who have other interests.

You go to India, of course. It's affordable, exotic and a great place in which to find yourself. Lured by advertisements and bolstered with visions of a life of leisure, an eclectic group of British retirees arrives to find the Marigold Hotel a mere shell of its former glory. And though their living situation is less than expected, they are all profoundly affected by the experience of living in this foreign new land. In their own way, each of them walks a veritable path of self discovery and learns that life and love can begin anew even when you think you're way past your prime.I rented The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel on a whim and I'm glad that I did. Based off a popular novel of the same name, the movie tells the story of several cash-poor English retirees who travel to India looking for sex, love, rebirth, closure and/or adventure. Naturally, things go awry for the bunch starting with their arrival at the less than desirable Marigold Hotel. But through a series of follies, trials and adventures the gang grows closer to one another and they manage to learn a valuable lesson in the process: it's never too late to seek out new beginnings. Played by the creme de la creme of British acting royalty, the cast of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, inspires and dazzles.Dame Maggie Smith plays the feisty and untouchable xenophobe, Muriel, who comes to India unwillingly to receive a hip replacement. If there's one thing Dame Smith can play, it's surly and she does so with a wryness and bitterness that is both sad and cheeky at the same time. And what makes her so lovable is not only the humour behind her situation, but the redemption that comes along with it. Actually, this goes for all of the cast. Then we have Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton as your testy, argumentative old couple. Nighy is open, he's an explorer whereas Wilton is unwilling and set in her ways. They come face to face with a drastic decision regarding the nature of their marriage. Tom Wilkinson, as Graham Dashwood, comes to India looking for his long-lost love. Then there's Dame Judi Dench as our main narrator, Evelyn Greenslade. She goes to India after the death of her husband seeking closure but really as more of an escape. What she finds, however, is a fresh start and a new outlook on life.Most of the action centers in and around the Marigold Hotel with Dev Patel playing its struggling manager, Sonny Kapoor. Every time he takes the screen, he steals the scenes with his fervent hope and optimism. Perhaps what I love the most, though, is that India itself is another prime character of the film. We're given a bird's eye view of the vibrancy of Jaipur from the crowded streets to the colourful markets and the serene customs. It's a whimsical and refreshing vacation folding out right in front of your eyes. I think what makes the setting stand out so much is the allusion created using the stark contrast between the India's progression and the old colonial habits of the British characters living there.  It's poignant and powerful.My only real issues with the movie are that there's a number of cast members and story lines to follow and it can be a bit to keep up with. And it's inevitable that you are eventually going to connect with some of them more than others. I won't deny, the movie can at times, be a tad predictable especially near the end. You kind of know that everything is going to be wrapped up in a perfect little bow despite the issues that have arisen. But that's okay because it's supposed to be a feel-good kinda film and if there's one thing this movie has, great acting talent aside, it's heart. There's nothing more perfect than that because we all know, all's well that ends well, right?Food for Thought: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a sweet, irreverent, cheeky film featuring some of the greatest British actors of our time. While it can be a bit predictable at times, the movie's ultimate message is an endearing one that speaks to the heart. This isn't just a film for folks in their golden years, it's one of those powerful movies that can be enjoyed by adults of all ages because the themes are super relatablel. This movie will make you laugh and cry, smile and admire. And if anything, you'll be in a state of wanderlust for quite some time.",4,"A Sweet, Irreverent, Cheeky British Film",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,4487,"['Where', 'do', 'go', 'when', ""'re"", 'elderly', 'still', 'have', 'desire', 'adventure', 'are', 'need', 'cheap', 'medical', 'treatment', 'and/or', 'left', 'other', 'place', 'go', 'native', 'homeland', 'far', 'too', 'expensive', 'go', 'India', 'course', 'affordable', 'exotic', 'great', 'place', 'find', 'Lured', 'advertisements', 'bolstered', 'visions', 'life', 'leisure', 'eclectic', 'group', 'British', 'retirees', 'find', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'mere', 'shell', 'former', 'glory', 'living', 'situation', 'less', 'expected', 'are', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'experience', 'living', 'foreign', 'new', 'land', 'own', 'way', 'walks', 'veritable', 'path', 'self', 'discovery', 'life', 'love', 'can', 'begin', 'anew', 'even', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'way', 'prime.I', 'rented', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'whim', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Based', 'off', 'popular', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'story', 'several', 'cash-poor', 'English', 'retirees', 'who', 'travel', 'India', 'looking', 'sex', 'love', 'rebirth', 'closure', 'and/or', 'adventure', 'Naturally', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'bunch', 'starting', 'arrival', 'less', 'desirable', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'series', 'follies', 'trials', 'gang', 'closer', 'one', 'manage', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'process', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'seek', 'out', 'new', 'beginnings', 'Played', 'creme', 'la', 'creme', 'British', 'acting', 'royalty', 'cast', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'inspires', 'dazzles.Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'feisty', 'untouchable', 'xenophobe', 'Muriel', 'who', 'India', 'unwillingly', 'receive', 'hip', 'replacement', 'one', 'thing', 'Dame', 'Smith', 'can', 'play', 'surly', 'so', 'wryness', 'bitterness', 'sad', 'cheeky', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'so', 'lovable', 'not', 'only', 'humour', 'situation', 'redemption', 'along', 'Actually', 'cast', 'Then', 'have', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'testy', 'argumentative', 'old', 'couple', 'Nighy', 'open', 'explorer', 'Wilton', 'unwilling', 'set', 'ways', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'drastic', 'decision', 'regarding', 'nature', 'marriage', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Graham', 'Dashwood', 'India', 'looking', 'long-lost', 'love', 'Then', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'main', 'narrator', 'Evelyn', 'Greenslade', 'India', 'death', 'husband', 'seeking', 'closure', 'really', 'more', 'escape', 'What', 'however', 'fresh', 'start', 'new', 'outlook', 'life.Most', 'action', 'centers', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'playing', 'struggling', 'manager', 'Sonny', 'Kapoor', 'Every', 'time', 'screen', 'scenes', 'fervent', 'hope', 'optimism', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'love', 'most', 'though', 'India', 'prime', 'character', 'film', ""'re"", 'given', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'vibrancy', 'Jaipur', 'crowded', 'streets', 'colourful', 'markets', 'serene', 'customs', 'whimsical', 'refreshing', 'vacation', 'folding', 'out', 'right', 'front', 'eyes', 'think', 'what', 'setting', 'stand', 'so', 'much', 'allusion', 'created', 'using', 'stark', 'contrast', 'India', 'progression', 'old', 'colonial', 'habits', 'British', 'characters', 'living', 'there', 'poignant', 'only', 'real', 'issues', 'movie', 'are', 'number', 'cast', 'members', 'story', 'lines', 'follow', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'keep', 'up', 'inevitable', 'are', 'eventually', 'going', 'connect', 'more', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'movie', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'tad', 'predictable', 'especially', 'end', 'kind', 'know', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'perfect', 'little', 'bow', 'issues', 'have', 'arisen', 'okay', 'supposed', 'be', 'feel-good', 'kinda', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'aside', 'heart', 'nothing', 'more', 'perfect', 'know', 'well', 'well', 'right', 'Food', 'Thought', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'sweet', 'irreverent', 'cheeky', 'film', 'featuring', 'greatest', 'British', 'actors', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'predictable', 'times', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'message', 'endearing', 'one', 'heart', ""n't"", 'just', 'film', 'folks', 'golden', 'years', 'one', 'powerful', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'adults', 'ages', 'themes', 'are', 'super', 'relatablel', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'smile', 'admire', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'be', 'state', 'wanderlust', 'quite', 'time']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It's not a great film -- a couple of the plot elements don't work or aren't developed, and I found Dev Patel's character as annoying as he was endearing. But it's a very good movie nonetheless. It left me smiling. Perhaps it was my weakness for grand old hotels, even when they're in a state of shabbiness, and for out-of-the-way places; the movie captures India in all its chaos and color. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel follows a group of aging Brits as they try a low-budget retirement in a run-down Indian hotel. The acting is first rate. I'm used to seeing Judi Dench playing formidable characters, perhaps because of her role in the latest James Bond flicks. Here, it's a pleasure to see her on a very human scale as a recent widow, struggling to build a new life, relying on her basic optimism and humanity to see her through. Bill Nighy I associate with somewhat satanic characters. Here he's great as a bumbling, funny, good-hearted ex-civil servant adjusting as best he can to a modest retirement. Tom Wilkinson is wonderful as a high-ranking judge who returns to India to find a lost love and perhaps make amends for the past.

1499192,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005S9EJ14,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel(released Feb/12)stars some impressive British acting talent,such as Judi Dench as Evelyn Greenslade,Bill Nighy as Douglas Ainslie,Celia Imrie as Madge Hardcastle,Penelope Wilton as Jean Ainslie,Maggie Smith as Muriel Donnelly,Tom Wilkinson as Graham Dashwood,Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins,along with others.These talents alone would have assured success in any film they all appeared in at once,but the film almost derails itself with a sub plot of love between the hotel owner Sonny and his girlfriend,who must stand up to his domineering mother,and all the little nuances each character brings to the table,and which must be pieced together and tied up in the end.As the film rolls along we get an endless hopping from one person to the next and when any of the stellar British actors are not on screen,things tend to get slightly tepid.However the film finally manages to pull the entire story together in the end,as bitter sweet as it is.The story finds one couple and five singles,going to a hotel in India,as the brochures of it look mighty appealing.Each one has their own travails and reasons for going.For the Ainslies,the husband had invested their entire retirement savings on his daughter's internet company,for start up funds,which has gone nowhere fast.With funds short,they decide to vacation at the Exotic Marigold.Evelyn is a widow which must sell her flat to pay her late hubby's bills.With what's left she decides to vacation.Madge is a single lady who is out looking for a mate,and decides India might be the change she needs.Muriel is in need of a hip replacement and the hotel is used to put her up as she convalesces.Graham is a newly retired judge who is sick and returns to the land he knew many years before.And finally Norman is an old bachelor looking for that one last good fling.When the group arrives,they discover the hotel is a decrepit old thing run by a young man named Sonny,who took it over from his late father.Sonny is constantly looking for a cash influx to expand,but cannot get the backing of a local businessman.On top of this his love life is combative:with his mother.She wants an arranged marriage whereas he loves another girl and wants to marry her.Muriel is a crotchety old bird and at first talks very little to anyone.After her hip replacement she becomes friendly with one of the hotel servants and the film expands on their relationship.Mrs.Ainslie is a moaning Minnie to everyone within ear shot.She gets a crush on ex judge Graham but it becomes unfulfilled as Graham it turns out is gay.Evelyn gets a job in a local call center teaching the employees how to properly deal with English customers;which she loves.Both Madge and Norman both hunt for that certain love affair,with totally different tacks.The ex judge,seeks out and finds an old friend who he was closerthanthis with years before and they reunite.When the film starts its descent towards the finale we find Sonny standing up to his mother and vowing to marry his sweetheart,as,it turns out,his father did for his own mother years before.Madge and Norman each find love in their own respective styles and stay on.Mrs.Ainslie finally leaves the hotel when her daughter sends some unexpected funds to them.Their marriage was on the rocks anyways and while she departs,he instead stays on.Douglas and Evelyn created a connection during their time together and he returns to her and asks her on a date.Muriel has been a busy beaver and has looked into the viability of the hotel,which Sonny's mother wanted to close.Muriel instead says the property is viable and sets about co-managing it with Sonny and it prospers.Finally,and unfortunately,Graham had a bad ticker and passes away after his reunion with his old and dear friend.His friend gives him a proper Hindu funeral.The film has seven people,eight if you count Sonny,all with problems and travails to work out.That is alot of detail to introduce,tell and properly wrap up all within the just over two hour time frame.And as I said,when this great cast of veterans isn't on the screen,the movie slows down,as good as the Indian cast is.So what could/should have been a top notch character study film,almost gets derailed because of the amount it has to tell and the way it is ultimately told(edited).Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.The extras are two 2-3 minute glorified trailers on the film and commentary.All in all this film is a film that should have been better than it was,but it just had too much to tell and wrap up.The British cast was nothing short of marvelous,but even they couldn't propel the film any higher because of the aforementioned faults.3-3 1/2 stars.",3,"With a cast like this,how can you go wrong?",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,4725,"['Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'released', 'Feb/12', 'impressive',

The story is about seven retirement-age Brits, each for reasons of his or her own decide to answer an ad and relocate to India, to the posh/upscale (yet very affordable) Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which has been specifically geared for retirees.There is Graham (Tom Wilkinson), on a mission to find a lost love; Doug and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton), who have lost most of their money in a bad investment in their daughter's online company; Muriel (Maggie Smith), a grouchy bigot who needs hip replacement surgery and can only get it right away in India; Evelyn (Judi Dench), a widow who feels she's lost her place in the world; Madge (Celia Imrie), on the hunt for a rich husband; and Norman (Ronald Pickup), the eternal skirt chaser who still fancies himself a ladies man even in his ""golden years"".All seven meet on the way to India, and upon arrival realize that the hotel depicted in the ads/brochure is by far NOT the rundown, shabby, badly-in-need of repair former palace that lies before them - run by Sonny (the ever-brilliant Dev Patel), who has so much energy and so much heart, and is determined to do everything he can to get the money needed so he can restore the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (""Now with Guests!"" as the sign he soon puts out front reads) back to its former glory.India, depicted as a patchwork of sound and noise and people - lots and LOTS of people - affects each of the seniors in a different way.  But each of them IS affected, most of them deeply, and the film is not only a love letter to India but also a love letter to the human spirit that lives - and can be rekindled - in us all, no matter how old we are or how far withdrawn from life we feel we've become.

1499267,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B005S9EJ14,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" (2011), is a feel-good comedy/drama, that, in its 124 minute running time, packs in a bunch of older British stars and a lot of India.  It was directed by John Madden,(Shakespeare In Love) written for the screen by Ol Parker, based on the novel THESE FOOLISH THINGS by Deborah Moggach.  It appears to be an Anglo-Indian production.Seven British retirees, for various reasons that mainly boil down to finances and how much cheaper it is to live in India than the United Kingdom, decide to outsource their golden days. They trundle off to Jaipur to take up residence in what the internet has led them to believe is a newly restored luxury hotel.  However, they find the place has been Photoshopped, and is not yet ready for prime time.  But India and the hotel soon begin to exercise their charm on the seniors.The film stars Dame Judi Dench (Her Majesty, Mrs Brown), as Evelyn Greenslade, widowed housewife; Tom Wilkinson, who played Mr. Dashwood in the 1995 version ofSense and Sensibility (1995),  plays Graham Dashwood, retired judge. Bill Nighy (Love Actually) is Douglas Ainslie, henpecked former civil servant; Penelope Wilton,(Downton Abbey: Season 2) is Jean Ainslie, Douglas's fearsome wife; Dame Maggie Smith, (DOWNTON ABBEY), is Muriel Donnelly, unhappy and angry former housekeeper to a wealthy family, and a racist--but a funny one--to boot.  Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) plays Sonny Kapoor, manager of the hotel; the lovely and charming Tena Desae, who, however, is not the lovely and charming Freida Pinto from SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, plays his girlfriend Sunaina.  Then there's Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins, who hopes there's some life in the old boy yet, and Celia Imre as Madge Hardcastle, widowed housewife, who definitely thinks there's some life in the old girl yet, and hopes it's enough to land one last husband, hopefully a wealthy one.  According to IMDb, Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole were first cast as the latter two characters.  Imre and Pickup do fine jobs, but Christie and O'Toole are long time favorites of mine, and I can only imagine what the film might have been like with those two formerly-cast actors in the parts.  Oh well...Aside from a few opening scenes presumably set in the U.K., most of the film seems to have been made on location in India, and it does a good job of giving us that country's flora, fauna, and social ways, its bustle and optimism.  However, it barely touches on the problems of that immense country; guess you can't expect a feel-good comedy to do that. Never mind, while Jean Ainslie readsTulip Fever, another novel by author Moggach now in development to film, her husband Douglas, and most of the other characters - and the viewers with them-- begin to explore the dynamic city in which they find themselves.

Swan ""com prof""","[0, 0]","The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a thoroughly enjoy flick with solid ccting, especially Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, and Maggie Smith. The storyline is also pretty believable as more Brits and Americans look beyond their home counties to find a place to retire that is actually affordable. The screen writers capture a range of characters and reactions -- and show the growth of the characters over time, allowing viewers to identify with the pain, confusion, and sometimes anger of coping with culture shock and with the shock of finding one's self at a new stage in life when everything they knew and counted on has changed. The depiction of India is somewhat stereotyped, but no more than would be expected as the background for any 2 hr film and the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sound, the crowdedness, and the exotica of a wholly unknown culture fairly realistic. (I also just LOVE that for once one of the romantic couples is cast with the female actor quite a bit older than the male instead of the other way around -- rather than introduce a spoiler, I'll just say that this couple includes Judi Dench.) It's about time that film makers realized that literate films with older actors in a storyline that nature audiences can identify with can result in a engaging film and appeal to a broad audience -- the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a winner.",4,Thoroughly enjoyable,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,1360,"['Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'flick', 'solid', 'ccting', 'especially', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'storyline', 'also', 'pretty', 'believable', 'more', 'Brits', 'Americans', 'look', 'home', 'counties', 'find', 'place', 'retire', 'actually', 'affordable', 'screen', 'writers', 'capture', 'range', 'characters', 'reactions', 'show', 'growth', 'characters', 'time', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'identify', 'pain', 'confusion', 'sometimes', 'anger', 'coping', 'culture', 'shock', 'shock', 'finding', 'one', 'self', 'new', 'stage', 'life', 'when', 'everything', 'knew', 'counted', 'changed', 'depiction', 'India', 'somewhat', 'stereotyped', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'background', '2', 'hr', 'film', 'feeling', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'sound', 'crowdedness', 'exotica', 'wholly', 'unknown', 'culture', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'also', 'just', 'LOVE', 'once', 'one', 'romantic', 'couples', 'cast', 'female', 'actor', 'quite', 'bit', 'older', 'male', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'rather', 'introduce', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'couple', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'time', 'film', 'makers', 'realized', 'literate', 'films', 'older', 'actors', 'storyline', 'nature', 'audiences', 'can', 'identify', 'can', 'result', 'engaging', 'film', 'appeal', 'broad', 'audience', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'winner']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

1499293,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B005S9EJ14,The Guardian,"[31, 38]","This film is not the first to employ the plot device of a bunch of ill-matched strangers thrown together with their individual stories, who develop self-knowledge through interaction with each other in a new environment. The setting here is contemporary Jaipur and the characters are a bunch of fish-out-of-water Brits in their twilight years; a new twist on the old storyline. So what's `The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' like as a viewing experience?The answer is generally good, with minor reservations. The Brit A-list cast of autumn-years players is made, either by skilled make-up or even more skilled close-up camerawork, to look - well, so old, especially when contrasted to the youthful dynamism of some of the Indian cast. Is this supposed to be a not-so-subtle metaphor about these two nations and their current global profiles?The Rajasthan locations are brought to life by superb camerawork and editing and a great eye for detail. The film captures Jaipur to perfection, though of course you don't get the overpowering olfactory cocktail of cattle, incense and spices, perfumes, diesel fumes and industrial pollution of modern India on film, nor the searing >40C dry heat in the summer.At times TBEMH has the feel of a Mike Lee film, with his technique of allowing the actors to determine story development by their own real-life interactions in front of the camera. At other times it's obviously scripted; funny, poignant and touching and occasionally a bit heavy-handed. The characters rather predictably develop, learn and change as they interact with India and with each other: some adapt to their new home like ducks to water and with a sense of adventure; others don't fare so well, and some take time to eventually feel at home. A sub-plot between the young, enthusiastic and eternally optimistic hotel manager (Dev Patel) and his pretty moped-riding, call-centre-employed girlfriend (Tena Desai) is used to explore the struggle between the new India with self-assertive young professionals living by western values and the traditional controlling influence of their Indian families. Unfortunately the confrontational resolution of this conflict will be seen by some viewers as melodramatic and trite - actually it's positively toe-curling, and that's all I'm going to say.Overall, not a bad film but short of excellent. See it for the veteran cast turning in some fine performances, a good-but-not-great script containing a few surprises amongst the clichs (street kids playing cricket, Indian university graduates working in call-centres, the iniquities of the Hindu caste system) and some great one-liners: an overall feel-good and life-affirming viewing experience set in stunning Jaipur locations.",3,A tried and tested storyline with a new twist,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2720,"['film', 'not', 'first', 'employ', 'plot', 'device', 'bunch', 'ill-matched', 'strangers', 'together', 'individual', 'stories', 'who', 'develop', 'self-knowledge', 'interaction', 'other', 'new', 'environment', 'setting', 'here', 'contemporary', 'Jaipur', 'characters', 'are', 'bunch', 'fish-out-of-water', 'Brits', 'twilight', 'years', 'new', 'twist', 'old', 'storyline', 'what', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'viewing', 'experience', 'answer', 'generally', 'good', 'minor', 'reservations', 'Brit', 'A-list', 'cast', 'autumn-years', 'players', 'made', 'either', 'skilled', 'make-up', 'even', 'more', 'skilled', 'close-up', 'camerawork', 'look', 'well', 'so', 'old', 'especially', 'when', 'contrasted', 'youthful', 'dynamism', 'Indian', 'cast', 'supposed', 'be', 'not-so-subtle', 'metaphor', 'two', 'nations', 'current', 'global', 'profiles', 'Rajasthan', 'locations', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'superb', 'camerawork', 'editing', 'great', 'eye', 'detail', 'film', 'Jaipur', 'perfection', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'overpowering', 'olfactory', 'cocktail', 'cattle', 'incense', 'spices', 'perfumes', 'diesel', 'fumes', 'industrial', 'pollution', 'modern', 'India', 'film', 'searing', '40C', 'dry', 'heat', 'summer.At', 'times', 'TBEMH', 'feel', 'Mike', 'Lee', 'film', 'technique', 'allowing', 'actors', 'determine', 'story', 'development', 'own', 'real-life', 'interactions', 'front', 'camera', 'other', 'times', 'obviously', 'scripted', 'funny', 'poignant', 'touching', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'characters', 'rather', 'predictably', 'develop', 'learn', 'change', 'interact', 'India', 'other', 'adapt', 'new', 'home', 'ducks', 'water', 'sense', 'adventure', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'take', 'time', 'eventually', 'feel', 'home', 'sub-plot', 'young', 'enthusiastic', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'pretty', 'moped-riding', 'call-centre-employed', 'girlfriend', 'Tena', 'Desai', 'used', 'explore', 'struggle', 'new', 'India', 'self-assertive', 'young', 'professionals', 'living', 'western', 'values', 'traditional', 'controlling', 'influence', 'Indian', 'families', 'Unfortunately', 'confrontational', 'resolution', 'conflict', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'viewers', 'melodramatic', 'trite', 'actually', 'positively', 'toe-curling', ""'m"", 'going', 'say.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'short', 'excellent', 'See', 'veteran', 'cast', 'turning', 'fine', 'performances', 'good-but-not-great', 'script', 'containing', 'few', 'surprises', 'amongst', 'clichs', 'street', 'kids', 'playing', 'cricket', 'Indian', 'university', 'working', 'call-centres', 'iniquities', 'Hindu', 'caste', 'system', 'great', 'one-liners', 'overall', 'feel-good', 'life-affirming', 'viewing', 'experience', 'set', 'stunning', 'Jaipur', 'locations']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Once in India and over the culture shock, our group start to adapt at different rates. Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) keeps an on-line blog about the events which adds some first person narration to the tale.In India, the scenes switch back and forth to the various guests' activities which intersect at times, similar to many indie movie scripts.

A group of English retirees decide to relocate to a seniors hotel in Darpur, India, to live a relaxing life of leisure.  Unfortunately, the hotel turns out to be a dive -- rundown, dreary, and depressing.The characters are a lot more colorful and interesting than the plot.  Tom Wilkinson plays gay magistrate Graham Dashwood, who has returned to India to find the boy he loved and left when he was young.  Bill Nighy is retired bureaucrat Douglas Ainslie with an irritating, constantly complaining wife (Penelope Wilton), whose savings have been lost by a daughter's careless investment.  Judi Dench is recent widow Evelyn Greenslade, who has never before looked after herself.  Maggie Smith is Muriel Donnelly, an unapologetic racist in need of a hip replacement.  And Celia Imrie is Madge Hardcastle, a gold digger still very much on the prowl.The film attempts to tell too many stories simultaneously, which gives it an overstuffed feel.  But it's unusual to have a movie these days reliant on Golden Agers, and it's a pleasure watching these superb actors sinking their teeth into sometimes underwritten characters and enlivening them with years of experience.Once the principal characters are assembled and disappointed by what they find, director John Madden provides their back stories.  There are many cliches and maybe too neat an ending, but the performances more than make up for the script's shortcomings.  Personally speaking, I would be happy to watch Maggie Smith peel an apple.  She is, at this point in her carrer, legendary and a master at her craft.Available on both DVD and Blu-ray, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel""  bonus extras consist of only behind-the-scenes footage and some location interviews.",3,Terrific Performances from a Great Cast,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,1827,"['Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'joy', 'who', 'love', 'veteran', 'thespians', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'up', 'storm', 'group', 'English', 'retirees', 'decide', 'relocate', 'seniors', 'hotel', 'Darpur', 'India', 'live', 'relaxing', 'life', 'leisure', 'Unfortunately', 'hotel', 'out', 'be', 'dive', 'rundown', 'dreary', 'depressing.The', 'characters', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'colorful', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'gay', 'magistrate', 'Graham', 'Dashwood', 'who', 'returned', 'India', 'find', 'boy', 'loved', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'retired', 'Douglas', 'Ainslie', 'irritating', 'constantly', 'complaining', 'wife', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'savings', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'daughter', 'careless', 'investment', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'recent', 'widow', 'Evelyn', 'Greenslade', 'who', 'never', 'before', 'looked', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Muriel', 'Donnelly', 'unapologetic', 'racist', 'need', 'hip', 'replacement', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'Madge', 'Hardcastle', 'gold', 'digger', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'prowl.The', 'film', 'attempts', 'tell', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'simultaneously', 'overstuffed', 'feel', 'unusual', 'have', 'movie', 'days', 'reliant', 'Golden', 'Agers', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'superb', 'actors', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'sometimes', 'underwritten', 'characters', 'enlivening', 'years', 'experience.Once', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'assembled', 'disappointed', 'what', 'find', 'director', 'John', 'Madden', 'back', 'stories', 'are', 'many', 'cliches', 'maybe', 'too', 'neat', 'ending', 'performances', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'script', 'shortcomings', 'Personally', 'speaking', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'watch', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'peel', 'apple', 'point', 'carrer', 'legendary', 'master', 'craft.Available', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'bonus', 'extras', 'consist', 'only', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'location', 'interviews']",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

1499299,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005S9EJ14,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 3]","Seven British seniors leave the familiarity of their homeland to immigrate to India. Some are lured by the ads for 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', offering an oasis for elderly inhabitants. Some are lured by memories of their youth. Some make the journey due to necessity.Written by Ol Parker and directed by John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Debt""), ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" features seven of the finest British actors working today in an amusing, insightful and only occasionally, predictable look at how their lives are changed by their move to the exotic former colony.Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) decides to make the move when her husband passes away leaving a mountain of debt. Her sons are trying to get her to move in with them, but Evelyn is too independent for that. Forced to sell the house and with little money, she spots an online ad for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and decides to move. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) can no longer stand the thought of living in England and leaves for the airport directly from his retirement party at the college where he teaches law. He is moving to India for an entirely different reason; as a young boy, his family lived in the area and he is looking up an old acquaintance. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) find they are now retired and have limited funds due to an ill-advised investment in their daughter's internet company. Rather than spend their golden years in a boxy flat designed for the elderly, complete with a panic button, Douglas convinces Jean that they should move to India. Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a bigoted old woman, finds she needs a hip replacement. Rather than spend six months or longer waiting for her name to come up on the National Health Service waiting list, she agrees to go to India for the surgery. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is a lech who finds his limited resources will go further in India as he tries to find an eligible, rich widower. Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) is basically the female equivalent of Norman, a woman who is using her limited resources to catch a rich widower. The British citizens meet at the airport and become traveling companions. Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel, ""Slumdog Millionaire"") greets his new guests with open arms. He is thrilled because they are his first guests and promise an income as he continues to prepare the hotel his deceased father bought for the guests. One day, he will be able to make it as nice as the brochure and website promise. He can now make his father's dream a reality, if only his older, more successful brothers and his mother would not interfere. The Brits find things are less than ready, less than hospitable. Some of them adapt and learn to enjoy their new lives. Some have more trouble.When you have this many characters in a film, it is often difficult for any of them to appear real or human. Often, they have one or two traits, one or two quirks and this is all the filmmakers are able to give them, so they become cartoon characters. ""The Best Exotic..."" should be applauded because it is much more successful, giving more of the characters real complexity. But a few of the characters do fall short.When your cast includes Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson, you would expect the film to be above the norm. And ""The Best Exotic..."" delivers. In fact, the characters played by these actors are the best of the bunch.Penelope Wilton's Jean is a bit too shrewish throughout, giving her character the least interesting growth. Because of this, she also makes Douglas (Nighy) the most predictable. But they have a nice, somewhat unexpected, moment towards the end of the film.Ronald Pickup's Norman and Celia Imrie's Madge are the most predictable and seem to be included for comic relief. Interestingly, I read that Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie were originally going to play these roles. I'm not sure why they dropped out. Strangely, I get the feeling Pickup and Imrie are playing these characters as written. What the actors are able to impart on the characters doesn't seem to come through as it does with the other actors. I can't exactly pinpoint why this is, but it feels like they don't bring anything of their own to the characters.Dench is possibly the most complicated character. As Evelyn makes the journey, she states to more than one person she has never been outside of England and her two grown sons seem to regard this decision to move as a minor moment of indiscretion. When she arrives in India, you see moments of fear, excitement and understanding flash through her face at various times. But Evelyn's situation is such that she needs to get a job and this provides some nice moments, a nice circle of closure.Dench is such a great actress and I am more used to watching her portray powerful, strong women. It is nice to watch her play a woman who is more down-to-earth, more vulnerable. Evelyn provides proof of Dench's range; Evelyn is strong - she would have to be to make this move and embrace it - but she is also vulnerable and open to all the new country has to offer.Tom Wilkinson plays Graham, perhaps the most experienced of the group of travelers. Given he grew up in the country; the others turn to him for advice and guidance. Graham has spent the majority of his life living in a way that didn't make him happy. As soon as he retires, the very minute, he decides to leave for the country and look up an old acquaintance.Because the other travelers depend on him, they look at him as an authority figure and more than one of the women seem to develop an attachment to him.Maggie Smith plays Muriel, a former housekeeper who is now living the remainder of her life in a small flat with nothing to do. Deeply bigoted, she is torn between waiting six or more months for her surgery in London, or moving to India and having the surgery almost immediately. The pain wins over her fear of people with brown skin and she moves to a very scary place and seems to regard everything with great hostility.It is a testament to the actress that she manages to bring the most complete character growth to her character; some key interactions lead her to begin to change, yet the changes seem natural and realistic.Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton play Douglas and Jean. They are forced to move because they simply can't afford to live in England until their investment in their daughter's internet company comes through. If it ever does. Douglas seems more willing to live the adventure. Maybe resigned is a better word. Jean seems completely reluctant to give up the style of life she has become accustomed to in England. Through the course of the film, Jean and Douglas are perhaps the most predictable of the group. But both actors manage to make the characters interesting and mildly surprising in believable ways.Dev Patel, so memorable in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and the BBC America series ""Skins"", is problematic. He runs around, waving his hands, talking in a thick Indian accent and he appears to be more similar to Apu, the animated character from ""The Simpsons"", than a real human being. He pines for a beautiful girl who works at a local telephone call center, but her brother doesn't approve of him. And his mother arrives just as he re-opens the hotel and tells him he has to close and return home and work for his more successful brothers. His romantic shenanigans are the main reason for this story and they appear too slapstick and comedic to make us really feel the romance.John Madden has created a film that is uneven, providing characters that are predictable alongside other characters who are interesting and believable, in a story that manages to grasp our attention. The different characters are designed to move you, make you laugh, make you cry, make you feel the romance and love. Most of the time, these characters work.It is definitely a film worth watching just for the performances of the majority of the leads.",4,The Very Good Exotic Marigold Hotel,1338249600,"05 29,

But then it wasn't the first choice for most of the characters in this film, and they still ended up there. Wanna know why?Evelyn Greenside (played by Judi Dench) is a housewife who was recently widowed. In addition to her grief, her husband's death has left her with massive debts. While discussing her husband's account with a representative of her internet service provider, she causes an abrupt change in tone when she informs the person on the other end of the phone, whose Indian accent is easily noticeable, that her husband is dead. We are later introduced to a High Court judge named Graham Dashwood. Dashwood (played by Tom Wilkinson) is on his way to the most recent in what seems to be an endless series of retirement parties. He's dreading the event a great deal and, rather than suffer through the festivities, he simply says, ""This is the day"" as a way of announcing his own retirement and then leaves the party without another word. Next, we have the Ainslies. Douglas Ainslie (played by Bill Nighy) and his wife Jean (played by Penelope Wilton) are exploring a number of less-than-enticing bungalows where they might spend their golden years. They'd hoped for something grander, but invested a large portion of their savings in their daughter's internet business and have yet to see that business turn a profit. Muriel Donnelly (played by Maggie Smith) is a cantankerous former housekeeper who needs a hip replacement but finds the wait, cost, and personnel at her local hospital unappealing. All these characters are made aware, in varying ways, of a seemingly beautiful retirement community in India named The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful. However, when they arrive, they soon find out that Sonny, the hotel's young and enthusiastic manager (played by Dev Patel), has misrepresented the accommodations at the hotel. He neglected to mention the hotel's shabby appearance, failing plumbing, and non-functioning phone service.Now I failed to introduce two other characters in the story. They are single by choice and have come to India looking for romance. Without cluing you in to the ending, the film avoids the obvious cliche of the two finding love in each other's arms while still allowing them to find contentment. For that reason and others, I loved this film. There are twists, surprises, happy endings, not-so-happy endings. All that merely punctuates the brilliant portrayals offered by a cast that already has many on their respective resumes. The inexplicably optimistic character played by former Slumdog Millionaire and now supporting actor on HBO's The Newsroom, Dev Patel is a constant source of amusement.

Storywise, &#8220;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#8221; has little new to say, but directed by John Madden ('Shakespeare in Love'), the romantic comedy accomplishes what it sets out to do, though rather in an obvious way. The film is not free from clich&eacute;d conventions. Actually, it is full of them. Still, if you ask me if I enjoyed the film, my answer is, yes, definitely.As I said above, the story is nothing new. Seven British retirees travel to Jaipur, India, and start living together at the Marigold Hotel run by young and enthusiastic Sonny (Dev Patel). Over time, through various events, some funny, some romantic, some even poignant, the residents of the hotel (still being restored) are given chances to change.  The great ensemble cast includes Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson and Penelope Wilton.Some compare &#8220;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#8221; with &#8220;Love Actually&#8221; because of the film&#8217;s narrative structure, but I think the themes are closer to &#8220;Enchanted April&#8221; (twice filmed in 1935 and 1991, the latter directed by Mike Newell). The theme of British people living or travelling outside the UK has been frequently taken up in British novels and films, and as is often the case with them, you may find the humor of &#8220;Marigold Hotel&#8221; a little low-key.And that is part of the film's charm. &#8220;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#8221; is a well-made romantic comedy.

Or to be specific, more than its mediocre script.  Directed by John Madden, with a script by Ol Parker adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of those films that keeps you engaged by moving along at just the right pace, because if it didn't, you'd start thinking about its flaws rather than simply enjoying it for its deserved merits.The plot begins in the UK where seven British individuals (actually five individuals and one married couple) facing their golden years are drawn for various reasons to ads for a retirement community in India, proclaiming itself as ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly & Beautiful.""  Evelyn (Judi Dench), recently widowed, finds herself facing retirement with little more than the pile of debts her husband left behind.  Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a high court judge well able to afford a comfortable retirement, is drawn back to India by memories of his youth which was spent there.  Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) Ainslie are also facing retirement with limited means due to Douglas having invested most of his life savings in his daughter's internet startup which is having trouble starting up.  Muriel (Maggie Smith) finds herself in need of a hip replacement which means several months of painful waiting unless she goes to India where she can have the procedure done immediately at a price she can afford.  Norman (Ronald Pickup), a retiree of limited means who fights facing old age by pursuing younger women, needs a change of scene.  Which also sums up Madge (Celia Imrie) who is looking for another husband - preferably a rich one - to keep her company and comfortable.  And so all of these diverse people suddenly find themselves thrown together, flying off to India and hoping for the best.The best, however, seems to be rather elusive. First, they arrive in India only to find that their connecting flight to Jaipur has been canceled.  Undeterred, Graham, the only one of the group with any familiarity with India, quickly arranges for everyone to make the remaining leg of their journey by bus and tuk-tuk, little golfcart-sized transports that can barely carry more than one person and their luggage.  But when they finally reach their destination, the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful  turns out to be rather less than the brochures had promised.  The hotel, a grand but seriously run-down establishment where some of the rooms are missing doors and none of the phones work, clearly has seen better days, possibly around the time of the British Raj which also seems to be the last time it had paying guests.  Before the dismayed newcomers can get back into their tuk-tuks however, they are greeted by Sonny (Dev Patel), the manager and part-owner of the hotel, who overcomes their misgivings with his boundless always-see-the-positive enthusiasm, quickly getting them settled into their new quarters.Each of the characters react to their new circumstances in different ways.  Evelyn is a little intimidated but also a little excited, this being the first time in her life that she's really done anything on her own. Which, it turns out, includes getting a job, which she desperately needs to be able to continue to stay at the hotel, ""even at Sonny's prices.""  Graham boldly sets out on some mission that involves looking up places he remembers from his youth - most of which are long gone now - and going to the district records office each day.  Douglas takes the hotels shortcomings in stride and treats their new life as an adventure, exploring the sights and culture with enjoyment, while Jean wants none of any of it, withdrawing into her room and into herself, refusing to make even the slightest effort to adapt. Muriel, a cantankerous and openly racist old woman, also makes no effort to adapt, refusing all of the of hotel's local dishes - ""If I can't pronounce it I'm certainly not going to eat it"" - living instead off of the stockpile of tinned foods she brought along, only gradually softening as she begins to empathize with the young Dalit woman (Seema Azmi) who attends her and cleans her room every day.  Madge joins the swank and exclusive Viceroy Club to start her search for a new and rich husband... only to find herself paired up with Norman who unbeknownst to her had done the same thing, still trying to cast himself as being richer and younger than he is.  In the meantime, Sonny is kept busy trying to keep his guests happy, trying to get a local businessman to invest money into the hotel so that he can fix it up properly, trying to keep his domineering mother (Lillette Dubey) from demanding that he quit this hotel foolishness and come back to Delhi to meet the girl she's arranged for him to marry, all the while trying to find time for his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), who works at a local call center run by her brother (Sid Makkar), which by coincidence is where Evelyn ends up getting a job as a cultural advisor to help their operators sound more natural on the phone.The best part of the film is simply watching these veteran British actors inhabit their roles, making us feel their characters anxieties and hopes, their excitement at new experiences or their trepidation at the strange and unfamiliar. And in the way they each come to terms with their lives and with themselves. The performances are all first class and keep you fully engaged throughout the film, even when the plot developments strain credulity.The weakest parts of the film, however, come from the script.  Most of the Indian characters are little more than cliches.  Though I haven't read the novel the film was adapted from - Moggach's These Foolish Things - it is apparent from the book's description that a number of changes were made for the screenplay.  Which is, I feel, where some of the problems stem from.  Moggach actually lived in Pakistan for a time.  Ol Parker's screenplay, however, seems to rely on stereotypes gleaned from Western movies set in India, which renders most of the Indian characters little more than clich&eacute;s.  Dev Patel's Sonny is the ingratiating but comically incompetent hotel manager who in the end is rescued by one of the British guests stepping in to right things.  Sonny's mother is domineering, insisting that Sonny go through with an arranged marriage.  Sid Makkar's Jay is at least allowed to be competent and intelligent - and sympathetic - as the manager of the call center who ends up seeing Evelyn as having genuine value to his company. But when he's Sunaina's brother, he's a sterotype, the stern Indian male fending off Sonny's bumbling advances towards his sister. The one true exception is Tena Desae's vibrant Sunaina, almost ironically criticized in the film by Sonny's mother as being ""too modern"".  The contrast between Sonny and Sunaina is so sharp that you not only wonder what she sees in him, you wonder what they're doing in the same film. Desae has a natural screen presence that shines through the inadequacies of the script, making you want to see more of her in other films.(Warning:  the next paragraph contains some spoilers.  Skip the next two paragraphs if you don't want to know.)More troublesome is the way the script requires sudden and often inexplicable changes in the characters and their situations to meet the needs of the plot.  Douglas and Jean's financial situation is abruptly reversed, allowing Jean to flee back to England while Douglas decides to stay, both of them having realized that they're terribly unhappy together, which allows Douglas to follow his hope of a future with Evelyn. The ostensible reason for their reversal in fortune after only a matter of weeks is that their daughter's start-up company is suddenly swimming in cash for no apparent reason, other than the fact that the plot needed it to happen at that point. In truth it would only have taken a couple of lines of dialogue - one where the start-up is first mentioned and another to explain the miraculous reversal - to make it believable, but the scriptwriters didn't bother.  This was just sloppy and ham-handed.In other instances, the hotel phones suddenly start working for no apparent reason, allowing Graham to find his long-lost lover and promptly die happy.  Sonny's mother, after having been reminded of Sonny's father's taking a stand for her by a servant who previously in the film has never said a thing, promptly drops her objections to Sonny marrying Sunaina.  And most bizarrely of all, Muriel not only suddenly becomes sympathetic, she comes to Sonny's rescue with a display of business acumen that one would expect of a former CFO rather than of a woman who'd spent her entire career as a housekeeper.But for all the failures of the script to live up to its potential, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is still a film worth seeing, for the sterling performances of its extraordinary cast and for the way in which it deals, at least in part, with people having to face the realities of their lives and their circumstances and the choices they end up making as they rediscover themselves.  The spirit of the film is best summed up in this exchange towards the end between Evelyn and Muriel.Evelyn:  ""Nothing here has worked out quite as I expected.""Muriel: ""Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff.""Definitely recommended.",4,"A stellar cast shines through as British retirees face uncertain golden years in an Indian hotel ""for the elderly &
