784518,AZDQKWB7I53DG,B0000V48IE,"Gary E. Robbins ""Flagstaff DVD Owner""","[7, 14]","This is a great compilation of the last 31 years of Academy Awards.  (They say that it is for the last 30 years.  Wrong.  Years 1972 through and including 2002 is 31, and not 30 years.)  Of note, when they are referring to the winners of the 2002 Academy Awards, they are talking about movies released in 2002, and the Academy Awards show from spring of 2003.  In other words, this compilation was completely up to date as of January, 2004, given that the Academy Awards show for movies relased in 2003 didn't occur until February 29, 2004.This set is a great trip down memory lane.  At about six hours for the entire 3 disc set, each year has only 12 or so minutes devoted to the catagories of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress in Leading Roles, and Best Actor and Actress in Supporting Roles, listing all of contenders and then the winners.  Occasionally, they would even mention who won that year for the best screenplay, or original or adapted.I started watching the awards for 1972 movies, and didn't stop until 6 hours later at around 3:30 a.m.  One interesting facet of this collection is that I could reflect on who I likely saw these movies with, given what realtionships I was in at the time.In watching this collection, I was able to remember some of the great movies that I've seen, and to be exposed to new movies to watch.But I want more!  First, I thought that I'd like for them to go back to include the 50's and 60's.  Then I realized that I'd want to see all of those great movies just before World War II.  Then I realized that they might as well go back to the first Academy Awards in the late 20's.This collection is great fun.  Every movie lover should have it in his or her library.  I recommend it highly.",5,Pop your popcorn and settle back for this one,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,1747,"['great', 'compilation', 'last', '31', 'years', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'say', 'last', '30', 'years', 'Wrong', 'Years', '1972', 'including', '2002', '31', 'not', '30', 'years', 'note', 'when', 'are', 'referring', 'winners', '2002', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'talking', 'movies', 'released', '2002', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'show', 'spring', '2003', 'other', 'words', 'compilation', 'was', 'completely', 'date', 'January', '2004', 'given', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'show', 'movies', 'relased', '2003', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'February', '29', '2004.This', 'set', 'great', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'six', 'hours', 'entire', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'year', 'only', '12', 'so', 'minutes', 'devoted', 'catagories', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'Leading', 'Roles', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Roles', 'listing', 'contenders', 'then', 'winners', 'Occasionally', 'would', 'even', 'mention', 'who', 'won', 'year', 'best', 'screenplay', 'original', 'adapted.I', 'started', 'watching', 'awards', '1972', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', '6', 'hours', 'later', '3:30', 'a.m.', 'One', 'interesting', 'facet', 'collection', 'could', 'reflect', 'who', 'likely', 'saw', 'movies', 'given', 'what', 'was', 'time.In', 'watching', 'collection', 'was', 'able', 'remember', 'great', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'be', 'exposed', 'new', 'movies', 'watch.But', 'want', 'more', 'First', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'go', 'back', 'include', '50', '60', 'Then', 'realized', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'great', 'movies', 'just', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Then', 'realized', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'late', ""20's.This"", 'collection', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'lover', 'should', 'have', 'library', 'recommend', 'highly']",30 Years of Academy Award Winners 1972-2002

It does a great job of covering the highlights of each academy awards year for the past 30 years.  It was easy to watch all of it or to pick out certain years.  I have recorded some of the recent academy awards shows but without the editing, they are extremely tedious to watch.  This set is perfect for showing the important races, wins and losses, and some of the drama involved without putting you to sleep.  I look forward to watching the Academy Awards each year and hope a DVD covering 2003 through 2012 is in the works.",5,Love the movies,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,600,"['documentary', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'searching', 'when', 'ordered', 'great', 'job', 'covering', 'highlights', 'academy', 'awards', 'year', 'past', '30', 'years', 'was', 'easy', 'watch', 'pick', 'out', 'certain', 'years', 'have', 'recorded', 'recent', 'academy', 'awards', 'editing', 'are', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'watch', 'set', 'perfect', 'showing', 'important', 'races', 'wins', 'losses', 'drama', 'involved', 'putting', 'sleep', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'year', 'hope', 'DVD', 'covering', '2003', '2012', 'works']",30 Years of Academy Award Winners 1972-2002
