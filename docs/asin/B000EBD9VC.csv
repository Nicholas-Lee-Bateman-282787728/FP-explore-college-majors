There is not a hint of doom, blight, or desperation, despite Hardy's usual flair in this direction.This is a happy, light hearted story about an engaging, energetic young woman (named ""Fancy"") who has returned to her small village after obtaining an education.  She's returned to teach the village school so that she can take care of her father.  Fancy has forgotten some of the routines of village life after being ""away"" and her re-adaptation to situations and to assumptions and beleifs is part of the entertainment of this ""G-rated"" film.She also returns to face a number of marriage proposals from ""eligible"" men, and the theme of ""eligibility"" vs. suitability is well represented.  As a woman with an education, the villagers understand that an ""offer"" must come from someone with an educated background, which, again, is more the focus than on similarity of personality or interests, never mind attraction/love. Would it be better for Fancy to be married (unhappily) and have some economic/social status or to be single, with few economic resources, but an existence free from loathing....or is there an unexpected romance ""under the greenwood tree"" that would surprise everyone's expectations?  The unexpected romance involved in an innocent hand washing basin is a scene few will forget.

I'm glad Netflix had this available to instantly stream so I could view it first before buying it on Amazon, which I did a few days after I watched it.I've never read the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The chemistry between Keeley Hawes and James Murray was evident from the beginning, and their romantic scenes were more than satisfying. I especially loved their second kiss in the woods when, right after it happens and before it continues, Dick Dewey (Murray) says to Fancy Day (Hawes), ""I knew you felt the same, Fancy. I knew it. I tasted it on your lips the first time I kissed you."" I mean, come on, that is hot! I'd want to kiss him again, too! You just don't hear lines like that anymore. And what is even hotter is the scene in the river with a half-naked James Murray. Now I know he's a little scrawny, but the faint ab lines and the wet bod are plenty tasty eye candy for me.Aside from all that hot stuff, I enjoyed the classic struggle Fancy was faced with, choosing love or choosing to be loyal. It's fun to watch all the tension and the misunderstandings unfold as the end of the story draws nearer.This really was a great BBC classic, and the quality of the picture is very comfortable to watch.

I spent my senior year blazing through Hardy's novels, which are great but a tad gloomy, with the exception of ""Under the Greenwood Tree"", which was written before Hardy himself became depressed and decided to depress high school students for generations to come. This BBC version differs from the novel in several key areas, and at the risk of committing literary sacrilege I will go so far as to call it an improvement.The story is fairly simple; Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes) is the daughter of a nobody who has basically been in life training to marry someone rich. She returns to the town of her father, and immediately attracts three suitors, two acceptable and one really really not (the highly appealing James Murray). Guess which one she ends up wanting?The film truly is a departure from the book, as Fancy is much more sympathetic here (she was kind of a twit in the novel), and Dick Dewey less of a country dolt and much more of a hottie. Hawes and Murray have spectacular chemistry, in fact they seem barely able to breathe in each other's presence. Another reviewer describes the music as repetitive; it is. But I happen to like the refrain, so I wasn't bothered by it. Besides, the end of the film contains a stunning acapella sung by the village men, a total and unexpected delight. The scenery is lovely, the story engaging, the acting splendid, and Murray gorgeous. I consider this film superior to ""Wives and Daughters"", and while not as complex and thought-provoking as ""Berkley Square"", certainly as much fun.

Under the Greenwood Tree is a lovely film that captures the romantic feel of the novel and the setting of the simple village of Mellstock in Dorset, England.  Miss Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes) is a new arrival in Mellstock, where she becomes the new schoolmistress.  Her arrival causes dismay among the Deweys, members of the church choir who are replaced by Day and the vicar's new organ.  Well, all members of the choir are upset except for the very handsome Dick Dewey (James Murray).  He and Miss Day develop feelings for each other, but his humble upbringing makes him less than a desirable suitor.  Dick has a lot of competition, for Miss Day has other suitors, like wealthy landowner Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton), the only one Mr. Day approves of, and the village vicar Reverend Maybold (Ben Miles).  She receives marriage proposals from all three men.  Will she do what is expected of her, or will she follow her heart?This is considered to be Thomas Hardy's more lighthearted novel.  I have always enjoyed the aforementioned Victorian love story's simplicity and charm.  This BBC adaptation has captured all of the things that made the book endearing.  One cannot help but feel envious when the heroine is being wooed by two very hot men.  (I know there are three suitors, but Mr. Shiner is quite old and not so very good looking.)  The production quality is top-notch, and the simple wardrobe and sets are easy on the eye.  Keeley Hawes, who I had seen in BBC's Wives and Daughters, does a wonderful portrayal of the beautiful, innocent and irresistible Fancy Day.  She manages to capture Day's torn feelings of duty vs. desire.  So many other actresses would have come across as a woe-is-I-beautiful-woman-courted-by-so-many-handsome-men sort, but Hawes handles the role with grace and dignity.  I enjoyed Ben Miles as the handsome local vicar.  He played the role of himbo Patrick in the former BBC sitcom Coupling.  I enjoyed seeing a different side of this actor.  And I am very impressed with James Murray.  He is gorgeous and oh so charismatic!  He is also quite talented and adds such a romantic touch to the characterization that I couldn't picture someone better playing the part of Dick Dewey.  I enjoyed this wonderful film.  However, it is too short, only 90-something minutes long.  That is why I take away a star.  Other than that, this is a production like only the BBC could create and it will be kept on my ever-growing DVD shelf to be watched again and again.

But the one exception is &#34;Under the Greenwood Tree,&#34; a little rural romance about going with your heart.And the BBC kept that frothy lightness alive in their 2005 adaptation, which makes the wildly underrated Keeley Hawes the center of rural romance in a small village. There's not much plot here except every single man being obsessed with the beautiful new schoolteacher, but the misunderstandings and fiery sexual tension -- as well as a subplot about a harmonium -- keep it moving quickly.Beautiful and educated Fancy Day (Hawes) arrives in the little village of Mellstock to teach at school and care for her aging father Geoffrey (Tom Georgeson). Geoffrey dreams of Fancy marrying into what he sees is her rightful place, and she quickly has three devoted swains in Mellstock -- the cultured and ambitious Parson Maybold (Ben Miles), kind and wealthy Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton), and humble but handsome Dick Dewy (James Murray).Also, there's this subplot about Maybold buying a harmonium, which infuriates the locals who have always made music in church with fiddles and choir voices. Maybold is kind of snobby and inflexible, so eventually they take matters into their own hands.Meanwhile, Fancy begins to fall in love with Dick, but believes that they can't be together because he comes from a lower social class. But she can't bring herself to consider marrying Mr. Shiner or Parson Maybold, even though each would be an excellent match. Misunderstandings, rumors and stolen kisses complicate matters further, and Fancy must decide whether her heart or her head will determine who she marries.There isn't a lot of plot in &#34;Under The Greenwood Tree&#34; -- it's pretty much about three men pursuing Fancy romantically, and her waffling about what to do. There are some subplots floating around, such as Dick wanting to expand his family's business so that he will be a better-qualified suitor for Fancy.... but for the most part, it's just the web of romantic issues.So the TV movie is best appreciated as a pleasant little fluff piece, with lots of beautiful pastoral scenery and some picturesque village cottages, and plenty of scenes of dancing, fiddling and people drinking homemade cider. The comic relief is a bit tasteless (did we need farts and Mr. Shiner stepping on poop?), but director Nicholas Laughland knows how to provide a lot of sexual tension, including an oddly erotic scene of two people washing their hands in the same bowl.It's also pleasant that there are no &#34;bad&#34; people in this story. Some of the locals do something wrong involving booze, but they're not bad at heart. The same goes for Fancy's suitors -- Mr. Shiner is a genuinely good, kind, sweet man, just not one Fancy is in love with; and despite the pastor being kind of snobby, he's genuinely in love with Fancy and wants her to be happy.Hawes gives a magnificent performance here, and she instantly becomes the center of every scene she's in. Fancy is not a perfect person -- she can be a bit snobby at times -- but she's an endearing person who genuinely doesn't want to hurt any of her suitors. And she has brilliant chemistry with Murray, especially when Fancy flirtatiously hides his shirt and subsequently gets pushed over in the river.Compared to most adaptations of classic novels, &#34;Under the Greenwood Tree&#34; is a fluff piece -- but it's such a pretty, endearing, with likable characters, pretty scenery, and Keeley Hawes.

But I won't give it more than three stars because of one decision made by the director.  Fancy is irritated because Dick misses her debut on the church organ, going instead to meet a potential business partner on that particular Sunday, showng a concern for making money which never troubles him elsewhere. We might feel that Fancy has some reason to be irritated  But, as Hardy wrote it,  Dick is absent because he has gone to act as a pallbearer at a close friend's funeral.  So Fancy's irritation is seen as a failure to understand the deep loyalty of her future husband's nature.  It was the kind of loyalty that Hardy prized. The moment is important for our understanding of each character. If the director did not understand this sympathy in his major male character, and lack of it in Fancy, and if he really thought thought he could excel Hardy by giving Dick a trivially-motivated materialistic reason for being away,  then I don't trust the director on other issues.

If you, too, are unfamiliar with Under the Greenwood Tree yet familiar with Hardy, let me advise you that this novel has none of the darkness and heavy drama of his more famous works. Nobody is murdered, commits suicide, or is executed, for example. This is a sweet, light story of love in a Wessex village. Fancy Day, a native of rural Mellstock, has been away becoming an ""educated lady,"" but now returns to town to care for her aging father while also doing double-duty as the school-mistress and church organist. Her beauty and aura of relative sophistication make her an exotic flower here amongst the rustics. Like other Hardy heroines, her unsurpassed beauty quickly earns her three possible suitors: a rich farmer, a pompous pastor, and handsome but poor Dick Dewey. Class conflict is in evidence as the town's new pastor dismisses the church choir in favor of a new ""harmonium"" played by the elegant Fancy and some of the choir members vow not to go quietly. Fancy finds herself confused by her conflict of feelings versus duty. She is undeniably attracted to Dick, but her father is making quite a case for the rich farmer, and the pastor (though a terrible class snob) sometimes does seem to be the only person in town who understands what life is like for her. I enjoyed the sweet love story with its little twists and turns heading for a predictable ending.

With two pleasant and attractive leads, Under the Greenwood Tree is very watchable.But could the source material possibly be this lame?Surely the romance would be improved if obstacles to love seemed insurmountable rather than inconsequential. It's simple enough: the higher the stakes, the greater the drama, and the more satisfying the climax.Fancy Day has three suitors. But the pastor is unbearable and the rich man is a toad; so really, she has only one suitor. If the pastor and the rich man had been drawn as remotely plausible rivals for Fancy, there would have been a semblance of dramatic tension.Issues of money and class are dismissed as if the story takes place on a college campus in 1980. But the girl's dying father has good reason to worry about her prospects in marrying poverty rather than wealth. In those days, it was a matter not merely of comfort but often of life and death.Instead of showing a loving father who is concerned about the real risk of her marrying down, the screenplay wrongheadedly renders him grasping and deluded. So her risk is nonexistent and her father is a creep, and there's no real impediment on the road to romance. The young man's obstacles are likewise smoothed into nothingness.All the ingredients for a compelling romance are lying in plain sight, and the 'creative' team has systematically chosen to minimize and discard them, one after another.Will someone competent please remake Under the Greenwood Tree?",3,How Not to Write Romance,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,1496,"['Well', 'maybe', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'two', 'pleasant', 'attractive', 'leads', 'Greenwood', 'Tree', 'very', 'watchable.But', 'could', 'source', 'material', 'possibly', 'be', 'lame', 'Surely', 'romance', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'obstacles', 'love', 'seemed', 'insurmountable', 'rather', 'inconsequential', 'simple', 'enough', 'higher', 'stakes', 'greater', 'drama', 'more', 'satisfying', 'climax.Fancy', 'Day', 'three', 'suitors', 'pastor', 'unbearable', 'rich', 'man', 'toad', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'suitor', 'pastor', 'rich', 'man', 'had', 'been', 'drawn', 'remotely', 'plausible', 'rivals', 'Fancy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'semblance', 'dramatic', 'tension.Issues', 'money', 'class', 'are', 'dismissed', 'story', 'place', 'college', 'campus', '1980', 'girl', 'dying', 'father', 'good', 'reason', 'worry', 'prospects', 'marrying', 'poverty', 'rather', 'wealth', 'days', 'was', 'matter', 'not', 'merely', 'comfort', 'often', 'life', 'death.Instead', 'showing', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'concerned', 'real', 'risk', 'marrying', 'down', 'screenplay', 'wrongheadedly', 'grasping', 'deluded', 'risk', 'nonexistent', 'father', 'creep', 'real', 'impediment', 'road', 'romance', 'young', 'man', 'obstacles', 'are', 'likewise', 'smoothed', 'ingredients', 'compelling', 'romance', 'are', 'lying', 'plain', 'sight', ""'creative"", 'team', 'systematically', 'chosen', 'minimize', 'discard', 'one', 'another.Will', 'someone', 'competent', 'please', 'remake', 'Greenwood', 'Tree']",N/A
971148,AI2G6ZZS0G00Y,B000EBD9VC,Lynne P. Caldwell,"[54, 54]","UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE, published way back in 1872, is Thomas Hardy's first popular novel.  So many of Hardy's beloved novels have the underlying theme of forbidden love.  Someone is always in love with a person from the wrong social class.  Who could forget the bewitching Bathsheba Everdene in FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD and the spell she casts on three defenseless men (well 2 of them, anyway)? UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE is the charming and adorable story of Miss Fancy Day, the lovely and spirited schoolteacher who is hired by the town parson to teach the children of Mellstock.  And here again, a spell is quickly cast on three men.First, we have Dick Dewy, the shy and handsome carrier (predecessor to moving van company) who is quite poor.  Then there is Frederic (Farmer) Shiner the wealthiest man in Mellstock (and Fancy's father's choice).  Last, we have Mr. Maybold, the arrogant town parson who feels very superior to his parishioners.Music also 'plays' an important part in this lighthearted little story.  The church choir is constantly playing their instruments or singing.  They welcome Miss Day to the community by serenading her under her window.  They are also replaced--much to everyone's consternation, by Pastor Maybold's new harmonium (at the Church).  There are many parties and dances that utilize this little orchestra.  Even at the end of the film, these musicians again serenade Fanny in an act of contrition.  She has become very despondent about her future in this little village and when the band plays, she realizes that she truly loves where she lives.  In fact, upon being proposed to by Mr. Maybold, she retorts, (when told how superior she is to the villagers) ""As for me, I'm......I'm a woman of  Mellstock.""We can tell what season it is by looking at the leaves on the Greenwood Tree in the little village.  It takes a year for the leading characters in this story to make major transformations in their thoughts and actions:  Dick Dewy becomes ambitious to win the affections of Fancy.  Fancy and her father also change...............farmer Shiner will be glad to change in order to acquire Fancy's affections!I absolutely adored this little film (as I do Thomas Hardy).  Compared to Hardy's other works, this is a much lighter fare.  It still has the lively heroine and the great romance but we don't have to go through any of the great sadness and torment that we find in his deeper novels.  Hardy, who grew up in a town like Mellstock, took the title from a poem by Shakespeare's, AS YOU LIKE IT:Under the greenwood tree,Who loves to lie with me,And turn his merry noteUnto the sweet bird's throat,Come hither, come hither, come hither;Here shall he seeNo enemyBut winter and rough weather.",5,"As for me, I'm......I'm a woman of  Mellstock",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,2734,"['GREENWOOD', 'TREE', 'published', 'way', 'back', '1872', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'first', 'popular', 'novel', 'So', 'many', 'Hardy', 'beloved', 'novels', 'have', 'underlying', 'theme', 'forbidden', 'love', 'Someone', 'always', 'love', 'person', 'wrong', 'social', 'class', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'bewitching', 'Bathsheba', 'Everdene', 'FAR', 'FROM', 'THE', 'MADDING', 'CROWD', 'spell', 'three', 'defenseless', 'men', 'well', '2', 'anyway', 'GREENWOOD', 'TREE', 'charming', 'adorable', 'story', 'Miss', 'Fancy', 'Day', 'lovely', 'spirited', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'hired', 'town', 'parson', 'teach', 'children', 'Mellstock', 'here', 'again', 'spell', 'quickly', 'cast', 'three', 'men.First', 'have', 'Dick', 'Dewy', 'shy', 'handsome', 'carrier', 'predecessor', 'moving', 'van', 'company', 'who', 'quite', 'poor', 'Then', 'Frederic', 'Farmer', 'Shiner', 'wealthiest', 'man', 'Mellstock', 'Fancy', 'father', 'choice', 'Last', 'have', 'Mr.', 'Maybold', 'arrogant', 'town', 'parson', 'who', 'very', 'superior', 'parishioners.Music', 'also', 'important', 'part', 'lighthearted', 'little', 'story', 'church', 'choir', 'constantly', 'playing', 'instruments', 'singing', 'welcome', 'Miss', 'Day', 'community', 'serenading', 'window', 'are', 'also', 'replaced', 'much', 'everyone', 'consternation', 'Pastor', 'Maybold', 'new', 'harmonium', 'Church', 'are', 'many', 'parties', 'dances', 'utilize', 'little', 'orchestra', 'Even', 'end', 'film', 'musicians', 'again', 'serenade', 'Fanny', 'act', 'contrition', 'become', 'very', 'despondent', 'future', 'little', 'village', 'when', 'band', 'plays', 'loves', 'where', 'fact', 'being', 'proposed', 'Mr.', 'Maybold', 'when', 'told', 'how', 'superior', 'villagers', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'woman', 'Mellstock', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'season', 'looking', 'leaves', 'Greenwood', 'Tree', 'little', 'village', 'year', 'leading', 'characters', 'story', 'make', 'major', 'transformations', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'Dick', 'Dewy', 'ambitious', 'win', 'affections', 'Fancy', 'Fancy', 'father', 'also', 'change', 'farmer', 'Shiner', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'change', 'order', 'acquire', 'Fancy', 'affections', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'little', 'film', 'do', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'Compared', 'Hardy', 'other', 'works', 'much', 'lighter', 'fare', 'still', 'lively', 'heroine', 'great', 'romance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'great', 'sadness', 'torment', 'find', 'deeper', 'novels', 'Hardy', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'town', 'Mellstock', 'took', 'title', 'poem', 'Shakespeare', 'YOU', 'IT', 'greenwood', 'tree', 'Who', 'lie', 'turn', 'merry', 'sweet', 'bird', 'throat', 'Come', 'hither', 'come', 'hither', 'come', 'hither', 'Here', 'shall', 'seeNo', 'enemyBut', 'winter', 'rough', 'weather']",N/A

And unlike Thomas Hardy's other dramatic and often tragic novels (think ""Tess"" and ""Far From the Madding Crowd""), ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is surprisingly lighthearted and carefree.It is a tale about a lovely young lady named Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes of ""Our Mutual Friend"" and ""Wives and Daughters"") who returns to the village of Mellstock to teach and care for her father. Soon after her arrival she catches the eye of three very different men: Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton), the wealthy and determined landowner; Dick Dewey, a handsome yet poor carrier; and Rev. Maybold (Ben Miles of ""Coupling"" and ""The Forsyte Saga""), the town's vicar.  Fancy's father urges Mr. Shiner's suite but Fancy cannot make up her mind. Should she follow her heart and marry the man she truly loves or marry the man who can provide for her and her father?""Under the Greenwood Tree"" introduces some quirky and interesting characters and watching it is very much akin to sitting under a tree (greenwood tree?) and enjoying the breeze. Unlike most British period dramas that take several hours to conclude, ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is less than 2 hours long and is a delight to watch. The story moves rather quickly and, as always, there are some misunderstandings and hurdles before Fancy finally makes her final choice.I was especially struck by James Murray, who plays Dick Dewey with such charm, charisma and is so dashing that he almost outshines the lovely Keeley Hawes.  I had never heard of him before but you can bet that I'll be keeping an eye on him from this day on.  Ms. Hawes is always a pleasure to watch although this doesn't quite match her performances in ""Our Mutual Friend"" or ""Wives and Daughters."" Ben Miles, as always, does a creditable job as the solemn vicar.  There are some other good supporting roles, most particularly by Tony Haygarth who plays Dick Dewey's father and Tom Georgeson who plays Fancy's father.I would certainly recommend ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" to fans of British period films. It is a charming little period piece that is a delight to watch. There are some wonderfully romantic moments and the chemistry between Fancy and her most ardent suitor is irresistible.

This light-hearted romance comes from the usually gloom & doom Thomas Hardy pen: well-acted & filmed, this movie is a nice treat...When Fancy Day returns to Mellstock to care for her father & teach the local schoolchildren, she creates quite a stir: the townspeople don't quite know what to make of this educated girl & the parson's plans to replace their beloved choir with her playing of the ""harmonia"" (organ).  Pretty soon the sweet & beautiful Fancy has attracted the eye of three men: a poor but handsome carrier, a rich but crass farmer and a gentlemanly but superior parson.  Her father urges her to marry well, but Fancy wants to follow her heart: will true love win out in the end?!For those of you worried about content, it is kept to a few stolen kisses between an unmarried couple; there is also some time when a young man is in the river with his shirt off & he & a young lady steal a kiss.  There is some mild carousing, as a few of the townsfolk show up to the church a bit tipsy on cider.I was quite impressed by this film: I kept waiting for the dark, depressing side of Hardy to come out & almost couldn't believe that the tone of the film seemed to be upbeat most of the time.

The eligible bachelors of a small country village pine for Fancy Day.  Fancy reminds me of a 19th-century Lorelei Gilmore (Gilmore Girls) who is lucky enough to have all of the hot men interested in her.  Dick is immediately drawn to Fancy and is not discouraged by the class difference.  Fancy's father was the gamekeeper for the estate of his wife's family; his wife was spurned by her family when she eloped with Mr. Day.  Fancy is well educated and takes a position as the local schoolteacher.  Mr. Day encourages his daughter to accept the hand of a wealthy farmer, Mr. Shiner.  Mr. Shiner is sweet and well-intentioned, but Fancy feels no love or attraction for him.  I thought it admirable of Mr. Shiner to admonish Reverend Maybold to treat Fancy well or the parson will have him to answer to.  Mr. Shiner wrongly assumes that Fancy is in love with Rev. Maybold when she refuses his hand.  Fancy loves Dick who is loved in turn by a young woman of Dick's class.  Thomas Hardy critiques class boundaries and reveals them as problematic in a far lighter manner than he does in his other novels. I never read this novel; in fact, I had never even heard of it.  I'm used to downward spirals, thwarted love, and hanged heroines when I think of Thomas Hardy.  This novel is a refreshing break from the darker pen of the great writer.Dick is so handsome and passionate (the casting is perfect in ""Under the Greenwood Tree"") that I can't imagine refusing him! The scenes between Dick and Fancy are filled with electricity and are even erotic in an understated way.  I love when Dick chides Fancy for lacking the courage to follow her heart and states that he would marry the lowliest milkmaid from the direst of circumstances if he loved her.

She is young, beautiful and educated, and the villagers don't know what to make of her.

Her luminescent beauty captivates three men in the village - the young and down-to-earth but impoverished Dick Dewey [James Murray], the rich and arrogant Farmer Shiner [Steve Pemberton] and the ambitious Parson Maybold [Ben Miles].The story is set against the beautiful background of the changing seasons as we witness Dewey's steadfast affection for Fancy, but what chance does the poor sod have when he has to contend with two rivals with much more standing and wealth than him? Will Fancy follow her heart or the wishes of her father [who wishes to see her wed and financially secure] or her wanderlust [which can be accommodated by Parson Maybold]?The focus here is very much on the romance part of the story, but in Hardy's novel, there was much description of the traditional way of life in rural villages - which was eventually threatened and displaced by the onset of the Industrial Revolution. I had hoped that the adaptation would have incorporated this aspect as well but sadly, it glosses over this central theme in Hardy's original work.Despite this shortcoming, this adaptation of ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is still charming and quite compelling. It may be the 'frothiest' of Hardy's works, but it retains the love story at the heart of Hardy's work and Keeley Hawes does an admirable job of portraying the strong-willed and charming Ms Fancy Day who has to make an important life choice that will accommodate her own aspirations and inner desires.
