1045870,A3MQVJ1JNGHDSP,B000MG2LJU,"Henry  Cooper ""&#34;Still One Me&#34;""","[1, 2]",Barry White was a legend ahead of his time plus he was a genius himself and a good father and a family man. He been gone for almost 10 years ago but it's hard to believe how great a legacy he left us that'll last a lifetime plus how his death shattered so many people all across.Barry was the real epitome on what real music is about and yeah he's one of the true ambassadors of not only making love music but soul and American music. You can't deny that. The ending of the documentary had me in tears while watching this on my dvd player and wanted real truth of what happened during his final moments in life.This DVD to me is one of the best ever with good bonus features and great commentaries from the people that knew him best plus his family.They'll never be another like The Maestro.

Actually, this dvd is a semi-documentary which is told from Barry White's daughter's perspective -- in other words, a very one-sided story -- it seems as though the whole truth is untold.  There's a battle going on with Barry's children vs. his young girlfriend at the end of his life.  The story should either be told or left totally out of the video.  If you're looking for a dvd of Barry's performances and songs, this is definitely not the dvd to purchase.",2,Barry White Lover,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,548,"['was', 'disappointed', 'dvd', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'Barry', 'White', 'songs', 'Actually', 'dvd', 'semi-documentary', 'told', 'Barry', 'White', 'daughter', 'perspective', 'other', 'words', 'very', 'one-sided', 'story', 'whole', 'truth', 'untold', 'battle', 'going', 'Barry', 'children', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'end', 'life', 'story', 'should', 'either', 'be', 'told', 'left', 'totally', 'video', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dvd', 'Barry', 'performances', 'songs', 'definitely', 'not', 'dvd', 'purchase']",N/A

However, the positive raving by these other reviewers sadly misses the point in this case.  There is not one decent DVD concert of this legendary artists anywhere!  The live in Germany DVD is absolutely terrible!  Its the worst Barry White perforance I have ever seen, and I have been a fan since his very first release.  I collect DVD concerts, and live in Germany should be burned at the stake.  How sad that such a wonderful and talented artist who thrilled millions of people for decades should pass away without one single decent video concert for his fans.  So, why celebrate a documentary of the man, without the benefit of also having his incredible talent immortalized on a video concert for the world to also celebrate? Without that...its ""Just a History.""",1,JUST A HISTORY,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,902,"['Certainly', 'documentary', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'R', 'B', 'love', 'song', 'composers', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'most', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'However', 'positive', 'raving', 'other', 'reviewers', 'sadly', 'point', 'case', 'not', 'one', 'decent', 'DVD', 'concert', 'legendary', 'artists', 'anywhere', 'live', 'Germany', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'worst', 'Barry', 'White', 'perforance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'very', 'first', 'release', 'collect', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'live', 'Germany', 'should', 'be', 'burned', 'stake', 'How', 'sad', 'wonderful', 'talented', 'artist', 'who', 'thrilled', 'millions', 'people', 'decades', 'should', 'pass', 'away', 'one', 'single', 'decent', 'video', 'concert', 'fans', 'So', 'why', 'celebrate', 'documentary', 'man', 'benefit', 'also', 'having', 'incredible', 'talent', 'immortalized', 'video', 'concert', 'world', 'also', 'celebrate', 'Just', 'History']",N/A
1045875,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B000MG2LJU,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 10]","Barry White is one of those recording artists that you know the minute you hear him on the radio. As a major magazine said years ago, :For three years running the birth rate in the US increased 5% because of Barry White's records!"". The guy ain't attractive - he's big with lots of hair but his voice can turn women of nearly every age and ethnicity into butter. And it's not just his voice. His INSTRUMENTAL hit ""Love's Theme"" is a standard now.Okay, so you know the voice and the name but, like me, probably not much else - except that he died about 10 years ago.This 2006 documentary produced by EagleVision and the UK's Channel 4 TV will tell you more than you'll ever want to know about the man. Using lots of archival footage of performances (mostly from a concert in Belgium), and narration from White himself for the first half of this 70 minute documentary, the producers have put together a complete picture of this artist beginning with his criminal record in his teens to the fight over access to him by his family in his last weeks of life. (Shades of the Anna Nicole Smith fiasco). We learn that his Business manager had his Power of Attorney and would not let his wife (they were separated) and children see him as he was dying.Yep, mixed in with the music (no really complete performances) and comments on his music from Gamble & Huff and Smokey Robinson, among others, is a sad story. The bonus features are limited to 18 minutes of outtakes of partial performances and interviews.Nicely done, it's definitely worth watching. It might have been improved by complete Music Videos that White produced to watch on repeated viewing.But it's certainly priced right.Steve Ramm ""Anything Phonographic""",4,The Sadness behind the music of the sexiest composer in history,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1711,"['Barry', 'White', 'one', 'recording', 'artists', 'know', 'minute', 'hear', 'radio', 'major', 'magazine', 'said', 'years', 'ago', 'three', 'years', 'running', 'birth', 'rate', 'US', 'increased', '5', '%', 'Barry', 'White', 'records', 'guy', 'ai', ""n't"", 'attractive', 'big', 'lots', 'hair', 'voice', 'can', 'turn', 'women', 'nearly', 'age', 'ethnicity', 'butter', 'not', 'just', 'voice', 'INSTRUMENTAL', 'hit', 'Love', 'Theme', 'standard', 'now.Okay', 'know', 'voice', 'name', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'died', '10', 'years', 'ago.This', '2006', 'documentary', 'produced', 'EagleVision', 'UK', 'Channel', '4', 'TV', 'will', 'tell', 'more', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'want', 'know', 'man', 'Using', 'lots', 'archival', 'footage', 'performances', 'mostly', 'concert', 'Belgium', 'narration', 'White', 'first', 'half', '70', 'minute', 'documentary', 'producers', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'complete', 'picture', 'artist', 'beginning', 'criminal', 'record', 'teens', 'fight', 'access', 'family', 'last', 'weeks', 'life', 'Shades', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Smith', 'fiasco', 'learn', 'Business', 'manager', 'had', 'Power', 'Attorney', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'wife', 'were', 'separated', 'children', 'see', 'was', 'dying.Yep', 'mixed', 'music', 'really', 'complete', 'performances', 'comments', 'music', 'Gamble', 'Huff', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'others', 'sad', 'story', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'limited', '18', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'partial', 'performances', 'interviews.Nicely', 'done', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'complete', 'Music', 'Videos', 'White', 'produced', 'watch', 'repeated', 'certainly', 'priced', 'right.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Although there are only segments taken from a few of Barry's various concerts, it is very well put together. BW's music is seamlessly  entwined so beautifully throughout portions of the story-line. Great job JP!In addition, it was a very nice touch hearing from producer-writers such as Gambel & Huff and of course Smokey Robinson share a bit of their personal experiences and views on Barry.July 4, 2003....the day Barry White crossed over into the next dimension was a sad day for those of us who loved his music. In this DVD, as his family shares with us tragic events that took place in his last days, I was literally in tears. They truly went through a tough time.
