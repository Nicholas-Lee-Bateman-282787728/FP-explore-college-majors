But before he took that step he looked for evidence.  From the main points of the authenticity of the New Testament, was Jesus the Son of God and the biggest of them all, the Resurrection.

Other people need facts and proof, well here it is.The Case for Faith, is examining the faith of Christians and people in general.  When questions come up to challenge your faith, do you break down or do you have a defense.  This dvd is the defense.  Why is there evil in the world, is probably the hardest pill to swallow, but answers are given.  Maybe ones we don't like or want to hear, but they're in there.  Is Jesus the only way to God and Salvation, that question is in there.The Case for a Creator takes a look at the physical and created world.  From our place in the galaxy in this mass universe all the way to our itty bitty cells.  Darwinism is compared to creation.  Like i said before, some people can come to faith by just hearing about God or Jesus.  But, if you need even more evidence here it is again.As before if you want more indepth research, read the books, but to get an eye opening experience buy these dvd's for a friend or even a family member.
