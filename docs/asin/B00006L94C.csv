Crippling the aircraft, they attack the crew and passengers and knock out the communications system while the Queen scorpion forces the flight crew from the cockpit. As the airplane cruises blindly in autopilot over the icy Atlantic, the control tower loses contact with them altogether...As time runs out, land is still far away.

You need a really good script, you need to screen test the creatures, you need really good characters, etc.  Apparently he learned all of this AFTER making this film.Genetically mutated scorpions are released on an overseas airliner.  They almost immediately turn into giants.  They then proceed to crawl about all of the secret passageways (huh?) including the ones in the ceiling.  I don't know how a 15-foot scorpion made it into the cockpit without anyone noticing, but that was only one of the bits of silliness.The plane changes models in the film and has a cargo bay the size of a small warehouse (and anyone can get into it).  There are only about twenty passengers, most of them laughable cliches.  The scientists refer to the scorpions as insects (yeah, right) and the scorps even have a queen.Really bad acting, bad sets (one of a cabin with enough open floor space to hold a dance party), and worse monsters make you think the film should have arisen from the days of black and white B-movies.  But its modern!This movie is bad, but the over-the-top characters actually make it kind of fun.

How they got on board? Well, duh...they were regular size at first and then just suddenly grew when their containers are knocked over during the trip! There was nothing scary about the film. The creatures looked so obviously fake...like out of a 50s movie. There weren't any surprises. Even the writing is just predictable and boring. And, I didn't feel compassion towards any of the characters...everything about the film is just a waste. I'm glad I only rented it.

720101,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00006L94C,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","TAIL STING is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever viewed.  Even though it had me laughing several times, it is still an abominable excuse for film-making.  The actors (?) are all bad---Christian Scott as the James Brolin clone and Laura Putney as the heroes are hilariously awful.  Putney pops her eyes a lot, and tilts her head in a supposedly sexy manner; her outfit when she becomes the Sigourney Weaver of awful movies, has got to be seen to be believed.  The plane must be huge to allow such a large queen scorpion ramble around.  The fight scenes look kindergartenish (although a good fight by a couple of 3 year olds could outclass these!).  The special effects are laughably horrid; the computer geeks are unbelievably bad...the director loves zeroing in on their flying fingers, although you can tell they're not really typing anything; the camera never even pans to show you what they're finding.  The plane lands in LAX, and there's not another plane or soul around...anyone who's been to LAX knows this could never happen.I'm a creature feature fan, but this one isn't even worth viewing for a laugh.  Awful, awful waste of celluloid and time.

720102,A3KXFQQFBPJTQE,B00006L94C,"Mr N Forbes-warren ""author of RESURGENCE and ...","[1, 2]","I read about this on a bad movies website, and it seems there has been a resurgence of killer-creature flix. The story was an interesting idea, geneticall-modified scorpions causing havoc on an airliner, but when the creatures became GIANT RUBBER ONES, I was in hysterics. The SFX here could have been done better by a two-year old. Continuity gaffes galore - Melbourne in New South Wales, Australia(???), the plane was a 737 on takeoff but became a Tristar in mid-flight(with the interiors of a 747 and a larger cargo hold which the passengers had easy access to. There was even a subplot of two asylum seekers who became the heroes of the day saving the airliner and a chance to make utterly racist jokes at their expense; the girl who messed up the team's chance to be world champions making good, a mad scientist out for profit from the GM scorpions and basically I did not care a jot who lived or died. The script is right out of a bad Nu Image killer-animal production or a grade Z 1950s SF flick; and this ranks as one of the worst airplane movies since HORROR AT 37000 FEET(1972). However, if awful movies are your thing for a right good laugh, this may be for you.
