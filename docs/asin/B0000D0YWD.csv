It does provide a sense of who this monarch became after an unusual and difficult childhood.  It presents him as something more than simply the womanizer he undoubtedly was.  I enjoyed it when it first aired and I enjoyed my recent return to it.  This was also my introduction to the beautiful Francesca Annis as Lilly Langtry, who went on to do her own series on the renowned beauty and actress, &#34; Lilly.&#34; If you enjoy Masterpiece Theater style history, you will like both of these productions.",4,Interesting Portrait,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,707,"['not', 'recent', 'production', 'series', 'values', 'one', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'production', 'execellent', 'performances', 'solid', 'writing', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'decent', 'history', 'provide', 'sense', 'who', 'monarch', 'became', 'unusual', 'difficult', 'childhood', 'something', 'more', 'simply', 'womanizer', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'return', 'was', 'also', 'introduction', 'beautiful', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'Lilly', 'Langtry', 'who', 'went', 'do', 'own', 'series', 'renowned', 'beauty', 'actress', '34', 'Lilly.', '34', 'enjoy', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'style', 'history', 'will', 'like', 'productions']",N/A

As a lover of history, I enjoy trying to remember who was the mother or father or grandparents of which one. It sometimes makes my head spin. I think I'll make a chart so I can finally get it straight.The backgrounds in this series are lovely and the actors superb! I have to keep reminding myself not to feel too sorry for ""Bertie"" because, poor thing, he was isolated and made to work hard and rarely appreciated for doing anything right. He had the best of educational resources and luxuries beyond our imagination. Yes, their lives are different from ours. That's what makes them fascinating to watch.I could hardly tear myself away from watching as one episode stopped and I had to take a break in watching. The thing I loved most about this series was the history. Did I really care about the characters and what happened to them?  Not always. Sometimes I was glad that they got what they deserved. Their values and lifestyles (excessive and brutal killing of wild animals for example) are not like ours. I'm happy to enjoy the history and the beauty of all their ceremonial events, but, as an American, this series proves to me once again that it's much nicer to enjoy it from a distance.

Annette Crosbie is so delightful in this series, and Timothy West does a good interpretation of Edward VII.Although Queen Victoria reigns in most of this series (she doesn't die until the end of Disc Three), one soon learns why:  she held a tight reign on her own monarchy.  Her interpretations of monarchial behavior was very strict and procedural. Although she loved her son, she didn't see him as fit for the monarchy, which frustrated Edward who then sought entertainment elsewhere, which didn't delight Queen Victoria. ""You must learn to be more tactful when dealing with the Queen"" Disraeli tells Edward VII.  How true.One also sees how Europe was shaped through the arranged marriages of Victoria, and how the princess and princes from those marriages suffered.  One then understands ""Victorian England"" and the shape of things to come prior to WWI.  This production shows the flaws of all the main characters:  from Queen Victoria's overbearingness, Edward's penchant for other women, Alix' protective nature toward her native Denmark.Edward's reign was marked with trying to maintain peace in a shattered world, a world he had no power to influence until he became king.  And once he became king, he tried hard not to be the kind of monarch his mother was:  he always let his son George in on business so that he could be ready to be king when it was his turn.The actors protraying Princess Alex and Disraeli also did stellar performances.  All of them age nicely as the years pass in this production.The strength is in the acting and scripting of this production.  A worth-while series to have and to hold.  One learns a lot about European history of the time while watching this, and how the fates of so many countries were intertwined because of marriages with English royalty.",5,Well done,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,1935,"['masterpiece', 'more', 'play', 'full', 'insights', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'future', 'King', 'England', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'so', 'delightful', 'series', 'Timothy', 'West', 'good', 'interpretation', 'Edward', 'VII.Although', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'most', 'series', ""n't"", 'die', 'end', 'Disc', 'Three', 'one', 'soon', 'why', 'held', 'tight', 'reign', 'own', 'monarchy', 'interpretations', 'monarchial', 'behavior', 'was', 'very', 'strict', 'procedural', 'loved', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'fit', 'monarchy', 'frustrated', 'Edward', 'who', 'then', 'sought', 'entertainment', 'elsewhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'delight', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'must', 'learn', 'be', 'more', 'tactful', 'when', 'dealing', 'Queen', 'Disraeli', 'Edward', 'VII', 'How', 'true.One', 'also', 'how', 'Europe', 'was', 'shaped', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'Victoria', 'how', 'princess', 'princes', 'marriages', 'suffered', 'One', 'then', 'Victorian', 'England', 'shape', 'things', 'come', 'prior', 'WWI', 'production', 'flaws', 'main', 'characters', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'overbearingness', 'Edward', 'penchant', 'other', 'women', 'Alix', 'protective', 'nature', 'native', 'Denmark.Edward', 'reign', 'was', 'marked', 'trying', 'maintain', 'peace', 'shattered', 'world', 'world', 'had', 'power', 'influence', 'became', 'king', 'once', 'became', 'king', 'tried', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'kind', 'monarch', 'mother', 'was', 'always', 'let', 'son', 'George', 'business', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'ready', 'be', 'king', 'when', 'was', 'turn.The', 'actors', 'protraying', 'Princess', 'Alex', 'Disraeli', 'also', 'did', 'stellar', 'performances', 'age', 'nicely', 'years', 'pass', 'production.The', 'strength', 'acting', 'scripting', 'production', 'worth-while', 'series', 'have', 'hold', 'One', 'lot', 'European', 'history', 'time', 'watching', 'how', 'fates', 'so', 'many', 'countries', 'were', 'intertwined', 'marriages', 'English', 'royalty']",N/A
776788,A132O2LX94WY9P,B0000D0YWD,Claude Lambert,"[2, 2]","I am old enough that my grandparents were adults when Edward was king. I often heard from the French parts of the family of his numerous mistresses in Paris. He was a frequent host of a Parisian brothel: le Chabanais. You will not see any of this in the series: the 70s were not up to it. If the series was redone nowadays, it is probably all you would see.  At most, he is holding hands with the most famous of his mistresses. His mother, Queen Victoria, remarkably played by Annette Crosbie, is shown here much more vain, more obstinate and less intelligent (almost obtuse) than I thought she was. Her husband, Prince Albert, who had a hard time acquiring any semblance of power, is resentful -I am sure he was- and if the Queen shows great love for him, there appears to be little reciprocity. It is an interesting take of the couple. As parents, Victoria and Albert appear very severe: it was the practice of the time. It will be nice to see Edward, at the end of his life, as a doting grandfather. But there is more: Edward's parents are resentful that he is not a carbon copy of his father. There are still lots of parents like this nowadays. The sufferings of young Edward, unable to please his parents, and his decision to give up and do whatever he wanted (hunt, chase women and gamble)make an interesting and well thought part of this series. His very public moral failures made him love, I think (""he is like us""), plus the fact that for a man of his social class, he was uncommonly at ease with everybody. Notice in the series how polite he is and the number of times he says ""thank you""; very uncommon for a prince of that generation. Finally king, his understanding of people and governments and his extensive links to royal families in Europe allow him to be of use and promote peace. It will not last: one look at the erratic German Emperor, Wilhem II, played by Christopher Neame, lets you know that World War I is coming.Great series with wonderful attention to details (clothes, furniture, wallpaper: everything has been carefully studied).

It was originally broadcast on British TV (as Edward the Seventh) in the 70s but is so well done that it appears to be a 21th century release.Queen Victoria (Annette Crosbie) begins as a young lady who married Prince Albert but initially left him out of government and British leadership.  Her love for the Prince brings her to full devotion, even after his death in 1841.  The role of the queen could be played no better.  Watching the change through the episodes as the Queen (who reigned 50+ years) brings the role even more reality.  The acting brings out your own emotion as you begin to almost feel a part of the family.Bertie, who would become King Edward VII, played by Timothy West, is equal to Crosbie's stellar performance.  West does such a good job of playing Bertie, who eventually the King after a 60 year wait due to Queen Victoria's refusal to relinquish her role.  The viewer empathizes with Bertie in his struggle to make a difference in British lives.  Between his coronation in 1901 and his death in 1910, King Edward VII became even more beloved by the UK people and known for his peacemaking abilities.This is a story of a monarchy, particularly the years of Queen Victoria and her son Bertie, but the story is written to make the viewer feel their humanness and experience their struggles with politics and family, joys and grief--also very familiar to common people.  This is so much more than a British history lesson.Lillie Langtry's (Francesca Annis) relationship with Bertie, is included as well as his mistress Alice Keppel.  Side note: Lillie's own story was placed into a British drama series of it's own in the 70s.  ""Lillie"" is also a recommended DVD set.  Both ""Lillie"" and ""Edward the King"" are must-own's for the British drama enthusiast.Costumes, dancing, and the home furnishings in the sets are exceptional, as are many landscape scenic views.  It is like a travelogue show depicting the British Monarchy from 1840s to 1910.  But this is a story, mind, not a documentary; a performance, not a history lecture.This Acorn Media release of the series is ENLARGED AND PACKED with special features that add so much more to the award-winning drama that has already proved itself over a couple of generations of viewers.The BAFTA, ""Best Drama Series"", award proves this DVD's worth.FIVE STARS AND FIVE BRAVOS.

Very little expense was spared, and the costumes faithfully replicate the court dress of every decade between 1842 (when the miseries begins, at Queen Victoria's realization of Edward's conception) and 1910 (when Edward dies); many scenes are shot at the actual locations, including Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral. You should be warned from the get-go that, due to its extreme length, the miniseries sags quite a bit in the middle, between Edward's marriage to Alexandra and his accession to the throne. For whatever reason, the BBC decided that Edward's numerous extramarital affairs could be mentioned but that ""Bertie"" (Timothy West) could be shown giving nothing more passionate to his many illicit loves other than a kiss on the cheek--and then only once, in parting with Lillie Langtry (Francesca Annis). So the rest of the middle section of this miniseries is pretty dull, with far too many bluff and hearty dinner parties, and with far too many minor sexual and social scandals, most of which could have been easily cut, since Edward's protests to his mother and wife of doing nothing more indiscreet than admiring the beauty of these women is borne out entirely by what we see on camera. Also, the children of Victoria and Albert (and their childrens' spouses, the heads of European royalty) are so nice and well mannered that not much of anything seems to happen in the middle. Yet the miniseries is more than  worth seeing for the three episodes at the beginning and the three episodes at the end. The latter sequences are worth seeing for what happens when Edward finally is enthroned, close to age sixty, and has the ability to do what he has long dreamed of doing, and can brokers a European peace by dint of his influence upon his two nephews, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Czar Nicholas II, who are the actual rulers of two of the most important empires on Earth. This latter triad of episodes also shows this series' Edward and Alexandra at their absolute best: as Edward VII, Timothy West is never quite so likable as when playing with his many royal grandchildren and happily making a fool of himself, while Helen Ryan, as the deaf, forgiving, kindly, yet surprisingly patriotic Alexandra, shows herself at her most eccentric and lovable. And the first triad of episodes is worth the entire series, because they give the great Annette Crosbie her fullest showcase as Edward's mother, the inestimable Queen Victoria.Although Queen Elizabeth I has been the proverbial role for giving actresses a great showcase for their talents, nearly as many have had a go at the Last of the Hanovers, from Helen Hayes and Anna Neagle to Irene Dunne and Judi Dench. But none of them have been allowed further range than Annette Crosbie is here over the course of a full ten episodes, and she so dominates the series that for all of these first ten episodes she is deservedly given top billing. Hers is the performance that far and away makes the greatest impression, perhaps because Victoria is the most interesting person in the entire series. From her first scene, screaming ""'MUST'... TO ME!"" at her former governess in outraged disbelief, Crosbie's Victoria makes us laugh almost constantly. Trained from an early age to see the entire world subject to her whims, Crosbie's Victoria is so surprised when the universe does not obey her that her whole body reacts in outrage; often she is caught so by surprise at the expressions of willpower in other people that she freezes in shock before she can quite make up her mind whether to explode in fury, burst into tears, or erupt in laughter. I can't remember the last time an actor's performance caught me so repeatedly off-guard, and made me chuckle so often in delight. Even in the long later years of her reign when she mostly does walk-ons during the dreary events of the middle episodes devoted to her sons' scandals with his mistresses, she keeps a wonderful comic routine going with her dismaying prime minister William Gladstone (Michael Hordern), who always says exactly the wrong thing to her. You look forward to Annette Crosbie's every appearance on camera; it is one of the true triumphs of Seventies British acting, and makes the whole thing a kind of classic.",4,Her Majesty Annette Crosbie,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,4480,"['Phillip', 'Magnus', 'magisterial', 'biography', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', 'was', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'miniseries', 'BBC', 'exceptionally', 'lavish', 'unfortunately', 'exceptionally', 'long', 'miniseries', 'adaptation', 'was', 'commissioned', 'BBC', 'mid', '1970s', 'Very', 'little', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'costumes', 'faithfully', 'replicate', 'court', 'dress', 'decade', '1842', 'when', 'miseries', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'realization', 'Edward', 'conception', '1910', 'when', 'Edward', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'actual', 'locations', 'including', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Cathedral', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'get-go', 'due', 'extreme', 'length', 'miniseries', 'sags', 'quite', 'bit', 'middle', 'Edward', 'marriage', 'Alexandra', 'accession', 'throne', 'reason', 'BBC', 'decided', 'Edward', 'numerous', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'could', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Bertie', 'Timothy', 'West', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'giving', 'nothing', 'more', 'passionate', 'many', 'illicit', 'other', 'kiss', 'cheek', 'then', 'only', 'once', 'parting', 'Lillie', 'Langtry', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'rest', 'middle', 'section', 'miniseries', 'pretty', 'dull', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'bluff', 'hearty', 'dinner', 'parties', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'minor', 'sexual', 'social', 'scandals', 'most', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'cut', 'Edward', 'protests', 'mother', 'wife', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'indiscreet', 'admiring', 'beauty', 'women', 'borne', 'out', 'entirely', 'what', 'see', 'camera', 'Also', 'children', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'childrens', 'spouses', 'heads', 'European', 'royalty', 'are', 'so', 'nice', 'well', 'mannered', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'happen', 'middle', 'miniseries', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing', 'three', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'three', 'episodes', 'end', 'latter', 'sequences', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'what', 'when', 'Edward', 'finally', 'enthroned', 'close', 'age', 'sixty', 'ability', 'do', 'what', 'long', 'dreamed', 'doing', 'can', 'brokers', 'European', 'peace', 'dint', 'influence', 'two', 'nephews', 'Kaiser', 'Wilhelm', 'II', 'Czar', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'who', 'are', 'actual', 'rulers', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'empires', 'Earth', 'latter', 'triad', 'episodes', 'also', 'series', 'Edward', 'Alexandra', 'absolute', 'best', 'Edward', 'VII', 'Timothy', 'West', 'never', 'quite', 'so', 'likable', 'when', 'playing', 'many', 'royal', 'grandchildren', 'happily', 'making', 'fool', 'Helen', 'Ryan', 'deaf', 'forgiving', 'kindly', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'patriotic', 'Alexandra', 'most', 'eccentric', 'lovable', 'first', 'triad', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'give', 'great', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'fullest', 'showcase', 'Edward', 'mother', 'inestimable', 'Queen', 'Victoria.Although', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'been', 'proverbial', 'role', 'giving', 'actresses', 'great', 'showcase', 'talents', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'Last', 'Hanovers', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'Anna', 'Neagle', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'further', 'range', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'here', 'course', 'full', 'ten', 'episodes', 'so', 'series', 'first', 'ten', 'deservedly', 'given', 'top', 'billing', 'Hers', 'performance', 'far', 'away', 'greatest', 'impression', 'perhaps', 'Victoria', 'most', 'interesting', 'person', 'entire', 'series', 'first', 'scene', 'screaming', 'ME', 'former', 'governess', 'outraged', 'disbelief', 'Crosbie', 'Victoria', 'almost', 'constantly', 'Trained', 'early', 'age', 'see', 'entire', 'world', 'subject', 'whims', 'Crosbie', 'Victoria', 'so', 'surprised', 'when', 'universe', 'not', 'obey', 'whole', 'body', 'reacts', 'outrage', 'often', 'caught', 'so', 'surprise', 'expressions', 'willpower', 'other', 'people', 'shock', 'can', 'quite', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'explode', 'fury', 'burst', 'tears', 'erupt', 'laughter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'actor', 'performance', 'caught', 'so', 'repeatedly', 'off-guard', 'made', 'chuckle', 'so', 'often', 'delight', 'Even', 'long', 'later', 'years', 'reign', 'when', 'mostly', 'walk-ons', 'dreary', 'events', 'middle', 'episodes', 'devoted', 'sons', 'scandals', 'mistresses', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'routine', 'going', 'dismaying', 'prime', 'minister', 'William', 'Gladstone', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'who', 'always', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'thing', 'look', 'forward', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'appearance', 'camera', 'one', 'true', 'triumphs', 'Seventies', 'British', 'acting', 'whole', 'thing', 'kind', 'classic']",N/A

ETK is so much more than a bio-pic as it follows Bertie/Edward VII's life from his frustration at being kept out of statecraft by Queen Victoria and hers and Prince Albert's disapproval at Bertie's behavior--normal for a young man of privilege--to the excesses of his adult years. Far from being merely the libertine of legend, Edward VII was a statesman, and this series well illustrates his even hand as an administrator and the personality that branded his name on an age.  Timothy West is simply terrific as the older Bertie/Edward and the rest of the cast is equally great.  Watch for Francesca Annis as Lillie Langtry, Felicity Kendall as Princess Vicky, Sir John Gielgud as a dashing Disraeli, and Robert Hardy as Prince Albert, and Annette Crosbie as a very human Queen Victoria.  Crosbie's regal tantrums and strangleholds on her children and stature as the Queen are wonderful and awful to see.The period detail is impeccable down to the fashion, wallpaper and china patterns, and the sets are atmospheric (if can overlook minor details like recently completed Sandringham having ivy covered walls).

Although it can be a bit soap opera-like in places, overall Edward the King is another fine series from the heyday of British mini-series.The series begins before the birth of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales with a good depiction of the often tense relationship between the young Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert, and her mother the Duchess of Kent.  Annette Crosbie does an excellent job of portraying the highly emotional Queen.  Over the next few episodes we see young Bertie, as he was known, as the victim of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria's weird theories on child-rearing and the proper education for a young Prince. Eventually we see Bertie as a young man rebelling against his parents and beginning a life of pleasure and dissipation which was only slightly diminished by the death of Prince Albert and Bertie's own  marriage to Princess Alexandra of Denmark.  Bertie's adult life, jumping from mistress to mistress to gambling den to countless other forms of pleasure and indulgence, make up the bulk of the next few episodes.  Eventually, Bertie becomes King Edward VII and the focus of the series shifts to international politics, depicting the King as ""the Peacemaker"" who adroitly defused several international crises and deftly managed his own widespread family, including his nephew the Kaiser and nephew in law the Tsar, while still managing more than a few illicit pleasure along the way.The series can be a bit mawkish at times, particularly with some of the background music which evokes the worst soap opera stereotypes, but overall its fun and pleasing to watch, and the many characters, including the many Royals and politicians, are well depicted and historically accurate.",5,Another Sweeping British History Series,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1809,"['Edward', 'King', 'was', 'produced', 'Britain', '1970s', 'late', '1970s', 'US', 'audiences', 'saw', 'PBS', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'soap', 'opera-like', 'places', 'overall', 'Edward', 'King', 'fine', 'series', 'heyday', 'British', 'mini-series.The', 'series', 'birth', 'Albert', 'Edward', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'good', 'depiction', 'often', 'tense', 'relationship', 'young', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'husband', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'mother', 'Duchess', 'Kent', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'highly', 'emotional', 'Queen', 'next', 'few', 'episodes', 'see', 'young', 'Bertie', 'was', 'known', 'victim', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'weird', 'theories', 'child-rearing', 'proper', 'education', 'young', 'Prince', 'Eventually', 'see', 'Bertie', 'young', 'man', 'rebelling', 'parents', 'beginning', 'life', 'pleasure', 'dissipation', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'diminished', 'death', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Bertie', 'own', 'marriage', 'Princess', 'Alexandra', 'Denmark', 'Bertie', 'adult', 'life', 'jumping', 'mistress', 'mistress', 'gambling', 'den', 'countless', 'other', 'forms', 'pleasure', 'indulgence', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'next', 'few', 'episodes', 'Eventually', 'Bertie', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', 'focus', 'series', 'international', 'politics', 'depicting', 'King', 'Peacemaker', 'who', 'adroitly', 'defused', 'several', 'international', 'crises', 'deftly', 'managed', 'own', 'widespread', 'family', 'including', 'nephew', 'Kaiser', 'nephew', 'law', 'Tsar', 'still', 'managing', 'more', 'few', 'illicit', 'pleasure', 'way.The', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'mawkish', 'times', 'particularly', 'background', 'music', 'worst', 'soap', 'opera', 'stereotypes', 'overall', 'fun', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'many', 'characters', 'including', 'many', 'Royals', 'politicians', 'are', 'well', 'depicted', 'historically', 'accurate']",N/A

776803,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B0000D0YWD,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[4, 4]","This thirteen part series does something very rare in TV: it tracks the entire life history of a single individual, seven decades in all, patiently showing all its defining events. The choice of subject did not make things easy: the vapid, womanizing Edward VII is not a very sympathetic character, though the sharpest edges have been blunted a bit in the re-telling; his marriage to Alexandra, for instance, was nowhere near as warm as it is depicted here.The series was filmed in the early seventies. Inevitably, the execution is not up to the standards of authenticity we've become accustomed to in later years. Most of the indoor scenes (i.e., nearly all) were filmed in slightly too small, slightly too stuffy stage sets, not quite stylistically believable and with cardboard landscapes outside the windows. There is little sense of royal grandeur, and at times it feels like `Upstairs, downstairs"". The eventual coronation is suggested rather than shown. Outdoor scenes do use apt locations, but look as if they are slightly out of focus. Costumes are excellent though, and faithfully follow the changing fashions.The acting too is more of the old-fashioned stage than of modern TV, but that is not at all a bad thing. It may be overly emphatic at times - the way Queen Victoria over-articulates her words is a case in point - but it is also consistent, stylish, and quite believable. By the time we come to Albert's death, you may be as surprised as I was at the extent to which it genuinely moves you. The acting, in fact, is supremely fine, with John Gielgud as a luxury cast member doing a delicious Disraeli. But the whole thing is carried by the two female leads: Annette Crosbie as a feisty, hot-tempered yet endearing Queen Victoria, and Helen Ryan as a vulnerable, touching, somewhat child-like Queen Alexandra.The screenwriting is very deft, but what else would one expect from Harold Pinter himself? It is quite amazing how a natural sense of the flow of time is maintained, yet without any scene ever feeling hurried. Transitions are very cleverly handled, the writer not being afraid to do an appeal on the intelligence of the viewer, something increasingly rare in TV. Necessary background information is ingeniously worked into the dialogue. That dialogue itself is surprisingly natural; only at the very end does the eulogy of the prime minister on the dead King sound as if he is talking to the camera.The aging of characters is well-handled too, mostly; but the metamorphosis from young Edward to older Edward requires a fair degree of tolerance: the young prince turns from a frisky adolescent into a stocky middle-aged man in a matter of months. Of course, there is no good way to solve the problem of aging in a series that tracks an entire life-history; doing it through make-up would probably have been quite as bad, if not worse.The bombastic music with its Wagner and Elgar overtones, is dated; the title tune bears an unfortunate (if not entirely inappropriate) resemblance to the final chorus of `HMS Pinafore'. Strangely, every episode is cut into two `parts', the second opening with the title image and a brief fanfare.The series is extravagantly spread over 6 DVDs, when it would have easily fitted on 4.

His early upbringing was very strict as was his education.  He had no friends to speak of and this was a major contributing factor in his unhappiness.  Because he was isolated from other children, he didn't know how to interact w/others and therefore couldn't be a ""normal"" student.  He did manage to make a few friends, though, and later he came to love and eventually marry Princess Alexandra (Alix) of Denmark, who remained his loyal and steadfast wife throughout his philandering years and his illnesses and she was at his bedside when he died.  The country and indeed the world mourned his passing, he having reigned as sovereign for a brief nine years.Timothy West was wonderful as Bertie (King Edward) and Annette Crosbie stole the show throughout the entire series, even when she became elderly, there was no doubt who was running the country.  Helen Ryan, who played Bertie's wife, is a true pleasure to watch.  She is genteel in manner and quite refined in her own right and she transfers those qualities to her character very easily.

No matter as this British series is so finely acted the viewer is transported back into history and is able to live through the reign of Queen Victoria and King Edward. In fact, this drama is so well acted viewers will often have a difficult time discovering which actor played which character. (Big hint look for John Guilgood or Geoffrey Palmer) who both had parts in Edward the King also known in Britain as Edward the Seventh.Family and social history is not forgotten either as this series often depicts both the heartbreaking and loving methods of family dynamics. Edward, often misunderstood by his parents, is never given encouragement for trying to do his best in academics as a child. Later as an adult, Queen Victoria never offers her son any substantial work to do. Prince Albert Edward later turns to the playboy life which the queen criticizes.The show offers the back story of history as Queen Victoria's children marriages stretched from Germany to Russia. Family meetings, as depicted in this series, were often lively as different sovereigns argued over their national interests during family visits.Highly recommend as this series offers a historical view of both Victorian and Edwardian history.",5,Fine acting,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1342,"['Edward', 'King', 'was', 'produced', '1973', 'may', 'lack', 'fancy', 'bells', 'whistles', 'found', 'today', 'high', 'tech', 'productions', 'No', 'matter', 'British', 'series', 'so', 'finely', 'acted', 'viewer', 'transported', 'back', 'history', 'able', 'live', 'reign', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'King', 'Edward', 'fact', 'drama', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'viewers', 'will', 'often', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'discovering', 'actor', 'played', 'character', 'Big', 'hint', 'look', 'John', 'Guilgood', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'who', 'had', 'parts', 'Edward', 'King', 'also', 'known', 'Britain', 'Edward', 'Seventh.Family', 'social', 'history', 'not', 'forgotten', 'either', 'series', 'often', 'heartbreaking', 'loving', 'methods', 'family', 'dynamics', 'Edward', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'parents', 'never', 'given', 'encouragement', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'academics', 'child', 'Later', 'adult', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'never', 'son', 'substantial', 'work', 'do', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Edward', 'later', 'playboy', 'life', 'queen', 'criticizes.The', 'show', 'back', 'story', 'history', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'children', 'marriages', 'stretched', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'Family', 'meetings', 'depicted', 'series', 'were', 'often', 'lively', 'different', 'sovereigns', 'argued', 'national', 'interests', 'family', 'visits.Highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'historical', 'view', 'Victorian', 'Edwardian', 'history']",N/A

776807,A1XYKO38JK6N8K,B0000D0YWD,northkona,"[2, 2]","Since the series opens with a young Queen Victoria, I'll comment on her first.  Victoria was a formidable monarch, stubborn, and did indeed resist giving an inch on delegating power.  Unfortunately, her character in this series is petulant and often unreasonable in a childish way, and I don't think that's a fair appraisal.  A more subtle approach could have shown her steeliness without making a caricature of her.  There was an odd thing that I didn't like, and that was the decision to shave the actress's hairline so her forehead would be much bigger, like that of the Tudor queen, Elizabeth.  I don't think Victoria had a prominent forehead, but even if she did, they could have skipped pointing it out because that feature isn't one that people think of when they conjure up her image in their mind. It looks bad every time she's on screen, and it makes you wonder what that weird appearance is all about.The series does pick up speed after the first couple of episodes, and does a good job of showing the family connections between the rulers of Great Britain, Germany, Russia, Denmark, and Greece, and how the groundwork was laid for future revolutions and wars.  The actor who plays the Kaiser does a terrific job of showing a warmonger teetering on the brink, clearly intent on going to war.  The Kaiser was indeed a nutty guy, and his explosive and unpredictable personality is well portrayed.I thought the story of Edward's childhood was well told.  Grooming him for his future as king wasn't handled well, much too demanding for the talents he had, but even so, he grew up to be a smart and insightful man, with keen foresight of the modern world.  The series didn't do more than briefly allude to his paramours, and that's too bad because a couple of them were confidants of long standing and remarkable women in their own right.If you decide to buy the DVD set, I think you'll enjoy the series from time to time because the history lessons are interesting, and the staging of many events gives us a look at the rooms these people lived in, the clothes they wore, the balls they attended, and a sense of how they conducted themselves.",4,Gets better as it goes along.,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,2149,"['series', 'young', 'Queen', 'Victoria', ""'ll"", 'comment', 'first', 'Victoria', 'was', 'formidable', 'monarch', 'stubborn', 'did', 'indeed', 'resist', 'giving', 'inch', 'delegating', 'power', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'series', 'petulant', 'often', 'unreasonable', 'childish', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'appraisal', 'more', 'subtle', 'approach', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'steeliness', 'making', 'caricature', 'was', 'odd', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'decision', 'shave', 'actress', 'hairline', 'forehead', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'bigger', 'Tudor', 'queen', 'Elizabeth', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Victoria', 'had', 'prominent', 'forehead', 'even', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'skipped', 'pointing', 'out', 'feature', ""n't"", 'one', 'people', 'think', 'when', 'conjure', 'up', 'image', 'mind', 'bad', 'time', 'screen', 'wonder', 'what', 'weird', 'appearance', 'about.The', 'series', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'family', 'connections', 'rulers', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'Denmark', 'Greece', 'how', 'groundwork', 'was', 'laid', 'future', 'revolutions', 'wars', 'actor', 'who', 'Kaiser', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'warmonger', 'teetering', 'brink', 'clearly', 'intent', 'going', 'war', 'Kaiser', 'was', 'indeed', 'nutty', 'guy', 'explosive', 'unpredictable', 'personality', 'well', 'portrayed.I', 'thought', 'story', 'Edward', 'childhood', 'was', 'well', 'told', 'Grooming', 'future', 'king', 'was', ""n't"", 'handled', 'well', 'much', 'too', 'demanding', 'talents', 'had', 'even', 'so', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'smart', 'insightful', 'man', 'keen', 'foresight', 'modern', 'world', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'briefly', 'allude', 'paramours', 'too', 'bad', 'couple', 'were', 'confidants', 'long', 'standing', 'remarkable', 'women', 'own', 'right.If', 'decide', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'series', 'time', 'time', 'history', 'lessons', 'are', 'interesting', 'staging', 'many', 'events', 'look', 'rooms', 'people', 'lived', 'clothes', 'wore', 'balls', 'attended', 'sense', 'how', 'conducted']",N/A

776812,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0000D0YWD,Stephanie De Pue,"[28, 29]","""Edward The King,"" a 1975 British television drama about the life of Edward VII of Great Britain, has just been released in a box set, consisting of four DVD's, that comprise the original thirteen episodes of the series.  It was originally broadcast in the U.K. as ""Edward the Seventh,"" and was aired in the U.S. on public television stations and major network affiliates in the late 1970s.  Evidently, it dates from the great age of British TV series, and like many of them, was made for Britain's ITV, Independent Television; it bears the hallmarks of those classic 1970's series: an all-star cast, tremendous production values - a cast of hundreds if not thousands, richly detailed sets and costumes.  It won an Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design and three BAFTA Awards, including Best Drama Series and Best Actress.  The box set boasts several special features; but, unfortunately, does not offer subtitles.Timothy West (Bleak House) stars as the title character, and does an extraordinary job of taking Edward from young adulthood through old age.  Annette Crosbie (Calendar Girls) costars as his remarkable mother, Queen Victoria, and must be said to do an equally remarkable job of taking her character from child-bearing young woman through old age.  Other stars include Felicity Kendal (Rosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series), Robert Hardy (All Creatures Great and Small: The Complete Collection), Charles Dance (Bleak House), Michael Holdern, and Sir John Gielgud.  Francesca Annis (Reckless), plays Lillie Langtry here, and was, in 1978, to play the well-known courtesan/actress again in her own estimable series, (Lillie).As you might expect with thirteen episodes, the series also bears that British hallmark of leisurely story-telling; some viewers might prefer to initially skip the first DVD, about Edward's rather miserable childhood, then double back to it.  Mind you, Edward's childhood was obviously privileged, in comparison with the rest of his country and his world, still, the poor young child was subject, from the age of seven, to a solitary and grueling educational program dreamed up by his father, Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort.  (To some of us, indeed, Albert seems overwhelmingly to be the source of some of the least pleasant features of the period that bears his wife's name, the Victorian.)Victoria was extremely long-lived: the celebration of her Diamond Jubilee (50 years as Queen), is shown in this production, and Edward waited nearly 60 years to become King.  During most of that wait, his mother refused to allow him to play any part in the governance of the nation, sentencing him to a life of skirt-chasing, and society pursuits.  He reigned for only nine years, from January 22, 1901, to May 6, 1910, continuing his philandering during that time.  Nevertheless, his nine year reign was influential, and its period is generally known as the Edwardian.  He did his level best to bring peace to Europe during his brief reign, but was, ultimately, unable to sufficiently influence his nephews, the German Kaiser Wilhelm, and the Russian Tsar Nicholas, and, four years after his death, World War I broke out, thereby putting an end to the leisurely luxurious Edwardian life the upper crust had enjoyed.  Despite his years of frivolity, he was very popular with his countrymen, and indeed, in Europe, and the Americas.  I was once, for whatever the reason, mooching through old ""New York Times"" microfiche, and came upon a story, published shortly after his death, that remarked that the black ebony earrings, then customarily worn by women in mourning (you certainly see them frequently in ""Edward""), had sold out in New York after his death, and were not available at any price.Anyone who is interested in history, be it British/European/world/political/military or royal, will find this an excellent, truly enjoyable picture of the period in question.

776814,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B0000D0YWD,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[157, 159]","Edward the King is a superb seventies' dramatisation of the life of Queen Victoria's son Bertie, the Prince of Wales, who went on to become King Edward VII in 1901.  The series (which consists of thirteen 50-minute episodes) is actually entitled Edward the Seventh (the title was for some reason changed to Edward the King on the packaging).  As for the dvd, there are no extras; and the quality of the picture/sound, although good, is not outstanding, and I don't think the series has been remastered.  Unfortunate as this may be, please don't be deterred on that account; the quality is as good as one would expect from any video and it is, after all, the content and the quality of the performance that is most important.The series covers the life of Bertie from his birth in 1841 through his coronation in 1901 and concludes with his death in 1910.  Though extremely privileged, Bertie had a stiflingly sheltered youth dominated by strict, controlling parents, which culminated in an all-but-arranged marriage to the beautiful Princess Alexandra of Denmark.  Because of their importance in shaping the character of the young prince, Victoria and Albert (played to absolute perfection by Annette Crosbie (One Foot in the Grave) and Robert Hardy (All Creatures)) are the primary focus of the first few episodes.  Victoria did not like to share her power, and her marriage felt the strain of such an inability to delegate (a situation which was not improved by her many temper tantrums!).  Ultimately, however, she was persuaded to share her power with her more-than-capable husband--something which, following Albert's death in 1861, she was sadly never to do with her son.  Ironically, when he finally succeeded to the throne, Bertie proved himself a very capable and level-headed ruler.Bertie (played commandingly by Timothy West) longed for responsibility in the government but, thanks to his mother, was destined for the most part to a life of idleness, which he filled libertinely with entertainment, cigars, and of course mistresses--most notably Alice Keppel and Lillie Langtry (portrayed by the beautiful Francesca Annis, who went on to reprise the role in 1979 with Lillie).  As the years pass, we see Bertie increasingly in the company of his mistresses.  I might just mention (for those with a particular interest in his many affaires du coeur) that his relationships are not the focus here; and certainly, the physical aspects are not delved into (ie. don't expect the gratuitous, explicit sexuality that seems to be a given in current period productions).The politics of the time are, as one would expect in any profile of a monarch, intertwined with the social and personal life of the individual, and we see over 70 years worth of prime ministers come and go--most notably Benjamin Disraeli (played by John Gielgud) and the perennial thorn in Victoria's side, William Gladstone.  We also see the rise to power of the highly unstable Kaiser Wilhelm II of Prussia, the son of Bertie's eldest sister Vicky (played wonderfully by Felicity Kendal (Good Neighbours)).  Because of his instability, Wilhelm is an increasingly important figure in Bertie's life.In conclusion, this is an outstanding production--one which is consummately acted by an all-star British cast, and which I'd recommend very highly to anyone who enjoys quality British period productions or to anyone with an interest in historical biography.  If you've enjoyed other classic series--like Lillie, the Pallisers, or Upstairs Downstairs, for example, this one is definitely worth checking out.Highly recommended.",5,An Outstanding Historical Biography!,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,3594,"['Edward', 'King', 'superb', 'seventies', 'dramatisation', 'life', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'son', 'Bertie', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', '1901', 'series', 'thirteen', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'actually', 'entitled', 'Edward', 'Seventh', 'title', 'was', 'reason', 'changed', 'Edward', 'King', 'packaging', 'dvd', 'are', 'extras', 'quality', 'picture/sound', 'good', 'not', 'outstanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'been', 'remastered', 'Unfortunate', 'may', 'be', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deterred', 'account', 'quality', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'video', 'content', 'quality', 'performance', 'most', 'important.The', 'series', 'life', 'Bertie', 'birth', '1841', 'coronation', '1901', 'death', '1910', 'extremely', 'privileged', 'Bertie', 'had', 'stiflingly', 'sheltered', 'youth', 'dominated', 'strict', 'controlling', 'parents', 'culminated', 'all-but-arranged', 'marriage', 'beautiful', 'Princess', 'Alexandra', 'Denmark', 'importance', 'shaping', 'character', 'young', 'prince', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'played', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'One', 'Foot', 'Grave', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'All', 'Creatures', 'are', 'primary', 'focus', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Victoria', 'did', 'not', 'share', 'power', 'marriage', 'felt', 'strain', 'such', 'inability', 'delegate', 'situation', 'was', 'not', 'improved', 'many', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'was', 'persuaded', 'share', 'power', 'more-than-capable', 'husband', 'something', 'following', 'Albert', 'death', '1861', 'was', 'sadly', 'never', 'do', 'son', 'Ironically', 'when', 'finally', 'succeeded', 'throne', 'Bertie', 'proved', 'very', 'capable', 'level-headed', 'ruler.Bertie', 'played', 'commandingly', 'Timothy', 'West', 'longed', 'responsibility', 'government', 'thanks', 'mother', 'was', 'destined', 'most', 'part', 'life', 'idleness', 'filled', 'libertinely', 'entertainment', 'cigars', 'course', 'mistresses', 'most', 'notably', 'Alice', 'Keppel', 'Lillie', 'Langtry', 'portrayed', 'beautiful', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'who', 'went', 'reprise', 'role', '1979', 'Lillie', 'years', 'pass', 'see', 'Bertie', 'increasingly', 'company', 'mistresses', 'might', 'just', 'mention', 'particular', 'interest', 'many', 'affaires', 'du', 'coeur', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'focus', 'here', 'certainly', 'physical', 'aspects', 'are', 'not', 'delved', 'ie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'gratuitous', 'explicit', 'sexuality', 'be', 'given', 'current', 'period', 'productions', '.The', 'politics', 'time', 'are', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'profile', 'monarch', 'intertwined', 'social', 'personal', 'life', 'individual', 'see', '70', 'years', 'prime', 'ministers', 'come', 'go', 'most', 'notably', 'Benjamin', 'Disraeli', 'played', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'perennial', 'thorn', 'Victoria', 'side', 'William', 'Gladstone', 'also', 'see', 'rise', 'power', 'highly', 'unstable', 'Kaiser', 'Wilhelm', 'II', 'Prussia', 'son', 'Bertie', 'eldest', 'sister', 'Vicky', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Felicity', 'Kendal', 'Good', 'Neighbours', 'instability', 'Wilhelm', 'increasingly', 'important', 'figure', 'Bertie', 'life.In', 'conclusion', 'outstanding', 'production', 'one', 'consummately', 'acted', 'all-star', 'British', 'cast', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'very', 'highly', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'British', 'period', 'productions', 'anyone', 'interest', 'historical', 'biography', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'other', 'classic', 'series', 'Lillie', 'Pallisers', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'example', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

And ""Edward the King"" does not fail to disappoint.The miniseries effectively covers the period from Edward's conception to his death in 1910.  Timothy West, from episode four of the series as the adult Prince of Wales and then all to brief King of England (with kudos to the young Charles Sturridge as the teenage Edward), does nothing less than a pull together a full transformation from feckless, scapegrace ""Champagne Prince"" to magesterial power-broker, portraying his Edward with great sympathy but with a keen eye upon his many faults, especially in the arena of romantic indiscretions.  But even his mistresses, especially Lillie Langtry, as played in a small but glittering performance by Francesca Annis, come across as human beings with whom the audience can easily empathize.  It would be all too easy to have Edward's sometime sad-sometime madcap life degenerate into a boring litany of one tawdry, sordid romantic escapade after another.  But in refusing that road, the miniseries both elevates and diminishes these larger than life personages to an understandable scale.  This is an Edward and a Victoria, an Albert the Good and Princess Dagmar (later Empress Maria of Russia) and a Queen Alexandra off pedestals and comprehensible, not wound up in pastry shell flummery.  And Sir John Gielgud's too-short depiction of Disraeli and Michael Hordern's Gladstone, as well as Helen Ryan's Queen Alexandra, all turn in wonderful performances, although that's hardly surprising.But, as mentioned, the standout is Annette Crosbie, in spades.  Her performance was a high-strung Victoria I could believe, and she does nothing less than steal every scene she enters.  And this is how it should be.  ""Bertie"" may have exasperated his mother, and Prince Albert may have often allowed Victoria to get on his ""last good nerve"" as he struggled to transform the moribund monarchy into a modern institution, but there is little doubt that in so many ways, they all danced to her whims while seeking to control her quirks and transform her into the legendary monarch she became.  And when Crosbie is on the screen, the reactions to her portrayal by the other perfomers are nothing less than pitch perfect.  With Crosbie at stage center, it is possible not to just enjoy her bravura and historically accurate performance, but to see how a true ensemble of fine actors works.Lastly, this miniseries is written in such a way as to be accessible to a wide swath of viewers without sacrificing one crumb of authenticity or intellectual vigor.  Whether for the Professor of English History or ""Everyman,"" ""Edward the King"" has something any lover of history or political drama will appreciate.Recommended without reservation.",5,Sensational,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,2876,"['Criticize', 'BBC', 'will', 'number', 'things', 'should', 'agree', 'consistent', 'standards', 'creating', 'epic', 'miniseries', 'are', 'rarely', 'matched', 'Edward', 'King', 'not', 'fail', 'disappoint.The', 'miniseries', 'effectively', 'period', 'Edward', 'conception', 'death', '1910', 'Timothy', 'West', 'episode', 'four', 'series', 'adult', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'then', 'brief', 'King', 'England', 'kudos', 'young', 'Charles', 'Sturridge', 'teenage', 'Edward', 'nothing', 'less', 'pull', 'together', 'full', 'transformation', 'feckless', 'scapegrace', 'Champagne', 'Prince', 'magesterial', 'power-broker', 'portraying', 'Edward', 'great', 'sympathy', 'keen', 'eye', 'many', 'faults', 'especially', 'arena', 'romantic', 'indiscretions', 'even', 'mistresses', 'especially', 'Lillie', 'Langtry', 'played', 'small', 'glittering', 'performance', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'come', 'human', 'beings', 'whom', 'audience', 'can', 'easily', 'empathize', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'have', 'Edward', 'sometime', 'sad-sometime', 'madcap', 'life', 'degenerate', 'boring', 'litany', 'one', 'tawdry', 'sordid', 'romantic', 'escapade', 'refusing', 'road', 'miniseries', 'elevates', 'diminishes', 'larger', 'life', 'personages', 'understandable', 'scale', 'Edward', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'Good', 'Princess', 'Dagmar', 'later', 'Empress', 'Maria', 'Russia', 'Queen', 'Alexandra', 'pedestals', 'comprehensible', 'not', 'wound', 'up', 'pastry', 'shell', 'flummery', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'too-short', 'depiction', 'Disraeli', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'Gladstone', 'as', 'well', 'Helen', 'Ryan', 'Queen', 'Alexandra', 'turn', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'hardly', 'surprising.But', 'mentioned', 'standout', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'spades', 'performance', 'was', 'high-strung', 'Victoria', 'could', 'believe', 'nothing', 'less', 'steal', 'scene', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'Bertie', 'may', 'have', 'exasperated', 'mother', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'may', 'have', 'often', 'allowed', 'Victoria', 'get', 'last', 'good', 'nerve', 'struggled', 'transform', 'moribund', 'monarchy', 'modern', 'institution', 'little', 'doubt', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'danced', 'whims', 'seeking', 'control', 'quirks', 'transform', 'legendary', 'monarch', 'became', 'when', 'Crosbie', 'screen', 'reactions', 'portrayal', 'other', 'perfomers', 'are', 'nothing', 'less', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Crosbie', 'stage', 'center', 'possible', 'not', 'just', 'enjoy', 'bravura', 'historically', 'accurate', 'performance', 'see', 'how', 'true', 'ensemble', 'fine', 'actors', 'works.Lastly', 'miniseries', 'written', 'such', 'way', 'be', 'accessible', 'wide', 'swath', 'viewers', 'sacrificing', 'one', 'crumb', 'authenticity', 'intellectual', 'vigor', 'Whether', 'Professor', 'English', 'History', 'Everyman', 'Edward', 'King', 'something', 'lover', 'history', 'political', 'drama', 'will', 'appreciate.Recommended', 'reservation']",N/A
