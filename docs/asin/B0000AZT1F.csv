Unfortunately, though it tries hard, The Safety Of Objects does not quite measure up.  Yes, it has an ensemble cast of skilled actors & actresses, but this strongest aspect of the film fails to really bring the movie home to the viewer.  Some of the characters are almost stereotypical, diminishing the sense of mystery surrounding their pain; others just aren't developed enough to fully engage our empathy.  Some aspects of the movie are a stretch, i.e., the son's involvement with his sister's doll, though this can be seen allegorically.  But the ending, with no real surprises here, and no breakthrough insight into the characters' dilemmas or into life in general, ends caustically with one of the mothers murdering her son in her ""breakthrough"" moment, offensive and untenable.  I paid close attention to this movie and tried hard to like it, but overall it came across like a vehicle in poor running condition, never really reaching its destination.",2,this car needs a tune-up,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,1146,"['***SPOILER', 'ALERT***Movies', 'have', 'sets', 'characters', 'intertwining', 'stories', 'require', 'tremendous', 'skill', 'be', 'successful', 'seeMagnolia', 'New', 'Line', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'tremendous', 'example', 'Unfortunately', 'hard', 'Safety', 'Objects', 'not', 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'Yes', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'skilled', 'actors', 'actresses', 'strongest', 'aspect', 'film', 'really', 'bring', 'movie', 'home', 'viewer', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'stereotypical', 'diminishing', 'sense', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'pain', 'others', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough', 'fully', 'engage', 'empathy', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'stretch', 'i.e.', 'son', 'involvement', 'sister', 'doll', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'allegorically', 'ending', 'real', 'surprises', 'here', 'breakthrough', 'insight', 'characters', 'dilemmas', 'life', 'general', 'caustically', 'one', 'mothers', 'murdering', 'son', 'breakthrough', 'moment', 'offensive', 'untenable', 'paid', 'close', 'attention', 'movie', 'tried', 'hard', 'like', 'overall', 'came', 'vehicle', 'poor', 'running', 'condition', 'never', 'really', 'reaching', 'destination']",N/A
769163,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,B0000AZT1F,bowery boy,"[4, 5]","I really wanted to like this film.  I really did.  The theatrical trailer looked promising, the ensemble cast of excellent actors excited me and the surreal quality of the cinematography was stunning. However, the film falls apart halfway through, but not for a lack of trying. All the actors give excellent performances and the direction was interesting. It was the story that was a bit thin.  After the first hour the movie becomes a bit contrived and collapsed under its over ambitious weight. If I had to hear Paul's Song one more time, I swear I was going to pull out what little bit of hair I have left on my head. In its attempt to be another American Beauty-esque slice of suburban life, The Safety of Objects becomes a caricature of itself. Even though the acting is top notch it's hard to care about the characters in this incestuous (not in the true sense of the word) suburban neighborhood.  Who cares that Annette was sleeping with Paul? Who cares about Jim's unexplained reason for helping Esther win a car? I quickly lost interest with the exception of the kid in love with his sister's Barbie doll.  Well needed comic relief in an otherwise drab film. The only jaw dropping revelation I experienced was Esther's guilt inducing reason for keeping her comatose son alive. The Safety of Objects probably was better as a collection of short stories than one cohesive film. One of the review blurbs on the cover says ""Comical!"" and I agree although not in a good way.  See this film for great performances from Glenn Close, Patricia Clarkson, Dermot Mulroney and the like but check out the Ice Storm, American Beauty or Magnolia for excellent examples of suburbia slice-of-life films in the intertwined multi-character plotline vein.",3,3 stars for the acting - 1/2 star for the plot = 2 1/2 stars,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,1744,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'looked', 'promising', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'excellent', 'actors', 'excited', 'surreal', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'was', 'stunning', 'However', 'film', 'apart', 'halfway', 'not', 'lack', 'trying', 'actors', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'direction', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'thin', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'bit', 'contrived', 'collapsed', 'ambitious', 'weight', 'had', 'hear', 'Paul', 'Song', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'swear', 'was', 'going', 'pull', 'out', 'what', 'little', 'bit', 'hair', 'have', 'left', 'head', 'attempt', 'be', 'American', 'Beauty-esque', 'slice', 'suburban', 'life', 'Safety', 'Objects', 'caricature', 'Even', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'hard', 'care', 'characters', 'incestuous', 'not', 'true', 'sense', 'word', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'Who', 'Annette', 'was', 'sleeping', 'Paul', 'Who', 'Jim', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'helping', 'Esther', 'win', 'car', 'quickly', 'lost', 'interest', 'exception', 'kid', 'love', 'sister', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'Well', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'otherwise', 'drab', 'film', 'only', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'revelation', 'experienced', 'was', 'Esther', 'guilt', 'inducing', 'reason', 'keeping', 'comatose', 'son', 'alive', 'Safety', 'Objects', 'probably', 'was', 'better', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'one', 'cohesive', 'film', 'One', 'review', 'blurbs', 'cover', 'Comical', 'agree', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'See', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'like', 'check', 'out', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Magnolia', 'excellent', 'examples', 'suburbia', 'slice-of-life', 'films', 'intertwined', 'multi-character', 'plotline', 'vein']",N/A

Nice performances and movie making in general, although I think Joshua Jackson phoned in his role as ""the unconscious guy"". Haha. (Ok, so thats only funny if you've seen it.) I love the opening credits in this piece- the cuckoo clock-esque characters in their cookie cutter houses... and the little figure mowing the lawn... its almost worth a rent just for that. I think the problem with this story is that its nothing new and its really not very timely. The exposure of middle class suburbia as being less than paradise has been done and didnt strike a chord with me like other works in this genre have. I did like the way the characters were intertwined and the piecing it all together. Its similar to ""Love Actually"" in the multi-story layerings, but like ""Love Actually"" only a couple of those stories were interesting. The only character who actively engaged me was Randy the Poolboy. He was the most complex story in my opinion, but then is just left hanging at the end.

769167,A1MIJKZQ1MIRBM,B0000AZT1F,C. Law,"[4, 9]","Like MAGNOLIA and several other films released recently, THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS attempts to take a number of stories about life in suburbia and mold them into a single, interlocking narrative. However, the result is a mess.While the film boasts a good ensemble of talented actors (Glenn Close, Joshua Jackson, Dermot Mulroney, Timothy Olyphant, Jessica Campbell, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Klein, Moira Kelly, and others) who deliver relatively good performances, the film doesn't seem to have enough for all of them to do. And what they are allowed to do doesn't always make sense. For example, Dermot Mulroney's character becomes obsessed with helping Glenn Close's character win an SUV contest in a local mall instead of mending his on the brink relationship with his family. Why does he do this? I have absolutely no idea and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. There just doesn't seem to be a good reason for it.While I'll admit I was engrossed by the story as it unfolded, it was because I was waiting for a bigger payoff. Something that didn't seem so purposeless. The film does bring up some good points here and there but in the end the only thing that seems memorable about the film is Paul's Song by Bullet and Jessica Campbell that is constantly played throughout the film as if to help tie everything nicely together. As a matter of fact, the song, at times, almost convinced me that I liked the film more than I really did but in the end, it was just the song I was in to, not the movie.""In the morning, I hear the angels. They kiss our faces to help you smile. Oh, help me. We never touch. Please, remember I still believe in something beautiful. And you are all I need. Lift me up.

Just as in her book by the same name, there are many stories happening simultaneously and in the film adaptation they all interrelate even more closely than the book suggested.  This is the suburbia madness Homes knows so well - four familties living adajacently and bonded in various degrees by the near fatal auto accident of Paul Gold, a youth in his prime who touched the lives of more people than he knew. In the film he continues in a vegetative state, binding his caregiving mother (Close), offering food for longing for his secret lover (Clarkson), and providing a seemingly endless search for normalcy by the one in the accident who wasn't physically injured (Olyphant). Secrets, longings, and fantasies  play strong roles in the lives of all of the characters who are very realistically written and acted and it is to Rose Troche's credit that she keeps us involved and guessing until the final frame.

I must also say that, despite the fact that I liked it enough to give it three stars, you have seen this film before. Where? It is the same type of suburban-angst-gone-haywire plot you've seen in such films as American Beauty. If that is your sort of film, then this is your sort of film. If that is not your cup of tea, then this will not be either.The film is the story of 4 suburban families who have much more in common than first blush would tell you. All of them are somehow intertwined with a the fate of one of the families' comatose sons. (One character was in the car that injured him, another was the boys lover, etc.) It is the story, then, of how each family copes in different ways with that, and a host of other suburbanesque goings on, like being passed up for a promotion, dealing with the possible kidnapping of a daughter, or fumbling, as an adolescent, through one's first sexual feelings.While the film, as I've said before, takes bizarre (and often unrealistic) twists and turns in the manner of American Beauty, ""The Safety of Objects"" has a strangely likeable quality. Like ""American Beauty,"" the characters and story lines are just quirky enough to grab you without being so strange as to let you go. None of the characters are overtly lovable or dispicable, but all of them are at the very least, interesting and at most, compelling.Be that as it may, though, the film is still a bit too cliche to be of any but moderate interest. Too many films - American Beauty, Short Cuts, The Good Girl, etc. - portray the same type of 'off-the-deep-end' suburban situations that this film does better, and more convincingly, than this film does it.In fact, it is disappointing to find out that this film is based on a collection of short stories by author A.M. Holmes, because another film called ""Short Cuts"" is the same idea, only involving the stories of Raymond Carver. And just as Carver is a superior writer to Holmes, ""Short Cuts"" is heads-and-tails superior to ""The Safety of Objects.""But if you like suburbia-gone-angry-and-awry films like ""American Beauty,"" then this film is at least worth one viewing.

Unfortunately, it was a sterile production, as none of the characters really grab the viewer emotionally. The normal rules of engagement seem to be lacking, leaving the viewer with the sense of having seen a shell of what was potentially a good film. Instead, the viewer gets a film with a few good hurrahs amidst a motley reel of celluloid. It is an ambitious film that does not see its ambitions realized.Adapted from a book of short stories by A. H. Holmes, the film attempts to weave these short stories into a collective, cohesive narrative.  It is a strained effort, at best.  It gives an ostensible slice of suburban angst through the stories of four middle class families, neighbors in a suburban community. All have some connection to a car accident that severely injured the son of one of these families, causing him to remain in a vegetative state.The film plods along, unraveling the accident in tortuous fashion as it takes the viewer to the final denouement. Some of the characters behave inexplicably without rhyme or reason as to why they would behave in such a fashion, leaving the viewer to wonder why. While the reasons may be of interest, there is not a clue as to such. It may simply be that the author's interrelated short stories simply did not adapt well to film, despite best efforts to make it into a cohesive entity.Yet, a pre-pubescent boy  talks to his sister's Barbie doll, believing that they have some kind of relationship, and he believes that Barbie talks back to him.  A man whose marital relationship is on the brink of disaster leaves his wife and family at a critical juncture in order to help a neighbor try to win an SUV contest at a local mall. Why they act in this fashion is the question. The answer is entirely shrouded and obscure, so that the viewer is left puzzled and  grasping at straws, in the end not really caring at all why.So, despite excellent performances by the cast, the film is torpid at best, staying afloat simply because of the efforts of the cast not to go down with a sinking ship. The stories of the characters themselves simply cannot sustain the film sufficiently, despite the valiant efforts of the cast and the director. It is a somewhat depressing film that is unable to break away from its own inherent torpor.

All the screenwriter had to do was connect the stories.  Right?Wrong.Problem is, the film just tells some surface stories.

Although an ensemble effort, Glenn Close provides the emotional core of the film as Esther Gold, the mother of troubled teen Julie (Jessica Campbell) and comatose Paul (Joshua Jackson).Paul's story is told in flashback, and it ties together the film's characters. The neighbors face their own trials, as Jim Train (Dermot Mulroney) faces a career crisis and Annette Jennings (Patricia Clarkson) copes with serial abandonment. More families and sub-stories bubble up, including a disturbingly hilarious romance between a boy (Alex House) and his sister's Barbie doll.Like Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts,"" which weaves together a selection of Raymond Carver stories, ""The Safety of Objects"" overlaps tales from A.M. Homes' short-story collection of the same name. ""Objects"" accomplishes the singular feat of adapting Homes' insular material while showcasing the director's own sense of intimacy and thematic structure.Director Rose Troche has crafted a gothic suburban tale about how life affects us all. She presents it with such confidence and care, that we love all of the characters, even if we don't like them.The movie is unsettling because it refuses to view its characters from a reassuring, judgmental distance, allowing us to see what we normally wouldn't, and shouldn't.

All are dealing with problems common to many families and not so common to others. Troche has the dynamics of family right but instead of keeping her scope small and concentrated, she has decided to go for the Universal, the big picture and unfortunately it is here where she stumbles.&#65533;TSOO&#65533; wears it&#65533;s heart on it&#65533;s sleeve, metaphorically speaking&#65533;beginning with the title: we get attached to our &#65533;things&#65533; and when they are broken, or thrown away or lost we feel upset, feel lost, etc. Several of the characters in this film specifically state as much thereby pounding home Troche&#65533;s central theme in case any of us missed it the first time.If Troche had stuck to the central core of the film: a horrific accident that affects all three families she would have had a tighter, stronger, more emphatic film.

I mean, we're talking major starpower here, and Troche blended them together to achieve something close to perfection. The story centers on four star-studded suburban families, a mysterious auto accident, and a contest that involves keeping your hand on a car longer than anyone else. Oh, and it was all written by the sick, twisted, brilliant novelist A. M. Homes. How could you possibly go wrong?The Golds-- mother Esther (Glenn Close, giving a career-best Brandoesque performance),father Howard (Robert Klein),  daughter Julie (Election's delicious chanteuse Jessica Campbell), and son Paul (Dawson's Creek alum Joshua Jackson)-- are the cornerstone of the piece. Paul was a victim of the car accident, and now spends his life in a coma. His mother dotes on him, his father can't bear to look at him, and his sister, well, she's a completely different story. Their next door neighbors are the Jennings. Mom (indie darling Patricia Clarkson, who is never less than great) is still perilously close to the edge a year after her husband (TV staple Andrew Airlie) left, raising a delinquent (Panic Room's Kristen Stewart) and a girl (Haylee Wanstall, recently found in Sugar) who is in some way mentally challenged; it's never said, but it looks like autism. Also involved are the Trains-- father Jim (Dermot Mulroney), mother Susan (Moira Kelly), and their two kids, and the Christensens, notably mom Helen (Mary Kay Place). All the moms want to sleep with the gardener (Timothy Olyphant). Okay, can you see the starpower radiating yet?As with most of Homes' work, the idea here is that modern suburbia is weird. Very, very weird. Little, normal incidents grow into crises of insane proportions. Assumptions are pushed to their logical conclusions and coincide with completely irrational behavior, so that everything looks normal when it is anything but. And eventually, of course, it all begins to break down. Troche keeps the viewer's interest by being extremely coy about the details surrounding the car accident that sets everything in the story into motion, revealing piece by piece in flashback what it is that everyone's hiding, or guilty about, or sick of seeing over and over again in their heads. Meanwhile, present-day life is going on, and it's just as strange. Eventually, it all makes sense, but you have so much fun getting there that by the end, you wouldn't be terribly peeved had some of the pieces never fallen into place.This is fantastic stuff.

769183,A3SHQXNOPZBJH,B0000AZT1F,Robert Byrd,"[1, 3]","Large ensemble pieces like this take a great deal of directing skill, ala Robert Altman, that this filmmaker obviously did not have.  The movement between stories of three different families and several individuals was awkward at best and completely muddled at worst.  I also found myself not caring about these people, who struck me as uninteresting, unbelievable and unengaging.  In addition, most of the actors, with the exception of the often wonderful Patricia Clarkson, either overacted or felt like cardboard cutouts of their characters.  This was an abyssmally bad and silly film that should have gone straight to video with a warning on its cover that read ""For less than mature audiences only.""",1,A Confused Mess!!!,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,704,"['Large', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'take', 'great', 'deal', 'directing', 'skill', 'ala', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'filmmaker', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'movement', 'stories', 'three', 'different', 'families', 'several', 'individuals', 'was', 'awkward', 'best', 'completely', 'muddled', 'worst', 'also', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'people', 'who', 'struck', 'uninteresting', 'unbelievable', 'unengaging', 'addition', 'most', 'actors', 'exception', 'often', 'wonderful', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'either', 'overacted', 'felt', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'characters', 'was', 'abyssmally', 'bad', 'silly', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'straight', 'video', 'warning', 'cover', 'read', 'less', 'mature', 'audiences', 'only']",N/A

If is says anything, I stayed up way too late so I could see it without a break.  I liked the way the stories were woven together and that the director cast such an amazing line-up of actors.The actor who surprised me was Dermot Mulroney.  I enjoy just seeing him on film. He usually plays guys who are pretty self-assured but this guy was going through a mid-life crisis.  Even though he might have been a bit over the top, it was an endearing performance.  I think it was better than anything else I've seen him in.Parts of this film were poignant and sad, but there was also the humor of the young boy and his sister's doll.

769185,A3CH1KT8XQE8SA,B0000AZT1F,"S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[3, 4]","Adapted from A.H. Homes's book of short stories, THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS follows three upper middle-class suburban families that appear to be in the midst of existential crisis as they venture about their normal day-to-day routines. Behind the nice homes, swimming pools, and luxury cars these characters are suffering from grief, pain, heartache and remorse. The viewer constantly gets the feeling that he/she should empathize with these sullen characters but something is amiss. I just couldn't `get' into this film. Character motivations fail to be explained and the overall message is so clouded that I left the theatre wondering what I just saw. Some scenes and dialogue are comical, but is this intended? If the intention of THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS is to suggest that The American Dream (i.e., home ownership in a safe community) has gone desperately off course then this film lacks the final `punch' that it should have driven into the consciousness of the audience. Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to enjoy this film after seeing the trailers multiple times in the theatre. The cast of actors is impressive and I have previously enjoyed the stories of A.H. Homes but this film failed to engage me. I felt disappointed because I wanted more. I wish I could sing praises for THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS but cannot.
