There are many tropes to be found in the story such as the man hating principle, sycophant assistant principle, the (annoyingly) cute girl, the tough guy (with the heart of gold), the school uniform obsessed guys, and so on. To be honest I was kind of disturbed by the various pantsu shots (as these girls are supposed to be only 13 to 14 years old) but there were not too many of them. the love quadrangle towards the end is done pretty well, in fact the story telling was not all that bad considering that this is supposed to be a comedy. The only problem I had with the entire series was with the ending. I do not want to give too much away but if you are looking for a happy or uplifting ending - keep searching. Overall I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bit of light-hearted fun with a ""realistic"" ending.",5,I My Me Strawberry Eggs Complete,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,1002,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'anime', 'improbable', 'situation', 'most', 'do', 'around', 'rather', 'serious', 'conclusion', 'are', 'many', 'tropes', 'be', 'found', 'story', 'such', 'man', 'hating', 'principle', 'sycophant', 'assistant', 'principle', 'annoyingly', 'cute', 'girl', 'tough', 'guy', 'heart', 'gold', 'school', 'uniform', 'obsessed', 'guys', 'so', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'kind', 'disturbed', 'various', 'pantsu', 'shots', 'girls', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'only', '13', '14', 'years', 'old', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'love', 'quadrangle', 'end', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'fact', 'story', 'telling', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'considering', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'ending', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'are', 'looking', 'happy', 'uplifting', 'ending', 'keep', 'searching', 'Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'bit', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'realistic', 'ending']",Strawberry Eggs I My Me: Absent - Volume 4

I have to admit that while I liked the ending, a few things did leave me going ""oh please... that's farfetched even for THIS anime"". The jig is finally up for Hibiki in this volume & he's forced to come clean to everyone. Understandably, everyone is pretty upset about this, especially considering that the male Hibiki's already been labeled as a pervert by so many different people. Not to worry, as a suitably happy enough ending is in order. (It's not quite what you'd expect, though.)There were a few things that kind of had me shaking my head, though. The biggest thing was what caused the Principal to become such a man hater to begin with & Lulu's implied role in the matter. (spoilers in the comments section) Even so, this anime is decent enough to where most fans will be able to enjoy it. It's not a particularly deep series, but it's never really ever portrayed itself as such.3.5/4",3,"Ok ending, a little silly but still decent",1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,964,"['months', 'waiting', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'end', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'liked', 'ending', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'leave', 'going', 'oh', 'please', 'farfetched', 'even', 'THIS', 'anime', 'jig', 'finally', 'up', 'Hibiki', 'volume', 'forced', 'come', 'clean', 'everyone', 'Understandably', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'upset', 'especially', 'considering', 'male', 'Hibiki', 'already', 'been', 'labeled', 'pervert', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'people', 'Not', 'worry', 'suitably', 'happy', 'enough', 'ending', 'order', 'not', 'quite', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'kind', 'had', 'shaking', 'head', 'though', 'biggest', 'thing', 'was', 'what', 'caused', 'Principal', 'become', 'such', 'man', 'hater', 'begin', 'Lulu', 'implied', 'role', 'matter', 'spoilers', 'comments', 'section', 'Even', 'so', 'anime', 'decent', 'enough', 'where', 'most', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'not', 'particularly', 'deep', 'series', 'never', 'really', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'such.3.5/4']",Strawberry Eggs I My Me: Absent - Volume 4

731066,A3TRWCKDLYECZ2,B00007L4L2,Gryphon,"[4, 4]","A very funny comedy about a newly graduated gym teacher trying to find a job.  Unfortunately he doesn't have much luck finding a job and he finally runs out of money about the time he gets an apartment near a junior high school. He's determined to get a job there as a gym teacher but the school has a principal and vice-principal who are misandrists, being very prejudiced against men and refuse to hire them as teachers.Fortunately for the main character, Hibiki, when he expresses his determination to get a job there in spite of that, his new landlady offers to help him get that job by teaching him how to dress and act just like a woman so the principal will hire him.  After some ""hard knocks"" training from his landlady, he lands the gym teacher job as a woman gym teacher.  From there on things start to get really funny as he gets caught up in all kinds of ticklish situations while trying to hide his true gender and also do his best to care about all his students while trying to teach them the really important things in life like responsibility, true friendship, selflessness, commitment, honesty, courage, acceptance of differences, compassion and heart.There are a lot of laughs in this series but also a lot of heart and some good life lessons as well as some really touching moments.  While the ending may seem bitter-sweet, it offers hope for the future for the two main characters.  Definitely a series that is worth the time and money.  It's unfortunate they didn't make a sequel.Sound and video quality in this particular collection are excellent.If you enjoyed the movie Tootsie, you'll probably enjoy this series too.",5,"Tootsie, Japanese style!

731068,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B00007L4L2,Michael Valdivielso,"[7, 7]","The DVD starts off with every lover's dream.  In the first episode Fuko saves the woman she loves, Hibiki, from a burning building.  In doing so she does give away the fact that she loves Hibiki, right in front of Akira, who loves her, and Fujio, who loves Akira.In the hospital, Hibiki realizes, that yes, he loves Fuko, but that Fuko loves the FEMALE Hibiki.  He just can't keep living a lie, being a fake teacher.  As he changes himself back to a man, little does he know that the Vice is in another wing of the hospital, acting like a peeking tom (which is usually played by male characters) with a camera.  In the end he is exposed by the Vice-Principal as the male he is.Now, he could of tricked them one last time but he DECIDED it was time to be honest with his students and leave.  Being the character Hibiki is, there was really no other choice.Ba-chan brings up an interesting point which he ignores: Does being a fake teacher mean that the lessons about life he passed on to the students was also fake?The whole last episode deals with the events after he is exposed.  A WHOLE episode dealing with the end of a series which had only 12 episodes.  By the 13th most series are just starting to warm up, but Strawberry Eggs is ending on a high note.  A powerful little series.That is the best part about the ending, is that it feels so powerful and so perfect for the characters.  Hibiki has to leave, but promises to return.  Fuko still loves him and you get the impression she will wait for him.  The other students have developed bonds of trust, friendship and, yes, even love.  The school's students, and their parents, have decided to keep the school co-ed, against the wishes of the Principal and Vice-Principal.  And we learn something about Ba-chan.Many people may wish for a stronger ending, some kind of closure, but this is the best they will get.  Maybe not a happy, happy, joy, joy ending, but it is a good ending.  A solid ending.  An ending that suggests the characters will live on, grow, change and find happiness.  It even suggests hope (with a little help from Ba-chan) for the Principal!",5,The end of a great series.,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,2116,"['DVD', 'lover', 'dream', 'first', 'episode', 'Fuko', 'woman', 'Hibiki', 'burning', 'building', 'doing', 'so', 'give', 'away', 'fact', 'Hibiki', 'right', 'front', 'Akira', 'who', 'Fujio', 'who', 'Akira.In', 'hospital', 'Hibiki', 'yes', 'Fuko', 'Fuko', 'FEMALE', 'Hibiki', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'living', 'lie', 'being', 'fake', 'teacher', 'back', 'man', 'little', 'know', 'Vice', 'wing', 'hospital', 'acting', 'peeking', 'tom', 'usually', 'played', 'male', 'characters', 'camera', 'end', 'exposed', 'Vice-Principal', 'male', 'could', 'tricked', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'DECIDED', 'was', 'time', 'be', 'honest', 'students', 'leave', 'Being', 'character', 'Hibiki', 'was', 'really', 'other', 'choice.Ba-chan', 'brings', 'up', 'interesting', 'point', 'Does', 'being', 'fake', 'teacher', 'mean', 'lessons', 'life', 'passed', 'students', 'was', 'also', 'fake', 'whole', 'last', 'episode', 'deals', 'events', 'exposed', 'WHOLE', 'episode', 'dealing', 'end', 'series', 'had', 'only', '12', 'episodes', '13th', 'most', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'warm', 'up', 'Strawberry', 'Eggs', 'ending', 'high', 'note', 'powerful', 'little', 'best', 'part', 'ending', 'so', 'powerful', 'so', 'perfect', 'characters', 'Hibiki', 'leave', 'return', 'Fuko', 'still', 'get', 'impression', 'will', 'wait', 'other', 'students', 'have', 'developed', 'bonds', 'trust', 'friendship', 'yes', 'even', 'love', 'school', 'students', 'parents', 'have', 'decided', 'keep', 'school', 'co-ed', 'wishes', 'Principal', 'Vice-Principal', 'learn', 'something', 'Ba-chan.Many', 'people', 'may', 'wish', 'stronger', 'ending', 'kind', 'closure', 'best', 'will', 'get', 'Maybe', 'not', 'happy', 'happy', 'joy', 'joy', 'ending', 'good', 'ending', 'solid', 'ending', 'ending', 'characters', 'will', 'live', 'grow', 'change', 'find', 'happiness', 'even', 'hope', 'little', 'help', 'Ba-chan', 'Principal']",Strawberry Eggs I My Me: Absent - Volume 4
