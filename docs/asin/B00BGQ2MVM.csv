1634590,AQ4J8ZO1DRUF2,B00BGQ2MVM,Balbanes,"[0, 0]","For fans of Chazz Palminteri this movie is a must. He plays an abusive father with good intentions but his temper always gets the best of him. His character is a mix of his normal gangsteresque persona and the lunatic Phil from Hurlyburly. The story is decent but is left unresolved by the end, what shines are the characters relationships with one another and several fantastic scenes from Palminteri. This movie was a hidden gem for me, Palminteri's character was simply great.",5,Chazz Palminteri Shines,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,479,"['fans', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'movie', 'must', 'abusive', 'father', 'good', 'intentions', 'temper', 'always', 'best', 'character', 'mix', 'normal', 'gangsteresque', 'persona', 'lunatic', 'Phil', 'Hurlyburly', 'story', 'decent', 'left', 'unresolved', 'end', 'what', 'shines', 'are', 'characters', 'relationships', 'one', 'several', 'fantastic', 'scenes', 'Palminteri', 'movie', 'was', 'hidden', 'gem', 'Palminteri', 'character', 'was', 'simply', 'great']",Mighty Fine
1634591,A38GVBWEB58UAO,B00BGQ2MVM,Cary B. Barad,"[0, 0]","This movie starts with an interesting sociological premise regarding a clash of cultures in the mid 1970's. Specifically, a tough-talking Brooklyn, NY factory owner and his family relocate to a more laid back, racially sensitive Southern state. There are business issues and family conflicts that also generate dramatic interest. Unfortunately, the film ends prematurely on a rather abrupt note. This means that a major plot element is left unresolved to the detriment of the viewer.",3,"""Abrupt Ending""",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,483,"['movie', 'interesting', 'sociological', 'premise', 'regarding', 'clash', 'cultures', 'mid', '1970', 'Specifically', 'tough-talking', 'Brooklyn', 'NY', 'factory', 'owner', 'family', 'relocate', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'racially', 'sensitive', 'Southern', 'state', 'are', 'business', 'issues', 'family', 'conflicts', 'also', 'generate', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'prematurely', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'note', 'major', 'plot', 'element', 'left', 'unresolved', 'detriment', 'viewer']",Mighty Fine
