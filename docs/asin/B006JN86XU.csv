1516309,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B006JN86XU,Charlie Brooks,"[0, 0]","The 2011 Giants' season doesn't get quite the level of respect that it deserves thanks to the fact that the Giants completed an equally miraculous season only one year prior. Still, this video does a good job of tracking the trials and tribulations of a rough regular season and then showcasing how the Giants inexplicably became a post-season juggernaut once again, beating the top three teams in the league and winning their second Super Bowl trophy in five years.It's worth noting that this video doesn't get everything about the season, and if you followed the team during this crazy time you probably can spot a few potential storylines that got left out. I think it's worth giving NFL Films a pass on this simply because there was so much in the Giants' season. What is included is fantastic, and they capture 90% of what made the season great.I do think that more historical significance should have been brought up when it came to the Super Bowl, however. Once again, the Giants faced the Patriots. This was supposed to be New England's revenge game for having their perfect season foiled in Super Bowl XLII. Tom Brady started the game absolutely on fire, setting a Super Bowl record for consecutive completions before Justin Tuck knocked him out of his groove. The two Giants/Patriots Super Bowls were instant classics and have a huge historical significance that this DVD misses. Still, it does capture the game itself well, including the perfect Manning to Manningham pass that sparked the game-winning drive.Overall, this is a good purchase for Giants fans. It's not perfect, but it's a great way of capturing the wonders of yet another Super Bowl season for the New York Football Giants.",4,A good review of a great season,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,1700,"['2011', 'Giants', 'season', ""n't"", 'get', 'quite', 'level', 'respect', 'thanks', 'fact', 'Giants', 'completed', 'equally', 'miraculous', 'season', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'prior', 'Still', 'video', 'good', 'job', 'tracking', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'rough', 'regular', 'season', 'then', 'showcasing', 'how', 'Giants', 'inexplicably', 'became', 'post-season', 'juggernaut', 'once', 'again', 'beating', 'top', 'three', 'teams', 'league', 'winning', 'second', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'trophy', 'five', 'years.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'video', ""n't"", 'get', 'everything', 'season', 'followed', 'team', 'crazy', 'time', 'probably', 'can', 'spot', 'few', 'potential', 'storylines', 'got', 'left', 'out', 'think', 'worth', 'giving', 'NFL', 'Films', 'pass', 'simply', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'Giants', 'season', 'What', 'included', 'fantastic', 'capture', '90', '%', 'what', 'made', 'season', 'great.I', 'do', 'think', 'more', 'historical', 'significance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'when', 'came', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'however', 'Once', 'again', 'Giants', 'faced', 'Patriots', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'New', 'England', 'revenge', 'game', 'having', 'perfect', 'season', 'foiled', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLII', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'started', 'game', 'absolutely', 'fire', 'setting', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'record', 'consecutive', 'completions', 'Justin', 'Tuck', 'knocked', 'groove', 'two', 'Giants/Patriots', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'were', 'instant', 'classics', 'have', 'huge', 'historical', 'significance', 'DVD', 'Still', 'capture', 'game', 'well', 'including', 'perfect', 'Manning', 'Manningham', 'pass', 'sparked', 'game-winning', 'drive.Overall', 'good', 'purchase', 'Giants', 'fans', 'not', 'perfect', 'great', 'way', 'capturing', 'wonders', 'yet', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'season', 'New', 'York', 'Football', 'Giants']",NFL Super Bowl XLVI Champions: 2011 New York Giants

Unfortunately because their regular season form was so patchy the producers have decided to try and skate over some of the defeats by just showing Giants touchdowns without mentioning the scores in the games at the time the TD's occurred. This kills any suspense or tension because you have no idea how significant the touchdown was in the course of the game. Fortunately once you get to the important end of season games and playoffs the coverage is better and you're always aware of what the score is when a significant play occurs adding to the enjoyment.

Regardless, his terrible rookie-like mistakes cost the NE Patriots the Superbowl and handed Eli Manning an extra ring.  Could the Patriots won in spite of Brady? maybe if they got really, really lucky and had a healthy Gronkowski.  I give the Pats credit for being in a semi-rebuilding year and still making the Superbowl, but I give the Giants credit for not making any big mistakes.  And while I admit that Manning's not an elite quarterback, he didn't make any big mistakes.  And that is what you want out of your quarterback.  Period.

1516328,A1E69UVO7G0122,B006JN86XU,Tony Lewis,"[27, 32]","This is an ACTUAL review of the DVD, and not a bunch of whining about Blu-Ray or Hi-def or what people think this DVD should contain. Such things are of no matter to me personally. As long as I have a lasting document of this incredible season, I am happy.I received the DVD earlier today, in advance of the Tuesday release date. All I can say is...stunning!The first thing I must say is that to call this a season's highlight package is to sell this production woefully short. ""Cinematic"" is a more appropriate term. NFL Films, as a production studio, consistently puts out a product that rivals any Hollywood studio and can easily play on the big screen. You will have a greater appreciation of how fast and violent this game is when watching this, or anything from NFL Films. When you see the camera focused on a ball in flight, that is likely from the camera of Donnie Marx. That's his signature shot. He's got to be one of the best cameramen working in any medium. His shot of Tom Brady's ""Fail Mary"" at the end of the Super Bowl is a thing of beauty.About this DVD in particular, I got chills and that nervous stomach when watching, even though I knew what was going to happen. If you were already a fan of Giants' WR Victor Cruz, you will grow to love him even more. NFL Films was able to capture him in those moments, and you'll see that he plays the game with a team-first attitude and a childlike enthusiasm (on display when the Giants win the NFC Championship, and sprints across the field). I have to use the world ""childlike"", because when he is handed the Lombardi Trophy, his eyes open wide and he looks at the trophy as if he's reliving the moment he held his first child a few weeks earlier. I also love an exchange between Safety Deon Grant and one of the refs during the Atlanta playoff game where Grant argues the spot of the ball. The ref tells Grant to do his job and he'll do his. Grant replied that he DID his job and that why the spot is where HE said it was. Classic stuff.I think the one tiny complaint that I have with the DVD is that it focused on Giants' WR Domenik Hixon's acrobatic TD catch against the Rams. But they don't mention that it was Victor Cruz's window into the starting lineup, since Hixon suffered a season-ending injury to his ACL on the play. I DID like that they didn't spend too much time on the shellacking that New Orleans put on the Giants on that Monday night.The one major complaint that I had about the Giants ""Road to SB XLII"" set is addressed on this DVD, as the Super Bowl XLVI Post-game trophy ceremony is presented in the special features, along with Media Day highlights from the NFL Network, an interview with Eli Manning conducted by the man he supplanted as Giants QB...Kurt Warner, A interview with the Giants WR Corps, and a feature on Super Bowl XLII hero David Tyree.Giants fans...I really can't wait for you to see this DVD!",5,STUNNING!!!
