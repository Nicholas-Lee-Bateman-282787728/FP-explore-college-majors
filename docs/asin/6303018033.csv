It is really fun and a well done film about a teen who is a skater /surfer from CA who has to go spend a year with his relatives in Cincinatti.  Needless to say he brings his Surf board and California with him. The film makers do a great job of showing the contrast of California kids with Cincinatti kids and it is very fun.  This film has many big actors before they were big, and they were so good in this you don't forget them. One especially unforgetable scene is with Seth Green's character who is trying to pick out his clothes for his first date to the music ""I'm too Sexy for My Shirt."" Shane Mc Dermott is adorable and Brittney Powell the ""romantic lead high schooler"" is good too.  I LOVED the skating scenes and if you are a skater you will appreciate that Chris Edwards does alot of it in this film with team rollerblade.  There is a great street race that reminds me of a youth skater kind of ""What's Up Doc"" chase scene at the end of the film that is wonderful to watch.",5,Fun film and well done.

After 20 years, wow...that's a long time, it is still not a bad film at all. In fact, even for a low-key picture, Airborne probably has the best rollerblading scenes ever, even better than the ones on Rollerball with Jimmy Caan. That is one of the chief reasons why I wanted to see the film again. Shane McDermott's performance is impressive because he literally walks on a fine line between cool and corny. That's a very tough thing to accomplish, but he does it very well.

This is a valuable gem to have in one's collection and I am happy this has finally entered the dvd format because it has been long over due.In 1993, the birth of inline-skating just took off full throttle and was quickly adapting to fit the needs of your typical adrenaline junkie. The film Airborne was able to take advantage of this new popular action sport and turn it into a highly successful and entertaining film.Mitchell (Shane McDermott) is your stereotypical Californian; he is mellow, poetic, deep, pretty and extremely tolerant. After catching hours of intense waves, his parents deliver the awful news that he is to stay with his cousins in Cincinnati, Ohio because of the grant they received to explore wildlife animals (Go, figure). It is from this moment, we observe Mitchell struggle to assimilate into his new habitat. Ohio proves to be a difficult environment to adapt to as the extended cold winter months, the excessive snow, the childish behavior of the alpha male students, and his socially awkward cousin Waley (Seth Green) render the adjustment quite difficult indeed.  However, Mitchell is a charmer; he is a real lady killer and a true gentleman in the sense that he can effortlessly attract any woman at Cincinnati High, even Jack's sister, Nikki (Britney Powell). Mitchell's character is incessantly pushed to it's limits when the Alpha male hockey players, more notably, Jack (Chris Conrad) attempt to make his life a living hell at school by mocking his attitude and behavior in speech class or by pulling childish stunts such as putting sand in his locker or disassembling an entire desk for him to fall out of. (It goes to ridiculous lengths with these Ohio students)Mitchell falls prey to their game, but does not participate in it for he knows he is much smarter and much too cool to demote his signature Californian character to the callow and childish Alpha male status. His acceptance into this group of Jocks may come off as quite sudden but is all the more appropriate and justified when he ""pants's"" one of the opposing hockey team players in a street hockey match.It is after this event where Mitchell is broached by the same hockey jock's that initially gave him a rough time in school with an opportunity to really prove himself:TO RACE DOWN DEVILS BACK BONEYes, this film boils down to possibly one of the most exciting, dangerous and entertaining rollerblade races in cinema history. Similar to the Jock's bullying and teasing of our beloved protagonist, this race goes to ridiculous lengths as well. If anyone were really to attempt a race like this, I would say you have a 95% chance of dying and a 5 % chance of dying twice. These guys are dangerous and utterly insane, but when you are 17 years of age in high school, the concept of acceptance transcends far beyond any young man's rational thought, and ultimately, acceptance becomes worth any price tag, even death.I describe this movie very simply, and it is a "" a feel good movie""; moreover, it's conveniently timed, (85 minutes) the characters are likable (well,most of them), the plot is cheesy and appropriate, the ending is predictable but never falls short of its delivery, the sound fx are impressive, the soundtrack is consistent, and the friendships that follow are quite plausible. I highly recommend this film to be adopted into one's film library because this film deserves to be more than a mere rental, but a permanent and valuable addition. Maybe I am exaggerating, maybe I am going to ridiculous lengths in describing how good this film is, but as Mitchell describes his philosophical and poetic dream to Waley, ""I am what I am.""

I also totally loved the soundtrack which featured a great song by Jeremy Jordan called ""My Love Is Good Enough"".  What first struck me about this film, back when I watched it as a kid, was that it starred Shane McDermot from ""Swan's Crossing"" which was a teen soap I was totally addicted to. (It also starred Sarah Michelle Geller.)  Seth Green is, of course, in this film with other stars like Jack Black, Edie McClurg, Chris Conrad, and the gorgeous Britney Powell and sexy Alanna Ubach (Legally Blonde, Freeway). This film, for me, is one of those timeless classics.  What the Breakfast Club was to the 80's, so is Airborne to the 90's.  This film is a great teen classic of the 90's right along with other 90's teen classics like Clueless, and Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the original film with Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry).Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermot) is a typical California surfer living life in the sun and on the beach.  The biggest part of his day is spent looking for the next great wave to surf.  Circumstance intervenes in his life, Mitchell finds himself living a true teen nightmare when his parents ship him to Cincinati to stay with relatives while they embark on a big career expedition.  Mitchell rooms with his quirky and off beat cousin Wiley (Seth Green).  While trying to fit in, Mitchell crosses paths with Jack (Chris Conrad), the token ""tough"" guy.  Much to Mitchell's surprise he meets and falls for an innocent and sweet girl named Niki (Britney Powell), only to later learn she is Jack's sister.

Remember 'Solarbabies' or 'Prayer of the Rollerboys'?  No, of course you don't.  Moreover, the strange thing is, on paper at least, 'Airborne' would have had producers running for the hills.  Virtually every mainstream Hollywood cliche is in this movie.  You have your garden variety 'fish out of water' lead character; the lovable clown-prince secondary character; a quasi-Romeo and Juliet love connection (without the death of course); and the 'big race' for the finale.  Taking all of that into account - this is a good movie.  I repeat, I would rather watch this than the bulk of summer fare that emerges every year.  But, why?First, 'Airborne' was filmed AND actually took place in Cincinnati, OH (normally flicks with no big stars are made in Toronto and/or Vancouver).  Its a nice touch.Second, the characters are genuinely likable.  Seth Green plays his role of the hapless and dateless cousin to perfection.  A very very young Jack Black is also excellent.Lastly, Rollerbading isn't necessarily the core of this movie.  You could could enjoy it simply by skimming over the skating scenes, but not recommended.  The 'big race' at the end of the movie isn't like a hockey game one would expect - but a surprsingly exciting free-for-all downhill event.  In fact, the race at the end of the movie is nearly 25 minutes long, but it is filmed so well and with just the right amount of sound effects that it flows remarkably well.  This used to be a staple on TBS but has waned in airings as the years have progressed.  'Airborne' isn't even a cult film - so pick it up, you'll watch it AT LEAST 3 times - that's worth a few bucks, right?",5,This ain't over - JACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,1715,"['In-Line', 'skating', 'movies', 'are', 'lot', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'box', 'office', 'death', 'Remember', ""'Solarbabies"", ""'Prayer"", 'Rollerboys', 'No', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'Moreover', 'strange', 'thing', 'paper', 'least', ""'Airborne"", 'would', 'have', 'had', 'producers', 'running', 'hills', 'Virtually', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'movie', 'have', 'garden', 'variety', 'water', 'lead', 'character', 'lovable', 'clown-prince', 'secondary', 'character', 'quasi-Romeo', 'Juliet', 'love', 'connection', 'death', 'course', ""'big"", 'race', 'finale', 'Taking', 'account', 'good', 'movie', 'repeat', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'bulk', 'summer', 'fare', 'year', 'why', 'First', ""'Airborne"", 'was', 'filmed', 'AND', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'Cincinnati', 'OH', 'normally', 'big', 'stars', 'are', 'made', 'Toronto', 'and/or', 'Vancouver', 'nice', 'touch.Second', 'characters', 'are', 'genuinely', 'likable', 'Seth', 'Green', 'role', 'hapless', 'dateless', 'cousin', 'perfection', 'very', 'very', 'young', 'Jack', 'Black', 'also', 'excellent.Lastly', 'Rollerbading', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'core', 'movie', 'could', 'could', 'enjoy', 'simply', 'skimming', 'skating', 'scenes', 'not', 'recommended', ""'big"", 'race', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hockey', 'game', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'surprsingly', 'exciting', 'free-for-all', 'downhill', 'event', 'fact', 'race', 'end', 'movie', 'nearly', '25', 'minutes', 'long', 'filmed', 'so', 'well', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'sound', 'effects', 'remarkably', 'well', 'used', 'be', 'staple', 'TBS', 'waned', 'airings', 'years', 'have', 'progressed', ""n't"", 'even', 'cult', 'film', 'so', 'up', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'AT', 'LEAST', '3', 'times', 'few', 'bucks', 'right']",N/A

However, one thing it is not is a bad movie. Sure the dialogue is a bit campy and dated, the whole cool of it is gone, but this is a movie driven on pure nostalgia. Come to think of it, this might be a movie for a certain crowd: those born prior to 1990.Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermott) is a California skater and surfer, who spends most of his times eating burritos or chasing waves. When his parents are offered an opportunity to study in Australia, Mitchell finds himself in Cincinnati, Ohio. Of course, this means: no waves. Instead, Mitchell discovers a whole new way of life.With rising stars (Seth Green, Jack Black), ""Airborne"" is filled with a unique ensemble cast, that all work in the funny yet awkward scenarios. Shane McDermott is a likable protagonist and while his story is quite surreal, anyone who's ever been to high school or a small town can relate.The score by Stewart Copeland is phenomenal and works with some of the breathtaking visuals, specifically the ending which involves an all out race between skaters down, ""The Devils Backbone.""Hopefully this is released on DVD as the videocassette is expensive for such a dated platform. Nevertheless, anyone with cable or HBO is bound to catch this rare film.
