942982,A2WI2RBREBP7LJ,B000BITV10,001,"[1, 2]","LIKE MANY other reviews here, I only 'dicovered' the series years after it had aired, and I cannot believe the quality of it.  I am writing this in 2011, over twelve years after the series aired and in my opinion it is better than anything currently on television TODAY.Just the fact that somehow the show creators did not date themselves (minus the first episode) is a true achievement let alone getting everything else right.  Writing, filming, acting, sets, characters, action, fun-factor are all perfected here, it was a shame the show was cancelled and I wish I had found the show earlier to provide my own support. . . as if it would have mattered with totally inept TV broadcasters who put commercial short term gain over quality every time.To be honest, I did not like the first episode very much (pilot episodes tend to be a little rough for any series when they are first starting).  But from episode 2 to the end, it is jaw-dropping amazing so you really could just jump in and start watching from episode 2.  The rest of the series is so astoundingly good I can forgive the pilot.At least we did get many wonderful shows before it was cancelled so I recommend this highly and hope there is a future remastered hi-def version to come.",5,"One of the best TV series ever, skip first episode.",1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,1245,"['LIKE', 'MANY', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'only', ""'dicovered"", 'series', 'years', 'had', 'aired', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'quality', 'am', 'writing', '2011', 'twelve', 'years', 'series', 'aired', 'opinion', 'better', 'anything', 'currently', 'television', 'TODAY.Just', 'fact', 'show', 'creators', 'did', 'not', 'date', 'first', 'episode', 'true', 'achievement', 'let', 'alone', 'getting', 'everything', 'else', 'right', 'Writing', 'filming', 'acting', 'sets', 'characters', 'action', 'fun-factor', 'are', 'perfected', 'here', 'was', 'shame', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'wish', 'had', 'found', 'show', 'earlier', 'provide', 'own', 'support', 'would', 'have', 'mattered', 'totally', 'inept', 'TV', 'broadcasters', 'who', 'put', 'commercial', 'short', 'term', 'gain', 'quality', 'time.To', 'be', 'honest', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'episode', 'very', 'much', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'tend', 'be', 'little', 'rough', 'series', 'when', 'are', 'first', 'starting', 'episode', '2', 'end', 'jaw-dropping', 'amazing', 'really', 'could', 'just', 'jump', 'start', 'watching', 'episode', '2', 'rest', 'series', 'so', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'can', 'forgive', 'pilot.At', 'least', 'did', 'get', 'many', 'wonderful', 'shows', 'was', 'cancelled', 'so', 'recommend', 'highly', 'hope', 'future', 'remastered', 'hi-def', 'version', 'come']",The Magnificent Seven - The Complete First Season

942986,A16VEEQBVJ87P5,B000BITV10,B.M.,"[62, 65]","I enjoyed this series when it was originally on and was disapointed when it didn't come back.  Then I found the massive following of fan fic generated by the show and really fell in love with the boys!  Hallmark gave us a little taste though they commited sacrilege by chopping scenes out for commercials, but Showtime, God bless them, showed them to us starting back in the winter commercial free and whole.As I watched the episodes on showtime, I really began to see what a good show this was!  The people who pulled this and ruined it by moving it around so much really had no idea what they had!  I mean, almost all shows start out a little rough, but this one was starting to really get going when they pulled the plug.  It had great characters who really fit together well, great storylines, and so many possibilities!There's a character for each of us--the hardened, battle-scarred and world-weary gun slinger, the charming, roguish ladies man and loyal friend, the quiet tracker and outdoorsman, the gun toting, whiskey drinking man of the cloth who lost his way but may have found it again in this town, the ex-slave who chose to care instead of hate and used his talents to help all, the idealist greenhorn who comes west hoping to make a name for himself and in the process finds friendship and brotherhood that will teach him to be a better man (and hopefully keep him from getting himself killed before he sees another birthday), and finally, last but certainly not least, the consumate southern gentlemen conman gambler (who maybe isn't really all that gentlemanly afterall, but makes up for it by being greatly charming and roguish in his own right!) who may have found a worthy purpose and a chance at a new life in this town.  They all have their faults, their weaknesses, and their shortcomings, but that is what makes them so appealing--they're human beings, and we can relate to them.  And they have a brotherhood and friendship that most of us want.  And they're men, which in this day and age, is really getting harder to find....And they are just plain fun!  Who else gets to use a cannon to blow up the enemy's flag or a store front or a slingshot to sling dynamite at the bad guys?  Not to mention that it's the old west, so carrying fires arms and using them isn't a problem, especially when you have a gritty old warhorse of a boss like Judge Travis (who, for those interested in the movies, starred as the gambler in the first one).  This was really a great show!  But at least, now I can enjoy the show on DVD and further the adventures through the fanfic forums.Note: as if you couldn't tell already, I personally loved this show and thought it buried the movies in it's dust.  If you're looking for something like the movies, this isn't it, but watch this anyway--if you like westerns (or if you don't) you'll like this!",5,YES!!!!!!FINALLY!,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,2851,"['enjoyed', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'was', 'disapointed', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Then', 'found', 'massive', 'following', 'fan', 'fic', 'generated', 'show', 'really', 'fell', 'love', 'boys', 'Hallmark', 'gave', 'little', 'taste', 'commited', 'sacrilege', 'chopping', 'scenes', 'out', 'commercials', 'Showtime', 'God', 'showed', 'starting', 'back', 'winter', 'commercial', 'free', 'whole.As', 'watched', 'episodes', 'showtime', 'really', 'began', 'see', 'what', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'pulled', 'ruined', 'moving', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'had', 'mean', 'almost', 'shows', 'start', 'out', 'little', 'rough', 'one', 'was', 'starting', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'when', 'pulled', 'plug', 'had', 'great', 'characters', 'who', 'really', 'fit', 'together', 'well', 'great', 'storylines', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities', 'character', 'hardened', 'battle-scarred', 'world-weary', 'gun', 'slinger', 'charming', 'roguish', 'ladies', 'man', 'loyal', 'friend', 'quiet', 'tracker', 'outdoorsman', 'gun', 'toting', 'whiskey', 'drinking', 'man', 'cloth', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'again', 'town', 'ex-slave', 'who', 'chose', 'care', 'instead', 'hate', 'used', 'talents', 'help', 'idealist', 'greenhorn', 'who', 'west', 'hoping', 'make', 'name', 'process', 'friendship', 'brotherhood', 'will', 'teach', 'be', 'better', 'man', 'hopefully', 'keep', 'getting', 'killed', 'birthday', 'finally', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'consumate', 'southern', 'gentlemen', 'conman', 'gambler', 'who', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'gentlemanly', 'afterall', 'up', 'being', 'greatly', 'charming', 'roguish', 'own', 'right', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'worthy', 'purpose', 'chance', 'new', 'life', 'town', 'have', 'faults', 'weaknesses', 'shortcomings', 'what', 'so', 'appealing', ""'re"", 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'relate', 'have', 'brotherhood', 'friendship', 'most', 'want', ""'re"", 'men', 'day', 'age', 'really', 'getting', 'harder', 'find', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'Who', 'else', 'use', 'cannon', 'blow', 'up', 'enemy', 'flag', 'store', 'front', 'slingshot', 'sling', 'dynamite', 'bad', 'guys', 'Not', 'mention', 'old', 'west', 'carrying', 'fires', 'arms', 'using', ""n't"", 'problem', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'gritty', 'old', 'warhorse', 'boss', 'Judge', 'Travis', 'who', 'interested', 'movies', 'starred', 'gambler', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'least', 'now', 'can', 'enjoy', 'show', 'DVD', 'further', 'adventures', 'fanfic', 'forums.Note', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'already', 'personally', 'loved', 'show', 'thought', 'buried', 'movies', 'dust', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'movies', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anyway', 'like', 'westerns', 'do', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'like']",The Magnificent Seven - The Complete First Season

942992,AKX28FGA6L47J,B000BITV10,Mark,"[11, 13]","This was a very entertaining television series that, unfortunately, ended far too soon.As a lover of westerns - books, movies or television shows - I really enjoyed this series when it originally aired back in the late 90's as I knew back then it would be lucky to last 1 or 2 complete seasons. Today, of course, it wouldn't last more than 1 / 2 dozen episodes (could you imagine this show trying to compete with the plethora of mindless ""reality"" shows that pollute the airways night after night..??!!)Week after week, the viewer was treated to a  very well written episode and starring an interesting and diverse assortment of characters, who comprised the Magnificent Seven.In this television series, the 7 are based in a town - without a sheriff / marshall. The seven act as the local law and periodically, Robert Vaughan appears as a judge who dispenses frontier justice to the outlawas who are actually left standing after the gunbattles (not too many).Although the seven acted as a unit, they were all very different in character and usually there were two or three different story lines going on in each episode. Each week, we seemed to liearn a little more about each man's backgrounhd.The recurring theme revolved around Chris Larabee (the Yul Brynner character) who lost his wife and son to violence many years earlier. Darkly played by Michael Biehn, the man / men who did the killing are now dead, however, Chris is continually hunting for the man who ordered the killing.In addition to Chris, who never seemed to have alot of dialogue, we also had Josiah, who, when we wasn't blasting bad guys to Kingdom Come served as the town's preacher complete with his own church. We also had a fancy vest-wearing gambler, a black guy who served as a doctor occasionally and a few others who had some interesting backgrounds.It's unfortunate that the show only last a couple of seasons - this is a show I could have watched year after year. But westerns in the 90's have about as much a chance of survival as a snowball in hell.It's too bad that westerns aren't terribly popular anymore - you can still tell a great story that revolves around some interesting characters and put it in the 1880's west.But I guess in this day and age, you would have countless psychologists and ""child experts"" bemoaning the fact that we're cultivating a generation of violent children by exposing them to too much gunfire and violence each week.Funny how this never happened to the generation of kids who grew up on Bonanza and Gunsmoke and countless other great westerns of the late 50's / early 60's.",5,Thanks For The DVD - Great Series,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2588,"['was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'television', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'ended', 'far', 'too', 'soon.As', 'lover', 'westerns', 'books', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'back', 'late', '90', 'knew', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'last', '1', '2', 'complete', 'seasons', 'Today', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'more', '1', '/', '2', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'could', 'imagine', 'show', 'trying', 'compete', 'plethora', 'mindless', 'reality', 'pollute', 'airways', 'night', 'night..', 'Week', 'week', 'viewer', 'was', 'treated', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'episode', 'starring', 'interesting', 'diverse', 'assortment', 'characters', 'who', 'comprised', 'Magnificent', 'Seven.In', 'television', 'series', '7', 'are', 'based', 'town', 'sheriff', '/', 'marshall', 'seven', 'act', 'local', 'law', 'periodically', 'Robert', 'Vaughan', 'judge', 'who', 'frontier', 'justice', 'outlawas', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'left', 'standing', 'gunbattles', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'seven', 'acted', 'unit', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'usually', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'different', 'story', 'lines', 'going', 'episode', 'week', 'seemed', 'liearn', 'little', 'more', 'man', 'backgrounhd.The', 'recurring', 'theme', 'revolved', 'Chris', 'Larabee', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'character', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'son', 'violence', 'many', 'years', 'earlier', 'Darkly', 'played', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'man', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'killing', 'are', 'now', 'dead', 'however', 'Chris', 'continually', 'hunting', 'man', 'who', 'ordered', 'killing.In', 'addition', 'Chris', 'who', 'never', 'seemed', 'have', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'also', 'had', 'Josiah', 'who', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'blasting', 'bad', 'guys', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'served', 'town', 'preacher', 'complete', 'own', 'church', 'also', 'had', 'fancy', 'vest-wearing', 'gambler', 'black', 'guy', 'who', 'served', 'doctor', 'occasionally', 'few', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'interesting', 'backgrounds.It', 'unfortunate', 'show', 'only', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'year', 'year', '90', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'chance', 'survival', 'snowball', 'hell.It', 'too', 'bad', 'westerns', 'are', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'popular', 'anymore', 'can', 'still', 'tell', 'great', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'put', '1880', 'west.But', 'guess', 'day', 'age', 'would', 'have', 'countless', 'psychologists', 'child', 'experts', 'bemoaning', 'fact', ""'re"", 'cultivating', 'generation', 'violent', 'children', 'exposing', 'too', 'much', 'gunfire', 'violence', 'week.Funny', 'how', 'never', 'happened', 'generation', 'kids', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Bonanza', 'Gunsmoke', 'countless', 'other', 'great', 'westerns', 'late', '50', '/', 'early', '60']",The Magnificent Seven - The Complete First Season

It would be nice if there was more character depth but given the show's format and current trends in tv series, this is a great collage of a much maligned genre. A must for anyone who likes good old fashioned entertainment in its purest form.",4,Magnificent Seven - Season 1,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,358,"['fans', 'wild', 'west', 'genre', 'DVD', 'full', 'traditional', 'cowboy', 'heroes', 'making', 'good', 'small', 'township', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'depth', 'given', 'show', 'format', 'current', 'trends', 'tv', 'series', 'great', 'collage', 'much', 'maligned', 'genre', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'entertainment', 'purest', 'form']",The Magnificent Seven - The Complete First Season

This series should have been given a longer run before being cancelled, IMO.  I grew up watching the great TV westerns & this one is a wonderful addition to the genre.  Good writing & a strong cast make this entire series a joy to watch.  The actors seem to be enjoying their roles & their interactions w/ each other. Each character is different & brings a different facet to the whole of the group, each man can be dangerous by himself & together they are indeed magnificent to watch; flawed knights in shining armor.",5,a Magnificent gem,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,601,"['purchased', 'entire', 'series', 'Amazon', 'having', 'seen', 'episodes', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'longer', 'run', 'being', 'cancelled', 'IMO', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'great', 'TV', 'westerns', 'one', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'genre', 'Good', 'writing', 'strong', 'cast', 'make', 'entire', 'series', 'joy', 'watch', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'roles', 'interactions', 'w/', 'other', 'character', 'different', 'different', 'facet', 'whole', 'group', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'together', 'are', 'indeed', 'magnificent', 'watch', 'flawed', 'knights', 'shining', 'armor']",The Magnificent Seven - The Complete First Season
