908104,A2EVXI7A6ECPJU,B0009MAPWM,"Analog ""Evil_Spud_Boy""","[5, 6]","I got this DVD set for Christmas, and it is excellent!  These are the newer Home Videos, starring Tom Bergeron as the host, who, in my opinion, is a much funnier and more charismatic host than Bob Sagat was. (not that Bob Sagat was bad, just kinda cheesy).  Now you can watch all the hilarity without having to sit thorough commercials, and it's good fun to watch some of the clips in slow motion to really capture the moment.  At any rate, home videos was always a funny show, and has always been one of my favorites.  I was quite surprised to get this as a gift, as I didn't even know it had been released on DVD.

908107,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0009MAPWM,Dorrie Wheeler,"[9, 14]","Humm...I wondered why the title of the DVD was ""Review-America's Funniest Home Videos Vol 1 with Tom Bergeron."" This is because there have been many hosts of America's Funniest Home Videos over the more than a decade that this laugh fest has been on the air. The original host was Bob Saget. Former MTV VJ Daisy Fuentes was also a host at one time. This set includes 12 episodes on 3 discs and the fourth disc is the celebration of the shows 300th episiode. I watched the episodes and they are very funny. However, I can't help but wonder, why would someone want to purchase this series on DVD? The show is still on the air and it's in sydication. It's not a serial program, drama, or comedy with a storyline. In many ways, ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" is the first reality TV smash. The show was (and is) comprised of funny moments caught on tape. The box promised a thousand laughs, and sure some people might laugh a thousand times, but sometimes watching the clips you really know what is going to happen. My kids loved the set and it was really funny to them, and me in some parts. It probably wouldn't be very lucrative to release every season on DVD, but I would like to see a ""Best of the 80's"" or early 90's set with Saget and some of the really funny clips from when the show first started to air and you didn't really have to question what was sheer coincience and what was maybe planned for the camera. It's a good set for the price.  The bottom line is kids will love it.",5,It's A Good Set If You Really Like This Show!,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1488,"['Humm', 'wondered', 'why', 'title', 'DVD', 'was', 'Review-America', 'Funniest', 'Home', 'Videos', 'Vol', '1', 'Tom', 'Bergeron', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'hosts', 'America', 'Funniest', 'Home', 'Videos', 'more', 'decade', 'laugh', 'fest', 'been', 'air', 'original', 'host', 'was', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'Former', 'MTV', 'VJ', 'Daisy', 'Fuentes', 'was', 'also', 'host', 'one', 'time', 'set', '12', 'episodes', '3', 'discs', 'fourth', 'disc', 'celebration', 'shows', '300th', 'episiode', 'watched', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'someone', 'want', 'purchase', 'series', 'DVD', 'show', 'still', 'air', 'sydication', 'not', 'serial', 'program', 'drama', 'comedy', 'storyline', 'many', 'ways', 'America', 'Funniest', 'Home', 'Videos', 'first', 'reality', 'TV', 'smash', 'show', 'was', 'comprised', 'funny', 'moments', 'caught', 'tape', 'box', 'promised', 'thousand', 'sure', 'people', 'might', 'laugh', 'thousand', 'times', 'sometimes', 'watching', 'clips', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'kids', 'loved', 'set', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'parts', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'lucrative', 'release', 'season', 'DVD', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Best', '80', 'early', '90', 'set', 'Saget', 'really', 'funny', 'clips', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'started', 'air', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'question', 'what', 'was', 'sheer', 'coincience', 'what', 'was', 'maybe', 'planned', 'camera', 'good', 'set', 'price', 'bottom', 'line', 'kids', 'will', 'love']",America's Funniest Home Videos Volume 1
908108,A3VMJ4ZNZ20RGG,B0009MAPWM,J. Dorman,"[8, 8]","I love this collection!!! I realize that there are some people out there that can be turned off by some of the content, however this is a great collection from the Bergeron years (the best). What I like best about this DVD set is it is a broken into each individual show rather than conbining several of them together. This is why I call it the best traveling DVD ever, your kids can watch it on short trips or they can put in for the long haul. Maybe I am a too easily entertained but I could watch this over and over without getting tired of it. The only content that I sometimes have problems watching are the groin hits, bratty kids, and baby spit-up montage. However, that's life and thats what makes it funny. You gotta relate to some of these situations and laugh because you felt it too or yes maybe even you have been thrown up on a few times by your kids. Your kids will love this DVD and us parents can laugh right along with them, its good to show them that its alright to screw up and make a fool of yourself sometimes. The only complaint I have is that by containing about a seasons worth of videos, a 100,000 dollar show, and a 300th episode special there will be a few repeats between them. Buy this set and it will make your car trips easier!!! You may however feel the urge to look in the backseat and see what your kids are laughing at, but remember: RESIST THE URGE!!!",4,Greatest traveling DVD ever!!!,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,1388,"['love', 'collection', 'realize', 'are', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'content', 'however', 'great', 'collection', 'Bergeron', 'years', 'best', 'What', 'like', 'best', 'DVD', 'set', 'broken', 'individual', 'show', 'rather', 'conbining', 'several', 'together', 'why', 'call', 'best', 'traveling', 'DVD', 'ever', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'short', 'trips', 'can', 'put', 'long', 'haul', 'Maybe', 'am', 'too', 'easily', 'entertained', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'getting', 'tired', 'only', 'content', 'sometimes', 'have', 'problems', 'watching', 'are', 'groin', 'hits', 'bratty', 'kids', 'baby', 'spit-up', 'montage', 'However', 'life', 'thats', 'what', 'funny', 'got', 'ta', 'relate', 'situations', 'laugh', 'felt', 'too', 'yes', 'maybe', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'kids', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'parents', 'can', 'laugh', 'right', 'good', 'show', 'alright', 'screw', 'up', 'make', 'fool', 'sometimes', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'containing', 'seasons', 'videos', '100,000', 'dollar', 'show', '300th', 'episode', 'special', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'repeats', 'Buy', 'set', 'will', 'make', 'car', 'trips', 'easier', 'may', 'however', 'feel', 'urge', 'look', 'backseat', 'see', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'laughing', 'remember', 'RESIST', 'URGE']",America's Funniest Home Videos Volume 1

908110,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0009MAPWM,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[13, 13]","I definitely am always in the mood for something incredibly funny at times. That has been the case with the ABC show America's Funniest Home Videos. Since its debut in 1989 with Bob Saget, the show has been a constant in our lives and television. Yet, the show has really been a real status for laughter. While the show has constantly changed with the times, so have the hosts as well from Bob Saget who played Danny Tanner from Full House, the odd short-lived duo of Daisy Fuentes and John Fugelsang, and our current master of ceremonies Tom Bergeron who has done well as the recent host of Hollywood Squares. The question for Beregeron is could he deliver as the host, the answer is yes.America's Funniest Home Videos, Volume 1 is a look at the first season through Tom Bergeron as the host. His delivery is a real return to the hilariousness that has made the show a absolute legend for ABC. The DVD set includes several episodes from his first year the host, including side-spliting video clips that just are incredibly funny in some cases and other unfortunately aren't. The collection also includes celebrated episodes like the 300th total series episode, and of course the usual $100,000 grand prize show.All in all, I personally haven't seen all of the first year Tom Bergeron has hosted with America's Funniest Home Videos, but I definitely know that he feelings of funniness are there. I can't wait to see this year in full on DVD, and laugh out loud like everyone else.
