Socially inept and insecure, every encounter with even loved ones is full of awkwardness and fumbling.  He has difficulty expressing himself and relating to others.  At home he lives in the mother-in-law house (or garage as they say) next to his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law Karen (Emily Mortimer).  One night a well-meaning Karen tackles him on the driveway to get him to stay for dinner.  Needless to say he is almost traumatized by her good intentions.  Work is as pedestrian as it gets:  He works in a cubicle doing work on the computer for an unknown company.  Co-worker Marla (Kelli Gardner) shows an interest in him, but even her overtures leave him flummoxed.  Another co-coworker is friendly, but offers him his favorite porn.  That is until he introduces him to his latest offering from ""Real Doll.dot.com"".  Anatomically correct, the life-size doll gives Lars an idea.Coming home to dinner once again, Lars is beaming about his new girlfriend.  Gus and Karen are also beaming, truly enthusiastic and proud.  Until they meet Bianca, the ""real doll"" who is seated with a conversing Lars.  Lars is transformed.  His speech is confident; his cheeks are reddened; and his outlook is happy.  First comes shock; then comes acceptance.  Not quite knowing what to do, Lars is so believable that they start to believe it too.  They have him see a therapist (Patricia Clarkson), the general practitioner in their small Northern Wisconsin town, and the pastor gathers his flock together.  Everyone starts to make jokes, but eventually they go along with someone who is truly delusional.  Bianca starts to become real.Billed as a comedy, `Lars and the Real Girl' is too often sad to be funny.  Though profound and heartwarming, the laughs are often embarrassing because the situations of the protagonist are awkward.  They elicit our sympathy.  This isn't to say the film isn't a gem because it is.  In spite of all temptations to pigeon hole this movie as cheesy or a screwball comedy, all the right components come together to make `Lars and the Real Girl' a wonderful little film and truly one of the best of the year.  Without serendipity, this movie could have easily been a disaster.(The extras are short but sweet:  ""The Real Story of Lars and the Real Girl"" (10:11) is worthy for the ""real"" affection the cast has for the film with reflections by Oscar nominated screenwriter, Nancy Oliver, and a specially articulate director (Craig Gillespie). 'A Real Leading Lady' (5:55) features Ryan Gosling ad libbing facetiously with his co-star Bianca about making the film.  The deleted ""Bathtub"" scene is impossibly short, clocking in less than a minute--but the written explanation by the director is insightful.

Most thought this movie was tender, touching, compassionate and caring, etc. etc. - I kid you not, this was almost the most painful and insipid waste of time I've ever endured. I'd rather wait on line at the DMV, get a root canal, sign up for jury duty or watch Glenn Beck than subject myself to this film again.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE????This movie was insulting to anyone with a brain, I don't care how mentally challenged you are. Let me ask you a question - a good friend or relative shows up at your door with a blow-up date and treats it like a real girl, are you gonna play along, run around the house looking for the 'candid cameras' that will appear on next week's episode of 'PUNKD', or are you gonna ask him politely to share his drugs with everybody because these are obviously some excellent psychedelics, or will you beat his demented ass and throw him out for fouling up your dinner plans while your wife calls the local Looney Bin requesting guys w/ white jackets and large butterfly nets ??? I can't believe that even ONE person in this flick humored this freak, let alone the entire town play along and embrace his apparent lunacy - who does this benefit?

1146102,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0014D5RBE,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]","Last year saw the return (or I should say the `embrace') of the quirky comedy, with Oscar nominee `Juno' garnering much attention, respect and love from countless fans.  Another quirky comedy that gained some awards traction but far less attention was `Lars and the Real Girl', a preposterous story that is elevated by some very fine performances and a heaping serving of heart.  When comparing the two films I can't help but admit that my preference lies with `Juno' as far as entertainment goes.  `Juno' is fast paced and engrossing, quick witted and `laugh-out-loud' funny.  `Lars...' is a different breed of film altogether.  It is slower paced and solemn, quiet and distilled in moments and has a much deeper and, quite frankly, more important story to tell.  Both are very good films, truth be told, but each has a very different effect on the audience.`Lars and the Real Girl' tells of the strange love story between Lars and Bianca.  Lars is a quiet young man who lives in the shed behind his brother's home.  He keeps to himself despite his sister-in-laws efforts to engage him in conversation.  He works hard and resists the efforts of young and attractive women who seem interested in a relationship with him.  He is guarded and afraid and content in hiding behind his guards.  Bianca is a crippled missionary (ex-missionary) who met Lars online and has come to visit.  Because of her strict religious background Lars has asked his brother and sister-in-law if Bianca could stay with them while she's in town.Oh yeah, Bianca is an adult blow-up doll.It's apparent that Lars is suffering from a delusional state of mind.  He believes that Bianca is a real person and he engages her in conversation as if this were true.  After seeking help from the family doctor, Lars loved ones decide to play along with this charade to hopefully help snap him back into reality.`Lars and the Real Girl' definitely suspends the boundaries of disbelief, especially when the entire town starts playing along with Lars' delusion, but the film never strays from the warmth buried at its center.  The film never feels as preposterous as it truly is because it always carries a feeling of tender sincerity.  This is due in large part to some very, very fine performances.Ryan Gosling is touching and capable as Lars Lindstrom.  We see a sad and lonely man repressed by his own feelings and forced into hiding behind a false wall of security in order to spare himself heartbreak and or destitution.  The only issue I have with Gosling's performance is that it often feels one-note.  That one-note is played beautifully, don't get me wrong, but it is still one-note.  Emily Mortimer and Paul Schneider on the other hand prove to be the heart and soul of this film.  As Karin, Lars' sister-in-law, Mortimer is emotionally connected to the audience.  She cares deeply for Lars and is trying desperately to understand his condition.  She wants to help him so much so that she almost at times encourages his delusion.  Paul Schneider is even more breathtaking.  He had such a banner year last year, between his stunning performance in `Lars...' and his flawless performance in `...Jesse James...'.  As Gus, Lars' brother, Paul covers each and every varying emotion (shock, tolerance, guilt, shame, love, desperation) magically.  There is a moment, when Gus and Karin, Lars and Bianca are sitting in the waiting room at Dagmar's office and you can just read the discomfort all over Paul's face.  It's marvelous acting.  This man better get the career he deserves.The cast of supporting characters are all fine as well; Kelli Garner embracing her characters quirks and idiosyncrasies and Patricia Clarkson (who is just always on point) doing her best to work with the stale `psychologist' role; but truth be told, this movie belongs to Mortimer and Schneider.I do wish that the script had been tweaked a tad, in order to allow the audience to come to understand Lars a little better.  The film clocks in under two-hours (although the film does tend to feel much longer) and probably could have been lengthened a tad to allow for us to really grasp his condition.  His delusion is given reasons, but they are reasons that are generic and predictable and could have and should have been expounded.  Maybe that would have allowed for Gosling to explore a varying array of emotions and really flesh out his character.In the end I highly recommend `Lars...' despite that minor flaw.  The film is touching and sweet and, while it is marketed as a comedy and I did laugh out loud in a few scenes, it has a warmth of soul that is often not found in big budget comedies today.  It feels `independent' and that adds a layer of rawness to the finished product.  `Lars and the Real Girl' is a memorable film that will move you in ways you may not have imagined, and that is always a good thing.",4,`Lars' is the real deal...,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,4863,"['Last', 'year', 'saw', 'return', 'should', 'say', 'embrace', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Juno', 'garnering', 'much', 'attention', 'respect', 'love', 'countless', 'fans', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'gained', 'awards', 'traction', 'far', 'less', 'attention', 'was', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'preposterous', 'story', 'elevated', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'heaping', 'serving', 'heart', 'When', 'comparing', 'two', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'preference', 'Juno', 'as', 'far', 'entertainment', 'Juno', 'fast', 'paced', 'engrossing', 'quick', 'witted', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Lars', 'different', 'breed', 'film', 'altogether', 'slower', 'paced', 'solemn', 'quiet', 'distilled', 'moments', 'much', 'deeper', 'quite', 'frankly', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'tell', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'films', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'very', 'different', 'effect', 'audience.', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'tells', 'strange', 'love', 'story', 'Lars', 'Bianca', 'Lars', 'quiet', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'shed', 'brother', 'home', 'sister-in-laws', 'efforts', 'engage', 'conversation', 'hard', 'efforts', 'young', 'attractive', 'women', 'who', 'seem', 'interested', 'relationship', 'guarded', 'afraid', 'content', 'hiding', 'guards', 'Bianca', 'crippled', 'missionary', 'ex-missionary', 'who', 'met', 'Lars', 'online', 'come', 'visit', 'strict', 'religious', 'background', 'Lars', 'asked', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'Bianca', 'could', 'stay', 'town.Oh', 'yeah', 'Bianca', 'adult', 'blow-up', 'doll.It', 'apparent', 'Lars', 'suffering', 'delusional', 'state', 'mind', 'Bianca', 'real', 'person', 'conversation', 'were', 'true', 'seeking', 'help', 'family', 'doctor', 'Lars', 'loved', 'ones', 'decide', 'play', 'along', 'charade', 'hopefully', 'help', 'snap', 'back', 'reality.', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'definitely', 'boundaries', 'disbelief', 'especially', 'when', 'entire', 'town', 'playing', 'along', 'Lars', 'delusion', 'film', 'never', 'warmth', 'buried', 'center', 'film', 'never', 'as', 'preposterous', 'truly', 'always', 'feeling', 'tender', 'sincerity', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'very', 'very', 'fine', 'performances.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'touching', 'capable', 'Lars', 'Lindstrom', 'see', 'sad', 'lonely', 'man', 'repressed', 'own', 'feelings', 'forced', 'hiding', 'false', 'wall', 'security', 'order', 'spare', 'heartbreak', 'destitution', 'only', 'issue', 'have', 'Gosling', 'performance', 'often', 'one-note', 'one-note', 'played', 'beautifully', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'one-note', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'other', 'hand', 'prove', 'be', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'Karin', 'Lars', 'sister-in-law', 'Mortimer', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'audience', 'deeply', 'Lars', 'trying', 'desperately', 'understand', 'condition', 'help', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'times', 'delusion', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'even', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'had', 'banner', 'year', 'last', 'year', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Lars', 'flawless', 'performance', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Gus', 'Lars', 'brother', 'Paul', 'varying', 'emotion', 'shock', 'tolerance', 'guilt', 'shame', 'love', 'desperation', 'magically', 'moment', 'when', 'Gus', 'Karin', 'Lars', 'Bianca', 'are', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'room', 'Dagmar', 'office', 'can', 'just', 'read', 'discomfort', 'Paul', 'face', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'man', 'better', 'get', 'career', 'deserves.The', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'well', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'embracing', 'characters', 'quirks', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'just', 'always', 'point', 'doing', 'best', 'work', 'stale', 'psychologist', 'role', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'movie', 'Mortimer', 'Schneider.I', 'do', 'wish', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'tweaked', 'tad', 'order', 'allow', 'audience', 'come', 'understand', 'Lars', 'little', 'better', 'film', 'clocks', 'two-hours', 'film', 'tend', 'feel', 'much', 'longer', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lengthened', 'tad', 'allow', 'really', 'grasp', 'condition', 'delusion', 'given', 'reasons', 'are', 'reasons', 'are', 'generic', 'predictable', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expounded', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'Gosling', 'explore', 'varying', 'array', 'emotions', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'character.In', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Lars', 'minor', 'flaw', 'film', 'touching', 'sweet', 'marketed', 'comedy', 'did', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'scenes', 'warmth', 'soul', 'often', 'not', 'found', 'big', 'budget', 'comedies', 'today', 'independent', 'layer', 'rawness', 'finished', 'product', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'memorable', 'film', 'will', 'move', 'ways', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'always', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

1146104,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0014D5RBE,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","I'd shied away from this wonderful movie for a long period before finally seeing it.  I have a lot of respect for Ryan Gosling as an actor - he could have gone full sellout after his heartthrob turn inThe Notebook.  Instead, he cut back across the grain with smaller, offbeat, intense choices likeStayandHalf Nelson.  Those are two personal favorites.  But I wondered how Lars' subject matter (man ""dates"" artificial girl - a sex toy, actually) would hold up over a full-length movie.  Seems like something like that would get old or uncomfortable fairly quickly.  But, again, Gosling's ear for projects didn't let him down.  It's another winner.What's the movie's secret?  Despite its title, it's not about Lars and the Real Girl...it's about everyone else - how they react...and interact.  That's where its great cast comes to the fore.  Emily Mortimer brings class to everything she does.  Paul Schneider is perfect as Mortimer's husband (Lars' brother-in-law).  I'd never seen Kelli Garner before, but she was a revelation here - sweet and pure as Lars' co-worker and wannabe-girlfriend, Margo.  There's a scene in which Margo is trying to get Lars to come to a party.  He finally agrees and asks ""can I bring my girlfriend?""  Her reaction is gold: clearly gutted, she keeps a brave face and sputters a cheery answer.  It's a wonderful piece of acting.Listening to Gosling on a Fresh Air interview, my wife and I were struck by how quirky and unique his intelligence is.  If he's not somewhere ""on the spectrum,"" he's closer to it than the general public.  He clearly processes things differently than a typical Hollywood star would.  The result is a filmography like no other.  Let's hope he stays true to what that inner voice keeps telling him.",5,This excellent movie's secret?

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 4]","Similar to the theme that runs throughPay It Forward, this film also has a morally upstanding message for those who help others and then receive something they never thought possible: internal healing.Although very unrealistic in today's terms, LARS AND THE REAL GIRL is a great fictional take on what it would be like when an entire town gets behind one man's delusion and helps him (and themselves) get through past, present and future problems.The man is Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling,Half Nelson) whose isolationism has reached psychologically damaging proportions. Living in the garage while his brother and expectant sister-in-law occupy the cozy house, Lars' ruined psyche is at first a mystery to all. Karin (Emily Mortimer,Dear Frankie) is Lars' very pregnant sister-in-law who tries everything to get Lars to come over for dinner or interact in some way with the family and neighbors; she even goes so far as to tackle him in their driveway! Gus (Paul Schneider,The Family Stone) shoves Lars' problems under the family rug, saying ""There's no problem with Lars."" Lars' computer coworkers see him simply as an introvert, except for one cute new employee named Margo (Kelli Garner) who is attracted to him but can't seem to break through the walls he's built around him.All of Lars' problems come to a head when Lars orders a silicon sex doll through the internet and introduces her to everyone as his new girlfriend. And it isn't a joke; it's a delusion that helps Lars build a surprising ladder to vault over the psychological walls he's built. The first to meet ""Bianca"" (the doll's given name by Lars) is Lars' brother Gus and sister-in-law Karin. Dumbfounded, they take Lars and Bianca to their local doctor Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson,Good Night, and Good Luck) who discovers Lars' delusion but is unsure of the cause.The damage issued upon Lars slowly comes seeping out. Damaged by his now dead father. Abandonment/death of his mother. No help coming from any corner of his life or neighbors. It all took its toll on Lars and now it has manifested itself via a sex toy. But can the damage be reversed?Watching this story one has to remember that it is fiction. Most mentally ill people are ostracized by their communities and getting the right help is often tough. But in Lars And The Real Girl, the entire township rallies around Lars to help him (and Bianca) become a part of the community again.

1146110,A3OPEGCKL0BOPU,B0014D5RBE,born into this,"[0, 0]","I will say the theme is trauma, of the childhood variety, and what it might require to heal, which means honoring the process on its own terms. For those who find the idea of a sex doll as a kind of talisman intervention ridiculous, you owe it to yourself to reconsider. You might begin by considering the common childhood phenomenon of the ""imaginary friend"". And watch closely: there are after-all young adults who never strike us as maladjusted. but who are yet attached to their action figures and or certain stuffed animals.While there is gentle humor here the fact that the film is being called a comedy by some strikes me as incredible (I actually consider it a minor flaw that at least one or two opportunites for lol humor were not exploited). The film is rather a sweet and for the most part non-sentimental drama...a meditation on healing and the human condition--especially the condition of growing up in a world where there are no official rites of passage. Try doing this as an adult who's stuck in child trauma!As a species of modern fable I find it more effective than other acclaimed fable-films that portray innocence like ""Harvey"" or ""Being There"" or most especially ""Forrest Gump"". I always wind up throwing up... my hands due to what I consider bad aesthetics, a nauseating or incoherent blend of realism and fantasy. With ""Lars"" the fable elements are subtly implied and never rise more than a few millimeters above real-life believability, even if some will find it hard to believe that things develop the way they do.On the minus side I think the film suffers somewhat from a creative self-consciousness that if not exactly preening is still a bit too self-congratulatory. For those who discern ideology at work--of let's say the Clintonian 'It Takes a Village' variety, I would only remind you that this is a small town, and in this sense could be read as a defense of the intellectual conservative tradition which has historically been on the 'small is beautiful' end of the argument.",4,Good Grief,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,2010,"['will', 'say', 'theme', 'trauma', 'childhood', 'variety', 'what', 'might', 'require', 'heal', 'honoring', 'process', 'own', 'terms', 'who', 'find', 'idea', 'sex', 'doll', 'kind', 'talisman', 'intervention', 'ridiculous', 'owe', 'yourself', 'reconsider', 'might', 'begin', 'considering', 'common', 'childhood', 'phenomenon', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'watch', 'closely', 'are', 'after-all', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'never', 'strike', 'maladjusted', 'who', 'are', 'yet', 'attached', 'action', 'figures', 'certain', 'stuffed', 'animals.While', 'gentle', 'humor', 'here', 'fact', 'film', 'being', 'called', 'comedy', 'strikes', 'incredible', 'actually', 'consider', 'minor', 'flaw', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'opportunites', 'lol', 'humor', 'were', 'not', 'exploited', 'film', 'rather', 'sweet', 'most', 'part', 'non-sentimental', 'drama', 'meditation', 'healing', 'human', 'condition', 'especially', 'condition', 'growing', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'official', 'rites', 'passage', 'Try', 'doing', 'adult', 'who', 'stuck', 'child', 'trauma', 'species', 'modern', 'fable', 'find', 'more', 'effective', 'other', 'acclaimed', 'fable-films', 'portray', 'innocence', 'Harvey', 'Being', 'most', 'especially', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'always', 'wind', 'up', 'throwing', 'up', 'hands', 'due', 'what', 'consider', 'bad', 'aesthetics', 'nauseating', 'incoherent', 'blend', 'realism', 'fantasy', 'Lars', 'fable', 'elements', 'are', 'subtly', 'implied', 'never', 'rise', 'more', 'few', 'millimeters', 'real-life', 'believability', 'even', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'things', 'develop', 'way', 'do.On', 'minus', 'side', 'think', 'film', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'creative', 'self-consciousness', 'not', 'exactly', 'preening', 'still', 'bit', 'too', 'self-congratulatory', 'who', 'discern', 'ideology', 'work', 'let', 'say', 'Clintonian', ""'It"", 'Takes', 'Village', 'variety', 'would', 'only', 'remind', 'small', 'town', 'sense', 'could', 'be', 'read', 'defense', 'intellectual', 'conservative', 'tradition', 'historically', 'been', ""'small"", 'beautiful', 'end', 'argument']",N/A
1146111,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0014D5RBE,Brian E. Erland,"[4, 5]","Synopsis; Lars (Ryan Gosling) lives out a quiet, solitary existence in the garage of the family house in a small town located somewhere in Midwest America. The likeable but evasive Lars has never come to grips with the loss of his Mother in childbirth, the ensuing grief of his Father over her death and the abandonment of his older brother who moved out shortly after the tragic event. Many years have passed since these events took place and Lars, now in his mid to late twenties is about to discover a rather bizarre and unorthodox way to deal with the trauma that has been sealed up inside. Lars has purchased a life size silicon doll named Bianca and introduces her to his brother (Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer) as his new girlfriend and love of his life. After consulting with the town physican/psychologist Lars delusion is allowed to extend into the community-at-large; his church, workplace, everywhere...Will time and communal support eventually bring Lars back to reality and the realization that Bianca is nothing more than a doll, or is he doomed to live out his delusion to the very end?Critique: When dealing with the complicated and intricate psychic constructs that lead to such interior psychological, emotional and social maladies of isolation and alienation one will discover there is no surefire therapeutic practice by which to guide one through their ""Dark Night of the Soul"" into the dawning of a glorious new day. The dark, bittersweet comedy from '07, `Lars and the Real Girl' tackles these difficult issues as it explores the thoughts and actions of its main character. The action is slow and at times tedious but the script is cleverly nuanced with dialogue layered with meaning and insight. You'll learn a lot about Lars and yourself if you're attentive.Rating: In some ways `Lars and the Real Girl' is more a meditative, introspective `rite of passage' than anything else. When approached with that in mind I think you'll agree with my -4 Stars- designation.P.S. If you like this film you'll also enjoy a wonderful Australian film from '06 titled `Opal Dreams' which is about a little girl with two imaginary friends. An undiscovered gem the entire family can enjoy.",4,"""Bianca's In Town For A Reason"" ~ A Bizarre Rite Of Passage",1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,2217,"['Synopsis', 'Lars', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'out', 'quiet', 'solitary', 'existence', 'garage', 'family', 'house', 'small', 'town', 'located', 'somewhere', 'Midwest', 'America', 'likeable', 'evasive', 'Lars', 'never', 'come', 'grips', 'loss', 'Mother', 'childbirth', 'ensuing', 'grief', 'Father', 'death', 'abandonment', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'moved', 'out', 'shortly', 'tragic', 'event', 'Many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Lars', 'now', 'mid', 'late', 'twenties', 'discover', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'unorthodox', 'way', 'deal', 'trauma', 'been', 'sealed', 'up', 'inside', 'Lars', 'purchased', 'life', 'size', 'silicon', 'doll', 'named', 'Bianca', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'sister-in-law', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'love', 'life', 'consulting', 'town', 'physican/psychologist', 'Lars', 'delusion', 'allowed', 'extend', 'community-at-large', 'church', 'workplace', 'everywhere', 'Will', 'time', 'communal', 'support', 'eventually', 'bring', 'Lars', 'back', 'reality', 'realization', 'Bianca', 'nothing', 'more', 'doll', 'doomed', 'live', 'out', 'delusion', 'very', 'end', 'Critique', 'When', 'dealing', 'complicated', 'intricate', 'psychic', 'constructs', 'lead', 'such', 'interior', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'social', 'maladies', 'isolation', 'alienation', 'one', 'will', 'discover', 'surefire', 'therapeutic', 'practice', 'guide', 'one', 'Dark', 'Night', 'Soul', 'dawning', 'glorious', 'new', 'day', 'dark', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', ""'07"", 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'tackles', 'difficult', 'issues', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'main', 'character', 'action', 'slow', 'times', 'tedious', 'script', 'cleverly', 'nuanced', 'dialogue', 'layered', 'meaning', 'insight', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'lot', 'Lars', ""'re"", 'attentive.Rating', 'ways', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'more', 'meditative', 'introspective', 'rite', 'passage', 'anything', 'else', 'When', 'approached', 'mind', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', '-4', 'Stars-', 'designation.P.S', 'like', 'film', ""'ll"", 'also', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'Australian', 'film', 'titled', 'Opal', 'Dreams', 'little', 'girl', 'two', 'imaginary', 'friends', 'undiscovered', 'gem', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

On this occasion Lars and the Real Girl was able to do so purely based on the title and cover art. Said cover art showcases Ryan Gosling sitting on a wooden shipping crate, holding yellow roses, and sporting a cookie-duster mustache that would make Ned Flanders envious.As most could guess, the story centers around Lars(Gosling), a painfully withdrawn young man that lives in the garage next to his brother Gus and his wife Karin(Paul Schneider and Emily Mortimer). On the surface Lars appears to be an anti-social loner who works at what appears to be a computer company. However, Karin is quite concerned about Lars, while Gus believes he just takes after his father's personality.We soon learn that there are many traumatic events that have led up to the situation at hand. Most of which stems from the death of Lars' Mother, which occured upon his birth.So with Lars growing up devoid of motherly affection we are practically handed the reasoning for his lack of connection with those around him. But are we to believe that the whole town would play along with this facade for the sake of a troubled young man? Writer Nancy Oliver must have been banking on the audience understanding the setting was not a place where Lars would have been ostracized from the community for his delusional frame of mind. And honestly, I can say yes, it works.The film also works because we are rooting for Lars to snap out of his funk and end up together with the girl at work, Margo(Kelli Garner). At times it almost seems as if the entire charade with Bianca the ""love doll"" was intentionally put on by Lars as a way for him to work up the courage to dive into a relationship with Margo.All of the performances are well done, but Gosling easily carries the film on his shoulders. It was also quite fun to see him embody a character that many people could relate to, which is something I haven't seen him do in any of his recent work.Lars and the Real Girl has a fresh take on what it means to come to terms with your situation in life in regards to love, family, and lonliness. The idea of Ryan Gosling parading around with a fake girlfriend may take some getting used to, but the audience should find themselves embracing the the scenario around the same time as the people surrounding Lars do.",4,"Lars, the real girl, and a mustache",1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,2365,"['Once', 'great', 'am', 'able', 'come', 'DVD', 'curiousity', 'occasion', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'purely', 'based', 'title', 'cover', 'art', 'Said', 'cover', 'art', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'sitting', 'wooden', 'shipping', 'crate', 'holding', 'yellow', 'roses', 'sporting', 'cookie-duster', 'mustache', 'would', 'make', 'Ned', 'Flanders', 'envious.As', 'most', 'could', 'guess', 'story', 'centers', 'Lars', 'Gosling', 'painfully', 'withdrawn', 'young', 'man', 'garage', 'next', 'brother', 'Gus', 'wife', 'Karin', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'surface', 'Lars', 'be', 'anti-social', 'loner', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'computer', 'company', 'However', 'Karin', 'quite', 'concerned', 'Lars', 'Gus', 'just', 'father', 'personality.We', 'soon', 'learn', 'are', 'many', 'traumatic', 'events', 'have', 'led', 'up', 'situation', 'hand', 'Most', 'death', 'Lars', 'Mother', 'occured', 'birth.So', 'Lars', 'growing', 'up', 'devoid', 'motherly', 'affection', 'are', 'practically', 'handed', 'reasoning', 'lack', 'connection', 'are', 'believe', 'whole', 'town', 'would', 'play', 'along', 'facade', 'sake', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'Writer', 'Nancy', 'Oliver', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'banking', 'audience', 'understanding', 'setting', 'was', 'not', 'place', 'where', 'Lars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ostracized', 'community', 'delusional', 'frame', 'mind', 'honestly', 'can', 'say', 'yes', 'works.The', 'film', 'also', 'are', 'rooting', 'Lars', 'snap', 'funk', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'girl', 'work', 'Margo', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'times', 'almost', 'entire', 'charade', 'Bianca', 'love', 'doll', 'was', 'intentionally', 'put', 'Lars', 'way', 'work', 'up', 'courage', 'dive', 'relationship', 'Margo.All', 'performances', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Gosling', 'easily', 'film', 'shoulders', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'fun', 'see', 'embody', 'character', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'relate', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'do', 'recent', 'work.Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'fresh', 'take', 'what', 'come', 'terms', 'situation', 'life', 'regards', 'love', 'family', 'lonliness', 'idea', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'parading', 'around', 'fake', 'girlfriend', 'may', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'audience', 'should', 'find', 'embracing', 'scenario', 'same', 'time', 'people', 'surrounding', 'Lars', 'do']",N/A

Bianca, though a life size doll, does a pretty good job, too, considering. She was treated on the set as a real person, just as she is treated by Lars and the townsfolk as a real person. The Midwestern Milieu--think Fargo but without such extreme accents--in which the film takes place seems to be quite a nurturing environment. On the advice of Lars' therapist his brother--reluctantly--and his sister-in-law--much more enthusiastically--go along with his delusion. Soon the whole town has accepted Bianca into their lives.----------------Kurt: Listen up, Margo; those action figures are very important to me. They're worth a lot of money. And if I don't see every damned one back on my desk pretty soon, then, you can tell your teddy to watch his back.Margo: [returns one action figure] I'll return them, one at a time... You going to Cindy's party?Lars Lindstrom: Oh, no.Margo: I was hoping you would. I really wish you would.Lars Lindstrom: Do you think I could bring my girlfriend?Margo: Oh, um, yeah, yeah, I'm totally bringing somebodyLars Lindstrom: Hm.=============================When you think how easily the premise could lead to tasteless scenes and situations, you'll be thankful that Lars is a very proper and respectful young man who just has issues with intimacy. Sure, there are lots of humorous scenes, but it never crosses the line. Besides watching the town warm up to Bianca, a big part of the fun is watching co-worker Margo with her not-so-secret crush on Lars, and watching the emotionally frozen Lars gradually thaw. Garner was fabulous as Rebecca in Thumbsucker, and Gosling is perhaps best known for The Notebook.

Is there anything positive in the development of this story that could not have been achieved without the doll in nearly every community in America ?  If the doll is completely unnecessary then why tell the story in the first place ?  How does this completely unnecessary story become a movie ?  Does anything that happens in the movie cause us to search our souls ?  If so, I wonder if the story and the movie has made any of the right choices.  I think that the strongest moral value in the story comes from the example of the community rallying around the troubled Lars and accepting his ""friend"" into their circle.  Certainly this is far-fetched but in the fantasy-upon-fantasy world of the author this has had a socially acceptable impact, restoring the troubled Lars to community-normal behavior.  This is good for the community.  This appears to be good for Lars, especially in the eyes of his family and friends.  Bianca D I E D !  It was Lars that decided that she was sick (After finding out that the girl from the office that he had always had a crush on had broken up with the guy from the office that he didn't like.)  Is that healthy ?  Is such behavior something that we want to encourage ?  It's just another soap opera.  A soap opera with a twist, perhaps.  Just a Chick Flick.

He goes to work every day then he comes home to the garage apartment he lives in, adjacent to the house he grew up in and is now owned by his brother and sister-in-law.As his pregnant sister-in-law's due date gets closer, Lars seems to emotionally and physically withdraw from his family and co-workers.  Preferring to remain in the comforting small walls of his garage apartment, he starts garnering the concern of his sister-in-law.  She fears he is too lonely and when all her attempts to include him and spend more time with him fail it seems all hope is lost.

1146122,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0014D5RBE,Chris Pandolfi,"[11, 13]","In ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" Ryan Gosling plays a damaged young man who lives a delusion: he orders a life-sized sex doll from the Internet and interacts with it as if it were an actual living person. In order to help him work through this, the small town he lives in plays along, going so far as to include the doll as a member of the community. Clearly, this idea is completely unrealistic, downright implausible. But somehow, in some maddeningly unexplainable way, this film manages to be both engaging and endearing. Much like the character of Lars, we also buy into a delusional premise and see it through to the end. The film itself is the delusion, one of the most enjoyable delusions I've experienced this year.Almost as soon as the film begins, Lars' situation is made clear--despite having a job, despite being able to function on a daily basis, he's socially paralyzed, unable to strike up even the shortest of conversations. He avoids people like the plague, and should anyone try to approach him, he tenses up and looks away, retreating into a bubble that he doesn't want burst. No one understands this better than his pregnant sister-in-law, Karin (Emily Mortimer), who tries so hard to include him in her life that it's overbearing. Her husband, Gus (Paul Schneider)--who's also Lars' brother--is nowhere near as persistent, not because he doesn't love Lars, but because he just doesn't understand him. And since Lars lives in Gus' converted garage, which was built separately from the main house, neither he nor his wife have to travel far to see him.One day at work, Lars is shown a website that sells life-sized, anatomically correct female sex dolls. It's easy to assume that Lars has absolutely no interest in sex; I'd be surprised if he has even gotten his first kiss. We do know that Lars finds pretty much any form of physical contact painful, especially hugs. He describes the sensation later in the movie: being touched feels as uncomfortable as frozen feet suddenly warming up. We never really understand why he feels this way, but then again, we don't need to understand. It's enough to know that growing up, he was left alone with a heartbroken single father. What is important is that Lars' needs are strictly emotional; quite simply, this man is incredibly lonely.So imagine Karin and Gus' excitement when they hear that Lars has a visitor. And then imagine their shock when they discover that his ""visitor"" is actually a doll. Lars, of course, doesn't see things the same way; in his mind, his visitor is a woman named Bianca, a religious, handicapped young woman who's half Brazilian, half Danish. He says that they met on the Internet. In their confusion and frustration, Karin and Gus seek psychological counseling for Lars, and he receives it under the guise of Bianca's medical treatment (she has a disease that results in low blood pressure). Here enters Dr. Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson), a physician/psychologist who understands that Lars is using this delusion to fill some kind of void. She feels that only he can work through it--no one can convince him that his ""girlfriend"" is an inanimate object. The only thing that Karin and Gus can do is play along until Lars decides to give it up.The rest of the film follows an altogether charming path of discovery, not only in terms of Lars, but also in terms of those closest to him (as close as they can get, anyway). The community at large begins to accept Bianca as a regular person, including her in school functions, hospital visits, and even as a display model for a department store. Watching Lars interact with Bianca is like watching a child playing with his or her favorite toy--a young imagination attaches so much significance to toys, and often times, the creativity levels skyrocket. A cardboard box becomes an impenetrable fort. A plastic car becomes an intergalactic spaceship. And yes, a doll becomes a child's best friend. The conversations between Lars and Bianca speak volumes, despite using everyday language. Example: when Bianca is given a flower arrangement, Lars says something to the effect of, ""They'll last forever because they're fake. Isn't that nice?""Gus is the only person reluctant to take part in Lars' delusion. His initial reaction is selfish: How will the town think of him, knowing that his brother is mentally unstable? But as the film progresses, Gus' emotional layers peel away, revealing shame and guilt over abandoning Lars at such a young age. It doesn't help that Bianca ""sleeps"" at his house, specifically in the bedroom once occupied by his mother (who is also a significant character, despite not appearing in the film). As much as Gus would hate to admit it, Bianca seems to have had a positive effect on the community, albeit an unconventional one. In an odd sort of way, she's even responsible for the growing relationship between Lars and a living woman--his coworker, Margo (Kelli Garner).It's this sense of social development and personal growth that made ""Lars and the Real Girl"" one of the most unexpectedly delightful films I've ever seen. No, it is not plausible in any way, shape, or form, and if it were telling any other story, I probably would have dismissed it. But in this case, that doesn't matter--it's not dependent on plausibility, but rather on emotion and its ability to resonate with the audience. And resonate, it does. I have no idea how it achieved this, I'm sorry to say. But whatever its method, this unbelievable movie is unbelievably good, working at the same wonderful, carefree level that a child's imagination works at.",5,A Boy and His Doll,1195516800,"11 20,

1146124,AJEEZORPA1A02,B0014D5RBE,"Christopher ""Mort Guffman""","[2, 2]","How do you show your friends you love them? What words do you use? What actions do you take? What objects in your life take on a meaning bigger than intended? ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is about how families, neighbors, and friends cope with mental illness.  But to stop there would be insincere.Lars is an introvert on the far end of the scale who avoids contact with others as much as possible. However, things change when Lars tells his brother and sister in law (his neighbors) that he has met someone - a woman. The problem is, that woman happens to be a sex doll named ""Bianca.""The movie is advertised in a way to make you assume it is (yet) another film about a quirky guy/girl whom the world just doesn't get. Even the back of the DVD box makes it seem like it is a romantic story about finding true love, as though ""Lars"" is a sort of off beat romantic comedy. However, this is not a flat, callous movie with alienating ""catch-quirk"" characters (like Napolean Dynamite or Juno). Lars is different. It takes its characters and themes way below the surface.""Lars"" works on multiple levels. Many people have wondered what therapy would be like if they went. Look no further than here. Patricia Clarkson's character is written and acted so well (playing both an MD and a therapist - which is true of smaller towns), that I felt as though I was peering in on a master therapist at work. For example, many of us might ask Lars about Bianca and try to ""fix"" or understand the problem. However, when Lars is first presented to the therapist, she doesn't ask. She lets Lars tell her when he is ready. Her focus is on her professional, yet intimate relationship with Lars. She is not concerned with hurriedly fixing a ""problem.""Second, Lars's family reaction and coping to his diagnosis is very real. When they are told what Lars has, one member wants to fix it right away. ""How long does this illness last?"" ""What medicine can he take that will change him quickly?"" ""Won't this be embarrassing?"" The other simply asks, ""How can we help?"" It is a perfect response to someone in crisis. Watching not only the family, but the town characters love Lars is a workable template for how we can respond to those in crisis.This is where the film got unrealistic to me. There is no way that a large group of people could love someone so much. On my first viewing, this ruined the movie for me because I assumed it was asking me to ""watch"" a silly movie. However, on my second viewing, the film simply asked ""what if?"" What if a group of people truly loved so much that they selflessly held and walked with someone without advice giving, ""shoulds,"" or nagging? There is one powerful line where a character says ""That's what friends do in times of crisis. They sit and they wait."" Job's comforters are nowhere to be found and it powerfully relates to the viewer how we can love others in times of unknown. We can simply sit, wait, and listen.Thematically, ""Lars and the Real Girl"" can be boiled down to being a movie about love in several forms. While there is much to say about this, I most want to comment on another theme of the movie - the themes of projection and attachment. It is important that we consider when we watch the film what the power of individual objects can be for us. Lars's condition is not one without relation. ""Bianca"" is very much a real person in spite of her plastic frame. She is real because Lars projects onto her what is real to him. He projects onto her a relationship where Bianca is the manifestation of Lars's reality. For Lars to be that vulnerable and open with real people is too difficult for him.While this may seem strange, I would argue that what happens to Lars is something that has happened to you. How many of us can recall a doll, stuffed animal, invisible friend or other blank object who was real and existed to us? They had no identity and language, save for the way we made them to be. Those objects represented something to us. For Lars, Bianca is his means of dealing with physical touch, grief, and human relationship (among other things). She is blank canvas of emotions and attachment patterns that are unique to Lars.""Lars and the Real Girl"" is funny and painful with a tender texture. That is because these are what love and relationships at their most real can be. They can be funny, painful, selfless, intimate, and bear the birthmarks of the soul. When we love one another past our understanding of normal, the power of that love can be more than we really know.

Wait, wait, stop smirking...it gets better. We got jokes out the kazoo about Gosling `bathing' his girlfriend, `undressing' his girlfriend and putting his girlfriend `to bed.' Then...what'd you say...how much do we want? Well, we estimate $90 million without CGI, $140 million with CGI. What's the CGI for? Just look at these sketches. We'll use CGI to make the plastic doll do things, if you get our meaning. What? You'll finance for $140 million with a 15 percent off-budget kickback and you want a set of the sketches? Done!""The Farrelly Brothers, thank goodness, didn't make Lars and the Real Girl. It's a small, independent film written by Nancy Oliver and directed by Craig Gillespie. It's a gentle story about Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling), a nice, delusional young man everyone in his town likes, but Lars is dealing with a lot of problems. He's so shy and withdrawn it's painful. He can't stand being touched. He spends his evenings sitting in a chair in the small remodeled garage he lives in, just staring out the window at the snow. His brother, Gus (Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law, Karin (Emily Mortimer), who live in the family house next to the garage, try to bring him into their lives. Lars is so uncomfortable with others it takes a lot of persistence for Karin even to get him to walk a few yards over for dinner. But then Lars by chance sees a website that features love dolls. A few days later a large box is delivered to the family house. It's not long before Lars tells Gus and Karin that he'll be by for dinner...with his girlfriend, Bianca, a young woman who is confined to a wheelchair because she can't walk, doesn't speak English and is passive to a fault. The relationship is so innocent and touching that it soon is clear, helped by the family doctor played by Patricia Clarkson, that Lars may be trying to deal with his strangeness in his own way. And, says Dagmar the doctor, it would be best to accept his fantasies with matter-of-fact courtesy and understanding. Lars is doing no harm. It's not long before everyone in town has not only met Bianca, but accepts her...and we know they are doing this because they genuinely care for Lars Lindstrom and want the best for him. As Bianca, with Lars by her side, goes to meetings and dances (she's even elected to the school board), we can see that Dagmar may be right about Lars.What happens to Lars? What happens to Bianca? Let's just say that there is a death in the family and we later leave the movie happy and content. Lars and the Real Girl doesn't have a smirk or a smutty joke in sight. It's a touching and sweet movie, well acted, intelligently written and directed...and based on an absurd premise.

His brother, Gus, and wife, Karin, are both worried about him since he seems to spend an awful lot of time alone. Saying he's shy would be a massive understatement. When a woman speaks to him, he is pretty much incapable of responding. Physical contact from anyone is painful to him. Friends and family think he should get a girlfriend. When a co-worker shows him a site that sells love dolls, he shows little interest at first but winds up warming up to the idea. Once Bianca enters the picture, she winds up changing Lars and the town that he lives in for the better.I had heard a lot about this movie within the past year or so and hadn't gotten around to seeing it until now. I honestly kept putting it off. How could a movie about a guy carrying around a sex doll be any good? It was interesting because I wound up really enjoying it. I guess when you get right down to it, I can relate to Lars more than a lot of other people. I don't run around buying sex dolls thinking they're real or anything, but I'm also very shy and could kind of put myself into Lars' shoes more often than not.Ryan Gosling fits this role perfectly. I hadn't really seen anything with him that I was really impressed with until now. The quirks he's capable of portraying in this role were as awkward as they were charming. The way he pulls off talking to a doll for over an hour and not only making it believable, but entertaining is also incredibly impressive.The movie is labeled as a comedy, but I didn't really find myself laughing out loud all too often throughout most of the film. It's not really that kind of comedy. It has this Garden State kind of feel to it, where it's not gutbustingly hilarious but there's a certain charm to it that keeps you watching. At its roots, it's very heartfelt which may not be something everyone is expecting from the trailer or plot synopsis.Lars and the Real Girl is a film that relies on awkward situations or rather a rare occurrence that winds up causing multiple awkward situations and it focuses on people's reactions to these situations that occur. It's worth seeing for Lars' odd behavior and the snowball effect it causes. I may have enjoyed it a bit more than others since I felt I probably related to the main character more than others might and it felt like I heard the same amount of hype for this as I did for Garden State or Juno, but I felt like this was as strong as those films if not stronger.Rating: 8/10",4,"Awkward, Unusual, and Incredibly Charming.",1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2508,"['Lars', 'good', 'guy', 'missing', 'something', 'life', 'brother', 'Gus', 'wife', 'Karin', 'are', 'worried', 'spend', 'awful', 'lot', 'time', 'alone', 'Saying', 'shy', 'would', 'be', 'massive', 'understatement', 'When', 'woman', 'pretty', 'much', 'incapable', 'responding', 'Physical', 'contact', 'anyone', 'painful', 'Friends', 'family', 'think', 'should', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'When', 'co-worker', 'site', 'love', 'dolls', 'little', 'interest', 'first', 'up', 'warming', 'up', 'idea', 'Once', 'Bianca', 'picture', 'up', 'changing', 'Lars', 'town', 'better.I', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'movie', 'past', 'year', 'so', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'seeing', 'now', 'honestly', 'kept', 'putting', 'off', 'How', 'could', 'movie', 'guy', 'carrying', 'sex', 'doll', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'interesting', 'wound', 'up', 'really', 'enjoying', 'guess', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'can', 'relate', 'Lars', 'more', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'around', 'buying', 'sex', 'dolls', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'real', 'anything', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'shy', 'could', 'kind', 'put', 'Lars', 'shoes', 'more', 'often', 'not.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'fits', 'role', 'perfectly', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'anything', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'now', 'quirks', 'capable', 'portraying', 'role', 'were', 'as', 'awkward', 'were', 'charming', 'way', 'talking', 'doll', 'hour', 'not', 'only', 'making', 'believable', 'entertaining', 'also', 'incredibly', 'impressive.The', 'movie', 'labeled', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'too', 'often', 'most', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'kind', 'comedy', 'Garden', 'State', 'kind', 'feel', 'where', 'not', 'gutbustingly', 'hilarious', 'certain', 'charm', 'watching', 'roots', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'something', 'everyone', 'expecting', 'trailer', 'plot', 'synopsis.Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'film', 'awkward', 'situations', 'rather', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'up', 'causing', 'multiple', 'awkward', 'situations', 'people', 'reactions', 'situations', 'occur', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Lars', 'odd', 'behavior', 'snowball', 'effect', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'more', 'others', 'felt', 'probably', 'related', 'main', 'character', 'more', 'others', 'might', 'felt', 'heard', 'same', 'amount', 'hype', 'did', 'Garden', 'State', 'Juno', 'felt', 'was', 'as', 'strong', 'films', 'not', 'stronger.Rating', '8/10']",N/A

1146136,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0014D5RBE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","Call it audacious, perhaps even risky but who would ever imagine a film that revolved around a character in love with an anatomically correct doll?Well, that film titled ""Lars and the Real Girl"" was made into a reality in 2007 and it became a critically acclaimed film and nominated for several awards. The film is directed by Craig Gillespie (""United States of Tara"", ""Mr. Woodcock"") and earned an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Writing (Original Screenplay)"" and also received a Golden Globe Award nomination for ""Best Actor in a Motion Picture Comedy"" for actor Ryan Gosling.The concept of this film is from writer and producer Nancy Oliver (""Six Feet Under"", ""True Blood"") who got the idea while perusing on the Internet and finding the website realdoll.com.  A company that creates anatomically correct sex dolls and she wondered about the lonely men who actually purchase these dolls but instead of creating a script that could have been kitschy and ridiculous, she was able to craft an intelligently written film with humor and a fresh take on love, life and a person's path to wellness after suffering some sort of a trauma in his life which he has had difficulty recovering from.The film revolves around a man named Lars Lindstrom (played by Ryan Gosling, ""The Notebook"", ""Half Nelson"", ""Remember the Titans"").  Lar's is pretty much an anti-social person who is able to work and go to church but he has pretty much stayed cooped up inside the garage behind the house left to him and his older brother Gus (played by Paul Schneider, ""Bright Star"", ""The Assasination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") by their deceased father.For so long, Gus' wife Karin (played by Emily Mortimer, ""Pink Panther"" films, ""Shutter Island"") has been trying his best to get Lars out of the garage, to have breakfast, lunch or dinner with them.  Unfortunately, Gus always comes up with a reason why he can't join them.But for Gus, he knows that his co-worker Margo (played by Kelli Garner, ""The Aviator"", ""Thumbsucker"") likes him but he tries to ignore her most of the time.  One day, while at work, an employee that sits next to him, tells him about an anatomically correct doll that he saw on realgirl.com and wishes he could buy it.  For Gus, he doesn't really listen to this employee so he seems to act like he's not listening.But six months later, Gus receives a large package and out of nowhere, announces to his brother Gus and Karin that he has a female visitor that has arrived and asks them if she can stay in the guest bedroom and also if they can join them for dinner.For both Gus and Karin, this is fantastic news as they feel that Lars is now feeling better and getting out of the house and has met a woman.But to their surprise, what they see is a sex doll that he has named Bianca and for Lars, he treats this doll as a real person.  Lars tells them that she is a missionary and by the look on his face, he looks very happy.Afraid that Lars may be a sick man, Gus and Karin come up with a plan that since Bianca has just arrived, it's a good idea for her to go see Doctor Dagmar (played by Patricia Clarkson, ""The Pledge"", ""Shutter Island"", ""The Green Mile""), since she is also a psychologist.What Gus and Karin find out is that Lars is suffering from a delusion disorder and for now, he and Karin should pretend Bianca is a real person for Lars' sake.  And because Lars wants to introduce his girlfriend to everyone, because they live in a small community, Gus and Karin prepares the community about Lars and Bianca's relationship and that she is a sex doll.And the interesting thing is that the church and members of the community and people at Lars' work want to see him get better, so everyone gets into the act by befriending Bianca and pretending its a real being.  In fact, the community grows stronger as Bianca becomes one of them, from taking part in community events, reading to the children (via using a tape recorder) and so forth.Meanwhile, Dr. Dagmar uses each session that is supposed to be for Bianca to examine Lars and it is learned that Lars' mother died when she gave birth to him and both brothers were raised by their father who was heartbroken and became distant.  For Gus, he couldn't take it and left his brother alone with his father.  And because of that, Lars is unable to have any kind of intimacy.  It's so bad that he doesn't want anyone to touch him and he fears of having children, even worried about his brother and his pregnant wife.Will Lars be able to grow out of his delusion that Bianca is a real woman?  Will he be able to find happiness?VIDEO:""Lars and the Real Girl"" is presented in 1080p (widescreen 1:85:1).  Picture quality is very good for this film as you can see the detail for example of Bianca (the doll) and just the overall atmosphere (in this case, the majority of the film was shot during the winter).  Skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep and I saw no signs of compression artifacts, dirt or any speckles.  Also, there is a good amount of grain throughout the film.For the most part, PQ for ""Lars and the Real Girl"" looked very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Lars and the Real Girl"" is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, the film is primarily center and front channel-driven.  This is a dialogue-heavy film and while you may hear the occasional car being driven in the snow or the crowd at a bowling alley via the surround channels, for the most part, this is an all-dialogue film and the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for this film.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Lars and the Real Girl"" comes with the following special features:* Deleted Scene - (:54) Featuring a single deleted scene titled ""Bathtub"" that revolved around Lars and Margo.* The real story of Lars and the real girl - (10:11) Director Craig Gillespie and Nancy Oliver talk about the script and the creation of the movie, while cast members talked about what attracted them to the script.* A Real Leading Lady - (5:55) The cast and crew talk about working with the doll that plays Bianca.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:24) Featuring the original theatrical trailer to ""Lars and the Real Girl"".JUDGMENT CALL:As I was watching ""Lars and the Real Girl"", I was very surprised when I saw the sex doll and how it was being used as a character.  This was very bold for a film and literally, this film could have gone downhill and literally be recorded into halls of shame of moviemaking.  But instead, screenwriter Nancy Oliver was able to craft an intelligent, entertaining and humorous film.Not only was it touching but it was a unique film that you would never expect being made and because it was well-written and well-acted, ""Lars and the Real Girl"" became one of the critically acclaimed films of 2007.And the sad thing is that although it was audacious and intriguing to watch a story about a man who literally falls in love with a sex doll and sees it as an actual person, when you look at today's society and reading about people who turn out for an animated character's funeral, a person marrying a video game character, people who have a disconnect with reality and are actually falling for virtual characters, unfortunately, the concept doesn't seem so far-fetched these days.But ""Lars and the Real Girl"" is actually a film that goes a bit deeper and explores why Lars would be delusional.  This is a man who was literally scarred by the fact that his birth caused his mother's death and the fact that his older brother couldn't take their father's depression and ran off, leaving Lars alone with his father probably added a lot to his lack of intimacy.  Not getting any love for his father and who knows if the father blamed the son for their mother's death.  What we do know is that he carries his baby blanket all the time and is unable to feel or share any intimacy.And I suppose when he has Bianca in his life, there is a little part of him that knows that because she is not real, it is OK for him to show intimacy by holding hands and being around her.  A little bit of him that feels that she will always be there for him. And he has that in his mind and thus sees Bianca as an actual woman.But the surprising part of this film was how it showed Lars family accepting Bianca and doing what the doctor told them to do and pretend she is real and seeing the church and the community support them in order to help Lars.  Once again, this could have been such a kitschy, lamebrain film but its not.  Nancy Oliver did a remarkable job by tastefully showing us how Lars is able to grow but also with the help of Dr. Dagmar, the pain he must feel in his heart in order to say goodbye.The acting is also well-done for this film.  Ryan Gossling is fantastic playing the awkward Lars and Emily Mortimer and Paul Schneider, including Kelli Garner and Patricia Clarkson also did a solid job as well.  But it's Gossling who was able to play the character naturally.  Well done!As for the Blu-ray release of ""Lars and the Real Girl"", while it may not be a special features heavy release nor is there an audio commentary track, this film is so unique and awkward from any movie you will possibly see in your entire life but it is tastefully done.""Lars and the Real Girl"" was a film that went under the radar because it only received a limited release in theaters.  But it will probably be one of the most unusual love stories that you will ever see in your life and one that you will probably never forget.Definitely recommended!",4,"Unique, Unusual and awkward...but well-written, wonderful acting by Ryan Gosling, definitely recommended!",1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,9550,"['Call', 'audacious', 'perhaps', 'even', 'risky', 'who', 'would', 'ever',

Sounds goofy, right?  But if you are expecting lewd, frat-boy hijinks and cheap innuendo, you will be pleasantly mistaken.""Lars And The Real Girl"" portrays a young man who is mentally troubled, and who develops a delusion as a way of dealing with his anxieties. The film has a substantive emotional core that quickly elevates the story out of novelty status and, more importantly, several great performances that bring the characters to life.  Patricia Clarkson, an always-superb indie actor, steals the show in her turn as a local small-town family doctor who is able to connect with the troubled Lars and nudge him towards stability. Ryan Gosling gives an oddly charming performance as the troubled but likable Lars, and the rest of the supporting cast is quite strong as well.This film is a nice break from the relentless diet of cheap violence, deadening sex and trivial irony that has flooded the pop culture landscape. It has its quirks and flaws, but it is thoughtful, inventive and original enough to make it a compelling choice for film fans who are ready for something refreshing and new.

But after it was nominated for several Academy Awards, I thought there was probably more to it than the previews indicated.  And I was right, it is an incredible story.  The first half is hilarious.  The second half is unbelievably sad.  The best comedy/drama I've ever seen.  *Spoilers!* Lars buys a sex doll off the internet, and tells everyone she's his girlfriend.  At first people are dumbfounded and flabbergasted.  When the shock wears off, they make fun of him.  What they don't realize is that Lars' neurosis makes him incapable of touching anyone, or being touched by anyone.  Touch on his bare skin actually causes him physical pain.  It is very touching to see how his small family and the entire town go from riduculing him to accepting his delusion and playing into it, for Lars' sake.  The actors do a phenomenal job.

To me this was a story of what the world SHOULD be like in regards to the way people with emotional or physical disabilities are treated. A lot of people I've talked to who didn't like the movie cite their reason as the way the townspeople treated Lars.

True, the idea of a guy courting a full-sized anatomically correct doll could be humorous, and was also a little strange. And indeed, there are some humorous moments, such as when Lars takes Bianca (the doll) to have dinner with his brother and sister-in-law. The look of disbelief, horror, and consternation on the faces of his brother and sister-in-law as they sit across from Lars and Bianca is precious, and made me laugh uproariously.However, despite its humorous moments, this is not a funny movie. It is the story of a town that rallies around Lars as he goes through whatever he has to in order to work through the pain that he has felt from his early youth when his father died and which has kept him from being able to relate to real people in any meaningful way. And so gradually the people in this small, northern town (I'm guessing in Minnesota) come to accept Bianca and treat her as a real girl, all of which (along with the sympathetic understanding of a psychotherapist) allows Lars to realize that he can let go of Bianca and relate to others as real people.This is a truly poignant movie and a paean to the best tendencies in human nature.

Guided by a local physician (who seems free of the usual restrictions on time, copayments and paperwork), he begins to heal. After all, says one church member, many people have ""odd"" relatives who dress up their cats or steal other people's earrings. A doll is no big deal.So Lars is allowed to carry out his fantasy with the full support of the entire town. By supporting Lars they experience emotional growth too.I gave the film 4 stars because even for a film, it's too improbable. Involvement of some services would actually be against the law.In an ideal world, people would be allowed to grow and heal themselves naturally, with community intervention, as Lars did. He was neither pathologized or stigmatized...and that's luckier than most people would be. I agree with reviewers who said there should have been at least a couple of negative reactions from the community.Then again, small towns can be remarkably tolerant of eccentricity. Everybody sees everybody else all the time.I wonder how many of us use our dogs and cats as surrogate friends when we're lonely. I've been tempted to skip boring social events to stay home with the dog (and sometimes I do).

Some people think it is a comedy.  They completely miss its depth. I won't recap the plot. You can get that from the other reviews.This movie is about loneliness, isolation, and alienation in the age of Internet and technology. Profoundly touching and brilliantly creative, this movie pulls off the impossible.Ryan Gosling drew me in as a believer from the first minute of the movie until the end.  He is so believable and so unself conscious in his acting.  I actually cried when his blow up doll, ""the real girl"" died.  The town held a funeral for her!  Instead of mocking Lars' break with reality, the town folk played along.Ryan Gosling sets himself apart as one of the greatest living actors of our time.  He is the anti-shallow in an era of Brittany Spears. (Trivia: As a youngster, Gosling was on Mickey Mouse club with Brittney Spears and Justin Timberlake.  He can sing and dance.)I found myself rooting for Lars, as if I were one of the townspeople.  Gosling's character is so deeply lonely; you will get a lump in your throat.  At the same time, he is averse to human touch and feels physical pain when touched.  Yet he deeply yearns for love.  In the end, love triumphs.  Lars' humanity rises up. He conquers his fears and emerges from his delusion.  He grows.You will love this movie.  Humanity is depicted in its quintessential state,  very generous.

I pushed pause and double-checked the description ... yes, comedy. I returned to the film confused and trying to decipher if there was something amiss with me (I'm not an emotional person, let alone hyperemotional) or with the film ... I ultimately decided the fault resides with whomever billed this work as a comedy.Ryan Gosling lends the character of Lars (a deeply disturbed man) tremendous sensitivity. Through facial expressions and body language, Gosling communicates the torment that Lars cannot verbally articulate. The honest portrayal of Lars' supportive yet struggling family is gripping. Their justified pessimism (""he may never get better"") and embarrassment translates as genuine ... and painful. The love they provide Lars is touching -- the viewer is compelled to wonder if he/she embodies such compassion.And while the manner in which his surrounding community embraces Lars may seem improbable to most, if you are from a small town you know your share of eccentrics ... and you know how a community can rally around these folks. Watching Lars' neighbors lend support is initially tense (how long will they humor this man?) and ultimately reaffirming.I think the actor who genuinely makes this film compelling is Patricia Clarkson (who plays Lar's physician). Her performance is warm yet nuanced. The viewer is drawn to her character's wisdom and benevolence... she is the film's point of stability.Yes, this work may have had some (uncomfortable) laughs, but there is an intense sense of tragedy which overrides the humor. But, that's why we love indie films, because they are complicated ... because they don't offer easy answers.

1146147,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0014D5RBE,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","This 2007 film's askew sensibilities and deadpan manner will be familiar to anyone who has watched HBO'sSix Feet Underwith any regularity since six episodes were written by the film's screenwriter, Nancy Oliver. However, coupled with Craig Gillespie's thoughtful and gently sauntering direction, her script has an added dimension of humanism that grounds the preposterous-sounding concept of a socially awkward, small-town bachelor who becomes enamored with a blow-up doll. The premise would seem ideal for Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell, but this is not a flat-out, slapstick comedy. It's actually a whimsical allegory that touches on serious issues related to emotional isolation and the unacknowledged inability to handle personal loss.The story focuses on 27-year old Lars Lindstrom, who lives in a garage apartment next to his older brother Gus and his pregnant wife Karin. Although she is the one who keeps cajoling Lars to join them for dinner and get him out of his shell, it is Lars' childish co-worker Kurt who inspires him to find a safe way to find a mate - by mail order in a big crate. Enter Bianca, the life-like mannequin whom Lars fantasizes to be a wheelchair-bound, orphaned registered nurse who happens to be a Brazilian missionary. He is so smitten with Bianca that Gus and Karin, both dumbfounded by this turn of events, seek the counsel of local physician and psychotherapist Dr. Dagmar, who recognizes Lars' dependence on Bianca as a serious mental illness that will require the rest of the town to treat Bianca as if she is alive. This is when the movie charms the most as if we have entered a Frank Capra alterna-universe of unconditional goodwill. The treat is in experiencing how far Gillespie, Oliver and the cast are willing to take us in having us embrace Bianca as a vital member of the community and how events being to challenge Lars' lifelong insulation from the rest of the world.Ideal casting has a lot to do with this special film's success beginning with Ryan Gosling's low-wattage turn as Lars. Although his emphatic blinking is a bit too theatrical a tic for such a potentially cartoonish character, the versatile actor (Half Nelson) manages to internalize Lars' pain in subtle, often painstaking ways. His quiet performance also helps make this movie much more of a seamless ensemble piece than it could have been with outstanding work from Paul Schneider (the smitten cop Brad inThe Family Stone) as Gus in mercurial states of confusion, frustration and familial guilt; Emily Mortimer (the clueless wife Chloe in Woody Allen'sMatch Point) submerging her Britishness to bring a convincing, eager-to-please freshness to Karin; the always dependable Patricia Clarkson as the almost matter-of-fact Dr. Dagmar; and Kelli Garner (unrecognizable as the sickly Calista inDreamland) best of all as Lars' perky, infatuated co-worker Margo. This is a film that brings unexpected joy through a level of character nuance too rarely found in American films today. At the same time, while it skirts the issue of mental illness, it does approximate its profound effects through its small, life-size moments rather than dramatically manipulative scenes.

1146149,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B0014D5RBE,Elisabeth,"[1, 1]","Lars (played by Ryan Gosling) is a recluse who wants to keep it that way.  Family members, church members, and co-workers all try to bring Lars out of his shell, but he refuses to let them know him.  He even wears multi-layered clothing as a barrier to keep people from touching him, especially women, whom he fears the most.However, although it seems like Lars is content in keeping his lifestyle just the way it is, one day he does something completely out of character.  He buys an anatomically correct, life-size, and lifelike doll and announces to his brother and sister-in-law that this doll, whom he's named Bianca, is his new girlfriend.Understandably, they're shocked, but especially his brother who thinks that Lars has gone insane.Not knowing what else to do, the couple decide to play along with Lars's fantasy. They tell Lars they think Bianca is sick and needs to go see a doctor...but really, the doctor is for Lars.The doctor soon realizes that instead of being a detriment to Lars's life, the doll can actually be a helpful tool for Lars.  Everything that Lars is afraid to say out loud, he can pretend that Bianca is the one saying out loud.  Every event he's afraid to go to, he can pretend it's really Bianca who wants to go and he's going along because that's what a good boyfriend does.  Bianca becomes a way for Lars to finally communicate with others.  She's also a non-threatening way for him to discover his romantic side.It's kind of like play therapy, except for an adult.His metamorphosis is beautiful to watch...but also painful to watch, too.Before I saw this movie, I saw the movie The Notebook also starring Gosling and I thought Gosling's performance in that movie was lackluster (except towards the end).However, in this movie, my perception of him as an actor has changed.  I enjoyed seeing his interpretation of the character Lars.  He easily could've made Lars into a comical figure, which he does somewhat, but mostly he makes Lars into a sympathetic figure.There's a scene where he's slow dancing by himself at a party that moved me to tears.  Although his head is down, you can see him crying...but also smiling.  It's evident he wants so badly to join the world, but doesn't know how.The scene where he has his first kiss with Bianca is also heartbreaking to watch, too.Both scenes were well acted by Gosling.However, this movie did also have its flaws.  Although I thought there was great acting by Ryan Gosling (Lars), Paul Schneider (Lars's brother), and Patricia Larkson (Lars & Bianca's doctor), I thought there was overacting by Kelli Garner (""the real girl"" from the movie title) and Emily Mortimer (Lars's sister-in-law).I also thought the movie tended to move too slowly...though I've seen movies that moved slower than this and put me to sleep, so this one wasn't too bad.  The story was compelling enough to allow me to hang in there.Another problem I had was that the character of Lars's brother could've been better developed.There's a scene where Lars's brother is talking to the doctor and he says, ""Everyone's gonna laugh at him.""  And the doctor replies, ""And you.""From here, I thought we were going to later see a transformation with the brother, too....that it wasn't just Lars who had issues, but the brother, too.It would've been nice then to have more details about the brothers' childhood since this obviously affected how Lars turned out the way he did...and could've also explained why there was so much emotional distance between the brothers.  These two things are vaguely described in the movie, but I craved more details.More detail would've made the story feel more real and even more tragic.But the biggest problem I had with the movie was how the whole town played along with Lars's fantasy.  I can understand his brother and sister-in-law playing along because they're family, but the whole town?  That seemed highly unlikely to happen...especially since there's scenes where the townspeople hang out with Bianca even when Lars isn't around.In another scene, they even play along by using an ambulance truck to escort Bianca to the hospital.  Can you imagine if a real emergency had occurred and they couldn't use that truck because it was transporting a doll?  How would they ever explain that to their superiors?So this unrealism pulled me out of the story a little bit.Because of these problems, I was thinking I'd be giving this movie a 4-star rating...but then the ending of the movie moved me to tears, so I bumped it up to a 5-star rating.

The real question, though, and the one that is most apropos to any viewer's enjoyment, is this: Will I buy into the concept that a life-sized doll can play an important role in a movie?For me, the resounding answer was ""Yes!"" The script and the subtle directing drew me into the idea and caused me to care about Lars' state of mind, and heart. This single man has a child-like quality and a desire for companionship, yet he's been inhibited by his own past and isolation. In his desire to survive, he comes up with a remarkable and startling idea of trying to form an actual friendship with a made-to-order doll from the Internet. In this role, Ryan Gosling walks a fine emotional line, showing us Lars' unstable but never mean-spirited psyche. The roles of Lars' brother and sister-in-law provide the necessary counterpoint, allowing moments of tenderness and humor that could've easily turned into farce.This is a funny, moving, and heartbreaking story, that manages to be a modern day fable of sorts while maintaining an air of realism. Although it's a stretch to believe that an entire town would go along with Lars' delusion, it works in this scenario, because it serves as a lesson of how far friends and family will go to show compassion to one in need. In so doing, they give Lars the freedom to face his own damaged soul and move forward.

Only the accents and the dialogue in general don't sound Minnesotan, and I kinda wonder why not.Given that we're all Scandihoovians together here, I can make some sense out of this film by thinking of it as a Hans Christian Andersen tale, a lot like The Little Mermaid or The Faithful Tin Soldier. Bittersweet, artificial and witty, and solidly moralistic at the core.

1146153,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0014D5RBE,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[8, 10]","Director Craig Gillespie espouses a New York state of mind, after directing very successful commercials for over 16 years. He was born in Sydney, Australia, and he graduated from a NYC Art School. His first feature film, MR. WOODCOCK (2007), tanked at the box office even though it starred Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon. It is possible that the movie released was not his director's cut, or his vision. The LA Times reported that David Dobkin was ""brought in"" to direct 3 weeks of re-shoots. Considering that most comedies of this ilk are shot in a month, it makes one wonder how much of Gillespie's film was left intact. Regardless, he has sprung back with a vengeance finishing up and releasing his second feature, LARS AND THE REAL GIRL (2007). It was shot in just 31 days. Gillespie had a momentary career as an actor in 1997, doing a walk on in HOTEL DE LOVE. He presently enjoys a reputation as an ""actor friendly"" kind of director, and he certainly managed to get wonderful performances from his entire cast on LARS.LARS was written by Nancy Oliver. She is a playwright, like Alan Ball another playwright that worked with her on the HBO series SIX FEET UNDER. She has what I consider an excellent ear for realistic dialogue. She has written a script for LARS where every character is important, necessary, and integral to the whole--pregnant with drama, humor, and the best kinds of human interaction. She and director Gillespie took a subject matter that easily could have lurched into a downward spiral of crudeness that would have made the Farrelly Brothers giddy. Remarkably, sensitively, no character in LARS is made a fool of, is forced to clown around or burlesque the situation, and is not ever expected to sink into a trite and crass caricature that must spew smut for smirks. Regardless of a lackluster trailer, or an ""iffy"" choice of plot device, understand that there is never anything scatological about LARS. Its inherent decency outshines its odd and unique turn of events.Ryan Gosling soars and shines in the lead role of Lars Lindstrom. Nominated for a Best Actor Oscar last year for HALF NELSON (2006), he seems to get better with every film role that comes his way -not bad for an actor who was a Mouseketeer with Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. His Lars is both heartfelt and gut-wrenching, done miraculously without raising his voice. His internal monologue was crystal clear to him, and the camera lens catches it all, the back story, the pain, the fear, and ultimately the joy. His eyes mirror miles of unspoken history, and he was not out of character for even a millisecond. His Lars is a laconic loner who chooses to live in the family garage, who holds down a good and solid job, who attends church regularly, who dresses well and acts appropriately in public. He was not mentally ill; rather mentally still born, wound up as tight as a Rolex mainspring, a man who would rather sit in solitude than embrace ""acceptable"" levels of socialization.Lars' brother, Gus (Paul Schneider), and sister-in-law, Karin (Emily Mortimer) try repeatedly to draw Lars feet first out of his preferred loneliness. It is Karin mostly who leads the assault; tackling him in the snow to make a point, even though she is pregnant. They feel that somehow Lars' behavior reflects their ""neglect"", and so they toil incessantly to drag Lars into the family unit. Lars resists, making promises and then breaking them, making up excuses and lying to friends and family that offer him opportunities to socialize. He only feels ""safe"" within himself, alone, where his active daydreams could endeavor to counter his dark nightmares.One day, perhaps tired of the constant cajoling, Lars announced that he now had a ""girlfriend"" named Bianca, from Brazil, who spoke very little English, and used a wheelchair. Then he brought her in, carrying in his arms a very expensive anatomically-correct helium-filled sex doll, a silicone Sally, and he placed it on the couch next him. He immediately began to talk to her as if she were real, imagining her verbal responses and sharing them. In one of the film's most hilarious scenes, after overcoming the initial shock of this situation, Gus and Karin feel compelled to go along with the ""illusion"", the fantasy; not seeing it as a ruse, which it might have been. After a few days of this pretense, Gus confronted Lars, informing him that Bianca was not ""real"". Lars never wavered, paid no attention to him -gave him no reaction at all. So Gus shrugged and returned to his part in the active fantasy.Through deft direction, artful and clever writing, and terrific acting, we soon witness every character in the story ""accept"" Bianca as a sentient being, interact with her, and fully integrate her presence, and the notion that Lars and Bianca were a couple, into their daily lives, into the daily goings-on within the community. By virtue of this loving gesture, they soon see Lars, for the first time, reaching out and beginning to shed part of his emotional shell. The ""couple"" join in and attend parties, church, volunteer at the hospital, and at the school, get involved with the PTA. Children especially love Bianca. Soon she becomes the town ""sweetheart"", and townsfolk are picking her up for her volunteer work and appointments, like at the beauty shop, by herself. Lars is no longer required to accompany her, and at first this really incensed him. But the largest miracle of this movie is by mid-point we the viewers began to accept Bianca as real. Several times in scenes I swore I saw her head turn slightly, or her eyelashes flicker. When Lars began to realize that he, too, could relate to others without Bianca in attendance, he began to formulate a plan.Patricia Clarkson, always reliable, was solid, engaging, warm, and lonely as Dagmar, the town doctor -who also happened to be a psychologist. ""All doctors have to have a background in psychology to work this far North,"" Karin said early on. Kelli Garner played Margo, a lonely co-worker with ticks and needs of her own, who kept trying to get Lars interested in her, and her performance was touching and effective. Nancy Beatty played Mrs. Gruner, a nice neighbor, who stole every scene she was in as a no-nonsense loving presence. R.D. Reid was also quite good as Reverend Bock, who facilitated the entering in of the fantasy.This film tugged hard at my heart strings. By the roll of the ending credits one could hear sniffling aplenty on all sides. We take serious all the transitions that Lars endures and induces as a 27 year old man boy; issues of when does one become ""grown up"", and what exactly does it mean to ""be a man"". We discovered what it was that created the sadness within him, that shut him off from others -and we smiled and silently cheered as he resisted it, refocused it, pushing it aside as he moved on toward a more meaningful life. Yes, we could see the ""feel good"" ending approaching, but alas we were happy to welcome it.",5,Angel Plasticus,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,6972,"['Director', 'Craig', 'Gillespie', 'New', 'York',

The improbable story was written by Nancy Oliver (the writer of many episodes of the TV series 'Six Feet Under') and directed by Craig Gillespie who gathered a particularly strong cast of actors to present this examination of compassion and love for an emotionally injured young man by  small town  folks, reminding us that caring for each other is still a highly regarded value.Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling) survived a tough childhood only to become a loner terrified of emotional and tactile contact. He lives in the garage of his deceased parents' home while his brother  Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) live in the main house. Despite Karin's pleadings to be part of the family, Lars prefers to keep to himself. At his job his co-workers include Margo (Kelli Garner), who is more than a little attracted to the quiet and strangely distant Lars, and a fellow who finds ' life-size love dolls' on the internet.  Lars orders one of the dolls and when 'Bianca' arrives, Lars finally has a girlfriend to share his loneliness.  He introduces Bianca to Gus and Karin who find the situation strange, but at the same time see the happiness in Lars that has been missing.  They encourage Lars and Bianca to see a doctor Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson) who plays along with the concept that Lars finds Bianca real, and encourages Gus and Karin to be supportive.  As it ends up the entire little town accepts Bianca and she is introduced to doing good deeds and be a vital part of the town, all through the kindness of people who love the 'delusional' Lars and care only for his happiness.  How Lars gradually finds his way into the real world and copes with the understanding of his need for Bianca, the story comes to a tender ending, one that never for a moment feels like a sellout but maintains the dignity of all of the characters in the story.This is a fine and thoughtful exploration of the needs we all have for understanding, compassion, and acceptance, and while there are some very humorous moments in this well-written story, the overall message is one of gentle love.  Ryan Gosling is so fine an actor that he makes this rather complex character understandable and gains our empathy.  The supporting cast is equally excellent - especially Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer and Paul Schneider. Highly recommended viewing, this is a DVD many will want to own for repeated viewings.

It has a rock-solid cast that is superbly directed. Lars lives in a small northeastern town with a close-knit community. His mother died when he was young and his father had issues raising the kids that caused Lars to be very introverted as an adult. Now that their dad is dead, Lars lives in the garage of his parents house while his brother and his expectant wife live in the home.One day at work, a co-worker shows Lars a web site for &#34;Living Dolls&#34;, very realistic, life-sized mannequin-style female dolls, used primarily for sexual desires. A few months later Lars receives a huge package and later he goes to the house and announces a female friend, a former missionary from South America, has arrived and if she could stay overnight in the house. His brother thinks he's gone insane while the more moderate wife wisely goes along with things as Bianca becomes part of the family.They take Bianca to the family doctor who suggests a series of procedures for Bianca as a ploy to get Lars into covert therapy. The Doctor tells his brother and sister in law they need to go along with things and pretend Bianca is a real woman. Pretty soon, the whole town is in to welcoming Bianca to their community.What starts out as a very unlikely situation turns into a very touching and heart-warming story of love and devotion as Bianca literally touches the heart of everyone that meets her.This film should not be missed, nor dismissed due to odd perceptions.",5,A wonderful quirky movie,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,1560,"['Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'one', 'unexpected', 'treats', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'independent', 'films', 'rock-solid', 'cast', 'superbly', 'directed', 'Lars', 'small', 'northeastern', 'town', 'close-knit', 'community', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'father', 'had', 'issues', 'raising', 'kids', 'caused', 'Lars', 'be', 'very', 'introverted', 'adult', 'Now', 'dad', 'dead', 'Lars', 'garage', 'parents', 'house', 'brother', 'expectant', 'wife', 'live', 'home.One', 'day', 'work', 'co-worker', 'web', 'site', '34', 'Living', 'Dolls', '34', 'very', 'realistic', 'life-sized', 'mannequin-style', 'female', 'dolls', 'used', 'primarily', 'sexual', 'desires', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Lars', 'huge', 'package', 'later', 'house', 'female', 'friend', 'former', 'missionary', 'South', 'America', 'arrived', 'could', 'stay', 'overnight', 'house', 'brother', 'gone', 'insane', 'more', 'moderate', 'wife', 'wisely', 'things', 'Bianca', 'part', 'family.They', 'take', 'Bianca', 'family', 'doctor', 'who', 'series', 'procedures', 'Bianca', 'ploy', 'get', 'Lars', 'covert', 'therapy', 'Doctor', 'brother', 'sister', 'law', 'need', 'go', 'along', 'things', 'pretend', 'Bianca', 'real', 'woman', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'whole', 'town', 'welcoming', 'Bianca', 'community.What', 'out', 'very', 'unlikely', 'situation', 'very', 'touching', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'love', 'devotion', 'Bianca', 'literally', 'heart', 'everyone', 'her.This', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'dismissed', 'due', 'odd', 'perceptions']",N/A

I'm not going to watch a piece of trash move like that!"" Or something similar.My wife of all people actually convinced me to give this film a chance. I'm glad I did. Otherwise I would have missed out on one of the most touching and heart warming films I've seen in a long time.Indeed, the premise of the film does not do the message of the film justice. Yes, it's about a guy who buys a sex doll online and falls in love with her. But is so not what you think.Ryan Gosling plays Lars and this might be his best performance yet. He blew me away in Half Nelson, but his talent has never been more obvious as it is here. Lars is obviously a troubled and mysterious young man and Gosling completely sells this character. Never do we doubt that Lars truly is in love with Bianca (the doll) throughout the film. As we discover more about Lars and the source of his problems, Gosling shines even more causing us to have nothing but love and compassion for this deeply troubled character.The real beauty in this story is found in the love that Lars' family and community surrounds him with. Not fully understanding his illness, they all work together to treat Bianca like a real person in order to help Lars deal with the delusions he is fighting against. These are truly the nicest people on the planet, and some might think this is too unrealistic or over the top. However, I will admit that it worked for me and not once did I doubt the sincerity of these completely unselfish people. There are also several funny and slightly uncomfortable moments throughout the film where the townsfolk create various ways to make Bianca one of their own. Even Lars's church family welcomes Bianca in to their midst to show support to this man they love so much.As Lars comes to grips with his struggles we are treated with several soul stirring scenes of a lost character finding hope and redemption. The personal breakthroughs he makes are wonderfully inspiring and will bring tears of joy and laughter. The ending is perfect and brilliant, leaving us with the closure we long for throughout the film.So am I really going to recommend a movie about a guy who falls in love with a sex doll? No way. I'm going to recommend a movie about a deeply troubled soul who finds hope and redemption through the overwhelming love that flows out of the people in his life. Don't be turned off by the off the wall premise or by what you think this move is about. This is truly a wonderful film with a beautiful message.

They eventually begin to accept Bianca as a fellow human being.I won't ruin the story by explaining how all this comes about, but I will tell you this; it is cleverly presented in such a way that the implausible becomes plausible; so much so, that even the most prudish viewer will find it both entertaining and inspiring.",4,Lars and the Real Girl,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1325,"['movie', 'disturbed', 'young', 'man', 'infatuation', 'very', 'expensive', 'life-size', 'anatomically-correct', 'female', 'doll', 'got', 'be', 'primarily', 'directed', 'weird', 'tastes', 'sex', 'fiends', 'perverts', 'other', 'disturbed', 'young', 'men', 'right', 'Wrong', ""'Lars"", 'Real', 'Girl', 'delightful', 'morality', 'tale', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'seventeen', 'years', 'age', 'older', 'story', 'centered', 'life', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'delusional', 'introvert', 'named', 'Lars', 'portrayed', 'convincingly', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'mother', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'was', 'raised', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'father', 'who', 'now', 'late', 'twenties.Lars', 'purchases', 'doll', 'named', 'Bianca', 'detailed', 'personal', 'history', 'then', 'proceeds', 'introduce', 'family', 'town', 'girlfriend.Thoroughly', 'shocked', 'confused', 'first', 'everyone', 'including', 'town', 'resident', 'physician', 'pastor', 'leading', 'citizens', 'gradually', 'follow', 'Lars', 'lead', 'treating', 'doll', 'would', 'real', 'person', 'eventually', 'begin', 'accept', 'Bianca', 'fellow', 'human', 'being.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story', 'explaining', 'how', 'about', 'will', 'tell', 'cleverly', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'implausible', 'becomes', 'plausible', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'even', 'most', 'prudish', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'entertaining', 'inspiring']",N/A
1146163,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B0014D5RBE,Jason Horsley,"[7, 10]","In a hundred years of cinema, there's never been anything quite like Lars and the Real Girl, the new film from director Craig Gillespie and writer Nancy Oliver (Six Feet Under). Lars (Ryan Gosling) is not quite right in the head; he keeps to himself, he can't bear to be touched, and he resists the efforts of his sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer) to draw him out of his self-imposed solitude. Then one day, he asks Karin and his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) if he can bring over a friend. They are delighted, until Lars' friends turns out to be an ""anatomically correct"" silicon love doll named Bianca. Lars informs them that Bianca is Brazilian/Danish, that she's shy and doesn't talk much, and that, being deeply religious, she doesn't feel comfortable sleeping alone with Lars (in the garage where he lives). So Karen and Dave agree to put Bianca up in their place and, convinced Lars has lost his marbles, they suggest that Bianca visit the local G.P, Dr. Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson) for a check-up, hoping to put Lars under observation. After meeting Bianca, Dr. Dagmar suggests that, for the time being, they go along with Lars' fantasy and see what happens. Before long the whole town has agreed to treat Bianca as real: she attends church, has her hair done, and eventually gets accepted on the local school board.Funny as it is, Lars and the Real Girl isn't really a comedy; and although it's an exquisitely tender-hearted film, it's never sentimental (having a silicon sex-doll at its center pretty much makes sure of that). Like Lars himself, the movie doesn't allow itself to be categorized. It's a lovable oddity in a felicitous ""tradition"" of flukes that includes Harold and Maude, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Donnie Darko, and United States of Leland (also with Gosling), movies that by all rights shouldn't work but somehow do. Lars and the Real Girl takes us into unexplored realms of humor and pathos, areas of experience that--outside of real life--probably only these oddball empathic American movies can provide.As played by Gosling, Lars is a prodigy as well as a freak; he's impossible to get a handle on. How much does he believe Bianca is real? We never know for sure. Lars has a sweetness and vulnerability that's both heartbreaking and heartening, but there's a solidness to him too, a determination and directness. He's a survivor, and though he may be delusional, he's not solipsist. He stays true to his delusions, his fantasy world has a life it its own (he fights with Bianca when he feels she is becoming too independent). Before we know it, the plastic Bianca begins to seem real to us, too.In interviews, Gosling has remarked upon the similarity between Lars' peculiar affection for Bianca and the love children feel for stuffed toys (Gosling observes how the love children feel for their toys is genuine even though it is never returned). This similarity is made explicit in the movie when Lars gives mouth-to-mouth to a co-worker's teddy bear (Margo, played by Kelli Garner, in a lovely, soulful performance). Like a child, Lars loves from both sides, and by the end of the movie his weird delusion has come to seem almost enlightened, like saintly, unconditional love. (What could be more selfless than loving someone who can never love us back?)Lars learns how to relate to others by finding the soul in an inanimate object, and by finding his own capacity to love, he discovers his own soul. And the whole town learns by his example. Lars' delusion has the power of vision: it transforms reality into something better than it was before. With its kooky, off-kilter wisdom and its dead-on portrait of small-town Americana (where everyone's a freak on the inside), Lars and the Real Girl is enough to restore your faith in human nature.

Lars maintains a polite yet firm distance from everyone, including his porn-crazed cubemate, Kurt, and the plain-but-perky new girl, Margo.One day, Lars receives a large package in the mail, and is suddenly transformed into a talkative, social butterfly. On the package, a life-sized sex doll Lars calls Bianca.The film is not about Lars and his prurient tastes.

The previews prior to this being released in the theatre portrayed something along the lines of a quirky, artsy, happy yet bizarre love story however watching the film I perceived a slow, twisted, and dull storyline.  Granted I suspended by disbelief of Lars delusional behavior toward ""Bianca"" and accepted his behavior as did his family, friends, co-workers, and neighbors.  Matter of fact I was almost certain Lars was putting on a facade for the entire community yet even if he was doing such an arduous task he still would be classified as delusional.  Unfortunately that storyline didn't materialize once Lars decided to take 'Bianca' to the woods and sing songs to her.  I find it hard to believe not one person in the entire community would call him out and tell him how delusional and pathetic he is for having a doll as a girlfriend.  Where was the antagonist?  It was as if the entire movie was full of protagonists basking in joy for Lar's and his newly found girlfriend.  Nonetheless without the antagonist we are left with a boring and bizarre ending accomplishing absolutely nothing.  The motivation and support from the community doesn't exactly suppress his delusion, if anything it perpetuates it.

People who think every utterance regarding mental illness should be dealt with in a serious vein will probably be offended, if not outraged, by this movie. Likewise, those who have little tolerance for fantasy probably won't like it either.But if you like good movies, it's a charmer.Lars has had a dysfunctional childhood (like who hasn't?) and it plays out leaving him isolated in his community. In search of love, Lars is introduced to the wonderful world of, uhm, sex aids. In this case, a lifelike replica of a woman, whom Lars endows with a background.Instead of rejecting Lars as delusional, his family (brother Gus and his wife Karin), the family doctor, clergyman, workers and soon most of the town embrace their new resident, Bianca, as if she were real. This is the first of the love stories in this movie: a family and town that love Lars to the point of tolerating and humoring his delusion.Lars has an interesting job: he never appears to do any work, but he does have a thing - not a relationship, but a ""thing"" - going with Margo, his co-worker. Margo clearly has her heart set on winning Lars. But Lars is painfully shy - and besides, he is involved with his sex aid, Bianca.Bit by bit, Lars sinks further into his delusion, but at the same time, he becomes less introverted. At last Margo gets Lars to spend some time with him and . . .The conclusion of the film over the last half hour or so is wonderfully warm and not unlike the Capra movies of the 1930s.This is an adorable film.

Knowing that, when I tell you this film's premise you will think I've officially gone off the deep end.Lars is about a man who buys a ""love doll"" online and actually believes that she's a real woman. Got your attention? Good. Because even though that's the one-sentence description of the movie, it doesn't even begin to cover all that this movie is really about.Lars (Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling doing a terrific job) is a nice guy and is extremely shy. He also has severe emotional problems. He finds it physically painful to be touched by others and ignores both their repeated hints that he find a girl and the subtle advances of a gangly coworker (Kelli Garner). Although he works at his anonymous computer job each day and faithfully attends church, no one is aware of just how serious his condition has become in the past few months. His pregnant sister-in-law, Karin (Emily Mortimer, who actually drives the film), has suspicions, however, and since Lars lives in the converted garage behind their house, keeps unsuccessfully inviting him to have dinner with her and his brother, Gus (Paul Schneider). In desperation, she finally tackles him in the driveway one night and insists he eat the salmon she's made. Later, Gus shrugs his brother's quirks off as ""fine.""**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** (Although most is in the trailers)A shipping crate arrives one day while Lars is at work and Karin casually calls Lars at work notify him. Lars speeds home to open it and that evening announces that he has a lady friend he's met online and that he'd like to bring her to dinner that night. Ecstatic that he's not only reaching out to them but has found romance, Karin and Gus spruce the house up and anxiously await the arrival of Lars' friend. Their hopes are dashed, however, when they meet Bianca - a life-sized, fully-articulated, silicone pleasure doll. Lars explains that Bianca can't walk because she is paraplegic and can't speak English because she's a Brazilian missionary. Since Lars and Bianca are devout Christians and they don't want to give the impression of impropriety, he asks Gus and Karin if Bianca can stay in their house while she's in America.Terrified that Lars is psychotic, Karin and Gus devise a ruse to get Lars help. They suggest a routine examination for Bianca by their small town's lone physician - who doubles as psychologist. After interacting with Lars while she ""diagnoses"" Bianca, the doctor (Oscar nominee Patricia Clarkson in a pitch-perfect performance) suggests to the couple that Lars has not had a complete break. He is delusional, however, and there must be some reason why his mind created the delusion to protect him. She recommends strongly that they humor him until she can find out why.

There is a very good reason that movies set in Minnesota, Wisconsin, etc are filled with eccentric characters instead of car chases-- life is actually pretty slow.I didn't openly laugh at any part of this movie, but I did smile and really enjoyed the quirky, *quietly* and *slowly* upbeat, and -- I cringe to use this overused phrase -- heartwarming story. Too many shows run to black comedy or quirky characters but end up grim and too dark. I was very pleased that this film had light and tender sections.I grew up with a mentally handicapped brother with an imaginary friend and alter ego; friends and family played right along and it made everyone feel good. (Also, anyone who grew up in a very small town up north with long winters can attest to the fact that anything out of the ordinary is a blessing!) No, the movie may not be completely realistic in a clinical way to treat mental illness, but I sure wish I lived in a community with people who cared enough about me to try to help like they do in this film. Like many other movies/shows, the viewer has to have watch with a bit of good will, but the characters all rang true. All of the actors are just perfect.And btw, it is NOT a 'blowup' doll -- according to some trivia it apparently cost $6,000 and if you think its face looks slightly different in some scenes you are right, they used several different faces as the movie progresses to subtly change the mood.",5,"NOT ""hilarious""!

1146179,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B0014D5RBE,Kelly Klepfer,"[3, 4]","Watch Lars once to marvel at the storytelling, the acting and the heart of this film. Watch it over and over again to absorb the charm, the quirk and life-altering love. At least that's my plan.I adore films where ordinary and slightly broken people stretch and grow into someone inspiring and beautiful. This is that story, and not just one character inspires, several rise to the opportunity to become better versions of themselves.Lars is damaged. His childhood was a shadow of what it should have been. Instead of love and nurture, he received a grieving husk of a parent. But the adult Lars is okay as a loner. Functional even. Until circumstances invade his tranquility and suddenly he's forced back into some of those dark places, back into grief and fear. But instead of dealing with those issues like most of us do, he comes up with a creative way to reach out to his arm's length friends and family. He invents a soul mate. Unfortunately, she's not invisible like a child might conjure up. ""Bianca"" is bigger than life in most definitions of the word.Lars' quirky support system rallies around, choosing to make his delusion theirs. Bianca, a missionary from Brazil, here to meet Lars, her Internet love, is embraced and becomes a popular citizen. Gosling gives a stellar performance as he runs through the emotional gamut of a stunted man who has tucked life away into a spot where he is not going to be hurt and where he will not find love, the thing he needs the most.The story unfolds as the townspeople reach out to Lars and Bianca while Lars tries to find his way out of his self-imposed prison cell.One warning -- Bianca is a ""doll"" from an adult website and her original purpose isn't to help a young man find emotional healing. There are some sex/anatomy jokes, a little sophomoric humor, and ""build your own girl"" visuals from the website. Surprisingly, the ick factor is low and Lars and his brother are very respectful of Bianca and its obvious that Lars and Biancas' relationship is ""chaste."" But if you are sensitive, keep that in mind.Others may not like the open ending. Several details are not explained. We are given clues to the reason for Lars' brokenness and why he is breaking at this point in his life. The ending is open, too. The pace is also slow. We're talking a character piece and most of those don't have a lot of intense action. I'm drawn to British/Irish films, and Lars feels very much like a Brit film. About a Boy is one of my favorites. I Am Sam is another film that comes to mind because of the complex, and real characters.Bottom line, you won't like this film if you don't want to think. You won't like it if you have to have a lot of fast-moving action. But if you delight in characters and stories of humanity in its messiest and most beautiful moments, you owe it to yourself to check out Lars.

In other hands it could have south to MTV /SNL sketch idiocy quickly, but both the writer and director keep their goals higher than the cheap or smarmy laugh.As old fashioned as the concept is, I felt that ultimately, this was a movie about kindness and how the consistent application of the same can alleviate the crippling effects of loneliness.  This is about a town coming together and helping Lars make his first steps towards happiness even if they don't understand it.  In that respect, it's much in the Frank Capra mode.  Cynics need not check-in!True, there's no big shout-out scene about why Lars is the way he is.  But there doesn't need to be, it's clear that Lars has drawn into himself.  The writer slowly and cleverly lets us into Lars world.  For example, although again, it's never spelled out explicitly, we find out that Lars fears that his pregnant sister-in-law may die in childbirth as his mother did.  We find out that Lars, for all his sweet-natured sadness, is not without his own blinders and faults.  There's a wonderful scene where Lars questions whether anyone cares about him at all and his sister-in-law's furious and hurt reply is exactly what is needed to give him a much-needed kick in the pants. There's another scene where his brother realizes that he'd left a young Lars alone too much with their father who was crippled with grief over his wife's death and what did that do with his emotional development.For all his emotional problems, Lars is fully functional, he holds down a job, but he's emotionally separate.  When at work, Lars notices a new co-worker, we know there is no way that Lars capable of acting on any impulse that requires human interaction.  He rarely speaks unless required.  He never touches, it causes him pain.At first, his new friend Bianca provides unconditional perfect, albeit platonic, love.  She's a companion such as he has never allowed himself to have before, perhaps didn't think himself worthy of before.  But then,  later on, much to everyone's surprise, Lars and Bianca's relationship actually begins to have its difficult moments, as relationships do.  (very funny scenes)  Much to everyone's surprise, Lars deals with it.  The question then becomes one of whether he will be able to transfer those new skills to real people.Deadpan and understated in its humor.  Ryan Gosling is extraordinary, and the rest of the cast is simply perfectly cast.  Yes, it's probably too slow or subtle for some or its initial premise may seem too strange.

Nancy Oliver who was a writer for TV's ""Six Feet Under"" was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and did win a similar award from the National Board of Review for this film.  Craig Gillespie who directed was nominated as ""Most Promising Director"" by the Chicago Film Critics Association.Ryan Gosling stars as Lars.  Gosling previously received an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"" in 2006 and was nominated for a Golden Globe and by critics associations in Chicago and Ohio for this film.  He does an excellent job as the quintessentially shy guy whose call for help comes in the form of a plastic girlfriend.  My favorite scene is where Dr. Dagmar puts his hand on his face, which Lars experiences as pain.  This is a performance-based film; and Gosling is dazzling.Paul Schneider who previously was in ""The Family Stone"" & ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" plays Lars' brother Gus.  Gus is a typical guy.  He is embarrassed by his brother's social backwardness, but tries to be helpful, despite not understanding.Emily Mortimer plays Gus' wife Karin.  Mortimer was in ""Redbelt"" and received Best Supporting Actress nominations from Film Critics Associations in Ohio and Detroit.  She has several excellent scenes like when she tackles Lars from behind and yells at him because he doesn't see how much everyone loves him.Kelli Garner has been in the films ""Thumbsucker,"" ""Man of the House,"" ""Born Killers"" & ""The Aviator.""  Here she plays Margo who works at the same firm as Lars & tries without success to spark a relationship wit him.Patricia Clarkson whose Oscar nomination came in 2003 for ""Pieces of April"" plays Dr. Dagmar, who ""treats"" Bianca, Lars' plastic girlfriend.  When she diagnoses Bianca with low blood pressure, Gosling ad libs that anyone could have it.This is an unusual film that kept my attention engaged.

1146184,A1QTWH8GBEPXR1,B0014D5RBE,"Lily Morgan ""Best regards, Lily""","[0, 0]","Had never really noticed or paid attention to the actor and talents of Ryan Gosling until one evening, lying awake in care of an ailing parent and with premium cable, I watched Lars and the Real Girl.  It is very quirky and filmed with what seems like a cover over the lens of the camera to give it a yellowed page of a book effect... The story is endearing, although getting into it is a little difficult, as it is never quite explained why the character Lars is as he is and does as he does.  But it shows unconditional love of family, community embracing their own for the better of themselves and others, and does so in a funny, albeit occasionally pathetic portrait, of a shy, seemingly unambitious 20-something going through the motions of a life he's not sure how to live.  This isn't a &#34;yuk-yuk&#34; comedy or randomly funny drama... but indeed a dramedy where we of a large imagination, enjoyment of film and differences in techniques and the offbeat storyline that doesn't necessarily trend to be summer box-office fare or ready made for the Oscar performer, performance.  Gosling was so good in his character, I had to see his other work and hey, he's not only pretty darn cute, he's got some acting talent as the character actor, side-kick, and indeed, leading man in a romcom.  His boyish good looks have yet to let me see him actually believable as the brilliant detective/Federal agent type or criminal, mean-spirited sort yet.  Time will help, and I hope to see him in the movies with a long and industriously successful career! This is one of my favorite pictures.  If it helps, I also thought Tracey Ullman and Kevin Kline brilliant in &#34;I Love You to Death,&#34; loosely based upon a true story and having supporting cast of William Hurt, River Phoenix among them.  In addition, I'm a fan of &#34;A Fish Called Wanda.&#34;  These are not your everyday comedies, but to me, hilarious.  But hey, I do shy away from comedies that emphasize &#34;body function humor&#34; like Ace Ventura or any picture with gratuitous sex scenes/nudity tossed in (most Action Adventure films of Stallone, Van Damme, Swartzenegger, etc).

To start this process, Lars orders a realistic looking sex doll whom he introduces to everyone as his living, breathing and eating girlfriend Bianca. Seeing as there&#8217;s no danger to himself or others, his entire community plays along to Bianca being real. Throughout the movie we see how Bianca is used by Lars as a &#8220;crutch&#8221; to overcome his shyness, his fear and pain of human contact, some childhood traumas and the standard growing pains of entering manhood, until he decides that he doesn&#8217;t need Bianca anymore and &#8220;kills&#8221; her off.Despite how odd this film is, I thoroughly enjoyed it! The cast and acting was on par and believable for a small town to &#8220;take care of their own&#8221;. I&#8217;d agree with many other reviewers that this film is definitely not a comedy, though it did make me chuckle and smile quite often. Paul Schnider alongside Ryan Gosling is what really sells this movie IMO. Paul&#8217;s response throughout the movie (from my experience) is realistic which is what really brings out the comedy in this film and makes it feel more natural as well as kind of give the audience a guilt-free pass to their equal reaction to Lars. Gosling&#8217;s performance is natural and endearing; his body language and facial expression make Lars come to life and make you too want to join the community in helping him. Although the topic and effects of mental illness and disorders is not funny and very real, I found myself laughing at the spot on reactions of everyone around Lars. One thing bothered me though, it seemed like almost every woman in this film was immediately understanding and nurturing while practically all of the men wanted to take a go at the sex doll or mocked mental &#8216;defects&#8217; altogether. Perhaps I&#8217;m reading too much into this sexist reaction, but it would have been nice to get a mix of reactions from both sexes (since this film does seem to take place in modern day).

Those of us who've seriously considered buying a Realdoll should not watch this movie, because we will NOT find it the least bit funny.When Lars receives his doll and names her Bianca, his brother Gus (himself not lonely, you notice) immediately decides Lars is crazy, while Gus' wife Karen feels sorry enough for Lars to humor him, and Lars' doctor convinces them to play along with the delusion. In time, Lars' coworkers Margo (who is very proprietary about her teddy bear) and Eric (likewise proprietary about his action figures) seem to be almost as delusional as Lars is with Bianca. Lars briefly plays along with Margo's delusion by acting out his disapproval of Eric's mistreatment of the teddy bear, and Margo evidently finds this attractive. Lars decides Bianca can have no place in this new scheme of things... suffice to say, if Lars had remained indifferent toward Margo after the teddy bear incident, the story would have gone horribly wrong.The only reason why I've chosen to give this movie five stars is because it deals with the plight of America's lonely people in an unabashed, out-of-the-closet way which no film has done before: how would a community react to one man's acceptance of an ersatz woman?

But Lars is a surprising and wonderful film that makes you care as much about the kindhearted characters as Lars cares about factory-made ""Bianca.""Ryan Gosling is Lars, a socially awkward young man for whom human contact is almost painful. (Physical contact, in fact, IS painful.) He's on the verge of becoming a hermit, despite the best efforts of his brother and sister-in-law and the other residents of this small Minnesota, Wisconsin, or Canadian town. Lars is a good person, who attends church regularly, carries packages for elderly people, and forces himself to endure being around other people. He's surrounded by friends and neighbors who fruitlessly try to engage him, but he just becomes more introverted.Until one day, to his family's delight, his new friend ""Bianca"" arrives--from Brazil, someone he met on the internet. Bianca is a lifelike mannequin, and Lars operates under the delusion that she's an actual person with a history and personality of her own. There's nothing sexual about this--he even ensconces her in his in-laws' house because ""she's very religious"" and it would not be proper for her to shack up with Lars this early in their relationship.Instead of having him committed, rejecting him as a kook, or being mean to him, the entire town conspires to play along with this delusion until Lars feels he no longer needs ""Bianca"" and can integrate with the real world.

Zimbardo recently raised the alarm over young men in America ""flaming out,"" losing interest in the opposite sex due to a combination of the instant gratification of video games and porn. ""Lars and the Real Girl"" takes two artifacts of those mediums, role-playing games and porn dolls, and turns them into a shining beacon of hope.Something is not right with Lars (Ryan Gosling). Though he manages a day job in an office cubicle, he lives in a garage apartment with his brother Gus (Paul Schneider) and pregnant sister-in-law Karin (Emily Mortimer), on the property of his deceased father. Lars' mother died in childbirth and it's clear the trauma continues to affect him. He is terrified of intimacy, such that he won't have dinner with his family and flees in terror from the romantic overtures of Margo (Elli Garner).One day Lars announces he's met a girl over the Internet, a Brazilian/Danish wheelchair-bound missionary named Bianca. The catch: Bianca is a RealDoll, a realistic anatomically correct mannequin. Horrified, Gus and Karin go along with the role-play until they can get Lars to see Dr. Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson), the town's doctor and therapist.Dagmar is the world's best doctor, a combination of patience, tolerance, and genuine concern for Lars. She determines that Bianca has low blood pressure and will need special treatments each week. While they wait for the ""treatment"" to take effect on Bianca, Dagmar counsels Lars. Her analysis: Lars submerged himself into role-play to deal with a traumatic event. What that event was and how Lars deals with it is part of the film's charm.Dagmar convinces the small town to go along with Lars' peculiar companion, and it's not long before she appears at weekly mass, at children's hospitals, and even moonlights as a fashion model. Despite the salacious undertones of Bianca's nature, Lars treats her with the utmost respect, insisting they sleep in separate bedrooms. Bianca's personhood becomes legitimized by the community's acceptance, all out of concern for Lars.Meanwhile, Lars can't help but notice that Margo is moving on with her life. When she starts dating, something stirs within him, but Lars is determined to remain faithful to his ""girlfriend."" How Lars resolves the conflict is the denouement of the film.""Lars and the Real Girl,"" like ""Groundhog Day,"" takes a humorous situation and turns it into a parable of acceptance. It's a heartwarming tale about death, rebirth, and life. How do we deal with the ""lost boys"" of today's world? ""Lars and the Real Girl"" answers Zimbardo's question: it's our collective responsibility, not just that of young men alone, to help reintegrate them back into everyday society.",5,'Lars and the Real Girl': Rescuing lost boys one doll at a time,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2700,"['Philip', 'G.', 'Zimbardo', 'recently', 'raised', 'alarm', 'young', 'men', 'America', 'flaming', 'out', 'losing', 'interest', 'opposite', 'sex', 'due', 'combination', 'instant', 'gratification', 'video', 'games', 'porn', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'two', 'artifacts', 'mediums', 'role-playing', 'games', 'porn', 'dolls', 'shining', 'beacon', 'hope.Something', 'not', 'right', 'Lars', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'day', 'job', 'office', 'cubicle', 'garage', 'apartment', 'brother', 'Gus', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'pregnant', 'sister-in-law', 'Karin', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'property', 'deceased', 'father', 'Lars', 'mother', 'died', 'childbirth', 'clear', 'trauma', 'affect', 'terrified', 'intimacy', 'such', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'dinner', 'family', 'flees', 'terror', 'romantic', 'overtures', 'Margo', 'Elli', 'Garner', '.One', 'day', 'Lars', 'met', 'girl', 'Internet', 'Brazilian/Danish', 'wheelchair-bound', 'missionary', 'named', 'Bianca', 'catch', 'Bianca', 'RealDoll', 'realistic', 'anatomically', 'correct', 'mannequin', 'Horrified', 'Gus', 'Karin', 'go', 'along', 'role-play', 'can', 'get', 'Lars', 'see', 'Dr.', 'Dagmar', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'town', 'doctor', 'therapist.Dagmar', 'world', 'best', 'doctor', 'combination', 'patience', 'tolerance', 'genuine', 'concern', 'Lars', 'Bianca', 'low', 'blood', 'pressure', 'will', 'need', 'special', 'treatments', 'week', 'wait', 'treatment', 'take', 'effect', 'Bianca', 'Dagmar', 'Lars', 'analysis', 'Lars', 'submerged', 'role-play', 'deal', 'traumatic', 'event', 'What', 'event', 'was', 'how', 'Lars', 'deals', 'part', 'film', 'charm.Dagmar', 'small', 'town', 'go', 'along', 'Lars', 'peculiar', 'companion', 'not', 'long', 'weekly', 'mass', 'children', 'hospitals', 'even', 'moonlights', 'fashion', 'model', 'salacious', 'undertones', 'Bianca', 'nature', 'Lars', 'utmost', 'respect', 'insisting', 'sleep', 'separate', 'bedrooms', 'Bianca', 'personhood', 'becomes', 'legitimized', 'community', 'acceptance', 'concern', 'Lars.Meanwhile', 'Lars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'Margo', 'moving', 'life', 'When', 'dating', 'something', 'stirs', 'Lars', 'determined', 'remain', 'faithful', 'girlfriend', 'How', 'Lars', 'conflict', 'denouement', 'film', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'humorous', 'situation', 'parable', 'acceptance', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'death', 'rebirth', 'life', 'How', 'do', 'deal', 'lost', 'boys', 'today', 'world', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'Zimbardo', 'question', 'collective', 'responsibility', 'not', 'just', 'young', 'men', 'alone', 'help', 'reintegrate', 'back', 'everyday', 'society']",N/A

Each of these films give some character study and glimpses into unique outsiders lives.  I would imagine the appeal and compassion for these people comes from most of us being able to relate at one time or another to being lonely or feeling like we don't fit in.The film is filled with laughs but I would say it's  more a touching drama then comedy which comes as a total surprise given the material.  Credit should also be given to Ryan Gosling for looking beyond the obvious and bringing a lot of emotion to this role with few words, he is the real deal.The movie is about mental Illness and Gosling's character's delusion of a plastic doll being real but is much more than that.  There are the obvious jokes but even though the doll is anatomically correct it never goes in the perverse direction.  It isn't a love story between Gosling's character and the doll but a story about love, family, communication, and hope.  With the emergence of this doll family and community are able to open up to one another.  Perhaps the absurdity of the situation allows everyone to drop their guards.In a time where machines and the internet replace humans at stores and our main way of getting in touch with one another is through emails and instant messages, a touching movie about communication seems about right.",5,One of 2007s best films.

With the release of the DVD, I decided to check it out and am so glad I did. What a truly beautiful film.While the premise of a man who brings a love-doll into his world as his ""girlfriend"" may indeed sound absurd, it made me think of a child who utilizes the notion of an invisible friend to express their innermost longings. Lars is painfully shy, having been raised by an emotionally distant father who nursed a lifelong heartache, and so any kind of human contact or interaction is absolutely painful to Lars. Ryan Gosling expresses this beautifully. I don't think I've ever seen a performance like it! His pain and loneliness were absolutely palpable and I could feel it through the screen. Truly exceptional.One reviewer remarked on the absurdity of the situation: Why doesn't anyone force Lars to wake up? Well, his brother, Gus, played with easy-going humor and humanity by Paul Schneider, does try to bring Lars back to reality right in the beginning, but Lars doesn't hear him. Instead, he only hears ""Bianca,"" the love-doll who makes human interaction much easier for him.To get Lars help, Gus and his wife (played by the lovely Emily Mortimer) take Bianca to the doctor because they say she looks a little under the weather. The doctor is also a psychiatrist, played with ease and grace by the always amazing Patricia Clarkson (this woman is a lesson in acting - how she just listens and waits and lets information wash over her - she is brilliant). The doctor encourages Lars and Bianca to come in for weekly check-ups while subtly administering to the real issue of Lars' need to emotionally heal.Something I found charming was how everyone in the film plays along with Lars' delusion, even the girl who has a crush on him at work (a charmingly gawky Kelli Garner). Of course, not everyone in this small town is keen to play along at first. There are some folks who naturally balk at this. But everyone slowly begins to accept ""Bianca"" because they care for and are trying to showing their acceptance of Lars.Small towns are an interesting thing unto themselves. Everyone knows everybody else's business, and because they all have a soft spot for the painfully shy Lars, he's like a baby bird everyone hopes will get strong enough to leave the nest. Because of ""Bianca,"" Lars blooms, and the real excitement of the film starts to bubble. As he begins to release his pent-up emotions, he beings to try to make human contact. And the real question emerges: Will Lars be strong enough to meet The Real Girl of his dreams?

Instead, it does an excellent job in sticking with the necessary emotional threads to make an audience relate to the characters.Ryan Gosling goes against typecast as he plays a maladjusted man named Lars in a small, snowy town that is tightly knit. He is one of the anomalies of the town (he cannot take being touched and is super shy and lonely) but accepted. One day he shakes things up by telling people (especially his brother and sister-in-law) that he has met a girl named Bianca and then shows up with a plastic sex doll. He justifies Bianca's lack of mobility by putting her in a wheelchair and telling everybody she is from Brazil.Now the interesting part comes about when a psychologist of the town (played by Patricia Clarkson) tells the brother and sister-in-law to go along with Lar's delusion because it is a healing process dealing with some trauma from his past (the trauma is revealed later in the picture). At first they're resistant but eventually they come around because the rest of the town is immediately on board to support Lars. Bianca isn't just tolerated but accepted into the community as she is sent off to volunteer work and even a part time job as a model mannequin. Yes, there is some tongue in cheek humor here.But what is more interesting is all the various sub characters (especially the brother played by Paul Schneider and no not the older comedian) heal while helping Lars with his problem. So one of the questions you might ask is did the community heal Lars or did Lars heal the community?Notable sub characters to watch in this film: the brother of Lars and the wife of the brother (played by Emily Mortimer, by the way), Margo (the real love interest) and Mrs. Gruener.The truth is that most communities would not go the distance they did for Lars in this picture and that is one of the main reasons for watching this movie.

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[1, 1]","So, from the synopsis description on the DVD box of Craig Gillespie's ""Lars and The Real Girl,"" you may just get some strange looks from your family members if you were the one that selected the movie.  Lars, a movie about a lonely extremely introverted office drone and his love for...well...a blow-up doll he purchases over the internet, might leave those very same family members to ask, ""You feeling OK lately?  Anything you want to get off your chest?""  Just like the not so real girl, things are not always what they may seem to appear.  What this movie is really about is people, family, community, and the lengths people will sometimes go to to help those in trouble out.  It ends up being hopeful and optimistic without delving into sentimental and corny territory.  Lars' new found love ends up being about a person taking an odd approach to gaining their life back.  It's a highly recommended view.Ryan Gosling (Lars) plays a great role and much to my surprise when I mentioned this movie to a few of my office-mates of the female persuasion, Gosling is actually a heart-throb to the lady crowd.  Who would have thunk it?  Gosling plays a wonderfully nuanced performance as a Northern Clime lost soul searching for his way through to human connection.Other good acting roles are turned in by Paul Schneider as Gus, Lars' brother, and Emily Mortimer, Gus' wife.  The characters both choose to endure embarrasment by pretending that Lar's new found doll of a girl is real resulting in leading the entire town's denizens to play along, even the village pastor and church elders.Why did I like this movie so much you may very well ask yourself?  Why should you watch it?  Well, it's entertaining for one.  And moreso, it ends up being a story about you and I, or at least folks we know.  So not everyone in real-life creates imaginary friends like Lars mind you (unless you are 4 or 5 of course) and comes off faring so well as Lars.  But the movie speaks of being alientated from others in a modern world of office cubicles, communication through technology and how people come up with non-conventional means to fight through all that dislocation and alienation back to human connection.Don't be put-off by the plot line of this indie-feel flick.

The thread of the plot is somewhat similar.  The plot may not be as believable.  For my taste, there wasn't enough naysaying in the movie among the townfolk.  They latched onto it too quickly, and the idea of one person pointing out everyone else's faults to get them to accept the idea is a little cliched, and it didn't work for me on a certain level.  All of that changed during the culmination moment.  The culmination moment, or arc, of the story is when the Lars character decides that Bianca has died.  To this point in the story, we are the brother Gus.  Gus was the lone naysayer in the movie that asked for sanity in the situation. (He did buy into it a little too quickly, but I give the writer a pass due to time constraints.) Gus was the guy that informed the doctor that he wouldn't be able to abide by her wishes of humoring his brother.  After Lars decides that Bianca is dying, we see Gus following the stretcher into the emergency room.  He cares what happens.  All rationale is gone as the concern for his brother, the confusion regarding the change in his brother, and the confusion of concern for a porn doll are all wrapped up in an expedient step into an emergency room.  He even weeps a little at the funeral and explains it away by saying he always gets this way at funerals. The brother was the one that closed the deal for me in this movie.

1146221,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B0014D5RBE,ocarolan,"[17, 47]","Are there two movies in circulation titled Lars and the Real Girl--one a touching, laugh-how-loud comedy; the other an absurd and bizarre bore; a Disney version of The Twilight Zone? Judging from the reviews, there must be. I saw the latter.The focus of the film is Lars Lindstrom, a shy, socially-challenged young man living on a farm near a small town in what I assume is the Upper Midwest--perhaps in Wisconsin, judging from the comment of Lars's brother that his bowling team had lost to the cheese inspectors, The farm is the Lindstrom family farm, inherited by Lars and his brother. Lars's brother lives in the house with his wife, while Lars occupies the adjacent garage. Lars works in town, and although it is supposed to be a small town, Lars's work setting is similar to many city businesses, with Lars and his coworkers occupying cubicles outfitted with desk and computer. Lars wants a girlfriend but is too shy and socially inept to get one the old-fashioned way. So he purchases a mail-order, life-size, anatomically-correct mannequin, whom he names Bianca. There is a reason these mannequins are anatomically correct, and it is not so they will pass muster as a real passenger in your vehicle when you use high-occupancy lanes. No, they are anatomically correct so that they can be used as a sex partner, a use to which the people of the community in which Lars lives appear to be oblivious.Most guys in Lars's position would do everything in their power to keep Bianca's existence a secret. But not Lars: Lars is in love, and he wants the world to know. The weirdness begins one evening when Lars takes Bianca to meet his brother and sister-in-law. Lars wheels Bianca into their home in a wheelchair, which explains why she cannot walk, and he has other excuses for Bianca's inability to do the things that humans do. It is obvious to Lars's brother and to his wife that Bianca is a mannequin, but as it becomes increasingly apparent that Lars is dead serious in his treating Bianca as a living being, they refrain from confronting Lars and his delusion, and they play along with it. They decide to seek professional advice, and so they arrange for Lars and Bianca to visit their doctor on the pretense that Bianca does not look well.It's not clear what specialty their doctor, Dagmar (Patricia Clarkson), pursues. If Dr. Dagmar specialized in family practice, I would have expected her to have relatively little expertise in psychiatry and promptly to have referred Lars to someone who did--maybe send him down to Madison to The Ed Gein Institute for the Seriously Weird. If Dr. Dagmar is a psychiatrist, how, I wondered, would such a small community support her practice?  By the end of the film, it was apparent that this community is fertile ground for a psychiatrist. Whatever her specialty, Dr. Dagmar is not about to refer this case. Bianca, she informs Lars's brother and wife, has come into Lars's life for a reason, and everyone who loves Lars is going to have to help him work through it, which means indulging his delusion. Fortunately for Lars, everyone loves him.The scene in Dr. Dagmar's office is a pivotal one, as how it plays out determines the direction the story takes. In retrospect, a number of possibilities come to mind that could have saved this film.  For example, as the meeting in Dr. Dagmar's office ended, the camera could have panned to a corner of the room where a Rod Serlingesque character said to the audience: ""Lars Lindstrom has a problem. He is in love with an anatomically-correct sex mannequin. In some communities this would make Lars the butt of jokes; an object of derision; or land him in a padded cell. But this is no ordinary community. This community is in... The Twilight Zone."" Or the film could have headed into Dennis Potter territory by having the scene evolve into a musical number in which Lars, holding Bianca's hand, lip-syncs Patsy Cline's Crazy. Instead, we get absurdity after absurdity, all played straight, and with a PG rating in mind.As Lars takes Bianca out in public and the people of the community learn of her and of Lars's problem, everyone, and I mean everyone, signs on to do his or her part to see that Lars's delusion is not threatened by reality. Soon the townspeople are inviting Bianca to social functions. Lars takes her to church and out for a night of bowling with his friends. You'd think there might be some unpleasant encounters, maybe a redneck-type at the bowling alley sipping from a bottle of PBR and taunting: ""Hey, Lars, yer girl friend's a real doll. Har! Har!""  But none of that happens. Everyone in town is really nice, really understanding, and really cool with Lars and Bianca as a couple. I guess that's because people in small towns are so tolerant, especially of something as innocent as one of the local boys dragging an anatomically-correct mannequin with him wherever he goes and insisting it's a real person. And especially when that boy is universally loved. Why does the community have so much affection for Lars? I haven't a clue.Early-on in the film we meet one of Lars's coworkers, a cute, perky young lady who obviously has eyes for Lars. One need not be particularly insightful to figure out that by the film's end she will be Lars's real girl. But for that to happen (assuming this young lady draws the line at a m&eacute;nage &agrave; mannequin), Bianca will have to be removed from the picture. And the only one who can effect that without threatening Lars's delusion is Lars himself. And so Bianca becomes ill, or so Lars claims, and her decline and death lead to some seriously absurd scenes. In one, Bianca is rushed to the hospital by paramedics.  We see her being rolled down the corridor of the hospital on a gurney accompanied by Lars, Dr. Dagmar, and two paramedics, all looking concerned (perhaps for their acting careers). Here's an experiment that you should try. Pickup the phone, dial 911, and report that a member of your family is seriously ill and needs transport to the hospital. When the paramedics arrive, show them an anatomically-correct mannequin and say ""here she is; she's really ill. Help her."" I recommend not doing this without having an attorney on retainer. Bianca's death leads to the final absurdities: a funeral and burial. In his eulogy, the pastor tells a church filled with mourners, ""Bianca taught us all something."" No one snickers or rolls his eyes. Apparently, everyone in this community becomes delusional during the long, hard winters of the Upper Midwest.This film did not work for me as comedy or as a fairytale or fantasy. The supporting cast is competent but Ryan Gosling, as Lars, leaves a lot to be desired. In fairness to Mr. Gosling, the role of Lars is one that only Andy Kaufman could have pulled off.",1,Disney meets The Twilight Zone,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,6776,"['Are', 'there', 'two',

So when I finally saw it I was amazed at how beautiful it was.  The story is improbable but the film tells it in a way that makes it totally believable.  First rate performances by all the actors help a lot.  Ryan Gosling is wonderful and I loved his office-mate girl-friend a lot too.I laughed out loud at the scene where Lars introduces his new doll, ""Bianca"" to his brother and sister-in-law.  And I wept at Bianca's funeral. I never thought I'd cry at a funeral for a doll, but again this was done so beautifully that I couldn't help it. The minister's eulogy for Bianca almost made her seem real.The most important element in this story is the extraordinary love that the community gives Lars.  From his ultra-sweet sister-in-law to the incredibly wise doctor...this was just the most heart-warming aspect of the film.  I worked in a mental hospital one summer while in college and picked up a publication for the staff there.  On the cover was a quote from Karl Meninger that said ""Love is the Touchstone.""

The very short of it: Lars is a ""loner"", who orders a Real Doll and instead of using her for what she's intended, begins acting as though she's his real girlfriend. Those around him refer to mental illness as the cause, but are told by the town doctor to ""go with it"", instead of putting him in a mental hospital. Although the premise of the movie made me think that it might be sad in a way, there was much humor in it. The brother's wife was very funny in her interactions with Bianca, and the scene where Lars takes Bianca out in the woods is hilarious.Ryan Gosling is amazing in this movie. His co-star is literally a hunk of plastic and he honestly made her seem like much more than that, she became Bianca-the girlfriend, not just Bianca-the Real Doll. Ryan Gosling reminds me a lot of my favorite actor, Gary Oldman. They don't necessarily do the same type of movies, but they really BECOME the characters they play, and they can do almost any type of role and own it.Anyways, this is a great movie.

""Avid Amazon Fan and Kindle User""","[2, 2]","When I first heard the premise of this movie, I thought it to be absurd - especially the shocking idea of a sex doll being a co-star of the movie. However, despite the doll's illicit beginnings, this movie is chaste to the core.Lars and the Real Girl is a story of a man who wants to be a man but has too many issues to deal with. Showing and receiving affection is extremely hard for him and actually causes him pain. And despite all those around him who genuinely care for him, his brother and sister-in-law included, their displays of affection for him only cause him to retreat further into himself - and they don't see it.So what does Lars do? He creates himself a girlfriend by ordering a custom made sex doll and calls her Bianca. She's from Brazil and uses a wheel chair. Bianca becomes the object of Lars affection - all very chaste - but funny and absurd when you first see it. This is how Lars copes with his inadequacies and protects himself.Bianca causes quite the stir, of course, and while the community first are shocked by this, they come together and play along with Lars' delusion out of their love for him. Even Margo, the real girl who truly likes Lars gracefully participates in the delusion out of respect and fondness for him.Before long, the whole community embraces Bianca as one of her own. She gets a makeover and she volunteers at different organizations. And as Bianca is off gallivanting with the community, Lars begins to culminate a relationship and cope with his feelings for Margo. Eventually, this begins the heartbreaking rift with his delusion with Bianca...one that ripples through the family and community as well. You can't help but cheer on Lars as he struggles to emerge from his delusion and begin his real life romance with the real girl.There's so much to this movie it's hard to categorize. It is a comedy, it is a romance, it is a tragedy (of sorts) and a triumph, it's a feel-good movie. Each and every actor in this movie played their roles extremely well - even Bianca, who isn't even alive, was a perfect cast. Kudos!This movie makes one wish to live in such a small town where everyone knows your name, your quirks, and still loves you all the same. Does such a place exist?Finally, I want to know where I can get (or make) that adorable knit cap that Bianca wore.

Advertised as a comedy, I was not in rush to see a movie about a midwestern guy in love with a doll.  But then I got the courage and I just LOVED this movie from start to finish.  It is emotionally packed story about a young man who suddenly in the most unexpected way tries to resolve his deep emotional issues.  There were moments in the film that were funny, but the story is really about one man's subconscious mind trying to heal itself after decades of suppression.  What was very moving is that in this small town with very traditional people he finds the best support system ever to work out his issues.  And the way that the story unravels is just one reason more for anyone to really see and enjoy this movie.  The entire cast on this film was fantastic.

While Gus managed to overcome their mother's death, Lars never could.When a co-worker shows Lars an Internet ad for ""Love Dolls"", Lars rescues ""Bianca"" and brings her home.

1146238,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0014D5RBE,RMurray847,"[9, 16]","A few years ago, a major reviewer deeply criticized the movie O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?...primarily because he felt that the movie was mostly a condescending insult to the culture of the deep South...that it made fun of the people it was depicting. The reviewer had similar troubles with the Coen Brothers depiction of the residents of small towns in Minnesota in FARGO.I had no such qualms. However, after having seen LARS AND THE REAL GIRL, I now understand how the critic felt.Here we have a movie set in a small town somewhere up north (the movie was filmed in Canada). Lars is a young man, living in the converted detached garage of his brother and sister-in-law. He's a deeply quiet, shy and clearly troubled young man. He has a terrible moustache but clearly a gentle nature. He doesn't date, and can barely bring himself to socialize. At work, he interacts with his co-workers as little as possible. In fact, there isn't too much that is initially likeable about him.One day a large box arrives for Lars, and hours later, he shows up at his brother's house, asking if he can bring his new girlfriend to dinner. His family is delighted, and are ready to eagerly greet the young lady. Lars then wheels in his wheelchair-bound sweetie, Bianca. There is one small additional problem...Bianca is a ""sex doll."" Although, thankfully, her mouth isn't in the shape of an ""o""...she IS anatomically correct. Lars' shocked family doesn't quite know how to react, but they sure know Lars is not in his right mind.Caring deeply for their family member, they are able to trick Lars into attending a kind of therapy with a sympathetic doctor (Patricia Clarkson)...who decides that everyone must simply play along with Lars' delusion, and in fact, make Bianca feel at home.This is where much of the film lost me. I understand the whimsical idea that this little town full of simple, trusting folks go out of their way to pretend Bianca is real. Heck, they start inviting her to clubs and other events. She attends church. And the townspeople beam at the young couple happily. Lars begins to emerge from his shell a little bit, only to reveal himself to be a jealous boyfriend, prone to anger and to clinging. But what the scenes also do is make the townspeople look like idiots and buffoons.I get it: they are kind, compassionate, open-minded and happy to take care of one of their own who is troubled. I don't have a problem with that notion. But the execution of the film just made me look at all these people and wonder...don't any of them have a bone of irony? Don't any of them ever snigger behind their hands or gossip when Lars isn't around? Won't any one of them say ""Give me a break...she's a flippin' doll!!"" This blind adherence to the quest to go along with whatever delusion Lars wants to enjoy makes the film languish with the same tone for a good, long chunk of time.The best parts of the film are the brother and sister-in-law. Paul Schneider (SO good in ALL THE REAL GIRLS) is the confused, loving brother. He, more than anyone, understands the heartache and loss that has molded Lars to be the way he is. He feels the guilt of not having shielded his younger brother. It's a lovely depiction of the complicated, exasperated love a man can have for his brother. As the kindly and radiantly pregnant sister-in-law, Emily Mortimer shines. Their scenes together and with Lars are the real emotional heart of the film, and are the main reason to see it.Ryan Gosling is a VERY talented actor, capable of a WIDE range. However, his Lars...to me, at least...is an easy series of ticks and goofy smiles. No doubt Gosling has internalized his character...but the script gives him nothing more to do than be a slightly goofy young man with some deep delusions. I wanted to like the performance more...but I felt I'd pretty much seen all there was to see of Lars in the first 15 minutes.The movie builds to a conclusion many will find satisfying...but it actually left me questioning just what Lars did near the end. If his delusion was real to him...then his actions are far from harmless.Anyway, this is a quaint movie that thinks it is saying a lot more than it is. To me, it mostly said, ""hey, if you happen to be insane and delusional...pray you live in a small town where they don't know any better than to smile at you and play along."" I know many will disagree with my take...and I admit it comes from a very visceral level...but hey, sometimes a movie just strikes you wrong.But don't let me steer you clear. There are two really nice performances...and for many, the movie is a sweet, satisfying story.

1146240,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0014D5RBE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","Lars Lindstrom is a 27-year-old bachelor who has become such a loner of late that even his brother and sister-in-law have trouble getting him to come over for dinner.  Everyone seems to like Lars but no one seems to know how to break through the emotional barrier he's built up between himself and the world around him.  Karin, his sister-in-law, has become especially concerned about the eccentric behavior he has been exhibiting lately, but even she is unprepared for how far Lars is about to go in making people question his very sanity.The jolt comes when Lars, in his loneliness, decides to order up a life-sized, anatomically correct ""love doll"" off the internet (not for purposes of sex, mind you, but for love and companionship).  Soon he is bringing her to family get-togethers and social functions, thoroughly convinced that ""Bianca"" is a real live human being - and fully expecting everyone else around him to think so as well.  The local doctor suspects that Lars may be suffering from some sort of a ""delusion"" and that the best treatment would be for everyone, at least for the moment, to just play along with the fantasy.  Thus, all the astonishingly cooperative residents of this small Canadian town become participants in what must surely be the most impressive case of ""mass therapy"" in the history of psychoanalysis.""Lars and the Real Girl"" is clearly intended to be a fey fantasy on the order of, say, ""Don Juan de Marco"" or ""The Madness of King George,"" so questioning the credibility and logic of much of  what takes place would be counterproductive to the filmmakers' point and purpose.  Indeed, the viewer should know going into the movie that he will be called upon to leave at least a portion of his skepticism at the door if he is to have any hope at all of entering fully into the spirit of the enterprise.  For the most part, I was able to set aside most of my more rational objections and to see the movie for the wry, offbeat parable that it is clearly intended to be.  Like Don Quixote - Lars' Dulcinea may not be a flesh-and-blood person, but she`s every bit as illusory as the Don`s ideal woman - this young man is obviously struggling with some pretty serious developmental issues and using fantasy as a means of shielding himself from the harsh realities of everyday life.  Writer Nancy Oliver and director Craig Gillespie don't provide clear-cut explanations for Lars' alienation, though there are hints that feelings of abandonment as a child may have played a significant role in it.  The point is that Lars, like so many others who are unprepared for the responsibilities of life and love, clearly needs time to work through his struggles, and he seems to be using his relationship with Bianca as the means of doing just that.This sort of delicately wry fable stands or falls on the conviction that each individual on both sides of the camera brings to the project.  One false move or jarring note on the part of any of the actors and the entire enterprise could come crashing down around them.  Luckily, the moviemakers are blessed with having the wonderful Ryan Gosling in the lead role.  This amazingly versatile and talented actor brings such a self-effacing sweetness and vulnerability to the role of Lars that even the most cynical among us can see why the townsfolk work so hard at buttressing his fantasy.  He gets beautiful support from Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider, Kelli Garner and Patricia Clarkson as the individuals whose unqualified backing helps him through his crisis.  Moreover, the subdued tone, hypnotic pacing, and stark wintry backgrounds help to keep the fantasy grounded enough in reality to make us actually believe it could be happening.Given the material, ""Lars and the Real Girl"" could easily have become one long extended dirty joke or a one-note comical gimmick that failed to grow and develop much past the novelty stage.

It sounded kinda hokey....about a guy who was dating a doll--and I mean a REAL doll.  But then positive word-of-mouth got around so I decided to see it after all.  I'm glad I did because I would have to say it's one of the year's best films.  To me, not only was it about loneliness, but it was also about how an inanimate object can teach someone how to open up emotionally and interract in our society.  This type of behavior should not be a surprise in modern times.  I see it everywhere.  Isn't it always easier to express and show our love for someone who doesn't talk back and cause us grief?  Isn' that why a lot of lonely people have pets?  As far as I'm concerned, Lars was behaving no differently than a dog owner.  He had a lot of loving and caring to give to a woman but was afraid and probably didn't know how to do it.  So he chose a doll called Bianca.  Unfortunately, it's a sad reflection of our society on how disconnected we have become in this industrialized and computerized society.  But enough with all this philosophical mumbo jumbo.  LARS AND THE REAL GIRL was also REALLY funny.  The performances were terrific--especially Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer and Paul Schneider.  Not to sound condescending but LARS AND THE REAL GIRL seemed more like a foreign film--albeit a French film--than an American movie.  You just don't see many films about ordinary people and their relationships with other people in a real and intimate way.  Most American movies seem to contain either violence (e.g., NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THERE WILL BE BLOOD, THE DEPARTED, etc.) or sex (do I really have to list them?).  I would put LARS AND THE REAL GIRL right up there with WAITRESS, DAN IN REAL LIFE, and THE SAVAGES as some of the best films of the year.

There's that volleyball, Wilson.  Hank's relationship with Wilson is real, emotional, and critical.  When Wilson is lost in the ocean, the effect on Hanks' character is extreme.In Lars and the Real Girl, Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling), a very quiet and reserved man in his 30s, lives in the garage of his boyhood home.  His brother, Gus (Paul Schneider), and expectant sister-in-law, Karin (Emily Mortimer), live in the main house.  Lars seems happy with this arrangement, and refuses to mix with his brother's family or his coworkers.One day, he knocks on his brother's door, and confesses that he has a lady guest.  She's part Brazilian and Danish, is in a wheelchair, and lost her luggage.  Could she please spend the night in the pink bedroom?  Her name is Bianca.  ""Certainly!"" said Gus and Karin, thrilled that Lars has a friend.Lars brings Bianca over.  To Gus and Karin's astonishment and embarrassment, ""Bianca"" is a silicon, life-size, anatomically correct, sex doll.  ""My bother is insane!"" Gus whispers to Karin.The comedy in this creative film is on the town interacting with Bianca.  The drama in this film is in Lars, his family, his coworkers, his church, and the rest of the town interacting with Bianca.  A courageous and creative physician works with... Bianca... to get a better understanding of what is going on in Lars' mind.  His delusion of Bianca's reality has a real cause, and certainly has real effects.  And when his relationship with Bianca begins to affect his relationship with a very kind coworker, Margo, the viewer starts to squirm.You so desperately want there to be a happy ending!One of the things that makes this film work is the intentional lack of slapstick comedy.

Traumas from his childhood have given Lars a fear of intimacy that's so strong that he can't even be touched by other people without feeling pain.  A delusional relationship helps him to find his way through his issues, but this film is more about the community that cares and shows him the love and acceptance he needs.  Wow--what would life be like if all communities showed love and support rather than making fun of people and judging them harshly?  That's a question to which this film gives us a hint of an answer, as we watch the whole community grow stronger as they help Lars deal with life.  I kept waiting for the obligatory jerks who were going to mock him and do something awful to him or Bianca, but the filmmakers never sank to that level to keep the narrative flowing.

The theater is generally selective about which movies it shows and I usually like the movies I see there. I actually was able to get the dvd from the library. I am so glad I didn't see the movie in the theater!As other reviewers who agree that this is simply an abominable movie have stated, it is amazing how many people thought that this movie was so great. I really resonated with a reviewer at amazon who said that while reading the large number of very glowing reviews, he thought that he must be from another planet.""Lars and the Real Girl"" is insipid, trite nonsense. It takes a totally unrealistic view of the subject of delusional people, and then gets much worse because the other premises born out in the very poor script are at least as bad as the original premise. I have a lot of experience with mental illness in my family, and I have visited many mental institutions. To believe that a person who is as delusional as Lars would behave as well as he did, to believe that he could hold a job and basically function, is just ridiculous. Delusional people often create painful, even unbearable incidents with people in their family and in other circumstances, and they often have absolutely no conscience about what they are doing, which is one of the reasons why there are often years and years of such incidents, and also one of the reasons why they are institutionalized. There is no way a person who is so delusional could as if ""compartmentalize"" the illness, channel it, solely into an imaginary mannequin girlfriend.The GP doctor, who is ""coincidentally"" also a psychologist, is also pure bunk, totally unrealistic, and the dialogues between her and Lars are silly and often pathetic. For example, to imply that people are crazy because of the crazy world we live in, and to imply that the basic problems that just about everyone has, are somehow the same as someone who is very sick, is way off the mark, in my opinion and experience. You can be sure that a person who has dealt with mentally ill people might question his/her own sanity, but that in no way means that questioning one's sanity is the same as being very delusional. I must confess, I fast forwarded after the first few of these weird conversations, so please excuse if I don't have a more informed critique of what was actually said, but this is what I got from the doctor-patient scenes that I did watch.Need I go on? The people in the small town going along with the delusional charade of the mannequin girlfriend is not believable and badly done as well, and I know that it doesn't work that way at all in ""real"" life. The funeral after the girlfriend ""dies"" is a joke. But her ""death"" does clear the way for Lars's to go out with the always available pretty girl, whose character is another gross oversimplification of ""real"" life, and is yet another example of how absurd this movie is.",2,"Very awful movie (2 stars because it was at least ""pleasant"")",1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,2938,"['saw', 'movie', 'playing', 'theater', 'town', 'live', 'theater', 'generally', 'selective', 'movies', 'usually', 'movies', 'see', 'there', 'actually', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'dvd', 'library', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'agree', 'simply', 'abominable', 'movie', 'have', 'stated', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'really', 'resonated', 'reviewer', 'amazon', 'who', 'said', 'reading', 'large', 'number', 'very', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'thought', 'must', 'be', 'planet', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'insipid', 'trite', 'nonsense', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'view', 'subject', 'delusional', 'people', 'then', 'much', 'worse', 'other', 'premises', 'born', 'out', 'very', 'poor', 'script', 'are', 'least', 'as', 'bad', 'original', 'premise', 'have', 'lot', 'experience', 'mental', 'illness', 'family', 'have', 'visited', 'many', 'mental', 'institutions', 'believe', 'person', 'who', 'as', 'delusional', 'Lars', 'would', 'behave', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'believe', 'could', 'hold', 'job', 'basically', 'function', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Delusional', 'people', 'often', 'create', 'painful', 'even', 'unbearable', 'incidents', 'people', 'family', 'other', 'circumstances', 'often', 'have', 'absolutely', 'conscience', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'are', 'often', 'years', 'years', 'such', 'incidents', 'also', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'are', 'institutionalized', 'way', 'person', 'who', 'so', 'delusional', 'could', 'compartmentalize', 'illness', 'channel', 'solely', 'imaginary', 'mannequin', 'girlfriend.The', 'GP', 'doctor', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'also', 'psychologist', 'also', 'pure', 'bunk', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'dialogues', 'Lars', 'are', 'silly', 'often', 'pathetic', 'example', 'imply', 'people', 'are', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'world', 'live', 'imply', 'basic', 'problems', 'just', 'everyone', 'are', 'somehow', 'same', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'sick', 'way', 'mark', 'opinion', 'experience', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'person', 'who', 'dealt', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'might', 'question', 'his/her', 'own', 'sanity', 'way', 'questioning', 'one', 'sanity', 'same', 'being', 'very', 'delusional', 'must', 'confess', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'first', 'few', 'weird', 'conversations', 'please', 'excuse', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'informed', 'critique', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'said', 'what', 'got', 'doctor-patient', 'scenes', 'did', 'watch.Need', 'go', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'going', 'delusional', 'charade', 'mannequin', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'believable', 'badly', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'know', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'funeral', 'girlfriend', 'dies', 'joke', 'death', 'clear', 'way', 'Lars', 'go', 'out', 'always', 'available', 'pretty', 'girl', 'character', 'gross', 'oversimplification', 'real', 'life', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'absurd', 'movie']",N/A

I must admit I wasn't expecting much, and certainly not a gem of a movie.  But out of that strange and simple premise grows a film that is sweet, touching, romantic, and will stay with you for a long time.  If you are willing to suspend your initial disbelief, you will find this movie oddly moving.  It reminded me a bit of the 1950 classic ""Harvey,"" with a sex doll in place of Jimmy Stewart's giant, invisible rabbit friend.  As in that movie, when people put aside their initial judgments and confusion, they begin to discover something about themselves.  Both Harvey and Bianca function as mirrors for the people who ""see"" them. This movie offers reflections on the nature and necessity of community and the meaning that can be found if we are willing to act out of true compassion and not just out of cultural or normative habits.  This film also offers a positive portrayal of organized religion and people trying to live out their faith in real ways, something you don't find in a lot of Hollywood films.  There is wisdom in this film, but it is presented in such an understated and subtle way (again not something I was expected based on the premise) that it really builds AFTER you have seen the film and begin to think more about it.  I highly recommend this film - it is not what you think!

1146252,A359IT81FBX64Y,B0014D5RBE,Steven Mason,"[0, 0]","I lost count of the number of reviewers who say this movie is quirky, weird, funny, likeable and heartwarming. It's all of those things, but I want to try to dig beneath the surface a little, and there will be spoilers.First, this movie is the best advertisement that the RealDolls company could have dreamed of, though Lars (Ryan Gosling) is certainly not a typical customer for such an expensive and lifelike doll. Lars is delusional and imagines that Bianca (the doll) is his real-life girlfriend. Lars is an extremely sensitive soul and seems to suffer from extreme social anxieties, but apparently he has no history of delusions. The story takes place in a small, rather remote town, and the doctor, a widow named Dagmar who also happens to be a psychologist, announces that Lars' delusion is not the result of mental illness, but merely a manifestation of unresolved issues. Her prescription is to ask the entire town to play along with Lars, treating Bianca as a real person.All of this is implausible enough and I don't have to explain why. It's enjoyable to go along for the ride. But from this premise, a moral to the story emerges, and this is it: Love and acceptance can comfort and heal. There is no hate in this town. Even the people who are pious do not judge or hate. Even the redneck boys do not mock or bully. From the old ones down to the youngest children, there is only love and acceptance. Sometimes there is a little teasing and hurt feelings, but the worst of it is milder than anything you'd find in a modern Kindergarten class. Seeing such a bucolic town, I couldn't help but wonder what a man like Harold Hill (The Music Man) would do if he came upon it.Okay, so if the moral is ""All You Need Is Love,"" what then? Watching this movie, you will be steeped in love. I'm no psychologist, but in some ways I think Lars behaves a bit like someone with autism, and the doll serves as a safe proxy for real people. With Bianca as an emotional crutch, Lars slowly learns how to interact with people, starting with his own family. The movie indulges in a lot of conveniences; for example, even with all his extreme anxieties and delusions, Lars is very easy for normal people to deal with. He's perfectly capable of understanding what people say to him, of taking care of himself, and of working at some kind of full-time computer-type job. I doubt that this is the case for most people who suffer from extreme anxieties and delusions. Making Lars sweet, likeable and independent makes it very easy to like him and enjoy the movie, but it strikes me as a bit too convenient and pleasant. It's simply not this easy and amusing to deal with people who suffer from serious mental illness, so, at best, the moral of ""All You Need Is Love"" is superficial and cloying.The story suffers from a couple of its own delusions. First, there is a beautiful gal, Margo (Kelli Garner) who is hopelessly in love with Lars, even as he loves Bianca. We never get to know anything substantial about Margo, though there are hints that she suffers from some emotional issues as well. In fact, there are more than a few characters who seem to suffer from emotional issues, which is strange considering that hate and cruelty are absent from this town. The makeup artists try hard to make Margo look plain, but they're not fooling anyone. As far as I could tell, Margo feels attracted to Lars because she is an extremely sensitive soul, too. But unlike Lars, she is ""strong"" enough to admit that she feels lonely and to try and do something about it, whereas Lars was in full retreat, at least until he met Bianca. Margo is trying to get from Lars what Lars is getting from Bianca, and by movie's end there's every indication that Lars and Margo will end up together. The other delusion is the notion that the ""normal"" people of this town are touched in some profound way by Bianca. They proceed to engage with Bianca well beyond what is required for indulging Lars' delusions, including Bianca ""reading"" stories to kids in the public schools (without Lars being present). Absolutely no explanation is offered for this. I have to wonder if there is perhaps a significant amount of lead or mercury in the drinking water of this town.I wouldn't suggest that anyone should skip this movie, especially if you enjoy quirky movies.

1146260,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B0014D5RBE,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[10, 27]","Just so we are all on the same page, let me understand this correctly. A delusional office worker decides one day that it is time for him to find love and decides that rather than court a pleasant lass he instead chooses to order an ""adult"" doll as his lover and companion. Then the townspeople learn to embrace said doll as an almost real entity based solely on the delusional conversations and fictitious life that said office worker has crafted for his new lady. And you want me to believe that this is the foundation of a good movie?Certainly there has been a lot of hype about the movie Lars and The Real Girl; however, I for one cannot see what all the fuss is about. The movie is a rather boring take upon the traditional love story gone awry thanks in part to the delusional fantasy of a character that too often reminds me of Napoleon Dyanmite's half-brother.Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gossling) is your everyday office cubicle nerd that has an awkward life complete with a lack of positive social interactions and making a home for himself in the family garage. While his brother Gus (Paul Scheider) and his wife Karin (Emily Mortimer) live inside the house that Gus and Lars grew up in, Lars' reserved and simplistic life in the garage detaches himself from even having a simple dinner with his brother and sister-in-law.Thanks in part to nothing more than an offbeat discussion amongst co-workers about the possibility of purchasing an ""adult"" doll, Lars decides that he would purchase such a life sized doll. However, as his co-workers perhaps were thinking more about the sexual benefits of such a doll, Lars instead seems interested in courting the doll and bringing her into his life as his significant other.While certainly his new found girlfriend, who might be more accurately defined as a dollfriend, really cannot speak or show much affection back to Lars it is his delusional mind that creates an entire life for Bianca. Lars crafts a life and story for Bianca complete with the rationale for why she is restricted to a wheelchair to her family background to her hobbies and interests.But what is stranger is that the entire community then embraces Bianca as one of their own. Though it likely was initially done simply to appease Lars and exhibit a certain sense of sympathy for his newfound delusional mind, the community then embraces Bianca more and more. She goes from being a delusional aspect of Lars' mind to being a volunteer at the hospital and a churchgoing member of society.It is hard to understand where Lars' delusions come from in relation to Bianca as before her arrival on the delivery truck he certainly seemed a tad off but certainly not delusional. One might speculate that his love for Bianca was simply a way to gain the attention of a real life co-worker named Margo (Kelli Garner) that Lars seems to have an awkward liking for, as well.Directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Nancy Oliver, Lars and the Real Girl is a movie that just doesn't seem to make it. Though credit could be given for the fact that this is indeed a very different plot and storyline to a film, it is also a bit too far out there at the same time. Although Lars and the Real Girl received a 2008 Oscar Nomination for Best Writing, I believe that this film lacked any significant writing that would warrant such a nomination. Throughout the entire film one cannot help but think to themselves, ""Am I missing something?""The film is rather slow throughout and is less than imaginative in terms of substance. There are plenty of times throughout the movie that the story seems stale and the acting seems to be an act of just going through the motions rather than being a good example of embodying the character involved.Though in the film we gain a glimpse into the mind of a delusional character named Lars, the only think we are left with post-movie is the question as to whether or not fans of this film are themselves also in a delusional state of mind.",2,Those Enjoying This Film Must Be Delusional,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3970,"['Just', 'are', 'same', 'page', 'let', 'understand', 'correctly', 'A', 'delusional', 'office', 'worker', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'find', 'love', 'rather', 'court', 'pleasant', 'lass', 'instead', 'order', 'adult', 'doll', 'lover', 'companion', 'Then', 'townspeople', 'learn', 'embrace', 'said', 'doll', 'almost', 'real', 'entity', 'based', 'solely', 'delusional', 'conversations', 'fictitious', 'life', 'said', 'office', 'worker', 'crafted', 'new', 'lady', 'want', 'believe', 'foundation', 'good', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'been', 'lot', 'hype', 'movie', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'however', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'movie', 'rather', 'boring', 'take', 'traditional', 'love', 'story', 'gone', 'awry', 'thanks', 'part', 'delusional', 'fantasy', 'character', 'too', 'often', 'Napoleon', 'Dyanmite', 'half-brother.Lars', 'Lindstrom', 'Ryan', 'Gossling', 'everyday', 'office', 'cubicle', 'nerd', 'awkward', 'life', 'complete', 'lack', 'positive', 'social', 'interactions', 'making', 'home', 'family', 'garage', 'brother', 'Gus', 'Paul', 'Scheider', 'wife', 'Karin', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'live', 'house', 'Gus', 'Lars', 'grew', 'up', 'Lars', 'reserved', 'simplistic', 'life', 'garage', 'even', 'having', 'simple', 'dinner', 'brother', 'sister-in-law.Thanks', 'part', 'nothing', 'more', 'offbeat', 'discussion', 'co-workers', 'possibility', 'purchasing', 'adult', 'doll', 'Lars', 'would', 'purchase', 'life', 'sized', 'doll', 'However', 'co-workers', 'perhaps', 'were', 'thinking', 'more', 'sexual', 'benefits', 'such', 'doll', 'Lars', 'instead', 'interested', 'courting', 'doll', 'bringing', 'life', 'significant', 'other.While', 'certainly', 'new', 'found', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'accurately', 'defined', 'dollfriend', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'show', 'much', 'affection', 'back', 'Lars', 'delusional', 'mind', 'entire', 'life', 'Bianca', 'Lars', 'life', 'story', 'Bianca', 'complete', 'rationale', 'why', 'restricted', 'wheelchair', 'family', 'background', 'hobbies', 'interests.But', 'what', 'stranger', 'entire', 'community', 'then', 'Bianca', 'one', 'own', 'likely', 'was', 'initially', 'done', 'simply', 'appease', 'Lars', 'exhibit', 'certain', 'sense', 'sympathy', 'newfound', 'delusional', 'mind', 'community', 'then', 'Bianca', 'more', 'more', 'being', 'delusional', 'aspect', 'Lars', 'mind', 'being', 'volunteer', 'hospital', 'churchgoing', 'member', 'society.It', 'hard', 'understand', 'where', 'Lars', 'delusions', 'come', 'relation', 'Bianca', 'arrival', 'delivery', 'truck', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'tad', 'off', 'certainly', 'not', 'delusional', 'One', 'might', 'speculate', 'love', 'Bianca', 'was', 'simply', 'way', 'gain', 'attention', 'real', 'life', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Margo', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'have', 'awkward', 'liking', 'well.Directed', 'Craig', 'Gillespie', 'written', 'Nancy', 'Oliver', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'credit', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'fact', 'indeed', 'very', 'different', 'plot', 'storyline', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'received', '2008', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'Best', 'Writing', 'believe', 'film', 'lacked', 'significant', 'writing', 'would', 'warrant', 'such', 'nomination', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'Am', 'missing', 'something', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'less', 'imaginative', 'terms', 'substance', 'are', 'plenty', 'times', 'movie', 'story', 'stale', 'acting', 'be', 'act', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'rather', 'being', 'good', 'example', 'embodying', 'character', 'involved.Though', 'film', 'gain', 'glimpse', 'mind', 'delusional', 'character', 'named', 'Lars', 'only', 'think', 'are', 'left', 'post-movie', 'question', 'not', 'fans', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'delusional', 'state', 'mind']",N/A

1146262,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B0014D5RBE,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[1, 1]","What an amazing, delicate little movie.  There are so many missteps Lars and the Real Girl could have taken.  It could have quickly degenerated into a tacky sex comedy.  Or an immature cheap-laugh fest.  Opportunities abound for bad taste.  Where screenwriter Nancy Oliver demonstrates her great sensitivity and sense of nuance is in how she handles the story's various twists and turns without every falling into obvious traps.  In fact, in outline form her screenplay must have looked like the very way *not* to do it: there's little overt conflict, few missteps by major characters.  Without friction, I can imagine a scripting critic saying, ""There's no conflict for XX pages.  You have to have a big fight.  If everybody goes along with it nothing happens.""  Ah, yes, that's the secret.  This movie, seemingly about as tasteless a subject as one can imagine, is as gentle and sweet as an embrace.The whole thing is delightfully low-key.  That's what makes it so believable (the New York Times' review not withstanding).  Ryan Gosling plays Lars with just the right combination of sweetness and genuine mental feebleness that we neither pity him nor dislike him--we just see him as human.  Emily Mortimer is the all-American midwest girl who in real life just happens to come from ""across the pond.""  Her husband, played by Paul Schneider, is Lars' one foil, the one person who doesn't fall in line right away.  But even he comes to understand that sometimes you have to take a leap of faith to understand someone else's personal demons.And then there's Kelli Garner.  Despite the waif-like character she plays in this movie, all buck-toothed and wide-eyed, she's actually quite the babe.  If she keeps turning out good work like this, she could have quite a career ahead of her.  The scene where she and Lars go bowling is amazing in everything that is *not* said.  Body language--his and hers--tells the whole story.  The movie is quietly and confidently directed by first-time filmmaker Craig Gillespie.  He never feels compelled to push things along or kick up the drama via any artificial methods.  He and the film know where they're going from the first scene, and they get their at the perfect clip and the perfect pitch.  There's not a single misstep in this movie, and that's rare.Lars was up against Juno last year for best original screenplay, and Juno--more popular and heavily promoted--won.  While I enjoyed that movie immensely, Lars was harder to write, harder to direct.  Emotions weren't telegraphed.  Scenes did not progress along foreseeable paths, as they do in Juno.  Lars has many shadowy corners around which the plot twists in subtle directions.  It is so low-key that there is the danger constantly of drifting, meandering, yet this never happens.  Juno, fine as it was, didn't have this intricacy, and despite the subject matter was actually structured along fairly conventional lines.  But, ah, when did the Academy ever get it right?It's sad that rich, off-beat and ""inner-driven"" films like this are always super-low budget, with actors working for scale, and dark horses, even at the Oscars, which are supposed to recognize and stimulate the production of these kinds of pictures.  I'd recommend this picture, even if you think (especially if you think) the subject matter is off-putting.  It is precisely this sort of viewer who will be most surprised.  I would feel confident showing this movie in a church basement.  It's a sweet little film about acceptance, maturity, and love.",5,A miracle of a screenplay in one of the most overlooked films of the year,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,3517,"['What', 'amazing', 'delicate', 'little', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'missteps', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'could', 'have', 'quickly', 'degenerated', 'tacky', 'sex', 'comedy', 'immature', 'cheap-laugh', 'fest', 'Opportunities', 'abound', 'bad', 'taste', 'Where', 'screenwriter', 'Nancy', 'Oliver', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'sense', 'nuance', 'how', 'story', 'various', 'twists', 'turns', 'falling', 'obvious', 'traps', 'fact', 'outline', 'form', 'screenplay', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'very', 'way', '*not*', 'do', 'little', 'overt', 'conflict', 'few', 'missteps', 'major', 'characters', 'friction', 'can', 'imagine', 'scripting', 'critic', 'saying', 'conflict', 'XX', 'pages', 'have', 'have', 'big', 'fight', 'everybody', 'nothing', 'Ah', 'yes', 'secret', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'tasteless', 'subject', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'gentle', 'sweet', 'embrace.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'delightfully', 'low-key', 'what', 'so', 'believable', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'review', 'not', 'withstanding', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Lars', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'sweetness', 'genuine', 'mental', 'feebleness', 'pity', 'dislike', 'just', 'see', 'human', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'all-American', 'midwest', 'girl', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'come', 'pond', 'husband', 'played', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Lars', 'one', 'foil', 'one', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'fall', 'line', 'right', 'away', 'even', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'have', 'take', 'leap', 'faith', 'understand', 'someone', 'else', 'personal', 'demons.And', 'then', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'waif-like', 'character', 'movie', 'buck-toothed', 'wide-eyed', 'actually', 'quite', 'babe', 'turning', 'out', 'good', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'quite', 'career', 'ahead', 'scene', 'where', 'Lars', 'go', 'bowling', 'amazing', 'everything', '*not*', 'said', 'Body', 'language', 'hers', 'whole', 'story', 'movie', 'quietly', 'confidently', 'directed', 'first-time', 'filmmaker', 'Craig', 'Gillespie', 'never', 'compelled', 'push', 'things', 'kick', 'up', 'drama', 'artificial', 'methods', 'film', 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'first', 'scene', 'get', 'perfect', 'clip', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'not', 'single', 'misstep', 'movie', 'rare.Lars', 'was', 'up', 'Juno', 'last', 'year', 'best', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Juno', 'more', 'popular', 'heavily', 'promoted', 'won', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'Lars', 'was', 'harder', 'write', 'harder', 'direct', 'Emotions', 'were', ""n't"", 'telegraphed', 'Scenes', 'did', 'not', 'progress', 'foreseeable', 'paths', 'do', 'Juno', 'Lars', 'many', 'shadowy', 'corners', 'plot', 'twists', 'subtle', 'directions', 'so', 'low-key', 'danger', 'constantly', 'drifting', 'meandering', 'yet', 'never', 'Juno', 'fine', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'intricacy', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'actually', 'structured', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'lines', 'ah', 'when', 'did', 'Academy', 'ever', 'get', 'right', 'sad', 'rich', 'off-beat', 'inner-driven', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'super-low', 'budget', 'actors', 'working', 'scale', 'dark', 'horses', 'even', 'Oscars', 'are', 'supposed', 'recognize', 'stimulate', 'production', 'kinds', 'pictures', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'picture', 'even', 'think', 'especially', 'think', 'subject', 'matter', 'off-putting', 'precisely', 'sort', 'viewer', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'surprised', 'would', 'feel', 'confident', 'showing', 'movie', 'church', 'basement', 'sweet', 'little', 'film', 'acceptance', 'maturity', 'love']",N/A

Her name is Bianca, a life-sized love doll who has arrived in a packing crate. Lars treats her as a real person, though. First he introduces Bianca to his brother Gus and sister-in-law Karin at dinner before taking her to the church of the community in a wheelchair. Naturally Gus and Karin don't know what to do, but a local doctor advises them (and the entire townspeople) to go along with Lars's ""delusion."" The result is a charming, bittersweet tale of human nature.The unique film could not be a success without the convincing backstory of Lars himself. Nancy Oliver's screenplay gives us several hints as to the reasons for his shyness without interrupting the flow of the narrative. Lars lives in a garage and he doesn't want to touch people. We slowly come to understand him through Ryan Gosling's amazing performance as Lars, who makes his character endearing. No wonder the people of the community want him to be happy. By the end of the film's story, you will feel the same way too.The entire cast is great especially Paul Schneider as Gus, Emily Mortimer as Karin and most notably Patricia Clarkson as the doctor who quietly listens to Lars's story. Patricia Clarkson's fantastic performance gives her character as a wise and understanding doctor credibility and warmth. Actually the snowbound town and its people who support Lars are depicted sympathetically without being condescending or sentimental.

This film finds both  the humor and the pathos in the life of Lars, a socially awkward loner who buys a Real Doll and treats it as if it were a real woman.  You have to wonder if it was societal pressure or his own neuroses that finally pushed him to purchase this doll.  People wonder why he is by himself a lot or else assume that he is gay.  With all of that pressure and speculation, perhaps his actions are not so hard to understand after all.Ryan Gosling gives a nuanced performance as Lars, who cannot bear to be hugged or touched too much because he finds it physically painful, but who connects quite well with his lifesize plastic partner.  Patricia Clarkson is lovely as his compassionate doctor, who seems to be the only one who understands why Lars needs to go through this process in order to come to terms with his identity.It's refreshing that the doll is never used for sexual pleasure, which is the real reason why many people purchase it in the first place.In the end, the doll is no longer necessary, but we are left with some unanswered questions:  Will Lars ever get over his fear of being hugged?  Will he be able to embrace his brother's child without dropping it?There is also one quite unbelievable scene involving paramedics rushing the doll into the hospital via ambulance.

It is easy to see how this incredibly inqenious screenplay could have devolved into a farcical, over-the-top picture.  A film about a mentally ill, early 30s Midwestern guy who buys a sex doll to keep him company easily could have been a train wreck.  Fortunately, it is a gem of film showcasing the talents of Ryan Gosling along with a stellar supporting performances, most notably Patricia Clarkson as Lars doctor.Lars (Gosling) sister-in-law's pregnancy resurfaces painful childhood memories and brings Lars' mental illness to the forefront.  Lars is unable to connect physically and emotionally with another person.  The only thing able to bring Lars out of his ""shell"" and connect is Bianca.  The only catch:  Bianca is a sex doll Lars created and bought on the internet.  The initial shock and amusement of the tight knit community turns to acceptance as they begin to go along with the whole thing.  Part of the reason is because everyone adores Lars and his sweet innocence and decency.  If it all sounds crazy and absurd, it is, but the movie never succumbs to the temptation to either get too sentimental or slapstick.  There are scenes that will cause you to burst into laughter, but instantly bring you back to tender consideration for Lars and his situation.""Lars and Real Girl"" works because it is about people caring and connecting with each other, taking the time to understand who they are and why they are that way, and a community rallying together to help someone they love, in spite of their problems.
