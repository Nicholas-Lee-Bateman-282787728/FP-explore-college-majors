Dizzy Dean was a colorful character and this movie does a good (although slightly inaccurate) job of portraying it.  He was also an outstanding pitcher and all the boasting he did (he did it A LOT) was wonderful because he backed it up.  The movie is interesting all the way through, even the portions after his career ended.I recommend this film to any fan of classic baseball films.",5,Great Baseball Movie,1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,498,"['bought', 'movie', 'watching', '1952', 'quot', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'quot', 'think', 'are', 'great', 'Dizzy', 'Dean', 'was', 'colorful', 'character', 'movie', 'good', 'slightly', 'inaccurate', 'job', 'portraying', 'was', 'also', 'outstanding', 'pitcher', 'boasting', 'did', 'did', 'A', 'LOT', 'was', 'wonderful', 'backed', 'up', 'movie', 'interesting', 'way', 'even', 'portions', 'career', 'ended.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'fan', 'classic', 'baseball', 'films']",N/A
