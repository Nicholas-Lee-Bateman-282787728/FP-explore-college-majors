The HD picture quality is spectacular and it looks as if the performers are live in your living room.  The HD really showcases the look of this handsome stage show and its stunning costumes.  The performance on this blu-ray release is from a different night than the performance on the DVD release of the show.  I enjoyed seeing the subtle differences in the readings from the actors and the occasional different camera angle.  While the show itself has its weaknesses here and there, it has quite a few hilarious moments and dazzling musical numbers. The electrifying ""Le Jazz Hot"" is rich in color with sensational choreography, and ""Louis Says"" is a sparkling and clever piece.  Julie Andrews looks radiant and gives an enjoyable and funny performance as Victoria along with scene stealer Rachel York as Norma.  Their tango together (which would have been great in the 1982 film version) is worth the purchase of this disc.The only sound track available on this blu-ray release is a 5.1 surround, unlike the DVD version which had a 2.0 stereo track in addition to a 5.1 track.  The sound mix was noticeably different on the blu-ray. Please note that I listened to it on my 2 channel stereo system only.  The fidelity is excellent, but it has more of a tight sound with audience and certain other effects not as audible.  I would like to hear from someone who listened to the sound on a full 5.1 surround system to know if it the fullness and complete sound is revealed there or not.I'm so glad that Image Entertainment released the High Definition version of the show.  I knew it had been recorded in HD at the time and had been hoping for its release.

The 1982 movie is different in alot of areas, but I have to say this is a wonderful Broadway Musical with OUTSTANDING singing and dancing.  Julie Andrews OUTDOES herself and it is hard to believe when this was filmed she was 60 years old!  She is terrific, her voice sounds as good as it did in the original 1982 film, and this was from 1995, 13 years later.  Luckily we have this since poor Julie has since lost her voice due to throat surgery.  The supporting players were excellent.  Michael Nouri suprised me with the talent he has as a singer.  And I have to say Tony Roberts did an terrific job playing Toddy, even at times reminding me of Robert Preston in the original film.  They did a great job using a wig to make Tony appear more like Preston.  Rachel York was AWESOME in the role originally played by Leslie Ann Warren.  The picture quality and sound made me feel like I was right in the theater.  This is the first time I have actually purchased a broadway show on BLU Ray and I have to say it is well worth the cost.

548289,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B00004RERP,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[18, 18]","*****  REVISED/UPDATED REVIEW, May 2011 ******In my original review I lamented that the sound mix on the Blu-ray is faulty and that the orchestration and audience laughter is so muffled as to be inaudible.  I have to correct that:  I was watching the Blu-ray with the Blu-ray player hooked to a regular TV using composite audio/video cables.  Once I attached the player to a high-def TV and used an HDMI cable, everything played and sounded fine.  So the sound is no longer an issue.But there are other considerations with the Blu-ray version:  The performance on this Blu-ray is a different performance than is on the DVD.  Same show, different performance.  The camera blocking is either different or just edited differently.  And there a few quick zooms and jump cuts that look like the show was filmed live but the camera work was not edited before being committed to home video.  It plays like this was a live feed (this show was taped for broadcast in Japan -- did they air a live performance live on TV and just suffer with some bad camera goof-ups here and there?  If so, this is that performance.  The DVD version looks much more polished and professionally shot).The same distributor that released the DVD also released this Blu-ray, but they didn't include all the bonus features from the DVD.  In fact, they didn't include ANY of them.  I emailed the distributor for a comment on that but got no response.The picture quality on the Blu-ray is very good, no question.  The fact that you get a different performance from the DVD is interesting and a bit confusing (It's probably a rights issue.  Maybe that's why the DVD extras weren't ported over).I'd advise you to stick to the DVD.  The Blu-ray picture is great but the performance in the DVD (and the camera work on it) is better and more polished.",4,DVD is great.

Bernabo,"[4, 4]","I suppose there would be those who would see this 1995 Broadway production of ""Victor/Victoria"" starring Julie Andrews who did not see the 1982 movie ""Victor/Victoria"" starring Julie Andrews, but that has to be a rather insignificant minority. That matters because the chief enjoyment here is watching Andrews in what turned out to be her swan song as a performer. We all know the story about a woman pretending to be man impersonating a woman, so it is going to be the star, the performances, and the music that matter.The music is actually the weakest part of this music once you get past the ""Jazz Hot"" number from the original film. Henry Mancini was writing music for the show when he died and Frank Wildhorn was called in to write some more songs, but none of them are standout show tunes. ""Paris by Night,"" the opening song is okay, but it comes back as a tango and then again as a reprise, and each time it just flat out loses something. Then there are the lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, which manage at one point to rhyme ""sexy"" with both ""apoplexy"" and ""taxi."" There are lots of instances of the lyrics getting too cute and most of the songs are trying to provide psychological insights into the characters instead of being nice declarations of feeling and intent set to music that you at least want to hum out loud.Most of the songs do not test Andrews' voice all that much and I got the real sense that she was measuring herself throughout the show, the way an actress who does eight shows a week would have to in order to avoid disappointing her fans. Fortunately it is only when the Street Singer (Tara O'Brien) comes along to belt out a tune that you realize the star does not have the best voice in the show, which is not that surprising we are talking about someone returning to Broadway after being away for three decades. But the show is supposed to be a love fest for the star, and there is nothing wrong with that.I liked the performance of Tony Roberts as Carol Todd (Toddy), where he brought a casual ease to the role and made it work by doing it quite differently from how Robert Preston did in the film. Michael Nouri also plays King Marchand in a lower key while Rachel York's Norma Cassidy goes way over the top and pretty much steals every scene in which she appears. Ironically, her one big number is the only place in the film where it becomes all too much, but she does get the biggest laugh in the show when she follows up on a sudden desire to become a nun. The other key member of the supporting cast, Gregory Jbara as Squash Bernstein, also does a solid job and has the best moment in the big finale as well.Usually a musical where you do not care for the music is not going to be worth catching, but while this version of ""Victor/Victoria"" is not as much fun as you would like it to be it is enjoyable enough. Just do not be surprised when watching it makes you want to go back and watch the original movie again or to go back and listen to the original Broadway cast recordings of some of the classic musicals that Julie Andrews was in way back when.",4,Think of this as a Broadway swan song for Julie Andrews,1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,3083,"['suppose', 'would', 'be', 'who', 'would', 'see', '1995', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Victor/Victoria', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', '1982', 'movie', 'Victor/Victoria', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'be', 'rather', 'insignificant', 'minority', 'matters', 'chief', 'enjoyment', 'here', 'watching', 'Andrews', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'swan', 'song', 'performer', 'know', 'story', 'woman', 'pretending', 'be', 'man', 'impersonating', 'woman', 'going', 'be', 'star', 'performances', 'music', 'matter.The', 'music', 'actually', 'weakest', 'part', 'music', 'once', 'get', 'Jazz', 'Hot', 'number', 'original', 'film', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'was', 'writing', 'music', 'show', 'when', 'died', 'Frank', 'Wildhorn', 'was', 'called', 'write', 'more', 'songs', 'none', 'are', 'standout', 'show', 'tunes', 'Paris', 'Night', 'opening', 'song', 'okay', 'back', 'tango', 'then', 'again', 'reprise', 'time', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'something', 'Then', 'are', 'lyrics', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'manage', 'one', 'point', 'rhyme', 'sexy', 'apoplexy', 'taxi', 'are', 'lots', 'instances', 'lyrics', 'getting', 'too', 'cute', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'trying', 'provide', 'psychological', 'insights', 'characters', 'instead', 'being', 'nice', 'declarations', 'feeling', 'intent', 'set', 'music', 'least', 'want', 'hum', 'out', 'loud.Most', 'songs', 'do', 'not', 'test', 'Andrews', 'voice', 'much', 'got', 'real', 'sense', 'was', 'measuring', 'show', 'way', 'actress', 'who', 'eight', 'shows', 'week', 'would', 'have', 'order', 'avoid', 'disappointing', 'fans', 'Fortunately', 'only', 'when', 'Street', 'Singer', 'Tara', ""O'Brien"", 'along', 'belt', 'out', 'tune', 'realize', 'star', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'voice', 'show', 'not', 'surprising', 'are', 'talking', 'someone', 'returning', 'Broadway', 'being', 'away', 'three', 'decades', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'fest', 'star', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'that.I', 'liked', 'performance', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'Carol', 'Todd', 'Toddy', 'where', 'brought', 'casual', 'ease', 'role', 'made', 'work', 'doing', 'quite', 'differently', 'how', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'did', 'film', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'also', 'King', 'Marchand', 'lower', 'key', 'Rachel', 'York', 'Norma', 'Cassidy', 'way', 'top', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'scene', 'Ironically', 'one', 'big', 'number', 'only', 'place', 'film', 'where', 'all', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'show', 'when', 'up', 'sudden', 'desire', 'become', 'nun', 'other', 'key', 'member', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Gregory', 'Jbara', 'Squash', 'Bernstein', 'also', 'solid', 'job', 'best', 'moment', 'big', 'finale', 'well.Usually', 'musical', 'where', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'music', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'worth', 'catching', 'version', 'Victor/Victoria', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'watching', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'original', 'movie', 'again', 'go', 'back', 'listen', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'recordings', 'classic', 'musicals', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'was', 'way', 'back', 'when']",N/A

The cast is impeccable:  Julie  Andrews, Tony Roberts, Michael Nouri, Rachel York, Gregory Jbara, and  everyone else give their all and then some.  The show was, for the most  part, well directed.

This show immediately became a hit and was nominated for several awards.  Unfortunately and due to problems with Ms. Andrews's vocal chords, the show came to an end in one year.  Nevertheless, here you have it recorded for those that were not able to enjoy it live and for all of us who love watching it over and over again.Of all the adaptations from movies to the stage, I have to say that is the best one by far.  Staging was excellent as exemplified by the scenes from Paris during the 1930s and the adjacent hotel suites for King Marchand and Victor (where most of the plot takes place).  Lighting and dressing/costumes were masterfully adapted to the ""stage standards"".  The dialogue from the movie was mostly preserved but the musical numbers were adapted (and even changed) for Broadway and they were/are superb.  The plot is very similar to the movie but there is an unexpected surprise in the grand finale which turns out much better than in the movie version.Of the original cast from the 1982 movie, only Ms. Andrews made it to Broadway.  As much as I would have loved to have seen Robert Preston (Toddy) in the Big Apple, his role was performed by Michael Nouri which was good.  The role of Norma Cassidy (played by Leslie Ann Warren in the movie) was played by Rachel York and her performance was perfect as Marchand's girlfriend who did not had much of a brain.

The pacing is very slow and even, leaving me with a dull, flat feeling. The new songs are uninspired. Julie Andrews's voice is adequate but far from her prime. Everyone else is thoroughly upstaged by Norma Cassidy (Rachel York); Blake Edwards was smart enough to limit the exposure of this most vivid character in the movie or she'd have dominated there, too.The musical suffers terribly in comparison to the movie.Stage productions just don't do well on film, in my opinion.  The broader gestures and facial expressions, the vocal projecting and the need to face one direction all the time make it look physically stiff and ... well ... staged. This was filmed to video, too, so it loses depth of perspective and really butchers the lighting.

I bought it when it first came out and I was so thrilled to have it on DVD because I wasn't able to go to New York to see the production.

Her upward vocal slide at the end of ""Le Jazz Hot"" does have a noticeable switch from her lower to upper register.

548302,A12KA3D8EZZQL8,B00004RERP,"Solar ""Solar""","[2, 2]","After many years of waiting for the right moment to see this filmed version of Blake Edwards' finest screen work - Victor/Victoria, I bought this DVD, quite pleased in every way with the quality, and the presentation at the beginning from Julie Andrews, as it was made for Japanese television broadcast during the original run of the show on Broadway, which would never happen in the States, but an exception was made for Japan in this instance.The original 1982 film of Victor/Victoria was a film i grew up watching and loved very much. I watched it many many times, and it will always remain dear to my heart, as one of my favourite movie musicals.When I first watched this version of the Broadway production I was dissapointed in Tony Roberts performance as 'Toddy' from the outset - as he has nothing on Robert Preston who played the role in the film. Tony Roberts is given so much opportunity to make the best out of this role and he just hasn't 'got it' as far as i'm concerned.The play tries very hard to be the same as the film, but this is ultimately where it fails. This is one of those... 'trying so hard to capture the magic of the original but failed miserably' moments. The moment where this fails in every case is where the writers and directors don't make any real attempt to totally re-invent the show. Which is really what needs to be done when transferring to a different medium, Screen to Stage or vise-versa.I think Michael Nouri is wonderful, but he again , in this role of King Marchan, the Chicago gangster that falls in love with Julie Andrews' character Victoria - doesn't have James Garner's charisma or sense of style and humour that carried him so well through the original film.Rachel York gives the best of the supporting performances in this version. Her characterization of Norma Cassidy - the dizzy dame mole of King Marchan - is an impression of Lesley Ann Warren's Oscar nominated performance in the film, but she gives it a good, passionate touch which i really like.And finally, dear Julie - what can I say... she's still fabulous. She doesn't sing the way she used to, but she still shows the best voice you could hope for at that point in her career - sadly she no longer sings - as we all know - this is one of the greatest tragedies in show business. Her performance in Victor/Victoria earned her a Tony nomination (the only nomination this production received) - which Julie publicly rebuked! At the end of a matinee performance she called for a press conferrence - just after the curtain closed - in costume and all Julie delivered a speech praising her fellow collegues and the creators of the show - and refused to accept the Tony nomination as she felt the Tony committee had seriously overlooked the rest of the cast and crew in not acknowledging them.The entire theatre community in NY were stunned, and, even though the Tony Awards kept her on as a nominee - she obviously didn't win. Donna Murphy won that year for The King And I.This DVD is worth buying if you're really a serious hardcore Julie Andrews fan or if you are very keen on the show of Victor/Victoria - i didn't really enjoy the show - the score is ok. Some of the newer songs my Mancini and Bricusse are not as impactual as the original songs, most of which transfer to the stage version, but the score clearly needed filling out for a fully fledged musical. A couple of songs were replaced with other songs as well. The films' score won an Oscar for Best Original Score - but somehow the stage version didn't measure up quite the same.The Tango sequence is a cute moment - there are many good ideas in the stage version, but alot of the moments look contrived for comic effect, and i don't think Blake Edwards really suits the stage - even though many of his films give the impression that he would suit it.Edwards has not changed much of the script either - many of the scenes are the same - and the lines literally word for word are mostly the same in many scenes.",3,Round about what i thought...,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,3982,"['many', 'years', 'waiting', 'right', 'moment', 'see', 'filmed', 'version', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'finest', 'screen', 'work', 'Victor/Victoria', 'bought', 'DVD', 'quite', 'pleased', 'way', 'quality', 'presentation', 'beginning', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'was', 'made', 'Japanese', 'television', 'broadcast', 'original', 'run', 'show', 'Broadway', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'States', 'exception', 'was', 'made', 'Japan', 'instance.The', 'original', '1982', 'film', 'Victor/Victoria', 'was', 'film', 'i', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'loved', 'very', 'much', 'watched', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'dear', 'heart', 'one', 'favourite', 'movie', 'musicals.When', 'first', 'watched', 'version', 'Broadway', 'production', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'performance', ""'Toddy"", 'outset', 'nothing', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'film', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'opportunity', 'make', 'best', 'role', 'just', ""n't"", ""'got"", 'as', 'far', 'i', ""'m"", 'concerned.The', 'play', 'tries', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'same', 'film', 'ultimately', 'where', 'one', ""'trying"", 'so', 'hard', 'capture', 'magic', 'original', 'failed', 'miserably', 'moments', 'moment', 'where', 'case', 'where', 'writers', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'real', 'attempt', 'totally', 're-invent', 'show', 'Which', 'really', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'when', 'transferring', 'different', 'medium', 'Screen', 'Stage', 'vise-versa.I', 'think', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'wonderful', 'again', 'role', 'King', 'Marchan', 'Chicago', 'gangster', 'love', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'character', 'Victoria', ""n't"", 'have', 'James', 'Garner', 'charisma', 'sense', 'style', 'humour', 'carried', 'so', 'well', 'original', 'film.Rachel', 'York', 'best', 'supporting', 'performances', 'version', 'characterization', 'Norma', 'Cassidy', 'dizzy', 'dame', 'mole', 'King', 'Marchan', 'impression', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'film', 'good', 'passionate', 'touch', 'i', 'really', 'like.And', 'finally', 'dear', 'Julie', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'still', 'fabulous', ""n't"", 'sing', 'way', 'used', 'still', 'best', 'voice', 'could', 'hope', 'point', 'career', 'sadly', 'no', 'longer', 'sings', 'know', 'one', 'greatest', 'tragedies', 'show', 'business', 'performance', 'Victor/Victoria', 'earned', 'Tony', 'nomination', 'only', 'nomination', 'production', 'received', 'Julie', 'publicly', 'rebuked', 'end', 'matinee', 'performance', 'called', 'press', 'conferrence', 'just', 'curtain', 'closed', 'costume', 'Julie', 'delivered', 'speech', 'praising', 'fellow', 'collegues', 'creators', 'show', 'refused', 'accept', 'Tony', 'nomination', 'felt', 'Tony', 'committee', 'had', 'seriously', 'overlooked', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'not', 'acknowledging', 'them.The', 'entire', 'theatre', 'community', 'NY', 'were', 'stunned', 'even', 'Tony', 'Awards', 'kept', 'nominee', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'won', 'year', 'King', 'I.This', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', ""'re"", 'really', 'serious', 'hardcore', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'fan', 'are', 'very', 'keen', 'show', 'Victor/Victoria', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'show', 'score', 'ok', 'newer', 'songs', 'Mancini', 'Bricusse', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'impactual', 'original', 'songs', 'most', 'transfer', 'stage', 'version', 'score', 'clearly', 'needed', 'filling', 'out', 'fully', 'fledged', 'musical', 'couple', 'songs', 'were', 'replaced', 'other', 'songs', 'well', 'films', 'score', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', 'somehow', 'stage', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'quite', 'same.The', 'Tango', 'sequence', 'cute', 'moment', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'ideas', 'stage', 'version', 'alot', 'moments', 'look', 'contrived', 'comic', 'effect', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'really', 'suits', 'stage', 'even', 'many', 'films', 'give', 'impression', 'would', 'suit', 'it.Edwards', 'not', 'changed', 'much', 'script', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'same', 'lines', 'literally', 'word', 'word', 'are', 'mostly', 'same', 'many', 'scenes']",N/A
