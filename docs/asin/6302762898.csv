The Rochefort's character somehow KNOWS the hairdresser is waiting for him somewhere and it does not matter how he spends his life  before he meets her. And he does not give a damn - see him dance. We do not  see him mature, get a job, serve in the army - it all unimportant. Just a  childhood dream coming true - as was expected. The sad thing that there is  AFTER, not only BEFORE, and his wife is not going to stay. There were just  a few options to finish the movie - the lovers could just go on living  happily ever after - but then they'd be entering the saccharine realm of  Mrs.Nora Efron. Double suicide is a bit melodramatic. Frankly it's a no win  game. Any ending is not suitable for this movie. But it does not matter.  All the &quot;events&quot; are just a prelude to the pure magic of the  dream fulfilled.I am not even sure it happens in the real life. Maybe  he has reached his nirvana in a dream and the wife's death is a metaphor  for waking up alone.",5,Pure Magic.,945129600,"12 14, 1999",1999,1054,"['European', 'Cinema', 'best', 'Very', 'tender', 'poetic', 'one', '3', 'favourite', 'films', 'Rochefort', 'character', 'somehow', 'KNOWS', 'hairdresser', 'waiting', 'somewhere', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'life', 'not', 'give', 'damn', 'see', 'dance', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'mature', 'get', 'job', 'serve', 'army', 'unimportant', 'Just', 'childhood', 'dream', 'coming', 'true', 'was', 'expected', 'sad', 'thing', 'AFTER', 'not', 'only', 'BEFORE', 'wife', 'not', 'going', 'stay', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'options', 'finish', 'movie', 'lovers', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'entering', 'saccharine', 'realm', 'Mrs.Nora', 'Efron', 'Double', 'suicide', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'Frankly', 'win', 'game', 'ending', 'not', 'suitable', 'movie', 'not', 'matter', 'quot', 'events', 'quot', 'are', 'just', 'prelude', 'pure', 'magic', 'dream', 'fulfilled.I', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'real', 'life', 'Maybe', 'reached', 'nirvana', 'dream', 'wife', 'death', 'metaphor', 'waking', 'up', 'alone']",The Hairdresser's Husband VHS
332777,A2D59KBT80LZ7L,6302762898,"Bob Pr. ""Bob Pr.""","[6, 6]","(This is edited from my IMDb review) The director (Patrice Leconte) has a gift for helping us see people from other perspectives (e.g., ""The Man on the Train"", and others). And as in that movie, Jean Rochefort is one of the leading characters. And, as there can be no one single meaning to a work of art, so any movie will evoke many. But I strongly disagree with the narrative described in most other reviews of this charming movie, thinking my own makes far more sense.A boy (perhaps 12 years old?) on the cusp of puberty, enjoys the sensuality of physical closeness to the woman barber who cuts his hair. His father has aspirations for his children and, one evening at supper, he asks this son what he wants to be when he grows up. He mistakes his son's answer, groping toward his awakening sexuality (and wanting to marry a female barber), for a lack of ambition. He disapproves of his son's ambition and over-reacts, chastising him at the supper table, and sends him immediately to his room. There is a hint that then both he and his wife think he's gone too far and may be suffering from the thought that he's been overly punishing.But instead of being hurt or angry, his son takes further solace in his fantasy, very much as Max did (in different ways) in the classic book, ""Where the Wild Things Are."" The rest of this movie is this son's dream of what his future would be like married to a female hairdresser. As in a dream--as in a 12 year old boy's simplified view of what it means to be a married adult and what an adult world is like--many parts of reality are missing: e.g., it's as if he needs no job, as if love & marriage happen in almost an instant, as if his wife's life revolves only about him and his about her, as if all their adult life took place in his wife's barber shop, and as if his wife would, of course, prefer death to losing him.The somewhat bizarre little recurring dance which he does underscores the non-reality, the dream-like quality of this major part of the movie. This is a charming movie of the world of a boy who is just coming into puberty, trying to make sense of this new, delightful experience of being close to a woman's body.  That's the meaning to me and this view is so compelling it's hard to believe the director intended any other. And it's also hard for me to understand why reviews by experienced critics (like Roger Ebert) miss what (to me) is such an obviously intended meaning.",5,I disagree with all other reviews I've read,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,2436,"['edited', 'IMDb', 'review', 'director', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'gift', 'helping', 'see', 'people', 'other', 'perspectives', 'e.g.', 'Man', 'Train', 'others', 'movie', 'Jean', 'Rochefort', 'one', 'leading', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'single', 'meaning', 'work', 'art', 'movie', 'will', 'evoke', 'many', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'narrative', 'described', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', 'charming', 'movie', 'thinking', 'own', 'far', 'more', 'sense.A', 'boy', 'perhaps', '12', 'years', 'old', 'cusp', 'puberty', 'sensuality', 'physical', 'closeness', 'woman', 'barber', 'who', 'hair', 'father', 'aspirations', 'children', 'one', 'evening', 'supper', 'son', 'what', 'be', 'when', 'up', 'son', 'answer', 'groping', 'awakening', 'sexuality', 'wanting', 'marry', 'female', 'barber', 'lack', 'ambition', 'son', 'ambition', 'over-reacts', 'chastising', 'supper', 'table', 'immediately', 'room', 'hint', 'then', 'wife', 'think', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'may', 'be', 'suffering', 'thought', 'been', 'overly', 'punishing.But', 'instead', 'being', 'hurt', 'angry', 'son', 'further', 'solace', 'fantasy', 'very', 'much', 'Max', 'did', 'different', 'ways', 'classic', 'book', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'rest', 'movie', 'son', 'dream', 'what', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'married', 'female', 'hairdresser', 'dream', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'simplified', 'view', 'what', 'be', 'married', 'adult', 'what', 'adult', 'world', 'many', 'parts', 'reality', 'are', 'missing', 'e.g.', 'job', 'love', 'marriage', 'happen', 'almost', 'instant', 'wife', 'life', 'only', 'adult', 'life', 'took', 'place', 'wife', 'barber', 'shop', 'wife', 'would', 'course', 'prefer', 'death', 'losing', 'him.The', 'somewhat', 'bizarre', 'little', 'recurring', 'dance', 'non-reality', 'dream-like', 'quality', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'charming', 'movie', 'world', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'coming', 'puberty', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'new', 'delightful', 'experience', 'being', 'close', 'woman', 'body', 'meaning', 'view', 'so', 'compelling', 'hard', 'believe', 'director', 'intended', 'other', 'also', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'reviews', 'experienced', 'critics', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'miss', 'what', 'such', 'obviously', 'intended', 'meaning']",The Hairdresser's Husband VHS
332778,A13ZPQNYAWRII9,6302762898,burneyfan@btinternet.com,"[1, 4]","This is a story about Antoine, played by Jean Rochefort, who because of a pleasureable experience with a local woman hairdresser at the age of twelve, becomes obsessed with the idea of one day marrying a hairdresser. So when one day many years later he walks into a hairdressing salon and finds there a beautiful woman with a lovely smile and a charming manner, he asks her to  marry him and she agrees. Just like that.Now if you like poetic, romantic fantasy, then you'll love this. But, on the other hand, if, like me, you prefer a slice of real life with real characters you can believe in, doing things that make sense, then you'll find that this film leaves a lot to be desired.We are asked to believe that a beautiful lone woman hairdresser, played by Anna Galiena, is so desperate to get married that she is willing to accept an offer of marriage from an unprepossessing older man, a man she knows nothing about and with whom she has exchanged no more than a couple of words! A likely story. It might have rung more true if he had been George Clooney, but as it is, it seemed to me preposterous. Men would have been flocking in from miles around to  have their hair cut by such as charmer. She would have been spoilt for choice.But the unreality doesn't stop there. They live together in a state of supreme bliss for ten years in a kind of time-capsule without apparently having any friends or relations and without the salon changing one iota. And then at the end of that time she commits suicide - not because she is unhappy but because she is too happy and is fearful of a time arriving when he will stop loving her and she will no longer be happy. Does that make sense to you?Even so, as in  most French films the ending tugs at your heart-strings. Throughout nearly the whole course of the film  we have watched her moving about her salon and going to the pay-desk. The whole place, with her bright presence in it, has become very familiar. Now  suddenly she is not there anymore. He is sitting alone. And we experience her loss almost as much as he does.",4,A Dream Love.,971481600,"10 14, 2000",2000,2067,"['story', 'Antoine', 'played', 'Jean', 'Rochefort', 'who', 'pleasureable', 'experience', 'local', 'woman', 'hairdresser', 'age', 'twelve', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'one', 'day', 'marrying', 'hairdresser', 'So', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'hairdressing', 'salon', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'lovely', 'smile', 'charming', 'manner', 'marry', 'Just', 'that.Now', 'like', 'poetic', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'other', 'hand', 'prefer', 'slice', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'characters', 'can', 'believe', 'doing', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'film', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.We', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'beautiful', 'lone', 'woman', 'hairdresser', 'played', 'Anna', 'Galiena', 'so', 'desperate', 'get', 'married', 'willing', 'accept', 'offer', 'marriage', 'unprepossessing', 'older', 'man', 'man', 'nothing', 'whom', 'exchanged', 'no', 'more', 'couple', 'words', 'likely', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'rung', 'more', 'true', 'had', 'been', 'George', 'Clooney', 'seemed', 'preposterous', 'Men', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'flocking', 'miles', 'around', 'have', 'hair', 'cut', 'such', 'charmer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spoilt', 'choice.But', 'unreality', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'live', 'together', 'state', 'supreme', 'bliss', 'ten', 'years', 'kind', 'time-capsule', 'apparently', 'having', 'friends', 'relations', 'salon', 'changing', 'one', 'iota', 'then', 'end', 'time', 'suicide', 'not', 'unhappy', 'too', 'happy', 'fearful', 'time', 'arriving', 'when', 'will', 'stop', 'loving', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'happy', 'make', 'sense', 'Even', 'so', 'most', 'French', 'films', 'ending', 'tugs', 'heart-strings', 'nearly', 'whole', 'course', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'moving', 'salon', 'going', 'pay-desk', 'whole', 'place', 'bright', 'presence', 'become', 'very', 'familiar', 'Now', 'suddenly', 'not', 'there', 'anymore', 'sitting', 'alone', 'experience', 'loss', 'almost', 'as', 'much']",The Hairdresser's Husband VHS

332781,A2UBWDZF1HDXFZ,6302762898,Douglas M. May,"[31, 33]","I knew of Patrice Leconte through ""Monsieur Hire"" but nothing prepared me for this absolute, mysterious masterpiece.  The thing I loved most about this film was the characters' apparent lack of motivation and the unreality that pervaded every frame of the movie.  Actually, the characters aren't all that mysterious once you realize that they are acting spontaneously, in response to deeply felt emotional promptings,instead of exhibiting the typical calculated responses of Americans, who usually derive their sense of self-worth and their notions of what is desirable from the television world of George Clooney et al. See, Leconte says, you can actually live spontaneously and authentically, even break out into dancing for no apparent reason.  And the fact that life is so capricious, so filled with the tragic and unexpected (the suicide of Mathilde) makes it even more imperative that we live fully in the moment, honoring our truest feelings and deepest desires.An extension of this was the typically Gallic celebration of ""inappropriate"" love. Rather than extolling the quotidian in matters of the heart, the French (and other Europeans) constantly remind us that there is in fact no quotidian--that love is often an unequal alliance between people of different ages and backgrounds who come together for no discernible reason and fulfill each other according to no defensible plan in the brief time that is theirs.If this film leaves you scratching your head, it won't fail to amaze you with its beautiful cinematography and hypnotic editing.

332790,ASJ89T42CIUHU,6302762898,V. Marshall,"[25, 27]","The French certainly know how to film a sensuous romantic tale without an ounce of vulgarity. This film is a beautiful tribute about a young boy growing up with an obsession for hairdressers. It is often funny, sexy, and even sad but woven together masterfully into a striking film.Jean Rochefort plays the man who recounts his life story as it pertains to his love affair with women hairdressers. He begins the story developing a crush upon an older robust woman who cuts his hair. As a grown man he falls in love with a beautiful woman who holds a life of mystery but he marries her without question and never seems to see any faults within her. Rochefort represents either a man in complete and blinding love or an obsessive pervert depending on how you look at him. He is tender and loving but also pretty close to stalking material! His best scenes are also his funniest when he dances to Arabic music and tries to mesmerize little boys into getting their haircuts without fussing.The woman who plays the ""hairdresser"" is Anna Galiena, an absolute beauty who is seductive and troubled. She holds the town's men within her grasp but only loves Rochefort. The love scenes are extremely erotic without any nudity, something only the French are capable of filming it seems. Galiena never reveals her past or why she seems somehow desperately sad. She seems to cover up her emptiness through an anxious obsession with cutting hair and having sex with Rochefort. Her quiet complexities carry the film because the viewers continue to hope for something to be revealed about this private stunning woman.Although this film is exquisitely beautiful it is also frustrating because the characters never reveal their truths. It is easy to see why Rochefort would be passionate about Galiena but what drives Galiena to be interested in Rochefort? Possibly the filmmakers decided to let the viewers form their own opinions about each character. Regardless it is worth the effort but you may never look at hairdressers quite the same.",4,Is It Love or Obsession?,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2023,"['French', 'certainly', 'know', 'how', 'film', 'sensuous', 'romantic', 'tale', 'ounce', 'vulgarity', 'film', 'beautiful', 'tribute', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'obsession', 'hairdressers', 'often', 'funny', 'sexy', 'even', 'sad', 'woven', 'together', 'masterfully', 'striking', 'film.Jean', 'Rochefort', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'story', 'love', 'affair', 'women', 'hairdressers', 'story', 'developing', 'crush', 'older', 'robust', 'woman', 'who', 'hair', 'grown', 'man', 'love', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'mystery', 'question', 'never', 'see', 'faults', 'Rochefort', 'man', 'complete', 'blinding', 'love', 'obsessive', 'pervert', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'tender', 'loving', 'also', 'pretty', 'close', 'stalking', 'material', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'funniest', 'when', 'Arabic', 'music', 'tries', 'mesmerize', 'little', 'boys', 'getting', 'haircuts', 'fussing.The', 'woman', 'who', 'hairdresser', 'Anna', 'Galiena', 'absolute', 'beauty', 'who', 'seductive', 'troubled', 'town', 'men', 'grasp', 'only', 'Rochefort', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'erotic', 'nudity', 'something', 'only', 'French', 'are', 'capable', 'filming', 'Galiena', 'never', 'past', 'why', 'somehow', 'desperately', 'sad', 'cover', 'up', 'emptiness', 'anxious', 'obsession', 'cutting', 'hair', 'having', 'sex', 'Rochefort', 'quiet', 'complexities', 'carry', 'film', 'viewers', 'continue', 'hope', 'something', 'be', 'revealed', 'private', 'stunning', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'also', 'frustrating', 'characters', 'never', 'reveal', 'truths', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Rochefort', 'would', 'be', 'passionate', 'Galiena', 'what', 'Galiena', 'be', 'interested', 'Rochefort', 'Possibly', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'let', 'viewers', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'character', 'Regardless', 'effort', 'may', 'never', 'look', 'hairdressers', 'quite', 'same']",The Hairdresser's Husband VHS
