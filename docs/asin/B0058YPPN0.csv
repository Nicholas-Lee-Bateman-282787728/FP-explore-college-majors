Season 4 seems rather &#34;vacant&#34;, as though the writers weren't on their game.  Big plot holes and threads that aren't going anywhere. Gratuitous nudity appeared and more of the f-bomb as fillers.  John Goodman's character was poorly drawn and poorly acted as a Bible spewing mercenary with 4 obese kids in cahoots with a nut-job CIA agent who gets a bunch of people killed in Afghanistan while illegally extracting a supposedly-terrorist informant who turns out to be a kid who turns out to be the agent's kid so then he has to break his lover's neck, blah, blah, blah, what????  Rose Byrne (not my fave anyway) seemed perpetually hang-dog and droopy eyed.  Glenn Close/Patty is forced into this silly subplot about retaining custody of her granddaughter who is never seen.....it's a non-working theme.  Glenn Close could act her way through anything but she was given pretty disjointed stuff this season.

1447548,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B0058YPPN0,Claire,"[1, 2]","As a huge fan of Damages I have clung to every episode like an addict awaiting my fix. This show hit the ground running- it was intense and addicting from the very first shot in which the elevator doors open and out stumbles our protagonist Ellen, the poor weak little waif who wanders out the door and into our tv world plus into the world of antagonist sociopath Patty who, by the way, makes Alex Forrest from &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34; look like Mother Theresa.I think I totally marathon-watched every single ep for not just the first season but also the second and third within probably a week. I was that hooked. Then for some reason the FX channel dropped it (probably b/c it didn't have enough profanity and borderline porn that their other shows offer) and I had to retrieve seasons four and five from the internet. As with Mad Men's 5th season which also came after an unexpected delay I found the series had declined. The characters are still riveting but the writing just didn't generate much interest with its plots and storylines which used to be full of twists. The genius of the first three seasons just seems to have bailed out of the fourth and fifth seasons.(Since season five is not here to review I'm gonna comment on both of the last two seasons.) The plot in season four is just not as interesting. The same can be said of season five. Only season five is worse. Everything bad about season four is doubled in season five really. Both seasons show too much flashing back- in season four, it is within the season- they keep showing the same scenes repeated over and over. In season five, they keep showing either dreams recurring over and over or they show flashbacks from the first, second and third seasons. Season five also consists of a lot of shots of Ryan Phillipe's naked butt as he bangs various chicks. Then there are various scenes that drag on and on while the viewer waits for something ANYTHING to happen. For example, Patty and Ellen are stranded in a Maine airport during a snowstorm. I thought something good was gonna happen but the only &#34;excitement&#34; that occurred was when Patty broke in to the liquor cabinet. WHOA!!! The whole episode practically was devoted to the two women sitting in an airport munching on crackers from the vending machine. It's actually even less exciting than I'm making it out to be. They could have added some shots of the paint chipping off the walls and that might've helped!Both seasons were very slow and too convoluted. What really made the show exciting during the first three seasons was not only the great characters but also the fast-paced movement of the show- it didn't wait for you. During the first three years, from the minute each season started it was like an adrenaline rush to see each new episode and find out what was gonna happen. It was exciting. I got so many people hooked on Damages in the beginning. EVERYONE loved it. Sadly, though, all good things must come to an end. I'm sure it's dfficult to maintain that kind of stamina year after year. So if you are a fan of the show (at least for the first three seasons) but debated about whether or not to purchase seasons four and five, beware that the two final seasons may not live up to the standard set by the previous three. They are still better than like 95% of the crap on tv now but just don't get your hopes up.Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are still amazing in their roles and the guest stars add a lot as well- John Goodman in season four and Ryan Phillipe in season five. But performances are not enough to save a failing show. As I said, all these good shows eventually start to decline- I loved the first few seasons of Mad Men as well as Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy but all have just lost their luster in my opinion. I wish I had better news- I believe as with Mad Men that I am in the minority when I say the show isn't as good but that's fine. I'm glad some people still like the shows. However, I see from other reviews that it's not just me. Whatever... people are entitled to their opinions and I'm sure people who vehemently support a show no matter how bad it gets will certainly express that. But I'm just trying to be helpful to those people who, as I said above, may be debating about watching/purchasing seasons four and five. To them I say: get them off the internet or from Net- -flix but save your money if you were thinking of buying them.",2,Declining and showing no signs of improvement...,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,4418,"['huge', 'fan', 'Damages', 'have', 'clung', 'episode', 'addict', 'awaiting', 'fix', 'show', 'hit', 'ground', 'running-', 'was', 'intense', 'addicting', 'very', 'first', 'shot', 'elevator', 'doors', 'open', 'stumbles', 'protagonist', 'Ellen', 'poor', 'weak', 'little', 'waif', 'who', 'out', 'door', 'tv', 'world', 'world', 'antagonist', 'sociopath', 'Patty', 'who', 'way', 'Alex', 'Forrest', '34', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', '34', 'look', 'Mother', 'Theresa.I', 'think', 'totally', 'marathon-watched', 'single', 'ep', 'not', 'just', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'second', 'third', 'probably', 'week', 'was', 'hooked', 'Then', 'reason', 'FX', 'channel', 'dropped', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'profanity', 'borderline', 'porn', 'other', 'shows', 'offer', 'had', 'retrieve', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'internet', 'Mad', 'Men', '5th', 'season', 'also', 'came', 'unexpected', 'delay', 'found', 'series', 'had', 'declined', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'riveting', 'writing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'generate', 'much', 'interest', 'plots', 'storylines', 'used', 'be', 'full', 'twists', 'genius', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'just', 'have', 'bailed', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'season', 'five', 'not', 'here', 'review', ""'m"", 'gon', 'comment', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'plot', 'season', 'four', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'season', 'five', 'Only', 'season', 'five', 'worse', 'Everything', 'bad', 'season', 'four', 'doubled', 'season', 'five', 'really', 'seasons', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'flashing', 'back-', 'season', 'four', 'season-', 'keep', 'showing', 'same', 'scenes', 'repeated', 'over', 'season', 'five', 'keep', 'showing', 'dreams', 'recurring', 'show', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'Season', 'five', 'also', 'lot', 'shots', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'naked', 'butt', 'various', 'chicks', 'Then', 'are', 'various', 'scenes', 'drag', 'viewer', 'waits', 'something', 'ANYTHING', 'happen', 'example', 'Patty', 'Ellen', 'are', 'stranded', 'Maine', 'airport', 'snowstorm', 'thought', 'something', 'good', 'was', 'gon', 'happen', 'only', '34', 'excitement', '34', 'occurred', 'was', 'when', 'Patty', 'broke', 'liquor', 'cabinet', 'WHOA', 'whole', 'episode', 'practically', 'was', 'devoted', 'two', 'women', 'sitting', 'airport', 'munching', 'crackers', 'vending', 'machine', 'actually', 'even', 'less', 'exciting', ""'m"", 'making', 'be', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'shots', 'paint', 'chipping', 'off', 'walls', 'might', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'seasons', 'were', 'very', 'slow', 'too', 'convoluted', 'What', 'really', 'made', 'show', 'exciting', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'characters', 'also', 'fast-paced', 'movement', 'show-', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'minute', 'season', 'started', 'was', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'see', 'new', 'episode', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'gon', 'happen', 'was', 'exciting', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'hooked', 'Damages', 'beginning', 'EVERYONE', 'loved', 'Sadly', 'good', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end', ""'m"", 'sure', 'dfficult', 'maintain', 'kind', 'stamina', 'year', 'year', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'least', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'debated', 'not', 'purchase', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'beware', 'two', 'final', 'seasons', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'standard', 'set', 'previous', 'three', 'are', 'still', 'better', '95', '%', 'crap', 'tv', 'now', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up.Glenn', 'Close', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'are', 'still', 'amazing', 'roles', 'guest', 'add', 'lot', 'well-', 'John', 'Goodman', 'season', 'four', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'season', 'five', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'failing', 'show', 'said', 'good', 'shows', 'eventually', 'start', 'decline-', 'loved', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'Mad', 'Men', 'as', 'well', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'have', 'just', 'lost', 'luster', 'opinion', 'wish', 'had', 'better', 'news-', 'believe', 'Mad', 'Men', 'am', 'minority', 'when', 'say', 'show', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'fine', ""'m"", 'glad', 'people', 'still', 'shows', 'However', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'not', 'just', 'people', 'are', 'entitled', 'opinions', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'vehemently', 'support', 'show', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'will', 'certainly', 'express', ""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'helpful', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'may', 'be', 'debating', 'watching/purchasing', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'say', 'get', 'off', 'internet', 'Net-', '-flix', 'save', 'money', 'were', 'thinking', 'buying']",Damages: Season 4

1447554,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0058YPPN0,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","By switching from F/X to DirecTV, two things are obvious from the beginning of the 4th season of ""Damages"". First, the production budget is clearly less substantial. Second, the show is no longer bound by network standards, and mostly this is apparent due to an abundance of f-bombs. These elements give the season more of the feel of an independent film, as opposed to a glossy network drama.But the show remains compelling. Mostly this is due to the central characters of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) and Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), the complex and twisted relationship these characters share, and the chemistry between the two actresses that play them. Patty and Ellen's relationship is part mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute;, part mother/daughter, part predator/prey and part just full-on catfight. Patty is a brilliant, manipulative and often vicious woman whose heart beats occasionally. Ellen is a brilliant, mostly well-intended woman who often finds herself capable of more manipulation and viciousness than she thought possible. This yin/yang dynamic drives the series.Almost as important as the two leads are finding compelling actors to play the season's villains, who are usually powerful people caught up in corruption and atrocity and desperately trying to avoid having their secrets come to light. This season offers John Goodman as CEO of a Blackwater-esque private company involved in the war in Afghanistan. After one of their missions goes terribly awry, several of its employees are murdered, and a ruthless mercenary (Dylan Baker, even more terrifying than he was in ""Happiness"") is at the center of it.It seems that some people were unhappy with the show's decision to take on the wars in the Middle East, but I don't see why they would be. It's just as topical as last season's ""Ponzi-scheme-on-a-massive-scale"" case. John Goodman's character is a fascinating study in compartmentalization. The character routinely makes decisions that involve torture, abuse, and murder, but is then able to carry on his roles as father and religious leader without seeming too conflicted. This is believable partly due to John Goodman's performance, but also due to how commonplace such people are.",4,Paradoxes,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2199,"['switching', 'F/X', 'DirecTV', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'obvious', 'beginning', '4th', 'season', 'Damages', 'First', 'production', 'budget', 'clearly', 'less', 'substantial', 'Second', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'bound', 'network', 'standards', 'mostly', 'apparent', 'due', 'abundance', 'f-bombs', 'elements', 'give', 'season', 'more', 'feel', 'independent', 'film', 'opposed', 'glossy', 'network', 'drama.But', 'show', 'compelling', 'Mostly', 'due', 'central', 'characters', 'Patty', 'Hewes', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Ellen', 'Parsons', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'complex', 'twisted', 'relationship', 'characters', 'share', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actresses', 'play', 'Patty', 'Ellen', 'relationship', 'part', 'mentor/prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'part', 'mother/daughter', 'part', 'predator/prey', 'part', 'just', 'full-on', 'catfight', 'Patty', 'brilliant', 'manipulative', 'often', 'vicious', 'woman', 'heart', 'occasionally', 'Ellen', 'brilliant', 'mostly', 'well-intended', 'woman', 'who', 'often', 'capable', 'more', 'manipulation', 'viciousness', 'thought', 'possible', 'yin/yang', 'dynamic', 'series.Almost', 'as', 'important', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'finding', 'compelling', 'actors', 'play', 'season', 'villains', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'powerful', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'corruption', 'atrocity', 'desperately', 'trying', 'avoid', 'having', 'secrets', 'come', 'light', 'season', 'John', 'Goodman', 'CEO', 'Blackwater-esque', 'private', 'company', 'involved', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'one', 'missions', 'terribly', 'awry', 'several', 'employees', 'are', 'murdered', 'ruthless', 'mercenary', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'even', 'more', 'terrifying', 'was', 'Happiness', 'center', 'it.It', 'people', 'were', 'unhappy', 'show', 'decision', 'take', 'wars', 'Middle', 'East', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'topical', 'last', 'season', 'Ponzi-scheme-on-a-massive-scale', 'case', 'John', 'Goodman', 'character', 'fascinating', 'study', 'compartmentalization', 'character', 'routinely', 'decisions', 'involve', 'torture', 'abuse', 'murder', 'then', 'able', 'carry', 'roles', 'father', 'religious', 'leader', 'seeming', 'too', 'conflicted', 'believable', 'partly', 'due', 'John', 'Goodman', 'performance', 'also', 'due', 'how', 'commonplace', 'such', 'people', 'are']",Damages: Season 4
1447555,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B0058YPPN0,Green Manalishi,"[18, 22]","This was one of my favorite shows, along with The Good Wife, The Shield, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and so on, and each season only got better the first three times.  I loved this show.  But Season 4, while certainly entertaining enough to watch, had enough detracting factors to prevent any hearty 5-star rating from this reviewer.  The first was the cast.While John Goodman has never been my favorite actor, he wasn't terrible, but there were other weak links as well.  The story for one, about a CIA rogue who working within the services of a defense contractor in Afghanistan, manages to get a group of American soldiers killed on an 'unauthorized' mission.  The story becomes one of Ellen actually teaming up with Patty Hewes to take these guys on.  Her interest in it revolves around a former male friend from college who was leader of the group that was killed there.  Entirely too much time is spent with that actor (forget his name) and his flashbacks of Afghanistan and his buddies getting killed.  His performance was also just tolerable.  Likewise for the rogue CIA agent that got him embroiled in the mess.  And then there's John Goodman to top it off.  No, the cast, while having big names, were perhaps too familiar to pump a good sense of mystery into the story.  And the story itself and the events that go down were often slightly weak or unplausable, like in the end where the captive boy is allowed to run around free and 'socialize' with the prisoner.  Don't worry, I haven't given anything away.  But those who've seen it should agree that that scene made no sense and was only allowed to be for the sake of plot contrivance. This was not great film-making or HBO style TV in comparison to previous seasons.However, lest I rant too negative, a bad season of Damages is still better than a lot of what else is out there, and I was pulled through the season fairly quickly and without too much groaning for the most part.

Yes, anyone withCheney-like politics who believes in war-for-profit and ""special interrogation"" techniques will not enjoy this season. But the rest of us w/ hearts & minds will enjoy it fully. The weakest part of this series is Chris Messina being mostly locked-up and doing nothing. Maybe the show is on a shoestring budget because the Afghanistan imprisonment scenes didn't even vaguely seem to be set in the Middle East. I was hoping it would turn out that Chris Messina was being held in Erickson's compound in America all the while.The main reason I give Season 4 four stars, and reason to watch this season is Dylan Baker, an actor I'd never heard of. He plays the rogue CIA agent with a mixture of charm, menace, laid-backness, heart & heartlessness. You know if he's hugging someone and crying, he's probably going to kill that person an instant later. He has the '70's Jack Nicholson voice going & acts like your best friend, except he believes in nothing and no one. His complex portrayal even outshines Glenn Close, who sadly, is under-utilized in this season. Of course she's still fantastic, but more limited here. At first I hated John Goodman in this (though I like him as an actor), but he grew on me like a fungus by the end. I hope Season 5 is coming soon.

I have no idea how this change impacted the series (some individuals, myself not included, feel that the series began its decline in Season 3), but this much is clear: Season 4, by far, is the worst season of ""Damages.""

Equal screen time goes to Ellen Parsons (Australian actress Rose Byrne), who, fresh out of law school, joins Hewes's firm and becomes a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of Patty's. It is a world of master-of-the-universe types who, with a phone call or two, can derail a career or end a life. It's conspiracy-heavy and not always plausible, but a top-notch cast playing, for the most part, complex, three-dimensional characters, coupled with a fast pace and non-linear story lines - employing frequent flash-backs and flash-forwards - made the first three seasons entertaining.Season 4, which focuses on a private security company &agrave; la Blackwater USA and an incident involving it and the CIA in Afghanistan, is a failure on nearly every level: neither the characters nor the story is compelling; plausibility is nil; and the production (especially the scenes set in Afghanistan) has a low-budget, backlot feel.Have the writers run out of interesting stories or will the series rebound in Season 5?

I'm very sorry to see it coming to an end.The fourth season continues some of the on-going stories but concentrates mostly on a slimy character excellently protrayed by John Goodman.  What disturbs me, however, (but shouldn't surprise me) is the penchant for Hollywood to always choose a ""right-wing Christian"" character (who isn't a real Christian in any sense of the word) as the antagonist every time they decide to turn from the usual villains (i.e., mean Russian guys, Italian-American gangsters, creepy Arab-type terrorists, etc.)  The writers seem to concentrate so much on stereotyping that the credibility suffers.  Goodman's character, Howard Erickson (CEO of a private security firm participating in subversive actions in Afghanistan) is an unsympathetic, misguided radical while the equally outstanding Dylan Baker (who I think completely stole the show) protrays a mercenary you start out hating but end up almost understanding and identifying with.  Some of it it hard to watch and sometimes reverts to scathing editorializing on the evils of private security firms (did these companies even exist before our armed services were decimated by the government?)  However, it still tells a great story, makes some interesting points along the way, and gives you a lot to think about.That being said, this is an excellent show and, in the end, I'm happy to say that the bad guys usually always have to pay for their crimes and indiscretions.

1447579,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B0058YPPN0,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","After three seasons on basic cable's FX channel, Glenn Close's brilliant legal drama was given a new lease on life when DirectTV picked it up for a fourth season. The ensuing season was not quite as dramatically gripping as earlier ones but still well above the level of most network television.Damages tells the story of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close), a highly successful plaintiff's attorney who specializes in massive class actions against scummy fat cat corporate defendants. Each season, the show focuses on one single major case, but, although it's a legal drama, the show almost never goes inside the courtroom. Instead, we see Hewes and her opponents taking depositions, making settlement offers, and preparing themselves for trials that never actually ensue.Patty Hewes is an antiheroic force of nature, just as ruthless as her corporate adversaries and driven by an almost fanatic will to win. Although she often says she's in this for her clients, in reality, it's her own inner demons (that the show gradually reveals) that drive her. The show's other main character is Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), a younger attorney originally hired as an associate by Patty, but who winds up to a certain extent following in Patty's footsteps. The difference between what Patty does and what Ellen does not always choose to do, as well as the sometimes bitter rivalry/friendship that develops between the two, is the show's dramatic center.In the fourth season, Ellen meets a former high school friend Chris Sanchez (Chris Messina), who is now an Afghan war vet with a bad case of PTSD. Sanchez was most recently employed by Highstar, a Blackwater-like defense contractor. His last mission went badly wrong, killing three members of his squad and leaving him an emotional mess. Ellen is convinced that Highstar was responsible for both Sanchez' condition and the other men's death and brings a lawsuit, but her current firm drops the case and she goes to Patty for help. As the season goes on, both the CEO of Highstar, John Goodman, and a shadowy operative who was involved in their dirty work, Dylan Baker, try to stop the lawsuit.The DirectTV version of Damages has the same high quality writing and ensemble acting as the FX version, but the season is only ten episodes of about 50 minutes each (as opposed to 13 in the first three seasons). The reduced running time means that the story line is somewhat more streamlined, so that there is considerably less of the intricate jumping around in time and place that became the show's trademark. In addition, there are fewer supporting characters and subplots than before. Most viewers will be able to guess the key plot twists well in advance. The show does benefit from being free of basic cable censorship restrictions, with some nudity and a fair amount of profanity (although somewhat less of both than you'd likely see on an HBO series).We don't see as much of Patty's and Ellen's emotional development as we did in former seasons, and Ellen in particular seems willing to cut Patty a lot of emotional slack in her desire to see justice for her clients. Fortunately for viewers, this season offers juicy supporting turns for Goodman and Baker. Goodman's CEO is equal parts right wing patriot, religious zealot, and loving single father to four boys. Baker is genuinely creepy in a role that rivals his recurring guest appearances on The Good Wife.All in all, the fourth season is a welcome addition to the series. Close, Byrne, and the writers are not just going through the motions to milk a few more dollars out of a fading show. Instead, the central story line is as solid as ever, lacking only a little of the glitz and depth, which is primarily a function of the reduced length of the season. Damages is still one of the best television dramas around.",4,New Version of Damages Leaner and Meaner But Almost As Good,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,3805,"['three', 'seasons', 'basic', 'cable', 'FX', 'channel', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'brilliant', 'legal', 'drama', 'was', 'given', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'when', 'DirectTV', 'picked', 'up', 'fourth', 'season', 'ensuing', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'dramatically', 'gripping', 'earlier', 'ones', 'still', 'well', 'level', 'most', 'network', 'television.Damages', 'tells', 'story', 'Patty', 'Hewes', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'highly', 'successful', 'plaintiff', 'attorney', 'who', 'massive', 'class', 'actions', 'scummy', 'fat', 'cat', 'corporate', 'defendants', 'season', 'show', 'one', 'single', 'major', 'case', 'legal', 'drama', 'show', 'almost', 'never', 'courtroom', 'Instead', 'see', 'Hewes', 'opponents', 'taking', 'depositions', 'making', 'settlement', 'offers', 'preparing', 'trials', 'never', 'actually', 'ensue.Patty', 'Hewes', 'antiheroic', 'force', 'nature', 'just', 'as', 'ruthless', 'corporate', 'adversaries', 'driven', 'almost', 'fanatic', 'will', 'win', 'often', 'clients', 'reality', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'show', 'gradually', 'reveals', 'drive', 'show', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Ellen', 'Parsons', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'younger', 'attorney', 'originally', 'hired', 'associate', 'Patty', 'who', 'up', 'certain', 'extent', 'following', 'Patty', 'footsteps', 'difference', 'what', 'Patty', 'what', 'Ellen', 'not', 'always', 'choose', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'sometimes', 'bitter', 'rivalry/friendship', 'two', 'show', 'dramatic', 'center.In', 'fourth', 'season', 'Ellen', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Chris', 'Sanchez', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'who', 'now', 'Afghan', 'war', 'vet', 'bad', 'case', 'PTSD', 'Sanchez', 'was', 'most', 'recently', 'employed', 'Highstar', 'Blackwater-like', 'defense', 'contractor', 'last', 'mission', 'went', 'badly', 'wrong', 'killing', 'three', 'members', 'squad', 'leaving', 'emotional', 'mess', 'Ellen', 'convinced', 'Highstar', 'was', 'responsible', 'Sanchez', 'condition', 'other', 'men', 'death', 'lawsuit', 'current', 'firm', 'case', 'Patty', 'help', 'season', 'CEO', 'Highstar', 'John', 'Goodman', 'shadowy', 'operative', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'dirty', 'work', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'try', 'stop', 'lawsuit.The', 'DirectTV', 'version', 'Damages', 'same', 'high', 'quality', 'writing', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'FX', 'version', 'season', 'only', 'ten', 'episodes', '50', 'minutes', 'opposed', '13', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'reduced', 'running', 'time', 'story', 'line', 'somewhat', 'more', 'streamlined', 'so', 'considerably', 'less', 'intricate', 'jumping', 'time', 'place', 'became', 'show', 'trademark', 'addition', 'are', 'fewer', 'supporting', 'characters', 'subplots', 'before', 'Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'key', 'plot', 'twists', 'well', 'advance', 'show', 'benefit', 'being', 'free', 'basic', 'cable', 'censorship', 'restrictions', 'nudity', 'fair', 'amount', 'profanity', 'somewhat', 'less', ""'d"", 'likely', 'see', 'HBO', 'series', '.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'Patty', 'Ellen', 'emotional', 'development', 'did', 'former', 'seasons', 'Ellen', 'particular', 'willing', 'cut', 'Patty', 'lot', 'emotional', 'slack', 'desire', 'see', 'justice', 'clients', 'Fortunately', 'viewers', 'season', 'juicy', 'supporting', 'turns', 'Goodman', 'Baker', 'Goodman', 'CEO', 'equal', 'parts', 'right', 'wing', 'patriot', 'religious', 'zealot', 'loving', 'single', 'father', 'four', 'boys', 'Baker', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'role', 'recurring', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Good', 'Wife.All', 'fourth', 'season', 'welcome', 'addition', 'series', 'Close', 'Byrne', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'milk', 'few', 'more', 'dollars', 'fading', 'show', 'Instead', 'central', 'story', 'line', 'as', 'solid', 'ever', 'lacking', 'only', 'little', 'glitz', 'depth', 'primarily', 'function', 'reduced', 'length', 'season', 'Damages', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'dramas']",Damages: Season 4
