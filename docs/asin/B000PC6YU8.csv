My instinct when I see she's come out with something new is to scoop it up quickly. This video, however, was a bit disappointing. It'd make a great workshop, as the moves are designed to celebrate and make you feel good about your body, and I feel like that'd be even more powerful in a group setting. The moves are even kind of fun to do. However, they mostly entail writhing around on the floor, and while it was somewhat relaxing, I didn't get much of a workout out of it. I was hoping that I could do some sensual dance, not take myself too seriously, but also get in my exercise for the day. Not so. There's a bunch of instruction in here about working your gaze, and then most of the rest is learning to move slowly and deliberately, in a flowing way. I must say, had I made up a sensual dance by myself, it would have included all of these elements :) There wasn't anything surprising about the routine.I love watching Hemalayaa (she really is beautiful), but even the bonus dance routine she did was a little tedious.

I understood that it was a slow dance, but just a little faster build might be better.I did enjoy the DVD, though, and several times found I had a small smile on my face.

Hemalayaa leads a simple and very sensual practice, most of which is done on the floor (always a good thing for me!).  She encourages the viewer to think of a beloved one--either a lover, a friend, or a god/dess--and to devote the practice to your beloved.The movements are very slow.  It feels like a luxurious stretch but when you watch Hemalayaa do it you quickly realize just how sexy a stretch can be, especially when it is done very slowly.  It would be easy to dismiss some of the instructions as silly (look coyly at your love, offer flowers from the heart) but in the context of the video these all sound like lovely and loving suggestions.  I was able to easily follow along, for the most part, until the practice moved to a standing one.  Moving from a sitting to a standing movement was a challenge for me and would probably be difficult for people with hip or knee problems.But this is a ""dance"" and moving with your own body is what this workout is all about.  You won't be dripping sweat.  This isn't hard cardio.  Think more a dancing yoga practice meant to awaken your inner seductress.  Anyone who is uncomfortable in her own body will surely become more confident watching and practicing along with this dvd.  I would imagine that even the most clumsy woman will find herself moving in ways that feel sexy and the body learns and listens from repetition.  Muscle memory will be there when you want to feel sexy and you may find yourself moving in ways that before you would have felt either uncomfortable doing or unattractive in attempting.What is most remarkable is that throughout it all I didn't catch myself thinking, ""Of course she looks sexy doing that--look at her.""  Instead, I just allowed myself to follow along, enjoy the experience, and  follow along with Hemalayaa's gentle lead.  My only disappointment in this whole practice is that she didn't suggest at the beginning the object of love for whom the viewer is doing this dance could be the self.  At the end she does say something about loving the self and that love begins with loving one's self.  I hope more people watching and doing this dvd will dedicate their practice to themselves.  I think that would be a great blessing.",4,A Sensual Practice That Luxuriously Stretches the Body and Spirit,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,2302,"['dvd', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Flawed', 'bit', 'instruction', 'mostly', 'pleasure', 'Hemalayaa', 'simple', 'very', 'sensual', 'practice', 'most', 'done', 'floor', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'viewer', 'think', 'beloved', 'one', 'lover', 'friend', 'god/dess', 'devote', 'practice', 'beloved.The', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'slow', 'luxurious', 'stretch', 'when', 'watch', 'Hemalayaa', 'do', 'quickly', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'sexy', 'stretch', 'can', 'be', 'especially', 'when', 'done', 'very', 'slowly', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'instructions', 'silly', 'look', 'coyly', 'love', 'offer', 'flowers', 'heart', 'context', 'video', 'sound', 'lovely', 'loving', 'suggestions', 'was', 'able', 'easily', 'follow', 'along', 'most', 'part', 'practice', 'moved', 'standing', 'one', 'Moving', 'sitting', 'standing', 'movement', 'was', 'challenge', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'difficult', 'people', 'hip', 'knee', 'problems.But', 'dance', 'moving', 'own', 'body', 'what', 'workout', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dripping', 'sweat', ""n't"", 'hard', 'cardio', 'Think', 'more', 'dancing', 'yoga', 'practice', 'meant', 'awaken', 'inner', 'seductress', 'Anyone', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'own', 'body', 'will', 'surely', 'become', 'more', 'confident', 'watching', 'practicing', 'along', 'dvd', 'would', 'imagine', 'even', 'most', 'clumsy', 'woman', 'will', 'find', 'moving', 'ways', 'feel', 'sexy', 'body', 'repetition', 'Muscle', 'memory', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'want', 'feel', 'sexy', 'may', 'find', 'moving', 'ways', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'doing', 'unattractive', 'most', 'remarkable', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'thinking', 'course', 'sexy', 'doing', 'look', 'Instead', 'just', 'allowed', 'follow', 'along', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'follow', 'along', 'Hemalayaa', 'gentle', 'lead', 'only', 'disappointment', 'whole', 'practice', 'did', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'beginning', 'object', 'love', 'whom', 'viewer', 'doing', 'dance', 'could', 'be', 'self', 'end', 'say', 'something', 'loving', 'self', 'love', 'loving', 'one', 'self', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'watching', 'doing', 'dvd', 'will', 'dedicate', 'practice', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'blessing']",Dance of the Kama Sutra With Hemalayaa
