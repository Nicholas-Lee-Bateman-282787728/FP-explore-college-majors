130603,A9998RE3AEA95,0792160746,Alex,"[5, 17]","For one and a half hours ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" forced me to watch people I did not care to know, doing things I did not want to see done, in ways I could neither condone nor enjoy. In saying this I in no way imply that Hank/Henrietta is a bad character; given proper focus and more camera time, s/he could have carried the movie on his/her shoulders. No, the film receives two stars from me because it is populated by miserable, deplorable caricatures, first and foremost of them being Sebastian  Cole himself.I simply could not accept teen-age Sebastian as a character. He seems to be devoid of all thought. His gaze is empty, without sentience, his doe eyes having a continual expression of a deer caught in the headlights. ""I've thought about it, and I'm sure you have very good reasons,"" he informs his trans-sexual stepfather Hank in the end, after many tribulations and conflicts, but what leads to those heartfelt words? Why is Sebastian saying this after spending the entire movie keeping a safe distance from Hank? Where's the evidence of mentation, of actual thought? Perhaps this is the director's perception of teens - but not mine. I've known divorce, dissolute parents and step-parents, a lot of moving, but I've never felt like Sebastian nor seen anybody even remotely like him.I cannot understand the movie's reluctance to focus on any worthwhile character. We see Sebastian's friends oggling girls through binoculars, talking crudely and pejoratively about Hank's decision, driving aimlessly around the countryside... now, I've never been to Dutchess County, so perhaps it is true tht there is indeed nohing of interest there; however, I'm sure there are ROADS that lead OUT of it, to places that are more interesting. Watching caricatures in dead-end situations is torture.There are beginnings of a better movie hiding within the dregs. ""The Adventures"" could have focused more on Hank/Henrietta, who is an exquisitely promising character, touching, caring, thought-provoking, and wonderfully acted. Sadly, we are offered frustratingly little insight into Hank's thoughts and motivations.This film is glum and depressing; worse, it offers no escape from that depression, no suggestion that there can be better times and places. Could've been better, but alas.",2,Beginnings of a better movie hiding within a dull wreck.,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,2290,"['one', 'half', 'hours', 'Adventures', 'Sebastian', 'Cole', 'forced', 'watch', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'know', 'doing', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'done', 'ways', 'could', 'neither', 'condone', 'enjoy', 'saying', 'way', 'Hank/Henrietta', 'bad', 'character', 'given', 'proper', 'focus', 'more', 'camera', 'time', 's/he', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'movie', 'his/her', 'shoulders', 'No', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'populated', 'miserable', 'deplorable', 'caricatures', 'first', 'foremost', 'being', 'Sebastian', 'Cole', 'himself.I', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'teen-age', 'Sebastian', 'character', 'be', 'devoid', 'thought', 'gaze', 'empty', 'sentience', 'doe', 'eyes', 'having', 'continual', 'expression', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', ""'ve"", 'thought', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'reasons', 'trans-sexual', 'stepfather', 'Hank', 'end', 'many', 'tribulations', 'conflicts', 'what', 'heartfelt', 'words', 'Why', 'Sebastian', 'saying', 'spending', 'entire', 'movie', 'keeping', 'safe', 'distance', 'Hank', 'Where', 'evidence', 'mentation', 'actual', 'thought', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'perception', 'teens', 'not', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'known', 'divorce', 'dissolute', 'parents', 'step-parents', 'lot', 'moving', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'Sebastian', 'seen', 'anybody', 'even', 'remotely', 'him.I', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'movie', 'reluctance', 'focus', 'worthwhile', 'character', 'see', 'Sebastian', 'friends', 'oggling', 'girls', 'binoculars', 'talking', 'crudely', 'pejoratively', 'Hank', 'decision', 'driving', 'aimlessly', 'countryside', 'now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Dutchess', 'County', 'so', 'perhaps', 'true', 'tht', 'indeed', 'nohing', 'interest', 'however', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'ROADS', 'lead', 'OUT', 'places', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'Watching', 'caricatures', 'dead-end', 'situations', 'are', 'beginnings', 'better', 'movie', 'hiding', 'dregs', 'Adventures', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'Hank/Henrietta', 'who', 'exquisitely', 'promising', 'character', 'touching', 'caring', 'thought-provoking', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Sadly', 'are', 'offered', 'frustratingly', 'little', 'insight', 'Hank', 'thoughts', 'motivations.This', 'film', 'glum', 'depressing', 'worse', 'escape', 'depression', 'suggestion', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'times', 'places', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'alas']",N/A

It's such a good story, different, quite a diversion from the typical teen movies that are out there lately.  It is funny, heartwarming, and at times, serious.The film brings us back to 1983 - 84, and Sebastian Cole, played superbly by Adrian Grenier, wants to go on adventures.  He also wants to get out of school as soon as possible.  All the while, his stepfather decides he wants to become a woman, Sebastian's sister leaves and moves to California, and his mom leaves when she finds out her husband wants to be a woman.It is a little different and offbeat, but that is what makes this movie so unique.  The acting by Clark Gregg,who plays Hank/Henrietta is outstanding!  I've never seen him act before but I thought he played his characters with such great sensitivity and realness.  The performances by both him and Grenier, who I did see in Drive me Crazy, are truly beautiful and you can't help but fall in love with their characters.Sebastian is a great person who just wants to be good to others and along the way have what he calls 'his adventures'.You will have to watch to see what these adventures actually consist of.  You won't be disappointed.The soundtrack is great too.  Perfect compliment to an 80s' kind of film.",5,I love this movie!!,1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,1324,"['discovered', 'Sebastian', 'Cole', 'Sundance', 'channel', 'have', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'such', 'good', 'story', 'different', 'quite', 'diversion', 'typical', 'teen', 'movies', 'are', 'there', 'lately', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'times', 'serious.The', 'film', 'back', '1983', '84', 'Sebastian', 'Cole', 'played', 'superbly', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'go', 'adventures', 'also', 'get', 'school', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'while', 'stepfather', 'become', 'woman', 'Sebastian', 'sister', 'leaves', 'moves', 'California', 'mom', 'when', 'out', 'husband', 'be', 'woman.It', 'little', 'different', 'offbeat', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'unique', 'acting', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'who', 'Hank/Henrietta', 'outstanding', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'act', 'thought', 'played', 'characters', 'such', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'realness', 'performances', 'Grenier', 'who', 'did', 'see', 'Drive', 'Crazy', 'are', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'characters.Sebastian', 'great', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'others', 'way', 'have', 'what', ""adventures'.You"", 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'adventures', 'actually', 'consist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'too', 'Perfect', 'compliment', '80s', 'kind', 'film']",N/A

Hencke ""m hencke""","[3, 3]","I rented this film because I recently saw ""The Door In The Floor"" (which is one of my favorite films of 2004) also directed by Tod Williams.  Having seen this film (his debut) I am extremely impressed with his talents as a writer and director.  I just love these characters (in both films).  The feeling I had with this film and ""The Door In The Floor"" is I really didn't want either one of them to end.  They could have gone on forever.  Its rare for a film to leave you with that feeling...Let alone two films by the same writer/director.  Williams is definitely a director to keep an eye on.  And any film that ends with a Pixies song is always tops in my book.  I am not a fan of the show Entourage but Adrian Grenier really blew me away with his performance in this touching and underrated indie film.

130608,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,0792160746,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[0, 0]","I expected a boring coming-of-age film, after reading the few negative reviews. Imagine my surprise when I started watching, and in no time at all, was caught up in the adventures of one, Sebastian Cole. It's a unique character, with an insight into human nature that is unusual for a young kid. Sure, he's been subjected to a lot of phony stuff, and feels like he only wants to be a kid. His resilience as a thinking person belies the idiot behavior of his peers, as well as his family. He's simply a guy who is ready to discover himself.The clever script by first-time writer/director Tod Williams has been criticized by many as having too many holes. It's exactly these ""holes"" that Sebastian is trying to fill. As Sebastian, Adrien Grenier totally buys in to all of the complications and craziness that is all around him. He succeeds on many levels, and I wasn't disappointed.To blab away the plot would be unkind to those who may read this without having seen the film. Early in the film, it's explained that his step-father Hank wants to become Henrietta (that's not giving away too much). Putting things in perspective, Sebastian comes to terms.Clark Gregg (Iron Man, The Avengers), in a difficult role, is entirely successful in his transition as Hank/Henrietta. It's a very fine performance, displaying love and concern, without going too much into the personal frustration of his/her very complicated mind-set.There's wonderful stuff going on all the time. I really enjoyed it a lot, and as someone who was totally apprehensive of what to expect, I'm glad my mind is still open enough to ignore previous comments regarding this very fine Indie achievement. All of the characters are well-realized.Certainly, Indie production values might've been better, but I challenge anyone to do a better script which excels in it's sheer simplicity, to show a smart and confused kid coming to terms with life, as we know it.The film was recognized by Sundance and the Indie Spirits awards. It only made $100K in theaters. It has since attained cult status, and I hope a lot of people see this film. Also, the sweet appearance of Levon Helm at the end is a treat.",5,I read the negative reviews.
