I started watching Degrassi again totally by accident and this is among my all time favorite episodes along with Time Stands Still. This episode centers on the opening of a Kevin Smith movie and the relationship that comes out of that night between Paige and Alex along with the reaction of some classmates. I thought this episode was well done and Lauren Collins and the girl playing Alex did a great job.,5,One of the best episodes.,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,547,"['remember', 'watching', 'Degrassi', 'Jr', 'High', 'back', '1980', 'High', 'School', 'student', 'liking', 'show', 'then', 'being', 'when', 'disappeared', 'TV', 'started', 'watching', 'Degrassi', 'again', 'totally', 'accident', 'time', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Time', 'Stands', 'Still', 'episode', 'centers', 'opening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie', 'relationship', 'night', 'Paige', 'Alex', 'reaction', 'classmates', 'thought', 'episode', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Lauren', 'Collins', 'girl', 'playing', 'Alex', 'did', 'great', 'job']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 5"

Season 5 is an exciting one that ends with the shows first graduation. The season starts with the character of Manny pursuing her acting career. Things go awry when she hooks up with the new kid at school Peter. Peter candidly catches her on video and shares his home movie with the majority of the school much to Manny's dismay and she finds herself kicked off of the spirit squad. Paige is preparing for college, Banting is the university of her choice. She also finds that maybe her and her brother Dylan may have more in common than she realizes when she pursues a relationship with her female friend Alex. Marco's and Dylan are still broken up, but before the season's end Marco realizes he still has feelings for Dylan. Jimmy is still at Degrassi, trying to find his way in life after the school shooting left him paralyzed. He isn't so sure that basketball is for him anymore and spends much of his time working on his art work.Much of the fifth season includes a newly introduced group on campus named the Friendship Club. Friendship Club is a faith based organization that Spinner turns to after being shunned by his friends due to his involvement with the school shooting. He soon finds love with Darcy. There is one surprising departure during the fifth season. The character of Craig Manning decides to leave Degrassi to pursue his music career.The fifth season of Degrassi the Next Generation is one for fans of the show who need to complete their collection of the series on DVD. The two biggest storylines of the season include Liberty's pregnancy and Emma's eating disorder. It's a good season of the show and one fan's of the series will enjoy owning on DVD. The four disc series includes all of the episodes from the show's fifth season and a bonus DVD filled with extras.

1057048,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,B000NIVNSW,Geneva,"[7, 7]","In my opinion, this is the best (and most dramatic) season of Degrassi yet, filled with everything you can possibly think of that a teenager might experience during their high school years. (I was a senior in high school when this season originally premiered so I know what I'm talking about!)Season 5 starts off with the introduction of newcomer Peter (the principals son by the way) whom Emma has a desperate crush on, only to later find out that he wants Manny, her best friend. Manny is desperate to pursue a career in acting, and, after getting some pretty harsh criticism from a casting agent, decides to go so far as to get plastic surgery, much to the dismay of her very strict father, who refuses to let her become an actress and throws her out of the house after calling her a slut. A very upset Manny then goes to a party that Peter invited her to, gets drunk, and allows Peter to film her taking her top off. Manny begs Peter to delete the footage, but when she calls him a freak and refuses to date him, he emails the video to everyone at school, angering not only Emma, who is horrified that Manny did such a thing with the guy she likes, but also Paige who is disgusted by Mannys behavior and immediately throws her off the squad.  A distraught Manny begs Emma for forgiveness, and ends up moving in with her. She also begins dating Craig again, who is on his way to becoming a serious musician.Now onto the other characters.Liberty reveals to JT that she is pregnant, and they both eventually agree to keep the baby, and plan on moving out together. In order to move out, JT picks up more shifts at the Pharmacy he works at, but when he realizes that he won't be able to support Liberty and the baby with the amount of money he's making, he begins dealing drugs and when Liberty finds out what's he's been up to, she breaks up with him. Around that time, Libertys parents urge her to give the baby up for adoption once its born, and she agrees. Devastated by the news and by the break-up, JT overdoses on painkillers and lands in the hospital.Meanwhile a friendless Spinner, who is still dealing with his guilt over the shooting (from season 4) meets good girl Darcy, who is part of friendship club, and after they start dating, Spinner vows to become a born again virgin (yeah right!)Paige, who is stressing over getting into the college of her dreams, and is still dealing with her breakup with Matt, begins experimenting with her sexuality and is soon dating bad girl Alex.Jimmy is dealing with being crippled and is trying to find out who he is when he realizes that he's no longer the basketball star he once was.Emma begins to develop feelings for Peter yet again, who feels the same way about her, but is desperate to keep her feelings a secret from a still-very-angry-at-Peter Manny. During a school play, Emma and Peter sneak off for a makeout session...only to find her stepfather (aka Snake) and the school principal (aka Peters mom) kissing. A devastated Emma tells her mom, who kicks Snake out of the house, thus leading to Emmas bout with Anorexia. During this time, Manny becomes angry with Emmas change in behavior, which angers Emma, who eventually confesses that she's been dating Peter. All of this leads to Emma having a serious panick attack, which lands her in the hospital.....etc. I guess now you get the point when I say its a very dramatic =) and definitely a must see!",5,"drama, drama, drama!",1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,3411,"['opinion', 'best', 'most', 'dramatic', 'season', 'Degrassi', 'yet', 'filled', 'everything', 'can', 'possibly', 'think', 'teenager', 'might', 'experience', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'was', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'season', 'originally', 'premiered', 'so', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Season', '5', 'starts', 'introduction', 'newcomer', 'Peter', 'principals', 'son', 'way', 'whom', 'Emma', 'desperate', 'crush', 'only', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Manny', 'best', 'friend', 'Manny', 'desperate', 'pursue', 'career', 'acting', 'getting', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'casting', 'agent', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'get', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'much', 'dismay', 'very', 'strict', 'father', 'who', 'let', 'become', 'actress', 'out', 'house', 'calling', 'slut', 'very', 'upset', 'Manny', 'then', 'party', 'Peter', 'invited', 'drunk', 'Peter', 'film', 'taking', 'top', 'off', 'Manny', 'Peter', 'delete', 'footage', 'when', 'freak', 'date', 'video', 'everyone', 'school', 'angering', 'not', 'only', 'Emma', 'who', 'horrified', 'Manny', 'did', 'thing', 'guy', 'also', 'Paige', 'who', 'disgusted', 'Mannys', 'behavior', 'immediately', 'off', 'squad', 'distraught', 'Manny', 'begs', 'Emma', 'forgiveness', 'up', 'moving', 'her', 'also', 'dating', 'Craig', 'again', 'who', 'way', 'becoming', 'serious', 'musician.Now', 'other', 'characters.Liberty', 'reveals', 'JT', 'pregnant', 'eventually', 'agree', 'keep', 'baby', 'plan', 'moving', 'out', 'together', 'order', 'move', 'out', 'JT', 'up', 'more', 'shifts', 'Pharmacy', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'support', 'Liberty', 'baby', 'amount', 'money', 'making', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'when', 'Liberty', 'out', 'what', 'been', 'up', 'up', 'time', 'Libertys', 'urge', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'once', 'born', 'Devastated', 'news', 'break-up', 'JT', 'painkillers', 'lands', 'hospital.Meanwhile', 'friendless', 'Spinner', 'who', 'still', 'dealing', 'guilt', 'shooting', 'season', '4', 'meets', 'good', 'girl', 'Darcy', 'who', 'part', 'friendship', 'club', 'start', 'dating', 'Spinner', 'become', 'born', 'again', 'virgin', 'yeah', 'right', 'Paige', 'who', 'stressing', 'getting', 'college', 'dreams', 'still', 'dealing', 'breakup', 'Matt', 'experimenting', 'sexuality', 'soon', 'dating', 'bad', 'girl', 'Alex.Jimmy', 'dealing', 'being', 'crippled', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'basketball', 'star', 'once', 'was.Emma', 'begins', 'develop', 'feelings', 'Peter', 'yet', 'again', 'who', 'same', 'way', 'desperate', 'keep', 'feelings', 'secret', 'still-very-angry-at-Peter', 'Manny', 'school', 'play', 'Emma', 'Peter', 'sneak', 'off', 'makeout', 'session', 'only', 'find', 'stepfather', 'aka', 'Snake', 'school', 'principal', 'aka', 'Peters', 'mom', 'kissing', 'devastated', 'Emma', 'mom', 'who', 'Snake', 'house', 'thus', 'leading', 'Emmas', 'bout', 'Anorexia', 'time', 'Manny', 'angry', 'Emmas', 'change', 'behavior', 'Emma', 'who', 'eventually', 'been', 'dating', 'Peter', 'Emma', 'having', 'serious', 'panick', 'attack', 'hospital', '..etc', 'guess', 'now', 'get', 'point', 'when', 'say', 'very', 'dramatic', '=', 'definitely', 'must', 'see']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 5"

It's filmed in Canada, so there does not appear to be much in the way of censorship.  That said, they cover the topics without nudity, without profanity, but they do get the point across.

Plus the development of characters we rarely got much of through the early years like Alex and Liberty. Paige goes through break ups, exploring her sexuality with a close friend, and a short hook up with an old beau.  Liberty is not the perfect, nerdy kid anymore as she becomes pregnant by her boyfriend JT.  JT also battles the upcoming pressures of becoming a teen dad.  Manny wants to be famous, but has a Girls Gone Wild moment that is all over the school.  But her on again-off again boyfriend Craig Manning comes back into the picture as they finally have a relationship.  Spinner also goes from being a bad boy to connecting with the Jesus.  We're introduced to three new characters Peter, Derek, and Danny.My favorite moments through this season was Manny's drunkeness, the Paige and Alex relationship, and the JT and Liberty baby drama.As for the extra disk, I was a bit disappoint at what I got for my money.  I'm very accustomed to commentaries that wasn't featured in this season.  Also the blooper reel and deleted scenes was a little boring.  Yet, maybe, if they would had added the minisodes the fourth disk would had been a big upgrade and worth the watch.Nevertheless, don't buy the disk just for the extras.

1057052,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000NIVNSW,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 3]","Cons: Jimmy and Hazel have now broken up, but not only did they break up, Jimmy was too lazy to even bother trying to fix it. My complaint about Season 4 with us not knowing much about Hazel has increased in Season 5. Again, I don't even understand why the writers put those two together. They should've just made them friends. Although there were two whole episodes where Hazel acknowledged that she was being ignored by Jimmy, soon after they broke up over a painting. A painting?! If this wasn't goofy enough, then Jimmy later says in one of the last episodes that chicks don't dig guys in wheelchairs. Um, Jimmy, you had a girlfriend before the shooting, while you were in the hospital, and when you got out of the hospital. Matter of fact, your girlfriend tried her hardest to keep you around. His problem with women isn't about the wheelchair that he keeps reminding people he's in; it's the writers who felt like Hazel wasn't worth writing about. Meanwhile we get to hear a lot more about Emma and Paige. Emma is still melodramatic and annoying, and now she's decided to be anorexic, too, and in true Emma style, she tries to drag Manny down with her. And now Paige is a lesbian. When Marco came out, it made sense. With Paige, it seems like a scream for new viewers, and I'm not buying it. Then the way she ended the show just screamed out, ""More people watch this show please. This is something you'll never expect."" Yup, I expected everything that happened.If not for wanting to follow the storyline, I'd fast forward straight past all the grown-ups' situations. I'm not interested in any of their stories. It's the same story we've heard again and again. Someone cheated.Pros: Jimmy's father is gorgeous. Period. Now HIM I like seeing every single time he comes across the screen. I'm a little confused about why his mother is never around. (Did I miss something? Is she dead?) Even Liberty's parents are cool. I think it's interesting when the parents show up to lend themselves to a situation with the children, but the adults' situation in addition to the kids is overkill. If we're talking about Degrassi High, why not keep the focus on the high school and junior high students? I think they got it right with the way Liberty's parents and Jimmy's father played out. Manny's father is a bit rough, but even her parents showed up just enough to keep the story going. As far as J.T. and Liberty, I NEVER saw that one coming. Her story was interesting mainly because everything I guessed would happen didn't. We'll see if my guesses are right in Season 6. As far as Spinner, he's entertaining 100% of the time. Watching him at that Christian camp made me fall out laughing, and his troublesome friend is THE WORST (in the best way). Although disappointed in a decision J.T. made, that was another one I didn't see coming. I like that kid.My favorite characters are (in this particular order): Jimmy, Spinner, Craig, J.T., Hazel (only because of Season 3 ""Take on Me"" when we FINALLY got to see her outside of Paige's shadow and realized she's far more interesting than she's given credit for), Ellie, Liberty, Darcy, Marco and Manny.
