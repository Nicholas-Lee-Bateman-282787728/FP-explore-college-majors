916296,A3SBCBEN4NGK5I,B0009XRZOW,B-Movie Fan,"[1, 2]","When you decide whether or not to buy this movie, keep in mind what it is and what it isn't.  This is a low to no budget ""home-made"" movie.  It is long on effort and ""genre"" jokes, but short on money, production values, and professional actors.If you can let yourself ""go with the flow"" and enjoy watching two amateurs have a lot of fun making their first film, it is very enjoyable.  (Probably even more so if you have ever lived in the south; some of the jokes are fairly regional.)  If you have to have high production values and a ""professional feel"" to your movies, you need to avoid this like the plague.  Go watch the big budget remake of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead.""  It doesn't have half the heart of this movie, but it has big name actors and a slick big budget feel.Now, if you do decide to get this movie . . . (spoilers) . . . a small town in rural Alabama experiences UFO activity (which is mostly just an excuse for the zombies and some ""abductee jokes"") and then comes under attack from a siege of zombies.  Our protagonist runs the local video rental store and engages in some memorable ""fan boy"" dialogue over what a zombie is and isn't.  The Zombies eat people and you have to shoot them in the head to stop them.  Except for the UFOs not too much different from every second Zombie movie you've ever seen.  Except, that this one doesn't take itself too seriously and invites you to laugh along with the creators while you watch.  Not for everyone, but a treat for people who like this kind of movie.  Unlike most b-movies, this one is kind of fun to watch with the director's commentary turned on.

916297,AT2L9P49VHVY5,B0009XRZOW,Christopher R,"[0, 0]","I expected this to be a really cheesy movie, but I ended up being surprised.  No, the effects are not that good.  No, the editing is not that good.  No, nothing about the cinematography is that good.  But there is plenty to like about this movie.You can tell the actors aren't really trained in their craft, but they must be from the South because the way they speak and their reactions to certain events are predictably Southern.  Example?  When a TV station interrupts the Auburn vs. Alabama game to call into the small town police station to find out what is going on with the zombies, the guy who answers the phone reacts the same way any Southerner would:  ""Put the game back on!""In another part the father has to leave his home, so he briefs his teenage daughter on what to do if someone breaks into the house:  Two in the chest, one in the head.  That little girl ends up making her front yard look like a battlefield.  She can shoot, I tell you what.So in the end, this is a really cheesy movie.  The thing is, though, that it is good because it is cheesy.  This is what would happen if the zombie apocalypse came to a small Southern town.

The corny dialogue, awful special effects and rambling plot all combine to make a film you'll watch again and again just to laugh at how awful it is.The ""plot"" goes something like this: zombies arise just outside a small Alabama town, possibly as a result of UFO activity in the area.  They first assault a minister of a small church, an owner of a video store, and unwary members of the local gun club.  They then spread throughout the community, wreaking havoc while the townspeople go about their daily activities.One poignant scene shows a grocery store remaining open during the attack.  The manager announces  ""attention shoppers: the bag boy reports that the parking lot is now zombie-free.""Other surreal scenes involve s lunch stop at a BBQ place which has been taken over by the undead.

916305,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009XRZOW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","We are clearly in a renaissance period when it comes to zombie comedies.  Most people know about ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and there is my personal favorite, ""Dead and Breakfast,"" as well as ""Bubba Ho-Tep.""  Here we have another effort in a similar vein, ""Hide & Creep,"" that comes to us from writer Chance Shirley and his co-director Chuck Hartsell.  They take a short called ""Birthday Call"" (included on the DVD) and expand it by actually getting to see the zombies, tossing in a flying saucer and a government agent from Homeland Security, and adding insult to injury by having the crisis pre-empt the big SEC football game on the television.Thorsby is a small Southern town, home of the 1A State Powerlifting Champions in 2001 and 2002.  Over at Chuck's Super Video Store, Chuck (Chuck Hartsell) is surprised to notice that he is suddenly all out of zombie movies.  So when he ends up killing somebody who appears to be a zombie, he starts putting things together, using his encyclopedic knowledge of cinematic zombies (for example, he knows that ""Evil Dead 2"" was not about zombies but Candarian demons that possessed the living).  Meanwhile, Michael (Michael Shelton) wake up in a tree in the middle of the forest missing his clothes, his girlfriend, and, most importantly, his '64 Mustang.  The only obvious explanation would be that he was abducted by aliens, and given what else is happening in the movie, that seems reasonable enough of an explanation.Then there are Keith (Kyle Holman) and Lee (also played by Shleton), members of the Thorsby Gun Club, who head off to find out why satellite reception of the big football game has gone out and run into the walking undead, while over at the church Reverend Smith (Barry Austin) is fighting off a zombie attack.  Everybody ends up fighting the zombies, but only a few get to be at local bar for the zombie lesbians scene (or would it be lesbian zombies scene?).  So, that pretty much sums up everything you need to know about this movie to make your decision on whether or not to check it out.  Something like that just has to be a deal maker or deal breaker, because there just cannot be any fence sitting when it comes to zombie lesbians/lesbian zombies.I have seen enough zombie comedies to know that they are an acquired taste.  After all, you really have to be familiar with the likes of George A. Romero's zombie movies and able to stomach that sort of human carnage to be able to laugh at films such as ""Hide & Creep.""  My particular wave length is aligned perfectly with ""Dead and Breakfast,"" so I was not completely attuned to ""Hide & Creep.""  But there was enough laughs to say that you are looking for another zombie comedy, this one is worth checking out.  Still, I freely admit that in the end I rounded up on this one because of the zombie lesbians.  True, this movie does not have as many zombie lesbian scenes as most people would like to see (there is just the one), but that is true of any movie you can name from ""Citizen Kane"" to almost every version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" that you can name.",4,A Southern fried zombie comedy,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,3067,"['are', 'clearly', 'renaissance', 'period', 'when', 'zombie', 'comedies', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Dead', 'Breakfast', 'as', 'well', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'Here', 'have', 'effort', 'similar', 'vein', 'Hide', 'Creep', 'writer', 'Chance', 'Shirley', 'co-director', 'Chuck', 'Hartsell', 'take', 'short', 'called', 'Birthday', 'Call', 'included', 'DVD', 'expand', 'actually', 'getting', 'see', 'zombies', 'tossing', 'flying', 'saucer', 'government', 'agent', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'having', 'crisis', 'pre-empt', 'big', 'SEC', 'football', 'game', 'television.Thorsby', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'home', '1A', 'State', 'Powerlifting', 'Champions', '2001', '2002', 'Chuck', 'Super', 'Video', 'Store', 'Chuck', 'Chuck', 'Hartsell', 'surprised', 'notice', 'suddenly', 'zombie', 'movies', 'So', 'when', 'up', 'killing', 'somebody', 'who', 'be', 'zombie', 'putting', 'things', 'together', 'using', 'encyclopedic', 'knowledge', 'cinematic', 'zombies', 'example', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'was', 'not', 'zombies', 'Candarian', 'demons', 'possessed', 'living', 'Meanwhile', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'Shelton', 'wake', 'up', 'tree', 'middle', 'forest', 'missing', 'clothes', 'girlfriend', 'most', 'importantly', 'Mustang', 'only', 'obvious', 'explanation', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'given', 'what', 'else', 'happening', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'enough', 'explanation.Then', 'are', 'Keith', 'Kyle', 'Holman', 'Lee', 'also', 'played', 'Shleton', 'members', 'Thorsby', 'Gun', 'Club', 'who', 'head', 'off', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'satellite', 'reception', 'big', 'football', 'game', 'gone', 'out', 'run', 'walking', 'undead', 'church', 'Reverend', 'Smith', 'Barry', 'Austin', 'fighting', 'off', 'zombie', 'attack', 'Everybody', 'up', 'fighting', 'zombies', 'only', 'few', 'get', 'be', 'local', 'bar', 'zombie', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'lesbian', 'zombies', 'scene', 'So', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'movie', 'make', 'decision', 'not', 'check', 'out', 'Something', 'just', 'be', 'deal', 'maker', 'deal', 'breaker', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fence', 'sitting', 'when', 'zombie', 'lesbians/lesbian', 'zombies.I', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'zombie', 'comedies', 'know', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'familiar', 'likes', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movies', 'able', 'stomach', 'sort', 'human', 'carnage', 'be', 'able', 'laugh', 'films', 'such', 'Hide', 'Creep', 'particular', 'wave', 'length', 'aligned', 'perfectly', 'Dead', 'Breakfast', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'attuned', 'Hide', 'Creep', 'was', 'enough', 'laughs', 'say', 'are', 'looking', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'one', 'checking', 'out', 'Still', 'freely', 'admit', 'end', 'rounded', 'up', 'one', 'zombie', 'True', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'zombie', 'lesbian', 'scenes', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'just', 'one', 'true', 'movie', 'can', 'name', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'almost', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'can', 'name']",Hide & Creep

916314,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0009XRZOW,trebe,"[0, 0]","Hide And Creep (2005) is an extremely low budget horror/comedy, set in the small rural town of Thorsby, Alabama, where a zombie outbreak has occurred.  The unfocused and meandering plot that follows the adventures of some of the residents, is apparently intended mostly to generate a few laughs, as the film isn't at all scary.  Anyone looking for genuine suspense will be severely disappointed by this rather amateurish effort where the production values are not very high, and neither is the level of the acting.Shot in Alabama, the film is the pet project of co-directors Chuck Hartsell and Chance Shirley.  Shirley also wrote the screenplay, and Hartsell stars in the film.  Like many budding filmmakers, it appears that they enlisted the help of their family and friends, to bring their personal masterpiece to reality.  Much more than you may want to know about the production of the film, can be heard on the commentary track by Hartsell and Shirley.Chuck (Chuck Hartsell) the owner of a video store in Thorsby, is attacked by a zombie, and whacks him with a VCR.  Chuck drops the body off at the local police station, where Barbara (Melissa Bush) is the only one around.  With zombies popping up all around the town, Agent F (John Walker) from the government, arrives in town to investigate the outbreak, but he like most of the town's residents, soon become victims of the undead.  Barbara calls on her old boyfriend Michael (Michael Shelton) to help in the crisis.  Barbara's brother Keith (Kyle Holman), a hunter, has managed to stay safe, by shooting and killing any zombies he comes across, but it seems that there is no escaping the bloodthirsty hoard.If you are looking strictly for laughs, it is remotely possible you might be mildly entertained, however most horror fans are likely to find the unconvincing zombies, cheesy effects, replica guns, goofy behavior, bad acting, and a plot that goes nowhere, decidedly underwhelming.  There are some attempts to spice things up by featuring nudity, but most of the actors probably look better with clothes on.

916315,A1QBQ8N71X5V81,B0009XRZOW,!Vision!,"[12, 13]","Hide And Creep is another addition to the ever-growing popular treat known as the zombie comedy. Following on the successful heels of Shaun Of The Dead, it is but another entry into the new zomcom world. Several other such films have been released with varying degrees of success and many more are poised for release in the future. Unfortunately, the problem with movies venturing into this genre is that they walk a fine line between being completely idiotic messes and actually being able to balance the zombie-horror element with comedy. Luckily, Hide and Creep succeeds in its attempt.Hide And Creep strongly follows the Shaun format, whereas everything involving the zombies is serious and only living people are used for humor. This keeps the menace of the zombies intact and allows the everyday humdrum of life to be examined and poked fun at. Another similarity to Shaun is how the characters seemingly try to continue their mundane existences even in the midst of a zombie outbreak. It is this device, like Shaun, that generates the most humorous moments.Differing from the single straightforward story of Shaun however, Hide And Creep, to its credit, involves the interweaving of four separate stories. None of the characters are strong enough to pull off an entire movie alone, but the ensemble cast crossing each other's paths and dealing with the colorful supporting cast worked excellently. Nice performances are turned in by all as well, and what could have been stereotypical redneck depictions has enough simple charm to make the custodian of all-things-redneck, Jeff Foxworthy, burst with pride.The first story involves Michael (played by Michael Shelton) whom we are first introduced to with a surprising affront of male nudity. A declaration of sorts, letting you know right off that everything you are about to watch is going to be tasteless and crude, yet breezy and comfortable. We quickly learn that Michael is an alien abduction victim (the very same aliens blamed for the rise of the undead) and that he has been dropped off in the woods without his clothes, his girlfriend, and most importantly to him, his car.Our second story involves Chuck (played by Chuck Hartsell), a video store owner and horror movie aficionado who is more interested in drinking beer and watching the Alabama football game than he is in battling zombies. He is the first person to encounter the zombies and after dispatching one in his store he drops the body off at the local sheriff's office and sets off for breakfast. To his chagrin he is further involved by the sheriff's office secretary, her ex-boyfriend, and an ambiguous government agent.The third plot involves the local reverend (played by Barry Austin) who has his hands full with absentee parishioners, deadbeats borrowing things from the church, and worst of all his transformation into a zombie after being bitten. His portrayal is sympathetic and ironic as apparently he is the only good Christian in town.The last and probably most humorous story involves four members of a local gun club caught in the tumultuous uprising of zombies.  The leader, Keith (played by Kyle Holman) is perfect as the gun-crazy yet humble family man. Keith and his cronies are attacked in the woods but make a daring escape. They then make their way into town to warn the good people of Thorsby, Alabama of the threat but find that no one really seems to care all that much.These four stories cross paths several times and really give the sense of scale that was needed. There are no large crowd scenes, military operations, or massive onslaughts of zombies, but having a small cast make their way around to several locations overcomes this low-budget barrier.Hide And Creep does have its shortcomings. The zombie makeup was simply that, just a little makeup. Gore is pretty much non-existent, except for copious amounts of blood. These are minor grievances and are forgivable given the small amount of money the film was made for. The foremost strength of the film lies in the writing. There are more innovative scenes, southern colloquialisms, and redneck pop culture references than you can shake a stick at.The DVD widescreen transfer is nice albeit slightly soft, as Hide And Creep was actually shot on 16MM film, a rarity these days with low budget filmmaking. The mix is in 5.1 surround and really sounds clear and sharp. The understated soundtrack doesn't hurt either.",5,Southern Zombie Goodness,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,4423,"['Hide', 'Creep', 'addition', 'ever-growing', 'popular', 'treat', 'known', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'Following', 'successful', 'heels', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'entry', 'new', 'zomcom', 'world', 'Several', 'other', 'such', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'poised', 'release', 'future', 'Unfortunately', 'problem', 'movies', 'venturing', 'genre', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'being', 'completely', 'idiotic', 'messes', 'actually', 'being', 'able', 'balance', 'zombie-horror', 'element', 'comedy', 'Luckily', 'Hide', 'Creep', 'attempt.Hide', 'Creep', 'strongly', 'Shaun', 'format', 'everything', 'involving', 'zombies', 'serious', 'only', 'living', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'humor', 'menace', 'zombies', 'intact', 'everyday', 'humdrum', 'life', 'be', 'examined', 'poked', 'fun', 'similarity', 'Shaun', 'how', 'characters', 'seemingly', 'try', 'continue', 'mundane', 'existences', 'even', 'midst', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'device', 'Shaun', 'most', 'humorous', 'moments.Differing', 'single', 'straightforward', 'story', 'Shaun', 'however', 'Hide', 'Creep', 'credit', 'interweaving', 'four', 'separate', 'stories', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'entire', 'movie', 'alone', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'crossing', 'other', 'paths', 'dealing', 'colorful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'worked', 'excellently', 'Nice', 'performances', 'are', 'turned', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stereotypical', 'redneck', 'depictions', 'enough', 'simple', 'charm', 'make', 'custodian', 'all-things-redneck', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'burst', 'pride.The', 'first', 'story', 'Michael', 'played', 'Michael', 'Shelton', 'whom', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'surprising', 'affront', 'male', 'nudity', 'declaration', 'sorts', 'letting', 'know', 'right', 'everything', 'are', 'watch', 'going', 'be', 'tasteless', 'crude', 'breezy', 'comfortable', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Michael', 'alien', 'abduction', 'victim', 'very', 'same', 'aliens', 'blamed', 'rise', 'undead', 'been', 'dropped', 'off', 'woods', 'clothes', 'girlfriend', 'most', 'importantly', 'car.Our', 'second', 'story', 'Chuck', 'played', 'Chuck', 'Hartsell', 'video', 'store', 'owner', 'horror', 'movie', 'aficionado', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'drinking', 'beer', 'watching', 'Alabama', 'football', 'game', 'battling', 'zombies', 'first', 'person', 'encounter', 'zombies', 'dispatching', 'one', 'store', 'body', 'off', 'local', 'sheriff', 'office', 'sets', 'off', 'breakfast', 'chagrin', 'further', 'involved', 'sheriff', 'office', 'secretary', 'ex-boyfriend', 'ambiguous', 'government', 'third', 'plot', 'local', 'reverend', 'played', 'Barry', 'Austin', 'who', 'hands', 'full', 'absentee', 'parishioners', 'deadbeats', 'borrowing', 'things', 'church', 'worst', 'transformation', 'zombie', 'being', 'bitten', 'portrayal', 'sympathetic', 'ironic', 'apparently', 'only', 'good', 'Christian', 'town.The', 'last', 'probably', 'most', 'humorous', 'story', 'four', 'members', 'local', 'gun', 'club', 'caught', 'tumultuous', 'uprising', 'zombies', 'leader', 'Keith', 'played', 'Kyle', 'Holman', 'perfect', 'gun-crazy', 'yet', 'humble', 'family', 'man', 'Keith', 'cronies', 'are', 'attacked', 'woods', 'make', 'daring', 'escape', 'then', 'make', 'way', 'town', 'warn', 'good', 'people', 'Thorsby', 'Alabama', 'threat', 'find', 'one', 'really', 'care', 'much.These', 'four', 'stories', 'cross', 'paths', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'give', 'sense', 'scale', 'was', 'needed', 'are', 'large', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'military', 'operations', 'massive', 'onslaughts', 'zombies', 'having', 'small', 'cast', 'make', 'way', 'several', 'locations', 'overcomes', 'low-budget', 'barrier.Hide', 'Creep', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'zombie', 'makeup', 'was', 'simply', 'just', 'little', 'makeup', 'Gore', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-existent', 'copious', 'amounts', 'blood', 'are', 'minor', 'grievances', 'are', 'forgivable', 'given', 'small', 'amount', 'money', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'foremost', 'strength', 'film', 'writing', 'are', 'more', 'innovative', 'scenes', 'southern', 'colloquialisms', 'redneck', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'at.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'nice', 'albeit', 'slightly', 'soft', 'Hide', 'Creep', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', '16MM', 'film', 'rarity', 'days', 'low', 'budget', 'filmmaking', 'mix', '5.1', 'surround', 'really', 'clear', 'sharp', 'understated', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either']",Hide & Creep
