800020,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B0001CNQX0,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[14, 14]","This film is a true inspiration to me and gives us all a glimpse into the potential for positive representation of the Latino experience in the United States.  The acclaimed director, producer and co-writer of this fantastic film, Mr. Gregory Nava, should've received an Academy Award for his masterful direction of this film, and I believe the actors in this film should've been acknowledged as well.  At a time where we all need a voice and are searching for a means to express our experiences in the world, this film is such a blessing for us all to watch.Through the eyes of three generations of the Sanchez family, a Mexican-American family based in East Los Angeles, we get a sense of their triumphs and struggles that are universal to the human condition, as well as the racism, discrimination, displacement and the struggle for bicultural identity that they all face together as the seasons change.  Jose Sanchez, an ambitious young man from Michoacan walked across the border between Mexico and California when it was literally ""a line in the dirt"" and took up roots there to start a new life and raise a family.  The young Jose is played by a beaming, soulful and spirited Jacob Vargas (an actor who has been made a fool of in numerous films since, in ""token Latino roles"" such as drug dealers and thugs--what a waste of phenomenal talent!), and is then by the legendary Mexican actor, Edward Lopez Rojas.  His beautiful wife, Maria, who he first meets while clipping the hedges overlooking a mansion, while she is the nanny to a bunch of little children, is played by the young Jennifer Lopez, who is beautiful, glowing and full of life and courageous inner strength.  The older Maria is played by a soulful and tender Jenny Gago.  Other wonderful actors in this film include: Edward James Olmos (Paco Sanchez, their son and storyteller), Jimmy Smits (Jimmy Sanchez), Constance Marie (Antonia Sanchez), and Elpidia Carrillo (Isabel Sanchez, Jimmy's Salvadorean wife--a beautiful actress we have seen far too little of!).The earthy cinematography in this film is comparable to the great murals and naturalistic portraits of Diego Rivera.  The vibrant colors and wonderful flashbacks of Mexico make you feel like you are taking the journey with Jose Sanchez from Michoacan to Los Angeles.  Beautiful, touching, warm, authentic and lovingly done.  We need more films like this to encourage our youth, inspire the generation of today and reach people from all cultural backgrounds.  Hopefully, with films like this, we can work toward bringing more projects about life, the experience of Latinos and bicultural identity to the foreground through film.",5,"Gracias, Gregory Nava, para una pelicula maravillosa!",1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2658,"['film', 'true', 'inspiration', 'glimpse', 'potential', 'positive', 'representation', 'Latino', 'experience', 'United', 'States', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'producer', 'co-writer', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Gregory', 'Nava', 'should', ""'ve"", 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'masterful', 'direction', 'film', 'believe', 'actors', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'acknowledged', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'where', 'need', 'voice', 'are', 'searching', 'means', 'express', 'experiences', 'world', 'film', 'blessing', 'eyes', 'three', 'generations', 'Sanchez', 'family', 'Mexican-American', 'family', 'based', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'get', 'sense', 'triumphs', 'struggles', 'are', 'universal', 'human', 'condition', 'as', 'well', 'racism', 'discrimination', 'displacement', 'struggle', 'bicultural', 'identity', 'face', 'together', 'seasons', 'change', 'Jose', 'Sanchez', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'Michoacan', 'walked', 'border', 'Mexico', 'California', 'when', 'was', 'literally', 'line', 'dirt', 'took', 'up', 'roots', 'there', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'raise', 'family', 'young', 'Jose', 'played', 'beaming', 'soulful', 'spirited', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'made', 'fool', 'numerous', 'films', 'token', 'Latino', 'roles', 'such', 'drug', 'dealers', 'thugs', 'what', 'waste', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'then', 'legendary', 'Mexican', 'actor', 'Edward', 'Lopez', 'Rojas', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Maria', 'who', 'first', 'clipping', 'hedges', 'overlooking', 'mansion', 'nanny', 'bunch', 'little', 'children', 'played', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'who', 'beautiful', 'glowing', 'full', 'life', 'courageous', 'inner', 'strength', 'older', 'Maria', 'played', 'soulful', 'tender', 'Jenny', 'Gago', 'Other', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'film', 'include', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Paco', 'Sanchez', 'son', 'storyteller', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Jimmy', 'Sanchez', 'Constance', 'Marie', 'Antonia', 'Sanchez', 'Elpidia', 'Carrillo', 'Isabel', 'Sanchez', 'Jimmy', 'Salvadorean', 'wife', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'too', 'little', '.The', 'earthy', 'cinematography', 'film', 'comparable', 'great', 'murals', 'naturalistic', 'portraits', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'wonderful', 'flashbacks', 'Mexico', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'taking', 'journey', 'Jose', 'Sanchez', 'Michoacan', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Beautiful', 'touching', 'warm', 'authentic', 'lovingly', 'done', 'need', 'more', 'films', 'encourage', 'youth', 'inspire', 'generation', 'today', 'reach', 'people', 'cultural', 'backgrounds', 'Hopefully', 'films', 'can', 'work', 'bringing', 'more', 'projects', 'life', 'experience', 'Latinos', 'bicultural', 'identity', 'foreground', 'film']",N/A

It starts off with the story of the parents, then their children.What I really liked about this film is that it was very emotional. In the beginning of the film, which starts of in the 1930's, the mother (played by Jennifer Lopez) is unlawfully sent back to Mexico as an illegal alien. She is actually an American but because of the political/racial situtions during that time, she is not given justice.She lives with an elderly aunt and vows to travel by foot thousands of miles away to go back to California to be reunited with her husband and two other children. The story could stop there but it doesn't. The film gets really good as we watch the mother walk through deserts, rainy fields, and then almost drowns in a raging river while looking for her baby which has floated away. I've never seen such a struggle of survival displayed on screen like that. Imagine a woman swimming in water while looking for a her baby who may or may not have drowned.Thankfully the baby turns up.Next we switch to a scene where six elderly Mexican shaman women, situated in surrounded in a dark room filled with candles and pictures of the Virgin Mary, praying over the baby and asking the Spirit of the raging river not to take his life. The mother sits to the side crying and praying for God to spare her child.Of course much more happens in the film but it's so deep I can't go into detail. Maybe I might write another review later, but I had to express some words about the film now.I'm so glad I saw it and I hope you enjoy it as well.",5,One of the best films I've ever seen,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,1723,"['Even', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes', 'ago', 'was', 'so', 'moving', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'ASAP.The', 'story', 'timeline', 'piece', 'Mexican-American', 'family', 'California', 'story', 'parents', 'then', 'children.What', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'beginning', 'film', '1930', 'mother', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'unlawfully', 'sent', 'back', 'Mexico', 'illegal', 'alien', 'actually', 'American', 'political/racial', 'situtions', 'time', 'not', 'given', 'justice.She', 'elderly', 'aunt', 'vows', 'travel', 'foot', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'go', 'back', 'California', 'be', 'reunited', 'husband', 'two', 'other', 'children', 'story', 'could', 'stop', 'there', ""n't"", 'film', 'really', 'good', 'watch', 'mother', 'walk', 'deserts', 'rainy', 'fields', 'then', 'almost', 'drowns', 'raging', 'river', 'looking', 'baby', 'floated', 'away', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'struggle', 'survival', 'displayed', 'screen', 'Imagine', 'woman', 'swimming', 'water', 'looking', 'baby', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'drowned.Thankfully', 'baby', 'up.Next', 'switch', 'scene', 'where', 'six', 'elderly', 'Mexican', 'shaman', 'women', 'situated', 'surrounded', 'dark', 'room', 'filled', 'candles', 'pictures', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'praying', 'baby', 'asking', 'Spirit', 'raging', 'river', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'mother', 'side', 'crying', 'praying', 'God', 'spare', 'child.Of', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'happens', 'film', 'so', 'deep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'Maybe', 'might', 'write', 'review', 'later', 'had', 'express', 'words', 'film', 'now.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'saw', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

It was.I am generally wary of family or individual biography movies, as in my experience, they tend to be episodic and lacking in the coherence of more conventional dramas -- by which I mean, they typically consist of a series of episodes but no clear plot line.  That was less the case for this movie than for other family/individual dramas, perhaps because pretty much the same group of people were in the film throughout, and there was an overriding theme or point -- about the immigrant experience, particularly for Mexican-Americans.The story involves a young Mexican man, Jose, who is forced to leave the poverty of Mexico (in the late 20s?) to find family and work.  He walks all the way to Los Angeles -- the border at this time is just a line in the ground, as he says -- where he has the name of someone who is possibly a relative.  This man happily takes him in, and Jose gets a job as a landscaper working for wealthy Anglos.  He falls in love, marries, and has a family.  A series of tragedies and triumphs follow, involving this man, his wife, and each of their children.  By the end of the movie, Jose is an old man, assessing his life as good.  I would say that the theme of this movie is life in a Mexican-American family, reflecting both traditional values and customs as well as the problems of assimilation and cultural identity.Maybe it was just me, but I couldn't seem to get English subtitles to the Spanish to work.
