1404630,AR5VUOE6SSOI6,B004ET9VNU,Humming bird,"[0, 0]",This is one great DVD for the money. The instructor explains the whole DVD step by step making it both easy and fun to learn. It would cost you four times the price of this DVD alone for a class to teach you all that he teaches you in this DVD. It is an excellent DVD for someone who is starting out or wants to expand their learning skills.,5,One great DVD for the money.,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,341,"['one', 'great', 'DVD', 'money', 'instructor', 'whole', 'DVD', 'step', 'step', 'making', 'easy', 'fun', 'learn', 'would', 'cost', 'four', 'times', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'class', 'teach', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'someone', 'who', 'starting', 'out', 'expand', 'learning', 'skills']",N/A

1404634,AWW8QV4RHO2CU,B004ET9VNU,Tourmaline,"[1, 1]",Joe Silvera is a wonderful instructor! I was having a great deal of difficulty soldering my silver jewelry (which can be expensive when messed up!) and Mr. Silvera covered all I was having trouble with and more! I am still learning but now I have this insight I was missing. The information is detailed and thorough and easily understood. I am so glad I bought this DVD! I also bought the accompanying book which has quite a few projects. I highly recommend this!,5,Really terrific,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,463,"['Joe', 'Silvera', 'wonderful', 'instructor', 'was', 'having', 'great', 'deal', 'difficulty', 'soldering', 'silver', 'jewelry', 'can', 'be', 'expensive', 'when', 'messed', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Silvera', 'covered', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'more', 'am', 'still', 'learning', 'now', 'have', 'insight', 'was', 'missing', 'information', 'detailed', 'thorough', 'easily', 'understood', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'also', 'bought', 'accompanying', 'book', 'quite', 'few', 'projects', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
