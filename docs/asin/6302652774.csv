325834,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,6302652774,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[6, 7]","The storyline involves a father working for the FBI and spending most of his time trying to catch one particular weapons selling crime boss. His three sons have just spent the summer with their grandfather that is a ninja master. The grandfather is training them in the ways of a ninja. When the criminal visits the boys grandfather you realize he was a former student to their grandfather. Later he tries to kidnap the boys. The first attempt is a laugh riot since the three inept young men sent to do the job are gnarly dudes without a clue. Later the crime boss is successful at apprehending them and it falls upon their grandfather to rescue them.Most of what the three ninjas are taught is plausible, but I have to admit I was a little disturbed by all the ""hiya's"" as they did their martial art moves. Having received some karate lessons, watched numerous martial arts movies including my heroes Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, and Jet Li, and attended judo and karate tournaments, I found that odd. I am by no means saying I am an expert, but I have never heard instructors or students saying ""hiya"". Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, I just found that a little out of character for a ninja that is typically as stealthy as a cat and aren't prone to yelling ""hiya"" to alert you of their attack. I'm not just talking about the kids, the adults did it in this movie too.The movie probably was geared most towards kids, but the whole family should enjoy it. It has elements of movies like ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Home Alone"". A good deal of fighting sequences that are choreographed with great skill. The choreography and the editing are to be commended for making the film a class above many of the same type karate genre. Good acting, directing, music, and sets make it a very good quality movie. I don't think this film had a large budget, but they made excellent use of what they had. This rates high on my list of enjoyable kids movies. It just goes to show you don't need killing, sex, murder, and cursing to make a great movie. I laughed several times duing this movie. I highly recommend it to families. The quality of this version of the DVD is excellent but does not include any extras. It is still a bargain for the price.",4,Pro Ninjas,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,2232,"['storyline', 'father', 'working', 'FBI', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'catch', 'one', 'particular', 'weapons', 'selling', 'crime', 'boss', 'three', 'sons', 'have', 'just', 'spent', 'summer', 'grandfather', 'ninja', 'master', 'grandfather', 'training', 'ways', 'ninja', 'When', 'criminal', 'visits', 'boys', 'realize', 'was', 'former', 'student', 'grandfather', 'Later', 'kidnap', 'boys', 'first', 'attempt', 'laugh', 'riot', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'sent', 'do', 'job', 'are', 'gnarly', 'dudes', 'clue', 'Later', 'crime', 'boss', 'successful', 'apprehending', 'grandfather', 'rescue', 'them.Most', 'what', 'three', 'ninjas', 'are', 'taught', 'plausible', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'disturbed', 'hiya', 'did', 'martial', 'art', 'moves', 'Having', 'received', 'karate', 'lessons', 'watched', 'numerous', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'including', 'heroes', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Jet', 'Li', 'attended', 'judo', 'karate', 'tournaments', 'found', 'odd', 'am', 'means', 'saying', 'am', 'expert', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'instructors', 'students', 'saying', 'hiya', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'found', 'little', 'character', 'ninja', 'typically', 'as', 'stealthy', 'cat', 'are', ""n't"", 'prone', 'yelling', 'hiya', 'alert', 'attack', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'kids', 'adults', 'did', 'movie', 'too.The', 'movie', 'probably', 'was', 'geared', 'most', 'towards', 'kids', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'enjoy', 'elements', 'movies', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Home', 'Alone', 'good', 'deal', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'are', 'choreographed', 'great', 'skill', 'choreography', 'editing', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'making', 'film', 'class', 'many', 'same', 'type', 'karate', 'genre', 'Good', 'acting', 'directing', 'music', 'sets', 'make', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'had', 'large', 'budget', 'made', 'excellent', 'use', 'what', 'had', 'rates', 'high', 'list', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'movies', 'just', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'killing', 'sex', 'murder', 'cursing', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'laughed', 'several', 'times', 'duing', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'families', 'quality', 'version', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'not', 'include', 'extras', 'still', 'bargain', 'price']",N/A

325845,A1C7BWPATO40VA,6302652774,Nathan T.,"[0, 4]","Before I begin, I would like to say.....ISN'T VICTOR WONG THE CUTEST LITTLE NINJA MAN EVER OR WHAT??? He's like the combination of the Pillsbury Doughboy wrapped in a costume made out of ripped up plastic bags! IT WAS SOOOOO CUTEEEEEEEEE, not to mention the main villain's fat body guard he was cute too!!! I wish I had a cute grandpa like that! I just wanna poke him to death sooooo cuteeeee!!*Ahem* Anyway, back to my more masculine manly side.....in all honesty, I would have given this movie probably a 2 stars instead, even though it was for kids does not mean the flaws should be excusable. 3 stars is for the cute grandpa. Before I continue though I would like to acknowledge that yes I do know it's a kid's movie and it's meant for jokes, but that aside, I would also like to point out that bad acting is simply bad acting regardless of what kind of film you watch.CONS:1. This movie had a lot of bad acting, using the excuse ""oh, it's just a kids movie"" is bad. I would think that all parents would want their child to be exposed to high quality things. Like if they are interested in music, you'd want something intellectual or stimulating instead of exposing them to rap that have a bunch of black people singing about b***ches and drugs and shootouts. In a way it's the same with movies. There are a ton of kid movies that have great cinematography, acting, etc etc. This movie had mediocre / goofy acting, but it's not horrific. It's still okay, I just wanted to point out that bad acting and directing is NEVER excusable. Don't let your kids watch dumbed down movies just because they're kids.....our population is already messed up because of that idea.2. This movie had a lot of unrealistic and highly dangerous aspects that I would advise all parents to go over with their children.a) It is NEVER EVER a good idea to go after people that are armed with weapons like guns and samurai swords and think it is a joke, as displayed in this video.b) In reality, the boys wouldn't have stood a chance because when you fight, you also have to have weight and strength to somewhat match the opponent that you're fighting, regardless of skills. I know strength is not everything, but it is something. I remember awhile back an Asian man with a very high degree in black belt karate fought a regular, but very large white man in a caged arena, maybe UFC? Anyhow, with all his experience, the karate master quickly lost when the huge white man grabbed him, shoved him against the cage, and rammed his knee into the guy's face. It ended in less than a round. The kids were so small and under developed muscles and lack of weight, their punches and kicks would not do enough damage. So the truth comes out, in reality, they'll get killed, the movie would have ended during the first attack.c) Martial arts training takes many, many years. Some people learn it for decades without fully mastering it. So the kids learning it from their grandpa and taking on a whole army of gun and samurai sword wielding villains is fun to watch, but might give kids the COMPLETELY wrong idea about reality.One giant thing this movie lacks is that there's a price to pay for being a hero. Death and pain. Being a hero is not always rewarding, sometimes the people you try to save go and backstab you. I wonder how any of the boys in this movie would react when one of their brothers is literally cut in half right in front of their eyes. The boys are never really hurt or cut due to the possibility of parents complaining, but about what? How reality really is?3. The ending was extremely unrealistic because after all of that, no dad's going to be like ""congrats kids! Let's go out for a pizza yay!"" The criminals could have won as well since they had the old man and three kids as hostages.4. Ninja's are known to be stealthy, so I thought it was hilarious that they would run down the corridor, going ""ARRGGHHHHHHHHH!!!"" So major frown on that...Also the part where one ninja is like ""yeah Frank is that you?"" lmao!Overall, bad acting, mediocre film, completely unrealistic. It's nice to have your kids watch a kid's movie, but expose them to higher quality stuff or they'll grow up to be just as messed up and ignorant as the mass majority of our population.....Let your kids watch movies like these, but PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY AND OUR CIVILIZATION ....educate / reeducate them afterwards or they'll just be dumbed down by it. Please don't let your kids just watch movies, use it as a chance to educate them on the true facts of life and to educate yourself, not to mention using it to spend time with them as well.Please stop letting your kids become as messed up as I am.

I happen to have some karate experience (a green belt in Tae Kwon Do, in fact) so I know enough to say that for a bunch of grown ups to be good at karate, it's insulting to those men to get beat up by ninja students half their size. Thus, they even had ninja swords. To see three little shrimps like that kick ... definetly insults me...Although it was suppose to be a comedy and yes, even I thought it was funny at times, but to twist common sense around like what this movie did about fighting, I just have to say it's the worst movie I ever saw.....",1,This was the stupidest movie on earth!,1035158400,"10 21, 2002",2002,906,"['were', 'three', 'middle', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'had', 'lot', 'experience', 'fighting', 'even', ""'d"", 'make', 'sense', 'beat', 'up', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'fighting', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'insulting', 'beat', 'up', 'full', 'grow', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'ninjas', 'movie', 'completely', 'insulted', 'intellegence', 'karate', 'happen', 'have', 'karate', 'experience', 'green', 'belt', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'fact', 'so', 'know', 'enough', 'say', 'bunch', 'grown', 'ups', 'be', 'good', 'karate', 'insulting', 'men', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'ninja', 'students', 'size', 'Thus', 'even', 'had', 'ninja', 'swords', 'see', 'three', 'little', 'shrimps', 'kick', 'definetly', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'comedy', 'yes', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'times', 'twist', 'common', 'sense', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'fighting', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', '..']",N/A

Every once in awhile, though, a children's movie is made that is so good at what it does that even grown-ups can watch it and still laugh/smile.  ""3 Ninjas"" is that type of movie.For a basic plot summary, ""3 Ninjas"" sees a young trio of brothers--Rocky (Michael Treanor), Colt (Max Shade), and Tum-Tum (Chad Power)--caught in a kidnapping plot initiated by Snyder (Rand Kingsley).  However, thanks to some ninja training from their Grandpa (Victor Wong), the three grade-schoolers are able to use their wits to try and fight off the hopeless idiots trying to ""kidnap"" them.There are two primary reasons why ""3 Ninjas"" works so well for both children and adults:1. For kids, the action is top-notch.  I mean, every kid wants to feel as if he/she could take care of themselves (an emotion tapped into perhaps best in ""Home Alone"") and be independent of their parents, so this plotline plays perfectly to the grade-school set.  As a kid watching this movie, you will easily identify with the characters.2. No matter how old you get, though, the sly humor and buffoonish criminals throughout the flick will always put a smile on your face.  The performance of the three dimwitted burglars is easily the comedic highlight, as they are such idiotic characters that one can't help but laugh at them!Also, this movie has an incredibly catchy soundtrack theme that really generates some excitement and will stick in your head for quite some time.Overall, ""3 Ninjas"" is a defining film of my childhood and one that I can enjoy even as an adult.  If you loved ""The Karate Kid"" or the childish excitement of ""Home Alone"", then give this one a shot as well!",5,Childhood: A Definition,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1868,"['Usually', 'movie', 'completely', 'pandering', 'children', 'leaving', 'adults', 'totally', 'equation', 'live', 'meaningful', 'sense', 'once', 'child', 'up', 'tape/disc', 'out', 'window', 'so', 'speak', 'once', 'awhile', 'though', 'children', 'movie', 'made', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'even', 'grown-ups', 'can', 'watch', 'still', 'laugh/smile', '3', 'Ninjas', 'type', 'movie.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '3', 'Ninjas', 'young', 'trio', 'brothers', 'Rocky', 'Michael', 'Treanor', 'Colt', 'Max', 'Shade', 'Tum-Tum', 'Chad', 'Power', 'caught', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'initiated', 'Snyder', 'Rand', 'Kingsley', 'However', 'thanks', 'ninja', 'training', 'Grandpa', 'Victor', 'Wong', 'three', 'grade-schoolers', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'wits', 'try', 'fight', 'off', 'hopeless', 'idiots', 'trying', 'kidnap', 'are', 'two', 'primary', 'reasons', 'why', '3', 'Ninjas', 'so', 'well', 'children', 'adults:1', 'kids', 'action', 'top-notch', 'mean', 'kid', 'feel', 'he/she', 'could', 'take', 'care', 'emotion', 'tapped', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Home', 'Alone', 'be', 'independent', 'parents', 'plotline', 'perfectly', 'grade-school', 'set', 'kid', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'easily', 'identify', 'characters.2', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'get', 'though', 'sly', 'humor', 'buffoonish', 'criminals', 'flick', 'will', 'always', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'performance', 'three', 'dimwitted', 'burglars', 'easily', 'comedic', 'highlight', 'are', 'such', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'Also', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'catchy', 'soundtrack', 'theme', 'really', 'excitement', 'will', 'stick', 'head', 'quite', 'time.Overall', '3', 'Ninjas', 'defining', 'film', 'childhood', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'even', 'adult', 'loved', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'childish', 'excitement', 'Home', 'Alone', 'then', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'as', 'well']",N/A
