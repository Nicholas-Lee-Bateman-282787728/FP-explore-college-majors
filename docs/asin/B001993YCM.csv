1162584,AK7D1BHZOSOL1,B001993YCM,General Pete,"[2, 2]",I liked this show more then I had anticipated.  While the plotlines are somewhat juvenile this puts the show light years ahead of United States shows geared towards children that look for excuses to be idiotically infantile.  The stories are I think true to the sprit of Doctor Who.  My only two points of contention would be the amount of time Sarah Jane Smith (an otherwise extremely strong character) spends pining for her days of adventure with the Doctor.I'm sorry I thought the entire point was that humans being humans could solve there problems on their own?  5 whole minutes of every episode is devoted to a doctor anecdote.  The other problem I have with the show is that every single plotline either extends to mind control or the end of all life on earth as we know it.  However this I can attribute to younger kids needing to believe the characters are in constant danger in order to remain interested.Overall-Don't let these minor quibbles sway you as simple non-story arch stories they work very well especially since most of the children lack experience,4,Considering it is geared more towards kids its really not bad Scifi,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,1069,"['liked', 'show', 'more', 'then', 'had', 'anticipated', 'plotlines', 'are', 'somewhat', 'juvenile', 'show', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'United', 'States', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'look', 'excuses', 'be', 'idiotically', 'infantile', 'stories', 'are', 'think', 'true', 'sprit', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'only', 'two', 'points', 'contention', 'would', 'be', 'amount', 'time', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'otherwise', 'extremely', 'strong', 'character', 'pining', 'days', 'adventure', 'Doctor.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'thought', 'entire', 'point', 'was', 'humans', 'being', 'humans', 'could', 'solve', 'there', 'problems', 'own', '5', 'whole', 'minutes', 'episode', 'devoted', 'doctor', 'anecdote', 'other', 'problem', 'have', 'show', 'single', 'plotline', 'mind', 'control', 'end', 'life', 'earth', 'know', 'However', 'can', 'attribute', 'younger', 'kids', 'needing', 'believe', 'characters', 'are', 'constant', 'danger', 'order', 'remain', 'interested.Overall-Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'sway', 'simple', 'non-story', 'arch', 'stories', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'most', 'children', 'lack', 'experience']",The Sarah Jane Adventures: Season 1

But leave it the 2005's DW producer Russell T. Davies to get not one but 2 spin-off successful off the ground (both are working on season 2's as we speak, well...""read"").  The continuing adventures of the best companion in the 40 years of Doctor Who...in my humble opinion...Elisabeth Sladen still has ""IT.""  Having see loads of space and time travel following her first meeting with the 3rd Doctor in Time Warrior (who she immediately assumes is the root of kidnappings she's investigating) they soon become the best of friends and a team to continue into his 4th incarnation, then later meeting the 5th, and most recently the 10th in School Reunion revealing what happens to a companion who is ""left behind"" by the Doctor. She's witnessed the creation of the Daleks, she seen plenty with the Doctor. Her individual adventures show to be well, ""spooky"" for having traveled with the Timelord, maybe having lost some humanity (like Rose's mum suggests is happening to her), but she grows over the course of the SJ Adventure series (and the Season 4 finally).The monsters of the series, some old, some new, some new and old, are okay...interesting and benign enough that there is no true horror, as Sarah's companions are barely in jr. high, it seems inappropriate for the danger to be to much...but the stakes do get pretty high over the course of the series, building to a climax of planetary proportions....and super cameo at the end (no not the Doctor!) The SJ Adventures' TARGET AUDIENCE is neatly below Dr. Who's family audience, but with enough scares to make it work for the being the sofa crowd. My 6 year old was hooked, less so with my 10 year old, both who love DW (old and new), and they understand the SARAH JANE was my ""ROSE"" and that connection with it's roots means plenty. So as a stand alone project...I'd say 3 stars if fair...but if we evaluate it as fans (and parents), I'd make it 4 stars. which if pretty good for a fledgling series and a spin-off no less.....plenty that's cringe-worthy and not enough of the ""TIN DOG"".There's also some nice links to the Season 4 of Doctor Who....like Luke's origin and the Time Beetle from ""Left Turn"" is a minion of a creature faced by SJS in her initial season here.One Question....does this set include the pilot special ""INVASION OF BANE""which was released by itself on DVD, atleast on region 2.

Personally I think The Sarah Jane Adventures is a much better series than Torchwood and I find it more consistent in terms of quality than the New Doctor Who series.Admittedly the 1st two stories (invasion of the Bane and Revenge of the Slitheen) are sort of weak which is why I gave this set 4 stars but as the series progresses the stories definitely improve. I especially enjoyed Eye of the Gorgon and Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?Another thing I love about this series is the main heroine is a single middle aged woman.

All ages can enjoy this one and it's other series too because like ""doctor who ; this is a family show and this one was shown earlier and aimed to be even more family orientated than ""doctor who' it's parent series was. On the other end of the spectrum 'torchwood' another spinoff is extremely ADULT! which is interesting to think about. But all three shows are well done and do their various jobs extremely well. The effects are decent here and thanks to bbc wales for keeping british sci fi alive.  If not for them these series and even 'being human' would be long gone. If you are only into very serious sci fi then this may not be for you. If you aren't worried about it then this is just fine and even the sci fi network showed this one.  Liz is gone and now so is this series but it had great ratings and would have lasted alot longer. Earlier this year the nicolas courtney who played the brigader on 'dr who' also died both of these actors will be missed by many. The dvd has a great picture and the extras are good enough.

True, they have lots of cool explosions and humor and aliens and the lovely Elisabeth Sladen.  4 discs holding the first season episodes plus tons of extras this is a great way to get your children into the universe of Doctor Who.

I mean, it is Sarah Jane Smith, hubba-hubba, but you may find some parts just too silly or unrealistic.  Yes, I said unrealistic while talking about Doctor Who - what am I thinking?
