I had never seen the new x-men but of course I watched the old cartoon.  So I was surprised to see the crapy animation, bad voice acting and well the storylines are the reason this gets a 2/5.  They are all pretty good but is overall too kid like and not serious enough.  It's weird cause the director was trying to have this perfect balance between dark and kiddie stuff.  If the show was overall moer serious, then the really serious moments would work, but instead they just feel out of place.Shadowed Past- this is a really weird episode.  We find out who nightcrwler's mom is, but the serious parts fail because of the overall jokiness of the show.  The funniest thing that I saw was that all the x-men are in high school.  Luckily they didn't make wolverine like 16 years old.  So rogue is having dreams and nightcrawler finds stuff out, pretty dumb.Grim Reminder-  I would rename this episode don't judge people by what you see on the surface.  this one almost does a good job with blebding darkness and comdy by havign wolverine going INSANE in his bedroom and ripping everything apart, nd then a little girl is writing a letter saying ""mr x sure is gonna yell at logan for trashing his room"", I have to say that I actually laughed here.  There is another part where wolverine asks the girl ""am I reading too loud for you.""  If the show could have put more than 2 of these lines in sometimes, then this would be a much better show.The Cauldron parts 1 and 2-  Kind of a cool episode.  We meet cyclops's brother who instantly gets drawn in by magneto.  So magneto is really just having fun here but, god it was stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry, I thought I  could review all these and I almost made it.The special features include introductions to the episodes and a behind the scenes look at the voice talent.  Did I just say talent?The intros have the producers/directors talking to us like we are actually 22 like me.  I can't see anybody my age actually enjoying this so I wish they would have talked like they are talking to little kids like in they do in their show.  But decent introductions into a bad show.X-men unmasked is good if you need a good laugh.  And I lughed ver well al the way through this.  They show you the people of all the voices, and there is a girl on there I think it is megan who plays i think the girl who can walk through stuff, send me a message sometime and I WILL TAKE YOU OUT, PLEASE FIND ME IF YOU GO TO OMAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So overall a pretty bad show, but I enjoyed it!!",2,presentation for dvd's is a 4 or 5 but the show itself is a 2,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,2638,"['did', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'much', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'not', 'taking', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'new', 'x-men', 'course', 'watched', 'old', 'cartoon', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'crapy', 'animation', 'bad', 'voice', 'acting', 'well', 'storylines', 'are', 'reason', '2/5', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'too', 'kid', 'not', 'serious', 'enough', 'weird', 'cause', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'have', 'perfect', 'balance', 'dark', 'kiddie', 'stuff', 'show', 'was', 'overall', 'moer', 'serious', 'then', 'really', 'serious', 'moments', 'would', 'work', 'instead', 'just', 'feel', 'place.Shadowed', 'Past-', 'really', 'weird', 'episode', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'nightcrwler', 'mom', 'serious', 'parts', 'fail', 'overall', 'jokiness', 'show', 'funniest', 'thing', 'saw', 'was', 'x-men', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'Luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'wolverine', '16', 'years', 'old', 'So', 'rogue', 'having', 'dreams', 'nightcrawler', 'finds', 'stuff', 'out', 'pretty', 'dumb.Grim', 'Reminder-', 'would', 'rename', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'people', 'what', 'see', 'surface', 'one', 'almost', 'good', 'job', 'blebding', 'darkness', 'comdy', 'havign', 'wolverine', 'going', 'INSANE', 'bedroom', 'ripping', 'everything', 'apart', 'nd', 'then', 'little', 'girl', 'writing', 'letter', 'saying', 'mr', 'x', 'sure', 'gon', 'na', 'yell', 'logan', 'trashing', 'room', 'have', 'say', 'actually', 'laughed', 'here', 'part', 'where', 'wolverine', 'girl', 'am', 'reading', 'too', 'loud', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'more', '2', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'show.The', 'Cauldron', 'parts', '1', '2-', 'Kind', 'cool', 'episode', 'meet', 'cyclops', 'brother', 'who', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'magneto', 'So', 'magneto', 'really', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'here', 'god', 'was', 'stupid', 'Sorry', 'thought', 'could', 'review', 'almost', 'made', 'it.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'introductions', 'episodes', 'scenes', 'look', 'voice', 'talent', 'Did', 'just', 'say', 'talent', 'intros', 'have', 'producers/directors', 'talking', 'are', 'actually', '22', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anybody', 'age', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'so', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'talked', 'are', 'talking', 'little', 'kids', 'do', 'show', 'decent', 'introductions', 'bad', 'show.X-men', 'unmasked', 'good', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'lughed', 'ver', 'well', 'way', 'show', 'people', 'voices', 'girl', 'think', 'megan', 'who', 'plays', 'i', 'think', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'walk', 'stuff', 'send', 'message', 'sometime', 'WILL', 'TAKE', 'OUT', 'PLEASE', 'FIND', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'GO', 'TO', 'OMAHA', 'So', 'overall', 'pretty', 'bad', 'show', 'enjoyed']",X-Men: Evolution - Xposing the Truth
