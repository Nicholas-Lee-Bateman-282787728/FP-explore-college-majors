I would watch her paint woodwork, do crosswords, order pizza, etc.  But this film, whatever it may have started out to be, should never have escaped the studio.  Angelina Jolie plays a screaming drug addict, during all of the 4 minutes that she's in the movie.  At one point, being driven in a car against her will, she screams that she wants out, and bangs the window of the passenger side for effect.  Trust me:  this scene was not in the script.

739624,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00008DDW9,Michael Butts,"[9, 10]","WITHOUT EVIDENCE is a frustrating movie to watch, because you know how it ends, and it's not really a happy ending.  Based on the true story of Michael Francke, an Oregon Director of Corrections who was brutally murdered.  His brother, Kevin, is certain a conspiracy is involved, but the police and the district attorney have nothing to do with his theory.  A coverup is intimated, as key witnesses admit they lied.  Along the way Kevin gets involved with a young woman who killed a drug dealer--she says he is the one that killed Francke.  However, a druggie named Frank Gable is framed and convicted.  The movie even has a disclaimer that offers a reward for any information involving the murder.The movie snail paced, and at times loses its impact by trying to be too conversational.  However, in the film are some very good performances.  Scott Plank as Kevin is sincere and riveting in his portrayal of the brother wanting justice for his slain kin; Anna Gunn is very believable as Liz, the young woman Kevin falls for; Andrew Prine does a fine job as a t.v. reporter who helps Kevin find the truth; Paul Perri gives a good performance as Unsold, the police chief who wants Kevin to disappear; and Angelina Jole in one of her first roles portrays Jody, the drug addict teen who knows the truth but is silenced.  Jolie shows her potential in a role that doesn't have a lot of screen time, but when she's on screen, you are mesmerized with her credible performance.Some tighter direction and a shortened script may have helped make this low budget film a little better, but as it is, it's a reputable true crime drama.",3,A JOLIE GOOD TIME,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1621,"['WITHOUT', 'EVIDENCE', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'watch', 'know', 'how', 'not', 'really', 'happy', 'ending', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'Michael', 'Francke', 'Oregon', 'Director', 'Corrections', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'certain', 'conspiracy', 'involved', 'police', 'district', 'attorney', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'theory', 'coverup', 'intimated', 'key', 'witnesses', 'admit', 'lied', 'way', 'Kevin', 'involved', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'drug', 'dealer', 'one', 'killed', 'Francke', 'However', 'druggie', 'named', 'Frank', 'Gable', 'framed', 'convicted', 'movie', 'even', 'disclaimer', 'reward', 'information', 'involving', 'murder.The', 'movie', 'snail', 'paced', 'times', 'impact', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'conversational', 'However', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Scott', 'Plank', 'Kevin', 'sincere', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'brother', 'wanting', 'justice', 'slain', 'kin', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'very', 'believable', 'Liz', 'young', 'woman', 'Kevin', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'fine', 'job', 't.v', 'reporter', 'who', 'Kevin', 'find', 'truth', 'Paul', 'Perri', 'good', 'performance', 'Unsold', 'police', 'chief', 'who', 'Kevin', 'disappear', 'Angelina', 'Jole', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'portrays', 'Jody', 'drug', 'addict', 'teen', 'who', 'truth', 'silenced', 'Jolie', 'potential', 'role', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'screen', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'credible', 'performance.Some', 'tighter', 'direction', 'shortened', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'reputable', 'true', 'crime', 'drama']",N/A

This crime/courtroom thriller movie has a two-fold purpose. The first is to chronicle a brother's search for the truth and the second is to call the fairness of the American justice system into question. Either way, it's a scary tale. Shortly before Francke was killed he visited his brother Kevin in Florida. There he confided that he had accidentally discovered a drug smuggling ring that linked his colleagues with prison inmate. Later when the Salem police contact Kevin about the death, they assure him that Michael died during a routine robbery, but Kevin doesn't buy it and so heads to the northwest to investigate. It doesn't take long for him to get knee-deep into a complex conspiracy plot that leaves him wonder whom, if anyone in town he can trust. Despite the small budget, this movie has a down-to-earth plot with plenty of detailed twists.",3,Without Evidence,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,986,"['1989', 'Oregon', 'Department', 'Corrections', 'director', 'Michael', 'Francke', 'was', 'murdered', 'office', 'building', 'case', 'unsolved', 'crime/courtroom', 'thriller', 'movie', 'two-fold', 'purpose', 'first', 'chronicle', 'brother', 'search', 'truth', 'second', 'call', 'fairness', 'American', 'justice', 'system', 'question', 'way', 'scary', 'tale', 'Shortly', 'Francke', 'was', 'killed', 'visited', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'Florida', 'confided', 'had', 'accidentally', 'discovered', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'ring', 'linked', 'colleagues', 'prison', 'inmate', 'Later', 'when', 'Salem', 'police', 'contact', 'Kevin', 'death', 'assure', 'Michael', 'died', 'routine', 'robbery', 'Kevin', ""n't"", 'buy', 'so', 'heads', 'northwest', 'investigate', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'get', 'knee-deep', 'complex', 'conspiracy', 'plot', 'wonder', 'whom', 'anyone', 'town', 'can', 'trust', 'small', 'budget', 'movie', 'down-to-earth', 'plot', 'plenty', 'detailed', 'twists']",N/A
