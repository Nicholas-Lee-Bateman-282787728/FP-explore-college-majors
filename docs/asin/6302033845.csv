291694,AQUU8S55JGY2H,6302033845,Aco,"[3, 4]","About 15 minutes into Philip Baker Hall's tour de force performance I was reminded of another filmed one-man show that resonates with me to this day. Spike Lee's Huey P. Newton Story also features an actor (Roger Guenveur Smith) who so completely embodies the historical character he's playing that it was frequently an overwhelming experience for me, to which I had to pause the tape to catch my mind and heart up to the power of the performance and the magnitude of who this person was. So three or four times during Robert Altman's spare, claustrophobic, voyeuristic, vibrant exposure of Hall's Nixon I had to pause the film to recognize where I was and what the picture was doing to me.This stopping and starting might seem an unaffirming way to lend myself to some great art work, but the prerogative of home video has to make allowances for digestion as performances like this are the highest and greatest of this transformative art form. Secret Honor goes as far in inspiring me as it does in challenging my historical understanding of a man who came before my time, who I am familiar with, but have my knowledge through the prism of others. Such remains the case here, but I am even more curious to investigate this complicated and polarizing man, as Hall's Nixon is a man used up and manipulated as mich as he was a schemer and charlatan of America's zeitgeist and paranoia.The Criterion Collection, distinct as they are for featuring this alone, improve on the mere presentation of the film with an extended interview with Hall, commentaries by Altman and writer Donald Freed and several pieces of Nixon's speeches.This is a landmark work. Like Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain, Sam Waterston's Abraham Lincoln, Roger Guenveur Smith's Huey P. Newton, Philip Baker Hall's Richard Nixon-all men of the stage-allows for the beautiful symmetry of the actors art and the historical imagination of pioneers and titans of era long gone.Stellar.",5,"Testing 1, 2, 3, uh, 4",1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1940,"['15', 'minutes', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'was', 'reminded', 'filmed', 'one-man', 'show', 'day', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Newton', 'Story', 'also', 'actor', 'Roger', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'who', 'so', 'completely', 'historical', 'character', 'playing', 'was', 'frequently', 'overwhelming', 'experience', 'had', 'pause', 'tape', 'catch', 'mind', 'heart', 'up', 'power', 'performance', 'magnitude', 'who', 'person', 'was', 'So', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'spare', 'claustrophobic', 'voyeuristic', 'vibrant', 'exposure', 'Hall', 'Nixon', 'had', 'pause', 'film', 'recognize', 'where', 'was', 'what', 'picture', 'was', 'doing', 'me.This', 'stopping', 'starting', 'might', 'seem', 'unaffirming', 'way', 'lend', 'great', 'art', 'work', 'prerogative', 'home', 'video', 'make', 'allowances', 'digestion', 'performances', 'are', 'highest', 'greatest', 'transformative', 'art', 'form', 'Secret', 'Honor', 'as', 'far', 'inspiring', 'challenging', 'historical', 'understanding', 'man', 'who', 'came', 'time', 'who', 'am', 'familiar', 'have', 'knowledge', 'prism', 'others', 'Such', 'case', 'here', 'am', 'even', 'more', 'curious', 'investigate', 'complicated', 'polarizing', 'man', 'Hall', 'Nixon', 'man', 'used', 'up', 'manipulated', 'as', 'mich', 'was', 'schemer', 'charlatan', 'America', 'zeitgeist', 'paranoia.The', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'are', 'featuring', 'alone', 'improve', 'mere', 'presentation', 'film', 'extended', 'interview', 'Hall', 'commentaries', 'Altman', 'writer', 'Donald', 'Freed', 'several', 'pieces', 'Nixon', 'speeches.This', 'landmark', 'work', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Roger', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Newton', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Richard', 'Nixon-all', 'men', 'stage-allows', 'beautiful', 'symmetry', 'actors', 'art', 'historical', 'imagination', 'pioneers', 'titans', 'era', 'long', 'gone.Stellar']",N/A

Barten,"[2, 5]","Compared to the kind of intellectual history of the 20th century which the last few years have produced, or even compared to the order imposed on ideas in such mammoth books as THE SOCIOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHIES:  A GLOBAL THEORY OF INTELLECTUAL CHANGE by Randall Collins, the movie ""Secret Honor"" offers a picture of a man thinking about a pardon in a legal and political situation that combines bits and pieces of thoughts in agonizing glory.  I probably wouldn't be writing this review, except that this videotape is one of the few in my collection which I consider watching all over again whenever I can't quite remember what is on this videotape.  The line I have been trying to pinpoint most is, ""I'm not saying that two rights don't make a wrong.""  I had originally heard this as a punch line for a Nixon joke, in which someone told Nixon that Ruby shot Oswald, and Nixon merely said, ""Well, um, [muffled clearing of throat], like my mother always said, two rights don't make a wrong.""  In the joke, it was obvious that Nixon was wrong about what his mother always said, but in the movie, ""I'm not saying that two rights don't make a wrong"" approaches the complexity of legal argument.  This movie is evidence that comedy and law play to the same audience.",5,Very mental,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,1258,"['Compared', 'kind', 'intellectual', 'history', '20th', 'century', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'produced', 'even', 'compared', 'order', 'imposed', 'ideas', 'such', 'mammoth', 'books', 'THE', 'SOCIOLOGY', 'OF', 'PHILOSOPHIES', 'GLOBAL', 'THEORY', 'OF', 'INTELLECTUAL', 'CHANGE', 'Randall', 'Collins', 'movie', 'Secret', 'Honor', 'picture', 'man', 'thinking', 'pardon', 'legal', 'political', 'situation', 'bits', 'pieces', 'thoughts', 'agonizing', 'glory', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'writing', 'review', 'videotape', 'one', 'few', 'collection', 'consider', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'whenever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'what', 'videotape', 'line', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'pinpoint', 'most', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'two', 'rights', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wrong', 'had', 'originally', 'heard', 'punch', 'line', 'Nixon', 'joke', 'someone', 'told', 'Nixon', 'Ruby', 'shot', 'Oswald', 'Nixon', 'merely', 'said', 'Well', 'um', '[', 'muffled', 'clearing', 'throat', ']', 'mother', 'always', 'said', 'two', 'rights', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wrong', 'joke', 'was', 'obvious', 'Nixon', 'was', 'wrong', 'what', 'mother', 'always', 'said', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'two', 'rights', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wrong', 'complexity', 'legal', 'argument', 'movie', 'evidence', 'comedy', 'law', 'play', 'same', 'audience']",N/A

It's 1983 and Richard Nixon, late at night, is in the study of his home preparing to record his version of the events in his life. He's managed after some difficulty to connect the tape recorder. He has a tumbler of scotch at hand. As he talks he's at times playing defense attorney for Richard Nixon before an imaginary judge, at other times he's Richard Nixon explaining himself and his actions.""I wanted to be a winner because I was a loser. That's right. I'd been a failure every night of my life and that is my secret...I was a dogcatcher...yeah...I was...I am...and a...mmm...used car salesman, too...sure, sure, fine...and a siding and a shingle man and...because I knew that today the dogcatcher is king!...and all those crooks and those shysters and those mobsters and those lobsters...I mean lobbyists...and the well fed...all the welfare bums and tramps in this country...that is your palace guard. Let 'em suck on that for a while!""As the night goes by and as the scotch goes down, Nixon rails against almost everyone except his mother; against Eisenhower and Kissinger, against his brothers and his fate, against college slights and job interview turndowns, against east coast lawyers and slick big businessmen, against decisions he had to make to satisfy the secret deals he made with the Committee of 100 and the Bohemian Club crowd. Deep into the scotch he cries of the public humiliation he accepted to save his secret honor against the nightmare plans of the Committee and their smooth, wealthy, powerful members. ""My client is guilty of one thing only,"" he cries to the imaginary judge, ""of being Richard Milhous Nixon.""This 90-minute play, restaged to become a highly fluid and effective film by Robert Altman, is an absolute tour de force of solo acting by Philip Baker Hall. He doesn't much look or sound like Nixon, but his performance is stunning. His Nixon ranges seamlessly from resentment to suppressed rage to self pity to almost strangled inarticulateness. He can relish his victories with a cynical laugh and almost sob with the slights he knows he has received from others. The four-letter words are pungent, startling and frequent. Hall is just extraordinary.What are we left with? I think that anyone who admires fine acting, psychology, politics and cynicism would want this film. I doubt if anyone who hates Nixon or loves Nixon would be satisfied. I found myself feeling a little uncomfortably sympathetic.The Criterion DVD features an informative insert and several extras, including commentary by Altman and co-writer Donald Freed, as well as an on-camera and interesting interview with Hall.

291697,A1M5405JH9THP9,6302033845,golgotha.gov,"[3, 3]","SECRET HONOR (1984)directed by Robert Altmanapprox 90 minutesRichard Nixon got us out of Vietnam, bombed a neutral country, was an early proponent of civil rights in his party, probably won the popular vote in 1960 but didn't fight it, and at one point was rumored to have the highest IQ score of anyone to hold the highest office in the land.  His re-election in 1972 was a huge  landslide, but he also had some of the lowest approval ratings years later.  He's also probably one of the only genuine ""outsiders"" and ""self made men"" to get elected... and (so far) the only one to step down.  People still really hate Nixon, for various reasons, but no matter what your opinion of the man is I recommend seeing this movie.Philip Baker Hall does an amazing job as Richard Milhouse Nixon, probably the most complicated U.S. President of the 20th century.  The roles Hall has gotten in recent years don't offer him the wide range of emotions that he's capable of showing.  While the acting alone makes this movie worth viewing, the people who will probably enjoy it the most are those with a good grasp on Nixon's biography.  He addresses (in some way) every issue you can imagine, from his early smears against Helen Douglas to his cursing Kissinger and the CIA. Nixon of course had a lot to be bitter about and in this movie is literally on the defensive: the Nixon character pretends to be a lawyer defending the former President in an impeachment trial.  Issues from his Quaker background are brought up as well as his dismal childhood memories of his family.Part of the pretext of this movie is that the Nixon character tries to reveal the ""real reasons for Watergate"".  Hall weaves a sort of desperate paranoid web of intelligence and elite connections that were putting pressure on Nixon from all sides.  I'm actually shocked that the Alex Jones crowd hasn't revived this movie since there are repeated references to ""Bohemian Grove"".  The ""Committee of 100"" in this movie has some similarities with the ""Committee of 300"" described by Dr. John Coleman.Definitely a movie worth your attention.",4,"Robert Altman's ""Sympathy for the Devil""",1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2096,"['SECRET', 'HONOR', '1984', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Altmanapprox', '90', 'minutesRichard', 'Nixon', 'got', 'Vietnam', 'bombed', 'neutral', 'country', 'was', 'early', 'proponent', 'civil', 'rights', 'party', 'probably', 'won', 'popular', 'vote', '1960', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'rumored', 'have', 'highest', 'IQ', 'score', 'anyone', 'hold', 'highest', 'office', 'land', 're-election', '1972', 'was', 'huge', 'landslide', 'also', 'had', 'lowest', 'approval', 'ratings', 'years', 'later', 'also', 'probably', 'one', 'only', 'genuine', 'outsiders', 'self', 'made', 'men', 'get', 'elected', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'down', 'People', 'still', 'really', 'hate', 'Nixon', 'various', 'reasons', 'matter', 'what', 'opinion', 'man', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie.Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'amazing', 'job', 'Richard', 'Milhouse', 'Nixon', 'probably', 'most', 'complicated', 'U.S.', 'President', '20th', 'century', 'roles', 'Hall', 'gotten', 'recent', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'capable', 'showing', 'acting', 'alone', 'movie', 'worth', 'viewing', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'most', 'are', 'good', 'grasp', 'Nixon', 'biography', 'way', 'issue', 'can', 'imagine', 'early', 'smears', 'Helen', 'Douglas', 'cursing', 'Kissinger', 'CIA', 'Nixon', 'course', 'had', 'lot', 'be', 'bitter', 'movie', 'literally', 'defensive', 'Nixon', 'character', 'pretends', 'be', 'lawyer', 'defending', 'former', 'President', 'impeachment', 'trial', 'Issues', 'Quaker', 'background', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'dismal', 'childhood', 'memories', 'family.Part', 'pretext', 'movie', 'Nixon', 'character', 'tries', 'reveal', 'real', 'reasons', 'Watergate', 'Hall', 'sort', 'desperate', 'paranoid', 'web', 'intelligence', 'elite', 'connections', 'were', 'putting', 'pressure', 'Nixon', 'sides', ""'m"", 'actually', 'shocked', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'crowd', ""n't"", 'revived', 'movie', 'are', 'repeated', 'references', 'Bohemian', 'Grove', 'Committee', '100', 'movie', 'similarities', 'Committee', '300', 'described', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Coleman.Definitely', 'movie', 'attention']",N/A

291699,AW3I97UR8NP7T,6302033845,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[5, 5]","SECRET HONOR is sort of a stream of consciousness representaion of the contents of Richard Nixon's tortured psyche as his drunken mind tries to come to terms with his betrayal of his Quaker upbringing. In the quest for political power that led to his political downfall the fictional Nixon that writer Donald Freed gives is fully aware of all the compromises he has made during his career, painfully so. These compromises supposedly led Nixon to actually PLAN the botched Watergate affair as a means to leave the presidency before the excrement really hit the fan and the true depth of what Attorney General John Mitchell called ""The White House Horrors"" came to light. Why? Because the real crimes being committed were hanging offences; the CIA was engaged in smuggling dope, CREEP (the Committee to Re-Elect the President) was collecting money AFTER his election because they were planning a 3rd term for Nixon to be funded by that drug money, and worst of all they wanted him office for the purpose of continuing the Vietnam war for at least 8 more years for their own financial gain. Even Nixon couldn't live with that. So what Freed and director Altman give us in SECRET HONOR is a look inside the troubled mind of the deposed President as he rants and raves and reflects upon everthing from the Kennedys to Communism to his hatred for the Eastern Establishment and the Rocefellers until he finally comes to the only conclusion a man like Richard Nixon could ever reach.The Criterion special treatment adds two commentary tracks and background footage of the real Richard Nixon for those who need a refresher course in history. The commentaries are by Altman and writer Donald Freed and give quite a bit of insight into the making of the film as well as some additional political insights. Also included is a making of featurette that shows the special camera Altman used that enabled him to add a feeling of real life to what might ordinarily have been just another stagebound one man show. Also included is a segment with actor Philip Baker Hall whose magnificent bravura performance is probably this film's entire raison d'etre. While he only vaguely resembles Nixon at the best of times and never sounds like him, Hall still manages to capture the essence of the Nixon we all remember and he takes the character to operatic heights and the depths of dispair.I can't say that I buy the theories that the movie puts forth for a second, but it still provides an interesting take on one of the more fascinating characters in American political history. While Oliver Stone's film NIXON genuinely made me sympathetic towards the man, SECRET HONOR with its portrayal of Nixon unconqerable to the very end tried to strike up some sympathy but succeeded only in entertaining.",4,A Very Big Secret,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,2775,"['SECRET', 'HONOR', 'sort', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'representaion', 'contents', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'tortured', 'psyche', 'drunken', 'mind', 'tries', 'come', 'terms', 'betrayal', 'Quaker', 'upbringing', 'quest', 'political', 'power', 'led', 'political', 'downfall', 'fictional', 'Nixon', 'writer', 'Donald', 'Freed', 'fully', 'aware', 'compromises', 'made', 'career', 'painfully', 'so', 'compromises', 'supposedly', 'led', 'Nixon', 'actually', 'PLAN', 'botched', 'Watergate', 'affair', 'means', 'leave', 'presidency', 'excrement', 'really', 'hit', 'fan', 'true', 'depth', 'what', 'Attorney', 'General', 'John', 'Mitchell', 'called', 'White', 'House', 'Horrors', 'came', 'light', 'Why', 'real', 'crimes', 'being', 'committed', 'were', 'hanging', 'offences', 'CIA', 'was', 'engaged', 'smuggling', 'dope', 'CREEP', 'Committee', 'Re-Elect', 'President', 'was', 'collecting', 'money', 'AFTER', 'election', 'were', 'planning', '3rd', 'term', 'Nixon', 'be', 'funded', 'drug', 'money', 'worst', 'wanted', 'office', 'purpose', 'continuing', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'least', '8', 'more', 'years', 'own', 'financial', 'gain', 'Even', 'Nixon', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'So', 'what', 'Freed', 'director', 'Altman', 'give', 'SECRET', 'HONOR', 'look', 'troubled', 'mind', 'deposed', 'President', 'raves', 'upon', 'everthing', 'Kennedys', 'Communism', 'hatred', 'Eastern', 'Establishment', 'Rocefellers', 'finally', 'only', 'conclusion', 'man', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'could', 'ever', 'reach.The', 'Criterion', 'special', 'treatment', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'background', 'footage', 'real', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'who', 'need', 'refresher', 'course', 'history', 'commentaries', 'are', 'Altman', 'writer', 'Donald', 'Freed', 'give', 'quite', 'bit', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'additional', 'political', 'insights', 'Also', 'included', 'making', 'featurette', 'special', 'camera', 'Altman', 'used', 'enabled', 'add', 'feeling', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'might', 'ordinarily', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'stagebound', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'Also', 'included', 'segment', 'actor', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'magnificent', 'bravura', 'performance', 'probably', 'film', 'entire', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'only', 'vaguely', 'Nixon', 'best', 'times', 'never', 'sounds', 'Hall', 'still', 'capture', 'essence', 'Nixon', 'remember', 'character', 'operatic', 'heights', 'depths', 'dispair.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'buy', 'theories', 'movie', 'forth', 'second', 'still', 'interesting', 'take', 'one', 'more', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'American', 'political', 'history', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'NIXON', 'genuinely', 'made', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'SECRET', 'HONOR', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'unconqerable', 'very', 'end', 'tried', 'strike', 'up', 'sympathy', 'succeeded', 'only', 'entertaining']",N/A
291700,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6302033845,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Before his resurgence with ""The Player,"" there was a time when Robert Altman was out of fashion in Hollywood following the disastrous ""Popeye"" in 1980. During that period, he still did some interesting work--most notably a few filmed adaptations of plays and ""Tanner '88"" for HBO. ""Tanner '88,"" in my opinion, is one of the most brilliant, politically astute pieces ever made--it really captured a moment in time (however fictionalized). Among his adaptations --""Streamers,"" ""Come Back To The Five And Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"" and ""Fool For Love"" were entertaining, if flawed. Super dramatic and overripe--I love these films, but their theatrical roots really show. Perhaps his most significant adaptation, however, was ""Secret Honor.""""Secret Honor"" is essentially a one man show. A fictional Richard Nixon contemplates his life and the failings in his political career. Shooting through every emotion, we're offered insight into many of the significant historical events of his day. We see a proud, yet paranoid, individual--one that has seemingly played a political pawn. For ninety minutes, he rambles and rants--and you've probably never seen anything like it before on film. Philip Baker Hall gives one heck of a blistering performance. It's probably one of the greatest unknown or unremembered performances of all time.And here, I'm almost ashamed to admit--I just don't get much entertainment value from this film. I've seen it several times now--I recognize it's merit--I just don't connect with it. Altman has made a sly and significant film--it just isn't for me. Altman was one of my early heroes--as a kid, ""Nashville"" was a picture that redefined movies for me, that opened up narrative structure in a way that I'd never seen before. And I see the importance of ""Secret Honor"" as well--but I think it's appeal is more limited.Obviously any cinema buff should check it out. It's worth it for Hall's terrific performance, if nothing else. Anyone interested in history or Nixon specifically might also get value and entertainment from this film.

291701,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6302033845,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 4]","Secret Honor depicts a fictional version of President Richard M. Nixon's persona portrayed by Philip Baker Hall as he records an approximately 90-minute long statement, one late night, in which it seems he attempts to rid himself of the demons that haunt him.  The setting is Nixon's personal office some time after his resignation from the Presidential position of United States, while gurgling down Scottish Whisky as if it was water.  All this is caught by a video camera with four monitors through which Nixon can observe himself as he speaks his mind.  Nixon addresses an imaginary judge as he conveys secrets and his opinion on many significant individuals.The speech which Nixon provides to the audience travels a journey that seems to be of a completely diverging nature as Nixon's paranoid nature reveals itself through his monologue into the microphone.  The sentences either begin or end with profanity as Nixon talks to the imaginary judge, which also seems to reveal the amount of stress that he experienced.  Whenever Nixon begins something he ends up changing the topic as frequently as he names someone's name.  This incoherent thought processing might be compared to some schizophrenics that suffers from delusions and severe paranoia, which also brings the notion of fear to have someone like this as president of a country.  Nonetheless, it is with both bewilderment and compassion that the audience will view Nixon who is a beaten man that seems to seek redemption on one late evening.  The monologue exposes secrets including high treason, corruption, conspiracies, sex scandals, murder by governmental agencies, and much more.Secret Honor was intended for television as it also was a part of a film class that Robert Altman taught at the University of Michigan.  Altman who is known for making films with big casts such as in MASH (1970), Nashville (1975), Short Cuts (1993), and Gosford Park (2001) makes a directorial transformation as he only casts Philip Baker Hall in Secret Honor.  Hall does an extraordinary job in bringing life to Nixon, and he does it with such energy that the audience will believe that the story is real.  The change of having only one actor in the film does not affect the story as Altman's eye for the mise-en-scene helps in providing an authentic feel for what is taking place within the camera's frame.  However, it is Hall that makes the film as he brings the audience a character study that should not be forgotten as the story leaves several notions to ponder.",4,Interesting Fictional Monologue by Incoherent Nixon...,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,2517,"['Secret', 'Honor', 'fictional', 'version', 'President', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Nixon', 'persona', 'portrayed', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'approximately', '90-minute', 'long', 'statement', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'rid', 'demons', 'haunt', 'setting', 'Nixon', 'personal', 'office', 'time', 'resignation', 'Presidential', 'position', 'United', 'States', 'gurgling', 'down', 'Scottish', 'Whisky', 'was', 'water', 'caught', 'video', 'camera', 'four', 'monitors', 'Nixon', 'can', 'observe', 'mind', 'Nixon', 'imaginary', 'judge', 'secrets', 'opinion', 'many', 'significant', 'individuals.The', 'speech', 'Nixon', 'audience', 'journey', 'be', 'completely', 'diverging', 'nature', 'Nixon', 'paranoid', 'nature', 'reveals', 'monologue', 'microphone', 'sentences', 'begin', 'end', 'profanity', 'Nixon', 'talks', 'imaginary', 'judge', 'also', 'reveal', 'amount', 'stress', 'experienced', 'Whenever', 'Nixon', 'something', 'up', 'changing', 'topic', 'as', 'frequently', 'someone', 'name', 'incoherent', 'thought', 'processing', 'might', 'be', 'compared', 'schizophrenics', 'suffers', 'delusions', 'severe', 'paranoia', 'also', 'notion', 'fear', 'have', 'someone', 'like', 'president', 'country', 'Nonetheless', 'bewilderment', 'compassion', 'audience', 'will', 'view', 'Nixon', 'who', 'beaten', 'man', 'seek', 'redemption', 'one', 'late', 'evening', 'monologue', 'secrets', 'including', 'high', 'treason', 'corruption', 'conspiracies', 'sex', 'scandals', 'murder', 'governmental', 'agencies', 'much', 'more.Secret', 'Honor', 'was', 'intended', 'television', 'also', 'was', 'part', 'film', 'class', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'taught', 'University', 'Michigan', 'Altman', 'who', 'known', 'making', 'films', 'big', 'casts', 'such', 'MASH', '1970', 'Nashville', '1975', 'Short', 'Cuts', '1993', 'Gosford', 'Park', '2001', 'directorial', 'transformation', 'only', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Secret', 'Honor', 'Hall', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'Nixon', 'such', 'energy', 'audience', 'will', 'believe', 'story', 'real', 'change', 'having', 'only', 'one', 'actor', 'film', 'not', 'affect', 'story', 'Altman', 'eye', 'mise-en-scene', 'providing', 'authentic', 'feel', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'camera', 'frame', 'However', 'Hall', 'film', 'audience', 'character', 'study', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'story', 'several', 'notions', 'ponder']",N/A
291702,A1IBMUD9XXD68X,6302033845,"Michael E. Kreca ""mkreca@earthlink.net""","[12, 14]","I just finished viewing this incredible, astoundingly intense motion picture for the very first time after hearing about it for 20 years. Philip Baker Hall (who played the character of ""Library Cop"" on ""Seinfeld"") essays the part of Richard Nixon in an unforgettable one actor performance. The film had been shot at the Univ. of Michigan, the crew composed largely of UM students, while director Robert Altman was doing a short hitch as filmmaker-in-residence there and has the interesting, ""you are there"" immediacy and intimacy of a filmed stage play or TV show.The set is a large, wood paneled office, apparently in Nixon's home in San Clemente, a few months after his August 1974 resignation from the Presidency. An angry and restless Nixon nervously paces back and forth with a glass of scotch whiskey in one hand and a loaded revolver lying on his desk, yelling angrily into a running tape recorder about the details of his childhood, adult life, controversial political career, his deep and unhealed resentments and miseries, repeatedly hurling a stream of caustic invective at portraits of Dwight Eisenhower, Jack Kennedy and Henry Kissinger, reserving most of his vitriolic (yet fascinating and perceptive) bile for Kissinger, rarely (typically) blaming himself for his own misdeeds, all the while intermittently and nervously scanning a battery of CCTV monitors whose cameras are already observing and recording him. Nixon on several occasions mentions the mysterious ""Bohemian Grove"" located in rural northern California (a subject of much ""conspiracy theorizing"" in recent years.)This film is a must see, if for no other reason to experience Hall's stunning and overwhelming performance as the desperate and doomed Tricky Dick, to appreciate Altman's unique cinematographic and directorial style and to vividly grasp the nature of an bafflingly influential human and cultural ""focal point"" in recent American history. Additionally, whether one is or isn't a Nixon hater, after finishing this film one may gain some understanding of and deeper insight into if not grudging respect or sympathy for this undoubtedly gifted and highly skilled yet incredibly tormented and angry man whose character, behavior and personality was a rare and corrosive but powerful and unforgettable blend of all of the tragic protagonists that had ever emerged from the works of Shakespeare, Dostoevski and Conrad to Fitzgerald, Beckett and Pirandello.Hall's Richard Nixon, like Marlon Brando's character of Col. Walter Kurtz in 1979's ""Apocalypse Now"" is a poignant and intense collage of what some might term a classic ""American archetype;"" a brooding and obsessive ""failed overachiever"" whose single-minded drive to reach that nebulous yet seductive goal of ""being somebody"" had been completely and irreparably derailed at the final bend by the same volatile forces that had also driven him relentlessly and vindictively toward that goal, leaving all sorts of tragic wreckage, human and political, in his wake. Was Nixon good, bad, both, neither or something else altogether? And finally, from the opening scene of ""Secret Honor,"" a more specific and pointed question arises, one that persists all the way to the film's final two words: Is there a little bit of Dick Nixon in all of us?",5,An American Archetype?,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,3278,"['just', 'finished', 'viewing', 'incredible', 'astoundingly', 'intense', 'motion', 'picture', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'hearing', '20', 'years', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'Library', 'Cop', 'Seinfeld', 'part', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'actor', 'performance', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'Univ', 'Michigan', 'crew', 'composed', 'largely', 'UM', 'students', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'was', 'doing', 'short', 'hitch', 'filmmaker-in-residence', 'interesting', 'are', 'there', 'immediacy', 'intimacy', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'TV', 'show.The', 'set', 'large', 'wood', 'paneled', 'office', 'apparently', 'Nixon', 'home', 'San', 'Clemente', 'few', 'months', 'August', '1974', 'resignation', 'Presidency', 'angry', 'restless', 'Nixon', 'nervously', 'back', 'forth', 'glass', 'scotch', 'whiskey', 'one', 'hand', 'loaded', 'revolver', 'lying', 'desk', 'yelling', 'angrily', 'running', 'tape', 'recorder', 'details', 'childhood', 'adult', 'life', 'controversial', 'political', 'career', 'deep', 'unhealed', 'resentments', 'miseries', 'repeatedly', 'hurling', 'stream', 'caustic', 'invective', 'portraits', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'reserving', 'most', 'vitriolic', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'perceptive', 'bile', 'Kissinger', 'rarely', 'typically', 'blaming', 'own', 'misdeeds', 'while', 'intermittently', 'nervously', 'scanning', 'battery', 'CCTV', 'monitors', 'cameras', 'are', 'already', 'observing', 'recording', 'Nixon', 'several', 'occasions', 'mentions', 'mysterious', 'Bohemian', 'Grove', 'located', 'rural', 'northern', 'California', 'subject', 'much', 'conspiracy', 'theorizing', 'recent', 'years', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'other', 'reason', 'experience', 'Hall', 'stunning', 'overwhelming', 'performance', 'desperate', 'doomed', 'Tricky', 'Dick', 'appreciate', 'Altman', 'unique', 'cinematographic', 'directorial', 'style', 'vividly', 'grasp', 'nature', 'bafflingly', 'influential', 'human', 'cultural', 'focal', 'point', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'Additionally', 'one', ""n't"", 'Nixon', 'hater', 'finishing', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'gain', 'understanding', 'deeper', 'insight', 'not', 'grudging', 'respect', 'sympathy', 'undoubtedly', 'gifted', 'highly', 'skilled', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'tormented', 'angry', 'man', 'character', 'behavior', 'personality', 'was', 'rare', 'corrosive', 'powerful', 'unforgettable', 'blend', 'tragic', 'protagonists', 'had', 'ever', 'emerged', 'works', 'Shakespeare', 'Dostoevski', 'Conrad', 'Fitzgerald', 'Beckett', 'Pirandello.Hall', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'character', 'Col.', 'Walter', 'Kurtz', '1979', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'poignant', 'intense', 'collage', 'what', 'might', 'term', 'classic', 'American', 'archetype', 'brooding', 'obsessive', 'failed', 'overachiever', 'single-minded', 'drive', 'reach', 'nebulous', 'yet', 'seductive', 'goal', 'being', 'somebody', 'had', 'been', 'completely', 'irreparably', 'derailed', 'final', 'bend', 'same', 'volatile', 'forces', 'had', 'also', 'driven', 'relentlessly', 'vindictively', 'goal', 'leaving', 'sorts', 'tragic', 'wreckage', 'human', 'political', 'wake', 'Was', 'Nixon', 'good', 'bad', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'finally', 'opening', 'scene', 'Secret', 'Honor', 'more', 'specific', 'pointed', 'question', 'arises', 'one', 'way', 'film', 'final', 'two', 'words', 'little', 'bit', 'Dick', 'Nixon']",N/A

In his private office suite years after leaving the White House, he strides back and forth holding forth on how, by resigning, he saved the country from sinister right wing forces similar to Daddy Warbucks of the old Little Orphan Annie comic strip. It's an indignant Nixon certain he's saved America from a right wing coup by his resignation and he dare not disclose this to anybody --- thus the ""secret honor"" of his self-sacrifice. Yet it's NOT a ""mad dog"" portrayal, but a sympathetic one, dwelling on a man battered by larger forces, great and small.  (""Ike once introduced me to a crowd as Nick Dixon, for Christ's sake!"")

291706,AK61LQI92GTCH,6302033845,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[16, 18]","SECRET HONOR invites us to spend an intimate evening alone with the only man ever to resign the presidency, Richard Nixon.  The Criterion disk contains a bunch of extras, including an hour and twenty-some minutes worth of Nixon, the real Nixon, on videotape and kinescope.  It surveys a number of his speeches, beginning with the Fund Crisis (`Checkers') Speech in 1952 and ending with his August 9, 1974 Farewell Speech to the White House Staff.  Also included is a newspaper managing editors' question and answer session, from 1973, in which Nixon first told us ""I am not a crook.""  If you're new to Nixon, or need a refresher course in Nixonia, I strongly suggest you watch these before watching the movie.  A few politicians are, maybe once in their career, forced to make an embarrassing speech confessing a personal weakness or transgression.  Nixon seemed to have made a career out of such speeches, and this tip-of-the-iceberg special feature gives a good sense of Nixon's personal debasement style. SECRET HONOR takes place sometime in the late 1970s, and is an intimate, post-resignation evening spent with Richard Nixon.  Philip Baker Hall put his star on the map with his interpretation of the ex-president.  He begins the evening with a glass of sherry, which isn't quite Nixon's style.  Scotch, and then more scotch, puts slick in his lick and leads to a fascinating, free-ranging, ninety-minute rant against the world.One man shows can be bad enough on stage.  When made into movies even the good ones can be nearly unbearable.  SECRET HONOR avoids all the pitfalls. For one thing, Robert Altman is a canny enough director to devise ways to keep us visually interested in what's going on.  During the 20-some minute special feature interview with Philip Baker Hall we see photographs of Altman's unique camera contraption - a 16-mm camera mounted on some sort of flying jib that more or less becomes Hall's dance partner.  It provides the cameraman with great mobility and flexibility.  Along with the fluid camera the script is a great help, as well.  Let's face it - the big question in one man shows is ""What is he doing there?""  Usually the Great Person is decked out in period regalia, maintains eye contact with the audience for the duration, and spends most of his time recounting Great Event after Great Event.  As Altman says on his commentary track, it's all a little too precious.  SECRET HONOR avoids the one-man trap by having Nixon, appropriately enough, speaking into a tape recorder, explaining himself to someone.  We're never sure who that someone is, perhaps his mother, perhaps with all the `Your Honors' and `my clients' in the monologue, it's a judge of some type. It seems some post-pardon defense is, as they say, being strategized.  Either way it's an inspired approach.I think some people still have strong feelings, positive or negative, about Richard Nixon.  Nixon haters and Nixon lovers might have some problems with this movie because Nixon comes across as both fatally flawed yet somewhat tragic.  Hall, Altman and the script combine to make this a fascinating 90-minutes for anyone with memories of or an interest in the Nixon Presidency.

Included are his famous ""Checkers"" speech, a 1968 campaign Q&A; session, his announcement of releasing Watergate documents, his resignation speech, and his farewell address to the White House staff.Though the film portrays Nixon in a bad light, it is fiction, and the special features are wonderful.",3,an unusual but interesting film,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,1191,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film.Secret', 'Honor', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Donald', 'Freed', 'Arnold', 'M.', 'Stone', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'reprised', 'role', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'stage', 'performance', 'only', 'person', 'film.The', 'film', 'fictitious', 'account', 'former', 'President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'alone', 'study', 'speaking', 'microphone', 'recording', 'many', 'things', 'many', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'only', 'story.I', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'way', 'mostly', 'filmed', 'only', 'one', 'room', 'similar', 'style', 'filming', 'Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'quite', 'bit', 'addition', 'interview', 'actor', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'co-writer', 'Donald', 'Freed', 'archive', 'footage', 'real', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'well', 'known', 'television', 'appearances', 'Included', 'are', 'famous', 'Checkers', 'speech', '1968', 'campaign', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'announcement', 'releasing', 'Watergate', 'documents', 'resignation', 'speech', 'farewell', 'address', 'White', 'House', 'staff.Though', 'film', 'Nixon', 'bad', 'light', 'fiction', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'wonderful']",N/A

His portrayal of Nixon covers all the bases, from quiet obedience to his beloved mother to the snarling, foul mouthed paranoiac we've all come to love (or hate). The film is riveting as Hall's Nixon drags the audience deeper and deeper into his harsh world view and finally brings us to the very edge of his despair. The end will have you laughing, cringing or both. Brings into sharp relief the concept that we are all heroes in our own mind, and it will make you wonder what sort of spirit dwells in the leaders we currently elect if a man this twisted with hate, self loathing and paranoia could be elected president twice. Just an amazing film. Even if you don't subscribe to Hall's portrayal as reality you can't deny that this a talented and powerful performance.
