I love #4 because it moves quickly, the pace is great and is fun!!  Best of all you really sweat to burn the fat!!!  I should know.  I've lost nearly thirty pounds with Richard!  Of course you have to do the work out a few times before you get the routines down pat but they are easy to learn....with maybe one exception....on the routine for ""The Wanderer"" the moves were very intricate and I just need to practice more with it but I know I will eventually have it down pat.  As RIchard would say, ""Don't give up.  You'll get there!""  God Bless Richard Simmons.",5,GREAT ROUTINES!!!,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,655,"['love', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'have', 'Sweating', 'Oldies', 'DVDs', 'are', 'great', 'love', '4', 'quickly', 'pace', 'great', 'fun', 'Best', 'really', 'sweat', 'burn', 'fat', 'should', 'know', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'pounds', 'Richard', 'course', 'have', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'routines', 'down', 'pat', 'are', 'easy', 'learn', 'maybe', 'one', 'exception', 'routine', 'Wanderer', 'moves', 'were', 'very', 'intricate', 'just', 'need', 'practice', 'more', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'have', 'down', 'pat', 'RIchard', 'would', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there', 'God', 'Bless', 'Richard', 'Simmons']",N/A

This one has a more vigorous middle section, no heart rate check points, with an side column that lets you know what songs give you a more strenuous workout. Really enjoy these tapes by Richard as they are fun and he gives good direction to what is coming up.  It takes me a while to catch on to all the steps, but you don't have to be perfect, just keep moving and enjoy!",4,"Good Music, More Vigorous Workout",1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,435,"['love', 'first', 'Sweatin', 'DVD', 'best', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'more', 'vigorous', 'middle', 'section', 'heart', 'rate', 'check', 'points', 'side', 'column', 'know', 'what', 'give', 'more', 'strenuous', 'workout', 'Really', 'enjoy', 'tapes', 'Richard', 'are', 'fun', 'good', 'direction', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'while', 'catch', 'steps', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'perfect', 'just', 'keep', 'moving', 'enjoy']",N/A

Great oldies music, although I prefer the music selection from the first three more, but the dancing is just as fun. Most of the moves are a variation of moves from the previous videos, so you should be able to pick them up quickly, especially if you've done number three. There is also an interview, a roundtable discussion, and you can see some of Richard's present students and how they've been inspired by him. It's just all around fun and highly recommended.",5,Another great one!,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,580,"['great', 'Sweatin', 'video', 'even', 'huge', 'gospel', 'choir', 'time', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'Great', 'oldies', 'music', 'prefer', 'music', 'selection', 'first', 'three', 'more', 'dancing', 'just', 'fun', 'Most', 'moves', 'are', 'variation', 'moves', 'previous', 'videos', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'quickly', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'done', 'number', 'three', 'also', 'interview', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'can', 'see', 'Richard', 'present', 'students', 'how', ""'ve"", 'been', 'inspired', 'just', 'fun', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
