Beautiful Boy is the story of a depressed College student who does the unthinkable and his recently separated parents played brilliantly by Martin Sheen and Maria Bello, have to find a way to cope and deal with this son's unimaginable act. Beautiful Boy cuts right to the heart and bone and never sugarcoats, there are some tough scenes but they are moving and so real. Sheen and Bello are absolute perfection, they have never been better.

They are the parents of a son who is away at college. One night their son calls and you can see that something is weighing heavily on his mind but neither parent picks up on his distress and talks to him about taking their next family vaction, just like everything is normal.The next day as the couple carries on with their boring day their lives are completely turned around when they find out a massacre has occurred on the campus of their son's school, but when all the details are revealed this is where the story really pulls you in and holds you their until the end.This movie is so emotional and it makes you as the viewer wonder what if you were in this situation how would you handle it. I loved the passion that the actors had and the movie itself made you feel what this couple is going through.

1453607,AQIBFWWA8UWKF,B005CA4SA6,"Amazon Customer ""Book aholic""","[0, 0]","I was drawn to this dvd because I had just read the book Columbine.  I have always felt sorry for the parents of the kids that have done these horrific deeds.  We as a society have to find blame somewhere and so many times in these instances it ""has"" to be the parents fault.This movie looks at what the parents of a school shooter goes through in the aftermath of the shooting.  This is not a light subject and I found myself turning the movie off several times just so I could get away from the heaviness.Like so many parents in this day and age, Bill and Kate have done the best they know how to raise their son.  And like so many people now a days they have grown apart from the everyday grind that is life.  They know that they haven't heard from their son as much as they would like but he is in college now so it is to be expected.  They do not pick up on the fact that he is very upset when he calls, but we as the audience can see it in his face and manner.  They try desparately to get in touch with him when they hear that there is a shooting at his college but he never picks up his phone.  Only when the police come do they realize that it is their son who has done this horrible thing.The rest of movie examines how the shooting effects each of the members of their family, including Kate's brother's family especially their young nephew.  Bill and Kate run the whole gamit from denial to blaming each other.*spoiler*The most heartwrenching scene for me was when Bill went to visit his sons grave and someone had spray painted Killer on the grave stone and he was desparetly was trying to get it off.*end spoiler*This movie shows that no matter how good of parents we are, that our children may make some very bad decisions.  And that we as a society need to stop trying to blame everyone else but the actual person who commits the deed.Despite the heaviness this was an excellent movie.  It is rated R for some language and sexual situation but not to much of either.  Definately would not recommend for any one under 16 but I would let my 16 year old watch it with a discussion afterward.",4,Heavy,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,2104,"['was', 'drawn', 'dvd', 'had', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'Columbine', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'sorry', 'parents', 'kids', 'have', 'done', 'horrific', 'deeds', 'society', 'have', 'find', 'blame', 'somewhere', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'instances', 'be', 'parents', 'fault.This', 'movie', 'what', 'parents', 'school', 'shooter', 'aftermath', 'shooting', 'not', 'light', 'subject', 'found', 'turning', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'heaviness.Like', 'so', 'many', 'parents', 'day', 'age', 'Bill', 'Kate', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'know', 'how', 'raise', 'son', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'now', 'days', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'everyday', 'grind', 'life', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'son', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'college', 'now', 'be', 'expected', 'do', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'fact', 'very', 'upset', 'when', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'manner', 'try', 'desparately', 'get', 'touch', 'when', 'hear', 'shooting', 'college', 'never', 'up', 'phone', 'Only', 'when', 'police', 'come', 'do', 'realize', 'son', 'who', 'done', 'horrible', 'thing.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'how', 'shooting', 'effects', 'members', 'family', 'including', 'Kate', 'brother', 'family', 'especially', 'young', 'nephew', 'Bill', 'Kate', 'run', 'whole', 'gamit', 'denial', 'blaming', 'other', 'most', 'heartwrenching', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Bill', 'went', 'visit', 'sons', 'grave', 'someone', 'had', 'spray', 'painted', 'Killer', 'grave', 'stone', 'was', 'desparetly', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'off', '*end', 'spoiler*This', 'movie', 'shows', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'parents', 'are', 'children', 'may', 'make', 'very', 'bad', 'decisions', 'society', 'need', 'stop', 'trying', 'blame', 'everyone', 'else', 'actual', 'person', 'who', 'deed.Despite', 'heaviness', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'sexual', 'situation', 'not', 'much', 'Definately', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'one', '16', 'would', 'let', '16', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'discussion', 'afterward']",N/A

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","While I don't want to be *too* harsh on a movie that clearly sets out to be emotional (and it succeeds in that respect) and of course, given the sensitive subject matter concerning a kid who goes crazy and shoots up his college classmates, this is another reason I don't want to be too critical, but the thing is, Beautiful Boy fails to leave me feeling satisfied.  It's about how the parents react and cope with their son being the one responsible for a college shooting.As a parent, it's just unfathomable to believe it's your own child who was the shooter.  You don't want to believe it- you *refuse* to believe it.  While it makes sense that the mother felt an uncontrollable and overwhelming feeling of sadness when the police knocked on her door to deliver the dreaded news that her son is dead, it didn't seem realistic that the father would hide in the background and not feeling any emotion whatsoever.  He didn't even feel the need to comfort his wife during this moment.  Really strange.However, and maybe I'm totally off track here, I sort of expected the parents of the victims to be pretty angry and not hesitate to place blame on the parents.  I expected a fairly large chunk of storytelling to focus strictly on their bitter anger.  I figured during one particular basketball game, the kids would pick a fight with the father who went out there to blow off steam but... they don't.  Instead the father walks to his car and cries.Simply put, Beautify Boy is an emotional take on a major tragedy.  Angry feelings crops up sometimes but for the most part, it focuses around the parents coping with their emotions and trying to figure out their place in the world after such a tragedy.The good news is that there's storyline consistency when it concerns other aspects, such as the parents eventually coming to the realization that they must start over and live somewhere else as the best means to get away from it all.  That's about the best thing parents can do.  Also, it was never really stated (unless I missed it) what made their son go on a violent shooting rampage.  I admit I may have missed this part, however.  Not enough devotion to their son.Overall, emotionally devastating, but not as much as one would expect.  You can pretty much guess the parents reaction since for the most part their feelings are believable (at least, the mother's reaction- however the father does eventually release an emotional outburst of sadness near the end which is appropriate and necessary).  I still recommend it however.",3,drags sometimes,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,2529,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', '*too*', 'harsh', 'movie', 'clearly', 'out', 'be', 'emotional', 'respect', 'course', 'given', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'concerning', 'kid', 'who', 'crazy', 'shoots', 'up', 'college', 'classmates', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'too', 'critical', 'thing', 'Beautiful', 'Boy', 'leave', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'how', 'parents', 'react', 'cope', 'son', 'being', 'one', 'responsible', 'college', 'shooting.As', 'parent', 'just', 'unfathomable', 'believe', 'own', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'shooter', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'it-', '*refuse*', 'believe', 'sense', 'mother', 'felt', 'uncontrollable', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'when', 'police', 'knocked', 'door', 'deliver', 'dreaded', 'news', 'son', 'dead', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'father', 'would', 'hide', 'background', 'not', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'whatsoever', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'need', 'comfort', 'wife', 'moment', 'Really', 'strange.However', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'totally', 'off', 'track', 'here', 'sort', 'expected', 'parents', 'victims', 'be', 'pretty', 'angry', 'not', 'hesitate', 'place', 'blame', 'parents', 'expected', 'fairly', 'large', 'chunk', 'storytelling', 'focus', 'strictly', 'bitter', 'anger', 'figured', 'one', 'particular', 'basketball', 'game', 'kids', 'would', 'pick', 'fight', 'father', 'who', 'went', 'out', 'there', 'blow', 'off', 'steam', 'do', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'father', 'walks', 'car', 'cries.Simply', 'put', 'Beautify', 'Boy', 'emotional', 'take', 'major', 'tragedy', 'Angry', 'feelings', 'crops', 'up', 'sometimes', 'most', 'part', 'parents', 'coping', 'emotions', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'place', 'world', 'tragedy.The', 'good', 'news', 'storyline', 'consistency', 'when', 'other', 'aspects', 'such', 'parents', 'eventually', 'coming', 'realization', 'must', 'start', 'live', 'somewhere', 'else', 'best', 'means', 'get', 'away', 'best', 'thing', 'parents', 'can', 'do', 'Also', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'stated', 'missed', 'what', 'made', 'son', 'go', 'violent', 'shooting', 'rampage', 'admit', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'part', 'however', 'Not', 'enough', 'devotion', 'son.Overall', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'parents', 'reaction', 'most', 'part', 'feelings', 'are', 'believable', 'least', 'mother', 'reaction-', 'however', 'father', 'eventually', 'release', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'sadness', 'end', 'appropriate', 'necessary', 'still', 'recommend', 'however']",N/A

That's usually right when schizophrenia symptoms start to manifest in young men.So no, in a lot of cases I think the parents raise the kids just fine and are just as baffled by what happened as everyone else.I know it's of little comfort to the victims families but all too often the warning signs of mental illness go unnoticed.The only thing we can really learn from tragedies like this are to better recognize the symptoms as well as finding better ways to treat people who are mentally ill before things escalate to such violence.This was a very difficult movie for me to make it through.If you cry easily, you better have tissue near by.I did.A powerful and disturbing movie that I'm glad I saw.I probably won't ever watch it again it was too depressing.It definitely left a mark on me.Very sad.As I said before I, like many pointed my finger of judgement at the parents.That wasn't fair of me or anyone else to do.Sometimes there are answers.Sometimes there aren't.Sometimes the answers, like mental illness only become apparent after the fact.This movie made me think.It made me cry.It makes me hope that we find better ways of helping people around us who are in need of it.An amazing and powerful movie.Recommended.",5,Disturbing.,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2020,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'out', 'way.Brilliant', 'acting.Amazing', 'direction.Pacing', 'score', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'was', 'brilliant.Definitely', 'worth', 'watch.Here', 'why', 'movie', 'average', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'college', 'age', 'kid', 'snaps', 'school', 'shooting', 'rampage', 'taking', 'own', 'life.My', 'memories', 'Columbine', 'other', 'various', 'school', 'shootings', 'years', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'fresh', 'mind.The', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'wondered', 'was', 'how', 'families', 'related', 'shooters', 'dealt', 'what', 'had', 'happened.I', 'think', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'what', 'families', 'go', 'through.When', 'Columbine', 'happened', 'like', 'many', 'was', 'first', 'point', 'finger', 'parents.But', 'what', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'lot', 'shooters', ""'re"", 'almost', 'always', 'late', 'teens', 'early', 'twenties', 'usually', 'right', 'when', 'schizophrenia', 'symptoms', 'start', 'manifest', 'young', 'men.So', 'lot', 'cases', 'think', 'parents', 'raise', 'kids', 'just', 'fine', 'are', 'just', 'baffled', 'what', 'happened', 'everyone', 'else.I', 'know', 'little', 'comfort', 'victims', 'families', 'too', 'often', 'warning', 'signs', 'mental', 'illness', 'go', 'unnoticed.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'really', 'learn', 'tragedies', 'are', 'better', 'recognize', 'symptoms', 'as', 'well', 'finding', 'better', 'ways', 'treat', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'mentally', 'ill', 'things', 'escalate', 'such', 'violence.This', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'movie', 'make', 'through.If', 'cry', 'easily', 'better', 'have', 'tissue', 'by.I', 'did.A', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw.I', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'too', 'depressing.It', 'definitely', 'left', 'mark', 'me.Very', 'sad.As', 'said', 'many', 'pointed', 'finger', 'judgement', 'parents.That', 'was', ""n't"", 'fair', 'anyone', 'else', 'do.Sometimes', 'are', 'answers.Sometimes', 'there', 'answers', 'mental', 'illness', 'only', 'become', 'apparent', 'fact.This', 'movie', 'made', 'think.It', 'made', 'cry.It', 'hope', 'find', 'better', 'ways', 'helping', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'need', 'it.An', 'amazing', 'powerful', 'movie.Recommended']",N/A

While watching this film the thought occured to me that both Michael Sheen and Maria Bello are terrific actors, but this film is not the right one for either of them.  Bello seems to always wear a weary, skeptical expression in her roles; she always seems ready to crack wise.  This is just the way she looks I guess.  It is not a good look for her character here as she is portraying a grieving mother who is struggling with her marriage.  Michael Sheen lets slip his Britich accent occasionally; more inportantly, his character is weak in many ways but he seems unconvincing in that role.

The scenario is one that every family experiences when their child or loved one commits mass murder and then kills him/herself.  Everyone involved becomes an unwitting victim to other peoples' emotions.  Do not watch this during the Holidays.The lead roles, convincingly acted by Maria Bello and Michael Sheen, are both believable characters.  They are an affluent couple in a large home.  Both have good jobs.  The viewer learns right away that the marriage is in trouble (the pair sleeps in separate beds) and that their son seems depressed over something (his parent's marriage?).  Thirteen minutes into the movie, the viewer learns that he died on the university campus during the massacre and that he was the murderer.  He had called his parents just the night before.  How do the parents cope with this news becomes the premise of this film.What could have been a typical scream and cry drama involving a mass killer turns into a psychological drama of a grieving couple. They deal with the media's biased descriptions of their dead son; they deal with their own loss and guilt with friends, family, co-workers and especially between each other and themselves.  Both husband and wife have different ways of coping with their grief, and the stronger of the two is not revealed until the very end.This movie shoes how the couple deals with ostracization and scrutinization by their neighbors.  People turn on the couple, from alleged reporter/book writer, curious neighbors, old friends of the dead son, and various people in town who spy on them. This movie sensitively shows that when a crime is committed, everyone involved suffers and everyone is a victim.This movie also delves into the inner turmoil of the two people. The tragic incident requires the couple to truly listen to one's needs, one's pain, one's despair.  It's this dispair that the husband and wife have left in common.  One scene, ""Reconnection"" is especially touching, which makes the end of this movie all the more puzzling.  How they deal with their grief in the end is never resolved.  It leaves a haunting impression.This movie is well-done, using mostly unknown actors in demanding roles.  It's worth a viewing.  Just don't watch it while depressed.

Not only would you have to deal with the tragic loss, but might have to endure the guilt of knowing the loved one was responsible. This heartbreaking movie puts us on the 'other side of the fence' to hopefully find empathy for those who are left behind after horrible violence.

This film is worth watching for their performances alone, though the supporting actors were all excellent, as well. One scene in particular stood out to me. As Bello sat at a table in a crowded restaurant waiting for Sheen to return, her strong exterior melted, and she dissolved into sobs. Bello totally sold the scene, which could have come off as overdramatic. Instead, it was one of the most touching scenes of the film.

This harrowing, expertly crafted film presents a nuanced but unrelenting emotional portrait of a husband and wife whose college-age son goes off the deep end and kills dozens of his classmates. Michael Sheen and Maria Bello turn in exceptional performances as the parents whose already-strained marriage is blown to atoms by the devastating news. Although the script may overstate how judgmental other people may be towards these parents (or perhaps not...) the film rings true on many levels. The acting is impressive: Sheen in particular is stunning, and all the supporting roles are equally solid. The film has a queasy feel; it's uncomfortable and dark, but extremely well-made and certainly worth watching (but only if you're up for a depressing, thoughtful exploration of human misery...)

1453618,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005CA4SA6,DVD Verdict,"[1, 1]","Franck Tabouring, DVD Verdict --As the movie opens, it only takes a few minutes for viewers to realize Kate and Bill are not leading a happy marriage. The lack of communication and passion between the two is slowly eating away at them, and they're just about ready to go their separate ways. Interestingly enough, the news of their son's death certainly doesn't help the situation right away. Although Kate and Bill are both instantly hit with the same painful feelings of grief and blame, they don't immediately find the courage to confront the crisis together.Herein lies some of the film's greatest appeal, because Ku and his writing partner Michael Armbruster keep challenging their main characters by not having this new tragedy simply erasing the problems they've been facing for quite some time. Through gripping dialogue and intense, highly emotional confrontations, Beautiful Boy does a fabulous job examining to what extent Bill and Kate's relationship suffers under the stress of their son's death, the resulting media attention, and their quest to find out what exactly drove their kid to commit such a horrendous act.Michael Sheen and Maria Bello's performances inject the movie with the power and authenticity the story requires, and they hit all the right notes in every scene they're in--together or alone. Some of their heated arguments in the movie easily count among some of the most intense, emotionally charged, and heartbreaking scenes I've ever see in a drama. Some of the film's success is attributable to the clever material, but if I had to single out the greatest asset of Beautiful Boy, it would definitely be the lead cast.The complexity of the story aside, Beautiful Boy also works so well because of Ku's inspiring direction and his buddy Michael Fimognari's documentary style cinematography. Pair this with subtle editing and an appropriate soundtrack, and you're in for an extraordinary viewing experience. As beautifully as the movie is shot though, I can't say I am entirely impressed with the high-definition transfer. The Blu-ray edition offers a 1.78:1/1080p widescreen version of the feature, but the image is pretty grainy throughout. It may not be as noticeable in some scenes, but overall, the heavy grain does stick out. That said, I've got no complaints in the audio department; the Dolby True-HD 5.1 transfer simply rocks.In terms of special features, Beautiful Boy (Blu-ray) offers some deleted scenes. Also included is a very informative and intelligent audio commentary with Shawn Ku, his director of photography, and his editor. Ku does most of the talking, but he really digs deep into the subject matter of the film, touching on his inspiration for the movie, the depth of the characters, and why he chose to develop their relationship they way he did.

1453622,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005CA4SA6,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","BEAUTIFUL BOY fills a gap in our understanding of how events change us.  The story is three stories, really: a marriage in disarray due to an increasing distance between  a husband and wife, the terrifying discovery that an only child is dead, and the horror of the reality that that dead child murdered classmates and faculty at his college without a knowledgeable prodrome.  It speaks loudly to contemporary marriages and families torn asunder by lack of communication in a time of sheltered or imposed privacy of cellphones, blogging, computers that prevent face to face communications at critical times.Bill (Michael Sheen) and Kate (Maria Bello) are living a stalemate of a marriage on the brink of ending: Kate is a proofreader for writers (currently for Cooper played with great sincerity by Austin Nichols) while Bill immerses himself in his business life.  They now have separate bedrooms, their only tie is their son Sammy (Kyle Gallner) who is off to his first year of college.  Bill and Kate learn that there has been a shooting incident at Sammy's college and that a number of students were killed.  When police arrive at their home they receive the news that Sammy is among the dead but worse than that, Sammy is the one who killed all the students and faculty and they committed suicide. Bill and Kate are devastated, become the source of the paparazzi and move in with Kate's bother Eric (Alan Tudyk) and sister-in-law Trish (Moon Bloodgood) and their young son.  The tension continues to build and when Kate attempts to hide her grief by caring for the brother's house and family, Bill and Kate move to a motel run by a compassionate clerk (Meat Loaf Aday).  Events happen and Bill and Kate flirt with restoring their marriage only to separate: the manner in which they find their way back toward sanity by confronting their own demons is the quiet way in which this story ends. Instead of a predictable happy ending the audience is left in the throes of the mending process - a writer/director choice that makes the film far more dramatic than most.Sheen and Bello give razor sharp portrayals of these two devastated, questioning people. This is their film and the way they react to every moment of the story is simply uncanny. Their performances are staggeringly well done.  But then the entire cast is polished, making this film a model for other films about difficult life situations credible.

The emotional resonance that Michael Sheen and Maria Bello brought to their parts has not been duplicated anywhere that I've seen before in this genre.  Excellent supporting performances by Alan Tudyk (as Maria's character's brother) and by Moon Bloodgood as his wife also add to the story and, ironically (because they really did try to help), to the couple's suffering.

1453626,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B005CA4SA6,James Morris,"[20, 21]","I must admit that the premise of this film did not excite me terribly at first glance, since I've seen too many made-for-TV movies filled with overly sentimental music and tear-jerking dramatics.  Viewing the film, however, was both refreshing and dramatically satisfying.Bill and Kate are the middle-class parents of college junior Sammy, a young man who has always been quiet and something of a loner.  There is a tension beneath their marriage which is not readily apparent to anyone, not even to them.  One night their son calls and sounds unusually quiet.  The viewer is easily able to spot the sadness and confusion in his face, but Bill and Kate notice nothing over the phone, chatting only about planning the family vacation.The next morning brings the news that a student has shot dozens of fellow students at Sammy's college.  There is a lockdown and no information is coming out of the school.  Worried as they are, Bill and Kate convince themselves that Sammy is fine - he rarely answers his cell phone anyway, Kate muses - until the moment when two detectives appear at their door.  Kate screams, ""He's dead, isn't he?"" and their worst fears are confirmed.  But then comes the unthinkable, ""There's more"" says the Detective, as he informs them that Sammy is the perpetrator who shot himself in the head after murdering so many of his fellow students.  ""LIAR!"" shrieks Kate, ""LIAR!"" she repeats, as she collapses in disbelief.They both take to bed, Bill in their room and Kate sprawled across Sammy's in his attic bedroom.  After a short while, the reporters appear at their door and the television is endlessly showing Sammy's photo and a seemingly psychopathic video he made shortly before his rampage.  Bill and Kate flee to Kate's brother's home, while they try to come to terms with Sammy's inexplicable killing spree.The first thing that impressed me about this film was the superb acting.  Michael Sheen (""David Frost"" in FROST NIXON; ""Tony Blair"" in THE QUEEN) is nothing short of brilliant as the confused and grieving Bill.  He's a good man, a good husband and a good father, but the events that unfold make him question if the tragedy could somehow be their fault.  Maria Bello (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) is extremely effective as Kate, believably and quietly wringing all the emotion one could expect out of the situation.  But even more than their amazing performances, the tight script, effectively dramatic without any pathos or phony emotion, is as believable as one could want and plunges the viewer directly into the experience of the two shocked parents, as they deal with horribly cruel and judgmental comments on Sammy's Facebook page, childish, sadistic graffiti spray-painted on his tombstone, endless talk-show hosts who condemn them as parents without ever meeting them, and thrill-seeking teens who break into their home to ""investigate"" all they can about the ""Psycho murderer.""  How many times have we seen headlines like this and thought, ""It's the parents fault"" without giving any real consideration to who the parents really are and how confused and saddened they must be to lose a child?Equally impressive is the first-rate direction by Shawn Ku, who restrains the dramatics to the point of sheer plausibility and whose indulgence in hand-held cameras is neither excessive nor obtrusive.  The best thing about it, it bears repeating, is the absence of maudlin emotions and tear-wrenching, sappy speeches or music.  The scenes are all well thought out, extremely credible and ultimately satisfying.  For a while, I thought they had stopped making films like this.  The pedestrian premise initially prompted me to give it just four stars, but in the end I was so satisfied by this marvelously well-done, old-fashioned drama that I can't see how it deserves less than five.Highly recommended.",5,As Up-to-the-minute As Tomorrow's Headlines and Brilliantly Acted / Directed,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,3831,"['must', 'admit', 'premise', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'excite', 'terribly', 'first', 'glance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'filled', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'music', 'tear-jerking', 'dramatics', 'Viewing', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'refreshing', 'dramatically', 'satisfying.Bill', 'Kate', 'are', 'middle-class', 'parents', 'college', 'junior', 'Sammy', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'quiet', 'something', 'loner', 'tension', 'marriage', 'not', 'readily', 'apparent', 'anyone', 'not', 'even', 'One', 'night', 'son', 'calls', 'unusually', 'quiet', 'viewer', 'easily', 'able', 'spot', 'sadness', 'confusion', 'face', 'Bill', 'Kate', 'notice', 'nothing', 'phone', 'chatting', 'only', 'planning', 'family', 'vacation.The', 'next', 'morning', 'news', 'student', 'shot', 'dozens', 'fellow', 'students', 'Sammy', 'college', 'lockdown', 'information', 'coming', 'school', 'Worried', 'are', 'Bill', 'Kate', 'convince', 'Sammy', 'fine', 'rarely', 'cell', 'phone', 'anyway', 'Kate', 'moment', 'when', 'two', 'detectives', 'appear', 'door', 'Kate', 'screams', 'dead', ""n't"", 'worst', 'fears', 'are', 'confirmed', 'then', 'unthinkable', 'more', 'Detective', 'Sammy', 'perpetrator', 'who', 'shot', 'head', 'murdering', 'so', 'many', 'fellow', 'students', 'LIAR', 'shrieks', 'Kate', 'LIAR', 'disbelief.They', 'take', 'bed', 'Bill', 'room', 'Kate', 'sprawled', 'Sammy', 'attic', 'bedroom', 'short', 'while', 'reporters', 'appear', 'door', 'television', 'endlessly', 'showing', 'Sammy', 'photo', 'seemingly', 'psychopathic', 'video', 'made', 'shortly', 'rampage', 'Bill', 'Kate', 'flee', 'Kate', 'brother', 'home', 'try', 'come', 'terms', 'Sammy', 'inexplicable', 'killing', 'spree.The', 'first', 'thing', 'impressed', 'film', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'David', 'Frost', 'FROST', 'NIXON', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'confused', 'grieving', 'Bill', 'good', 'man', 'good', 'husband', 'good', 'father', 'events', 'unfold', 'make', 'question', 'tragedy', 'could', 'somehow', 'be', 'fault', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'FOR', 'SMOKING', 'extremely', 'effective', 'Kate', 'believably', 'quietly', 'wringing', 'emotion', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'performances', 'tight', 'script', 'effectively', 'dramatic', 'pathos', 'phony', 'emotion', 'as', 'believable', 'one', 'could', 'want', 'plunges', 'viewer', 'directly', 'experience', 'two', 'shocked', 'parents', 'deal', 'horribly', 'cruel', 'judgmental', 'comments', 'Sammy', 'Facebook', 'page', 'childish', 'sadistic', 'graffiti', 'spray-painted', 'tombstone', 'endless', 'talk-show', 'hosts', 'who', 'condemn', 'parents', 'ever', 'meeting', 'thrill-seeking', 'teens', 'who', 'break', 'home', 'investigate', 'can', 'Psycho', 'murderer', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'headlines', 'thought', 'parents', 'fault', 'giving', 'real', 'consideration', 'who', 'parents', 'really', 'are', 'how', 'confused', 'saddened', 'must', 'be', 'lose', 'child', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'first-rate', 'direction', 'Shawn', 'Ku', 'who', 'dramatics', 'point', 'sheer', 'plausibility', 'indulgence', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'excessive', 'obtrusive', 'best', 'thing', 'repeating', 'absence', 'maudlin', 'emotions', 'tear-wrenching', 'sappy', 'speeches', 'music', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'extremely', 'credible', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'while', 'thought', 'had', 'stopped', 'making', 'films', 'pedestrian', 'premise', 'initially', 'prompted', 'give', 'just', 'four', 'stars', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'satisfied', 'marvelously', 'well-done', 'old-fashioned', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'less', 'five.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

However, they are drifting apart, living separate lives, and on the verge of divorce.  Then they receive the news that their only child, Sammy, has massacred numerous classmates and teachers at his college.  They must learn to cling to each other as the rest of the world turns against them.""Beautiful Boy"" left me feeling as though I'd been punched in the stomach.  It's a very emotional, disturbing and depressing film; it expertly portrays the living nightmare that is endured by parents whose children are responsible for massacring innocent people.  The shooting incident depicted in ""Beautiful Boy"" appears to be happening with more frequency.  Furthermore, it can happen anywhere.  This film, for the first time, made me realize the emotional torment that the parents of the shooters must experience when the community ostracizes them, blaming them for their children's actions.Michael Sheen (""The Queen,"" ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""Resistance"") and Maria Bello (""Shattered"", ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" and ""The Company Men"") give Oscar-worthy performances as they blame themselves and each other for their son's actions.  Their fight in the hotel room was so intense and disturbing that I wanted to walk away from the television.  They ask questions that can never be truthfully answered.  Most importantly, they ask, ""Was I a good parent?"" and ""Did we do something wrong?""  This happens quite frequently when children dangerously err, whether they commit violent crimes or develop unhealthy addictions.  Parents aren't perfect.  They need to realize that their children are responsible for their own decisions and choices.  If Sammy was angry, there were many other avenues he could've chosen for venting it.Anchor Bay Entertainment presents ""Beautiful Boy"" in its theatrical widescreen presentation of 1.78:1.  There are Spanish subtitles and English subtitles for those of us, like myself, who are hearing impaired.  Though there is no nudity, the film is rated R for disturbing, nerve-rattling scenes based on the aftermath of a college campus shooting spree.  As far as special features are concerned, there is a trailer and a few deleted scenes that are essential viewing, especially the dramatic one involving Patty, the mother of a victim.  At the grocery store, when Kate apologizes for her son's actions,  Patty slaps her in the face and says, through gritted teeth, ""I hope you and your murdering son rot in Hell.""Surprisingly, there is the absence of a making-of featurette. However, audio commentary is provided by Writer/Director Shawn Ku, Editor Chad Galster and Cinematographer Michael Fimognari.  Fans will find it quite interesting.  Yes, ""Beautiful Boy"" is based on the Virginia Tech massacre of April 16, 2007.  It was filmed in only eighteen days. The gorgeous Maria Bello used little or no makeup because she wanted her scenes to appear as realistic as possible.  Less time in the makeup chair also allowed for a tighter shooting schedule.  There was much discussion about lighting and camera angles/positions.  For example, the last time Bill and Kate are together with Kate's brother and his wife is when they are eating dinner.  Interestingly enough, the camera crew is filming the scene from outdoors, looking through the dining room windows as if to say, ""We've already been kicked out and you, Bill and Kate, are next.""""Beautiful Boy"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy intelligent, dramatic films that incite emotions within the viewer.  Be forewarned, it can be very depressing.  However, it does have a surprisingly fulfilling ending.  Even in the face of tragedy, we can always find hope and, perhaps, love.  ""Beautiful Boy"" is the type of film that is both poignant and provocative; it will be hard to dismiss from one's memory.  Perhaps family members will look at each other and realize they need to spend more time together because tomorrow is never guaranteed.  The American dream can quickly turn into the American nightmare when members of a family cease to communicate with each other.Joseph B. Hoyos",5,"Parents Scream ""Why!!""

The reason why he did it is never explained, although his parents certainly speculate on the cause - and one that obviously comes up is that perhaps they were inadequate parents.  They wonder if they are really to blame for the death of their son; and the deaths of the other students that day.  The performances from Michael Sheen and Mario Bello are great.

1453631,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005CA4SA6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 8]","Sam Carroll (Kyle Gallner) calls his parents from college. His father Bill (Michael Sheen) doesn't speak to him for very long; his mother Kate (Maria Bello) speaks to him longer but neither really says anything of particular importance. What they don't see is that Sam is on the verge of tears. The next day, Sam is dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after perpetrating a shooting spree at his school.School shootings are unfortunately prevalent in this country. When one occurs, the nation watches and then proceeds to pass judgment. School shootings are a touchy cinematic subject not often covered on film and never from the perspective of the parents. It is sometimes forgotten or not even thought about that the parents of school shooters are victims too. Parenting, whether good or bad, is not necessarily a catalyst for this kind of thing, yet the parents tend to receive some of the blame and are viewed as an extension of the shooter and disregarded accordingly.This kind of film is tailor-made for actors. The skeleton of the plot isn't new; a family trying to pick up the pieces after a tragedy. By incorporating a school shooting and the effects this has on the shooter's parents, writers Michael Armbruster and Shawn Ku (who also directs) add another layer of depth and examination to the story rather than sensationalizing it. It's a touchy subject, because filmmakers don't have a lot to explore. There's no definitive answer. We like to blame things, be it bullying or music or video games, but why then do people who are exposed to the same things not react in the same way? It's this sense of the unknown that I think troubles people most and keeps them glued to the screen in these situations. The film is respectful towards the issue and doesn't bite off more than it can chew.The film follows Bill and Kate, both consumed with their work and leaning towards a future divorce. After facts come to light about their sons actions, they begin trying to cope with the tragedy in the current social networking/mass media world. Soon, they are being badgered by the media and are forced to retreat from their home to attempt to restore things to some sense of normality, while being exposed to the cruelty of people who feel personally wronged and misplace their blame. The script wisely avoids dwelling on Sam or the particulars of the shooting, allowing the actors to embrace the strong emotional content of the story. It is, at its very essence, an actor's piece and both Bello and Sheen deliver. Powerful, startling words are said to each other; something parents should never have to say or experience. Singer Meat Loaf has a few brief scenes as a hotel clerk and there's a scene between him and Sheen that is devastating and brilliantly, quietly acted. It doesn't have the shouting and unbridled emotion of some other scenes, but it's one of the most powerful scenes of the entire film.The script explores the emotional, but not the psychological. It asks a lot of questions, but makes no attempt to answer them. Like the parents, it has no answers only speculation. The script does nearly everything right, except the subplot involving the new novelist that Kate works with. This reaches a predictable conclusion and isn't unimportant to show what parents may have to deal with, but is ineffective overall. Beautiful Boy is powerful, but not profound.

Wiles Parker,"[0, 0]","Beautiful Boy is the story of two parents, on the verge of separating, whose guilt and suffering bring them together during the aftermath of a tragic event.  The question of why their son commits an atrocious act is not answered as this movie focuses on the struggle of the parents who are trying to deal with the emotional upheaval the event has caused.  The pacing of the story is well metered and emphasized by wonderful performances by both Michael Sheen and Maria Bello as the stricken parents trying to come to terms with both why their son did what he did and how they may have played a part.  The fact that this film shifts the focus on the parents gives a different perspective as together they may or may not be the ones to blame, but their emotional journeys are no less touching than if their son had simply been a victim.  About the only point of contention is the limited way in which the son, Sam, is shown so there's no real conclusive ending or closure.A well executed film that rarely falls flat but is hard to watch at times.  Not exactly high on overall entertainment value.

1453634,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005CA4SA6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 10]","The struggling married couple at the heart of ""Beautiful Boy"" have their lives altered by the most horrific nightmare imaginable involving their son.  It is timely and excruciatingly unpleasant, the central tragedy should resonate with anyone concerned about alienation and random violence in the world today.  To the movie's advantage, the DVD cover and promotional material has the common sense to NOT reveal the specifics of this incident.  For the movie to achieve its maximum power, it is best to allow the content to be unveiled to the viewer as it unfolds to the parents.  However, this subtle tactic is undermined by almost every review available on Amazon (including Amazon's own editorial DVD description).  It's an unfortunate miscalculation, in my estimation, as it eliminates much tension from the film's earlier scenes and detracts from one of the year's most harrowing moments.  Writer/director Shawn Ku takes universal tragedy and shifts the focus in an unexpected and very personal way.  By doing so, he has given Michael Sheen and Maria Bello two of the most underrated roles (and performances) of the year.Sheen and Bello play an affluent, yet struggling, couple on the brink of divorce.  As they are making important decisions about their lives together, some crushing news about their college-age son smashes their existence.  Suddenly, they are at the center of a public maelstrom.  Everything they thought they knew has been stripped away and they are left with nothing but each other.  Trying to make sense of what happened and simultaneously trying to move past it, the couple attempt to navigate a powder keg of emotions.  And the story is very much about Bello and Sheen and how they cope.  Will this incident pull them back together or destroy them forever.  Part of the nuance of Ku's screenplay is that it allows that they are each their own person, and their reaction to the event and its aftermath is very separate (even as they are forever intertwined).  Filled with regret, recriminations, and humiliation--is it possible to move on?  And where does ultimate responsibility lay when unimaginable things occur?""Beautiful Boy"" is a smart and sophisticated piece of work.  Despite the opportunity for emotional grandstanding, Bello and Sheen remain remarkably grounded and utterly real.  At times, you might wish the movie offered more insight into just who their son is.  He is never developed (as a conscious decision), but the enigma of his character lingers all over the movie.  I mean if his parents, who by all accounts had a close enough relationship with the boy, are clueless--it's hard for the viewer to contextualize what happens.  Still, the movie is sensitively wrought and offers two compelling performances.  Sheen, as always, executes in one of his most emotional roles.  But it is Bello that has the chance to surprise.  I've always liked Bello, but her resume veers all over the place from top tier work to grade-B schlock.  This time, she's chosen right and her brittleness has rarely been used to such affect.  This is definitely a movie for adults who appreciate serious minded filmmaking.  An easy recommendation--its power comes from its understatement.  About 4 1/2 stars.

Unfortunately this is a rare occurrence and these movies usually fail. Such is the case with BEAUTIFUL BOY.The story revolves around a couple on the verge of divorce. Married for some time Bill (Michael Sheen) is in the process of finding a new apartment. Wife Kate (Maria Bello) is planning a family vacation, one last time to go somewhere together with their son Sam (Kyle Gallner). Away at school, Sam seems bothered when he calls his folks one night. Why is apparent the next day.While at work, Bill's co-workers are watching the news and concerned about him. Someone has opened fire at the college where Sam goes and massacred a number of students there. Kate is told the same by her friend and neighbor whose daughter also attends the same college. Bill comes home to be with Kate and eventually the police show. It's not just to notify the couple that Sam is dead, but to tell them he was the shooter and took his own life.The rest of the film follows the parents dealing with the guilt and frustration they feel about the event their son has placed them in. Was there something they did wrong? Could they have foreseen what would happen? Why would he do such a thing? Couple this with the press hounding them and they begin to wonder if this all could have been their fault.Leaving their home where reporters camp out daily, they spend time with Kate's brother and his family. Each deals with the problem in their own way. Bill looks at things from an orderly point of view, making sure they issue a press release and keeping up a strong face while he mourns in private.Kate is the emotional one, first denying that any of this could have taken place. She insists that their son did nothing, that he couldn't have done something so heinous. When video of him ranting in a recorded message he left behind surfaces she must face the truth. But she still retreats into herself, attempting to subtly take the mother's position in her brother's home.Eventually the couple leave and hole up in a motel where their various means of dealing with the problem shoots them up and down the emotional scale, one moment arguing with one another and the next falling into each other's arms in love once more only to fight again the next morning. Neither one is prepared for what happened or for what is going on now. They just deal with it themselves in their own way, never completely offering each other the support that each needs at this time. Only time will tell if they come out of this nightmare stronger or defeated.The film focuses not on the son and his deed but on the aftermath he leaves behind. While the characters are faced with questions about themselves and their family, for the most part they seem more concerned with themselves than with their son, they seem selfish to an extent. How one would deal with this sort of thing is hard to imagine but this couple seems intent on their own feelings and nothing more.And this makes for a movie that offers two roles where critics and awards type shows will respond with praise but that viewers will watch with a certain amount of boredom. Running just over 2 hours it's hard to sit and watch the pain and the self flagellation that goes on for nearly that entire time. Over and over again we watch them fight and seek someone to blame, more often than not taking the brunt of it all. And that's a weight that anyone would find hard to handle. But that's all the movie focuses on. It never offers any relief or solutions.The subject matter is topical and something few of us would ever even consider thinking about and yet with the number of mass killings perhaps it's something we should. One would hope that placed in the same circumstances each of us would be able to find some way of dealing with the problem and hopefully better than this couple does.Watching the film is like placing yourself in the same situation. You feel nothing but sad and depressed. With each passing moment as they fail to find a solution you just keep begging that it will end. Some may think of this as art but for me it's just a way to encourage depression. I'd rather spend my money on something else.",2,A SAD TAKE INDEED,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4284,"['are', 'movies', 'entertain', 'then', 'are', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'When', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'time', 'amazing', 'feat', 'Unfortunately', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'movies', 'usually', 'fail', 'Such', 'case', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'BOY.The', 'story', 'around', 'couple', 'verge', 'divorce', 'Married', 'time', 'Bill', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'process', 'finding', 'new', 'apartment', 'Wife', 'Kate', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'planning', 'family', 'vacation', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'go', 'somewhere', 'together', 'son', 'Sam', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'Away', 'school', 'Sam', 'bothered', 'when', 'folks', 'one', 'night', 'Why', 'apparent', 'next', 'day.While', 'work', 'Bill', 'co-workers', 'are', 'watching', 'news', 'concerned', 'Someone', 'opened', 'fire', 'college', 'where', 'Sam', 'massacred', 'number', 'students', 'there', 'Kate', 'told', 'same', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'daughter', 'also', 'same', 'college', 'Bill', 'home', 'be', 'Kate', 'eventually', 'police', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'notify', 'couple', 'Sam', 'dead', 'tell', 'was', 'shooter', 'took', 'own', 'life.The', 'rest', 'film', 'parents', 'dealing', 'guilt', 'frustration', 'feel', 'event', 'son', 'placed', 'Was', 'something', 'did', 'wrong', 'Could', 'have', 'foreseen', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Why', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'Couple', 'press', 'hounding', 'begin', 'wonder', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fault.Leaving', 'home', 'where', 'reporters', 'camp', 'out', 'daily', 'spend', 'time', 'Kate', 'brother', 'family', 'deals', 'problem', 'own', 'way', 'Bill', 'things', 'orderly', 'point', 'view', 'making', 'sure', 'issue', 'press', 'release', 'keeping', 'up', 'strong', 'face', 'private.Kate', 'emotional', 'one', 'first', 'denying', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'son', 'did', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'something', 'so', 'heinous', 'When', 'video', 'ranting', 'recorded', 'message', 'left', 'behind', 'surfaces', 'must', 'face', 'truth', 'still', 'attempting', 'subtly', 'take', 'mother', 'position', 'brother', 'home.Eventually', 'couple', 'leave', 'hole', 'up', 'motel', 'where', 'various', 'means', 'dealing', 'problem', 'shoots', 'up', 'emotional', 'scale', 'one', 'moment', 'arguing', 'one', 'next', 'falling', 'other', 'arms', 'love', 'once', 'more', 'only', 'fight', 'again', 'next', 'morning', 'one', 'prepared', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'going', 'now', 'just', 'deal', 'own', 'way', 'never', 'completely', 'offering', 'other', 'support', 'needs', 'time', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'come', 'nightmare', 'stronger', 'defeated.The', 'film', 'not', 'son', 'deed', 'aftermath', 'characters', 'are', 'faced', 'questions', 'family', 'most', 'part', 'seem', 'more', 'concerned', 'son', 'seem', 'selfish', 'extent', 'How', 'one', 'would', 'deal', 'sort', 'thing', 'hard', 'imagine', 'couple', 'intent', 'own', 'feelings', 'nothing', 'more.And', 'movie', 'two', 'roles', 'where', 'critics', 'awards', 'type', 'shows', 'will', 'respond', 'praise', 'viewers', 'will', 'watch', 'certain', 'amount', 'boredom', 'Running', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'hard', 'sit', 'watch', 'pain', 'self', 'flagellation', 'nearly', 'entire', 'time', 'over', 'again', 'watch', 'fight', 'seek', 'someone', 'blame', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'taking', 'brunt', 'weight', 'anyone', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'handle', 'movie', 'never', 'relief', 'solutions.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'topical', 'something', 'few', 'would', 'ever', 'even', 'consider', 'thinking', 'yet', 'number', 'mass', 'killings', 'perhaps', 'something', 'should', 'One', 'would', 'hope', 'placed', 'same', 'circumstances', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'dealing', 'problem', 'hopefully', 'better', 'couple', 'does.Watching', 'film', 'placing', 'same', 'situation', 'feel', 'nothing', 'sad', 'depressed', 'passing', 'moment', 'fail', 'find', 'solution', 'just', 'keep', 'begging', 'will', 'end', 'may', 'think', 'art', 'just', 'way', 'encourage', 'depression', ""'d"", 'rather', 'spend', 'money', 'something', 'else']",N/A

Indeed, once the initial shock of the shooting and its immediate aftermath has past, the film focuses on Bello and Keller and their tenuous relationship.  There are no surprises or significant plot turns, and it doesn't take an astute viewer to know how this story is going to end.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains two deleted scenes.

Although the primary meat of the story is the parents, I personally would've liked to have heard a little more about their son as he's only introduced briefly.Furthermore, I thought although Bello and Sheen did a fair job of playing the characters, the characters of Bill and Kate needed to be more fleshed out sooner as actual people instead of parents affected by their son's death and the public spotlight focused on them.On the plus side, I found Beautiful Boy to be a very realistic portrayal of the grief that parents go through when they've lost a child in such a shocking manner. The second half really picks up emotionally. As the characters leave the shock stage and begin to come to grips with their anger.

I've always thought Maria Bello has been a downward spiral since her ER days (fifteen years ago) and Michael Sheen is often pretty hit or miss. For every Frost/Nixon, there's a Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. But both of them are at the top of their game here.Beautiful Boy's premise is nothing shy of horrifying. It would've been pretty rough even if the two weren't going through a separation. It's the kind of film where you struggle to find the correct emotion, because the events of the film are too gruesome to process. Unlike a horror movie, this one hits real close to home.The real standout for me in this film is Alan Tudyk. I've been a huge fan of his work since his Firefly days (and a Knight's Tale), but he's really spectacular here.I don't think I've been this shaken by a film since Requiem for a Dream.

To survive the death/suicide of a child would be unreal grief, but to know that your child is also responsible for the murder of others would be a double-edged sword with no relent.At first, the reaction to the campus shooting seems to be overly delayed and unrealistic.  It took until halfway into the film before the parents were truly grieving and reacting to the shock of their son's behavior.  Sheen and Bello are wonderful actors and they do not disappoint in this film, which is a very heavy and tortured story, but I would have liked the director to want more from them sooner in the film.  Also, it would have been better to get the reactions from the parents of the murdered students, who certainly would have confronted the parents, not to mention the hate mail, vandalism and other public reactions that would have been shown toward the parents for their sons' actions.  Neighbors and friends would have turned on or abandoned them.

I should also say, while you may not like the story (it's not a ""feel good"" movie), the magnitude of drama, the story, the character's, are incredible.  Hands down, magnificent.  There are movie's that win awards and get critical acclaim, that pale in comparison to the ""raise the bar"" of this movie, in my opinion.The movie follows two parents, having issues with their marriage, as they find out their only child, has just opened fire at his local school, and then turned the gun on himself.  I can't even imagine the aftermath of that.What I found so interesting about this particular story, is that it's very rare stories get made from the perspective of someone who is NOT the victim (i.e. their child was not the one who was shot by the alleged ""killer"").  It's a look at the other side of the coin.  Watching the movie, made me think about that other perspective, that other experience.  I like movies that make you think of things you wouldn't normally.The story unfolds as the parents try and make sense of it, try and deal with all the media, and being suddenly thrust out into the spotlight of judgement.  It also brings up issues in their marriage, of course it would as would any type of extreme stress.Okay, maybe not a ""feel good"" movie, but still an excellent story, excellent raw acting, great directing.

1453649,A3SHQXNOPZBJH,B005CA4SA6,Robert Byrd,"[0, 0]","I saw this amazingly powerful film at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.  It's not a happy film, but it's completely plausible.  Many years ago my neighbors and I had a bar-b-que to which we invited a mortician who lived in the neighborhood and happened to specialize in restoring the faces of people who had been disfigured through violent crimes or suicides.  She's considered one of the premiere experts in her field.  She told us about being hired by the parents of one of the teenage Columbine shooters to restore their son's face (he shot off a good part of it off when he committed suicide at the school).  She talked about how dispassionate or in denial the parents seemed - how the mother was obsessed with her makeup and appearance, and the father was missing in action - he was actually off on a business trip!  It was an eerie experience.  I was very judgmental of those parents based on what we were told.  But all of those feelings were put into a different focus when I saw BEAUTIFUL BOY.  What a child who goes into a school or other public place and kills many people leaves behind for his parents to clean up and try to understand is beyond tragic.  And then there's the matter of all the rest of us blaming the parents - assuming they're terrible people.  But sometimes it's not the parents fault.  Sometimes the parents had no clue - no signs - possibly because they were blinded by love, or they were preoccupied by so many other things in their and their families lives.

None of the characters are very compelling, except some of the ancilary ones like the mother's writer client, the mother's brother's wife, and the hotel clerk (Meat Loaf).  We are introduced to the son early on - but you really never discover what makes him tick, except for his poem.  When he commits this horrible and violent act you are left to guess why.  The scary thing is that he does not appear to be ""Manson crazy"", evil, violent or angry - just horribly depressed and alone wishing he were back on that beach.  The rest of the movie is flat out boring and self-indulgent.  Actors chewing the scenery.  There is nothing insightful or remotely interesting about how they handle the memory of their son.  What would they think?  Who was my son?  How much did I really know about him.  I believe they still love him, but they have to be thinking - what was I in love with all those years, him - or my idea of him.  How did I not know he was capable of this.  Was I in love with a vicious killer.  I will never find out.  Just a few seconds on a DVD.  What do I know about my spouse - all these years living together.  What kind of parents were we.  If I had taken the time to known more, maybe I could have stopped it.  Guilt, desparation, anger, depression, shame.  A movie about a couple addressing these issues would be interesting indeed.  This is not that movie.  It is all very cliche.

1453651,A2UYGOYMV73826,B005CA4SA6,Rushmore,"[3, 4]","I watch movies to be entertained, impressed, moved.  This movie does none of these.  If you expect to be depressed it will most likely meet your expectations.It's not a bad movie by any means.  Maria Bello and Michael Sheen are fine actors and they do a good job.  The script seems very true and does not descend into bathos or melodrama, which would be a pretty easy route.  It's just the story of two people struggling in the early days after their son commits a horrific crime and kills himself.There are really few spoilers here.  For the most part people don't show Bill and Kate much kindness.  The kindest act is by a motel proprietor who throws the press off their trail.  That's as noble as it gets.  Nobody sets up a foundation in the memory of the people who died.  There are no support groups or stunning insights.  It's just basicaly two people struggling with the hardest question of all: how much  responsibility should parents take for the actions of their child.We see the son Sammy briefly.  He calls his parents the night before he dies.  Any parent who has had kids at college or just living far away can identify with this conversation.  Pretty much no kid sounds anything but depressed late at night talking on the phone to his parents.  You just have to tell yourself everything is OK and move on.  So here we have a situation where everything was decidedly not OK.  Should they have known?  Could they have done anything to prevent what happened?  They will never know for sure, but the answer is, probably not.  So they just have to live with what happened.Bill and Kate were on the verge of separation when this thing happened.  Afterwards they only have each other, really.  There are no support groups composed of parents of mass murderers.  They don't get professional counseling.  I am glad the movie does not go off in this direction, anyway.  It's much more realistic that they struggle alone together.  Kate almost makes a friend, but he turns out to be a dud.  I respect how the movie does not provide any easy answers.  There are no magical plot developments to make things better, and conversely in their struggles they don't turn into cliches.  They are just real people trying hard to cope and not always succeeding.It's a dark movie, literally and figuratively.  No sunshine, few smiles.  It is not uplifting.  It covers only a brief time after the murders happened, so we don't have a chance to see any sort of natural healing process.  At the end everything is still raw, and we don't know if things will get better and if so when.  It's not an easy movie to watch.  I can't say yet whether it will stay with me and keep me thinking - I just watched it last night.  If you are intrigued by the situation and interested in a small, well-acted movie about how people cope in the aftermath, then I would recommend this movie.  If you have kids away from home for the first time and worry about them a lot, then definitely don't watch it.",3,Bleak,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,2975,"['watch', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'impressed', 'moved', 'movie', 'none', 'expect', 'be', 'depressed', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'meet', 'expectations.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'are', 'fine', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'script', 'very', 'true', 'not', 'descend', 'bathos', 'melodrama', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'route', 'just', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'struggling', 'early', 'days', 'son', 'horrific', 'crime', 'kills', 'are', 'really', 'few', 'spoilers', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'Bill', 'Kate', 'much', 'kindness', 'kindest', 'act', 'motel', 'proprietor', 'who', 'press', 'trail', 'as', 'noble', 'Nobody', 'up', 'foundation', 'memory', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'are', 'support', 'groups', 'stunning', 'insights', 'just', 'basicaly', 'two', 'people', 'struggling', 'hardest', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'responsibility', 'should', 'parents', 'take', 'actions', 'child.We', 'see', 'son', 'Sammy', 'briefly', 'parents', 'night', 'Any', 'parent', 'who', 'had', 'kids', 'college', 'just', 'living', 'far', 'away', 'can', 'identify', 'conversation', 'Pretty', 'much', 'kid', 'anything', 'depressed', 'late', 'night', 'talking', 'phone', 'parents', 'just', 'have', 'tell', 'everything', 'OK', 'move', 'So', 'here', 'have', 'situation', 'where', 'everything', 'was', 'decidedly', 'not', 'OK.', 'Should', 'have', 'known', 'Could', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'prevent', 'what', 'happened', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'sure', 'answer', 'probably', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'live', 'what', 'happened.Bill', 'Kate', 'were', 'verge', 'separation', 'when', 'thing', 'happened', 'Afterwards', 'only', 'have', 'other', 'really', 'are', 'support', 'groups', 'composed', 'parents', 'mass', 'murderers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'professional', 'counseling', 'am', 'glad', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'direction', 'anyway', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'struggle', 'alone', 'together', 'Kate', 'almost', 'friend', 'out', 'be', 'dud', 'respect', 'how', 'movie', 'not', 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'are', 'magical', 'plot', 'developments', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'conversely', 'struggles', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'cliches', 'are', 'just', 'real', 'people', 'trying', 'hard', 'cope', 'not', 'always', 'succeeding.It', 'dark', 'movie', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'sunshine', 'few', 'smiles', 'not', 'uplifting', 'only', 'brief', 'time', 'murders', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'sort', 'natural', 'healing', 'process', 'end', 'everything', 'still', 'raw', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'so', 'when', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'yet', 'will', 'stay', 'keep', 'thinking', 'just', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'are', 'intrigued', 'situation', 'interested', 'small', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'cope', 'aftermath', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'kids', 'away', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'worry', 'lot', 'then', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch']",N/A

Seemingly in name only. They have separate bedrooms. We don't know if they are contemplating separation as Bill searches for an apartment that Kate isn't ready to hear about. Instead, she is focused on an upcoming family vacation. They are extremely polite with each other and it is in a genuine way but it is obvious that the marriage is empty.Their son is at college. He appears to be saddened by the apathy he sees as he reads something he has written in one of his classes. He calls his parents and the viewer can see that he is very unhappy. The viewer doesn't know why. Is it because of his parents functioning-but-not-really marriage? Because of school? Mother and father don't pick up on his mood and say goodbye to him.The next day, the news comes.What follows after that is a couple that must deal with the fallout of their son's actions and also the way they've been dealing with each other.Bill and Kate are superbly acted by Michael Sheen and Maria Bello. Neither strikes a false note in their performances. Their sadness and anger at their son. Their pain at what he has done to himself and to others.But with that said, there is something missing in this story. Perhaps the end comes and goes in a way that is flat. Or perhaps it is the feeling that the story was made for the premise rather than to tell a story.I'm not sure but while I do consider the performances to be of a wonderful caliber, the story itself seems more premise than substance.

The answer is yes, with no apparent effort. Despite the occasional weasely smile, I forgot that there was an English actor in the part of a fairly remote father/husband. He and his wife, played by the beautiful and unquestionably American Monica Bello (A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series), are not torn apart by their son shooting seventeen people on the college campus where he is a freshman, ending with himself. They are temporarily pushed together, staying with her brother while his boss insists that Bill (Sheen) take time off.Predictably, gawkers are many, headed by the news reporters staking out the house, plus two who get to the room of the dead son (Kyle Gallner, who does not strike me as beautiful or even handsome and whose story intoned at the start and end of the movie seems pretty pointless). The movie does not explore What Made Him Do It? The parents spend less time asking that than I'd expect. She is a perfectionist and he was more interested in work than family, but (as she says) they were neither the best nor the worst of parents.Leave it at that and skip the movie would be my advice, though the acting (and not just of the leads) is quite good.

Bill (Sheen) and Kate (Bello) are getting things in order for their separation. No longer happy they barely talk anymore. When news of a shooting at their son's college comes they begin to fear the worst. When told that it was their son who did the shooting they begin to wonder why. This is a very emotional movie and is sometimes tough to get through. The acting is excellent (not surprising) and is very realistic and subdued. I really did like this movie but there seemed to be something missing to make it great. After movies like ""Other Woman"" and ""Rabbit Hole"" the subjects of children tragedy has been all over and for some reason this one did not have the same effect on me that those did. This movie did tackle the rarely seen subject of what the parents of someone who does that goes through and made you take a second thought at how you may have felt after the Columbine or Virgina Tech families. Overall, a powerful story with great acting that is missing something to make it great. I'm just not sure what it is. I do recommend this though.

As a parent I couldn't help but sympathize with the main characters of the film and their horror as they discovered what their son has done and trying to find meaning in each other as they examine what they could have done differently in raising their son.The acting in ""Beautiful Boy"" is stellar; Michael Sheen continues to prove himself one of the best actors of his generation with the unusual and challenging roles he has taken on over the years. Every bit his equal Maria Bello (""Primse Suspect"" and ""A History of Violence"" among other projects)reaches deep into herself to create a believable character touched by tragedy and consumed by the guilt of her disintegrating marriage and the damage her own son has done.The special features include a featurette on the making of the film and commentary by the director.Recommended.",4,"The loss of a couple's son causes unexpected consequences in ""Beautiful Boy""",1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1153,"['Beautiful', 'Boy', 'world', 'estranged', 'couple', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'brought', 'together', 'again', 'tragedy', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'son', 'committed', 'mass', 'killing', 'college', 'turning', 'gun', 'himself.Directed', 'Shawn', 'Ku', 'Beautiful', 'Boy', 'powerful', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'parent', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'horror', 'discovered', 'what', 'son', 'done', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'other', 'examine', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'raising', 'son.The', 'acting', 'Beautiful', 'Boy', 'stellar', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'prove', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'unusual', 'challenging', 'roles', 'taken', 'years', 'bit', 'equal', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Primse', 'Suspect', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'other', 'projects', 'deep', 'create', 'believable', 'character', 'touched', 'tragedy', 'consumed', 'guilt', 'disintegrating', 'marriage', 'damage', 'own', 'son', 'done.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'commentary', 'director.Recommended']",N/A

Their son is in his first year of college. It is never stated where he is attending school, but this has many of the patterns of the Virginia Tech killings. We see what the parents of the shooter go through. They never come to grip or resolution of what has happened, and maybe they never will; but the story that unfolds is riveting and true to reality.This is a realistic script and the acting of all is not overplayed. We can feel the questions that all parents would ask...what we did wrong? whose fault is this?The DVD has a few extras, just a few deleted scenes and an audio commentary with the writer/director.
