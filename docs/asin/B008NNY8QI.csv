1571776,A13UPPKNU1BO13,B008NNY8QI,A. Irey,"[4, 7]","Alright, I'll just get right to the point.  Having the opportunity to watch the prelims live for this card I had a lot of the initial excitement for this card burn away fast.  It mainly was due to the fact that all of the prelims ended by decision.  Granted, I can understand a hard fought fight going the distance or even applauding two fighters for giving an amazing fight that ends by judges decision.  What I got from this card though was a bunch of fighters fighting not to lose, as opposed to fighting for the win.  So many of the fighters were tentative and unwilling to engage with their opponents, in the same fashion that they are able to walk away with little damage and claimed to have won out by points but I really didn't witness any fighter seem to give their heart and soul out there in the first hours of this card and that is frustrating to watch, especially given that this card had been promoted up the wazoo.Mike Easton took on Ivan Menjivar in the first fight of the main card.  While I would like to go into more detail this fight just continued in the same fashion of the prelims where both fighters didn't take it into the second gear and it really left me with an underwhelming feeling in the gut.  Another decision.Cody McKenzie made his Featherweight debut in the second fight of the night.  McKenzie is an Ultimate Fighter alumni primarily known for having an extremely awkward and effective guillotine which has been used in nearly every one of his victories in his career.  Having had a rocky career at Lightweight during his time in the UFC McKenzie looked to reinvigorate himself by entering the Featherweight division.  There to welcome him was Chad Mendes.  Mendes can be best known was the once undefeated #1 contender to Jose Aldo's title until he was knocked out by said champion in the first pay-per-view of this year.  Looking to get back to his winning ways Mendes was looking to win this in spectacular fashion.  I'm so thankful this fight ended the way it did.  This fight ended under the first minute of competition with a quick and decisive finish that finally stopped the tirade of boring decisions.In the following fight Demian Maia fought against Dong Hyun Kim.  Maia was making his Welterweight debut in this fight and give how tiny he was at Middleweight I would say it was certainly a good decision, even after seeing him turn into another proverbial Mike Swick.  It also gave the Welterweight division an interesting fighter to think about as he's among the most dangerous Jiu-Jitsu practitioners in the UFC, and in a division mostly dominated by strong wrestlers I'm pretty intrigued in seeing how he does.  As for Dong Hyun Kim, he's only lost once in his career to current Interim-Welterweight champion Carlos Condit.  So, while not being in the lead for a title shot he was still plenty dangerous.  Now, the fight itself was certainly quick but not in a good way.  While I suppose it's better that the fight did end quickly, the manner in which it ended was quite poor as it was an injury that simply came out of nowhere after a single takedown.  Now, those who have yet to see the fight might not understand but watch the fight and I think you'll understand the lake luster feeling I get from this fight.This next fight was being called fight of the night before it even happened and that is certainly not what happened.  Cung Le made his debut in the UFC in what was one of the best fights of 2011 against Wanderlei Silva.  He's the kind of striker with enough fancy kicks that he keeps other fighters guessing and utilizes his skill set very effectively having finished every one of his opponents.  Patrick Cote, while not the same kind of striker, does possess some good power.  He's returning back to the UFC on a four fight win streak and looking to get back to the top once more, or at least as close to the top with Anderson Silva around....  Most people expected these two to go out and destroy each other, or at least make the fight extremely exciting.  Unfortunately the fight was hampered by one fighter's inability to push the action with another fighter's gas tank emptying before the third round leaving a lot to be desired for a good portion of the fight.This was it, Tito Ortiz's last fight.  In many ways, it seems appropriate that it was Forrest Griffin was his last opponent.  Their first two fights have been absolute classics with each fighter scoring the victory by split decision.  So, to put the final pin on the debate of who was the better fighter these two men would go to war once again.  Now, there's a lot I could say about both fighters but I'm not really sure I should say anything.  Honestly, I'm a fan of both men and was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the rubber match take place.  The fight really felt just like rounds 7, 8, and 9 in their feud.  While some different things were demonstrated in this third compared to the last two it really didn't seem to feel all that different.  While that works for some people it may not be to everyone's liking.  Honestly, though I'm just glad to see Ortiz finish his career still looking strong given his time in the UFC.  But maybe the most puzzling question, why did Forrest do what he did at the end of the fight...?Now, regardless if you were a casual fan or hardcore, you were almost guaranteed to be invest in the main event match one way or another.  Anderson Silva and Chael Sonnen went to war in ""The Fight of the Year"" back in 2010 but amidst drug tests and legal woes the battle that took place was hindered and many questioned the performance of Sonnen.  After having defeated Brian Stann and Michael Bisping took his place in the #1 contender's spot once more against Anderson Silva.  It's not really all that shocking that Silva has remained Middleweight champion since that fight having scored definitive victories over Vitor Belfort and Yushin Okami.  It really didn't leave a whole lot left for the ""Spider"" to do but reaffirm that Sonnen got lucky in the first fight and that Silva was truly the proper champion.  There's so much I would love to say about the fight itself but to avoid spoiling things this fight went on to answer more than a few questions, assuming you were looking for the right ones and not just a ""who won"" kinda thing.  Most certainly a fight worth checking out and seeing for yourself.Overall, I can't recommend buying this card.  I just can't.  There are only two fights worth watching on this entire card, unless you count the quick finish from Mendes/McKenzie but I don't.  Honestly, just wait until the ""Best of 2012"" set.  Hopefully that set will have both the Ortiz/Griffin fight and the Silva/Sonnen fight, but after having seen the ""Best of 2011"" set I'm not holding my breath on that either.",2,UFC

Le put up a good fight despite being  40 years old at that  time, 2012. It's amazing for a man of that age. Fighter 1 just kept pressing fighter 2 through round 1.  Round 2 was the same. However, this time they both were bleeding. Their faces were covered with blood. In round 3, at about 4 minutes 30 seconds, fighter 2 executed an interesting takedown.I'm sorry, I can't refer to these fighters by their real names. Otherwise, it would reduce your enjoyment.The main event, the middle weight championship between Silvia and Sonnen was exciting and had a surprising ending.
