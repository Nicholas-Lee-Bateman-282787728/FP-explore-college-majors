I'm so extremely happy they will do another movies. I specially loved this two new agents: dog and agent kitty being fighting side by side. It was so cool and they are such a cute characters, especially when they are together. And the Kitty Galore with her mouse is so cool! Everything about this movie is totally amazing!!! I can't wait for more movies to come!!!What I don't understand is: why some people gave it bad reviews? Some rated it as bad, because of bad shipping or damaged product. Do not post reviews if it's not about the movie! Post it to the sellers who you bought it from. It would have gotten better ratings. It's such a shame that some people leave bad feedbacks to spoil ratings for a good movies. I've seen bad movies and boring movies. ''Cats and Dogs'' do not deserve bad ratings. What can I say more?

1321721,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B0034G4OT0,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[1, 5]","""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge Of Kitty Galore""-----------------------------------------------This is a decent live-action-meets CGI, talking-animal kids' film, suitable for younger viewers and thankfully largely free from quickly-dated pop culture references (ie, none of the animals are acting ""street,"" or pretending to be Paris Hilton, etc.) It's not the greatest film ever, but certainly not as moronic as, say, the Space Bud franchise.  All-in-all, our family found it to be entertaining, inoffensive and not scary at all.  A few genuinely funny moments, but basically you're just being a saintly parent taking your kid to see a dumb flick.My one real criticism is that it opened here in 3D (with the 2D version to come later) and I have to say, the effects were pretty underwhelming.  Rather flat, actually.  I would have been much happier seeing this particular film in 2D and saving the extra money for my kids' college fund.Although I'm sure they'll tinker with the print later, the 3D in this theatrical release is probably indicative of the state of the industry right now: whatever the film is, run it through the Dimens-O-Matic 3000 editing machine and make it officially ""three-dee"", charge five more bucks per ticket, and hope nobody notices the effects weren't really all that great. Of course a few films will lead the pack -- ""Avatar,"" ""How To Train Your Dragon"" -- but I think we are in for a looooooooooooooooooooong period of time when mediocre 3D-i-zations of random films are going to flood the market.  It will be a while before your average Hollywood cinematographer or editor are really going to get a handle on this new technology, but that won't stop the studios from putting out slapdash 3D films left and right. Meanwhile, unless I hear some rave, ""dude! that 3D was amazing!"" reviews, I'll make a point to stick with the 2D versions. Grumble, grumble.

1321728,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0034G4OT0,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 14]","""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" is harmless and innocent. It doesn't tell much of a story, but it certainly has plenty of special effects for younger audiences to gawk at, especially since just about all of them involve the titular house pets. It is, of course, the sequel to the 2001 hit ""Cats & Dogs,"" which was founded on the premise that cats and dogs have been at war with each other for centuries; the fight continues, although I seriously doubt that the story has progressed in real time, since the characters from the first film - many full grown - would in all likelihood already be in doggie or kitty heaven after the passage of nine years. But no, let's not get into that. Let's pretend that these super intelligent pets, some of them scientists, have developed some sort of a life-extending potion.Just like in the first movie, the animals have the ability to speak when not in the presence of humans. This is made possible through a number of cinematic tricks, such as compositing computer generated mouths onto the heads of real animals, building entire animals digitally, or constructing articulated puppets and animatronic figures. They're also given a number of super cool spy gadgets, many of them even more interesting than anything James Bond has embedded in his cufflinks. So much effort was put into bringing these animals to life that it's easy to understand why virtually no time is spent on human characters. The trade off is that virtually no time is spent on a plot - at least, not a plot that anyone, children least of all, would bother caring about.It begins with a German Shepherd police dog named Diggs (voiced by James Marsden), who, because of his inability to follow orders, is placed back into the station kennel. From out of nowhere comes Butch, our Anatolian Shepherd hero from the first film (voiced by Nick Nolte, replacing Alec Baldwin); he brings Diggs to Dogs HQ - a massive dog bowl-shaped underground structure with miles of transportation tubing branching off in all directions - where he's recruited on a mission to save the world from the nefarious Kitty Galore, a rogue hairless Sphinx cat (voiced by Bette Midler). Her evil scheme: Use an orbiting satellite to make all dogs on the planet go mad, thus ending their reign as Man's Best Friend and forever securing cats as the dominant house pet. This, in turn, would enable cats to enslave humanity.Because the lives of humans are at stake, Kitty Galore is also pursued by Catherine (voiced by Christina Applegate), a gray cat for a feline spy network known as M.E.O.W. When she crosses paths with Diggs and Butch, things don't go smoothly. Remember, they're cats and dogs - they hate each other on general principles. But then they come to startling realization: If Kitty Galore is to be stopped, cats and dogs will have to work together. Perhaps this movie was made as an elementary school introduction to racism. Honestly, why do cats and dogs hate each other so much? I have a dream that one day, my pets will grow up in a world where they will not be judged by their species and breed but by the content of their character.Other characters, such as a clueless pigeon (voiced by Katt Williams) and the bow tie-wearing head of M.E.O.W. (voiced by Roger Moore) make their way into the story, as does Lou, returning from the first film as the head of Dog HQ (voice by Neil Patrick Harris, replacing Tobey Maguire). There's also a brief scene with old nemesis Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes), trussed up and muzzled like Hannibal Lecter in Alcatraz; apparently, it's still a working prison when it comes to cats.Meanwhile, Diggs' human partner, Shane (Chris O'Donnell), desperately searches for his canine companion. One wonders why, since it's mentioned that he has a wife and a newborn baby; the last time I checked, your immediate family was more important than a rookie dog cop. One also wonders why Shane was even included. You can count on one hand the number of times he appears in this movie. The same can be said for Kitty Galore's owner, a tacky carnival magician (Jack McBrayer), who serves no real purpose other than to act goofy and make Kitty's life miserable. He's disposable comedy relief, and that's about it. I don't know - it seems to me that, if you're going to include human characters, you should actually do something with them. They should work with the plot and not in spite of it. Of course, that would defeat the purpose of the title's first three words, so I guess I shouldn't be complaining.I've described the plot, but I really have no angle of approach here, except to say that this movie confirmed what I've suspected for years: Catnip is the feline equivalent of marijuana. Oh, and it's in 3-D. In order to see it that way, of course, you have to be willing to pay extra at the box office and to wear uncomfortable glasses the entire time. Can we all agree that, while sometimes it works beautifully, it's generally an overhyped, overused marketing gimmick that doesn't much enhance the experience? What happened to the days of watching a perfectly good flat image? I've praised certain 3-D films, but I'm rapidly growing weary of the process. I'm sure the kids will enjoy it, as they will enjoy all the fun visual effects saturating the screen. Bottom line: ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" didn't do much for me, but it's adequate for the age group it's intended for.",3,Furry Enemies Become Furry Allies,1280448000,"07 30,

1321730,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0034G4OT0,C. Sawin,"[1, 3]","Sometimes certain movies just have this aura about them. Movie posters for these particular films are just pungent with a vile odor while trailers seem to leave the most horrid and putrid taste in your mouth and cause your face to twist and distort as if you were being put through the most despicable forms of torture. You pretty much know, it's like your knee acting up when it rains and you can basically just feel it in your bones that this movie is going to be terrible and is going to be the furthest thing from a pleasant experience. Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore is such a movie.You know you're in for some trouble when you hear a cover of Pink's ""Get This Party Started"" over the opening credits. It feels like it goes on forever. Let the torture begin. You see that twist on Jigsaw's infamous line, ""Let the games begin,"" from the Saw series? You'll be begging to be put into one of Jigsaw's traps by the time this movie is over.The special effects were at their best when they were more subtle. When you could tell that real animals were used and CG was used to only add reactions to the animals or for more human-like facial expressions. But these subtle effects were few and far between, as you can imagine. The film revolves around spy dogs and undercover agent cats after all. Things get exciting, chases heat up, and effects get more extravagant. That's the thing though; you can tell you're just watching something that was created on a computer. They wouldn't be bad if the entire film was CG, but they look really artificial with the real world as their backdrop.After seeing a movie like this, you have to wonder how much some of these actors were offered to do a movie this bad. Did they actually believe in the product or were they just that desperate for a paycheck? It's got to be the latter, right? You've got Cyclops as Diggs (James Marsden), Cape Fear's Sam Bowden as Butch (Nick Nolte), Veronica Corningstone herself as Catherine (Christina Applegate), A Pimp Named Slickback as a pigeon (Katt Williams), Jack McFarland as the feline rip-off of Hannibal Lecter (Sean Hayes), Vizzini (INCONCEIVABLE!) as a calico cat (Wallace Shawn), oh, and Bette Midler as Kitty Galore. Michael Clarke Duncan shows up as an Old English Sheepdog, says a few lines, and you never see him again. Is this the first movie Chris O'Donnell has been in since Vertical Limit? It sure feels that way and it didn't seem like he could get any lower than Vertical Limit until now. Meanwhile, some guy from ""Saturday Night Live"" shows up (Fred Armisen) and plays with a cocker spaniel while Jack McBrayer channels Pee Wee Herman in the most handicapped of ways for some scenes that probably should have been cut in the long run. Neil Patrick Harris and Katt Williams are probably the least offensive and closest thing to actual humor in the movie, but that still isn't much of a compliment.The story is the typical cats against dogs routine with a bit of an edge; an evil cat plans to use a sound that'll be channeled through a satellite orbiting the earth to eventually drive dogs mad and turn against their owners. Since humans are also a potential target, spy dogs and undercover agent cats will have to team up (cue Scooby Doo saying, ""Ruh-roh!""). The story just felt stupid in the long run, especially with all the little side plots going on. Diggs tends to do whatever he wants as a police dog and is reckless, but he learns the error of his ways by...doing nothing but that the entire movie? Then his owner can't find him even though he's practically right under his nose the entire time. Most of the material with human interaction just makes you want to stab yourself in the face with whatever you can get your hands on to keep yourself from having to sit through this monstrosity of a movie any longer. It's a lot like Barney the purple dinosaur if he was replaced with CG cats and dogs; just awful, smash-me-in-the-face-with-a-cinder-block-to-end-this-madness, cutesy, garbage.Lastly, this movie references a lot of movies you know and probably love. The down side is that it feels like sacrilege rather than a shout out to great films. There are countless references to the James Bond franchise; Paws and Kitty Galore illustrate that point fairly well. Everything from Mission: Impossible to Batman to Silence of the Lambs and Terminator. The Batman and Terminator references are low blows, but the Silence of the Lambs one is the worst mostly because it lasts longer than any of the others. Think of those terrible spoof movies like Date Movie and Epic Movie with a slight we're-trying-to-make-this-as-adorable-as-possible-by-shoving-it-down-your-throat edge.Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore is quite possibly the most painful movie watching experience I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Jokes are lame and corny, dialogue feels forced and overacted, popular movie references tarnish the reputation those movies made on society instead of paying homage to them, and the storyline walks a thin line between simple and ludicrous which results in a product that isn't even halfway entertaining. It'd be more appropriate to rate this movie in the amount of times you'll actually groan verbally throughout the movie's duration. It might be fun for children who haven't developed the ability to distinguish a pile of steamy excrement and something that is actually entertaining and it may be amusing to your pet since my dog seemed to enjoy it, but if you have any sort of expectations or qualifications for what a good film should be then you are going to hate this movie or you'll be smart enough to stay away from it

Lebryk,"[3, 4]","Kitty Galore is a stupid funny movie.The first Cats and Dogs was better (Cats & Dogs (Widescreen Version)), the plot made more sense and it was funnier. Kitty Galore is still a funny movie, yes there were major plot holes, the voices weren't nearly as good this time around, and Kitty Galore was very difficult to look at (she was a hairless cat breed - sorry I don't know cat breeds at all).Kitty Galore is a rogue evil spy cat that tries to take over the world. The dogs try to stop her, but discover they have to collaborate with cats from MEOW. Cats and dogs working together???The film is a lampoon of so many other movies, it's almost impossible to list them; Star Wars, Mission Impossible, James Bond (well obviously), Silence of the Lambs, Cheech and Chong, and many others. The connections are obvious and heavy handed. This film was never meant to be subtle from the start.The film is rated PG. Some parents might be offended by the bathroom jokes and the montage at the old lady's house full of cats high on cat nip. The special effects of animals talking is done well. The film was well produced with good camera work. Some of the other special effects were cheesy, especially the ones on the satellite.I laughed a lot at this film. It is stupid beyond imagination. There is nothing socially redeeming or artful about this film, it is just plain old stupid fun. I don't think Cats and Dogs has played out their franchise yet.

He is banned to the kennels until one day a secret under cover dog named Butch (voiced by Nick Nolte) shows up out of no where to recruit him for a top secret mission. A former cat agent named Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) was chased into a vat of fur removal gel by a guard dog and now wants revenge on dogs and mankind.  The movie follows Diggs, Butch and their animal posse as they try to take down the evil Kitty Galore and save their beloved humans.I have to admit, that I went into the movie thinking it was going to be dumbest movie that I seen in a while.  I am not a big fan of talking animal movies and the first 40 minutes proved that I was right on the dumb part. Everyone wanted to laugh, but there was just not much to be excited about. The entire movie theater was in dead silence. The movie mocked every James Bond movie ever made and the action was decent at best.  But as the movie moved along something strange happened: it got funny and it was exciting! Those dogs and cats and that crazy pigeon actually had me enjoying myself and getting into the plot. Bette Midler as Kitty Galore was too funny.

The analogies with James Bond are very strong - from music and opening scene, to the nature of characters and technology like cats and dogs secret agency, fantastic vehicles, and lasers in the dog's collars. There is a pretty female (a cat), a supervisor at the headquarters, fair amount of action, mishaps, lots of luck, and a happy ending. What is missing is originality, novelty, good humor, and the drive which keeps you entertained and involved. I found that this movie oftentimes feels like a poor remake of the old classics. Kids who have not seen James Bond movies could find it more interesting and new for them, the characters are cute, but I was fairly bored and barely made myself watch it to the end.I watched the 3D version and found it average in terms of depth of scenery and effects.What is amazing is animal actors. I am still puzzled which part of the film was shot with trained cats and dogs and which was computer graphics, and how well it was all blended together. It is a virtual reality where the boundary between CG and real life is completely washed out.

He finds a cute little cocker spaniel puppy outside the front door and brings him in. The bloodhound, Rex (Voiced by Len Morganti) is suspicious about the puppy and begins to bark to warn Friedrich. He takes Rex outside and they both get locked outside. Rex runs to the window and sees the puppy taking pictures of secret documents with a spy camera. Rex happens to be a secret agent and quickly calls headquarters.The German Shepard, Diggs (voiced by James Marsden) is a police dog in San Francisco. His human partner is Shane (Chris O'Donnell). When Diggs deliberately disobeys an order out on a police call, he is released from duty and taken to the kennel.Diggs sits in the cage he was put in at the kennel. A secret panel opens in the floor and Butch (voiced by Nick Nolte) rescues Diggs. They both drive through an underground tunnel into the secret headquarters of D.O.G. With Diggs recruited, Butch and him must find the villainess Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) who wants to conquer the world.In order for them to get close to Galore, they must work closely with the cats of M.E.O.W.S. organization.Can the Cats & Dogs work together?Voices of Paul Rodriguez, Neil Patrick Harris, Sean Hayes, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Clarke Duncan, Elizabeth Daily.Many connections to James Bond in this movie:Shirley Bassey sings the theme song, ""Get the Party Started"". She also sang 3 theme songs to the James Bond movies Goldfinger (1964), Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Moonraker (1979).Roger Moore, who was ""James Bond"" in 1973-1985, is the voice of ""Tab Lazenby"" which is a take on George Lazenby who was ""James Bond"" in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).The character ""Kitty Galore"" is a take on the character name ""Pussy Galore"" in Goldfinger (1964), the villainess played by Honor Blackman.DVD running time: 82 minutes.Option of language and subtitles in English, Spanish, French.If you were in the movie theater to see this movie, you were treated to a new CGI-animated cartoon ""Coyote Falls"" with Road Runner and Wyle E.

CGI was improved greatly since the last one, and yet the animals still look like they're mouthing and words are being awkwardly stuffed in them. The original had heart and a good story-line, while this one felt rushed and hastily put together, looking only for money and to give Bette Midler another check (You know your career has reached a dead point when you have to voice a CG animal in a kiddie movie).But allow me to back-track. It's a kid movie, and they'll love it. The colorful scenes and humor will keep them occupied for a while. So for it's purpose- to be a good kid movie- this film succeeds. But it just pains me to see money and talent being poured into sad movies like this nowadays.And perhaps as a final bitter taste in your mouth, the film leans towards a third: by the return of that poofy white cat villain from the original, Tinkles.Oh, joy.",3,Another Talking Dog Movie...,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1316,"['mouths', 'barely', 'move.Perhaps', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'saw', 'flawless', 'Inception', 'watching', 'movie', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Revege', 'Kitty', 'Galore', 'was', 'poor', 'unfunny', 'movie', 'yet', 'add', 'vast', 'collection', 'failed', 'talking', 'movies.The', 'first', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'was', 'tolerable', 'family', 'movie', 'second', 'one', 'clearly', 'was', 'meant', 'just', 'kids', 'was', 'quite', 'bored', 'ended', 'up', 'skipping', 'scenes', 'CGI', 'was', 'improved', 'greatly', 'last', 'one', 'yet', 'animals', 'still', 'look', ""'re"", 'mouthing', 'words', 'are', 'being', 'awkwardly', 'stuffed', 'original', 'had', 'heart', 'good', 'story-line', 'one', 'felt', 'rushed', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'looking', 'only', 'money', 'give', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'check', 'know', 'career', 'reached', 'dead', 'point', 'when', 'have', 'voice', 'CG', 'animal', 'kiddie', 'movie', '.But', 'back-track', 'kid', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'love', 'colorful', 'scenes', 'humor', 'will', 'keep', 'occupied', 'while', 'So', 'purpose-', 'be', 'good', 'kid', 'movie-', 'film', 'just', 'see', 'money', 'talent', 'being', 'poured', 'sad', 'movies', 'nowadays.And', 'perhaps', 'final', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'film', 'towards', 'third', 'return', 'poofy', 'white', 'cat', 'villain', 'original', 'Tinkles.Oh', 'joy']",N/A

To get even, she decides to take over the world by building a satellite that will broadcast a high-pitched sound that only dogs will hear around the globe. The dogs will all go insane from the sound and be imprisoned in kennels. Dogs get wind of the plot and unite with MEOW, an organization of not-evil cats, in a race against time to thwart Kitty's foul plans. There's also a pigeon who follows along for comic relief and he does get off some good jokes. It's supposed to be a James-Bond kind of spoof (""Kitty Galore""/""Pussy Galore,"" get it?), with the cats and dogs sporting a variety of multi-function espionage gadget collars.The film is basically live action with trained animals, though CGI was used for the more outlandish scenes. Bland Chris O'Donnell plays a police officer whose ""difficult"" police dog is removed from duty for insubordination, then gets recruited by the dog spy group while he's in a kennel. The actors voicing the animal characters included Nick Nolte as the experienced dog operative Butch, Bette Midler as Kitty Galore, and Christina Applegate as a good cat whose name I can't recall--I was too busy noticing how EXACTLY she sounded like Sally Field voicing ""Sassy,"" the cat in ""Homeward Bound."" The voice work seems pretty perfunctory. The script was pretty ho-hum, and nobody's motivations made much sense. Why was there a cat in a cosmetics factory?  What cat would ever sit still for magic tricks? At least the movie had the decency to laugh at its own ho-hum-ness once or twice.My seven-year-old was laughing up a storm at the theater and said he loved the movie after we got out, but somewhere along the line, something went sour. The combination of the live action format and the setting in his home town of San Francisco must have made it a little too real for him. He was terrified when Kitty started her satellite launch, and he's been having nightmares and needing a night light again ever since he saw the movie. If he hadn't had the nightmares, I don't think I would have remembered the movie more than an hour after I got out of the theater.

As if the discovery of the antibiotics was not enough to create a new generation of capable actors who could move, run, and perform instead of sitting on cubicles exercising their sicked focal cords, that has remote attachment to the emotionless fake animals. All voices used by the animated animals belong to recognized actors, whom you could easily spot for emphysema, smoking, addiction problems, and obnoxious social demeanor.Kitty Galore's female voice is disturbing and sickening. Her graphic animation should have been enough to convey the same message without the irritating human apathy. Soon, you find yourself distracted by the talking human, rather than the esoteric feature of the animation. Even the content of the dialogue associated closer to a drunkard punch of adults than to the innocent and parallel world of fictional creatures. The same trend of using boring and monotonous sounds on the tongues of animated actors was followed in The Toy Story, Despicable Me, .., on and on.
