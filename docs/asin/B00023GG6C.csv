This has caused them to overlook, however, the film's canyon-sized plot holes and overarching sentimentality.I agree that the film has its good points: the scenery (Parisian street scenes and apartments, the Turkish countryside), the music and, to a lesser degree, Sharif's performance (when it avoids ladling on the syrup). And certain individual scenes work well.Now for the questions:Who is the father, and why is he such a miserable human being?Why did the mother leave? More important, why does she briefly come back?Is there a brother, or not?Is there a Holocaust angle? If not, why? Or why keep it completely oblique?From what planet were the beautiful, sweet, happy prostitutes imported?Does the boy have no peers to rely on (or be corrupted by)?Should a lonely old shopkeeper be thought of as the best and only source of wisdom for a 16-year-old boy?Even if that wisdom doesn't rise above the level of what Forrest Gump would say?If this is supposed to be the early 1960s, why did the word ""Algeria"" not come up in conversation?For some, these questions will be irrelevant, however, given the chance to see an aging Omar Sharif on the screen.

His performance is outstanding and the young boy is also very convincing.  The  film is very characteristically French and looks very much like Paris.  The story is somewhat typical of French coming of age films, but the differences in religion between the boy and the older man make it somewhat different.  The car  trip taken to the 'Golden Horn' by the  boy and M. Ibrahim ties up the film nicely as the older Muslim adopts the Jewish boy at his request, after he has been abandoned by both his mother and his father, whose suicide is only the  most formala part of his earlier taken departure. The boy  is able to con all the neighborhood 'putes' to giving him sexual favors though he is clearly not yet of age, and generally, he learns how to be happy and relate to others through  his relationship with M.

823095,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B00023GG6C,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[5, 5]","I stumbled upon this film quite by happy accident and found myself immediately enthralled.  The potentially sad tale of Moise a fractured teenaged boy living with his wrecked shell of a father, Mom having long ago abandoned both.  Moses lives in a seedy district of Paris in the 1960s, and we begin watching him spying on the prostitutes who line his street.  Moses takes care of his father, doing the cooking, shopping and laundry.  Dad, emotionally abuses the boy, almost going out of his way to insult and belittle the kid who clearly exhibits problems of faulty self-image wavering between the disguise of cocksure arrogance and truly pitiable behavior.  He finds comfort - even if only fleeting - with the local working girls.Befriended by The Arab - Monsieur Ibrahim - an aged Turkish shop keeper, from whom Moses regularly steals the film heads into familiar territory of showing how alike two seemingly different lives can become.  As Ibrahim, Omar Sharif literally lights up the screen with his faith, knowledge and it is clear he loves Moses as he would his own son, the possibility of which Moses hopes may come into play.  Ibrahim's father figure to the young boy is played out brilliantly as he quietly yet strongly shows him the practicalities of living according to one's beliefs.As Moses, Pierre Boulanger is simply terrific in one of the best film debuts for a young actor I've yet come across.  His is a searing, perfectly controlled performance with a fine-tuned balancing act Boulanger striking just the right balance between rebellious teen and needy, neglected child.The film is punctuated with moments possessing an almost indescribable beauty, yet never lets loose of its slightly gritty realism.  This perfectly achieved combination provides a  most magical effect.Director Dupeyron (the thriller ""La Machine"") keeps things moving along at a leisurely pace with such an eye toward detail one can't help but to feel part of the neighborhood.  There is, at times, a voyeuristic aspect to the film; views from angles that could only be seen if looking from a window, or from behind a corner, all of which effectively draws us further into the story.  Even the prostitutes with their endless comings and goings are given ample screen time to exhibit individual touches providing more layers as well as depth of character for the tale.One of the chief joys of the movie is how well integrated the soundtrack is with the story.  A veritable banquet of great 60's era-defining rock `n soul music that provides a world of escape for young Moses.Monsieur Ibrahim is a wonderful coming of age film, exquisitely acted, extraordinarily told and highly recommended.",5,Remarkable Coming of Age Story,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,2677,"['stumbled', 'film', 'quite', 'happy', 'accident', 'found', 'immediately', 'enthralled', 'potentially', 'sad', 'tale', 'Moise', 'fractured', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'living', 'wrecked', 'shell', 'father', 'Mom', 'having', 'long', 'ago', 'abandoned', 'Moses', 'seedy', 'district', 'Paris', '1960s', 'begin', 'watching', 'spying', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'line', 'street', 'Moses', 'care', 'father', 'doing', 'cooking', 'shopping', 'laundry', 'Dad', 'emotionally', 'boy', 'almost', 'going', 'way', 'insult', 'belittle', 'kid', 'who', 'clearly', 'problems', 'faulty', 'self-image', 'wavering', 'disguise', 'cocksure', 'arrogance', 'truly', 'pitiable', 'behavior', 'comfort', 'even', 'only', 'fleeting', 'local', 'working', 'girls.Befriended', 'Arab', 'Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', 'aged', 'Turkish', 'shop', 'keeper', 'whom', 'Moses', 'regularly', 'film', 'heads', 'familiar', 'territory', 'showing', 'how', 'alike', 'two', 'seemingly', 'different', 'lives', 'can', 'become', 'Ibrahim', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'literally', 'up', 'screen', 'faith', 'knowledge', 'clear', 'Moses', 'would', 'own', 'son', 'possibility', 'Moses', 'may', 'come', 'play', 'Ibrahim', 'father', 'figure', 'young', 'boy', 'played', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'quietly', 'yet', 'strongly', 'practicalities', 'living', 'according', 'one', 'beliefs.As', 'Moses', 'Pierre', 'Boulanger', 'simply', 'terrific', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'debuts', 'young', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'come', 'searing', 'perfectly', 'controlled', 'performance', 'fine-tuned', 'balancing', 'act', 'Boulanger', 'striking', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'needy', 'neglected', 'child.The', 'film', 'punctuated', 'moments', 'possessing', 'almost', 'indescribable', 'beauty', 'yet', 'never', 'loose', 'slightly', 'gritty', 'realism', 'perfectly', 'achieved', 'combination', 'most', 'magical', 'effect.Director', 'Dupeyron', 'thriller', 'La', 'Machine', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'such', 'eye', 'detail', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'part', 'neighborhood', 'times', 'voyeuristic', 'aspect', 'film', 'views', 'angles', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'looking', 'window', 'corner', 'effectively', 'further', 'story', 'Even', 'prostitutes', 'endless', 'comings', 'goings', 'are', 'given', 'ample', 'screen', 'time', 'exhibit', 'individual', 'touches', 'providing', 'more', 'layers', 'as', 'well', 'depth', 'character', 'tale.One', 'chief', 'joys', 'movie', 'how', 'well', 'integrated', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'veritable', 'banquet', 'great', '60', 'era-defining', 'rock', 'n', 'soul', 'music', 'world', 'escape', 'young', 'Moses.Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', 'wonderful', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'acted', 'extraordinarily', 'told', 'highly', 'recommended']",Monsieur Ibrahim
823096,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00023GG6C,Grady Harp,"[17, 17]","MONSIEUR IBRAHIM AND THE FLOWERS OF THE KORAN is an exquisite little film. The story is rather simple on the surface: a 16 year old Jewish boy (Moses Schmitt in an extraordinary portrayal by Pierre Boulanger) is coming of age on Blue Street in Paris (a street that features prostitutes plying their wares) in the late 1950s - early 1960s.  His mother deserted both his distant and damaged father (Gilbert Melki) and Moses very early in life and Moses must find his way into adulthood on his own - until he gets to know the 'Arab' (actually an elder Muslim) at the corner grocery (Monsieur Ibrahim brilliantly brought to glowing life by Omar Sharif).  To survive, Moses 'shoplifts' food until M. Ibrahim tells him to take what he wants, knowing that his father deprives him of nearly everything.  The old man is as gentle and calm and serene (""I know what is in my Koran"") as Moses is angry and eager to taste life.  Moses uses saved pennies to buy his first sexual encounter with one of the prostitutes and is gradually befriended by many of the 'heart of gold' streetwalkers.  Slowly Moses and M. Ibrahim are bond and when Moses' father deserts him and commits suicide, M. Ibrahim adopts him, buys a sporty little car and the two are off on a road trip to Turkey (Ibrahim's Persian home).  As the two bond the boy learns much from the spiritually aware old man and we, as the observers, learn much about the differences and similarities of Judaism, Islam, pantheism, and all manifestations of spirtuality.  The ending is somewhat predictable but that doesn't diminish the impact of the film.  This burnished atmosphere of trust and love is magic in the hands of Director Francois Dupeyron and the performances by Sharif and Boulanger are beautifully nuanced and understated.  Even the prostitutes are individuals, not archetypes, and are allowed to deliver tender portrayals of the Oldest Profession.  The only problems with this movie are in the apparently important threads, such as the father's constant mention of 'Paulie' (Moses' brother) who by the end of the story never existed, and in the development of the road trip which veers a bit too far off course to maintain the otherwise perfect momentum.  But small tarnishes, these, and not important enough to prevent this movie as being placed among the more important films of the past year or so.

I think that after recently reviewing I, Robot, Harry Potter III and The Day After Tomorrow I needed a change of pace and watching this beautiful film was a thoroughly pleasant way to spend a Sunday evening.This is a coming-of-age movie set in 1960s Paris about a young Jewish boy, Moses (Momo), with a rapidly-dwindling immediate family and his burgeoning friendship with local Sufi Muslim corner shop keeper, the titular Monsieur Ibrahim. The kid is charming but probably won't be changing any of your prejudices about French teenagers when he becomes the local prostitutes' favourite and romances the girl next door.Sharif shines as Ibrahim, coming on like the friendly uncle you never had, dispensing sage advice to young Momo just when he needs it most. And although there is tragedy lurking behind both protagonists' lives, the film is never maudlin and raises your spirits at the most unlikely times. There are also many gently comic moments such as the menu Momo and Ibrahim put together for Momo's vindictive father or trying to buy a new car with cash. People in the film tend to receive their karmic comeuppance without it seeming too forced or far-fetched.This is a moving, gentle film about the importance of friendship and spirituality. Although set some forty years ago, the message you get at the end is that these things are just as important today and the cyclic nature of history. I thoroughly recommend this film who feels they've overdosed on Hollywood lately and wants a different kind of escapism and assurance on human nature.",4,Tres belle- Perfect Antidote to Summer Blockbusters,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,1775,"['quot', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rent', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'own', 'quot', 'said', 'wife', 'knowing', 'usually', 'need', 'heckling', 'watch', 'something', 'frequent', 'explosions', 'sci-fi', 'quot', 'high', 'concept', 'quot', 'think', 'recently', 'reviewing', 'Robot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'III', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'needed', 'change', 'pace', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'film', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', 'Sunday', 'evening.This', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'set', '1960s', 'Paris', 'young', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'Moses', 'Momo', 'rapidly-dwindling', 'immediate', 'family', 'burgeoning', 'friendship', 'local', 'Sufi', 'Muslim', 'corner', 'shop', 'keeper', 'titular', 'Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', 'kid', 'charming', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'changing', 'prejudices', 'French', 'teenagers', 'when', 'local', 'prostitutes', 'favourite', 'girl', 'next', 'door.Sharif', 'shines', 'Ibrahim', 'coming', 'friendly', 'uncle', 'never', 'had', 'dispensing', 'sage', 'advice', 'young', 'Momo', 'just', 'when', 'most', 'tragedy', 'lurking', 'protagonists', 'lives', 'film', 'never', 'maudlin', 'spirits', 'most', 'unlikely', 'times', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'gently', 'comic', 'moments', 'such', 'menu', 'Momo', 'Ibrahim', 'put', 'together', 'Momo', 'vindictive', 'father', 'trying', 'buy', 'new', 'car', 'cash', 'People', 'film', 'tend', 'receive', 'karmic', 'comeuppance', 'seeming', 'too', 'forced', 'far-fetched.This', 'moving', 'gentle', 'film', 'importance', 'friendship', 'spirituality', 'set', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'message', 'get', 'end', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'important', 'today', 'cyclic', 'nature', 'history', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', ""'ve"", 'overdosed', 'Hollywood', 'lately', 'different', 'kind', 'escapism', 'assurance', 'human', 'nature']",Monsieur Ibrahim

We will witness about a lonely father and his little son; we also notice the figure of the mother is absolutely absent. This man is really absorbed in his thoughts in other ideas and the communication with his son is not even bad; it's inexistent. But at the same time the presence of a kind seller of Arab origin, who attends a small grocery store, will exert the attention this boy in his febrile adolescence demands, with his strong hormones and sexual appetites which are fulfilled by pros who work near his home. A sudden crisis will invade the home, when his father be fired; a letter on the table will inform he has decided to leave him alone with a certain amount of money. In the middle of that terrible solitude our teenager will decide to be adopted by this friendly good man ( superbly  performed by Omar Shariff who deserved a coveted prize as Best Actor in 2003 by the French Academy of Cinema for this magnificent performance).

As young Momo is growing up, it becomes increasingly evident that his parents cannot provide for him the same way Monsieur Ibrahim, a shopkeeper down the street from his apartment, can. Ibrahim enriches his life and gives him advice on growing pains, while Momo assumes the role of apprentice. A lot can be learned through this movie, particularly the environment of Parisian working class neighborhoods and multicultural interactions in 1960s France.Depending on your tastes in abstract ideas, you might be a little turned off by the fact that Monsieur Ibrahim makes statements that neither he nor the movie ever seem to explain. Granted that Sufi discourse is all about vague expressions about Truth and knowledge, but if that's not going to appeal to you, perhaps you should watch something else.

The only disappointment I have is the ending is little bit of a letdown, but otherwise this is a wonderful little film, and highly recommended, even for a young adult.

The only person who shows him any tenderness is ""the Arab"" across the street (who's actually Persian), and the two quickly become friends.If this had been a Hollywood film, the moral questions of Momo's visits to the prostitutes would have been addressed, and that *may* have made for a stronger film. (How odd - saying that a Hollywood touch to a foreign film may have made it better. That's unusual.) After all, it's a rare 16 year old boy who doesn't feel some sense of compunction about visiting prostitutes - or else I'm entirely out of touch with morality. But in a way I'm glad those questions weren't addressed, because it allowed us to see other aspects of his character.While watching the film I wasn't particularly troubled at the lack of emotion Momo displayed when his mother came to claim him (and he pretended he was someone else), but I am now. I'm not suggesting that he should have fallen apart, but all we see are his denials to her and never his emotions. There isn't a chance in the world that her visit didn't stir up some extremely powerful emotions in him. After all, he'd just seen his ""girlfriend"" cheating on him, his father walked out on him, and then learned of his father's suicide. These are moving events, to put it lightly. I feel he should have been more affected.Other questions bother me. All those years at the storefront, and ""the Arab"" elects Momo to befriend and later adopt. Why? I suppose the easy answer is that opportunity hadn't presented itself before, but that's a little tough to swallow.The film was sumptuously shot. The insides of Momo's apartment were perfectly detailed, and leant enormous credibility to the story. Setting means much in film.Questions aside, this was a good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys coming-of-age stories (which seem to, at this point, require their own separate genre).",3,"Touching film, but questions abound",1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2217,"['MONSIEUR', 'IBRAHIM', 'warm', 'tender', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'out', 'new', 'territory', 'still', 'worth', 'watching.Pierre', 'Boulanger', 'young', 'Momo', 'good', 'performance', 'teenager', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'everyone', 'even', 'father', 'whom', 'father', 'semi-tragic', 'not', 'entirely', 'unpredictable', 'suicide', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'tenderness', 'Arab', 'street', 'who', 'actually', 'Persian', 'two', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends.If', 'had', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'moral', 'questions', 'Momo', 'visits', 'prostitutes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'addressed', '*may*', 'have', 'made', 'stronger', 'film', 'How', 'odd', 'saying', 'Hollywood', 'touch', 'foreign', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'unusual', 'rare', '16', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sense', 'compunction', 'visiting', 'prostitutes', 'else', ""'m"", 'entirely', 'touch', 'morality', 'way', ""'m"", 'glad', 'questions', 'were', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'allowed', 'see', 'other', 'aspects', 'character.While', 'watching', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'troubled', 'lack', 'emotion', 'Momo', 'displayed', 'when', 'mother', 'came', 'claim', 'pretended', 'was', 'someone', 'else', 'am', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'should', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'see', 'are', 'denials', 'never', 'emotions', ""n't"", 'chance', 'world', 'visit', 'did', ""n't"", 'stir', 'up', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'emotions', ""'d"", 'just', 'seen', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'father', 'walked', 'out', 'then', 'learned', 'father', 'suicide', 'are', 'moving', 'events', 'put', 'lightly', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'affected.Other', 'questions', 'years', 'storefront', 'Arab', 'Momo', 'befriend', 'later', 'adopt', 'Why', 'suppose', 'easy', 'answer', 'opportunity', 'had', ""n't"", 'presented', 'little', 'tough', 'swallow.The', 'film', 'was', 'sumptuously', 'shot', 'insides', 'Momo', 'apartment', 'were', 'perfectly', 'detailed', 'leant', 'enormous', 'credibility', 'story', 'Setting', 'means', 'much', 'film.Questions', 'aside', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'coming-of-age', 'stories', 'seem', 'point', 'require', 'own', 'separate', 'genre']",Monsieur Ibrahim

Oh, to be young again!Young Moses (Pierre Boulanger), aka ""Momo"", lives in a Parisian apartment in the 1960s with his emotionally distant father (Gilbert Melki). Though he does go to school, Momo's chief responsibility seems to be shopping, cooking, and keeping house for Ol' Dad while the latter is off at his 9 to 5. Moses doesn't remember his mother or an older brother, the former ostensibly dead and the latter off somewhere. Momo is left pretty much to himself, and, though he has a crush on the red-headed Myriam (Lola Naynmark), a girl his age who lives downstairs, the boy spends most of his time watching the prostitutes who solicit trade on the street outside his tenement. On his 16th birthday, Momo decides to do rather than watch, breaks open his piggy bank, and, using his life's savings plus some of his father's grocery money, is relieved of his virginity by Sylvie (Anne Suarez). Thirty-five francs well spent.One day, Dad announces that he's lost his job, and subsequently abandons his son. The police eventually arrive to announce that they found the man's body on the railroad tracks, an apparent suicide. Momo continues to keep the apartment, but sells piecemeal all of a large family library to finance both his food needs and visits to the soiled doves. Nourishment he buys from a small grocery across the street run by an aging Muslim, Monsieur Ibrahim (Omar Sharif), who is himself alone. Ibrahim adopts the boy, buys a flashy red sports convertible, and takes driving lessons. Then, the two set off on a cross-country journey by car to Ibrahim's far off homeland, the Golden Crescent (between Turkey and Persia).MONSIEUR IBRAHIM is both a coming-of-age and a road story that takes place in a more innocent time. Nowadays, an old geezer taking off with a teenage boy would bring out the Child Protection Squad. But the relationship between the two becomes the father-son bond that Momo never had with his real parent. And, by the film's conclusion, it's Ibrahim's wisdom from the Koran, his kindness, and his generosity that stamp Moses for life.This film is a gentle tale with a low-key ending, but nothing extraordinary. I kept waiting for something clever or profound to happen. Since the road trip to Asia Minor seemed farfetched, perhaps it might have been a better story about Momo if the two had remained in Paris and Ibrahim had taught the lad to cope with life around him as it was rather than off in exotic locales, where it seemed more about Ibrahim than the other.

823107,A1IVTR2NM09JEI,B00023GG6C,Laura Grey,"[1, 1]","What a gem. Sixteen-year-old boy Moise (known as Momo) lives in a working-class Jewish district of Paris in the 1960s. He looks after his selfish, depressive father, a man who is never satisfied by anything Momo is or does. Abandoned by his mother as a small child, Momo has never known parental love or kindness, so he seeks womanly tenderness from the prostitutes who work the streets of his neighborhood, and he filches money from his father so he can afford to buy some pleasure. He's sullen and quiet, with no real friends and no one to help him learn about life's possibilities and love's responsibilities.Momo makes daily visits to the local grocery owned by Monsieur Ibrahim (Omar Sharif), a Turkish Sufi who seems to know more about what is in Momo's heart than should be possible. The two strike up a friendship, and Monsieur Ibrahim teaches Momo about loving kindness, about how to make himself more appealing to others so he can get what he wants out of life, about enjoying the world and the people in it. It could have been a paint-by-numbers sort of coming-of-age story, but instead the interactions feel very real and subtle, and Sharif's performance is extraordinary. He brings a real joie de vivre to the role, but in a quiet, understated fashion. Monsieur Ibrahim is a nonjudgmental, spiritual man who finds beauty in his Koran and keeps that beauty in his heart at all times, and his connection with this drifting young Jewish man gives Momo's life meaning and roots while still broadening his horizons, both literally and figuratively.The religions of the two characters impact the story very little. Momo and his father appear to be secular Jews, and Monsieur Ibrahim's Sufi Muslim beliefs are important to him but are flexible and nonjudgmental enough to allow him to show kindness and appreciation for prostitutes, as well as a desire and willingness to understand the beauty in other religions' houses of worship, to which he takes Momo on field trips.Omar Sharif gives a performance of such subtlety and beauty here; he was perfectly cast in the role and he brought much of his own personal experience to it. I always think of Sharif in his blockbuster days, from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Funny Girl,"" in which he gave fine and capable performances, but none of which allowed him moments of introspection.

This is the true depiction of Islam as not taught by the Baptist church. Islam has a very soft side and we fail to see it but the movie does a wonderful depiction of Sufism. Omar Sharif does wonders with his role - you has seen the young Omar Sharif and now it is time for the old Omar Sharif. He has a class which puts him heads and shoulders above rest of the actors and this movie is no different. Pierre Boulanger has also given us an extremely mature performance. Photography is excellent. The back ground music just binds all these together. Omar Sharif reminds me of the characters from Naguid Mahfouze?s books.this is about a French Jewish boy and his adopted father (notice not adopted son) Ibrahim - from inner city Paris to rural Turkey everything is in the palatte and they mix seamlessly.

823109,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00023GG6C,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","Set in the late 1950s, this 2003 French film tells the story of a lonely teenager and the elderly Turkish shopkeeper who befriends him.  Pierre Boulanger, who plays the teenager is supposed to be Jewish, but there was nothing specifically Jewish about him.  I think the writer made him Jewish only because of showing the contrast with the Muslim shopkeeper who is always reading the Koran.However, this film is not about religion.  It is about relationships.  And, with Omar Sharif, now 71 years old, cast in the role of the shopkeeper, the audience is treated to some really fine acting and some very moving scenes.  (As an aside here, I know it was silly of me but I was surprised that Omar Sharif spoke French.)There is a sense of sadness throughout the film as we see the young boy living with his morose and uncaring father.  Even his romantic experiences with the local prostitutes have pathos to it.  And then when he is rejected by a local girl of his own age, we all feel his pain.We smile when the old man buys a sports car.  We smile even more when he has to learn to drive.  And we are enchanted as the boy and the old man take a motor trip to the old man's native Turkey.  Again, I was reminded how it is actually possible to transverse Europe by car and I yearned for the open road myself in those scenes, which basically just showed the sky and the voice of the old man describing the countries they passed through.Sometimes I found the film a bit slow but I was able to relax and get into it.  Often I found it sad.  There was a mood throughout that made the ending inevitable.  And there were pieces of the back-story that seemed to be missing.  However, I did enjoy this slice of life as created by a good director and actors.  But this is not a film for everyone and so I recommend it for those film buffs who can appreciate a good mood piece.",5,The film is not about religion.

In fact, I've difficulty getting my thoughts back on track for this review, I am just so overwhelmed. Yes I read the interesting reviews here, thus chose to rent it, but I did not expect it to be THAT good. But I need to write at least a few words so that I can give it my stamp of FIVE SMILES, and let you know what a wonderful, peaceful, colorful, cosmic, loving, movie this is... and as soon as I am finished writing about it, I shall go buy it because this one is definitely a keeper, a wondrous trip through time and space you want to experience more than once... like each time ""tristesse"" punches you in the gut and you need a little pick me up to reaffirm your faith in the goodness of the human heart.Omar Sharif as Monsieur Ibrahim, gives a totally sincere, and great, performance. He has gracefully graduated from the handsome heartbreaker he was in Dr. Jhivago, to the elderly, wise, warm-hearted Turkish grocery store-owner, of the Sufi faith, living in Paris. If he is the product of Sufism, then, henceforth, I shall be a Sufi.... By the way, I noticed that some of the reviewers here thought he is a Persian. No! He is a Turk, from a remote village deep in Anatolia. Probably, the fact that he is of the Sufi branch of Islam, might have caused this assumption. His roots becomes very clear during his silently emotional and panoramic return to his home town in Turkey. Three wonderful scenes that go a long way in introducing the tolerant spirit of Turkey: when he brings his adopted son Momo, to visit the Orthodox Church, then the Catholic Church, and then aan Islamic mosque, in ISTANBUL.Pierre Boulanger as the young ""Momo"", aka Moses Schmitt, a Jewish adolescent boy abandoned by his mom and later on in the movie, by his dad, gives a riveting performance. He is believable, even in how he holds back his emotions ... yes, even when his long-lost mom shows up unexpectedly, and he, remains outwardly cold, unaffected, and denies her the reunion she is seeking. But, somehow, I felt that I could hear his thumping heart, his will to steel himself against further heartbreak, and his determination to go on with his life.There is more to write about Monsieur Ibrahim, and I hope to continue it tomorrow.

Most of them are either raunchy and vapid, and then others are too introspective and just cloying. Well, this lightweight of a French film, which has gotten rave reviews for Sharif's justifiably great performance, is a little bit of both and - in the end - neither. Ibrahim begins with a toe-tapping, swingin' 60's soundtrack as Moses Schmitt (Pierre Boulanger) practices pickup lines for hookers, and for a while it does seem like a New Wave-inspired flick complete with handheld camera angles and a negletive father. Schmitt, a Jew, soon picks up with the local grocer (Sharif, the title character) who happens to be a Muslim, and as their strange friendship develops, director Duperyon's adaptation reaches high for themes of clashing religion and the shared experiences of the young and old. And for the most part, Ibrahim is an enjoyable ride. I enjoyed its light feel, Boulanger's breakout performance, and the fact that the kid is the uptight cynic and Sharif's Ibrahim turns out to be the wide-eyed life-lover.Unfortunately, though, Ibrahim just can't juggle all of its plot strands and be a truly meaningful film in the end - the neglectful father leaves and Ibrahim adopts, Schmitt's mother drops in, the new father and son take a (lazily edited) road trip...and then the movie ends in a tragedy that you'll see coming a mile away. The movie's short and harmless, by all means, but the movie just doesn't make sense in an emotional way; we never see enough of the developing friendship of Schmitt and Boulanger. And the final tragedy? Well, the dialogue is so ham-handed it seems ripped straight from a novel (which it probably was). As much as I admired and enjoyed the light tone of Ibrahim, intelligently laced with a current of sadness beneath, it never can let the two coexist and just ends up being disappointing.

So why have I given this film only one star?After the third viewing I have reluctantly concluded that the film has a subtle but pervasive undercurrent of anti-Semitism. I say this for the following reasons:(1) The neighborhood of Paris where the film takes place, on the Blue Street, seems to be a prostitution district with many Jewish residents. Many shots of street scenes show Orthodox Jews walking along in the background.(2) The boy's brief fling with the girl who lives in the apartment below him ends when she snarls at him that it is Sabbath and she must get to synagogue and he should get out of her life.(3) The boy's father is a neurotic ineffectual caricature of a Jewish intellectual, fearful, constantly taking laxatives, obsessed with his collection of boring rare books and entirely detached from the life of his son.(4) The only characters who evince compassion for the boy are the street prostitutes, who relate to him like older sisters, and the Moslem shopkeeper (Sharif). The Jewish characters in the film, either his parents or the religious Jews in many background shots, are totally unable to express feeling or emotion or to serve as guides for this boy. They are cold and distant.(5) When the Sharif tells the boy that Moslems are circumcized and the boy asks if this makes him like a Jew, Sharif answers enigmatically ""This is my hand and this is my mouth"" and utterly dismisses the boy's question.(6) On their trip to Istanbul, Sharif brings the boy to see an Orthodox and a Catholic church and a Sufi mosque but not a synagogue, despite the large Jewish population of that famous city.(7) When the boy briefly encounters his mother, who had divorced his father, he tells her that his name is not Moses but Mohammed.Viewers should be aware of this subtle but persistent and insistent undertone of anti-Semitism that marrs an otherwise beautiful film.",1,Subtle Anti-Semitic Film,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,1997,"['have', 'watched', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'marvelous', 'story', 'very', 'touching', 'So', 'why', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'third', 'viewing', 'have', 'reluctantly', 'concluded', 'film', 'subtle', 'pervasive', 'undercurrent', 'anti-Semitism', 'say', 'following', 'reasons', '1', 'neighborhood', 'Paris', 'where', 'film', 'place', 'Blue', 'Street', 'be', 'prostitution', 'district', 'many', 'Jewish', 'residents', 'Many', 'shots', 'street', 'scenes', 'show', 'Orthodox', 'Jews', 'walking', 'along', 'background', '2', 'boy', 'brief', 'fling', 'girl', 'who', 'apartment', 'when', 'snarls', 'Sabbath', 'must', 'get', 'synagogue', 'should', 'get', 'life', '3', 'boy', 'father', 'neurotic', 'ineffectual', 'caricature', 'Jewish', 'intellectual', 'fearful', 'constantly', 'taking', 'laxatives', 'obsessed', 'collection', 'boring', 'rare', 'books', 'entirely', 'detached', 'life', 'son', '4', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'evince', 'compassion', 'boy', 'are', 'street', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'relate', 'older', 'sisters', 'Moslem', 'shopkeeper', 'Sharif', 'Jewish', 'characters', 'film', 'parents', 'religious', 'Jews', 'many', 'background', 'shots', 'are', 'totally', 'unable', 'express', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'serve', 'guides', 'boy', 'are', 'cold', 'distant', '5', 'When', 'Sharif', 'boy', 'Moslems', 'are', 'circumcized', 'boy', 'Jew', 'Sharif', 'enigmatically', 'hand', 'mouth', 'utterly', 'boy', 'question', '6', 'trip', 'Istanbul', 'Sharif', 'boy', 'see', 'Orthodox', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Sufi', 'mosque', 'not', 'synagogue', 'large', 'Jewish', 'population', 'famous', 'city', '7', 'When', 'boy', 'briefly', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'divorced', 'father', 'name', 'not', 'Moses', 'Mohammed.Viewers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'subtle', 'persistent', 'insistent', 'undertone', 'anti-Semitism', 'otherwise', 'beautiful', 'film']",Monsieur Ibrahim

He fancies a girl his own age, who lives in the flat below, but his affections are not met with the same level as his needs. Groping around for direction, he finds acceptance and guidance in the wisdom of the 'Turk' at the corner store where he has purchased and pilfered smallgoods to put meagre meals on the table for himself and his ungrateful dad. Gradually he comes to accept nd trust the wisdom of the old Turk. It's simple stuff, expansive and and accepting of the lad's situation. The old guy has a late-in-life rush of enthusiasm and rescues the boy, laying all his goods at Moses's, (now become Mohammed's) table.The Turk reveals a path that is free of dogma and emotional constraints; a sufi fable of sorts which expresses a wonderfully sympathetic performance from Sharif that will challenge if not eclipse his work as a 60s matinee idol.

823116,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00023GG6C,Roland E. Zwick,"[44, 44]","""Monsieur Ibrahim"" is a fine coming-of-age tale set in 1960's Paris.  Young Pierre Boulanger gives a remarkably assured performance as Moses, a Jewish teen living with his cold, skinflint of a dad in a less-than-savory part of town.  Abandoned by his mother and living in the shadow of a brother who has himself fled the scene, Moses leads an embittered existence, seeking surcease in the beds of the local prostitutes who ply their trade on the street where he lives.  Moses is finally befriended by an aged shopkeeper named Ibrahim Demirdji, a Safi Muslim who, after Moses' father commits suicide, adopts the boy and instills in him valuable life lessons, gleaned from his religious training and his long years of experience.In terms of its storyline, ""Monsieur Ibrahim"" offers little that is new here (the idea of an older mentor figure raising an orphan child of a different religion goes at least as far back as ""The Two of Us"" in 1968 and probably much further) .  Where it excels is in its tenderhearted view of daily life and in its subtle plea for understanding between Arab and Jew.  Moses is an almost heartbreakingly ordinary kid, a fact which makes his story all the more compelling (he has much of the rough-and-tumble poignancy of the boy in ""The 400 Blows"").  We can identify with every emotion he is going through on his painful journey to adulthood: his fears, his insecurities, his need for acceptance, his appreciation of simple kindnesses.  Moses lives in a world where life can sometimes be cruel, but where fellow human beings reach out to help one another in their moments of greatest need.This is a beautiful, heartfelt film that doesn't stand on its head to try and impress us.  It seeps into our hearts one scene at a time, until, by the end, we realize what a profound emotional impact it has had on us.  Veteran actor Omar Sharif is wonderful as the solid and wise Monsieur Ibrahim, but it is Boulanger who is the real revelation here.  This amazing young actor is the true heart and soul of the film, an absolute natural.  He is very rarely off screen, and he rivets our attention on his character in a way that most highly paid movie actors can merely dream about doing.  I hope he makes many more films in the future.",4,starmaking performance,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,2249,"['Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', 'fine', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'set', '1960', 'Paris', 'Young', 'Pierre', 'Boulanger', 'remarkably', 'assured', 'performance', 'Moses', 'Jewish', 'teen', 'living', 'cold', 'skinflint', 'dad', 'less-than-savory', 'part', 'town', 'Abandoned', 'mother', 'living', 'shadow', 'brother', 'who', 'fled', 'scene', 'Moses', 'embittered', 'existence', 'seeking', 'surcease', 'beds', 'local', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'ply', 'trade', 'street', 'where', 'Moses', 'finally', 'befriended', 'aged', 'shopkeeper', 'named', 'Ibrahim', 'Demirdji', 'Safi', 'Muslim', 'who', 'Moses', 'father', 'commits', 'suicide', 'boy', 'instills', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'gleaned', 'religious', 'training', 'long', 'years', 'experience.In', 'terms', 'storyline', 'Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', 'little', 'new', 'here', 'idea', 'older', 'mentor', 'figure', 'raising', 'orphan', 'child', 'different', 'religion', 'least', 'far', 'back', 'Two', 'Us', '1968', 'probably', 'much', 'further', 'Where', 'tenderhearted', 'view', 'daily', 'life', 'subtle', 'plea', 'understanding', 'Arab', 'Jew', 'Moses', 'almost', 'heartbreakingly', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'fact', 'story', 'more', 'compelling', 'much', 'rough-and-tumble', 'poignancy', 'boy', '400', 'Blows', 'can', 'identify', 'emotion', 'going', 'painful', 'journey', 'adulthood', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'need', 'acceptance', 'appreciation', 'simple', 'kindnesses', 'Moses', 'world', 'where', 'life', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'cruel', 'where', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'reach', 'out', 'help', 'one', 'moments', 'greatest', 'need.This', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'film', ""n't"", 'stand', 'head', 'try', 'impress', 'hearts', 'one', 'scene', 'time', 'end', 'realize', 'what', 'profound', 'emotional', 'impact', 'had', 'Veteran', 'actor', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'wonderful', 'solid', 'wise', 'Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', 'Boulanger', 'who', 'real', 'revelation', 'here', 'amazing', 'young', 'actor', 'true', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'absolute', 'natural', 'very', 'rarely', 'screen', 'attention', 'character', 'way', 'most', 'highly', 'paid', 'movie', 'actors', 'can', 'merely', 'dream', 'doing', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'films', 'future']",Monsieur Ibrahim

Its central characters are a 16-year-old boy, living alone with a despondent and emotionally distant father, and an ageing proprietor of a small neighborhood grocery. Although the boy is Jewish and the old man Muslim, they form a friendship that begins to fill the loneliness in each other's lives. The boy, eager to become a man in the only way he knows how, by practicing pick-up lines in the mirror and having his first experiences with the women who work the street outside his window, also develops a romantic attachment to a girl who lives downstairs.Meanwhile, the old man tries to teach him the values of simple humanity that he has learned from a lifetime of reading and studying his Koran. And as he slowly wins the boy's trust, the two of them journey by car to the old man's home in Turkey, where the boy learns more of what is required of becoming a man.Brightly colorful, with a soundtrack of 1960s jazz and pop songs, the film is a loving recreation of a time and place. The young actor Pierre Boulanger is charmingly at ease in front of the camera and fully believable.

His charisma is infectious as he spews aphorisms left and right. And his counterpart, a young boy going astray, does a poignant turn of coming of age. As he explores his budding sexuality and navigates the trials of his first love, he comes into the sphere of the elderly grocer's friendship and some interesting interactions ensue.The first 60% of the movie contains several small pleasures, including the boy's interaction with ""worker"" women , the way he and the grocer play trivial tricks on his father, his infatuation with a local girl, and his trip to buy a new car. Unfortunately, the movie pretty much loses its way after that, as the two protagonists take to the road for a trip to Turkey.The ending is ambiguous in an unsatisfying way, and, although there is a definitive denouement, I left the film not seeming to care as much about the fates of the protagonists as I would have liked to.Yet, for its enthralling views of Turkey and the fun histrionics of Sharif, I'd surely recommend this as a decent rental.

The key is telling a story in an original way. This is probably why MONSEUR IBRAHIM succeeds. The film is set in 1960's France and it tells the story of a young Jewish teen named Moses, who is a lost soul of sorts. He had a distant father who abandons him and later dies in an apparent suicide. He has been deserted by his mother as well, and there is an ambiguous missing ""Paulie"" who is his brother. Moses is not living up to Paulie's status, though we never know if Paulie existed (keep in mind this is a French film). Moses is left to his own devises much of the time which leads him into petty thievery from a neighborhood grocery store and some hookups with the local prostitutes. He strikes up an unlikely friendship with the neighborhood ""Arab"" grocery store owner Ibrahim played by the legendary Omar Shariff. He is a Sufi Muslim who takes Moses under his wing and later adopts him, teaching him the lessons of his faith more by exposure and example rather than words. He is nurturing but this is all done in a rather unsentimental way.The film is short (approx. 90 minutes) and its brevity may be the problem. The Paulie situation is never resolved and the ending is somewhat unsatisfying, but these flaws by no means ruin the story and it is an overall enjoyable film.",4,En Enjoyable and Heart Warming Film,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1478,"['story', 'alienated', 'youth', 'discovering', 'lessons', 'life', 'older', 'mentor', 'common', 'plotline', 'film', 'literature', 'plotline', 'seem', 'never', 'tire', 'seeing', 'reading', 'key', 'telling', 'story', 'original', 'way', 'probably', 'why', 'MONSEUR', 'IBRAHIM', 'film', 'set', '1960', 'France', 'story', 'young', 'Jewish', 'teen', 'named', 'Moses', 'who', 'lost', 'soul', 'sorts', 'had', 'distant', 'father', 'who', 'later', 'dies', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'been', 'deserted', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'ambiguous', 'missing', 'Paulie', 'who', 'brother', 'Moses', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'Paulie', 'status', 'never', 'know', 'Paulie', 'existed', 'keep', 'mind', 'French', 'film', 'Moses', 'left', 'own', 'devises', 'much', 'time', 'petty', 'thievery', 'neighborhood', 'grocery', 'store', 'hookups', 'local', 'prostitutes', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'neighborhood', 'Arab', 'grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'Ibrahim', 'played', 'legendary', 'Omar', 'Shariff', 'Sufi', 'Muslim', 'who', 'Moses', 'wing', 'later', 'adopts', 'teaching', 'lessons', 'faith', 'more', 'exposure', 'example', 'rather', 'words', 'nurturing', 'done', 'rather', 'unsentimental', 'way.The', 'film', 'short', 'approx', '90', 'minutes', 'brevity', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'Paulie', 'situation', 'never', 'resolved', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying', 'flaws', 'means', 'ruin', 'story', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'film']",Monsieur Ibrahim
823121,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00023GG6C,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 5]","After the critical and commercial debacle of '13 Warriors,' Omar Sharif made a public announcement to retire, disgusted with the meaningless roles he had to endure.  But he came back -- well, many do after all -- but with a good reason this time, namely, to play Monsieur Ibrahim, a Turkish grocery store owner who teaches a few precious things about life to a Jewish boy living across the street.Though the film is partly a parable about the relation between two peoples (as Timmy Thomas song 'Why Can't We Live Together' implies at the opening), it is basically about the two characters -- Ibrahim, an aged store owner who watches over a teenage boy 'Momo' played effectively by a newcomer Pierre Boulanger.13-year-old Jewish boy Momo is living in Blue Street, Paris, in the early 60s, where many women stand in the street, waiting for their 'customers.'  In there, Momo is rapidly growing, sexually or otherwise.  But his father, not without love for him, is too busy about something else, and does not notice it.But M. Ibrahim (Sharif, in great form) running a store across the street knows it, and even is aware that Momo is frequently shoplifting food from his shelves.  Ibrahim seems to know everything about him, the boy starts to sense, and Momo begins to be interested in this old man.The short film (about 95 mins) are too episodic, and not every element goes well together.  The film often becomes sentimental especially the last chapter, and if you do not see carefully, you might miss the cameo of one French star (as ... the Star ... why not, anyway).But the film has one great thing about it, the star presence of Omar Sharif, who literally shines like one.  He becomes Ibarahim, immigrant from Turkey, and Monsieur's lessons on life, which in themselves are not specially new, begin to sound authentic with Sharif's voice.  It is as if the real Sharif has become the teacher to the real Boulanger. and we are watching it.Despite the sudden ending that I think need more tact, 'Monsieur Ibrahim' is still a little gem that does not need explanations.

They also are poplular with audiences and critics. If ""Monsieur Ibrahim"" didn't do big box office, it did impress critics, and it launched the career of the beguiling young French actor Pierre Boulanger. He is the heart of this beautifully produced film, just as beautifully transfered to DVD. Its soul, however, belongs to an aging matinee idol, the ageless Omar Shariff.Boulanger is perfect as a 16-year-old Jewish boy whose uncaring parents desert him; when his father commits suicide, he's left alone in a Parisian apartment. Only neighborhood prostitutes, a cute girl downstairs, and an old Arab grocer trouble to notice him and, in their own ways, befriend the lad. It is a credit to the writer, director and cast of this little gem that these stereotypes register as real people and that the movie they are in never jerks tears or becomes maudlin.""Monsieur Ibrahim"" has honest sentiment, thanks to Boulanger and to a supremely humane performance by Shariff. He's not an Arab, the boy learns, but a Muslim. Using his Koran as a guidebook, the old man mentors the boy, then adopts him and, in a new red convertible, takes him on a journey to Turkey, the sea, and the village of his birth, where he dies. That's the story but it isn't what this movie is about. The bonds between Muslim and Jew, father and son, adult and child, these are what we are asked to consider.One of its refreshments is the way it treats the sexuality of the boy, who undertakes his liaisons with curiosity, pride and gratitude. Another surprise is the spare, actor-friendly script, which does not sermonize themes that seem to call for a pulpit. Indeed, ""Monsieur Ibrahim"" scores higher on its small scale than do large scale movies on targets much easier to hit. When the old man buys the boy a pair of shoes, it's a simple gesture but their delight in one another is palpable.

Marshall,"[3, 3]","This French film is a charming tale of a boy coming of age during the 1960's while living in Paris.The story takes place on a busy little ""blue"" street in Paris during the 60's. A Jewish boy looks out his window each day awaiting his father's return from work and he sees the hustle and bustle of his neighborhood street come alive before his young eyes. He is on the verge of growing up and is fascinated by the street women and what they offer. Along the way he befriends an ""Arab,"" the man who runs the corner grocery from Monday-Sunday. Together these two souls create a world as one, forgetting their age differences, religious differences and their placement in society. It is a lovely tale of growing up and finding true inspiration without the influence of anything but the heart.Omar Sharif is marvelous as the older Arab man, he is allowed to look older and scruffy rather than all dolled up in this quiet role. His smile is ever present and he portrays his role with great character. Playing the young man is Pierre Boulanger; a brilliant young French actor who I predict is going places. Boulanger is the perfect blend of innocence and youthful desire, handsome enough to be attractive as a man but boyish enough to still be naively curious. Together these actors form a wonderful team of youth and wisdom beyond what is captured on the screen.This film is relevant for today showing the perfect blend that can be found within cultural, religious and age differences when two people accept one another without prejudice. The message is clear, we are really one. This movie may be on the simple side but the idea is as complicated as growing up. With Paris as the backdrop of this striking tale it is impossible to fall short in the point it delivers.",4,Fantastique,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,1762,"['French', 'film', 'charming', 'tale', 'boy', 'coming', 'age', '1960', 'living', 'Paris.The', 'story', 'place', 'busy', 'little', 'blue', 'street', 'Paris', '60', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'out', 'window', 'day', 'awaiting', 'father', 'return', 'work', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'neighborhood', 'street', 'come', 'alive', 'young', 'eyes', 'verge', 'growing', 'up', 'fascinated', 'street', 'women', 'what', 'offer', 'way', 'Arab', 'man', 'who', 'corner', 'grocery', 'Monday-Sunday', 'Together', 'two', 'souls', 'create', 'world', 'one', 'forgetting', 'age', 'differences', 'religious', 'differences', 'placement', 'society', 'lovely', 'tale', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'true', 'inspiration', 'influence', 'anything', 'heart.Omar', 'Sharif', 'marvelous', 'older', 'Arab', 'man', 'allowed', 'look', 'older', 'rather', 'dolled', 'up', 'quiet', 'role', 'smile', 'ever', 'present', 'role', 'great', 'character', 'Playing', 'young', 'man', 'Pierre', 'Boulanger', 'brilliant', 'young', 'French', 'actor', 'who', 'predict', 'going', 'places', 'Boulanger', 'perfect', 'blend', 'innocence', 'youthful', 'desire', 'handsome', 'enough', 'be', 'attractive', 'man', 'boyish', 'enough', 'still', 'be', 'naively', 'curious', 'Together', 'actors', 'form', 'wonderful', 'team', 'youth', 'wisdom', 'what', 'captured', 'screen.This', 'film', 'relevant', 'today', 'showing', 'perfect', 'blend', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'cultural', 'religious', 'age', 'differences', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'accept', 'one', 'prejudice', 'message', 'clear', 'are', 'really', 'one', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'side', 'idea', 'as', 'complicated', 'growing', 'up', 'Paris', 'backdrop', 'striking', 'tale', 'impossible', 'fall', 'short', 'point']",Monsieur Ibrahim
823124,A2W7GQG04QCEVT,B00023GG6C,Wendell,"[6, 7]","Really enjoyed this film. Omar Sharif is excellent in it. It's inspiring, really, to see him willing to play an aging Persian man, humble, wise, without grandeur, working in a shop far from his home country. For him, it must be far away from heady youthful the days of Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, and yet that's appropriate. We all age. We may develop bad teeth. But it doesn't mean we can't brilliantly contribute to art about the human drama. It's wonderful, also, to watch a Moslem and Jew interact as almost father and son, miles away from the current craziness in the news everyday.I enjoyed the somewhat more familiar French boy coming of age story also. Actually, he's not so much coming of age as he is coming into his sexuality. Same thing, maybe, for some people. This material didn't seem entirely fresh, but balanced beside the relationship with Omar Sharif's character it creates a rich portrait of a time and place in France, and, later, of the wide open spaces of the Middle East. Highly recommended.",4,Omar Sharif is excellent.
