704222,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B0000687FL,Ace-of-Stars,"[7, 7]","*Spotlighted as one of the most expensive & highest grossing domestic Korean films to date (ranking third in overall audience attendance in Korea for a domestic film, just behind ""Chingu"" [""Friend""] and ""Shiri"" [or ""Swiri""],  and just ahead of the quirky romantic comedy ""Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo"" [aka ""My Sassy Girl""], ""JOINT SECURITY AREA"" -- (Korean title: ""Gongdong Kyeongbi Kuyeok - JSA"") -- is one of those stories which starts off confusingly, but by the end ties everything together neatly and beautifully with some of the most sincere and genuine raw emotion ever experienced in a feature film.""JSA"" begins with a couple of contradictory flashbacks of an assassination-type event which takes place in a guardshack North of the DMZ (demilitarized zone) in the Joint Security Area, each based on the 'official version' of the story as propogated by North and South. As the film progresses, we are pulled along by a third and equally contradictory flashback, this one apparently revealing the truth not only of that fateful night's event which nearly ignited a small war between the two Koreas, but also giving us insight as to what led up to that point, and does so very tenderly and emotionally.The story revolves around an 'illegal' friendship forged between two pairs of soldiers stationed on opposite sides of the DMZ in the Joint Security Area, which began as a result of a nighttime border patrol team in the South getting disoriented and venturing too far north, accidently venturing into Kim Jung-Il's Communist state where one of the soldiers gets separated from the rest of the group and becomes stranded under frightening and dire circumstances in what is one of the most tense and dramatic moments of the film.A secret correspondence is later initiated by the prodigal Southern soldier with the two Northern soldiers he encountered on that harrowing night. Before long, he receives an invitation to 'cross over the bridge which divides the two Koreas'-- literally and figuratively --and almost without hesitation accepts the offer to drop in for an ""unauthorized (to say the least) visit.""No 'sensative secrets' are ever revealed or exchanged during these illegal meetings (as one of the Southern soldiers declares, ""We don't know anything, anyway""); What 'secrets' ARE exchanged, though, are those which come from the heart: stories of friends, family, homelife, personal goals, and hopes for a reunified nation of ""brothers"" fractured by ideological differences. It was also a nice touch that never at any time-- except in a moment of genuine curiousity or as a gesture of offered protection --does anyone of either side try to entice any of the others to defect to the other side.But as with all beautifully and honestly executed thought-provoking cinematic masterpieces, something goes terribly wrong during one of the illegal visits, which results in ""murder"" (quote/unquote), cover-up, and threatened outbreak of war. It is left to a neutral investgative board to uncover the truth of what took place on that dark rainy night, and the case is assigned to a Korean native raised in Switzerland who carries with her a secret of her own which could raise questions about her 'objectivity' and very likely jeopardize her investigation even as the truth gradually unfolds .Why this film never saw nationwide theatrical release in the U.S., apart from a few sporadic ""film festival"" venues, is completely beyond my comprehension. Perhaps seeing how well made this movie was, and how it held its own in its homeland by practically putting ""Titanic's"" Korean box office recepts to shame, maybe Hollywood got scared that its ego would get bruised even further if American audiences (already apathetic and dissatisfied with the declining quality of Hollywood films and their self-eroding committment to excellence) had wide access to this ""foreign"" film and responded favorably, as they surely would have.Unlike many foreign films, which sometimes require a considerable amount of knowledge of the native culture to be genuinely appreciated and/or enjoyable, ""Joint Security Area"" is truly an ""international"" film, one to which anyone anywhere can easily relate. If allowed, this one movie could probably do a much more effective job of moving Korean reunification talks forward than all of the bureaucratic 'diplomacy' of the past decade.* * *",5,"""JSA"" stands for ""Just Simply Awesome!""

704223,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0000687FL,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[20, 21]","One incredible tightly-woven story drives this political thriller of friends and enemies along the Joint Security Area (JSA) between North and South Korea.An apparent exchange of hostilities leaves two soldiers of the North Korean Army dead. Another is wounded, and a fourth soldier -- a South Korean soldier -- appears to be the hero ... but is he? As both sides refuse to allow an investigation to prove anything conclusive, a Neutral Nations officer -- a woman -- is brought in to uncover the truth ... but will she?Being perfectly honest, I purchased JSA solely on the basis of the recommendation of AZNFilms.com, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. Comparisons to SHIRI are very off-base in that -- politics aside -- SHIRI is a great formula action film from start to finish ... but JSA is a pure political thriller. It is a 'thinking man's action film' where the action is a result of the plot and not because of the character's motivations (with one notable exception I won't give away to spoil the surprise). However, this film's script keeps you guessing and even delivers tremendous surprise up until the very last frame!Again, JSA is not intended for fans of the John Woo mentality (and I'm a huge fan of Woo's work). This is a drama -- which deservedly won many at the Korean Film Awards -- but certainly stands up to most American films easily. In fact, I would have to say that I never saw what all of the excitement was about MYSTIC RIVER -- a rather conventional crime drama -- but there's plenty to get excited about in JSA.I'll be watching this one again this weekend.",5,Toe The Line,1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,1609,"['One', 'incredible', 'tightly-woven', 'story', 'drives', 'political', 'thriller', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Joint', 'Security', 'Area', 'JSA', 'North', 'South', 'Korea.An', 'apparent', 'exchange', 'hostilities', 'two', 'soldiers', 'North', 'Korean', 'Army', 'dead', 'wounded', 'fourth', 'soldier', 'South', 'Korean', 'soldier', 'be', 'hero', 'sides', 'refuse', 'allow', 'investigation', 'prove', 'anything', 'conclusive', 'Neutral', 'Nations', 'officer', 'woman', 'brought', 'uncover', 'truth', 'will', 'Being', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'purchased', 'JSA', 'solely', 'basis', 'recommendation', 'AZNFilms.com', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'least', 'Comparisons', 'SHIRI', 'are', 'very', 'off-base', 'politics', 'aside', 'SHIRI', 'great', 'formula', 'action', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'JSA', 'pure', 'political', 'thriller', ""'thinking"", 'man', 'action', 'film', 'where', 'action', 'result', 'plot', 'not', 'character', 'motivations', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'However', 'film', 'script', 'guessing', 'even', 'delivers', 'tremendous', 'surprise', 'up', 'very', 'last', 'frame', 'Again', 'JSA', 'not', 'intended', 'fans', 'John', 'Woo', 'mentality', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Woo', 'work', 'drama', 'deservedly', 'won', 'many', 'Korean', 'Film', 'Awards', 'certainly', 'up', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'easily', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'never', 'saw', 'what', 'excitement', 'was', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'rather', 'conventional', 'crime', 'drama', 'plenty', 'get', 'excited', 'JSA.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'again', 'weekend']",Joint Security Area
704224,A20JXCREBFYS4T,B0000687FL,Henry H. S. Yoon,"[3, 4]","Joint Security Area drew many comparisons with Shiri, as it dealt with the same conflict and had some of the actors in both films.  Joint Security Area (often referred as JSA by Korean audience)  is not an action film per se, as Shiri was, and the story takes place in the Demilitarized Zone, an area that serves as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea, and describes the relationship between a South Korean soldier who befriends North Korean soldiers.  Interestingly, JSA drew more audience than Shiri.JSA is not an action film as Shiri was, but rather focused its theme to the unreal place, which is the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ.  DMZ is a neutral piece of land between the Koreas, where tensions are high due to possible military engagment by North Korea.  If a war was to take place again, it would start from DMZ.  Yet somehow a South Korean soldier finds friendship with couple of North Korean soldiers, and despite the initial hostility, they find common culural ties within themselves and grow close to each other.I liked JSA far better than Shiri, as it dealt with characters who were more believable and apporachable as compared to Shiri.  The atmosphere of the DMZ is captured quite nicely also.  It is simply a better film.  JSA is certainly a milestone in Korean cinema, albeit in a different way Shiri was.",4,More subtle approach to the conflict at hand,1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,1335,"['Joint', 'Security', 'Area', 'drew', 'many', 'comparisons', 'Shiri', 'same', 'conflict', 'had', 'actors', 'films', 'Joint', 'Security', 'Area', 'often', 'referred', 'JSA', 'Korean', 'audience', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'se', 'Shiri', 'was', 'story', 'place', 'Demilitarized', 'Zone', 'area', 'buffer', 'zone', 'North', 'Korea', 'South', 'Korea', 'relationship', 'South', 'Korean', 'soldier', 'who', 'North', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'Interestingly', 'JSA', 'drew', 'more', 'audience', 'Shiri.JSA', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'Shiri', 'was', 'rather', 'focused', 'theme', 'unreal', 'place', 'Demilitarized', 'Zone', 'DMZ', 'DMZ', 'neutral', 'piece', 'land', 'Koreas', 'where', 'tensions', 'are', 'high', 'due', 'possible', 'military', 'engagment', 'North', 'Korea', 'war', 'was', 'take', 'place', 'again', 'would', 'start', 'DMZ', 'somehow', 'South', 'Korean', 'soldier', 'finds', 'friendship', 'couple', 'North', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'initial', 'hostility', 'find', 'common', 'culural', 'ties', 'grow', 'close', 'other.I', 'liked', 'JSA', 'far', 'better', 'Shiri', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'believable', 'apporachable', 'compared', 'Shiri', 'atmosphere', 'DMZ', 'captured', 'quite', 'nicely', 'also', 'simply', 'better', 'film', 'JSA', 'certainly', 'milestone', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'albeit', 'different', 'way', 'Shiri', 'was']",Joint Security Area

One night there is an exchange of fire across the JSA that interrupts the progress between the nations.

The South says that North tried to kidnap a South Korean solider, while the North states that a South Korean solider went amok.

704226,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B0000687FL,Ping Lim,"[5, 8]","This offering reminds me so much of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;.  The movie started by laying out the groundwork, of soldiers from both North &amp; South Korea died in a conflict.  It's up to a neutral party, which is unbiased towards North &amp; South Korea to be involved in the investigation.  The investigator was in the form of this beautiful &amp; intelligent officer.  She claimed to be in the military and from Switzerland.  Yet, her slim physique told me otherwise &amp; at times, it was bleeming difficult to understand her English &amp; one could only imagine how many times she would need to rehearse to read her lines properly.  Anyhow, the question about who did it &amp; why were what made this movie so interesting.  In the end, the twisting end would definitely caught you by surprise.  Along the way, we were given a succinct but concise explanation about the origin of DMZ and the reason why Koreans from 1950's Korean War were scattered throughout the world.  Then, the investigator's family background came back to haunt her &amp; she started to question about her own identity and about where her allegiance belonged to.  In the end, it doesn't matter because among the craziness of the world, humanity prevails.  Still, the notion about family members being segregated from one another for more than half a century by one line due to ideological difference is brought to forefront.  Moreover, we are also reminded constantly about the fragile truce between North &amp; South Korea and a slight misunderstanding would undoubtedly start a civil war and would most certainly disturb the peace in the East Asia region.  A very well-made movie with tight script &amp; good composition.  Highly recommended.  What made this movie different from &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; is that it doesn't provide a pedestal for the superstars to show off their acting skills but rather, all actors &amp; actresses are making a cohesive effort to make this movie fluid and effective, which they have done to almost perfection.

All three carried similar messages: War is absurd; in a paranoid and hostile world, reason, intellect and humanity are no match for some lunatics or brain-washed zealots. (BTW, I think Americanization of Emily should've ended with the Omaha Beach landing scene.) All three are extremely apt in driving their powerful messages home.
