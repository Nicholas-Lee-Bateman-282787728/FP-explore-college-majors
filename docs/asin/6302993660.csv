349682,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302993660,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 6]","A story where the action takes place in two closely related time zones is a first, and this forms the crux of Mawdryn Undead.  A weaselly red-haired schoolboy, Turlough, is recruited by the Black Guardian (q.v. The Armageddon Factor) to kill the Doctor in exchange for a return to his home planet.The Doctor and his companions materialize inside a spaceship set in a warp ellipse around Earth.  Someone aboard the ship transmatted to Earth six years before.  The Doctor, who meets Turlough aboard the ship, goes to the present, 1983, to fix the transmat equipment on Earth, planning for Nyssa and Tegan to follow him on the TARDIS.  However, they get diverted to 1977.  The transmat appears, where they encounter who they think is a horribly burned Doctor.  Tegan runs to Brendon School for help, where she meets the Brigadier.The reappearance of the Brigadier for the first time since Terror Of The Zygons is welcome.  However, when the Brigadier tells the schoolboy Ibbetson, ""Take it from me, boy.  A solid object just can't dematerialize,"" we know something's going on.  Evidence of that is proved further when he doesn't remember who the Doctor or the TARDIS is.  And when he says fondly, ""How could I forget?""  The Doctor says ""Exactly.""  So should the viewer.  How could one of the Doctor's closest associates forget?  We learn that the Brigadier suffered a nervous breakdown in 1977, and that he did meet Tegan.  The Doctor tries to get him to remember, and as we learn later, what happened to the Brigadier is indeed the cause of his breakdown.  The Brigadier has a good line in this:  ""After all, if I was to suffer from amnesia, I'd be the first to know.""The setting of Mawdryn's ship is impressive with its red and gold ornate decor.  One of Mawdryn's associates sees the 1977 Brigadier and refers to him as a deviant, meaning that he shouldn't be aboard the ship, as his 1983 self is also there.  Deviant... now there's a double meaning.Nyssa and Tegan's personalities are easily discernible here.  Nyssa is more logical, trusting, while Tegan is more tough-minded, less trusting, and values security and familiarity.  One exchange between them regarding Turlough is good.  Tegan:  ""Nobody from Earth is just going to walk into a transmat capsule.""  Nyssa:  ""As you did in the TARDIS on the Barnett Bypass?""  Game, set, and match to Nyssa, I think.The late Valentine Dyall provides a strong menacing presence as the Black Guardian, as evidenced by his effectively harsh demonic voice.  And Nicholas Courtney plays the Brig as if he never took a hiatus from the character.Links to the show's past are shown when the Brigadier regains his memory, via black-and-white clips of various adventures, Doctors, and companions.  The homing device from Full Circle makes another appearance here, as does the Fourth Doctor's red coat, worn by Mawdryn.  There is a subtle clue that the Doctor knows about the Black Guardian's involvement.  He finds Turlough's crystal, which the BG gave him.  Presumably, it's made from the same material as the Key To Time.This is yet another of producer John Nathan-Turner's trilogies, presenting a villain out to get the Doctor and phasing out one companion for another.  In this case, Nyssa leaves the TARDIS crew in the next story, Terminus, while Turlough joins the crew.Mawdryn Undead shows that it's possible to have a story that's fascinating without having sensational alien monsters.",4,The Black Guardian's back... but so's the Brigadier,1012694400,"02 3, 2002",2002,3428,"['story', 'where', 'action', 'place', 'two', 'closely', 'related', 'time', 'zones', 'first', 'crux', 'Mawdryn', 'Undead', 'weaselly', 'red-haired', 'schoolboy', 'Turlough', 'recruited', 'Black', 'Guardian', 'q.v', 'Armageddon', 'Factor', 'kill', 'Doctor', 'exchange', 'return', 'home', 'planet.The', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'materialize', 'spaceship', 'set', 'warp', 'ellipse', 'Earth', 'Someone', 'aboard', 'ship', 'transmatted', 'Earth', 'six', 'years', 'before', 'Doctor', 'who', 'Turlough', 'ship', 'present', '1983', 'fix', 'transmat', 'equipment', 'Earth', 'planning', 'Nyssa', 'Tegan', 'follow', 'TARDIS', 'However', 'get', 'diverted', '1977', 'transmat', 'where', 'encounter', 'who', 'think', 'horribly', 'burned', 'Doctor', 'Tegan', 'Brendon', 'School', 'help', 'where', 'Brigadier.The', 'reappearance', 'Brigadier', 'first', 'time', 'Terror', 'Zygons', 'welcome', 'However', 'when', 'Brigadier', 'schoolboy', 'Ibbetson', 'Take', 'boy', 'solid', 'object', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dematerialize', 'know', 'something', 'going', 'Evidence', 'proved', 'further', 'when', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'Doctor', 'TARDIS', 'when', 'fondly', 'How', 'could', 'forget', 'Doctor', 'Exactly', 'So', 'should', 'viewer', 'How', 'could', 'one', 'Doctor', 'closest', 'associates', 'forget', 'learn', 'Brigadier', 'suffered', 'nervous', 'breakdown', '1977', 'did', 'meet', 'Tegan', 'Doctor', 'tries', 'get', 'remember', 'learn', 'later', 'what', 'happened', 'Brigadier', 'indeed', 'cause', 'breakdown', 'Brigadier', 'good', 'line', 'was', 'suffer', 'amnesia', ""'d"", 'be', 'first', 'know', 'setting', 'Mawdryn', 'ship', 'impressive', 'red', 'gold', 'ornate', 'decor', 'One', 'Mawdryn', 'associates', '1977', 'Brigadier', 'refers', 'deviant', 'meaning', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ship', '1983', 'self', 'also', 'there', 'Deviant', 'now', 'double', 'meaning.Nyssa', 'Tegan', 'personalities', 'are', 'easily', 'discernible', 'here', 'Nyssa', 'more', 'logical', 'trusting', 'Tegan', 'more', 'tough-minded', 'less', 'trusting', 'values', 'security', 'familiarity', 'One', 'exchange', 'regarding', 'Turlough', 'good', 'Tegan', 'Nobody', 'Earth', 'just', 'going', 'walk', 'transmat', 'capsule', 'Nyssa', 'did', 'TARDIS', 'Barnett', 'Bypass', 'Game', 'set', 'match', 'Nyssa', 'think.The', 'late', 'Valentine', 'Dyall', 'strong', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Black', 'Guardian', 'evidenced', 'effectively', 'harsh', 'demonic', 'voice', 'Nicholas', 'Courtney', 'Brig', 'never', 'took', 'hiatus', 'character.Links', 'show', 'past', 'are', 'shown', 'when', 'Brigadier', 'memory', 'black-and-white', 'clips', 'various', 'adventures', 'Doctors', 'companions', 'homing', 'device', 'Full', 'Circle', 'appearance', 'here', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'red', 'coat', 'worn', 'Mawdryn', 'subtle', 'clue', 'Doctor', 'Black', 'Guardian', 'involvement', 'Turlough', 'crystal', 'BG', 'gave', 'Presumably', 'made', 'same', 'material', 'Key', 'Time.This', 'yet', 'producer', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'trilogies', 'presenting', 'villain', 'get', 'Doctor', 'phasing', 'out', 'one', 'companion', 'case', 'Nyssa', 'TARDIS', 'crew', 'next', 'story', 'Terminus', 'Turlough', 'crew.Mawdryn', 'Undead', 'possible', 'have', 'story', 'fascinating', 'having', 'sensational', 'alien', 'monsters']",Doctor Who - Mawdryn Undead VHS
349683,A2DDBYKXF1N0D5,6302993660,Jero Briggs,"[0, 0]","I have had ""Terminus"" for quite a while now. It was the only one I had in the Black Guardian trilogy. I recorded it off TV. I found that one to be quite entertaining. Even though it wasn't one of the best Dr. Who stories ever made, it was still pretty good. I had never seen the other two in the trilogy before. In ""Terminus"" Turlough was already under the influence of the Black Guardian and it ended with the Black Guardian telling Turlough that he only has one more chance to kill the Doctor or else. I just recently bought this one from Amazon, the first one in the trilogy, and I just got it today. I wish I could say I wasn't disappointed, but I was. ""Terminus"" was a far better.It started out good, and kept me entertained throughout the first two parts and throughout most of the third. For a while I thought it was going to be even better than ""Terminus"", but then I got to the end of part three which had one of the worst cliffhangers I have ever seen in the series, and part four (the final part) wasn't even worth watching. The only good thing about this story was the return of the Black Guardian and the Brigadier as well as part two's excellent cliffhanger ending. To bad part three's wasn't as good. At least now though, I have the beginning of the trilogy to go along with ""Terminus"". Now all I need is the final one, ""Enlightenment"", which I should be expecting very soon.

The Black Guardian returns with a new attempt to kill the Doctor.  As he cannot interfere directly, he sends in  young Turlough, the alien trapped in a British public school in the 20th  century.  Turlough was one of the best compnaions when he first premiered  in the series.  Unfortunately, the writers didn't keep it up and he  devolved into one of the most boring by the endof his run.  In Mawdryn  Undead, the Doctor is forced to give up his remaining regenerations in  order to save a group of scientists who are trapped in an eternal, painful  regeneration cycle.  His only saving grace is the appearance of two  Brigadier Lethbridge Stuarts from two different time lines.  It's great  seeing Nicholas Courtney in the role once again.

How fascinating how he was going to die if he helped the ""renegade"" timeloards for wanting to live forever -- don't we all want to do that.*The black guardian -- haven't seen him since the Armageddon Factor -- cool 3d effect when the car crashes at the start and we seem him appear with a very cunning and evil looking face!* Didn't notice this before: BUT PETER DAVISON HAS SIDE-BURNS! Goodness me! Didn't know that Tom Baker had them before either -- because of his numerous curls covering his face. For some reason I notice them more in this story of Peter's, which he evidently shaves off. Particularly noticeable in Warriors of the Deep, which is chronologically a few stories down from this one.*Also this is about 1977/1983 Brigadier -- With and without the moustache!I won't give away the story, but I love all the scenery in it from where the tardis appears amongst the green trees, the car chase at the start where Turlough takes off with one of his school friends, the time capsule, the interaction with all the characters.
