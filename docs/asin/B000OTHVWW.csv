Pihl ""Readerman""","[0, 3]","This ""Trilogy"" is actually a rather loosely-connected series of films that happen to have the same leading character (Mas Oyama).I really believe they are not particularly well done.  I didn't get any sense of an attempt to explore the character of Oyama Sensei.  The Karate sequences were nothing special and I was not made aware of what, if anything but raw strength, distinguished his style from that of any of the other characters represented in the film.  If someone were a true Sonny Chiba fan then the films should be in their collection.  Otherwise, see if you can rent them or borrow them from a fellow fan.",3,Sonny as Yakuza,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,616,"['Trilogy', 'actually', 'rather', 'loosely-connected', 'series', 'films', 'happen', 'have', 'same', 'leading', 'character', 'Mas', 'Oyama', '.I', 'really', 'believe', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'attempt', 'explore', 'character', 'Oyama', 'Sensei', 'Karate', 'sequences', 'were', 'nothing', 'special', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'aware', 'what', 'anything', 'raw', 'strength', 'distinguished', 'style', 'other', 'characters', 'represented', 'film', 'someone', 'were', 'true', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'fan', 'then', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'Otherwise', 'see', 'can', 'rent', 'borrow', 'fellow', 'fan']",Sonny Chiba - Masutatsu Oyama Trilogy

Chiba doesn't really change his attitude that much from his other movies that I've seen, except for now, he's Oyama on a journey of self-discovery and of course name taking.  I would doubt if anyone could openly kill this many people in modern times and not once be tracked by the police, but I loved the series none the less.",4,Classic Chiba,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,366,"['classic', 'chiba', 'name', 'taken', 'Chiba', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'attitude', 'much', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'now', 'Oyama', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'course', 'name', 'taking', 'would', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'could', 'openly', 'kill', 'many', 'people', 'modern', 'times', 'not', 'once', 'be', 'tracked', 'police', 'loved', 'series', 'none', 'less']",Sonny Chiba - Masutatsu Oyama Trilogy

All are in widescreen and subtitled with an option for simulated 5.1 sound.  For those who haven't seen these movies before it's sort of a Karate action drama based on Chiba's mentor.  They're the original uncut versions so there shouldn't be anything missing.  Extras are limited to trailers.  I'm no expert on widescreen, color saturation or sound so purists may have another opinion.  I personally love this set.",5,Great thinpack box set,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,523,"['great', 'set', 'Chiba', 'fans', 'can', 'tell', 'put', 'love', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'widescreen', 'subtitled', 'option', 'simulated', '5.1', 'sound', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movies', 'sort', 'Karate', 'action', 'drama', 'based', 'Chiba', 'mentor', ""'re"", 'original', 'uncut', 'versions', 'there', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'missing', 'Extras', 'are', 'limited', 'trailers', ""'m"", 'expert', 'widescreen', 'color', 'saturation', 'sound', 'so', 'purists', 'may', 'have', 'opinion', 'personally', 'love', 'set']",Sonny Chiba - Masutatsu Oyama Trilogy
