242925,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,6301015290,Allen Bowers,"[1, 2]","This is one funny movie!  It's basically a classic moment in comedy time.  It deals so cleverly with a momma's boy(comedically played by Danny Devito)who wants to become a writer. But he's got a big problem that being that his mother(played by the late Anne Ramsey)doesn't support him at all in his dream not to mention she's physically and verbally abusive to him and as if that wasn't bad enough he doesn't have any friends either!  So he comes to his teacher( played by Billy Crystal for inspiration, To blackmail him into killing his mother and above all else friendship.  Well pretty much what happens during those events is quite hysterical!  I particulary love when Danny Devito whacks Billy Crystal upside the head(in a pre-Dinosaurs manner)with a frying pan.  So if you like dark humor,slapstick, or just a comedy that's full of surprises then you will definely want to ride this train!",5,Great classic comedy as only Crystal and Devito could deliver!,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,895,"['one', 'funny', 'movie', 'basically', 'classic', 'moment', 'comedy', 'time', 'so', 'cleverly', 'momma', 'boy', 'comedically', 'played', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'who', 'become', 'writer', 'got', 'big', 'problem', 'being', 'mother', 'played', 'late', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', ""n't"", 'support', 'dream', 'not', 'mention', 'physically', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'So', 'teacher', 'played', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'inspiration', 'blackmail', 'killing', 'mother', 'else', 'friendship', 'Well', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'events', 'quite', 'hysterical', 'particulary', 'love', 'when', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'head', 'pre-Dinosaurs', 'manner', 'frying', 'pan', 'So', 'like', 'dark', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'just', 'comedy', 'full', 'surprises', 'then', 'will', 'definely', 'want', 'ride', 'train']",N/A
242926,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301015290,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I didn't expect to really like this movie all that much.  At times I find DeVito to be rather over-the-top, and not in a good way.  I also am not a biggest fan of Billy Crystal either.  I actually find him rather dull a lot of the times (aside from his stellar work in `When Harry Met Sally').  Really, I'm not sure why I truly wanted to see this movie.  Knowing that it was inspired by the Hitchcock film `Strangers on a Train' was incentive I guess, but since my personal opinion of that movie has lowered since seeing it I guess really the only reason I sat down to watch this comedy was that it has been lauded as truly worth the time.Yes, `Throw Momma from the Train' is supposed to be really funny.So, it's safe to say I wasn't expecting much.  I think at times that is the best way to walk into a film; without high expectations.  That way, when the film bombs at your feet you're not left disappointed.  It also works the other way, because when the film excels you are truly surprised and very appreciative.I think you can tell by the five-star review that this movie excelled, at least for me.Larry is a Writing Teacher who is tormented by his ex-wife who has stolen his novel and published it as her own.  She is ruining his life, his career, his name and he cannot take it anymore, despite pleas from his current girlfriend to just let it go.  One of his students, the not so bright Owen, has a similar problem; his mother.  She is overbearing, condescending and just plain gross.  She is ruining his life and he cannot take it anymore.  That's when Owen proposes a solution, an absurd solution, that Larry wants nothing to do with.But Owen takes it upon himself to set his plan in motion.Believe it or not, DeVito and Crystal make a dynamic team, hilarious from beginning to end.  They feed off one another wonderfully, playing to each others strengths in order to create a great comedic duo.  DeVito is a surprisingly adept director.  Between this achievement and his stellar work on `The War of the Roses' I must say that I am impressed with his comedic technique.  He knows how to develop a strong emotion core to secrete his comedic focus and engage the audience in more than just a string of gags.  Both films are strong examples of how to make an engaging and intelligent dramedy.Stealing the show here is Anne Ramsey, who just delivers one of the funniest performances in recent memory.  She is hard to look at, hard to listen to; she's even hard to stomach but the fact remains that she's impossible to forget.In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is a surprisingly effective reimagining of the prose originally written by Patricia Highsmith and serves as a very entertaining comedy that will bring loads of laughs and smiles.",5,Black comedy at its finest...,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,2754,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'that', 'much', 'times', 'find', 'DeVito', 'be', 'rather', 'over-the-top', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'also', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'either', 'actually', 'find', 'rather', 'lot', 'times', 'aside', 'stellar', 'work', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Really', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'truly', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'Knowing', 'was', 'inspired', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'was', 'incentive', 'guess', 'personal', 'opinion', 'movie', 'lowered', 'seeing', 'guess', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'comedy', 'was', 'been', 'lauded', 'truly', 'time.Yes', 'Throw', 'Momma', 'Train', 'supposed', 'be', 'really', 'funny.So', 'safe', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'think', 'times', 'best', 'way', 'walk', 'film', 'high', 'expectations', 'way', 'when', 'film', 'bombs', 'feet', ""'re"", 'not', 'left', 'disappointed', 'also', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'film', 'excels', 'are', 'truly', 'surprised', 'very', 'appreciative.I', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'five-star', 'review', 'movie', 'excelled', 'least', 'me.Larry', 'Writing', 'Teacher', 'who', 'tormented', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'stolen', 'novel', 'published', 'own', 'ruining', 'life', 'career', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'anymore', 'pleas', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'One', 'students', 'not', 'so', 'bright', 'Owen', 'similar', 'problem', 'mother', 'overbearing', 'condescending', 'just', 'plain', 'gross', 'ruining', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'anymore', 'when', 'Owen', 'solution', 'absurd', 'solution', 'Larry', 'nothing', 'do', 'with.But', 'Owen', 'set', 'plan', 'motion.Believe', 'not', 'DeVito', 'Crystal', 'make', 'dynamic', 'team', 'hilarious', 'beginning', 'end', 'feed', 'off', 'one', 'wonderfully', 'playing', 'others', 'strengths', 'order', 'create', 'great', 'comedic', 'duo', 'DeVito', 'surprisingly', 'adept', 'director', 'Between', 'achievement', 'stellar', 'work', 'War', 'Roses', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'impressed', 'comedic', 'technique', 'how', 'develop', 'strong', 'emotion', 'core', 'secrete', 'comedic', 'focus', 'engage', 'audience', 'more', 'just', 'string', 'gags', 'films', 'are', 'strong', 'examples', 'how', 'make', 'engaging', 'intelligent', 'dramedy.Stealing', 'show', 'here', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'just', 'one', 'funniest', 'performances', 'recent', 'memory', 'hard', 'look', 'hard', 'listen', 'even', 'hard', 'stomach', 'fact', 'impossible', 'forget.In', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'reimagining', 'prose', 'originally', 'written', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'very', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'will', 'bring', 'loads', 'laughs', 'smiles']",N/A
242927,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6301015290,andy8047,"[0, 2]","Danny DeVito directed and starred in this film about Owen Lift's elderly and senile momma. Owen(DeVito) takes a literature class given by Larry Donner(Billy Crystal). Momma(the late Anne Ramsey) is frequently annoyed by the striking of Owen's typewriter(the kind used was a manual with typebar assembly). He wants to kill her in the worst way. She survives the poison given to her(Pepsi with lye). The lye softened her up mentally! But that doesn't last long. She resumes being her bitchy self. Kate Mulgrew is Larry's ex-wife who's a novelist like her ex-husband. Larry hears on the radio that she was missing and presumed dead. Margaret,the ex-wife promotes her new novel on Oprah Winfrey,who appears as herself. Kim Greist is Larry's girlfriend Beth Ryan. Jazz musician Branford Marsalis is Larry's buddy Lester. Marsalis,a saxophonist,even plays in the film. After seeing a murder movie,Owen suggests that Larry kill Momma,and Owen kill Margaret. Rob Reiner,Crystal's longtime buddy is Joel,Larry's agent. Joel quit representing Larry. Memorable scenes include when Larry introduces Owen to Beth,Larry tells her,""Owen is a dead man!"". Owen suddenly appeared in a moment of passion between Larry and Beth. Momma calls the police to report Larry murdered his ex-wife. That's when Larry,Owen and Momma are on a train to God knows where. Larry is physically evicted by Momma from the moving train,resulting in hospitalization. Following his discharge,Larry finally musters up the courage to proceed with his novel which he initially began months ago. A year passed,and Owen phones Larry at a booth near Larry's apartment(""Look out your window!""). The two wave to each other and Larry invites Owen in. Momma had died of natural causes. Owen wrote a book entitled ""Owen,Momma and Owen's friend Larry"". Owen is about to fly to New York to promote the book. There is nothing violent in the book,according to Owen. It tells about what the three did together in the film,them taking a picnic and Owen,Larry and Beth on vacation. Margaret becomes engaged to an Oriental man who revived her when she was drowning.

That's not to say that we consider these films to be among the best ever made, but that they're just one of our favorite movies. THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is one of those for me, and I can't quite pinpoint why.The story focuses on two men: there's Larry (Billy Crystal, at his neurotic best), a novelist who is having severe writer's block (he's been on ""The night was..."" on the 1st page since July) after his ex-wife Margaret (Kate Mulgrew) stole his masterpiece and made a fortune off of it; and Owen (director Danny DeVito), a 40-year-old man trapped in a child's body (not a short joke, by the way) who lives with his monstrous mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar for her outlandish performance) and daydreams about doing her in. Owen takes a writing class, taught by Larry, at the local community college, and soon the two strike up a friendship of sorts (that is to say, Owen asks Larry for writing advice by constantly following him everywhere). Larry tells Owen that the story he wrote for class, ""Murder at My Friend Harry's,"" fails because it has 2 characters, one killing the other, with neither having a motive nor an alibi (which are key to a murder). He tells Owen to look to Hitchcock, and Owen does just that, watching STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (which this of course takes plot points from) and concocting a scheme that he thinks Larry was hinting towards: Owen will kill Margaret, and in turn, Larry will kill Owen's mother; that way, both men have killed a total stranger (no motive) and will each have been elsewhere when the murder of the person they hate happens (alibi). Owen, being not too bright, does his part before telling Larry, and now Larry has no alibi and must stay low with Owen, being told he must kill Owen's mother (and then Owen will turn himself in, I think) or else go to jail for a long, long time.If you think I gave it all away, don't worry. Most of that is in the synopsis, and besides, you probably already know how it will all end up (this is a comedy; a dark one, sure, but nowhere near as dark as DeVito's later efforts). There's also a tepid romance with Larry and fellow teacher Beth (Kim Greist), but the film sparkles when DeVito and Crystal are together.

I still hear the old lady's voice in my head whenever I hear the name Owen.  This movie is hysterical, both in situational and physical comedy.

The comedy genre doesn&#8217;t do it justice. Or perhaps it&#8217;s just the fact that Danny DeVito, who not only stars as a writing student named Owen but also plays the role of director, isn&#8217;t that funny. Nor is comedian Billy Crystal, Owen&#8217;s college professor, a novelist who hates his ex-wife for taking credit for one of his books and getting famous enough to go on Oprah for it.Owen hates his mother and with good reason. She&#8217;s an old decrepit bitch and, even though he takes care of her on a daily basis; he cooks meals for her, gives her baths and even gets wax-balls out of her ears; she treats him like dirt. So, instead of having her taken away to a nursing home or simply moving out of the house, he invertedly comes-up with the idea to have her killed in exchange for killing Owen&#8217;s ex-wife, an idea that actually comes from a Alfred Hitchcock movie.It&#8217;s the wacky ways in which the two guys go about their plan that&#8217;s disappointing. There are some laughs, mostly centering around &#8220;Momma&#8221; and her blatant grumpiness, but those laughs are far and few between. Most of the comedy is slapstick hack. The dark underlying and the little bit of suspense it provides is what keeps it interesting.

At the time I didn't really know what &#34;black comedy&#34; was-my 9 year old mind couldn't comprehend how one could make a comedy out of murdering someone. But I immediately identified with Billy Crystal as the frustrated writer, Larry. Even at 9 I knew that I was going to write for a living one day, and his struggles to get something, ANYTHING, down on paper were quite palpable to me. Combined with his ex-wife's phenomenal success in the same field, and his having to take a survival job of teaching creative writing at a local community college, you already have the makings of an Everyman a la Hitchcock (the only Hitchcock film I had seen at this point was &#34;Psycho&#34; so I didn't get the &#34;Strangers On A Train&#34; connection). It is in this writing course that he meets Owen, played to meek perfection by Danny DeVito. Owen is oppressed by his domineering, ogre of a mother, Anne Ramsey. Owen entices Larry to a screening of Hitchcock's underrated masterpiece &#34;Strangers On A Train.&#34; After the film both men discuss the miserable state of their lives and come to the conclusion that the source of their problems are two women:Larry's ex, Owen's mother. Owen suggests that Larry murder his mom, in exchange for him murdering Larry's ex, &#34;Criss cross.&#34; Larry dismisses the idea, but when his ex turns up missing, he is convinced that Owen has committed the crime and he is now obligated to kill Owen's mother. This is accomplished in a series of Rube Goldberg-inspired events, each one hilariously topping the last, none of which actually kill Mother. Again I hadn't been exposed to this type of humor before so I found it highly comical and clever. Later when I grew into adulthood I viewed this film again and found it even MORE witty-this is an adult comedy after all. Danny DeVito as the director is able to find all kinds of comedic nuances, from Mr. Crystal sitting at his typewriter trying to find the perfect adjective to describe the night, to the ending where they literally try to throw  momma from the train. Even the cartoon-like ways that they try to kill mother come off as witty rather than silly. He is also able to suppress his usually manic obnoxiousness and let Mr. Crystal's neurosis lead the story.

He does not hide his hatred for Margaret, upsetting his girlfriend Beth Ryan, who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college. While teaching Creative Writing classes, he is stalked by a student, Owen, who wants to know his opinion about his crime tale. Larry tells him that he did not like it, and explains that in every mystery tale, the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would get caught. Furthermore, Larry suggests that Owen watch Hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story. Owen, who wants to kill his detestable mother, watches ""Strangers on a Train"" and misunderstands Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and while in a ship, Margaret falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while the deranged Owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal.

He is divorced from a woman (Kate Mulgrew) who has taken his novel and ""written"" it herself and is now receiving all the glory. Larry is stewing. One of Larry's students, Owen (Danny DeVito), becomes obsessed with a murder mystery he is working on and he follows Larry around hoping for a moment of his attention. Owen has issues....his Momma (Anne Ramsey). The fun begins with a mistaken clue being taken by Owen to mean that he and Larry should criss-cross their anger and murder one another's nemesis and it all leads to a completely amusing journey into the dark part of a suffering mind.Danny DeVito is the king of black comedy and here he stars and directs with a talented ability to find humor in the darkest desires. Along with Billy Crystal they complete a madcap comedy duo in search of some relief from those who taunt their insecurities. The stand out talent in this film is of course Anne Ramsey, who as Momma, will make you roar with laughter....you stupid poop!
