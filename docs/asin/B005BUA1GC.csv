1452853,A3LCIWZS2VXJHU,B005BUA1GC,Crazy-for-TV,"[7, 8]","Even though ""Season One, Part Two"" doesn't come out until October 4th, I feel compelled to say that the final eighteen episodes of season one are superb, after watching the final two episodes tonight. Shout! Factory, who is releasing ""Melissa & Joey,"" has announced that there will be no special features this time around; however, that shouldn't discourage anyone from buying this set. I have been a fan of Melissa Joan Hart since her days on ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and she remains my favorite actress to this day. Regardless of my bias, the series excels mainly due to terrific writing and wonderful acting. The cast meshes so well that the story of this dysfunctional family seems as though it could happen in real life. I can't wait for Season Two to begin airing. But, whenever ABC Family decides to air the show again, I'll be the first one watching. Melissa, you and Joey have struck comedy gold, again.UPDATE (7/3/12): I am very disappointed that the producers of this DVD set have incorrectly labeled the first three episodes! I have contacted the studio, and they inform me that there are currently no plans to re-release the set or even offer a replacement disc! This is surely not enough for me to lower my rating, because the series is truly 5 stars. However, I wish more time and effort had gone into issuing a release of this excellent series!",5,Melissa Joan Hart & Joey Lawrence have struck comedy gold...
