1088197,A3FPSY1M6G7XIB,B000T28PG0,RonAnnArbor,"[16, 21]","These episodes are addictive, and I was thrilled to see them released on DVD, as my DVR was too full to keep them and I enjpy repeat viewings....and so do my students.Note that this is NOT PBS-babble -- it's a fun exploration of the underground of major (and some minor) cities. It's written and performed for the everyman, not for the scholar (many of whom have already seen these things themselves). The hosts are alternately fun, annoying, and intrusive. Like a personal buddy might be if he was guiding you underground. This is obviously directed that way, since Don Wildman is a trained professional actor and Eric Geller is normally softspoken and introspective -- here both are ""in awe"" a lot.The camera work here is absolutely stunning -- as they explore underground, you forget that there is a camera crew attached to the project, lighting the walls, lighting everything you see. It is truly amazing camera work.So Paris includes the highly-tourist travelled Catacombs...and NYC includes the Waldorf-Astoria presidential track (are there New Yorkers that still don't look out the windows of the subway or Metro North and see those things for themselves?) but it also includes the mysterious M42 subbasement, and a cool look at the Empire State Building basement. Best Episode: Dracula's Underground and the Pilot Episode: Istanbul (amazing). Worst Episode: Portland.These are completely entertaining, and include cities and town that you might normally not know about and see. They are also left wide-open for repeat visits to larger cities (there have already been two Rome episodes for example) and they could do countless Paris underground episodes.If you have already seen the series, you will be as hooked as most of us who can't wait for each new episode. If you are new to the series, download an episode from Amazon or iTunes and you will most likely be as hooked as the rest of us, then you can purchase the entire set.This is genuinely one of the few tv dvd box sets that I bought the day it came out. Of course, containing only 10 1/2 hours of programming it had all been watched two days later.",5,Well done and fascinating stuff for the everyman,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,2115,"['episodes', 'are', 'addictive', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'DVR', 'was', 'too', 'full', 'keep', 'enjpy', 'repeat', 'viewings', '.and', 'so', 'do', 'students.Note', 'NOT', 'PBS-babble', 'fun', 'exploration', 'underground', 'major', 'minor', 'cities', 'written', 'performed', 'everyman', 'not', 'scholar', 'many', 'whom', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'things', 'hosts', 'are', 'alternately', 'fun', 'annoying', 'intrusive', 'personal', 'buddy', 'might', 'be', 'was', 'guiding', 'underground', 'obviously', 'directed', 'way', 'Don', 'Wildman', 'trained', 'professional', 'actor', 'Eric', 'Geller', 'normally', 'softspoken', 'introspective', 'here', 'are', 'awe', 'lot.The', 'camera', 'work', 'here', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'explore', 'underground', 'forget', 'camera', 'crew', 'attached', 'project', 'lighting', 'walls', 'lighting', 'everything', 'see', 'truly', 'amazing', 'camera', 'work.So', 'Paris', 'highly-tourist', 'travelled', 'Catacombs', 'NYC', 'Waldorf-Astoria', 'presidential', 'track', 'are', 'there', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'out', 'windows', 'subway', 'Metro', 'North', 'see', 'things', 'also', 'mysterious', 'M42', 'subbasement', 'cool', 'look', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'basement', 'Best', 'Episode', 'Dracula', 'Underground', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'Istanbul', 'amazing', 'Worst', 'Episode', 'Portland.These', 'are', 'completely', 'entertaining', 'include', 'cities', 'town', 'might', 'normally', 'not', 'know', 'see', 'are', 'also', 'left', 'wide-open', 'repeat', 'visits', 'larger', 'cities', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'two', 'Rome', 'episodes', 'example', 'could', 'do', 'countless', 'Paris', 'underground', 'episodes.If', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'hooked', 'most', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'new', 'episode', 'are', 'new', 'series', 'episode', 'Amazon', 'iTunes', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'as', 'hooked', 'rest', 'then', 'can', 'purchase', 'entire', 'set.This', 'genuinely', 'one', 'few', 'tv', 'dvd', 'box', 'bought', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'course', 'containing', 'only', '10', '1/2', 'hours', 'programming', 'had', 'been', 'watched', 'two', 'days', 'later']",Cities of the Underworld: Season 1

What does that say about the producers of this series?What little credibility this series had was then flushed down the toilet by the action-movie music that accompanies the host's break-neck race through various caverns and tunnels.
