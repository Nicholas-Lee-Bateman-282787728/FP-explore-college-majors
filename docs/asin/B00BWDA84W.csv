1640431,AIMR915K4YCN,B00BWDA84W,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[2, 2]","A woman returns to her hometown after fifteen years, in order to visit her mother's grave. After meeting some of the locals, she goes about her business, only to find herself in the middle of a vampire uprising. It appears that the woman's mum is back from the dead, and chomping necks! Her name is Wynona, and she's out for bloody vengeance against those she deems to be her enemies. BLOOD REUNION is an ultra low-budget film w/ enough story and interesting characters to make up for any lack of funds. I started watching it, thinking I'd turn it off within a few minutes. However, I kept watching, and I'm glad I did. BR reminds me of those wonderful old, zero budget creepers from the 60s and 70s. The cast is tiny, most of the action takes place in real living-rooms, and the special effects are basic. Still, this had a charm that's lacking in many expensive movies. I quite enjoyed it...",4,Wynona Rises...,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,893,"['woman', 'hometown', 'fifteen', 'years', 'order', 'visit', 'mother', 'grave', 'meeting', 'locals', 'business', 'only', 'find', 'middle', 'vampire', 'uprising', 'woman', 'mum', 'back', 'dead', 'chomping', 'necks', 'name', 'Wynona', 'out', 'bloody', 'vengeance', 'be', 'enemies', 'BLOOD', 'REUNION', 'ultra', 'low-budget', 'film', 'w/', 'enough', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'funds', 'started', 'watching', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'turn', 'off', 'few', 'minutes', 'However', 'kept', 'watching', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'BR', 'wonderful', 'old', 'zero', 'budget', 'creepers', '60s', '70s', 'cast', 'tiny', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'real', 'living-rooms', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'basic', 'Still', 'had', 'charm', 'lacking', 'many', 'expensive', 'movies', 'quite', 'enjoyed']",Blood Reunion

1640433,ASORYCSR26HEH,B00BWDA84W,J. Haynes,"[0, 0]","This is not a unique plot line and there are not a lot of surprises here, unless of course you were expecting a Hitchcock mind bender with a hook.  Oh yes we do have one surprise, until now I never knew that placing a steel grate over a vampires grave would hold imprisoned forever, Bella Lugosi never mentioned that.  We have a vampire who escapes her entombment through the benevolent deeds of an innocent who is found dead of course, followed by a vengeful rampage in the streets and back yards of this small town USA.  The townspeople of course are all evolved on one side or the other of the sinister plot which imprisoned the lady in the first place.  The story line is so shallow and well worn that their is not a lot of character development needed so the director just started producing dead people who of course were not really dead yet, but who soon would be except for one... He of course with remain elusive awaiting his proper time in the inevitable sequel  The DVD had two points in its favor; 1) It was in English so no sub-titles and 2) they did not find it necessary of scatter fresh raw body parts all over my computer screen.  All and all it was not a really good flick, but neither was it offensive, I will however pass on the sequel.",3,Blood Reunion,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,1255,"['not', 'unique', 'plot', 'line', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'surprises', 'here', 'course', 'were', 'expecting', 'Hitchcock', 'mind', 'bender', 'hook', 'Oh', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'surprise', 'now', 'never', 'knew', 'placing', 'steel', 'grate', 'vampires', 'grave', 'would', 'hold', 'imprisoned', 'forever', 'Bella', 'Lugosi', 'never', 'mentioned', 'have', 'vampire', 'who', 'entombment', 'benevolent', 'deeds', 'innocent', 'who', 'found', 'dead', 'course', 'followed', 'vengeful', 'rampage', 'streets', 'back', 'yards', 'small', 'town', 'USA', 'townspeople', 'course', 'are', 'evolved', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'sinister', 'plot', 'imprisoned', 'lady', 'first', 'place', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'shallow', 'well', 'worn', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'needed', 'so', 'director', 'just', 'started', 'producing', 'dead', 'people', 'who', 'course', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'dead', 'yet', 'who', 'soon', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'course', 'remain', 'elusive', 'awaiting', 'proper', 'time', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'DVD', 'had', 'two', 'points', 'favor', '1', 'was', 'English', 'sub-titles', '2', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'necessary', 'scatter', 'fresh', 'raw', 'body', 'parts', 'computer', 'screen', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'flick', 'was', 'offensive', 'will', 'however', 'pass', 'sequel']",Blood Reunion
