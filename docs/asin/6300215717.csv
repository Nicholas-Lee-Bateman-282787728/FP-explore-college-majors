Back in the days of black-and-white Hollywood movies, they were masters of romantic comedy. Here's one.Gregory Peck was simply fantastic. I'd never seen him before. (Gasp!) It also introduced Audrey Hepburn. I know almost nothing about her career (gasp!), but I'd say she had more ability as a newcomer than a lot of veterans ever achieve.A simple premise executed almost flawlessly. Princess runs away from the spotlight and finds love with a commoner while hiding her identity. It begins with subtle humor, progresses to highly visual humor, then turns serious because there is a dilemma at its heart. Two hours may have been a wee bit too long, but I enjoyed it.In its day, I'm sure filming everything on location in Rome was a big selling point.

218069,A2FQPAN4M6VDUH,6300215717,Amazon Customer,"[15, 15]","I felt compelled to write a review of this film for several reason. First and foremost because this is one of my all-time favorite films. I never tire of watching this film over and over and sharing with others that have not yet had the pleasure of watching it. I also wanted to write this review because so many younger movie fans immediately dismiss older films and especially black and white films. And lastly, I wanted to put my two cents in after reading the ""professional critic's"" review... mis-cast??? HOW could there ever be a more perfectly, better cast film???Gregory Peck, who I had come to revere as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (he is the reason I wanted to become a lawyer when I was child), and Audrey Hepburn has the perfect mix of innocence and fearlessness for her role as the rebellious Princess. Even Eddie Albert as the comedic side-kick was ideal.This film follows a Princess who, at first glance, lives an enviable life of wealth and fame and glamour. I have always had a hard time finding any compassion for the complaints of similar people be it in real life or on film, but somehow Audrey Hepburn pulls it off and it is not difficult to cheer for her as she experiences such basic things as deciding how her hair should be cut and eating an ice cream. While Gregory Peck is undeniably smooth as the rogue American journalist, he also is able to pull off the needed sleaziness to make his role beleivable. You have to be able to understand his initial motivation does NOT come from a ""good place"", but merely out of greed and selfishness.... but then you have to also beleive his change of heart and its subtleness. And it works. He doesn't suddenly wake up and have a change of heart. You can see his transformation, or relevation as it may be, over the course of the film.As a closet romantic I have to say I always secretly hope there will be a better ending (and by ""better"" I do not mean in terms of movie quality. I mean in terms of a classic ""happy ending""). The final scene is heart wrenching, yet the only plausible possible way it could end. I am always left wondering what the heck happened later, despite knowing full well the answer... and it isn't necessarily what we'd all like to imagine. But I respect the fact that the movie doesn't spell it out and doesn't wrap it all up in a lovely bow. Still a tear-jerker ending, but exactly as it should be.Please see this movie. You will want to own it afterwards I promise. And don't be fooled, it is not just some old, out-dated ""chick flick."" It's just good. Oh yeah, and that *sigh factor*... HUGE!

218072,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300215717,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 20]","`Roman Holiday' is certainly entertaining and enjoyable and, thanks to Audrey Hepburn, very charming, but to say that it is a good film is not something I would be quick to do.  The fact remains that, while it is a likable film, `Roman Holiday' is a rather vacant effort.  Sure, the backdrop is pretty, and Audrey is pretty, and the whole premise has that familiar tinge of delightfulness (I mean, who doesn't get wrapped up in this kind of a fairytale), but in the end `Roman Holiday' lacks any real meat to satisfy this film fanatic.The story is simple and familiar.  A young princess, tired of her boring and detached existence, runs away from her duty's to embark on a day of unrestrained frolicking.  She meets a reporter named Joe who sees the princess as his big ticket and so he accompanies her in order to write the ultimate insider story.Yes, they fall in love.I told my father shortly after seeing this movie that, had I seen it in 1953, I probably would have a different opinion of it now.  I'm sure that at the time this type of story was fresh and exciting (thus all the baffling Oscar nominations, and wins), but this story has been so overdone today that watching this movie felt rather boring to me.  Add to that the fact that there is nothing really profound here and you have a seemingly halfhearted attempt at cinema.  A big issue I have with this movie is that we never really get to know Princess Ann.  She remains an enigma to us, even though the whole purpose of Joe's following her around is supposedly to write this detailed piece on the `real Ann'.  She never lets us (or Joe for that matter) in enough to give us any idea of who she is as a person.This film is not concerned with giving us a deeply moving character portrait.  It is more concerned with becoming another empty romantic comedy.That is another issue I have.  The film is not really that romantic.  Because we never get to know her, we never really understand why these two fall in love so quickly.  Yes, I know that there are far too many films where `boy meets girl and loves her instantly', but most of them (at least the good ones) give us some sort of common ground between the characters to justify the mutual attraction (even if it is just a shared respect for an obscure band).  Here, there are no meaningful conversations or shared interests to back up the spontaneous attraction.  And Gregory Peck is sorely miscast here, even if it is his performance that carries the second half (the most important half) of the film.  His final scene (walking away from the press interview) is the most powerful scene, and he sells it gloriously, but he is far too serious and brooding for a film this light and jovial.  If this film had taken a deeper tone then his performance would have been just right.Truth be told, he is the best part of the film, but sadly the film makes him appear almost awkward and out of place.I'll never understand Hepburn's Oscar win.  The performance is hollow.  Sure, she is her usual charming self (I love her in everything), but there is no meat to this performance, at all.  I blame the script, because Hepburn certainly had the demeanor and presence to sell this part, but the part was just so amateur.Alas, this is a beloved film and I'm sure many will hate me to discrediting it like I have, but I must speak my truth.  I liked it, and I'd probably watch it again, but I cannot praise this film, for it is far from praiseworthy.",3,Delightfully empty...,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,3453,"['Roman', 'Holiday', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'thanks', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'very', 'charming', 'say', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'do', 'fact', 'likable', 'film', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'rather', 'vacant', 'effort', 'Sure', 'backdrop', 'pretty', 'Audrey', 'pretty', 'whole', 'premise', 'familiar', 'tinge', 'delightfulness', 'mean', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'kind', 'fairytale', 'end', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'lacks', 'real', 'meat', 'satisfy', 'film', 'fanatic.The', 'story', 'simple', 'familiar', 'young', 'princess', 'tired', 'boring', 'detached', 'existence', 'away', 'duty', 'embark', 'day', 'unrestrained', 'frolicking', 'reporter', 'named', 'Joe', 'who', 'princess', 'big', 'ticket', 'so', 'order', 'write', 'ultimate', 'insider', 'story.Yes', 'fall', 'love.I', 'told', 'father', 'shortly', 'seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', '1953', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'time', 'type', 'story', 'was', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'thus', 'baffling', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'wins', 'story', 'been', 'so', 'overdone', 'today', 'watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'rather', 'boring', 'Add', 'fact', 'nothing', 'really', 'profound', 'here', 'have', 'seemingly', 'halfhearted', 'attempt', 'cinema', 'big', 'issue', 'have', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'enigma', 'even', 'whole', 'purpose', 'Joe', 'following', 'around', 'supposedly', 'write', 'detailed', 'piece', 'real', 'Ann', 'never', 'Joe', 'matter', 'enough', 'give', 'idea', 'who', 'person.This', 'film', 'not', 'concerned', 'giving', 'deeply', 'moving', 'character', 'portrait', 'more', 'concerned', 'becoming', 'empty', 'romantic', 'comedy.That', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'romantic', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'so', 'quickly', 'Yes', 'know', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'where', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'instantly', 'most', 'least', 'good', 'ones', 'give', 'sort', 'common', 'ground', 'characters', 'justify', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'even', 'just', 'shared', 'respect', 'obscure', 'band', 'Here', 'are', 'meaningful', 'conversations', 'shared', 'interests', 'back', 'up', 'spontaneous', 'attraction', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'sorely', 'miscast', 'here', 'even', 'performance', 'second', 'half', 'most', 'important', 'half', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'walking', 'away', 'press', 'interview', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'gloriously', 'far', 'too', 'serious', 'brooding', 'film', 'light', 'jovial', 'film', 'had', 'taken', 'deeper', 'tone', 'then', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'right.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'sadly', 'film', 'appear', 'almost', 'awkward', 'place.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'Hepburn', 'Oscar', 'win', 'performance', 'hollow', 'Sure', 'usual', 'charming', 'self', 'love', 'everything', 'meat', 'performance', 'blame', 'script', 'Hepburn', 'certainly', 'had', 'demeanor', 'presence', 'sell', 'part', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'amateur.Alas', 'beloved', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'will', 'hate', 'discrediting', 'have', 'must', 'speak', 'truth', 'liked', ""'d"", 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'film', 'far', 'praiseworthy']",N/A

With two actors like that &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; hardly needs more selling points. Although at the time Audrey was not a well known actress. In fact some  people at the time thought casting her was a bit of a risk. Well, history  has proven them wrong.The story is simple and not at all original.  In fact if you were just to look at the script  it is likely that you would  think the film not worth making. What made this film great was superb  performances by the whole cast and a fresh piece of directing from William  Wyler. Of course shooting the film in Rome was an added feature of not  inconsiderable weight.Audrey Hepburn plays a young princess from  an undisclosed nation. She is visiting Rome as part of a European tour and  is starting to feel a little claustrophobic. She decides to escape the  confines of her local residence and her hangers on by sneaking out in a  delivery van but not before one of her keepers has given her a little  something to help her sleep. The drug does not take effect until she is  well out of bounds and this is where our hero comes into the picture.Gregory Peck plays Joe Bradley, a disreputable news paper reporter who  is largely down on his luck. He stumbles across Princess Anne as she is  nearly sleeping by the side of a road. Despite his better instincts he  eventually decides to save this bedraggled and presumably drunk, young lady  by putting her in a cab. Unfortunately she is unable to give a lucid  response when asked for an address and thus ends up in Joe's one room  abode.Naturally the disappearance of the princess is hushed up but  not enough to prevent Joe from eventually coming to the correct assumption,  that his poor lost sheep is in fact more than she seems. And so we are  launched on an opportunistic tour of Rome care of Joe and for the benefit  of his clandestine photographer, Irving. Joe's intentions are to gather as  much information and photos of the princess slumming as to make a world  front page story and propel himself back to New York.It isn't long  before the naive and yet heart warming affections of the princess start to  thaw Mr Bradley's self interest. As a result, he misses out on his story  but feels much more richly rewarded in a moral sense. A good message for  the kiddies, yes?OK, it is a bit corny, however it is still  strangely believable, even after so many years. Have you had a chance to  watch Roman Holiday in the last few years? If not, then why not do yourself  a favour and give it another run through. There are worse ways to kill a  couple of hours.",4,Rome gets the royal treatment,958953600,"05 22, 2000",2000,2626,"['Gregory', 'Peck', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'star', '1953', 'classic', 'two', 'actors', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'quot', 'hardly', 'more', 'selling', 'points', 'time', 'Audrey', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'actress', 'fact', 'people', 'time', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'bit', 'risk', 'Well', 'history', 'proven', 'wrong.The', 'story', 'simple', 'not', 'original', 'fact', 'were', 'just', 'look', 'script', 'likely', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'making', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'great', 'was', 'superb', 'performances', 'whole', 'cast', 'fresh', 'piece', 'directing', 'William', 'Wyler', 'course', 'shooting', 'film', 'Rome', 'was', 'added', 'feature', 'not', 'inconsiderable', 'weight.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'young', 'princess', 'undisclosed', 'nation', 'visiting', 'Rome', 'part', 'European', 'tour', 'starting', 'feel', 'little', 'claustrophobic', 'escape', 'confines', 'local', 'residence', 'hangers', 'sneaking', 'out', 'delivery', 'van', 'not', 'one', 'keepers', 'given', 'little', 'something', 'help', 'sleep', 'drug', 'not', 'take', 'effect', 'well', 'bounds', 'where', 'hero', 'picture.Gregory', 'Peck', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'disreputable', 'news', 'paper', 'reporter', 'who', 'largely', 'down', 'luck', 'Princess', 'Anne', 'nearly', 'sleeping', 'side', 'road', 'better', 'eventually', 'save', 'bedraggled', 'presumably', 'drunk', 'young', 'lady', 'putting', 'cab', 'Unfortunately', 'unable', 'give', 'lucid', 'response', 'when', 'asked', 'address', 'thus', 'up', 'Joe', 'one', 'room', 'abode.Naturally', 'disappearance', 'princess', 'hushed', 'up', 'not', 'enough', 'prevent', 'Joe', 'eventually', 'coming', 'correct', 'assumption', 'poor', 'lost', 'sheep', 'fact', 'more', 'are', 'launched', 'opportunistic', 'tour', 'Rome', 'care', 'Joe', 'benefit', 'clandestine', 'photographer', 'Irving', 'Joe', 'intentions', 'are', 'gather', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'photos', 'princess', 'slumming', 'make', 'world', 'front', 'page', 'story', 'propel', 'back', 'New', 'York.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'naive', 'yet', 'heart', 'warming', 'affections', 'princess', 'start', 'thaw', 'Mr', 'Bradley', 'self', 'interest', 'result', 'out', 'story', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'richly', 'rewarded', 'moral', 'sense', 'good', 'message', 'kiddies', 'yes', 'OK', 'bit', 'corny', 'however', 'still', 'strangely', 'believable', 'even', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Have', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'favour', 'give', 'run', 'are', 'worse', 'ways', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A

I LOVE it! I saw it this morning (some would say I'm s hyped up because I just saw it). But I really have an urge to see it again just for Audrey Hepburn's performance and the views of Rome. Very few movies move me to want to buy it (after the first viewing).

218077,A2EL3990HXOMZB,6300215717,Antonio Robert,"[0, 0]","There's certainly not much left unwritten about this 60-year-old (!) classic, a screen debut of inimitable Audrey Hepburn as a European princess falling for an American journalist (Gregory Peck) during her stop in Italy while touring the Continent cities.Shortly, if some people are fault-finding about ""Roman Holiday"", these may in the end be the very things that make the movie stand out.While Audrey Hepburn's svelte, iconic beauty and trend-setting style skyrocketed from here onwards (including her Best Actress Academy Award for her leading role) and remains undisputed, both director William Wyler and male star Gregory Peck are more indelibly written in the minds of filmgoers with different movies.Wyler had his way with large-canvas epics like ""Ben-Hur"" or intimate ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", Peck defined ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" with his portrayal of Southern lawyer Atticus Finch.Here, though, Wyler makes the movie never slip into cheap melodrama, while keeping it profound and thought-provoking to the very end. Peck's performance oozes a large dose of machismo, but finally he too lets the wave of emotions prevail.And not to be forgotten - the City of Rome is another major star of the movie, bringing a very refreshing change from the Hollywood of old, where you could see big stars in front of moving pictures in the studio. Probably there is not a viewer who wouldn't like to see the place after seeing this film.Understated and gentle, while at times surprisingly funny and entertaining throughout, ""Roman Holiday"" remains as fresh as ever, largely also due to the ever-popular topic - a love affair between a celebrity and a common person.",5,Wyler and Peck Against Type?

218080,AFDYHKAH8AJDT,6300215717,A. Sloan,"[5, 5]","Where do I begin with this movie?  There are so many highlights that it's hard to list them all.  Right off the heels of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth the year before, the time was ripe for the public to be lured in to a movie about royalty.  I for one gladly took the bait. This box office hit garnered Hepburn the Oscar for Best Actress on one of her earliest roles on screen.  Her depth of character, sophistication, beauty and charm won over the masses.Hepburn's character Princess Ann or ""Anya"" who is at her wits ends runs from her confining keepers and royal duties then ends up being taken care of by a down and out newspaper columnist (Joe) after the sedative that was given to her kicks in.  Being the gentleman that he is (This has to be the 50's) he lets her sleep on his couch.  That is until he realizes who she is after being chewed out for missing the interview with Princess Ann that was scheduled for that following morning.  Joe rushes back to compare the photo with the real McCoy and thinks he can redeem himself with his boss with the Princess Ann exclusive.  (the royal keepers opted to tell the press that the Princess wasn't feeling well instead of admitting she was missing)  And so it begins.The chemistry between Gregory (be still my heart) Peck and Hepburn is beyond magical.  The distrust in Hepburn's eyes when she is first beginning to know ""Joe"" is inspired. So is the joy that registers on her face when she is experiencing the many ""firsts"" that the confinements of the Royal treatment would never allow her.  Peck said that this is one of his favorite films because she was such a joy to work with. Knowing during filming that he was to get top billing moved him to very strongly recommend that Audrey get equal billing instead because her acting was that strong and charismatic.  In one of the tour sequences when they are at the "" Mouth of Truth"" the adlibbed move by Peck prompts a real and totally unscripted reaction which only adds to the charm of the building relationship between Joe and Anya.  Hepburn's hair becomes a small focal point that stirs up a huge trend in hairstyles for the ultra short cut that she gets part way into the film.The whole feel of the movie is wonderful and exciting as she sees Rome as she never would have as Princess Ann.  The non Fairy-tale ending is wonderful.

This movie is one of those attempts, and no doubt one of the most successful.Gregory Peck is a reporter for an American news syndicate. Audrey Hepburn is Princess Anne of some unnamed European country. Eddie Albert is a photographer who has frequently worked with Peck in the past.The Princess has been touring Europe, doing the ""so pleased to meet you"" and the canned speeches and the poised, gracious young princess. But she gets so tired of it she starts to scream and cry, so her doctor gives her a sedative. Before it has time to take effect (which is poetic license, since it was given in a shot, which would take effect at once), she dresses in a simple skirt and blouse and sneaks out of the embassy where she has been staying during her tour of Rome.Peck finds her asleep on a bench, but does not yet recognize her as Princess Anne. Out of kindness (presumably), and thinking her drunk, he takes her home with him in a cab. He tried to get her to say where she lived so he could send her home, but she just says ""the Coliseum,"" so what can he do? He takes her home, loans her a pair of his pajamas, and then goes out for a cup of coffee while she changes, telling her she can sleep on the couch. But when he returns, she's sound asleep in his bed. So grumbling, he goes to sleep on the couch.He wakes up at like 11:00 a.m., and he was supposed to have interviewed the Princess at 10:45. So he hurries to his office and tries to persuade his boss that he has done the interview. However, the boss has a local paper telling him that the Princess has fallen ill and canceled all her appointments. He waves it under Peck's nose, at which point he freaks out because the picture is of the girl asleep in his apartment.She has told him that she has run away from her school, and indeed she looks young enough to be a high school student. So he does not let on he knows she's really the princess. After some finagling, he manages to convince her that she deserves an entire day for her Roman Holiday, and they start at the sidewalk cafe where he knows he will meet up with photographer Eddie Albert. Played for slapstick, he eventually is able to get Albert aside and tell him what's going on. Albert has a tiny camera set into a cigarette lighter, and he snaps pictures of the princess and her newsman escort (he says he's a fertilizer salesman) all over town.One great scene is the Mouth of Truth. There is an ancient sculpture, a god-like mask, set into a wall. The mouth is open, and Peck tells the princess that there is a legend that if you put your hand in its mouth and you are a liar, the hand will be bitten off. She's obviously nervous, since after all she is a liar, having said she was a school girl. But she puts her hand in the mouth anyway, just for a second. Then she tells Peck it's his turn. He puts his hand in, and then pretends it is being bitten off, whereupon the princess jumps and screams and tries to drag him away. He pulls his arm out with his hand stuffed up his jacket sleeve, and she screams again, and he pops the hand out, showing he was just teasing her.The special features of the DVD tell us that when this scene was originally planned, Peck had the idea, and nobody told Audrey Hepburn that he was going to pretend to be bitten. So her shock was completely authentic, as was her flying at him with ""Oh, you!"" and pummeling him. I daresay she expected it to be edited out of the film, but the director loved it, and they used it.There's lots more, including some ""plain clothes investigators"" from the princesses home country who are all dressed in black suits with black fedoras, and look comically like ""The Blues Brothers."" They attempt to capture the princess and take her back to the embassy, but with the help of nearly everyone on the dance barge, she escapes by jumping into the river right after Peck, and they swim to the far shore.Of course, she eventually has to go back to her duties, and the closing scene is a press conference where she discovers that Peck and Albert are with the press. It's all quite a lot of fun, a really pretty picture, and Hepburn makes a superb princess.

What can you say about Audrey Hepburn that hasn't been said in these reviews? She's not even my type and yet I still found her very sexy and beautiful. Gregory Peck was a perfect counterpart to her although he could be awkward in a couple of comedic moments. Still his sober approach fit better than that of the the great Cary Grant who, according to information, was initially tapped for the role. Grant would have upset the balance in this film just by his persona. Eddie Albert was a real pro and provided terrific support. I always found pomp and circumstance to be depressingly dull. The everyday life of the average person is much more desired in my opinion so I could appreciate what the princess was going through.

218090,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,6300215717,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[1, 1]","An enchanting real-life fairy tale, as light as a drift of marshmallow fluff, about a runaway princess and an American newspaper reporter, and their day of playing hookey in Rome; a Rome which is so thoroughly a part of this story that it might as well be one of the supporting actors. This was Audrey Hepburn's breakout movie role, and one is also charmed to learn from the extras that she was as gracious, loyal and endearing to everyone she worked with, as was  the character she played: Princess Ann, of some unspecified European country, on a state visit/good-will tour of post World War II Europe. Isolated by the requirements of her position, bored beyond tears, and chaperoned every minute of every waking day, Princess Ann impulsively flies the luxuriously gilded coop of her country's embassy in Rome late one night. She is discovered almost asleep on a park bench by reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Being one of nature's gentlemen, he assumes she is inebriated and takes her his artistically disarranged little garret of a place; when he realizes who she is, he has plans.Part of the undeniable charm of this movie is the fact that it shows us a past that is nearly out of reach: a past where motor-traffic meant a flock of Vespa scooters, and a working newspaperman would never be seen not wearing a tie. It is a world which pre-dated the paparazzi, ruthlessly pursuing celebrities twenty-four seven. One could barely imagine a newspaper reporter and his photographer friend being so gallant today - even if the princess and the reporter did manage to fall into love.  A bittersweet ending; when the two almost-lovers part after their delirious, carefree glimpse of love in the shadows of the eternal city.Of the extras, the most interesting is ""Rome with a Princess"" - a modern day look at the various authentic locations used,  and a retrospective of Audrey Hepburn's career at Paramount studios.",5,A Modern Fairy Tale,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1915,"['enchanting', 'real-life', 'fairy', 'tale', 'as', 'light', 'drift', 'marshmallow', 'fluff', 'runaway', 'princess', 'American', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'day', 'playing', 'hookey', 'Rome', 'Rome', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'part', 'story', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'supporting', 'actors', 'was', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'breakout', 'movie', 'role', 'one', 'also', 'charmed', 'learn', 'extras', 'was', 'as', 'gracious', 'loyal', 'endearing', 'everyone', 'worked', 'was', 'character', 'played', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'unspecified', 'European', 'country', 'state', 'visit/good-will', 'tour', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Europe', 'Isolated', 'requirements', 'position', 'bored', 'tears', 'chaperoned', 'minute', 'waking', 'day', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'impulsively', 'luxuriously', 'gilded', 'coop', 'country', 'embassy', 'Rome', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'discovered', 'almost', 'asleep', 'park', 'bench', 'reporter', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Being', 'one', 'nature', 'gentlemen', 'inebriated', 'artistically', 'disarranged', 'little', 'garret', 'place', 'when', 'who', 'plans.Part', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'movie', 'fact', 'past', 'nearly', 'out', 'reach', 'past', 'where', 'motor-traffic', 'meant', 'flock', 'Vespa', 'scooters', 'working', 'newspaperman', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'wearing', 'tie', 'world', 'pre-dated', 'paparazzi', 'ruthlessly', 'pursuing', 'celebrities', 'twenty-four', 'seven', 'One', 'could', 'barely', 'imagine', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'photographer', 'friend', 'being', 'so', 'gallant', 'today', 'even', 'princess', 'reporter', 'did', 'manage', 'fall', 'love', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'when', 'two', 'almost-lovers', 'part', 'delirious', 'carefree', 'glimpse', 'love', 'shadows', 'eternal', 'city.Of', 'extras', 'most', 'interesting', 'Rome', 'Princess', 'modern', 'day', 'look', 'various', 'authentic', 'locations', 'used', 'retrospective', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'career', 'Paramount', 'studios']",N/A

Lets get the facts straight.  ""Roman Holiday"" was released on Jan 1, 1953, having been made in 1952.  Audrey Hepburn was already 23, not 22 when she made this movie. Gregory Peck was 36, not 37.  Yes, thirteen years is quite a difference but nothing compared to what we see in movies today where established leading male actors are cast alongside female leads who are 20-30 years younger.  Peck looks distinguished because of his professional attire, dressy by todays standards.  Women in that time would dress to match and often looked more mature than they really were as a result.  The point of ""Roman Holiday"" is that Hepburn has left all the ""trappings"" behind when she ducked out on being a princess for a romp around Rome with the dashing Peck.  This explains her simple and more youthful clothes during most of the film.  A leading man of less stature than Peck would have been overshadowed completely by the radiant Hepburn.

218095,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6300215717,Classic film buff,"[1, 1]","This is one of those rare instances where a star actually was born, Audrey Hepburn's Hollywood debut in 1953 as Princess Anne in ""Roman Holiday"" makes you catch your breath in wonder.  All these many years later, it's still readily apparent just how extraordinary she was, especially compared to the Hollywood female stars that were popular in the early 1950's, or for that matter the ones popular right now.  One can well understand as to why she caused such a sensation.  For me, I feel the moment she became a star is the first time she truly smiled on the screen, early in the movie when she is escaping her palace by stowing away in the back of a catering truck.  As she looks out into the Roman street traffic she spies a young couple behind her riding on a motor scooter, she smiles, really smiles radiantly for the first time, her whole face lights up as she waves to the couple, and I was a goner for her, hook, line and sinker!""Roman Holiday"" is a modern day fairy tale; Princess Anne (Hepburn) heir to the throne of a small-undisclosed European monarchy does a good will tour of Europe.  Every stop is rigidly scheduled, official functions, presentations, balls etc., Anne's speeches are written for her, her clothes are chosen, and she is very strictly chaperoned.  Even though she is a very young woman, probably twenty- one at most, her royal retinue is all middle-aged to old, very staid and proper.  She has no opportunity to be spontaneous, to be around people her own age, to sample any of life's simple pleasures, to laugh.  Inevitably, her stifling constraints cause a meltdown one evening in Rome as Anne prepares for bed.  She is given a sedative to soothe her and make her sleep, but once alone she escapes into the night.  As the drug begins to take effect, she dozes on a low wall where American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) discovers her.  Mistaking her grogginess for tipsiness and feeling sorry for her he brings her back to his apartment to sleep it off.  The next morning he recognizes her as the missing princess, and realizes he's sitting on the story of his career.  He doesn't tip Anne off that he knows her true identity, and she in turn introduces herself as ""Anya Smith"".  Joe persuades the willing Anne to play hooky for the day with him doing whatever she likes and arranges for a photographer friend of his Irving Ratovitch (Eddie Albert) to accompany them to sneak some photos to use in the scoop he plans to write on the runaway princess.  The trio enjoys a carefree, joyous day together and the princess and the reporter begin to fall in love.All of the elements blend together beautifully to create a cinema classic.  One of Hollywood's finest directors William Wyler was at the helm working with a beguiling story and script by the unjustly blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, (Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him) and John Dighton, glorious location filming in the Eternal City and finally an exceptional cast both Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert seasoned film veterans helping showcase the neophyte Audrey Hepburn.  I've only seen Gregory Peck in two film comedies, ""Designing Woman"" and this, while he doesn't have the comedic skill of a Cary Grant or a Jack Lemmon, he acquits himself well in both.  Here's he's the knight errant who comes to rescue the sleeping princess from the prison of her routine which he does with an easy charm and panache that first is a trifle slick and self serving, but which soon melts into a truly protective tenderness and love for Anne.  As Joe's sidekick Irving, Eddie Albert changed his whole persona growing out his trademark crew cut and sporting a full luxuriant beard.  He's an endearing rascal who develops a conscience near the film's end, Albert is naturally funny as well, particularly in his pratfalls and was nominated deservedly for Best Supporting Actor, but unfortunately didn't win.Despite all the above fine work, ""Roman Holiday"" will be ultimately remembered as the American debut of Audrey Hepburn, and it should be that way.  Words seem inadequate to try to capture the dazzlingly incandescent star quality that made Audrey Hepburn so unique and irreplaceable; sufficient to say she had it, and we moviegoers were the lucky beneficiaries.  What impresses me besides this, her exquisite looks, innate intelligence, natural grace and the enchanting cadences of her voice (yes, I gush about Audrey Hepburn) is what an accomplished actress she was at such a young age, being not quite 24 when ""Roman Holiday was filmed.""  Her portrayal is fully realized, she transitions seamlessly between the comic and dramatic scenes, suggesting a wealth of emotion in her expressive countenance, and she is able to make you bubble with laughter or bring a swift rush of tears to your eyes.  Ms. Hepburn deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar, her first New York Film Critics Award and the Picturegoer Gold Medal for her Princess Anne.""Remembering Roman Holiday"" a short subject is the best of the DVD extras.  Interviews are presented with Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Catherine Wyler, daughter of the director, and film critic Molly Haskell among others.  A real treat is the opportunity to witness some of Audrey Hepburn's screen test, where she doesn't know the camera is still filming and her powerful charm comes through, and you can see just why she got the role.  There is a short on the restoration of the film that is moderately interesting from a technical standpoint, also yet another on costume designer Edith Head who designed the costumes for the film.  Finally there are the trailers and photo galleries, all good additions.  The print looks pristine; the sound is superior both thanks to the excellent restoration.If you haven't seen this film yet, what are you waiting for?",5,"""I will cherish my visit here in memory as

218098,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6300215717,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[18, 20]","Roman holiday-a time of enjoyment derived from the suffering of others.Well, that's a dictionary's definition, but I guarantee that suffering is the diametric opposite for anyone watching Audrey Hepburn's starring debut.  Ms. Hepburn stars as Princess Anne of some unnamed European kingdom.  Fed up with her heavily scheduled public relations agenda in the Eternal City, Anne goes into hysterics and flees the palace, but not before the doctor injects her with a powerful sedative.  She's rescued by Joe Bradley, a reporter with the American News Service, who takes her to his apartment and being a gentleman, does not take advantage of her in her drugged-out state.It isn't long before he finds out who she is and after tailing her, &quot;bumps&quot; into her on Rome's Spanish Steps, where she's had a new haircut and enjoying an ice cream.  There was difficulty in shooting this scene due to the heckling of spectators.Bradley enlists the aid of Irving Radovic, a photographer, promising to cut him in on an exclusive story he wants to make on the princess.  Some of the things he does to Irving to prevent their game from getting rumbled would only work in this kind of comedy.  Together, the princess, ostensibly incognito to her charges, gets the free day she wants.  Her half-lie that she's a schoolgirl playing hookey only makes her outing all the more fun.The title concept holds true as Anne goes walkabout while causing her chaperones much alarm, to the extent of sending men-in-black after her.  Also, Anne's excursion takes place in the Eternal City after all.  But it's also one for Bradley, whose boss wants him to get an exclusive on the princess, and Bradley's initial exploitative objective eventually turns into a holiday he wants Anne to have.  Also, the phrase &quot;Roman holiday&quot; is derived from the gladiatorial contests the ancient Romans enjoyed, especially in the Colisseum, which ironically is where the half-insensate Anne mumbles as her place of residence to Bradley upon their first meeting.There are also a few bits of slapstick involved.  One is the  Mouth of Truth scene, the relic sculpted on the Colisseum, a face with eyes and mouth.  Legend says that if a liar sticks his/her hand in there, it will be bitten off.  Something silly does happen, which I will not reveal.This was nominated for ten Academy Awards (but not Best Actor!!!)  Surely Gregory Peck's solid, dependable, and ultimately romantically touched performance deserved a nomination at least?  Eddie Albert (Irving) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (and lost).  It also lost Best Picture, but won for original screenplay and costume design.  Hmm, I seem to have forgotten one, but which one?  Hmm... All kidding aside, Audrey Hepburn won, beating out Deborah Kerr, Ava Gardner, and Leslie Caron for Best Actress.And it took five years for it to reach production.  Writer John Dighton was actually blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo.

Bushman (who co-starred in the ""Ben Hur"" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923).Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling.The reason ""Roman Holiday"" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome.New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is.At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points).The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things.The ""royalty"" shown in New York City (the ""Larrabee"" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of ""royalty"") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)....""Sabrina"" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way.Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family).Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career.But her ""Roman Holiday"" (1953) movie was the best of all.She played ""good royalty"" (with good values) in ""Roman Holiday"" (1953) and a ""good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook"" in ""Sabrina"" (1954).A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in ""Roman Holiday"" (1953) and ""Sabrina"" (1954).-----------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",5,"""Roman Holiday"" (1953) and ""Sabrina"" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but ""Roman Holiday"" was the best of the two.",1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,2356,"['Roman', 'Holiday', '1953', 'Sabrina', '1954', 'were', 'Audrey', 'Hepburns', 'two', 'best', 'movies', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'was', 'best', 'two.Both', 'movies', 'were', 'royalty', 'servants', 'interacting', 'intriguing', 'scheming', 'always', 'interesting', 'settings', 'beautifully', 'presented.The', 'audience', 'see', 'where', 'royalty', 'Rome', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'work', 'play', 'do', 'thing', 'help', 'very', 'smart', 'self-interested', 'servants.The', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'packed', 'actor', 'talent.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Humphry', 'Bogart', 'William', 'Holden', 'were', 'Best', 'Actor/Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'assisted', 'wonderful', 'support', 'old', 'time', 'actor', 'pros', 'including', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Walter', 'Hampton', 'Francis', 'X.', 'Bushman', 'who', 'co-starred', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Ramon', 'Navarro', 'silent', 'spic', '1923', 'screenplays', 'are', 'interesting', 'well', 'written', 'present', 'story', 'line', 'totally', 'unpredictable', 'compelling.The', 'reason', 'Roman', 'Holiday', '1953', 'best', 'two', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'difference', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Rome.New', 'York', 'City', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'Rome', 'is.At', 'least', 'way', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'show', 'two', 'cities', 'was', 'born', 'NYC', 'lived', '..I', 'know', 'NYC', 'good', 'points', '.The', 'royalty', 'shown', 'Rome', 'know', 'love', 'good', 'art', 'dance', 'varied', 'good', 'times', 'take', 'time', 'burdens', 'taste', 'royalty', 'shown', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Larrabee', 'family', 'industrialist', 'millionaire', 'socialites', '.America', 'version', 'royalty', 'are', 'dull', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'profit', 'hungry', 'machines', 'who', 'object', 'beauty', 'loveliness', 'try', 'assassinate', 'when', 'Sabrina', 'played', 'incredible', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', '.gets', 'way.Roman', 'royalty', 'played', 'Hepburn', 'better', 'USA', 'royalty', 'played', 'Bogart', 'family', '.Hepburn', 'out', 'good', 'side', 'movies', 'classy', 'princess', 'one', 'classy', 'servant', 'other', 'was', 'never', 'better', 'entire', 'actor', 'career.But', 'Roman', 'Holiday', '1953', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'all.She', 'played', 'good', 'royalty', 'good', 'values', 'Roman', 'Holiday', '1953', 'good', 'servant', 'chauffeur', 'daughter', 'training', 'become', 'cook', 'Sabrina', '1954', '.A', 'role', 'model', 'lady', 'see', 'savor', 'likes', 'whom', 'have', 'seldom', 'ever', 'been', 'portrayed', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'class', 'movies', 'Roman', 'Holiday', '1953', 'Sabrina', '1954', '-Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'Actor']",N/A

218106,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6300215717,Dennis Littrell,"[168, 172]","This was Audrey Hepburn's debut in a starring role.  She was 24-years-old  and had appeared in two or three other movies but just in bit parts.  Here she plays a reigning European princess visiting Rome who would like an escape from her daily regime of official duties, thus the title and theme of the movie, a Roman holiday.Gregory Peck plays an American newspaper reporter living in the Eternal City.  We first see him playing poker with his cronies, and losing.  His relative &quot;poverty&quot; and Princess Ann's fabulous wealth and station present a formidable barrier to their ever finding true love and marital happiness.  Part of the fun of the script is in seeing how this will play out and how their differences are resolved in the end.  I will give you a small hint: very carefully!The script comes from a story by Dalton Trumbo who is perhaps best known as the author of the anti-war  novel, Johnny Got His Gun.  Trumbo was one of the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; who were blacklisted from working in the industry during the excesses of the McCarthy era.  He went to Mexico and continued working on film scripts but under assumed names or had his scripts presented by &quot;fronts.&quot;  In this case Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for Trumbo and won an Academy Award for the story.  Later the Academy awarded Trumbo a posthumous Oscar for his work.Long time Hollywood studio director William Wyler directed the film entirely on location in Rome.  He has a formidable list of credits going well back into the silent film era including such outstanding films as Wuthering Heights (1939), The Letter (1940), The Little Foxes (1941), etc.  His clear directorial style and his attention to detail work well here.  The sets in Rome are charming, especially Peck's bachelor apartment.  The bit players, especially Peck's landlord are excellent and the events are dreamy in just the way a romantic meeting in Rome ought to be.  Wyler is especially effective in presenting Audrey Hepburn in the most flattering light and getting the audience to identify with her.Gregory Peck's character should be a bit of an adventurous rake who finds that love is more important than money or fame, but it is impossible for Peck to play a morally compromised character, and so even as he appears to be using Princess Ann for his own ends, his behavior is always correct.  I was somewhat amused to notice that at all times Peck appears wearing a tie!  Eddie Albert plays Peck's friend, a photographer/artist.  It is interesting to note how Hollywood's perception of the paparazzi has changed over the years.  Here blood-sucking, intrusive greed does not exist.  Instead we have noble self-sacrifice!I have seen most of Miss Hepburn's movies and I can say that she was never more enchanting than she is here.  She is gorgeous and cute at the same time, charming and impish, sweet, regal and very winning.  In a sense she started at the top with this film, garnering her only Oscar as Best Actress in 1953; but as her fans know she never came down off that pedestal.  Even playing poor Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady (1964), there was never any doubt about the quality of her style and character.This is the most romantic film I have ever seen, perhaps partly because Miss Hepburn is so wonderful, but also because the script in a sense turns the usual woman's romantic fantasy upside down.  Instead of the woman finding that the man she is in love with has fabulous wealth and position, it is the other way around!The ending manages to be realistic yet romantic.  There is a hint of something almost spiritual beyond what happens.  So convincing are Hepburn and Peck that one can almost believe the story is true; and indeed I am sure that Trumbo lifted the essentials of the plot from some ancient tale.I have a weakness for movies about unrequited love, or love that goes on forever, or love that is caught at some perfect moment and lives eternally in that moment.  Roman Holiday is one of those near perfect movies that plays beautifully upon one of these themes.",5,Perhaps the most romantic movie ever made,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,4052,"['was', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'debut', 'starring', 'role', 'was', '24-years-old', 'had', 'appeared', 'two', 'three', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'bit', 'parts', 'Here', 'reigning', 'European', 'princess', 'visiting', 'Rome', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'escape', 'daily', 'regime', 'official', 'duties', 'thus', 'title', 'theme', 'movie', 'Roman', 'holiday.Gregory', 'Peck', 'American', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'living', 'Eternal', 'City', 'first', 'see', 'playing', 'poker', 'cronies', 'losing', 'relative', 'quot', 'poverty', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'fabulous', 'wealth', 'station', 'present', 'formidable', 'barrier', 'ever', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'marital', 'happiness', 'Part', 'fun', 'script', 'seeing', 'how', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'how', 'differences', 'are', 'resolved', 'end', 'will', 'give', 'small', 'hint', 'very', 'carefully', 'script', 'story', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'who', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'author', 'anti-war', 'novel', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'Trumbo', 'was', 'one', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'Ten', 'quot', 'who', 'were', 'blacklisted', 'working', 'industry', 'excesses', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'went', 'Mexico', 'continued', 'working', 'film', 'scripts', 'assumed', 'names', 'had', 'scripts', 'presented', 'quot', 'quot', 'case', 'Ian', 'McLellan', 'Hunter', 'fronted', 'Trumbo', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'story', 'Later', 'Academy', 'awarded', 'Trumbo', 'posthumous', 'Oscar', 'work.Long', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'directed', 'film', 'entirely', 'location', 'Rome', 'formidable', 'list', 'credits', 'going', 'well', 'back', 'silent', 'film', 'era', 'including', 'such', 'outstanding', 'films', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', '1939', 'Letter', '1940', 'Little', 'Foxes', '1941', 'etc', 'clear', 'directorial', 'style', 'attention', 'detail', 'work', 'well', 'here', 'sets', 'Rome', 'are', 'charming', 'especially', 'Peck', 'bachelor', 'apartment', 'bit', 'players', 'especially', 'Peck', 'landlord', 'are', 'excellent', 'events', 'are', 'dreamy', 'just', 'way', 'romantic', 'meeting', 'Rome', 'ought', 'be', 'Wyler', 'especially', 'effective', 'presenting', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'most', 'flattering', 'light', 'getting', 'audience', 'identify', 'her.Gregory', 'Peck', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'bit', 'adventurous', 'rake', 'who', 'love', 'more', 'important', 'money', 'fame', 'impossible', 'Peck', 'play', 'morally', 'compromised', 'character', 'so', 'even', 'be', 'using', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'own', 'ends', 'behavior', 'always', 'correct', 'was', 'somewhat', 'amused', 'notice', 'times', 'Peck', 'wearing', 'tie', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Peck', 'friend', 'photographer/artist', 'interesting', 'note', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'perception', 'paparazzi', 'changed', 'years', 'Here', 'blood-sucking', 'intrusive', 'greed', 'not', 'exist', 'Instead', 'have', 'noble', 'self-sacrifice', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'Miss', 'Hepburn', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'enchanting', 'here', 'gorgeous', 'cute', 'same', 'time', 'charming', 'impish', 'sweet', 'regal', 'very', 'winning', 'sense', 'started', 'top', 'film', 'garnering', 'only', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', '1953', 'fans', 'know', 'never', 'came', 'down', 'off', 'pedestal', 'Even', 'playing', 'poor', 'Eliza', 'Doolittle', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', '1964', 'was', 'never', 'doubt', 'quality', 'style', 'character.This', 'most', 'romantic', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'partly', 'Miss', 'Hepburn', 'so', 'wonderful', 'also', 'script', 'sense', 'usual', 'woman', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'upside', 'down', 'Instead', 'woman', 'finding', 'man', 'love', 'fabulous', 'wealth', 'position', 'other', 'way', 'ending', 'manages', 'be', 'realistic', 'yet', 'romantic', 'hint', 'something', 'almost', 'spiritual', 'what', 'convincing', 'are', 'Hepburn', 'Peck', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'believe', 'story', 'true', 'indeed', 'am', 'sure', 'Trumbo', 'lifted', 'essentials', 'plot', 'ancient', 'tale.I', 'have', 'weakness', 'movies', 'unrequited', 'love', 'love', 'forever', 'love', 'caught', 'perfect', 'moment', 'eternally', 'moment', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'one', 'perfect', 'movies', 'beautifully', 'upon', 'one', 'themes']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Fairy tales don't really happen in our world -- especially not the kind that actually involve princesses.But you wouldn't know that from ""Roman Holiday,"" one of Audrey Hepburn's earliest ever movie roles -- as well as her breakout one. This adorable romantic comedy balances itself nicely between a sweet little romance, a lighthearted romance and the bittersweet, overhanging specter of royal duty.Bored young Princess Ann (Hepburn) goes on a ""Roman Holiday,"" when she gets upset, is sedated by a doctor, and has an odd reaction to it. Soon she has wandered out of the palace and into the streets of Rome, where she is found by struggling American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Since she appears to be drunk, he takes her home.When Joe realizes that he has the missing princess in his apartment, he takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome, with his pal taking photographs for a full article about her. But he doesn't count on falling in love with Ann, or having her truly fall for him. And Ann has a tough choice to make -- should she give up her royal life and stay with Joe, or fulfil her responsibilities as a princess?""Roman Holiday"" is one of those rare movies that sounds incredibly trite and Hollywoodish when you just hear what it's about, because it's been done so many times before. Surprise -- instead we get a movie that is mostly a cute, innocent little romance, but with an inevitable choice that looms over Anne throughout her fun.But it's a fun ride while it lasts, with Anne and Joe careening through Rome on a scooter, dancing by the river, and getting her hair cut. This doesn't sound very funny, but William Wyler plays it with plenty of little jokes, including Joe's scandalized landlady raving at poor Anne in Italian, assuming that she's a one-night stand. And near the end he twists the storyline into a bittersweet examination of duty vs. love, with Anne forced to consider which way her life will go.And there's one joke that Peck played on Hepburn in reality -- the infamous ""Mouth of Truth"" scene. There's a reason Hepburn shrieked so convincingly: she had really been tricked.Hepburn and Gregory Peck are thoroughly solid as love interests -- Peck is breezy and likable as the jaded American journalist who is seizing an opportunity. And Hepburn showed off her range here -- she can be funny and quirky (including a hilarious ""drunk"" scene), then switch over into a doe-eyed sadness that breaks the heart.""Roman Holiday"" is a modern-day fairy tale that never sacrifices integrity for cheap gooey romance.

218111,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300215717,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","In a beautifully restored print, this fairy tale movie provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. The approach works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. One can see her star rising most precipitously throughout this film, even in scenes as seemingly minor as the one where she sits on the Spanish Steps breathlessly describing her perfect day. Nonetheless, the revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie, quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc from opportunistic reporter to smitten commoner that makes the ending so bittersweet.Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like ""Wuthering Heights"" or ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has some nice extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to movie costuming.

Additionally, it is a wonderfully romantic, sweet story, with a good script and many funny moments!Essentially, Roman Holiday is about a young Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) who gets tired of her sheltered life as a princess and decides to run away and explore the world for herself. She leaves the palace and stumbles along until falling asleep on a park bench in Rome, where she is found by a cynical newspaper reporter (Gregory Peck) who reluctantly takes her home. As soon as he realizes who she is, however, he decides to take her around Rome and use his experience with her to write a tell all article on the princess and her life.

Often times, movies of that era have a certain stiltedness in the acting, or a clear use of sets and backdrops which I find distracting.""Roman Holiday"" was a pleasant surprise. Not only is the film shot on location in Italy, giving it a realism and vibrancy missing from many movies of that period, it is also written with a sensibility for dialogue and character development that still rings true, for the most part.A pampered, but overburdened princess, Audrey Hepburn's character is about to have a breakdown. She wants so much to experience life as a normal person that she decides to escape one night, during her entourage's visit to Rome, the Eternal City. Still suffering the effects of a sleep aid from her doctor, she finds herself on the streets late at night and in the arms of Gregory Peck, a conniving and penniless reporter. Peck realizes he has stumbled upon the story of a lifetime. Even as he conceals his purpose from the princess, she tries to conceal her identity from him, in hopes of enjoying the city life as a commoner.Although the story has no major twists, it uses its simple devices to great effect, for humor and romance. I think the acting and casting is brilliant, and I felt a chemistry between the two leads that resonates through the final bittersweet scenes.

It is sweet, romantic, schmaltzy, enchanting and funny.  Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is feeling overwrought by her royal obligations and tight schedule.  She longs to be free of the burden of privilege, so one night in Rome she slips out of the royal accommodations late at night to see the city.  The trouble is she has just been given a sedative, which has a similar effect to that which alcohol has on a lush on a bender.  She is discovered sleeping near a fountain by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her to his apartment to sleep it off despite his better judgment.  Joe is a reporter who is supposed to interview the princess the next day, though he doesn't recognize her (extremely implausible, but alright, it is a necessary plot device and this was before TV was ubiquitous).When he realizes who she is, he plots to conduct a surreptitious personal interview with her by showing her around the town and not telling her that he is a reporter.  What results is a charming jaunt about historic Rome that turns into instant love.  There are numerous zany scenes and lots of slapstick humor, but it all works because Hepburn and Peck are so fabulous together.This film was directed by legendary director William Wyler (Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives, Wuthering Heights), who chose wonderful locations throughout Rome to give the romance a storybook flavor.  Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and impetuous princess.  It was a rich and adorable performance, which that was both captivating and amusing.  The scenes where she was intoxicated were precious and her nave view of the world was endearing.  Gregory Peck was dashing as the knave, with his understated flair for ironic and physical comedy.  Eddie Albert (most famous for TV's Green Acres) adds to the fun as Joe's scheming photographer who spends much of the film getting drenched and falling down.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actress, costumes and story.  It won only three (actress, story and costumes) in a year dominated by ""From Here to Eternity""(Eleven Nominations, Eight Oscars).  It is a delightfully entertaining story that is as enjoyable today as it was in 1953.  I rated it a 10/10.

218122,A2BPDFR58H9575,6300215717,Galina,"[2, 2]","William Wyler's ""Roman Holiday"" is one of the very best, most charming fantasy/romantic comedies ever made. It is sweet, funny, simple, beautiful, and tender. It takes place in the eternal city of Rome during 24 hours that its heroine as well as every movie lover in the world will cherish for as long as they live. The heroine is a young princess, the sole heiress to the throne of an unnamed European country. One evening while visiting Rome, she decides to take a holiday from her royal duties and stiffing life style and explore Rome as one of commoners on her own. She is accompanied by an American newsman, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and his cameraman and sidekick, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert).Everything and everyone is perfect and highly enjoyable in ""Roman Holiday"". Wyler's idea to direct the film entirely in Rome proved to be extremely successful. The script by Dalton Trumbo is terrific. Peck as a handsome journalist who seems to hit a jack pot with the story about a runaway princess that can make him both famous and rich but whose plans collapsed when he fell in love with her was perfect for a role. So was Eddie Albert in his Oscar nominated performance.The film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. With her blend of innocence, vulnerability, inner strength, and real class, she was perfectly cast in her first Hollywood role that brought her the Oscar. Hepburn was the daughter of a Dutch Aristocrat mother and a British father. She spent the WWII years starving and hiding from Nazis in occupied Holland. The article from the time of ""Roman Holiday""s release describes Audrey as an original, ""A thin child-woman with irregular teeth, wide jawbone, flaring nostrils and upswept brows, yet she carries herself with ethereal grace and entrances with a smile both wistful and radiant, and has remarkably large and expressive eyes."" Gregory Peck predicted from the very first day of the shooting that Hepburn would win Academy Award for her performance and she'd become a huge star. She went to many screen successes including ""Sabrina"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany"", Charade, and ""My Fair Lady"" among others. Her death from cancer in 1992 at the age of 63 left a gap that will never be filled. There will never be another Audrey Hepburn but the final scene of her first film with the close-up of her marvelous face and that ""wistful and radiant smile"" will live forever as one of the cinema's most precious images.",5,"""Rome!

218129,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6300215717,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","How do you not fall in love with Audrey Hepburn from jump? Then 24 years old, she landed her first major role in ROMAN HOLIDAY, a timeless picture which would set the tone for the rest of Audrey Hepburn's film career. Gamine and classy and trend-setting and luminous Audrey Hepburn. Not that Gregory Peck or Eddie Albert are exactly scrapes off the bottom of your shoe, mind you. Peck and Albert round out a pitch-perfect cast.Expectations on them being set on such lofty standards, royals can't be blamed for acting out every now and then. Supervised by a coterie of rigid official aides, shackled to an endless routine of ever proper decorum at public functions, it's no wonder that young Ann (Hepburn), modern-day crown princess to some mythical kingdom, finally snaps and runs away during a good will tour of Rome (but not before averting a shoe disaster at a royal reception). Encountering broke American journalist Joe Bradley (Peck) while in a vulnerable state - she was actually only terribly sleepy although he thought her inebriated - Princess Ann passes herself off as ""Anya Smith.""This being the sort of picture in which the crusading reporter is featured as a stand-up guy, Bradley gallantly (okay, reluctantly) allows her the use of his bed. But Bradley catches wise to her true identity, and he's soon promising his incredulous editor an earthshaking scoop. On the pretense of showing the princess the sights of the Eternal City, he latches on to her. He manages to coax his photographer pal Irving (Eddie Albert) to tag along and snap them pretty pics. Eddie Albert, by the way, is marvelously easy-going and effortlessly funny here. It's maybe my favorite performance of his. He's soon calling Anya Smith ""Smitty.""There's something uncalculated and tender and so wistful about this runaway princess fable, and one can't dismiss the warm, protective stance Gregory Peck's character eventually assumes over the princess, which I think is colored by his demeanor towards Hepburn in real life. Halfway thru the shooting of this film, Peck - whose contract entitled him to solo star billing - called for Hepburn's name to share lead credits with him.In Rome, to her endless delight, ""Anya Smith"" proceeds to fall into one scrape after another. She nearly crashes a moped. While eluding her government's agents who are turning over every rock looking for her, she gets involved in a bar brawl and runs afoul of the local polizia. She gets a haircut. She falls in love. Would all burdened royals have such freedom, however fleeting. Princess Ann, recognizing her responsibilities to her kingdom, eventually returns to her shackles. But she'll always have Rome and her secret memories of an enchanting respite and a star-crossed romance.Hollywood lore tells of Hepburn's auditioning for this role, and how after her subdued screen test, the cameraman kept the film rolling. In the ensuing relaxed conversation with director William Wyler, Hepburn's natural charm and bearing bubbled up. Wyler was so taken with her then that he cast her in the part. Hepburn was an instant sensation, getting nominated and then walking away with the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress.ROMAN HOLIDAY, to me, is a perfect film. Wyler takes full advantage of the sights of Rome, capturing the flavor and bustle of the Eternal City and making it into a secondary character. The perfectly-paced narrative elicits from its audience emotions ranging from wild amusement to deep affection to melancholia. Peck and Hepburn are flawless. Perhaps nothing encapsulates their natural synergy better than the scene at the Mouth of Truth (which Peck improvised). And the final sequence - in which Princess Ann gravely receives the press (including one Joe Bradley) - makes for one of the most unforgettable, most romantic moments in film history. Hepburn has made so many watchable films, but while she would go on to match her performance in ROMAN HOLIDAY, in my opinion, she would never exceed it.

There are five fundamental reasons that support this timeless classic: The presence of the most lovable, tender and charismatic Audrey Hepburn who spells the viewer since her first appearance on screen; Rome itself, its streets, historical  monuments and sympathetic people; the fluid direction of William Wyler who must have found inspiration around the greatest exponents of the Italian neo realism; the presence of Gregory Peck whose touch of class and refinement makes he was the perfect counterpart for her and finally the marvelous script, which never falls in common places.As you and me are well aware, this brief space of twenty fours in the life of a Princess must be lived with frantic intensity, breaking the rules here and there. And spite we are conscious they will never become a permanent couple makes us conscious about the brevity of the life and how every little and insignificant moment must be lived - for better or worst.The final sequence in which the Princess receives the set of photographs accents still more the beginning of the nostalgia for those moments that will never come back.API chose labeled it among the four best romantic films ever. But far from this fact, Miss Hepburn won the coveted Academy award in 1953 when most of people thought the Prize would be for Deborah Kerr for he role in ""From here to the eternity.""But finally What about Hollywood `s charm without Miss Hepburn? What about the proud of the cinema without ""Sabrina"" ""Breakfast in Tiffany"" and ""Two for the road"" (a film that personally love it)?Wherever she is, Audrey will always be the timeless bride of Hollywood.",5,24 hours far from the stifling rules!,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,1865,"['newspaper', 'man', 'Rome', 'will', 'meet', 'realizing', 'Princess', 'who', 'away', 'Palace', 'travel', 'incognito', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'cities', 'world.The', 'very', 'nature', 'romantic-comedy-fantasy', 'everybody', 'are', 'five', 'fundamental', 'reasons', 'support', 'timeless', 'classic', 'presence', 'most', 'lovable', 'tender', 'charismatic', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'viewer', 'first', 'appearance', 'screen', 'Rome', 'streets', 'historical', 'monuments', 'sympathetic', 'people', 'fluid', 'direction', 'William', 'Wyler', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'found', 'inspiration', 'greatest', 'exponents', 'Italian', 'neo', 'realism', 'presence', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'touch', 'class', 'refinement', 'was', 'perfect', 'counterpart', 'finally', 'marvelous', 'script', 'never', 'common', 'places.As', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'brief', 'space', 'twenty', 'fours', 'life', 'Princess', 'must', 'be', 'lived', 'frantic', 'intensity', 'breaking', 'rules', 'here', 'there', 'spite', 'are', 'conscious', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'permanent', 'couple', 'conscious', 'brevity', 'life', 'how', 'little', 'insignificant', 'moment', 'must', 'be', 'lived', 'better', 'worst.The', 'final', 'sequence', 'Princess', 'set', 'photographs', 'accents', 'still', 'more', 'beginning', 'nostalgia', 'moments', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'back.API', 'chose', 'labeled', 'four', 'best', 'romantic', 'films', 'ever', 'far', 'fact', 'Miss', 'Hepburn', 'won', 'coveted', 'Academy', 'award', '1953', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'thought', 'Prize', 'would', 'be', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'role', 'here', 'eternity', 'finally', 'What', 'Hollywood', 's', 'charm', 'Miss', 'Hepburn', 'What', 'proud', 'cinema', 'Sabrina', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'Two', 'road', 'film', 'personally', 'love', 'Audrey', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'timeless', 'bride', 'Hollywood']",N/A
218132,A364VIQ3KLAWVX,6300215717,H. M Pyles,"[6, 6]","I have always felt that people who think they have fallen in love in a day are either hopelessly silly, immature, or emotionally stunted.  This movie is proof that, even in the days before computer animation, great films had the power to make it seem reasonable that pigs can fly . . . or that love really can only take a day.Audrey Hepburn, in her first star turn, took my breath away in this film, and I still haven't quite recovered.  Apparently her effervescent magic was apparent on both sides of the camera, as many in the cast knew before the film came out of the editing room that they had an Oscar contender on their hands.  I've seen countless actresses from the heydey of black-and-white film get those softlit close-ups that envelope them in angelic, dreamy auras.  But those shots have never seared into my memory the way Wyler's do here.  I think it is, in part, because we watch these old films with too much knowledge of how the stars lived out their lives and met their ends.  But Hepburn's luminescence was more than an artifact of good film-making.  It was part of the natural grace and charity that she never outlived off camera, and all any cameraman ever had to worry about with her was not letting the camera miss what was there rather than trying to create what wasn't.There can be more room for debate about casting Gregory Peck as the reporter who, in finding his heart, finds his professional conscience.  But for me, the Peck-Hepburn combo works beautifully.  While Princess Ann is an intelligent, conscientious young woman, she is nevertheless just stepping over the threshold from girlhood and still dangerously encumbered with heedless naivete as she sallies forth into life among the hoi polloi.  Peck, in his slightly dour paternalism, creates an anchor of security from which Princess Ann can launch her escapades without leaving the viewer clutching his chair with anxiety.  A more rakish or cavalier leading man might have added more of a comedic twist here and there, but he would have also added a tension that would have prevented the spell from crystallizing around that magical twenty-four hours.After being lofted higher and higher by an airy and delightful (and impossibly fast) romance, we are then brought in for a fast and hard landing.  It turns out the seemingly confused, wispy, naive Princess Ann is actually built of stern stuff indeed.  Knowing her calling to be one of public duty and rectitude, she had chosen to taste a bit of life on the other side not to make a choice, but to understand more fully the divide that stood between her and those people for whose good she must work without ever being able to be part of it.Her Roman holiday came at a price she never expected -- a love that would remain unrequitted for the rest of her life.  And, with a grace and unspoken eloquence seldom seen on the big screen, she paid it and walked alone into her future.  The young princess who had trouble keeping her high heels on at the start of the movie ends it by stepping into a pair of shoes she will never again kick off, no matter how uncomfortable the heels or how long the ceremony.",5,Almost Makes Me Believe,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,3138,"['have', 'always', 'felt', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'day', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'silly', 'immature', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'movie', 'proof', 'even', 'days', 'computer', 'animation', 'great', 'films', 'had', 'power', 'make', 'seem', 'reasonable', 'pigs', 'can', 'fly', 'love', 'really', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'day.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'first', 'star', 'turn', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'film', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'recovered', 'Apparently', 'effervescent', 'magic', 'was', 'apparent', 'sides', 'camera', 'many', 'cast', 'knew', 'film', 'came', 'editing', 'room', 'had', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'hands', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'actresses', 'heydey', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'get', 'softlit', 'close-ups', 'envelope', 'angelic', 'dreamy', 'auras', 'shots', 'have', 'never', 'seared', 'memory', 'way', 'Wyler', 'do', 'here', 'think', 'part', 'watch', 'old', 'films', 'too', 'much', 'knowledge', 'how', 'stars', 'lived', 'out', 'lives', 'met', 'ends', 'Hepburn', 'luminescence', 'was', 'more', 'artifact', 'good', 'film-making', 'was', 'part', 'natural', 'grace', 'charity', 'never', 'outlived', 'off', 'camera', 'cameraman', 'ever', 'had', 'worry', 'was', 'not', 'letting', 'camera', 'miss', 'what', 'was', 'rather', 'trying', 'create', 'what', ""wasn't.There"", 'can', 'be', 'more', 'room', 'debate', 'casting', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'reporter', 'who', 'finding', 'heart', 'professional', 'conscience', 'Peck-Hepburn', 'combo', 'beautifully', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'intelligent', 'conscientious', 'young', 'woman', 'nevertheless', 'just', 'stepping', 'over', 'threshold', 'girlhood', 'still', 'dangerously', 'encumbered', 'heedless', 'naivete', 'forth', 'life', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'Peck', 'slightly', 'dour', 'paternalism', 'anchor', 'security', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'can', 'launch', 'escapades', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'clutching', 'chair', 'anxiety', 'more', 'rakish', 'cavalier', 'leading', 'man', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'comedic', 'twist', 'here', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'added', 'tension', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', 'spell', 'crystallizing', 'around', 'magical', 'twenty-four', 'hours.After', 'being', 'lofted', 'higher', 'higher', 'airy', 'delightful', 'impossibly', 'fast', 'romance', 'are', 'then', 'brought', 'fast', 'hard', 'landing', 'out', 'seemingly', 'confused', 'wispy', 'naive', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'actually', 'built', 'stern', 'stuff', 'indeed', 'Knowing', 'calling', 'be', 'one', 'public', 'duty', 'rectitude', 'had', 'chosen', 'taste', 'bit', 'life', 'other', 'side', 'not', 'make', 'choice', 'understand', 'more', 'fully', 'divide', 'stood', 'people', 'good', 'must', 'work', 'ever', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'part', 'it.Her', 'Roman', 'holiday', 'came', 'price', 'never', 'expected', 'love', 'would', 'remain', 'unrequitted', 'rest', 'life', 'grace', 'unspoken', 'eloquence', 'seldom', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'paid', 'walked', 'alone', 'future', 'young', 'princess', 'who', 'had', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'high', 'heels', 'start', 'movie', 'stepping', 'pair', 'shoes', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'kick', 'off', 'matter', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'heels', 'how', 'long', 'ceremony']",N/A

What a great romantic fantasy!It is one of my all-time favorites, one of the films I could watch several times, without getting bored.I don't think that the plot is important here, but the way the actors performed and the place where the story is set.In Rome, a European princess manages to escape the rigid and boring life and have and unforgettable experience, living for one day as a normal person. She does all the things that she was not allowed to do before, such as cutting her hair, eating ice-cream, strolling down the streets and why not, falling in love with an ordinary man.This is the role that brought Audrey Hepburn an Oscar and made her a well-known star.It is the natural and ingenuous performance that makes her such a charming and unforgettable character, a graceful presence on the screen.Her companion is Gregory Peck who has also a great performance and makes the film even more delightful. He plays the part of a young and charming journalist, looking for news that might increase sales of his newspaper and bring some money in his pocket.The DVD includes also a section with a kind of &quot;making of&quot;: interviews of the people who participated at the shooting, memories, etc. This is even more interesting, as you will have the chance to listen to the people who were involved in this project, and the stories behind the scene.

With the recent hulabaloo over the marriage of England's Prince William to commoner Kate Middleton, I set out to re-watch one of my favorite royal films of all time: 1953's ""Roman Holiday"". Directed by William Wyler and starring the formidable Gregory Peck and a then-unknown ingenue named Audrey Hepburn (who would go on to win an Oscar for this, her first major role), it combines romance, adventure, and a bit of light-hearted fun in the Eternal City.Hepburn plays Princess Ann, the heiress to the throne of an unnamed European country. After visiting several capital cities, she lands in Rome, where, after a state dinner, she has a nervous breakdown. She simply wants to be a normal person, but duty to her country will not allow it. After being sedated, she sneaks out of the embassy (before the medication can take effect) to live a few hours on her own terms.Needless to say, the sedative eventually DOES take effect, and Ann is found sleeping on the street by an American reporter, Joe Bradley (Peck). Not quite knowing what to do with the woman, he brings her back to his apartment and lets her crash on his couch. The following morning, after over-sleeping and seeing a picture of Her Royal Highness splashed across the front page of the paper, he realizes that the woman currently sleeping in his place is a princess - and he makes a bet with his boss that he can get an exclusive story from her.Initially, the two have opposite ideas. Ann simply wants to play hooky from her duties, and is excited when Joe decides to join her for the day. The two, accompanied by Bradley's photographer friend Irving Radovich (played by a pre-Green Acres Eddie Albert), tour Rome's most famous locations, from the Piazza di Spagna to the Coliseum to the Mouth of Truth. Along the way, they run into adventures and mishaps involving one of the city's famous scooters.Predictably, the two develop feelings for each other. However, Ann's holiday can only last a day, so the two must figure out what will happen when the clock strikes midnight and she turns back into a princess. It's a look at the driving forces that pull people in their lives, from love to family to duty to career.Shot in black-and-white (though restored here) and filmed on location in Rome, ""Roman Holiday"" is one of those films that I never seem to tire of. There's something magical about it, though whether it has to do with royalty or the fact that it shows a great look at post-World War II Italy, I'm not sure. And while, like many have said, Cary Grant may have hammed up the lead male role more, there's something soothing about knowing that Gregory Peck will work it all out in the end.",5,Magical,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,2703,"['royalty', 'never', 'style', 'recent', 'hulabaloo', 'marriage', 'England', 'Prince', 'William', 'commoner', 'Kate', 'Middleton', 'set', 'out', 're-watch', 'one', 'favorite', 'royal', 'films', 'time', '1953', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'Directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'starring', 'formidable', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'then-unknown', 'ingenue', 'named', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'win', 'Oscar', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'romance', 'adventure', 'bit', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'Eternal', 'City.Hepburn', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'heiress', 'throne', 'unnamed', 'European', 'country', 'visiting', 'several', 'capital', 'cities', 'Rome', 'where', 'state', 'dinner', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'simply', 'be', 'normal', 'person', 'duty', 'country', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'being', 'sedated', 'embassy', 'medication', 'can', 'take', 'effect', 'live', 'few', 'hours', 'own', 'terms.Needless', 'say', 'sedative', 'eventually', 'DOES', 'take', 'effect', 'Ann', 'found', 'sleeping', 'street', 'American', 'reporter', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'Peck', 'Not', 'quite', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'woman', 'back', 'apartment', 'crash', 'couch', 'following', 'morning', 'over-sleeping', 'seeing', 'picture', 'Her', 'Royal', 'Highness', 'splashed', 'front', 'page', 'paper', 'woman', 'currently', 'sleeping', 'place', 'princess', 'bet', 'boss', 'can', 'get', 'exclusive', 'story', 'her.Initially', 'two', 'have', 'opposite', 'ideas', 'Ann', 'simply', 'play', 'hooky', 'duties', 'excited', 'when', 'Joe', 'join', 'day', 'two', 'accompanied', 'Bradley', 'photographer', 'friend', 'Irving', 'Radovich', 'played', 'pre-Green', 'Acres', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'tour', 'Rome', 'most', 'famous', 'locations', 'Piazza', 'di', 'Spagna', 'Coliseum', 'Mouth', 'Truth', 'way', 'run', 'adventures', 'mishaps', 'involving', 'one', 'city', 'famous', 'scooters.Predictably', 'two', 'develop', 'feelings', 'other', 'However', 'Ann', 'holiday', 'can', 'only', 'last', 'day', 'two', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'clock', 'strikes', 'midnight', 'back', 'princess', 'look', 'driving', 'forces', 'pull', 'people', 'lives', 'love', 'family', 'duty', 'career.Shot', 'black-and-white', 'restored', 'here', 'filmed', 'location', 'Rome', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'one', 'films', 'never', 'seem', 'tire', 'something', 'magical', 'do', 'royalty', 'fact', 'great', 'look', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'Italy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'may', 'have', 'hammed', 'up', 'lead', 'male', 'role', 'more', 'something', 'soothing', 'knowing', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'end']",N/A

Second, since I was 15, I've been collecting and (still can be found) catting-about-town on my Italian scooters (Lambrettas--TV175 (despite its highly unreliable nature) and Vespas--90, 150, GS, 200).  Now flashback to my early days of peon-hood and slaving in a drug-store that sold VHS films--I unpacked this film one day.  Audrey on Vespa  w/ Gregory Peck.  It called to me as no other movie.  I bought it that day!This movie is style and sophistication brought to life.  It is so near perfect, that it almost defies commentary.  Audrey, running off with the dashing gentleman-but-cad-at-heart Gregory Peck.  A film made slighty before the Jet-Set age, where travel to Europe was still somewhat of a novelty for most Americans.I enjoy this film more each time I watch it.  I cannot wait until its release on DVD.Get this film before any other Audrey movie.  You will love it. Then RUN out and get Breakfast at Tiffany's (a perfect movie, scored by the perfect maestro--Mancini) and Charade (w/ Cary Grant--the perfect spy-spoof from the very start).",5,"Simply, one of my all-time favorites...",967680000,"08 31, 2000",2000,1280,"['When', 'beauty', 'grace', 'elegance', 'style', 'no-one', 'else', 'NEAR', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', ""'ll"", 'have', 'confess', 'bit', 'shallowness', 'brought', 'film', 'First', 'childhood', 'have', 'always', 'adored', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Second', 'was', '15', ""'ve"", 'been', 'collecting', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'catting-about-town', 'Italian', 'scooters', 'Lambrettas', 'TV175', 'highly', 'unreliable', 'nature', 'Vespas', '90', '150', 'GS', '200', 'Now', 'flashback', 'early', 'days', 'peon-hood', 'slaving', 'drug-store', 'sold', 'VHS', 'films', 'unpacked', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'Audrey', 'Vespa', 'w/', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'called', 'other', 'movie', 'bought', 'day', 'movie', 'style', 'sophistication', 'brought', 'life', 'so', 'near', 'perfect', 'almost', 'commentary', 'Audrey', 'running', 'off', 'dashing', 'gentleman-but-cad-at-heart', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'A', 'film', 'made', 'slighty', 'Jet-Set', 'age', 'where', 'travel', 'Europe', 'was', 'still', 'somewhat', 'novelty', 'most', 'Americans.I', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'release', 'DVD.Get', 'film', 'other', 'Audrey', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'Then', 'RUN', 'out', 'get', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'perfect', 'movie', 'scored', 'perfect', 'maestro', 'Mancini', 'Charade', 'w/', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'perfect', 'spy-spoof', 'very', 'start']",N/A

At first, Peck does not recognize her but, when he does, he knows he can get the scoop of his life. He squires her around, seeing the sites of Roman and surreptitiously taking notes and photos. He is also falling in love with her.All too soon, she realizes that she has to get back. By this time, she has fallen in love with him as well and that makes for a painful parting. It also makes for a difficult choice for Peck. He can publish his story and make his fortune at her expense or he can suppress it and remain poor.This was a delightful vehcle for Hepburn.

It is also Audrey Hepburn's debut starring role, for which she won a Best Actress Oscar.  At just 24, Audrey was young, stunning, talented, charming, radiant, majestic, cute, elfin, and clearly at the top of her game.  Rumor has it that the credits originally were to have Gregory Peck's name first, then the title of the film, then the statement ""and introducing Audrey Hepburn.""  After the first week of filming, Gregory Peck called the studio and the director, and told them something along the lines of  ""Audrey Hepburn IS this movie; her name needs to appear above the title with mine.""  How noble and gallant.  Mr. Peck, himself, is top-notch in this role; I fall in love with him a little more each time I watch it.This movie was filmed on location in Rome, and the scenery is breathtaking, making this movie all the more romantic.  My husband and I have fun pointing out all of the places we have been.  The restoration is very impressive; the print looks fresh and clear; the details are vivid.  It is also interesting to notice the play of light and dark, of shadow and bright.  These techniques are used at their best in this film, and are lost (and perhaps unnecessary) in color films.We recently showed this film to our 11 year old daughter.  It was a lazy, rainy Sunday morning, and she ""didn't have anything better to do.""  She started watch with some token protest, and then watched quite intently.  At the end, she said, ""Hey, that was pretty good...and I didn't even really notice that it was in black and white!""

218155,A2W8E91R4R9NF5,6300215717,"Karina A. Suarez ""Karina A. Fogliani-Ahmed""","[1, 1]","In the spirit of the love that reigns around Valentine's Day, I watched Roman Holiday, a classic suggested to me in terms of style.  Besides the fact that the film sky-rocketed the &uuml;ber-stylish and lovely Audrey Hepburn's career, it was appealing and refreshing to me watching views of the ""eternal city"", in the land of my ancestors, and where I still have not been lucky enough to visit.The chemistry between Hepburn and her co-star Gregory Peck in this film is electric and full of a demure sexual tension that only Hepburn was capable of giving.  She is a true comedian, yet never lets go of that aura of regal style and elegance that was classic of old Hollywood films and which came naturally to her.  The story of a Princess suffocated by her duties and longing for some ""normal"" time, spent among ordinary people who have no idea who she is remains the ultimate fairy tale story.  It was quite a story at the time as well, and I remember my mother talking to me about this classic Audrey Hepburn film, which in Argentina was known as ""La Princesa que quer&iacute;a vivir"", and which was ostensibly based on England's Princess Margaret story and her love affair with Equerry Peter Townsend.  In a perfectly politically correct statement included in one of the featurettes - ""Remembering Roman Holiday"", film producer A.C. Lyles explains how events really just ""happened"" like that, but it was never his intention to make a film that would illustrate the time when the present Queen of England's sister decided to put duty before love and chose what it ultimately turned out to be an unhappy life.  Still, in this day and age, and after learning of sad stories like Princess Diana's loveless marriage, one wonders if the pun was not entirely unintended.Whatever the case, the film does not disappoint.  Both Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck offer a picture of physical human perfection - he, tall, dark and handsome; she, also dark, slim and with alabaster skin, and talent that drips off the screen.  The movie was Hepburn's first major starring role and also her first Oscar win, and Peck's request to list her as equally important in the credits next to his name speaks not just of generosity but of the vision necessary to give a true star the recognition she deserved in order to push the film to stardom.I really enjoyed the bonus materials included in this edition of the film, not just the aforementioned ""Remembering Roman Holiday"", which tells the story of how the film became a reality, even having to battle against a blacklisted script writer who was accused of Communist sympathizing; but also the one entitled ""Edith Head - the Paramount years"", where one can watch exclusive footage of Audrey Hepburn in the designer's costumes, as well as a full background of this award-winning costume designer.

218156,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,6300215717,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[4, 4]","I remember the first time I saw this movie, as a child, with the absolutely radiant Audrey Hepburn in her first major role as the naive, protected Princess determined to have her day of freedom and to escape from her overscheduled, dreary routine.How lucky Hepburn was to have Gregory Peck as a costar, a man who was gallant (and wise) enough to insist she be listed as a costar, right up there alongside him in the credits. The studio wanted to use the words ""and introducing Audrey Hepburn"" in the credits but Peck believed -and turned out to be right- that she would win the Academy Award for her excellent portrayal, which may seem a bit over the top to today's audiences but absolutely charmed viewers at the time (I still love the movie).The story behind this movie is nearly as fascinating as the movie itself and it is worth buying this Collector's Edition to get some of that behind the scenes info in the special sections. Frank Capra was set to direct the movie but when he found out that the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo was the scriptwriter, he bailed. That's when Wyler stepped in, letting Trumbo do the writing but having another writer ""front"" for him. It took years for Trumbo to be duly recognized.I do believe this film is best seen in black and white, as it was intentionally filmed this way. Why? Because it was shot on location, in Rome, at a time when movies were often filmed in Hollywood, with backdrops to give the illusion of another country. But not THIS time. However, Wyler feared that if the movie was shot in color, Rome might overshadow the story itself. As it is, some have called Rome the third ""character"" in this film and it benefits greatly by being shot on location.",5,How many people know Dalton Trumbo actually wrote the screenplay?,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,1702,"['remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'child', 'absolutely', 'radiant', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'naive', 'protected', 'Princess', 'determined', 'have', 'day', 'freedom', 'escape', 'overscheduled', 'dreary', 'routine.How', 'lucky', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'have', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'costar', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'gallant', 'wise', 'enough', 'insist', 'be', 'listed', 'costar', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'alongside', 'credits', 'studio', 'wanted', 'use', 'words', 'introducing', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'credits', 'Peck', 'believed', '-and', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'right-', 'would', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'top', 'today', 'audiences', 'absolutely', 'charmed', 'viewers', 'time', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'story', 'movie', 'nearly', 'as', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'get', 'scenes', 'info', 'special', 'sections', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'was', 'set', 'direct', 'movie', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'blacklisted', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'was', 'scriptwriter', 'bailed', 'when', 'Wyler', 'stepped', 'letting', 'Trumbo', 'do', 'writing', 'having', 'writer', 'front', 'took', 'years', 'Trumbo', 'be', 'duly', 'recognized.I', 'do', 'believe', 'film', 'best', 'seen', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'intentionally', 'filmed', 'way', 'Why', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Rome', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'often', 'filmed', 'Hollywood', 'backdrops', 'give', 'illusion', 'country', 'not', 'THIS', 'time', 'However', 'Wyler', 'feared', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'color', 'Rome', 'might', 'overshadow', 'story', 'have', 'called', 'Rome', 'third', 'character', 'film', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'being', 'shot', 'location']",N/A

218158,ABHBURBXUZFF8,6300215717,Kurt Miller,"[1, 1]","Roman Holiday is a 1953 romantic comedy directed by William Wyler and starring Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert. It was filmed entirely in Italy and relates the story of a mischevious child-woman princess named Anne who runs away from home to have a blast with the 'common people.' It was the motion picture which kicked off Hepburn's career and gained her an oscar for Best Leading Actress.I haven't seen any of the other Best Leading Actress nominees that year but I wish Audrey Hepburn could have won an oscar for a more substantial role like Natasha in War and Peace or Sister Luke in The Nun's Story where she proved she was more than a mere movie star for romantic comedies anymore than John Wayne was a mere movie star for westerns. That being said, I still enjoyed her kooky antics and classy attire. Gregory Peck (Joe Bradley) does his best in what is obviously a Cary Grant role and the rest of the cast is not particulary memorable.Sometimes there is a little too much dialogue and the movie probably could have wrapped up when Joe drives Anne back to the palace but there are some charming scenes such as the Mouth of Truth and the motorcycle ride.When you have the flu or are stuck inside during a rainy saturday afternoon, sit back and watch Audrey Hepburn make mischief.

Joe is an experimented and bohemian American reporter, who loses almost all his money to his grateful friends.Both characters meet that in a roman plaza.Princess is under a sedative effect, Joe come to her rescue believing she is drunk and tries to leave her in charge of a taxi driver until she recovers.No way! Fate has designed Joe as her Guardian Angel!Next morning Joe discovers who she really is and tries to get the ""exclusive"" for him and his photographer, without telling Ann who they are.From that point on a joyful ""Roman Cavalcade"" starts: Trevi's Fountain, Coliseum, Roman Forum, picturesque street market, crazy motorcycle ride, Police Station and finally a ball on a ship, fist fight included.Voila!Audrey Hepburn is a real Angel floating over Rome! She transmits an exact balance to her character, which will indelibly remain  in every spectator's mind and heart.She won her only Oscar with this performance.Gregory Peck is marvelous delivering an unusual (for him) romantic personage.Special mention must be done for the beautiful B&W; photography in charge of two European cinematographers: Henri Alekan (also responsible for ""The Battle of the Rail"" (1946)) and Franz Planer, 150 films between 1920-1962 and five Oscar nominations, including this film.For me it was very interesting to compare the present view of Rome with the one given by Fellini in his ""La Dolce Vita"" (1960).Film lovers will enjoy this gem!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Showing Rome to Princess Ann!,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2358,"['Roman', 'Holiday', '1953', 'quintessence', 'romantic', 'comedy.All', 'ingredients', 'are', 'there', 'young', 'innocent', 'princess', 'trying', 'taste', 'life', 'broken', 'middle-aged', 'journalist', 'trying', 'refill', 'wallet', 'ROME', 'monuments', 'people', 'music', 'wine', 'What', 'else', 'do', 'need', 'William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'shrewd', 'director', 'author', 'many', 'outstanding', 'movies', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', '1939', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', '1946', 'Ben-Hur', '1959', 'amongst', 'others', 'won', 'three', 'times', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'was', 'nominated', 'nine', 'more', 'times', 'same', 'award', '1937', '1966.He', 'delivers', 'here', 'movie-champagne', 'fresh', 'exhilarating', 'yet', 'story', 'showing', 'oppressing', 'life', 'schedule', 'very', 'young', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'must', 'bear', 'protocolar', 'visit', 'Rome.She', 'escape', 'night', 'furtively', 'experiment', 'real', 'life', 'corner', 'Rome', 'bunch', 'press-men', 'are', 'playing', 'cards', 'Joe', 'experimented', 'bohemian', 'American', 'reporter', 'who', 'almost', 'money', 'grateful', 'friends.Both', 'characters', 'meet', 'roman', 'plaza.Princess', 'sedative', 'effect', 'Joe', 'come', 'rescue', 'believing', 'drunk', 'tries', 'leave', 'charge', 'taxi', 'driver', 'way', 'Fate', 'designed', 'Joe', 'Guardian', 'Angel', 'Next', 'morning', 'Joe', 'discovers', 'who', 'really', 'tries', 'get', 'exclusive', 'photographer', 'telling', 'Ann', 'who', 'are.From', 'point', 'joyful', 'Roman', 'Cavalcade', 'Trevi', 'Fountain', 'Coliseum', 'Roman', 'Forum', 'picturesque', 'street', 'market', 'crazy', 'motorcycle', 'ride', 'Police', 'Station', 'finally', 'ball', 'ship', 'fist', 'fight', 'included.Voila', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'real', 'Angel', 'floating', 'Rome', 'exact', 'balance', 'character', 'will', 'indelibly', 'remain', 'spectator', 'mind', 'heart.She', 'won', 'only', 'Oscar', 'performance.Gregory', 'Peck', 'marvelous', 'delivering', 'unusual', 'romantic', 'personage.Special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'beautiful', 'B', 'W', 'photography', 'charge', 'two', 'European', 'cinematographers', 'Henri', 'Alekan', 'also', 'responsible', 'Battle', 'Rail', '1946', 'Franz', 'Planer', '150', 'films', '1920-1962', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'film.For', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'compare', 'present', 'view', 'Rome', 'one', 'given', 'Fellini', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', '1960', '.Film', 'lovers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'gem', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

Well, the main character is Ann (Audrey Hepburn), a beautiful princess that is visiting Rome for official reasons, but that wants to break free of her obligations, at least for one day. This movie tells us what happens when Ann gets to do what she wants, that is a day of almost perfect freedom in Rome. Of course, Ann is not alone: she accidentally meets an American journalist, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a handsome rogue that becomes a possible love interest. But does Joe know who Ann really is? And what does he want from her?All in all, I can say that I enjoyed watching the story of Princess Ann, a young woman that could be compared to a bird trying to spread her wings for the very first time.

I slept barely 3 1/2 hours before going to work, but it was worth it and I would do it again if I had to just because this movie is that good. Fortunately I won't have to do that again as that very monday after seeing it for the first time I ordered the DVD to watch it without TV ads.This is classical cinema the way Hollywood used to make its movies: we have a great cast, a charming story, chemistry between Peck and Hepburn and one of the greatest endings ever made on a romantic comedy, all set in a beautiful city as Rome.Hepburn is a princess who is sick and tired of his life style. She wants freedom, freedom to talk to normal people, to walk on the streets, to choose her haircut, freedom to live at least a few moments as she wants to (by the way, the mexican translation of the movie title is something like ""The Princess that wanted to live life"", wich summarize pretty much what this story is about).She escapes from his country's embassy after she takes some medication to help her sleep and on the street she is found sleeping by Gregory Peck, who takes care of her. Peck is a journalist and when he sees on the newspaper the picture of the princess (who is supposed to be sick, according to the embassy) he will try to get an exclusive note on the princess during her juorney trough Rome.We all know what's going to happen between them as this movie doesn't have the most innovative plot in history. What makes this a classic is the chemistry between Peck and Hepburn, the jokes (some of them silly) and the sense of joy seen on Hepburn as she discovers Rome, which makes more beliavable her character (she won the Oscar for that role).As some user noted before, this movie has a little plot twist at the end. This is a coda, a perfect finale. We see a dream come true, but at the end all the characters wake up from their dreams and come back to reality. That's what sets Roman Holiday appart from other cinderella-like stories. I have seen better movies, but none of them is as enjoyable as Roman Holiday.

All she longs to do is live a few moments without being poked, prodded, dressed or directed. One night while on tour in Rome she slinks away in the wee hours to have some fun as someone else.Audrey Hepburn is simply divine as the princess who is so tired she can't sleep and Gregory Peck is dashing as the young reporter who shows her a good time on the town.The film is black and white but it doesn't matter because Hepburn is so captivating you quickly forget. The princess now going by the name Anya wanders around Rome experiencing the people, culture and sites. She also chops off her hair, tries some ice-cream and gets involved in some roughhousing.Reporter, Joe Bradley encourages her to take some time for herself, all the time pretending he doesn't know who she really is; with the intention of getting a personal story for his employer. But of course he begins to regret his underhandedness.Roman Holiday doesn't have your typical boy meets girl (or vice versa) and lives happily ever after romantic ending, which I was expecting, but it is not disappointing.

218180,A3L46ZRKNFN0SG,6300215717,Michael W. Howe,"[17, 21]","One night on a whim, I checked out 3 films: L.A. Confidential, Roman Holiday &amp; Pulp fiction.  The strangest surprise I got when I watched LA Confidential, was seeing a clip of Roman Holiday playing in a movie theater, and in awe by the coincidental checkout I had made.  This film stands as a one of the better film romances I have seen in a long time.  Much better than most films released today.At the onset of our story, we find Princess Ann(Audrey Hepburn) fed up with her non-stop tour of Europe, doing nothing more than meeting with other dignitaries,  sticking to an all-work schedule, and almost no time to herself.  One evening, fed up with her tiresome regiment, she escapes from her country's Roman Embassy, and sets out into the city.  Soon after, she is discovered sleeping on a bench by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a member of the US News Service.  Because she's too tired to tell him where she lives, Joe takes her home, and the next day realizes that she is Princess Ann.  however, Ann is reluctant to reveal this, and Joe plays along with her game, hoping to get a story out of it.  He is soon accompanied by his friend  Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), who is there to help bring photographs to the story (but without Ann knowing).  Their escapades take them from the busy streets, to scenic Roman tourist sites, and onto a barge for a nightly dance.  But as the day wears on, the Princess and Joe soon find that secretly they have been falling in love.This story's romance plotline works so well, because it's not something as predictable as say, &quot;You've Got Mail.&quot;  There are no real romantic longings between these characters, just several instances of a mutual friendship, which of course is the basis for romance in my book.The film was shot entirely on locations in Rome, with the exception of several indoor set pieces.  What's amazing is the amount of time and patience it took to make this movie, but it's small pennies considering a project director William Wyler would tackle in later years: directing the epic Ben-Hur.As for casting, almost everyone has said it best: Audrey Hepburn was the best candidate for  Princess Ann.  Her portrayal of Ann as a young woman who is torn by her duties and yet yearns to do normal things (go to sidewalk cafes, wear pajamas, and so on), is so succinct that we believe her.  Gregory Peck was not the first choice, but after watching him in this film, I can't picture anyone else doing a better Joe Bradley for the film.  He has that seriousness yet sympathetic nature that reminds me in some ways of Harrison Ford.  Eddie Albert as Irving the photographer has some of the most incredibly funny moments in the film.  I won't give any away, because you have to see them for yourself.As a film student, there are several technical problems, such as sound fazing, quick cuts that seem to puzzle the eye and so forth, but the story makes up for this.This film was nominated for 10 Oscars in it's day, winning 3: Best Actress (Hepburn), Best Costume, and Best Motion Picture Story.The one thing I am most displeased with about this film, has to do with Paramount Pictures.  Out of numerous films they've released featuring Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday has yet to see an imprint on a DVD disc.  This seems hard to believe, considering this was Hepburn's major debut, her first Oscar win, and yete a romance story that should be seen and heard in this age we live in today.  I can't stress this enough, but if you want to watch a relaxing film, Roman Holiday is just right.",5,"A wonderful story, so where's it's DVD?",1003795200,"10 23, 2001",2001,3545,"['One', 'night', 'whim', 'checked', 'out', '3', 'films', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'amp', 'Pulp', 'fiction', 'strangest', 'surprise', 'got', 'when', 'watched', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'was', 'seeing', 'clip', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'playing', 'movie', 'theater', 'awe', 'coincidental', 'checkout', 'had', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'film', 'romances', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Much', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'released', 'onset', 'story', 'find', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'fed', 'up', 'non-stop', 'tour', 'Europe', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'meeting', 'other', 'dignitaries', 'sticking', 'all-work', 'schedule', 'almost', 'time', 'herself', 'One', 'evening', 'fed', 'up', 'tiresome', 'regiment', 'country', 'Roman', 'Embassy', 'out', 'city', 'Soon', 'discovered', 'sleeping', 'bench', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'member', 'US', 'News', 'Service', 'too', 'tired', 'tell', 'where', 'Joe', 'home', 'next', 'day', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'however', 'Ann', 'reluctant', 'reveal', 'Joe', 'along', 'game', 'hoping', 'get', 'story', 'soon', 'accompanied', 'friend', 'Irving', 'Radovich', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'who', 'there', 'help', 'bring', 'photographs', 'story', 'Ann', 'knowing', 'escapades', 'take', 'busy', 'streets', 'scenic', 'Roman', 'tourist', 'sites', 'barge', 'nightly', 'dance', 'day', 'Princess', 'Joe', 'soon', 'find', 'secretly', 'have', 'been', 'falling', 'love.This', 'story', 'romance', 'plotline', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'something', 'as', 'predictable', 'say', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail.', 'quot', 'are', 'real', 'romantic', 'longings', 'characters', 'just', 'several', 'instances', 'mutual', 'friendship', 'course', 'basis', 'romance', 'book.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'locations', 'Rome', 'exception', 'several', 'indoor', 'set', 'pieces', 'What', 'amazing', 'amount', 'time', 'patience', 'took', 'make', 'movie', 'small', 'pennies', 'considering', 'project', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'would', 'tackle', 'later', 'years', 'directing', 'epic', 'Ben-Hur.As', 'casting', 'almost', 'everyone', 'said', 'best', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'best', 'candidate', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'portrayal', 'Ann', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'torn', 'duties', 'yet', 'yearns', 'do', 'normal', 'things', 'go', 'sidewalk', 'cafes', 'wear', 'pajamas', 'so', 'so', 'succinct', 'believe', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'watching', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'anyone', 'else', 'doing', 'better', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'film', 'seriousness', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'nature', 'ways', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Irving', 'photographer', 'most', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'have', 'see', 'yourself.As', 'film', 'student', 'are', 'several', 'technical', 'problems', 'such', 'sound', 'fazing', 'quick', 'cuts', 'seem', 'puzzle', 'eye', 'so', 'forth', 'story', 'up', 'this.This', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '10', 'Oscars', 'day', 'winning', '3', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Hepburn', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Story.The', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'most', 'displeased', 'film', 'do', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'Out', 'numerous', 'films', ""'ve"", 'released', 'featuring', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'yet', 'see', 'imprint', 'DVD', 'disc', 'hard', 'believe', 'considering', 'was', 'Hepburn', 'major', 'debut', 'first', 'Oscar', 'win', 'yete', 'romance', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'age', 'live', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'want', 'watch', 'relaxing', 'film', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'just', 'right']",N/A

In her later years she became a goodwill ambassador for Unicef. She continued her charitable duties until she died.This movie was the first starring role for the fabulous Audrey Hepburn. Her performance was sparkly, radiant, spontaneous and magical. Obviously the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences agreed, as Audrey won an academy award for her performance in this movie.In a nutshell this story is about a princess who feels unfullfilled and ""stressed-out"" with her life. While in Rome she decides to leave the castle to explore Rome on her own. Before she leaves however, her doctor gives her a sedative to calm her down. When the princess leaves the castle it appears as though she is drunk. That is how Gregory Pecks character first sees her. In the beginning he is not aware that Audreys character is the princess. He will eventually figure it out.There are a multitude of adventures that occur, and there are so many magical scenes in this movie it would be impossible to name them all. I will name a couple of my favorite scenes though. I LOVE the scene when Audrey and Gregory are at the docks dancing, and a fight breaks out. In the chaos that ensues, Audrey smashes a guitar over the head of one of the party-goers. She grins with delight. I also enjoy the scene where Audrey and Gregory are tempting the fates with the ""Mouth of truth"" statue that bites off the hands of those who are telling a lie. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I still tense up at that scene to see if her hand will be bitten or not.This movie is such a classic, and with a less talented cast the movie could have come across as a bit cheesy. But with the spectacular talents of Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn and Eddie Albert, this movie was and is one of the greatest movies in Hollywood history.

218196,A2A1XYSB692L6J,6300215717,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","ROMAN HOLIDAY is a spectacularly romantic, wonderfully well-acted movie.  It is styled a ""comedy"", but could also be a styled a tragedy.It is the story of Princess Ann, (AUDREY HEPBURN), from an un-named European country, (always called ""her country"" in the movie), who finds her duties boring and irksome in the extreme.  (The beginning scenes, wherein the Princess loses her shoe, and is forced to dance with perhaps the most boring selection of fictional diplomats ever assembled for any movie -- are priceless!) Finally, in the early evening hours, she finds a way to sneak out of her country's embassy, (where she is sting during a good will visit to Rome), and see the ""real"" world.....A naive, (but intelligent) Princess, finding her way into the ""real"" world for the first time, could have wound up in a lot of trouble.  She had no money with her, (royalty never carries money -- leaving that to underlings to do), and to top things off, she had been given a sleeping potion, the delayed action of which starts to work just as she hops off the truck that took her out of the embassy, and finds a seat near a Roman fountain.  Kidnapping, white slavery, ransom holding....any number of terrible things might have come to the runaway princes -- but, (luckily!), she is found by American newsman-in-Rome, Joe Bradley, (GREGORY PECK), who, after some deliberation, takes her to his small apartment to shelter for the night.  Joe is preplexed by this beautiful girl's seeming contradictions, (she is well-dressed, well-educated -- yet he found her on the streets alone).  Later, going to his boss, he discovers, (from a newspaper story of the Princess's sudden ""illness"" -- and the photo that accompanies it), that the girl he has found is actualy the ""ill"" princess, (the ""illness"" obviously being a cover story, to explain her disappearance from a group interview she was supposed to give the press earlier in the day.)  Smelling an exclusive -- and a way to get out of Rome, and back to where he wants to be, (New York City), Joe calls up his photographer-friend, Irving Radovitch, (EDDIE ALBERT), and the two of them make plans for ""the story of the year"" -- if not the decade, about the REAL Princess Ann, disclosing her innermost secrets and desires.....The princess meets Joe's rather insensed landlady, a kindly barber, some street vendors, dances at a local festival -- and has a fateful meeting with some ""men in black"" from her country.  As these events go on, she and Joe find they are beginning to care very much for each other.........Cary Grant was orignally supposed to play the part of Joe Bradley, and many people seem to think he would have been perfect for it.  I must strongly disagree.  Mr. Grant -- whatever type of person he was in real life -- had a screen persona of the very slightest rakish kind.  Gregory Peck, however, had a screen persona of, (usually), total and complete integrity -- and I feel that this is what was needed in the role of Joe Bradley, a newspaperman longing to go back home, desperately needing the funds to do so, but who finds that he simply cannot do so, for to earn this money, he would have to betray the woman he has come to love, and love very much....  For me, Gregory Peck -- later the sterling ""Atticus Finch"" of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', and the stalwart hero of so many other films -- fit the role of 'Joe Bradley', to a tee.  A role-model for all men to look up to, (and all women to swoon over! -- sigh!)It is said that this movie was inspired by the tragic Princess Margaret-Peter Townsend affair.  Also, it is said that this moviewas John F. Kennedy's favourite film, and it is easy to see why.  His first true love was the beautiful actress, GENE TIERNEY.  As both were rich, beautiful, and Catholic, one would think it would be a match of which both families would approve.  Unhappily, Ms. Tierney's family, (very conservative French Catholics), did not think that Mr. Kennedy, (Irish-Catholic), was good enough for her (!), and so they had to part.  In a much later interview, (near the end of her life), on the Phil Donahue show, Ms. Hepburn was asked which of her movies was her favourite.  ""Roman Holiday"", she said without hesitation, and the audience seemed to agree with her.  This exchange was edited out of the later showings of this program -- and I cannot think why. ""Roman Holiday"" WAS Audrey Hepburn at her luminous, and most beautiful best.  One could say she was BORN to play this role, as she was, in actuality, the daughter of a Belgian baroness.  Many, many  people agree that this is Audrey Hepburn's best movie.

He woos her, snaps photos, and intends to publish and get famous, because of course she doesn't know who he is and acts completely natural - not regally royal. But then, well, he really falls for her. And finally, of course, she has to go back to the palace, where she holds an audience for the press - and there he is, her partner in crime who holds the power to ruin her.It's terrific.

Princess Audrey losing a slipper; Greg and Audrey on a scooter in Rome; Audrey bashing the guy with the guitar; Greg and Audrey at the end, back to Royal and Commoner; and surely - courtesy of ""Only You"" and Robert Downey's fine recreation with Marisa Tomei - the dare to risk hands being bitten off when put by the untruthful into the Bocca della Verita (Mouth of Truth) and Audrey's wild, coltish reaction to Greg's silly amputation mime (hand retracted into sleeve on extraction from the Mouth). These images have long since been absorbed into most people's cinematic vocabulary of the timeless and delightful: quite rightly so. Some of us have even been in the Eternal City on a fast-paced weekend break and still found time for furtive indulgence in a bit of our own movie-recreation magic, down at La Bocca with a camera on timer...But come back, please, to this lovely film and you will find something that's more than the sum of admittedly exquisite parts. Dalton Trumbo wrote this under a Black-List-dodging cover, for a start; couple this with Director William Wyler's known insistence for precision-engineered scripting and you know you're going to be presented with a beautifully-shaped and paced experience. The casting is - of course - pitch-perfect, with Audrey justifying the latter iconics (which I've often considered a bit overdone in relation to her overall contribution) with a tremendous portrait of her character's initially innocent, fragmented, wrenched character, the evolution over the course of her self-discovering ""holiday"" and, most poignantly, the mature and genuinely regal way she conducts herself at the end.The film looks wonderful, naturally; location-work in Rome throughout will tend to do that for your movie. But you may not remember just how erotic the wet, underlit kiss on the Tiber's night-time banks really is until you come back. Or how funny the recurring shtick with Eddie Albert's bohemian photographer is. Or how spot-on the satire of the paparazzi is, for then and now. Edith Head does one of her finest fashion-jobs ever in this: not just Audrey, but all of them are dressed to perfection for their characters and their developments. Even the damned haircut is perfect!""Tragi-comic"" is partly right for the final impact of the story. It's ultimately very uplifting, though, in both theme and structure. Both Audrey and Greg gain something permanent and perfect, even as they retire to their respective sides of the rope barrier. And how lovely that, in so articulate a film, the script calls for them to convey the final truths they've learned, what they've lost - and what they (and we) will have with us to enjoy forever - all of this is brought to life without words, in the looks they share at the end, Greg and Audrey acting their hearts out from their stillness whilst the state occasion goes on around them. The implied confidence in Greg's public question and Audrey's response near the start of the scene, along with the covert handing back by the cheeky reporter and snapper of the candid photographs taken on Audrey's incognito escapades, constitute some of the least cynical and most generous gestures ever realised on film - everybody finds nobility at the end.What a sweet and redeeming masterpiece this is! It's one of those films I'd cheerfully go and inhabit. Early on, Greg takes a ""drunken"" (actually drugged) Audrey up the outside courtyard stairs to his Rome apartment. In the night-light, she sways back to knock someone's door, just down a short flight from Greg's entrance; but he catches her hand (you should watch hands throughout this film) just before she can smack the door, twirling her up and away with comic grace, as if they're dancing. Well, I want to be the person who lives behind that door.",5,"Eternal City, Eternal Film",1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,3886,"['difficult', 'not', 'have', 'least', 'possibly', 'subliminal', 'awareness', 'classic', 'imagery', 'Princess', 'Audrey', 'losing', 'slipper', 'Greg', 'Audrey', 'scooter', 'Rome', 'Audrey', 'bashing', 'guy', 'guitar', 'Greg', 'Audrey', 'end', 'back', 'Royal', 'Commoner', 'surely', 'courtesy', 'Only', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'fine', 'recreation', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'dare', 'risk', 'hands', 'being', 'bitten', 'off', 'when', 'put', 'untruthful', 'Bocca', 'della', 'Verita', 'Mouth', 'Truth', 'Audrey', 'wild', 'coltish', 'reaction', 'Greg', 'silly', 'amputation', 'mime', 'hand', 'retracted', 'sleeve', 'extraction', 'Mouth', 'images', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'absorbed', 'most', 'people', 'cinematic', 'vocabulary', 'timeless', 'delightful', 'quite', 'rightly', 'so', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'Eternal', 'City', 'fast-paced', 'weekend', 'break', 'still', 'found', 'time', 'furtive', 'indulgence', 'bit', 'own', 'movie-recreation', 'magic', 'down', 'La', 'Bocca', 'camera', 'timer', 'come', 'back', 'please', 'lovely', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'sum', 'admittedly', 'exquisite', 'parts', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'wrote', 'Black-List-dodging', 'cover', 'start', 'couple', 'Director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'known', 'insistence', 'precision-engineered', 'scripting', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'presented', 'beautifully-shaped', 'paced', 'experience', 'casting', 'course', 'pitch-perfect', 'Audrey', 'justifying', 'latter', 'iconics', ""'ve"", 'often', 'considered', 'bit', 'overdone', 'relation', 'overall', 'contribution', 'tremendous', 'portrait', 'character', 'initially', 'innocent', 'fragmented', 'wrenched', 'character', 'evolution', 'course', 'self-discovering', 'holiday', 'most', 'poignantly', 'mature', 'genuinely', 'regal', 'way', 'end.The', 'film', 'wonderful', 'naturally', 'location-work', 'Rome', 'will', 'tend', 'do', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'just', 'how', 'erotic', 'wet', 'underlit', 'kiss', 'Tiber', 'night-time', 'banks', 'really', 'come', 'back', 'how', 'funny', 'recurring', 'shtick', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'bohemian', 'photographer', 'how', 'spot-on', 'satire', 'paparazzi', 'then', 'now', 'Edith', 'Head', 'one', 'finest', 'fashion-jobs', 'ever', 'not', 'just', 'Audrey', 'are', 'dressed', 'perfection', 'characters', 'developments', 'Even', 'damned', 'haircut', 'perfect', 'Tragi-comic', 'partly', 'right', 'final', 'impact', 'story', 'ultimately', 'very', 'uplifting', 'though', 'theme', 'structure', 'Audrey', 'Greg', 'gain', 'something', 'permanent', 'perfect', 'even', 'retire', 'respective', 'sides', 'rope', 'barrier', 'how', 'lovely', 'so', 'articulate', 'film', 'script', 'convey', 'final', 'truths', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'what', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'what', 'will', 'have', 'enjoy', 'forever', 'brought', 'life', 'words', 'looks', 'share', 'end', 'Greg', 'Audrey', 'acting', 'hearts', 'stillness', 'state', 'occasion', 'implied', 'confidence', 'Greg', 'public', 'question', 'Audrey', 'response', 'start', 'scene', 'covert', 'handing', 'back', 'cheeky', 'reporter', 'snapper', 'candid', 'photographs', 'taken', 'Audrey', 'incognito', 'escapades', 'constitute', 'least', 'cynical', 'most', 'generous', 'gestures', 'ever', 'realised', 'film', 'everybody', 'nobility', 'end.What', 'sweet', 'redeeming', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'films', ""'d"", 'cheerfully', 'go', 'inhabit', 'Early', 'Greg', 'drunken', 'actually', 'drugged', 'Audrey', 'outside', 'courtyard', 'stairs', 'Rome', 'apartment', 'night-light', 'back', 'knock', 'someone', 'door', 'just', 'down', 'short', 'flight', 'Greg', 'entrance', 'hand', 'should', 'watch', 'hands', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'smack', 'door', 'twirling', 'up', 'away', 'comic', 'grace', ""'re"", 'dancing', 'Well', 'want', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'door']",N/A

On the night of her visit to Rome, having disconnected from the real world for long, she slips away from her residence. During this little adventure she meets an American news reporter named Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck.) Audrey Hepburn offers great performance as a nave young woman who wants to be a common person away from the pageantry she is used to. It is a sheer luck that Hepburn was cast for this role. After she auditioned for the movie, a brief chat with director William Wyler convinced him that she is the best for the job. No one has ever regretted this decision as Hepburn went on to win the Academy award. Hepburn is a natural, and remains at ease in her portrayal as a princess enjoying the real world. No wonder Academy awarded the biggest prize in Hollywood even though she was novice to a Hollywood film and this is her first movie.  Originally Cary Grant was offered the lead role but casting Gregory Peck was not the best decision one could have made. Peck has made great movies but he does not shine in this film. Shooting of the film in and around Italy adds depth to the story of movie. The princess taking a ride with Bradley in a Vespa motor scooter is an iconic symbol of American cinema. Anyone who has seen the other movie of Hepburn; Breakfast at Tiffany's could see some similarities in the story of these two films as she play a free spirited woman who doesn't know what she really wants in life.

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","I knew very little about ""Roman Holiday"" when I settled down to watch it, beyond knowing that it starred Audrey Hepburn, involved a Vespa, and was considered one of the great love stories in cinematic history. I was definitely in for a treat as I watched the story unfold, for although the basic premise of ""royalty incognito"" is hardly unique, ""Roman Holiday"" still holds up today as an incredibly charming, memorable and bittersweet love story.Audrey Hepburn plays Princess Anne of Unspecified Country, on a whirlwind goodwill tour around Europe. By the time she reaches Rome, Anne is feeling stifled by the endless schedules that dictate every moment of her life, and finally cracks under the pressure. Administered a sedative by the doctor, Anne waits until she's alone before escaping from the embassy grounds, only to find herself alone and doped up on the streets of Rome.Meanwhile, journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) wanders home from a poker match to find Anne muttering incoherently on a bench. Unable to get an address out of her, he eventually takes her home to his apartment. Like a perfect gentleman (well, maybe not a *perfect* gentleman - he rolls her onto a couch so that he can keep the bed for himself) lets her sleep off what he thinks is drunkenness. By the next day Anne has recovered, and Joe has recognized her as the Princess Anne. Realizing that he has the scoop of his lifetime, he contacts his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) and convinces Anne to take the day off with him in Rome.What follows is a magical day in the Eternal City, but as the hours lengthen so too does the couple's realization that their separation is imminent. Though most of the film is an unashamed romantic-comedy involving subterfuge, haircuts, dancing, street brawls, pranks (Anne's reaction to Joe's missing hand at the Mouth of Truth was genuine; Peck hadn't told Hepburn what he was going to do) and of course the famous Vespa ride, it all builds toward a bittersweet conclusion that cements the movie's reputation as a genuine tear-jerker.Audrey Hepburn is elegant and wide-eyed, poised and beguiling as Anne, the role that won her an Oscar and catapulted her into stardom. Though she had featured in a few films prior to this, ""Roman Holiday"" was her first starring role, and it was on Gregory Peck's insistence that her name be elevated alongside his for the promotional material. As Joe Bradley, Peck takes a backseat to Hepburn (though he *owns* the final scene), whose role is mainly to provide Anne with a safe chaperone with which to see the city. Eddie Albert has the final major role as Joe's hapless photographer, stumbling through a number of pratfalls as his college tries to keep him from giving too much away.At the time (1953), location shooting was rare, leading to a disclaimer at the start of the film as to the veracity of the shots. Director William Wyler used places like the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the Bocca della Verita (""Mouth of Truth"") to excellent effect in demonstrating the scope and atmosphere of Rome. Also worth noting is that though the screenwriting credit goes to Ian McLellan Hunter, it was actually Dalton Trumbo who penned the script. Hunter fronted for him after Trumbo was blacklisted, and his name has only recently been reinstated to the credits on these DVD releases.At times, the film shows its age. The portrayal of Italians is inevitably stereotypical (though positive), and the romance between Anne and the significantly older Joe has a paternal quality to it. Joe often comes across as quite fatherly toward Anne, not helped by the fact that her cover story is that she's a runaway schoolgirl. But in saying that, there are some rather surprising implications at work. Contemporary viewers often assume that old films are free of innuendo or sexual content - yet here we see that the first thing Anne does on waking up in Joe's apartment is to worriedly check that she's wearing pajama bottoms whilst Joe innocently asks: ""did you lose something?"" Later Joe is acutely aware of the conclusions that his landlord is jumping to when he's seen giving Anne some money.Still, it's all fairly innocuous, and it made me wonder what ""Roman Holiday"" would be like if it was filmed today. Anne would be a bratty teenager who lashes out at her chaperones, and Joe would be an ambitious reporter who ruthlessly exploits her. They would undoubtedly sleep together and Anne would wake up in the morning to discover that Joe was a reporter, leading to a screaming argument, a desperate attempt on Joe's behalf to make amends (no doubt involving a chase scene on a Vespa through the busy streets after her entourage), and a saccharine ""fairytale"" ending that would allow the couple to be together no matter how preposterous the circumstances.They just don't make them like they used to, and it continues to amaze me that compared with today's standards, the romantic-comedies of old manage to be both more innocent and more sophisticated than the rubbish that gets churned out these days.Ultimately, ""Roman Holiday"" is about two things: love, which manages to be both ephemeral and immortal, contained forever in the secret memory of one perfect day, and the growth from a girl to a woman - the Anne at the end of the film is far more assertive and in control, and for the first time you can see as the future Queen of Unspecified Country.",5,"""So Happy...""",1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,5445,"['knew', 'very', 'little', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'when', 'settled', 'down', 'watch', 'knowing', 'starred', 'Audrey',

218209,A16QODENBJVUI1,6300215717,Robert Moore,"[9, 10]","ROMAN HOLIDAY is without any question one of the greatest Romantic fantasies in the history of film. The story of a European princess who manages to escape her handlers and experience a single day living as a normal, everyday things-managing to fall in love with someone with whom her position forbade her to have a relationship with-could have been trite in the hands of less perfect performers. It is hard to imagine any actress who could have been more convincing as royalty, yet more adorable while living one day as a comparable nobody. When she leaves Gregory Peck near the end of the film to return to her royal duties, your heart breaks for her, and her resumption of her royal role feels as self-sacrificial and heroic as any act of bravery one can imagine.Audrey Hepburn single handedly makes this a great film, with some great assists. She is completely irresistible. A member of royalty sneaking away to enjoy a day with the common people is much harder to pull off than one might imagine, and it would have been quite simple to have made of this film something that was silly and unwatchable. But from the moment we first see Audrey Hepburn lose her shoe while surreptitiously attempting to scratch her ankle with her foot, our heart and our sympathy belongs to her. Just as Joe (Gregory Peck's character) does later, we want to protect her and comfort her, and allow her to enjoy the joys of life that her position in life has denied her. This was not her first film, but it was major role, and it has to count as one of the great major screen debuts in film history, rivaling that of James Dean in EAST OF EDEN.While absolutely no one can question the perfection of Audrey Hepburn starring in this film, I have always been surprised at the criticism of Gregory Peck in his role. While I will grant that Cary Grant might have been slightly better in the role (but, then, how many movies would that not have been true of?), I still find Peck's performance to be excellent. Moreover, without casting Gregory Peck, the film would have lost the most famous scene, where Peck pretends to lose his hand in the mouth of the carving in the wall. That was not in the script, and everyone agrees that he adlibbed it on the spot. Hepburn's startled reaction was more believable because she was genuinely shocked. There is a third star as well: the city of Rome. I know of no film in which Rome looks more enchanting and more magical. Many films portray Paris in alluring fashion, but this is the great film about Rome.The original story was by Dalton Trumbo, who was in 1953 on the Hollywood Blacklist for refusing to name names and for his leftist politics, so the story credit is given to Ian McLellan Hunter, who fronted for Trumbo. Hunter won the Oscar for Best Writing for a Motion Picture Story. Trumbo also won an Oscar for THE BRAVE ONE writing under the fake name Robert Rich.",5,One of the screen's great romantic comedies,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,2888,"['ROMAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'question', 'one', 'greatest', 'Romantic', 'fantasies', 'history', 'film', 'story', 'European', 'princess', 'who', 'escape', 'handlers', 'experience', 'single', 'day', 'living', 'normal', 'everyday', 'things-managing', 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'whom', 'position', 'forbade', 'have', 'relationship', 'have', 'been', 'trite', 'hands', 'less', 'perfect', 'performers', 'hard', 'imagine', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing', 'royalty', 'yet', 'more', 'adorable', 'living', 'one', 'day', 'comparable', 'nobody', 'When', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'end', 'film', 'return', 'royal', 'duties', 'heart', 'breaks', 'resumption', 'royal', 'role', 'feels', 'self-sacrificial', 'heroic', 'act', 'bravery', 'one', 'can', 'imagine.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'single', 'handedly', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'assists', 'completely', 'irresistible', 'member', 'royalty', 'sneaking', 'away', 'enjoy', 'day', 'common', 'people', 'much', 'harder', 'pull', 'off', 'one', 'might', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'simple', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'something', 'was', 'silly', 'unwatchable', 'moment', 'first', 'see', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'lose', 'shoe', 'surreptitiously', 'attempting', 'scratch', 'ankle', 'foot', 'heart', 'sympathy', 'belongs', 'Just', 'Joe', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'character', 'later', 'want', 'protect', 'comfort', 'allow', 'enjoy', 'joys', 'life', 'position', 'life', 'denied', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'role', 'count', 'one', 'great', 'major', 'screen', 'debuts', 'film', 'history', 'rivaling', 'James', 'Dean', 'EAST', 'OF', 'EDEN.While', 'absolutely', 'one', 'can', 'question', 'perfection', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'starring', 'film', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'surprised', 'criticism', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'role', 'will', 'grant', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'better', 'role', 'then', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'still', 'find', 'Peck', 'performance', 'be', 'excellent', 'Moreover', 'casting', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'most', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Peck', 'lose', 'hand', 'mouth', 'carving', 'wall', 'was', 'not', 'script', 'everyone', 'adlibbed', 'spot', 'Hepburn', 'startled', 'reaction', 'was', 'more', 'believable', 'was', 'genuinely', 'shocked', 'third', 'star', 'well', 'city', 'Rome', 'know', 'film', 'Rome', 'more', 'enchanting', 'more', 'magical', 'Many', 'films', 'portray', 'Paris', 'alluring', 'fashion', 'great', 'film', 'Rome.The', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'who', 'was', '1953', 'Hollywood', 'Blacklist', 'refusing', 'name', 'names', 'leftist', 'politics', 'story', 'credit', 'given', 'Ian', 'McLellan', 'Hunter', 'who', 'fronted', 'Trumbo', 'Hunter', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Story', 'Trumbo', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'THE', 'BRAVE', 'ONE', 'writing', 'fake', 'name', 'Robert', 'Rich']",N/A
218210,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6300215717,Robert Morris,"[3, 4]","This film has lost none of its charm since it was first released more than 50 years ago. Audrey Hepburn's performance as Princess Anne earned her an Academy Award for best actress in a leading role. If metropolitan areas were also eligible, Rome would have provided her strongest competition; in no other film has it looked lovelier. Director William Wyler brilliantly coordinates Hepburn's performance with those of Gregory Peck (Joe Bradley. a journalist) and Eddie Albert (Irving Radovich, a photographer). There really is not much to the plot.While visiting Rome, a beautiful young princess decides to take a holiday from her royal obligations. Of course, she sneaks out of her mansion one evening dressed casually, has too much to drink, is ""rescued"" from any possible trouble by a journalist (Peck) who does not at first recognize her, briefly explores the city under his supervision, and then returns to her royal obligations. And of course, the journalist falls in love with her. For that reason, he decides not to take advantage of her to produce with his associate (Albert) an exclusive feature story with numerous photographs of her roman holiday. On and off the screen, there was mutual respect and affection between Peck and Hepburn. Provided with an Academy Award-winning screenplay (co-authored by Ian McLellan Hunter, John Dichton, and Dalton Trumbo) and under Wyler's direction, they create a unique form of magic together in this film which is as much a holiday in Rome for the viewer as it is for the young princess.I am reluctant to call it a ""romp"" because of its style, grace, and wit but it certainly has a number of playful moments. The final sequence, Princess Anne's press conference, is presented with exquisite taste, especially when she and Bradley reluctantly bid each other an obviously fond but necessary farewell. I hasten to add that, in my opinion, Eddie Albert's talents as a versatile actor have never really received the recognition and appreciation they and he deserve. (He is outstanding as Captain Erskine Cooney in Attack!, as Mr. Corcoran in The Heartbreak Kid, and as Warden Hazen in The Longest Yard.)  I cannot think of another actor better suited for the role of Irving Radovich. Others in the supporting cast are also first-rate but the dominant images are of Hepburn and Rome, as well they should be.",5,A Holiday in Rome for All Who See This Delightful Film,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,2349,"['film', 'lost', 'none', 'charm', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'more', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'performance', 'Princess', 'Anne', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'leading', 'role', 'metropolitan', 'areas', 'were', 'also', 'eligible', 'Rome', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'strongest', 'competition', 'other', 'film', 'looked', 'lovelier', 'Director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'brilliantly', 'Hepburn', 'performance', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'journalist', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Irving', 'Radovich', 'photographer', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'plot.While', 'visiting', 'Rome', 'beautiful', 'young', 'princess', 'take', 'holiday', 'royal', 'obligations', 'course', 'mansion', 'one', 'evening', 'dressed', 'casually', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'rescued', 'possible', 'trouble', 'journalist', 'Peck', 'who', 'not', 'first', 'recognize', 'briefly', 'city', 'supervision', 'then', 'returns', 'royal', 'obligations', 'course', 'journalist', 'love', 'reason', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'produce', 'associate', 'Albert', 'exclusive', 'feature', 'story', 'numerous', 'photographs', 'roman', 'holiday', 'screen', 'was', 'mutual', 'respect', 'affection', 'Peck', 'Hepburn', 'Provided', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'screenplay', 'co-authored', 'Ian', 'McLellan', 'Hunter', 'John', 'Dichton', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'Wyler', 'direction', 'create', 'unique', 'form', 'magic', 'together', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'holiday', 'Rome', 'viewer', 'young', 'princess.I', 'am', 'reluctant', 'call', 'romp', 'style', 'grace', 'wit', 'certainly', 'number', 'playful', 'moments', 'final', 'sequence', 'Princess', 'Anne', 'press', 'conference', 'presented', 'exquisite', 'taste', 'especially', 'when', 'Bradley', 'reluctantly', 'bid', 'other', 'obviously', 'fond', 'necessary', 'farewell', 'hasten', 'add', 'opinion', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'talents', 'versatile', 'actor', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'received', 'recognition', 'appreciation', 'deserve', 'outstanding', 'Captain', 'Erskine', 'Cooney', 'Attack', 'Mr.', 'Corcoran', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'Warden', 'Hazen', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'actor', 'better', 'suited', 'role', 'Irving', 'Radovich', 'Others', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'first-rate', 'dominant', 'images', 'are', 'Hepburn', 'Rome', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'be']",N/A

We see her on the loose for a single day in Rome smoking her ""very first"" cigarette, cutting her long black hair, riding on the back of a reporter's motor scooter, hesitating to slip her fragile hand in the 'mouth of truth,' escaping police, swimming the Tiber river, falling in love with the handsome reporter and at last returning to her official duties...Audrey Hepburn won the Academy Award, and nearly every film she made during the following fifteen years was worthwhile... She was good in epics as she was in musicals... She was nominated for additional Academy Awards for ""Sabrina,"" ""The Nun's Story,"" ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" and ""Wait Until Dark."" She had such expressive big eyes that she was hardly required to speak... She was a star of extravagant beauty and her part in ""Roman Holiday,"" (her first in a starring role) perfectly suitable for her wispy, thin little persona, haunted us by her looks and her voice..""Roman Holiday"" was directed by a serious artist who knows how to tell a story... Meticulous, William Wyler worked out several doubling that I like to mention:- Hepburn is seen dancing in the great mirrors of the hall, and soon after, in civilian dress, she walks alone passing near the same mirrors in the empty shadowy hall...- At the extravagant ball she dances with short old personalities, and next evening she dances with our hero the tall American reporter on a barge in the Tiber river...- When she lies persistent to sleep in her Embassy bed, she sees the angels in the four corners of the adorned ceiling, and when she wakes in Peck's bed, she observes the water tank in the corner of his ceiling...- She has her hair cut by a barber who begins unwilling to cut it, then with emotion cut it all off... In that night she meets the same barber who has shaved his moustache...They were two receptions in the film: Near the beginning our bored princess receives an official welcome... Near the end she holds a press conference... Among the gentlemen of the press is Peck affirming that the story of her day with him is safe... And Oscar Nominee Eddie Albert discreetly presents her with his 'paparazzi' commemorative photos of her visit...The 'go away' of two lovers who certify their tender feelings by not saying goodbye brings very pleasant tears...And there is a last doubling of Wyler: Late night after they kiss in the funny little borrowed car, Hepburn leaves and Peck watches her disappear down the narrow street as she runs the corner returning to the Embassy... The camera holds for a moment on the little street making its emptiness speak in silence... The next morning, after the press conference, and the princess with her attendants depart as all the reporters except Peck... He is left alone, looking fixedly at the door through which 'his beloved' has left... Then he turns... The camera - below him - retreats as he walks slowly down the elegant space of the palace hall... His footsteps producing an echo... At the great door he stops again, and turns one more time... Nobody there... The nice dream is over... He walks out of the shot leaving William Wyler's academic use of deep-focus detains his camera on the cool elegant hall with its guards and ceiling... It is the end of a lovely story, a fairy tale...With a captivating charisma, Hepburn ad Peck are delightful from start to finish...",4,Hepburn ad Peck are delightful from start to finish...,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,3682,"['William', 'Wyler', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'runaway', 'princess', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'escapes', 'surveillance', 'believing', 'incognito', 'night', 'perfectly', 'innocent-', 'good-natured', 'American', 'newsman', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'apartment', 'amiable', 'adventures', 'provide', 'basis', 'charming', 'fantasy-romance', 'adventure', 'see', 'loose', 'single', 'day', 'Rome', 'smoking', 'very', 'first', 'cigarette', 'cutting', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'riding', 'back', 'reporter', 'motor', 'scooter', 'hesitating', 'slip', 'fragile', 'hand', ""'mouth"", 'truth', 'escaping', 'police', 'swimming', 'Tiber', 'river', 'falling', 'love', 'handsome', 'reporter', 'last', 'returning', 'official', 'duties', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nearly', 'film', 'made', 'following', 'fifteen', 'years', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'good', 'epics', 'was', 'musicals', 'was', 'nominated', 'additional', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Sabrina', 'Nun', 'Story', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'had', 'such', 'expressive', 'big', 'eyes', 'was', 'hardly', 'required', 'speak', 'was', 'star', 'extravagant', 'beauty', 'part', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'wispy', 'thin', 'little', 'persona', 'haunted', 'looks', 'voice..', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'was', 'directed', 'serious', 'artist', 'who', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'Meticulous', 'William', 'Wyler', 'worked', 'out', 'several', 'doubling', 'like', 'mention', 'Hepburn', 'seen', 'dancing', 'great', 'mirrors', 'hall', 'soon', 'civilian', 'dress', 'walks', 'alone', 'passing', 'same', 'mirrors', 'empty', 'shadowy', 'hall', 'extravagant', 'ball', 'short', 'old', 'personalities', 'next', 'evening', 'hero', 'tall', 'American', 'reporter', 'barge', 'Tiber', 'river', 'When', 'persistent', 'sleep', 'Embassy', 'bed', 'angels', 'four', 'corners', 'adorned', 'ceiling', 'when', 'Peck', 'bed', 'water', 'tank', 'corner', 'ceiling', 'hair', 'cut', 'barber', 'who', 'unwilling', 'cut', 'then', 'emotion', 'cut', 'off', 'night', 'same', 'barber', 'who', 'shaved', 'moustache', 'were', 'two', 'receptions', 'film', 'beginning', 'bored', 'princess', 'official', 'welcome', 'end', 'press', 'conference', 'gentlemen', 'press', 'Peck', 'affirming', 'story', 'day', 'safe', 'Oscar', 'Nominee', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'discreetly', ""'paparazzi"", 'commemorative', 'photos', 'visit', ""'go"", 'away', ""'"", 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'certify', 'tender', 'feelings', 'not', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'brings', 'very', 'pleasant', 'tears', 'last', 'doubling', 'Wyler', 'Late', 'night', 'kiss', 'funny', 'little', 'borrowed', 'car', 'Hepburn', 'Peck', 'disappear', 'narrow', 'street', 'corner', 'returning', 'Embassy', 'camera', 'moment', 'little', 'street', 'making', 'emptiness', 'speak', 'silence', 'next', 'morning', 'press', 'conference', 'princess', 'attendants', 'depart', 'reporters', 'Peck', 'left', 'alone', 'looking', 'fixedly', 'door', ""'his"", 'beloved', 'left', 'Then', 'camera', 'retreats', 'slowly', 'down', 'elegant', 'space', 'palace', 'hall', 'footsteps', 'producing', 'echo', 'great', 'door', 'again', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Nobody', 'nice', 'dream', 'shot', 'leaving', 'William', 'Wyler', 'academic', 'use', 'deep-focus', 'detains', 'camera', 'cool', 'elegant', 'hall', 'guards', 'ceiling', 'end', 'lovely', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'captivating', 'charisma', 'Hepburn', 'ad', 'Peck', 'are', 'delightful', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

If that's really the case, it's hard to find any hidden agenda or subliminal political message in this timeless romance.Gregory Peck is an American journalist who, seeking an exclusive interview with Audrey Hepburn, a rebelling princess on the lam, pretends ignorance of her true identity when fate brings them together.  But Peck's plan falters as the two fall in love.The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar in this her first major role.

218217,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6300215717,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","Roman Holiday is a beautifully bittersweet romance starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck (originally, it was optioned by Frank Capra, who had hoped to cast Cary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor in the lead roles). Hepburn plays the spoiled Princess Ann, who is fed up with palace life and the endless protocol. After being given a sedative, she makes a run for it and ends up out cold on a park bench in Rome, where newspaper man Joe Bradley discovers her and begrudgingly takes her home with him, fearing for her safety.He quickly pieces together her formal, outdated manner of speaking and the disappearance of the princess (official reason: sudden illness), and his first inclination is to cash in on her secret identity by writing a tell-all story for $5000. He enlists his friend Irving as photographer. But as Joe indulges Ann's simple wishes for gelato, sightseeing, and a dash of adventure, he finds himself genuinely falling for Ann. The two engage in a complicated tango of avoidance; Joe hides the fact that he's press, and Ann tells him that she's run away from school. Irving uses a camera hidden in his lighter to snap impromptu photos. Poor Irving is tripped and spilled on by Joe in a none-too-subtle attempt to shut him up before he spills the beans on more than one occasion, and I felt bad for Irving's bewildered expression as Joe keeps taking him out.Pandemonium breaks out as the palace sends out secret police to retrieve Ann, and the film falls into near-slapstick in the final third at a barge dancehall. The ending is bittersweet yet appropriate, neither too much nor too little. Roman Holiday is a stunning vehicle for the luminous Audrey Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance, was the first comedy for Gregory Peck, and most of all, serves as a showcase for the timeless wonders of Rome. It was the first American film to be shot entirely in Italy (Paramount had frozen assets in Italy). Real Italian nobility and real international press corps were featured in the film. Most of the locations exist, and the colorful, authentic backgrounds and ethnic faces add a degree of authenticity that could never have been matched in a California studio.There are several extras including a documentary on the film's restoration, a stills gallery, and the original trailer. The transfer is crisp enough and looks fresh despite its age. Roman Holiday will appeal to fans of romance, comedy, and travelogues, and is a mesmerizing blend of all three elements.",5,A bittersweet romance and a beautiful travelogue of Rome,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2480,"['Roman', 'Holiday', 'beautifully', 'bittersweet', 'romance', 'starring', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'originally', 'was', 'optioned', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'who', 'had', 'hoped', 'cast', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'lead', 'roles', 'Hepburn', 'spoiled', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'palace', 'life', 'endless', 'protocol', 'being', 'given', 'sedative', 'run', 'up', 'out', 'cold', 'park', 'bench', 'Rome', 'where', 'newspaper', 'man', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'begrudgingly', 'home', 'fearing', 'safety.He', 'quickly', 'together', 'formal', 'outdated', 'manner', 'speaking', 'disappearance', 'princess', 'official', 'reason', 'sudden', 'illness', 'first', 'inclination', 'cash', 'secret', 'identity', 'writing', 'tell-all', 'story', '5000', 'friend', 'Irving', 'photographer', 'Joe', 'Ann', 'simple', 'wishes', 'gelato', 'sightseeing', 'dash', 'adventure', 'genuinely', 'falling', 'Ann', 'two', 'engage', 'complicated', 'tango', 'avoidance', 'Joe', 'fact', 'press', 'Ann', 'run', 'away', 'school', 'Irving', 'camera', 'hidden', 'lighter', 'snap', 'impromptu', 'photos', 'Poor', 'Irving', 'tripped', 'spilled', 'Joe', 'none-too-subtle', 'attempt', 'shut', 'up', 'beans', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'felt', 'bad', 'Irving', 'bewildered', 'expression', 'Joe', 'taking', 'out.Pandemonium', 'breaks', 'out', 'palace', 'out', 'secret', 'police', 'retrieve', 'Ann', 'film', 'near-slapstick', 'final', 'third', 'barge', 'dancehall', 'ending', 'bittersweet', 'yet', 'appropriate', 'neither', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'stunning', 'vehicle', 'luminous', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'was', 'first', 'comedy', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'most', 'showcase', 'timeless', 'wonders', 'Rome', 'was', 'first', 'American', 'film', 'be', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Italy', 'Paramount', 'had', 'frozen', 'assets', 'Italy', 'Real', 'Italian', 'nobility', 'real', 'international', 'press', 'corps', 'were', 'featured', 'film', 'Most', 'locations', 'exist', 'colorful', 'authentic', 'backgrounds', 'ethnic', 'add', 'degree', 'authenticity', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'matched', 'California', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'documentary', 'film', 'restoration', 'stills', 'gallery', 'original', 'trailer', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'enough', 'fresh', 'age', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'romance', 'comedy', 'travelogues', 'mesmerizing', 'blend', 'three', 'elements']",N/A

The story of a princess escaping her fairy tale life, and finding her own fairy tale outside the palace with a handsome newsman captivated audiences in 1953, and still does today.In her feature film debut, the delightful Audrey Hepburn shines as the gamine Princess Anne, who, loathing her tiresome, claustrophobic life as a royal family member, escapes from her caretakers while on a royal international tour in Rome. When a young newsman, Joe Bradley, (Gregory Peck) stumbles onto the naive young woman, he realizes who she is, and smelling the scoop of a lifetime, takes her on a holiday through the sights and pleasures of Rome while his photographer buddy Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) relentlessly shoots pictures with all sorts of camouflaged gadgets. Joe and &quot;Anya&quot; bask in the joys of the lush city, from lunch at a sidewalk cafe (where the princess also enjoys her first cigarette) to a wild escapade on a runaway motorcycle, to a romantic moonlit dance by a lake... and before the pair realizes it, they've fallen for each other, but can they be together... a princess and a commoner?William Wyler directed this Oscar-winning masterpiece, nominated for, among other awards, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Eddie Albert, and winner for Audrey Hepburn as the year's Best Actress for her brilliant, utterly charming princess. A princess, indeed. Hepburn, the beautiful young gamine, is indeed every inch a princess in her sensitive and beautiful portrayal. Gregory Peck's rugged charm and humor are a perfect match for Hepburn, and the chemistry between the two is a joy to watch. The exquisite cinematography is extraordinary to see, even in black-and-white, and the lively script makes for many golden scenes: One scene in the beginning has Hepburn trying to retrieve a lost shoe during an Embassy dance, another has Hepburn getting her first haircut in an Italian salon, and the whole picture is worth the scene in which Peck dares Hepburn to put her hand into the infamous &quot;Mouth of Truth&quot;: &quot;Legend has it that if you're given to lying, it'll bite your hand off.&quot; Slyly demonstrating, he suddenly yells in agony as the terrified Hepburn screams. He brings his arm out with his hand disappeared, and Hepburn shrieks. But suddenly the hand pops through his coat jacket as Hepburn squeals with mock-fury. And the beautiful, beautiful scene by the lake as the two look into each other's eyes while they dance... what a heavenly feeling you get watching that scene alone.It's a charming film, absolutely beautiful. &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; is a movie about two people falling in love, and it's a movie that you will fall in love with too. This is a film to watch again and again with somebody you love... if you do, it's only that much more of a holiday.",5,"A charming, delightful gem of a movie",990489600,"05 22, 2001",2001,3016,"['Nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'quot', 'still', 'gleeful', 'smile', 'pleasure', 'delight', 'viewer', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'undoubtedly', 'charmed', 'wonderful', 'whimsy', 'film', 'story', 'princess', 'escaping', 'fairy', 'tale', 'life', 'finding', 'own', 'fairy', 'tale', 'palace', 'handsome', 'newsman', 'captivated', 'audiences', '1953', 'still', 'today.In', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'delightful', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'shines', 'gamine', 'Princess', 'Anne', 'who', 'loathing', 'tiresome', 'claustrophobic', 'life', 'royal', 'family', 'member', 'caretakers', 'royal', 'international', 'tour', 'Rome', 'When', 'young', 'newsman', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'naive', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'smelling', 'scoop', 'lifetime', 'holiday', 'sights', 'pleasures', 'Rome', 'photographer', 'buddy', 'Irving', 'Radovich', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'relentlessly', 'shoots', 'pictures', 'sorts', 'camouflaged', 'gadgets', 'Joe', 'quot', 'Anya', 'quot', 'bask', 'joys', 'lush', 'city', 'lunch', 'sidewalk', 'cafe', 'where', 'princess', 'also', 'first', 'cigarette', 'wild', 'escapade', 'runaway', 'motorcycle', 'romantic', 'moonlit', 'dance', 'lake', 'pair', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'other', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'princess', 'commoner', 'William', 'Wyler', 'directed', 'Oscar-winning', 'masterpiece', 'nominated', 'other', 'awards', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'winner', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'year', 'Best', 'Actress', 'brilliant', 'utterly', 'charming', 'princess', 'princess', 'indeed', 'Hepburn', 'beautiful', 'young', 'gamine', 'indeed', 'inch', 'princess', 'sensitive', 'beautiful', 'portrayal', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'rugged', 'charm', 'humor', 'are', 'perfect', 'match', 'Hepburn', 'chemistry', 'two', 'joy', 'watch', 'exquisite', 'cinematography', 'extraordinary', 'see', 'even', 'black-and-white', 'lively', 'script', 'many', 'golden', 'scenes', 'One', 'scene', 'beginning', 'Hepburn', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'lost', 'shoe', 'Embassy', 'dance', 'Hepburn', 'getting', 'first', 'haircut', 'Italian', 'salon', 'whole', 'picture', 'scene', 'Peck', 'Hepburn', 'put', 'hand', 'infamous', 'quot', 'Mouth', 'Truth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Legend', ""'re"", 'given', 'lying', ""'ll"", 'bite', 'hand', 'off.', 'quot', 'Slyly', 'demonstrating', 'suddenly', 'agony', 'terrified', 'Hepburn', 'screams', 'arm', 'out', 'hand', 'disappeared', 'Hepburn', 'shrieks', 'suddenly', 'hand', 'coat', 'jacket', 'Hepburn', 'squeals', 'mock-fury', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'lake', 'two', 'look', 'other', 'eyes', 'dance', 'what', 'heavenly', 'feeling', 'get', 'watching', 'scene', 'alone.It', 'charming', 'film', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'quot', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'falling', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'too', 'film', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'somebody', 'love', 'do', 'only', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'holiday']",N/A

218221,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300215717,Simon Davis,"[9, 9]","""Roman Holiday"", would have to be one of my all time favourite films even from when I was a child. It really is a charmed production from A to Z and is as fresh and charming today as it was over 50 years ago when it succeeded in capturing a young Audrey Hepburn in the sort of ideal role that became her trademark. Indeed perfection is about the only way to describe Audrey in this role of the young beautifully serene princess ""on the lam"", from her tiresome duties on a state visit to Rome who just wants to have some fun and see how the other half lives. Combining with a perfectly cast Gregory Peck the two work magic on screen in a funny, touching, and highly romantic romp that takes us through one carefree day in the beautiful Eternal City where we witness the two strangers slowly fall in love. Despite a few small earlier roles, Princess Ann in ""Roman Holiday"", was Audrey Hepburn's first lead role for which she most deservedly won the 1953 Academy Award as Best Actress. In roles originally intended for Cary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor, nowadays it is hard to imagine anyone else but Audrey Hepburn as the naive young Princess having her first experience of life in the ""normal world"", or Gregory Peck as the young reporter who might just have had the biggest scoop of his life fall right into his lap. Put this perfect combination together with a filmed on location effort in beautiful Rome and you could not possibly find I believe a better combination for a romantic movie such as this.The story opens with the much fanfare driven state visit of Princess Ann of an unidentified European country who is just beginning the Rome leg of her extensive goodwill visit. Overwhelmed with her hectic schedule where she finds herself not only meeting endless local dignitaries but visiting factories, schools and cultural centres the Princess quite rightly develops a case of hysterics at her regimented existence which she mimicks, as her assistant goes over the next days events with a ""No thank you, Yes Thank you, Thank you very much"" rehearsed reply. Hearing the local population of Rome enjoying the warm evening Princess Ann decides to sneak out of the embassy and see a bit of Rome for herself however she has been given an injection to calm her down and make her sleep and once she manages to escape she finds the shot doing its work and she finds herself collapsing on a bench in the Roman Forum. Just at that moment American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) happens to come across her and after first trying to help out the girl who insists that her home is the Colosseum, finds that he has to reluctantly take her home to his tiny apartment to sleep off what he believes is a drinking spree. However Joe finds he has more than he bargained for as news spreads through Rome of the ""strange sudden illness"", of the visiting Princess Ann which has made the embassy cancel all the functions that she was due to attend. Glancing at a photo of the Princess in the papers Joe suddenly realises just who the mysterious girl fast asleep in his apartment actually is. Alerting photographer buddy Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), about just who his visitor is and that they both can make a fortune on the scoop of having a Princess on the run Joe plays along with the charade of thinking she is a normal girl and offers to show ""Anya Smith"", as the Princess calls herself the sights of Rome. Over the course of the day they visit the sights of Rome all the while Irving is taking photos of the Princess which they both intend to sell to the newspapers. However the deception begins to turn sour as Joe finds himself falling in love with ""Anya"" and after an incident at a waterfront dance where a brawl breaks out and the Princess is photographed hitting a secret service officer on the head with a guitar, he decides to not print the story for Ann's sake. When Princess Ann finally says she must return home Joe agrees to drop her off a short distance from the embassy without revealing he knows her true identity. Ann has also fallen in love with the young American not knowing he is a reporter but now realises where her duty lies and they part. Bringing a new assertiveness to her job as Princess Ann agrees to meet with the press th enext day to explain her ""illness"", and her amazing recovery. She gets the shock of her life when out in the audience stands both Joe and Irving as part of the press corps. Breaking protocol Princess Ann comes down to meet the press individually and without letting on to the others she ""meets"" Joe Bradley ""officially"" as one of the press men covering her state visit to Rome. The two indivuals then part company forever as their lives and responsibilities take them off into their very different worldsAs stated Audrey Hepburn could not have had a more charmed introduction to big screen audiences than she does here in ""Roman Holiday"". Despite all the talent involved in this Paramount production both in front and behind the camera Hepburn really is its body and soul and she more than meets the challenge with a performance of rare sensitivity, humour and total grace. She captures the naive and totally trusting Princess to perfection and it is a tribute to Audrey Hepburn's great skills as an actress even at this early stage of he rcareer that she manages to add so much dimension to her playing. This is best illustrated in the delightfully light touches that make Princess Ann such a real creature as seen in the scene when she looses her shoe while attending a state function to meet some important dignitaries and attempts to retrieve it without anyone noticing and when she wakes up in Gregory Peck's apartment and discovers that she is sleeping in his pyjamas and shoots her head under the blanket to see if she is wearing his pyjama trousers as well! Never once in her playing however does Audrey Hepburn allow us to forget she is a Princess and she is the epitome of elegance and serenity when dressed for her reception with the reporters. Her superb Oscar winning gowns by Givency in these scenes create the perfect image of a Princess while the Edith Head designed ""day clothes"", when she is out and about in Rome bring out perfectly the almost childlike charm of a young Princess enjoying life for the first time. Her scenes of liberation in Rome when she gets her hair cut short and attends the dance held down by the Tiber are also remarkable and she manages to keep totally in her established character even when she is smashing a guitar over a secret service man's head during the very funny brawl that breaks out! Obviously beside such a remarkable performance lead actor Gregory Peck had his work cut out for him in his only teaming with Hepburn. What could have been a largely colourless character beside Hepburn's Princess Ann is made by Peck's playing into a character we do care about, an inherently decent newspaper man who is tempted by the break the meeting with the Princess offers him but who instead grows to care and then fall in love with her. Peck's chemistry with Hepburn makes all of their scenes together a romantics delight such as their banter in Peck's apartment, the amusing motor scooter ride through Rome's crowded streets and the very famous scene at the ""Mouth of Truth"", where Peck actually adlibbed the scene of supposedly losing his hand to get the right startled reaction from Hepburn. Of course the city of Rome plays a huge role in this production and Paramount's decision to film in the eternal city was a stroke of genius that added so much to the look and feel of the film. Eddie Albert still best remembered for his work on the TV series ""Green Acres"", also scores well as Irving Radovich, Peck's photographer offsider in the deception and his many comical interludes add just the right light hearted touch to this romantic story. Director William Wyler a Hollywood veteran since the silent era who had directed such classics as ""Dodsworth"", ""The Letter"", ""The Best Years of Our Lives"",and ""Ben Hur"", really captures the true character of Rome here and makes the city a living part of the proceedings. Well known as a hard task master in his directing style the filming of ""Roman Holiday"", was not an easy task with the results often being achieved under very trying circumstances as the movie was filmed during the height of the Roman summer and often in front of huge crowds of curious onlookers where everyones energy and patience was pushed to the limit.For anyone who loves romantic movies set in exotic places ""Roman Holiday"", makes unsurpassed entertainment of the first order. The sheer star power of Audrey Hepburn so ideally cast here will always earn this film immortality in Hollywood's hall of fame and it was this film that was responsible for starting the great love affair that movie goers (this movie lover included especially!), have had ever since with Audrey Hepburn. The perfect marriage of actors, characters, dialogue, and location rarely come together as well as they do in ""Roman Holiday"", and this fact is responsible for this film being loved by successive generations of movie goers. As an introduction to the legend that is Audrey Hepburn dont miss ""Roman Holiday"", it is a viewing experience I always cherish as I know you will too.",5,Totally Captivating Romance With A Magical

Roman Holiday was her breakout movie, and it's a definite classic. The plot's been retold several times in various forms - royalty runs away from their duties and falls in love with a commoner. It's seldom been handled as well as it has here, and Peck and Hepburn are fantastic. Rome itself seems to be timeless - I was there on vacation a year ago and some of the tourist locations I saw were also in the film much as I'd seen them. What also strikes me about this film is how different the ending is. Most Hollywood films of this era attempt a happy ending (see Hepburn's next film, Sabrina).

The rest us of will be well content with the splendor of Rome and the chance to see the remarkable Audrey Hepburn in her debut movie.  In other words, ROMAN HOLIDAY has something for every palate.The plot?  Princess Ann (we're never quite sure which country she's princess of) is enduring a grueling tour of European nations.  Weary to death of the royal treatment, one night Ann escapes into the Roman night.  Unfortunately for her she had a while earlier been given an injection to help her sleep.  The drug takes effect while she's out and about, and reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) discovers her asleep on a street bench.  Believing she's inebriated, and being a gentleman, he tries to deliver her safely to her home.  That plan fails and, being a gentleman, Bradley arranges for the young stranger (he doesn't learn she's the missing princess until the next scene) to sleep on the sofa in his small, one-room apartment.Cary Grant was originally offered the part of Joe Bradley and he turned it down.  One of the dvd's specials tells us he refused the role because he didn't want to play second fiddle to an ingenue.  Maybe so.  It's tempting to decide, on the basis of this scene, that Peck was woefully miscast.  Ann, nearly asleep on her feet, asks Bradley ""Will you help me undress?""  A natural enough request coming from royalty, I guess.  Bradley fumbles around with her neck scarf, unties it, hands it to her and says ""You can handle the rest.""Peck plays the scene for a smile.  Grant would have made it one of the highlights of the movie.  After savoring the opportunity for the audience's delight he would have removed the tie and given the camera a quick peek, as if to say ""Listen here, I know this is a cliched, silly situation.  But doesn't this look like fun.  Don't we make a handsome couple?""  Grant was a supple pagan god who drank more than once from the well of hedonism, and he was always careful to bring the audience along for the good times.  Peck was an Old Testament prophet, a little too stern and stiff to give himself over to pleasure.What Peck brings to the role is authority and a handsome arm for Hepburn to rest on.  Grant would have distracted us, and ROMAN HOLIDAY is best when our attention is focused squarely on Audrey Hepburn.  She delivers a tour de force performance, and you can understand the excitement she generated even after a half century.The specials include the documentary ""Remembering ROMAN HOLIDAY"", which surprised me with all the people who were involved and dropped out of the production of the movie.  ""Edith Head: The Paramount Years"" is a short biography of the famous and talented fashion designer.  ""Restoring ROMAN HOLIDAY"" shows us a number of before and after shots - this is a VERY clean print.

I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live.The cultural significance of William Wyler's ""Roman Holiday"" cannot be understated.  It was here that the world at-large was introduced to Audrey Hepburn.  Saying a star was born with this film would be a gross understatement.  It was with this film that an iconic legend was born.Princess Ann (Hepburn) arrives in Rome to serve as the public relations representative for her home country.  After becoming bored with her official duties, Ann escapes from her chaperones and sets out to seek adventure in Rome.  An American reporter named Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) crosses paths with the truant princess and decides to stick close to her so that he can get the exclusive story of her exploits.  Romance eventually blossoms and soon Joe and Ann are doing everything they can to make the most of the little time they have left together before they must part.There is genuine magic in every frame of ""Roman Holiday.""  This film casts a warm glow about it that envelops the viewer in rapturous cinematic bliss.  Gregory Peck is dashing as a romantic leading man.  Eddie Albert hits all the right notes as his comedic sidekick.  And Audrey Hepburn is absolutely radiant in her Oscar-winning performance.  Wyler also takes full advantage of his surroundings by capturing all of the grandeur of Rome in his shots.  He also wisely incorporates a bittersweet finale that prevents ""Roman Holiday"" from being grouped together with the generic romances that always strain circumstances to get to a happy ending.  This is a timeless treasure that truly feels as fresh today as it did fifty years ago.  You just could not ask for a better production to showcase Audrey Hepburn in her first leading role.",4,"""Joe, we can't go running around town with a hot princess!""",1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,1858,"['Princess', 'Ann', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'Rome', 'means', 'Rome', 'will', 'cherish', 'visit', 'here', 'memory', 'as', 'long', 'live.The', 'cultural', 'significance', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understated', 'was', 'here', 'world', 'at-large', 'was', 'introduced', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Saying', 'star', 'was', 'born', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'understatement', 'was', 'film', 'iconic', 'legend', 'was', 'born.Princess', 'Ann', 'Hepburn', 'Rome', 'serve', 'public', 'relations', 'representative', 'home', 'country', 'becoming', 'bored', 'official', 'duties', 'Ann', 'chaperones', 'out', 'seek', 'adventure', 'Rome', 'American', 'reporter', 'named', 'Joe', 'Bradley', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'paths', 'truant', 'princess', 'decides', 'stick', 'close', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'exclusive', 'story', 'exploits', 'Romance', 'eventually', 'blossoms', 'soon', 'Joe', 'Ann', 'are', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'make', 'most', 'little', 'time', 'have', 'left', 'together', 'must', 'part.There', 'genuine', 'magic', 'frame', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'film', 'warm', 'glow', 'viewer', 'rapturous', 'cinematic', 'bliss', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'dashing', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'right', 'notes', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'absolutely', 'radiant', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Wyler', 'also', 'full', 'advantage', 'surroundings', 'capturing', 'grandeur', 'Rome', 'shots', 'also', 'wisely', 'bittersweet', 'finale', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'being', 'grouped', 'together', 'generic', 'romances', 'always', 'strain', 'circumstances', 'get', 'happy', 'ending', 'timeless', 'treasure', 'truly', 'fresh', 'today', 'did', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'ask', 'better', 'production', 'showcase', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'first', 'leading', 'role']",N/A

In this age of one money-grab DVD release after another, each with a less and less relevant set of ""extras"" than the last, it is a pure joy to find a true Collector's Edition that puts all of its focus squarely where it should: on the film itself (and what a film!). Roman Holiday is a wonderful movie, a no-brainer purchase by default for anyone who loves Audrey Hepburn (which I believe would be anyone who's ever seen her, but I'm biased), but it is the meticulous and caring restoration of it that makes this DVD so spectacular. Instead of just slapping a visually tired print onto DVD media and throwing in completely inane extras that no one would care about (like having people ""comment"" incoherently and meaninglessly over the length of the film, or having scans of every doodle that anyone on the team ever casually scrawled out on a cocktail napkin, etc. ad nauseum), Paramount did the right thing, and devoted the time, money, and skill to restore this classic film back to its gorgeous original visual form.  As for the extras, what is included is more than fine with me.  They are made up of a selected handful of relevant, watchable content, intead of the usual avalanche of meaningless garbage that most DVD ""extras"" lists are comprised of lately.  The only thing I could have asked for is more footage from Audrey's screen test if possible; she is as mesmerizing in it as she is in the film itself.If I do have one beef with this DVD, it is the tiniest: I don't like the artificial coloring that was used for the packaging.  It doesn't look very good, for one thing, and, by implication, it slightly cheapens the homage that the restoration work pays to this classic Black & White masterpiece. Otherwise though, I can't rate this product highly enough.It would have been easy for Paramount to take the low road, as most other companies (with the exception of Criterion, seemingly) choose to, but they didn't, and as a result, we are all lucky enough to have this all-but-perfect version of Roman Holiday available.  It's one of the very rare DVDs that is obviously a labor of love, and you owe it to yourself to own it. Not only is it worth more than its reasonable price, but Paramount very much deserves the gratitude of this film's fans and our votes with our dollars.

She was known outside of Hollywood before she came to play the Princess in this romantic comedy (perhaps a classic of all time). In this film, she is paired with Gregory Peck (who insisted that Audrey Hepburn get her name above the film title). Cary Grant passed on the film role because he knew the Princess would get all of the attention but he was wrong. Peck did a fabulous job in his role as an American journalist who befriends the Princess during their Roman holiday.Hepburn's performance is enchanting and believable. Edith Head didn't get to meet Hepburn before film production since it was filmed abroad. Head used the screen test and Hepburn's measurements to design clothes for her. Audrey Hepburn performs beautifully and elegantly like a princess looking for fun from her boring meetings, meals, and dances with European dignitaries. She sneaks out and looks for adventure in Rome.Gregory Peck's performance is equally enchanting as the American journalist who befriends and keeps her company on her Roman holiday. You have to wonder if he's going to rat her out and use her for a story. Peck's comedic charm comes through in this picture. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn make a lovely pair in this picture.Eddie Albert played the photographer and supporting player who helps keep the secret. He is also unrecognizable in this performance with a beard. You can't help but have to rematch for him. The scene at the Mouth was done with one take.If you watch the extra special features, Gregory Peck explains how it went. There is also a short on the making of Roman Holiday with bits from Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn; Catherine Wyler; Eddie Albert; and Edward Allbert. The film was William Wyler's first comedy in decades and one of the first films shot entirely on location in Rome. Paramount would have casted Dame Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons OBE but both were unavailable. That's who the world got to know and love Audrey Hepburn, a beautiful woman inside and out. Nobody has ever said anything negative about her. The same can be said about Gregory Peck, a beloved Hollywood actor. The screenplay was done by blacklisted author Dalton Trumbo and that's another story.Besides the making of ""Roman Holiday,"" there is restoration explanation of the film itself. While this feature is a little stale at times, it's interesting to see the comparisons between the past and present.Another extra special feature is a tribute to Edith Head, the costume designer to the stars like Hepburn, Taylor, and so many others. Edith Head designed clothes for women to help emphasize their features.

Starring with the charming Gregory Peck she knew how to give a performance that would capture peoples hearts and brought her an Academy Award for best actress that year.This black and white film is one of the most succesful and memorable films of the 1950's. Like I said in the first part of my review, Audrey Hepburn acts beautifully and gives a stunning debute. She is both funny as lovely, but also knows how to give a fantastic dramatic performance.Gregory Peck is the charming man next to Hepburn in this romantic adventure. He gives a nice performance that fits well next to Hepburn's performance. He is charming, funny and was the right choice for this role.The film was shot entirely in Rome, Italy which gives stunning cinematography. The film may be shot in black and white, the spirit and the atmosphere of the lifely Rome of the fifties has been well captured on camera. The director, William Wyler, has succeded in making this film look absolutely beautiful. He gave the film comedy, drama and romance. Elements that are well brought by the actors and the story.The story in short: Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is on her visit in the Italian capital Rome for business. She may look happy when being seen by the people, but behind that beautiful smile she is as unhappy as it can be. She wants to live and get out of the routines she has to follow everyday. One night she escapes from the palace and meets a News reporter played by Gregory Peck who can't wait to get a story. He acts like he doesn't know who she is and takes her into Rome, where they explore the Life she has never had, but only dreamed of having.2 hours of pure movie magic. Take a look at this masterpiece if you love Romantic comedies, classic films or a good drama film.

The romance is helped along by the on-location shooting in Rome, with some very lovely locations.  &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; has such a simple story, and such an uncomplicated feeling, that one is free to simply be in love with everything.The DVD is well worth owning, as the restored Black and White is by far the best print I have seen, including theatrical showings.  Nice extra features including a few interesting documentaries.",5,Simply charming,1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,850,"['are', 'few', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'come', 'even', 'close', 'rivaling', 'sheer', 'charm', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday.', 'quot', 'rare', 'example', 'perfect', 'film.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'so', 'very', 'beautiful', 'could', 'melt', 'stone', 'exactly', 'why', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'perfect', 'playing', 'opposite', 'her', 'only', 'leading', 'man', 'days', 'could', 'possibly', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'Princess', 'Ann', 'very', 'first', 'moment', 'romance', 'helped', 'on-location', 'shooting', 'Rome', 'very', 'lovely', 'locations', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'quot', 'simple', 'story', 'uncomplicated', 'feeling', 'one', 'free', 'simply', 'be', 'love', 'everything.The', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'restored', 'Black', 'White', 'far', 'best', 'print', 'have', 'seen', 'including', 'theatrical', 'showings', 'Nice', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'few', 'interesting', 'documentaries']",N/A
