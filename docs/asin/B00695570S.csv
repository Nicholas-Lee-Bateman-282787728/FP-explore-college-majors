1513728,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B00695570S,D.P.,"[4, 4]","Nick Blades (Adam ""Edge"" Copeland) is a New Orleans Detective currently being trial for corruption against Assistant District Attorney Theo Gold (Jamie Kennedy).  On the way to court, he arrest a man named Gil (Kevin Weisman) who was holding on strongly to a newspaper before taking it from him & putting him in the custody of Officer Garcia (Jennifer Esposito) & bumps into his favorite actress Lena Gold (Jessica Walter) in the hallway not knowing that her son is the lawyer trying to put him in jail.  Theo isn't have the best of luck either as his wife Kelly (Elena Lyons) has threatened to leave him & take the kids with her, has his father's (Philip Baker Hall) car stolen from his house, and gets no assistance & harassment from the police due to him having a fellow officer on trial.  Due to a string of incidents happening to both men that connected them together, they become unlikely partners in order for both men to get what they want but they must deal with masked kidnappers, a Police Meter Man who's actually a mob hitman, and figuring out who is behind the criminal plot both men fell into...if they can get along long enough with Theo always trying to play by the book while Nick doesn't mind bending a rule or two to get results.This is a movie that catered directly to Edge's personality as being a cop who has a sarcastic personality but also smart & actually plays off Jamie Kennedy playing the straight man.  It had it's comedic moments while having a plot easy enough to understand with the only thing negative I have to say is that it's very short (a little over 80 minutes) but I enjoyed it so at least give it look at.",3,"An EDGE-y Cop With A Straight Laced Lawyer Looking For A ""Hawk""",1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,1645,"['Nick', 'Blades', 'Adam', 'Edge', 'Copeland', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Detective', 'currently', 'being', 'trial', 'corruption', 'Assistant', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Theo', 'Gold', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'way', 'court', 'arrest', 'man', 'named', 'Gil', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'who', 'was', 'holding', 'strongly', 'newspaper', 'taking', 'putting', 'custody', 'Officer', 'Garcia', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Lena', 'Gold', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'hallway', 'not', 'knowing', 'son', 'lawyer', 'trying', 'put', 'jail', 'Theo', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'luck', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Elena', 'Lyons', 'threatened', 'leave', 'take', 'kids', 'father', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'car', 'stolen', 'house', 'assistance', 'harassment', 'police', 'due', 'having', 'fellow', 'officer', 'trial', 'Due', 'string', 'incidents', 'happening', 'men', 'connected', 'together', 'become', 'unlikely', 'partners', 'order', 'men', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'must', 'deal', 'masked', 'kidnappers', 'Police', 'Meter', 'Man', 'who', 'actually', 'mob', 'hitman', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'criminal', 'plot', 'men', 'fell', 'can', 'get', 'along', 'long', 'enough', 'Theo', 'always', 'trying', 'play', 'book', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bending', 'rule', 'two', 'get', 'results.This', 'movie', 'catered', 'directly', 'Edge', 'personality', 'being', 'cop', 'who', 'sarcastic', 'personality', 'also', 'smart', 'actually', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'had', 'comedic', 'moments', 'having', 'plot', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'only', 'thing', 'negative', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'short', 'little', '80', 'minutes', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'least', 'give', 'look']",Bending the Rules

Jamie kennedy as a stiff-necked District Attorney who is prsecuting Adam Copeland (wrestling's Edge) for being a &#34;bad&#34; cop. yes he has taken a few liberties with his duties but he is a good cop, nonetheless. Now there 2 need to work together and solve a case. Jamie is funny and has to finally give in to the charms of Edge who is funny and so charming.  I originally got this movie because I seem to enjoy many of these movies that wrestlers get into, no sure why I do but I'm 80% loving them. This movie Jamie is so good but the movie is stolen by Adam Copeland....Edge. He gives such a sweet and charming performance....I'm a huge fan, not of wrestling but of his. (And I'm not at all into wrestling!) BTW loved the entire cast, too.",5,Get it and have fun,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,866,"['was', 'sooooo', 'entertained', 'What', 'fun', 'movie', 'let', 'explain', '.do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'academy', 'awards', 'here', 'do', 'expect', 'lots', 'fun', 'Jamie', 'kennedy', 'stiff-necked', 'District', 'Attorney', 'who', 'prsecuting', 'Adam', 'Copeland', 'wrestling', 'Edge', 'being', '34', 'bad', '34', 'cop', 'taken', 'few', 'liberties', 'duties', 'good', 'cop', 'nonetheless', 'Now', '2', 'need', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'case', 'Jamie', 'funny', 'finally', 'give', 'charms', 'Edge', 'who', 'funny', 'so', 'charming', 'originally', 'got', 'movie', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'many', 'movies', 'wrestlers', 'get', 'sure', 'why', 'do', ""'m"", '80', '%', 'loving', 'movie', 'Jamie', 'so', 'good', 'movie', 'stolen', 'Adam', 'Copeland', '.Edge', 'sweet', 'charming', 'performance', '.I', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'not', 'wrestling', ""'m"", 'not', 'wrestling', 'BTW', 'loved', 'entire', 'cast', 'too']",Bending the Rules
1513733,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00695570S,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","First the disclaimers: I am not a fan of the WWE nor do I normally watch any of their productions outside of Steve Austin films and a few with that Piper guy. The only reason I got this film was that it was at the local flee market and I needed a fourth film to complete my 4 for $10 and had a choice between this or another copy of ""Hunger Games"" with Russian subtitles. It is with extreme reluctance and prejudice that I popped this film into my DVD, hoping it would not play and I could return it next week for something better.Adam ""Edge"" Copeland stars as Nick Blades, an unorthodox plains clothes New Orleans detective with a gag name. He is on trial for corruption and is up against Theo Gold (Jamie Kennedy) the assistant DA. Theo is dedicated, uncharismatic, and disliked by nearly everyone including his family. There are a number of odd things going on and about midway through the film the plot is explained to us by under an utilized Pruitt Taylor Vince in a doughnut shop.There were some LOL moments such as when Blades talks to a young girl sitting on her doorstep. Then there were very slow scenes involving Gold's father. It was a decent second tier comedy/action/cop drama that had the feel of a television pilot. They could have cast better than Jamie Kennedy who did a lame job playing a lame guy. Good sound track.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity",4,YOU NEED A HUG,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,1361,"['First', 'disclaimers', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'WWE', 'do', 'normally', 'watch', 'productions', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'films', 'few', 'Piper', 'guy', 'only', 'reason', 'got', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'local', 'flee', 'market', 'needed', 'fourth', 'film', 'complete', '4', '10', 'had', 'choice', 'copy', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Russian', 'subtitles', 'extreme', 'reluctance', 'prejudice', 'popped', 'film', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'could', 'return', 'next', 'week', 'something', 'better.Adam', 'Edge', 'Copeland', 'Nick', 'Blades', 'unorthodox', 'plains', 'clothes', 'New', 'Orleans', 'detective', 'gag', 'name', 'trial', 'corruption', 'up', 'Theo', 'Gold', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'assistant', 'DA', 'Theo', 'dedicated', 'uncharismatic', 'disliked', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'including', 'family', 'are', 'number', 'odd', 'things', 'going', 'midway', 'film', 'plot', 'explained', 'utilized', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'doughnut', 'were', 'LOL', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Blades', 'talks', 'young', 'girl', 'sitting', 'doorstep', 'Then', 'were', 'very', 'slow', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Gold', 'father', 'was', 'decent', 'second', 'tier', 'comedy/action/cop', 'drama', 'had', 'feel', 'television', 'pilot', 'could', 'have', 'cast', 'better', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'did', 'lame', 'job', 'playing', 'lame', 'guy', 'Good', 'sound', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",Bending the Rules

Detective Nick Blades (Edge) is on trial for corruption and Assistant DA Gold (Kennedy) is the one prosecuting him. After a mistrial occurs and Gold's car is stolen it is up to the two adversaries to work together to solve the crime that gets increasingly more sinister. Yet another movie starring a wrestler. I will have to admit that this is one of the better ones and at least they realize that it is hard to make a serious movie with one. While this boils down to just another buddy movie it is actually not that bad and kind of entertaining. There is enough comedy in this to keep you watching and even though this is fairly predictable it is still very much worth a watch. Fans of wrestler movies will love this, everyone else will enjoy this. At least I did. Overall, much better then the recent wrestler movies. I kinda liked it.
