After a period of desperation, Aki then tries to escape by seducing and manipulating Michio against his mother. The relationship between Aki and Michio, which Masumura wants to be the heart of the movie, will over time develop in a weird and sick fashion. The movie is not explicitly violent or sexually graphic, but it is an oppressive and generally unpleasant movie to see anyway. You can say that this S&M tale was way ahead of its time (there were very few movies of this kind in 1969), the other question could be whether it is a pleasant movie to watch.",3,"Ahead of its time, though not terribly pleasant",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,690,"['Blind', 'sculptor', 'Michio', 'helped', 'mother', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'model', 'Aki', 'imprisoning', 'will', 'studio', 'period', 'desperation', 'Aki', 'then', 'escape', 'seducing', 'manipulating', 'Michio', 'mother', 'relationship', 'Aki', 'Michio', 'Masumura', 'be', 'heart', 'movie', 'will', 'time', 'develop', 'weird', 'sick', 'fashion', 'movie', 'not', 'explicitly', 'violent', 'sexually', 'graphic', 'oppressive', 'generally', 'unpleasant', 'movie', 'see', 'anyway', 'can', 'say', 'S', 'M', 'tale', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'kind', '1969', 'other', 'question', 'could', 'be', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'watch']",Blind Beast

Considering that this movie is 40+ years old and is BETTER than most of the product made since should tell you something about it's timelessness and quality.  Granted, this movie is somewhat graphic and there is a GORY SCENE towards the end, I recommend this movie for viewing, as it gives the viewer a good sense of the workings of an affected mind, and what influence that that mind can have on others!

677388,A2IX2P42AS6ZGO,B00005R1NZ,--,"[15, 16]","I had heard a bit about this movie before picking it up, and I was quite pleasantly surprised! The basic premise has been covered already on this page so I'll spare that, but this thing starts off interestingly enough, gets stranger and more engrossing, then goes completely out into left field! Seriously, the story is a bit odd, the acting (though it takes some getting used to) works well for the feel of the film, the sets are amazing, and the ending is just an evisceration! I was ready to prepare myself for a boring ending, and even when I thought my intelligence couldn't take the insult that the final stretch could be considered to be, it was too fascinating not to be entertained by. I suppose my disbelief kept me glued to the screen. This is a movie that you really do need to just go along with and experience for the magic to take effect. If you're into getting a wildly creative slap in the face now and then, do yourself a favor and least see this.Also, Fantoma should be commended for their taste, skill, and dedication to the lesser known, yet very interesting films they've chosen to resurface. One surefire way to tell that you've reached new lows in your DVD geekdom is that you start obsessing over DVD companies, and so far, Anchor Bay, Criterion (obviously), Fox Lorber, and Kino (damn! I'd better stop!) have done great things and brought us many treasures. With their track record so far of great, avant-garde features and the fact that they're working on putting out the works of Kenneth Anger, Fantoma could turn out to be a major force in subversive and obscure DVD cinema.",5,I'm floored......,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,1603,"['had', 'heard', 'bit', 'movie', 'picking', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'basic', 'premise', 'been', 'covered', 'already', 'page', 'so', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'thing', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'stranger', 'more', 'engrossing', 'then', 'completely', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'Seriously', 'story', 'bit', 'odd', 'acting', 'getting', 'used', 'well', 'feel', 'film', 'sets', 'are', 'amazing', 'ending', 'just', 'evisceration', 'was', 'ready', 'prepare', 'boring', 'ending', 'even', 'when', 'thought', 'intelligence', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'insult', 'final', 'stretch', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'was', 'too', 'fascinating', 'not', 'be', 'entertained', 'suppose', 'disbelief', 'kept', 'glued', 'screen', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'need', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'experience', 'magic', 'take', 'effect', ""'re"", 'getting', 'wildly', 'creative', 'slap', 'face', 'now', 'then', 'do', 'favor', 'least', 'see', 'this.Also', 'Fantoma', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'taste', 'skill', 'dedication', 'lesser', 'known', 'yet', 'very', 'interesting', 'films', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'resurface', 'One', 'surefire', 'way', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'new', 'lows', 'DVD', 'geekdom', 'start', 'obsessing', 'DVD', 'companies', 'so', 'far', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Criterion', 'obviously', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'Kino', 'damn', ""'d"", 'better', 'stop', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'things', 'brought', 'many', 'treasures', 'track', 'record', 'so', 'far', 'great', 'avant-garde', 'features', 'fact', ""'re"", 'working', 'putting', 'out', 'works', 'Kenneth', 'Anger', 'Fantoma', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'major', 'force', 'subversive', 'obscure', 'DVD', 'cinema']",Blind Beast

It was really downright silly. Has there ever been anything in real life close to what this is? Not that I know. The acting was just o.k. The setting was preposterous, especially when you find out that the ""blind beast"" did most of it himself with a little help from his obsessed mother. Of course there was a long tradition of Japanese mothers spoiling their male children. Probably why they grew up exploiting women for the rest of their lives!

677390,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00005R1NZ,Zack Davisson,"[3, 4]","This film deserves a better box cover, and a better translated title.  From the first glance, it looks like some cheap exploitation flick with a gimmick involving a blind man, good for some nudity and thrills and little else.  But this is a film directed by Yasuzo Masumura, and while it may be low-budget there is nothing cheap about ""Blind Beast"".  Ah, but that title...the original Japanese title,  ""Moju"", is a brilliant use of the language and can be translated either as ""blind obedience"" or ""wild animal"" depending on the characters used.  Based on a story by Edogawa Rampo, Masumura took the basic core of the tale and built a claustrophobic fantasy of obsession and sensation that attracts and repulses at the same time, using the pure artistry of the camera.The story is exceedingly simple, with a blind man, bitter at the world and at his parents for his lack of sight, turns to touch as his only source of pleasure.  A psychopath and a megalomaniac, he decides it his his mission in life to create a new art form based on touch, using a woman's perfect sensual body as his muse.  After locating the woman who suits his ideal, he kidnaps her with the help of his mother, and together they begin their descent into a dark world.  Fairly typical of the Japanese Erotic-Grotesque genre, his model transforms from victim to willing participant, dragging the man even further into the world of pain and pleasure.And while this can be seen as a typical genre film, those looking for exploitative sex and violence will find neither.  In Masumura's shadow world, nothing happens on camera and all we see is the aftermath.  There is very little nudity to speak of, and no blood or gore.  Everything is implied, which of course makes it all the more terrible.  The entire movie takes place on about two sets, with only three actors, and could be a stage play if not for the powerful camera work and effective soundtrack.",5,Touch is everything,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,1921,"['film', 'better', 'box', 'cover', 'better', 'translated', 'title', 'first', 'glance', 'cheap', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'gimmick', 'involving', 'blind', 'man', 'good', 'nudity', 'thrills', 'little', 'else', 'film', 'directed', 'Yasuzo', 'Masumura', 'may', 'be', 'low-budget', 'nothing', 'cheap', 'Blind', 'Beast', 'Ah', 'title', 'original', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Moju', 'brilliant', 'use', 'language', 'can', 'be', 'translated', 'either', 'blind', 'obedience', 'wild', 'animal', 'depending', 'characters', 'used', 'Based', 'story', 'Edogawa', 'Rampo', 'Masumura', 'took', 'basic', 'core', 'tale', 'built', 'claustrophobic', 'fantasy', 'obsession', 'sensation', 'same', 'time', 'using', 'pure', 'artistry', 'camera.The', 'story', 'exceedingly', 'simple', 'blind', 'man', 'bitter', 'world', 'parents', 'lack', 'sight', 'touch', 'only', 'source', 'pleasure', 'psychopath', 'megalomaniac', 'mission', 'life', 'create', 'new', 'art', 'form', 'based', 'touch', 'using', 'woman', 'perfect', 'sensual', 'body', 'muse', 'locating', 'woman', 'who', 'suits', 'ideal', 'help', 'mother', 'together', 'begin', 'descent', 'dark', 'world', 'Fairly', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'Erotic-Grotesque', 'genre', 'model', 'transforms', 'victim', 'willing', 'participant', 'dragging', 'man', 'even', 'further', 'world', 'pain', 'pleasure.And', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'typical', 'genre', 'film', 'looking', 'exploitative', 'sex', 'violence', 'will', 'find', 'Masumura', 'shadow', 'world', 'nothing', 'happens', 'camera', 'see', 'aftermath', 'very', 'little', 'nudity', 'speak', 'blood', 'gore', 'Everything', 'implied', 'course', 'more', 'terrible', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'two', 'sets', 'only', 'three', 'actors', 'could', 'be', 'stage', 'play', 'not', 'powerful', 'camera', 'work', 'effective', 'soundtrack']",Blind Beast
