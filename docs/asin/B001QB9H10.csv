He is not told the nature of the package, to whom he must deliver it, or even where. The evil Johnson tells him only that if he wanders more than 75 feet from his car, the bracelet with which he has been involuntarily decorated will explode, and he'll go up in flames with it.Along for the ride is Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), a freckled and red-headed Ukrainian woman with a taste for drugs and vodka, who will tell our hero nothing about how she ended up in the same predicament, or why Johnson has sent her along for the ride.All Martin knows is that one of his best friends drove through the exterior wall of his home, with Valentina in the car, and shortly thereafter died the gruesome death by explosion that Martin now must avoid.The film is full of jujitsu and other martial arts, during which Martin beats of a large collection of hoodlums, often without knowing why he's been attacked.

At one point in the movie he is surrounded by the bad guys and he kicks butt and takes names. Just like the two previous TRANSPORTERS. I do wonder sometimes why the baddies aren't a little brighter. Honestly, were I one of the attackers, I'd just wait til his back was turned and pop him. (We're just getting through the James Bond Collection my husband got for Christmas, but the same question applies here: When the villian has the drop on the hero, why does he insist on talking? SHOOT, then have a conversation with a corpse!) We seem to be getting a Jason Statham collection going and in every one of them he takes off the shirt - by popular demand, no doubt -- and he gets surrounded by the villians. sigh  No originality whatsoever in any of the movies but the fact he does most his own stunts is very impressive.Wait. I had to check to see which one I was reviewing. Let's face it: there is no real difference in the three movies. Lots of action, Statham takes off his shirt, and there are rules. (In TRANSPORTER 2 you would think the producers would be aware of the rule that states two blue eyed people cannot have a brown eyed child, but...)  Regardless, I like his rules. I like his French inspector showing up in every movie. I LOVE the black cars. I like knowing he is the one doing the action shots instead of obvious stand-ins (Did you hear that Seagal?)

Cue the ""bomb-cuff"". Action, shirt off, romance, action, fast cars, action, ah the shirt is off again, kicking major butt.

1230287,A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,B001QB9H10,Brian Reaves,"[0, 0]","The first Transporter movie was great. The action sequences were amazing, and it made Jason Statham a true action star. Then the second one came along and we had the racing scenes twist reality a little too far (flipping a car in mid-air so a bomb on the bottom can be snatched off by a conveniently located crane hook?). Now this third installment of the series comes along and we are shown just how far you can twist things. Sink your car in the bottom of a lake, deflate its tires, then pull it out and see if you can just drive it off. Not bloody likely.Don't get me wrong, Jason is every bit the action star. When the fight scenes start, I think he does a great job. I say ""I think"" because the POV on the camera changes literally every 2 seconds when a fight scene starts so you have trouble keeping up with anything happening. I have no idea why they would go to such trouble to choreograph a fight scene and then make it impossible to tell what is going on in the process.Statham is an awesome fighter and has the dark charisma that makes it fun to watch, but it's a shame this particular franchise keeps falling further and further into the absurd. If they do make a Transporter 4 (and with a different director, I wouldn't mind if they did), I hope they simply make it fighting and racing--no magic driving off bridges onto moving trains and junk like that.This one is all right to see, but I can't recommend it too highly.

I may not have enjoyed it quite as much as the first two movies, but I don't regret that I bought it either. It is basically the same kind of material the first movies contained, just remixed. Remixes are okay but they lack a little originality. That is the only thing missing in this movie. He transports a woman, he did that in the first movie. This is a daughter being kidnapped again as in the first movie, but by a stranger keeping people in control by trying to force her father the EPA rep to sign over dumping toxic waste rights. His friend the French policeman helps him get answers as he did in the second movie. There are couple shirtless fight scenes were Frank shows his nice physigue and fighting style as he did in previous movies. So overall the movie is entertaining with plenty of the same as the first two, just nothing that stands out as new. As for the originality of the exploding bracelets, I have seen them before in multiple forms including around the neck and ankle. I listed one movie below. By the same token people shouldn't ping on Frank because he does things that seem impossible in this movie (breathing through a tire valve underwater and driving a car on two wheels between two semi-trailers, he did impossible things in the first two movies as well.

1230292,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001QB9H10,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 2]","""Transporter 3"" is an action film in every sense. A brain isn't required to watch it, and I have a feeling there wasn't much of a brain at work when making it. Does that make it worth seeing? Not really. I'll be the first to admit that mindless action can be a fun, harmless distraction. Consider this summer's ""Wanted,"" a film I recommended not for its story, but for its stylish comic book excess. It was meant to be preposterous. ""Transporter 3"" doesn't have the same appeal. It feels forced, contrived, and desperate, as if the filmmakers knew right from the start that they didn't have much to work with. Maybe it's become tiresome to once again watch Jason Statham play the exact same role. Or maybe it's the fact that the plot is paper-thin, awkwardly humorous, and oddly derivative of older James Bond films. It could be any number of things. All I know is that, even for something that's purely escapist, it isn't trying very hard.There are, however, a few interesting ideas at work. Having moved from Miami back to the South of France, professional Transporter Frank Martin (Statham) has the odds stacked against him when an American assassin named Johnson (Robert Knepper) forces him into moving a package from Marseilles to Odessa. The package: A beautiful, if sulky, Ukrainian woman named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbe), the head of his country's Environmental Protection Agency. In order to ensure compliance from both Frank and Valentina, Johnson has each fitted with a special bracelet that will explode if they step more than seventy-five feet away from Frank's car, an Audi A8 W12. But you know Frank--he doesn't even follow his own rules, let alone rules that are imposed on him. So just imagine all the eye-popping visuals and impossible stunts that are in store for you.Here are some examples. (1) On a long road in the middle of nowhere, Frank is speeding away from a pursuing car. Up ahead are two slow-moving eighteen-wheelers, which, for reasons known only to the filmmakers, are going in the same direction while occupying both sides of the road. In order to escape, Frank has to go between the trucks. But how can he when the gap is so narrow? Somehow, he manages to tilt his car to one side, balancing it only on the left-side wheels. (2) After driving his car into a lake, Frank uses the air from the tires to inflate large orange balloons, which, of course, returns the car to the surface. After he somehow gets the engine restarted, he drives to a bridge, zooms off, and lands on top of a speeding passenger train, where poor Valentina is in Johnson's evil clutches.Yes, it's all in the spirit of fun. Even so, something was missing. I couldn't suspend disbelief as easily as I could for films like ""Wanted."" It could be due to the character development, which is not normally associated with mindless action films. Consider Valentina, always moping, always aloof, always thinking about death. Yet at the same time, she yearns for Frank's affection. I think it all began when Frank found himself in hand-to-hand combat with a group of Johnson's thugs in the middle of a mechanic's garage. In that particular moment, Frank's fighting style can essentially be described as an aggressive striptease, his jacket, tie, and shirt removed at one point or another. Needless to say, Valentina liked what she saw. She uses it against him later on after grabbing the car keys, exiting the car, and moving away; she won't give Frank the keys back unless he removes his shirt.And as for Frank ... well, there really isn't much that can be said. Twice before he's been a monotone, wisecracking, testosterone pumping, seemingly indestructible action hero, and he remains one in this new film. Of course, the fact that he's always so serious and professional doesn't stop him from falling for Valentina, which is hard to understand given the complete lack of chemistry between them. It probably would have been better had writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen hadn't made an attempt at character development. Don't expose Valentina's frailty or even her uncanny ability to tell Frank where in Europe to find the best food. And don't have her and Frank fall in love. Love is too deep and meaningful for a man that transports things for a living.The comedy relief--for lack of a better term--mostly comes from the interactions between Frank and his long-time friend, Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand). At the start of the film, they have a spirited debate on whether Jerry Lewis was funnier than Dean Martin. Tarconi, true to his French upbringing, believes Lewis is a comedic genius. Frank takes the opposite approach: ""Anyone can fall down and get a laugh, but a real genius does it while drinking and smoking."" This is, we eventually discover, a parallel to a later observation made by Tarconi about why Russians are always so morose: ""I remember reading Dostoevsky and thinking, `Don't these people ever laugh?'"" Maybe they do and maybe they don't. What does it matter? It's an amusing line, although I wonder why there needed to be a sense of humor at all. Who made it a rule that action films had to be funny in order to be entertaining? Normally, all you have to do is give me something good to look at. Unfortunately, for everything ""Transporter 3"" could have been as an escapist action film, it just didn't live up to my expectations.",3,Do Not Step Away From the Vehicle,1228176000,"12 2,

1230298,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001QB9H10,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 1]","Transporter is such an amazing film, a real surprise, great timing, interesting story, and just the right amount of action. Fast forward to version 3, and everything just feels wrong.The opening 10 or 15 minutes pack some interesting story line, decent action, that car crashing through Frank's living room wall was incredible. From there the film just goes down hill. The real turning point, Frank starts talking to Valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuses to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). Finally she talks about food at a restaurant. It's foreshadowing, but she does talk about carrots a lot. And sadly the only thought this reviewer and his two sons had was, well does that help her keep her red hair and freckles? Sad but true, the movie just completely lost it's way at this point.The action scenes are exciting and pitiful at the same time. The excitment is in the chase and the rapid fire editing, slick cars, beautiful scenery, and pulsating music and sound. The awful part, and this absolutely kills these sequences, so much sped up motion was used as to make these scenes almost stupid. Sped up and slo-mo fighting scenes were tiresome. The worst was the driving on two wheels between the two semi's stunt - plain old, flat out, stupid, defying all laws of physics and the darn CG effect was too obvious.It's a sad movie when the viewer can actually see the light green tint around the edge of the actors in front of a green screen (just about every in car conversation is plagued with this). If the action had been furious enough, the dialog compelling, the story interesting; the green screen effect would have faded away. Instead it's out there in the open, made even visible on Blu-Ray.There's a ton of continuity issues, where things don't match from one scene to the next. Frankly, this reviewer has never seen a longer list for any other movie that that internet movie database. T 3 has probably set a record for the most (there are over 30 goofs).Natalya Rudakova is just not a very good actress, her delivery of lines is flat and almost read from the script. She is not really that beautiful, certainly not somebody that Frank should be attracted to. The reviewer found himself noticing the dark marks on her lips, either cold sores or freckles. It's very sad when a lead actress just isn't captivating. Jason Statham is the only reason this film gets two stars. This is essentially a guy movie, not really a date film. Jason taking his shirt off several times, well just wasn't a smart move; it plays to the wrong audience. The fishing scene with the French police inspector is charming. Him driving an old Renault 6 is also an interesting contrast. The other characters are just flat.The film is rated PG-13. There is no nudity. The f bomb is in a subtitle once. There's plenty of violence, a fair amount of blood, and several times where a person is shown being shot. Given that the movie is so bad, it's probably smart to respect the age guideline.Blu-Ray was a mixed blessing for this film. The sound is incredible. It will excercise your subwoofer. The gun shots and fighting sounds are significantly higher volume than the dialog. The high resolution of Blu-Ray shows all the bad / cheap CG effects the director chose. On DVD, these might not have been as visible.The Blu-Ray disc includes some really lame Mogolo (apologies for not spelling this correctly) piece of junkware software. It took a good solid 15 minutes (at 12Mbps very fast internet connection) to download the program. It appears to allow a person to view a clip of the film, store it, add some graphics, and then share it with others. After step 12 in the demo, I gave up totally. Cr__ware experiments just keep happening with Blu-Ray. Maybe one day the authors of this junk will settle down to just show the movie in all it's High Def glory.",2,Retire the franchise,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,3871,"['Transporter', 'such', 'amazing', 'film', 'real', 'surprise', 'great', 'timing', 'interesting', 'story', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'Fast', 'forward', 'version', '3', 'everything', 'just', 'wrong.The', 'opening', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'pack', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'decent', 'action', 'car', 'crashing', 'Frank', 'living', 'room', 'wall', 'was', 'incredible', 'film', 'just', 'down', 'hill', 'real', 'turning', 'point', 'Frank', 'talking', 'Valentina', 'breaks', 'rule', 'cargo', 'speak', 'invoking', 'rule', 'not', 'talking', 'Finally', 'food', 'restaurant', 'foreshadowing', 'talk', 'carrots', 'lot', 'sadly', 'only', 'thought', 'reviewer', 'two', 'sons', 'had', 'was', 'well', 'help', 'keep', 'red', 'hair', 'freckles', 'Sad', 'true', 'movie', 'just', 'completely', 'lost', 'way', 'point.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'pitiful', 'same', 'time', 'excitment', 'chase', 'rapid', 'fire', 'editing', 'slick', 'cars', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'pulsating', 'music', 'sound', 'awful', 'part', 'absolutely', 'sequences', 'so', 'much', 'sped', 'up', 'motion', 'was', 'used', 'make', 'scenes', 'almost', 'stupid', 'Sped', 'up', 'slo-mo', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'were', 'tiresome', 'worst', 'was', 'driving', 'two', 'wheels', 'two', 'semi', 'stunt', 'plain', 'old', 'flat', 'out', 'stupid', 'defying', 'laws', 'physics', 'darn', 'CG', 'effect', 'was', 'too', 'obvious.It', 'sad', 'movie', 'when', 'viewer', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'light', 'green', 'tint', 'edge', 'actors', 'front', 'green', 'screen', 'just', 'about', 'car', 'conversation', 'plagued', 'action', 'had', 'been', 'furious', 'enough', 'dialog', 'compelling', 'story', 'interesting', 'green', 'screen', 'effect', 'would', 'have', 'faded', 'away', 'Instead', 'out', 'there', 'open', 'made', 'even', 'visible', 'Blu-Ray.There', 'ton', 'continuity', 'issues', 'where', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'Frankly', 'reviewer', 'never', 'seen', 'longer', 'list', 'other', 'movie', 'internet', 'movie', 'database', 'T', '3', 'probably', 'set', 'record', 'most', 'are', '30', 'goofs', '.Natalya', 'Rudakova', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'delivery', 'lines', 'flat', 'almost', 'read', 'script', 'not', 'really', 'beautiful', 'certainly', 'not', 'somebody', 'Frank', 'should', 'be', 'attracted', 'reviewer', 'found', 'noticing', 'dark', 'marks', 'lips', 'either', 'cold', 'sores', 'freckles', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'lead', 'actress', 'just', ""n't"", 'captivating', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'essentially', 'guy', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'date', 'film', 'Jason', 'taking', 'shirt', 'several', 'times', 'well', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'smart', 'move', 'wrong', 'audience', 'fishing', 'scene', 'French', 'police', 'inspector', 'charming', 'Him', 'driving', 'old', 'Renault', '6', 'also', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'flat.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'nudity', 'f', 'bomb', 'subtitle', 'once', 'plenty', 'violence', 'fair', 'amount', 'blood', 'several', 'times', 'where', 'person', 'shown', 'being', 'shot', 'Given', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'probably', 'smart', 'respect', 'age', 'guideline.Blu-Ray', 'was', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'film', 'sound', 'incredible', 'will', 'excercise', 'subwoofer', 'gun', 'shots', 'fighting', 'sounds', 'are', 'significantly', 'higher', 'volume', 'dialog', 'high', 'resolution', 'Blu-Ray', 'shows', 'bad', '/', 'cheap', 'CG', 'effects', 'director', 'chose', 'DVD', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'visible.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'really', 'lame', 'Mogolo', 'apologies', 'not', 'spelling', 'correctly', 'piece', 'junkware', 'software', 'took', 'good', 'solid', '15', 'minutes', '12Mbps', 'very', 'fast', 'internet', 'connection', 'download', 'program', 'allow', 'person', 'view', 'clip', 'film', 'store', 'add', 'graphics', 'then', 'share', 'others', 'step', '12', 'demo', 'gave', 'up', 'totally', 'Cr__ware', 'just', 'keep', 'happening', 'Blu-Ray', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'authors', 'junk', 'will', 'settle', 'down', 'just', 'show', 'movie', 'High', 'Def', 'glory']",N/A
1230299,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001QB9H10,Dave. K,"[1, 2]","TRANSPORTER 3** Out of 5Release Date- November 26th, 2008Running Time- 104-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- Luc Besson & Robert Mark KamenDirector- Oliver MegatonStarring- Jason Statham, Natalya Rudakova, Robert Knepper and Francois Berleand as Inspector TarconiThe Transporter series is everything that is wrong with Hollywood today, but I must confess I did enjoy the first two parts. The first was mindless fun that makes for a fun viewing. The 2nd was also mindless fun and while the action was a bit too over the top it was still a lot of fun. But Transporter 3 was rather lousy in my opinion and it was mindless, but there was no fun to be found.Since the Michael Bay era started action movies have been on the decline and we really haven't had any new action stars to arrive either. The days of Bronson, McQueen, Eastwood, Russell, Arnold and Stallone are gone and while Li & Chan are still good their American movies are rather weak and the newer action stars to arrive are far inferior to those I listed. But Jason Statham on the other hand has the potential to be in the same league as those guys.Statham has the tough guy persona down pat and has the cool factor going for him. He actually reminds me a little bit of Steve McQueen and again I think Statham can be the next Iconic action star, but he really needs to find a new agent. Even though I did enjoy the first two Transporter films they will by no means go down in the action genre. Transporter 3 puts a serious dent in the career of Jason Statham.The screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen was rather horrible; we don't go into movies like this for their deep and complex plots, but even by popcorn movie standards this script is a wreck. The plot is weak and by the time anything is explained I highly doubt anyone will still care. This is the kind of movie you watch and when it's over you'll be hard pressed to remember a single detail since everything is so forgettable. None of the characters have any depth or anything interesting to do; like I said even by popcorn movie standards this script is still terrible.Director Oliver Megaton fails at brining much to the table granted the script didn't give him a whole lot to work with, but even with that said there's no sense of pacing and the action scenes are quite lackluster. A lot of people complained that the action scenes in Transporter 2 were far too over the top and I'd have to agree. I've seen movies with over the top action scenes, but yet you can suspend your disbelief. Look at some of the movies out of Hong Kong for instance, but yet you can buy into it; But sometimes you can't and that was the problem with Transporter 2, but they were still fun.I wish I could say the same here. The problem wasn't the action scenes were too over the top the problem was they were boring and lifeless. There is also long stretches with any action, which is when things get boring since the weak plot cannot carry the movie, but when the action scenes do start you won't care since they are so weak. Oliver Megaton manages to deliver some decent action scenes in the final act, but even than they still fall a bit flat.Statham does his best with what very little he's given to work with, but even he can't help this sinking ship. Natalya Rudakova makes her screen debut as Valentina and like Statham does her best, but again nothing could save this movie.Like I said the Transporter flicks are everything wrong with Hollywood, but yet they are still fun, but Transporter 3 falls flat on pretty much every aspect and ends up a total bore.As for the Blu-ray release the transfer is one of the best I've seen too bad it's wasted on this.

They combine elements of Bond, ""Die Hard"" and ""Speed"" but infuse enough originality to avoid being derivative.  I don't have enough superlatives for a flick that orchestrates a chase scene with the Stooges ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"".  As for Statham, he's the real deal.  He can quip like Connery and kick it like Arnold and Bruces Willis and Lee.  I remember a local critic stating that the contemporary crop of Brits are on the wimpy side but methinks he's seen too many Orlando Bloom flicks and not enough Statham and Clive Owen.

1230310,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B001QB9H10,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[2, 3]","We have become die hard fans of Jason Statham movies. The Transporter series being one of his best, we own all three. An English actor, Statham was born in Sydenham, on the south east London, growing up playing football and diving. His first experience with movies came from being cast by Guy Ritchie, British director in a 1998 hit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and later in the 2000 film Snatch.In 2008 Statham returns in the role of Frank Martin, a driver that transports cargo without asking questions and under strict rules: Stick to the deal, Don't ask names and Don't look in the package. Statham's martial arts background allows him to perform most of his own stunts and it is simply thrilling to observe him in action.Transporter 3 brings back our favorite hard driving courier, now under the most difficult of circumstances because if he gets too far from the car he will die. Bad guy Johnson, played by Robert Knepper, demands that an influential politician do as he commands or he will kill his daughter Valentina, played by Natalya Rodakova.Valentina has been drugged, kidnapped and wears a wrist bracelent bomb that can blow her up if she gets too far from the vehicle. She is being used because of her importance to her father, a Ukranian official played by Jeroen Krabbe, who can sign off the papers to allow toxic cargo in transit in one of the bad guy's ships. One of the most amazing sequences in this film is when Frank Martin stays close to his car through the most amazing chase through buildings, store fronts, alleys and finally how he recovers control of the car.Frank Martin is good at what he does but when he gets involved and his passion is aroused he is a lethal weapon, unstoppable and effective. If you like action packed movies, this is the series to obtain.

If either of them move more than 75 feet away from Frank's car, their bracelet will explode.Given all of the other reviews that I have read of ""The Transporter 3"", I went in to this film expecting to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised when I wasn't. Although the script is not quite as good as Luc Besson's previous film, ""Taken"", this is more than made up for by the awesome stunts and martial arts sequences (choreographed by Cory Yuen, who was responsible for the action sequences in the previous two films). Two action sequences in particular, one involving Statham effectively performing a striptease while fighting half a dozen villains, and the grand finale on the train, are alone worth the price of admission.One of the main criticisms that had been leveled at this film is that the heroine is distractingly ugly and annoying. Although Rudakova and Statham seem to have absolutely no chemistry between them at all and I did wonder why Frank Martin was even remotely interested in Valentina, she wasn't so annoying as to ruin the film for me. Valentina is meant to be objectionable, and keeping that in mind, I actually thought Rudakova did a good job of playing her. As for her looks, I didn't think she was bad looking, just different, and I actually thought it was nice to see someone who didn't look the same as every other Hollywood heroine.As for Jason Statham, I am still not certain as to whether he can act or not, but who really cares.

1230324,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,B001QB9H10,JLR,"[0, 0]","No one should ever go to a Luc Besson movie expecting brain power. But for anyone who wants a good action fix, his movies always deliver. ""Transporter 3"", the third installment of the Besson-penned ""Transporter"" series starring Jason Staham, not only provides the fix but also a suggestion that one should leave their brain out the front door for a piece of the fun.The first two ""Transporter"" movies were run-of-the-mill action movies that had some impressive fighting sequences but generic storytelling. ""3"" is easily the most inventive and enjoyable due to the fact that it takes implausibility to a whole new level and is aware of it. For example, how to make of the incomprehensible plot where the sharp-suited baddie (played with irresistible oiliness by Robert Knepper) kidnaps a Ukrainian minister's daughter named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) to persuade him to bring eight toxic container ships into the Odessa harbor? Even if he did, what makes one think that he can get away with it, with not only so many ships but so much substance lingering on board? For some reason, this involves the Transporter (Jason Staham), who is blackmailed into traveling halfway across Europe with Valentina until the baddie can succeed in persuading the minister (why they can't just have her locked up in a basement or a building instead of hiring an experienced killer to travel across Europe I have no idea?). But here's the twist: Staham and the girl are forced to wear bracelets that will explode if they walk past 75 feet from the car.Yes, as you can see, the plot makes no sense. But who cares about the plot when you want some action? The incomprehensible plot is all just an excuse to see Staham kick some a--, drive cars at 200 mph and get lovey-dovey with the Ukrainian hostage. The car chases are entertaining enough (particularly the one where Staham has to drive in an angular position to avoid getting sandwiched by two trucks) but the explosive bracelet element adds greater pleasure (and silliness) to the fun. One of my favorite scenes that would never happen in real life is where Staham is fired from his driving service and is forced to ride a conveniently placed bicycle to catch up to the car before he explodes. Then in a really great scene that has to be seen to be believed, Staham and his car take a plunge in the water. To avoid drowning AND blowing up, Staham takes out two rafts from the trunk and fills them up using the tires' air to cause the car to ascend to the surface. Moments later, the car works fine and he drives off after the baddie.To accentuate the pacing and make the action more exciting than it is, Besson and director Oliver Megaton rely on fast-cutting, unconventional angles, flashbacks, dissolves and whirling camera movements to create a kaleidoscope of visual eye-candies that are pleasing, even if implausibility is obvious. In an early scene, when Staham checks on a transporter after crashing through his house, the mere mention of ""Malcolm"" causes the movie to flashback to the scene where Staham rejects a job by Knepper's accomplices, leading to a frantic melee. Besson may not be a smart storyteller but he and his crew are gifted in using visuals and editing to take a potentially disastrous product and turn it into a lean, mean fighting machine.The characterization, as usual in a Besson movie, is two-dimensional but serves its purpose. Knepper makes a nasty villain; Rudakova looks good, even when she mangles English; and Jason Staham is a cool, reserved badass, never laughing but always kicking butt.

The third Transporter film is down right insulting. However, not nearly as bad as the Crank films; Hollywood's attempt to make a ""sleaze film"" main stream, but fails miserably.Transporter 3 pretty much plays out like some over played rap or hip hop song on the radio.

Jason Stratham is a decent actor given the right material. He does good action with the right film/script. The additional character in this film, (the Ukrainian) well...her acting wasn't much better than what you'd see in a third rate, made for cable crap movie on the Sci-Fi channel.

I will have to say that I enjoyed the first two Transporter series better than this one; nevertheless, this one has plenty of the same fighting and driving action that fans of the transporter series has come to expect.  Like all the transporter series, Frank Martin shows his incredible skill in fighting multiple attackers and always seems to finish the fights without even breathing hard.This one had an extra challenge for Frank Martin with a metal bracelet explosive device that is set to go off if he strays 75 feet from the car he is driving.  Natalya Rudakova shares the ride, who also has the same type of metal explosive bracelet on her wrist.In conclusion, if you are a Jason Statham Transporter series fan, you will enjoy seeing this movie.Rating:  4 Stars.

From the beginning to the the very end this movie was unbearably bad.Being a big fan of the original Transporter movie, I was totally disappointed in this sequel.  The plot was ridiculous, the dialogue mind numbing, and the action scenes totally ridiculous.The female co-star, a Eurotrash brain dead girl was extremely annoying.  Her broken English dialogue consisted of talking about food (so annoying) and acting like a teenage brat.  Even the supposeably romantic love scene was totally pathetic, and lacked any real emotion.The action was ok, but hardly made up for the rest of this cestpool of garbage.  Most of the stunts were totally unrealistic and phony. - even more so then the first two movies, imagine that!During one fight scene, our hero gets thrown through a concrete wall and gets up without a scratch..... so ridiculous. In another scene, after the transporter drives his car into a lake to escape the bad guys, he is able to float his car back to the surface, by inflating two duffel bags with air from the tires.  Yeah, thats really going to work on a 3700 lb car.. give me a break.  And then after 2 minutes of tinkering with the engine of a car that was emerged under water for 20 minutes, he is able to start it right up and the car drives like new.... haha.I paid $1 at redbox to rent this movie, and still feel like I've paid too much.

1230341,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B001QB9H10,Mantis,"[2, 5]","I was a fan of Jason Statham before I knew he was even capable of athletic moves in action flicks.  His work in Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" had me thinking he was a pretty cool cat.  When I saw the first ""Transporter"", I thought even better of him.  The original film is all sorts of dumb, which I can handle if the action is well done and the flick has a good sense of ""fun"", and the original had that courtship down pat.  Part 2 was a definite drop in the action and plot department (ripping off 2004's ""Man on Fire"", itself a remake) but was still exciting and enjoyable.  3 has nothing going for it but a group of capable people completely wasting their time and talent.  Written by Luc Besson?!?  Action choreographed by Cory Yuen?!? I would've used a pseudonym, fellas: like Alan Smithee!  It's not Statham's fault this movie's so bad but would it kill him to be a little more selective in the roles he picks?  One more of these and another couple of ""Crank"" films and he'll find himself securely in Direct-to-Video hell.Frank Martin (Statham) is a transporter, taking anything anywhere for a price, under his strict conditions.  When he turns a job over to a friend of his and the dude fails, Frank is forced to complete the agreement himself.  He must drive a girl from Marseilles to Odessa with both of them restricted by electronic wrist tethers to a 75 ft perimeter around Frank's car or the tether will explode.  All in the hopes of getting the girl's father (a Ukrainian politician) to sign off on letting the bad guy's company dump several ships worth of toxic waste into the Black Sea.Again, I can handle dumb.  I would even go so far as to say that there's an art to it.  Unfortunately, Picasso ralphed all over the canvas! And what didn't slop onto the floor is not art, even in the most abstract sense!  The part that angers me the most is the fist-fighting.  In my opinion, everything else can be forgiven if the fights are good.  They are absolutely HORRIBLE!  Some of the sloppiest editing I have EVER seen on film!  None of Statham's atheleticism is shown without being shredded by quick cuts.  Good Hong Kong action will show several moves before changing angles and I don't think one full move was illustrated without interruption!  Epileptics beware!Bad plot involving environmentalism and ridiculously choppy martial arts sequences?  That sounds suspiciously like any number of Steven Seagal movies, doesn't it? In fact, I recently watched Seagal's ""A Dangerous Man"" (2009) and the fights in that were better!  A lot better!  What was I just saying about ""direct-to-video""?  Wesley Snipes was a legitimate actor (and a good one) before he was typecast in action roles, too!The DVD I have (used and cheap, yet I still feel violated) has flip-disc full and widescreen presentation with no special features, and who would watch them anyway?  In English with optional Spanish subtitles.  This is to theatrically released action films what ""The Serpent's Egg"" was to Ingmar Bergman's repertoire!

Rather than use new ideas to make films (tying those up in development Hell), they fall back on the tried and true, using what they call a franchise instead of moving to something different. Such is the case with TRANSPORTER 3.Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin, the highly skilled driver who is willing to transport anything for the right price. Having retired from the business, Frank is pulled in once again when a friend crashes into his house wounded with a girl in tow. He also keeps talking about the car.As an ambulance takes Frank's friend from his home, the girl wakes and tells him the bracelets they were wearing are rigged to the car. As Frank tries to stop the ambulance, it explodes. Going back to question the girl, Frank is knocked unconscious.When he wakes, Frank finds himself in the presence of Johnson (Robert Knepper) who tells him he is not connected to his own car as well. He had tried to contract him for the job originally but failed. Now Frank has no choice but to accept his offer. A new GPS system installed in Frank's car, the girl in the passenger seat and a cell phone dialing only to Johnson start Frank out on another job.While it takes Frank until near films end to realize that the girl is actually the package, most viewers will do so about 30 seconds after the initial car crash into his house. We can also figure out who she is, the daughter of a politician in the Ukraine. It seems that Johnson and his group are trying to blackmail the politician into waiving regulations that would prevent them from dumping toxic waste in his country.Between battles with Johnson's men, with the politician's men and with the girl herself, Frank is lucky to still be around to do the impossible rescue at the end. This is one even James Bond might look at and say ""yeah right like THAT could happen"".The story is not the thing here though. All it serves as is a connecting force between Frank's fisticuffs and the high speed chase sequences. If story were important the first question one might ask is why hire Frank to transport this girl when all the bad guys seem to have no problems crossing borders to keep up with him? Why transport her at all when simply putting her in a cell would suffice?Statham does a great job here. Given that he has little to do except perform a well choreographed fight or two and get intense he should. But at the same time I'll give him credit for bringing a little more humanity to the character than most would have. He's come a long way since he started.The same can't be said for Natalya Rudakova. As Valentina, the girl in question, you would think it would be an easy task to make the character believable and one we care for. She doesn't have the ability to make her lines sound real. And if I hadn't looked it up I would have thought her Russian accent was a lousy one. Now I know that it's legit which means that even after living in New York for some time she hasn't learned the language all that well.Online sources state that she was found working in a salon when Luc Besson, one of the screen writers, came across her. He was supposed to have sent her for acting lessons. He should get his money back. I have the utmost respect for people attempting to act. But this is just downright terrible.All in all the movie delivers the goods if all you want is fast cars and rapid fire fight sequences. If you want a story to go with it, look elsewhere. It's not the worst movie I've seen in a long time but it doesn't live up to the original.",3,THIRD TIME NOT A CHARM,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,3623,"['Hollywood', 'once', 'more', 'attempts', 'milk', 'last', 'drop', 'idea', 'only', 'watch', 'go', 'down', 'flames', 'Rather', 'use', 'new', 'ideas', 'make', 'films', 'tying', 'development', 'Hell', 'fall', 'back', 'tried', 'true', 'using', 'what', 'call', 'franchise', 'instead', 'moving', 'something', 'different', 'Such', 'case', 'TRANSPORTER', '3.Jason', 'Statham', 'back', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'highly', 'skilled', 'driver', 'who', 'willing', 'transport', 'anything', 'right', 'price', 'Having', 'retired', 'business', 'Frank', 'pulled', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'friend', 'house', 'wounded', 'girl', 'tow', 'also', 'talking', 'car.As', 'ambulance', 'Frank', 'friend', 'home', 'girl', 'wakes', 'bracelets', 'were', 'wearing', 'are', 'rigged', 'car', 'Frank', 'stop', 'ambulance', 'Going', 'back', 'question', 'girl', 'Frank', 'knocked', 'Frank', 'presence', 'Johnson', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'who', 'not', 'connected', 'own', 'car', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'tried', 'contract', 'job', 'originally', 'failed', 'Now', 'Frank', 'choice', 'accept', 'offer', 'new', 'GPS', 'system', 'installed', 'Frank', 'car', 'girl', 'passenger', 'seat', 'cell', 'phone', 'dialing', 'only', 'Johnson', 'start', 'Frank', 'out', 'job.While', 'Frank', 'films', 'end', 'realize', 'girl', 'actually', 'package', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'do', 'so', '30', 'seconds', 'initial', 'car', 'crash', 'house', 'can', 'also', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'daughter', 'politician', 'Ukraine', 'Johnson', 'group', 'are', 'trying', 'blackmail', 'politician', 'waiving', 'regulations', 'would', 'prevent', 'dumping', 'toxic', 'waste', 'country.Between', 'battles', 'Johnson', 'men', 'politician', 'men', 'girl', 'herself', 'Frank', 'lucky', 'still', 'be', 'do', 'impossible', 'rescue', 'end', 'one', 'even', 'James', 'Bond', 'might', 'look', 'say', 'yeah', 'right', 'could', 'happen', '.The', 'story', 'not', 'thing', 'here', 'as', 'connecting', 'force', 'Frank', 'fisticuffs', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'sequences', 'story', 'were', 'important', 'first', 'question', 'one', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'hire', 'Frank', 'transport', 'girl', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'seem', 'have', 'problems', 'crossing', 'borders', 'keep', 'up', 'Why', 'transport', 'when', 'simply', 'putting', 'cell', 'would', 'suffice', 'Statham', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Given', 'little', 'do', 'perform', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'two', 'get', 'intense', 'should', 'same', 'time', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'bringing', 'little', 'more', 'humanity', 'character', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Natalya', 'Rudakova', 'Valentina', 'girl', 'question', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'task', 'make', 'character', 'believable', 'one', 'care', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'make', 'lines', 'sound', 'real', 'had', ""n't"", 'looked', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Russian', 'accent', 'was', 'lousy', 'one', 'Now', 'know', 'legit', 'even', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'time', ""n't"", 'learned', 'language', 'well.Online', 'sources', 'state', 'was', 'found', 'working', 'salon', 'when', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'one', 'screen', 'writers', 'came', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'sent', 'acting', 'lessons', 'should', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'have', 'utmost', 'respect', 'people', 'attempting', 'act', 'just', 'downright', 'terrible.All', 'movie', 'goods', 'want', 'fast', 'cars', 'rapid', 'fire', 'fight', 'sequences', 'want', 'story', 'go', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'original']",N/A

I don't get this? Aren't the casting directors supposed to be looking for someone that is camera friendly? I mean no disrespect to the young lady, but I seriously couldn't stand looking at her!

1230352,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B001QB9H10,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[65, 86]","Transporter 3's lead writer (Luc Besson) has a thing for redheads.I came to this conclusion after watching Transporter 3.  I'm a big fan of Besson's science fiction foray,The Fifth Element, and all I could think as I watched the slinky, thickly accented Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) was how Transporter 3 would have been so much better if it had been Milla Jovovich in the role.That I was distracted by the stiff Rudakova's acting is a testament to how much the film insists on zooming in on her, letting her drone on and on in her broken English, and the endless patience that Frank Martin (Jason Statham) seems to have for what amounts to a rich brat in a miniskirt and heels.Oh right, the plot.  So anyway, Martin is a wheelman who does jobs with certain rules. These are all meant to ensure success in Martin's job as a wheelman.  By the time we reach Transporter 3, every one of those rules has been broken.And that's the problem.  The rules made Martin interesting. In Transporter 3, Martin has become a walking parody of himself, fetishized by the director to strip away (literally) everything likable about him, only to replace it with beefcake shots of Statham with his shirt off, whip-cut fight scenes that don't let us see his martial arts prowess, and aggravating supporting characters whom the Martin we know from the first movie would have left on the curb.The gimmick here is that Martin can't just run away from his job because a super-advanced device is connected to his wrist that will blow him up if he is more than 75 feet away from the car. For reasons that only make sense to movie villains, Martin is forced to drive Valentina to a variety of locations, during which they track him constantly.That's right, the bad guys track Martin's every move.  In fact, the movie is obsessed with keeping Martin in the car to the point that the entire universe seems hell bent on keeping him in it. Even the laws of physics are in on this cruel joke, which helpfully bends its laws to allow Frank to do ridiculous things like drive his car on two wheels, float it to the surface using air pressure from its tires alone, and land it on a moving train.The generic villain Johnson (Robert Knepper) is a victim of the So Bads.  As in, he's So Bad that:... he kidnaps drunk college girls!... he shoots his own men when they asks stupid questions!... he's helping sneak toxic waste into Europe!That's right, uber-villains can now hit a new low: they're not just mean to you, they're mean to the environment!The movie just spirals from there.  Valentina, patently unlikable, somehow seduces Martin, who doesn't show the least bit of interest in her.  Given that the ransom picture of Valentina shows her in a schoolgirl's uniform, there's at least a ten-year difference between her and Martin.  Ick.There are so many logic fallacies that you have to wonder if Besson's just mocking his audience. Statham as Europe's answer to the Kung Fu martial artist is just plain awesome -- I loved him inThe Transporterand was willing to forgive the silliness ofTransporter 2-- but this is too much.

I can't ever imagine watching it a second time. There was an attempt to shape actress Kate Nauta into a clone of 80s ""creepy / hot"" Brigitte Nielsen and they succeeded with the first half of that equation but not the second. Franois Berl&eacute;and...in one of the first film's best supporting roles, Inspector Tarconi...was largely played for laughs, some bumbling Inspector Clousea type, and that's not what the character is at all...he's a sly fox, he's the smartest guy in the room.That said, I wasn't anxious to watch part 3 at all, even though I'd read some reviews and knew that there would be no return to the travesty that was part 2.Transporter 3 HAS the car stunts, the fight scenes, and in many ways, Frank is back to being Frank, Tarconi is back to being Tarconi. The film just MOVES at a slower pace, it doesn't crackle with the ""downed power line"" electricity of the first film. That's OK...it's moody and tense, and (in the words of the immortal ""Farm Film Report"" critics from SCTV, ""things blow up real good.""Natalya Rudakova isn't Shu Qi (from the first film). The ""chemistry"" between her character Valentina and Frank is a bit forced...when I was an English major in college I became very familiar with the term ""suspension of disbelief."" You basically have to turn off your ""reality filters"" to enjoy good (or bad) fiction. I believed the romantic tension and heat between Statham and Shu Qi in the first film, I don't believe the Rudakova-Statham pairing. The film uses a gimmick as old as the world itself (Valentina is ridiculously annoying until we ""learn her story"" and ""see her vulberability"" and then we're supposed to want to snuggle her and tell her everything is OK).The feeling I got at the end of Transporter 3...WITHOUT offering you any spoilers...was ""OK, 3 is enough. The franchise doesn't end with the sour aftertaste of the second movie.""It MAY simply be that the first film was a fluke...serendipity...a convergence of all the right elements into a fun whole.

Well, Transporter 3 is a slight improvement, as Jason Statham returns as driver extraordinaire Frank Martin.  This time around, Frank is forced into driving a kidnapped girl (Natalya Rudakova) by a mysterious man named Johnson (Prison Break's Robert Knepper).  The catch is that both she and Frank have electronic bracelets stuck on them that will explode if either leaves a certain distance from Frank's car.  Yeah, Statham's other action franchise Crank kind of comes to mind here a little bit in terms of the plot, but for the most part, Transporter 3 delivers the action goods, which is a good thing considering that the script and dialogue are pretty lousy and we have to contend with the pretty and annoying Rudakova.  Statham however still manages to be instantly likeable and imposing, and Francois Berleand returns as Inspector Tarconi to lend some comic relief as well, and the closing action sequences are worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, if you enjoyed either of the previous Transporter films, chances are you'll enjoy what Transporter 3 has to offer.

He does action movies very well and would have made a great James Bond.  I enjoyed the first two Transporter movies and was expecting to enjoy this one.  Unfortunately, I disliked Transporter 3.One of the main reasons is the love interest, Natalya Rudakova, is not particularly attractive.  Moreover, her accent got on my nerves almost from the start.  I usually don't mind accents; in fact the love interest in the first Transporter film had an accent and I liked her, but this one got very annoying very quick.In addition, the plot was too stupid.  Its an action movie and I am not really expecting too much in the way of a plot, but come on!  At one point in the movie, Jason Statham's character opens the bag he is supposed to be transporting and finds phone books and then realizes that the woman accompanying him is in fact the ""package"" that he is transporting.  Well duh!  Didn't he watch the first Transporter movie in which a woman was the ""package""?  Its stuff like this that made it difficult to watch - I can suspend disbelief only up to a point.  Also, the gimmick of the movie, in which he wears a bracelet that will explode if he strays too far from his car is very reminiscint of his Crank movies.Corey Yuen (choreographer for the Matrix) does a good job with the fight scenes, but even those weren't as inventive as the previous Transporter movies.",2,Worth viewing but not owning,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,1428,"['like', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'movies', 'action', 'movies', 'very', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'James', 'Bond', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'Transporter', 'movies', 'was', 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'disliked', 'Transporter', '3.One', 'main', 'reasons', 'love', 'interest', 'Natalya', 'Rudakova', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'Moreover', 'accent', 'got', 'nerves', 'almost', 'start', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'accents', 'fact', 'love', 'interest', 'first', 'Transporter', 'film', 'had', 'accent', 'liked', 'one', 'got', 'very', 'annoying', 'very', 'quick.In', 'addition', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'stupid', 'action', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'plot', 'come', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'character', 'bag', 'supposed', 'be', 'transporting', 'phone', 'books', 'then', 'woman', 'accompanying', 'fact', 'package', 'transporting', 'Well', 'duh', 'Did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'Transporter', 'movie', 'woman', 'was', 'package', 'stuff', 'made', 'difficult', 'watch', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'only', 'up', 'point', 'Also', 'gimmick', 'movie', 'bracelet', 'will', 'explode', 'too', 'far', 'car', 'very', 'reminiscint', 'Crank', 'movies.Corey', 'Yuen', 'choreographer', 'Matrix', 'good', 'job', 'fight', 'scenes', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'inventive', 'previous', 'Transporter', 'movies']",N/A

It is as if the producers felt that they had to borrow elements of Crank and Death Race to assure that the series' fans wouldn't desert it.Statham again plays Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces soldier who lives in Marseilles and works as a ""Transporter,"" someone who delivers merchandise in his black Audi no questions asked. This time, he is forced to deliver a package in the trunk, and a young woman sitting in the back seat. He and the woman are fitted with bracelets that will explode if either one strays too far from Martin's vehicle. Martin struggles to figure out what is going on with his forced clients, the identity of the girl, who isn't forthcoming with information, and how to remove the bracelets without killing himself and the girl.Because of the lack of confidence of the producers, we are forced to endure not just car chases and crashes, but way over-the-top car stunts reminiscent of the Death Race film, and the bracelet device smacks of Crank, where Statham was a hit man injected with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops, causing him to move at a frenetic pace for most of that film so he won't die. In this film, Statham has to perform all kinds of stunts to keep up with the vehicle so he won't blow up.Fortunately, the film is also keeps the martial arts action, witty script, and the endearing relationship between Martin and local detective Tarconi, played by Francois Berleand. Also, the woman, played by Natalya Rudokova, is charming enough to help overcome some of the irritation at the film's imitations.Transporter 3 is worth seeing, but if there is a fourth film, one hopes that the film will find ways to revitalize without cannibalizing the star's other films.",4,Derivative But Still Entertaining Continuation of The Frank Martin Saga,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,2008,"['Transporter', '3', 'high-action', 'action', 'film', 'off', 'what', 'been', 'endearing', 'traits', 'caused', 'series', 'be', 'hit', 'theater', 'worldwide', 'good', 'thing', 'episode', 'series', 'suffers', 'too', 'much', 'imitation', 'star', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'other', 'films', 'producers', 'felt', 'had', 'borrow', 'elements', 'Crank', 'Death', 'Race', 'assure', 'series', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'desert', 'it.Statham', 'again', 'plays', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'ex-Special', 'Forces', 'soldier', 'who', 'Marseilles', 'Transporter', 'someone', 'who', 'merchandise', 'black', 'Audi', 'questions', 'asked', 'time', 'forced', 'deliver', 'package', 'trunk', 'young', 'woman', 'sitting', 'back', 'seat', 'woman', 'are', 'fitted', 'bracelets', 'will', 'explode', 'one', 'strays', 'too', 'far', 'Martin', 'vehicle', 'Martin', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'forced', 'clients', 'identity', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'forthcoming', 'information', 'how', 'remove', 'bracelets', 'killing', 'girl.Because', 'lack', 'confidence', 'producers', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'not', 'just', 'car', 'chases', 'crashes', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'car', 'stunts', 'reminiscent', 'Death', 'Race', 'film', 'bracelet', 'device', 'smacks', 'Crank', 'where', 'Statham', 'was', 'hit', 'man', 'injected', 'poison', 'will', 'kill', 'heart', 'rate', 'drops', 'causing', 'move', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'most', 'film', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'film', 'Statham', 'perform', 'kinds', 'stunts', 'keep', 'up', 'vehicle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'up.Fortunately', 'film', 'also', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'witty', 'script', 'endearing', 'relationship', 'Martin', 'local', 'detective', 'Tarconi', 'played', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'Also', 'woman', 'played', 'Natalya', 'Rudokova', 'charming', 'enough', 'help', 'overcome', 'irritation', 'film', 'imitations.Transporter', '3', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fourth', 'film', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'ways', 'revitalize', 'cannibalizing', 'star', 'other', 'films']",N/A
1230383,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001QB9H10,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","While it would be no great feat to best its predecessor, Transporter 3 so efficiently surpasses it in every way that this third outing comes across as a far better movie than it actually is.  But for those saddened by the lackluster turn the franchise took in its second installment, the third brings Frank Martin back to his outlandish (but not completely ridiculous) brand of martial arts mayhem, crazy femmes, and 200 miles-per-hour car chases.Frank Martin (Jason Statham) returns to his life of strict rules and transporting dangerous goods, but this time out his mission isn't voluntary.  When Frank turns down a job from the mysterious Mr. Johnson (Robert Knepper), he's unwittingly drawn back in when his replacement winds up dead.  Forced to escort the kidnapped daughter of a high-ranking Ukrainian official from Marseilles to Odessa on the Black Sea, Frank must contend with Johnson's brutish thugs, the police, and government agents, as well as the advances from his rather aggressive passenger (Natalya Rudakova).The familiar circle fights return in the third theatrical adventure of Frank Martin, again choreographed by martial artist Cory Yuen. The directors, writers, and other creative positions may change, but the familiar fight sequences in which Statham is slowly surrounded by a squad of angry thugs remains unaltered.  Even though there is little to believe about the martial arts sequences, it seems that the overly outlandish (though creative) setups in the first two episodes are absent, infusing the most miniscule hint of reality back into an idea that dwelled foremost on ""cool"" over sensible.When his initially uncooperative passenger finally decides to speak, she explains she's a realist. The irony couldn't be thicker as every action surrounding Frank is canvassed with a layer of disbelief, over-the-top divinity and utter immortality. Following the pattern of the later Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and the earlier Steven Seagal films in which audiences never have to worry about the amount of damage the hero will sustain (usually nothing), Transporter 3 doesn't allow a moment to worry about the affliction-immune Martin. And as a mindless adventure film it works better that way, keeping the tone light and contrasting Frank's absolute seriousness while the most ridiculous crises roil around him.While the plot is still evil conspiracy silliness, the girl is practically insane, and Frank's uncanny ability to lose his shirt in every fight hasn't disappeared, Transporter 3 surprisingly learns from its predecessors' major mistakes.  The music is more fun, the villain is actually villainous, the one-liners won't make you cringe, and the action remains creative without breaching the line of lunacy.  Transporter 3 isn't the greatest action movie ever made, but after the atrocious results of Frank's second adventure, it's still mighty impressive.- The Massie Twins",4,Transporter 3 Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,2905,"['would', 'be', 'no', 'great', 'feat', 'best', 'predecessor', 'Transporter', '3', 'so', 'efficiently', 'way', 'third', 'outing', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'actually', 'saddened', 'lackluster', 'turn', 'franchise', 'took', 'second', 'installment', 'third', 'brings', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'back', 'outlandish', 'not', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'brand', 'martial', 'arts', 'mayhem', 'crazy', 'femmes', '200', 'miles-per-hour', 'car', 'chases.Frank', 'Martin', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'life', 'strict', 'rules', 'transporting', 'dangerous', 'goods', 'time', 'out', 'mission', ""n't"", 'voluntary', 'When', 'Frank', 'down', 'job', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Johnson', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'unwittingly', 'drawn', 'back', 'when', 'replacement', 'up', 'dead', 'Forced', 'escort', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'high-ranking', 'Ukrainian', 'official', 'Marseilles', 'Odessa', 'Black', 'Sea', 'Frank', 'must', 'contend', 'Johnson', 'brutish', 'thugs', 'police', 'government', 'agents', 'as', 'well', 'advances', 'rather', 'aggressive', 'passenger', 'Natalya', 'Rudakova', '.The', 'familiar', 'circle', 'fights', 'return', 'third', 'theatrical', 'adventure', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'again', 'choreographed', 'martial', 'artist', 'Cory', 'Yuen', 'directors', 'writers', 'other', 'creative', 'positions', 'may', 'change', 'familiar', 'fight', 'sequences', 'Statham', 'slowly', 'surrounded', 'squad', 'angry', 'thugs', 'unaltered', 'Even', 'little', 'believe', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'overly', 'outlandish', 'creative', 'setups', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'absent', 'infusing', 'most', 'miniscule', 'hint', 'reality', 'back', 'idea', 'dwelled', 'foremost', 'cool', 'initially', 'uncooperative', 'passenger', 'finally', 'speak', 'realist', 'irony', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'thicker', 'action', 'surrounding', 'Frank', 'canvassed', 'layer', 'disbelief', 'over-the-top', 'divinity', 'utter', 'immortality', 'Following', 'pattern', 'later', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'movies', 'earlier', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'films', 'audiences', 'never', 'have', 'worry', 'amount', 'damage', 'hero', 'will', 'sustain', 'usually', 'nothing', '3', ""n't"", 'allow', 'moment', 'worry', 'affliction-immune', 'Martin', 'mindless', 'adventure', 'film', 'better', 'way', 'keeping', 'tone', 'light', 'contrasting', 'Frank', 'absolute', 'seriousness', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'crises', 'roil', 'plot', 'still', 'evil', 'conspiracy', 'silliness', 'girl', 'practically', 'insane', 'Frank', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'lose', 'shirt', 'fight', ""n't"", 'disappeared', 'Transporter', '3', 'surprisingly', 'predecessors', 'major', 'mistakes', 'music', 'more', 'fun', 'villain', 'actually', 'villainous', 'one-liners', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'cringe', 'action', 'creative', 'breaching', 'line', 'lunacy', 'Transporter', '3', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'action', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'atrocious', 'results', 'Frank', 'second', 'adventure', 'still', 'mighty', 'impressive.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1230389,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B001QB9H10,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[6, 8]","Movie - 4.0I really like the Transporter franchise. Its B-movie nature from the mind and pen of one Luc Besson has always been an entertaining escapist romp for me. The series has always been quasi-serious, but often silly enough that we realize it's all in good fun. Whether Frank Martin is saving Chinese refugees or stopping an archetypal Colombian hitman from unleashing a deadly virus, he always does so in such style thanks in huge part to the cool cars he drives, his spiffy suits, and the always-welcomed martial arts choreography of Hong Kong legend Cory Yuen. However, Transporter 3 takes somewhat of a different road in terms of its tone. One of the things I noticed from the first time I saw the trailer was the cinematography. With that said, this 3rd installment is easily the darkest so far. Don't let that fool you, though. The film still has its campy elements and occasional cheese. We see Frank do his thing having to transport more human cargo, getting into situations where butt-kicking is required, make a few wise cracks, and even get some cool chase sequences in and out of the car. But the big difference here is the philosophical approach it tries to take as represented by the interaction of Frank and Valentina. Throughout the franchise, we've seen Frank as a man of rules and principles. Here, we see the opposite in a young, unabashed, free-living Valentina. I actually like what her character's purpose is in trying to open Frank up a little more as a person (like Lai in the first film), but I seriously wish they had picked a different actress. Contrary to the cute and perky innocence Shu Qi has in Transporter 1, I often had a hard time accepting Natalya Rudakova's performance. It's not the Ukrainian accent and broken English, or even the crazy amount of freckles that bring her down, it's the angst. Granted, rich and spoiled teenage brat characters usually are angsty, but refer back to Shu Qi's performance (which is unequivocally the same role), and the comparison should speak for itself.Video - 5.0It's sad that the first two films fell under the MPEG-2 encode when they were released as some of Fox's flagship titles. Thankfully, though, Blu-ray has come a long way since then, which is reflected in the video presentation given to us by Lionsgate. With the movie itself being very recent and the current availability of MPEG-4 AVC, we get an absolutely pristine picture. Colors aren't too vibrant, what with the darker tone and photography, but it's more than made up for by everything else. Black levels are among the deepest I've seen to date. Frank's suit, the sleek paint on his Audi A8, even the tread in the tires all carry a great level of detail and delineation between one texture and the next. Contrast is just right in keeping other image details visible, while still maintaining the film's gritty look. And while flesh tones do appear reddish, it's not nearly as bad as the first movie, and in my opinion, actually helps in accentuating some of the finer details such as the face-stubble and ripped muscles of Statham or the heavy eyeliner and freckles of Rudakova, even through that fine layer of theatrical grain. No image enhancements or manipulation are apparent either, making this a showcase BD.Audio - 5.0The interesting thing about this 7.1 DTS-HD track is its spaciousness. Normally, a typical sound design will have 3 elements: dialogue in the center channel, music and sound effects from the fronts and side, and LFEs in the subwoofer. Here, we actually have the sound design separated into 4 different channels individually: music from the rear and sides, sound effects from the front, dialogue in the center, and LFEs in the sub. As a result, it creates a very unique kind of immersion. One factor I've always liked in the franchise is the music, not so much the score (which still isn't bad), but the Euro-techno stuff playing in the background, which is displaced perfectly throughout the back 4 speakers. Dialogue is clear and never a problem from the center, though some viewers may find it awkward that the sound effects are limited to just the front of the sound stage. However, bass levels are surprisingly thunderous and help make up for that, particularly the thuds and thumps when Statham kicks a guy right in the gut. I don't think I've ever had a sound effect outside of an explosion or piece of machinery make a sound like that, which is pretty invigorating. Then of course are the cars, gunshots, etc. that also sound flawless just to top things off for an otherwise, reference track.Extras - 3.0Also a new addition from the previous Transporter BDs is the presence of some actual special features. It's not much, but the commentary from director Olivier Megaton, and the two behind-the-scenes featurettes are appreciated. Throughout his commentary, Megaton breaks down the overall filming process very well and makes the movie much more appreciable than I initially felt before giving it a listen. I just wish they turned a lot of his commentary into a more in-depth making of-segment as opposed to a vocal-only presentation. The ""Real World Transporter"" feature is interesting, but a bit of a downer. It essentially de-glamorizes the concept of Frank Martin's character and tries to instill this feeling of rough and tough, but with absolutely no benefits to the lifestyle whatsoever. The ""Making of Transporter 3"" is more or less what Megaton covers in his commentary, which I still think is a little short in length in itself. But then again, any kind of extras for movies of this caliber are better than nothing.Overall - 4.5I think this 3rd installment actually could've been the best of the franchise. It still carries enough of the B-movie campiness and charm, but takes it up a level by trying to make the atmosphere much darker. Unfortunately, the female lead doesn't quite make it as enjoyable for me as I would've liked, but still think it's a good movie for what it's worth. Can they make another one? Sure. But given the mixed levels of critical response and the fact that most movie franchises like to do things in 3s, I wouldn't be surprised if Statham decided to move on, if not for one more appearance as Chev Chelios, then at least beyond his role as Frank Martin into another action role. With reference A/V quality and a decent amount of extras, Transporter 3 comes recommended to fans.",5,Transporter 3 (Blu-ray),1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,6391,"['Movie', '4.0I', 'really',

1230390,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001QB9H10,trebe,"[0, 0]","Jason Statham returns as wheelman extraordinaire Frank Martin, in The Transporter 3 (2009) the third installment in the high-octane Transporter series.  Written by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita) and Mark Robert Kamen, the film is directed by Frenchman Olivier Megaton (Red Siren).Reality is not a major factor in a Transporter film.  The objective is to arrange a situation where the immaculately dressed Martin has to accomplish a task involving driving a car, and let the man do his thing.  There is usually a hot babe involved, and Martin typically makes a few stops along the way, where some wildly stylized fights, choreographed by the expert Corey Yuen take place.  The only one that Martin usually relies on for help is detective inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand).  This is the basic setup for the film.After being in Miami for the Transporter 2, Martin has returned to France, and is at home when a car crashes through his house.  The seriously injured driver taken away in an ambulance, but is killed when an explosive bracelet he is wearing, gets too far from his car.  Inside the damaged vehicle is a sullen red-haired Ukrainian woman named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova, in her feature film debut).  Martin and the girl are captured, and taken to a man named Johnson (Robert Knepper), who offers the Transporter a choice between a driving assignment, or a bullet in the brain.  Very shortly Martin is back behind the wheel of his black Audi, with Valentina as a passenger.  Travelling through France bound for some unspecified destination, each has an explosive bracket clamped to their wrist.  Along the way, there are some wild frantic, teeth clenching vehicular maneuvers, spectacularly executed fights, a striptease, and a few fascinating discussions of cuisine.The script delivers mostly what you expect from a Transporter film, comic book action, crazy stunts, stylized quick cut fight choreography with some unusual weapons, and edgy seat of your pants driving.  Like the previous outings, there's not a lot of reality to the plot, as Martin's car rises from being submerged in the middle of a lake, is still fully functional, and later jumps onto a train, and then between moving sections of the train.  Frank's relationship with his buddy Tarconi, is one of the few things that grounds the series.  The soft spoken wheelman usually doesn't get into deep conversations.  Attempting to do so with Valentina, who's ability to speak English seems to come and go, is a challenge that is almost painful.  Johnson the main baddie, is often just a voice on the phone making threats.  Robert Knepper does what he can with a role that has very little meat.Fans of the franchise, expecting over the top action to the point of absurdity, will have few issues with the third and perhaps final entry in the series, as Statham's ample physical skills are again put to good use, and his black Audi is again pushed to the limits.  Transporter 3 is not a great film by any means, but it is an entertaining one, although the way the Valentina character is written, is questionable as a real asset to the story.",3,out for a jaunt with a Ukrainian gourmet...,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,3112,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'wheelman', 'extraordinaire', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'Transporter', '3', '2009', 'third', 'installment', 'high-octane', 'Transporter', 'series', 'Written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Mark', 'Robert', 'Kamen', 'film', 'directed', 'Frenchman', 'Olivier', 'Megaton', 'Red', 'Siren', '.Reality', 'not', 'major', 'factor', 'Transporter', 'film', 'objective', 'arrange', 'situation', 'where', 'immaculately', 'dressed', 'Martin', 'accomplish', 'task', 'involving', 'driving', 'car', 'let', 'man', 'do', 'thing', 'usually', 'hot', 'babe', 'involved', 'Martin', 'typically', 'few', 'stops', 'way', 'where', 'wildly', 'stylized', 'fights', 'choreographed', 'expert', 'Corey', 'Yuen', 'take', 'place', 'only', 'one', 'Martin', 'usually', 'help', 'detective', 'inspector', 'Tarconi', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'basic', 'setup', 'film.After', 'being', 'Miami', 'Transporter', '2', 'Martin', 'returned', 'France', 'home', 'when', 'car', 'crashes', 'house', 'seriously', 'injured', 'driver', 'taken', 'away', 'ambulance', 'killed', 'when', 'explosive', 'bracelet', 'wearing', 'too', 'far', 'car', 'damaged', 'vehicle', 'sullen', 'red-haired', 'Ukrainian', 'woman', 'named', 'Valentina', 'Natalya', 'Rudakova', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Martin', 'girl', 'are', 'captured', 'taken', 'man', 'named', 'Johnson', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'who', 'Transporter', 'choice', 'driving', 'assignment', 'bullet', 'brain', 'Very', 'shortly', 'Martin', 'back', 'wheel', 'black', 'Audi', 'Valentina', 'passenger', 'Travelling', 'France', 'bound', 'unspecified', 'destination', 'explosive', 'bracket', 'clamped', 'wrist', 'way', 'are', 'wild', 'frantic', 'teeth', 'clenching', 'vehicular', 'maneuvers', 'spectacularly', 'executed', 'fights', 'striptease', 'few', 'fascinating', 'discussions', 'cuisine.The', 'script', 'delivers', 'mostly', 'what', 'expect', 'Transporter', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'crazy', 'stunts', 'stylized', 'quick', 'cut', 'fight', 'choreography', 'unusual', 'weapons', 'edgy', 'seat', 'pants', 'driving', 'previous', 'outings', 'not', 'lot', 'reality', 'plot', 'Martin', 'car', 'being', 'submerged', 'middle', 'lake', 'still', 'fully', 'functional', 'later', 'jumps', 'train', 'then', 'moving', 'sections', 'train', 'Frank', 'relationship', 'buddy', 'Tarconi', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'series', 'soft', 'spoken', 'wheelman', 'usually', ""n't"", 'get', 'deep', 'conversations', 'Attempting', 'do', 'so', 'Valentina', 'who', 'ability', 'speak', 'English', 'come', 'go', 'challenge', 'almost', 'painful', 'Johnson', 'main', 'baddie', 'often', 'just', 'voice', 'phone', 'making', 'threats', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'very', 'little', 'meat.Fans', 'franchise', 'expecting', 'top', 'action', 'point', 'absurdity', 'will', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'third', 'perhaps', 'final', 'entry', 'series', 'Statham', 'ample', 'physical', 'skills', 'are', 'again', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'black', 'Audi', 'again', 'pushed', 'limits', 'Transporter', '3', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'means', 'entertaining', 'one', 'way', 'Valentina', 'character', 'written', 'questionable', 'real', 'asset', 'story']",N/A

This time, however, ever dependable Frank is forced to his job, with a mysterious Ukrainian girl Valentina (newcomer Natalya Rudakova) by his side, and an explosive device strapped on his wrist. Frank must follow the orders of a villain (Robert Knepper, T-Bag of ""Prison Break""), whose motive is unclear even after the film ends.The stunt people (including the martial arts fight choreographer Corey Yuen) did a great job. There is one fantastic car stunt sequence involving two trailer trucks, and actions themselves are respectable. However, director Olivier Megaton single-handedly ruined everything, employing the flashy camera work and super-fast editing that makes no sense at all. Who wants to see fast-forwarded footage of car chase scene? The poorly-edited film is an insult to the stunt people and their wonderful work.One thing must be said about the character of Valentina played by Natalya Rudakova. I have nothing against her personally, but honestly, her ""Valentina"" is one of the most irritating, obnoxious characters I have ever seen on screen, with her perpetually grumbling, drinking and peeing (in a store), and lengthy dialogue about food with Frank. For this kind of role to succeed, you need someone of Cate Blanchett's caliber.The only good thing is Robert Knepper playing the delightfully evil villain quite effectively and, of course, the star Jason Statham, who hasn't lost his charisma even in this mess. He takes off his shirt in the film (twice), but you know he just doesn't need to do that, to be always cool Frank Martin.",1,The Only Good Thing Is Jason Statham,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,1890,"['Having', 'seen', 'two', 'entertaining', 'Transporter', 'films', 'was', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'Transporter', '3', 'not', 'illogical', 'script', 'co-written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'new', 'director', 'Olivier', 'Megaton', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deliver', 'actions.Frank', 'Martin', 'played', 'cool', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'back', 'time', 'however', 'ever', 'dependable', 'Frank', 'forced', 'job', 'mysterious', 'Ukrainian', 'girl', 'Valentina', 'newcomer', 'Natalya', 'Rudakova', 'side', 'explosive', 'device', 'strapped', 'wrist', 'Frank', 'must', 'follow', 'orders', 'villain', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'T-Bag', 'Prison', 'Break', 'motive', 'unclear', 'even', 'film', 'ends.The', 'stunt', 'people', 'including', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'Corey', 'Yuen', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'fantastic', 'car', 'stunt', 'sequence', 'involving', 'two', 'trailer', 'trucks', 'actions', 'are', 'respectable', 'However', 'director', 'Olivier', 'Megaton', 'single-handedly', 'ruined', 'everything', 'employing', 'flashy', 'camera', 'work', 'super-fast', 'editing', 'sense', 'Who', 'see', 'fast-forwarded', 'footage', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'poorly-edited', 'film', 'insult', 'stunt', 'people', 'wonderful', 'work.One', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'character', 'Valentina', 'played', 'Natalya', 'Rudakova', 'have', 'nothing', 'personally', 'honestly', 'Valentina', 'one', 'most', 'irritating', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'perpetually', 'grumbling', 'drinking', 'peeing', 'store', 'lengthy', 'dialogue', 'food', 'Frank', 'kind', 'role', 'succeed', 'need', 'someone', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'caliber.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'playing', 'delightfully', 'evil', 'villain', 'quite', 'effectively', 'course', 'star', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'who', ""n't"", 'lost', 'charisma', 'even', 'mess', 'shirt', 'film', 'twice', 'know', 'just', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'be', 'always', 'cool', 'Frank', 'Martin']",N/A

The first Transporter was a great film that made me have faith in movies. The second was a filled with scenes that felt forced and felt like filler.  The latest installment continues the story of the Transporter.  I found the film to be a great addition to the series with some great action sequences but beyond that it felt a little oversimplified and forced.  The plot is a stretch but intrigues none the less creating seems that are quick and sharp.  His co-star was strange and was a pain in the...but I found her quite interesting. In no way shape or form did this movie delivered a worthy installment but it did it's job...it entertained. Jason, a great talent, is the only attraction that drove some to the big screen.
