A remake of THE LION IN WINTER, the 1968 masterpiece starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, is such time.  Nothing in this movie comes remotely close to the original.  In taking the role as Henry II, Patrick Stewart continues a line of miscasting messes that have included his trying and failing to best Gregory Peck's Ahab in a remake of MOBY DICK, and trying and failing to make a credible Ebenezer Scrooge while falling well short of George C. Scott's masterful portrayal in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.Glen Close is just awful! When compared to Katherine Hepburn, Close is like having a tuna sandwich when lobster is on the menu!The rest of the cast is equally abysmal.

824910,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000255LIY,Dai-keag-ity,"[4, 6]","As much as I struggled to see this 2004 production without comparing it to the 1960's classic which starred Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn, Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry, and Timothy Dalton, the shade of the earlier, better film kept intruding into my thoughts, so let me get the comparisons out of the way here in the beginning. Yes, the `60's version of The Lion In Winter is the better of the two movies, though I also rate this `00's version five stars and don't hesitate to recommend it as an addition to anyone's DVD library. It's a fine, artsy, stunning piece of witty drama that depicts the murderous side of the an irreparably dysfunctional nuclear family, circa 1183 AD.That out of the way, let me say that the 2004 film was far more visually colorful than its ancestor, its sets grander, the twelfth-century more detailed, the recreation of the high era of the Age of Faith was notably loving in the hands of its superb crew. This motion picture was as gorgeous to look at as it was to watch. (Meaning the human cast often took bottom billing to the sheer might and intricacy of the setting.)  If only the actors had held up their end as well, this might have done the near-impossible and surpassed all recent on-screen presentations of the Medieval world.Sadly, the weakness lies in The Lion in Winter's casting and acting. Patrick Stewart, a masterful thespian with a commanding voice, a great actor under most circumstances, was, I'm astonished to see myself write, among the most glaring trouble spots in the presentation. Stewart was simply wrong as Henry II. He chose to portray England's most volatile king with a light, comedic merriness that delivered a great man as an unbelievable braggart. And though no Hepburn, Glenn Close was also sub-par as Eleanor, yet I found her a better match for her part than Patrick Stewart was as Henry II. And was it just me or did it often seem Close was trying to give her best Hepburn impression in this role? Better a good Close than a bad Hepburn, as an acting coach might say.A cast member I did enjoy watching was Julia Vysotsky, as Alyse, sister of the king of France, mistress of Henry, the father of her one-time betrothed. Vysotsky is a lovely Russian actress who did a French accent well and played her part with the right mix of delicate vulnerability and covert viciousness, one moment decrying her circumstances as a pawn in the game of politics, the next urging Henry to exterminate his sons then and there on Christmas Day. Male viewers, lesbians, and assorted connoisseurs of the female form will be pleasantly surprised at her topless scene and find it a plus that it came so close to the start of the movie.The one person I truly wish had not been in this movie at all is Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, as King Philippe Auguste. I have liked this actor well enough in other roles, notably the one in Woody Allen's Match Point, but here Rhys-Meyers plays one of France's great monarchs while looking like some sort of post-modern Jesus and acting like a present-day Hollywood enfant terrible. The way he repeatedly releases his seething ""take-me-seriously-damn-you"" anger makes him seem bratty and silly, unlike Timothy Dalton's handling of the part in the 1960's production with his frigidly contained hatred of the Plantagenet's being a distantly frightening thing to behold. Rhys-Meyers did have a brilliant moment, however, when he is seen smugly chuckling to himself from his chair across the great hall of Chinon as he watches Richard and John, two future kings, bickering over who will succeed their still-living father, and one can all but read Phillipe's mind as his notions of Gallic superiority are once more reinforced. In witnessing the pettiness of the two rivals, Philippe becomes all the more certain that to attain his eventual victory over England, all he need do is outlive Henry, and wait...Another brief but impressive moment unique to this version of The Lion In Winter came early on when the camera panned back from a by then emptying great hall to show Henry's crown lying alone on a table, and it was striking how up close the object of so much ambition looked like such a small battered thing unworthy of all the fuss over it, as if someone somewhere was commenting on what a paltry thing a kingship is.A final, smarmy note is that the cast of the 2004 Lion In Winter was nearly all English, and I expect this was made so in order to lend a certain authenticity to a story set among feuding claimants to the English throne, and yet the irony is if authenticity was sought, French accents might have been more apt, since Henry, Eleanor, and their sons, including the fabled Richard the Lionhearted of Robin Hood fame, were all French, not English, and even the setting for the play, Chinon Castle, is in France, near the Loire River. (And still standing to this day.)The 2004 version of The Lion In Winter stands well on its own but suffers in comparison to its predecessor. It's worth the long run time and contains some nice moments. It's visually appealing and in a few moments does get a little boring, but I think anyone who loves this ingenious story and the period in which it's set will quickly forgive these flaws. I'm glad it was made, and I'm glad I got to see it after having it on my list for several years.",5,The Lion In Winter,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,5312,"['As', 'much', 'struggled', 'see', '2004',

Though some would say, ""Why make another version of the 1968 Hepburn/O'Toole award winning movie"", to those I would ask, ""Why continue to reprise the the superb play by James Goldman in theaters around the country?"" Simply, the play is just that good - an exciting mix of history as explored through the dysfunctional family syndrome tying it all together.The photography of France (as viewed through Slovakia and Hungary settings) in the late 12th century is magnificent, both in exteriors ( Eleanor's entrance on the barge is as grand as Cleopatra's any day!) and in the dank and dark interiors that serve the plot so well.  Glenn Close is radiant and in pitch perfect form as Eleanor of Aquitane, the Queen of England to Henry II's King (Patrick Stewart is fine fettle) and  who has been imprisoned for 10 years for 'treason'.  The couple  has three sons and one must be named Henry's successor, but which one - Richard (historically to be known as The Lionhearted), the wily Jeffrey, or the buffoon but beloved of Henry,  John? (All three of these roles are in capable hands). Eleanor is released from her prison castle for a Christmas Celebration and the entire play takes place during these two stormy days.  The struggle of equally powerful wills of Eleanor and Henry are superimposed on the greed of the three sons, and made more pointed by the arrival of the King of France, Philip (played with complete credibility by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Intrigue abounds, secrets long held are made known, and treachery is omnipresent.  But in the midst of this fascinating exposure of monarch history between France and England author Goldman has written dialogue so razor sharp that it suggests Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"": the duets between Eleanor and Henry, the trios and quartets among the brothers and parents, and especially moments like the revelation of the homoerotic relationship between Richard and King Philip are pure theater in the finest sense of the term.

However, it was so bad that comparisons were just inevitable.  One disclaimer:  I couldn't finish watching this movie.  It was that bad.The plot itself:  Yes, there were some changes but nothing major.  Some of the speeches were done in different places in the original (most of Geoffrey's lines).  I didn't find anything wrong with that at all.Patrick Stewart as Henry II:  I really only got this movie because of him.  I love him as an actor and his roles are always played well.  Except for this.  His lines were delivered flippantly.  He played it like it was a tongue-in-cheek rendition.Glenn Close as Eleanor:  Her acting was just bad.  She didn't seem to care about anything either.  It was as  if she memorized the lines but didn't understand what they meant, so the delivery was flat.  The lines needed a underlying venom or bite that was sadly lacking.The boys:  Richard was just bad casting.  He was a weasely looking guy and he just came across as mean and surly.  There was no range with this character.  Geoffrey was close to right.  In his case it was just that he wasn't John Castle.  Prince John was just plain bad.  You could actually tell that he was  trying to act.  He was supposed to be a snivelling schemer, but the guy who played him in Lion2 played him as a buffoon.Actually, throughout the movie the actors  were either quoting their lines by rote or they were fumbling along.  There was no FEELING anywhere or for anything, yet the events that transpired were supposed to be vitally important to all of them.In the original, you could feel the love/hate between all the characters, especially Henry and Eleanor.  It was palpable.  In Lion2 there really is no emotion.As some have already stated, you could see that this whole production was done on a hollywood set.

824921,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B000255LIY,John D. Cofield,"[3, 4]","Any depiction of The Lion in Winter must inevitably be compared with the magnificent 1968 production starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn.  This version starring Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close has some  significant departures from the 1969 gold standard, but nevertheless manages to be a superb dramatization in its own right.Its Christmas, 1183, and King Henry II of England has called his family together for a happy holiday season. The problem is, he has his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine in prison, and she and their three sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, are all thirsting for power.  The King is growing old (he was to die in 1187) and he wants his youngest son John to succeed him.  Eleanor's favorite is their oldest son Richard, while the middle boy Geoffrey is biding his time and waiting for his chance.  Adding to the complications is the presence of Princess Alais of France, who was supposed to marry Richard but who has become King Henry's mistress, and her brother King Philip of France, 18 years old but already a master of intrigue and deceit.While this version lacks some of the fabulous chemistry and sparkle provided by O'Toole and Hepburn, it makes up for it by the deeper, more somber interaction of Stewart and Close.  This version doesn't make me laugh as much as the 1968 version does, but it definitely has an even deeper sense of gravitas and irony.  Both dramatizations are superb, and my advice is to buy both and watch them on successive nights.",5,"A Different Vision, But Still A Great One",1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,1482,"['depiction', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'must', 'inevitably', 'be', 'compared', 'magnificent', '1968', 'production', 'starring', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'version', 'starring', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'significant', 'departures', '1969', 'gold', 'standard', 'nevertheless', 'manages', 'be', 'superb', 'dramatization', 'own', 'right.Its', 'Christmas', '1183', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'England', 'called', 'family', 'together', 'happy', 'holiday', 'season', 'problem', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Aquitaine', 'prison', 'three', 'sons', 'Richard', 'Geoffrey', 'John', 'are', 'thirsting', 'power', 'King', 'growing', 'old', 'was', 'die', '1187', 'youngest', 'son', 'John', 'succeed', 'Eleanor', 'favorite', 'oldest', 'son', 'Richard', 'middle', 'boy', 'Geoffrey', 'biding', 'time', 'waiting', 'chance', 'Adding', 'complications', 'presence', 'Princess', 'Alais', 'France', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'marry', 'Richard', 'who', 'become', 'King', 'Henry', 'mistress', 'brother', 'King', 'Philip', 'France', '18', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'master', 'intrigue', 'deceit.While', 'version', 'fabulous', 'chemistry', 'sparkle', 'provided', ""O'Toole"", 'Hepburn', 'up', 'deeper', 'more', 'somber', 'interaction', 'Stewart', 'Close', 'version', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', '1968', 'version', 'definitely', 'even', 'deeper', 'sense', 'gravitas', 'irony', 'dramatizations', 'are', 'superb', 'advice', 'buy', 'watch', 'successive', 'nights']",The Lion in Winter
824922,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000255LIY,Joseph Haschka,"[124, 135]","The 1968 screen version of THE LION IN WINTER (Lion1) is the most excellent film I've ever seen, or likely will see in my lifetime. But, I've a lot to say about various aspects of this new version (Lion2), so I'd better get on with it. I'll make an effort to be evenhanded.First, a concise history lesson in the context of the film.King Henry II of England is also overlord of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and half of France. Henry keeps his wife Eleanor, the Duchess of Aquitaine and the former first wife of King Louis VII of France, under house arrest in Salisbury Castle for revolting against him. In better times, Henry and Eleanor had, in addition to three daughters, five sons: (in order of birth) William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and John. William died at age three. Henry, the anointed heir, died aged 28 in the summer of 1183. It's now the Yuletide season of that year, and Henry II is holding Christmas court at his French stronghold, Castle Chinon. (To be accurate, there's no record of a Christmas court at Chinon in 1183, but that's irrelevant to the essential theme and tone of the story.) Joining him are his surviving sons and, released from confinement for the festive occasion, Queen Eleanor. An aging Henry wishes to cement his succession. His favorite is John. Eleanor's is Richard. Geoffrey, nobody's favorite, maneuvers to get what he can. Complicating the gathering is the presence of Princess Alais and King Phillip II of France. Alais, Louis VII's daughter by his second wife, was betrothed to Richard by treaty between Henry and Louis when she was but a child. Alais has been living at the English court for years, and is Henry's mistress. (Author Sharon Kay Penman in her bookDevil's Broodeffectively argues against Alais having been Henry's mistress. But, no matter; it adds to the film's plot.) Phillip, aged 18 and King since 1180, is Louis VII's son by a third wife. Phillip either wants the marriage of Alais and Richard to take place, or Alais's dowry, the French province of the Vexin, back. Phillip hates the English monarch, and will use Henry's sons against him any way he can. The holiday skullduggery is so thick as can be pierced with a backstabbing dirk.The music score is positively anemic compared to John Barry's original. Of particular note in Lion1 are the vaguely menacing ""Main Title"" that serves as introduction to the destructive passions in the plot, the elegant ""Eleanor's Arrival"", which accompanies her regal progress up river by open boat to Chinon, and the finale - ""We're Jungle Creatures"" - that underscores the approaching end to Henry's reign, but the beginning of the great Plantagenet dynasty.Costuming and sets are too pretty and finished. In Lion1, the interior of Chinon is gloomy, cold, rough-hewn, and smoky (from the torches) - perhaps to be expected in a 12th century pile. And the clothing, even for the royals, wasn't elegant by any stretch. (My favorite scene in the original has Henry casually throwing on a crown and royal cloak over otherwise plain garb before striding through the mud, dogs, chickens and peasants in the castle courtyard to greet the arriving Phillip.) In Lion2, the costumes are too fine and the castle interior, especially the main circular staircase, is too obviously a film set.The dialogue, perhaps the best ever heard on the Big Screen, is virtually the same in the two productions. However, the nuances from facial expressions, body language, and timing raise Lion1 to the realm of the sublime.The scripted action is also pretty much identical in both, except for three unnecessary sequences: an opening scene of Eleanor's failed rebellion in 1174, a silly shot of Richard riding his horse up Chinon's circular stairs, and another of Richard attempting to escape house arrest by rappelling down Chinon's walls.And how about the acting?In Lion2, Yuliya Vysotskaya as Alais is at least the equal of Jane Merrow's original. Indeed, Yuliya presents as a slightly stronger personality, and it doesn't hurt that she resembles a blonde Audrey Hepburn. And the new Phillip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) does a different and perhaps improved take on a relative youth striving to be a King in the face of the formidable and street-wise Henry, whereas Timothy Dalton in the role came across as a bit sinister and with the unscrupulous venom of a misplaced older man.Rafe Spall as the latter-day John occasionally overacts, in my opinion, almost to the point of parody, unlike Nigel Terry's right-on portrayal of the sullen youngest Prince. John Light is relatively light-weight as the contemporary Geoffrey compared to the sardonic and clever schemer revealed by John Castle. Andrew Howard as the new Richard, whatever the real-life man may have been like, didn't strike me as Lionheart material. The superficial trouble was the actor's unimposing voice. Anthony Hopkin's Richard, I think, would've wiped up the floor with the new guy.Lion1 starred Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn as Henry and Eleanor. Both received Oscar nominations, and the latter won her category. Only in the last third of Lion2, with Patrick Stewart as Henry and Glenn Close as Eleanor, does the power of their paired performance achieve that of Peter's and Kate's tour de force. Stewart and Close seem too amused with the familial dysfunction of their characters, almost playing them for laughs, especially in the early going. Whatever humor the audience perceives in the dialogue - and there's much, the real Henry and Eleanor, and O'Toole and Hepburn, squabbled over the succession with deadly seriousness. Also, Lion2 portrays both as white-haired ancients. In fact, Henry was only 51 at the time, though Eleanor was 11 years older.Had I not seen Lion1, I would've given Lion2 five stars. But the former is so superlative in all respects that I cannot.Finally, let's return to the historical record. An aged and weary Henry, perhaps the most energetic of England's monarchs, died of illness in July 1189, two days after being forced by the allied Richard and Phillip to accept humiliating terms ending a war. Richard succeeded to the throne, married Berengaria of Navarre, and was followed by John in 1199. (Geoffrey had died in 1186 in a tournament accident). Eleanor survived until 1204. John lost virtually all of his father's vast French holdings to Phillip. Alais returned to France to wed another.",4,A near miss,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,6366,"['1968', 'screen', 'version', 'THE', 'LION', 'IN', 'WINTER', 'Lion1', 'most', 'excellent', 'film', ""'ve"",

Tevington,"[1, 1]","As per Wikepedia, ""Henry II (5 March 1133 - 6 July 1189) ruled as King of England (1154-1189), Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, Count of Nantes, Lord of Ireland and, at various times, controlled parts of Wales, Scotland and western France. Henry, the great-grandson of William the Conqueror, was the first of the House of Plantagenet to rule England....On 18 May 1152, at Poitiers, at the age of 19, Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine....Eleanor's prior marriage to Louis VII of France had been annulled only two months previously. Their relationship, always stormy, eventually disintegrated: after Eleanor encouraged her children to rebel against their father in 1173, Henry had her placed under house arrest, where she remained for fifteen years....Henry is a central character in the plays Becket by Jean Anouilh and The Lion in Winter by James Goldman. Peter O'Toole portrayed him in the film adaptations of both of these plays -Becketand The Lion in Winter (1968)....Patrick Stewart portrayed Henry in the 2003 television film adaptation ofThe Lion in Winter.""As per the film review from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB),Becketis ""The 12th-century saga...of the deep friendship and later conflict between England's King Henry II...and his friend, Sir Thomas a Becket..., and how their days of drinking and womanizing came to an end when the monarch decided to appoint Becket archbishop of Canterbury. Much to Henry's surprise, Becket was transformed into a deeply spiritual man of God, who took his new responsibilities very seriously....The film charts how Becket went head-to-head with the king over the vigilante murder of an erring priest by one of Henry's knights. Henry's famous despairing cry, `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?' -- leads to Becket's martyrdom in his cathedral."" Interestingly, the Catholic Encyclopedia suggests that Thomas' conversion was less dramatic, mentions nothing about Henry's famous line & indicates that his culpability for Thomas' murder is unclear. However, it indicates that Thomas strongly opposed Henry's effort ""to bring clerics guilty of crimes under the jurisdiction of the secular courts.""The Lion in Winterdeals with an older Henry and the infighting among his sons, his estranged wife, and himself over whom is to succeed Henry (NOTE: After a brief appearance as an early 20th century assassin inMichael Collins, Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays a 12th century French king inThe Lion in Winter, before becoming the 16 centuryHenry VIII!).",3,"The Further ""Adventures"" of Henry II",1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,2573,"['Wikepedia', 'Henry', 'II', '5', 'March', '1133', '6', 'July', '1189', 'ruled', 'King', 'England', '1154-1189', 'Count', 'Anjou', 'Count', 'Maine', 'Duke', 'Normandy', 'Duke', 'Aquitaine', 'Duke', 'Gascony', 'Count', 'Nantes', 'Lord', 'Ireland', 'various', 'times', 'controlled', 'parts', 'Wales', 'Scotland', 'western', 'France', 'Henry', 'great-grandson', 'William', 'Conqueror', 'was', 'first', 'House', 'Plantagenet', 'rule', 'England', '.On', '18', 'May', '1152', 'Poitiers', 'age', '19', 'Henry', 'married', 'Eleanor', 'Aquitaine', '.Eleanor', 'prior', 'marriage', 'Louis', 'VII', 'France', 'had', 'been', 'annulled', 'only', 'two', 'months', 'previously', 'relationship', 'always', 'stormy', 'eventually', 'disintegrated', 'Eleanor', 'encouraged', 'children', 'rebel', 'father', '1173', 'Henry', 'had', 'placed', 'house', 'arrest', 'where', 'remained', 'fifteen', 'years', '.Henry', 'central', 'character', 'plays', 'Becket', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'James', 'Goldman', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'portrayed', 'film', 'adaptations', 'plays', '-Becketand', 'Lion', 'Winter', '1968', '.Patrick', 'Stewart', 'portrayed', 'Henry', '2003', 'television', 'film', 'adaptation', 'ofThe', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'film', 'review', 'United', 'States', 'Conference', 'Catholic', 'Bishops', 'USCCB', 'Becketis', '12th-century', 'saga', 'deep', 'friendship', 'later', 'conflict', 'England', 'King', 'Henry', 'II', 'friend', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Becket', 'how', 'days', 'drinking', 'womanizing', 'came', 'end', 'when', 'monarch', 'decided', 'appoint', 'Becket', 'archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Much', 'Henry', 'surprise', 'Becket', 'was', 'transformed', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'man', 'God', 'who', 'took', 'new', 'responsibilities', 'very', 'seriously', '.The', 'film', 'how', 'Becket', 'went', 'head-to-head', 'king', 'vigilante', 'murder', 'erring', 'priest', 'one', 'Henry', 'knights', 'Henry', 'famous', 'despairing', 'cry', 'Will', 'one', 'rid', 'meddlesome', 'priest', 'Becket', 'martyrdom', 'cathedral', 'Interestingly', 'Catholic', 'Encyclopedia', 'Thomas', 'conversion', 'was', 'less', 'dramatic', 'mentions', 'nothing', 'Henry', 'famous', 'line', 'culpability', 'Thomas', 'murder', 'unclear', 'However', 'Thomas', 'strongly', 'opposed', 'Henry', 'effort', 'bring', 'clerics', 'guilty', 'crimes', 'jurisdiction', 'secular', 'courts', 'Lion', 'Winterdeals', 'older', 'Henry', 'infighting', 'sons', 'estranged', 'wife', 'whom', 'succeed', 'Henry', 'NOTE', 'brief', 'appearance', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'assassin', 'inMichael', 'Collins', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', '12th', 'century', 'French', 'king', 'inThe', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'becoming', '16', 'centuryHenry', 'VIII']",The Lion in Winter

Heck, Patty Hewes from Damages would've made a fabulous Eleanore, too (although Patricia wouldn't exist for a few more years).  Patrick Stewart should've killed this; he's perfect for the role. But at least he attempted a different flavor of Henry. Instead of O'Toole's cantankerous bluster, Stewart's Henry was infinitely more weary. There didn't seem to be a shred of victory left in him. An interesting choice. His delivery of the Lear comparison and 'deciding which peasant gets a cow' forces us to change our view of the salty old king. Not as much fun to watch, but I suppose that was the point. Notable: Rafe Spall (son of wonderful character actor Timothy Spall) has his father's fearless approach to being revolting. His version of loathsome Prince John actually left Nigel Terry in the dust.  Spall single-highhandedly kept this from being a 1-star review.  Also, Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a delicious young Philip.  Nothing will compare to the original 1968 Lion.

I am a huge fan of Patrick Stewart, but had no idea this copy existed until I looked to replace my run-down vhs copy.  As much as I love Patrick Stewart's work, and have all the faith in the world in his ability to bring out the best and the worst of characters, this would be a test.  How could anyone (even Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close) compare with the phenomenal performances of Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn?  They couldn't, and they didn't.  What they did was to recreate the roles in a style entirely their own.  The script is essentially unchanged.  The sets are a bit more elaborate.  The performances are spectacular.  I think Patrick Stewart managed better to create his own Henry than Gleen Close did with Eleanor.  I should have liked to see Close really open up and not try so hard to meet the standard set by Hepburn.  The early going has a lighter approach the the original version.  I don't think that the chemistry of the first film could ever be matched.  In the end, however, the characters play well off of each other.  When Patrick Stewart unleashes the force of Henri's grief, the effect is absolutely wrenching.  For the cast, overall, I think the only role I repeatedly missed in this performance was Anthony Hopkins' version of Richard.In every way as dramatic, as painful, and as entertaining as the original, this ""new"" Lion in Winter is definitely a keeper!

824928,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000255LIY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 18]","It is impossible for me to watch this Showtime remake of ""The Lion in Winter"" starring Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart without constantly comparing it to the 1968 theatrical film with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole.  That was the first Hepburn film I ever saw and the way she delivers James Goldman's great lines (my favorite would be ""I could peel you like a pear and God himself would call it justice!"") is forever etched in my brain.However, I also think that it is clear that the specter of the original film hangs over the entire cast of this production.  By that I mean that it seems like every single memorable line from the play (and there are literally dozens) is delivered in a decidedly different way.  Specifically, Close plays Eleanor of Aquitaine as being much more emotional, which is rather ironic given that her ex-husband, the late King of France, is described as being a weeper.  This means that when Eleanor has what should be her final emotional collapse at the end of the film, it is really just another in what has been a series of emotional moments.  As for Stewart, his Henry II tends to underplay all of the key moments.  It certainly seems that every time O'Toole engages in bluster and bombast, Stewart goes quiet, bordering on a whisper.  Again, I can only conclude that these were conscious choices because they stand out so boldly against the original film version.This is not to say that I am against new productions of the play.  I would have loved to have seen Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris on Broadway or the Roundabout Theater production starring Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing.  But Stewart and Close make choices, obviously endorsed by director Andrei Konchalovsky, that remove much of the fire from Goldman's brilliant dialogue.  For those who have never seen a production of ""The Lion in Winter"" they may get a sense of the high quality of the drama, but I do not believe they get the complete picture.""The Lion in Winter"" takes place during Christmas 1183, when Henry II, King of England, summons family to his castle in Chinon, France.  At issue is the question of who will be Henry's successor to the English throne.  Henry wants his youngest son, John (Rafe Spall), while Eleanor supports their eldest surviving son, Richard the Lionheart (Andrew Howard), which leaves middle son Geoffrey (John Light, in what I think is the best performance because I like his spin on the character).  Also along for the ride are Henry's mistress, Alais Capet (Yuliya Vysotskaya), who is supposed to marry the heir, and her brother, Philip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the young King of France.The chief attraction here is that while Henry and the rest play out their power games through a series of confrontations, feints, compromises, and sudden reversals they are delivering their lines with an extraordinary level of insight, wit, and irony.  That is, of course, provided they are delivered so as not to undercut the power of the lines.  The confrontations between Henry and Eleanor are supposed to be a clash of heavyweights and the cast here is dropping down in weight class.",4,A relatively light weight production of Goldman's drama,1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,3124,"['impossible', 'watch', 'Showtime', 'remake', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'starring', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'constantly', 'comparing', '1968', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'first', 'Hepburn', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'way', 'James', 'Goldman', 'great', 'lines', 'favorite', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'peel', 'pear', 'God', 'would', 'call', 'justice', 'forever', 'etched', 'brain.However', 'also', 'think', 'clear', 'specter', 'original', 'film', 'hangs', 'entire', 'cast', 'production', 'mean', 'single', 'memorable', 'line', 'play', 'are', 'literally', 'dozens', 'delivered', 'decidedly', 'different', 'way', 'Specifically', 'Close', 'Eleanor', 'Aquitaine', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'rather', 'ironic', 'given', 'ex-husband', 'late', 'King', 'France', 'described', 'being', 'weeper', 'when', 'Eleanor', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'final', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'been', 'series', 'emotional', 'moments', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'II', 'underplay', 'key', 'moments', 'certainly', 'time', ""O'Toole"", 'bluster', 'bombast', 'Stewart', 'quiet', 'bordering', 'whisper', 'Again', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'were', 'conscious', 'choices', 'stand', 'out', 'so', 'boldly', 'original', 'film', 'version.This', 'not', 'say', 'am', 'new', 'productions', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Broadway', 'Roundabout', 'Theater', 'production', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Stewart', 'Close', 'make', 'choices', 'obviously', 'endorsed', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Konchalovsky', 'remove', 'much', 'fire', 'Goldman', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'production', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'may', 'get', 'sense', 'high', 'quality', 'drama', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'get', 'complete', 'picture', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'place', 'Christmas', '1183', 'when', 'Henry', 'II', 'King', 'England', 'summons', 'family', 'castle', 'Chinon', 'France', 'issue', 'question', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'Henry', 'successor', 'English', 'throne', 'Henry', 'youngest', 'son', 'John', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'Eleanor', 'eldest', 'surviving', 'son', 'Richard', 'Lionheart', 'Andrew', 'Howard', 'middle', 'son', 'Geoffrey', 'John', 'Light', 'what', 'think', 'best', 'performance', 'like', 'spin', 'character', 'Also', 'along', 'ride', 'are', 'Henry', 'mistress', 'Alais', 'Capet', 'Yuliya', 'Vysotskaya', 'who', 'supposed', 'marry', 'heir', 'brother', 'Philip', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'young', 'King', 'France.The', 'chief', 'attraction', 'here', 'Henry', 'rest', 'play', 'out', 'power', 'games', 'series', 'confrontations', 'feints', 'compromises', 'sudden', 'reversals', 'are', 'delivering', 'lines', 'extraordinary', 'level', 'insight', 'wit', 'irony', 'course', 'provided', 'are', 'delivered', 'so', 'not', 'undercut', 'power', 'lines', 'confrontations', 'Henry', 'Eleanor', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'clash', 'heavyweights', 'cast', 'here', 'dropping', 'down', 'weight', 'class']",The Lion in Winter

Patrick is a dynamic performer and Glenn was certainly up to the challange.  This performance is also complete.  The 1968 version is a scaled down version of the play. Both characters were much more in line with history.  My wife, a historian, is a direct descendant of Eleanor and Henry and this performance was indeed scrutinized.  If you want a classic, get the 1968 version.  If you want the real thing, get this one.  You won't be disappointed in the powerful performances of ALL of the actors.

See my review of the original, which of course I rated 5 stars as well, for my thoughts on that. IMO,the new production is different. Not better, not worse, just different.Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart are both fine actors who are well suited to playing their roles as royalty. Both turned in subtle, restrained performances that do credit to both themselves and the play, never allowing overbearing grandness and arrogance to obscure the humanity of their characters. Having read widely on the subject of their lives, I believe that both Eleanor and Henry were consummate power players, capable of using either bullying or beguilement as the situation required. Close and Stewart display emotion from one end of that range to the other. It's often said that love and hatred are opposite sides of the same coin, and that is certainly apparent here, between husband and wife as well as parents and children.The supporting cast in the new Lion is also strong, though you have to wonder if the original John was really as worthless and repulsive a toady as he appears on screen.(Eleanor was certainly correct in her assessment of his kingly potential!)

Granted, that version is marvelous.I have bought both versions and love them both. OK, it is difficult not to compare when watching.BUT I can't help wondering: if this version would have been the first I or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version, if people would have been complaining about that version?I can have different versions of Vivaldi's four seasons can't I? Actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all (and I do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other). We would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version, would we? I have gone to the opera numerous times and watched Don Giovanni three times. Every time with different performers. Remake? Absolutely not.I think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it, because is such a great play. So, logically this would not be a remake!Why can't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other (splendid 1968) version when doing so?That done, I must say I understand why Alais is in love with king Henry. Patrick Stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses  very well. He is a  very good match to Close's queen. I did not care for Richard, I thought he was not commanding enough, bit whiny. I think John is a difficult part to play to say the least and I didn't care for him either, too much the idiot. Geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good. King Philippe: too much a boy, although he has moments when the interaction with king Henry makes him interesting. Alais:good enough.Which of the versions do I prefer? that is difficult. I have highly enjoyed both. I think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of Hepburn and I prefer her to Close. This version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic (Alais and Henry) approach.I definitely prefer Stewart to O'Toole, who seemed too young for the role. I liked the way Stewart made us see Henry's  self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming (that is, until the end, when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart). O'Toole had a very serious approach all the time.On the other hand: Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton were both splendid. I think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast.Which of the versions I watch, depends on the mood I am in.

824935,A3IOBAANEH0WS4,B000255LIY,"Paul J. Smith ""archcorenth""","[15, 19]","The original Lion in Winter is one of my all time favorite films, which is odd because, except for rare occasions, I never much cared for either Katherine Hepburn or Peter O'Toole.  So, when I saw this new version of the movie on the movie rental shelves, I was rather excited as I like both Patrick Stewart and Glen Close a lot.The film was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  Close and Stewart both do well, their timing isn't as impeccable as O'Toole's and Hepburn's, so the film loses some of it's humor, but they do manage to make the parts their own.  Jonathon Rhys-Meyers is VERY good as King Phillip and better, in fact, than the original. Also better than her original incarnation is the actress who plays Alice (I'm not sure if that's the correct spelling of her name), she's much stronger than the original girl and makes her role more important.Where the film really fails is in the boys.  First of all none of them seem to have any relationship with their parents.  The first film had the feeling of a family squabble over the holidays.  This one is more of a love story between Close and Stewart with Alice in the middle.  The boys and Phillip seem incidental and though that is the point of Phillip's character it should not be so of the brothers.  Also, how the boys are played is a problem.  Richard is not likeable and though it's mentioned that he writes poems and that is played up in his character is the war side.  When Henry claims Richard was the best I'm a bit dubious as in this version Geoff seems to be, which also shows a failure in how the film makers percieved Geoffrey's character.  I think perhaps they felt sympathetic towards him because no one loved him, but I feel no one loved him for a reason, which never comes across in this version.  As for John his main problem is just that the actors to old to be believable in the role.The other main problem with this version is that it's soooo slow.  It takes ages for it to get its audience interested and even then it just sort of meanders towards its conclusion.  I don't know if this is the fault of editing or what.  I know at the beginning it's the fault of too many scene changes, a problem with which most play-to-movie adaptions are fraught.I'd also like to say that the computer matt-paintings for the outdoor shots and exterior shots of the castle are just awful as is the case in everything Hallmarks has made since and including Gulliver's Travels.  This is a problem that's easy to overlook, however.Ultimately, the movie is interesting despite being slow and it's fun to watch Close and Stewart especially towards the end.  The best scene is credited to Close in which she's trying on her jewels after her first defeat and she joined one by one by her children.  She really made you feel for her.I've given the movie three stars, which, to me, means it's definately worth watching once, but not buying.",3,A good effort.,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,2897,"['original', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'odd', 'rare', 'occasions', 'never', 'much', 'cared', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'new', 'version', 'movie', 'movie', 'rental', 'shelves', 'was', 'rather', 'excited', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Glen', 'Close', 'lot.The', 'film', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'disappointment', 'Close', 'Stewart', 'do', 'well', 'timing', ""n't"", 'as', 'impeccable', ""O'Toole"", 'Hepburn', 'film', 'humor', 'do', 'manage', 'make', 'parts', 'own', 'Jonathon', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'VERY', 'good', 'King', 'Phillip', 'better', 'fact', 'original', 'Also', 'better', 'original', 'incarnation', 'actress', 'who', 'Alice', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'correct', 'spelling', 'name', 'much', 'stronger', 'original', 'girl', 'role', 'more', 'important.Where', 'film', 'really', 'boys', 'First', 'none', 'seem', 'have', 'relationship', 'parents', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'feeling', 'family', 'squabble', 'holidays', 'one', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'Close', 'Stewart', 'Alice', 'middle', 'boys', 'Phillip', 'seem', 'incidental', 'point', 'Phillip', 'character', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'brothers', 'Also', 'how', 'boys', 'are', 'played', 'problem', 'Richard', 'not', 'likeable', 'mentioned', 'poems', 'played', 'up', 'character', 'war', 'side', 'When', 'Henry', 'Richard', 'was', 'best', ""'m"", 'bit', 'dubious', 'version', 'Geoff', 'be', 'also', 'failure', 'how', 'film', 'makers', 'percieved', 'Geoffrey', 'character', 'think', 'perhaps', 'felt', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'one', 'loved', 'feel', 'one', 'loved', 'reason', 'never', 'version', 'John', 'main', 'problem', 'just', 'actors', 'old', 'be', 'believable', 'role.The', 'other', 'main', 'problem', 'version', 'soooo', 'slow', 'ages', 'get', 'audience', 'interested', 'even', 'then', 'just', 'sort', 'meanders', 'towards', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fault', 'editing', 'what', 'know', 'beginning', 'fault', 'too', 'many', 'scene', 'changes', 'problem', 'most', 'play-to-movie', 'adaptions', 'are', 'fraught.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'say', 'computer', 'matt-paintings', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'exterior', 'shots', 'castle', 'are', 'just', 'awful', 'case', 'everything', 'Hallmarks', 'made', 'including', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'problem', 'easy', 'overlook', 'however.Ultimately', 'movie', 'interesting', 'being', 'slow', 'fun', 'watch', 'Close', 'Stewart', 'especially', 'end', 'best', 'scene', 'credited', 'Close', 'trying', 'jewels', 'first', 'defeat', 'joined', 'one', 'one', 'children', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'her.I', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'definately', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'not', 'buying']",The Lion in Winter

I never went to another school play after making the discovery.I have had a similar difficulty with Glen Close after watching this movie.  The O'Toole and Hepburn version is on my very short list of very fine movies, so it didn't take me long to discover that Close was just marking Katharine Hepburn's performance from beginning to end.  She did absolutely nothing original with the role.  I'm so disappointed in her!On the other hand, I must congratulate Patrick Stewart for creating a version of Henry II that is subtly but profoundly separate from Peter O'Toole's.  He's quite a different man actually: his words have different emphasis, his actions different motivations.  It must be very hard work to stay out of the shadow of such an excellent predecessor, as Close's failure demonstrates; but then again Stewart has had plenty of experience at this in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  I've never seen him in one of those roles, but will definitely try: I was that impressed with his work in The Lion In Winter.In the end I simply can't recommend this movie to others unless they have first seen the 1968 version so they will know what to be impressed with.  Also Stewart's and O'Toole's interpretations of Henry inform each other when experienced side by side, and together help round out a very complex fictional character.Oh, also this version is quite a lot better LOOKING than the 1968 one.

In fact I didn't even finish watching it.  Close and Stewart played Henry and Eleanor as truly estranged enemies who were sincerely plotting each other's destruction.

The play rests entirely on the repartee between Eleanor and Henry and the rapier wit of the two but alas this was missing in this version.

Why remake it at all?  There was only one way such a project could compare to the original: badly.  The brilliant flamoyance and radiant light that burst from O'Toole and Hepburn are missing here.Instead we have a Patrick Stewart who fails as Henry II for the very reasons he succeeded as Aelius Sejanus in 1977's 'I, Claudius' and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on the Star Trek: Next Generation.  He simply is not the right man for part of this type.  Especially after the genius of O'Toole's 1968 performance.This remake is a perfect illustration of what separates the good (even the very good) from the great.  The icy precision that made Glenn Close such a delicious Marquise de Mertuil in Steven Frear's 1987 'Dangerous Liasions.""  But Eleanor of Acquitance was no cold, scheming machine.  She was a woman of strong passion and appetite, every inch the equal of Henry and the superior of all other men around her.  In the chaotic mess of the 12th century she shines out as a shining beacon that West was reawakening.Close's emotional scenes seem more histrionic than accomplished.  The dignity and gravitas that made you ready ""suspend disblief"" for the original, simply isn't here in this version.  I'm not saying Close is hamming it or overacting.  She's trying to imitate things Hepburn had and she doesnt.  It doesn't work. Katherine Hepburn, as Close did with the Marquise, has forever cemented that role as hers.  No other actress could or has done it justice.  Even more so Eleanor of Acquitaine.  It's not a fault, it's a question of charisma.  Close is now, arguably, our greatest living actress.  But this part is not hers.Further she and Stewart lack the chemistry that O'Toole and Hepburn created so magnetically.  In the original, it seems like a window in time; suspension of disbelief was easy with Hervey's gritty, low budget direction then.The real failure is the supporting cast.  They get an F.  Minus.  No, I won't be that harsh, but they are simply less than B actors.  Even the 'Bend like Bechkam"" star who plays French King Phillip Augustus comes off as doing a bad Joaquin Phoenix impersonation a la 'Gladiator.'  They simply aren't up to snuff.  Julia Vsotsky (Alais) seems to struggle with Goldman's still noble lines.  She lacks the heart-rending beauty of the original Alais and the acting skills.  The rest seem to struggle with delivering lines period.In all, as it had to be, a disappointment.  Calling it ""solid"" is generous in the extreme.  The movies rises close to the origianl only in a few scenes in the second half; I leave to judge which ones.  Only in these does the suspension of disbelief take hold; only these few scenes do we forget we're seeing acting and become immersed in the story.As I said, this movie illustrates the good from the great.  Patrick Stewart is a good actor.  He's competent and thorough; can anyone else imagine another as Capt. Picard?  But he doesn't have the charisma or elan of O'Toole.Close, a truly great actress, is simply miscast.  Some challenges shouldn't be met.  The performance is a misfire and, in this film at least, she captures none of the scene-stealing glory of 'Dangerou Liasions"" or the unforgettable collapse at the end of that same movie.  Here, her skills simply don't work.Stick with the original.  It's still one of the greatest films of all time.  This remake, however, is not.  And, it simply wasn't necessary.  The first was a complete vision, nothing was missing, no improvement could be made.  And, it it isn't.I also note that this was Executive Produced by Stewart and his estragned or divorced wife, Wendy Neuss (a STNG producer).

824941,A1TWBU1CK70ZZJ,B000255LIY,Springtownspears,"[3, 10]","This dark historical drama set in 1183 is a far cry from most of the 2003 Oscar Nominees and Winners, except perhaps for Master and Commander and Girl With A Pearl Earring,two historical dramas. It concerns King Henry II of England who meets with his jailed wife, three ambitious sons, and the new King Philip of France at Chinon in France over Christmas to decide the accession to the throne and the dividing up of Henry's considerable lands among his heirs. There is considerable conniving among the lead characters, since the stakes are so high, and neither the mother nor her three sons are very loyal to their father. Eleanor of Aquitaine was particularly noteworthy for siding with her sons in their claims against their father. Various plots and alliances are hatched while the unfaithful Henry continues his affair with young Alys, sister of the French King, whom he offers as a pawn in his game of divide and conquer.I found this to be a stimulating remake of the Katherine Hepburn film,which I haven't seen.Both Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart seem highly involved in their roles throughout. Eleanor in the course of the dialogue reviews the course of her marriage with Henry II from her teenage years when she was married to the King of France and possibly slept with Henry's father. Their rocky relationship has its ups and downs in the course of the film, ending on a positive tone. But there are scenes with Eleanor insulting her husband's masculinity as he contemplates taking a new wife to produce an heir, for example, claiming he has no sons, and she also threatens him with the distinct possibility that at one time she slept with his father. At times Henry seems to favor his youngest son John, and Eleanor favors Richard, but these alliances do not last and eventually all three sons end up in the dungeon. If you have tried to enjoy Shakespearean drama but have found it somewhat inaccessible, I think you will enjoy this film which is quite accessible to the general public.

The costumes and the set of the castle of Chinon are wonderful.  I thought Glenn Close was every bit as good as Katherine Hepburn - they are different actresses of course, but I admired Glenn Close's performance just as much.  I really liked Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as King Philip -- his performance is excellent.  And I appreciated the way all the characters delivered their lines in this teleplay - for the most part, their delivery was natural, and the words flowed like actual conversation; less like a ""play"", with more reality.BUT. I had a problem with Patrick Stewart's performance.  It's good enough, as far as performances go. I kept trying not to compare it with Peter O'Toole's, but I missed that triumphant bellowing, that presence, the ""oomph"".  I thought Patrick Stewart was a little too down-key - perhaps too reserved.  He has such a marvelous voice, I would have liked him to use it to its best effect. In the quiet scenes, he's OK, but he really needed to turn on the juice for the anger, the hurt at John's betrayal, etc.Unfortunately, I didn't care for the actors who played Richard, Geoffrey and John.  None of these performances stood out, except perhaps the Geoffrey character was successful in showing the hurt he suffered from his parents' ignoring him all his life.  He was twisted (as he's referred to in the teleplay) by this neglect, and at least a viewer has a sense of that from this performance.  But on a whole, the actors who played the sons in the 1968 film gave much better performances.All in all, I liked this teleplay, but I love the 1968 version.

The genius of James Goldman's perfect script for The Lion in Winter is the way it takes great historical figures and not only makes them all-too-recognisably human but also makes their faults serve as the world in microcosm. And it does it with wit, drama and genuine emotion as its two titans battle each other with a great hatred born of a once great love while their unlovely brood jockey for position and the crown of England in an ever escalating web of one-upmanship and betrayal. As such, it's foolproof and virtually idiot proof, the kind of thing that not even a talented director could ruin. Unfortunately one of the reasons the play has been so rarely revived is because it also managed to spawn a film version so close to perfection for all its budgetary limitations and technical faults that it must seem pointless to anyone to attempt to match it. So it's no great surprise that Andrei Konchalovsky's 2003 TV version leaves you feeling a bit like you've brought a ticket to the hottest show on Broadway only to find that the entire cast has gone down with food poisoning and the rep company from Des Moines will be taking their roles for tonight's performance.The biggest problem is that all these people have all too obviously seen the 1968 movie and fail to make the parts their own. Patrick Stewart fares best, but he lacks Peter O'Toole's delivery or comic timing although, to his credit, he doesn't try an impersonation. Unwisely, Glenn Close DOES slip into the odd spot of mimicry of Hepburn inbetween the odd half-hearted bout of Norma Desmond, but she makes surprisingly little impact until the second half of the game. Jonathan Rhys Myers' King Philip is especially weak, alternating between appearing stoned out of his skull (anytime he is required to stand or cross the room) or an unpopular school prefect in a school play. Indeed, there's too much of the Sixth Form Drama Society in Henry and Eleanor's loathsome litter. John Light takes what honors are available in that field as the unloved and unloving Geoffrey, but his competition is beyond merely light: Andrew Howard growls with more gravel than gravitas as Richard while a painfully incompetent Rafe Spall manages the impossible to turn in an even worse performance as an infantile John than Nigel Terry. Yuliya Vysotskaya's Alais is a somewhat better actress than Jane Merrow but far too East European to convince as a French girl and far too limited to make the part more than a cipher (but then, as Mrs Konchalovsky, her casting would appear to have been a deal breaker here).It's not bad - the superb writing carries it through even when the performances falter - but despite the bigger budget you get that distinct Saturday Matinee Dinner Theater feeling.",3,The play's the thing,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2848,"['course', 'knife', 'always', 'knife', 'have', 'knives', '1183', ""'re"", 'barbarians', 'genius', 'James', 'Goldman', 'perfect', 'script', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'way', 'great', 'historical', 'figures', 'not', 'only', 'all-too-recognisably', 'human', 'also', 'faults', 'serve', 'world', 'microcosm', 'wit', 'drama', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'two', 'titans', 'battle', 'other', 'great', 'hatred', 'born', 'once', 'great', 'love', 'unlovely', 'brood', 'jockey', 'position', 'crown', 'England', 'ever', 'escalating', 'web', 'one-upmanship', 'betrayal', 'such', 'foolproof', 'virtually', 'idiot', 'proof', 'kind', 'thing', 'not', 'even', 'talented', 'director', 'could', 'ruin', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'reasons', 'play', 'been', 'so', 'rarely', 'revived', 'also', 'managed', 'spawn', 'film', 'version', 'so', 'close', 'perfection', 'budgetary', 'limitations', 'technical', 'faults', 'must', 'seem', 'pointless', 'anyone', 'attempt', 'match', 'great', 'surprise', 'Andrei', 'Konchalovsky', '2003', 'TV', 'version', 'feeling', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'ticket', 'hottest', 'show', 'Broadway', 'only', 'find', 'entire', 'cast', 'gone', 'down', 'food', 'poisoning', 'rep', 'company', 'Des', 'Moines', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'roles', 'tonight', 'performance.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'people', 'have', 'too', 'obviously', 'seen', '1968', 'movie', 'fail', 'make', 'parts', 'own', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'best', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'delivery', 'comic', 'timing', 'credit', ""n't"", 'try', 'impersonation', 'Unwisely', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'DOES', 'slip', 'odd', 'spot', 'mimicry', 'Hepburn', 'inbetween', 'odd', 'half-hearted', 'bout', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'impact', 'second', 'half', 'game', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Myers', 'King', 'Philip', 'especially', 'weak', 'alternating', 'appearing', 'stoned', 'skull', 'required', 'stand', 'cross', 'room', 'unpopular', 'school', 'prefect', 'school', 'play', 'Indeed', 'too', 'much', 'Sixth', 'Form', 'Drama', 'Society', 'Henry', 'Eleanor', 'loathsome', 'litter', 'John', 'Light', 'what', 'honors', 'are', 'available', 'field', 'unloved', 'unloving', 'Geoffrey', 'competition', 'merely', 'light', 'Andrew', 'Howard', 'more', 'gravel', 'gravitas', 'Richard', 'painfully', 'incompetent', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'impossible', 'turn', 'even', 'worse', 'performance', 'infantile', 'John', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'Yuliya', 'Vysotskaya', 'Alais', 'somewhat', 'better', 'actress', 'Jane', 'Merrow', 'far', 'too', 'East', 'European', 'convince', 'French', 'girl', 'far', 'too', 'limited', 'make', 'part', 'more', 'cipher', 'then', 'Mrs', 'Konchalovsky', 'casting', 'would', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'deal', 'breaker', 'here', '.It', 'not', 'bad', 'superb', 'writing', 'even', 'when', 'performances', 'falter', 'bigger', 'budget', 'get', 'distinct', 'Saturday', 'Matinee', 'Dinner', 'Theater', 'feeling']",The Lion in Winter
