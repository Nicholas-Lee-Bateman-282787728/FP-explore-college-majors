837112,A3X3V1QTS464Y,B0002J58J2,Collector 4 Life,"[11, 11]","Phantom 2040 is a very good update to the character and was one of my favorites when it originally came out on VHS years ago. So when I discovered it was now available on DVD,I jumped on it. I was accustomed to animated features being remastered and looking good on my 42"" HDTV. Unfortunately this one appears to be a straight transfer from VHS. No remastered treatment appears to be present. The picture is very grainy and not at all what I expected. If your playing this one  on a traditional size TV, this may be fine. But on the latest flat screens, this product was not properly mastered. Too bad. I hope that changes in the future. I'll repurchase it if they do.",3,"Great story, but not a great picture on big screens",1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,668,"['Phantom', '2040', 'very', 'good', 'update', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'discovered', 'was', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'jumped', 'was', 'accustomed', 'animated', 'features', 'being', 'remastered', 'looking', 'good', '42', 'HDTV', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'be', 'straight', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'No', 'remastered', 'treatment', 'be', 'present', 'picture', 'very', 'grainy', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'playing', 'one', 'traditional', 'size', 'TV', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'latest', 'flat', 'screens', 'product', 'was', 'not', 'properly', 'mastered', 'Too', 'bad', 'hope', 'changes', 'future', ""'ll"", 'repurchase', 'do']",N/A
837113,A24X0P3SDUOVRN,B0002J58J2,"Gwadovski ""Kaigeus""","[2, 4]","This show is so awesome.  Peter Chung of Aeon Flux, Animatrix, and Reign the Conqueror fame designing a saturday morning cartoon.  Chung's work on Aeon Flux when it was an almost-silent liquid television short is one of the best cartoons ever, and the half-hour animated series was pretty awesome as well.  However, watching all these shows as a youngster, the one thing that detracted from the greatness of most of Chung's work is the bizarre sexual inuendo and frustratingly abrupt endings (Aeon Flux) and/or rampant homo-eroticism (Reign), or just cool animation with no solid story at all (Animatrix).  Here, we have Chung applying his unique talent to the medium of early 90's Saturday Morning Cartoons - so you can be sure it's action packed, fairly unobjectionable, well-paced, superbly drawn, and intriguing.  This show lasted for TWO seasons and even spawned its own comic series and video game, which is pretty impressive.  If a complete set of this show's two seasons were put out, I would certainly purchase it.",5,"More, please",1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,1023,"['show', 'so', 'awesome', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Animatrix', 'Reign', 'Conqueror', 'fame', 'designing', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'Chung', 'work', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'when', 'was', 'almost-silent', 'liquid', 'television', 'short', 'one', 'best', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'half-hour', 'animated', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'watching', 'shows', 'youngster', 'one', 'thing', 'detracted', 'greatness', 'most', 'Chung', 'work', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'inuendo', 'frustratingly', 'abrupt', 'endings', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'and/or', 'rampant', 'homo-eroticism', 'Reign', 'just', 'cool', 'animation', 'solid', 'story', 'Animatrix', 'Here', 'have', 'Chung', 'applying', 'unique', 'talent', 'medium', 'early', '90', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'Cartoons', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'action', 'packed', 'fairly', 'unobjectionable', 'well-paced', 'superbly', 'drawn', 'intriguing', 'show', 'lasted', 'TWO', 'seasons', 'even', 'spawned', 'own', 'comic', 'series', 'video', 'game', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'complete', 'set', 'show', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'would', 'certainly', 'purchase']",N/A

Pring,"[1, 2]","My memories of this show were more impressive than the show itself was frankly, however, you have to give the show credit for being on top of technology and animation for the time.  It's a fascinating to see what people thought the future might be like and to see the reinvention of the classic Phantom character brought up to date.As I said, not the best cartoon I've ever seen, in that same respect, not the worst.  If you were a fan of Saturday morning reruns of Space Ghost and Birdman as much as I was then this show as a welcome change that starting bringing new life into animation.  And really because of animations like this future shows kept getting better.Overall should this be bought...if your a fan of one of the very first superheroes (started appearing in 1936, look it up it's true) then I'd go for it.
