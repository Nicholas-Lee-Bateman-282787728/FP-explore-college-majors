Enriquez ""Counselor and lover of life""","[12, 12]","It is difficult to write an exciting review of this film without giving out the twists in the film, but I will say this is definitely a great film.  As you already know from the plot description the three characters are romantically entangled, but the way the actors portray their emotions are definitely complex and not what the audience would expect.  I disagree with an earlier reviewer about turning this into an American film.  An American version will likely have a happier outcome for all four characters and place a greater emphasis on the heterosexual romance.  Check out this film and take notice of who seems to be in love with who.  An incredibly well directed film with complex characters whose depth is portrayed in the acting more than the actual script!  Ahh, love can be so complicated...",5,Original,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,805,"['difficult', 'write', 'exciting', 'review', 'film', 'giving', 'out', 'twists', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'definitely', 'great', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'plot', 'description', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'romantically', 'entangled', 'way', 'actors', 'portray', 'emotions', 'are', 'definitely', 'complex', 'not', 'what', 'audience', 'would', 'expect', 'disagree', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'turning', 'American', 'film', 'American', 'version', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'happier', 'outcome', 'four', 'characters', 'place', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'heterosexual', 'romance', 'Check', 'out', 'film', 'take', 'notice', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'who', 'incredibly', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'complex', 'characters', 'depth', 'portrayed', 'acting', 'more', 'actual', 'script', 'Ahh', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'complicated']",The Trio

Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[6, 8]","I felt more sympathetic toward the hookers and sex workers in Km.0 and the porn folks in Fluffer than I did with these sad, scheming, nasty theives.They basically drive their uncapable third partner to suicide by being really hateful to him (even though the father ""loves"" him.)The only decent character is the young man they recruit to replace the ailing man, who, turns out, has a thing both for women and men.  In this case, father and daughter.  It could be interesting, but it's lost here among the artificial-feeling grittiness and endless series of theft attempts, which pass for story.Bascially, I didn't relate to or care much about the characters, who didn't have much redeeming value, and who didn't learn anything during the movie.

579686,A2X25C107CSLOR,B00005B1WK,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[17, 17]","This German film directed by Hermine Huntgeburth is like a comic spin on The Grifters but with an added sexual component. When one of the 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using the blind man ploy is injured in a chase, a replacement is chosen from someone who had tried to steal from them and had failed. His punishment was to be stripped by the two gay male members of the team, which prefigures the sexual triangle that eventuates when both the father and his daughter are attracted to the new member. We know that when we are told the group's rule is no exchange of body fluids that it is said to be broken. Huntgeburth gets comic mileage out of who is the the aggressor in each relationship and the stolen moments of intimacy they have in fear of being discovered by the third party. The most refreshing touch is how the father (Gotz George) is established as being mean to his gay partner, yet he becomes foolish when faced with the attentions of a younger man, as if he cannot believe it possible, and the Shakespearian appearance of George emphasises him as a classically defined pathetic figure. George actually resembles a brunette and heavy-set Ralph Fiennes. The daughter probably has the least interesting role, but Felix Eitner as the boy demonstrates the bisexual trend of modern sexuality, the free sexual preference of European men, and the question of sex as duplicitious behaviour. When Eitner's pet snake is disposed of cruelly, Huntgeburth sets up an expectation for his own fate, with the snake as metaphor. The accordian music of Niki Reiser sets the tone with it's melancholy and suggestion of exotic mischief, and thankfully Huntgeburth's treatment lacks the concluding cruelty of the Stephen Frears title.",4,3's a crowd,989539200,"05 11, 2001",2001,1733,"['German', 'film', 'directed', 'Hermine', 'Huntgeburth', 'comic', 'spin', 'Grifters', 'added', 'sexual', 'component', 'When', 'one', '3', 'petty', 'criminals', 'who', 'wallet', 'snatch', 'using', 'blind', 'man', 'ploy', 'injured', 'chase', 'replacement', 'chosen', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'tried', 'steal', 'had', 'failed', 'punishment', 'was', 'be', 'stripped', 'two', 'gay', 'male', 'members', 'team', 'sexual', 'triangle', 'when', 'father', 'daughter', 'are', 'attracted', 'new', 'member', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'told', 'group', 'rule', 'exchange', 'body', 'fluids', 'said', 'be', 'broken', 'Huntgeburth', 'comic', 'mileage', 'who', 'aggressor', 'relationship', 'stolen', 'moments', 'intimacy', 'have', 'fear', 'being', 'discovered', 'third', 'party', 'most', 'refreshing', 'touch', 'how', 'father', 'Gotz', 'George', 'established', 'being', 'mean', 'gay', 'partner', 'yet', 'foolish', 'when', 'faced', 'attentions', 'younger', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'possible', 'Shakespearian', 'appearance', 'George', 'classically', 'defined', 'pathetic', 'figure', 'George', 'actually', 'brunette', 'heavy-set', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'daughter', 'probably', 'least', 'interesting', 'role', 'Felix', 'Eitner', 'boy', 'bisexual', 'trend', 'modern', 'sexuality', 'free', 'sexual', 'preference', 'European', 'men', 'question', 'sex', 'duplicitious', 'behaviour', 'When', 'Eitner', 'pet', 'snake', 'disposed', 'cruelly', 'Huntgeburth', 'up', 'expectation', 'own', 'fate', 'snake', 'metaphor', 'accordian', 'music', 'Niki', 'Reiser', 'tone', 'melancholy', 'suggestion', 'exotic', 'mischief', 'thankfully', 'Huntgeburth', 'treatment', 'concluding', 'cruelty', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'title']",The Trio

This German film begins with the motley group of Zobel (played by handsome Gotz George, one of Germanys' most popular actors), his lover Karl (Christian Redi) and Zobel's daughter, Lizzie (Jeanette Hain) making their living by practicing petty crimes like picking pockets and con schemes. When Karl is hit by a car during an ill-fated scheme, Zobel and Lizzie search for a replacement. Rudolf, a cute 25-year-old gas station attendant fits the bill. But complications arise when both Lizzie and Zobel fall in love with Rudolf. Rudolf returns affections to both of his admirers, which of course soon results in numerous conflicts. This gritty comedy is infused with charm and pathos (both Zobel and Lizzie are lonely characters seeking a ray of happiness in their dreary lives). The film suffers from a weak ending that is not entirely satisfying but the film is one that is definitely recommended!",4,"A charming, unconventional comedy",1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,1021,"['probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'made', 'U.S.', 'father', 'daughter', 'are', 'vying', 'affections', 'same', 'man', 'German', 'film', 'motley', 'group', 'Zobel', 'played', 'handsome', 'Gotz', 'George', 'one', 'Germanys', 'most', 'popular', 'actors', 'lover', 'Karl', 'Christian', 'Redi', 'Zobel', 'daughter', 'Lizzie', 'Jeanette', 'Hain', 'making', 'living', 'practicing', 'petty', 'crimes', 'picking', 'pockets', 'con', 'schemes', 'When', 'Karl', 'hit', 'car', 'ill-fated', 'scheme', 'Zobel', 'Lizzie', 'search', 'replacement', 'Rudolf', 'cute', '25-year-old', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'bill', 'complications', 'arise', 'when', 'Lizzie', 'Zobel', 'fall', 'love', 'Rudolf', 'Rudolf', 'affections', 'admirers', 'course', 'soon', 'results', 'numerous', 'conflicts', 'gritty', 'comedy', 'infused', 'charm', 'pathos', 'Zobel', 'Lizzie', 'are', 'lonely', 'characters', 'seeking', 'ray', 'happiness', 'dreary', 'lives', 'film', 'suffers', 'weak', 'ending', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'film', 'one', 'definitely', 'recommended']",The Trio
