Keviny01 (below) gives a great summary of the movie. All three movies are charismatic but you would need to have an open mind watching it. To understand these movies, I think it'd be best to watch some other movies by Kieslowski (like The Double Life of Veronique or The Blind Chance, on which the movie The Sliding Doors was vaguely based), and know a little about the revival of Poland in the early post-Soviet years (for the movie White). On the other hand, the movies are so fantastic that they are a treat to anyone.

How does a woman, seemingly fulfilled by happiness, react when that happiness is yanked away in one telling moment, in a car accident in which both her husband and her daughter pass away? That is the central understudy - a strong woman's attempts at finding purpose in the seeming absence of meaning.* Mise-en-scene: I watched an interview with Juliette Binoche, where she mentions that Kieslowski refused to make the film unless it had her in it. It's easy to see why. I can't imagine Bleu without Juliette - its not just that she lends her personality to the film...Bleu IS Binoche.* I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character's relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film. There were perhaps references that I missed but the 'almost happy' ending left me feeling un-relinquished. Given that I had shared such an intense journey with Julie, it seemed almost improper to accept that she would settle in to a normal relationship again.* Cinematography: The 1st shot of the film - that of a car tire racing - shot from the bottom of the moving car establishes this as 'not your typical movie'. The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film.* Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who's craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning.* The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost  hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions.* The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie's mind and share in her agony.* Editing: deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative.* Sound: The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning and becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses.Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you'll feel that you've totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist's psychologically subjective journey) or you'll realize by the time you've reached the end that you'll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are two now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously...1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning  process.",5,A masterpiece  of an understudy into human grief!,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,3650,"['BLEU', 'TROIS', 'COLEURS', '/', 'France/Poland', '1993', '4', 'STARS', '23', 'January', '2004', 'thing', 'out', 'most', 'Blue', 'expression', 'lack', 'there', 'grief', 'How', 'woman', 'seemingly', 'fulfilled', 'happiness', 'react', 'when', 'happiness', 'yanked', 'away', 'one', 'telling', 'moment', 'car', 'accident', 'husband', 'daughter', 'pass', 'away', 'central', 'understudy', 'strong', 'woman', 'attempts', 'finding', 'purpose', 'seeming', 'absence', 'meaning', '*', 'Mise-en-scene', 'watched', 'interview', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'where', 'Kieslowski', 'refused', 'make', 'film', 'had', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Bleu', 'Juliette', 'not', 'just', 'personality', 'film', 'Bleu', 'IS', 'Binoche', '*', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'sub-plots', 'character', 'relationships', 'mother', 'striptease', 'dancer', 'was', 'seeming', 'resolution', 'end', 'film', 'were', 'perhaps', 'references', 'missed', ""'almost"", 'happy', 'ending', 'left', 'feeling', 'un-relinquished', 'Given', 'had', 'shared', 'intense', 'journey', 'Julie', 'seemed', 'almost', 'improper', 'accept', 'would', 'settle', 'normal', 'relationship', 'again', '*', 'Cinematography', '1st', 'shot', 'film', 'car', 'tire', 'racing', 'shot', 'bottom', 'moving', 'car', 'establishes', ""'not"", 'typical', 'movie', 'sequence-of-shots', 'follow', 'eerily', 'draw', 'one', 'compelling', 'story-telling', 'style', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'world', 'communicated', 'dialogue', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', '*', 'Blue', 'not', 'typical', 'art-house', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'cinematography', 'Slavomir', 'Idziak', 'who', 'craft', 'was', 'recognized', 'Hollywood', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'nothing', 'short', 'stunning', '*', 'lighting', 'low', 'key', 'soft', 'wraps', 'characters', 'create', 'mood', 'subtlety', 'distinguishing', 'feature', 'detail', 'shadows', 'None', 'close-ups', 'fully', 'illuminate', 'protagonist', 'almost', 'hinting', 'vulnerability', 'facing', 'light', 'delicate', 'use', 'eye-lights', 'well', 'bring', 'alive', 'emotions', '*', 'camera', 'intelligently', 'used', 'narrative', 'element', 'Julie', 'partakes', 'emotions', 'respecting', 'yet', 'accentuating', 'intensity', 'alien', 'world', 'deep', 'personal', 'purposelessness', 'tight', 'close-ups', 'penetrate', 'soul', 'force', 'delve', 'Julie', 'mind', 'share', 'agony', '*', 'Editing', 'deftly', 'match', 'action', 'create', 'irony', 'forwarding', 'narrative', '*', 'Sound', 'pace', 'hauntingly', 'slow', 'silence', 'been', 'used', 'compellingly', 'meaning', 'one', 'more', 'important', 'elements', 'narrative', 'progresses.Bleu', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'consume', 'move', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'totally', 'wasted', 'time', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'pivotal', 'occurrence', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'single', 'world', 'being', 'spoken', 'rest', 'film', 'essentially', 'protagonist', 'psychologically', 'subjective', 'journey', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'time', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'end', ""'ll"", 'revisit', 'film', 'various', 'points', 'time', 'explore', 'read', 'people', 'respect', 'try', 'get', 'closer', 'essence', 'Kieslowski', 'are', 'two', 'now', 'well-accepted', 'truths', 'folklore', 'surrounding', 'Kieslowski', 'reputation', 'mount', 'posthumously', '1.', 'Kieslowski', 'carefully', 'interwove', 'elements', 'were', 'rich', 'meaning', 'social', 'irony', '2.', 'figuring', 'elements', 'out', 'appreciating', 'implications', 'probably', 'lifelong', 'learning', 'process']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)

His relatively small body of work should not be held against him as everything he has done is absolutely brilliant.  Blue is a dark somewhat depressing tale that is a bit more cerebral than its companions in the trilogy.  Nevertheless it is a beautiful piece of work.  White is a touching story of how lives can change and how tradgedy can turn to comedy in an instant.  As much as I like White.  Red is the best for me.  With Red Kieslowski achieves a humanist tone I only see in Kurosawa's work.

732351,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000083C5F,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","One of my favorite filmmakers, Kieslowski left behind an impressive resume, one that peaked with his final contribution to cinema, this exceptional trilogy.  While the trilogy is not necessarily one of the narrative sense, it does carry interwoven themes and works rather splendidly as a complete work.In Kieslowski's first film in his `Trois Couleurs' trilogy, he explores liberty.  This is not in the political sense but in an emotional sense, and that truth rings loud and clear over the course of the film's running time.  `Bleu' follows Julie, a wife and mother who has her life turned upside down when her husband and son are killed in a car accident.  Having been in the car with her family, and being the sole survivor, Julie is racked with guilt atop her sorrow and she is pained with the very thought of living.  Over the course of the film, Julie regresses into isolation only to have her soul liberated from emotional desolation as she reconnects with her former life and uncovers truths she was unaware of.  Kieslowski does a remarkable job of shadowing Julie's inner conflictions with stunning use of visuals, but more so he allows the emotional core of the film to seep into every frame through music, using it as a symbol of Julie's inability for true isolation and eventual liberation.  Binoche's tremendous performance illuminates each scene as she digs deep into the turmoil Julie is experiencing.  What is so moving about `Bleu' is that it truly serves as a progressive film, maybe more so than either of the other films in the trilogy, because it fully fleshes out Julie's complete transformation as a person experiencing grief.  Kieslowski truly `liberates' her.In `Blanc', the second film in the trilogy, Kieslowski tackles equality.  Using a divorcing couple for this, Kieslowski mirrors the political state of France through this young couple's sexual and emotional turmoil.  Karol, a Polish immigrant, is being humiliated by his French wife for his inability to consummate their marriage.  Instead of simply walking away from the situation, Karol mourns the loss of his love and she continues to rub that loss in his face to the point where he seeks out an intricate and devilish revenge in order to attain his personal equality.  The use of white is brilliant here, for it underscores the more pure aspects of the story and helps connect us to Karol as a man.  As an `anti-comedy', `Blanc' offers a lighter look at Kieslowski's themes but never feels unimportant.  The depictions of Karol's eminent rise are deeply rooted in the strength of the trilogy and offer a true glimpse of the director's range.For me, Kieslowski's crowning achievement (at least in this trilogy) comes in the form of `Rouge', the final film.  Here he tackles the subject of fraternity and does so by introducing us to an `anti-romance' revolving around part-time model, Valentine, and a retired judge, Kern.  The two are brought together when Valentine accidentally runs over Kern's dog.  The two find themselves wrapped in a web of emotional connection as the two become privy to the lives of those around them.  Kern, a bitter recluse, spies on his neighbors to feed his cynical outlook.  Valentine stumbles onto this and finds herself intrigued despite her hesitation.  What makes `Rouge' so impactful is the way that Kieslowski perfectly balances out his themes through varied means.  He uses polar extremes to create a complete picture.  The age differences, the personal outlook on life, the professional stage in life are all factors that help give the audience vantage points that feel fully fleshed out and truly universal.  The depictions of maintained innocence amidst pure cynicism are powerful and truly lasting.  The prominent theme of fraternity is beautifully exposed through the interwoven relationships that become all the more evident in that closing scene.I highly recommend these films.  In pieces, they are exceptional, but seen as one whole they deliver a tremendous punch to the gut and linger in the mind with thought provoking accuracy.",5,Every color of the rainbow...,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,4064,"['One', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'Kieslowski', 'left', 'behind', 'impressive', 'resume', 'one', 'peaked', 'final', 'contribution', 'cinema', 'exceptional', 'trilogy', 'trilogy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'narrative', 'sense', 'carry', 'interwoven', 'themes', 'rather', 'splendidly', 'complete', 'work.In', 'Kieslowski', 'first', 'film', 'Trois', 'Couleurs', 'trilogy', 'liberty', 'not', 'political', 'sense', 'emotional', 'sense', 'truth', 'rings', 'loud', 'clear', 'course', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'Bleu', 'Julie', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'husband', 'son', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Having', 'been', 'car', 'family', 'being', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Julie', 'racked', 'guilt', 'sorrow', 'pained', 'very', 'thought', 'living', 'course', 'film', 'Julie', 'isolation', 'only', 'have', 'soul', 'liberated', 'emotional', 'desolation', 'former', 'life', 'uncovers', 'truths', 'was', 'unaware', 'Kieslowski', 'remarkable', 'job', 'shadowing', 'Julie', 'inner', 'conflictions', 'stunning', 'use', 'visuals', 'more', 'so', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'seep', 'frame', 'music', 'using', 'symbol', 'Julie', 'inability', 'true', 'isolation', 'eventual', 'liberation', 'Binoche', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'scene', 'deep', 'turmoil', 'Julie', 'experiencing', 'What', 'so', 'moving', 'Bleu', 'truly', 'progressive', 'film', 'maybe', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'films', 'trilogy', 'fully', 'out', 'Julie', 'complete', 'transformation', 'person', 'experiencing', 'grief', 'Kieslowski', 'truly', 'liberates', 'her.In', 'Blanc', 'second', 'film', 'trilogy', 'Kieslowski', 'equality', 'Using', 'divorcing', 'couple', 'Kieslowski', 'political', 'state', 'France', 'young', 'couple', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'Karol', 'Polish', 'immigrant', 'being', 'humiliated', 'French', 'wife', 'inability', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'Instead', 'simply', 'walking', 'away', 'situation', 'Karol', 'loss', 'love', 'rub', 'loss', 'face', 'point', 'where', 'out', 'intricate', 'devilish', 'revenge', 'order', 'attain', 'personal', 'equality', 'use', 'white', 'brilliant', 'here', 'more', 'pure', 'aspects', 'story', 'connect', 'Karol', 'man', 'anti-comedy', 'Blanc', 'lighter', 'look', 'Kieslowski', 'themes', 'never', 'feels', 'unimportant', 'depictions', 'Karol', 'eminent', 'rise', 'are', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'strength', 'trilogy', 'offer', 'true', 'glimpse', 'director', 'range.For', 'Kieslowski', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'least', 'trilogy', 'form', 'Rouge', 'final', 'film', 'Here', 'subject', 'fraternity', 'so', 'introducing', 'anti-romance', 'revolving', 'part-time', 'model', 'Valentine', 'retired', 'judge', 'Kern', 'two', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'when', 'Valentine', 'accidentally', 'Kern', 'dog', 'two', 'find', 'wrapped', 'web', 'emotional', 'connection', 'two', 'become', 'privy', 'lives', 'Kern', 'bitter', 'recluse', 'spies', 'neighbors', 'feed', 'cynical', 'outlook', 'Valentine', 'intrigued', 'hesitation', 'What', 'Rouge', 'so', 'impactful', 'way', 'Kieslowski', 'perfectly', 'out', 'themes', 'varied', 'means', 'polar', 'extremes', 'create', 'complete', 'picture', 'age', 'differences', 'personal', 'outlook', 'life', 'professional', 'stage', 'life', 'are', 'factors', 'help', 'give', 'audience', 'vantage', 'points', 'feel', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'truly', 'universal', 'depictions', 'maintained', 'innocence', 'amidst', 'pure', 'cynicism', 'are', 'powerful', 'truly', 'lasting', 'prominent', 'theme', 'fraternity', 'beautifully', 'exposed', 'interwoven', 'relationships', 'become', 'more', 'evident', 'closing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'films', 'pieces', 'are', 'exceptional', 'seen', 'one', 'whole', 'deliver', 'tremendous', 'punch', 'gut', 'linger', 'mind', 'thought', 'provoking', 'accuracy']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)

732355,A1L220BNTP6WYZ,B000083C5F,Charles Hugh Smith,"[7, 7]","I would be remiss if I didn't decry the injustice that none of the films or the director, Kieslowski, ever won an Oscar. In 1995 the screenplay for The third film, Red, was nominated for best original screenplay, and Kieslowski was nominated for best director; but alas, neither won. Inexcusably, the film wasn't even nominated for Best Foreign Film.Yet the Trilogy will undoubtedly endure while the Oscar winners of those years will be largely forgotten. Why? Well, let's start with all the Hollywood cliches about screenplays: story arc, plot points, blah blah blah. Open any screenwriting guide and you'll find that the first plot point arrives on page (and therefore minute) 20. Check it out. Twenty minutes into a film, something happens which causes the action to swerve in a new direction.If we follow up the idea that all art works from some ""center,"" some gravitational focal point which draws us in, then the vast majority of Hollywood films work from a a plot-driven center: a character must overcome an obstacle, there's something at stake which has to be resolved by a voyage, and so on. On ocasion, the center of a movie will be the transformation of a character. In a good movie, the two are seamlessly overlaid.Thus, in Casablanca, the ""something at stake"" is Victor Lazlow's escape to America, and the transformation is Rick's emergence from self-pity to understanding, sacrifice and action.To take but one of the Trilogy, Red. What makes Red so intriguing (other than its visual virtuosity) is the ambiguity at its center. Exactly what is the ""plot""? A model accidentally hits a dog and finds the owner, who feigns indifference. The model cares for the dog and establishes a vague sort of relationship with the owner, an irascible retired judge.Not much here in terms of story arc and other Hollywood conventions. But there is a beating heart to the story, perhaps even several. One is certainly ""contingency,"" a philosophic word for chance, serendipity and even synchronicity. Things happen in a causally linked but outwardly haphazard fashion.Another center in this film is intimacy, the difficulties of intimacy and the secrets plumbed or hidden in intimacy. The model's boyfriend seems to be extremely suspicious of her; during every call, he cross-examines her as if unbelieving she is truly alone. We never see him, we only hear his disembodied voice. When she asks him if he loves her, he replies, ""I think I do, which is the same thing."" She demurs. The retired judge, meanwhile, is secretly listening to the intimate phone conversations of his neighbors.A third center to the movie is how patterns of human behavior and relationships pop up again and again. Thus the judge's own story of a lover's betrayal is played out by a promising young lawyer, and perhaps also by the model's own relationship with the boyfriend. The charm of the film is that these patterns, overlays and elliptical references are not announced, they are hinted, suggested, brushed on in chiaroscuro.The use of color is unavoidably central in the films, as befits a series of movies named after the French tricolor flag, as are the themes of liberte, egalite et fraternite. Yet just as striking is the powerful deployment of music. You would be hard-pressed to name another film which wasn't specifically about music itself (i.e. The Last Waltz, etc.) with a better vocabulary of musical flourishes and colors. This is clearly referenced in the first film, Blue, whose main characters are composers and their lovers.The transformation of character is understated in Red, but it is nonetheless visible. The judge turns himself in for spying, and returns from his punishment a better man. His dog, the one he cared so little for at the beginning, has a litter of puppies. As for the model, her growth is nearly invisible, but we sense it beneath the surface. The film ends with her traveling to see her boyfriend in London, leaving us with the anticipation of some discovery, revelation and perhaps closure or renewal. Maybe the model hasn't changed much so far, but we sense that her experiences have prepared her to deal forthrightly with her boyfriend's infidelity.

732356,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000083C5F,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[2, 3]","Take three amazing films, update them for Blu-Ray, and release them in one set.  Success!  Like the Miramax release, all three of the Trois Coleurs Trilogie are in one shiny package (though I own the Miramax trilogy which is still available, I wanted to check into the Criterion version and so checked it out from my local library on Blu-Ray).  Criterion has done a wonderful job of the HD transfer to the Blu-Ray.  Though this is not quite a visual tour de force, there is a lot of detail in these films.  The most notable improvement is on Rouge, where the instances of darkness have been improved and sharpened so that the characters no longer wash out into the shadows.  It creates a crisp look that is probably the effect that was intended.The subtitles have been updated and improved upon, as is standard with Criterion editing.  There are some light liberties taken with translations in certain points, but it is all done with the intent of bringing across the point that the director was originally intended.  But 99% of the subtitling is accurate to what they characters are saying  (at least in Bleu and Roughe a French speaking friend told me).  And there is a 70+ page book included with all kinds of interesting essays and excerpts.Now onto the films.  Each is a masterpiece by itself.  They don't really seem to fit together, and they really don't... but they do.  Each is based on one of the colors and themes of the French flag and motto: Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity (Libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;).  Made more interesting since a Polish man directed them!Bleu was and is my personal favorite.  The acting is so strong in this film!  The scenes are lovingly shot and the use of music as a storytelling device is amazing.  Bleu is all about Libert&eacute;, and the liberation of a woman from her tragic, crippling past.  She must come to grips with the past and then begin to look towards the future and push forward through anguish.Blanc is more of a dark comedy that could have been based on a Shakespeare play.  A husband takes an interesting and twisted revenge on his wife.  It's overall based on &eacute;galit&eacute; (equality) and shows that a marriage (and society) is and should be a partnership of two equals.  It's the only film set in the director's native Poland.Rouge is the final film and it is based on fraternit&eacute;.  In it, two people form an unlikely friendship. The story is heartwarming at the core, and there are some peripheral stories that help illustrate the difference between their friendship and the relationships of people who are seemingly more compatible.  The use of light is of particular note in this film.  Artistically this is arguably the best of the three.A modern tour de force of film making. These three films have more feeling than many modern motion pictures and take one back to the glory days of the 50s and 60s French film industry. A wonderful series to add to any collection, and I must say that the Criterion Blu-Ray version is worth the price (which is pretty reasonable on amazon).",5,This is why I love The Criterion Collection !,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,3085,"['Take', 'three', 'amazing', 'films', 'update', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'one', 'set', 'Success', 'Miramax', 'release', 'three', 'Trois', 'Coleurs', 'Trilogie', 'are', 'one', 'shiny', 'package', 'own', 'Miramax', 'trilogy', 'still', 'available', 'wanted', 'check', 'Criterion', 'version', 'so', 'checked', 'out', 'local', 'library', 'Blu-Ray', 'Criterion', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'HD', 'transfer', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'quite', 'visual', 'tour', 'force', 'lot', 'detail', 'films', 'most', 'notable', 'improvement', 'Rouge', 'where', 'instances', 'darkness', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'sharpened', 'so', 'characters', 'no', 'longer', 'wash', 'out', 'shadows', 'crisp', 'look', 'probably', 'effect', 'was', 'intended.The', 'subtitles', 'have', 'been', 'updated', 'improved', 'upon', 'standard', 'Criterion', 'editing', 'are', 'light', 'liberties', 'taken', 'translations', 'certain', 'points', 'done', 'intent', 'bringing', 'point', 'director', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', '99', '%', 'subtitling', 'accurate', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'least', 'Bleu', 'Roughe', 'French', 'speaking', 'friend', 'told', '70+', 'page', 'book', 'included', 'kinds', 'interesting', 'essays', 'excerpts.Now', 'films', 'masterpiece', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'fit', 'together', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'based', 'one', 'colors', 'themes', 'French', 'flag', 'motto', 'Liberty', 'Equality', 'Fraternity', 'Libert', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'fraternit', 'eacute', 'Made', 'more', 'interesting', 'Polish', 'man', 'directed', 'Bleu', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'acting', 'so', 'strong', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'lovingly', 'shot', 'use', 'music', 'storytelling', 'device', 'amazing', 'Bleu', 'Libert', 'eacute', 'liberation', 'woman', 'tragic', 'crippling', 'past', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'past', 'then', 'begin', 'look', 'future', 'push', 'forward', 'anguish.Blanc', 'more', 'dark', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'husband', 'interesting', 'twisted', 'revenge', 'wife', 'overall', 'based', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'equality', 'marriage', 'society', 'should', 'be', 'partnership', 'two', 'equals', 'only', 'film', 'set', 'director', 'native', 'Poland.Rouge', 'final', 'film', 'based', 'fraternit', 'eacute', 'two', 'people', 'form', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'core', 'are', 'peripheral', 'stories', 'help', 'illustrate', 'difference', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'seemingly', 'more', 'compatible', 'use', 'light', 'particular', 'note', 'film', 'Artistically', 'arguably', 'best', 'three.A', 'modern', 'tour', 'force', 'film', 'making', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'more', 'feeling', 'many', 'modern', 'motion', 'pictures', 'take', 'one', 'back', 'glory', 'days', '50s', '60s', 'French', 'film', 'industry', 'wonderful', 'series', 'add', 'collection', 'must', 'say', 'Criterion', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'price', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'amazon']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)
732357,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000083C5F,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 10]","BLUE: I checked out the DVD and watched it last night, took some notes, but decided to wait a day before posting my thoughts. I waited because I'm having a hard time dealing with this movie. On the one hand, I think it, technically, is a masterfully directed film that kept me watching. On the other hand, most movies so obviously dealing with loss as a major theme have never touched me strongly. I'm always aware that I'm watching a movie. And in this case, I had conflicted feelings about Julie. I understand someone feeling a personal loss so greatly that he or she simply wants to retreat from everything. But at least half or more of the movie was about this emotional retreat. I began to want to shake her and say, ""Get on with your life."" There comes a time when sadness can become simply self indulgent. I also had difficulty finding an emotional bond with her. Discarding her husband's last manuscript, described as ""so beautiful,"" could be an act of emotional desolation, but it also is an act --within a movie -- of high vandalism. A person may be frightened of mice, in Julie's case more likely frightened of the sense of motherhood and dependence, but bringing a cat to kill and eat the mother mouse and her babies is an act of someone, however troubled, I wouldn't want to know. That she is distraught later helps me with her, but it doesn't do much for the mice.The movie is made up of so many sequences that, for me, don't build much resonance concerning Julie because, well, there are so many sequences. The emotionless love making with Olivier, the beggar with the flute, the situation with the prostitute in her apartment building, the young man bringing her the necklace, the old lady with the bottle, and so on. These and the other sequences are all masterfully done, but for me there are just too many of them dealing with Julie's frozen emotional state. Only when she begins to come out of it, when she invites her pregnant husband's mistress to the country house, helps the prostitute who sees her father in the audience, and then begins to help Olivier to finish the score...and agrees to jointly take credit with him and her husband, does the movie begin to pick up the pace. I know one can say that her emotional death is being shown by the slowness and ambiguity of the first two-thirds of the movie. Nonetheless, I think it was too much, at least for the story being told. However, for a movie being shown, it kept me watching. The use of brief blackouts to represent her emotional blackouts was absolutely masterful. I'd never seen it before. The ending, however, I felt was a little self conscious. Trying to bring all the people whom Julie had encountered, even briefly, into one big canvas to close the movie just seemed pushing it. On balance, as much as I liked much of the movie, I just couldn't escape the feeling every so often of, ""Hey, look what Kieslowski's doing now.""We all bring our own baggage to the movies we see and the books we read. These are comments from a person who has only seen the movie once, who can come close to crying if a dog is killed, but who sometimes gets impatient with a movie which deals with the emotional crises of intelligent and capable people.WHITE:  I much prefer irony to tragedy, and after Blue I was not sure what to look forward to with White. I wound up liking White a lot. Movies about ""the human condition"" are, for me, almost invariably obvious. While this movie does quite a bit of exploring about how a man reacts to love and the withdrawing of love, impotence and the power of performance, revenge and a circling back to love, I thought it was handled with such off-hand, dead-pan humor as to be a very sweet film. In a way, it struck me as an amuse-bouche, one of those unexpected treats that a first-rate chef will surprise a good customer with at the start of a meal or sometimes in between courses. The movie has that quality of freshness and unexpectedness.Zbigniew Zamachowski does a masterful job as Karol, a sad sack if there ever was one, who gradually shows determination as well as obsession. I suppose one must just accept obsession as an unexplainable plot device in a movie, but Dominique got off to a very unsympathetic start. She'd wilt most men. Karol's obsession with her seemed a bit unreal. I found Karol developing into a resourceful, intelligent guy whom I began to admire. Dominique, though, didn't seem to change much. After all she put Karol through -- unnecessarily cruel most of the time -- I couldn't empathize much with Karol, but simply accepted things as the reason why I was enjoying the movie. I couldn't help thinking that if Karol had just had a few Viagra handy, none of his troubles would have begun. But then I thought about Dominique's essential characteristics, and I think that Karol would be better off with somebody new. I don't see a future for them.One of the things I liked a lot about this movie is that it kept me guessing. Was it going to be a romantic comedy, or a black comedy or some kind of excruciatingly dull exploration of sexual inadequacy? Was Karol really just a sad loser when he seemed sort of resourceful in a sad, funny way? What was he trying to do with his property purchase? Where did Dominque fit in or was this just a cameo with Delpy? Was something sad going to happen after I'd figured out it seemed to be a combination black/romantic comedy? I like a movie that I can't quite see the end to.People have said that this movie is the equality part of the trio. I saw this movie as a clever, bittersweet struggle for dominance, not equality, and laced with a little revenge. I thought it was a sweet, bittersweet, clever movie.",4,"Serious, Clever: I Wish I Liked Them Better",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,5681,"['checked', 'out', 'DVD', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'took',

These are, without a doubt, my favorite films of the 1990s. The late Kieslowski was working at the top of his game and his presence in filmmaking is sorely missed. Blue and Red are my favorites out of the three, with Juliette Binoche illuminating every scene. Red (which is set in Geneva and not Paris as the amazon review incorrectly states)is a brilliant way to wrap the trilogy. Irene Jacob sparring with the great Jean Louis Tritignant in their lovely and heartbreaking scenes. There are so many wonderful moments, including the final moment when Jacob's face on the giant billboard becomes a haunting coda that will reduce you to tears...simply because it is shear genius on Kieslowski's part.

The three films are largely unconnected in their story lines but have similar construction:* Terrific casting* Each move has a lead or co-lead who is a beauty* Slow moving* Characters are deeply introspective and emotional* Generally few words by and among the major players however facial expressions and the ""unsaid"" pull you along and visually tell the story* Colors and cinematography project a dream-like state* The movie title colors (Blue/White/Red) are beautifully emphasized and subtly set in the each film (blue sky, blue water, blue chandelier).In Blue, the director's subject is ""liberty"" which is intended to represent emotional ""liberty.""  The film is set in Paris.  Julie's husband (a famous composer) and child are killed in a car accident.  In her grief, she tries to distance herself from her former life by cutting all her ties (sells her house and her belongings, gives away much of her money, moves and tells no one) - - but she finds that leaving it all behind is not so simple.  In her grief, she is also stunned to learn secrets about her family which further adds to her grief.  She eventually turns back to music as her solace and turns to an old friend for companionship and love - and both begin to pull her out of the darkness.In White, the director's subject is ""equality.""  Karol moves his wife from Poland to Paris where she proceeds to divorce him, humiliate him and abandon him because of his inability to consummate their marriage.  He is thrown out on the streets of Paris penniless.  Karol schemes to move back to Poland where he becomes a successful businessman and plots his revenge.  And revenge he gets at a significant personal cost.In Red, the director's subject is ""fraternity"" where he shows unrelated characters with little in common coming together to develop a close relationship.  The movie is set in Geneva where a professional model (Valentine) meets a retired judge in a chance meeting after she runs over his dog.  Valentine learns that the retired judge is listening in on his neighbors' phone conversations and she despises him for it.  She happens to visit him on several other occasions after she returns with the dog from the vet.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[15, 17]","Around here, red, white and blue are known as the colours of the American flag, and they are also the colours of the French flag.But they also are the names of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski's brilliant ""Three Colours"" trilogy. This man hasn't gotten the acclaim of more prominent European directors like Tom Tykwer, but his ""Three Colors"" trilogy has a delicacy that most directors can only dream of. Beautiful, painful, artfully shot, it's a visual feast for anyone who has an appreciation for beauty, subtlety, and good direction.In ""Blue,"" Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) and her family are in a car accident when their brakes fail. Julie is injured, but her composer husband and their daughter die. She can't bring herself to commit suicide, but neither can she just go home and get over it. So instead she leaves her palatial house in the country after a night with her husband's old friend Olivier (Benot R&eacute;gent), who has been in love with her for years.Julie arrives in Paris with nothing but a blue cut-glass lampshade, takes back her maiden name, rents an apartment, and tries to leave her old life behind. Though she says she doesn't want love or friends (because they are ""traps""), she befriends a promiscuous young woman and is pulled back to Olivier when he starts to finish her husband's unfinished work. In turn, Olivier reveals to her the side of her husband she never knew -- the other woman he loved.""Blanc"" is more of a comedy than a tragedy, but there is an element of sadness as well.Hairdresser Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is being coldly divorced by his beautiful wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) because she is sexually dissatisfied with him. She also strips him of his money and possessions, leaving him playing pitiful music at the subways. What's more, she rubs it in his face that she's now having sex with other men.Things can't get worse, right? Wrong: Karol goes back to Poland and ends up getting beaten up and robbed. Via some not-so-legal methods, Karol builds himself an impressive fortune and becomes determined to get back at his cold, manipulative ex-wife. Amid a web of killing, seduction and faked death, Karol finds the perfect method to bring Dominique down...And ""Rouge"" is the color of love. On her way home from a modelling session, Valentine (Irene Jacob) accidently runs over and injures a pregnant dog. The owner is Joseph Kern, (Jean-Louis Trintignant) an embittered, cynical ex-judge whose years of condemnation and acquittal have left him spiritually adrift. He now spends his time alone in his house, wiretapping the phones of his neighbors and predicting what will happen in their lives.After Valentine expresses disgust at Joseph's activities, he turns himself in to the authorities. Their friendship grows into a bond of differing values and unhappy histories. As Valentine prepares to leave for England, the judge reveals the tragic circumstances of his early life -- a tragedy mirrored by some of the people he has been spying on.The three colours of the French flag symbolize liberty, equality and fraternity -- and these are echoed in the stories of Kieslowski's films. And each of the three movies has its own ""feel"" -- ""Blue"" is cool and sensual, ""White"" was sharp and sexy, and ""Red"" has a sweetness and richness that is truly moving.And while most directors are just boring when they do slow, arty direction, Kieslowski infused his direction with sensual beauty and endless light and colour, like a painting come to life. And he intertwined many symbolic images and lingering threads from one movie to the next, whether it's an old lady recycling bottles or a rather surprising finale for ""Red"" that brings all three movies' protagonists together.And he saturated the movies with the colour of their title -- blue is sadness, depth and beauty; white is beautiful and pure, stark and blinding; red is passion and warmth. While this may not have been Kieslowski's intention, the constant presence of these colors (a bridal gown, a swimming pool, and so on) add an extra dimension to the emotions in the story, especially the first.Juliette Binoche is an extremely good actress, and this movie uses her expressiveness as most movies don't. Zamachowski brings an element of humanity and poignancy to what could have been an idiotic character, and I never felt anything but understanding for this guy. And Irene Jacob brings a sweetness and innocence to her role as Valentine (aptly named, considering the title of the movie she stars in) that is rarely seen in modern movies.Kieslowski was an unusual and extremely talented moviemaker, and his ""Three Colors"" trilogy -- ""Bleu,"" ""Blanc"" and ""Rouge"" -- is an exceptional piece of work.

732363,A3M3FG82ZE1J8I,B000083C5F,"Ed N ""Ed""","[100, 108]","The Three Colors Trilogy comprises 3 superb films (Bleu/Blanc/Rouge) by the late, great director Krzysztof Kieslowski. The films use the symbolism expressed by the colors of the French flag for their themes (liberty, equality, fraternity). The Three Colors is Kieslowski's crowning achievement, and Rouge, his final film, is probably his masterpiece. That's saying something, because some of his previous films (Decalogue, The Double Life of Veronique) are among the greatest films of the last 20 years! I saw Bleu (with Juliette Binoche) a long time ago and was very impressed. It's a sad but beautful movie, about a composer's widow and how she copes with life after his death. Blanc (with Julie Delpy) is about life for a man after he is unceremoniously dumped by his wife; it's the lightest and most comedic of the three films. Rouge (with Irene Jacob) is my favorite and explores the melancholy (and platonic) relationship that develops between a young lady and an older man. Jacob is quite simply a goddess, and if you can tear your eyes away from her long enough to pay attention to the movie, you'll find this is a thematically rich film with solid, subtle performances (Kieslowski was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Rouge in 1995). I am lucky enough to own a DVD of Rouge which has a ton of extras (making of, deleted scenes, soundtrack samples, trailers, film-making lesson by the director, Cannes festival interviews, extended interviews with editor, director, and *sigh* Irene Jacob). I believe the upcoming Miramax DVDs retain these features (with subtitles), which are in French. More Americans should experience these films. They are so well-made and lovingly crafted that they put to shame all the multi-million dollar, shallow, explosion-fests routinely shovelled out by Hollywood nowadays. Next to Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa, Krzysztof Kieslowski's death in the 1990s is one of the most tragic for cinema. Younger filmmakers should hope one day to approach even an iota of the MANY brilliant masterpieces created of these film masters. Watch The Three Colors Trilogy!

732364,A2LO5XLG3G50PL,B000083C5F,Eric Swanger,"[5, 6]","I am referring to Blue exclusively here.It was the first of the trilogy to be released, and I think the strongest of the trilogy, as well as the most rewarding to see by itself.Juliette Binoche is nothing short of a revelation here.  Her performance is so emotionally naked and raw, it is almost hard to watch.  Her study of a woman consumed with the loss of her husband and only child is devastating.  Binoche is one of those actors that can convey more emotion in a look or an expression than most can with an epic monologue.  In fact, what I took away from the film initially is how much was unleashed without really saying much of anything.  She is perfect for this role, and it is arguably the best performance of her career thus far, and one in which she won a Cesar award for Best Actress.The style of the film is totally unique.  There are breathtaking moments of genius spread throughout the film.  The camera is such a languid yet probing force in Blue, showing you things that are out of view and lending fascinating perspective to the characters.  There is a shot I recall in a hospital, when the camera has a tight shot on an eye, only to reveal a doctor looking down to the patient.  It is remarkable that these elements do not feel gimmicky at all.  They simply become part of the language of the story.  The cinematography is just gorgeous.  The colors and the use of focus add tension and depth to the visual space, leaving some images behind that are both abstract and precise.I remember feeling really out of touch when I left the theatre after seeing Blue.  It is so cliche, but I really felt like I had been dreaming.  The images that I recalled reminded me of the kinds you recall when you wake up from a dream.  You have a series of images or situations, and are kind of left to extrapulate what they mean.  This film is very similar.  Even though the story has played itself out in a way that is easy to understand, there are so many elements that float to the surface that are puzzling, and leave traces of themselves behind.  The ending is often explained by different people in many different ways, and this is one of the most marvelous things about the film.  It leaves a lot to the imagination, which is a criminally underappreciated tactic in films today.I was quite thrilled to hear the Trilogy was coming out on DVD, because it was impossible to find a copy of Blue in any format for quite some time.  I had relied on an overused VHS of the film for years, and taped it once when it was playing on Bravo.  The problem was that Bravo edits almost everything, so I was pretty sure I was missing parts of the movie.If you have never seen this film, please allow yourself the opportunity.  It is one of my all-time personal favorites, and probably one of the best films to survive the 1990's.",5,The most haunting film I can think of...,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,2820,"['am', 'referring', 'Blue', 'exclusively', 'here.It', 'was', 'first', 'trilogy', 'be', 'released', 'think', 'strongest', 'trilogy', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'rewarding', 'see', 'itself.Juliette', 'Binoche', 'nothing', 'short', 'revelation', 'here', 'performance', 'so', 'emotionally', 'naked', 'raw', 'almost', 'hard', 'watch', 'study', 'woman', 'consumed', 'loss', 'husband', 'only', 'child', 'devastating', 'Binoche', 'one', 'actors', 'can', 'convey', 'more', 'emotion', 'look', 'expression', 'most', 'can', 'epic', 'monologue', 'fact', 'what', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'initially', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'unleashed', 'really', 'saying', 'much', 'anything', 'perfect', 'role', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'thus', 'far', 'one', 'won', 'Cesar', 'award', 'Best', 'Actress.The', 'style', 'film', 'totally', 'unique', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'moments', 'genius', 'spread', 'film', 'camera', 'such', 'languid', 'yet', 'probing', 'force', 'Blue', 'showing', 'things', 'are', 'view', 'lending', 'fascinating', 'perspective', 'characters', 'shot', 'recall', 'hospital', 'when', 'camera', 'tight', 'shot', 'eye', 'only', 'reveal', 'doctor', 'looking', 'down', 'patient', 'remarkable', 'elements', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'gimmicky', 'simply', 'become', 'part', 'language', 'story', 'cinematography', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'colors', 'use', 'focus', 'add', 'tension', 'depth', 'visual', 'space', 'leaving', 'images', 'are', 'abstract', 'precise.I', 'remember', 'feeling', 'really', 'touch', 'when', 'left', 'theatre', 'seeing', 'Blue', 'so', 'cliche', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'dreaming', 'images', 'recalled', 'reminded', 'kinds', 'recall', 'when', 'wake', 'up', 'dream', 'have', 'series', 'images', 'situations', 'are', 'kind', 'left', 'extrapulate', 'what', 'mean', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'Even', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'way', 'easy', 'understand', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'float', 'surface', 'are', 'puzzling', 'leave', 'traces', 'ending', 'often', 'explained', 'different', 'people', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'one', 'most', 'marvelous', 'things', 'film', 'lot', 'imagination', 'criminally', 'underappreciated', 'tactic', 'films', 'today.I', 'was', 'quite', 'thrilled', 'hear', 'Trilogy', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'impossible', 'find', 'copy', 'Blue', 'format', 'quite', 'time', 'had', 'relied', 'overused', 'VHS', 'film', 'years', 'taped', 'once', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'Bravo', 'problem', 'was', 'Bravo', 'almost', 'everything', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'missing', 'parts', 'movie.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'please', 'allow', 'opportunity', 'one', 'all-time', 'personal', 'favorites', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'survive', '1990']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)

Juliet Binenois(SP) plays a character who after losing her husband and daughter tries to give up on living, not suicide but isolation from her past. The music and the use of the color blue are magical. As Julie tries to isolate her self she still can't avoid human contact, and in the end she can not escape who and what she is. This a movie of realizing that life must continue after loss and that is a sin against ones self to denign what is great inside ones self.White is a tale of revenge agaist an man who loves his wife and who was loved by his wife until his impotence destroys the marriage. The man knows that if he can have his wife leave france and go to his native poland than impotence will turn to sex lust and love. This is about how every man wants and how in desperation will do anything to love the one woman he desires most among others. This is the most comic of the trilogy and the vengence theme which I will not give away is comic as the need for vengeance and love often is.The third tale is about the longing for life at any age and how we all find our true love when we don't expect it.

The movies are rightly understated, smart and well crafted.  I highly suggest watching them in order BLUE, WHITE, and RED and watch how things just comes perfectly together in RED.  Kieslowski excellent use of music in BLUE is nothing short of amazing and is also acts and an unseen character. Plus Juliette Binoche is amazing to watch.  She is extremely convincing as a woman in real grief.  White starring another well known French actress, Julie Delpy and polish actor Zbigniew Zamachowski is more comedic and the actor plots his revenge on his French ex-wife and then there is the magnificent of Red starring Irene Jacob, as a young model who discovers an ex-judge has been listening on the conversation of those around him.  I don't speak a lick of french and the films are in French with English subtitle, but after awhile, you will forget you are reading and become engrossed in just good story tellling.  It is not for those who are looking for the type of drama, we here in America are use to, but this is CLEARLY the best foreign films ever made.  I recommend this only for older audiences (over 25) probably over 30.  There may be a few younger folks who may get into this, but this film is for people who appreciate a nicely even, perhaps slow paced film.  I am not trying to be an elitist, far from it.  I wish that everyone would view these films for themselves because they are crafted so well and the filming is so smart.  The colors represent the color AND meaning of the colors of the French flag.

All three are in some way about human relationships, and they manage to convey the intensity such relationships can take in an interesting way. The problem is that the stories at times veer over in what i feel is unreflective self-parody. In a sense, they become too self-referential and the plausibility of the situation is lost in the process. This is not as apparent in the first movie as in the second and third. But by the third movie it becomes slightly annoying. At the same time the narrational outline of the third movie was the one i found most appealing.Apart from the excessive self-referential symbolism the imagery is quite powerful, and the stories are incredibly charming.

732370,A2RNUPVSNW1ZXX,B000083C5F,Heather Walton,"[2, 3]","I just rewatched all three movies again and I must say that Red is by far the best film where magic happend. The other two just are not up to par with Red, but Red is an exceptional film that is so rare to find. Red was so relaxing to watch! It feels like a poem or watching a painting come to life. I believe it is about how compassion, or opening of the heart, splits all notions of time and space and exposes a different reality that is just outside the one we are living in, as in an alternate reality. The powerful force of a compassionate heart changes the destiny of several lives. It is a story about the breaking through to the divine within the human heart that connects us all; the mysterious dimension of the universe that is not available to the senses and is much bigger then the human seen dimension.The woman in the movie, Valentine, was sad and went through the motions of her life seemingly disconnected from herself and her happiness. Her boyfriend was jealous and was not sure he loved her, and her brother was on the streets from drug use and Valentine seemed to be void of life, even though she was a successful model and ballerina dancer. As they showed her life they also showed the life of her across the street neighbor. He was studying to become a Judge and he too had a life that was not fulfilling or living up to his potential. Valentine and the young man never met, but their stories intertwined as if they were just out of sync with time. Mysterious and spiritual forces worked in the background weaving their lives together.One day Valentine was driving around sad and she hit a dog. She jumped out of the car and saw the dog was bleeding. She took it to the owner outside of town. He was a dejected and bitter older retired Judge, who spent his time listening in on telephone conversations of his neighbors through a radio he setup. Once Valentine heard the conversations she became agitated and told him it is wrong. She was a sweet innocent young woman pure in beauty and their lives touched. Her loving heart changed him and he later turned himself into the police and they shut down his radio for good. She saw that in the paper and went to see him. It was his birthday and they shared some peach brandy and talked about their lives. She was to go see her boyfriend and he told her to take the Ferry. She bought a ticket.Meanwhile the young Judge found out his girlfriend was cheating on him and he got dejected and followed her around. He too got a ticket on the same ferry as Valentine. The older Judge came to see Valentine at her modeling show and he told her similar stories of his life that mirrored the life of the young Judge. He then told her the story of his love cheating on him, just like the young Judge's story but having it end there with him lost never finding love again. Then he said that maybe the woman he never met was Valentine, making the story really feel magical like the alternate reality, just out of sync with time, would happen. And when the Ferryboat capsized and we saw the survivors as Valentine and the young Judge, we knew they would have the life they were both meant to have and somehow the older Judge would have that life too.Excellent movie that just feels so good. The streets of the small European town, the building and their environments were all so beautiful and magical as well. I like those big coffee cups and the warm cozy feel of their lives. No cell phones, no TV's just life pure and simple and how compassion can open the heart and transform lives so profoundly that lost lives can become renewed and the very reality of time as we know it can be changed forever. Love is the healing force of the world that is what is required to transcend stuck sorrowful lives.

Go see 'Blue' first, and if you don't get it at on a first viewing, see it at least three times.  The themes of death, birth and reawakening abound in this tale of transforming tragedy to vitality.  'White' I believe is slightly weaker than the other two, but 'Red' is a masterpiece--brilliantly rendered, with themes of chance, destiny, the eccentricities of the human spirit, the cyclical nature of human existence, etc.  If you don't get it all at first, be patient and if you still don't get it after a while, you need to learn about art, film, and life.  So go learn, and see it when you're ready. I don't particularly recommend the rather unctuous commentary of Annette Insdorf--who sometimes is pespicacious, and at other times a bit silly, for example, in 'Red' she points out the various places red is displayed in a shot--unless one is color blind such commentary sounds very silly. She also makes cross-references to images from other films such as those from The Decalogue series and to The Conformist, which is all well and good if you are a film buff but commentary on DVD's shouldn't take on the air of a film seminar; eventually her erudition takes on a graduate student's tenor",5,Brilliant,1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,1326,"['are', 'dazzling', 'understated', 'films', 'demonstrate', 'film', 'art', 'can', 'approach', 'sophistication', 'finest', 'music', 'literature', 'Go', 'see', ""'Blue"", 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'viewing', 'see', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'themes', 'death', 'birth', 'reawakening', 'abound', 'tale', 'transforming', 'tragedy', 'vitality', 'believe', 'slightly', 'weaker', 'other', 'two', ""'Red"", 'masterpiece', 'brilliantly', 'rendered', 'themes', 'chance', 'destiny', 'eccentricities', 'human', 'spirit', 'cyclical', 'nature', 'human', 'existence', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'be', 'patient', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'while', 'need', 'learn', 'art', 'film', 'life', 'So', 'go', 'learn', 'see', 'when', ""'re"", 'ready', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'recommend', 'rather', 'unctuous', 'commentary', 'Annette', 'Insdorf', 'who', 'sometimes', 'pespicacious', 'other', 'times', 'bit', 'silly', 'example', ""'Red"", 'out', 'various', 'places', 'red', 'displayed', 'shot', 'one', 'color', 'such', 'commentary', 'sounds', 'very', 'silly', 'also', 'cross-references', 'images', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Decalogue', 'series', 'Conformist', 'well', 'good', 'are', 'film', 'buff', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'air', 'film', 'seminar', 'eventually', 'erudition', 'graduate', 'student', 'tenor']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)
732372,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000083C5F,Joseph Haschka,"[10, 13]","The RED, WHITE and BLUE trilogy refers to the colors of the French flag. This must be a declaration of patriotism or admiration from the films' director, Krzysztof Kieslowski, since the various storylines mostly take place outside France. Go figure.In BLUE, Julie (Juliette Binoche) mentally recuperates from the loss of her family in an auto accident, of which she was the only survivor. In WHITE, Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) emotionally recovers from a humiliating divorce and shabby treatment by his ex. In RED, Valentine (Irene Jacob) copes after injuring a dog with her car.Though each film is a complete story in itself, BLUE and WHITE must be viewed before RED. At RED's conclusion, a most improbable happenstance brings together the major characters of all three films. The trilogy's lesson appears to be that life is a series of coincidences, and the potential for personal growth from any connection between one or more individuals is a mine of great richness if one cares to work it. Humans are reputed to be a social species. However, the set is perhaps best appreciated by a &quot;people person&quot;, who relishes the interaction of daily encounters whether random or not. I'm not that sort (much to my wife's perpetual disgust), so my regard for the series is somewhat muted.RED, WHITE and BLUE also make the point that there's commonality in the experiences of varied individuals. In each film, the major character observes an old person struggling to insert an empty bottle into the elevated aperture of a large, curbside container for recyclables. Only in RED does the protagonist (Valentine) give assistance. Perhaps the director had more in mind here, but it only indicated to me that Valentine was the more generous and less self-absorbed of the three, and, on a larger scale, that reaction to a set stimulus is not uniform among individuals.I recognize the ability of the trilogy to inspire opinionated discussion, which, as long as it doesn't degenerate into name-calling and fisticuffs, is a swell thing, especially over pizza and beer. I liked the series for its visuals - it continually held my interest - but I'm not such a deep thinker as to regard it as the Greatest Cinematic Achievement Ever. Sometimes, I think, symbology can be overwrought to the point of detriment.

732373,AO461REE0KA4J,B000083C5F,keviny01,"[126, 130]","The late great Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski cleverly ""adapted"" the three French ideals -- liberty, equality, fraternity -- into three thought-provoking modern-day dramas about people who cope with personal  losses and tragedies.  In BLUE, the first of the trilogy, a widow tries to set herself free (and gain liberty) from her emotional baggages.  The second film, WHITE, is about a jilted man's outrageous plot to get even (thus, equality) with his ex-wife.  The last film, RED, which is also Kieslowski's final film before he died in 1996, is about a lonely old man who is embittered by the memories of his youth and finds accidental companionship (fraternity) with a young model.  All three films are understated in their tone, economical in their dialogs, elliptical in their editing and plotting (there are some mind-boggling flashbacks and flash forwards in WHITE), and haunting in their atmosphere.The references to the three French ideals are actually quite tenuous, and in fact more and more so as the trilogy progresses.  BLUE is the only one that deals with the ideal of ""freedom"" (albeit emotional freedom) in a concrete way, inviting us to ponder its meanings and its attainability.  WHITE treats the concept of ""equality"" in a rather subversive and satiric way, and it clearly wants us to rethink its meanings rather than accepting it at face value.  And RED has to do with ""fraternity"" only circumstantially, and has more to do with the issue of destiny, and how our past is linked to our present.  The three films are set not just in France, but also in Poland and Switzerland, and WHITE has primarily Polish dialogs.  Hence, a sort of universality is intended.The three films are also linked in various ways.  All three films involve an unfaithful lover who dies, in one way or another.  All three films involve a chance encounter between the distressed protagonist and a sympathetic observer -- the widow and the mistress in BLUE, Karol and Mikolaj in WHITE, the retired judge and the model in RED.  Both BLUE and WHITE are about people who move to new surroundings to escape from his or her troubled pasts.  And RED, ironically, is about someone who never leaves his home in order to wallow in his self-pity.Kieslowski had done this sort of thing before.  In 1988, he ""adapted"" the Ten Commandments into ten one-hour, modern-day dramas, collectively titled DECALOGUE, that make us rethink the meanings of the commandments.  In the segment for ""Thou Shalt Not Steal,"" for instance, we witness the kidnapping (the theft) of a child from her adopted parents by her natural mother, who thinks she has a right to her custody.  Thus, it turns clear-cut moral ideals into real-world dramas that have no clear-cut solutions or judgments.Miramax released long-awaited Region-1 DVDs for the Three Colors trilogy, and they all have superb video transfers and rewarding extra material.  Kieslowski expert Annette Insdorf provides excellent running commentaries for all three films.  She analyzes the visual, aural, and editorial techniques, the thematic significance, as well as how the final films deviate from their original screenplays.  She points out that Kieslowski films often deal with abstract concepts, such as fate, death, and grief, in very concrete ways.  She makes an observant remark about the apparent twist of fate in the opening of BLUE: if the hitchhiker were picked up by the family, the ensuing tragedy might not occur.  She points out that the dream-like wedding scene in WHITE, which many assume is a flashback, could also be a flash forward (a very interesting, and plausible, notion).  She offers her interpretations to the many symbolisms in the films, such as the frequent fades to black in BLUE, the recurring shot of a stooped old person at a garbage bin, the significance of the concerto music in BLUE, the tango theme in WHITE, and the bolero score in RED.  She also explains the intentionally cryptic endings of WHITE and RED.Each disc comes with several featurettes that comprise about 100 minutes of interviews and commentaries by the cast and crew, Insdorf, film critic Geoff Andrew, and film director Agnieszka Holland.  The BLUE and WHITE discs also contain some early short films by Kieslowski: CONCERT OF WISHES, THE TROLLEY, THE FACE, THE OFFICE.  All three discs contain a fascinating segment called ""Kieslowski's Cinema Lesson,"" in which the director explains his intentions in one particular scene.  The WHITE and RED discs contain behind-the-scenes footage of Kieslowski giving directions on the set.  For Kieslowski fans, perhaps the most poignant clip in these supplements is that of Kieslowski announcing his retirement at the '94 Cannes festival, included on the RED disc.",5,The Trilogy DVD set from Miramax,1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,4735,"['late', 'great', 'Polish', 'director', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'cleverly', 'adapted', 'three', 'French', 'ideals', 'liberty', 'equality', 'fraternity', 'three', 'thought-provoking', 'modern-day', 'dramas', 'people', 'who', 'cope', 'personal', 'losses', 'tragedies', 'BLUE', 'first', 'trilogy', 'widow', 'tries', 'set', 'free', 'gain', 'liberty', 'emotional', 'baggages', 'second', 'film', 'WHITE', 'jilted', 'man', 'outrageous', 'plot', 'get', 'even', 'thus', 'equality', 'ex-wife', 'last', 'film', 'RED', 'also', 'Kieslowski', 'final', 'film', 'died', '1996', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'embittered', 'memories', 'youth', 'accidental', 'companionship', 'fraternity', 'young', 'model', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'understated', 'tone', 'economical', 'dialogs', 'elliptical', 'editing', 'plotting', 'are', 'mind-boggling', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'WHITE', 'haunting', 'atmosphere.The', 'references', 'three', 'French', 'ideals', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'tenuous', 'fact', 'more', 'more', 'so', 'trilogy', 'BLUE', 'only', 'one', 'ideal', 'freedom', 'emotional', 'freedom', 'concrete', 'way', 'inviting', 'ponder', 'meanings', 'attainability', 'WHITE', 'concept', 'equality', 'rather', 'subversive', 'satiric', 'way', 'clearly', 'rethink', 'meanings', 'rather', 'accepting', 'face', 'value', 'RED', 'do', 'fraternity', 'only', 'circumstantially', 'more', 'do', 'issue', 'destiny', 'how', 'past', 'linked', 'present', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'set', 'not', 'just', 'France', 'also', 'Poland', 'Switzerland', 'WHITE', 'primarily', 'Polish', 'dialogs', 'Hence', 'sort', 'universality', 'intended.The', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'also', 'linked', 'various', 'ways', 'three', 'films', 'involve', 'unfaithful', 'lover', 'who', 'one', 'way', 'three', 'films', 'involve', 'chance', 'encounter', 'distressed', 'protagonist', 'sympathetic', 'observer', 'widow', 'mistress', 'BLUE', 'Karol', 'Mikolaj', 'WHITE', 'retired', 'judge', 'model', 'RED', 'BLUE', 'WHITE', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'move', 'new', 'surroundings', 'escape', 'troubled', 'pasts', 'RED', 'ironically', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'home', 'order', 'wallow', 'self-pity.Kieslowski', 'had', 'done', 'sort', 'thing', '1988', 'adapted', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'ten', 'one-hour', 'modern-day', 'dramas', 'collectively', 'titled', 'DECALOGUE', 'make', 'rethink', 'meanings', 'commandments', 'segment', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Not', 'Steal', 'instance', 'witness', 'kidnapping', 'theft', 'child', 'adopted', 'parents', 'natural', 'mother', 'who', 'right', 'custody', 'Thus', 'clear-cut', 'moral', 'ideals', 'real-world', 'dramas', 'have', 'clear-cut', 'solutions', 'judgments.Miramax', 'released', 'long-awaited', 'Region-1', 'DVDs', 'Three', 'Colors', 'trilogy', 'have', 'superb', 'video', 'transfers', 'rewarding', 'extra', 'material', 'Kieslowski', 'expert', 'Annette', 'Insdorf', 'excellent', 'running', 'commentaries', 'three', 'films', 'visual', 'aural', 'editorial', 'techniques', 'thematic', 'significance', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'final', 'films', 'deviate', 'original', 'screenplays', 'out', 'Kieslowski', 'films', 'often', 'deal', 'abstract', 'concepts', 'such', 'fate', 'death', 'grief', 'very', 'concrete', 'ways', 'observant', 'remark', 'apparent', 'twist', 'fate', 'opening', 'BLUE', 'hitchhiker', 'were', 'picked', 'up', 'family', 'ensuing', 'tragedy', 'might', 'not', 'occur', 'out', 'dream-like', 'wedding', 'scene', 'WHITE', 'many', 'assume', 'flashback', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'flash', 'forward', 'very', 'interesting', 'plausible', 'notion', 'interpretations', 'many', 'symbolisms', 'films', 'such', 'frequent', 'fades', 'black', 'BLUE', 'recurring', 'shot', 'stooped', 'old', 'person', 'garbage', 'bin', 'significance', 'concerto', 'music', 'BLUE', 'tango', 'theme', 'WHITE', 'bolero', 'score', 'RED', 'also', 'intentionally', 'cryptic', 'endings', 'WHITE', 'RED.Each', 'disc', 'several', 'featurettes', 'comprise', '100', 'minutes', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'crew', 'Insdorf', 'film', 'critic', 'Geoff', 'Andrew', 'film', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 'BLUE', 'WHITE', 'discs', 'also', 'contain', 'early', 'short', 'films', 'Kieslowski', 'CONCERT', 'OF', 'WISHES', 'THE', 'TROLLEY', 'THE', 'FACE', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'three', 'discs', 'contain', 'fascinating', 'segment', 'called', 'Kieslowski', 'Cinema', 'Lesson', 'director', 'intentions', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'WHITE', 'RED', 'discs', 'contain', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'Kieslowski', 'giving', 'directions', 'set', 'Kieslowski', 'fans', 'perhaps', 'most', 'poignant', 'clip', 'supplements', 'Kieslowski', 'announcing', 'retirement', ""'94"", 'Cannes', 'festival', 'included', 'RED', 'disc']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)
732374,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,B000083C5F,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[2, 2]","Among the pleasures of watching a Krzysztof Kieslowski film is that you really have to pay attention to what's going on at the present in order to really understand what happens later. And I'm not talking about the major incidents, I'm saying that what often seems insignificant at the time proves to be the portentous key on which the story turns. Kieslowski honed that technique with his masterful Decalogue, and he works it to full efflorescence in the Three Colors Trilogy.I am not going to rehash the stories as so many others have done so well. But I will say that these are three of the finest moral dramas I've seen in years. Kieslowski forces the viewer to consider many angles on a question he/she may have never considered. His films are almost like short courses in logic and philosophy, but much more interesting.I like all three films very much, but I think that White is the cleverest and is the most humorous as well. Blue and Red are far more serious and demand the most intellectual engagement. It doesn't hurt one's attention span that the female leads are all attractive and sexy in their own very different ways.Some viewers used to fast-paced American films may find these three masterworks too low-key and methodical for their tastes. And methodical they may be although they never fail to surprise. But if you are one who prefers films that are intellectually stimulating and ultimately satisfying, then the Three Colors Trilogy may be for you. Be sure to watch them in the order of Blue, White, then Red.

It may be worth mentioning that the stories are largely unconnected (although they do intersect at certain times). This isn't really a narrative trilogy (like Star Wars), but a thematic one. Each film is named after a color of the French flag, and is supposed to represent the same ideal (Blue=Liberty, White=Equality, Red=Fraternity). But these concepts take on slightly twisted forms in the films; for example, Blue begins with a woman being ""liberated"" from an unhappy marriage by means of a car accident which kills her husband and child. Liberty is great, but it can also be violent and emotionally painful. The Three Colors films challenge us to see these kinds of complications in what we otherwise may take for granted.In case the above paragraph didn't make this clear, these films are not easy viewing. They are slow, they are not in English, and they most likely will demand multiple viewings to fully appreciate.

But I've bought and watched almost everything that this Polish director has directed and made. I love his movies so much, that now I would like to go visit Poland someday because of him. Kieslowski puts so much thought into his films. Even the music plays important roles in his films. All of his films are hauntingly beautiful. The themes and subtle symbols you find in his movies keep you thinking and reflecting deeply about the different messages Kieslowski is sending long after the movies end. I can't express enough how deep and beautiful his movies are. Kieslowski was such a unique director. His movies were raw and true art in motion. He was truly one of a kind, and I honestly believe that there is no filmmaker out there who can match the brilliance of this man's masterpieces. The Colors Trilogy is the ultimate masterpiece. My favorites out of the trilogy are ""Blue"" and ""Red"". Juliette Binoche is one of my favorite actresses of all time. And she is so deep and intense in ""Blue"". Juliette Binoche is the type of actress who gives it her all, and she doesn't disappoint in ""Blue"". If you want to see fine acting by a female actress, watch Juliette Binoche in ""Blue"" - from her crunching on her daughter's blue lollipop to her scraping her hand across the rock wall to her letting the top of the piano slam down - this woman is so deep and really raw in her acting. Juliette Binoche is fearless. I also love ""Red"" because it ties ""Blue"", ""White"", and ""Red"" together. Irene Jacob does a great job in ""Red"". She also did a great job in ""The Double Life of Veronique"". She's like a gentle soul. One of my best friends from my undergraduate college school years knew that I was a big fan of Krzysztof Kieslowski and Juliette Binoche. She said that she went to the movie theater with a friend of hers and that after ""Red"" ended, the whole audience stood up and clapped and gave the film a standing ovation, and that was in my college town!

White was the only one that kept me interested.Because these movies are misunderstood, it will take time before he will be recognised in the future as one of the greatest directors of all time. I would liken him to the animator/writer/director of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. He wrote and directed the entire production. The key in why these are great are their subtlety.After watching the movie again with the commentary track, I realized all the numerous clues of symbolism, using light and reflection and angles and positioning and colors he uses to give hints and clues to the viewer in what seems a boring ordinary story of everyday life. He replicates images throughout the movie, and once it's pointed out, one sees the movie in and entirely different viewpoint. I totally missed most of them, and the true symbolism and themes which pervade the movies. I would have said pulp fiction was better too, but now I believe Red should've won the Cannes award that year, except there were too many dummies like me in the audience who just didnt get it.

732390,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000083C5F,Wesley Mullins,"[9, 11]","""Red,"" ""White,"" and ""Blue"" is a trilogy of French films made by Polish-born filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, widely considered to be the one of the greatest European directors of the late 20th century.  Each film follows emotionally damaged characters in modern French society, as they try to deal with their own unique angst.  The films are presented in such an honest, gritty manner that they nearly create the appearance of a documentary, as we the viewers get the impression that we are somehow intruding on their lives.  We get a voyeur's glimpse into their daily activities and experience with them their joy, excitement and most often, pain.These movies have the traditional European feel.  They are simple little tales that play out in an unrushed narrative.  Sadly, the only films like this we can see in America are found in the ""foreign"" section of our local video store.  An interesting note about this collection is that each film features beautiful actresses who have subsequently found moderate success in Hollywood (Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy and Irene Jacob).Of the three, I prefer ""White,"" but most critics claim ""Red"" is the best.  Fans of European dramas will love this collection, and anyone with a desire to begin exploring foreign cinema could make no better selection for their first title.",4,Three little gems,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,1316,"['Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'trilogy', 'French', 'films', 'made', 'Polish-born', 'filmmaker', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'European', 'directors', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'characters', 'modern', 'French', 'society', 'try', 'deal', 'own', 'unique', 'angst', 'films', 'are', 'presented', 'such', 'honest', 'gritty', 'manner', 'nearly', 'create', 'appearance', 'documentary', 'viewers', 'get', 'impression', 'are', 'somehow', 'intruding', 'lives', 'get', 'voyeur', 'glimpse', 'daily', 'activities', 'experience', 'joy', 'excitement', 'most', 'often', 'pain.These', 'movies', 'have', 'traditional', 'European', 'feel', 'are', 'simple', 'little', 'tales', 'play', 'out', 'unrushed', 'narrative', 'Sadly', 'only', 'films', 'can', 'see', 'America', 'are', 'found', 'foreign', 'section', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'interesting', 'note', 'collection', 'film', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'subsequently', 'found', 'moderate', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Irene', 'Jacob', '.Of', 'three', 'prefer', 'White', 'most', 'critics', 'claim', 'Red', 'best', 'Fans', 'European', 'dramas', 'will', 'love', 'collection', 'anyone', 'desire', 'begin', 'exploring', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'could', 'make', 'better', 'selection', 'first', 'title']",Three Colors Trilogy; (Blue / White / Red)
732391,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000083C5F,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 4]","After more than a decade, I still consider Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue, White, and Red to be the most remarkable trilogy I've ever seen. When I saw these 3 films, I was still an adolescent, and I was so moved and mesmerized. Now that I get a repete viewing, I still enjoy them tremendously!BLUE: ""Juliette Binoche rises from the ""deep-blue"" ocean of trauma and depression.""Before Juliette Binoche made her Oscar-winning The English Patient and Oscar nominated Chocolat, she gave a ""deep-blue"" performance in Blue that won her the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival. When I saw Blue, I instantly became her fan, depite the fact that she played a nasty role in Damage(Jeremy Iron) that same year.Blue will always be her signature movie, because it's the most challenging role she's ever played, and it's definitely more powerful than the performances from Julie Delpy(White) and Iron Jacob(Red).She plays Julie, a young French woman who had survived a car accident that took the lives of her famous composer husband and daughter. She was so tramatized that she isolated herself from the world, and gradually leans toward her musician friend(Benoit Regent) for sexual pleasure as she slowly revive herself. I couldn't forget the scene when she rubbed her hand against the wall and it started to bleed. It was so disturbing and emotionally impacting. Eventually, she found out that her dead husband had been unfaithful to her......I noticed that there was a scene in this movie that was weaved into White. When Julie was looking for someone in the courtroom building, she ""accidently"" walked into the room where White was being shot. I guessed K.K. wanted to somehow connect Blue to White while he was making both films at the same time, even though the stories are not connected.Other than the stunning performance from Binoche, the score, cinematography, and art direction were impeccable! Blue is the most depressing of the trilogy, but it's my favorite, because Binoche moved me to tears.WHITE: ""Zbigniew Zamachowski gets even with Julie Delpy.""White is the least complex and it's a revenge comedy. Julie Delpy divorced her husband(Zbigniew Zamachowski) after a 6 month marriage, because she's not fulfilled sexually as result of his impotence. Z.Z. was broken hearted and leaved France and headed home(Poland) to rebuild his life. Eventually, he returned to France after planning a scheme of vengeance against his ex-wife.....Julie Delpy does a fine job at portraying a bad gir, but her character is underwritten and it's supporting role to the more touching and wonderful Zamachowski. Oh well, if you hate her here, than you'll love her in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. It was good to see White after seeing the heavy-duty Blue.RED: ""The mystery between Irene Jacob and a stranger old man.""Red may be the most critically acclaimed of the trilogy, but I didn't enjoyed it as much as I did for Blue and White. I found it to be a bit intricate and the story didn't really touch me. Though I was mesmerized by the cinematograph, especially when Irene Jaocob does her runway fashion show and the ""bubble gum"" photo shoot. I think she was more memorable in The Double Life of Veronica which was also directed by K.K. Red is about the encounter between Jacob and a retired judge whom has a mystery to share with her.
