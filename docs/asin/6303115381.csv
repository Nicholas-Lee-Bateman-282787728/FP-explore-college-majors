357748,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6303115381,Andrew McCaffrey,"[3, 4]","Fifteen years after that three-hour tour and not much has changed on Gilligan's Island.  Gilligan and the Skipper are still too dumb to realize that if they built another hut, the Skipper wouldn't have to listen to Gilligan's snoring all night.  The Howells are still wealthy and clueless.  The Professor is still building wacky stuff out of coconuts and Mary Ann is still cramming her hinder into those eye-wateringly tight shorts.Of course, there is one change.  The movie star is now played by Judith Baldwin instead of Tina Louise, which means that she now looks completely different to and is over ten years younger than the real Ginger.  Oh well, I was always a Mary Ann man myself.Let's begin at the beginning.  For starters, anyone with ears will notice that the Digiview Productions version of this TV movie ships without the opening and closing theme song.  Not that the credits are missing, they're run accompanied by a dignified silence.  Presumably Digiview didn't have the rights to the distinctive Gilligan's Island music, even though they tend to release films that are public domain.I have read about something like this concerning the status of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 episodes.  Just because a film has fallen into public domain, it doesn't follow that the whole movie is now free for all.  It's possible that after the film company's rights have expired, individual copyrights then revert to the original creators.  So while no one may exclusively own the entire film, pieces of it may now be owned by different individuals or companies (i.e. the rights to music, the ownership of the title, etc).  This is why you will sometimes see films on MST3k with the original title and opening/closing credits lopped off and a new title and material shoved in their places.I have no idea if that's what happened in this case, but I thought it was interesting enough to share.In any event, Gilligan discovers an odd metal disc washed up on the beach.  Using this, the Professor fixes his barometer just in time to discover a major tsunami is headed for the island.  (I know barometers and tsunamis don't work that way.  Don't tell me; tell the Professor.)  Facing certain destruction, the castaways decide to tie all their huts together to form a large boat and let the tidal wave sweep them into the shipping lanes.  For added safety, they each decide to tie themselves to poles inside the boat while the storm is raging.  If anyone reading this has any bizarre bondage fantasy involving any Gilligan's Island character, then this is definitely your DVD.  (Shame on you!)The scheme works, and the former castaways find themselves back among civilization.  They each go their separate ways, although they come to discover that life off the island isn't as rewarding as they thought it would be.  Indeed at one point, the Professor tries to tie their various misadventures in modern life to the Seven Deadly Sins, but I'm fairly certain that they don't.  Of course, I wasn't expecting much from any biblical allusions in RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.I won't give away the exact details of the ending.  But given that there were several follow-on TV movies featuring the words ""Gilligan's Island"" in the title, you shouldn't be totally surprised by the conclusion.Meanwhile while all that other stuff is going on, it turns out that the metal disc Gilligan found had fallen off of a Soviet spy satellite (complete with recycled Star Trek sound effects).  Obviously, this means that two bungling agents must stalk Gilligan to recover their equipment.  This subplot springs from nowhere and at the end, to nowhere it returns.For better or worse, this is exactly like the TV show.  All it lacks is a laugh track.  Of course, it looks as though it had about the same amount of money spent on it as the original.  One assumes the boat scenes were filmed in Sherwood Schwartz's bathtub.The similarity to the TV series is probably why I liked it.  You know exactly what kind of corny, stupid jokes you're going to get.  Gilligan is going to do something stupid.  The Skipper is going to sit on something freshly painted.  The Skipper is going to smack Gilligan with his hat.  I had worried that a show that worked better in small doses would be too ridiculous when stretched to 90 minutes, but surprisingly a quick pace prevents this.There are also some good gags based on everything that the crew missed while on the island.  Skipper laments skipping the era of the mini-skirt.  The castaways are baffled by the identities of President Carter, President Ford and Mr. Watergate.My guess is that this was intended at the time to bring the Gilligan's Island of the past into the present to wring out some nostalgia for times gone by.  There are a lot of cracks at ""modern"" day practices: movies are dirtier than Ginger is expecting, the Professor's university is now more interested in money than academics.  But to the viewer of today, it just looks like the filmmakers dropping 60s icons into clich&eacute;s of the 70s.  To the 21st century viewer, they are not back in ""today"", they are just in a different set of pop culture references.The picture and sound quality on the Digiview Productions release are acceptable, if not actually good.  But I'm guessing that if you're trying to impress your friends and enemies with your giant plasma screen and glorious surround sound speakers, this wouldn't be the movie you'd pop into your system anyway.I doubt there's anyone reading this who doesn't already know if they'd like the movie or not.  So, in summation, all I have to say is: ""It's Gilligan's Island.""  Those three words will determine your enjoyment level.",4,"Gather 'round, little buddies!",1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,5669,"['Fifteen', 'years', 'three-hour', 'tour', 'not', 'much', 'changed',

It is badly edited to begin with and was clearly created from a videotape from a televison broadcast. There are scenes that are played out of order (!), entered late, chopped short, and just plain missing.The sound quality is poor (what you might expect from avhs transfer).The video quality is substandard. The DVD is often grainy, and at least two occasions there was an actual rolling of the screen.The makers of this DVD seem to have missed the whole point of creating a DVD. Where is the digital quality? Or at the very least a decent presentation of the subject matter. This DVD is very unprofessional and looks like something someone might have slapped together on their home computer.So, what are the good points? As stated at the beginning of my review, the movie itself is still wonderful. The price cannot be beat (4.99 for a brand new DVD?). The inclusion of a ""Little Rascals"" short was an unexpected bonus. I would like to see more bonus features like that (old short films or classic cartoons), particularly when there is a lack of deleted scenes or featurettes that directly relate to the movie itself.Now that the Gilligan's Island season sets have started to be released, maybe we can look forward to a studio produced version of this film (and maybe the other reunion movies, Castaways on Gilligan's Island and Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island)I enjoyed seeing this movie again and don't regret having bought the disc despite its shortcomings.

357762,A28B47KE7UJDZH,6303115381,e1x56u$*w#,"[150, 161]","I saw all the bad reviews here, and because of Amazon's confusing policy of posting reviews for ALL the various DVD editions of a particular movie together on the same page, I thought that they must all be referring to the older version that sells for 5 bucks.When I read Amazon's description for the new 2004 edition released by Westlake Entertainment Group, it said ""Format: Original recording remastered, Color, Digital Sound"". So I thought this must be a new version nobody had dared to try out yet due to all the negative reviews, and went ahead and forked out the extra 10 bucks to try it.Well, I'm here to warn you that about the only thing accurate about Amazon's description is that the movie is in colour (faded, yellowed, scratched colour, yes). Although the DVD package claims it has Dolby, the sound is terribly muffled and clearly NOT Dolby quality at all. And NOWHERE on the package does it say anything about being remastered. I don't know where Amazon got this crazy idea, because this company obviously has never even heard of the word ""remastered"". The picture quality is terrible and the film itself is in very lousy shape.As for the movie, although it's a key piece in the Gilligan story, unfortunately the writing really drags. You'll find yourself wanting to hit the fast-forward a lot. And with the exception of Mary Ann and maybe Mrs. Howell, it seems that in the intervening years the others have gotten out of practice and forgotten how to act, as they deliver their lines in a very lame and flat way. I found myself missing the brilliant non-stop comedic punch of the original series, as a lot of the comedy here instead seems very awkward and forced, and just falls on its face. Also there is a new Ginger, and while she does do a pretty good job of looking the part, she hasn't mastered Tina Louise's breathy, sexy way of delivering the lines.So overall I feel like I wasted a lot of good money on a garbage-quality DVD of a very lame movie I probably won't want to watch again. Over the past year I've been stung so many times by el cheap-o outfits putting out shoddy DVDs like this that I am getting so fed up I'm seriously thinking of stopping buying DVDs altogether! I think the industry has got to start setting some standards for quality and policing itself or something. The situation right now is ridiculous! Till then, all we can do is withhold our hard-earned $$$.So anyway, you have been warned, so don't let them rip YOU off this time too!",1,Don't waste your money.

Rescue From Gilligan's Island is a two-part television movie that continues the adventures of the shipwrecked castaways from the 1964-1967 TV series Gilligan's Island starring Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., and Jim Backus. The film first aired on NBC October 14 and October 21, 1978. It was directed by Leslie Martinson. It has fallen in the public domain.SUMMARY: The movie begins when a satellite belonging to the U.S.S.R. experiences technical problems and is almost about to break apart. The scientists on the satellite dispose of a disc containing important information. Seconds later, the satellite blows up. The movie then picks up 15 years after the shipwreck of the S. S. Minnow stranded the crew and passengers on Gilligan's Island. After 15 years, little of their original possessions are left. Even their radio has finally broken down due to age. The metal recording disk from the Soviet satellite is lost and lands in the lagoon. Gilligan finds it and shows it to the professor. Realizing that the unique alloy can be used to make a barometer, the professor quickly realizes that a tidal wave is on the way, which will destroy the island. Quickly the castaways make plans to reinforce one of the huts to take shelter. When the castaways awaken the next morning, they realize that the hut has been swept off the island and is now a makeshift raft. They use clothes and make a sail, and try to make their way to land. In an attempt to make a meal, Gilligan makes a fire, which spreads to the raft. At first, angry with Gilligan for doing another one of his stupid stunts, the castaways are then grateful when the United States Coast Guard spots the smoke and rescues them. After being towed to Hawaii, the castaways are at first confused by modern life. They are informed that the President is now Jimmy Carter, and that they had missed the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. They quickly part however, to try to return to life, as they knew it before the shipwreck. However, they agree to go on a cruise for the holidays. At this time, the Soviets discover that Gilligan is still in possession of the recording disk from their satellite. Determined to recover it, they send two spies to try to get it from Gilligan, by any means necessary. The Skipper and Gilligan are next seen hard at work, refurbishing the S. S. Minnow II. However, the insurance company informs them that they will not be able to get a settlement unless their former passengers sign a statement testifying that the Skipper was not responsible for the shipwreck.QUESTIONS: Who did the skipper find first? Who did the Skipper go to see next? Who was the next person that the Skipper had to find? Who was the final person that the Skipper had to find? Why did the Skipper have to find these people?MY THOUGHTS: I didn't think that this was as good as the regular show. The movie definitely misses the talent of Tina Louise. She played the role of Ginger far better and she was a lot better to look at also. The comedy part of this movie wasn't that funny either. Therefore, with that in mind I give this picture only 6 star because it wasn't as funny as the original show.",3,NOT AS FUNNY AS THE Original SHOW,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,3285,"['TITLE', 'RESCUE', 'FROM', 'GILLIGAN', 'ISLAND', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'October', '14', '1978', 'will', 'take', '95', 'minutes', 'watch', 'movie', 'Rescue', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'two-part', 'television', 'movie', 'adventures', 'shipwrecked', 'castaways', '1964-1967', 'TV', 'series', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'starring', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'film', 'first', 'aired', 'NBC', 'October', '14', 'October', '21', '1978', 'was', 'directed', 'Leslie', 'Martinson', 'fallen', 'public', 'domain.SUMMARY', 'movie', 'when', 'satellite', 'belonging', 'U.S.S.R.', 'technical', 'problems', 'almost', 'break', 'apart', 'scientists', 'satellite', 'dispose', 'disc', 'containing', 'important', 'information', 'Seconds', 'later', 'satellite', 'up', 'movie', 'then', 'up', '15', 'years', 'shipwreck', 'S.', 'S.', 'Minnow', 'stranded', 'crew', 'passengers', 'Gilligan', 'Island', '15', 'years', 'little', 'original', 'possessions', 'are', 'left', 'Even', 'radio', 'finally', 'broken', 'down', 'due', 'age', 'metal', 'recording', 'disk', 'Soviet', 'satellite', 'lost', 'lagoon', 'Gilligan', 'professor', 'Realizing', 'unique', 'alloy', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'make', 'barometer', 'professor', 'quickly', 'tidal', 'wave', 'way', 'will', 'destroy', 'island', 'castaways', 'make', 'plans', 'reinforce', 'one', 'huts', 'take', 'shelter', 'When', 'castaways', 'awaken', 'next', 'morning', 'realize', 'hut', 'been', 'swept', 'off', 'island', 'now', 'makeshift', 'raft', 'use', 'clothes', 'make', 'sail', 'try', 'make', 'way', 'land', 'attempt', 'make', 'meal', 'Gilligan', 'fire', 'raft', 'first', 'angry', 'Gilligan', 'doing', 'one', 'stupid', 'stunts', 'castaways', 'are', 'then', 'grateful', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'spots', 'smoke', 'rescues', 'being', 'towed', 'Hawaii', 'castaways', 'are', 'first', 'confused', 'modern', 'life', 'are', 'informed', 'President', 'now', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'had', 'missed', 'presidencies', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'quickly', 'part', 'however', 'try', 'return', 'life', 'knew', 'shipwreck', 'However', 'agree', 'go', 'cruise', 'holidays', 'time', 'Soviets', 'discover', 'Gilligan', 'still', 'possession', 'recording', 'disk', 'satellite', 'Determined', 'recover', 'send', 'two', 'spies', 'try', 'get', 'Gilligan', 'means', 'necessary', 'Skipper', 'Gilligan', 'are', 'next', 'seen', 'hard', 'work', 'refurbishing', 'S.', 'S.', 'Minnow', 'II', 'However', 'insurance', 'company', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'settlement', 'former', 'passengers', 'sign', 'statement', 'testifying', 'Skipper', 'was', 'not', 'responsible', 'shipwreck.QUESTIONS', 'Who', 'did', 'skipper', 'find', 'first', 'Who', 'did', 'Skipper', 'go', 'see', 'next', 'Who', 'was', 'next', 'person', 'Skipper', 'had', 'find', 'Who', 'was', 'final', 'person', 'Skipper', 'had', 'find', 'Why', 'did', 'Skipper', 'have', 'find', 'people', 'MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'regular', 'show', 'movie', 'definitely', 'talent', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'played', 'role', 'Ginger', 'far', 'better', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'look', 'also', 'comedy', 'part', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Therefore', 'mind', 'give', 'picture', 'only', '6', 'star', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'original', 'show']",Rescue from Gilligan's Island VHS

By the way, I think its neat that the surviving original cast (excluding Louise) seem to be close and enjoy being together.  It showed in this.

The one where the gang plan to play hooky from school to go to the circus, then find out their teacher was planning to take the whole class there anyways, but before they realized it, one member left the hooky note on the desk and closed the door to the school, locking it, and since the night watchman wouldn't let them back in, they had to break into the school that night to get the note.

Spies lose control of their satellite, so they blow it up.  The only part which survives the destruction is the data disk from the ship(the exact thing the spies wanted to destroy), which lands intact in the shallow water of the island's lagoon.Later, a storm hits, and Gilligan goes out into the storm to find Fifi, after Mrs. Howell freaks out that Fifi, her poodle, is not with them and ""safe"".  None of the castaways have noticed that a dog never came on the trip with them, and has not been on the island for the past 15 years.The huts have been lashed together, in an attempt to survive the storm.  After the storm passes, the meshed huts (with no bouyant support underneath) floats neatly on top of the water, except dipping a little when everyone stands on the same side of the conglomerate.Mary Ann, aided by the Skipper and Gilligan, runs away from her wedding, via a tractor pulling a wagon of watermelons.  They are pursued by a posse of men, who are all knocked down (bowled over, if you will) by a single watermelon (""Strike"" ha ha).  Skipper stops the tractor, and they occasionally toss another watermelon toward the group, as the entire posse keeps falling over itself in watermelon guts for about 3 minutes.  The Schwartzes could have learned a thing or two about proper slapstick from Hal Roach.The Professor is a hit with all the young ladies at campus, labeled ""macho"".  A female staff member hits on the professor.  He's not interested.  Professor: ""Miss Ainsworth, turn off your macho!""Gilligan tells the Skipper he's just finished varnishing two chairs for the Minnow II.  So what does Skipper do two minutes later?  Sits in one and gets stuck.  Now here's the funny bit...wait for it...Skipper: ""What could be stupider than varnishing the seat of a chair?""Gilligan: ""Sitting in the seat of a chair that's just been varnished.""With the understanding that the castaways loved and respected each other, why do we have lines like Gilligan saying (regarding a sail), ""Hey Skipper, why don't you donate your pants? When they fill with air, we can fly to Hawaii""?Bad script.  Bad production.

Just to show you how big fan I am, I also have a copy of the sequel to this ""The Castaways on Gilligan's Island"" which was done in 1979, I recorded it to VHS in 1979 and have since transferred it to DVD, ditto with the third and last TV movie ""The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island"" released in 1981. In this last of the TV movies a new character Thurston Howell IV played by David Ruprecht. This was due to the failing health of Jim Backus who only made a Cameo appearance in the final scene, I think he had less than 2 minutes of face time and he really did not look well. Those Harlem Globetrotters really get around, they even made two movies with Scooby-Doo and those meddling kids in 1972 in the Saturday morning cartoon series ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"".

Having grown up watching and loving ""Gilligan's Island"" run in syndication as a kid, this movie was a disappointment to me, but in comparison to the other Gilligan movies (and that awful TBS reality series that was on the air a couple of years ago - ""The REAL Gilligan's Island"" - ugh) that followed, it looks like ""Citizen Kane"".Our favorite seven castaways, who have been shipwrecked for 15 years, are finally rescued. They go their separate ways and resume with their individual lives. However, much has changed in the world since 1964 and they all find it difficult to adjust to life in pre-Reagan era America. They found life on the island that they called home for so many years was much more simple. The seven of them genuinely cared about one another, but see little of this attitude in the people in their reclaimed lives. One by one, they realize that getting rescued probably turned out to be more of a curse than a blessing. This is a true example of being careful for what you wish for because you might get it - what you may get is not everything you imagined it would be. I have to say that the same applies to all of us who grew up watching the reruns of this show - we wondered what became of the passengers of the S.S. Minnow after it went off the air.It's a good story idea that might have worked if it were done the right way, but the script was just plain insipid and didn't really take advantage of the possibilities that were there. Yeah, I know the original ""Gilligan"" episodes didn't make much, if any sense, but you  knew that they were supposed to be silly and you enjoyed it for that. All the fun and the great one-liners that you loved in the series just isn't present in this movie. No funny punchlines, no enjoyable slapstick - nothing. I felt bad for the actors, who had to lumber through this disaster of a screenplay and I have to even wonder if any of them really wanted to do it in the first place. Maybe their friendship with series creator/producer Sherwood Schwartz was a factor in their decision. The writers made Gilligan even more naive and stupid than he was in the original series and having Russian spies lurking after him after the rescue, this just didn't work for me. This movie is where the Gilligan saga should have ended, but it didn't.Like most have said here, the DVD quality is horrible. No digital remastering, no Dolby sound, poor editing of the original movie...no need to go on as how bad it is.I would only recommend this if you are a die-hard GI fan and if you fit that description, then get it - but on VHS if you can find it. If anything, you should view it as a way to close out this series that never got a farewell episode. It was cancelled before the show could start its fourth season, which was sad because it had already been promised by CBS that the show could last long enough to at least get the castaways rescued. A far better purchase (and a more interesting one, I might add) is the DVD ""Surviving Gilligan's Island - The Incredibly True Story Of The Longest Three-Hour Tour In History"" (2001) - an excellent film/documentary about the inner workings and behind-the-scenes conflicts about the show and the actors. The roles in the movie are played by other actors, but features input from the late Bob Denver, Dawn Wells, Russell Johnson and series creator Sherwood Schwartz, who all collaborated to make this project happen.

357813,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6303115381,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","""Rescue from Gilligan's Island"" came out 11 and a half years after the series ended. The movie was a huge hit on TV simply due to the show's gazillion of fans, multiplied by a decade of syndicated reruns. Unfortunately, the film doesn't measure up to the zany-but-excellent series, particularly the last two seasons.For one, at 95 minutes it seems to have a lot of filler. Many of the scenes could've been cut down by about 40%. It also seems rushed at times, like the actors learned their lines an hour before filming; and a lot of the humorous situations/dialogue aren't entirely successful, to put it nicely. Also, Tina Louise refused to return as Ginger, evidently because they didn't offer her enough money (which is funny because she wasn't exactly an in-demand actress at the time; the only significant role I remember her in after Gilligan's Island was in the 1975 film ""The Stepford Wives""). The woman they got to replace Tina looks fine but she comes off as an airheaded bimbo and Ginger was never a bimbo. She's a sexy starlet, yes, but also smart.Most of the cast look pretty good a dozen years later and Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) looks incredible. Surprisingly, it's Gilligan (Bob Denver) who has aged the most, which is strange since he was supposed to be a ""boy"" of about 19-21 during the original run. As such, he should only be about 30-32 during this movie, but he clearly looks to be in his mid-40s or older (in real life Bob Denver was 29-31 during the series and was 43 at the time of this movie). Still, this isn't a big deal.There are a lot of cheap DVD versions floating around out there and that's the version I saw, which is fine by me. It' ain't ""Apocalypse Now,"" after all. If crystal-clear quality matters to you then pick up the higher-priced remastered DVD, which I assume is better quality.BOTTOM LINE: ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island"" comes across as a lame version of the series with too much filler, but it's worthwhile for fans of the show because, of course, we have to know how they finally got rescued after almost 15 years as castaways. But, as they say, you can never go home again and neither can the castaways; they became their own family on the island, which is one of the reasons the show was so endearing.GRADE: C",3,Weak sequel movie to the Gilligan's Island series,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,2255,"['Rescue', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'came', '11', 'half', 'years', 'series', 'ended', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'TV', 'simply', 'due', 'show', 'gazillion', 'fans', 'multiplied', 'decade', 'syndicated', 'reruns', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'zany-but-excellent', 'series', 'particularly', 'last', 'two', 'seasons.For', 'one', '95', 'minutes', 'have', 'lot', 'filler', 'Many', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'about', '40', '%', 'also', 'rushed', 'times', 'actors', 'learned', 'lines', 'hour', 'filming', 'lot', 'humorous', 'situations/dialogue', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'successful', 'put', 'nicely', 'Also', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'refused', 'return', 'Ginger', 'evidently', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'enough', 'money', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'in-demand', 'actress', 'time', 'only', 'significant', 'role', 'remember', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'was', '1975', 'film', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'woman', 'got', 'replace', 'Tina', 'fine', 'off', 'airheaded', 'bimbo', 'Ginger', 'was', 'never', 'bimbo', 'sexy', 'starlet', 'yes', 'also', 'smart.Most', 'cast', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'dozen', 'years', 'later', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'incredible', 'Surprisingly', 'Gilligan', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'who', 'aged', 'most', 'strange', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'boy', '19-21', 'original', 'run', 'such', 'should', 'only', 'be', '30-32', 'movie', 'clearly', 'be', 'mid-40s', 'older', 'real', 'life', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'was', '29-31', 'series', 'was', '43', 'time', 'movie', 'Still', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal.There', 'are', 'lot', 'cheap', 'DVD', 'versions', 'floating', 'around', 'there', 'version', 'saw', 'fine', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'crystal-clear', 'quality', 'matters', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'higher-priced', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'assume', 'better', 'quality.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Rescue', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'across', 'lame', 'version', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'filler', 'worthwhile', 'fans', 'show', 'course', 'have', 'know', 'how', 'finally', 'got', 'rescued', 'almost', '15', 'years', 'castaways', 'say', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'can', 'castaways', 'became', 'own', 'family', 'island', 'one', 'reasons', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'endearing.GRADE', 'C']",Rescue from Gilligan's Island VHS
