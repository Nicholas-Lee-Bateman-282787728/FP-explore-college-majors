One of the best aspects about Mary is that she is attracted to the integrity of men and not just their appearance. Ted (Ben Stiller) is an awkward teenager with braces who wins the heart of Mary (Carmen Diaz) when he shows the character and courage to defend her handicapped brother.  He then garners a chance to take her to the prom, but a terrible accident cuts off their relationship, and leaves Ted yearning for her even after she moves to Miami.  Through a friend, he hires a private investigator, Pat, (Matt Dillon) to find her.  A slimeball from the start, he chases Mary himself and attempts to leave Ted in the dust.""There's Something About Mary"" is meant to be in bad taste, but for humor, sometimes it hits and sometimes it misses.  Fortunately, it bats at about .750 and manages some grand slams.  Mary is truly captivating enough to enable decency, but the treatment of the handicapped is a mixed bag.  Special people are a touchtone to the characters, but there are a few cheap jokes involving the handicapped as well.  Ben Stiller manages again to play Mr. Ordinary who is thrown into the worst of circumances, like in ""Meet the Parents,"" and remain a nimble and nuerotic presence.  It is a fun movie for all its hijinx and even (sometimes especially) the cheese...(including, notably a guest appearance by Chief Cheese, Brett Farve...)",3,Cheesey Hijinx,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1474,"['Something', 'Mary', 'many', 'cheesey', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'more', 'heart', 'more', 'big', 'laughs', 'One', 'best', 'aspects', 'Mary', 'attracted', 'integrity', 'men', 'not', 'just', 'appearance', 'Ted', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'braces', 'who', 'heart', 'Mary', 'Carmen', 'Diaz', 'when', 'character', 'courage', 'defend', 'handicapped', 'brother', 'then', 'chance', 'take', 'prom', 'terrible', 'accident', 'cuts', 'off', 'relationship', 'Ted', 'yearning', 'even', 'Miami', 'friend', 'private', 'investigator', 'Pat', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'find', 'slimeball', 'start', 'Mary', 'attempts', 'leave', 'Ted', 'dust', 'Something', 'Mary', 'meant', 'be', 'bad', 'taste', 'humor', 'Fortunately', '.750', 'grand', 'slams', 'Mary', 'truly', 'captivating', 'enough', 'enable', 'decency', 'treatment', 'handicapped', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Special', 'people', 'are', 'touchtone', 'characters', 'are', 'few', 'cheap', 'jokes', 'involving', 'handicapped', 'well', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'again', 'play', 'Mr', 'Ordinary', 'who', 'thrown', 'worst', 'circumances', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'remain', 'nimble', 'nuerotic', 'presence', 'fun', 'movie', 'hijinx', 'even', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'cheese', 'including', 'notably', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Chief', 'Cheese', 'Brett', 'Farve']",N/A

It is not only sexy and funny, but it also shows us complex emotions.  There aren't that many comedies that you can pick up something new each time you watch it.Cameron Diaz, though it was not her first movie, makes her REAL debut in this film.  It is a great one.  For a comedy, the plot is somewhat complex, but not so much that it is distracting.  I also enjoyed all the rediculous complaints from the politically correct viewers who complained that the movie promotes animal cruelty and belittles the mentally retarded.

Soon after their first venture into film they were labeled as what can only be described as the eminent caretakers of teen comedy. To their  credit they compounded this accusation by returning, in later films, to the  material that garnered that reputation in the first place. Steeped in gross  out gags, replete with fart jokes, the Farrelly brothers are perceived by  those that vote with their pen rather then their dollar as the kings of low  brow drudgery.For those of you that have not seen There's Something  About Mary, which if you allow me a tinge of prognostication is probably  fairly close to none of you, I implore you to seek and see this movie. If I  were a person contained within your limited sphere of knowing I would  constantly badger you. In the realm of motion pictures TSAM begs to be  laughed with.Technology, the infinite wonder that it is, has provided  english speaking humanity a wonderful oppurtunity to not only watch the  movie in its original theatrical aspect ratio. But to lay over the standard  picture an audio track that only the Farrelly brothers occupy. Sadly and  solemnly I cannot give my recommendation to this anticapated track.  Brothers Farrelly continually remark about the aboundance of friends and  family members included in the cast. Admirable yes, but to be  indiscriminate regarding who you know that gets into the movie and then  relate this extra-ordinary ability to the viewer surely could not have been  solicited by the producer or an anxious viewer. Rather, the public would  have appreciated comments toward the nuances and idiosyncracies of the  film.In closing I regard this wondefully charming film in high esteem  and for that it receives five out of five stars.

This is most likely their finest film, although I am not the biggest fan of their work so that isn't saying a whole lot.  But, maybe it is.  The fact remains that, while I am not a gigantic fan of their work in general, I am a pretty big fan of this film.  It's fun, funny and entertaining.And believe me, there IS something about Cameron Diaz.The film follows lovesick Ted as he attempts to track down Mary, the girl of his dreams.  He knew her in high school and actually had a shot with her until a horrible accident caused a riff of embarrassment that followed Ted into his adult life.  Ted hires a loser named Healy to track her down.  Healy, a complete jerk, becomes smitten with Mary (because she's hot) and so he feeds Ted a slew of lies to get him off her trail and then goes in for the kill himself.  Mary is successful and wealthy and looking for the right guy.  Ted decides to pursue her regardless of the fact that, according to Healy, she is a wheelchair bound fatty with a slew of children and no money.Ah, love is in the air.`There's Something About Mary' doesn't nail every gag.  The Farrelly brothers have their own style and it doesn't always work to their advantage.  That said, when they do nail it, they nail it hard.  In fact, every scene with that hilarious mutt named Puffy is just brilliant, and far funnier than the obsessed about hair-gel scene.  The fight scene with Puffy had me in tears it was so funny, and the resuscitation scene still gets me in full barrel laughs.The vulgarity here can be harsh, but it's also used in such a breezy nature that it becomes a part of the film, something light and airy and fun.Ben Stiller is really good at what he does (far better than Adam Sandler) and he always nails these types of roles.  Matt Dillon is hilarious here, hilariously EVIL!  Lin Shaye is ridiculous.  I mean, she's funny to look at really.  Her leathery skin and disturbing love of her dog is just one of the many reasons to point and laugh when she is on the screen.  But, as the title of the film suggests, this is all about Mary, and as Mary, Cameron Diaz is marvelous.  She is certainly the funniest thing about the film, and her natural, carefree, ditzy-yet-SMARTER-THAN-YOU take on the character is classic!  She nails every scene with a needed conviction, and her dramatic scenes are all tainted with enough humor to make her character completely believable and wholly adorable.The New York Film Critics Circle was right that year!It's not perfect, but it's a laugh riot and one that I can truly recommend.

For those near age 30 or over, viewing this very popular comedy is marred by several things, not least of which is the use of such tired film cliches as the old ""misunderstanding in the interview room at the police station"" bit.  You know, the cops think the guy's done something heinous and the guy thinks the conversation is about a misdemeanor.  Har har.  That was boring and un-funny when JFK was in the White House.Still, the film does have some hilarious scenes, especially with the dog.  The energy and spunk of such moments had me rolling in the floor.  Also the pizza guy is memorable for his remarkable level of physical control in some uncomfortable scenes where I was never sure if I should laugh or feel sorry for the guy; in retrospect, I'm just amazed at how limber the dude is.The only reason I gave this three stars rather than two, however, is the presence of the luminescent Cameron Diaz.  This film would have been a flop without her.  She perfectly fulfills the role of the charming, gorgeous, sweet, transparent Mary.  If one could not understand why the male cast members would devote themselves to her pursuit, the film would fall to pieces.The only reason I gave this three stars rather than FOUR, however, is the incredible stupidity it often shows.  Mary does WHAT for a living?  Nothing about her character ever leads us to think it's possible, other than a screenwriter using the vaguest outline of it by using her job title a couple of times.  Even when she's at work she seems out of place.  This is not sexism, but her personality, lifestyle, attitude, and mostly time away from the office, are such that one may as well believe she were a congresswoman.And how about the odd device of separating the scenes with an on-screen musical interlude?  Pandering to the lowest level of audience intelligence, the idea is to tell about 20 to 25 minutes of story (just about the length of the TV sitcom, see, because they don't think you have enough focus to pay attention any longer than that and have to do a kind of ""commercial break"").Worst, however, is the nonstop stream of ""F-bombs"" dropped without any rhyme or reason.  I'm strongly opposed to mindless crude language, and while there have certainly been examples of films that use such language well within the prose-like patter of tough-guy films like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" here we just have a bunch of [people] who can't think of anything more clever to say.  It's clear that the filmmakers did it just to ensure an R rating, so the young audience would think it was hipper than a PG13 film.As I say, there is intermittent hilarity that make it worth watching once.  I won't be wasting my time with a second viewing, however.",3,There's something about Cameron Diaz,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2831,"['everyone', 'born', 'late', '1970s', 'thereafter', 'may', 'now', 'ignore', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'near', 'age', '30', 'over', 'viewing', 'very', 'popular', 'comedy', 'marred', 'several', 'things', 'not', 'least', 'use', 'such', 'tired', 'film', 'cliches', 'old', 'misunderstanding', 'interview', 'room', 'police', 'station', 'bit', 'know', 'cops', 'think', 'guy', 'done', 'something', 'heinous', 'guy', 'conversation', 'misdemeanor', 'Har', 'har', 'was', 'boring', 'un-funny', 'when', 'JFK', 'was', 'White', 'House.Still', 'film', 'have', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'especially', 'dog', 'energy', 'spunk', 'such', 'moments', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'Also', 'pizza', 'guy', 'memorable', 'remarkable', 'level', 'physical', 'control', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'never', 'sure', 'should', 'laugh', 'feel', 'sorry', 'guy', 'retrospect', ""'m"", 'just', 'amazed', 'how', 'limber', 'dude', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'two', 'however', 'presence', 'luminescent', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'flop', 'perfectly', 'role', 'charming', 'gorgeous', 'sweet', 'transparent', 'Mary', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'male', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'devote', 'pursuit', 'film', 'would', 'fall', 'pieces.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'FOUR', 'however', 'incredible', 'stupidity', 'often', 'Mary', 'WHAT', 'living', 'Nothing', 'character', 'ever', 'think', 'possible', 'other', 'screenwriter', 'using', 'vaguest', 'outline', 'using', 'job', 'title', 'couple', 'times', 'Even', 'when', 'work', 'place', 'not', 'sexism', 'personality', 'lifestyle', 'attitude', 'mostly', 'time', 'away', 'office', 'are', 'such', 'one', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'believe', 'were', 'congresswoman.And', 'how', 'odd', 'device', 'separating', 'scenes', 'on-screen', 'musical', 'interlude', 'Pandering', 'lowest', 'level', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'idea', 'tell', 'about', '20', '25', 'minutes', 'story', 'just', 'length', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'enough', 'focus', 'pay', 'attention', 'longer', 'have', 'do', 'kind', 'commercial', 'break', '.Worst', 'however', 'nonstop', 'stream', 'F-bombs', 'dropped', 'rhyme', 'reason', ""'m"", 'strongly', 'opposed', 'mindless', 'crude', 'language', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'examples', 'films', 'use', 'such', 'language', 'well', 'prose-like', 'patter', 'tough-guy', 'films', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'here', 'just', 'have', 'bunch', '[', 'people', ']', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'clever', 'say', 'clear', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'just', 'ensure', 'R', 'rating', 'young', 'audience', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'hipper', 'PG13', 'film.As', 'say', 'intermittent', 'hilarity', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'second', 'viewing', 'however']",N/A

After watching it for a second time after many months, it's not as bad as I remembered it being, but I still can't give it more than three stars.  The idea of the film is good (yet far from unique), and I am all for seeing dorky guys like myself stand a chance with the girl of their dreams, but the relentless crudity throughout the film takes away from my enjoyment.  I'm certainly not opposed to low-grade humor, but there are some images here that I could easily visualize myself without having to needlessly see them on screen.  I was also bothered by Mary's language--it just did not seem right for such a ""sweet"" young lady to say R-rated words.  That just does not fit with my own image of the character.  Admittedly, these are just personal reactions that others may not share.  I did find several parts of the movie quite funny, especially the initial prom night activities, but the level of humor seemed to steadily diminish throughout the film.  At the same time, my opinion of Ted (Ben Stiller) also declined significantly, and as a result I did not really care enough about the characters to have much of an emotional stake in the end.  I would have to say that this is a comedy and little else and consequently does not have much heart to it.  The love story aspect was destroyed for me by the excessive gross-out scenes and a somewhat farcical ending.  I don't know if it was bad acting or bad scripting, but none of the men supposedly madly in love with Mary seemed to portray any such feelings in their actions or dialogue.  I have never been a huge Cameron Diaz fan, but she does do a wonderful job here.

At this film's heart it's just a sweet love story, leavened with scenes of low humor.  The Farrellys navigate successfully the fine line between being laugh-out-loud funny and just plain gross superbly.  They are abetted by a superb cast.  Ben Stiller's nebbishy character get's tiresome in alot of his films but he is somewhat endearing here.  Cameron Diaz is effervescent here as the object of everybody's affection.  Matt Dillon has never been better as the sleazy private detective(where's he been lately?).  This film may have been a case of the Farrellys being too successful because their subsequent efforts have fallen short of the mark(though I'm one of the few champions of ""Me, Myself, and Irene"".  It's not as bad as some would say).  On a final note if anybody's interested in who the minstrel is who provides running commentary throughout the film his name is Jonathan Richman.  Richman and his band the Modern Lovers made a classic self-titled rock album in 1972.  Richman was something of an eccentric.

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is not only totally hilarious, witty and all out funny but it's so wrong, it's funny!Ben Stiller is Ted and after pining over the girl he fell in love with over 10 years ago, Mary (Cameron Diaz), he finally decides that enough is enough and that he should find her just so he can see how she's doing. Needing some help, he hires Pat (Matt Dillon), a collector and a guy who's pretty good about finding people. Pat comes through for Ted but then he realizes that he has another agenda with Ted's girl. Now it's a total brawl for all just for Mary's affection.This is still one of my favorite movies of all time and probably my favorite from the Farrelly Brothers. Chris Elliot, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are hilarious in this one. The sexual humor in this is a bit on the cheap side but it is funny as hell (ex: Ted in the bathroom at Mary's house before the prom). And of course who could forget the hair gel scene?This is a big thumbs up! Out the Farrelly Brothers movies, in my opinion, this one tops the list. Plus there are some pretty cool features on the DVD as well like outtakes, the end credits music video (in both regular music video style and in karaoke) and also some behind the scenes stuff as well.

The story is that of a shy nerdy boy called Ted who gets to go to the prom with beautiful Mary. But when he gets something private stuck in a zipper, he never sees her again. When he's grown up, he tries to see her again so he hires Pat Heeley, a private incestigator to find her. But, when he finds her, he falls for her and lies to Ted about her, telling her she's absoluely huge (fat) and hideous. Eventually, it's Ted, Pat and many others fighting for her love. This movie has some of the funniest scenes ever, from the zipper problem, to Ted fighting a drugged up Terrier, to the classic hair gel scene.

I was going to write that the special features however are one star due to the fact there are hardly any but the US version available here seems to have more features.  The Australian version hardly has any.I'm assuming the few listed are the same.  The music video is very disappointing as it's exactly the same as the end credits except it's full screen.  I was expecting a full song about Mary from those guys with the guitar and drums who appear at different intervals throughout the movie.  But no it's just the buttercup credit's song.  The Karaoke feature is incidentally the exact same thing again just with words across the screen this time.  They could have just had the subtitles feature available in the music video for the same effect.  Usually Karaoke just has the instrumental music and not the words being sung.  There is a theatrical trailer, director commentary and interactive menu but that's pretty much standard on any DVD so there?s nothing special there. The reason this annoys me is there?s a big icon on the cover that says ""Warning Crammed With Lots of Outrageous Special Features?""

It truly is laugh-a-minute stuff for anyone with even a vague sense of humor, while the gags run the gamut from ridiculous to sublime, the plot twists ands turns, and the characters are actually well-developed and distinctive, more so than you'd expect for what is essentially, a romantic comedy.  In my opinion too much attention has been paid to various scenes in the movie (I'm talking about clearing the pipes here...) and that shouldn't overshadow the many other hilarious bits.  I think it definitely is a movie you need to watch repeatedly to pick up on all the running jokes and more subtle humor.It also helps that Cameron Diaz is pretty much every man's dream - beautiful, low maintenance and willing to date nerds.

She actually goes to prom with Ted(Stiller) who has the geeky hair and braces. Only problem is prom never happens after Stiller has a problem in the bathroom when he accidently hits the ""frank"" when zipping up his fly. Many years later still consumed with Mary-- Ted decides to her down hiring a dective who also falls for Mary. The dective makes up a story about Mary to Ted about her being 200 pounds and in a wheel-chair to turn Ted off while he moves to go be close to Mary. Mary hasn't changed at all and when Ted learns about where Mary is he decides to see her. Things haven't changed and their still is a connection with her. Then, the world comes crashing in when Ted learns that is not the only one who sees there is something about Mary-- her admirers include someone obssesed with shoes, a pro-football player, a class a- jerk, a pizza guy, and Ted who never got over Mary.

Z-A-Z films are famous for their repeated gags, some of them owing their  existence to earlier films (such as the brilliant &quot;screwdriver&quot;  scene in Airplane 2: The Sequel when Ted still has his &quot;drinking  problem&quot;).Standing on its own, the movie does have funny points  (some riotously funny) but they tie together badly. The screenplay seems to  have been written in order to jump from one joke to the next, but with no  thought given to fleshing out each joke to give it depth and character like  a running gag can develop. Many jokes are just funny because of their shock  value, an attribute which wears off quickly in any film. Great comedies  carry jokes on multiple levels, some of them mere statements of irony  spanning large parts of the film, yet Mary doesn't have that.Yeah, the  movie was funny, but it just wasn't as funny as it was hyped up to be.

Even Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels, Vanilla Sky, Shrek) has a few shinning moments. The story is about a kid who grows up with a crush on the most popular girl and then keeps that crush into adult hood. Through the suggestion of a friend played by Chris Elliot (The Abyss, Cabin Boy, Groundhog Day) he makes the suggestion of hiring a detective to find her years later. This detective is hysterically played by Matt Dillion (In and Out, To Die For, A Kiss Before Dying) and boy does he make you laugh.The funniest scene stealer is that of a terrior dog who first get put on qualudes to be slowed up and then on speed to be more aggressive. Both scenes are hysterical and they are obvious ""dummy"" dogs, but Matt Dillion really plays the comedy to the hilt.The DVD extra's include a funny and insightful commentary by the directors, a music video, a karaoke video and the outtakes from the film.

It is about a lonely writer, Ted(Ben Stiller), who has been thinking about his high-school crush, Mary(Cameron Diaz), for 13 years (the last time he saw her).  He longs to see her again so much that he hires a private investigator, Pat Healy(Matt Dillon), to track her down and spy on her a little bit.  Unfortunately, while Healy is spying on her, he falls in love with her.Healy then starts dating Mary and when Ted asks about Mary, Healy makes up lies and says things like, &quot;She's a mail order bride and she has 4 kids&quot;.  With all this bad information about Mary, Ted still wants to see Mary, so he goes down to Miami and meets up with her.Soon, Ted and Mary are good friends again.  However, Mary is so beautiful and charming, a lot of other people are willing to screw up Ted and Mary's relationship so they can date her. I am not going to spoil any more of the film.

467130,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305499071,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","There's more than one thing about There's Something About Mary. To start with, we are dealing with the brothers Farrelly. America currently has several sibling teams making movies. The Zucker brothers [Airplane, The Naked Gun] and the Coen brothers [Fargo, The Big Lebowski] are acknowledged as gifted film makers.Bobby and Peter Farrelly, however, make many reviewers quake in fear. Their aptly named Dumb and Dumber, starring Jim Carrey, was 1994's sixth most successful movie worldwide. The simple fact is that when a team can do that, a studio lets them make whatever they want for a while. Since this latest effort was the 4th biggest movie of 1998, there is even less chance of controlling their projects. They are what we call critic-proof.Some reviewers, knowing they were powerless, made venomous assaults on Mary, based usually on the fact that the movie revels in its political incorrectness. There's no doubt about that, but others, myself included, saw it as one of life's guilty pleasures. After all, in a society currently so obsessed with toeing the line, with not offending even the smallest minority group, it can be fun to see a flick that threw all caution to the wind. A large segment of the population agreed.So what groups do the Farrellys target this time around? They go after high schools kids, parents, gay men, straight men, sun worshippers, dogs, law enforcement officers, private detectives, the physically challenged, and the mentally challenged, among others. There is no agenda here. Their observations on the human condition seem to have no boundaries, and they simple did not have time to nail the entire planet.To add insult to injury, this comedy is of the gross-out variety. As most of us write for general audiences, we were forced to be less than specific about much of the picture. All I should say in print is that the more memorable moments are the zipper scene, the hair gel scene, the biting dog episode, the binoculars incident, the run in at the rest stop, and a look at what real guys do just before a hot date.So what is this thing about Mary? Part of it is that she is played by the fantastic Cameron Diaz, who I said would be a star after seeing her in My Best Friend's Wedding. I got that one right. The rest is the fact that Mary remains kind, helpful and innocent no matter what happens. While the rest of the characters fight, claw, scream and whine through life, Mary sails gracefully on.Diaz has excellent support from Ben Stiller as Ted, who has never gotten over his high school crush on her, and from Matt Dillon as Pat, the sleazy private detective Ted hires to find her. It's no surprise when Pat decides to keep Mary for himself. That's the entire plot, by the way.Throughout the movie, a vagabond keeps reappearing, singing an inane song about Mary and Ted. He eventually gets his, probably for singing off key. This element is a dead giveaway that the movie is a farce and a put on. For anyone trying to comment seriously on it, the joke seems to be on them.",4,One of my favorite guity pleasures,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,3023,"['more', 'one', 'thing', 'Something', 'Mary', 'start', 'are', 'dealing', 'brothers', 'Farrelly', 'America', 'currently', 'several', 'sibling', 'teams', 'making', 'movies', 'Zucker', 'brothers', '[', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', ']', 'Coen', 'brothers', '[', 'Fargo', 'Big', 'Lebowski', ']', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'gifted', 'film', 'makers.Bobby', 'Peter', 'Farrelly', 'however', 'make', 'many', 'reviewers', 'quake', 'fear', 'aptly', 'named', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'starring', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', '1994', 'sixth', 'most', 'successful', 'movie', 'worldwide', 'simple', 'fact', 'when', 'team', 'can', 'do', 'studio', 'make', 'want', 'while', 'latest', 'effort', 'was', '4th', 'biggest', 'movie', '1998', 'even', 'less', 'chance', 'controlling', 'projects', 'are', 'what', 'call', 'critic-proof.Some', 'reviewers', 'knowing', 'were', 'powerless', 'made', 'venomous', 'assaults', 'Mary', 'based', 'usually', 'fact', 'movie', 'revels', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'doubt', 'others', 'included', 'saw', 'one', 'life', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'society', 'currently', 'so', 'obsessed', 'toeing', 'line', 'not', 'offending', 'even', 'smallest', 'minority', 'group', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'flick', 'threw', 'caution', 'wind', 'large', 'segment', 'population', 'what', 'groups', 'do', 'Farrellys', 'target', 'time', 'around', 'go', 'high', 'schools', 'kids', 'parents', 'gay', 'men', 'straight', 'men', 'sun', 'worshippers', 'dogs', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'private', 'detectives', 'physically', 'challenged', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'others', 'agenda', 'here', 'observations', 'human', 'condition', 'seem', 'have', 'boundaries', 'simple', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'nail', 'entire', 'planet.To', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'comedy', 'gross-out', 'variety', 'most', 'write', 'general', 'audiences', 'were', 'forced', 'be', 'less', 'specific', 'much', 'picture', 'should', 'say', 'print', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'are', 'zipper', 'scene', 'hair', 'gel', 'scene', 'biting', 'dog', 'episode', 'binoculars', 'incident', 'run', 'rest', 'stop', 'look', 'what', 'real', 'guys', 'do', 'just', 'hot', 'date.So', 'what', 'thing', 'Mary', 'Part', 'played', 'fantastic', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'star', 'seeing', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'rest', 'fact', 'Mary', 'kind', 'helpful', 'innocent', 'matter', 'what', 'rest', 'characters', 'fight', 'claw', 'scream', 'whine', 'life', 'Mary', 'gracefully', 'excellent', 'support', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Ted', 'who', 'never', 'gotten', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Pat', 'sleazy', 'private', 'detective', 'Ted', 'find', 'surprise', 'when', 'Pat', 'keep', 'Mary', 'entire', 'plot', 'way.Throughout', 'movie', 'vagabond', 'reappearing', 'singing', 'inane', 'song', 'Mary', 'Ted', 'eventually', 'probably', 'singing', 'off', 'key', 'element', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'movie', 'farce', 'put', 'anyone', 'trying', 'comment', 'seriously', 'joke', 'be']",N/A

""There's Something About Mary"" is the story of Ted (Ben Stiller), a lonely guy who has been in love with his high school prom date, Mary (Cameron Diaz), ever since they shared the most horrifying pre-date experience possible. Thirteen years later, Ted still can't get Mary out of his mind. He hires Patrick (Matt Dillon), a sleazy private investigator, to track Mary down. Unfortunately, when Patrick gets a good look at Mary, he decides that he wants her all to himself. Patrick concocts a wild scheme to keep Ted and Mary apart, but Ted eventually figures out what's going on and embarks on a hellish journey down to Florida to set things straight. It turns out that many more men have become smitten with Mary, and it's anyone's guess what will happen in the end.This movie is incredibly funny.

It endures as one of my favourite movies, and I hate romantic comedies as a rule! However, this is not your usual romantic comedy by any stretch of the imagination.The story basically carries you along the life of angst ridden, therapy dependent and introverted Ted, (Stiller), as he tries to track down the one high school love he had. That would be Mary, (Diaz). In the process, he sends out a private detective with a host of his own problems, (Dillon), who also falls for this Mary. That is also in addition to the host of others who have fallen for this girl. Throw in a serial killer, a gay bust at a roadside rest stop, Puffy the dog and some healthy doses of speed, and great comedy is what you have.Stiller is great as the pathetic and somewhat anal-retentive Ted. The role seems excellently suited to Stiller's style of acting and character. He really shines in this movie, and it is largely his work here that has got me to be a large fan of his. Diaz comes across well as the sports loving, butch, but-so-sexy-at-the-same-time perfect woman, Mary. Both of them lack some of the chemistry of other on-screen love interests, but that lack is hardly noticeable in the chaos of the comedy.Be warned that there is a lot of sexuality used in the jokes, and that some of it is pretty sick. However, overall, the comedy is truly great, even if it has a sick moment or two.I laughed myself almost to oxygen starved loss of consciousness. I have seen the movie perhaps more than 10 times, and I am not yet bored of it.

The new scenes blend in flawlessly, kinda like they were always there.

467141,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6305499071,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[2, 4]","There's Something About Mary is probably the most famous gross-out comedy of them all, and certainly influenced the rest that came along in its wake, namely the American Pie movies.  At the end of the day you either like this kind of movie or you don't, and usually I don't but even for me this was good fun.  The story has three guys (Stiller, Dillon and Evans) in love with one girl, Mary (Diaz) and will do anything to get her.The Farelly brothers have always revelled in being completely politically incorrect and crossing the boundaries of taste as often as they want to, something that is all too evident in There's Something About Mary.  However, it's definitely important that whilst these jokes might not be tasteful they are for the most part funny.  Whether they're laugh-out-loud funny or just raise a little smily depends on how much you go in for this kind of comedy or not.  Personally, I loved the scene where Matt Dillon tries to resuscitate Mary's dog with mouth-to-mouth and then with cords from a nearby lamp.  Of course the most famous scenes will probably be what most people look out for - Mary's mistake over the hair gel and Stiller's infamous zipper sequence - and they won't disappoint.The only thing that provides the difficult point in this movie though is the ending.  It's sweet.  Now this will either appeal to you greatly, proving that the Farrelly brothers aren't afraid of sensitivity, or it will annoy you because it seems incongruous to the rest of the movie.  I'd probably go for the former, despite it being fairly predictable.  The acting is very good though, especially Diaz, who proves herself to be a real sport and again makes a statement that this is an actress of amazing versatility (just see Being John Malkovich) who can be light and funny or serious in equal parts.There's Something About Mary might not be as quirky as it wants to be, but it was still very influential in its field and is way ahead of any other Farrelly brothers production to date.

Even then, you'll get a chuckle out of those parts, but you won't be gasping for air the way the first audience did.  Even with all the crude slapstick humour, the greatest surprise is the amount of wit mixed in with the humour.  Unlike other summer movies like Baseketball and American Pie, movies that are only funny for the shock value, there are jokes that remain funny after repeated viewings.  And while the movie would have survived with half-hearted acting, there are plenty of great performances, from Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon especially.

467148,A2VGNBDNCKQLTM,6305499071,Nathan Southern,"[5, 10]","Upon release in Summer, 1998, &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; became the surprise comedy hit of the year, due to its string of consistently shocking gross-out gags. Because the film nearly overdoses on  scatology and innuendo, I didn't find much of the material funny (aside  from a gag involving Ben Stiller's roadside restroom stop). Nevertheless,  the rest of the audience laughed so hard, through the entire film, that it  often became difficult to hear the dialogue... and the picture did  incredible box office... so it's probably a matter of taste. My biggest  complaint about &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; is that it fails  on the most rudimentary level: as an attempt to blend lighthearted,  touching romantic comedy with Kentucky Fried Movie--style raunch. Other  movies pull off this difficult feat successfully--particularly Mel Smith's  &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; and Paul Bartel's &quot;Eating Raoul&quot; &lt;two  of the funniest films of the last twenty years&gt;, and the Farrellys  should be lauded for trying to achieve that melange. But like oil and  water, the two comedic modes never quite gel, and sit beside each other  awkwardly.The other Amazon reviewers are right: chances are, you'll  either love this film or hate it. But regardless of your reaction, try  *not* to see it alone!

The story takes as Ted is in love with Mary in high school. But the incident happened which then she moves to Florida without saying goodbye to Ted. He is still in love with her after 13 years, so then he hires a detective (Matt Damon) to find her. The detective then falls in love with Mary, which the detective gives Ted false information about Mary. Ted then still has a crush on her, which he still goes to Florida. They then find many people who are interested in Mary. It is a hilarious comedy which if you haven't seen, its a must see.The DVD includes great special features. It shows when Ben Stiller won the Best fight award with him and the dog at the Mtv movie awards. This also includes the theatrical trailer and 13 TV spots. It also includes the AMC backstory, which is great, and videos and interviews with the cast. It also shows the origin of the movie of how it came all about. There is much much more in this DVD which you should buy. The commentary with the Farrelly Brothers is hilarious. I also though they should have kept the alternate beginning, which is in clay, but its really cool. They give you 2 options to watch the movie, the theatrical version and the extended version with 15 minutes of never before seen scenes. There are interactive menus, which are in clay that are cool.

Very entertaining for those who still give off childish giggles at silly bathroom and pecker jokes passed around their 6th grade class.

The defects in this film are much greater than just the 'simplistic camera work' claimed by the main reviewer.  Along with the camera work, the entire premise of this film is simplistic in terms of its immaturity (e.g. the idea that lust=love, silly dating games, masturbation scenes, semen used as hair gel, human fesces littering an apartment, etc., etc.)Overall, a very silly comedy that can only appeal to the immature tastes of children or young adolescents.

In scenes like the &quot;zipper scene&quot; when Stiller got his &quot;private parts&quot; caught in the zipper did they  actually have to show it? I got the point after the thousandth time the  father, the mother, the cop, and the firefighter showed their bewilderment  at how Stiller got the zipper all the way up.(Don't show [it] please)  I was bewildered at how the &quot;release the tension&quot; scene was  filmed. I didn't think it was funny to see Stiller's facial expressions  while he was making &quot;fire-by-friction&quot; in the bathroom.(Less is  More Sometimes! ) The &quot;hair gel&quot; on the ear was just filthy.(Aye  Carumbe! ) The ending was anti-climactic to say the least as it ends like  everyone should expect as Stiller got the girl. There was nothing  interesting about how he got Mary.(At the end anyway) A decision is not  enough to get a laugh out of me. Sometimes more is  better! (Imagination)The whole scene when Stiller got arrested did not  get a chuckle out of me.(Homosexual jokes are examples of lowest common  denominator comedy. They are hackneyed and lack imagination.)

Decent performances from Ben Stiller and  Cameron Diaz didn't score a touchdown with me either.(Chris Elliot couldn't  save it) &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; is somewhat of a dud.

467172,A2JBVXCOTDW8XS,6305499071,Sean Wheeler,"[0, 1]","There's Something About Mary is, simply put, one of the funniest comedies of the 1990s.  It's not as sophiticated or innovative as Rushmore or Being John Malkovich, but it never attempts to aim this high.  The Farrellys only want to entertain their audience, and they accomplish this task ten-fold.A lot of attention was put on the gross-out gags during the film's initial release, but these moments only tell part of the story.  What really puts Mary over the edge are the smaller moments, and a lot of that credit has to go to Matt Dillon.  As the shady, none-to-bright claims investigator Pat Healy, Dillon gives of the best best performances of his career.  Healy is a terrific comic invention, a man so unaware of his repulsiveness he actually thinks he's being sensitive when he tells Mary he &quot;loves to work with retards&quot;.  Healy is the ultimate Farrelly character, a man who is so completely out-of-touch that he doesn't notice how much a fool he makes of himself.  It's a performance that would make W.C. Fields proud.The other performances are solid as well.

He hires an obnoxious guy named Patrick, played by Dillon, to spy on her and tell him what she's been up to. Well, Patrick falls for Mary, and decides to move out to Florida where she resides to get to know her, and he does. Ted discovers that Patrick isn't giving him the truth about Mary and goes out to find her himself. It turns out that Mary has many admirers who try to win her heart (or shoes!) besides the lonely Ted. So the movie becomes a race on who can get her first and forever.It's a silly tale but under the Farrellys direction, it's a surefire laugh-fest all the way through. Expect to see lots of sick humor like a guy giving a dog CPR, or bodily fluids used as toiletries. Also, the characters in Mary are funny by nature. The funniest character of them all is Warren, Mary's handicapped and heavy set brother, who punches people who touch his ears and loves to give piggy back rides.RecommendedB-",4,There's something funny about Mary,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1470,"['Farrelly', 'brothers', 'who', 'gave', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Kingpin', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'direct', 'Something', 'Mary', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Mask', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Outsiders', 'Crash', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Scary', 'Movie', '2', 'many', 'others.Mary', 'story', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'loser', 'named', 'Ted', 'played', 'Stiller', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'high', 'school', 'dreamgirl', 'Mary', 'played', 'charming', 'Diaz', 'mind', '13', 'years', 'prom', 'date', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'way', 'happened', 'obnoxious', 'guy', 'named', 'Patrick', 'played', 'Dillon', 'spy', 'tell', 'what', 'been', 'up', 'Well', 'Patrick', 'Mary', 'move', 'out', 'Florida', 'where', 'get', 'know', 'Ted', 'discovers', 'Patrick', ""n't"", 'giving', 'truth', 'Mary', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'Mary', 'many', 'admirers', 'who', 'try', 'win', 'heart', 'shoes', 'lonely', 'Ted', 'movie', 'race', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'first', 'forever.It', 'silly', 'tale', 'Farrellys', 'direction', 'surefire', 'laugh-fest', 'way', 'Expect', 'see', 'lots', 'sick', 'humor', 'guy', 'giving', 'dog', 'CPR', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'used', 'toiletries', 'Also', 'characters', 'Mary', 'are', 'funny', 'nature', 'funniest', 'character', 'Warren', 'Mary', 'handicapped', 'heavy', 'set', 'brother', 'who', 'people', 'who', 'touch', 'ears', 'loves', 'give', 'piggy', 'back', 'rides.RecommendedB-']",N/A

It has a feel that no comedy I've seen before has.  I guess since it's more of a ROMANTIC COMEDY.  Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, and Matt Dillon give their usual funny performances.  It's not just any romantic humor, there's also the usual sex humor.  Anyway, There's something about Mary just sparked my interest, so I recommend this movie for any Farrely fan or comedy fan.
