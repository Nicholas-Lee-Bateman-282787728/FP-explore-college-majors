567785,A3VGAP2KLCBNBB,B000055ZGK,"Amazon Customer ""epiamy""","[201, 204]","Neena and Veena are fabulous instructors.  There are three videos included: Basic Dance, Beyond Basic Dance, and Mystic Dance.  If you are deciding between VHS and DVD, I strongly recommend the DVD. The DVD has some great bellydancing extras on it, including some fitness bellydance examples. You can choose having the instructional voice on or off.My one complaint about these videos revolves around the instructional voice, which is not always in sync with what Neena and Veena are currently doing.  If I'm not paying attention, when I'm learning the steps, I can get frustrated by that, as I tend to listen to the voice more. (habit left from dancing and aerobics)I LOVE the videos.  These are the best bellydance instructional videos I've tried.  The camera focus is almost perfect - when small movements are occurring (say with the wrist), it's focussed on the wrist, or if there is a bit of trickier footwork - focus is on the the feet.  Otherwise, it's mostly a whole body shot - which is much better than many of the other bellydancing videos.Instruction starts slow - I like how they teach arm positions for you to be able to experiment.  The progression from slow to tempo does occur a little fast, but it's allowed me more enjoyment of the video because it has been a little more challenging.  It's not too difficult!The steps all come together in the end with a choreographed dance, which is great fun.  The videos definitely build skills from one to the other.  Once you've practiced a few times, and are getting the dance routines down, you will be getting a workout!!  My arms already look totally different, and I have more hip flexibility than I use to.These videos gave me enough experience to feel confident enough after three weeks of (secret) practice to give a dance to my husband.  He thought I'd been taking lessons on my lunch break.  (and no, he's not suave enough to have just come up with that!) :)Fun and energizing exercise, with an element of sensuality - for what more could I ask?",5,Best instructional bellydance videos,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,2013,"['Neena', 'Veena', 'are', 'fabulous', 'instructors', 'are', 'three', 'videos', 'included', 'Basic', 'Dance', 'Beyond', 'Basic', 'Dance', 'Mystic', 'Dance', 'are', 'deciding', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'great', 'bellydancing', 'extras', 'including', 'fitness', 'bellydance', 'examples', 'can', 'choose', 'having', 'instructional', 'voice', 'off.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'videos', 'revolves', 'instructional', 'voice', 'not', 'always', 'sync', 'what', 'Neena', 'Veena', 'are', 'currently', 'doing', ""'m"", 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', ""'m"", 'learning', 'steps', 'can', 'get', 'frustrated', 'tend', 'listen', 'voice', 'more', 'habit', 'left', 'dancing', 'aerobics', 'LOVE', 'videos', 'are', 'best', 'bellydance', 'instructional', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'camera', 'focus', 'almost', 'perfect', 'when', 'small', 'movements', 'are', 'occurring', 'say', 'wrist', 'focussed', 'wrist', 'bit', 'trickier', 'footwork', 'focus', 'feet', 'Otherwise', 'mostly', 'whole', 'body', 'shot', 'much', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'bellydancing', 'videos.Instruction', 'slow', 'like', 'how', 'teach', 'arm', 'positions', 'be', 'able', 'experiment', 'progression', 'slow', 'tempo', 'occur', 'little', 'fast', 'allowed', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'video', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'challenging', 'not', 'too', 'difficult', 'steps', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'great', 'fun', 'videos', 'definitely', 'build', 'skills', 'one', 'other', ""'ve"", 'practiced', 'few', 'times', 'are', 'getting', 'dance', 'down', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'workout', 'arms', 'already', 'look', 'totally', 'different', 'have', 'more', 'hip', 'flexibility', 'use', 'to.These', 'videos', 'gave', 'enough', 'experience', 'feel', 'confident', 'enough', 'three', 'weeks', 'secret', 'practice', 'give', 'dance', 'husband', 'thought', ""'d"", 'been', 'taking', 'lessons', 'lunch', 'break', 'not', 'suave', 'enough', 'have', 'just', 'come', 'up', 'Fun', 'energizing', 'exercise', 'element', 'sensuality', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask']",N/A
567786,A2VV4JWNKCQHF0,B000055ZGK,Basbenee,"[19, 19]","All three of these tapes are just excellent. The first one, 'Basic Dance,' teaches you the basics, 'Beyond Basic Dance' is a little more advanced, and the final tape, 'Mystic Dance,' goes beyond and offers veil instruction. Each tape starts with a great warmup and then isolates upper and lower body movements, demonstrates some steps and then leads the student into a choreographed dance routine with two practice sessions before the twins come out and do the final dance in full costume and to tempo. The production quality is excellent. The camerawork is great. If the twins are showing steps, the camera isn't focusing on their abs or breasts, like some other tapes do. Neena and Veena are also costumed appropriately in leggings and tank tops so you can see what they're doing as they show you the moves. Only at the end do they change into costume for the final dance routine. I own several other tapes by other dancers, and I think this series shows how to do the movements and dance steps most clearly. If I were told I could only keep one bellydance instructional series and to throw out the rest, I'd keep Neena and Veena.",5,You'll get hooked,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,1132,"['three', 'tapes', 'are', 'just', 'excellent', 'first', 'one', 'Dance', 'basics', 'Basic', 'Dance', 'little', 'more', 'advanced', 'final', 'tape', ""'Mystic"", 'Dance', 'veil', 'instruction', 'tape', 'great', 'warmup', 'then', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'movements', 'steps', 'then', 'student', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'routine', 'two', 'practice', 'sessions', 'twins', 'come', 'out', 'do', 'final', 'dance', 'full', 'costume', 'tempo', 'production', 'quality', 'excellent', 'camerawork', 'great', 'twins', 'are', 'showing', 'steps', 'camera', ""n't"", 'focusing', 'abs', 'breasts', 'other', 'tapes', 'do', 'Neena', 'Veena', 'are', 'also', 'costumed', 'appropriately', 'leggings', 'tank', 'tops', 'can', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'show', 'moves', 'Only', 'end', 'do', 'change', 'costume', 'final', 'dance', 'routine', 'own', 'several', 'other', 'tapes', 'other', 'dancers', 'think', 'series', 'how', 'do', 'movements', 'dance', 'steps', 'most', 'clearly', 'were', 'told', 'could', 'only', 'keep', 'one', 'bellydance', 'instructional', 'series', 'throw', 'out', 'rest', ""'d"", 'keep', 'Neena', 'Veena']",N/A

I am just as thrilled with this series as I am with their exercise videos. I am not a quick study when it comes to dance, but I immediately picked up almost every single move in the beginning video -- on the first go-around! They really break down the moves, slowly and clearly, and offer many good tips for executing the moves. Frankly, I learned far more from this video on the first go than I did in a six-week bellydance class at my local community college. FAR more!Unlike the earlier reviewer who regretted purchasing all three videos, I am looking forward to viewing the tape over and over (even though I quickly learned the moves), until I can *move* like the bellytwins when I execute those moves. I am delighted with the series, glad I purchased all three, and would gladly pay twice what I did if I had to replace them. I can only hope Veena and Neena will keep cranking out videos!

567790,A21BJRAY0I5WM9,B000055ZGK,Eden Russell,"[48, 58]","This is so far the lowest rating I've EVER given to an item bought on Amazon. I made the mistake to order these DVDs based on other very positive rarings. It was a HUGE mistake. These are the reasons why I gave this set only 2 stars.1. Instructions for dummies is really an overstatement. They go SO slow I get impatient. And I myself enjoy trying and trying until I get it right.2. I would mind them taking it slow if they would just show many things slowly. My greatest and biggest complaint is that these 3 DVDs contain next to nothing, showingly only 35-45 mins of instruction. The best qualification I could give them is empty of content - there is NO substance in them! Imagine, for a whole DVD of instructions they didn't have enough material to put together a routine for ONE whole song. (Well how can you make a decent dance when you've learnt just about 6 moves?!) In other words, these DVDs are NOT good value.3. It's a minor complaint compared to what I said above but I get very irritated by their smile that are just *plastered* on their faces. I never mind smiles but they really overdo it. It just doesn't give you a feeling they are enjoying themselves but posing instead.4. They are so slow and take lots of time to explain to you how to do hip lifts, then they just ""forget"" to instruct you. I don't mind the I-dance-you-copy style but then you might as well learn by watching a performances.5. I don't mind ""extas"" on DVDs but I do mind when they comprise 1/3 of the total run time. On each DVD there are several trailers of other products plus performances by other dancers. I love watching performances, don't get me wrong, but when I pay for an instructional DVD I expect to be instructed instead.There are few positive things about the set, so I should point them out too.1. The twins are beautiful. I can't deny them that. I actually have had the privilidge of watching them perform on another DVD set and I can call their performance no less than glorious. They have such impressive routines, including props such as swords, canes and veils. What a shame they show next to nothing of this in this set.2. They have very nice costumes and veils.3. They show VERY few moves but they do spend a lot of time on them, so you can learn them well.4. Production quality is good.IN CONCLUSION:Those who would benefit from these DVDs are *total* beginners who've NEVER bdanced before AND have no lasting interest in learning the depths of it. The third DVD is also good for those who want to learn the BASICS of the veil, so you may want to buy it seperately.I first saw some of these on my cable on demand and back then I thought they were great but now that I have done some research, I can compare the products available. For total beginners I definitely recommend Jenna's Basics for a Solid Foundation and Beyond. Neon's new DVD looks very promising. I don't own Amira's 101 but judging by the reviews it's worth checking out. For those who have some basic bellydance it's a great choice to get Jehan's Sacred Bellydance. For the same price you get THREE hours of wonderful instruction to last you months and months!In other words, before you click the ""order"" button make sure to consider your options because you CAN get better value for your money than this. I recommend this set only to people without bellydance experience who want to see ""what it's all about"" without paying a fortune. However, be prepared that if your interest is sparkled, you'll be spending more money soon on other, more substantial DVDs.",2,VERY disappointed,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,3534,"['so', 'far', 'lowest', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'given', 'item', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'made', 'mistake', 'order', 'DVDs', 'based', 'other', 'very', 'positive', 'rarings', 'was', 'HUGE', 'mistake', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'gave', 'set', 'only', '2', 'stars.1', 'Instructions', 'dummies', 'really', 'overstatement', 'go', 'SO', 'slow', 'get', 'impatient', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'trying', 'get', 'would', 'mind', 'taking', 'slow', 'would', 'just', 'show', 'many', 'things', 'slowly', 'greatest', 'biggest', 'complaint', '3', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'next', 'nothing', 'showingly', 'only', '35-45', 'mins', 'instruction', 'best', 'qualification', 'could', 'give', 'empty', 'content', 'substance', 'Imagine', 'whole', 'DVD', 'instructions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'material', 'put', 'together', 'routine', 'ONE', 'whole', 'song', 'Well', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'decent', 'dance', 'when', ""'ve"", 'learnt', 'just', '6', 'moves', 'other', 'words', 'DVDs', 'are', 'NOT', 'good', 'value.3', 'minor', 'complaint', 'compared', 'what', 'said', 'get', 'very', 'irritated', 'smile', 'are', 'just', '*plastered*', 'never', 'mind', 'smiles', 'really', 'overdo', 'just', ""n't"", 'give', 'feeling', 'are', 'enjoying', 'posing', 'instead.4', 'are', 'so', 'slow', 'take', 'lots', 'time', 'explain', 'how', 'do', 'hip', 'lifts', 'then', 'just', 'forget', 'instruct', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'I-dance-you-copy', 'style', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'learn', 'watching', 'performances.5', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'extas', 'DVDs', 'do', 'mind', 'when', 'comprise', '1/3', 'total', 'run', 'time', 'DVD', 'are', 'several', 'trailers', 'other', 'products', 'performances', 'other', 'dancers', 'love', 'watching', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'when', 'pay', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'expect', 'be', 'instructed', 'are', 'few', 'positive', 'things', 'set', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'too.1', 'twins', 'are', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'actually', 'have', 'had', 'privilidge', 'watching', 'perform', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'call', 'performance', 'less', 'glorious', 'have', 'such', 'impressive', 'routines', 'including', 'props', 'such', 'swords', 'canes', 'veils', 'What', 'shame', 'show', 'next', 'nothing', 'set.2', 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'costumes', 'veils.3', 'show', 'VERY', 'few', 'moves', 'do', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'can', 'learn', 'well.4', 'Production', 'quality', 'good.IN', 'CONCLUSION', 'who', 'would', 'benefit', 'DVDs', 'are', '*total*', 'beginners', 'who', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'bdanced', 'AND', 'have', 'lasting', 'interest', 'learning', 'depths', 'third', 'DVD', 'also', 'good', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'BASICS', 'veil', 'may', 'want', 'buy', 'seperately.I', 'first', 'saw', 'cable', 'demand', 'back', 'then', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'now', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'can', 'compare', 'products', 'available', 'total', 'beginners', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Jenna', 'Basics', 'Solid', 'Foundation', 'Beyond', 'Neon', 'new', 'DVD', 'very', 'promising', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'Amira', '101', 'judging', 'reviews', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'who', 'have', 'basic', 'bellydance', 'great', 'choice', 'get', 'Jehan', 'Sacred', 'Bellydance', 'same', 'price', 'get', 'THREE', 'hours', 'wonderful', 'instruction', 'last', 'months', 'months', 'other', 'words', 'click', 'order', 'button', 'make', 'sure', 'consider', 'options', 'CAN', 'get', 'better', 'value', 'money', 'recommend', 'set', 'only', 'people', 'bellydance', 'experience', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'paying', 'fortune', 'However', 'be', 'prepared', 'interest', 'sparkled', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spending', 'more', 'money', 'soon', 'other', 'more', 'substantial', 'DVDs']",N/A

I know more than a few talented young ladies who learned a lot from these courses, and who look better now than I likely ever will.  That said, I personally don't find the tapes (so to speak) appealing now, and I hope that my comments will be taken not so much as a criticism of these fine teachers, as an elucidation of how this course compares to one of the other styles that is out there, and hopefully the reader will find it helpful in confirming their choice of styles.These videos assume very little past experience with belly dance, and they teach a routine, element by element.  I don't like dance or exercise classes that are geared towards learning one specific routine.  I'd rather learn the bodywork and the overall feel.

White ""member of the 3AM Zill Brigade""","[8, 8]","May be the best you can get short of classes.I live in an area that up until a few months ago had no middle eastern dance instructors within less than a 1 hour radius. Since I didn't have a car, I couldn't take the weekly classes one hour away or more. I had only taken one, four hour workshop and had a few lessons from my friend and her mother previous to getting this set. Veena and Neena really helped me out. The warm-ups were relaxing and easy and once you got to learning the moves each one was shown briefly so you could see what you were going to learn, then broken down, then repeated at an increasing pace. I found that the voice over made it easier to concentrate than having them talk to you directly, as specialy because there were two of them and switching around would have been distracting. At the end of each tape you are taught a simple choreography which is first broken down, then rehearsed at it's normal pace with the music, and lastly Veena and Neena perform it in costume. I liked the music, which I don't think sounded like porn music or whatever that other person said. It sounded middle eastern, and the tempo of the music always matched what was going on and set a pace for you. Overall I thought the videos were not too short or too long and easy to learn with practice.A few months later I was pulled up to dance with dancer Suspira at the Marakesh. After her show she came to my table and complimented me, and even seemed amazed that most of what I learned was through videos! When I began classes a few months after that, my teacher was also impressed and I found that the moves being taught in class were easy to learn because I already knew the basics and was already loose and flexible, which is difficult for most beginners because they are not used to moving that way.

However, the special features of other bellydancers are great.  I feel that Veena and Neena are good instructors and that this set provides the ""bare bones"" of bellydance.  Like I said, if you're in classes you've probably worked on these moves already although they don't hurt to have around as practice drills.  If you are a beginner and don't know where to look, this is for you because this will give you a great running knowledge easily and effectively.  Again, just make sure you look at the special features to see how these basic moves can be built upon.As a personal sidenote, my only complaint is that their routines are specifically tailored to the one song that they have chosen instead of explaining how each move can be used for different elements of other songs.  If you were to learn the routine but don't have the song that they used, you really can't perform it in real life.

I bought this set after being exposed to arabic dancing from arabic friends so the first one was pretty easy for me. The difference, though, is when I dance with my friends we did not just focus on one move at a time, we just danced away. In the second tape the chest moves and hip moves really toned me up because you do strictly those moves a few minutes at a time. I love them!! On my sides where I used to be able to pinch fat has disappeared!!  I am so happy. The third tape is killer on the arms!! The turns, though, are too much for me. Even with spotting I get very dizzy so I just skip that part but I can do the turns in the choreographed dance. The voice-over did not bother me, and neither did their ""frozen"" smiles on their faces like it did some others. They really do break down the moves and teach you beginners belly dance!!  I must say, now, though, I use Suzanna DelVecchio's tapes for advanced instruction since I would say I am an advanced dancer.  But those Sensual Tapes really helped me polish and tone to be able to get more advanced!!  I love the way belly dance makes me feel so sensual and sexy!!",5,Great beginner set!!,1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1193,"['wonderful', 'set', 'someone', 'completely', 'new', 'bellydancing', 'bought', 'set', 'being', 'exposed', 'arabic', 'dancing', 'arabic', 'friends', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'easy', 'difference', 'when', 'dance', 'friends', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'focus', 'one', 'move', 'time', 'just', 'danced', 'away', 'second', 'tape', 'chest', 'moves', 'hip', 'moves', 'really', 'toned', 'up', 'do', 'strictly', 'moves', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'love', 'sides', 'where', 'used', 'be', 'able', 'pinch', 'fat', 'disappeared', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'third', 'tape', 'killer', 'arms', 'turns', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'Even', 'spotting', 'get', 'very', 'dizzy', 'just', 'skip', 'part', 'can', 'do', 'turns', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'voice-over', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'neither', 'did', 'frozen', 'smiles', 'did', 'others', 'really', 'do', 'break', 'down', 'moves', 'teach', 'beginners', 'belly', 'dance', 'must', 'say', 'now', 'use', 'Suzanna', 'DelVecchio', 'tapes', 'advanced', 'instruction', 'would', 'say', 'am', 'advanced', 'dancer', 'Sensual', 'Tapes', 'really', 'helped', 'polish', 'tone', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'more', 'advanced', 'love', 'way', 'belly', 'dance', 'feel', 'so', 'sensual', 'sexy']",N/A
