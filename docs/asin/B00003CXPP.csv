Carl Brashear, the son of a sharecropper, has joined the Navy with a promise to his dad to be something. After seeing Diver Billy Sunday in action, he sees his dream, and so begins this movie that sparkles with excellent performances by its leads and its script is well-written. The two meet again in a camp where Sunday is the commander. Although he respects Brashear, his boss orders him to flunk Carl. After going through all manner of hardships, he graduates. Then he is thrust into another dilemma as he loses his leg and must fight to stay where he is and achieve his dreams. A wonderful movie that feels like an old-fashioned drama, Men of Honor is an easy movie to watch, has a high entertainment value, and its high production values and inspirational message give it four stars.",4,Old-Fashioned Inspirational Story With Great Performances,997920000,"08 16, 2001",2001,876,"['movie', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'De', 'Niro', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Navy', 'Divers', 'WWII', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'son', 'sharecropper', 'joined', 'Navy', 'promise', 'dad', 'be', 'something', 'seeing', 'Diver', 'Billy', 'Sunday', 'action', 'dream', 'so', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'leads', 'script', 'well-written', 'two', 'meet', 'again', 'camp', 'where', 'Sunday', 'commander', 'Brashear', 'boss', 'orders', 'flunk', 'Carl', 'going', 'manner', 'hardships', 'Then', 'thrust', 'dilemma', 'leg', 'must', 'fight', 'stay', 'where', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'old-fashioned', 'drama', 'Men', 'Honor', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'high', 'entertainment', 'value', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'inspirational', 'message', 'give', 'four', 'stars']",N/A

Plus the story is very good, based on real events in the life of Navy Diver Carl Brashear, a true inspiration for children, teenagers, adults, well everyone, he is a great role model, too bad the movie was rated R for it's continuous use of bad language by De Niro, but the character needed it. If you don't mind, try and make children watch it, it is really a good inspiration and example for the, not the adult language, but the story, it blow me away, Too bad the Academy over-looked this great picture, it deserved at least some nominations, because this is a really good movie, Carl Brashear which is still alive by the way, must feel really proud, please, let's honour this great man and buy his movie, it is really worth it.

531907,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,B00003CXPP,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[1, 2]","First I'd like to say that the movie was entertaining and the acting was great.  What made the story  interesting was that the main character was attempting to become the first black Navy diver, not that the subject of Navy diving is itself interesting enough to make into a full length feature.  It is the stuff of one hour documentaries on the History or Discovery Channel.  But here we have the conflict of the old boys school and the civil rights movement and a man with a goal, to become a Master Diver in the U.S. Navy.It is perhaps a sad commentary on the American viewing public that in order to sell a movie that had at its base a fascinating story line; the movie had to include a lot of embellishment.  While I don't know the actual facts as they happened and perhaps no one has the memory to tell the tale completely; I do know &quot;acting&quot; when I see it and I do notice the &quot;dramatic elements&quot; thrown in to make the story more &quot;Hollywood&quot;.  Those elements were a disappointment in an otherwise good movie.I think the strongest statement the film makes is about fathers.  Mr. Brashears father tells him as he is about to board the Navy bus that no matter how hard it is going to get, and it will be hard he tells him, that he better not quit and he better never come back.  I don't know how much truth and how much fiction was included in the story version of the relationship between the Brashear father and son, but in the end I think it makes the strongest point of the movie.  It it isn't as important, in the long run, whether one is white or black, rich or poor, what matters is how strong the influence of your father was and if he was indeed a &quot;Man of Honor&quot;.This movie is a good inspirational story, and one that teens thinking about their futures could gain some enthusiasm from, which brings me back to my original complaint; I wish that the movie had followed the real story faithfully and told it like it was.  I think it would have made a better movie to not have the cardboard characterizations that were included in many of the roles.Even with my complaints I still recommend this movie, it is entertaining and there still lies a powerful and true message.",3,"Good message, Good man, why add the fluff?",1037491200,"11 17, 2002",2002,2220,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'What', 'made', 'story', 'interesting', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'attempting', 'become', 'first', 'black', 'Navy', 'diver', 'not', 'subject', 'Navy', 'diving', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'stuff', 'one', 'hour', 'documentaries', 'History', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'here', 'have', 'conflict', 'old', 'boys', 'school', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'man', 'goal', 'become', 'Master', 'Diver', 'U.S.', 'Navy.It', 'perhaps', 'sad', 'commentary', 'American', 'viewing', 'public', 'order', 'sell', 'movie', 'had', 'base', 'fascinating', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'had', 'include', 'lot', 'embellishment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actual', 'facts', 'happened', 'perhaps', 'one', 'memory', 'tell', 'tale', 'completely', 'do', 'know', 'quot', 'acting', 'quot', 'when', 'see', 'do', 'notice', 'quot', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'quot', 'thrown', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'elements', 'were', 'disappointment', 'otherwise', 'good', 'movie.I', 'think', 'strongest', 'statement', 'film', 'fathers', 'Mr.', 'Brashears', 'father', 'board', 'Navy', 'bus', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'going', 'get', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'better', 'not', 'quit', 'better', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'truth', 'how', 'much', 'fiction', 'was', 'included', 'story', 'version', 'relationship', 'Brashear', 'father', 'son', 'end', 'think', 'strongest', 'point', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'long', 'run', 'one', 'white', 'black', 'rich', 'poor', 'what', 'how', 'strong', 'influence', 'father', 'was', 'was', 'indeed', 'quot', 'Man', 'Honor', 'quot', 'movie', 'good', 'inspirational', 'story', 'one', 'thinking', 'futures', 'could', 'gain', 'enthusiasm', 'back', 'original', 'complaint', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'followed', 'real', 'story', 'faithfully', 'told', 'was', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'cardboard', 'characterizations', 'were', 'included', 'many', 'roles.Even', 'complaints', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'still', 'powerful', 'true', 'message']",N/A
531908,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXPP,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","It's funny because last night I was kind of formulating how I wanted to phrase this review and the first thing that came to mind was `by the numbers' and then this AM, when talking to a fellow Ammy friend (cough*MKIA*cough) he mentioned that a certain biopic was NOT `by the numbers'.  I just find that humorous.Maybe it was a sign.So, `Men of Honor' suffers from that very clich&eacute; though.  It is, for lack of a better phrase, very `by the numbers'; to the point where they fictionalized a character to create an even more `by the numbers' feel.  Your standard biopic consists of `average man or woman overcoming obstacles to do something above average'.  Some of these `standard' biopic films can overcome that generic approach by technical merits and acting that transcends the minimalist approach.  Other films suffer from appearing too simple and overly formulaic and thus wind up too forgettable.I think that is the problem with `Men of Honor'.As much as the overall story itself is one of inspiration, it comes across as slightly cheap in production and overall impact.  The acting is decent to good, but never more than that.  De Niro does give us something more in parts, but his clich&eacute; ridden character (he is the fictionalized character in the story) doesn't seem to find enough footing to remain grounded.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is one of those actors who just don't always work.  His memorably fantastic work in `Jerry Maguire' seems more and more like a fluke with every performance I see from him.  He is effective here, but nothing more than that.  He never wows me.  The beautiful Charlize Theron has some moments, but nothing that transcends stereotype and Aunjanue Ellis seems like an afterthought (as does her storyline).When you look at `Men of Honor' as a made-for-TV `movie of the week' (which it certainly feels like), then it becomes more palatable.  The film is far from bad, and it has moments of uplifting inspiration, but overall it fails to really deliver what it is capable of.  Instead it relies on a ridiculous amount of clich&eacute;s and borrowed themes to create something we've seen done a million times before; much better at that.",3,By-The-Numbers,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,2176,"['funny', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'kind', 'formulating', 'how', 'wanted', 'phrase', 'review', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'numbers', 'then', 'AM', 'when', 'talking', 'fellow', 'Ammy', 'friend', 'cough*MKIA*cough', 'mentioned', 'certain', 'biopic', 'was', 'NOT', 'numbers', 'just', 'find', 'humorous.Maybe', 'was', 'sign.So', 'Men', 'Honor', 'suffers', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'very', 'numbers', 'point', 'where', 'fictionalized', 'character', 'create', 'even', 'more', 'numbers', 'feel', 'standard', 'biopic', 'average', 'man', 'woman', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'do', 'something', 'average', 'standard', 'biopic', 'films', 'can', 'overcome', 'generic', 'approach', 'technical', 'merits', 'acting', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'Other', 'films', 'suffer', 'appearing', 'too', 'simple', 'overly', 'formulaic', 'thus', 'wind', 'up', 'too', 'forgettable.I', 'think', 'problem', 'Men', ""Honor'.As"", 'much', 'overall', 'story', 'one', 'inspiration', 'slightly', 'cheap', 'production', 'overall', 'impact', 'acting', 'decent', 'good', 'never', 'more', 'De', 'Niro', 'give', 'something', 'more', 'parts', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'character', 'fictionalized', 'character', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'enough', 'footing', 'remain', 'grounded', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'memorably', 'fantastic', 'work', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'more', 'more', 'fluke', 'performance', 'see', 'effective', 'here', 'nothing', 'more', 'never', 'beautiful', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'moments', 'nothing', 'stereotype', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'afterthought', 'storyline', '.When', 'look', 'Men', 'Honor', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'week', 'certainly', 'then', 'more', 'palatable', 'film', 'far', 'bad', 'moments', 'uplifting', 'inspiration', 'overall', 'really', 'deliver', 'what', 'capable', 'Instead', 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'clich', 'eacute', 'borrowed', 'themes', 'create', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'much', 'better']",N/A

Carl Brashear, a black sharecropper's son who joined the Navy in response to a recruiting sergeant's promises, finds himself in the galley. He's told there were only two jobs for a black man in the navy: cook or a white officer's orderly.But he's a great swimmer, and has the guts to apply for diving school. After two years and hundreds of letters, he is admitted. These are the deep sea divers with the big suits and hoses that go to the surface, looking like something out of Jules Verne. Of course it's very tough, especially with the dirty tricks of the bigots, but he graduates.Then one day an airplane lost a nuclear bomb in the Atlantic Ocean, and Brashear is sent to retrieve it. The dive is harrowing enough, especially when a Soviet submarine shows up. But he finds the bomb and it is being hoisted aboard the recovery vessel when an accident sends a steel cable with its mounting bracket whipping across the deck, nearly severing Brashear's left leg.So he's retired out on disability, right? Wrong. This is a man who simply does not give up. An inspiring story and superb performances by Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Brashear and Robert DeNiro as the officer named Billy Sunday who says that the only difference between him and the evangelist by the same name is that he IS god!Hal Holbrook also appears as the totally bonkers commander of the diving school.

531919,A1GB1Q193DNFGR,B00003CXPP,Bruce Lee Pullen,"[11, 15]","George Tillman Jr's blatantly syrupy and corny cinematic voyage into the tumultuous naval career of America's first African-American Master Diver Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is an excessively blunt and fairly obvious attempt to felicitate massive emotions from the audience through another predictable man against the world formula. Essentially a rehash of any underdog coming-of-age sports movie (Rocky, Karate Kid, Rudy,) Men of Honor takes a typically idealistic but class challenged character and puts him through the paces of trying to prove himself in his own mind and, in spite of his ethnicity and personal background, validate his cause upon the hearts of others.  As the audience follows Brashear on his predestined path, we meet a typically callous and hard-hitting commanding officer Master Chief Billy Sunday played marvelously by the always-authoritative Robert De Niro. Sunday is another stock De Niro character that is hot-tempered, violently impulsive, alcoholic, loud-mouthed, aggressively defiant against authority, and haunted by his human frailties on a daily basis. Through this unlikely union between these drastically varied men, Brashear eventually finds the will, determination, and persistence to succeed in the military amidst the initial resistance and eventual encouragement of Master Chief Sunday.Including an all-star supporting cast comprising Hal Holbrook (Mr. Pappy), Carlize Theron (Gwen Sunday), Powers Boothe (Captain Pullman), and Michael Rapaport (Snowhill), Men of Honor supplies the acting muscle necessary particularly in the leads to upgrade what could have been a gooey dramatic hokum into a sound military period piece that still slightly disappoints, by supplying more  sentimentality than film needs, in remaining entirely real throughout.When this well-acted tale reaches DVD, I hope it contains a George Tillman Jr. commentary track, theatrical trailers, making-of documentaries, and much much more.

Off course in those days (the 40's) black people where only good as cooks in the army.

However as the story continues and Brashear starts beating the odds and becoming the best Navy Diver the US Navy ever has had, more and more people start respecting him. Also Mr. Sunday. So he passes his exam after a long, hard and verry cold test. And becomes the first black US Navy diver, from here you must go and see the film your self.

531923,A352ULL611TIYJ,B00003CXPP,christopher b. banks,"[6, 7]","Carl Brashere's life is chronicled in this &quot;against all odds&quot; movie that highlights his resilience vs. the &quot;old navy&quot;. The opening scenes display the hard, farm life Brashere (Cuba Gooding Jr.) was born into, conveying the &quot;back breaking&quot; fortitude his father displays, in order to keep the family farm. When Brashere originally enlists, he notifies the family of his chosen career, the elder Brashere,(Carl Lumby) sternly warns his son of returning home - intensifying the young Brashere's intention to buck the system and prevail at all costs...  Early on, in his tour of duty, Brashere is relegated to cook's detail, the obvious choice for young enlisted african-american naval men. Undaunted, Brashere vows to become an elite member of the Naval Diving Core. Initially, he is laughed at by his fellow naval men.  After dilligent pursuit in seeking admission into the Naval Diving School he is finally accepted upon sending countless letters.  Master Seargant Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro) is the self-proclaimed god of the training school,where he puts trainees thru pure-hell in order to qualify as a deep sea diver. The DeNiro character is a hard-charging, whiskey drinking southerner who has trouble following orders - and he's prone to violence if provoked.  Brashere confronts racism immediately once arriving on the base. His bunk-mates refuse to share the dorm - walking out one by one. His only friend is the Michael Rappaport character, who just seems to be an outcast, but provides support for Brashere.  The real conflict is between Brashere and Sunday, who quietly have a mutual admiration for each other, sighting their similar backgrounds. Brashere breezes thru the training, until the last obstacle. Pappy, the brash General who's aloofness is apparent when hunkering over the men in an oversized tower. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) is totally against Brashere graduating, and directs Sunday to halt his progress by all means. Without divulging an enormous amount of information Brashere remains the victor.During this period, Brashere's career is on the upswing and Sunday's is in a downward spiral. Sunday's hostility and drunkeness escalates during a party where he assaults a Naval officer. I love DeNiro's southern accent - it's almost similar to the Max Cady character in &quot;Cape Fear&quot; minus the decadence.  Brashere's dedication and fearlessness is further tested when he is injured during a dive. He is forced to go against the grain again during a lengthy trial. Requesting re-admission into the Navy, versus the serious injury, Brashere's back is against the wall once again . Who's there to help him? None other than the raucous Sunday, who appears out of nowhere, to assist Brashere. Of course, we know the final outcome, but who cares!!! It's a feelgood movie..Director Tillman, seems adept at making these types of movies..ie: Soul Food..Plus it's a true story, making it more conceivable. Only drawback, in my estimation, are the scenes between Carl Brashere and his wife, which seem misplaced and not in tune with the picture.

Carl Brashear did in fact lose a leg from a shipboard accident and did come back from that tradegy to become a master diver with an artificial leg.  And he faced a lot of racism.  The man had super-human determination.  He actually wrote 100's of letters to even get admitted to diving school, as  told in the movie.  He is a true hero and this is a very inspirational movie.  I had never taken Cuba Gooding, Jr. very seriously, probably because of having seen him in light comedies before this.  He proved himself more than capable of handling a difficult, dramatic role.  He is still not a matured actor and has a way to go to be as good as more seasoned actors.  In spite of that, he really pulled off this role very well.  De Niro does a wonderful job too as the unrelenting trainer.  Yes, there are some things in the movie that seem a bit contrived, but it didn't bother me because I knew I was watching the story of a great hero.

This movie is the true story of Brashear and his determination to fulfill his dream of becoming a Navy diver, despite all of the artifical and medical obstacles which lay in his way.During the epoch covered in this film, African Americans were restricted by the Navy to only being either cooks or Boatswains Mates.  Being a former Boatswains Mate myself, I can attest to just how unglamourous a position it is;  kind of like the Navy's counterpart to Infranty in the Army.Brashear was one of the first, if not the very first black sailors to break this pattern.  As the first African American to be admitted to Navy diving school, Brashear was forced to endure a degree of the unwarranted prejudice, animosity and hatred that nobody should have to put up with.Some of the other reviews have accused this movie of being cliche and commonplace.  I could not disagree more.  Have there been other recent movies that have depicted the trials &amp; tribulations of this volatile time in American history?  Most assuredly there have.  Does that make this movie superfluous or unnecessary?  Of course not.  This is a very important movie that deals with part of who we are as Americans, as well as who we want to become.Unlike many nations which have had difficulty with racial realtions, I believe that we (in the USA) have come a long way.  The racial milieu we have created is far from perfect, particularly in the military.  My time in the Navy can bear witness to that.  However, thanks to pioneers such as Carl Brashear, we all live in a more tolerant, accepting and understanding nation than what it was a mere 40 years ago.  The acrimonious relations have not subsided, but have at least not maintained being the &quot;norm&quot; of Navy life.  Were it not for people like Brashear, it is not absurd to think that nothing would have changed at all.  If anyone wants my opinion, I believe there should be more movies like &quot;Men Of Honor,&quot; not fewer.",5,Inspirational!,988329600,"04 27, 2001",2001,2077,"['would', 'not', 'be', 'wide', 'mark', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Navy', 'diving', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'Brashear', 'determination', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'becoming', 'Navy', 'diver', 'artifical', 'medical', 'obstacles', 'lay', 'way.During', 'epoch', 'covered', 'film', 'African', 'Americans', 'were', 'restricted', 'Navy', 'only', 'being', 'cooks', 'Boatswains', 'Mates', 'Being', 'former', 'Boatswains', 'Mate', 'can', 'attest', 'just', 'how', 'unglamourous', 'position', 'kind', 'Navy', 'counterpart', 'Infranty', 'Army.Brashear', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'not', 'very', 'first', 'black', 'sailors', 'break', 'pattern', 'first', 'African', 'American', 'be', 'admitted', 'Navy', 'diving', 'school', 'Brashear', 'was', 'forced', 'endure', 'degree', 'unwarranted', 'prejudice', 'animosity', 'hatred', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'with.Some', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'accused', 'movie', 'being', 'cliche', 'commonplace', 'could', 'not', 'disagree', 'more', 'Have', 'there', 'been', 'other', 'recent', 'movies', 'have', 'depicted', 'trials', 'amp', 'tribulations', 'volatile', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'Most', 'assuredly', 'have', 'make', 'movie', 'superfluous', 'unnecessary', 'course', 'not', 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'deals', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'Americans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'want', 'become.Unlike', 'many', 'nations', 'have', 'had', 'difficulty', 'racial', 'realtions', 'believe', 'USA', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'racial', 'milieu', 'have', 'created', 'far', 'perfect', 'particularly', 'military', 'time', 'Navy', 'can', 'bear', 'witness', 'However', 'thanks', 'pioneers', 'such', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'live', 'more', 'tolerant', 'accepting', 'understanding', 'nation', 'what', 'was', 'mere', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'acrimonious', 'relations', 'have', 'not', 'subsided', 'have', 'least', 'not', 'maintained', 'being', 'quot', 'quot', 'Navy', 'life', 'Were', 'not', 'people', 'Brashear', 'not', 'absurd', 'think', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'anyone', 'opinion', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'quot', 'Men', 'Honor', 'quot', 'not', 'fewer']",N/A

531944,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXPP,"""flickjunkie""","[14, 15]","Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves.  Among the more prominent we have, ""Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Top Gun"", ""GI Jane"", and now ""Men of Honor"".  The fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same.  This film is probably most like ""GI Jane"" since it focuses on the desegregation angle.The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human-interest story among those mentioned above.  Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film.  Unfortunately, director George Tillman, Jr. has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity.  Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and except for the initial scene, the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife, we don't know much about him.  For instance, Brashear sees the scars on Sunday's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow, but there is no follow-up on that point.  Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him.  The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting.  If a director is going to make a human-interest story, he needs to humanize the characters.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear.  This is probably the best I've seen him.  This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before, and he rises to the occasion.  In ""Jerry Maguire"", Rod Tidwell was a fascinating, but one-dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle.  Brashear is much more complex and grounded, and the issues he faces are life crises, making the part far more challenging.  This is an excellent recovery from Gooding's last role in ""Chill Factor"", a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part.After a stint trying his hand as a comedian (""Analyze This"", ""The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle"", ""Meet The Parents""), Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance.  DeNiro isn't a bad comedian, he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn't waste his time doing comedy.  DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul.  It is a pleasure watching him work.It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it.  I saw ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"", ""Men of Honor"" and ""The Yards"" right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 (actually, she only did five).  This was a minor role for Theron, but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step.  David Keith, who co-starred with Richard Gere in ""Officer and a Gentleman"", has a cameo hereThe DVD has some interesting special features, including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes.I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one-dimensional presentation.  I rated it a 7/10.  I'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme.

531946,AY12DBB0U420B,B00003CXPP,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Men of Honor"" Starring Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding, Jr. I found it in the five dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was a good movie and a fine bargain. The movie was an inspiring and uplifting story of an African American young man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who joined the Navy in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a Navy diver. It began in the early fifties when President Harry Truman had ended segregation and the Navy was now open to any race. Well, it was open all right, but if you were an African American, that meant you could be a part of the cooking gallery. Becoming a diver was out of the question. You just weren't qualified, and there were a lot of people to see that you didn't get a chance.Understanding the whole segregation thing was always difficult for me because I grew up in areas of the U.S. that were fully integrated. I remember that our High School (Boulder, Colorado) had an African American student (out of about 650 total students). I'd spot him from time to time and there didn't seem to be any significant problems. The University of Colorado had African American students enrolled and a number of them were in the sports programs, especially football. Everything seemed to be peaceful, but from time to time you'd hear some nasty racial slurs and none of the the African Americans could join any of the fraternities or sororities. It was just out of the question. The whole racial segregation thing didn't really fully hit me until I attended a Geological Society of America Meeting held in New Orleans in 1965. I was somewhat amazed at seeing the back of busses reserved for colored people, and then there were the colored drinking fountains. But I think the thing that struck home the most was a Billips Service Station. On one side of the bright white building were three doors. One was labeled men, one woman and one, the farthest back, was labeled colored. The building itself was sparkling bright white ceramic blocks, except around the colored door. Both the door and the blocks surrounding the door were stained and filthy and looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in the history of the building. I could only wonder what the interior of that little room might be like.Well, things like this have largely vanished. Haven't they? Well, at least I don't see anything of the sort. In any case, if you are curious to know what the conditions and attitudes were in the fifties, this is an excellent movie depiction. If you didn't live through this period, you may think this is just a movie fantasy. It isn't. And this was the environment faced by Gooding's character as he strived to serve his country as a Navy diver. De Niro played Gooding's next in command, and did an excellent job.

It's not flashy and has a good old-fashioned look and feel about it. Cuba Gooding Jr. enters the Navy with all good intentions but the lingering effects of a segregated military, even though recently abolished, weigh heavy on him.

Ordered by commanding officer Hal Holbrook to fail Gooding, De Niro begins to learn the real meaning of honor as shown by Gooding's determination and perseverance at insurmountable odds. Perhaps Gooding's conduct possibly rekindled in De Niro the recognition of those qualities that defined and are the very essence of honor in De Niro's burdened psyche.

Cuba Gooding Jr does a great job playing Carl M. Brashear, the first African American Naval Diver.If you ever have the feeling that you want to quit or give up on something you should watch this film for inspiration.Unfortunately, today, we lost this great man.  I have attached the story from CNN below.RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) -- Carl M. Brashear, the first black U.S. Navy diver who was portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr. in the 2000 film ""Men of Honor,"" died Tuesday. He was 75.Brashear died at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth of respiratory and heart failure, the medical center said.Brashear retired from the Navy in 1979 after more than 30 years of service. He was the first Navy diver to be restored to full active duty as an amputee, the result of a leg injury he sustained during a salvage operation.""The African-American community lost a great leader today in Carl Brashear,"" Gooding said of the man he played alongside Robert DeNiro, who was Brashear's roughneck training officer in ""Men of Honor."" ""His impact to us as a people and all races will be felt for many decades to come.""In 1966 Brashear was assigned to recover a hydrogen bomb that dropped into waters off of Spain when two U.S. Air Force planes collided.During the mission Brashear was struck below his left knee by a pipe that the crew was using to hoist the bomb out of the water. Brashear was airlifted to a naval hospital where the bottom of his left leg was amputated to avoid gangrene. It later was replaced with a prosthetic leg.The Navy was ready to retire Brashear from active duty, but he soon began a grueling training program that included diving, running and calisthenics.""Sometimes I would come back from a run, and my artificial leg would have a puddle of blood from my stump. I wouldn't go to sick bay because they would have taken me out of the program,"" Brashear said in 2002 when he was inducted into the Gallery of Great Black Kentuckians. ""Instead, I'd go hide somewhere and soak my leg in a bucket of hot water with salt in it -- that's an old remedy I learned growing up.""Brashear faced an uphill battle when he joined the Navy in 1948 at the age of 17, not long after the U.S. military desegregated.""I went to the Army office, and they weren't too friendly,"" Brashear said in 2002. ""But the Navy recruiter was a lot nicer. Looking back, I was placed in my calling.""Brashear, the son of poor sharecroppers in Sonora, Kentucky, quickly decided after boot camp that he wanted to become a deep-sea diver.""Growing up on a farm in Kentucky, I always dreamed of doing something challenging,"" he said. ""When I saw the divers for the first time, I knew it was just what I wanted.""In 1954 he was accepted and graduated from the diving program, despite daily battles with discrimination, including having hate notes left on his bunk.He went on to train for advanced diving programs before his 1966 incident.""He kept to himself personally, but his military life was an open book,"" said Junetta Brashear, his first wife, who lives in Portsmouth, Virginia, near Brashear's home in Virginia Beach.She said Brashear's health started to deteriorate about three years ago, but that he had experienced problems ever since the amputation.Brashear married childhood friend Junetta Wilcox in 1952 and had four children -- Shazanta, DaWayne, Phillip and Patrick -- before their divorce in 1978.

It was not easy. But we must note that the dedication on the sleeves of the DVD is absurd. It says ""History is made by those who break the rules."" In fact the ostracism against this first Black diver goes against the rules that come from the Commander in Chief, the President of the US who ordered the integration of US armed forces. In fact some officers who are living in their racist traditions can actually give an order to drown the black diver and this black diver is graduated because the training officer decides to disobey the order from this commanding officer because it goes against his code of honor for which all US soldiers, sailors or pilots or whatever are equal in front of the flag, the national duty and the constitution. History in this case is made by those who decide to disobey orders from bigot officers, in other words to abide by the real constitutional rules. The film is slightly romantic in a way when it shows how this Black man is really doing more than his share of good and courageous acts and is often side-tracked and rejected, even for a medal he actually deserves that is yet given to some other white diver. Effective in its emotionality but yet only emphasizing the human side of things and not the political back-side of them. It sure cracks down on the Washington pencil-pushing bureaucrats who write the rules and regulations of US armed forces though they hardly know what real field courage can be because they never had, nor looked for, the opportunity to meet with a death-bringing mission. It is true that today the racial problem is no longer so much to be accepted when Black as to be respected as having the same stamina, courage and spiritual force as the whites or any human being, in other words we are no longer dealing with tolerating them with a smile but with accepting them as being equal, hence as having the possibility to be better.

I really enjoyed the scene where `Master Chief Billy Sunday' made the determination not to contribute to a man's death just to preserve the navy's status quo...or his own.  The best scene in the movie was when `Brashear' (Gooding, Jr) finally completed his assembly.  This is a movie everyone needs to see because it portrays a man who absolutely ""ain't got no quit in him"" in a period when society expected nothing more then his giving up and giving in.  It also portrays a realistic struggle of a man that has to overcome not only his own prejudices, but must battle personal demons.  The irony is that he succeeds in conquering both, due in large part to his unconventional relationship with a man that that he never even considered being friends with.

Just getting selected to go to the training takes effort and determination by Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.),  He also has to overcome racism and he has to not only meet but to exceed the standards required to become a Navy diver.  You see, he is trying to become the first black man to even become a diver, let alone a Master Chief.As the movie starts, Navy divers are trying to locate and recover a lost 50 megaton nuclear bomb that was dropped by a USA aircraft that was ditching in the Mediterranean Sea. Master Chief Petty Officer William Sunday meanwhile sits in an airport with two military police setting by his side as they escort him back for deserting.Brashear overcomes many obstacles to become a diver.  His education stopped when he was in the 7th grade because he had to work on his family's farm in order for them to be able to live there.  The farm work made him a strong and tough man but he lacked in his formal education.  He had to study extra hard to pass the tests required of a Navy diver.Brashear finds out that the Sunday is the training head instructor at the school that is located in Bayonne, New Jersey.  Brashear knows Sunday as they served together on the same ship.  Brashear is there when Sunday risks his life to save a drowning diver and that is what inspires him become a diver.  Brashear enlists the aid of a beautiful woman studying to be a doctor to help him pass the tests.  She is his strength as he struggles through the diving school......This is an excellent movie and both Cuba Gooding Jr and Robert De Niro do excellent jobs portraying their roles in this film.  I enjoyed the movie.  The inspiration I learned of by watching the story of a brave and tough man, Carl Brashear, was motivating.

The story is a cinematic, biographical sketch of Carl Brashear, the first African-American to become a diver for the US Navy. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Robert De Niro both give Oscar calibre performances in this gripping film.The movie tells the story of Carl Brashear, whose parents instilled in him a determination that would cause him never to give up his dream of becoming a diver in the US Navy. He stuck to his guns, despite the overt racism that he encountered when he joined the Navy. The racism that he encountered would make it harder for him to achieve his life long dream.Once he became a diver, Mr. Brashear upped the ante and strove to become a master diver. He struggled to do this against all odds, and just when he was on the cusp of achieving his goal, a tragic accident befell him, derailing him temporarily from the path to his ultimate goal. What he then does to fulfill his dream is radical, yet inpirational.Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives a perfomance so moving and heroic, that the viewer feels like giving him a twenty one gun salute at the end of the film. Robert De Niro plays a racist master diver who is ultimately converted to the side of the angels, when he realizes that Carl Brashear is truly the best of the best. His performance is stellar.The only problem with the movie is that most of the supporting roles pale in comparison to the two central ones played by Gooding and De Niro. Charlize Theron's role, that of De Niro's wife, is really superfluous to the story. Aunjanue Ellis, who affectingly plays Gooding's wife, has a more crucial, pivotal role than Ms. Theron, but remains a shadowy figure in the backround. Hal Holbrook's portrayal of a loony, racist Navy commander is rather one dimensional, more of a caricature than a character. Notwithstanding these small shortcomings, this is a riveting film that should not be missed.",4,A TRUE AMERICAN HERO...,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1969,"['wonderful', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'indictment', 'US', 'Navy', 'certain', 'time', 'history', 'story', 'cinematic', 'biographical', 'sketch', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'first', 'African-American', 'become', 'diver', 'US', 'Navy', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'give', 'Oscar', 'calibre', 'performances', 'gripping', 'film.The', 'movie', 'story', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'parents', 'instilled', 'determination', 'would', 'cause', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'becoming', 'diver', 'US', 'Navy', 'stuck', 'guns', 'overt', 'racism', 'encountered', 'when', 'joined', 'Navy', 'racism', 'encountered', 'would', 'make', 'harder', 'achieve', 'life', 'long', 'dream.Once', 'became', 'diver', 'Mr.', 'Brashear', 'upped', 'ante', 'strove', 'become', 'master', 'diver', 'struggled', 'do', 'odds', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'cusp', 'achieving', 'goal', 'tragic', 'accident', 'befell', 'derailing', 'temporarily', 'path', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'What', 'then', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'radical', 'yet', 'inpirational.Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'perfomance', 'so', 'moving', 'heroic', 'viewer', 'feels', 'giving', 'twenty', 'one', 'gun', 'salute', 'end', 'film', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'racist', 'master', 'diver', 'who', 'ultimately', 'converted', 'side', 'angels', 'when', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'truly', 'best', 'best', 'performance', 'stellar.The', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'most', 'supporting', 'roles', 'pale', 'comparison', 'two', 'central', 'ones', 'played', 'Gooding', 'De', 'Niro', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'role', 'De', 'Niro', 'wife', 'really', 'superfluous', 'story', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'who', 'affectingly', 'Gooding', 'wife', 'more', 'crucial', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'backround', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'portrayal', 'loony', 'racist', 'Navy', 'commander', 'rather', 'one', 'dimensional', 'more', 'caricature', 'character', 'Notwithstanding', 'small', 'shortcomings', 'riveting', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Brashear joined the Navy in 1952, the son of a Kentucky sharecropper.  The Navy had just been integrated, but that didn't mean that he would be accepted by the men.  In those days, a black man in the Navy became either a cook or an officer's valet.  But Brashear was determined to be a diver.There's tension throughout as he has to overcome one obstacle after another. And a great scene when he is taking his final diving test and has to assemble the pieces of a pump while underwater and his test is rigged to make it almost impossible to pass.  I felt I was right down there with him as he struggled in cold water hour after hour.  This is not a story about big battle scenes.  Rather, it is about relations between people.  DeNiro is at first as cruel as the other men, but as he comes to appreciate the determination and love of diving that Brashear has, we see his character change.  It's an excellent theme.But yet, the film itself somehow missed being great.  I blame it on the screenplay itself.  It's too maudlin, too oversimplified, too much like a soap opera.  The actors did a fine job.  But the material they had too work with could have been a lot better.  I do recommend this video, especially for young people.

I'm sure this has a lot to do with my upbringing, what with father who's worked in or with the military in one way or another for most of my life. But I think that there is something more fundamental about it to me. The basic precepts appeal to me. Honor, respect, loyalty.This movie was pretty much what one would expect. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays Carl Brashear, a young black man who wants nothing more than to be a Navy diver. But, well, he's a young black man. Did I mention that this is in the 40s? Against all odds (a required element in this sort of things), he manages to get to dive school, where he is faced with Billy Sunday (played by Robert DeNiro). Sunday has no interest in passing this upstart young black man, but is slowly won over by Brashear's determination. With the help of Sunday (who was demoted for his trouble), Brashear passes, and begins the slow climb to the rank of Master Diver. As one would expect, Something Major happens, and Our Hero is faced with Mighty Adversity, and his Former Nemesis comes to his aid.Seriously, though, there are no surprises in this movie. It's all very formulaic. You have all the right elements. The bad guy turned good. The legions of people who learn to overcome their racism, inspired by the young hero. The hero builds up to a pinnacle, then is broken, only to be built up again. The stern, smarmy, unpleasant persons in positions of power. The loving wife.However, the fact that this movie follows the rote doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. I think it's a pretty good example of the genre, actually. And it pains me to say this, since I generally don't care for Cuba Gooding, Jr., and he really made the movie. He played his role to a T. Of course, you can't overlook DeNiro. He's getting to be rather good at this sort of role. Maybe it's the gray hair.All in all, if you're fan of the patently sentimental military movies, this is a good one to watch.

531980,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXPP,Matthew Horner,"[0, 4]","Men of Honor is a biographical movie about Carl Brashear, who was the first Afro-American Navy diver in history. What could have been an inspiring film about one man's overcoming of some very big obstacles turns out instead to be a standard and predictable military flick. It is entertaining enough, but its subject matter deserved more creative effort.Brashear [Cuba Gooding, Jr., grew up during World War II on a tenant farm in Kentucky. His father's dream was that Carl would turn out to be somebody, that he would leave the farm and never come back. Carl joined the Navy in the early 50s. Our armed forces had been desegregated by President Truman in 1948, but Carl soon finds out that the Navy has paid only lip service to this change. About the only jobs available to blacks are those of cooks or drivers. After persisting for several years, Carl finally gets admitted to the Navy diving school. At first, Billy Sunday [Robert De Niro}, the head instructor, won't let Carl onto the base. Then his fellow students, all of them white, refuse to bunk with him. After that, it only gets worse. Carl must prove himself over and over again. But as I said, Carl is a very persistent fellow who would rather die than disappoint his father.As far as I know, the movie faithfully follows Brashear's career path, but I suspect great liberties have been taken with the characters he met along the way. Billy Sunday is portrayed as a foul-mouth, bigoted redneck, who will do anything he can think of, of as well as anything he is ordered to do, to prevent Carl from succeeding. Then, in typical Hollywood fashion, Sunday turns out to be a good guy underneath it all. I know what the movie is trying to say. People change. Still, Sunday's early behavior goes way beyond macho spirit breaking. It is mean and vindictive, and one wonders how Carl can speak to the man later, much less let him help him.Gooding and De Niro, professionals that they are, do excellent jobs with characters that are basically one-dimensional. Charlize Theron, who is quietly building a formidable reputation as a character actress, is striking as Gwen Sunday, a very interesting character who I wish had been on screen more often. An even more intriguing character is Carl's father, marvelously played by Carl Lumbly, but we see him for less than five minutes. If script writer Scott Marshall Smith had worked harder on making the main characters as interesting, Men of Honor would have been a much better movie.",2,Tepid script sinks bio pic.

According to the director, it was over 3 hours to begin with, and at 128 minutes, is still too long.  More focus on Brashear, and less on the fictional character Sunday, would have helped.I also caught one mistake in the courtroom scene--one does not salute indoors with a hat off (at least not in the Navy).  Snapping to &quot;Attention!&quot; would have been appropriate.In all, a tighter edit, and a more focused script would have helped.

Thanks, I enjoy my drama spoon-fed to me. This movie is for those who need not think during a movie. My wife and I, while watching the movie, were making fun of it by saying, &quot;One man...&quot; and &quot;Defies a system&quot; in our sarcastic &quot;trailor guy&quot; voice and unbeknownest to us, they had the trailors on the dvd and the &quot;trailor guy&quot; actually said those words! A very boring and predictable movie. At one point, you think the movie is actually over and as I joked to my wife by saying, &quot;three hours later,&quot; the movie actually went on for another hour. Another scene: While unrealistically cuba has to prove he can still be &quot;a navy diveman&quot; in a courtroom by wearing all of his gear and taking 12 steps in that gear or something like that, he is coached by Deniro each step by saying stuff like, &quot;ONE!&quot; &quot;That's because you're a navy diveman and that's what they do!&quot; &quot;Two!&quot; &quot;Only a navy diveman can... blah blah blah!&quot; and so on for each step Cuba takes while overly-dramatic music plays in the background. Yes, I know this movie was based on a true story, but the taking of artistic licsence went way too far for this movie. I think the real story would have been better by them filming the real guy talking about his story. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is typecast and this is the worst for him yet.

It truly is obstacle after obstacle on different levels so the hero is constantly trying to prove himself or get through something but there were enough lulls in between where it didn't feel like there was no breather room to appreciate his accomplishments. De Niro does an awesome job playing a reckless, know-it-all whose destructive behavior gets him into trouble after trouble, including when he tries to help Gooding's character pass the Navy Diver final exam amid rampant racism. Most of the supporting cast is good enough but a few are a notch or two below what one would expect. That said, this is a great film if you want a ""pick me up"" tale of someone with dogged determination who possesses a sympathetic background. The play off between Gooding and De Niro is quite good.

BUT when he entered the Navy blacks were only allowed in the kitchens.After coming to the attention of his CO, Brashear was given an opportunity to attend the school he really wanted to. He came face to face with Billy Sunday played by Robert DeNiro. In many ways Sunday wanted to see Brashear complete the course but his commander portrayed by Hal Holbrook tied his hands. Eventually Brashear was successful.As Brashear's career progressed, Sunday's fell apart. Then there was a terrible accident, which resulted in Brashear losing a leg. The Navy wanted to retire him but he fought to stay in. Sunday came to his aid and helped him recover from the amputation. He was by his side when Brashear had to go to court to fight for the right to stay in the Navy. The court scene was very moving.Yes there was a little romance in the movie and yes there was vulgarity but this film was very good.

531992,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,B00003CXPP,"O. Brown ""Ms. O. Khannah-Brown""","[6, 8]","*****This movie is the quintessential 5-star movie.  I read the reviews below and the editorials above and was surprised to find criticism; I disagree with all of it and can simply find nothing negative to say about ""Men of Honor"".I tried to remember the profanity that is mentioned in several reviews; I'm not sure if I have a different version, but I don't remember any profanity!  I'm sure there must have been some, but apparently it was so inobtrusive and fit in with the story so well that it passed me by.The movie is the true story of Carl Brashear, the first African American to become a Master Diver in the Navy.  It shows the terrible prejudice of the time (the 1950's and 1960's) in the military and the rest of our society. Carl Brashear was single-minded, totally focused, and struggled to achieve his goals, overcoming almost unbelievable adversity.I found the movie entertaining and inspiring.  I too was left wanting to know more about Carl Brashear and the military at this time.  Fortunately, my Special Edition of the movie included special features that included director's comments, a film introducing you to the real Carl Brashear, deleted scenes, and information about how the movie was made, etc.  If you are the type of person that enjoys these things, I would highly recommend this version.The acting was as good as I've seen, with Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Carl Brashear---they identical in real life (when you see the actual pictures of Carl Brashear at that age on the special features).  Robert DeNiro was outstanding, as was Hal Holbrook and the many other actors, including Charlie Therzon.  I disagree with one reviewer who said her character was ""extraneous""; her part was perfect and she played it perfectly, adding entertainment value and beauty to the movie.  Besides, the movie is not about her character, but about Carl Brashear, so although she is a movie star it would be inappropriate in this true story to give her a central role.The whole movie is quality, and gives you a quality experience watching it. It is very entertaining.

531999,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXPP,Reviewer,"[10, 12]","A dramatization of the life of Carl Brashear, the first African-American diver in the history of the U.S. Navy, ""Men Of Honor,"" directed by George Tillman, Jr., is an uncompromising examination of  personal courage, integrity and honor.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. portrays Brashear, a man of unabashed determination who simply would not be deterred from achieving his goal, even in the face of apparently insurmountable obstacles, the most prevalent of which was blatant racial discrimination.  As brutal and incomprehensible as it seems, there were those, including at least one high-ranking officer, who would rather have seen him die than pass diving school.  That he stayed with it, passed and went on, not only to an illustrious career with the Navy, but one in which his achievements were nothing less than remarkable, is a demonstration of heroics tantamount to those for which medals are awarded.  It's men like Brashear that should make veterans everywhere proud of their heritage as members of the Armed Forces.  Such a story is, of course, a natural for the movies; and, if done properly, has the makings of a great one.  And this one is.  Tillman tells the story of Brashear, the son of a Kentucky share cropper, in a decidedly straightforward manner, without pulling any punches as he illustrates the inane bigotry faced by the young seaman.  The heroics of the man speak for themselves, and Tillman wisely avoids any attempts at superfluous dramatic embellishments, the siren's song to which a lesser director may have succumbed, and which could so quickly have derailed this project.  Tillman's work more than passes muster, and his attention to detail, along with impeccable pace and timing, are a major factor in the success of this film.  It should land him an Oscar nomination.  Another factor is the incredible talent with which Tillman had to work.  Gooding embodies the qualities that made Brashear a hero, and it is through his outstandingly credible performance that we get to know this man.  There's a subtle pride in his demeanor, a personification of his determination, that brings him so vividly to life on the screen; it's an Oscar worthy piece of work that should be acknowledged by the Academy.  And Gooding had, not only a terrific role, but the best co-star with which an actor could hope to work.  Robert De Niro stars as Master Diver Billy Sunday, the adversary turned ally who ultimately helped Brashear realize his goals.  On the surface, Sunday is tough and pridefully simplistic; but underneath lies a complex individual that De Niro mines to full advantage.  Any time De Niro appears in a film, expectations are high, as well they should be; he is an actor of immeasurable talents.  And here, with his portrayal of Sunday, he scores another triumph.  It's a brilliant performance, for which he must be recognized with an Oscar nomination.  The outstanding supporting cast includes Charlize Theron (Gwen), Aunjanue Ellis (Jo), Hal Holbrook (Mr. Pappy), Michael Rapaport (Snowhill), Powers Boothe (Capt. Pullman), David Keith (Capt. Hartigan), Holt McCallany (Rourke), Joshua Leonard (Isert), Carl Lumbly (Mac, Carl's Father) and Lonette McKee (Ella, Carl's Mother).  ""Men Of Honor"" is a superb, memorable film that recognizes the kind of heroics that go largely unsung and too often unheralded.  That Tillman and this fine assemblage of actors have been able to illuminate the life of a man like Carl Brashear so fervently is a tribute to them as well as the Motion Picture Industry.  But more than that, it is a well deserved tribute to a true hero, Carl Brashear.

But believe me, it did: Horribly, Horribly Wrong. The performances reduced the characters to caricatures: The strong black man who succeeds in the face of adversity, the &quot;mean old&quot; racist drill sargeant with the southern accent, the drunken Southern belle with a heart of gold. Besides that, the situations were reduced to cliches. I know that Carl Brashear was a real person who was highly celebrated. I would never judge him as a human being, but a man who won so much acclaim must have had a life and a story much more interesting and nuanced than this movie reveals. What's more, I believe this movie makes him appear extremely unlikable. I am not sure whether the fault lies with the poor script or the performance, but the protagonist in this film seemed far too stubborn for his own good. ...  The reason this doesn't work however is that in a story of triumph such as this, you want your character to succeed against real threats of racism from real characters, not from a caricature.

532002,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXPP,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 12]","Nobody in his right mind would disagree with the noble sentiments that inform ""Men of Honor.""  Celebrating the virtues of courage, heroism and strength of character, as well as the triumph of the underdog over personal adversity and societal racism - who could argue against such inspiring themes and concepts?  As such, ""Men of Honor"" has the built-in potential to be a ""feel good"" triumph.  Unfortunately, the narrative arc that the film travels is so tediously predictable and familiar and the sentiment so heavy-handed and treacly that, much as we may want to like the movie, we find ourselves quickly annoyed and bored by it.This is no reflection on Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert De Niro, who do their best in two-dimensional, stereotypical roles.  But it IS a reflection on the screenplay by Scott Michael Smith, which, although it is based on the true story of one Carl Brashear, the first African American US Navy diver, nevertheless, plays like a hundred other films with similar scenarios.  ""Men of Honor"" just always ""feels"" like a MOVIE because we already know where it is going long before it gets there. So, essentially, we spend most of the time looking at our watches in the hopes that it will not take too long in completing its mission.The sappy concluding courtroom scene, in particular, has the word HOLLYWOOD stamped all over it - not helped one whit by the saccharine musical score that seems to ooze across the soundtrack from one end of the movie to the other.The movie does deal in a surprisingly frank way with the blatant racism that pervaded the military in the years immediately following Truman's forced integration of the forces.  But don't we just know that, despite all the hostility he faces, Brashear will prove himself to be the most courageous, most noble and most technically skilled diver around - easily showing up all the Doubting Thomases in the process, including the by-now-inevitable stock military villain who seems to have devoted his career to standing in the way of this one man's success and progress?  Brashear also turns out to be the most generous of spirit among the men in that he easily forgives the trespasses of those who trespass against him.  What can we in the audience do but wile away the time till all this happens?At first blush, De Niro's Leslie ""Billy"" Sunday, may seem to be a more complex character.  After all, he defies the military rules so much that even the Navy is forced to demote him to the position of training officer.  Yet, in a way, this is just the typical De Niro role - heavy on bluster, sarcasm and macho posturing, all merely hiding the sweet humanitarian and egalitarian lurking right below the brash surface.Even the underwater diving sequences, which turn out to be the primary reason for watching the film, seem strangely unimpressive.  I guess that a man standing almost perfectly still, encumbered by an awkward, heavy diving outfit, doesn't make for particularly exciting action cinema.It's also interesting that the film paints the Navy as consisting almost exclusively of unenlightened racists - then turns around and expects us to get all dewy-eyed and goosepimply when Brashear makes an impassioned speech defending it.""Men of Honor"" may be a wonderful film for adolescents to see, for those too young to understand fully just how pervasive racism was in our institutions a mere 40 or 50 years ago.  But for those of us who like our dramas a bit less tidy and a trifle more complex in nature, ""Men of Honor"" doesn't provide us with much to occupy our minds with for the duration of its running time - and precious little to think about after the movie is over.",2,sinks in sea of nobility,990835200,"05 26, 2001",2001,3655,"['Nobody', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'disagree', 'noble', 'sentiments', 'inform', 'Men', 'Honor', 'Celebrating', 'virtues', 'courage', 'heroism', 'strength', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'triumph', 'underdog', 'personal', 'adversity', 'societal', 'racism', 'who', 'could', 'argue', 'such', 'inspiring', 'themes', 'concepts', 'such', 'Men', 'Honor', 'built-in', 'potential', 'be', 'feel', 'good', 'triumph', 'Unfortunately', 'narrative', 'arc', 'film', 'travels', 'so', 'tediously', 'predictable', 'familiar', 'sentiment', 'so', 'heavy-handed', 'treacly', 'much', 'may', 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'find', 'quickly', 'annoyed', 'bored', 'it.This', 'reflection', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'do', 'best', 'two-dimensional', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'reflection', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'first', 'African', 'American', 'US', 'Navy', 'diver', 'nevertheless', 'plays', 'hundred', 'other', 'films', 'similar', 'scenarios', 'Men', 'Honor', 'just', 'always', 'feels', 'MOVIE', 'already', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'long', 'there', 'So', 'essentially', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'looking', 'watches', 'hopes', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'completing', 'mission.The', 'sappy', 'concluding', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'particular', 'word', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'stamped', 'not', 'helped', 'one', 'whit', 'saccharine', 'musical', 'score', 'ooze', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'end', 'movie', 'other.The', 'movie', 'deal', 'surprisingly', 'frank', 'way', 'blatant', 'racism', 'pervaded', 'military', 'years', 'immediately', 'following', 'Truman', 'forced', 'integration', 'forces', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'know', 'hostility', 'Brashear', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'most', 'courageous', 'most', 'noble', 'most', 'technically', 'skilled', 'diver', 'easily', 'showing', 'up', 'Doubting', 'Thomases', 'process', 'including', 'by-now-inevitable', 'stock', 'military', 'villain', 'who', 'have', 'devoted', 'career', 'standing', 'way', 'one', 'man', 'success', 'progress', 'Brashear', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'generous', 'spirit', 'men', 'easily', 'trespasses', 'who', 'trespass', 'What', 'can', 'audience', 'do', 'wile', 'away', 'time', 'till', 'first', 'blush', 'De', 'Niro', 'Leslie', 'Billy', 'Sunday', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'military', 'rules', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'Navy', 'forced', 'demote', 'position', 'training', 'officer', 'way', 'just', 'typical', 'De', 'Niro', 'role', 'heavy', 'bluster', 'sarcasm', 'macho', 'posturing', 'merely', 'hiding', 'sweet', 'humanitarian', 'egalitarian', 'lurking', 'right', 'brash', 'surface.Even', 'underwater', 'diving', 'sequences', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'primary', 'reason', 'watching', 'film', 'seem', 'strangely', 'unimpressive', 'guess', 'man', 'standing', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'still', 'encumbered', 'awkward', 'heavy', 'diving', 'outfit', ""n't"", 'make', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'action', 'cinema.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'film', 'Navy', 'consisting', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'unenlightened', 'racists', 'then', 'around', 'get', 'dewy-eyed', 'goosepimply', 'when', 'Brashear', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'defending', 'Men', 'Honor', 'may', 'be', 'wonderful', 'film', 'adolescents', 'see', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'fully', 'just', 'how', 'pervasive', 'racism', 'was', 'institutions', 'mere', '40', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'dramas', 'bit', 'less', 'tidy', 'trifle', 'more', 'complex', 'nature', 'Men', 'Honor', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'occupy', 'minds', 'duration', 'running', 'time', 'precious', 'little', 'think', 'movie']",N/A

Bauer,"[0, 0]","Men of Honor is a drama about the first African-American and first amputee to become a master diver in the United States Navy and the obstacles he had to overcome to get there.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a young black man with a ironclad self-discipline and a mountain of self-respect who comes from a dirt-poor farm in the south.  He has a great desire to succeed and prove himself and not follow in his father's footsteps as a farmer, so he joins the Navy.  Robert De Niro plays the role of the man who trains him.  He is a Navy lifer, an old, hostile, alcoholic misfit who can't do anything else.  His only self-esteem comes from being a Navy master diver.Set during the time period of the late 1950's through the 1960's, the movie was inspired by the true-life story of Carl Brashear.  The story, acting and cinematography are excellent, with just enough action and suspense to add up to excellent entertainment value.  Hal Holbrook plays an extremely racist senior officer.  Charlize Theron (The Legend of Bagger Vance) plays De Niro's wife.  Aunjamue Ellis plays Carl's wife, Jo, a medical doctor.  The only flaw I can see in the film is that De Niro acts out such a demonstrative, volatile, and angry character that it takes all the attention away from the cool, calm, self-controlled character played by Cuba Gooding Jr.",4,Good Drama,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,1325,"['Men', 'Honor', 'drama', 'first', 'African-American', 'first', 'amputee', 'become', 'master', 'diver', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'obstacles', 'had', 'overcome', 'get', 'there', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'ironclad', 'self-discipline', 'mountain', 'self-respect', 'who', 'dirt-poor', 'farm', 'south', 'great', 'desire', 'succeed', 'prove', 'not', 'follow', 'father', 'footsteps', 'farmer', 'Navy', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'Navy', 'lifer', 'old', 'hostile', 'alcoholic', 'misfit', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'only', 'self-esteem', 'being', 'Navy', 'master', 'diver.Set', 'time', 'period', 'late', '1950', '1960', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'true-life', 'story', 'Carl', 'Brashear', 'story', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'just', 'enough', 'action', 'suspense', 'add', 'up', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'extremely', 'racist', 'senior', 'officer', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'De', 'Niro', 'wife', 'Aunjamue', 'Ellis', 'Carl', 'wife', 'Jo', 'medical', 'doctor', 'only', 'flaw', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'De', 'Niro', 'out', 'such', 'demonstrative', 'volatile', 'angry', 'character', 'attention', 'away', 'cool', 'calm', 'self-controlled', 'character', 'played', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr']",N/A
532011,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00003CXPP,Steve Douglas,"[2, 2]","I have always loved this film.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is a highly underrated and under used actor and Robert DeNiro gives a performance here that is more than a mere caricature of his wise guy films over the last few years.  I have had the standard definition DVD of  Men of Honor , the Special Edition, for some time.  A fine DVD and I looked forward to even better with the Blu ray version.  On blu ray, the video transfer is fine with no artifacting, showing deep details in the shadow scenes and excellent coloration.  The audio tends to be a bit inconsistent.  The audio will definitely give your sub woofer a workout in some of the underwater scenes, especially when the practice ship shifts on its ledge as well as when Carl's line is caught up by the Soviet's sub.  It is during these scenes that the surrounds, both front and back, as well as the sub really come to life and pop. However, there are many other scenes where there is little use made of the surrounds when they well should have.Often the extras on a DVD are audio commentary, trailers, ads for other films and, if you're lucky, a deleted scene or two.  However, the standard special edition DVD of Men of Honor was filled with many excellent deleted scenes as well as commentary for why they were deleted.  This included a heart breaking scene where a dog is cleansed with lime because Cuba Gooding's character had touched the dog.  The explanation for its deletion was included as well as many other extras.However, the Blu Ray version of Men of Honor leaves out all these wonderful and valuable extras.  All you get is the audio commentary and trailer.  Additionally included is some sort of pop up trivia which you can set to come up as the movie plays but no individual interviews with the actors, no commentary by Carl Breshire himself, no deleted scenes.  You get just the initial theatrical release and thats it.  So for me, this 5 star film only gets 3 stars as a blu ray, thus my average of 4 stars.  I will be keeping both the standard and blu ray editions as the extras on the standard really were excellent.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Men of Honor on Blu Ray...not your dad's special edition DVD,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,2428,"['have', 'always', 'loved', 'film', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'highly', 'underrated', 'used', 'actor', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'performance', 'here', 'more', 'mere', 'caricature', 'wise', 'guy', 'films', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVD', 'Men', 'Honor', 'Special', 'Edition', 'time', 'fine', 'DVD', 'looked', 'forward', 'even', 'better', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'blu', 'ray', 'video', 'transfer', 'fine', 'artifacting', 'showing', 'deep', 'details', 'shadow', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'coloration', 'audio', 'tends', 'be', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'audio', 'will', 'definitely', 'give', 'sub', 'woofer', 'workout', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'practice', 'ship', 'shifts', 'ledge', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'Carl', 'line', 'caught', 'up', 'Soviet', 'sub', 'scenes', 'surrounds', 'front', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'sub', 'really', 'come', 'life', 'pop', 'However', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'scenes', 'where', 'little', 'use', 'made', 'surrounds', 'when', 'well', 'should', 'have.Often', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailers', 'ads', 'other', 'films', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'deleted', 'scene', 'two', 'However', 'standard', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Men', 'Honor', 'was', 'filled', 'many', 'excellent', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'included', 'heart', 'breaking', 'scene', 'where', 'dog', 'cleansed', 'lime', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'character', 'had', 'touched', 'dog', 'explanation', 'deletion', 'was', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'extras.However', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'Men', 'Honor', 'out', 'wonderful', 'valuable', 'extras', 'get', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailer', 'Additionally', 'included', 'sort', 'pop', 'up', 'trivia', 'can', 'set', 'come', 'up', 'movie', 'plays', 'individual', 'interviews', 'actors', 'commentary', 'Carl', 'Breshire', 'no', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'just', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'thats', 'So', '5', 'star', 'film', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'blu', 'ray', 'thus', 'average', '4', 'stars', 'will', 'be', 'keeping', 'standard', 'blu', 'ray', 'editions', 'extras', 'standard', 'really', 'were', 'excellent.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

This movie proves that you do not need a big budget to make a great movie.",5,Personification of Grit and Determination,1022284800,"05 25, 2002",2002,629,"['movie', 'full', 'character', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'done', 'justice', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'indeed', 'role', 'small', 'town', 'guy', 'trying', 'defy', 'odds', 'be', 'first', 'black', 'US', 'naval', 'history', 'be', 'master', 'diver', 'Robert', 'Niro', 'superb', 'usual.After', 'will', 'dream', 'story', 'shaping', 'destiny', 'odds.An', 'excellent', 'movie', 'show', 'kids', 'movies', 'character', 'are', 'fashion', 'days', 'movies', 'lot', 'special', 'FX', 'sound', 'effects', 'lacking', 'substance', 'are', 'sadly', 'thing', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'big', 'budget', 'make', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

Marshall,"[0, 1]","I agree with Jeff Shannon's review, if this didn't have so much adult language it would have been a great and inspiring film (even with the cliches).  But we're left with an R rated film that lot's of kids will miss out on simply because of the language!  Superb performances by both actor's though!!!",3,Could have been better!,992563200,"06 15, 2001",2001,301,"['agree', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'much', 'adult', 'language', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'inspiring', 'film', 'even', 'cliches', ""'re"", 'left', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'lot', 'kids', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'simply', 'language', 'Superb', 'performances', 'actor']",N/A
