500743,A3KUP8IQ3JMS0P,B00000G02H,Acid,"[2, 2]","I remember reading that P.T. Anderson was trying to make a conventional Adam Sandler comedy through his own looking glass. That pretty much sums it up. Sandler's character is a tragi-comic, realistic version of every character he had ever played up to this point: a stunted, almost retarded man-child with a loving heart and uncontrollable fits of violence. Whereas in a standard Sandler film, the jokes would be played for cheap (very, very cheap) laughs and you would be expected to fall for , and root for, the character from the start, P.T. does nothing of the sort. The humor is of the uncomfortable variety, the love story is at times touching, at other times sad and even disturbing. There is an artificialty to everything; a very trippy, psychedlic feel to everything, meant, I'm sure, to indicate the mental state of Sandler's mildly insane character. It was an absolute blast watching this movie on opening weekend with all of the Adam Sandler fans who expected another 2 hours of brainless, thoughtless potty humor.This movie speaks volumes to me, as my own brother is VERY similar to Sandler's character in almost all regards. His character is a lot more realistic than most viewers would care to admit.A wonderfully quirky, unique film.",4,A different take on Adam Sandler comedies,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,1249,"['remember', 'reading', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'conventional', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'comedy', 'own', 'looking', 'glass', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'Sandler', 'character', 'tragi-comic', 'realistic', 'version', 'character', 'had', 'ever', 'played', 'up', 'point', 'stunted', 'almost', 'retarded', 'man-child', 'loving', 'heart', 'uncontrollable', 'fits', 'violence', 'Whereas', 'standard', 'Sandler', 'film', 'jokes', 'would', 'be', 'played', 'cheap', 'very', 'very', 'cheap', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'fall', 'root', 'character', 'start', 'P.T', 'nothing', 'sort', 'humor', 'uncomfortable', 'variety', 'love', 'story', 'times', 'touching', 'other', 'times', 'sad', 'even', 'disturbing', 'artificialty', 'everything', 'very', 'trippy', 'psychedlic', 'feel', 'everything', 'meant', ""'m"", 'sure', 'indicate', 'mental', 'state', 'Sandler', 'mildly', 'insane', 'character', 'was', 'absolute', 'blast', 'watching', 'movie', 'opening', 'weekend', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'who', 'expected', '2', 'hours', 'brainless', 'thoughtless', 'potty', 'humor.This', 'movie', 'volumes', 'own', 'brother', 'VERY', 'similar', 'Sandler', 'character', 'almost', 'regards', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'care', 'admit.A', 'wonderfully', 'quirky', 'unique', 'film']",Punch-Drunk Love
500744,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00000G02H,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Summary:Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is an entrepreneurial businessman with some very serious psychological issues stemming from years of abuse/torment from his sisters.  Despite the problems he seems to be making a go of life with a growing business and a stunning blue suit (you have to watch the movie to get that joke), but things are about to change.  Feeling lonely he calls a 900 phone sex service on the eve of finding the love of his life, Lena Leonard (Emily Watson).  When he calls the phone service he is tricked into giving them all sorts of information by which they can extort money from him.  Initially he is willing to pay, but when their bullying tactics injure Lena, with whom he has developed a very unique relationship, it's time for the bullying to end.  Channeling his psychological rage, Barry convinces the thugs and the ring leader to call it off in order for him to pursue his budding relationship with Lena.My Comments:In reading over my summary I'm kind of surprised that the plot is actually is simple as I made it out to be.  The movie isn't that short and definitely doesn't seem to be this simple when you are watching it, but that is mostly due to the numerous sidetracks that the story takes, like Barry buying several thousand dollars worth of pudding to get a million frequent flyer miles or his stealing of a Harmonium that is dumped on the side of a street for no known reason.  In reality, none of these tangents really influence the story, they just develop Barry as a character.So, how is the story?  It's pretty good.  There weren't any noticeable plot holes and given the leeway that psychologically disturbed characters demand, the story made logical sense.  I found it to be both intriguing and funny, though there were some slow spots.What about the acting?  I thought it was also pretty good.  I can't really think of any actors that stood out as being particularly bad or just mediocre; they all gave fairly convincing performances.So why not five stars?  Well, it was just strange, that's all.  Perhaps over time the idea and story will grow on me and I'll change my mind, but for now I'm still trying to figure it all out.  If you like Adam Sandler, you'll probably be a bit surprised as he seems to be trying to branch out from his traditional role into something a bit different; but I think you'll still enjoy this movie.

500746,A14B73GG8OFXKH,B00000G02H,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I have enjoyed all of P.T. Anderson's movies, but I suspect that I am in the minority in that I tend to prefer those that are less stylized.  I thought Magnolia was very good, but not as good as Boogie Nights or Hard Eight.  Punch-Drunk Love, however, is my favorite so far, even though it is the most stylized effort to date.  But the style here functions to demonstrate Barry's delusional mindset.The style of this film is best characterized as hyper-realism.  It is so realistic that it is beyond believable; it is a ""strange loop"" of realism, where the realism exceeds the scale and returns to the bottom, where it is no longer realistic.  It is very effective at helping the viewer gain insight into Barry's thought process. The hazy shots imply a clouded state of mind.  The abrupt violence exactly mirrors Barry's spontaneous outburts.  The beginning of the film demonstrates what should be Barry's mantra: ""Storm before the calm"" -- the seemingly irrelevant car crash followed by the discovery of the ""piano"" which Barry would use to futiley attempt to reduce his frustrations.Barry's violent nature is at once totally ridiculous and completely believable.  Similarly, it is contemptable and pitiable. One might even say forgiveable. Maybe even loveable.  Because, as we watch this helpless, unloved, lonely lad try to do his best, he is constantly battered down by those for whom he would give his life.I think Anderson's intention with this film was to visually illustrate mental illness.  It works in every way; it gives the audience a first-person perspective on paranoia, delusion, and depression, while being compassionate enough to allow Barry to be a worthwhile hero.  (You will certainly cheer for him when he uses the crowbar.. you'll see what I mean)It would be easy to criticize parts of the narrative of this film -- but mainly because it is not realistic, and this would be a moot argument since the film is set in a not-so-realistic world.  The narrative works fine when put into the context of a dream-world, fantasy, or delusion.Obviously, this is Sandler's best film to date.  He didn't have to stretch too far to get into character (he's always somewhat self-loathing and violent); however, to his credit, he employed subtely for the first time in his career and found an excellent balance between comic and tragic.  I look forward to seeing him continue in his dramatic development.Guzman and Watson are great, although somewhat static.  They're well-cast and help to exaggerate Barry's eccentricity.Best Anderson movie yet; one of the best films of the year.",5,Sandler + Anderson = ummm... better than magnolia!,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,2587,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'suspect', 'am', 'minority', 'tend', 'prefer', 'are', 'less', 'stylized', 'thought', 'Magnolia', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Hard', 'Eight', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'however', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'even', 'most', 'stylized', 'effort', 'date', 'style', 'here', 'functions', 'demonstrate', 'Barry', 'delusional', 'mindset.The', 'style', 'film', 'best', 'characterized', 'hyper-realism', 'so', 'realistic', 'believable', 'strange', 'loop', 'realism', 'where', 'realism', 'scale', 'returns', 'bottom', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'realistic', 'very', 'effective', 'helping', 'viewer', 'gain', 'insight', 'Barry', 'thought', 'process', 'hazy', 'shots', 'imply', 'clouded', 'state', 'mind', 'abrupt', 'violence', 'exactly', 'Barry', 'spontaneous', 'outburts', 'beginning', 'film', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Barry', 'mantra', 'Storm', 'calm', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'car', 'crash', 'followed', 'discovery', 'piano', 'Barry', 'would', 'use', 'futiley', 'attempt', 'reduce', 'frustrations.Barry', 'violent', 'nature', 'once', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'completely', 'believable', 'Similarly', 'contemptable', 'pitiable', 'One', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'forgiveable', 'Maybe', 'even', 'loveable', 'watch', 'helpless', 'unloved', 'lonely', 'lad', 'try', 'do', 'best', 'constantly', 'battered', 'down', 'whom', 'would', 'give', 'life.I', 'think', 'Anderson', 'intention', 'film', 'was', 'visually', 'illustrate', 'mental', 'illness', 'way', 'audience', 'first-person', 'perspective', 'paranoia', 'delusion', 'depression', 'being', 'compassionate', 'enough', 'allow', 'Barry', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'hero', 'will', 'certainly', 'cheer', 'when', 'crowbar..', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'criticize', 'parts', 'narrative', 'film', 'mainly', 'not', 'realistic', 'would', 'be', 'moot', 'argument', 'film', 'set', 'not-so-realistic', 'world', 'narrative', 'works', 'fine', 'when', 'put', 'context', 'dream-world', 'fantasy', 'delusion.Obviously', 'Sandler', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'stretch', 'too', 'far', 'get', 'character', 'always', 'somewhat', 'self-loathing', 'violent', 'however', 'credit', 'employed', 'subtely', 'first', 'time', 'career', 'found', 'excellent', 'balance', 'comic', 'tragic', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'continue', 'dramatic', 'development.Guzman', 'Watson', 'are', 'great', 'somewhat', 'static', ""'re"", 'well-cast', 'help', 'exaggerate', 'Barry', 'eccentricity.Best', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'yet', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year']",Punch-Drunk Love

That's why my experience with this movie was so weird for me. I loved Adam Sandler in the movie but, in the end, the movie was totally let down by the story. Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a self employed business man who seems to be socially challenged (as well as fashion challenged) with 7 sisters and no brothers. It seems that he has been teased all of his life by his sisters and, as a result of this endless torment, he has depression issues as well as connection issues. Feeling lonely and vulnerable one night, he calls a sex line for some conversation and eventual release. Unfortunately for him, the sex line is run by a guy who black mails and extorts money from his ""more well off"" customers by threatening to reveal their ""perverted"" calls to the people around them (wives, girlfriends and business colleges). Barry, who seems to be a broken man; week and lifeless, meets a young lady named Lena Leonard, played by Emily Watson, through the help of one of his sisters. Emily becomes the woman of his dreams! Barry finds himself trying to win over Lena and at the same time hide from her the sex call debacle and to clear up any embarrassing things that his sisters might have said to her about him. It turns out that Lena (who is a little quirky herself) is the ideal woman for him and gives him a strength that he has never known. She is the catalyst that propels him from his inner prison. In theory this movie has allot to work with to make a great dark comedy, but in the end, it falls short. Adam Sandler really plays himself in this movie, but with a more serious approach, and I really enjoyed his performance. What I didn't like in this movie was some of the ""artsy visuals"" that were thrown in. For example, I'm still trying to figure out why a van filled with shady looking characters pull up, screeching, to his work parking lot and drop off a miniature piano!? In Magnolia these weird visuals worked, like in the end when it started to rain frogs. This represented one of the biblical plagues on man that God would put upon us when we are at our worst. I don't get the miniature piano reference, except they needed a way to introduce the piano because he (Adam Sandler) pays so much attention to it through out the movie. A garage sale purchase would have sufficed! Also, the Superbit release is a little bit of a mystery to me. The colors and sounds didn't seem, to me, to need a premium release.

500750,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000G02H,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I know that my `three stars' may seem a little low, especially when you're done reading my review, but I thought long and hard about this and feel that it is legit.  The thing is, the movie, while entertaining and in parts truly amazing, has a very weak link that won't seem to let it rest; the script.  Despite the fact that the acting is mostly top notch and at times surprisingly exhilarating, and despite the fact that it is marvelously directed (this is one of Paul Thomas Anderson's most intriguing and visually engaging works), the script has so many unfinished areas that it proves to be this otherwise rewarding films Achilles heal.The film follows Barry Egan; a introverted man-child prone to fits of anger and completely unable to find root in his home life.  He has a slew of demanding, oppressive and `far too concerned' sisters and he has a self-owned business he isn't quite capable of handling.  When he makes the mistake of seeking intimacy over the telephone he opens himself up to an extortion scheme that places him, and his newfound romantic interest, in physical danger.The acting here is actually very good, and I was anticipating an excruciating transition from Sandler.  I was pleasantly surprised to find him take his usual shtick and transform it into a very mature performance with much ease.  He seemed a natural actually.  He's aided by the mesmerizing Emily Watson (such a stunning talent) and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who takes his usual abrasive persona to the bank with this one.  There is rarely a sour note expressed by anyone in the cast, for even the `barely there' but parts are played with a surreal sense of authenticity.No one in the cast is anywhere near as profound as Paul Thomas Anderson though.  His direction is beyond flawless.  It is a true testament to his talent that he could take this script (which he also happened to pen), which was just missing so much, and make it as engaging as it is.  Visually, `Punch-Drunk Love' is just that.Honestly, one of the best directorial achievements of the decade.The script though, cannot be ignored.  It is the black smudge resting on the otherwise pristinely white page.  It tries too hard, or maybe too little, to be too many things at once and thus comes off rather unfocused and almost lazy in areas.  Its concern with involving the separate plot points would have been more affective had they been completely fleshed out.  Instead it tends to pick up and put down too easily.  I like the general idea here, I just think that PTA was struggling to put it all together in a way that made sense without being too overbearing and he wound up with something that was rather underwhelming.Thankfully he adds enough flair into each frame to make up for the lack of substance.In the end I can recommend this movie without hesitation.  Despite my lower rating I still feel that this is a good film and one that can and will be enjoyed.  Truth be told though, no film can truly succeed without a script that works.  This is proof of that, for even though EVERYTHING else is in the right place, the lackluster writing makes this film so much less than perfect.",3,Visually it lives up to its name; but it could have used a little fine-tuning below the surface...,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,3144,"['know', 'three', 'stars', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'low', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'reading', 'review', 'thought', 'long', 'hard', 'feel', 'legit', 'thing', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'truly', 'amazing', 'very', 'weak', 'link', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'let', 'rest', 'script', 'fact', 'acting', 'mostly', 'top', 'notch', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'exhilarating', 'fact', 'marvelously', 'directed', 'one', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'most', 'intriguing', 'visually', 'engaging', 'works', 'script', 'so', 'many', 'unfinished', 'areas', 'be', 'otherwise', 'rewarding', 'films', 'Achilles', 'heal.The', 'film', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'introverted', 'man-child', 'prone', 'fits', 'anger', 'completely', 'unable', 'find', 'root', 'home', 'life', 'slew', 'demanding', 'oppressive', 'far', 'too', 'concerned', 'sisters', 'self-owned', 'business', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capable', 'handling', 'When', 'mistake', 'seeking', 'intimacy', 'telephone', 'up', 'extortion', 'scheme', 'newfound', 'romantic', 'interest', 'physical', 'danger.The', 'acting', 'here', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'anticipating', 'excruciating', 'transition', 'Sandler', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'take', 'usual', 'shtick', 'transform', 'very', 'mature', 'performance', 'much', 'ease', 'seemed', 'natural', 'actually', 'aided', 'mesmerizing', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'such', 'stunning', 'talent', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'usual', 'abrasive', 'persona', 'bank', 'one', 'rarely', 'sour', 'note', 'expressed', 'anyone', 'cast', 'even', 'barely', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'surreal', 'sense', 'authenticity.No', 'one', 'cast', 'anywhere', 'near', 'as', 'profound', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'direction', 'flawless', 'true', 'testament', 'talent', 'could', 'take', 'script', 'also', 'happened', 'pen', 'was', 'just', 'missing', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'as', 'engaging', 'Visually', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'just', 'that.Honestly', 'one', 'best', 'directorial', 'achievements', 'decade.The', 'script', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'black', 'smudge', 'resting', 'otherwise', 'pristinely', 'white', 'page', 'too', 'hard', 'maybe', 'too', 'little', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'thus', 'off', 'rather', 'unfocused', 'almost', 'lazy', 'areas', 'concern', 'involving', 'separate', 'plot', 'points', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'affective', 'had', 'been', 'completely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Instead', 'pick', 'up', 'put', 'down', 'too', 'easily', 'general', 'idea', 'here', 'just', 'think', 'PTA', 'was', 'struggling', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'made', 'sense', 'being', 'too', 'overbearing', 'wound', 'up', 'something', 'was', 'rather', 'underwhelming.Thankfully', 'enough', 'flair', 'frame', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'substance.In', 'end', 'can', 'recommend', 'movie', 'hesitation', 'lower', 'rating', 'still', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'film', 'can', 'truly', 'succeed', 'script', 'proof', 'even', 'EVERYTHING', 'else', 'right', 'place', 'lackluster', 'writing', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'perfect']",Punch-Drunk Love

He's also responsible for the ensenble dramaMAGNOLIA(1999) andTHERE WILL BE BLOOD(2007), an adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!that stars Daniel Day-Lewis.This is a surprisingly good drama about Barry Egan, an eccentrically shy nebbish of a mattress shop owner whose seven yente sisters manage to keep him single by interfering in his personal life.Barry discovers a loophole in a food promotion campaign that allows him to amass a million Frequent Flyer miles by purchasing 3K worth of pudding. Thus, his warehouse is stacked with cases of Healthy Choice pudding.One night, he makes the mistake of his life by dialing a phone sex line. The crooks on the other end keep charging Barry's credit card until he cancels it. After he refuses to reactivate the card and up its credit limit, four thug brothers are sent by blackmailing phone service owner Hoffman. They accost him and girlfriend Lena.Barry reacts coolly yet violently by quickly beating down all four of them. It's a startling moment, particularly because one can't imagine this little man having such fearsome strength. Barry himself explains it: ""I have a love in my life. It makes me stronger than anything you can imagine.""This arty little film contains some of Sandler's best work. Watson is quite good as his girlfriend. Hoffman shines as the villain.

It was refreshing to see Adam Sandler play against his usual types of characters, and play a sweet, meek, insecure man who is looking for something in life.  He finds it in an alluring woman who knew one of his sisters.  Their budding relationship is interrupted by a visit from the cronies of a phone sex company trying to extort money from him.  My wife could not stay awake through he film and just said it was boring, and I tended to agree with her. However when Barry makes the call to the phone sex line, the movie picks up and gains momentum.  Anderson uses some filming techniques that do not really add anything to the film for me. he likes to experiment with colors and scenes are separated by Scopitones, I could have done without both. I think Anderson could have worked a little more on the story than on visual feel.  The way a movie looks can add to it greatly, but when it becomes obvious that the filmmaker seems to be sacrificing story and character development for artistic creation with a camera, the movie suffers.About the DVD: On the extra disc you get a special called Blossoms and Blood, which may as well be called Deleted Scenes. With extra artwork, three theatrical trailers and actual deleted scenes, the extras on the DVD flesh out the characters a little more making the actual film a little more enjoyable, but not much. However, true to PT Anderson's history, this DVD is missing a commentary track.

Sure, Adam Sandler is responsible for some of the dumbest comedies of recent times; but he's also done some very good ones- THE WEDDING SINGER, ANGER MANAGEMENT & 50 FIRST DATES as a case in point.  Then there's the Rob Schneider comedies Sandler co-produced.  And admittedly THE WATERBOY & HAPPY GILMORE were stupid but still reasonably enjoyable- plus there was the added incentive of ogling Fairuza Balk and  Julie Bowen.- here we have Emily Watson but ..... More on that later.I also had high expectations for the movie when I saw Paul Thomas Anderson's name on the credits as director.  BOOGIE NIGHTS was excellent and MAGNOLIA was very good (if half an hour overlong).  Anderson managed to elicit a brilliant performance from Tom Cruise, and the climax with the plague of raining frogs ranks in my opinion as one of the coolest moments in recent cinema.  Ingenious.Now Anderson has given the world PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.  What can I say, except when I subjected myself to PUNCH DRUNK LOVE I was STONE COLD SOBER.Sandler plays Barry Egen; a nave, shy, sheltered young man whose life is dominated by his seven highly dysfunctional sisters who would drive any guy mad.  Even Ron Jeremy and Randy West would be struggling to crawl out from under them, giving a frenetic ""time-out"" sign.  Folks, this is The Brady Bunch as envisaged by Robert Crumb, with artistic pretension substituting for the laughs.At heart a kind, but lost and lonely soul, Barry has previously looked for companionship by calling phone sex hotlines - the women in question taking full advantage of his naivety and conning him into giving them his personal details and social security number, ending with Barry willingly allowing money to be extorted from him.  Poor schmuck.But one day while working his dead-end warehouse job Barry finds himself struck by Cupid's Arrow when he lays eyes on the lovely Lena Leonard (played by the incredibly cute Emily Watson, who sadly is utterly wasted here).  It turns out for some reason that Lena likes him a lot too, but the socially awkward Barry doesn't know how to build on their attraction.  In time they have their first date and slowly but surely; love blossoms.Now, I'll admit that I don't mind the occasional love story if there's a good story or an interesting angle to it (e.g.: THE GRADUATE, SUMMER OF '42, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3- seriously!) but words almost fail me when it comes to describing this movie.  The picture has a bright, chirpy look about it but its tone is very bland.  It had the potential to be a good movie but Anderson's self indulgence swallows everything up and the result amounts to nothing more than 90 minutes of wasted time.However, every cloud has a silver lining, however brief, and here is some amusing dialogue from the love scene:Watson:  ""I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it coz it's so f***in' cute.""Sandler:  ""I'm looking at your face and I just wanna smash it- I just wanna f***in smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze, you're so pretty.""Watson:  ""I wanna chew your face and I wanna scoop out your eyes and I wanna eat them and suck on them.""Sandler: ""OK"" [pause] ""This is funny.""

I remember him from when he was on REMOTE CONTROL when I was 12. I remember him when he started on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, and I loved his skit there called THE DENISE SHOW, where a dumped, depressed guy uses a cable access program as an excuse to stalk his ex-girlfriend. P.T. Anderson, I noticed from interviews, remembered Sandler from THE DENISE SHOW, too, and made this movie with the complexities and sadness that character in mind.All the rage (not range) that Sandler showed in films like THE WEDDING SINGER, which at times was smart and good, or THE WATERBOY, which at times was dumb and good, is on display in PUNCH-DRUNK, but Sandler's character, Barry Egan, is more awkward than goofy. He's shy, damaged, browbeaten. In his words, he ""doesn't like himself very much sometimes.""In the role, Sandler's able to maintain his character's oddness, manic temper (complete with fits of violence) and essential goodness, generating sympathy and care even when he does things like call a phone-sex line or destroy a restaurant bathroom.As I've watched more Paul Thomas Anderson films in an attempt to better understand them (for MAGNOLIA frequently left me baffled and confused), I've come to appreciate some recurring elements: twists of fate that inject magic into everyday life, characters that exist only to forgive and love the damaged characters and random, off-the-wall dialogue and plot twists.PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE has these. Its hokiness, for it is a somewhat-formula romantic comedy, is redeemed by these elements.Lena Leonard, played by Emily Watson, is the character whose sole purpose in the film is to unconditionally love Barry Egan. The character isn't as clearly defined or quirky as Sandler's because she exists for a sole purpose, to save Egan from himself, to teach him how to hold relationships with others, to trust others, because she almost instinctively understands that he's been hurt a lot and hasn't really deserved it.The arrival of Leonard in Barry's life coincides with the arrival, as well, of a harmonium on his doorstep. The harmonium, one of those air-organ type instruments, shows up by complete chance, and its arrival, strangely, initially frightens Barry. Yet, as he comes to accept it and learns how to play it, everything else in Barry's life comes into order.I loved this movie so much that I wanted to give it a hug. It's not laugh-out-loud funny. It probably won't appeal to a lot of people. Some people may find it too off-the-wall. Others may just not get it.But I embrace any film that understands its themes clearly, knows what it's trying to say and says just that. I don't even mind a happy ending if a film earns it.Through accepting that goodness and magic does occur in the world and that the world isn't all hurt, Barry Egan is able to accept that there is goodness inside him and that he deserves love.I thought that was pretty great.",5,"Everyone, no matter how damaged, deserves love.",1040169600,"12 18, 2002",2002,3150,"['Saturday', 'saw', 'one', 'most', 'obscure', 'bizarre', 'different', 'ultimately', 'conventional', 'rewarding', 'films', 'have', 'recommend', 'you.It', 'Adam', 'Sandler-Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'PUNCH-DRUNK', 'LOVE.Usually', 'Adam', 'Sandler', ""'m"", 'fence', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'REMOTE', 'CONTROL', 'when', 'was', '12', 'remember', 'when', 'started', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'loved', 'skit', 'there', 'called', 'THE', 'DENISE', 'SHOW', 'where', 'dumped', 'depressed', 'guy', 'cable', 'access', 'program', 'excuse', 'stalk', 'ex-girlfriend', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'noticed', 'interviews', 'remembered', 'Sandler', 'THE', 'DENISE', 'SHOW', 'too', 'made', 'movie', 'complexities', 'sadness', 'character', 'rage', 'not', 'range', 'Sandler', 'showed', 'films', 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'SINGER', 'times', 'was', 'smart', 'good', 'THE', 'WATERBOY', 'times', 'was', 'dumb', 'good', 'display', 'PUNCH-DRUNK', 'Sandler', 'character', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'more', 'awkward', 'goofy', 'shy', 'damaged', 'browbeaten', 'words', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'sometimes', 'role', 'Sandler', 'able', 'maintain', 'character', 'oddness', 'manic', 'temper', 'complete', 'fits', 'violence', 'essential', 'goodness', 'generating', 'sympathy', 'care', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'call', 'phone-sex', 'line', 'destroy', 'restaurant', 'bathroom.As', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'more', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'films', 'attempt', 'better', 'understand', 'MAGNOLIA', 'frequently', 'left', 'baffled', 'confused', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'recurring', 'elements', 'twists', 'fate', 'inject', 'magic', 'everyday', 'life', 'characters', 'exist', 'only', 'forgive', 'love', 'damaged', 'characters', 'random', 'off-the-wall', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'twists.PUNCH-DRUNK', 'LOVE', 'hokiness', 'somewhat-formula', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'redeemed', 'elements.Lena', 'Leonard', 'played', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'character', 'sole', 'purpose', 'film', 'unconditionally', 'love', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'character', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'defined', 'quirky', 'Sandler', 'sole', 'purpose', 'save', 'Egan', 'teach', 'how', 'hold', 'relationships', 'others', 'trust', 'others', 'almost', 'instinctively', 'been', 'hurt', 'lot', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserved', 'it.The', 'arrival', 'Leonard', 'Barry', 'life', 'coincides', 'arrival', 'as', 'well', 'harmonium', 'doorstep', 'harmonium', 'one', 'air-organ', 'type', 'instruments', 'up', 'complete', 'chance', 'arrival', 'strangely', 'initially', 'Barry', 'Yet', 'accept', 'how', 'play', 'everything', 'else', 'Barry', 'life', 'order.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'give', 'hug', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'lot', 'people', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'off-the-wall', 'Others', 'may', 'just', 'not', 'get', 'it.But', 'embrace', 'film', 'themes', 'clearly', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'accepting', 'goodness', 'magic', 'occur', 'world', 'world', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'able', 'accept', 'goodness', 'love.I', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'great']",Punch-Drunk Love
500759,A1S0B6U13Y0F6N,B00000G02H,"Ben Parker ""Cheshire""","[2, 5]","I finally saw Punch-Drunk Love, and it was everything i was expecting and more. I been waiting half a year now - b.c i missed the theatre release, and have finally seen it on DVD. I wanted to see it since i heard a radio review of it calling it a romantic comedy on the edge and a movie like none you've ever seen before, and of course, that P.T Anderson had made his first movie after magnolia, and that he'd given himself the project of making Adam Sandler into a respectable actor - and if not for Anger Management coming out at the same time, and the mass populace going to see that instead of this due to the macro millions those producers shelled out on advertising, this would have totally done it for him. I'm just bitter that in central hollywood more money is spent advertising a picture than making the picture itself - so how can artists like P.T Anderson compete? Ppl judge the quality of a movie by how much they've heard about it (how many ads on tele they see for it - but who has the money for that?). In any case, Sandler gives a striking performance in this movie, and should be given the opportunity to do more good work. Only problem is he seems to have been born for this role, and i'm not sure how many other parts will suit his particular sensibilities (his angry/quiet persona which is here put to great use by master auteur P.T Anderson - who is a man to look out for). Sandler gives a performance rich in subtlety and heart, which is what separates this from his own comic movies. That, and his juvenile sense of humour.Punch-Drunk Love is the most magical film i've seen since Mulholland Drive. For someone who's seen an awful lot of movies it opens your eyes as if for the first time to the magic of movies.Watching Magnolia, in fact, felt a bit like this - but for me Punch-Drunk is a much more enjoyable experience. And for the first time a romance story has not seemed hackneyed or cliched. Not since Annie Hall has the romance genre been truly seen afresh, as if the director were writing the first and ultimate example of the genre.Not to say that P-D Love is just a romance - don't expect that. Like Magnolia, this P.T Anderson feature can not be pigeonholed in any genre. Don't think of it as a comedy or a romance - if you like, watch it as a &quot;drama&quot; and then you'll be relaxed enough to laugh when its funny; be upset when its tense, virtually weep with joy when its ecstatic.There is a beautiful montage on the DVD called &quot;Blood and Blossoms&quot; which is a perfect alternative title to Punch-Drunk Love. If one-line summaries are your thing (then P-D Love probably will not be! But if you're still curious) then P-D Love can be said to be about what romance and violence (blood and blossoms; Punch-Drunk Love) have in common. They're both unpredictable, edgy, often uncontrollable, coming in fits and bursts, and at any moment could break out or cease.In short, Clifford's Comments are: the most exciting movie of the last year, indeed of recent times. Compared to Tarantino's comeback of Kill Bill (which i actually have nothing against), this is a rewarding masterpiece which actually furthers P.T Andersons' already rich contribution to modern cinema. If i were any more superlative i'd be on commission.",5,"Most surprising, original movie of its year.",1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,3263,"['finally', 'saw', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'was', 'everything', 'i', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'been', 'waiting', 'half', 'year', 'now', 'b.c', 'i', 'missed', 'theatre', 'release', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'see', 'i', 'heard', 'radio', 'review', 'calling', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'edge', 'movie', 'none', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'course', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'had', 'made', 'first', 'movie', 'magnolia', ""'d"", 'given', 'project', 'making', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'respectable', 'actor', 'not', 'Anger', 'Management', 'coming', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'mass', 'populace', 'going', 'see', 'instead', 'due', 'macro', 'millions', 'producers', 'shelled', 'out', 'advertising', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'done', ""'m"", 'just', 'bitter', 'central', 'hollywood', 'more', 'money', 'spent', 'advertising', 'picture', 'making', 'picture', 'so', 'how', 'can', 'artists', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'compete', 'Ppl', 'judge', 'quality', 'movie', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'how', 'many', 'ads', 'tele', 'see', 'who', 'money', 'case', 'Sandler', 'striking', 'performance', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'opportunity', 'do', 'more', 'good', 'work', 'Only', 'problem', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'role', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'parts', 'will', 'suit', 'particular', 'sensibilities', 'angry/quiet', 'persona', 'here', 'put', 'great', 'use', 'master', 'auteur', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'who', 'man', 'look', 'out', 'Sandler', 'performance', 'rich', 'subtlety', 'heart', 'what', 'own', 'comic', 'movies', 'juvenile', 'sense', 'humour.Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'most', 'magical', 'film', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'awful', 'lot', 'movies', 'eyes', 'first', 'time', 'magic', 'movies.Watching', 'Magnolia', 'fact', 'felt', 'bit', 'Punch-Drunk', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'first', 'time', 'romance', 'story', 'not', 'seemed', 'hackneyed', 'cliched', 'Not', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'romance', 'genre', 'been', 'truly', 'seen', 'afresh', 'director', 'were', 'writing', 'first', 'ultimate', 'example', 'genre.Not', 'say', 'P-D', 'Love', 'just', 'romance', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Magnolia', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'feature', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'genre', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'comedy', 'romance', 'like', 'watch', 'quot', 'drama', 'quot', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'relaxed', 'enough', 'laugh', 'when', 'funny', 'be', 'upset', 'when', 'tense', 'virtually', 'weep', 'joy', 'when', 'beautiful', 'montage', 'DVD', 'called', 'quot', 'Blood', 'Blossoms', 'quot', 'perfect', 'alternative', 'title', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'one-line', 'summaries', 'are', 'thing', 'then', 'P-D', 'Love', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'be', ""'re"", 'still', 'curious', 'then', 'P-D', 'Love', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'what', 'romance', 'violence', 'blood', 'blossoms', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'have', 'common', ""'re"", 'unpredictable', 'edgy', 'often', 'uncontrollable', 'coming', 'fits', 'bursts', 'moment', 'could', 'break', 'out', 'cease.In', 'short', 'Clifford', 'Comments', 'are', 'most', 'exciting', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'indeed', 'recent', 'times', 'Compared', 'Tarantino', 'comeback', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'i', 'actually', 'have', 'nothing', 'rewarding', 'masterpiece', 'actually', 'P.T', 'Andersons', 'already', 'rich', 'contribution', 'modern', 'cinema', 'i', 'were', 'more', 'superlative', 'i', ""'d"", 'be', 'commission']",Punch-Drunk Love

Very few film makers assemble their films with the care and attention to detail that Anderson obviously gives to each and every shot and scene.

This symphony of varying elements composed together in harmony or disharmony all contribute to the beautiful result that is this film.Synchronicity and the underlying power of the universe is used as a force that propels this film forward. Free will is also examined and together the two forces, whether at odds or in harmony help show how our lives are pushed and pulled by fate, internal and external forces, and perhaps pudding.

500766,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00000G02H,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a child-man character prone to explosive anger, much like other Adam Sandler characters. But wait, this one is very different. Instead of a comedy, this is an art film where Sandler really delves deep into his character to find the source of his anger. It seems that his emotional development was stunted by the fact that with seven sisters, he was the only boy. They tease and torment him, but he can't really fight back, so it is all bottled up inside, except when it explodes in periodic outbursts.The story was inspired by an article in 'Time' magazine about a University of California civil engineer name David Phillips who took Healthy Choice up on their offer of frequent-flyer miles in exchange for purchasing their products. He bought 12,150 cups of pudding for just $3,000 and thereby acquired 1.25 million frequent-flyer miles (after waiting 6 to 8 weeks for them to process his coupons).---------------------------------[Barry looks around... ]Barry: Healthy Choice and American Airlines got together and put this promotion: If you buy any 10 Healthy Choice products, they will reward you with 500 frequent flier miles; with this special coupon, they'll up it to 1,000 miles. So, I think they are trying to push their teriyaki chicken which is $1.79, but I went to the supermarket and I looked around and I saw that they had pudding... for 25 a cup... comes in packages of four. But insanely... the barcodes... are on the individual cups! So, quarter a cup, say you bought $2.50 worth. That's worth 500... with the coupon it's 1,000 miles. It's a marketing mistake but I'm taking advantage of it. If you were to spend $3,000, that would get you a million frequent flier miles. You would never have to pay for a ticket the rest of your life.Lena: You... you bought all that pudding so that you could get frequent flier miles?==================================================Lena is played by Emily Watson. Barry's sisters both set him up and simultaneously try to sabotage the relationship, but by clever subterfuge he manages to keep it a secret. Besides the pudding, there is also a mysterious harmonium that 'falls off a truck' (no, really, it actually does) in the street by Barry's warehouse. Barry owns his own business, though when he wears a suit and tie in an attempt to project a professional image, his sisters still see him as their kid brother playing dress up.-----------------------------------------------Barry: I didn't ask for a shrink - that must've been somebody else. Also, that pudding isn't mine. Also, I'm wearing this suit today because I had a very important meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.========================================================To further complicate things, he calls a phone sex line and gets ensnared in an extortion shake down. Dean Trumbell (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is a Mattress Salesman in Utah who orchestrates the plot.It is a very strange movie, but Barry finally confronts his problems with Lena, pudding, and the Mattress Man. For an Adam Sandler movie, it is quite empowering. Though he is not ready to ""give a concert of anything"" he does manage to make some music with his harmonium, and it meshes with the soundtrack in a most satisfying way.----------------------Barry: I have a love in my life. It makes me stronger than anything you can imagine.===================================Paul Thomas Anderson is quite a director. The 2002 'Punch-Drunk Love' was quite different than other things he's done, such as 'There Will Be Blood' which won the Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis, and it is also quite different from anything else Adam Sandler has done, or probably will ever do again. It is a quirky and strange movie, but well worth watching.---------------------------Barry: I have to get more pudding for this trip to Hawaii. As I just said that out loud I realize it sounded a little strange but it's not.==========================================FILMS DIRECTED BY PAUL THOMAS ANDERSONThere Will Be Blood(2007)Magnolia(1999)Boogie Nights(1997)Hard Eight (Special Edition)(1996)FILM ROLES OF ADAM SANDLERAnger Management (Widescreen Edition)(2003) ....

500773,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00000G02H,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Ever watch a movie or listen to a record and a certain opinion of it will develop but whether you hadn't gotten yet and it grows on you or if it was good or bad right from the start is kind of nagging you? Should you spend more time with it and see if it'll eventually be a favorite or you shouldn't bother since it was never your taste to begin with? It's that state of being on the fence is kind of how I feel about Paul Thomas Anderson movies since I will admit he is a talent but then there's stylistic choices or story things that completely nag me and with ""Punch-Drunk Love"", we get a film that does just as much things right when it's not doing things wrong yet you don't mind that much anyway.Barry Egan works at a shop that sells novelty items including a strange take on a plunger or ""funger"" and is quite the easily irritable and awkward man. But 2 unexpected things happen in his life that can change him: a talk with a phone-sex operator who wants to extort him for his money as well as a new woman, Lena, who's quite attracted to him. Both events end up becoming huge catalysts for Barry's changing behavior which is quite erratic and filled with a bit of promise as well.Anderson's previous films I've seen such as Magnolia and There Will Be Blood were these films that I'd absolutely love if it wasn't for things that got in the way. While I will excuse the frogs and fascination with milkshakes, there was often times where the film would do something and completely lose me. Maybe it's too long and it becomes a sort-of indulgent length, or the aforementioned frogs in Magnolia, or the score and the lack of a compelling narrative in There Will Be Blood. With Punch-Drunk Love, 2 things I wasn't into was the score and a couple of weird interludes. For the former, some of it fits such as swelling orchestral strings reminiscent of old romance movies but then there's these weird percussive or noise freakouts that became incredibly distracting. Then on occasion, weird colors and patterns would show up and it becomes a case of ""what are these for?"" Like frogs and milkshakes, they seem more like neat ideas for novelty value rather than essential storytelling devices.However this is the least complex and ambitious of Anderson's work (I haven't seen Hard Eight yet) and as such, it actually works a lot better because of it. The characters are allowed to breathe and be in our attention a lot and let's the characters, particularly Barry, to develop over the course of the film. It's also more restrained as the long-as-hell Steadicam shots of Magnolia and Boogie Nights are played down and the film feels more accessible and easier to manage than complex stories about 10 different characters who know 10 different people. It's more stranger than the films Anderson has done but maybe that's why it's so charming; I have to admit on a couple of scenes, I actually smiled and felt almost moved.One can't talk about Punch-Drunk Love without talking about Adam Sandler. While I felt he misfired in Reign Over Me, here he's actually quite surprising and you really get a feeling that with the right character, this guy can deliver. And while Emily Watson's Lena is a bit of a mystery (why does she not recoil and actually embrace his weirdness), she's quite good and it's easy to see why he'd start to like her. We have frequent Anderson players Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luiz Guzman and 24's Mary-Lynn Rasjkub as Barry's rather manipulative, nosy sister.I'd recommend Punch-Drunk Love but with the wide distance with opinions the film has garnered, I'd suggest watching it but if you didn't like it, well, happens to everyone.",4,Upbeat and totally bizarre,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,3648,"['Ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'listen', 'record', 'certain', 'opinion', 'will', 'develop', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'was', 'good', 'bad', 'right', 'start', 'kind', 'nagging', 'Should', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'see', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'be', 'favorite', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'was', 'never', 'taste', 'begin', 'state', 'being', 'fence', 'kind', 'how', 'feel', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'will', 'admit', 'talent', 'then', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'story', 'things', 'completely', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'get', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'things', 'right', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'things', 'wrong', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'much', 'anyway.Barry', 'Egan', 'shop', 'novelty', 'items', 'including', 'strange', 'take', 'plunger', 'funger', 'quite', 'easily', 'irritable', 'awkward', 'man', '2', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happen', 'life', 'can', 'change', 'talk', 'phone-sex', 'operator', 'who', 'extort', 'money', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'woman', 'Lena', 'who', 'quite', 'attracted', 'events', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'huge', 'catalysts', 'Barry', 'changing', 'behavior', 'quite', 'erratic', 'filled', 'bit', 'promise', 'well.Anderson', 'previous', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'such', 'Magnolia', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'were', 'films', ""'d"", 'absolutely', 'love', 'was', ""n't"", 'things', 'got', 'way', 'will', 'excuse', 'frogs', 'fascination', 'milkshakes', 'was', 'often', 'where', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'completely', 'lose', 'Maybe', 'too', 'long', 'sort-of', 'indulgent', 'length', 'aforementioned', 'frogs', 'Magnolia', 'score', 'lack', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', '2', 'things', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'score', 'couple', 'weird', 'interludes', 'former', 'such', 'swelling', 'orchestral', 'strings', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'romance', 'movies', 'then', 'weird', 'percussive', 'noise', 'freakouts', 'became', 'incredibly', 'distracting', 'Then', 'occasion', 'weird', 'colors', 'patterns', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'case', 'are', 'frogs', 'milkshakes', 'seem', 'more', 'neat', 'ideas', 'novelty', 'value', 'rather', 'essential', 'storytelling', 'devices.However', 'least', 'complex', 'ambitious', 'Anderson', 'work', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Hard', 'Eight', 'yet', 'such', 'actually', 'lot', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'breathe', 'be', 'attention', 'lot', 'let', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Barry', 'develop', 'course', 'film', 'also', 'more', 'restrained', 'long-as-hell', 'Steadicam', 'shots', 'Magnolia', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'are', 'played', 'down', 'film', 'feels', 'more', 'accessible', 'easier', 'manage', 'complex', 'stories', '10', 'different', 'characters', 'who', 'know', '10', 'different', 'people', 'more', 'stranger', 'films', 'Anderson', 'done', 'maybe', 'why', 'so', 'charming', 'have', 'admit', 'couple', 'scenes', 'actually', 'smiled', 'felt', 'almost', 'moved.One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'talking', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'felt', 'misfired', 'Reign', 'Me', 'here', 'actually', 'quite', 'surprising', 'really', 'get', 'feeling', 'right', 'character', 'guy', 'can', 'deliver', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Lena', 'bit', 'mystery', 'why', 'not', 'recoil', 'actually', 'embrace', 'weirdness', 'quite', 'good', 'easy', 'see', 'why', ""'d"", 'start', 'like', 'have', 'frequent', 'Anderson', 'players', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Luiz', 'Guzman', '24', 'Mary-Lynn', 'Rasjkub', 'Barry', 'rather', 'manipulative', 'nosy', 'sister.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'wide', 'distance', 'opinions', 'film', 'garnered', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'well', 'everyone']",Punch-Drunk Love

Also, I guess I've watched too many movies because I am beginning to like some of these oddball films....and this one certainly qualifies as ""odd.""

Barry internalizes everything as he tries, desperately, to control his world. He seems to suffer from an acute case of agoraphobia and constantly looks uncomfortable. PTA simulates this feeling by punctuating moments of silence with sudden, jarring blasts of sound. It is the presence of Lena who provides Barry with the calm and love that he so desperate needs.Punch-Drunk Love is akin to a Technicolor Jacques Tati film, albeit starring Adam Sandler. Barry, with his ubiquitous bright blue suit and exaggerated physical mannerisms, echoes silent comedians of the past. This is readily apparent in a scene that ends with Barry dancing up and down a grocery aisle in a wonderful expression of pure happiness. It's a brilliant cinematic moment that is an absolute joy to watch.This is an excellent DVD with a flawless transfer. The DTS soundtrack will loosen yer fillings and shake your room with its rumbling bass. The extras are appropriate for this rather abstract, oddball film -- the best of the bunch being the 12 minute extended mood music video entitled, ""Blossoms and Blood."" Although, the ""Mattress Man Commercial"" is hilarious!My only caveat is that it would have been nice if PTA had done an audio commentary with Sandler. But I understand that he wants the film to speak for itself (the same reason why he didn't do a commentary for MAGNOLIA). Oh well.

In my mind Anderson is more successful here for this smaller project than he was in ""Magnolia"".  Another interesting choice of Anderson's is the casting of Adam Sandler as the neurotic novelty plunger salesman, Barry Egan.  I have always been ambivalent about the talents of Sandler, though I have enjoyed some of his vehicles(""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Anger Management"").  Anderson must have seen something in Sandler because he is precisely right for the part.  At the center of the film is the unlikely love story between Sandler and Emily Watson.  Normally, you would say this is unbelievable.  But the gyst of Anderson's film is that love is possible despite ourselves.  To the credit of Watson, we wholeheartedly believe that she could fall for this head case.  Other comic vignettes in the film involve Barry's obsession with obtaining frequent flyer mileage by purchasing $2,000.00 worth of pudding.

500784,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B00000G02H,David Kusumoto,"[7, 7]","I loved this 95-minute ""exploration"" about a ""man-child"" who finds ""intoxicating"" love for the first time.What happens if you're a boy (Adam Sandler) - in a man's body - with no confidence?  Sandler plays Barry Egan.  He hates himself, he feels like a loser and he doesn't know why.  He cries for no reason.  His heart is big, his seven sisters love him, but they make fun of him.  No one understands him.Of course they don't.  He smashes window and walls, tears up a rest room and stocks up on pudding to cash in on a marketing promotion flaw.  Is he also a wacko?But then a miracle.  He meets a courageous and perhaps foolish girl who likes the very things he hates about himself.  Love makes him so powerful, his life suddenly has a purpose.  It's like winning the lottery.This is about the only thing ""simple"" about the so-called ""storyline"" of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" a film I found bizarre and sweet - perhaps too artsy for its own good - yet oddly uplifting and satisfying.When Sandler's Barry Egan says Emily Watson's character is so pretty that he wants to ""smash her face with a sledgehammer,"" it sounds better in the movie than on paper.  It's funny and it works.  If you're a child, it impossible to find the ""right words"" to express the intensity of ""punch-drunk love.""I don't blame people who hated this film.  It would be snobby to say some people ""just won't get it.""  There's no point lying.  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a film that requires properly managed expectations.  Part of the problem (and genius) is Anderson's decision to cast Adam Sandler himself.  Sandler is a good actor here, but he doesn't do anything spectacular.  The best way to avoid feeling cheated is to push everything you know about Sandler out of your mind.  Pretend you're seeing him for the first time.  Sandler has teased his violent persona in previous over-the-top comedies, but in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" writer-director Anderson has channeled this tortured ""self-hatred"" act into something that isn't supposed to be funny.  He explores what might happen - if such a person fell in love - for the FIRST time.Equally maddening to some, Anderson doesn't use conventional words and images to ""articulate"" the mysteries of love.  He makes us see everything through the eyes of a loser who's never experienced them.  We see splashes of color and hear ""high-as-a-kite"" music that mirrors his euphoria.  Anderson doesn't spell everything out in deep dialogue, because in real relationships, we don't talk about everything.  Words come close, but they're rarely ""dead-on"" about what we're really feeling.""Punch-Drunk Love"" works best as a ""what if?"" romance involving a man who's emotionally stunted.  I don't know if a woman like Emily Watson's character exists.  I don't demand to know why she chases Sandler because I feel I'm watching everything through the eyes of Sandler's Barry Egan.  This is a story about the boy, not the girl.  Watson appears so radiant to Sandler's character that he feels she's looking right through him, making things easier.  This is all that matters to him.P. T. Anderson is always offbeat, but I didn't expect him to be so sadistically charming.  Unlike the pessimism of his previous films, this effort brims with optimism, delivering abstract ideas without using a chalkboard.Emily Watson gets the last line in the film and some people feel short-changed by it (I won't give it away).  But to me, it's terrific.  It's not a ""happily ever after"" prediction.  Instead, it's an open-ended, three-word expression of hope, acknowledging obstacles ahead without listing 'em.  It comes closer to the giddy feelings mirroring the complexities of love as we really know them, without getting gushy.  Why do we ""love"" at all?  Is it necessary?  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is an American original.  Calling it a ""romantic-comedy"" is very misleading.",4,Sledgehammer love!  Another winner from P.T.

Anderson has established an enviable track record.  But Adam Sandler--though slightly less repugnant than Jim Carrey--has not generally impressed me as someone I would choose to spend even 30 seconds watching.  (I have teenaged sons, thus have seen a few of his movies.)  Yet I did enjoy his performance in THE WEDDING SINGER, in which he demonstrated the ability to portray a human being instead of an obnoxious boor.  And ever since BREAKING THE WAVES Emily Watson has been one of my favorite actresses, always turning in strong & often extraordinary performances.  But still there was Sandler....Sufficiently skeptical to avoid this film in the theatres, and not even to hasten to see it on video, I nevertheless hoped it would overcome the handicap of Sandler and equal the quality standard established by P.T. Anderson's previous films.  Having seen it described as a ""romantic comedy,"" I hoped for something like MAGNOLIA MEETS THE WEDDING SINGER.  Boy was I surprised!Sandler is not the problem.  But watching him--or rather his character, Barry--is excruciating.  Barry may be the most pathetically screwed-up character a filmmaker has ever asked his audience to identify with (Paddy Chavesky's MARTY is a winner compared to Barry).  Everything he does is excruciatingly painful and stupid, from his job, to his pudding-for-free-airmiles scam, to his phone-sex nightmare, to trashing the restaurant restroom (oh, THAT Adam Sandler)--and the pain implicit in each of these episodes is intensified by a soundtrack like fingernails on a chalkboard.  By the time he finally makes an honest choice that leads to redemption, it's too little too late to save a film mired in its own excess.The problem is Anderson.  Like Sophia Coppola, he seems ignorant of the imitative fallacy in art.  And what could have been an unusual and arresting contemporary ""love"" story has become a painful exercise in audience endurance instead.

Anderson, apart from being a breath of fresh air as a director as well as a film nerd a la Wes Anderson, produces the best... BEST commentaries (not counting the secondary commentary on Boogie Nights with the entire cast).  Where are his insights into the look of the film?  The paticulars on the music?  The behind the scenes in the editing and scripting?  I only ask because he has been so good about it before.  This DVD, though it holds up to the theatrical version of the film falls short of being a great DVD.  We are given only two, that's right... TWO deleted scenes, from P.T. Anderson.  I highly doubt that a director who has given us such epic marathons like Boogie Nights and Magnolia only cut out ten minutes of footage in the editing process.  Don't get me wrong the Sister's Phonecall deleted scene is awesome, but that's it?  That's all I get?  More than any of his films I would have loved to have heard what he had to say about this one, about working with Adam Sandler, about the piecing together of the plot.  Sure Magnolia deserved a commentary as well and I guess he's just following suit here.  Waiting to rerelease the DVD again with MORE extras not worth putting here and making my buy it again.

I started to wonder if PTA picked him because of his ability to show rage or the fact that he can play some very different types of characters.Punch Drunk Love starts out with Barry Egan, a man who runs his own business, and basically has no life. He has seven sisters who still terrorize him, constantly reminding him of stupid things he had done as a child and calling him names.One night, he calls a phone sex line, possibly because he was lonely and wanted someone to talk to. All of a sudden, his life is not just about manufacturing plungers for Las Vegas hotels!One of his sisters introduces him to a girl named Lena, played by Emily Watson. Barry is a pretty strange guy, but Lena seems to find it attractive. He stumbles upon a marketing flaw within Healthy Choice foods and frequent flyer miles. (Apparently, something like this really happened... inspired by a TIME article)  Next, he is on a mission, buying pudding at every turn.One might say that there is not a whole lot going on with this movie, but I would disagree. I don't think that the story was the strongest part of this film, but I think that the humor kept me going, wondering what was going to be said or done next. I laughed out loud in the theater and that doesn't happen very often. If you really like offbeat characters and unpredictable humor, this movie is probably for you.

Adam gives the performance of his career as a frustrated individual who just can't seem to fit in and cope with life's situations- especially when it comes to women and relationships.  He is as confused with his own actions, thoughts and emotions, as he is with complete strangers. The direction and music compliment eachother well, enhancing the paranoid state of the protagonist.Each time I watch this movie I can't help but feel as though I have stepped into the shoes of Adam Sandler's character and accompany him on this roller coaster ride of emotional shambles.  Unlike the statements of a couple negative reviews, I find that the dialogue was fresh, funny and very realistic.This is a complex character study that offers a ton of fun if you don't cling too tightly to conventional movie making.  I admit that I was looking, or waiting, for a moment that never came - but I am not entirely sure what it was I was expecting.  However, that disappointment only came during the first viewing I had of this movie.  On the second viewing, I knew the story and could just enjoy it for what it was... a quirky, funny glimpse into the life of a unique kind of love.  I can honestly say that I believe this movie is perfect just as it is.This is punch-drunk love in its highest form... the story of two people in love who are completely consumed in their feelings and it is absolutely amazing to watch.  Nothing would tear these two apart.  Can't help but think that they have something that most people do not - passion, no matter how strange and kooky.

Now, my friend and I rented it from Blockbuster, and they are notorious for editing their movies (I am not sure how they can get away with this, but another friend bought Taxi Driver from them and it had much of the violence removed, and the Mulholland Drive I purchased from them actually blurred specific areas during a nude scene). In the version of PDL we rented, Sandler confronts Hoffman, and then quietly leaves the store, but my friend insists that in the theater Sandler acted much more violently.

500796,A3U20DIY3TCSNI,B00000G02H,drew m,"[13, 39]","Give Adam Sandler extra credit for trying to broaden his range with Punch Drunk Love.  The key word there is &quot;trying&quot;, because Sandler puts more effort into his performance here than he did in all his previous films combined.  That's not exactly a difficult task, since Sandler is responsible for one the laziest movies ever made (&quot;Big Daddy&quot;).  Paul Thomas Anderson was smart enough to see a running theme in Sandler's characters and attempt to show the flipside of that character - the weeping clown, if you will.  That Sandler was willing to reverse his persona so readily certainly deserves admiration.Critics, as a collective, despise Sandler.  And that's probably because they didn't follow his work from the beginning of his career, when he released a brilliant comedy album (&quot;They're All Gonna Laugh at You&quot;) and did the &quot;Denise Show&quot; sketch, probably the best SNL bit of the past 15 years.  If Sandler's efforts don't translate as well to full-length movies, it doesn't mean he isn't a gifted performer.  Misguided, maybe.  But anyone with a brain knows he's a talented performer.Unfortunately, Punch Drunk Love ends up doing him a huge disservice.  It's a good concept wasted.  The Tragic Sandler featured here is stuck in a film that has myriad problems.  There's no real plot to speak of.  The musical score is grating and obnoxious.  And, worst of all, it offers no reason for its lead characters (Sandler and Emily Watson) to fall in love with one another.All of that can be blamed on Anderson, who still owes the world for the crime that was Magnolia.  Anderson cuts the running time in half here, yet Punch Drunk Love still feels three hours long.  You keep waiting for the film to settle down and establish some kind of rhythm of its own, but it never does.  It instead exists as a series of tangentially related bursts of oddness.  That may work for a Radiohead record, but movie audiences usually need (and deserve) something in the way of structure.Sandler's character Barry Egan is also poorly written.  He acts irrationally, which is realistic enough.  The problem is that he just doesn't seem like a real person.  Sandler makes the mistake of giving Egan a babyish, almost mentally crippled way of speaking, and his violent behavior only makes him a curiosity, not a person with identify with or care about.  Other characters only exist to puzzle over why Barry acts the way he does.  But it's hard to imagine that many people would continue asking about someone who's so clearly a lost cause.Punch Drunk Love continues a major losing streak for Anderson, who was given too much directorial leeway before he deserved it.  Anderson has a true gift for annoying viewers.  One scene in Punch Drunk Love features Egan's sister berating him with the score screeching away in the background.  It's almost impossible to tolerate, which is par for the course these days with Anderson's films.  Punch Drunk Love, like Magnolia, seems designed only to appeal to the director himself and no one else.  It's sad, because in terms of photography this is one of the most beautiful films of the past year.  But Anderson needs to find some substance beneath his style.  Too bad for Sandler.(It's worth noting that if you're looking for the traditional wacky Sandler movie, you should avoid Punch Drunk Love at all costs.  It isn't funny at all.

I have a very offbeat and sometimes dark sense of humor, which is what you need to truly appreciate this.With not much of a plot, it thrives more on it's main character, Barry Egan, played wonderfully by Adam Sandler.  Barry is a not so average guy -- He is sweet, then funny, then very angry.  At his angry moments, he punches and kicks things like bathroom doors and rips soap dispensers out of walls, and kicks glass doors.  Then he cries, really cries..We don't understand why and neither does he.  His annoying and very unattractive sister wants to set him up with a friend from her work.  The rest of his sisters are all verbally abusive to him through life, which I think is part of the reason he flies off the handle like he does. We never know when to expect these outbursts.  After placing a call to a phone sex line, he finds his life being turned upside down and not to his liking.Novelty plungers are his business, and Pudding plays a supporting role.  In his quest to earn enough frequent flyer miles for life(and he doesn't fly), he buys enough of the stuff for it to have such a role.Lena(played by the adorable and wonderful Emily Watson) is the friend of the sister, and she goes out of her way to meet Barry after seeing his picture. I will not go further on here. I want you to go experience this trippy love story.  It's funny and always moving.  You don't know what to expect next, but it's well worth it all.  It has some parts that make absolutely no sense, but hey, does life make sense?  We are all just going with the flow of our lives and dealing with each obstacle as they hit us.  Just like Barry does in this movie.For those of you who have seen Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies, you may recognize a few of the other actors. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the potty mouth manager of the sex phone line, and Luis Guzmen plays a buddy at work.As outlandish as the movie is, I couldn't help but like it.  There are random thing that go on that don't do anything for the plot. If they do, I must have missed it.

In my opinion Anderson is a &quot;sound director.&quot;  The mood and the feel of the movie depend heavily on sound.  The soundtrack is vital in Punch-Drunk, from the frantic interactions with Sandler to the romantic scenes with Watson.  The talent on this film get kudos also.  Anderson regulars Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman were as always great.  I've really started to enjoy Emily Watson also, her talent with every movie I see her in is really impressive.

500804,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B00000G02H,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[3, 4]","Paul Thomas Anderson is an extraordinary talent who is among the most cinematic directors working today. After a promising debut (1996's Hard Eight), he hit a home run with 1997's Boogie Nights, which found just the right combination of style and substance. With 1999's Magnolia, he still delivered a remarkable film, but one that was handicapped by excess. Apparently having learned his lesson, Anderson restrains himself with Punch-Drunk Love which is his take on the romantic comedy genre.In a scant 90 minutes (half the running time of Magnolia), Anderson presents us with a quirky vision of true love. Punch-Drunk Love takes a completely different direction from the director's previous work. Here we get a more cinematic world that is less based in reality. Instead of bombast and indulgence, we get eccentricity and concision. Punch-Drunk Love takes place in its own reality, where the rules are dictated only by the emotions of the characters. The surrealism is also illustrated by the colorful designs which overtake the screen at several points. Punch-Drunk Love is not so much trying to tell a story, but rather to give us an experience. It is not interested in convention, nor it is interested in being cute and happy. Its characters are imperfect people with quirks and insecurities. Things happen which are not easily explained. If the Coen Brothers made a romantic comedy, I imagine it would be similar to this film.Punch-Drunk Love is anything but a conventional romance and that is its greatest asset. Many people were mystified by this film and reacted with hostility, but that may not be far from its intent. What an appropriate title ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is. It suggests romance from a skewed perspective. It suggests that what we will see might be different and challenging. However, many people have no desire to be challenged and simply want to see two good-looking stars in a predictable formula. If that is your desire then avoid this movie and look no further than How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. For those of us who look for a bit more depth in movies, Punch-Drunk Love should be a treat.I have not even mentioned Adam Sandler yet. Yes, he gives a fine performance. He proves that he is capable of more than just yelling and beating things up. He is charming as Barry Egan, but off-putting at the same time. Emily Watson is lovely as his love interest, the only person who may be his salvation from his life of insanity. Paul Thomas Anderson took a big chance with the casting of Sandler, but it works and it shows us how the Saturday Night Live alum is squandering his potential on stupid brain-dead comedies like Mr. Deeds when he does indeed have talent.The DVD, however, is disappointing. After the excellent presentation of Boogie Nights, I would have expected more from this one. Why is there no director commentary? This was the most disappointing oversight. There is really nothing on this DVD set that gives any insight into the making of the film whatsoever. The ""deleted scenes"" are uninteresting, the ""Blossoms and Blood"" video unnecessary, the Mattress Man commercial is neat though. It's very disappointing that there is no documentary, outtakes, more deleted scenes or an audio commentary. This DVD should have just been a single-disc Superbit title.

It opens on just another day in Barry's lonely and confusing life, and as the movie goes on, we see him grow as a person...not all in good ways. Barry represents many people out there; lonely, depressed, confused, angry at the world, low self-esteem etc. So right from the start, P.T. Anderson establishes his audiences interests. If you can't relate to Barry in any way, you will probably not enjoy this too much...even though you still may respect it.The pace and style of this film are much different than Anderson's other films; Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia. Here we are treated to a once-in-a-lifetime experience and new genre that was invented by this film. You can most likely expect to never see a film like this ever again, it is truely unique and astonishing. Adam Sandler really does a fabulous job of his portrayal of Barry Egan, and should've been nominated at the Oscars.What makes this film different, is it's visual style...I'd have to say almost a mix of cinematography from; Pulp Fiction, The Shining, and Anderson's own technique. It's very colorful yet dull at times. The colors in the film represent Barry's feelings at the moment and are really affective.When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was hooked...right there and then. It's one of the only trailers that doesn't mislead you into thinking the movie is something that it's not. The musical score with the film is beautiful yet haunting at the same time which really gives the movie an extra magical touch.The Two-Disc Special Edition Set is very nice, fitting the film very well. There aren't a truck-load of extras explaining most of the symbolism of the film, but I can guess that was done intentionally. Other than that, the picture and sound are above and beyond the Superbit par, and there are lots of fun and suiting extras. It's deadpan, yet quirky, and beautiful, and angry, and charming all at the same time.The whole experience is very dreamlike, a dream that you never want to wake up from.",5,As Charming as the Stars in the Sky,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,2112,"['dry', 'opening', 'credits', 'title', 'sequence', 'audience', 'thrown', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'world', 'just', 'day', 'Barry', 'lonely', 'confusing', 'life', 'movie', 'see', 'grow', 'person', 'not', 'good', 'ways', 'Barry', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'confused', 'angry', 'world', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'etc', 'So', 'right', 'start', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'audiences', 'interests', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'Barry', 'way', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'still', 'may', 'respect', 'it.The', 'pace', 'style', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'different', 'Anderson', 'other', 'films', 'Hard', 'Eight', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'Here', 'are', 'treated', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'experience', 'new', 'genre', 'was', 'invented', 'film', 'can', 'most', 'likely', 'expect', 'never', 'see', 'film', 'ever', 'again', 'truely', 'unique', 'astonishing', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'really', 'fabulous', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscars.What', 'film', 'different', 'visual', 'style', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'almost', 'mix', 'cinematography', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Shining', 'Anderson', 'own', 'technique', 'very', 'colorful', 'yet', 'dull', 'times', 'colors', 'film', 'represent', 'Barry', 'feelings', 'moment', 'are', 'really', 'affective.When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'was', 'hooked', 'right', 'then', 'one', 'only', 'trailers', ""n't"", 'mislead', 'thinking', 'movie', 'something', 'not', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'haunting', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'movie', 'extra', 'magical', 'touch.The', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Set', 'very', 'nice', 'fitting', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'truck-load', 'extras', 'explaining', 'most', 'symbolism', 'film', 'can', 'guess', 'was', 'done', 'intentionally', 'Other', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'Superbit', 'par', 'are', 'lots', 'fun', 'suiting', 'extras', 'deadpan', 'yet', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'angry', 'charming', 'same', 'time.The', 'whole', 'experience', 'very', 'dreamlike', 'dream', 'never', 'want', 'wake', 'up']",Punch-Drunk Love
500808,A3GQXLVWTJLARH,B00000G02H,Gordo the Gatling Gun,"[1, 1]","***********WARNING:  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS************************************************************It pretty much goes without saying that Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most unique and interesting filmmakers working today.  And while he has a small--yet slender body of work that began with Hard Eight (which I have not yet seen) and the rather mildly entertaining Boogey Nights, it is the subconsciously mesmerizing trio of Magnolia, The Master (which to my mind was enough to cement the director in the lower pantheon of great filmmakers), and the aforementioned Punch-Drunk Love that defines his work so far.  Not even the utter hysterics of the criminally overrated and overacted There Will Be Blood was enough to sway him out of what he does best; the study of the human subconscious.His juxtaposing of the study of the subconscious and the literal and formulaic defines themselves in his three opuses.  In Magnolia, it's in the cause-effect cycle and memory, with the raining frogs serving as a powerful metaphor (not even PTA understood the full extent of the film's many meanings; he stated it simply made sense to him); in The Master, it's in anarchist/comformist strain for individuality mixed in with a loosely controlled Rorschach test (in which one's perceptions on the film is defined strictly by the viewer, though it may still be influenced), and with a fictional parallel to the historical founding of Scientology.Lastly, with Punch-Drunk Love, the study is in emotional chaos mixed in with a basic love story, this time with color playing a big theme.  Almost the entire film carries a blue or black hue to it, especially Adam Sandler's character, Barry Egan.  The film, to a certain extent, can be extended to be considered a raw study of the inner psyche of Sandler himself, with his emotional outbursts being the only glimpse we ever get from who he really is as a person.  Insecure, angry, sad, giddy, confident.  It appears not even Sandler knows for sure what kind of person he really is; the journey if nothing else, is about him finding what kind of person he wants to be the most, and by the film's end, finds emotional stability and order to the chaos.  It is very much a classic comedy even if the film is oft classified as a drama and character study, but not strictly (it should be noted that the love of his life, played by Emily Watson's Lena Leonard, wears red throughout the whole movie to juxapose and possibly counterract Sandler's own depression and inner chaos).But behind the blossoming relationship between Sandler and Watson--both of them quite possibly giving their very best performances in their entire careers--we see so much more.  The opening scene establishes the entire method in which these multitude of moods are convened.  First, he witnesses a car accident (a symbolic forshadowing towards his much harbored rage and anguish), then he pick up an abandoned harmonium from the street (obsession and loneliness), and finally, meets Leonard herself (juxaposing the future opportunity for peace as a potential suiter with the possibility of a cycle of greater anguish and rage being a friend of one of his seven abusive sisters).  All this within a single opening scene.  After that, what started as a simple, relatively harmless visit on a phone sex hotline spirals even further down into a chaotic mix of emotions (amplified by one of the greatly underrated musical scores ever composed on film) as Sandler slowly opens up to and falls in love with Watson all the while the woman on the other end of the hotline sends thugs owned by her supervisor, Dean Trumbell (returning PTA allumini Phillip Seymour Hoffman, essentially playing a direct reflection of Egan).  One moment, we're having an emotional breakdown.  Next moment, all is warm and comforting.  Immediately after that, Sandler is assaulted and harrassed by either his sisters or the four thugs.  And immediately after that, Sandler's all giddy as he buys hundreds of thousands of pudding just to rack up flyer miles so he could fly far away from his current lifestyle forever (eventually attempting to, but failing, to convert the pudding coupons into the necessary flyer miles just to follow Watson to Hawaii--demonstrating that his alternate ways out aren't as easy to exploit as he'd imagine).  The scenes and the music gets so frantic and is constantly shifting from one emotion to the other that it becomes rather tense and uncomforting.It is only by finally taking charge and beating his four assailants that just threatened the only bit of peace left given to him and subsequently confronting Trumbell in person--phone from the booth still in his hand to signify his strengthened resolve to maintain his control and peaceful equilibrium over his own life at all cost--that Egan finally restores order in his life.  And indeed, order to the chaos is restored.Everybody gives absolutely first rate performances in this movie.  Even Adam Sandler.  If not for such a contentious competition at the Best Actor race in 2002, Sandler would have more than likely netted a Best Actor nod (at least Roberto Beninni wouldn't be able to reign on his parade with his critically panned Pinocchio, much like what he did with Life is Beautiful versus Jim Carrey's The Truman Show).  Emily Watson plays the role as is necessary here, and Philip Seymour Hoffman gives yet another first rate performance on his resume (the phone banter between him and Sandler near the end of the movie is far more funnier than anything that Sandler ever did as a comedian, in or out of film).And much like with Magnolia's raining frogs or The Master's choice between a life of individual freedom versus the continuous apprenticeship into the doctrine of The Cause, order is restored to a world filled with chaos.  The only difference here is that unlike the other two films, order has been set in stone here whereas there was arguably never really any order to begin with.  However, PTA has a knack for beginning his own unique brands of classic comedy En Medias Res (I think the saying goes), or In the Middle of Things.There is very good reason why the film sits at a very high 70% range on Rotten Tomatoes.  There is a very good reason PTA won Best Director at Cannes, nominated for the Grand Prix at the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.  Adam Sandler himself was nominated for a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Role for this movie for crying out loud!  It is one of the greatest critical highlights of 2002 in cinema--indeed a very good year indeed, ranking one of the 10 best easily.  Had this film done well financially, Sandler would have more than likely continued honing his acting chops leaving the creativity to the creative in film.  No film he has ever done before or since has come anywhere near as close to being as unique, intense, inventive, and flatout wonderful as Punch-Drunk Love.  As a much shorter followup to PTA's self-proclaimed magnum opus, it shows that the director continues to possess the knack for great experimental films.Highest recommendations all around--especially for all those who loathe Adam Sandler with every fiber of your being--even his runner-up films such as The Wedding Singer or Funny People.  Roger the Ocelot concurs.  Once he started purring--which was about 10 minutes in--he never stopped.  When the movie was over, he stroked his entire body around my hand and rolled around purring friendlier than he ever has before.  That, my friends, at the very least guarantees it a perfect rating.And for future reference too, both Magnolia and The Master warrant perfect 5 star ratings as well.",5,The normally loathesome Adam Sandler starring in a great film?

500809,A3G3DN6ODH3RXR,B00000G02H,Graham V. Foy,"[3, 5]","Usually when I think about a particular movie and try to arrive at some kind of conclusion about it, I tend to end up saying that it's either &quot;good&quot;, or bad, in some final, ultimate sense. A movie is either worth seeing or isn't; it either has something interesting to say or hasn't. Of course, even worse than movies that ultimately have nothing to say are pretentious films that pretend to have some such thing.That much being said, I'd like to state first that probably no movie has ever left me so confused as to its true identity as a good or bad film experience, as &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;.Everyone who saw it told me it was stupid; some just said it was horrible. A friend of mine who has seen a lot of movies and whose judgment in these matters I trust said that he had tried to keepan open mind throughout the whole movie - but that by the end he felt like the director's whole intention was just to have him sitting there scratching his head, and he left disappointed. In the first place, when I had first heard that the new P.T. Anderson movie was going to have Adam Sandler in it, I thought &quot;Wow, that's going to be really painful.&quot; But &quot;Magnolia&quot; was and is one of my favorite movies, and most importantly, Emily Watson was playing alongside the protagonist. I figured that even if it was really bad, the sheer novelty of seeing an actress like Emily Watson rattling off some horrible script would be worth seeing.Well, what can one say? It succeeds at being a good and a bad movie at the same time. I think I'm convinced that this was Anderson's mission. This movie has some great, beautiful moments. The initial party scene where Barry kicks out a glass door; he ends up confiding to his brother-in-law in the laundry room: &quot;Sometimes I cry a lot...&quot; Whether it's Sandler or Anderson who should get the credit for that scene, it's pure genius. The score by Jon Brion seems to follow Barry everywhere he goes, and it works to great effect. The writing is genius in so many places. Agains, towards the end of the movie, when Barry has cracked and flown to Hawaii just to see this chick he hardly knows: he doesn't become a good guy, he explodes on his sister over the phone &quot;I'm not gonna take this !@#$ing *&amp;^% anymore you %$#@...!&quot;Again, a great scene, prefectly filmed.The only problem is...this movie is bipolar or something.

I always felt there was a sadistic side to Sandler in a lot of his comedy, a love of being cruel and malicious to people.  Granted, many comedians are very angry people, but Sandler seems to have a vicious streak in him 3000 miles wide, and this is brought to the fore in Punch Drunk Love.  Sandler seems like he could lose it at any moment, with 7 annoying sisters and a horrid job.  I think we're supposed to find sympathy for Sandler, but we don't, because he isn't really a nice guy, but a guy who lets people walk all over him, and seems poised to take revenge by going on a shooting spree.  The film itself feels disjointed, and as many others have pointed out, one doesn't believe when the Emily Watson character falls in love with Adam's character.  She's relatively normal, and he is teetering on complete insanity.  If she had been a tad more insane, it may have worked.  Sandler's performance, while good, was not Oscar worthy (as critics were screaming ""Oscar buzz!  Oscar buzz!"").  This is an OK film that is really kind of a mess.

500813,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B00000G02H,guillermoj,"[9, 19]","I am a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson's movies, yet for some reason (besides knowing beforehand that this was not one of his amazing Altmaneque multi-character studies and my general skepticism about Adam Sandler as an actor), my gut told me to take a pass when this movie first came out. Since enough time had passed since it came out, and knowing that both Sandler and the movie received critical acclaim, I decided to give it a shot.The movie starts out in an imaginative manner and thankfully does not neatly tell you everything that you need to know about its leading character (wonderfully played by Adam Sandler in a role that shows a totally different layer of what he has to offer as an actor) nor where the movie will be heading. As most of us know, most of the movies that come out are created by committee, focus groups, commercial tie-ins, and seem to have a contractual obligation to secure a box office friendly PG-13 rating, and simply too many stakeholders. So one has to at least be thankful that PTA, like Spike Jonz (I loved ""Being John Malkovich"" and liked some of ""Adaptation"") just to name another young director, has enough clout to work in a relatively independent without having to waver from their vision. It's not everyday that movies like ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" are allowed to make it to the screen while moving at a slow pace and sometimes clocking in at over 3 hours as is the case with PTA or gets to make a movie as original as ""Being John Malkovich"" in the case of Jonz.That about all the positive that I can squeeze out from ""Punch Drunk Love"", which the exception that PTA manages to tell his story in less than 90 minutes and he has not lost his ability to have a character's words sound like those of real people. His talent is never more evident than in scenes highlighting the awkward dialogue that characters sometimes engage in. Since I hate to give anything away as I hate it when reviewers tell you much more than is needed to get you to make up your mind as to whether to see a movie or not, I will say that Sandler's character is not your typical movie character and I venture to say that there is a little of him in all of us; notwithstanding the character is impossible to get to know and becomes annoyingly close to acting like Dustin Hoffman's character in ""Rain Man.""Although the lead character's psychological challenges are universal and could make for an interesting character study in the tradition of most of most of John Cassavette's movies or Martin Scorcese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Alice Does Not Live Here Anymore,"" here we are bombarded with a sameness that feels like watching paint dry. There is some background at the macro level to possibly explain part of his behavior, but it's more frustrating than illuminating. Any scene involving his family is like nails on a chalkboard and that may have been PTA's intent, but although no character has to be likable to be interesting, this bunch almost makes Neal LaButte's characters seem downright lovable. Also, the family's role in Sandler's condition is too simplistic and played way too broadly and don't work on either a serious or comedic level.Also, this movie was marketed as a love story, there is little love about this movie, especially when you take into account that Sandler's alleged love interest, played the talented Emily Watson. She almost seems like an afterthought and the movie really does not take the time to establish the why or even how of this alleged couple should be or are together. She is essentially the maybe/maybe not ""girlfriend"" character that correctly frustrates movie actresses who don't want to appear as an appendage to a central character every time a film is greenlighted. Also as hard as Watson tries, Sandler has zero chemistry with her. She ALMOST manages to do this alone, but Sandler's superb acting can't quite stretch far enough to show at least a glimpse of why Watson's character would be drawn to him in any way.Even more frustrating is a secondary yet central plot involving a credit card and phone sex. The whole concept may have looked good on paper but the execution is so tired and has a second rate soap opera feel. I would compare it to the last of act of ""Adaptation."" Here the offense is even worse because it seems to contradict the pace of the movie and to me serve as a cop out to create tension and try to use tape to try to bring some cohesiveness to where Anderson's wants to take the plot. I'll take true character development over plot development any minute of the day and I was surprised to see the movie move away from what it was trying to do, albeit unsuccessfully.I can't believe that I am only giving a movie made by PTA what I think is generous two stars, and mostly due to Adam Sandler's performance, PTA's talent for dialogue, and for continuing to break formulaic cinema mantras. With the exception of this movie, PTA's work to date merits at least 4 or even 5 stars, and I hope that he returns or rather moves forward to continue what should be a long career as a writer/director.Some may feel that anyone who did not like this movie is either lazy or unsophisticated because he/she may have expect neatly tied up plots and loveable characters, but this is quite a bumper sticker generalization as many of us truly love unconventional movies but just did not happen to like this one. For example some may not have liked ""Memento"" because it did not fit the mold and it was not told in linear fashion, but those are two of the many reasons why I loved it. PTL's previous movies, as well as some recent foreign successes (""Amores Perros"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien, just to name a couple) are also examples of independent fare that I found to be truly brilliant. In the same fashion that huge budget extravaganzas don't necessarily make for a bad movie, the independent banner does not assure a great one either. If anyone doubts that latter, just try and sit through ""Buffalo 66"" and get back to me.",2,Major letdown from one of my favorite directors,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",2004,5991,"['am', 'huge', 'fan',

In an overwhelming moment of loneliness, he phones a sex hotline and unwillingly involves himself in a web of blackmail and deceit.  After finding a true relationship with understanding and adorable Lena, however, he develops the courage to face his blackmailers in order to protect his new love.Although this film demands a lot of patience from the viewer, it was Sandlers sad and touching role as Barry that kept me glued.  He employs some of his trademark skills, fits of rage contrasted with pathetic pouting, but in this film none of these traits are funny, and they are not intended to be.  Barry is both pathetic and suffers from serious emotional highs and lows.The film is very much about the strength that comes with falling in love.  The high point of the film is when Barry travels out of state to find and confront his blackmailers in order to protect Lena.

Personally, I loved it, although it took several days for that reaction to sink in.(As an aside: issuing this movie as a mainstream release as the distrubutors did all but guaranteed it would be a box-office flop, which it was.  It should've been released solely through the art-house circuit at first.  Then it would've had a chance to develop word-of-mouth support, and from there perhaps move up to the mainstream theaters.

One of them  introduces him to a friend of there's played by Emily Watson. She wants to date him despite his sister trying to make her  think he's nuts. They date and after a goodnight kiss he wants to see her more.There's also a subplot where some guys are after him because he called a scamming phone sex number just to talk because he was lonely. The women he talks to keeps calling him asking for money and threatens him since she has all his information.

I have no special interest in this movie or any deeply analytical comments to make about it, but here is what I thought.This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie.  Meaning?  No slapstick comedy (which is effectively entertaining in its own genre).  This movie is funny, but if it is watched solely for comedic value, the viewer will be somewhat dissapointed.This is the story of one man, Barry Egan (I'm sure that is an anagram, but I'm too stupid to figure it out),  who can only find the strength to break out of his own neurotic life, when he finds love.This movie is not for everyone.  It portrays a very specific emotional mindframe.  One must identify with Adam Sandler's character to feel something for the movie as a whole (which is hard becuase you keep expecting him to be the same character from his other movies like Happy Gilmore).Overall, I found this movie to be refreshingly awkward in every way.  The movie moved at a drunken pace (I suppose I should have known that from the title).  It can test the patience of those with ADD.I can't identify any specific element that made it a good movie for me, but it just seemed to gel together very well.

Good thing a film's success cannot be measured by the opinions of a mere three persons. Punch Drunk Love is not a comedy. It is a quirky, whimsically-driven, off-balanced little piece of filmwork that acts more as an example of traditional indy film than the movie many folks probably wanted it do be, which was no doubt the second coming of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore Part Duex. There are segments of comedy, but they're part of the story and not the main push of the film. Barry, Sandley's character, is normal. He's insecure, lacking in love, with sisters who joke with him and mockingly question his sexual orientation, and eventually, Barry sheepishly tries his luck with a phone-sex operator who ends up swindling him out of his money. This is where our story takes off, and the flight is hugely surprising.Sandler takes a risk here, and proves quite capable of pulling off a character that would eventually help with the parts he played in 'Reign Over Me' and 'Splanglish'. The result is incredibly intoxicating. I would liken it to watching your mild-mannered grandfather suddenly jump atop the kitchen table and start dancing. It's unexpected, a little odd, but at the end of the day, makes you glad you were there to witness the spectacle.As for the ""Mattress Man"" (played by Phil S. Hoffman), Sandler's scene involving him is worth the price of admission as Barry confronts the shady Mattress Man and procedes to tell him,  ""I didn't do anything. I'm a nice man. I mind my own business. So you tell me 'that's that' before I beat the hell from you....""To watch him and hear his voice during this portion of the film is enough to make even nominal movie-goers erupt with ecstatic movie joy.

500826,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00000G02H,Joe Sherry,"[0, 0]","Punch-Drunk Love is the fourth film by one of my favorite directors, Paul Thomas Anderson (Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia).  It stars Adam Sandler and Emily Watson as well as several PTA regulars (Luis Guzman, Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Despite the fact that the film is directed by PTA, I was skeptical about seeing Sandler in this movie.  It wasn't that I didn't think he could do the job, but it was simply that I didn't think he could do the job.  Happily, I was wrong.  Adam Sandler was spot on in the role of Barry Egan.Barry Egan (Sandler) is a business man.  He owns his own business, but is a lonely, slightly neurotic man.  He finds himself unable to approach women and his relationship with his sisters does not help matters any.  They remind him of when he was a young boy and they teased him and he got so mad that he smashed the glass door with a hammer.  Barry still has that same explosive anger inside him.  He is restrained (a rarity for Sandler), but is still capable of flying off the handle when he gets mad enough.  He has no ability to control his anger.  Several times throughout the movie he gets angry and destroys things.Barry is lonely one night and calls a phone sex line.  While there is very obviously a scam going on, Barry is trusting and gives far too much information.  This turns ugly and the phone sex operator has her boss (Philip Seymour Hoffman) send three men to extort Barry and beat him up.  They do, and they will come back into the film later.Barry meats a woman named Lena Leonard (Emily Watson).  Lena is a friend of Barry's sister and wants to get to know him.  Barry is initially too shy and awkward but somehow they begin a friendship and then a relationship.  While Watson does a fantastic job as Lena, the relationship isn't quite believable.  The problem is that there doesn't seem to be any reason for Barry and Lena to get together, except that they had decent conversation when they were out on a date.This is a very good movie, but I'm hesitant to say that it is one of PTA's best or that it is as good as the best of 2002.  It falls short of both Boogie Nights and the masterpiece that was Magnolia (that's right, I said Magnolia).  Everyone turns in excellent performances but there is just no reason to really care for Barry nor does the movie have the heart that Boogie Nights and Magnolia did.  Paul Thomas Anderson is a fantastic young director and I look forward to his future work, and Punch-Drunk Love is a good movie, it just isn't a great one.",4,"not PTA's best picture, but still good",1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,2515,"['Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'fourth', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Hard', 'Eight', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'PTA', 'regulars', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'fact', 'film', 'directed', 'PTA', 'was', 'skeptical', 'seeing', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'do', 'job', 'was', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'do', 'job', 'Happily', 'was', 'wrong', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'was', 'spot', 'role', 'Barry', 'Egan.Barry', 'Egan', 'Sandler', 'business', 'man', 'own', 'business', 'lonely', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'man', 'unable', 'approach', 'women', 'relationship', 'sisters', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'remind', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'teased', 'got', 'so', 'mad', 'smashed', 'glass', 'door', 'hammer', 'Barry', 'still', 'same', 'explosive', 'anger', 'restrained', 'rarity', 'Sandler', 'still', 'capable', 'flying', 'off', 'handle', 'when', 'mad', 'enough', 'ability', 'control', 'anger', 'Several', 'times', 'movie', 'angry', 'destroys', 'things.Barry', 'lonely', 'one', 'night', 'phone', 'sex', 'line', 'very', 'obviously', 'scam', 'going', 'Barry', 'trusting', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'ugly', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'boss', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'send', 'three', 'men', 'extort', 'Barry', 'beat', 'up', 'do', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'film', 'later.Barry', 'woman', 'named', 'Lena', 'Leonard', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Lena', 'friend', 'Barry', 'sister', 'get', 'know', 'Barry', 'initially', 'too', 'shy', 'awkward', 'somehow', 'begin', 'friendship', 'then', 'relationship', 'Watson', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Lena', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believable', 'problem', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'reason', 'Barry', 'Lena', 'get', 'together', 'had', 'decent', 'conversation', 'when', 'were', 'out', 'date.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', ""'m"", 'hesitant', 'say', 'one', 'PTA', 'best', 'as', 'good', 'best', '2002', 'short', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'Magnolia', 'right', 'said', 'Magnolia', 'Everyone', 'excellent', 'performances', 'just', 'reason', 'really', 'care', 'Barry', 'movie', 'have', 'heart', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'did', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'fantastic', 'young', 'director', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'work', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'good', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'great', 'one']",Punch-Drunk Love

Reilly and Melora Walters in ""Magnolia."" We see how crippled Sandler's character is, but only get hints of the traumas suffered by Emily Watson, as his counterpart, the strongest of which is that she falls for him.Sandler's Egan is such an emotional cripple that he stumbles through the world as if he is mentally challenged. This is not standard issue ""Little Nicky"". This is ""The Waterboy"" as lensed by Hitchcock, and just as horrifying. Anderson builds the tension in Egan's day, so that when he finally has an outburst at his sister's birthday party, after a scene that is emotionally nerve-wracking, we are grateful for the release. That this release is followed by uncontrolled weeping, all of which is played completely straight, both deepens our understanding of Egan and reassures our trust in the director and his star.The movie is indeed funny at times, but for all its laughs, much of the time it plays as a horror film, in the tradition of ""Eraserhead."" Though far more realistic in treatment, Barry Egan is a direct descendant of Henry Spencer, stumbling through a world he can barely comprehend and paying the price for every transgression. Anderson plays on our fears about family and sex, and when Egan calls a 900 number, more for company than sex (he doesn't realize he should be masturbating), it turns into his worst nightmare. The movie ends on what should be a positive note, but it's so desperate that it's hard to feel good.Despite the reviews the movie is not an Art House film, any more than Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" is an Art House film. It is a genre picture that steps out of the genre, intelligent, creative and confident - in other words, something apart from standard Hollywood fare. Anderson uses music, light and sound much more to his advantage than many directors, creating an emotional context that helps support his story. His use of color and light is particularly effective, as when a pay phone suddenly glows when a call is connected, or when the lovers kiss in silhouette while a parade of strangers pass behind them.This is a Paul Thomas Anderson movie starring Adam Sandler, not an Adam Sandler movie directed by P.T. Anderson. As in many of his films, Sandler explodes in fits of violence. Unlike his other films, the violence doesn't seem choreographed. In one scene, he ""beats up a bathroom,"" and it looks like we're watching outtakes: things don't break or they break too easily, there's no build, there's no catharsis. We don't feel better after Sandler's explosions, we feel unnerved. Sandler literally runs through much of the movie, but there's nothing freeing about it. There is one moment of simple joy, when Egan dances an impromptu soft-shoe in a supermarket. It's the only time he seems at all comfortable in his own skin. This movie is Adam Sandler's ""Phantom of the Opera."" He pulls off the mask and shows the horror beneath. And that makes him the most sympathetic he's ever been.",5,Creepiest Romance Ever,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,3837,"['first', 'half', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'new', 'film', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'one', 'most', 'unsettling', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movie', 'theater', 'opening', 'minutes', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'character', 'played', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'horrific', 'accident', 'car', 'apart', 'taxivan', 'screech', 'halt', 'unseen', 'passenger', 'harmonium', 'street', 'front', 'then', 'rescuing', 'said', 'harmonium', 'street', 'almost', 'killed', 'speeding', '18-wheeler', 'surprise', 'warehouse', 'where', 'peers', 'out', 'world', 'terror', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'been', 'described', 'strange', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'quirky', 'eccentric', 'truth', 'comedy', 'pitch-black', 'romance', 'as', 'dysfunctional', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'barely', 'lightened', 'version', 'romance', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Melora', 'Walters', 'Magnolia', 'see', 'how', 'crippled', 'Sandler', 'character', 'only', 'get', 'hints', 'traumas', 'suffered', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'counterpart', 'strongest', 'him.Sandler', 'Egan', 'such', 'emotional', 'cripple', 'world', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'not', 'standard', 'issue', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'Waterboy', 'lensed', 'Hitchcock', 'just', 'horrifying', 'Anderson', 'tension', 'Egan', 'day', 'so', 'when', 'finally', 'outburst', 'sister', 'birthday', 'party', 'scene', 'emotionally', 'nerve-wracking', 'are', 'grateful', 'release', 'release', 'followed', 'uncontrolled', 'weeping', 'played', 'completely', 'straight', 'understanding', 'Egan', 'trust', 'director', 'star.The', 'movie', 'indeed', 'funny', 'times', 'laughs', 'much', 'time', 'horror', 'film', 'tradition', 'Eraserhead', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'treatment', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Henry', 'Spencer', 'stumbling', 'world', 'can', 'barely', 'comprehend', 'paying', 'price', 'transgression', 'Anderson', 'fears', 'family', 'sex', 'when', 'Egan', '900', 'number', 'more', 'company', 'sex', ""n't"", 'realize', 'should', 'be', 'masturbating', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'movie', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'positive', 'note', 'so', 'desperate', 'hard', 'feel', 'reviews', 'movie', 'not', 'Art', 'House', 'film', 'more', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Unforgiven', 'Art', 'House', 'film', 'genre', 'picture', 'genre', 'intelligent', 'creative', 'confident', 'other', 'words', 'something', 'apart', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Anderson', 'music', 'light', 'sound', 'much', 'more', 'advantage', 'many', 'directors', 'creating', 'emotional', 'context', 'support', 'story', 'use', 'color', 'light', 'particularly', 'effective', 'when', 'pay', 'phone', 'suddenly', 'when', 'call', 'connected', 'when', 'lovers', 'kiss', 'silhouette', 'parade', 'strangers', 'pass', 'them.This', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'starring', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'not', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'directed', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'many', 'films', 'Sandler', 'fits', 'violence', 'other', 'films', 'violence', ""n't"", 'seem', 'choreographed', 'one', 'scene', 'up', 'bathroom', ""'re"", 'watching', 'outtakes', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'break', 'too', 'easily', 'build', 'catharsis', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'better', 'Sandler', 'explosions', 'feel', 'unnerved', 'Sandler', 'literally', 'much', 'movie', 'nothing', 'freeing', 'one', 'moment', 'simple', 'joy', 'when', 'Egan', 'impromptu', 'soft-shoe', 'supermarket', 'only', 'time', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'mask', 'horror', 'beneath', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'ever', 'been']",Punch-Drunk Love

500830,ARR1DJAGD5992,B00000G02H,"Jose Eduardo da Rocha Azevedo ""Z""","[0, 1]","THE MOVIEWhat attracts me on PT Anderson's movies is that they're so rich in details that the more you see them, the more you discover. This adds a lot to the &quot;re-view&quot; level and pleasure experience. Not to mention his cinematography, use of music, actor's direction. Punch-Drunk Love is no exception.This is a story about change, about opening our hearts, about taking control of our lives. About blue meeting red. And the positive consequences this meeting can produce.Adam Sandler is a sad and frustrated guy whose life is not in his hands. He just keeps pushing it. He lives in a blue world, he's Mr Blues. Pay real attention to the colors in this movie. The movie starts blue, on a blue morning just before the sun start to shine. Hot colors represent desire, temptation to change, challenges.The first sign his life is about to change comes as a shocking morning crash. Just like the frogs shook lives in magnolia. The second sign - a red cab drops a piano (not a piano, actually, but a keyboard instrument whose name I don't remember now). The third sign - RED HOT - Emily Watson, who's always wearing red until they meet for real (I won't tell it all, am just trying to help clarify some points to make PDL more enjoyable).After these signs, it's left for him to do something, to choose between changing or not his status quo. By picking the piano, he opts for change. And when a truck scares him, he's advised that this won't be risk free, but he goes for it. And we have a beautiful movie everyone can take some lessons from.Some people argue that there are times when the music goes over the dialogs, that it's &quot;badly mixed&quot;. They didn't get it. Please note that every time this occurs, the dialogs are not important, and the music adds mood to what is - the interaction, the growing feelings between Adam and Emily, or Adam and his own life.A movie I recommend that deals with this very much is A Man And A Woman, by Claude Lelouch. The dialogs are never as important as the relation, the reaction, the gestures, the looks between the &quot;man&quot; and the &quot;woman&quot;. Simply beautiful and original - a history told by gestures, not only words. Pure cinema.So, to enjoy this lovely movie, pay attention to the details, observe the colors, what and who is out-of-focus and listen to the music. Everything is very well orchestrated by a fabulous, talented, original and capable director (maybe storyteller fits better) - Paul Thomas Anderson. He sometimes defy our minds, and that's very good.THE DVDIt's Superbit. But sometimes I feel magnolia has a better picture... Anyway, the transfer is very good. The sound - DTS - is very good, using all channels for music and effects very well. This is somewhat rare, specially for this kind of movie. It surprised me more than the Superbit image.The second disc has one specially interesting extra, which adds to the comprehension of the movie - Blossoms And Blood. And, also, some traditional extras, like trailers, deleted scenes, more samples of the amazing art used and &quot;scopitones&quot;. What's missing, in my opinion, is a featurette with PT Anderson, like there is on magnolia. Maybe he felt Blossoms And Blood would fulfill this. By the way, the image on this extra is very good.If you like magnolia, has an open mind and heart and also conscience of yourself and your life, if you understand that not all things must have a reason why, you'll certainly enjoy Punch-Drunk Love. It is both a loving/touching story and a very good DVD, with a high &quot;re-view&quot; level.If you believe movies must be more logical or coherent than life, this is not for you.",5,"Love and change, the PT Anderson's way",1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,3654,"['MOVIEWhat', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'movies', ""'re"", 'so', 'rich', 'details', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'discover', 'lot', 'quot', 're-view', 'quot', 'level', 'pleasure', 'experience', 'Not', 'mention', 'cinematography', 'use', 'music', 'actor', 'direction', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'exception.This', 'story', 'change', 'opening', 'hearts', 'taking', 'control', 'lives', 'blue', 'meeting', 'red', 'positive', 'consequences', 'meeting', 'can', 'produce.Adam', 'Sandler', 'sad', 'frustrated', 'guy', 'life', 'not', 'hands', 'just', 'pushing', 'blue', 'world', 'Mr', 'Blues', 'Pay', 'real', 'attention', 'colors', 'movie', 'movie', 'blue', 'blue', 'morning', 'just', 'sun', 'start', 'shine', 'Hot', 'colors', 'represent', 'desire', 'temptation', 'change', 'challenges.The', 'first', 'sign', 'life', 'change', 'shocking', 'morning', 'crash', 'Just', 'frogs', 'shook', 'lives', 'magnolia', 'second', 'sign', 'red', 'cab', 'piano', 'not', 'piano', 'actually', 'keyboard', 'instrument', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'now', 'third', 'sign', 'RED', 'HOT', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'who', 'always', 'wearing', 'red', 'meet', 'real', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'am', 'just', 'trying', 'help', 'clarify', 'points', 'make', 'PDL', 'more', 'enjoyable', '.After', 'signs', 'left', 'do', 'something', 'choose', 'changing', 'not', 'status', 'quo', 'picking', 'piano', 'change', 'when', 'truck', 'advised', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'risk', 'free', 'have', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'everyone', 'can', 'take', 'lessons', 'from.Some', 'people', 'argue', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'music', 'dialogs', 'quot', 'badly', 'mixed', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Please', 'note', 'time', 'dialogs', 'are', 'not', 'important', 'music', 'mood', 'what', 'interaction', 'growing', 'feelings', 'Adam', 'Emily', 'Adam', 'own', 'life.A', 'movie', 'recommend', 'deals', 'very', 'much', 'Man', 'A', 'Woman', 'Claude', 'Lelouch', 'dialogs', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'important', 'relation', 'reaction', 'gestures', 'looks', 'quot', 'man', 'quot', 'quot', 'woman', 'quot', 'Simply', 'beautiful', 'original', 'history', 'told', 'gestures', 'not', 'only', 'words', 'Pure', 'cinema.So', 'enjoy', 'lovely', 'movie', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'observe', 'colors', 'what', 'who', 'out-of-focus', 'listen', 'music', 'Everything', 'very', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'fabulous', 'talented', 'original', 'capable', 'director', 'maybe', 'fits', 'better', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'sometimes', 'defy', 'minds', 'very', 'good.THE', 'DVDIt', 'Superbit', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'magnolia', 'better', 'picture', 'Anyway', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'DTS', 'very', 'good', 'using', 'channels', 'music', 'effects', 'very', 'well', 'somewhat', 'rare', 'specially', 'kind', 'movie', 'surprised', 'more', 'Superbit', 'image.The', 'second', 'disc', 'one', 'specially', 'interesting', 'extra', 'comprehension', 'movie', 'Blossoms', 'Blood', 'also', 'traditional', 'extras', 'trailers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'samples', 'amazing', 'art', 'used', 'quot', 'scopitones', 'quot', 'What', 'missing', 'opinion', 'featurette', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'magnolia', 'Maybe', 'felt', 'Blossoms', 'Blood', 'would', 'fulfill', 'way', 'image', 'extra', 'very', 'good.If', 'magnolia', 'open', 'mind', 'heart', 'also', 'conscience', 'life', 'understand', 'not', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'reason', 'why', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'loving/touching', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'high', 'quot', 're-view', 'quot', 'believe', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'logical', 'coherent', 'life', 'not']",Punch-Drunk Love
500831,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00000G02H,Joseph Haschka,"[7, 14]","Within the first few minutes of the show, I suspected that PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE might prove problematic. As when Adam Sandler's character Barry Egan is watching two vehicles drive towards him down a city street. One of them continues past him and off screen (never to be seen again) after being blown onto its side by an explosion coming from underneath. The second vehicle, a van, stops opposite Barry only long enough for someone inside to open the sliding door and deposit a harmonium - a midget organ - onto the pavement. Neither event is ever explained.Egan owns a business that sells promotional items - you know, the junk on which you can have your name or that of your firm imprinted. He apparently has no success meeting women and is harassed by seven sisters, who are either trying to fix him up with a nice girl or asking him if he's gay. His current obsession is to collect enough bar codes from containers of a major brand of pudding to qualify for a million frequent flyer miles. (He's discovered a loophole in the giveaway's rules that allows him to do this with minimal expense at a 99 store.) His life is further complicated when he makes his first call to a phone sex service, and is subsequently blackmailed by the service's operators. Furthermore, Barry harbors a repressed rage that occasionally reveals itself through violently destructive behavior, as when he tears apart a restaurant bathroom, or smashes a brother-in-law's sliding glass doors. And what's with that edgy, bright blue suit he wears from the first scene to the last?Not since MULHOLLAND DRIVE have I seen a film so bizarre and unpredictable as PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE. I enjoyed the former because I thought I perceived the message it was trying to convey. (I must have been more mellow that evening.) The latter just left me fidgeting in my seat, especially during the first third or so when the music(?) soundtrack was barely more than a discordant cacophony of sounds, produced by the All-Chimpanzee band, that set my teeth on edge. My wife liked the movie very much, saying the message was that love can better a person. (Typical female viewpoint!) Well, maybe, if you squint real hard. In this case, Barry is perhaps changed by his love for Lena (Emily Watson), one of his sister's friends. Not only is Lena attracted to him for some reason that eluded me, but she herself remained a cipher, although there were hints of mental hairline fractures that perhaps made her Barry's perfect match. (My guess is that the two were more apt to join into a single, cataclysmic, mutually assisted meltdown.)PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE is certainly ""different"", and there are some good visuals. However, call me an old fuddyduddy if you will, but I found the film, peopled with characters that are unattractive at worst and indifferent at best, ultimately unentertaining - if not downright irritating.",2,Had me fidgeting in my seat,1035417600,"10 24, 2002",2002,2861,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'show', 'suspected', 'PUNCH-DRUNK', 'LOVE', 'might', 'prove', 'problematic', 'when', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'character', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'watching', 'two', 'vehicles', 'drive', 'down', 'city', 'street', 'One', 'screen', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'being', 'blown', 'side', 'explosion', 'coming', 'underneath', 'second', 'vehicle', 'van', 'opposite', 'Barry', 'only', 'long', 'enough', 'someone', 'inside', 'open', 'sliding', 'door', 'deposit', 'harmonium', 'midget', 'organ', 'pavement', 'event', 'ever', 'explained.Egan', 'business', 'promotional', 'items', 'know', 'junk', 'can', 'have', 'name', 'firm', 'imprinted', 'apparently', 'success', 'meeting', 'women', 'harassed', 'seven', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'fix', 'up', 'nice', 'girl', 'asking', 'gay', 'current', 'obsession', 'collect', 'enough', 'bar', 'codes', 'containers', 'major', 'brand', 'pudding', 'qualify', 'million', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'miles', 'discovered', 'loophole', 'giveaway', 'rules', 'do', 'minimal', 'expense', '99', 'store', 'life', 'further', 'complicated', 'when', 'first', 'call', 'phone', 'sex', 'service', 'subsequently', 'blackmailed', 'service', 'operators', 'Furthermore', 'Barry', 'repressed', 'rage', 'occasionally', 'violently', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'when', 'apart', 'restaurant', 'bathroom', 'brother-in-law', 'sliding', 'glass', 'doors', 'what', 'edgy', 'bright', 'blue', 'suit', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'Not', 'MULHOLLAND', 'DRIVE', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'bizarre', 'unpredictable', 'PUNCH-DRUNK', 'LOVE', 'enjoyed', 'former', 'thought', 'perceived', 'message', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'mellow', 'evening', 'latter', 'just', 'left', 'fidgeting', 'seat', 'especially', 'first', 'third', 'so', 'when', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'barely', 'more', 'discordant', 'cacophony', 'sounds', 'produced', 'All-Chimpanzee', 'band', 'set', 'teeth', 'edge', 'wife', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'saying', 'message', 'was', 'love', 'can', 'better', 'person', 'Typical', 'female', 'viewpoint', 'Well', 'maybe', 'squint', 'real', 'hard', 'case', 'Barry', 'perhaps', 'changed', 'love', 'Lena', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'one', 'sister', 'friends', 'Not', 'only', 'Lena', 'attracted', 'reason', 'eluded', 'remained', 'cipher', 'were', 'hints', 'mental', 'hairline', 'fractures', 'perhaps', 'made', 'Barry', 'perfect', 'match', 'guess', 'two', 'were', 'more', 'apt', 'join', 'single', 'cataclysmic', 'mutually', 'assisted', 'meltdown', 'PUNCH-DRUNK', 'LOVE', 'certainly', 'different', 'are', 'good', 'visuals', 'However', 'call', 'old', 'fuddyduddy', 'will', 'found', 'film', 'peopled', 'characters', 'are', 'unattractive', 'worst', 'indifferent', 'best', 'ultimately', 'unentertaining', 'not', 'downright', 'irritating']",Punch-Drunk Love
500832,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00000G02H,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","Paul Thomas Anderson is like Quentin Tarantino in the way that he's able to design his own world and the characters in it and convince you that this place might actually exist. He's taken us into the world of porn stars and into a town where frogs fall from the sky; Now he takes us into the world of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" the only Anderson movie I didn't enjoy upon my first viewing. I loved Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia immediately...But when I first saw ""Punch-Drunk Love"" I turned off my television with so many questions running through my head. Even as I write this, having now seen the film 5 times and loving it,I still have questions.Anderson's energetic, anxiety-filled, almost ADHD world doesn't seem realistic for a minute. His protagonist Barry Egan (played by Adam Sandler) is either odd, insane, or retarded. Anderson presents us with Barry but makes no judgment about him and leaves it to the audience to decide. Barry obviously has a lot of problems, but whether he's mentally disturbed or mentally challenged is never quite approached. In many moments, I wondered if maybe the events were just occurring in his head. I'll get to that in a moment.The basic plot structure breaks down like this: Barry is a business owner who is enjoying a cup of coffee outside his wherehouse when there is a sudden car wreck and a taxi appears, dropping off a small piano. Barry takes it into the wherehouse and begins working on it. Meanwhile, he finds a marketing campaign with a big marketing error in it, that he begins using to his advantage. After Barry calls a phone-sex line, he finds himself being harassed by the girl he talked to...At the same time, he meets Lina (Emily Watson), who may be the girl of his dreams. We learn early on that Barry has extreme anger problems. He's got 7 sisters who continually, ceaselessly harass him. When he goes to a party with all 7 of them present, he ends up kicking in the sliding glass door...Which apparently he already did earlier in life with a hammer, although he frequently claims not to remember although it's obvious he does.That's what makes Sandler's performance so brilliant. He completely buries himself in this character. While Barry has the same violent outbursts that we've seen come from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Dave (from Anger Management); This is hardly the same Adam Sandler we've seen since SNL. Just like a person knows when their friend is lying or tired or getting angry, we sense when it's happening to Barry. This has to do with the combination of two things. Sandler's performance and the way Anderson directs the scenes. By the time Barry kicks in that sliding glass door, you're ready to kick in your television set. Anderson is amazingly skilled at creating a feeling of anxiety or anger for his audience. Since his films are either love it or hate it, this talent goes two ways. It either makes you FEEL the anxiety and anger of the character or it makes you act it out.The big question about this film that still plagues me is whether this is all or mostly occurring in Barry's head. The car wreck scene in the beginning looks like a pretty serious wreck, but there's no sounds of anyone reacting and it doesn't seem like anyone points it out later. Later in the film, Barry rips a phone headset out of the base and appears in Utah with the phone still in his hand. Did he run to Utah? And back!!!???

Bentley ""amateur critic""","[1, 1]","Adam Sandler will probably forever have the reputation for being the loveable and endearing SNL goofball in such movies as Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. Though he made Punch Drunk Love, probably his most serious role since The Wedding Singer but it's different. Sandler plays Barry Egan, a somewhat socially disoriented owner of a small business, daily harassed by seven sisters, whose taunts of his childhood lead him to paroxysms and fits of self doubt, rage and violence. He calls a phone sex hotline more for company and an attempt to make a friend with a girl, something he seems to have trouble doing due to his timidness and insecurity, rather than for carnal purposes (likemost men do when they call one of those hotlines), but he gets himself involved with a major problem, both emotionally and financially.Then, one of his sister's friends, Lena, played by Emily Watson, meets Barry, and a romance blossoms. Though, Barry still has to go through many troubling obstacles so that he can find true happiness w/Lena. I don't want to give the film away.The cinematography itself is bizarre. It's almost like a Clockwork Orange, the Radiohead video ""Fake Plastic Trees"" (the supermarket scene is a testament to that), and your average Hollywood romance movie. It shows Adam Sandler in a new, more serious light, though his romantic side is still evident, and whether you like the film or hate it, you must give Adam Sandler credibility for trying something different.

500836,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00000G02H,K. Driscoll,"[10, 10]","Paul Thomas Anderson is either hit or miss with me.  I likedHard Eight, I lovedBoogie Nights, but I really thought he lost his way withMagnolia.  That isn't to say I can't recognize that he is immensely talented and I'm looking forward to seeing his latest filmThere Will Be Blood.  Punch-Drunk Love is a smaller movie about Barry Egan, a business owner who sells novelty items such as stylized toilet plungers.  Everything about Barry Egan permeates with a kind of frustrating sadness.  His seven older sisters constantly insult him and his life is consistently portrayed as minimalist and disassociated.  He is a profoundly lonely man.  His bizarre social behavior is awkward but at times spirals into both perversion as well as intensely violent fits of rage.  All the while, he is portrayed as the film's protagonist. Anderson is especially delicate in making us understand his eccentricities as justifiable survival mechanisms within the paradigm of his uncomfortable past and nearly pathetic current life.  Anderson is careful not to mock or exploit Egan for his faults.Who could play such a unique and intriguing character?  I have to admit, I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler's early comedies.  EspeciallyBilly Madisonand I don't care who knows about it.  I love the silly and stupid humor of Adam Sandler and I firmly believe it is what put him on the map.  But he was just a character in those early films and besides those films really are just a series of comedy sketches.  It would've made more sense if Billy Madison were placed into a CGI world, a cartoon, or a comic book in the first place.  He continued to be silly all along but his characters always carried this dark side that wasn't easy to pinpoint among the poop jokes and slap-stick.  He was almost like Adam West'sBatmanwas in the old television show and how we see Batman now in Christopher Nolan'sBatman moviesis how we see Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love.  It is as if Billy Madison orHappy Gilmorewere snatched away from the unrealistic comedic worlds of those respective films and aggressively forced to exist in the real world, where every scene isn't necessarily working toward a punch-line.  Although, much of Barry Egan's behavior in the real world is, at least on the surface, not unlike the behavior of Madison and Gilmore.The most amazing thing about the whole Sandler dynamic is that he can really act.  He stands toe-to-toe with Phillip Seymour Hoffman (an Anderson regular who happens to be an amazing actor) in my favorite scene of the movie, where these two angry idiots just scream back and forth at each other over the phone.  The scene makes their later encounter in person an amazing confrontation.  Every single scene Sandler is in we tend to feel for the people around him.  Knowing what his temper is capable of made me uncomfortable for the people who surround him but especially uncomfortable for Egan himself, who seemingly can't settle into his own skin.  He does seem to find some comfort around Lena (Emily Watson), whose relationship with Barry is really what the film is intent on seeing through.Punch-Drunk Love has a great style.  Anderson has a way of making ordinary scenes memorable and important scenes extraordinary. He is a also a great writer and makes even the smallest characters as strong as his leads.  Thesoundtrackis of course the perfect fit as well.  In the end and most important of all, Anderson tries hard to allow us the pleasure of watching Barry Egan bring some kind of comfort into his troubled life and I for one was surprised to enjoy it as much as I did.",4,Who is Adam Sandler?,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,3585,"['Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'hit', 'miss', 'likedHard', 'Eight', 'lovedBoogie', 'Nights', 'really', 'thought', 'lost', 'way', 'withMagnolia', ""n't"", 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'immensely', 'talented', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'latest', 'filmThere', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'smaller', 'movie', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'novelty', 'items', 'such', 'stylized', 'toilet', 'plungers', 'Everything', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'kind', 'frustrating', 'sadness', 'seven', 'older', 'sisters', 'constantly', 'insult', 'life', 'consistently', 'portrayed', 'minimalist', 'disassociated', 'profoundly', 'lonely', 'man', 'bizarre', 'social', 'behavior', 'awkward', 'times', 'spirals', 'perversion', 'as', 'well', 'intensely', 'violent', 'fits', 'rage', 'while', 'portrayed', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Anderson', 'especially', 'delicate', 'making', 'understand', 'eccentricities', 'justifiable', 'survival', 'mechanisms', 'paradigm', 'uncomfortable', 'past', 'nearly', 'pathetic', 'current', 'life', 'Anderson', 'careful', 'not', 'mock', 'exploit', 'Egan', 'faults.Who', 'could', 'play', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'character', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'early', 'comedies', 'EspeciallyBilly', 'Madisonand', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'love', 'silly', 'stupid', 'humor', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'firmly', 'believe', 'what', 'put', 'map', 'was', 'just', 'character', 'early', 'films', 'besides', 'films', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'series', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'were', 'placed', 'CGI', 'world', 'cartoon', 'comic', 'book', 'first', 'place', 'continued', 'be', 'silly', 'characters', 'always', 'carried', 'dark', 'side', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'pinpoint', 'poop', 'jokes', 'slap-stick', 'was', 'almost', 'Adam', ""West'sBatmanwas"", 'old', 'television', 'show', 'how', 'see', 'Batman', 'now', 'Christopher', ""Nolan'sBatman"", 'how', 'see', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'orHappy', 'Gilmorewere', 'snatched', 'away', 'unrealistic', 'comedic', 'worlds', 'respective', 'films', 'aggressively', 'forced', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'scene', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'working', 'punch-line', 'much', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'behavior', 'real', 'world', 'least', 'surface', 'not', 'behavior', 'Madison', 'Gilmore.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'whole', 'Sandler', 'dynamic', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'toe-to-toe', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Anderson', 'regular', 'who', 'be', 'amazing', 'actor', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'angry', 'idiots', 'just', 'scream', 'back', 'forth', 'other', 'phone', 'scene', 'later', 'encounter', 'person', 'amazing', 'confrontation', 'single', 'scene', 'Sandler', 'tend', 'feel', 'people', 'Knowing', 'what', 'temper', 'capable', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'especially', 'uncomfortable', 'Egan', 'who', 'seemingly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'settle', 'own', 'skin', 'seem', 'find', 'comfort', 'Lena', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'relationship', 'Barry', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'intent', 'seeing', 'through.Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'great', 'style', 'Anderson', 'way', 'making', 'ordinary', 'scenes', 'memorable', 'important', 'scenes', 'extraordinary', 'also', 'great', 'writer', 'even', 'smallest', 'characters', 'as', 'strong', 'leads', 'Thesoundtrackis', 'course', 'perfect', 'fit', 'well', 'end', 'most', 'important', 'Anderson', 'hard', 'allow', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'bring', 'kind', 'comfort', 'troubled', 'life', 'one', 'was', 'surprised', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Punch-Drunk Love

Sandler, Watson, Guzman, and Hoffman are absolutely outstanding, bringing an incredible believability to their characters, in spite of everything else.  But I was left shaking my head in wonder as to what the whole point was.  Yes, the movie had its moments, but they were very few and far between, with an overwhelming lack of focus and direction pervading the majority of the film.  I suppose that if you enjoy art house fair, you might find something to rave about, but even though I look for something deeper than superficial entertainment in a movie, I just couldn't seem to find anything here to keep me satisfied.As far as the quality of the DVD, it's a good transfer, excellent sound (although a very odd soundtrack), and the second disk has a plethora of special features...none of which I found overly interesting.If you're looking for cheap entertainment, this isn't it.  If it's an involving story that makes you part of itself, this isn't for you either.  But, if you're looking for something odd, and difficult to pay attention to, this might be the movie for you.

Sadly I found myself disappointed.Sandler plays the same vaguely-retarded character given to acts of random violence that he has played a million other times in his career; see Mr Deeds,  Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison etc.  The only difference is that here he doesn't get to say ""Boobies!"" and snicker a lot. The character he plays is more sympathetic than usual, but still the same lost little boy, out of touch with the world, down trodden and taken advantage of.  Here he makes some sort of decision to stand up for himself, but the character is so ill-conceived and poorly developed that we never really gain an insight into the changes he seems to undergo.  Yes he realizes he loves this new girl, but why? Why is she different to any other girl he's met and been afraid to talk to?  Why can he now stand up to his sisters?  Why does he now become impulsive and outgoing?The female lead is similarly undeveloped. As other reviewers note, her attraction to and love for Sandler is never really touched upon, her motives never explored and her reasons never ascertained.On the positive side, the cinematography is beautiful. The movie looks really great, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding as usual.  However, instead of making a compelling piece of art such as ""American Beauty"" by Sam Mendes, Anderson ends up creating a willfully obscure piece of work in the vein of David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"".  Another obvious reference would be ""Donnie Darko"", however in that movie the underlying themes carry the random acts that happen, while in ""Punch..."", as in ""Magnolia"" the randomness is left unexplained, ultimately seeming superfluous - an attempt at being post-modern without following through.  For example, the car crash at the start of the movie that Sandler witnesses? Hello?Ultimately the movie is well put together and beautifully shot, but it suffers from a certain lack of direction and an absence of real meaning at its core, and I have to say I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.

500839,A3JAIZQ5RS064X,B00000G02H,"Ken Miller ""kenmiller32""","[0, 1]","Punch Drunk Love is the latest offering featuring Adam Sandler.  We all know Sandler as the stupid goofy comic from The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, etc.But-- Punch Drunk Love is also the latest offering from Paul Thomas Anderson, the brash young stylist behind movies like Boogie Nights and Magnolia.  What results?  An Adam Sandler art film, almost.  Well, an art film AROUND Adam Sandler; that's more like it.Throw together Emily Watson, Adam Sandler, phone sex, toilet supplies, hired thugs, buying mass quantities of pudding, highly annoying sisters, two very unhappy people, a load of suppressed rage, and a spontaneous trip to Hawaii, and what do you get?  PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE.Sandler plays a toilet-supply entrepreneur who has always been the dim bulb in the family. He finds a harmonium.  He doesn't date, and he has no basis for believing that Emily Watson is ""the one"" for him, yet he falls in love with her.  Watson's acting style is unnervingly real; it is just the opposite of what the audience expects from Sandler.  It's hard to know what to make of the casting of the two lead roles.  There are few moments of chemistry between the two, and, for better or worse, I think that's what the director envisioned.  She's like photorealism; he's like a cartoon.  Put them together-- is it genius, or is it a cheap gag?  It's hard to say.Sandler's not the normal Sandler character-- he turns his manic hyperactivity down a few notches.  And Anderson is not quite the normal Paul Thomas Anderson:  instead of giving us 10 or 20 characters over a sprawling 2.5 hour movie, he serves up just a few characters, over 90 minutes.  This results in a more satisfying movie for all, an enterprise more comedic than dramatic.  The film is, though, a dark or at least offbeat comedy.Sandler's character buys loads and loads of pudding during a special promotion, so he can accumulate coupons for frequent flyer miles.  He sells toilet items--a strange job if ever there was one.  All his overbearing sisters do is heckle him and worry about him, and he surely has no idea where to take the relationship with Watson's character.Story alone could not carry this film, so there exists a series of sight gags and quirky motifs.  It's hard to know whether Anderson was trying to be some sort of visionary moldbreaker, or he realized that the other actors were just working around Sandler, and he had to throw some goofball stuff into the mix to keep people interested.  At one point, a character sings a song from the Robert Altman film Popeye.  (I actually wish I had not recognized the song; the reference instantly became overly cute)  At another time, Anderson goes fishing for laughs by having a character unexpectedly tumble off his chair.  It saves a scene which otherwise goes nowhere.Who knows what P.T. Anderson had in mind.  I admire him for delivering such an oddball movie.  It's not for Adam Sandler fans, and it's not for the director's fans, really.  It's unusual enough and idiosyncratic; all would agree.  I think it will find an audience over the years, and maybe even become a cult classic.For now, though, Punch Drunk Love is just making me wish Anderson had made the next great step after Magnolia, rather than cutely tossing out a flick just to defy expectations.ken32",3,did he make this movie on a dare?,1034035200,"10 8, 2002",2002,3277,"['Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'latest', 'offering', 'featuring', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'know', 'Sandler', 'stupid', 'goofy', 'comic', 'Waterboy', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'etc.But', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'also', 'latest', 'offering', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'brash', 'young', 'stylist', 'movies', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'What', 'results', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'art', 'film', 'almost', 'Well', 'art', 'film', 'AROUND', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'more', 'like', 'it.Throw', 'together', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'phone', 'sex', 'toilet', 'supplies', 'hired', 'thugs', 'buying', 'mass', 'quantities', 'pudding', 'highly', 'annoying', 'sisters', 'two', 'very', 'unhappy', 'people', 'load', 'suppressed', 'rage', 'spontaneous', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'PUNCH-DRUNK', 'LOVE.Sandler', 'toilet-supply', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'dim', 'bulb', 'family', 'harmonium', ""n't"", 'date', 'basis', 'believing', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'one', 'yet', 'love', 'Watson', 'acting', 'style', 'unnervingly', 'real', 'just', 'opposite', 'what', 'audience', 'Sandler', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'casting', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'chemistry', 'two', 'better', 'worse', 'think', 'what', 'director', 'envisioned', 'photorealism', 'cartoon', 'Put', 'together', 'genius', 'cheap', 'gag', 'hard', 'say.Sandler', 'not', 'normal', 'Sandler', 'character', 'manic', 'hyperactivity', 'down', 'few', 'notches', 'Anderson', 'not', 'quite', 'normal', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'instead', 'giving', '10', '20', 'characters', 'sprawling', '2.5', 'hour', 'movie', 'up', 'just', 'few', 'characters', '90', 'minutes', 'results', 'more', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'enterprise', 'more', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'film', 'though', 'dark', 'least', 'offbeat', 'comedy.Sandler', 'character', 'loads', 'loads', 'pudding', 'special', 'promotion', 'can', 'accumulate', 'coupons', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'miles', 'toilet', 'items', 'strange', 'job', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'overbearing', 'sisters', 'do', 'heckle', 'worry', 'surely', 'idea', 'where', 'take', 'relationship', 'Watson', 'character.Story', 'alone', 'could', 'not', 'carry', 'film', 'series', 'sight', 'gags', 'quirky', 'motifs', 'hard', 'know', 'Anderson', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'sort', 'visionary', 'moldbreaker', 'realized', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'working', 'around', 'Sandler', 'had', 'throw', 'goofball', 'stuff', 'mix', 'keep', 'people', 'interested', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'song', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'film', 'Popeye', 'actually', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'recognized', 'song', 'reference', 'instantly', 'became', 'overly', 'cute', 'time', 'Anderson', 'fishing', 'laughs', 'having', 'character', 'unexpectedly', 'tumble', 'off', 'chair', 'scene', 'otherwise', 'nowhere.Who', 'what', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'had', 'mind', 'admire', 'delivering', 'such', 'oddball', 'movie', 'not', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'not', 'director', 'fans', 'really', 'unusual', 'enough', 'idiosyncratic', 'would', 'agree', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'years', 'maybe', 'even', 'become', 'cult', 'classic.For', 'now', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'just', 'making', 'wish', 'Anderson', 'had', 'made', 'next', 'great', 'step', 'Magnolia', 'rather', 'cutely', 'tossing', 'out', 'flick', 'just', 'defy', 'expectations.ken32']",Punch-Drunk Love

500843,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00000G02H,Lee Armstrong,"[10, 14]","Paul Thomas Anderson won the best director award in 2002 at the Cannes Film Festival for this little gem.  Jon Brion who did sound on two of Anderson's other films, &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Hard Eight,&quot; is certainly almost another character with a score whose emphasis on dissonance and percussion mirror the quirky and haunting world of Barry Egan.  Anderson's film is somewhat expressionistic in its use of sound that is bold &amp; effective.One might wonder how someone as wonderfully naive as Barry is able to run a business; but it is the stark normalcy of the spacious empty warehouse setting that contrasts the unusual events and cluttered emotions of Barry's inner life.  There are no frogs dropping from the sky like in &quot;Magnolia,&quot; but there is a harmonium that is mysteriously dropped off at the end of the alley after a rolling car crash.  We see Barry presented with an instrument, but unable to play well which mirrors his lack of ability to find joy and happiness.  Luis Guzman who was in &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; does a nice job as Barry's foreman, anchoring the movie's sense of reality.Adam Sandler does an amazing job of being a completely repressed guy who continually wears a bright blue suit and then turns around and puts his fist through a glass door at his sister's house.  He seeks therapy advice from his dentist brother-in-law who then blabs all about it to the whole family, totally humiliating Barry.  This character's world is so unsatisfying and his behavior so naive, that it is believable he'd call a phone porn number just to have a chat.  It's never entirely clear why Lena Leonard played by the marvelous Emily Watson is attracted to Barry.  The great moral of the picture that when we have love in our lives we become stronger than anyone could possibly imagine is shouted at Philip Seymour Hoffman in the mattress shop.  And that's what this movie is about; and it is enough.Along with Jon Brion's score, the visual rainbow elements make this as much an art film as a commercial venture.  We see repeated themes of hallways and corridors throughout which give the movie a sense of transition.  &quot;Punch Drunk Love&quot; has a unique artistic vision that is ultimately rewarding.

It touched my heart and my funnybone.  Paul Thomas Anderson, who brought us Magnolia, wrote, directed, and co-produced Punch Drunk Love.  Punch Drunk Love is similar to Magnolia, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Anyone who enjoyed any one of those films should enjoy this one.Adam Sandler plays Barry Eegan, a loner painfully isolated from society, who finds love in an odd way.  Sandler turns in a fine performance as the mentally tortured man.  Barry owns a business selling designer toilet plungers, so even though he owns a small business, he is still a misfit!  Barry has SEVEN interfering and uncaring sisters.  Seven is the magic number of many fairy tales, and Barry is sort of a Cinderella in this fairy tale.  His sisters drive him over the edge into mental instability.  Barry has one friend, Lance, played by Luis Guzman.  Lance is his assistant at his business, managing a small crew that is always dropping crates off forklifts.Enter Lena, played by Emily Watson.  Emily likes Barry, and a magical transformation starts.  One problem is that Barry gave his social security number to a phone sex line, and now they are trying to extort money from him.  I love the characters in this movie.  FOX's ""24"" fans will be happy to see ""Chloe"" as one of Barry's overpowering sisters, acting exactly like she did on 24.

500846,A389E7NNXVGY90,B00000G02H,marcvdp,"[3, 4]","""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a compelling and strange film - sort of an avant-garde romantic comedy - centering on the love, trials and tribulations of a frustratingly socially inept character, Barry Egan, played with remarkable skill by a person who hitherto was thought of as good for only big dumb laughs, Adam Sandler.As many have observed, this is indeed a love-it-or-hate-it affair that will alienate and confuse Sandler fans who only like him for those dumb laughs and lowbrow films. But, it should be noted, Sandler isn't really stepping into entirely new shoes; his character is more of an extension of the one he already plays, just plumped for more depth to suit the needs of the movie. He's still the same awkward, overgrown kid who seems ready to explode at any moment from pent-up angst.But get behind the arty nature of this film, its terrific off-beat percussive soundtrack and its stunning color palate, and you have a movie that, true to the romantic-comedy tradition, will make you feel warm and fuzzy by the end. It's a misfit love story, a tale of two people who are starved for intimate human connection but lucky enough to find and be drawn to one another. Barry, due to the unforeseen circumstances he finds himself in, is forced to muster up the strength to confront and shut down his enemies and aggressively pursue what he wants in an inspiring chain of events.To my eye and standard tube 27-inch TV, the transfer of picture and sound on this DVD is impeccable, and certainly worth the price of admission considering that it's a two-disc set. It is also packaged very nicely, as marketing heads have probably figured out that, while it may be taboo to judge a book by its cover, people generally don't have qualms about doing so to a DVD case yet. Thankfully your purchase won't fall apart once you get to know it better.Paul Thomas Anderson is an incredibly talented filmmaker. While not exactly prolific, he has already produced four outstanding films with not one dud while still in his early 30s. It's comforting to know that at least one director out there will, if abiding history, put out movies that will always be worth the $... to see, and then some.

500851,AHJ5MWFXGGQ3T,B00000G02H,Mathias,"[3, 5]","For those who are familiar with Adam Sandler's other movies, Punch Drunk love is a reality check. Imagine, if you will, that you actually knew someone like Billy Madison or the Waterboy; that you actually had him as a neighbor or a co-worker. Chances are, against the backdrop of real life, you would find him weird, pathetic, maybe even a little annoying.That is who Barry Egan is. The protagonist of Punch Drunk Love is every lovable loser Sandler has ever played, except that here, no one actually finds him lovable until one day when two things suddenly drop into his life: a gramaphone and a girl named Lena. And he finds love and true happiness because of these two things.Punch Drunk Love is a bizarre story. It is funny in the same way the movies Adaptation and Being John Malkovich and Wonder Boys were funny, which means it has a sad kind of comedy. The humor is found in the strange things that loneliness drives Barry to do; the scene where he calls the phone sex line is so awkward that it is hilarious. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals most of the laughs from Sandler in his role as the man who runs the phone sex service; Sandler provokes the tears instead. Emily Watson shows an almost maternal affection in her performance as Lena, and she is wonderful. Luis Guzman is very likable as Barry's assistant Lance, but the best supporting performances go to the actresses who play Barry's seven sisters. They are wicked and abusive without ever seeming to recognize that abnormality of their behavior.Punch Drunk Love is the only movie that I still laugh out loud and cry repeatedly every time I watch it, and though it is not for everyone, it is truly a work of cinematic art.",5,A film of quiet magnitude,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,1686,"['who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'other', 'movies', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'love', 'reality', 'check', 'Imagine', 'will', 'actually', 'knew', 'someone', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'Waterboy', 'actually', 'had', 'neighbor', 'co-worker', 'Chances', 'are', 'backdrop', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'find', 'weird', 'pathetic', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'annoying.That', 'who', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'protagonist', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'lovable', 'loser', 'Sandler', 'ever', 'played', 'here', 'one', 'actually', 'lovable', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'two', 'things', 'suddenly', 'drop', 'life', 'gramaphone', 'girl', 'named', 'Lena', 'love', 'true', 'happiness', 'two', 'things.Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'bizarre', 'story', 'funny', 'same', 'way', 'movies', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'were', 'funny', 'sad', 'kind', 'comedy', 'humor', 'found', 'strange', 'things', 'loneliness', 'drives', 'Barry', 'do', 'scene', 'where', 'phone', 'sex', 'line', 'so', 'awkward', 'hilarious', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'most', 'laughs', 'Sandler', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'phone', 'sex', 'service', 'Sandler', 'tears', 'instead', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'almost', 'maternal', 'affection', 'performance', 'Lena', 'wonderful', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'very', 'likable', 'Barry', 'assistant', 'Lance', 'best', 'supporting', 'performances', 'go', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Barry', 'seven', 'sisters', 'are', 'wicked', 'abusive', 'ever', 'seeming', 'recognize', 'abnormality', 'behavior.Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'only', 'movie', 'still', 'out', 'loud', 'cry', 'repeatedly', 'time', 'watch', 'not', 'everyone', 'truly', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art']",Punch-Drunk Love

Mostly, they won't get why Sandler isn't talking with a goofy-voice, performing outrageous slapstick, or chasing non-existent penguins around a swimming pool.That's because Sandler is showing that, perhaps, under his puckish exterior, he has some valid talent. Declaring this performance an Oscar-winner may be jumping the gun just a bit...but it's damn close.Sandler plays a lonely little man who is constantly dressed in a blue suit with a white shirt and orange tie. When asked why he's dressed so formal by his friend and co-worker (Luis Guzman), his answer is simple: ""I felt like dressing up."" He's perfectly ready to be defensive when he has to be and his body-language shows he's on guard...even though he runs the place he works at.Such is the life of one Barry Egan, a man who does his best to have a great career and a good life. So what is his problem? Underneath it all, Egan is a ticking time-bomb waiting to explode. He lives alone, craves female companionship (but unleashes his sexual frustrations on phone-sex workers who cannot see who or what he is), and is always looking to one-up his overbearing family...all female and all his sisters. He's a mess.One of his sisters constantly reminds him of his inability to stand up for himself:""Remember when we called you 'gay-boy'? You used to get so mad!""Yes, so mad indeed. Egan ends up destroying the plate-glass inside a sliding-glass door during a birthday party thrown by his sisters, kicking it into tiny shards and then tries to talk to one of his brother-in-laws about the incident. All goes well until Barry is reminded that his brother-in-law is a doctor...but his degree is in dentistry.Such is the life of one Barry Egan.Perhaps this is why he can't find the perfect female companion to be with: his fear and hatred of the same women that drove him crazy at an early age.Strangely enough, Barry is introduced to Lena (Emily Watson), a woman who may just understand his psychosis and be able to work with it. Ironically enough, Barry is given this opportunity by one of his witchy sisters who even has the audacity to tear him apart in front of Lena with several questions:""Why are you collecting all those pudding cups? Why do you have a piano on your desk? Why can't you come have some food with us? What is going on? Are you okay?""The answers come slowly but surely as Lena begins to date Barry and together, the two of them begin a journey into an unknown land where nothing is for sure.That's where the movie does a complete 180. This isn't your normal romantic comedy. Given the circumstances, the build-up, and the characters, the film is quite wonderfully different. It's dreamlike, surreal, and just quirky. It wasn't made from the same tired formula used to spit out a million droning Meg Ryan romantic-comedies. This is truly an original piece of work and should be judged as such. Forget what you know about romantic comedies even though you have seen so many. This is a filmic poem for those who are afraid to come out of their shell for fear of rejection and judgement.It TRULY makes you believe that you can be loved no matter who or what you are.The score accents the feeling of the movie. Jon Brion's main theme swells with warmth and beauty. Hell, Shelley Duvall's famous ""He Needs Me"" is worked into the score and many will say it doesn't fit within the frame of the picture. I tend to disagree. It fits because it describes what the character is feeling. It's quirky and sung in an longingly out-of-tune manner, not only capturing the hopelessness of Barry Egan but his hopefulness as well.

In ""Punch-Drunk Love"", Sandler gives his best performance of his career.  However, this is not Sandler's funniest film, but it is his best.Having read other reviews of films on the amazon, I find more and more that many people give formulaic comedies five stars, and then give deep, great films that are dramas somewhere between one and three stars.  Why is this?  People love films like ""Just Married"" and ""National Security"" to name some recent ones.  First of all, these films are not funny.  The jokes are tired, and the whole thing is predictable.  We know pretty much the whole layout of the film.Where as in a movie like ""Punch-Drunk Love"", we don't know what would happen next.  The movie is so intriguing.  Not just in plot, but in everything.  The characters are so odd.  They have motives we are unsure of, yet we want to know about them.

It  was used by doctors to describe a syndrome of cognitive impairment brought on by a  severe beating leading to traumatic brain injury.  The ""punch drunk wife syndrome"" was  ascribed to unfortunate women who were severely and repeatedly beaten by their  drunken husbands.  Boxers sustain similar problems and in their case the diagnosis is  termed ""dementia pugilistica.""  So the term ""punch drunk"" in the title is rather  interesting.  There is the clear explosive rage lying underneath the surface.  And, there  are also the bright lights and floating colors one might see after a sudden blow to the  head, as in ""seeing stars.""  Perhaps only love allows us to see the light, without which we  are blind and enraged.  Love reveals to us our demons, allows us to save ourselves from  the dark and despair.  This is a rather Christian view I realize, but seems to fit with this  story.  If you don't believe, watch the movie again and notice that when Emily Watson  first appears there is a bright halo of light above her head. She appears angelic, and, indeed, she saves Adam Sandler's character with love and forgiveness.  Imagine a Christian theology without ever mentioning Christ and empowered by a woman with divine power to save a lost soul.  Who would  have thought?  Maybe the Pope ought to see this movie.A more practical note should be made regarding the DVD itself.

His shopping trip to the 99cents store to buy Healthy Choice pudding cups, with his assistant Lance (Luis Guzman) is a veritable psychedelic trip of kaleidoscopic colors and flashing lights.Into this turmoil walks one Lena Leonard (a radiant Emily Watson) who offers up superwoman amounts of understanding and acceptance to Barry.Lena literally arrives on the scene and into Barry's life brightly light from behind like an avenging angel ready to embrace Barry and all his troubles and to bring him salvation through the cleansing and redemptive powers of Love.The director of ""Punch Drunk Love,"" Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a film very much unlike his two previous films, ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights"" in that, with ""PDL"", Anderson has chosen to tell his story in a very compact hour and a half.

""Punch Drunk Love"" is linear in structure with a beginning, middle and an end.Adam Sandler plays Barry straight without his trademark bratty-kid antics and ultimately Barry emerges as a hero in the classic sense: flawed but deserving of our respect.""Punch Drunk Love"" is a major success for all concerned: Anderson, Sandler and Emily Watson.

500860,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00000G02H,Michael Crane,"[7, 11]","I don't even know where to start.  This movie had me AMAZED from start to finish, leaving me clueless as to what was going to happen next.  I knew that 'Punch-Drunk Love' was going to be a great movie, but I didn't think that I would fall in love with it the way I did when I saw it on a Friday night.  Written and directed by P.T. Anderson, the man behind 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia,' 'Punch-Drunk Love' is an overwhelming, comedic masterpiece that will stay in your head for days.Adam Sandler stars as Barry Egan, a person who owns his own business.  Barry's quiet, shy, and he tries his best to avoid conflicts.  But from growing up with a bunch of sisters who did nothing but torment him when he was little and when he grew up, it caused Barry to have the ability to violently snap without warning.  No matter how nice and polite he tries to be, there's always someone who tries to push him over the edge just one step further.  And things don't improve when Barry ends up getting blackmailed by a phone-sex operator after he talked to her, wanting nothing but a little companionship.  Things do take a strange turn when he meets one of his sister's friends, Lena.  The two fall for each other in their own insane way.  And that's when all the fun begins, because now with a love in his life, Barry is ready to take on anything that stands in his way.  All of this adds up to one strange and dark comedy unlike any you have ever seen.This was such an incredible movie.  During the night after seeing it, I could not get any sleep because the film was stuck in my head all night long.  I just kept thinking about it.  I was even thinking about it the next day!  It's been quite awhile since a film has been able to do that to me.  (Last movie was 'Memento.') It was done in such a unique and original way.And for once, Sandler is finally getting respect from critics.  I just find it humorous that the same people who said that Sandler could neither act or be funny are now completely backpedaling on what they said.  The acting by Sandler was great. He's so subtle in this film that even the slightest thing he does seems comical.  He can be funny without even trying.  Emily Watson is also fantastic in playing Lena, who appears to be every bit as disturbed as Barry (except without the anger problems).  Anderson Regulars, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman are also great in their roles.  Which is probably why P.T. has them in almost all of his movies.  (I have not seen his first movie, but they were in both 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia.)P.T. Anderson has been a fan of Sandler&#65533;s for quite sometime, so he said in an interview conducted by Roger Ebert.  He'd always watch his movies if he felt bummed out or just wanted to laugh.  Anderson actually wrote this movie FOR Adam Sandler.  I have a feeling he wouldn't had written it with anyone else in mind.  And I think that is awesome.  His writing and direction is really original and refreshing.  Anderson isn't out to make movies that are bound to be commercial-popular or are going to bring in the big bucks at the box office.  He makes movies to tell a story, no matter how strange, bizarre, or dark that story may be.  If he thinks it's worth telling, then he does so with his movies.  I really admire that.Be warned, this isn't going to be your typical Sandler film.  And it isn't your typical comedy.  It is strange, offbeat, and different.  Many people are bound not to like it.  It's just a fact.  This is NOT a romantic comedy, despite what some of the critics or trailers will lead you to believe.  (Although the original theatrical trailer did an excellent job of representing the film for what it was.)  This is a genera that comedy has never seen before.  I don't even think there's a reasonable category you could put it in.  Just know that this isn't going to be your typical Adam Sandler film, nor is it going to be a cutesy romantic comedy.  If you want a romantic comedy, see 'Mr. Deeds' instead.  If you love movies that aren't afraid to be different, then choose 'Punch-Drunk Love.' I thought it was an amazing and hilarious trip down the dark side of Sandler's persona in which we have never seen before.  Definitely goes down on my list of 'best movies of 2002.' Can't wait for the DVD!  In fact, I loved the movie so much, I just might see it one more time before it does come out on DVD.

500861,A3O6T4GH0J1F9Y,B00000G02H,"Michael LaPointe ""Island Mike""","[4, 7]","Right off, I want to say that I'm a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson. Boogie Nights and Magnolia are two of the best ensemble pieces I've ever seen. Needless to say, I was quite surprised when I heard that he'd done a small picture, a love story, and that it starred Adam Sandler. But that was only the beginning of the surprises, as I soon found out...Sandler plays Barry Egan, a quiet, lonely guy who is experiencing a degree of emotional angst about life. He's trying to make his business prosper, dealing with seven nagging sisters (all of whom badger him relentlessly about life, love, etc...), and yet finds himself swinging from sobbing uncontrollably to abject rage from time to time, with no apparent reason. In a lonely moment, he indulges in a phone-sex scam with unfortunate consequences. He's also buying up lots of groceries in an attempt to gain a million free air miles and meanwhile, a romance is blossoming with Lena (Emily Watson), a friend of one of his sisters. With me so far?The real beauty of this film is in its imagery and simplicity. Barry and Lena are imperfect people trying to connect in an imperfect world. Anderson gives an amazing amount of trust to the actors to portray these people honestly, and it works wonderfully. They are able to convey a universe of emotion with very few words, and the connection seems so real, so tangible, that just watching them is almost like falling in love. The use of music, always excellent in Anderson's films, is just as perfect here and I have to say, the scene in which Barry and Lena walk down a hotel hallway in Hawaii with the song Maui Chimes playing quietly in the background, as he takes her hand and the camera irises in on their hands as they round a corner is quite possibly the sweetest love scene I've never seen. An earlier scene in which the two meet in the same hotel is done all in silhouette, and the effect is brilliant and beautiful. I'm getting all teary-eyed just thinking about it.Luis Guzman and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, two of Anderson's stock cast of actors, as usual, turn in great performances and it makes me happy to see that Anderson appreciates the quality of these actors as much as many of us do. And though it appears that Sandler has returned to his more familiar genre of movies, he shows us that he really does have the chops to play serious, character-driven roles and with luck, we'll see more performances of this caliber from him in the future.",5,Punch-Drunk Perfection,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,2456,"['Right', 'want', 'say', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Magnolia', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'ensemble', 'pieces', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'when', 'heard', ""'d"", 'done', 'small', 'picture', 'love', 'story', 'starred', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'surprises', 'soon', 'found', 'out', 'Sandler', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'quiet', 'lonely', 'guy', 'who', 'experiencing', 'degree', 'emotional', 'angst', 'life', 'trying', 'make', 'business', 'prosper', 'dealing', 'seven', 'nagging', 'sisters', 'whom', 'badger', 'relentlessly', 'life', 'love', 'etc', 'yet', 'swinging', 'sobbing', 'uncontrollably', 'abject', 'rage', 'time', 'time', 'apparent', 'reason', 'lonely', 'moment', 'phone-sex', 'scam', 'unfortunate', 'consequences', 'also', 'buying', 'up', 'lots', 'groceries', 'attempt', 'gain', 'million', 'free', 'air', 'miles', 'meanwhile', 'romance', 'blossoming', 'Lena', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'friend', 'one', 'sisters', 'so', 'far', 'real', 'beauty', 'film', 'imagery', 'simplicity', 'Barry', 'Lena', 'are', 'imperfect', 'people', 'trying', 'connect', 'imperfect', 'world', 'Anderson', 'amazing', 'amount', 'trust', 'actors', 'portray', 'people', 'honestly', 'wonderfully', 'are', 'able', 'convey', 'universe', 'emotion', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'connection', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'tangible', 'just', 'watching', 'almost', 'falling', 'love', 'use', 'music', 'always', 'excellent', 'Anderson', 'films', 'just', 'perfect', 'here', 'have', 'say', 'scene', 'Barry', 'Lena', 'walk', 'down', 'hotel', 'hallway', 'Hawaii', 'song', 'Maui', 'Chimes', 'playing', 'quietly', 'background', 'hand', 'camera', 'hands', 'round', 'corner', 'quite', 'possibly', 'sweetest', 'love', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'earlier', 'scene', 'two', 'meet', 'same', 'hotel', 'done', 'silhouette', 'effect', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'getting', 'teary-eyed', 'just', 'thinking', 'it.Luis', 'Guzman', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'two', 'Anderson', 'stock', 'cast', 'actors', 'usual', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'happy', 'see', 'Anderson', 'quality', 'actors', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'do', 'Sandler', 'returned', 'more', 'familiar', 'genre', 'movies', 'really', 'have', 'chops', 'play', 'serious', 'character-driven', 'roles', 'luck', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'performances', 'caliber', 'future']",Punch-Drunk Love

500863,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00000G02H,mirasreviews,"[5, 12]","Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a successful business owner but a complete failure in his personal life. Lonely and socially inept, he longs for companionship but has trouble navigating almost any interpersonal contact. Further, he tends to erupt into violent rages when faced with his large, overbearing and hypercritical family. In desperation, he calls a phone sex line and is sucked into an extortion scheme run by an out-of-state hood (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Shortly thereafter, he is introduced to Lena (Emily Watson), a woman who doesn't seem to mind Barry's shyness and peculiarities and to whom he is instantly attracted. Oddly, Lena is also attracted to Barry and pursues him almost in spite of himself.Adam Sandler fans should know that ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is essentially not a comedy. It is not a breakthrough role for Sandler, either, as many critics have claimed, because Barry Egan is the same character Sandler always plays. But this time he is played for sympathy instead of laughs. Barry is a dysfunctional, emotionally ill, violent misfit. In this case, the comedic value of those qualities is de-emphasized in favor of their pathological nature, which shape Barry's character and his problems. At first look, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" seems to be a stylized love story for the socially challenged with a cuddly message about even misfits needing and finding love. But once the film begins to sink in, it isn't that at all. I should say that this movie is slow and takes its time getting off the ground. But once it does we are presented with a supposed love story that makes no sense whatsoever and a narrative that is cluttered with non sequiturs and discontinuities.To go into the discontinuities here would risk spoiling the plot. But this script is so conspicuously unbelievable that I am forced to conclude that either writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has lost his mind, or Barry has lost his mind and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is some kind of dream or fantasy sequence. A certain amount of discontinuity and nonsensical narrative I would write off as artistic license -which is what I did...up to a point. But the entire film is like that. I have to conclude that this story is not supposed to take place in the real world. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's last and lousiest opus, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", which also appeared to be an extended dream sequence. The dialogue was stilted; the characters' behavior completely lacked credibility; and the film was filled with discontinuities. But the dream had no purpose or context. The same is true of ""Punch-Drunk Love"". If you are going to make a film that is substantially a fantasy sequence, you have to connect it to reality at some point, or it has no meaning.So is ""Punch-Drunk Love"" a story about a social misfit given to violent rages who finds love and a soul-mate against all odds? Or is the entire movie a  dream sequence or hallucination emanating from Barry's -or Paul Thomas Anderson's- abnormal mind? If it is the former, it makes no sense and carries no credibility. If it is the latter, we in the audience need to be let in on the joke. If the elusive nature of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" doesn't put you off, the character of Barry Egan will. He is repulsive. And parts of the film were shot with a spastic handheld camera. I'm giving ""Punch-Drunk Love"" three stars only because I like Emily Watson's performance and because the film is thought-provoking in the sense that if I think about it, I have no idea what this film is about.

This song plays when Adam's character realizes he is in love with Lena and chases her to Hawaii.The bottom line is, this was a love story told in a very odd way (there is even a sex chat line involved in bringing the 2 characters together).

The idea of casting A.S. as the lead may have been part of the joke but doesn't work for a second. The lack of dialogue and the uninspired performances again push the limits of parody, making this seem like a foreign film that may be played over and over again as torture in your most dreaded afterlife, make their point quickly but again - the lack of humor makes this an exercize only in self torture. The lack of a screenplay (which may or may not be all improvised - it isn't known) also strangely creates a sense of the most pretentious art film but there's no substance in the excercize - just a one-note joke. &quot;Plot points&quot; if you can call them that in this films show complete disregard for storytelling, a loss for story is also filled up with several minutes of color effects - apparently to get the movie to 90 minutes (the first time it did get some laughs, after that it gets old).All in all it shows the humor in pretention but at the same time I think it could have been a 5 minute Saturday Night Live skit with a much stronger affect. Was P.T.A. making fun of bad art films or finding the humor in the classic ones? A good joke shouldn't take an hour and a half. Skip it - or watch it while you're doing chores or something. Paul Thomas Anderson is simply the most overrated and misplaced person in the film industry (Kevin Smith is a close 2nd but at least less money gets dumped into his projects). A shame and a waste of film, time and energy when there are so many other artists out there struggling to have their voice be heard.

I like that it kept me interested in what was going to happen to Barry next. It was a good character study, the way the various aspects of his character came out, and fit together to make an interesting, if somewhat unrealistic, person.I don't know what the car flipping over at the start was about. I guess I'll just have to chalk it up to pointless surrealist imagery. And if the harmonium, as another reviewer said, existed just for his learning to play to provide a metaphor for his learning to live and love, I find that a bit trite.The love story element didn't do a lot for me. The couple of parts that made me smile were the girl's naive awkward expressions of honesty. When she was all forward asking him out, and then calling him back up to her room from the lobby to kiss him, but those kind of things aren't too far removed from standard romantic comedy fare, just with a less flowery tone. So yeah, that's basically what I think about the film as a whole, the parts that are successful aren't particularly artistic, and the parts that do lean into arty territory are a bit trite and only served to alienate me from the plot/characters.The other central plotline, the phone sex scam, was done well and evolved nicely. Like Barry's character evolution it was engaging and kept me interested in what would happen next. But when it ended with him defeating the scammers because of the strength love had given him, it was, again, trite. That part of the plot had until that point evolved in a believable realistic manner, then the rules are just flipped and that part of the plot exists solely as a cartoonish backdrop for him to demonstrate the power of love upon. The conslusion and closure I had been anticipating were basically dismissed.The whole film ends rather abruptly too. Apparetly they were in love so there's the happy ending, film over. I really didn't buy them as in love. The few words they had exchanged during their meetings and dates really left them as little more than strangers to each other in my eyes.

500875,A2CMYX10636NG2,B00000G02H,Portia,"[6, 12]","I found this movie to be very beautiful. In fact, 2 of the 3 stars I gave it are for the gloriously artistic and compelling cinematography and fabulous quirky music. Every single shot told a bit of the subtext to the story-- the colors are intoxicating and tasty-looking. The light is surreal and dreamlike. The music is a perfect reflection of the pace and meaning under each scene. The soundtrack is probably a much better purchase than the dvd itself.The other star is for the surprisingly good acting by Adam Sandler and his excellent supporting cast.No stars at all, unfortunately, for a highly disappointing script which ulimately brought the movie down.I usually love off-beat movies (plot is not always necesssary) which are either slightly disturbing or loose-ended enough for you to draw your own conclusions. This movie, however, although it seemed to WANT to be that kind of film, was not.You learned to sort of like Adam Sandler's character and feel sympathy for his quirky, sweet love affair. Some very funny bits involved him dealing (sometimes violently) with his 7 exhaustinly meddling sisters. There were some very lovely scenes and moments. But, as a whole, the film failed to deliver.For being a funky romantic film with a highly untraditional plot, it sort of worked...I have nothing against needing to put some energy into a film...but I spent most of the movie not quite knowing where any of the characters were coming from. For the first half hour I was completely confused by the one-track emphasis on Sandler's discovery of a piano that had been bizarrely dropped off in the middle of a road. The movie had a lot of moments like that-- you tended to spend a good deal of time having no idea where any of this was going, even after it had been clarified (as much as you were going to GET it clarified).The rating is essentially for excessive language (mainly for the 500-or-so F*ck's).I just didn't connect with this movie at all.

500880,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00000G02H,Robert Bezimienny,"[5, 5]","Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is autistic.  P.T.Anderson invites us to share Barry's experience of the world.  The film tells a story, a love story, but the real subject is Barry's inner being.Imaginative cinematic techniques make vivid Barry's world, and, in so doing, give the audience insight into the experience of those with autism.  Colour and sound are hyperbolic and impressionistic: the abstract colourful patterns that interrupt the narrative are particular evocative; while the soundtrack threatens to overwhelm dialogue, and is often strikingly out of character (and out of rhythm) with the action on the screen: it is as if we are listening to Barry's own ""soundtrack"" - that is to say, the sound evokes the mood that pervades Barry's psyche, and this mood is something he (and we) must penetrate in order discern the external world (it's a beautiful touch when the soundtrack goes silent just as Barry begins to make a real connection with his love, Lena).  One could go further and claim that the film conjures a sensory world suggestive of synaesthesia (the conflation of the individual senses: i.e. ""seeing"" sounds, and ""hearing"" colours), synaesthesia being associated with autism.Anderson also prises experiences from the smooth flow of time - a truck is a long way down the road, then, instantly, it is roaring past; a conversation is at one level, then, abruptly, is at another level entirely (e.g. Barry's phone call from Hawaii to his sister in L.A.).  The movie again asks us to experience the world from an altered perspective, one where the continuity between events and between mental states is awkward, jagged, or non-existent.Barry is perplexed by his own actions and reactions.  His mantra of ""I don't know"" in answer to questions regarding his dress and behaviour is revealing - he literally does not know why he does certain things. His own emotions baffle him; they have an independent existence, only tenuously connected to one another, and only partly experienced as belonging to himself - they seem to belong not to a person, but to a situation (the boundaries are blurred between Barry's internal experience and external reality), or they belong to two separate ""people"" (thus Barry erupts into rage, then snaps back into apologetic introversion - it is as if he has two modes of being, with little capacity to stand outside both and acknowledge each as part of his complex self (a form of dissociation, in technical terms, and again a feature of some forms of autism)).  This discontinuity of the emotions relates again to the discontinuous experience of time mentioned earlier.Barry has trouble comprehending the emotional cues of those around him.  This impedes his ability to infer the motivations of others. His own face and body language do not convey emotions readily - he is almost ""scared"" to express, from fear of not knowing what will emerge.  At times Adam Sandler's face is at war with itself, little tics and ripples conveying the sense that beneath the mask conflicting impluses are in dispute with each other. Understandably, he has trouble making connections with others, and so he fears other people, especially strangers, and avoid situations where he is likely to meet new people - yet he still desires to love and to be loved.  The mysterious harmonium is a poignant symbol of Barry's difficulty in playing a melody upon his own heart.Lena (Emily Watson) is presented, in an appropriately 'unrealistic' way, as his love.  Why she is attracted to him is only hinted at - she mentions seeing him in a family photograph with his seven sisters and finding the family scene appealing, and appreciating the fact that she is ""needed"" by him, and that he seeks her out (that is, pursues her): all this doesn't add up to a convincing set of reasons for her to engage with him, but it does suggest her need to ""save"" or ""be saved"" by someone (or some family).Dean ""The Mattress Man"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is at once Barry's enemy and his equal.  He understands, and shares, Barry's emotions.  He even makes his living in a related way, as a small businessman, albeit with different ethics.  Their climactic interaction is a bizarre, brilliant mirroring of minds.  Dean's henchmen are four silent brothers - something of a parallel to Barry's seven garrulous sisters.The plague of sisters in Barry's life are literal warring voices inside his head.  One sister's criticisms blend with another's solicitations, all being similarly intrusive.  His drastic measure to silence the chorus of chiding and complaint brings a family gathering to a shattering pause - but the circus resumes, and Barry's plea for psychiatric help (made to his brother in law, the dentist) speaks of a collective family pathology, where reality is a threat, denial a reflex defence, and the boundaries porous between one family member and next - the sisters' verbal effluent floods through Barry, reducing him to a frustrated passivity.More familiar markers of autism are deployed in the depiction of Barry's obsessionality, and his facility with numbers.P.T.Anderson is not about to tell anyone any of this.  Why should he?  His film is a work of art, not a didactic tract.  Yet even the extras on the DVD only hint at the film's subject - rather than an explanatory commentary, or actors' revelations, there are clips of the digital art and the accompanying musical themes.  While I have no evidence for this next speculation, I wonder if the director (and possibly the lead actor) have some direct experience with autism - their understanding feels that deep.In the end the film builds a link between the autistic and those not so afflicted - Barry finds his own emotions, and those of others, opaque; his access is limited; the love of another is fragile and mysterious; and to some degree isn't that the situation we all inhabit?I think this film is absolutely brilliant.",5,Autistic America,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,5895,"['Barry', 'Egan', 'Adam', 'Sandler',

500884,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00000G02H,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","Barry Egan&#65533;s life has all the earmarks of an absurdist, Kafkaesque nightmare.  Plagued by idiosyncrasies and riddled with neuroses, Barry is the classic introverted nerd, a man who is completely incapable of relating to people on a social level.  Barry finds himself harassed by seven sisters who do everything they can to demean and ridicule their brother, all in the guise of &#65533;helping&#65533; him when really all they want is to dominate him.  It isn&#65533;t until Barry meets up and falls in love with Lena Leonard that he begins to find the inner strength and intestinal fortitude to stand up for himself and create a life worth living.  Barry also finds himself caught in a bizarre tangle with some dangerous thugs after he &#65533;innocently&#65533; calls a phone sex service one lonely night.  As with any true Kafkaesque hero, Barry becomes the enmeshed victim of an ill-defined threat that seems to exist outside the scope of reason and everyday life.With &#65533;Punch-Drunk Love,&#65533; writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has narrowed his focus somewhat from his two previous films, &#65533;Boogie Nights&#65533; and &#65533;Magnolia,&#65533; to concentrate more intensely on a single individual subject.  Barry is a wholly unique creation, a man who seems barely sane at times, yet who also strikes chords of familiarity in the viewer.  How many of us cannot identify in at least some way with the obsessions, anxieties and sense of hopelessness that plague Barry to such an exaggerated degree?  Despite his frequent outbursts of explosive violence (directed at objects rather than people), Barry also displays an innate goodness and tenderness that make him, in the long run, a highly sympathetic character.  Anderson&#65533;s triumph is in making the centerpiece of his film emotionally conflicted and psychologically complex.  We don&#65533;t feel as if we have ever met anyone quite like Barry Egan before &#65533; and this uniqueness goes a long way towards winning us over to his side.Visually, Anderson has once again proved himself a master of widescreen composition.  Every shot in the film helps to contribute to the strange, otherworldly quality of Barry&#65533;s life and experience.  Anderson always seems to have Barry walking down sterile corridors or hanging aloof in one corner of the screen while the rest of the shot reveals the stark emptiness of the world around him.  Anderson knows how to use his camera to emphasize Barry&#65533;s isolation not only from his external environment but also the isolation Barry feels from the dark part of himself he wishes he could reject and overcome.  At times, Barry is fully aware of his almost pathological &#65533;weirdness&#65533; and he frankly admits that he would like very much to change.  It isn&#65533;t until Lena becomes a major force in his life that he is subtly, gradually, almost imperceptibly, able to break away from the internalized demons that haunt him.As always, Anderson has drawn remarkable performances from his cast, many of whom have appeared in some of his previous works.  Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luiz Guzman all make their marks in supporting roles, but it is Adam Sandler, as Barry Egan, who is truly a revelation.  In his first mostly serious role, Sandler demonstrates a mastery of control in a part that could easily have slipped over into maniacal overkill (as it would almost certainly have done in any other Sandler film).  Instead, Sandler delivers an intensely subtle performance, one that allows us to see every facet of this emotionally complex character without ever letting any one of his qualities dominate over the others.  This is clearly one of the best and most unfairly overlooked acting jobs of 2002.&#65533;Punch-Drunk Love&#65533; is not a typical Adam Sandler comedy and it may never be appreciated by the great, unwashed masses who have trouble dealing with any film that seems just too &#65533;far out there&#65533; for their own provincial taste or understanding.  But for those with an appetite for offbeat, original and challenging filmmaking, &#65533;Punch-Drunk Love&#65533; is clearly one of the finest &#65533;romantic comedies&#65533; of the past several years.",4,offbeat triumph,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,4230,"['Barry', 'Egan', '65533', 's', 'life', 'earmarks', 'absurdist', 'Kafkaesque', 'nightmare', 'Plagued', 'idiosyncrasies', 'riddled', 'neuroses', 'Barry', 'classic', 'introverted', 'nerd', 'man', 'who', 'completely', 'incapable', 'relating', 'people', 'social', 'level', 'Barry', 'harassed', 'seven', 'sisters', 'who', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'demean', 'ridicule', 'brother', 'guise', '65533', 'helping', '65533', 'when', 'really', 'want', 'dominate', '65533', 't', 'Barry', 'up', 'falls', 'love', 'Lena', 'Leonard', 'find', 'inner', 'strength', 'intestinal', 'fortitude', 'stand', 'up', 'create', 'life', 'living', 'Barry', 'also', 'caught', 'bizarre', 'tangle', 'dangerous', 'thugs', '65533', 'innocently', '65533', 'phone', 'sex', 'service', 'one', 'lonely', 'night', 'true', 'Kafkaesque', 'hero', 'Barry', 'enmeshed', 'victim', 'ill-defined', 'threat', 'exist', 'scope', 'reason', 'everyday', 'life.With', '65533', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', '65533', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'narrowed', 'focus', 'somewhat', 'two', 'previous', 'films', '65533', 'Boogie', 'Nights', '65533', '65533', 'Magnolia', '65533', 'concentrate', 'more', 'intensely', 'single', 'individual', 'subject', 'Barry', 'wholly', 'unique', 'creation', 'man', 'who', 'barely', 'sane', 'times', 'who', 'also', 'chords', 'familiarity', 'viewer', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'least', 'way', 'obsessions', 'anxieties', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'plague', 'Barry', 'such', 'exaggerated', 'degree', 'frequent', 'outbursts', 'explosive', 'violence', 'directed', 'objects', 'rather', 'people', 'Barry', 'also', 'innate', 'goodness', 'tenderness', 'make', 'long', 'run', 'highly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Anderson', '65533', 's', 'triumph', 'making', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'don', '65533', 't', 'feel', 'have', 'ever', 'met', 'anyone', 'quite', 'Barry', 'Egan', '65533', 'uniqueness', 'long', 'way', 'winning', 'side.Visually', 'Anderson', 'once', 'again', 'proved', 'master', 'widescreen', 'composition', 'shot', 'film', 'contribute', 'strange', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'Barry', '65533', 's', 'life', 'experience', 'Anderson', 'always', 'have', 'Barry', 'walking', 'down', 'sterile', 'corridors', 'hanging', 'aloof', 'one', 'corner', 'screen', 'rest', 'shot', 'stark', 'emptiness', 'world', 'Anderson', 'how', 'use', 'camera', 'emphasize', 'Barry', '65533', 's', 'isolation', 'not', 'only', 'external', 'environment', 'also', 'isolation', 'Barry', 'feels', 'dark', 'part', 'could', 'reject', 'overcome', 'times', 'Barry', 'fully', 'aware', 'almost', 'pathological', '65533', 'weirdness', '65533', 'frankly', 'would', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'change', '65533', 't', 'Lena', 'major', 'force', 'life', 'subtly', 'gradually', 'almost', 'imperceptibly', 'able', 'break', 'away', 'internalized', 'demons', 'haunt', 'him.As', 'always', 'Anderson', 'drawn', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'cast', 'many', 'whom', 'have', 'appeared', 'previous', 'works', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Luiz', 'Guzman', 'make', 'marks', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'who', 'truly', 'revelation', 'first', 'mostly', 'serious', 'role', 'Sandler', 'mastery', 'control', 'part', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'slipped', 'maniacal', 'overkill', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'Sandler', 'film', 'Instead', 'Sandler', 'intensely', 'subtle', 'performance', 'one', 'see', 'facet', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'character', 'ever', 'letting', 'one', 'qualities', 'dominate', 'others', 'clearly', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'unfairly', 'overlooked', 'acting', 'jobs', '2002.', '65533', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', '65533', 'not', 'typical', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'comedy', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'appreciated', 'great', 'unwashed', 'masses', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'film', 'just', 'too', '65533', 'far', 'there', '65533', 'own', 'provincial', 'taste', 'understanding', 'appetite', 'offbeat', 'original', 'challenging', 'filmmaking', '65533', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', '65533', 'clearly', 'one', 'finest', '65533', 'romantic', 'comedies', '65533', 'past', 'several', 'years']",Punch-Drunk Love
500885,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00000G02H,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","Let me start off saying what everybody who's seen this flick already knows - it's NOT your basic Adam Sandler movie.  It's not even in the same category as ""Big Daddy"" or ""Wedding Singer"" in which he plays a charming or romantic knucklehead.  Sandler plays Barry Egan, a lonely Sou-Cal businessman (he sells bathroom supplies, including unbreakable plungers) who seems, in the opening shot of the movie, to have discovered a loophole in an airline promotion for frequent fliers.  Alone in his darkened warehouse office, and before we can really tell what kind of movie this is, we realize that Sandler is going to be a painfully un-charming knucklehead.  The only brother of about 4 sisters, Sandler was mercilessly tormented by just about everybody he knows.  Everybody who knows him well (only family members, since Egan lacks the capacity to become friends with anybody else) remembers the names they called him as a child, or the violence that was his only response.  Inexplicably wearing a horrible light-blue suit (in which he spends just about all of the movie) Sandler will alternate between slightly laughable and violent ends of his freakishly impulsive behavior.  Lonely, and unable to bring himself to become attached with one of his sister's pretty co-workers (Emily Watson), Barry unwisely opts for about of phone-sex with a parasitic woman who calls herself ""Georgia"" that we later learn is played by Patty Arquette.  With her claws into Barry's credit cards, his SS# and his address, Georgia sends her goons after Barry for more.  Barry, slipping over the edge, finds himself reaching for whatever he can, and that proves to be Watson's character.  When he can finally confront his tormentors, Barry learns that his strength is not in his photographic memory or his ability to find an outrageous loophole through some corporate marketing promotion, but true love.That said, there's just so much about this movie that doesn't make a lot of sense, or that could have done with some more editing.  The biggest question of all is Emily Watson's Lena - just what does she see in Sandler that none of us can recognize, and just how can she miss what seems so bleedingly obvious to the rest of us?  Barry is a guy we can all feel for, but not one we'd share a room or table with alone.  His suit and the fact that he's always wearing it (even when impulsively flies after Watson to Hawaii) never bothers her.  Yet she's been married and can have been expected to have learned a few things about men.  Barry's dislocation is another problem - since Barry's love and his problems with Georgia coincide, it's hard to distinguish which of the two cause him to behave the way he does.  Even his sisters seem clueless - they know what he's like, yet bait him anyway, as if oblivious to his capacity for violence.  (In a spell that seems impossible, they even tell Lena, even as they want to set her up with him.) In what seems like the script's biggest stretch, Barry screams at his sister over the phone for Lena's Hawaii phone number.  ""Give me the phone number or I'll Kill you!!"" he shouts from a Honalulu - and she gives it to him!  From just about the first scene, a miniature piano (we later learn it's a Harmonium) becomes an almost silent fixture of Barry's existence.  He doesn't know how to play it, and anyway it's needs some repair.  We're supposed to see the machine as a metaphor for Barry - he's not just small and odd, but small, odd and damaged.  As the movie progresses, Barry will repair the machine and his life so that they can both become whole again - even if that means that they'll both be good for nothing more than playing odd music.On the flip side - past the character holes and those parts of the script that never come together - is the flick's air of ""enigmatic"".  Well into the movie's first half, we still don't know what kind of movie we're watching.  We can say it's an ""arthouse"" movie, but that's a simplification.  In one of the opening shots - immediately before the Harmonium is deposited unwanted in front of Barry's factory - a car careens down the street and flips on its side.  We can still see the detritus of the wreck in the next scene meant to occur later that morning, but the accident is otherwise ignored, a sort of David-Lynchian event.  Why the Harmonium finds itself planting directly in front of Sandlers factory is a mystery that Egan doesn't attempt to solve - occupied as he is by Lena, Georgia and his frequent flier miles.  The biggest mystery isn't what kind of movie this is, but what sort of movie you want it to be - it's not all that funny, it's characters not really that attractive, and maybe we should be cringing at the prospect that they will become related at all.  Still there's definitely a magic at work here, and if you're able to withstand the pain of Sandler playing a more genuine loser than the ones we've seen him play before, ""Punch Drunk Love"" will prove oddly rewarding.",4,Whatever you expect - this flick is different,1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,4958,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'what', 'everybody', 'who', 'seen', 'flick', 'already', 'NOT', 'basic', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'category', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'charming', 'romantic', 'knucklehead', 'Sandler', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'lonely', 'Sou-Cal', 'businessman', 'bathroom', 'supplies', 'including', 'unbreakable', 'plungers', 'who', 'opening', 'shot', 'movie', 'have', 'discovered', 'loophole', 'airline', 'promotion', 'frequent', 'fliers', 'Alone', 'darkened', 'warehouse', 'office', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'realize', 'Sandler', 'going', 'be', 'painfully', 'un-charming', 'knucklehead', 'only', 'brother', '4', 'sisters', 'Sandler', 'was', 'mercilessly', 'tormented', 'just', 'everybody', 'Everybody', 'who', 'well', 'only', 'family', 'members', 'Egan', 'capacity', 'become', 'friends', 'anybody', 'else', 'names', 'called', 'child', 'violence', 'was', 'only', 'response', 'Inexplicably', 'wearing', 'horrible', 'light-blue', 'suit', 'just', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'will', 'alternate', 'slightly', 'laughable', 'violent', 'ends', 'freakishly', 'impulsive', 'behavior', 'Lonely', 'unable', 'bring', 'become', 'attached', 'one', 'sister', 'pretty', 'co-workers', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Barry', 'unwisely', 'phone-sex', 'parasitic', 'woman', 'who', 'Georgia', 'later', 'learn', 'played', 'Patty', 'Arquette', 'claws', 'Barry', 'credit', 'cards', 'SS', 'address', 'Georgia', 'goons', 'Barry', 'more', 'Barry', 'slipping', 'edge', 'reaching', 'whatever', 'can', 'be', 'Watson', 'character', 'When', 'can', 'finally', 'confront', 'tormentors', 'Barry', 'strength', 'not', 'photographic', 'memory', 'ability', 'find', 'outrageous', 'loophole', 'corporate', 'marketing', 'promotion', 'true', 'love.That', 'said', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'editing', 'biggest', 'question', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Lena', 'just', 'what', 'see', 'Sandler', 'none', 'can', 'recognize', 'just', 'how', 'can', 'miss', 'what', 'so', 'bleedingly', 'obvious', 'rest', 'Barry', 'guy', 'can', 'feel', 'not', 'one', ""'d"", 'share', 'room', 'table', 'alone', 'suit', 'fact', 'always', 'wearing', 'even', 'when', 'impulsively', 'flies', 'Watson', 'Hawaii', 'never', 'been', 'married', 'can', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'have', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'men', 'Barry', 'dislocation', 'problem', 'Barry', 'love', 'problems', 'Georgia', 'coincide', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'two', 'cause', 'behave', 'way', 'Even', 'sisters', 'seem', 'clueless', 'know', 'what', 'yet', 'bait', 'anyway', 'oblivious', 'capacity', 'violence', 'spell', 'impossible', 'even', 'tell', 'Lena', 'even', 'want', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'script', 'biggest', 'stretch', 'Barry', 'sister', 'phone', 'Lena', 'Hawaii', 'phone', 'number', 'Give', 'phone', 'number', ""'ll"", 'Kill', 'Honalulu', 'From', 'just', 'first', 'scene', 'miniature', 'piano', 'later', 'learn', 'Harmonium', 'almost', 'silent', 'fixture', 'Barry', 'existence', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'play', 'repair', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'see', 'machine', 'metaphor', 'Barry', 'not', 'just', 'small', 'odd', 'small', 'odd', 'damaged', 'movie', 'Barry', 'will', 'repair', 'machine', 'life', 'so', 'can', 'become', 'whole', 'again', 'even', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'nothing', 'more', 'playing', 'odd', 'flip', 'side', 'character', 'holes', 'parts', 'script', 'never', 'come', 'together', 'flick', 'air', 'enigmatic', 'Well', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'can', 'say', 'arthouse', 'movie', 'simplification', 'one', 'opening', 'shots', 'immediately', 'Harmonium', 'deposited', 'unwanted', 'front', 'Barry', 'factory', 'car', 'down', 'street', 'side', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'detritus', 'wreck', 'next', 'scene', 'meant', 'occur', 'later', 'morning', 'accident', 'otherwise', 'ignored', 'sort', 'David-Lynchian', 'event', 'Why', 'Harmonium', 'planting', 'directly', 'front', 'Sandlers', 'factory', 'mystery', 'Egan', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'solve', 'occupied', 'Lena', 'Georgia', 'frequent', 'flier', 'miles', 'biggest', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'what', 'sort', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'not', 'funny', 'characters', 'not', 'really', 'attractive', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'cringing', 'prospect', 'will', 'become', 'related', 'Still', 'definitely', 'magic', 'work', 'here', ""'re"", 'able', 'withstand', 'pain', 'Sandler', 'playing', 'more', 'genuine', 'loser', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'will', 'prove', 'oddly', 'rewarding']",Punch-Drunk Love

It's not mainstream, doesn't have action, moves a little slow, is very bizzare, contains Adam Sandlers best performance, has a little piano that is still a mystery, is comical at times, very dark, deep, mysterious, it seems boring to most people, because they want something simple that makes simple ordinary sense, some people think its a waste of time to even watch, is nothing like you've ever seen before, the special features, I'll admit make less sense then the movie, but for some reason I love this movie the more I watch it, It connects to me in some strange way that is quite beautiful, I can't really explain it, but I'll try the best I can by saying it's a wonderful, obscure, uniquely filmed, dreamlike, dark, sad, strange, moving...Ok I'm not good at describing how I feel about something honestly, I just know for sure this movie moves me in some crazy way that makes me think about life and love like never before. Anyways, movies like this I get, love and I don't care what kind of silly reviews it gets, 3 1/2 stars though? Wow! Like I said, most people just don't get movies like this. I know my Mom wouldn't like it, she likes your everyday, same plot different characters, ooo will they get together romantic comedies, well they always get together, it just happens to be in a different way everytime, so you think, romantic comedies are not real, that doesn't happen, life isn't that easy, it's just the same thing over and over. Well that was quite a bit of run on sentences. It just dawned on me I think the piano represents his relationship with the girl, it comes out of no where, she comes out of no where, he tapes it up fixing their relationship, something like that, I think he gives her the piano(his heart).

500891,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00000G02H,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Paul Thomas Anderson brings an Adam Sandler character that, for me, scored perfect in ""Punch-Drunk Love"".  A highly inventive, original and very unnerving film that introduces Barry Egan (Sandler).  He may be a completely nice guy although Barry is so uncomfortable and conflicted with anger issues that he becomes unpredictable. Anderson's tight direction neither condescends Barry's intentions nor lets him sink; only keeps one more interested in him.Done in an almost Hitchcockian-style of shooting at times (down the hallways and room perimeters, especially), the film periodically enters a state of claustrophobic vertigo.  An anxious soundtrack (Jon Brion) cadences an audible 'ticking', which targets your nerves and builds tension especially in the first-half.  I found it kind of stressful and realized midway through, that I had been twisting my hair around my fingers.Barry is awash in a sea of seven older sisters. They operate in a mockingly berating fashion toward their brother; constantly calling and interfering with work and with his life.  These women show that they have done this since childhood, convoluting his thinking, and he has internalized too much rage/anger because of it.  Barry lets it out from time to time; during this, our feelings about his violence are tested.  The character could have been pathetic in the long-run, although he was held-up in the script and with the direction.  Instead, I felt empathy for Barry and rather liked him.  For myself, I felt he seemed somewhere on the Autistic Spectrum scale, this could help to explain rages that seem to come from nowhere and are not provoked.  Also, the decisions he makes can be way over-the-top, especially just taking off to be with Lena.A sweet and sophisticated Lena (Emily Watson) is formerly introduced to him after he has made an unfortunate decision that he must now rectify.  Barry called a (900) number, just to have someone to talk with, in a misguided attempt to feel better.  While Lena likes him, unconditionally and with an easy acceptance, things suddenly swing creepily out of control as he meets the people that have construed to harm him.  Dean, the ""Mattress Man"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), instructs several people, including the woman from the (900) call, to bully and to extract money from Barry this time provoking him beyond what he can handle.They go too far...This is a stylized, slower shoot that builds up anxiety, then releases it gradually with the budding relationship of Barry and Lena.  I question the 'romantic-comedy' that this is marketed as; I viewed it more as a character study/drama that unnerves you, along with comedy that is not blatant and lightly fluctuates within the story.

The movie is very weird dialgoue-wise. Most of the dialogue doesn't make sense, but if you pay attention to some of the stuff said, it actually sounds like P.T.A. is a modern-day Shakespeare. Pretty cool, I think. Pretty stupid, you think.Visually this movie rocks. I don't quite understand what the color interstitials were, but it kind of gives the movie an acid trip (I PERSONALLY DO NOT DO DRUGS) feel. For those of you who have seen Pink Floyd-The Wall, PDL is much like that in a way. Paul T. Anderson (NOT THE DIRECTOR OF RESIDENT EVIL, MIND YOU THAT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND IRREVERENT DIRECTOR) has chosen to make his movies with an indie type camera style. It doesn't have a Blair Witch look but the camera moves around and stuff, almost like it was done on digital video. If you see the DVD and have a nice color scheme on your TV (if your TV has bad picture quality you probably won't enjoy the movie as much) or you follow the directions in the pointless booklet inside the slipcase, it tells you this:""Get Barry's (Adam Sandler) suit blue, blue, blue. Don't be shy. Get Barry's shirt white, don't be afraid to let is bloom a bit. TURN UP THE CONTRAST! Make sure your blacks are black nad listen to it loud!"" (I'll get to the audio in a minute)Follow that and you're golden and ready to SEE PUNCH DRUNK LOVE!The audio is also a big thing you need to hear to understand the movie. I recommend that if you have a nice home theater sound system with Dolby Digital/DTS capability, switch the audio over to DTS and crank the sound up, because from the first few minutes of the movie, it will draw you in. If you are watching the movie without a sound system, switch over to the Dolby Surround track because it is directed more to the TV only crowd. All the audio tracks in the movie immerse you, but the DTS has the best quality. The dialogue is mastered well but if you have a bad TV with a bad speaker(s) (PLEASE UPDATE AND WATCH THE MOVIE) or bad picture tube, please don't buy this movie because these are the requirements of viewing Punch Drunk Love.At least a 27"" TV or higher with STEREO SPEAKERS if watching without a:A nice home theater setup with speakers set up in the way the instruction booklet that came with your surround sound set.PDL, while not perfect is a beautiful movie that must be experienced as best as possible. And if you have seen the movie you will understand the first half of my title. If not, Adam Sandler's character puts pudding to a good use.

Although Adam Sandler does a great job acting in a role far outside his normal adolescent humor, the movie itself can only be described as odd.  The movie revolves around a cast of characters who all seem to suffer from some manner of mental abnormality, and as such it is hard to feel a connect with the plight of the characters.  The plot involves a series of odd twists, again outside the realm of normal life.  There are a few suspenseful moments in the movie, but much of the movie drags like a 50-ton weight.  The worst part of the movie is the number of loose ends and oddities that are never explained.  What was the point of the harmonium?  How could Adam's character be a struggling small business owner, and yet have the money to senselessly purchase so much pudding?  How on earth could his girlfriend possibly enjoy being told 'I want to smash your face with a sledgehammer' in an erotic way?

I loved BOOGIE NIGHTS, was disappointed in MAGNOLIA (although it had its moments... way too few over three hours!) and wanted very much to like PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.Unfortunately, the script is weak. Emily Watson's character is so underwritten that we have no idea why this woman should care about Sandler's character at all, which undercuts any real emotional impact the story's resolution might have. This is truly ironic, since the film is about people getting past their neuroses to connect with each other, and ultimately the film fails to connect with the audience.Sandler gives a fine performance, and I never thought those words would leave my lips, but the contrivances of the script (a problem with MAGNOLIA as well) are just too far-fetched and undercut even his work.The photography is beautiful but the same could be said of many commercials. Indeed, Anderson needs to get out of that sunny California mindset and find a project - preferably scripted by a strong collaborator - worthy of his directorial skills. Maybe he should live in New York for a year or so to absorb a greater range of emotions and influences.

500902,A22QPZWME85Z8T,B00000G02H,"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek""","[2, 2]","As a fan of P.T. Anderson films, this was one that I approached with some trepidation, namely because it starred Adam Sandler, whose movies have always inspired a particular kind of loathing from me.  Although Punch Drunk Love is certainly Anderson's weakest film to date, I was pleasantly surprised.  Sandler's performance as Barry Egan, a man hen-pecked to the point of serious neurosis by his seven sisters, is excellent and garners sympathy from the viewer even when we see the dark side of his character.As for the rest of the film, it is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.  The cinematography and camera work are absolutely brilliant, with each shot carefully constructed like a work of art.  However, the film suffers from a script that is often not fleshed out enough, leaving the viewer with too many questions.  The characters and situations are intriguing enough to warrant a deeper understanding of them through background information, but that information is never provided.  All in all, the film stretches itself a bit thin branching out in too many directions that are all only partially developed.What Punch Drunk Love presents us with is part character study, part love story.  We are given insight into Barry Egan's quirky and eccentric mind and see the composite of a person made meek and jittery by years of verbal browbeating.  Anderson effectively makes the viewer feel Egan's neurosis by showing his bizarre behavior and creating a feeling of tension and claustrophobia through both camera work and music.  We are also witness to Egan beginning to overcome his timidity and take charge of his life by drawing on the strength that his relationship with Emily Watson's character Lena has given him.  What is truly at the heart of this film though is the message that now matter how strange or different we may be, there is someone out there for us, someone who complements and completes us.  However, finding this person often requires a certain amount of inner strength and the willingness to take a chance.  Egan is frightened at first, unsure of whether his leap of faith will turn into a fall, but by taking that leap he is able to find someone that is a perfect fit for him, bringing a calming sense of balance and harmony into his life.",4,A love story for the neurotic,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,2285,"['fan', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'films', 'was', 'one', 'approached', 'trepidation', 'namely', 'starred', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'inspired', 'particular', 'kind', 'loathing', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'certainly', 'Anderson', 'weakest', 'film', 'date', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Sandler', 'performance', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'man', 'hen-pecked', 'point', 'serious', 'neurosis', 'seven', 'sisters', 'excellent', 'garners', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'even', 'when', 'see', 'dark', 'side', 'character.As', 'rest', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'shot', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'work', 'art', 'However', 'film', 'suffers', 'script', 'often', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'warrant', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'background', 'information', 'information', 'never', 'provided', 'film', 'bit', 'thin', 'branching', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'are', 'only', 'partially', 'developed.What', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'part', 'character', 'study', 'part', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'given', 'insight', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'quirky', 'eccentric', 'mind', 'see', 'composite', 'person', 'made', 'meek', 'jittery', 'years', 'verbal', 'browbeating', 'Anderson', 'effectively', 'viewer', 'feel', 'Egan', 'neurosis', 'showing', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'creating', 'feeling', 'tension', 'claustrophobia', 'camera', 'work', 'music', 'are', 'also', 'witness', 'Egan', 'beginning', 'overcome', 'timidity', 'take', 'charge', 'life', 'drawing', 'strength', 'relationship', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'character', 'Lena', 'given', 'What', 'truly', 'heart', 'film', 'though', 'message', 'now', 'matter', 'how', 'strange', 'different', 'may', 'be', 'someone', 'there', 'someone', 'who', 'However', 'finding', 'person', 'often', 'certain', 'amount', 'inner', 'strength', 'willingness', 'take', 'chance', 'Egan', 'frightened', 'first', 'unsure', 'leap', 'faith', 'will', 'turn', 'fall', 'taking', 'leap', 'able', 'find', 'someone', 'perfect', 'fit', 'bringing', 'calming', 'sense', 'balance', 'harmony', 'life']",Punch-Drunk Love
500903,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00000G02H,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[2, 6]","This review is dedicated to Elle on our First Anniversary. xxxIn BriefPunch Drunk Love tells the story of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), a small business owner who has an eye for the small things in life.  Egan has seven sisters whose constant ridicule of their brother keep him alone, somewhat unbalanced and unable to fall in love.  That is until one day when a mysterious woman (Emily Watson) enters his life leading him upon a romantic and twisted journey.ReviewThe genesis of Punch Drunk Love came two years ago, when Paul Thomas Anderson came across a Time magazine article about David Phillips, a University of California civil engineer who stumbled upon a lucrative frequent-flyer promotion.  Like Egan he became known to the entire airline industry as the Pudding Guy as Phillips had accumulated 1.25 million air-miles by purchasing 12,150 cups of Healthy Choice pudding for a mere $3000.  It may seem a peculiar basis but Anderson optioned Phillips' story and wrote the film specifically with Sandler in mind.Egan lives within himself, a fantasy world if you will, that is accentuated and highlighted by the Rainbow coloured cuts that institute a new era of each narrative act.  As you watch this film, one feels that they are literally looking out upon everything from his perspective, and can feel his frustration as both camera and sound exemplify this out of body experience throughout.  Indeed as this world that he so badly wants to be a part of pushes him to the point of rage the amplification of the slightest sound that we hear seems to justify any action or indeed inaction that he takes.Like the opening car crash that bears little relation or obvious consequence, Eagan is man looking for a reason for being.  Frustrated by the bullying of his sisters, he is on a road to destruction in which no one cares how hard he will hit the wall at the end.  Sandler, unlike many of his films prior to this point, truly shows here that he can meet that standard when the bar is raised.  He is the real Rainman: a man held back by the implication and constraints of normal living as he beautifully creates a sincere, honest and poignantly funny portrayal of a man lost in himself.At the start of the story an old organ is discarded in the street before Egan's full view.  Uncertain at first he collects it and hesitantly proceeds to tinker and fix it, in much the same way that the understated performance of Watson brings him out of himself and nurtures him into bloom.  Though it may sound soppy, nothing is ever clear sailing and this quirky tale spins and loops in such a way that will keep you gripped to the end.The VerdictSandler, Watson and indeed the dastardly performance by Hoffman along with a fine supporting cast provide a perfect ensemble to this slice of a magnified focus upon the small things in life.  Most people do not notice the world in which they live, and like the Pudding Guy you should follow his lead and make sure you absorb every facet of this beautifully quirky film.",5,THE BEST FILM OF 2003 (in the UK),1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3006,"['review', 'dedicated', 'Elle', 'First', 'Anniversary', 'xxxIn', 'BriefPunch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'story', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'small', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'eye', 'small', 'things', 'life', 'Egan', 'seven', 'sisters', 'constant', 'ridicule', 'brother', 'keep', 'alone', 'somewhat', 'unbalanced', 'unable', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'life', 'leading', 'romantic', 'twisted', 'journey.ReviewThe', 'genesis', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'came', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'came', 'Time', 'magazine', 'article', 'David', 'Phillips', 'University', 'California', 'civil', 'engineer', 'who', 'stumbled', 'lucrative', 'frequent-flyer', 'promotion', 'Egan', 'became', 'known', 'entire', 'airline', 'industry', 'Pudding', 'Guy', 'Phillips', 'had', 'accumulated', '1.25', 'million', 'air-miles', 'purchasing', '12,150', 'cups', 'Healthy', 'Choice', 'pudding', 'mere', '3000', 'may', 'seem', 'peculiar', 'basis', 'Anderson', 'optioned', 'Phillips', 'story', 'wrote', 'film', 'specifically', 'Sandler', 'mind.Egan', 'lives', 'fantasy', 'world', 'will', 'accentuated', 'highlighted', 'Rainbow', 'coloured', 'cuts', 'institute', 'new', 'era', 'narrative', 'act', 'watch', 'film', 'one', 'feels', 'are', 'literally', 'looking', 'out', 'everything', 'perspective', 'can', 'feel', 'frustration', 'camera', 'sound', 'exemplify', 'body', 'experience', 'Indeed', 'world', 'so', 'badly', 'be', 'part', 'pushes', 'point', 'rage', 'amplification', 'slightest', 'sound', 'hear', 'justify', 'action', 'indeed', 'inaction', 'opening', 'car', 'crash', 'little', 'relation', 'obvious', 'consequence', 'Eagan', 'man', 'looking', 'reason', 'being', 'Frustrated', 'bullying', 'sisters', 'road', 'destruction', 'one', 'how', 'hard', 'will', 'hit', 'wall', 'end', 'Sandler', 'many', 'films', 'prior', 'point', 'truly', 'shows', 'here', 'can', 'meet', 'standard', 'when', 'bar', 'raised', 'real', 'Rainman', 'man', 'held', 'back', 'implication', 'constraints', 'normal', 'living', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'honest', 'poignantly', 'funny', 'portrayal', 'man', 'lost', 'himself.At', 'start', 'story', 'old', 'organ', 'discarded', 'street', 'Egan', 'full', 'view', 'Uncertain', 'first', 'hesitantly', 'proceeds', 'tinker', 'fix', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'understated', 'performance', 'Watson', 'bloom', 'may', 'sound', 'soppy', 'nothing', 'ever', 'clear', 'sailing', 'quirky', 'tale', 'spins', 'loops', 'such', 'way', 'will', 'keep', 'gripped', 'end.The', 'VerdictSandler', 'Watson', 'indeed', 'dastardly', 'performance', 'Hoffman', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'perfect', 'ensemble', 'slice', 'magnified', 'focus', 'small', 'things', 'life', 'Most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'notice', 'world', 'live', 'Pudding', 'Guy', 'should', 'follow', 'lead', 'make', 'sure', 'absorb', 'facet', 'beautifully', 'quirky', 'film']",Punch-Drunk Love

But one day he is witnessing a couple of bizzarre things early in the morning -- one overturning car and a small 'piano"" left on the street.  And one hour later, his life starts to change with the appearance of Lena Leonard played by sweet Emily Watson.""Punch-Drunk Love,"" unique romatic comedy by director Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"") comprises apparently inconsequential moments that would not happen to our normal life.  In other words, the film lacks logics in a normal sense.  However, somehow the characters and images start to shine with his taut directions which defy our expectation.  It's no wonder -- remember PTA is the guy who can beatifully visualize the frogs dropping from the sky.So let's forget Adam Sandler's previous persona -- actually, he doesn't seemingly change a lot.  He is basically the same Adam, but the surrounding condition is different.  His Barry thinks of the plan to collect airplane milages in his original way, buying tons of pudding (this part based on the truth), and stubbornly is sticking to the idea to carry it out.  Like in ""Waterboy"" he moves before he thinks.  Unlike his previous films, his next move do not always get him to the place where he wants.  And in that way our expectation is betrayed.  But you should have realized that -- for you know Emily Watson in romatic comedy is one of the most unexpected casting in the recent films.The movie often seems as if Anderson puts in his ideas without thinking about coherence.  The film looks jambling, to be sure, but as (almost) all the moments give something charming to us, we soon forget about that.  Just don't follow the story.

The idea of casting Sandler in an innovativemovie about a loser redeemed by love was inspired--andAnderson knew his man well enough to write him a perfectcharacter to play--but too much directorial ""virtuosity""ends up getting in the way.  Anderson beats on all hiscinematic drums, obscuring what is basically the filmequivalent of a quirky clarinet solo.The audience I sat through ""Punch Drunk Love"" with wasmade up of people, I suspect, lured in by the advertisingcampaign.  They didn't care for it, from what I saw andheard.  I thoroughly enjoyed huge sections of it, only tooccasionally have my fingers slammed in the trunk door byAnderson's tinkering.  For example, a number of scenes inwhich Sandler's nervous character is meant to be sufferingthrough panic attacks are written over by percussivesoundtracks and hyper-kinetic staging of the players.In the end, I suppose how much you enjoy ""Punch DrunkLove"" is dependent on how sensitive you are to aggressivefilm style.  There's a wonderful Adam Sandler-Can-Really-Charm-A-Movie-Audience movie underneath ""Punch DrunkLove"", but it too often serves as the foundation for Anderson'sThis-Is-My-Movie-And-You-Will-Notice directing style, whenit should be the other way around.

500912,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00000G02H,wellwellwell,"[1, 1]","I will start by saying this: `Punch-Drunk Love' is not at all like a `Billy Madison', a `Happy Gilmore', or even a `Big Daddy'.  This is not your average comedy; in fact, it's more of a romance/drama than a laugh-out-loud comedy.  Rest assured, dear loyal fans, Mr. Sandler does manage to deliver a number of top-notch laughs in a few top-notch scenes.  This movie is quietly colorful, sometimes loud, and all in all a decent film that (almost) anyone can enjoy.  Even if you HATE every Adam Sandler movie you've ever seen.  I have always enjoyed the aforementioned movies, and I tried very hard to keep an open mind going into this one.  And if you're able to do that, you'll come away feeling as if you're time was well spent.  Sandler's acting here is by far the best of his career, and yet it's probably not his best movie.  I don't know how it works, but it works rather well.From very the start, this movie is strange.  That's exemplified during the first five minutes.  Barry Egan (Sandler) is just one of those people you feel sorry for.  He's obviously a loner who seems to have numerous struggles with women.  But he's not left to wallow in his own inaccuracies.  Instead he has seven sisters to do that for him.  So instead of taking one persistent sister's advice on a date, he calls a phone sex line in hopes of finding... well, something.  What he finds--rather than just 30 minutes of ""fun"" for $3.95--is that his life is about to get much, much worse.  He finds his secretive perversion to be something more than the kind of thing one would be ashamed of.  In the midst of this problem, Barry does manage to find happiness in someone.  She was the girl who was supposed to be set-up with him.  But fittingly, Barry's disbelief with set-ups is lost when the two hit it off.  From there Barry is left to deal with his hidden obsession with Lena (Emily Watson) and at the same time end his brawl with the aggressive phone sex business.  I really enjoyed this movie, though I think it'll be harder for others to do the same.  And I don't know how you could hear about this movie without the name Adam Sandler being mentioned.  From a production point of view, `Punch-Drunk Love' is excellent; absolutely flawless.  The way they put loud crashes and the occasional song into the movie and its dialogue is brilliant.  And noteworthy.  There are times during the film when there is no talking.  Still, the music and sound effects usually keep you entertained.Even though I'm strangely comfortable with how diverse this movie is, I did, however, find myself enjoying (particularly) the anger outbursts which Sandler's character had.  For example, the payphone scene kept me and my girlfriend laughing for about ten minutes; we rewound it twice.  Along with that classic scene, there's about four more that will have everybody wetting themselves in the same fashion that `Billy Madison` did (no pun intended).  I don't want to spoil them for you.  But really, had the director put more comical outbreaks into the script it would've lost its prominence as a true romance film.  And as a romance, it's a good movie.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is for two (probably trivial) reasons...#1 / At times the movie was very slow (the quietness not included).  You will lose focus if you have a short attention span.#2 / There were a few unnecessary vulgarities.  Sandler handled the f-words well--and they fit in perfectly with the anger-induced parts mentioned above--but a few other were uncalled for.Other than that, the movie is reasonably flawless.  The blending of comedy, drama and romance is perfect; they all flow together very nicely.  And even the action bits were decently used.  I will again make note of how atypical `Punch-Drunk Love' is.  If you saw the trailer for it you most likely were confused as to the genre this movie would fit into.  In all fairness, it's hard to categorize it justly.  I'd say it's about 45% romance, 35% comedy, 14.5% drama, 5% action, and .5% adult.  Prepare yourself for a good movie in the vein of ""good = different"" rather than just a straightforward walk in the park.  Adam Sandler is dazzling throughout; it almost seems as if he`s looking for the critic's respect (that's okay, right?... He`s been deserving for years).  Emily Watson is intelligently quirky in her all-important performance.  And even Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman are at the top of their games in their small but significant roles.  Each character has a chance to shine, and they shine bright when their number is called.  Watch this movie if you like Adam Sandler (as an actor, not just a slapstick-minded comic) and/or twisted romance movies that move at a slower pace than normal.  Keep your eyes and mind open when watching this movie, and you should be able to enjoy it.",4,"Adam Sandler fans beware... wait, maybe not",1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,4808,"['will', 'start', 'saying', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'not', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'even', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'not', 'average', 'comedy', 'fact', 'more', 'romance/drama', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'Rest', 'assured', 'dear', 'loyal', 'fans', 'Mr.', 'Sandler', 'manage', 'deliver', 'number', 'top-notch', 'laughs', 'few', 'top-notch', 'scenes', 'movie', 'quietly', 'colorful', 'sometimes', 'loud', 'decent', 'film', 'almost', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Even', 'HATE', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'aforementioned', 'movies', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'going', 'one', ""'re"", 'able', 'do', ""'ll"", 'come', 'away', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'time', 'was', 'well', 'spent', 'Sandler', 'acting', 'here', 'far', 'best', 'career', 'yet', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'rather', 'well.From', 'very', 'start', 'movie', 'strange', 'exemplified', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Barry', 'Egan', 'Sandler', 'just', 'one', 'people', 'feel', 'sorry', 'obviously', 'loner', 'who', 'have', 'numerous', 'struggles', 'women', 'not', 'left', 'wallow', 'own', 'inaccuracies', 'Instead', 'seven', 'sisters', 'do', 'So', 'instead', 'taking', 'one', 'persistent', 'sister', 'advice', 'date', 'phone', 'sex', 'line', 'hopes', 'finding', 'well', 'something', 'What', 'rather', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'fun', '3.95', 'life', 'get', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'secretive', 'perversion', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'kind', 'thing', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'ashamed', 'midst', 'problem', 'Barry', 'manage', 'find', 'happiness', 'someone', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set-up', 'fittingly', 'Barry', 'disbelief', 'set-ups', 'lost', 'when', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'Barry', 'left', 'deal', 'hidden', 'obsession', 'Lena', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'same', 'time', 'end', 'brawl', 'aggressive', 'phone', 'sex', 'business', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'harder', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', 'hear', 'movie', 'name', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'being', 'mentioned', 'production', 'point', 'view', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'excellent', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'way', 'put', 'loud', 'crashes', 'occasional', 'song', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'brilliant', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'times', 'film', 'when', 'talking', 'Still', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'usually', 'keep', 'entertained.Even', ""'m"", 'strangely', 'comfortable', 'how', 'diverse', 'movie', 'did', 'however', 'find', 'enjoying', 'particularly', 'anger', 'Sandler', 'character', 'had', 'example', 'payphone', 'scene', 'kept', 'girlfriend', 'laughing', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'rewound', 'twice', 'classic', 'scene', 'four', 'more', 'will', 'have', 'everybody', 'wetting', 'same', 'fashion', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'did', 'pun', 'intended', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'really', 'had', 'director', 'put', 'more', 'comical', 'outbreaks', 'script', 'would', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'prominence', 'true', 'romance', 'film', 'romance', 'good', 'movie', 'reason', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'two', 'probably', 'trivial', 'reasons', '1', '/', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'quietness', 'not', 'included', 'will', 'lose', 'focus', 'have', 'short', 'attention', 'span.', '2', '/', 'were', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'vulgarities', 'Sandler', 'handled', 'f-words', 'well', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'anger-induced', 'parts', 'mentioned', 'above', 'few', 'other', 'were', 'uncalled', 'for.Other', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'flawless', 'blending', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'perfect', 'flow', 'together', 'very', 'nicely', 'even', 'action', 'bits', 'were', 'decently', 'used', 'will', 'again', 'make', 'note', 'how', 'atypical', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'saw', 'trailer', 'most', 'likely', 'were', 'confused', 'genre', 'movie', 'would', 'fit', 'fairness', 'hard', 'categorize', 'justly', ""'d"", 'say', '45', '%', 'romance', '35', '%', 'comedy', '14.5', '%', 'drama', '5', '%', 'action', '.5', '%', 'adult', 'Prepare', 'good', 'movie', 'vein', 'good', '=', 'different', 'rather', 'just', 'straightforward', 'walk', 'park', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'dazzling', 'almost', 's', 'looking', 'critic', 'respect', 'okay', 'right', 's', 'been', 'deserving', 'years', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'intelligently', 'quirky', 'all-important', 'performance', 'even', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'are', 'top', 'games', 'small', 'significant', 'roles', 'character', 'chance', 'shine', 'shine', 'bright', 'when', 'number', 'called', 'Watch', 'movie', 'like', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'slapstick-minded', 'comic', 'and/or', 'twisted', 'romance', 'movies', 'move', 'slower', 'pace', 'normal', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'mind', 'open', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy']",Punch-Drunk Love

Anderson appears to have just tried every crazy idea he could think of, abandoning things like plot and character development along the way.  About the ONLY thing I admired about this new flick was that it was a different kind of role for Adam Sandler.  His character was pretty insufferable though, with an unexplained rage that dominated several of his scenes.  The bottom line is that the love affair was unconvincing, the plot developments unbelievable, and the story was uninteresting.In the past, Anderson's films have featured various seemingly random events that were tied together in interesting ways.  Here, many little and big things just happen that make no sense.  Why did the car crash at the beginning?  Just Anderson's attempt to shock us?  Would Sandler's character actually carry a phone receiver in his hand all the way from L.A. to Provo, Utah?  How could he drive a car with it in his hand?  Was he mentally handicapped?  Judging from his expectation that he could get instant redemption on the Healthy Choice frequent flyer coupons, there must be something wrong upstairs.  Why did the forklifts crash and the chair break?  Sorry attempts at slapstick?  And those are just 4 of a myriad of similar nonsensical happenings throught the movie.I will hesitate before I see another Anderson film after this disaster.

500917,AZTOAD13FDS58,B00000G02H,ZenPenguin,"[2, 6]","Adam Sandler is by far the best aspect of this movie.  That's not saying a heck of a lot.Sandler plays a mild-mannered somewhat dorky dweeb with a violent rage under the surface.  Everyone we meet backstabs and belittles him.  He has no friends, he says nothing, does nothing, has a pathetic job (he sells plungers) and life (messy undecorated one bedroom apartment...) - ok, beat me over the head with the premise.  Then he meets a girl, but only after getting himself on a hit list from an extortion phone-sex scam.Sandler discovers all sorts of hidden strength due to his new-found love.  He stands up to his family, gets the extortionists off his back and gets the girl.  All very predictable, all very expected, all very very old.  The director tried to artify the film by using all sorts of surealistic shots, filming techniques, weird pans and colored tints.  Rather than enhance the film, this fluff soon becomes distracting.  Hint- if you want to be a subtle art film, don't beat your audience over the head with it from the first frame.But Sandler himself gives a very good performance.  Probably his best acting (haven't seen anger managment), certainly his most expanded role.  Good for a rent, on dollar-a-nite only - don't buy.",3,"Not Good, Not Bad; Just Average...",1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,1241,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'far', 'best', 'aspect', 'movie', 'not', 'saying', 'heck', 'lot.Sandler', 'mild-mannered', 'somewhat', 'dweeb', 'violent', 'rage', 'surface', 'Everyone', 'meet', 'backstabs', 'friends', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'pathetic', 'job', 'plungers', 'life', 'messy', 'undecorated', 'one', 'bedroom', 'apartment', 'ok', 'beat', 'head', 'premise', 'Then', 'girl', 'only', 'getting', 'hit', 'list', 'extortion', 'phone-sex', 'scam.Sandler', 'sorts', 'hidden', 'strength', 'due', 'new-found', 'love', 'up', 'family', 'extortionists', 'back', 'girl', 'very', 'predictable', 'very', 'expected', 'very', 'very', 'old', 'director', 'tried', 'artify', 'film', 'using', 'sorts', 'surealistic', 'shots', 'filming', 'techniques', 'weird', 'pans', 'colored', 'tints', 'Rather', 'enhance', 'film', 'fluff', 'soon', 'becomes', 'distracting', 'Hint-', 'want', 'be', 'subtle', 'art', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'audience', 'head', 'first', 'frame.But', 'Sandler', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Probably', 'best', 'acting', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anger', 'managment', 'certainly', 'most', 'expanded', 'role', 'Good', 'rent', 'dollar-a-nite', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",Punch-Drunk Love
