963037,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000CZ0PVW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 8]","In ""Strange Fruit"" (2004), William Boyles well remembers the racial bigotry and homophobia rampant in his home town in rural Louisiana. As an African American gay man, he got out of there as soon as he could, and is today a successful attorney in New York City.  But when a call comes from the mother of his best boyhood friend, saying that her son had been lynched in an obvious hate crime which the local sheriff refuses to pursue, he catches the next plane back there to help.  He immediately butts heads with the redneck, manipulative sheriff, and faces an atmosphere where not ""making waves"" is far more important to live peacefully, rather than pursue concepts like fairness and justice. Bullying the sheriff into providing copies of his files on the case, amd aided by the dead man's brother and grieving mother, Boyles begins his own investigation into the murder, putting at risk his own life and anyone else who cooperates with him.The well-intentioned and ambitious screenplay (written and directed by Kyle Schickner) unfortunately doesn't mesh well with a small budget indie work shot directly on video.  With the exception of the actors who played Boyles (Kent Faulcon) and his friend's mother (Berlinda Tolbert, who 25 years ago played the daughter on ""The Jeffersons""), the acting is mediocre at best, and the sheriff's deputies are written as if stereotypical cartoon characters.  The technical aspects are not impressive, and the sound editing is awful (volume varies greatly between characters in a scene, or from scene to scene, and background music that drowns out dialogue.)  Lots of pointless, nonproductive scenes, which should have been trimmed to cut the film below its 115 minutes (The DVD incorrectly lists it as 88 minutes), and the ending is far too abrupt, leaving unresolved plot points. Would be a 2-star, but I give it a bonus for tackling a tough subject, as well as commendable acting by Faulcon and Tolbert.  Three stars out of five.

963041,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CZ0PVW,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","The opening credits for the writer/director Kyle Schickner (Full Frontal, Rose by any other Name) film STRANGE FRUIT are eloquently beautiful camera passages down a Louisiana bayou at night, the end point being an isolated little club (the Gator) reached only by a floating raft.  The mood is set for an atmospheric Southern Gothic drama: what follows is an overly complicated exploration of racism, homophobia, family dysfunction, police corruption, prejudice (racial and gender), and most important gay homophobia!  Too many irons in the fire make a film that has a lot of potential come to a confusing end: too many of the subplots and motivations remain unexplained.There is a lynching of a black gay man in the parking lot of The Gator (a gay bar where people of like minds can hide at night as long as they stay in the closet outside the bar).  The mother Emma Ayers (a radiant Berlinda Tolbert) and her ne're-do-well remaining son Duane (David Raibon) are convinced the incident was a murder but the sheriff (Sam Jones) and his redneck deputies (with the exception of Deputy Conover - Jared Day) dismiss the lynching as justified because it was 'sexually motivated' and gay men deserve such an end.  Emma calls the victim's childhood friend William Boyals (the fine Kent Faulcon), a succesful lawyer now in New York, to come and investigate.  What William discovers upon his return to his hometown is a cast of characters that includes hateful white trash, closeted black gays afraid to defend each other, 'law enforcement' that is anything but honest, the strength and devotion of his 'aunt Emma', and the mother that  disowned him when he came out of the closet to be a successsful gay man.  The story proceeds to follow leads about the lynching and along the way there are other murders and lynchings that muddle the picture until the finale when the words of the Gator owner explain the happenings: 'Nothing is ever like it appears to be'.The film is moody, atmospheric, and there are some fine performances by Faulcon, Tolbert, Raibon, Jared Day and Jones.  The problems include a script that opts for generalities and clich&eacute;s and once again a music score and recording system that buries a lot of the dialogue.  But it is refreshing to see a story that views the black gay life in the South from the vantage of a handsome, successful, gay black man. Though overly long at 115 minutes, STRANGE FRUIT is still a film of interest for the chances it takes.

963042,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000CZ0PVW,Jeffery Mingo,"[5, 8]","Your average independent film runs shorter than Hollywood productions.  However, this one is  half an hour longer than most Hollywood works.  It's made in video, rather than film.  Given the low-budget, the amateurish acting, fake fighting, and shoddy script can be expected.  Still, they could have cut to the chase better.  The script does involve many scenes where you have to go through B and C in order for A to be connected to D, but they should have sped things up.  For example, they show the main character rowing over a swamp to get to a club:  Boring!  They show a straight woman flirting with an openly gay man for a long time:  Not central to the plot, please move on!  Only viewers with patience will get through this work.This movie also steals from several other older works.  The parent that ignores the adult child is from ""The Color Purple.""  The most intolerant Southerner not being who you'd expect is from ""A Soldier's Story.""  One of the antagonists looked just like the criminals in ""A Time to Kill.""  The idea of a lawyer who is a gay man of color solving crimes may be taken from the Henry Rios novels written by Michael Nava.All that aside, the actor playing the main character is drop-dead beautiful.  Too bad this film had no male nudity.  Berlinda Tolbert, the actress who played Jenny on ""The Jeffersons"" plays an older woman here.  TV nostalgics may love seeing her again.  Many gay men and lesbians who move from rural areas to big cities may relate to the condition of the main character.  The film shows poignantly how black gays are doubly oppressed at the hands of both racism and homophobia.  This film not only shows homophobic black straights and racist-homophobic white straights, but also black gay men that do nothing to help their brothers fight these two prejudices.  As none of E. Lynn Harris' novels have been made into films yet, fans of his books may really like this work.  Though I didn't care for ""Trois"" in the least, those who did like that film may like this one.The film never mentions how its title comes from Billie Holiday's famous song.",2,so much potential wasted,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,2096,"['average', 'independent', 'film', 'runs', 'shorter', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'However', 'one', 'hour', 'longer', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'works', 'made', 'video', 'rather', 'film', 'Given', 'low-budget', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'fake', 'fighting', 'shoddy', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'Still', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'chase', 'better', 'script', 'involve', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'have', 'go', 'B', 'C', 'order', 'be', 'connected', 'D', 'should', 'have', 'sped', 'things', 'up', 'example', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'rowing', 'swamp', 'get', 'club', 'Boring', 'show', 'straight', 'woman', 'flirting', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'long', 'time', 'Not', 'central', 'plot', 'please', 'move', 'Only', 'viewers', 'patience', 'will', 'get', 'work.This', 'movie', 'also', 'several', 'other', 'older', 'works', 'parent', 'adult', 'child', 'Color', 'Purple', 'most', 'intolerant', 'Southerner', 'not', 'being', 'who', ""'d"", 'expect', 'A', 'Soldier', 'Story', 'One', 'antagonists', 'looked', 'just', 'criminals', 'Time', 'Kill', 'idea', 'lawyer', 'who', 'gay', 'man', 'color', 'solving', 'crimes', 'may', 'be', 'taken', 'Henry', 'Rios', 'novels', 'written', 'Michael', 'Nava.All', 'aside', 'actor', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'drop-dead', 'beautiful', 'Too', 'bad', 'film', 'had', 'male', 'nudity', 'Berlinda', 'Tolbert', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Jenny', 'Jeffersons', 'older', 'woman', 'here', 'TV', 'nostalgics', 'may', 'love', 'seeing', 'again', 'Many', 'gay', 'men', 'lesbians', 'who', 'move', 'rural', 'areas', 'big', 'cities', 'may', 'relate', 'condition', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'poignantly', 'how', 'black', 'gays', 'are', 'doubly', 'oppressed', 'hands', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'homophobic', 'black', 'straights', 'racist-homophobic', 'white', 'straights', 'also', 'black', 'gay', 'men', 'do', 'nothing', 'help', 'brothers', 'fight', 'two', 'prejudices', 'none', 'E.', 'Lynn', 'Harris', 'novels', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'films', 'yet', 'fans', 'books', 'may', 'really', 'like', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Trois', 'least', 'who', 'did', 'film', 'may', 'like', 'one.The', 'film', 'never', 'how', 'title', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'famous', 'song']",N/A

963045,A3RPI3E1E2361G,B000CZ0PVW,MB Silver,"[2, 2]","This is one of those films that I admit I wanted to see due to the cover photo of the incredibly handsome and magnetic Kent Faulcon, who plays the lead. I would say this film has the same level of discomfort as ""Schindler's List"", ""Cruising"", ""Taxi Driver"", and ""Francis"" and maybe being in discomfort can be enlightening, I learn the most from pain. I would echo the displeasure of others who felt it had too many plots going on, and also the stereotypical southern police force was a bit cartoonish. I found it extremely violent and probably could not stomach another viewing.but that said the story was very interesting in showing all kinds of homophobia including from the view of the closet, which to me is the saddest. I agree that Kent Faulcon did some wonderful acting, as well as Berlinda Tolbert as Emma the mother of the man who's murder brought William Boyals down from  NYC. Also David Raibon as the other son of Emma, who was dealing with his homophobia but also his outrage over the murder of his gay brother. Jared Day was such a three dimensional character as Deputy Conover, who had known Boyals as a child and was caught in the middle between demented law emforcement and doing what was right. The occupants of the local gay bar and the people running it were fascinating in how they were more concerned with their ability to go party at night while living a lie during the day, than to help out in bringing to justice the murderer of their fallen gay friend. One of the most touching scenes is where the mother of Boyals shows up to see him in the hospital after he is almost killed, but he is asleep and she retreats without making contact. He opens his eyes just seconds after she leaves. I am lucky the my parents did not abandon me when I came out and feel such sadness for those whose families who shunned them and pretended they didn't exist. I am someone who feels there is absolutely not a bit of difference between Rascism and Homophobia and feel a sympathy for my black gay friends who must endure hatred from the black church and often their culture in general. I hope in time things get better. Finally I am not going to be one of those persons who reveals a twist ending but it will stun you to the bone and send a chill up your spine and that ending was the most powerful and homophobic part of a very difficult movie. When you see the ending, if you are black and gay, I'm sure it will not come as a total surprise, but deeply sad nonetheless.

I do however have to give the movie major props for not just spinning the same old cliches about Southern racism, as well as some really powerful performances, most notably from Berlinda Tolbert as a grieving mother who is hell-bent on finding her sons killers, David Raibon as the victim's brother and especially Kent Faulcon as the childhood friend of the victim, now a successful New York lawyer brought down to help solve the case.  Faulcon is a true find: he does an amazing job of radiating the emotions his character feels returning to a home on which he has turned his back, and which has in turn turned it's back on him.The movie's grasp may exceed it's reach, but the film-makers and the leads definately deserve a shot at bigger things.",4,Bitter Fruit,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,963,"['ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'lower', 'marks', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'script', 'too', 'long', 'low', 'budget', 'technically', 'grasp', 'reach', 'do', 'however', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'major', 'props', 'not', 'just', 'spinning', 'same', 'old', 'cliches', 'Southern', 'racism', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'powerful', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'Berlinda', 'Tolbert', 'grieving', 'mother', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'finding', 'sons', 'killers', 'David', 'Raibon', 'victim', 'brother', 'especially', 'Kent', 'Faulcon', 'childhood', 'friend', 'victim', 'now', 'successful', 'New', 'York', 'lawyer', 'brought', 'down', 'help', 'solve', 'case', 'Faulcon', 'true', 'find', 'amazing', 'job', 'radiating', 'emotions', 'character', 'feels', 'returning', 'home', 'turned', 'back', 'turn', 'turned', 'back', 'him.The', 'movie', 'grasp', 'may', 'exceed', 'reach', 'film-makers', 'leads', 'definately', 'deserve', 'shot', 'bigger', 'things']",N/A
