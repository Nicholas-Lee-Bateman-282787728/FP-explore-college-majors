665092,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005M2CG,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","--Mary PickfordMary Pickford: A Life on Film is a fine documentary that gives people a thorough and poignant introduction to the life and times of Mary Pickford. The documentary tells the viewer about Mary's parents and grandparents; and we learn that sadly she had little time for childhood after her father died when she was quite young. Indeed, Mary was the family breadwinner from a very early age, on the road with an acting troupe and displaying a tenacity that few adults ever could! The still photos of Mary, her mother and siblings are terrific! Mary's story flows along nicely during the film; it never slows down to a point where it becomes boring or tedious. Whoopi Goldberg also does a great job of narrating the film; and the interviews with Mary's surviving contemporaries are both informative and very well done. I also appreciated the archival footage of Mary's films; although all the clips were very short we get so many of them that this viewer understood Mary's remarkable artistic prowess.The viewer learns a lot; I'm keeping this comparatively brief to avoid giving away too much of Mary's life story. Born Gladys Marie Smith in Toronto in 1892, she used her real name and even as a child travelled the road with an acting troupe to make money for her family at home. At the urging of producer David Belasco, Gladys changed her name to Mary Pickford and eventually worked for D.W. Griffith and others in numerous movies. At first Mary wasn't credited in films because actors never got credit at that time; but that did not last long. In the early days of silent film there were few rules and therefore a woman could potentially climb the ladder in the film industry--and that's what Mary did. Not only was Mary a consummate actress, she was a shrewd businesswoman who wanted money from her profitable films--and then control over them. She was one of the founders of United Artists, too! Just as they say, Mary was the first American actress to achieve international stardom. We see proof of that: there's footage showing the overjoyed but chaotic mobs of people who showed up to great Mary and then husband Douglas Fairbanks were when they were on a tour of Europe. They were treated like royalty even in Moscow!There are other parts of Mary's story that are not so happy; the filmmakers gloss over the not-so-good times. Her first two marriages to Owen Moore and Douglas Fairbanks ended in divorce. They definitely gloss over Mary's issues with alcohol; her unsuccessful films and her not so motherly nature after she and her third husband Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers adopted two children. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Charles ""Buddy"" Moore was one of the producers of this film; he probably wanted his late wife Mary to appear in the best possible light.Some may wonder if Mary was an American actress because she was born in Canada; but because she was born on the same continent as the USA it's legitimate to call her ""American"" and ""America's Sweetheart"" during her years of great fame.Newcomers to Mary Pickford and the more casual fan like me will learn much from this film. People who are already diehard Pickford fans will learn less about Mary and should probably keep looking for more comprehensive films or candid books about Mary Pickford from reliable sources.",4,"+ 1/2 star: ""Make them laugh, make them cry, and back to laughter""",1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,3301,"['Mary', 'PickfordMary', 'Pickford', 'Life', 'Film', 'fine', 'documentary', 'people', 'thorough', 'poignant', 'introduction', 'life', 'times', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'Mary', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'learn', 'sadly', 'had', 'little', 'time', 'childhood', 'father', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'Indeed', 'Mary', 'was', 'family', 'breadwinner', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'road', 'acting', 'troupe', 'displaying', 'tenacity', 'few', 'adults', 'ever', 'could', 'still', 'photos', 'Mary', 'mother', 'siblings', 'are', 'terrific', 'Mary', 'story', 'along', 'nicely', 'film', 'never', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'boring', 'tedious', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'narrating', 'film', 'interviews', 'Mary', 'surviving', 'contemporaries', 'are', 'informative', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'appreciated', 'archival', 'footage', 'Mary', 'films', 'clips', 'were', 'very', 'short', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'viewer', 'understood', 'Mary', 'remarkable', 'artistic', 'prowess.The', 'viewer', 'lot', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'comparatively', 'brief', 'avoid', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Mary', 'life', 'story', 'Born', 'Gladys', 'Marie', 'Smith', 'Toronto', '1892', 'used', 'real', 'name', 'even', 'child', 'travelled', 'road', 'acting', 'troupe', 'make', 'money', 'family', 'home', 'urging', 'producer', 'David', 'Belasco', 'Gladys', 'changed', 'name', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'eventually', 'worked', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'others', 'numerous', 'movies', 'first', 'Mary', 'was', ""n't"", 'credited', 'films', 'actors', 'never', 'got', 'credit', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'early', 'days', 'silent', 'film', 'were', 'few', 'rules', 'therefore', 'woman', 'could', 'potentially', 'climb', 'ladder', 'film', 'industry', 'what', 'Mary', 'did', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Mary', 'consummate', 'actress', 'was', 'shrewd', 'businesswoman', 'who', 'wanted', 'money', 'profitable', 'films', 'then', 'control', 'was', 'one', 'founders', 'United', 'Artists', 'too', 'Just', 'say', 'Mary', 'was', 'first', 'American', 'actress', 'achieve', 'international', 'stardom', 'see', 'proof', 'footage', 'showing', 'overjoyed', 'chaotic', 'mobs', 'people', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'great', 'Mary', 'then', 'husband', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'were', 'when', 'were', 'tour', 'Europe', 'were', 'treated', 'royalty', 'even', 'Moscow', 'are', 'other', 'parts', 'Mary', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'filmmakers', 'gloss', 'not-so-good', 'times', 'first', 'two', 'marriages', 'Owen', 'Moore', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'ended', 'divorce', 'definitely', 'gloss', 'Mary', 'issues', 'alcohol', 'unsuccessful', 'films', 'not', 'so', 'motherly', 'nature', 'third', 'husband', 'Charles', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'adopted', 'two', 'children', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'Charles', 'Buddy', 'Moore', 'was', 'one', 'producers', 'film', 'probably', 'wanted', 'late', 'wife', 'Mary', 'appear', 'best', 'possible', 'light.Some', 'may', 'wonder', 'Mary', 'was', 'American', 'actress', 'was', 'born', 'Canada', 'was', 'born', 'same', 'continent', 'USA', 'legitimate', 'call', 'American', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'years', 'great', 'fame.Newcomers', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'will', 'learn', 'much', 'film', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'diehard', 'Pickford', 'fans', 'will', 'learn', 'less', 'Mary', 'should', 'probably', 'keep', 'looking', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'films', 'candid', 'books', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'reliable', 'sources']",N/A

Overall, this biography gives a pretty good outline of Mary Pickford's life. One thing that annoyed me about the film was how they kept referring to Mary as being American; she was a CANADIAN from Toronto and during her middle age she was concerned about losing her Canadian citizenship and renewed it in honour of her parents who were Canadians. CBC did a Pickford documentary as part of their Life and Times series which was very good and only an hour long. I wish CBC would release their documentary on DVD.They should have included commentary from Eileen Whitfield who wrote a wonderful biography of Pickford in 1997: &quot;Pickford: the Woman Who Made Hollywood&quot;. Since Whitfield spent many years doing research for this book, I think she would have been able to give better insight into Mary than someone like Leonard Maltin and the other people who had commentaries in this documentary.",4,Not as detailed as I thought it would be...,1048204800,"03 21, 2003",2003,1030,"['Image', 'Entertainment', 'production', 'thought', 'biography', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'meatier', 'actually', 'was', 'Overall', 'biography', 'pretty', 'good', 'outline', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'life', 'One', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'kept', 'referring', 'Mary', 'being', 'American', 'was', 'CANADIAN', 'Toronto', 'middle', 'age', 'was', 'concerned', 'losing', 'Canadian', 'citizenship', 'renewed', 'honour', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'Canadians', 'CBC', 'did', 'Pickford', 'documentary', 'part', 'Life', 'Times', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'wish', 'CBC', 'would', 'release', 'documentary', 'DVD.They', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'commentary', 'Eileen', 'Whitfield', 'who', 'wrote', 'wonderful', 'biography', 'Pickford', '1997', 'quot', 'Pickford', 'Woman', 'Who', 'Made', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'Whitfield', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'doing', 'research', 'book', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'give', 'better', 'insight', 'Mary', 'someone', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'commentaries', 'documentary']",N/A
