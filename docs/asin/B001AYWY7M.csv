1169061,AL101ZVF6XPOY,B001AYWY7M,Amazon Customer,"[34, 35]","This is the first 5 star review I've ever given to a workout DVD, but I loved this one.  Jessica is an excellent instructor, she talks enough to give instructions and be motivating without getting obnoxiously perky and over-the-top.  Also I thought all the sections are effective ab workouts, although differing intensities, and I often use them to replace ab sections on other 10 minute solution DVDs.Section Breakdown:Crunch-free abs: this first section is just what it claims to be, an ab workout with no crunches. It's a nice change from the usual crunch filled routines, however to make it effective you have to be consciously engaging your core muscles the whole time (unlike in a crunch where your core muscle have to engage to do the move at all) or else you're not really getting an ab workout, you're just moving.  It's nice because it takes strain out of your neck and back and it can be done multiple days in a row without straining the muscles.  I thought it was medium intensity.Yoga Abs: this is probably the easiest workout on the DVD.  I enjoyed because she really makes you focus on how you hold your abs in different yoga poses.  Being someone who pratices some yoga I thought it added an interesting new dimension to what I'm doing with my abs rather than just letting them go.  However, I think this is an easy core workout and mostly use it as a stretching cooldown.Bikini Belly: Here Jessica uses cardio to get an ab workout that I would say is moderately difficult.  It'll get your heartrate up (especially if you get into it) and the moves are not hard to follow and jessica cues well.  Here again you've got to think about engaging your core but if you do it right its a moderately difficult abs workout and a good cardio.Ab & Waist Definer: This is a hard ab workout focusing on the obliques.  The idea is to workout on twisting and building a belt of muscles that will pull in your waist.  This is high intensity abs.Sexy, sporty abs: This is another high intensity ab workout and probably my favorite on the DVD.  She focuses on strengthening the muscles in the abs to improve balance and athletic performance.Overall, I loved this DVD and highly recommend it to everyone.",5,Excellent Ab Workout,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2201,"['first', '5', 'star', 'review', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'given', 'workout', 'DVD', 'loved', 'one', 'Jessica', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'enough', 'give', 'instructions', 'be', 'motivating', 'getting', 'obnoxiously', 'perky', 'over-the-top', 'Also', 'thought', 'sections', 'are', 'effective', 'ab', 'workouts', 'differing', 'intensities', 'often', 'use', 'replace', 'ab', 'sections', 'other', '10', 'minute', 'solution', 'DVDs.Section', 'Breakdown', 'Crunch-free', 'abs', 'first', 'section', 'just', 'what', 'be', 'ab', 'workout', 'crunches', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'crunch', 'filled', 'routines', 'however', 'make', 'effective', 'have', 'be', 'consciously', 'engaging', 'core', 'whole', 'time', 'crunch', 'where', 'core', 'muscle', 'have', 'engage', 'do', 'move', 'else', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'getting', 'ab', 'workout', ""'re"", 'just', 'moving', 'nice', 'strain', 'neck', 'back', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'multiple', 'days', 'row', 'straining', 'muscles', 'thought', 'was', 'medium', 'intensity.Yoga', 'Abs', 'probably', 'easiest', 'workout', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'focus', 'how', 'hold', 'abs', 'different', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Being', 'someone', 'who', 'yoga', 'thought', 'added', 'interesting', 'new', 'dimension', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'abs', 'rather', 'just', 'letting', 'go', 'However', 'think', 'easy', 'core', 'workout', 'mostly', 'use', 'stretching', 'cooldown.Bikini', 'Belly', 'Here', 'Jessica', 'cardio', 'get', 'ab', 'would', 'say', 'moderately', 'difficult', ""'ll"", 'get', 'heartrate', 'up', 'especially', 'get', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'hard', 'follow', 'jessica', 'cues', 'well', 'Here', 'again', ""'ve"", 'got', 'think', 'engaging', 'core', 'do', 'right', 'moderately', 'difficult', 'abs', 'workout', 'good', 'cardio.Ab', 'Waist', 'Definer', 'hard', 'ab', 'focusing', 'obliques', 'idea', 'workout', 'twisting', 'building', 'belt', 'muscles', 'will', 'pull', 'waist', 'high', 'intensity', 'abs.Sexy', 'sporty', 'abs', 'high', 'intensity', 'ab', 'workout', 'probably', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'strengthening', 'muscles', 'abs', 'improve', 'balance', 'athletic', 'performance.Overall', 'loved', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",10 Minute Solution: Quick Tummy Toners

The instructor is Jessica Smith and she is very effective.  This DVD is really not ""crunch-free"" per se because there are few crunches thrown in there, but the five 10-minute workouts all concentrate on the ab area with lots of twist and turns, which is very good for your oblique muscle.  I use this DVD, along with Suzanne Bowen's ""Blast Off Belly Fat"", to keep my midriff from becoming barrel shaped.  It's a tough battle (especially if you had kids), but by doing these ab exercises, it's good for toning your tummy muscles.As with any exercise, the hardest part is getting started.  Be patient with yourself and learn the routine.  Just keep at it until you become comfortable with the movements.

I was pleasantly surprised.  There's a bit of everything in this workout--yoga, cardio, and of course, lots of ab exercises--plenty of variety to keep the workouts interesting.  This is my first DVD with Jessica Smith as instructor, but I like the way she explains things and encourages me through the workouts.  I'll try other videos by her in the future.  My favorite way to use this DVD is to supplement other workouts--a quick jog and one or two 10-minute routines or free weights and a few of the Tummy Toner routines.

This has quickly become one of my favorite concentrated abs routines, because it is just so diverse.The segments include:Crunch free abs--a good basic introduction to proper ab ""engagement,"" that won't leave you sore so you can repeat it day after dayYoga abs--I love this routine. Yoga is actually a great abdominal workout but often doesn't get enough credit for that. Smith takes you through some very basic poses, postures and flows that will leave you feeling balanced and rejuvenated.Bikini belly--this is the ""cardio"" segment. It's not intense but it will get your heart pumping for sure, and it's good for getting a mild endorphin rush.Ab & waist definer--this one focuses on the oblique muscles and your lower back. As I said this makes the workout very well-rounded and it truly targets every muscle in your abdominals.Sexy, sporty abs--this one is your ""back to basic"" moves (with crunches, bicycles etc). A strong way to end the DVD.Overall, every time I finish this DVD I really feel like I have accomplished what Smith talks about so often--creating a ""muscular girdle"" to hold in your abs like spanx but without the actual spanx! This is not the most intense ab routine out there but it is effective and I've already noticed significant improvements in flattening my stomach and making me feel more confident after going through it around 4 times.

It is another great workout that like all the others, can be done in the shortest of time or in 50 minutes if you want.

She also goes through the usual pilates and crunch type moves, but overall there is heaps of variety to attack your stomach and help shrink it and burn off the fat around it.Like the other 10 Minute dvd workouts, you can do these routines in any order and that is always a help to keep it feeling new and fresh.

This is a great video!  The only workout I don't like is ""Yoga Abs.""  I, personally, found it not so challenging.  I've really only dabbled in Yoga, though, so it may have some benefits I'm not really aware of.  As for the rest...Crunch Free Abs- Don't be fooled by the title, just because there's no crunches, doesn't mean it's easy... on the contrary, it's quite difficult. Some twisting, turning, and variation on pilates moves.Bikini Belly- I love this one!  It's a standing cardio segment, which helps to burn fat.  This is great because it's actually fun to do, and while it gets your heart rate up, you don't feel like your going to die.Waist Definer- It's all about twisting here!  Some very innovative twisting and rotational moves that really help to pull your waist in.Sexy Sporty Abs- some of your more basic crunch style moves and also some side plank raises.  Very good.The whole video is a good combination and it's not just a bunch of moves you've already seen.  Jessica is pretty and perky.  I liked her, even though she seemed just a tad too enthusiastic at times.

The trainer is adorable and does a good job both explaining the moves and motivating you (without being *too* cheesy--I like she calls me a ""rock star""). All the workouts are excellent (my favorites are the waist definer and the bikini belly cardio session), and I love mixing them up on different days. There's a lot of variety in moves among the workouts, so it isn't boring, even after several weeks. I also love that a single workout is only 10 minutes, so there's no excuse not to do at least one every day.",5,No excuse not to fit in 10 minutes a day,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,548,"['favorite', 'ab', 'workout', 'dvd', 'trainer', 'adorable', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'moves', 'motivating', 'being', '*too*', 'cheesy', 'rock', 'star', 'workouts', 'are', 'excellent', 'favorites', 'are', 'waist', 'definer', 'bikini', 'belly', 'cardio', 'session', 'love', 'mixing', 'up', 'different', 'days', 'lot', 'variety', 'moves', 'workouts', ""n't"", 'boring', 'even', 'several', 'weeks', 'also', 'love', 'single', 'workout', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'excuse', 'not', 'do', 'least', 'one', 'day']",10 Minute Solution: Quick Tummy Toners

Each section tones in different ways, which is great.  It ensures that you will never get bored.  There is a little bit of everything included to work every area of your tummy, even cardio which I think is great!  I could really feel and notice a difference after each workout.  The instructor, Jessica Smith, is very friendly and motivating without getting irritating.

(I usually do 20 minutes in the morning).  With the exception of the Yoga abs section, I really like this dvd, especially the Ab and Waist definer workout (there were some moves there that I'd never done before and they were very effective - incorporation strength and pilates moves).  I also especially enjoyed the Bikini Belly workout - it's cardio combination is great!  And last but not least, I really dig the instructor.  Before purchasing these dvds I like to check out little video clips to see if I feel like I can be inspired by the instructor as well (there were some other dvds that I'd wanted to purchase from this series, but was turned off by some of the instructors' aura - I dont know why that was).

She gives a variety of alternatives to the standard crunches.  I especially like the first segment - crunch-free abs.  The yoga is fun, too.  The aerobic section is a nice break from the floor work.  I have yet to do all 5 segments consecutively because I'm not in that great shape.  I think when I reach my goal of doing the whole 50 minutes, I will really feel a great sense of accomplishment.
