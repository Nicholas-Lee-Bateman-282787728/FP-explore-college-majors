It would be enough that he composed one of the '80s greatest songs in ""Video Killed the Radio Star,"" but his production work with the likes of Yes, Seal, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and Grace Jones and a plethora of others firmly ensures his greatness in the British pop pantheon. While the man and his family have suffered terrible personal tragedy, his fans will always be there for him. God bless you, Mr. Horn. We will always worship your work.",5,A fitting tribute,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,551,"['DVD', 'concert', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'man', 'golden', 'ears', 'amazing', 'songwriter', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'composed', 'one', ""'80s"", 'greatest', 'songs', 'Video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', 'production', 'work', 'likes', 'Yes', 'Seal', 'Frankie', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'plethora', 'others', 'firmly', 'greatness', 'British', 'pop', 'pantheon', 'man', 'family', 'have', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'fans', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'God', 'bless', 'Mr.', 'Horn', 'will', 'always', 'worship', 'work']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[20, 20]","The name Trevor Horn didn't mean much to me - and it's probably not at the top of your pop music ""names"" list but , after watching this fabulous two-hour-plus concert, recorded in 2005 at Wembly Stadium in London, I now know that I've been listening to his productions for over 25 years!Horn is a bassist and was a recording star in the 1980s. Though his name didn't appear as a the ""artist"" on the label, he was the co-writer and lead vocalist on the song that ""launched"" MTV: ""Video Killed The Radio Star"". He and his partner were known as The Buggles. Shortly thereafter he began producing hits for others and many - if not all - of them were at this concert to aid The Prince's Trust (Prince Charles' annual benefit concert). It was filmed in what looks like high-def and was produced by Clear Channel (now known as Live Nation). The camera work is some of the best I've seen and the sound is near perfect. Horn either sings or plays on nearly every one of the songs and, recruited the original back up singers (and many of the original studio musicians) to appear on the stage. While he could have used synthesizers to replicate the string and horn sections, he chose to have a large live string section and a top-notch horn section filling the huge stage. There's even a harpist who doubles on backing vocals!The guest artists appear mostly in chronological order by the year the hits were released and most perform one song. There is Grace Jones, and Lisa Stansfield (performing a new song, not one of her hits)  - well known in the US - along with lesser known acts like the German group Propoganda and the duo Dollar. Throughout the first 90 minutes the large crowd moves to the music in their seats, unlike many US concerts where everyone stands through the whole concert. But then come the Pet Shop Boys (for three songs) and they are out of their seats. Following that comes a super-fine performance by Seal (whose hit song is the basis for the title of this DVD) and then the reunion of most of Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the concert reaches it's peak. Oh yes, there's  also a performance by most of the group YES as well as ABC and Belle & Sebastian. There is literally something here for everyone who lived through the pop music scene of the 1980s and 90. And Horn makes a wonderful MC for the evening.The bonuses don't disappoint either. There is a short documentary on the staging of the concert and another on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's audition to find a new lead singer for the concert. And, finally, a ""juke box"" option to play the songs.This is one of the highest quality DVDs to be released by MVDvisual - a division of Music Video Distributors - which usually just distributes European-produced DVDS. It's a lot of fun and highly recommended.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,The best concert film I've seen this year - The Producer gets his tribute!,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,2803,"['name', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'probably', 'not', 'top', 'pop', 'music', 'names', 'list', 'watching', 'fabulous', 'two-hour-plus', 'concert', 'recorded', '2005', 'Wembly', 'Stadium', 'London', 'now', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'productions', '25', 'years', 'Horn', 'bassist', 'was', 'recording', 'star', '1980s', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'artist', 'label', 'was', 'co-writer', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'song', 'launched', 'MTV', 'Video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', 'partner', 'were', 'known', 'Buggles', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'began', 'producing', 'hits', 'others', 'many', 'not', 'were', 'concert', 'aid', 'Prince', 'Trust', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'annual', 'benefit', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'what', 'high-def', 'was', 'produced', 'Clear', 'Channel', 'now', 'known', 'Live', 'Nation', 'camera', 'work', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sound', 'perfect', 'Horn', 'sings', 'plays', 'nearly', 'one', 'songs', 'recruited', 'original', 'back', 'singers', 'many', 'original', 'studio', 'musicians', 'appear', 'stage', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'synthesizers', 'replicate', 'string', 'horn', 'sections', 'chose', 'have', 'large', 'live', 'string', 'section', 'top-notch', 'horn', 'section', 'filling', 'huge', 'stage', 'even', 'harpist', 'who', 'backing', 'vocals', 'guest', 'artists', 'appear', 'mostly', 'chronological', 'order', 'year', 'hits', 'were', 'released', 'most', 'perform', 'one', 'song', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'Lisa', 'Stansfield', 'performing', 'new', 'song', 'not', 'one', 'hits', 'well', 'known', 'US', 'lesser', 'known', 'acts', 'German', 'group', 'Propoganda', 'duo', 'Dollar', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'large', 'crowd', 'moves', 'music', 'seats', 'many', 'US', 'concerts', 'where', 'everyone', 'whole', 'concert', 'then', 'come', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'three', 'songs', 'are', 'seats', 'Following', 'super-fine', 'performance', 'Seal', 'hit', 'song', 'basis', 'title', 'DVD', 'then', 'reunion', 'most', 'Frankie', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'concert', 'peak', 'Oh', 'yes', 'also', 'performance', 'most', 'group', 'YES', 'as', 'well', 'ABC', 'Belle', 'Sebastian', 'literally', 'something', 'here', 'everyone', 'who', 'lived', 'pop', 'music', 'scene', '1980s', '90', 'Horn', 'wonderful', 'MC', 'evening.The', 'bonuses', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'either', 'short', 'documentary', 'staging', 'concert', 'Frankie', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'audition', 'find', 'new', 'lead', 'singer', 'concert', 'finally', 'juke', 'box', 'option', 'play', 'songs.This', 'one', 'highest', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'be', 'released', 'MVDvisual', 'division', 'Music', 'Video', 'Distributors', 'usually', 'just', 'European-produced', 'DVDS', 'lot', 'fun', 'highly', 'recommended.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Legendary producer/musician Trevor Horn organized the event and played the part of bandleader throughout the evening, backed by a stellar house band. The show kicks off with a reunion of Trevor's band The Buggles, who deliver a stunning version of the song with which MTV first came on the air--effectively changing the entire music industry forever--`Video Killed The Radio Star.' I've always had more than a little love for Lisa Stansfield, and was bummed that she only sang one song. Likewise, the Russian pop duo tATu were only out for their lone truly worldwide hit, `All The Things She Said,' but both performances work just that much better in the DVD format, so all is forgiven. Other performers include Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Art Of Noise, Belle & Sebastian, Seal, Propaganda, `90125'-era Yes, ABC, Pet Shop Boys, and Grace Jones. Bonus features include an audio jukebox filled with tracks produced by Trevor Horn, one documentary on the event itself and another on the Frankie Goes To Hollywood reunion, and one of the coolest menu designs I've ever seen on a music-themed DVD. For those of us who came of age in the 1980s--regardless of our main music of choice at the time (and I definitely favored guitars to synthesizers during the New Wave era)--and for anyone with an interest in some great musicians having a great time onstage, this DVD is a keeper.",5,A Fantastic Event Captured Well For Posterity,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1428,"['Slaves', 'Rhythm', 'something', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'Legendary', 'producer/musician', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'organized', 'event', 'played', 'part', 'bandleader', 'evening', 'backed', 'stellar', 'house', 'band', 'show', 'off', 'reunion', 'Trevor', 'band', 'Buggles', 'who', 'deliver', 'stunning', 'version', 'song', 'MTV', 'first', 'came', 'air', 'effectively', 'changing', 'entire', 'music', 'industry', 'forever', 'Video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'more', 'little', 'love', 'Lisa', 'Stansfield', 'was', 'bummed', 'only', 'sang', 'one', 'song', 'Likewise', 'Russian', 'pop', 'duo', 'tATu', 'were', 'only', 'out', 'lone', 'truly', 'worldwide', 'hit', 'Things', 'Said', 'performances', 'work', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'format', 'forgiven', 'Other', 'performers', 'include', 'Frankie', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'Art', 'Noise', 'Belle', 'Sebastian', 'Seal', 'Propaganda', ""90125'-era"", 'Yes', 'ABC', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'Bonus', 'include', 'audio', 'jukebox', 'filled', 'tracks', 'produced', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'one', 'documentary', 'event', 'Frankie', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'reunion', 'one', 'coolest', 'menu', 'designs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'music-themed', 'DVD', 'who', 'came', 'age', '1980s', 'regardless', 'main', 'music', 'choice', 'time', 'definitely', 'favored', 'guitars', 'synthesizers', 'New', 'Wave', 'era', 'anyone', 'interest', 'great', 'musicians', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'onstage', 'DVD', 'keeper']",N/A
1236542,A1I47GSUZ7XH0Q,B001TIQUM4,"Wayne Studer ""geowayne""","[0, 0]","I bought this DVD for only one of its acts: the Pet Shop Boys, who deliver on it perhaps their single best-ever live performance with ""Left to My Own Devices"" -- the ""long version"" complete with full orchestra. Simply stunning! The other song they perform, ""It's Alright,"" is superb, too. But I found myself enjoying more than PSB. The opening Buggles songs by Trevor Horn and company -- the classic ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and ""Living in the Plastic Age"" -- are absolutely terrific. The performances by Seal and ABC were also standouts.This is not to say that it's perfect. I was somewhat disappointed, for instance, by the appearances of Yes and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, not because they weren't good (they were) but because they represented missed opportunities. I don't understand why Horn didn't sing with Yes at least one of the songs he recorded with them back during his brief stint as the band's lead singer. Perhaps it was because he reportedly found singing so high a strain. (Note: That's why God invented key changes.) And, if Horn wasn't going to sing with them, then why wasn't Jon Anderson there? Trevor Rabin had to sing lead instead. Two strikes with one act. As for Frankie, the young dude who filled in for the absent Holly Johnson did an marvelous job, but it was incongruous, to say the least, and ultimately disappointing. I mean, a Frankie reunion without Johnson is like a Beatles reunion without John or Paul. Most of the other acts are enjoyable enough, but they didn't really stand out in any way for me. (Sorry, Grace.)To summarize, if you're a fan of the Pet Shop Boys and/or of Horn himself, this is ESSENTIAL and worth every penny.
