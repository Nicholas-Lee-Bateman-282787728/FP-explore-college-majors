810825,AFITDZEWKJKAM,B0001MDPIG,D. Keating,"[6, 7]","I really enjoyed Switchfoot's CD ""The Beautiful Letdown"". It is ground breaking album for this up and coming band. Unfortunately, this DVD does not do the best job of representing the band's efforts. As others have noted the sound quality is not great, and the video footage does not capture much of the band's energy. Simply put - it is somewhat boring to watch.On the positive side, the song list from the concert does include all the best songs from ""The Beautiful Letdown"". But, I was disappointed that there was not more extra material beyond the concert. There are a few short interviews, and a video, but nothing more. Therefore, I recommend that listeners stick with the CD, it is much better than this DVD.",3,The album is better than this DVD,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,715,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Switchfoot', 'CD', 'Beautiful', 'Letdown', 'ground', 'breaking', 'album', 'up', 'coming', 'band', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'not', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'representing', 'band', 'efforts', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'video', 'footage', 'not', 'capture', 'much', 'band', 'energy', 'Simply', 'put', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'watch.On', 'positive', 'side', 'song', 'list', 'concert', 'include', 'best', 'songs', 'Beautiful', 'Letdown', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'extra', 'material', 'concert', 'are', 'few', 'short', 'interviews', 'video', 'nothing', 'more', 'Therefore', 'recommend', 'listeners', 'stick', 'CD', 'much', 'better', 'DVD']",N/A
810826,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0001MDPIG,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[0, 0]","Switchfoot is simply outstanding in this concert dvd. This concert features songs from their breakthrough album CD ""The Beautiful Letdown"". This album had songs that crossed over into the mainstream ""Pop"" music scene. Some highlights include the ""smash hits"" - ""Meant to Live"", ""Dare You to Move"", ""More Than Fine"", & ""Gone"". It consists of 11 total songs with an approximate running time of 68 minutes. During the concert the band ""testifies"" about how great it is to be ""saved"". I can definitely related to this because, I am a Christian, and I'm very thankful to be ""saved"".Plus, You get substantial bonus material including the ""Meant to Live"" Music Video, and ""Behind the Scenes"" material. I highly recommend this concert dvd, plus the related ones by ""Contemporary Christian Rock Bands"" of ""Jars of Clay"", ""Stryper"" and ""Third Day"". Switchfoot has toured with some of these other bands and they are included in the lastest DVD/CD Combo of Third Day's ""Live Revelations"" Tour (Please See My Review of That One Also).

It could have been louder. Also, Redemption wasn't in it. Redemption is one of their best songs. Sometimes the energy of the concert was great, sometimes it went down a little. I would reccomend this if your a huge fan, but if you just like the music, go for the CDs.",4,"Great, but Could Have Been A Bit Better",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,383,"['liked', 'am', 'Switchfoot', 'fan', 'so', 'should', 'did', 'however', 'find', 'sound', 'qualits', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'louder', 'Also', 'Redemption', 'was', ""n't"", 'Redemption', 'one', 'best', 'songs', 'Sometimes', 'energy', 'concert', 'was', 'great', 'went', 'down', 'little', 'would', 'reccomend', 'huge', 'fan', 'just', 'music', 'go', 'CDs']",N/A
