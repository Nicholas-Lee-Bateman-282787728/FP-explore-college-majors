And that the acting, especially of the &#34;old folks&#34; - Santa and Mrs. C - is so, so, so, very BAD?  Wow.  This one is a rock, of the catastrophic, mega-meteor, gonna-hit-the-earth-and-decimate-it type.  Really bad.  The positively nauseating giddiness of the parents!  The false deer-in-the-headlights cluelessness of the girlfriend!  The Jr. Claus' what-am-I-to-do namby-pamby act.  Wow - or wow or maybe just &#34;w&#34;.  And yes, the living-together-thing is immoral.  But that's today's world...and if it's not that aspect, it's the absolutely appalling clothing, or almost clothed-ness, of the females in almost everything that's available - which by the way - doesn't seem to be taken into account for the ratings.  And it should be...another pet peeve.

1659565,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B00DNF1RAQ,christmas lover,"[8, 8]",This is a very good and funny Christmas movie about a guy who is Santa Clauss son getting engaged to his girlfriend and trying to hide his parents true identity from her still. Things really get out of hand when her parents meet them and everyone in her family-except her son-thinks his family is either way too conventional or nuts.
