1169212,AL101ZVF6XPOY,B001AZI236,Amazon Customer,"[32, 35]","This workout was great.  I completed it about 15 minutes ago and I can definitely feel it right now.  The workout is broken into 5 10-minute segments which is a format that I love as it means you can break it down for a shorter workout and even if you do the whole thing is doesn't feel like an eternity because of the changing segments.  The general idea is to do strengthening exercises followed by stretches to lengthen the muscles.Overview of the segments:Arms: this was probably my least favorite segment.  I prefer the arms segment on 10 minute solutions pilates perfect body.  It was about 6-7 minutes of arms work and then 3-4 of stretching the arms.  It felt rushed and the cueing seemed a little off.  Also, I just didn't find it very hard.  For this segment you need light handweights.Thighs: this segment was excellent.  They claim you need a chair to do these excercises however if you have reasonably strong thighs and good balance it's not necessary.  These exercises make you feel your thighs, mine started shaking like crazy at one point and are really effective.Glutes: I think this was the hardest segment on the DVD.  I really like that they had a segment devoted especially to glutes, a lot of video through them in with thighs and I don't think they work very hard.  In this segment you're glutes will work hard, and a chair is an absolute necessity.  I had to take several breaks during it but am looking forward to working up to the full segment.Abs: I'm glad this segment was short because although it was good work for the abs it was a bit boring.  You put your feet up on the wall and hold yourself in a sit-up position (don't think this sounds hard? neither did I but try doing it for about 8 minutes) and then do variations from there. Not my favorite ab workout but effective, I definitely felt my abs straining.Stretch:  I really like it when DVDs have a specific long segment devoted to stretching.  That said, this was not my favorite stretching segment.  I wish the stretches had been held a little less long and there had been more different stretches.  It ended and I still felt the need to do some other stretches to really feel stretched out.  But the stretches they did were good, and there's something to be said for holding them for so long and really makin your body relax into the stretch.Overall, I definitely recommend purchasing this video.  It's a really effective workout and I certainly liked all the segments enough to continue doing them even if they weren't my favorite.  Also I really liked that they had two instructors, a man and a woman, and showed simpler variations of many of the moves, including when it was best to rest if you needed it.  One con I haven't mentioned yet (and this is a personal preference thing) is that the instruction is voice-over which is not my favorite and I sometimes felt like the cueing was not right on.

When I first put this DVD in and was watching it I was thinking ""oh, this is too easy"" and I also found it a bit irritating that their instruction is voiced over rather than them talking live while they're doing the exercises.

This is a great workout that goes by quickly and will challenge your muscles immediately, I like it especially because sometimes I'm just not in the mood to do cardio which all my other DVDs (except my pilates DVD) have.

1169218,A16NQF4IUGU29B,B001AZI236,Beachbabe1984,"[13, 15]","I just started using this DVD a few weeks ago and it is fantastic!  It has helped me take inches off my thighs and butt that I couldn't lose before.  It's composed of five10-minute sections:  arms & shoulders, thighs, butt, abs, and stretch.  The exercises use small movements with lots of reps - your muscles stay in a working zone through most of the 10 minutes, so you really feel a deep burn by the end. The two instructors are wonderful at encouraging you to keep moving through the burning sensation.  Having two of them is great since throughout the workout, they are always demonstrating beginner and advanced modifications.The arms and shoulders section requires some light hand weights (5lbs was too much for me.  It seems to be inspired by classical strength training moves, but given a bit of a twist.  The thighs and the butt segments use a chair as a barre for some ballet-inspired exercises - these sections are difficult, but really produce results.  The ab workout is also challenging.  My only issue was that it requires you to brace your feet on a wall, which in my apartment, does not allow me to watch the TV.  Though using a voiceover prevents wasted time in this DVD, there are times where the cuing is lacking.  They often make subtle changes to their movements and don't mention it on the voiceover.  This means you sometimes need to sacrifice your position to make sure you're still keeping up with them.This program provides something a little different from most workout DVDs of this type.  It seems to be a very effective and challenging mix of training styles.  Best of all, it leaves you feeling relaxed and energized, not strained (well, you'll be sore the next day...).

1169219,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B001AZI236,Colleen M. Schneider,"[7, 8]","I do a lot of workouts and was interested in seeing what Core Fusion would bring to the table...Well, in this dvd you get 5 10 minute work-outs which gives you the freedom to do one long work-out that works several muscle groups, or just pick which body part you would like to work on.  This is nice when time is limited.  Now, 10 minutes does not sound like a lot, and according to the clock it isn't a lot of time, but when you are working on holding core poses for this long, or working your arms or glutes, 10 minutes seems like a loooooong time.  What I like about this dvd is it features very easy to follow exercises that are very concentrated and effective.  If you have done ballet or other dance you recognize the plies done in the leg toning and you will recognize some pilates moves in the ab section. You get in, you work the muscle, stretch it out and you are on to the next series.  The music in the background is not distracting and the instructors are good, showing you variations where applicable.  The set is relaxing and softly lit.The total run time of the dvd is 50 minutes and is comprised of the following:ArmsLegsGlutesAbsStretchI did them all and felt like I got a nice all over toning workout.  For the arm section, you will need weights (I used 3 lb.) I would say for this section 2-5 lbs. would be fine.You may also want a yoga mat for the floor poses if your floor is not carpeted. Other than that you will be using your own body's resistance to work the poses.I would definitely look into more in this series. Good, effective toning/sculpting exercises in a well put together routine with two excellent instructors.",5,"burn baby, burn.....",1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,1646,"['do', 'lot', 'workouts', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'would', 'bring', 'table', 'Well', 'dvd', 'get', '5', '10', 'minute', 'work-outs', 'freedom', 'do', 'one', 'long', 'work-out', 'several', 'muscle', 'groups', 'just', 'pick', 'body', 'part', 'would', 'like', 'work', 'nice', 'when', 'time', 'limited', 'Now', '10', 'minutes', 'not', 'sound', 'lot', 'according', 'clock', ""n't"", 'lot', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'working', 'holding', 'core', 'poses', 'long', 'working', 'arms', 'glutes', '10', 'minutes', 'loooooong', 'time', 'What', 'like', 'dvd', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'exercises', 'are', 'very', 'concentrated', 'effective', 'have', 'done', 'ballet', 'other', 'dance', 'recognize', 'plies', 'done', 'leg', 'toning', 'will', 'recognize', 'pilates', 'moves', 'ab', 'section', 'get', 'work', 'muscle', 'stretch', 'out', 'are', 'next', 'series', 'music', 'background', 'not', 'distracting', 'instructors', 'are', 'good', 'showing', 'variations', 'where', 'applicable', 'set', 'relaxing', 'softly', 'lit.The', 'total', 'run', 'time', 'dvd', '50', 'minutes', 'comprised', 'following', 'ArmsLegsGlutesAbsStretchI', 'did', 'felt', 'got', 'nice', 'toning', 'workout', 'arm', 'section', 'will', 'need', 'weights', 'used', '3', 'lb', 'would', 'say', 'section', '2-5', 'lbs', 'would', 'be', 'fine.You', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'yoga', 'mat', 'floor', 'floor', 'not', 'carpeted', 'Other', 'will', 'be', 'using', 'own', 'body', 'resistance', 'work', 'poses.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'look', 'more', 'series', 'Good', 'effective', 'toning/sculpting', 'exercises', 'well', 'together', 'routine', 'two', 'excellent', 'instructors']",Exhale: Core Fusion - Body Sculpt

I really didnt overly like this video at all. The best pro about this one was the set, which was absolutely beautiful. The second pro was the stretch sequence, it was a pretty good sequence. The rest of it, was very slow and dull. My mind drifted a lot during the DVD. And if you are drifting you are not concentrating on the muscles being used, so it kind of becomes pointless.

1169230,A846NR0T5U8GT,B001AZI236,Gia V.,"[3, 7]","I'm not a fan of yoga and actually refuse to do it, so many of the yoga inspired moves I just shrugged them off. These were, however, toward the end in the stretching portion where they were talking about shivasna or something strange like that, so the overall exercises are, in my opinion, not yoga at all. The exercises are not difficult in their execution, but their repetitions are what really makes you feel the burn. There is a certain ab-exercise that really takes a lot of effort in order to maintain the position and then ad the movements, and they extend it for a super long period of time so that it becomes even more difficult. Overall, I got through all 5 10-minute segments even though I had to stop and catch my breath or stop the intense muscle burn numerous times (I'm an advanced beginner in exercising, if there is such a stage). I feel good, but I don't feel 'dead' as some other exercise videos leave me afterwards (here's looking at you Jillian Michaels...). I do, however, feel some discomfort on my back from a glute exercise which required a back leg lift. I don't know if it's because I did not warm up properly (their warm up consists of a 'power walk' basically for 60 seconds), or if I did not have proper form. Either way, I'm hoping it'll go away by tomorrow, and if not then I don't plan on doing that specific move again. There is no soreness as of yet, but we'll see tomorrow. I plan on doing the pilates plus tomorrow and the thighs and glutes and abs and arms later on during the week, so reviews for those will be available later on.EDIT: Definitely felt the burn the next day on arms, butt and lower back (the lower back issue was resolved, now it just feels like a muscle that hasn't been worked in a long time that was just worked should feel). I didn't get anything from the core, but I compensated by doing Jillian Michaels' Trouble Zones dvd and picking just the ab/core segments.

But I really do enjoy this one as well.Upper body: I tend to neglect my upper body in my workouts, so the idea of a 10 minute routine that I can easily fit in, and covers all the major muscles, is great for me.  If you are looking for a power workout (like Cathe Friedrich) then maybe you won't like this. But really, if you are pressed for time it is great.  Just increase the weight if you need to make it more difficult.  I started with 3 lb weights, but quickly moved up to 5 lb. Will increase weight if it gets easy!Ab routine:  If you are new to working out your abs, or aren't very strong there, this might be too difficult for you.  I was at a moderate level for traditional ab workouts and found this one just a little intense.  So, I went to the routine on the Pilates Plus DVD first, and then once I was comfortable with their style, I went back to the one on this DVD.  Also, if you are looking for a ton of crunches, and aren't open to new ideas, you won't like this. It is all about holding the crunch...for a long time.  But I can tell you, I never saw much difference in my abs from traditional workouts but have noticed a huge difference with the Core Fusion routines.Stretch:  I really like the Core Fusion stretch routines. This one hits the back of the legs nicely, as well as lower back.  When I was younger I wasn't that into stretching, but now that I'm in my 40's I really am.Thighs: Didn't try this one as I'm in physical therapy for my knee and don't want to complicate things.Glutes:  I will admit that I didn't always really feel comfortable with this routine. When they did the bent leg moves I felt like I was doing something wrong.

Exercises are strong on authentic Lotte Berk since that was a significant part of this couple's background, with additions from Pilates, yoga and classical weight training.  They do an excellent job of talking you through the exercises, explaining what it will do for your body, thereby keeping you motivated from a positive place, which is so much nicer than the commonly used negative motivational techniques where somebody is screaming you through a breakneck pace.  They have you concentrate on how your body is feeling the exercise, stopping momentarily if you need to, then picking it up again - instead of counting monotonous repetitions for you.  This approach is so much more pleasant and sensible.  The workout is muscle toning, organized as interval training.  Interval training has been proven by medical research to be much preferred for promoting fat loss and heart reserve capacity, instead of long term cardio.  The pacing promotes the mind-body connection and focus, which reminds me of my ballet training from years ago, or hatha yoga.  You have a chance to breathe and think during the exercises, without feeling additional stress due to the exercising.  Much appreciated after a hectic day at work.The video had a warm, intimate, personal trainer feel to it with the husband and wife team demonstrating the exercises together and instructing by means of a voiceover.  They alternated showing the advanced version of an exercise and clearly indicated which person you should watch if that's the level you wanted.  Setting is what I call ""New Age living room,"" lovely d&eacute;cor, warm earthtones, water feature, and subdued lighting, plenty of camera shots from various angles.  Music so unobtrusive I didn't even notice what it was, although there is a music only option in the special features after you get tired of the instructional.  My husband really liked the fact that a man was showing the exercises also - funny how the same movement can look a little different on a man.  He also liked the fact that it was a husband and wife team instead of a group of women.  We're pressed for time, like to do things together, and this video fills the bill nicely.  No more scheduling TV time for mutually exclusive workouts.  Top quality production, first class all the way.

Plus an additional 10 minute bonus track.2) The exercises do not require a lot of exotic gear. They target muscles in a way no other workout I have tried3) I do all 5 segments and they fly by4) Each series is followed by much needed, too often overlooked, stretching. The 5th segment is just straight up stretching.5) After one workout my physical therapist could tell a difference in my muscle tone/definition.

Sarah,"[9, 10]","A former cardio-only girl, I've recently seen the light of Lotte Berk/barre-style workouts and how magnificently they can compliment my usual running routine. Runner girls, if you're reading this, I STRONGLY recommend adding this kind of body-weight strength training to your rotation; a stronger core VASTLY improves your running, and it's really quite nice to get definition in your abs and arms.This DVD has absolutely everything I want in it. The arms set is spectacular, and the gluteal and leg work is also phenomenal. My only gripe is that you need to have an immediately accessible wall for the ab work (something that's a little tricky to do when you have a very tightly-packed dorm room), but once you can get that all figured out it's quite challenging. The stretching segment at the end is the most incredible thing ever. I always hate hate HATE it when I don't feel like I've stretched sufficiently (and, from what I understand, barre-style workouts hinge on a good stretch to keep the muscles from getting to governator-y), but Core Fusion leaves me completely satisfied. I even do the stretch segment in the morning as a standalone routine when I feel like I need a pick-me-up.Liz and Fred are great instructors. The cuing is fantastic, and both of their demeanors are very calming and go well with the new age-y set. It's also absolutely adorable that they're married!The final awesome thing about this DVD is that it's really accessible. I'm probably the most awkward person alive and I manage to feel graceful doing it. My mom, who's just getting back into fitness, did the DVD with me a few days ago and found it challenging but doable. You're not going to feel spent after this workout, and that's the point.

I normally don't expect too much out of a workout video, ya know sometimes there is a lot of talk and no work out or too fancy of equipment used or too difficult of moves, but this kicked my sister's and my butt! It was so easy, the moves I mean, but you feel it! I love how fast they move in and out of the workouts. They don't talk, they just move nicely in and out of each workout, that last 5mins each. So arms, abs, legs, etc. are all done in a 5 min. session and the trainers do the exercises while someone narrates it. I actually like this. I feel the exercises move alone faster, hence the 5 min. sessions. I was sore as heck the next day. The leg session is intense lol. I was shaking for sure. I loved the ab session. One of my favorite ways I've ever done, or ever seen done. The way they did it is great. You hold your legs up against a wall and I find this excellent in order for you to keep your form.

So I rented this one (body sculpt) and I LOVE IT!  I am going to keep it until my Amazon order arrives later on this week. I have had the DVD for 4 days and I have done at least 2 10-min. segments each day and I cannot believe the difference I already can see and feel! No weight loss yet, but definate toning is evident immediatly!  I have a habit of ordering exercise videos and never doing them more than a handful of times b/c I simply do not see results quick enough so I get bored and quit. I love the short 10 min segments; its hard to get exercises in with 2 small children at home, so 10 - 20 min a day is SO DOABLE!!!  The music and the fact they don't talk ( just a voice over) is a little weird at first, but they certainly are not annoying and the exercises are very to the point.

1169257,AMD4ZRWBQL6EP,B001AZI236,Tamara,"[2, 2]","I have every single Core Fusion DVD, and I love them all, although they are each a little different.  Body Sculpt and Long and Lean are both full body workouts, the latter a little more challenging than the former.  Both Arms and Abs and Thighs and Glutes are self-explanatory.  Pilates Plus focuses on abs/core work.  And the yoga Energy Flow and the Bootcamp DVDs are cardio workouts, the latter more challenging than the former, although both are quite rigorous and will make you sweat buckets.  I have taken both Pilates Mat and Pilates Fusion classes for a few years, and these DVDs are a wonderful complement when I am not in class, and in my opinion, are sometimes even more challenging than what I get in my exercise classes.  I have tried a number of different exercise DVDs over the years, and these are the only ones I have ever stuck with.  They are very enjoyable, challenging (but not so challenging that you give up), invigorating, interesting (they do not get boring because there is so much variety built in), and I have noticed some subtle differences in my body from my work with both the DVDs and my classes.  To really burn fat, though, you have to alter your diet. These DVDs will help with sculpting muscle (like a ballet dancer's body), but not so much with fat loss (at least I have always found that my weight loss occurs with diet and not with exercise, but that's just me.)

1169258,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B001AZI236,T. Carr,"[6, 6]","I've tried several of the dvds in the Core Fusion series and they are all fantastic. ThePilates Plusdvd is my favorite but this is a close second. All of their exercises involve small, subtle movements that are surprisingly challenging and really test your strength and endurance. This dvd features 5 10 minute segments that can be done alone or combined as you desire into longer workouts. Each section (except the final) has a strengthening portion which makes up the majority of the 10 minutes, followed immediately by a stretch of the muscles just worked. This is a great technique to get the best benefit from your workout. And it feels great to immediately stretch worked muscles after intense strengthening work. The five segments include:1) Upper body strength: Use of light hand weights to work out all of the muscles in your arms, shoulders, upper back and chest. Really pretty comprehensive for just 10 minutes. I find this section fairly challenging because it involves a lot of holding positions with minor pulses so you continuously feel the weight. I used 3 lb hand weights and I got fatigued. I have fairly weak arms though so it may not be as challenging for others.2) Legs: This section is almost entirely made up of variations of plies (bending your legs) while up on your toes. It works your quads, thighs and calves. They use chairs as a barre to balance. I found this section doable... not overly strenuous but I still felt the work.3) Glutes: This is the hardest section in my opinion. It involves a series of back leg lifts while standing (straight/bent leg, turned in & out). It's a test of endurance and strength. The first 5 minutes is all on one leg, then it's repeated on the other side. By the end of the 5 min. my supporting leg was shaking and burning. Really works your glutes, legs and hips.4) Abs: While I think the ab section in the Pilates Plus dvd is the hardest you will find anywhere, I do not find this to be nearly as difficult. I'm able to fully do this section even while carrying on a conversation. That's not to say it doesn't provide a workout though. Their ab work does not involve a series of crunches... rather, it's essentially one crunch held the entire time with variations on arms and twisting the torso. Again, this makes it more of an endurance challenge than pure strength.5) Flexibility: Starts off with constructive rest and then goes into spinal twists and leg stretches. Fairly standard stretches.This is truly a great workout dvd in one of the best series out there. Do yourself a favor and buy their 3 dvd setExhale: Core Fusion Collection.

I've been mixing and matching because I do enjoy a bit of variety.I've been active for years with running and more recently extreme workouts like Crossfit, P90X and Insanity, but I was ready for a change. I've done yoga and a bit of pilates in the past but never felt like I was getting much out of them. Though they were challenging, if I wasn't drenched in sweat I doubted the effectiveness of a workout.  In recent years I've discovered the benefits of simple body weight training. I'm always on the lookout for something new so I decided to give this a try.My outlook has totally changed and so has my body in just a few short weeks. I won't waste time explaining the set up as I'm sure it has been done many times with so many reviews.The leg and seat workouts are my favorite because these have always been my problem areas. In just a few  weeks I can see a noticeable difference in my quadriceps and a lift in my butt. Since many of the moves in the workouts that I've used are similar, I definitely attribute these changes to the ballet barre and pilates movements.I was quite challenged by the arm section of this program. After lifting heavy weights and doing pull ups for the last few years I was surprised when I had to drop down to 3lb weights!The ab movements in several of the exhale workouts are completely new to me. Working my abs has always been my least favorite thing to do, but it's nice to do something besides endless crunches.The best part of this program is that it is broken down into 5 ten minute sections which you can do all at once or pick and choose from when time is limited.I've also ordered the yoga ad pre-ordered the bootcamp and can't wait to give those a try!
