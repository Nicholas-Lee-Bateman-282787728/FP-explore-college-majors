1433941,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,B004YVO5ZM,C. L. Messina,"[1, 6]","If you see one episode you've got the gist as the format for this show remains constant throughout- which isn't a bad thing. It's fair to claim this show is different than other children's shows, it has a much different look and feel than anything out there, but I can't help but think this a modern version of the early days of Sesame Street, when the show was at it's peak. It's easy to forget Sesame Street was once hip and refreshing compared with other shows as it has grown stale and repetitive over time. Perhaps the greatest sin of Sesame was the over-saturation that lives on today (seriously, can I buy a sippee cup WITHOUT the sesame street, Dora, or Disney characters?).So 'Yo' is different but I wouldn't claim it's landmark/revolutionary. In fact, I think it's a show that will show it's age quickly as all the 'current' acts are rooted in what is hip today rather than what might be timeless. Sometimes I feel the show tries to be hip just for the sake of being hip, and that is somewhat repellent.Mind you, I actually like all the bands and hosts. I grew up on quirky music when quirky music wasn't considered cool. I like the way the kids in the show look like IKEA models. I like the off-beat nature of the show but this is the problem: I feel more like Yo is geared toward me rather than my child. They spotlight  the quirky asides (bands, kids, cartoons) much more than the four main characters, which is what I always hated about Sesame Street. They'd cut to a kid or contemporary figure I'd never heard about and I'd be like, 'Alright, this is slow and lame. Where are the puppets?' And that sentiment runs through my brain every episode here, as well. My child says 'skip through this' whenever the segment leaves the four major characters and I sympathize but then a hipster band I like plays tunes that seem meant for me. See the problem? Who is this show for?So that's my discord with the show.",3,Sesame Street for Hipsters,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1920,"['see', 'one', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'got', 'gist', 'format', 'show', 'constant', 'throughout-', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'fair', 'claim', 'show', 'different', 'other', 'children', 'shows', 'much', 'different', 'look', 'feel', 'anything', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'modern', 'version', 'early', 'days', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'peak', 'easy', 'forget', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'was', 'once', 'hip', 'refreshing', 'compared', 'other', 'shows', 'grown', 'stale', 'repetitive', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'sin', 'Sesame', 'was', 'over-saturation', 'today', 'seriously', 'can', 'buy', 'sippee', 'cup', 'sesame', 'street', 'Dora', 'Disney', 'characters', '.So', ""'Yo"", 'different', 'would', ""n't"", 'claim', 'landmark/revolutionary', 'fact', 'think', 'show', 'will', 'show', 'age', 'quickly', ""'current"", 'acts', 'are', 'rooted', 'what', 'hip', 'today', 'rather', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'timeless', 'Sometimes', 'feel', 'show', 'be', 'hip', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'hip', 'somewhat', 'repellent.Mind', 'actually', 'bands', 'hosts', 'grew', 'up', 'quirky', 'music', 'when', 'quirky', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'cool', 'way', 'kids', 'show', 'look', 'IKEA', 'models', 'off-beat', 'nature', 'show', 'problem', 'feel', 'more', 'Yo', 'geared', 'rather', 'child', 'spotlight', 'quirky', 'asides', 'bands', 'kids', 'cartoons', 'much', 'more', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'what', 'always', 'hated', 'Sesame', 'Street', ""'d"", 'cut', 'kid', 'contemporary', 'figure', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', ""'d"", 'be', ""'Alright"", 'slow', 'lame', 'Where', 'are', 'puppets', 'sentiment', 'brain', 'episode', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'My', 'child', 'whenever', 'segment', 'four', 'major', 'characters', 'sympathize', 'then', 'hipster', 'band', 'like', 'plays', 'tunes', 'seem', 'meant', 'See', 'problem', 'Who', 'show', 'So', 'discord', 'show']",Yo Gabba Gabba!: Party in a Box
