As it is, I cannot recall a single line from it.What I got was very mundane aerobics that did not last an entire song and that were performed by completely vacant thoroughly bored zombies who were cast as strippers despite being unable to respectably fill out a G string. I love the Matt Bomer from ""White Collar"" and have no idea who the guy who supposedly was him on the scene.Even young Daniel Radcliffe puts as much effort into his current projects, which are radically different than Harry Potter, as he did into the role that made him famous. Also, ""Equus"" showed us that Radcliffe can fill out a g string quite nicely.Soderbergh could have gotten more realism and better performers scouting actual male strip clubs.On top of this, the whole film had a feeling of being shot at someone's condo over a long weekend. I do not know what one calls it when people read lines with little or no emotion, but it ain't acting and not getting one decent performance or turning what you filmed into something watchable ain't directing.I sincerely would not hire Soderbergh to videotape a dog show after seeing bis below-amateur work in every aspect of this steaming pile of celluloid. He can also forget about me watching ANYTHING that he does in the future.This is not to mention that Channing Tatum has absolutely no magic, and that the ""script"" did not reveal enough about him or any other character to get the audience involved in their stories.

1577310,A28RPKXOVO41AW,B008WCP2KG,Alyson C. Miller,"[3, 3]","I thought this movie would be fun. It really wasn't.  It was alright; pretty typical hollywood story and execution.  I'll start with the pros:The character development of &#34;The Kid&#34; and of Matthew McConaughey's character were actually really well done.  McConaughey's character at first appears like your typical, somewhat trashy, owner of the strip club.  Throughout the movie he gradually becomes more and more skeezy and horrible, and McConaughey's performance is spot-on (even though we were all laughing at him for doing this movie throughout...).  he really puts forth a solid acting job.It starts out promising.Now onto the cons:The leading lady was either HORRIBLY miscast, or is just a terrible actress.  She has one expression on her face the entire time, and her character is so one dimensional that it's like watching a cardboard cutout of a sulky 20-something.Channing Tatum has a great body.  This might seem like a pro, but unfortunately it is attached to someone with almost zero acting talent.  He would make a great back-up dancer, though!Matt Bomer, whom I generally just love, was cast in a tiny role that was either so poorly written and directed that NO ONE could have pulled it off, or he was just the wrong choice.  It happens.  I personally think he is a very good actor, but in all of his scenes in this movie he is sort of standing around like an awkward 14 year old at his first college party.  When he does speak (I think maybe once?) he comes across as someone too intelligent to be saying such stupid things.  Maybe a newbie undercover agent who should never have been sent in to infiltrate a group who's combined IQs don't quite make it into the triple digits.The movie has a lot of build up, and almost NO payoff.  Several things are left undone (in the case of the Kid, I actually really like how the ended it), but what about the multiple pieces of Tatum's character that we are supposed to be interested in?  We are built up on his career aspirations, his comparatively level-headedness, and potentially very interesting hints of a personality that is flawed, and is desperately trying to pretend he is not.  Instead we get no information on his background, no mention of his future career, and no indication whatsoever that maybe he is maturing past his insecurities.This movie could have been awesome.  I wanted it to be awesome.  It could have, at the least, been fun.

I understand that the director inspired confidence in this film because, well, he's Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh and people seem to think he's some kind of `do no wrong' genius of film.  I personally think he's a tad hit or miss, with films like `sex lies and videotape' and `Che' being major hits that then the mediocrity of those `Ocean' films being complete misses.  When this film first got announced it was labeled as some `drama heavy/dark' movie about male strippers and was supposed to be `more than that' despite being marketed as a flesh for all `chick flick'.It's just that; a flesh for all chick flick.LOL at the idea of this being dark.  Why, because Adam gets in over his head with a drug dealer?  Or was it because he gets in a fight with some college guys for slipping some girl ecstasy?  Or maybe it was because in some singular scene Dallas tries to act all tough and `controlling'.  Seriously, the darkest thing about this movie is the murky color lenses Soderbergh decided to shoot the whole film through.And still, it is kind of fun; right?I mean, the film is really stupid if we're to be honest.  Even the dance moves were somewhat uninspired, and the progression of character is so underdeveloped.  Watching Mike mull over his squashed dreams of having a legit job and not dry humping screaming bachelorettes is kind of hilarious and then his abandonment after going all `gangster' with some `new routine' is just so melodramatic and yet a total non-event.  The acting is completely one-note.  McConaughey's awards draw with this performance was so bizarre.  Like, how was this praised for anything?  All he did was smirk at the camera for the 1,000th time and act all McConaughey.  He charms in his branded southern way and that's about it folks.  Tatum is good looking yet vacant (which is weird since I usually find him undeniably charismatic) and Pettyfer is trapped in a ridiculous character.  Olivia Munn can walk around half clothed all she wants, but next time it would be nice if she were given something interesting to do.  I hope I never seen Cody Horn again.And still, it is kind of fun; right?I don't know, maybe, maybe not.  I enjoyed myself to an extent because it felt like a nicely crafted time waster that didn't feel like a complete waste of time.  Like, it was semi-interesting in all of its absurdity and it was pretty to look at (and I don't mean because of the flesh) and it moved with grace (the editing was flawlessly progressive).

1577390,A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE,B008WCP2KG,cinephiliagal,"[0, 0]","I completely missed this when it was out in theaters. I didn't see it because, like Fight Club, it was promoted as one kind of movie, but was actually another.  Now, it wasn't wrong to promote this as a movie about male strippers, because it IS about male strippers. But there is actually more going on here. It's subtle and easy to miss because the eye candy is a huge distraction.I'm as human as the next woman, so I'll review this on two levels (1) as a movie lover and former film student, and (2) as an involuntary victim of my gonadal responses.So, here's review (1) as movie lover and former film student.The main characters are Adam (Pettyfer), Mike (Tatum), Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn), Joanna  (Dallas (McConaughey), and Dallas (McConaughey). There are other characters, but we don't see as much of them (except their stripping).Adam answers a Craigslist call for construction workers and meets Mike on the job. Mike actually knows how to build stuff and knows construction, which Adam doesn't. Adam is 19, flunked out of college, at loose ends, and living on his sister Brooke's couch. Mike is older, thirty, construction is his day job, and his alter ego is Magic Mike, his stripper character. Mike is trying to get a small business loan so he can start his own furniture company. But he keeps running into a brick wall, because he's pretty much a working class hero with a bad credit history, and no one will give him a loan. He works as a stripper to save up the money to open his own business. He takes Adam under his wing, and introduces him to Dallas, the owner of the Tampa strip club Xquisite where Mike works. Adam gets hired to do props for the male strippers. There is a funny hazing seen when he first gets hired; the guys give him a hard time but eventually Adam winds up being thrown on stage when one of the other strippers doesn't show up and there is about to be a gap in the show.The first thing you realize is that these are all basically working class, blue collar people by origin and at heart. Their options are limited by their class and education (or lack thereof). They'd like to move up, and the easy money of stripping seems like a way to do that (or dating some upwardly mobile guy who does have an education, in Brooke's case). But money and the lifestyle that comes with the stripping is seductive and can easily lead down the wrong path.Adam describes his sister Brooke as &#34;a little uptight.&#34; But the truth is, she's the only really grounded person in the movie. Except for dating a guy who is kind of an upwardly mobile, condescending jerk, she has no aspirations; she's accepted herself and her life for what she and it are. At first Adam hides his new job from her, but she quickly finds out, and is kind of shocked. They invite her to watch Adam work, not thinking she'll take them up on it, but she does. She remains unimpressed, and tells Mike that he better keep an eye on brother to make sure nothing bad happens to him. Mike says he will.Mike keeps trying to get Brooke to go out with him, but she's guarded, noncommittal, not beguiled by his charms or his endless party lifestyle, and already has a boyfriend. He keeps trying, though. Mike is kind of the big brother of the other strippers. His dream of opening his own business is thwarted by the bank, so he drowns his sorrows in partying. But you can see he yearns for more; he's clearly lonely, despite his good looks, charms, and his ability to skip past the velvet ropes at the hottest clubs. He hooks up with Joanna repeatedly -- she's a grad student in psychology -- and together they pick up other girls and go home with them. She's an aggressively free-wheeling girl who doesn't get too messed up, both part of and above it all. Mike clearly wants more from her, but she's not available for that.Dallas (McConaughey) is the owner/manager/emcee of Xquisite. He plans to open a strip club in Miami, and Mike is supposed to be a semi-partner, getting a percentage. Dallas is all easy-going, let it all hang out, the king of the endless party, the lucky bastard big bro you never had, who takes you under his wing and shows you the ropes. He's got a self-serving philosophy and self-help patter that people might easily fall for, but it's just his shtick. His character is sometimes kind of a creepy, narcissistic prick under his easygoing exterior. And like all bosses, when push comes to shove, he is ruthless and utterly self-serving.I won't give away the rest of the plot. If you're inclined to re-watch (worth it for the eye candy alone), you'll see these subtleties as you become desensitized to all the skin. Adam's young and stupid, directionless, with no hopes or dreams, so he falls into the stripping lifestyle, and it isn't all good. Mike has a dream, but he and it face obstacles, so it is a dream deferred. He's doing too much at once and under that kind of pressure, can't move forward on any front. He also can't find true intimacy with anyone -- his looks, his stripping job, and his lifestyle not only don't help, they're a hindrance, because women see only his pretty surface, so they underestimate him and use him. He drowns his sorrows in the money, clubbing, drugs and girls -- an endless party that feels so hollow. He's also getting older, and while he's on top of things now, he won't be forever; how long can he be Magic Mike?At first Tatum's performance put me off, because it seemed disengaged. But actually it's Mike who is simultaneously hyperactive and disengaged, constantly hustling, yet only managing to stay afloat rather than moving forward. Brooke, despite being presented initially as the stick-in-the-mud, buzzkill sister, actually has much more going for her than either Adam or Mike or even Dallas. While not financially successful, Brooke has her head on straight. She may not have as much money as the strippers or Dallas, but she is real, and she doesn't have to sell her soul to keep house and home together.It must be noted that Tatum's dancing and stripping is pretty amazing. I'm not even into that kind of music-video type of dance, but you don't have to be into it to realize that he's damn good at it. All of the other guys are good, but he's clearly head and shoulders above the rest. McConaughey opens and closes the movie in fetishistic cowboy clothes that are simultaneously hot, creepy, and kind of gay.Disappointing moment (SPOILER): of course, they had to include a gratuitous fat-girl joke. The strippers often go out into the audience, pick a woman (or a bride-to-be), and simulate sex acts with her, sometimes bringing her on stage or picking her up out of her seat (they get way more tips this way). Of course, the vast majority of the time, this is some skinny chick.But Mangianello's character is shown doing so with a chunky (but not morbidly obese) woman, and subsequently injuring his back to the point where he's kind of limping. Really? A guy who probably bench presses 500 lbs. for multiple reps 3-4 days a week, is injured by lifting a 180 lb woman one time? I kind of doubt it. What a mean and unnecessary scene.Okay, so (2) here's the review based on my utterly hormonal response to the male stripping (SPOILERS):This is not an ensemble movie, though the cast is hugely appealing. Tatum is the clear star of this movie. He's also, by far, the best stripper/dancer in it. For me, his strip routines were less &#34;ooh, nearly naked male muscles&#34; and more &#34;whoa, how does he MOVE like that?&#34; It is pretty hypnotic, but it's also almost more like art than striptease, which I kind of admired. So if you're a huge Tatum fan, you'll probably like this.I haven't seen Tatum in much, and wasn't a huge fan before seeing the movie. (Non-hormonal comment: because of his understated yet authentic performance, I may actually watch more stuff he does *after* seeing Magic Mike, than I would have before.)If you rent or watch this just for McConaughey, you may be disappointed. There is much less of him, and you don't get it until the end. (But it is worth it.) His character opens and closes the movie and is hyper-sexy and charismatic, but he has little stripping throughout the bulk of the movie. He wears a lot of gay-cowboy-ish looking outfits, which you may or may not like (I like). Aspects of McConaughey strip routine at the end are almost awkward (which surprised me). But he is athletic, clearly game, and looks like he's enjoying himself.If you like homoeroticism and male autoeroticism -- watching guys touch themselves -- you get a lot of that in this flick. (McConaughey does a LOT of self-touching in this movie, and it is really effing hot.) There's plenty of near-naked guys hugging each other, slapping each other on the back, on the butt, etc. There is a really hot scene where Dallas teaches Adam how to strip and excite the female audience. Dallas starts out talking and teaching, but eventually he's showing Adam -- to the point where he's behind Adam, with Adam basically sitting in his lap while they both gyrate and thrust.My ovaries practically exploded from that scene -- but then, I've been a slash fan since Brideshead Revisited (the early 1980s Jeremy Irons version). Other women may find this a complete turn off. But then, some women who might find the *idea* of it a major turn-off, may find themselves converted to the eroticism of homoeroticism by the sheer hotness, like all the women who found themselves inexplicably turned on during the gay sex scenes in Brokeback Mountain. And there was much rejoicing. :-)Mangianello is as hot as he is on True Blood, though he doesn't have many lines (but who needs lines when you're stripping down to a thong?). Adam Rodriguez shows a lot more skin than he ever did on CSI: Miami, but he also doesn't get much to say. Neither has as much screen time as Tatum, but they show a ton more skin than they usually do (okay, that might be debatable for Mangianello; True Blood borders on soft porn sometimes). Their characters are not developed (but who cares? they're not there to really *act*), and they don't show as much skin as Tatum or McConaughey.I must be old (46) or weird (quite likely) because I don't get how Adam (Pettyfer) is supposed to be &#34;cougar bait.&#34; I am a cougar, and he was the least physically appealing of all of the strippers, to me. To be fair, he is playing a 19 year old. He's skinny, scrawny, and boy-ish compared to McConaughey, Mangianello, and Tarzan (Kevin Nash). I didn't go for guys like Adam when I was 19, so I suppose it makes sense that I'm not into it now. His face and body scream &#34;boy&#34; to me, not &#34;Man.&#34;What Pettyfer *does* have going for him is a baby face and obvious youth, bordering on barely legal. (So the whole &#34;cougar bait&#34; thing a little creepy, though no more creepy than a 40something man lusting after a 19 year old girl.) He has a fresh faced innocence that is appealing and fits his character, though his acting is, well, not so much acting, I think.Caveat: this is not a movie full of real, natural men. Everything about these male physiques is unnatural. They're shaved/waxed, oiled, etc. So if you dig Don Draper's obvious chest hair on Mad Men, that's not the kind of body you'll see here. I understand that hairlessness shows how well cut and defined the guys' muscles are (I have a friend who is a fitness model). But it's always been a bummer to me that male strippers (whether straight or gay) have to be completely hairless. I do like chest hair, Don Draper's (John Hamm)'s specifically. I miss seeing chest hair all over the place or the specific chests of the young Sean Connery and the younger Robert Redford.Now hairless is the standard of beauty for men, which makes me *sadface*, even if it looks fantastic on the likes of Ian Somerhalder. And I think it's sad that men now try to adhere to standards of beauty as unrealistic as the female standards of beauty (though not in the same numbers). But that's just me.There is a lot of glorious, lovely, male muscle on display in Magic Mike, in ways you normally don't see it (gyrating and simulating sex moves). So what's not to love. It's like late night cable soft-core porn, except made purely for women (and maybe gays).I suspect that is one of the things that put so many people off this movie: its unabashed aim squarely at female heterosexual sexuality (without any romantic comedy trappings). That doesn't happen much, even in this day and age. So, yay.",4,"Male skin, flesh, and eye candy with a bit of a message -- and a lot of near-naked guys touching themselves.

I thought a male stripper movie. I have seen  my share of male strippers and if it was going to be like watching the Chippendales, I thought how boring. Well it came out and it was going strong at the theater in July so what the hell, I went and saw it. All I can say is WOW it was raining men and and hot bods and man candy. Definitely not boring. Channing Tatum can definitely move and the dance in the red thong is Oh My God. We women finally get something decent to look at, after all the years of enduring movies where chicks get naked and the guys are drooling. So the guys get to suck it up. Seeing Channing Tatum's naked rear-end and just about everything else, makes your mouth drop open. He is drop dead gorgeous and sexy as hell and the rest are not bad on the eyes either. Joe Mangianello from True Blood is holy crap hot too. It was a pretty decent story too, not just stripping. I love the strip to KISS's Dr. Love. That was a topper for me. I highly recommend this movie to every red-blooded female out there. When Channing Tatum goes dressed as a cop to strip for the college girls it makes you want to do bad things to get arrested by him.

I was actually surprised by Tatum's performance here, as he demonstrates more depth than I've seen from him in previous works. His usual charm and good looks are all over the place, but I enjoyed seeing him take on something a little more serious for a change (even though I thought he was hilarious in 21 Jump Street).The story revolves around Magic Mike's profession as a stripper, but it becomes so much more than that, and in a good way. In my opinion, the trailers were trying to make the film look like a comedy, which it isn't. The movie is definitely a drama at heart, though it does have it's fair share of humor (in typical Soderbergh fashion) and a few lighthearted moments.Another interesting performance is delivered by Matthew McConaughey, who plays the part of the owner of the club in which Magic Mike performs. There's a subtle intensity you see in him, especially in the movie's final forty-five minutes.This movie made a lot of money thanks in part to girl's nights and sorority parties, but I'm here to tell you that, as a male, I quite enjoyed the movie.

And, if the outside world of super-sunny Florida is unreal, then so is Club Xquisite. The best  thing about ""Magic Mike"" is how it makes the life and work of male strippers ""unsexy."" Sex isn't sexy if it's a business, and we see how every move, bump, grind, and gyration that sends the female customers (where are the gay men in this movie? Because, trust me, gay men are the real target audience for,  and are watching,  this movie)  into sexual frenzy is a calculated business.  Captivating performances by Tatum, Matthew McConaughey and Alex Pettyfer keep things interesting.McConaughey is Dallas, the ultimately self-centered owner and mentor at Xquisite, and ""Magic Mike"" Lane (Tatum) is the star attraction in the stable of  male hotties. Tatum has a natural confidence and charisma. At age 30, he is smart enough to know that he can't keep bumping, grinding, and gyrating forever. He works odd jobs and hopes to one day design his own line of custom furniture. He befriends Adam (Pettyfer), literally, the new ""Kid"" at Xquisite. He is also attracted to Adam's sister (Cody Horn). Worried about how Adam will handle the stripper lifestyle, she asks Mike to take care of him. Mike promises to do so, but that doesn't turn out too well.Adam becomes a stripping sensation faster than Natalie Wood in ""Gypsy"" (1962). Adam, it turns out, is a natural born stripper; despite the fact that Dallas initially tells him, ""You take your clothes off like a 12 year old  n a locker room."" Adam quickly dives into easy money, booze, drugs, and cheap sex; just as Mike grows sick of the lifestyle. In the end, Mike has had enough and (drug-addicted) Adam is  all set to take his place as #1 Stud at Xquisite. So, does ""Magic Mike"" aim to be the ""A Star Is Born"" of male stripper movies? Such a question will likely never bother the average viewer, who will likely view ""Magic Mike"" as agreeable cinema eye candy and nothing more. ""Magic Mike"" may not know where it is going (maybe it has nowhere to go?); but I still appreciated the fact that Soderbergh's and Tatum's interest in the characters is obviously more than just skin deep.",4,"""You take your clothes off like a 12 year old in a locker room""",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2543,"['Director', 'Stephen', 'Soderbergh', 'star', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'establish', 'extremely', 'relaxed', 'atmosphere', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'screenplay', 'Reid', 'Carolin', 'loosely', 'inspired', 'Tatum', 'own', 'early', 'days', 'male', 'dancer/stripper', 'Soderbergh', 'shoots', 'scene', 'Club', 'Xquisite', 'double', 'straw', 'filter', 'camera', 'huge', 'ray', 'sunshine', 'attached', 'so', 'unreal', 'outside', 'world', 'super-sunny', 'Florida', 'unreal', 'then', 'so', 'Club', 'Xquisite', 'best', 'thing', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'how', 'life', 'work', 'male', 'strippers', 'unsexy', 'Sex', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'business', 'see', 'how', 'move', 'bump', 'grind', 'gyration', 'female', 'customers', 'where', 'are', 'gay', 'men', 'movie', 'trust', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'real', 'target', 'audience', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'sexual', 'frenzy', 'calculated', 'business', 'Captivating', 'performances', 'Tatum', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting.McConaughey', 'Dallas', 'ultimately', 'self-centered', 'owner', 'mentor', 'Xquisite', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'Lane', 'Tatum', 'star', 'attraction', 'stable', 'male', 'hotties', 'Tatum', 'natural', 'confidence', 'charisma', 'age', '30', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'bumping', 'grinding', 'gyrating', 'forever', 'odd', 'jobs', 'one', 'day', 'design', 'own', 'line', 'custom', 'furniture', 'Adam', 'Pettyfer', 'literally', 'new', 'Kid', 'Xquisite', 'also', 'attracted', 'Adam', 'sister', 'Cody', 'Horn', 'Worried', 'how', 'Adam', 'will', 'handle', 'stripper', 'lifestyle', 'Mike', 'take', 'care', 'Mike', 'do', 'so', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'too', 'well.Adam', 'stripping', 'sensation', 'faster', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Gypsy', '1962', 'Adam', 'out', 'natural', 'born', 'stripper', 'fact', 'Dallas', 'initially', 'take', 'clothes', '12', 'year', 'old', 'locker', 'room', 'Adam', 'quickly', 'easy', 'money', 'booze', 'drugs', 'cheap', 'sex', 'just', 'Mike', 'sick', 'lifestyle', 'end', 'Mike', 'had', 'enough', 'drug-addicted', 'Adam', 'set', 'take', 'place', '1', 'Stud', 'Xquisite', 'So', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'aim', 'be', 'A', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'male', 'stripper', 'movies', 'question', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'bother', 'average', 'viewer', 'who', 'will', 'likely', 'view', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'agreeable', 'cinema', 'eye', 'candy', 'nothing', 'more', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'maybe', 'nowhere', 'go', 'still', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'Soderbergh', 'Tatum', 'interest', 'characters', 'obviously', 'more', 'just', 'skin', 'deep']",N/A

Channing Tatum plays the title role of a male stripper, who tries to pursue the American dream during the day, e.g. owns a roofing company and designs avantgarde furniture, but strips at night--I'm thinking because that's where the money really is.  He cannot get credit to pursue his entrepreneur dreams, beds as many women as he can (never even remembering their names), and believes there isn't a person he can't literally charm the pants off of.His dancing buddies are managed by Matthew McConaughey, who train them in the fine art of jiggling their junk in the faces of drunken females.  McConaughey's character is despicable; his performance very noteworthy.  Mike meets Adam (played by Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year old out-of-work, hot headed, unemployable mess and soon they become friends.  Mike talks Alex into stripping one night, Alex enjoys it tremendously, and soon is being groomed to be the new, YOUNG version of Magic Mike.  Along the way, he falls prey to every vice that could be associated with stripping:  womanizing, drugs, self-abuse--it's all in there.  There is another character in the entourage of this all male review.  His stage name is ""Tarzan,"" and the role was played by former WWE wrestler Kevin Nash.  He is (by far) the oldest of the lot, and I could only imagine his backstory.  Perhaps if director Steven Soderbergh would have delved into how pitiful it must be to be in your 50s--and STILL stripping--that would have made for a better story.  But that's not gonna' happen; there are too many young buff bodies to show off here.  I did not for one second buy the obvious sell of the romance between Mike and Adam's older sister.Rumour has it that this story was based on Channing Tatum's own experience with stripping when he was growing up in Florida.  I'm sure to some men that scenario must seem like heaven:  all the women, drugs, and alcohol you can have--and you get to shake your bon-bons at night to a packed house of boozed-up, drugged out women.

When the film plays on a DVD or Video on demand and is reduced to a small screen, then the fact that this is a very minor work becomes very apparent. One wonders why Stephen Soderbergh who brought us such fine films as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, Che, Kafka, King of the Hill and the Ocean's 11, 12 and 13 bothered with this. The script is by Reid Carolin who opted for more dance sequences and partying than significant storyline. The characters are very one-dimensional and the development of change is at a minimum.Mike (Channing Tatum) is a unique furniture designer who is saving his money to start his own business - the money comes from roofing, detailing cars, and stripping in a girl club and at parties. He takes a younger performer Adam called The Kid (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money, much to the disgust and frustration of dam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn). Mike brings Adam to meet Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) who hires men with the right bodies and equipment to show it all to the hungry women in the nightclub. His crew includes a group of male strippers - Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez, Kevin Nash and others, none of whom has more than a line or two in between the dance numbers. Adam makes money and gets women, Mike gets women and occasionally gets serious (Olivia Munn) but after three months of stripping and partying Adam falls into the drug game with Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) and that is the beginning of the end.  The rest of the film remains predictable.The acting is minimal, the dance numbers are what draws the viewers and if you judge films by the box office then this is a hit.  Pretty sad and trivial, but that is not the point.  The point, it seems, is to see guys get naked.  Grady Harp, October 12",3,`You are the husband they never had!

What I watched was a film that felt too long at 1 hour, 50 minutes and that didn't have much going for it aside from the novelty of watching male actors perform strip routines.  Channing Tatum had a good performance.  He's much better suited to comedy like21 Jump Street (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray], but as Magic Mike, his ""blankness"" fits his character.  And he's certainly fun to watch when he dances.  Alex Pettyfer, on the other hand, co-starring as Magic Mike's stripper protege, appears to just be a bad actor; he seemed either scared or bored throughout the film, and he's very uninteresting to watch.  The real surprise was Matthew McConaughey, an actor whom I generally find to be insufferable.  He plays his character the same as he has played every character throughout his career, and this was the first time I've ever felt his method of acting actually fits his role.  The lead actress is played by Cody Horn, and let's just say that she makes Kristen Stewart look Oscar caliber.  Horn's acting consists of clenching her jaw and glaring silently.I would have enjoyed the film more if it focused on the campy angle.  Instead, the filmmakers attempted to add gravitas by focusing on a major drug storyline that quickly became tiresome.

1577516,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B008WCP2KG,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[0, 0]","The Walt Disney Network could easily delete a few male buttocks shots and then telecast this boring ode to male stripper for the enjoyment of the whole family.Through much of 2012, we were treated to much hype and sizzle about this romantic saga set against the backdrop of male burlesque, as seen by star Channing Tatum who helped write this script from his real-life experiences as a male dancer.The problem for me, though, was that the hype and PR, also extolled the fleshy wonders of such hot male hunks as Joe Manganiello, Matt Bonner and Matthew McConaughey and I, and millions more, savlivated over the expectations of seeing some of the most beautiful men in show biz giving us a peek at their awesome torsos.Alas, we see a brief second or two of Tatum's naked rump in the very beginning but from there on, the hotness factor steadily fades away. In the show club, we're tantalized with several male-male routines which provides us with glimpses of jock straps. But just when the music is building up and the boys begin to disrobe, Pow.We're whipped back into the story-line, which is so boringly deadly that the sizzle factor finally vanishes completely.Director Steven Soderbaugh is considered in the movie world as a ""serious"" director.I suspect that in order to draw a bigger audience to one of his boring movies, he and the producers thought it a good gimmick to choose the naughty, sinful world of male stripping--and then add one of those dull as dishwasher storylines where our hunky hero, Tatum, is really a serious-minded young man who wants to enter the corporate world. He meets and falls obsessively in love with probably the most boring, colorless heroines in movie history. As portrayed by unkown, Cody Horn, she, naturally, is horrified that her brother is turned into a popular male stripper by Tatum.When she visits the club, her face grows harder and bitter and she expresses to Tatum how ashamed she is of men who take their clothes off.In the meantime, we see a split second of the gorgeous Joe Manganiello and Matt Bonner and the other studly dancers. Only Matthew is allowed to finally bring some sizzle with his dazzling dance routine at the end. But for me, it was too late.We watch as Tatum rather hysterically glares at the camera, as he contemplates his life as a male dancer and remembers the disgust of his boring girlfriend.So, he suddenly sees the light, right before a performance, throws on his clothes and joins his jubilant girlfriend in her colorless, boring apartment and they presumbably live happily ever after in her boring, colorless home.I was struck by how similar Magic Mike is to the 2001 masterpiece, Just Can't Get Enough that went straight to DVD but now has a well-deserved cult following. In this juicy, brilliantly made film about the rise of the Chippendale's in the l980s, we are treated to the jaw-dropping sexiness of Jonathan Aube--one of the most amazing pinup boys to ever grace the screen. His genuine sweetness and innocence is arousing when we see this dazzling hunk in nearly all of his glory: he never removes his britches like his frisky, glorious cohorts do but this adds to his eroticism.In this movie, he, too, is obsessed by a boring, colorless, whining girl who shames him for being a male dancer until one night, after meeting her again, he is so traumatized that he barfs into a toilet, throws on his clothes and becomes a businessman.""Just Can't Get Enough"" is everything that ""Magic Mike"" should have been: hot, sweaty, beautifully photographed and with naked eye candy galore.",1,The Mickey Mouse Show,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,3559,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'Network', 'could', 'easily', 'delete', 'few', 'male', 'buttocks', 'shots', 'then', 'telecast', 'boring', 'ode', 'male', 'stripper', 'enjoyment', 'whole', 'family.Through', 'much', '2012', 'were', 'treated', 'much', 'hype', 'sizzle', 'romantic', 'saga', 'set', 'backdrop', 'male', 'burlesque', 'seen', 'star', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'who', 'helped', 'write', 'script', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'male', 'dancer.The', 'problem', 'though', 'was', 'hype', 'PR', 'also', 'extolled', 'fleshy', 'wonders', 'such', 'hot', 'male', 'hunks', 'Joe', 'Manganiello', 'Matt', 'Bonner', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'millions', 'more', 'savlivated', 'expectations', 'seeing', 'most', 'beautiful', 'men', 'show', 'biz', 'giving', 'peek', 'awesome', 'torsos.Alas', 'see', 'brief', 'second', 'two', 'Tatum', 'naked', 'rump', 'very', 'beginning', 'there', 'hotness', 'factor', 'steadily', 'away', 'show', 'club', ""'re"", 'tantalized', 'several', 'male-male', 'routines', 'glimpses', 'jock', 'straps', 'just', 'when', 'music', 'building', 'up', 'boys', 'begin', 'disrobe', 'Pow.We', ""'re"", 'whipped', 'back', 'story-line', 'so', 'boringly', 'deadly', 'sizzle', 'factor', 'finally', 'vanishes', 'completely.Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbaugh', 'considered', 'movie', 'world', 'serious', 'director.I', 'suspect', 'order', 'draw', 'bigger', 'audience', 'one', 'boring', 'movies', 'producers', 'thought', 'good', 'gimmick', 'choose', 'naughty', 'sinful', 'world', 'male', 'stripping', 'then', 'add', 'one', 'dull', 'dishwasher', 'storylines', 'where', 'hunky', 'hero', 'Tatum', 'really', 'serious-minded', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'enter', 'corporate', 'world', 'obsessively', 'love', 'probably', 'most', 'boring', 'colorless', 'heroines', 'movie', 'history', 'portrayed', 'unkown', 'Cody', 'Horn', 'naturally', 'horrified', 'brother', 'turned', 'popular', 'male', 'stripper', 'Tatum.When', 'club', 'face', 'harder', 'bitter', 'Tatum', 'how', 'ashamed', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'clothes', 'meantime', 'see', 'split', 'second', 'gorgeous', 'Joe', 'Manganiello', 'Matt', 'Bonner', 'other', 'studly', 'dancers', 'Only', 'Matthew', 'allowed', 'finally', 'bring', 'sizzle', 'dazzling', 'dance', 'routine', 'end', 'was', 'too', 'late.We', 'watch', 'Tatum', 'rather', 'hysterically', 'camera', 'life', 'male', 'dancer', 'disgust', 'boring', 'girlfriend.So', 'suddenly', 'light', 'right', 'performance', 'clothes', 'jubilant', 'girlfriend', 'colorless', 'boring', 'apartment', 'presumbably', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'boring', 'colorless', 'home.I', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'similar', 'Magic', 'Mike', '2001', 'masterpiece', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Enough', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'now', 'well-deserved', 'cult', 'following', 'juicy', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'film', 'rise', 'Chippendale', 'l980s', 'are', 'treated', 'jaw-dropping', 'sexiness', 'Jonathan', 'Aube', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'pinup', 'boys', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'genuine', 'sweetness', 'innocence', 'arousing', 'when', 'see', 'dazzling', 'hunk', 'nearly', 'glory', 'never', 'britches', 'frisky', 'glorious', 'cohorts', 'do', 'eroticism.In', 'movie', 'too', 'obsessed', 'boring', 'colorless', 'whining', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'male', 'dancer', 'one', 'night', 'meeting', 'again', 'so', 'traumatized', 'toilet', 'clothes', 'businessman', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Enough', 'everything', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hot', 'sweaty', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'naked', 'eye', 'candy', 'galore']",N/A

He wants to build custom designed furniture but it takes money to begin a startup company.  His day job is a construction worker who makes enough money to live on but not enough to save to start a business.  His night job is being a male stripper in a club located in Tampa Florida. Working there is part of accomplishing his dream.While on his day job he befriends a young man, Adam (Alex Pettyfer), and almost by accident gets him into the stripping business. That is how he meets Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) and shares his future dreams with her.....This was a good movie with some comedy, seriousness and an insight into the world of professional strippers.  The storyline is weak and cheesy as the object used to sell the movie is naked men and the good looking women who want to be with them.

1577545,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B008WCP2KG,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[0, 0]","So, I'll put in my two cents here amongst the nearly thousands of reviews. I might be the last person to watch this movie because it is so far out of my preferred genre, if it hadn't been as popular as it was was and if I weren't as bored as I am, I never would have watched it. After reading the reviews, I expected a brain dead piece of nonsense with no character growth and a lot of naked men.Imagine my surprise to find this movie completely absorbing, not because of the naked men (not that I didn't appreciate the great dancing and parts of the show!), and certainly not because of the casual sex. Having never been a fan of Channing Tatum, I found his character interesting, engrossing, and the focal point of this movie. I must have read, out of 25 or so reviews before I wrote this, at least 10 reviewers who found absolutely no redemption in this movie. I had to wonder if we saw the same movie! Mike's (Channing Tatum) struggle with the useless, empty life he was leading, in my opinion, had been going on for some time before the beginning of the movie. When he meets Adam, a shy 19 year old sort of drifter, and Adam's sister Brooke, who loves her brother dearly and obviously is a bit of a parent figure to him, the real plot begins to come together.This movie isn't a movie that edifies the lifestyle of the men who choose it at all. In fact, if you watch carefully, as I have learned to do in all Steven Soderbergh's movies, you watch a subtle transition occur in one or more characters. Perhaps subtlety isn't best in a movie full of nudity and sex! However, as Adam becomes more and more absorbed in what Soderbergh clearly meant to convey is a very degenerate lifestyle, Mike, watches him as if he is reliving his own experiences with this lifestyle. I would have liked more closure between Brooke and Mike in the end. It was a mistake to end it so abruptly (IMO) and almost conveyed a contrived plot device that almost misses the message he is trying to convey throughout this movie. I will say that this review comes from a person who had zero expectations of this movie, which might be why I saw different things from other people.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 1]","This movie has some very entertaining moments - both Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey do a good job as the eye candy they are supposed to be in this movie. I always find McConaughey - who plays the owner of a male strip club here - a little heavy-handed in his acting, but this is such a heavy-handed role and setting anyway that it mostly works. Channing Tatum brings a soulfulness to his role as the lead stripper in the show who longs for something more, both in terms of relationships and career. It's not Oscar material, but he is always great to watch on screen, and does a good job here.By contrast, Alex Pettyfer, who plays Channing's mentoree and new young guy in the club, falls flat. He comes across as very wooden, and we never really get a sense of what he is going through or why he gravitates to the wild life so much. Olivia Munn, who plays his sister and Channing's love interest, is similarly wooden, and I felt they both brought the film down a bit whenever they were in a scene (which was most.)The bigger problem is the storyline, which starts out OK, but then just kind of peters out. Channing's character has some sort of growth trajectory implied by the end, but we don't really get a clear sense of what it is. So this film has its moments, and it is not simply a superficial, eye-candy kind of movie, but it just isn't consistent enough to pull off what it is trying to do.",3,Has Entertaining Moments But Loses it Along the Way,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1405,"['movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'eye', 'candy', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'always', 'find', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'owner', 'male', 'strip', 'club', 'here', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'acting', 'such', 'heavy-handed', 'role', 'setting', 'anyway', 'mostly', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'soulfulness', 'role', 'lead', 'stripper', 'show', 'who', 'something', 'more', 'terms', 'relationships', 'career', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'always', 'great', 'watch', 'screen', 'good', 'job', 'here.By', 'contrast', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'who', 'Channing', 'mentoree', 'new', 'young', 'guy', 'club', 'flat', 'very', 'wooden', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'wild', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'Olivia', 'Munn', 'who', 'sister', 'Channing', 'love', 'interest', 'similarly', 'wooden', 'felt', 'brought', 'film', 'down', 'bit', 'whenever', 'were', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'bigger', 'problem', 'storyline', 'out', 'OK', 'then', 'just', 'kind', 'peters', 'out', 'Channing', 'character', 'sort', 'growth', 'trajectory', 'implied', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'clear', 'sense', 'what', 'So', 'film', 'moments', 'not', 'simply', 'superficial', 'eye-candy', 'kind', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'trying', 'do']",N/A

Especially in such a sex-negative culture as modern American culture.  The film wasn't great but it was certainly watchable and the performances were generally quite good.  Special kudos to Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey who went (or went back) to some very difficult emotional places.  MM's performance in the last 15 or so minutes of the film, as the strip club manager on the wrong side of 40, who strips one last time for-old-times-sake reminded me strongly of Mikey Rourke's performance in 'The Wrestler.'  Say anything you want about the 'liberation' of human sexual expression in the various parts of the sex trade-- or the movie industry-- fantasy is all well and good until one day you wake up past-45 and the party is OVER. Mike is trying to find that something else to carry him through the rest of his life (which is most of his life) but frustrated at every turn by no one willing to see him as a real person. Some of the most gorgeous man-candy actors alive are in this film, but I'm pleased to say that while we get to see plenty of them, it's not too much and presented in such a way that they're not de-humanized, unless it's a necessary part of the story. This isn't a Florida version of The Full Monty...it's much more serious than that. I think the reason it didn't get better than 3 stars from me is that probably Alex Pettifer. He's pretty to look at and plays a shallow character to contrast with Mike's increasingly-desperate seriousness but he's too stiff.  He isn't able to melt the camera lens in this film the way CT, MM, Joe Manganiello and others of the dancers are able to do, and that's essential to one of the points of the film, which is that the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.",3,There's No Despair Quite Like...,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,1887,"['.that', 'someone', 'who', 'selling', 'sexuality', 'money', 'seen', 'less', 'full', 'human', 'being', 'fellow', 'creatures', 'Especially', 'such', 'sex-negative', 'culture', 'modern', 'American', 'culture', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'performances', 'were', 'generally', 'quite', 'good', 'Special', 'kudos', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'went', 'went', 'back', 'very', 'difficult', 'emotional', 'places', 'MM', 'performance', 'last', '15', 'so', 'minutes', 'film', 'strip', 'club', 'manager', 'wrong', 'side', '40', 'who', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'for-old-times-sake', 'reminded', 'strongly', 'Mikey', 'Rourke', 'performance', ""'The"", 'Wrestler', 'Say', 'anything', 'want', ""'liberation"", 'human', 'sexual', 'expression', 'various', 'parts', 'sex', 'trade', 'movie', 'industry', 'fantasy', 'well', 'good', 'one', 'day', 'wake', 'up', 'past-45', 'party', 'OVER', 'Mike', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'carry', 'rest', 'life', 'most', 'life', 'frustrated', 'turn', 'one', 'willing', 'see', 'real', 'person', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'man-candy', 'actors', 'alive', 'are', 'film', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'get', 'see', 'plenty', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'presented', 'such', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'de-humanized', 'necessary', 'part', 'story', ""n't"", 'Florida', 'version', 'Full', 'Monty', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'think', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', '3', 'stars', 'probably', 'Alex', 'Pettifer', 'pretty', 'look', 'plays', 'shallow', 'character', 'contrast', 'Mike', 'increasingly-desperate', 'seriousness', 'too', 'stiff', ""n't"", 'able', 'melt', 'camera', 'film', 'way', 'CT', 'MM', 'Joe', 'Manganiello', 'others', 'dancers', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'essential', 'one', 'points', 'film', 'flame', 'twice', 'as', 'bright', 'burns', 'half', 'long']",N/A

The Kid gets an opportunity to ""dance"" and becomes a hit. He also finds an alternate source of income (drugs) so think about the Dirk Digler story in ""Boogie Nights"" and you will get the drift.

I kept hearing about this movie, and being a red-blooded single woman I thought I should probably watch it to see what it's about.  I won't deny there's some eye candy there; in fact it was almost enough to make me overlook the flaws of the movie.  Almost.Magic Mike is the story of a man who works construction by day, builds furniture as a dream, and strips by night.  He's rather successful at it and when he meets a young guy at the construction job, he gives him a shot at the business too.  Mike wants out of the stripping business to have his dream job of running a furniture making business, but his new friend Adam has dove completely into the world of stripping, sordid side jobs and all.  Which causes problems with Adam's sister, who Mike has a crush on and who doesn't approve of the lifestyle at all.Characters:Channing Tatum: Magic MikeAlex Pettyfer: AdamMatthew McConaughey: DallasCody Horn: BrookeJoe Manganiello: RichieMatt Bomer: KenAdam Rodriguez:TitoKevin Nash: TarzanOlivia Munn: JoannaGabriel Iglesias: TobiasI can't say any of the acting was really good in this.  Tatum was probably the best and that's just because I enjoyed his dance moves.  Even McConaughey, who I absolutely loved I just didn't like in this movie.  It could have been his role as a sleazy strip-joint owner, but he didn't even come out as being attractive to me in the role.  He looked used up, which maybe was the point for the movie, but who knows.  Horn as Brooke was not very good either.  It was like taking an awkward teenage girl of the streets and putting her in the movie.  No depth and there wasn't even any chemistry between her and Tatum on screen.  But hey, at least everyone was a pretty person.The plot; well there's not much I can say about the plot because it didn't really have one.  I wish they would have just left it as dancing and the strip scenes because when they tried to make it more meaningful than that, it was boring and contrived.  There were some stories about drugs and a little bit of flirting between Mike and ADam's sister, but  I didn't buy into the side plots at all and let's face it, people came to watch a movie about strippers, they probably don't care one lick about the plot so don't pretend to have one.  In fact, I would have been satisfied if it was just the stripping part; although I do realize I may have had to go to another store to purchase that dvd.  But anyways...The music and dancing in this movie is why it gets as high as three stars from me.  It was pretty fantastic and they did some great choreographing.  Tatum especially was impressive.  I really didn't know guys could move like that.  And yes the dancing was technically erotic, but there are impressive moves in that type of dancing as well.  You have to be athletic to do it well.  The music was mostly dance/club music and fit well with the movie.  And this should go without saying, but this is a movie about strippers, there is nudity, sex, cussing, some violence, and pretty much everything you can think of.  Not for children.An ok movie.  I realize my hormones are probably making me rate it higher than it deserves. But hey, sometimes you're allowed to have brain candy, and that is perfectly fine.Review by M.

The dancing was like that of a stage show. In the mid-1980's, I went with some friends; the male strippers danced to songs that include: ""Cocaine"" and ""Secret Agent Man"" they had a routine (like the man who dressed like a Secret Agent Man). At the club, I saw a long line of women, waiting for kisses from male muscular strippers (black and white). In Texas, it is against the law for a woman to be on stage with male strippers. In this movie, Channing's friend Adam, was a fool. Adam had NO common sense, he went along with everything without thinking first. The big mistake of this movie was that it was supposed to be for women but the writers threw in Adam touching that guy's girlfriend (EW); why? I would not recommend this movie because Matthew M and Adam (dumb guy) ruined the movie for me.To Hollywood writers: if you are going to make a film for women; leave the topless woman out! Focus on Channing life; as a child, teenager, family, friends, or like Mr. Mom's club/stripper scene (starring Michael Keaton). Make the movie sensitive to women because who's paying to see your movies? Straight women don't want to see a topless woman! And they sure don't want their husbands or boyfriends looking, either! Let's face it; in our Society today, the world shows more on a woman than they show on a man. On the sequel, keep it for women only.

This isn't it.This is a dark movie, literally as well as figuratively.  Most of the non-stripper footage was shot in this yellowish sepia tone.  We get it, it's a seedy, depressing sort of life.Channing Tatum is the new Patrick Swayze - a guy who can't act but can move like crazy and is just fine to look at. It's just intriguing enough that this movie is based on his own life experience.  Because we were already fantasizing about watching him strip anyway.  The dancing scenes are shot in that flash-frame seizure-inducing style that allows an R Rating in spite of frankly raunchy content.Not much in the way of a plot - guy who has more noble aspirations than stripping, but making money as a stripper to try to achieve those goals, meets a very young and rather clueless other guy and recruits him into the fold.  Young guy messes up royally and doesn't even realize it.  A few other guys and gals fill out the picture, including the mandatory creepy club owner.Cody Horn as Adam's sister is the most ""normal"" character in this movie.  She is definitely the most complex, but it doesn't quite work for me.  She is dour and uptight.  It's hard to believe that Mike could convince her to hang out in the first place.  Then when they do spend time together, she laughs at everything he says.  The transformation is not convincing.The message here is that there's nothing redeeming about the stripper lifestyle, that you adopt it out of desperation, and if you're good enough you make a lot of money.

Meanwhile, Brooke (Horn) worries about her brother's descent into a life filled with drugs, booze, and one-night stands.Now, as a man, it's clear I am not part of this film's target demographic. Also, Horn and Pettyfer are almost completely unknown to me. Horn appeared in one episode of the USA series White Collar which I know I've seen, because I've seen all of them, and Pettyfer was the lead actor in a terrible sci-fi movie titled I Am Number Four. Very entertaining film, as Soderbergh films typically are. The character of Mike is actually three-dimensional as are his friends and employers and his journey to ""enlightenment"" is well-illustrated.

1577800,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B008WCP2KG,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","""Magic Mike"" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, one of the most critically acclaimed directors in recent years. The film deals with the world of male stripping, with a story that is, it is reported, loosely based on the life of the star Channing Tatum. This is interesting, I thought, and yes, the dancing part is pretty impressive, but the rest of the film seems too slow-paced and low-keyed for me to be really interested, except the comic relief from over-the-top Matthew McConaughey.The story is about ""Magic Mike,"" a dancer (played by effective Channing Tatum) at Xquisite Strip Club in Tampa, dreaming of becoming a furniture designer. Mike befriends and takes aimless Adam (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing, and as it turns out, Adam, or The Kid, quickly gets accustomed to the new lifestyle. In the meanwhile, Mike gets acquainted with Adam's concerned sister Brooke (Cody Horn).There is a stark contrast between the ways in which the dancers' on-stage routine and off-stage life are described. One is full of loud music and well-choreographed dancing, while the other is quiet, drab and dull. I would even say too dull, because despite the interesting character of Mike and the realistic descriptions of the backstage, most characters are just cyphers. We are never allowed to know these dancers, and as to the main story of Mike, Adam and Brooke, well, I think I have seen it somewhere before.""Magic Mike"" is a missed opportunity, a film that could have been much emotionally involving with someone other than Soderbergh as director, who tends to be too self-conscious. I think I know his style, and I respect that. The film is sensitively and intelligently directed, but I think a little bit of more emotion would be welcome sometimes.",3,Needs a Little Bit More Magic,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1742,"['Magic', 'Mike', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'one', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'directors', 'recent', 'years', 'film', 'deals', 'world', 'male', 'stripping', 'story', 'reported', 'loosely', 'based', 'life', 'star', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'interesting', 'thought', 'yes', 'dancing', 'part', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'rest', 'film', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'low-keyed', 'be', 'really', 'interested', 'comic', 'relief', 'over-the-top', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey.The', 'story', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'dancer', 'played', 'effective', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Xquisite', 'Strip', 'Club', 'Tampa', 'dreaming', 'becoming', 'furniture', 'designer', 'Mike', 'befriends', 'aimless', 'Adam', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'wing', 'out', 'Adam', 'Kid', 'quickly', 'accustomed', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'meanwhile', 'Mike', 'acquainted', 'Adam', 'concerned', 'sister', 'Brooke', 'Cody', 'Horn', 'stark', 'contrast', 'ways', 'dancers', 'on-stage', 'routine', 'off-stage', 'life', 'are', 'described', 'One', 'full', 'loud', 'music', 'well-choreographed', 'dancing', 'other', 'quiet', 'drab', 'dull', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'too', 'dull', 'interesting', 'character', 'Mike', 'realistic', 'descriptions', 'backstage', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'cyphers', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'know', 'dancers', 'main', 'story', 'Mike', 'Adam', 'Brooke', 'well', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'somewhere', 'before', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'someone', 'other', 'Soderbergh', 'director', 'who', 'be', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'think', 'know', 'style', 'respect', 'film', 'sensitively', 'intelligently', 'directed', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'emotion', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'sometimes']",N/A

1577802,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008WCP2KG,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Magic Mike' refers to the protagonist of the film, Mike Lane, played by Channing Tatum. Mike is a budding entrepreneur in Tampa, Florida, who is a both a partner and performer in a male strip club, run by its over the top owner, Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Mike has aspirations to start legitimate businesses, including a custom furniture venture, but must work in the strictly cash male strip club world, in order to fund his other enterprises.Mike takes nineteen-year-old Adam under his wing who's just lost his construction job. Mike falls for Adam's medical assistant sister, Brooke, who looks at his involvement in male stripping with disdain. The film's sub-plot involves Mike's inner struggle to leave his sleazy lifestyle and court Brooke, who represents everything good, wholesome and clean.The main plot of the film involves Adam's fall from grace as he becomes seduced by drug dealers who peddle ecstasy. Adam and Mike perform at a private sorority party and are attacked by the sorority girls' boyfriends, who discover that Adam has been giving ecstasy to some of the girls. During this altercation, Adam leaves a bag worth $10,000 of ecstasy pills at the party and later Mike must pay off drug dealers who are now looking to get even with Adam.At film's end, Adam opts to move to Miami with Dallas who has opened up a bigger and better club. Mike finally has an epiphany that he'll never be able to realize his dreams as a legitimate business owner if he remains in the male strip club world and leaves Dallas and that world for Brooke, who is grateful that Mike bailed out her brother.If you're into male stripping (which I am not), this might be your cup of tea. There are plenty of scenes featuring the male strippers performing in various costumes, suggesting different venues. The female audience at the club seem to get off on the acts of simulated sex, but I suspect that most men watching this stuff will find it a big bore.One of the other problems with the story is that the Brooke character is pretty much one-dimensional. In addition to her devotion to her brother, she represents the wholesome world which Mike aspires to be part of. Hence, Cody Horn as Brooke, has little to do except wait for Mike as he finally transforms himself at the film's climax.Director Steven Soderbergh appears to be ambivalent about the male stripping world he's commenting on. On one hand, he recognizes that such a world is sleazy due to its many connections to the criminal element. For example, Adam's fall from grace is a direct result of his association with such elements. On the other hand, Soderbergh appears to revel in the actual performances of these male strippers (as evidenced by the amount of performance scenes he opts to include in his film).In the end, I wonder if exploring the male strip club world is worthy of a feature length film. Perhaps a documentary might have been more effective. Soderbergh's rather simplistic tale of redemption cannot offset the vacuousness of the world he has chosen to explore.",2,Soderbergh's exploration of vacuous world of male stripping cannot offset tale of budding entrepreneur's redemption,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3076,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Magic"", 'Mike', 'refers', 'protagonist', 'film', 'Mike', 'Lane', 'played', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Mike', 'budding', 'entrepreneur', 'Tampa', 'Florida', 'who', 'partner', 'performer', 'male', 'strip', 'club', 'run', 'top', 'owner', 'Dallas', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Mike', 'aspirations', 'start', 'legitimate', 'businesses', 'including', 'custom', 'furniture', 'venture', 'must', 'work', 'strictly', 'cash', 'male', 'strip', 'club', 'world', 'order', 'fund', 'other', 'enterprises.Mike', 'nineteen-year-old', 'Adam', 'wing', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'construction', 'job', 'Mike', 'Adam', 'medical', 'assistant', 'sister', 'Brooke', 'who', 'involvement', 'male', 'stripping', 'disdain', 'film', 'sub-plot', 'Mike', 'inner', 'struggle', 'leave', 'sleazy', 'lifestyle', 'court', 'Brooke', 'who', 'everything', 'good', 'wholesome', 'clean.The', 'main', 'plot', 'film', 'Adam', 'fall', 'grace', 'seduced', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'peddle', 'ecstasy', 'Adam', 'Mike', 'perform', 'private', 'sorority', 'party', 'are', 'attacked', 'sorority', 'girls', 'boyfriends', 'who', 'discover', 'Adam', 'been', 'giving', 'ecstasy', 'girls', 'altercation', 'Adam', 'bag', 'worth', '10,000', 'ecstasy', 'pills', 'party', 'later', 'Mike', 'must', 'pay', 'off', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'looking', 'get', 'even', 'Adam.At', 'film', 'end', 'Adam', 'move', 'Miami', 'Dallas', 'who', 'opened', 'up', 'bigger', 'better', 'club', 'Mike', 'finally', 'epiphany', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'realize', 'dreams', 'legitimate', 'business', 'owner', 'male', 'strip', 'club', 'world', 'Dallas', 'world', 'Brooke', 'who', 'grateful', 'Mike', 'bailed', 'out', 'brother.If', ""'re"", 'male', 'stripping', 'am', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'are', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'male', 'strippers', 'performing', 'various', 'costumes', 'suggesting', 'different', 'venues', 'female', 'audience', 'club', 'seem', 'get', 'off', 'acts', 'simulated', 'sex', 'suspect', 'most', 'men', 'watching', 'stuff', 'will', 'find', 'big', 'bore.One', 'other', 'problems', 'story', 'Brooke', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'one-dimensional', 'addition', 'devotion', 'brother', 'wholesome', 'world', 'Mike', 'be', 'part', 'Hence', 'Cody', 'Horn', 'Brooke', 'little', 'do', 'wait', 'Mike', 'finally', 'film', 'climax.Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'be', 'ambivalent', 'male', 'stripping', 'world', 'commenting', 'one', 'hand', 'world', 'sleazy', 'due', 'many', 'connections', 'criminal', 'element', 'example', 'Adam', 'fall', 'grace', 'direct', 'result', 'association', 'such', 'elements', 'other', 'hand', 'Soderbergh', 'revel', 'actual', 'performances', 'male', 'strippers', 'evidenced', 'amount', 'performance', 'scenes', 'include', 'film', 'end', 'wonder', 'exploring', 'male', 'strip', 'club', 'world', 'worthy', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'documentary', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'Soderbergh', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'tale', 'redemption', 'can', 'not', 'offset', 'vacuousness', 'world', 'chosen', 'explore']",N/A
