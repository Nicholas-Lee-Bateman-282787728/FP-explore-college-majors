581053,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00005BCKJ,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[1, 1]",This dire direct to video sequel lacks the humor and chills which made the original so enjoyable. This time around the roaches (known as the Judas Breed) are able to take on an almost human form. It's up to hypochondriac biology teacher Remy (Alix Koromzay) along with a cop and 2 of her students to destroy them. The only problem is they are unarmed.MIMIC 2 is generally rather tedious and adds nothing new to the genre. The only other interesting twist is that Remy takes a polaroid of herself at the exact moment one of her relationships falls apart; and has these taped on her wall. The movies ending is a real cop-out. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Why do sequels like this keep getting made?,2,Can't mimic the success of the original,1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,710,"['dire', 'direct', 'video', 'sequel', 'humor', 'chills', 'made', 'original', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'roaches', 'known', 'Judas', 'Breed', 'are', 'able', 'take', 'almost', 'human', 'form', 'up', 'hypochondriac', 'biology', 'teacher', 'Remy', 'Alix', 'Koromzay', 'cop', '2', 'students', 'destroy', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'unarmed.MIMIC', '2', 'generally', 'rather', 'tedious', 'nothing', 'new', 'genre', 'only', 'other', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Remy', 'polaroid', 'herself', 'exact', 'moment', 'one', 'relationships', 'apart', 'taped', 'wall', 'movies', 'ending', 'real', 'cop-out', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'Why', 'do', 'sequels', 'keep', 'getting', 'made']",N/A

The acting alone could not carry this movie. Sure it is a bit interesting to make it look like the killings were done by a serial killer, but most serial killers, even if they eat off their faces and their innards like Hannibal Lecter, don't leave them hung over 30 foot light poles. I wanted to like this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the first one and the characters in this one are quite good. But the story failed them. There was no exploring of the underground as there was in the first movie. A pity as that made it more suspenseful. Basicly by the time they realize the big bug is back, the military goes in to wipe it out. Worse yet one of the main characters I liked gets killed off. So all in all a bit of a disappointment. I would have given this only two stars if it wasn't for the great acting and interesting characters that made me like them. I will say the story wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Even the awesomeness that is Guillermo del Toro cannot resist the most powerful force in Hollywood: the need to make awful sequels.And so we got a del Toro-less sequel to ""Mimic,"" a movie that was already a Frankenstein's monster of studio interference. It's basically a scaled-down, grimier version of the original movie, but with the added bonus of an annoying teenager AND a soldier bug who is determined to breed... with a human. Yes, it's THAT kind of horror movie.Dead men are being found with their faces removed, strung up on wires. The only thing that connects these deaths is that they all went on dates with Remy (Alix Koromzay), who has somehow gone from a quirky entomologist to a quirky inner-city schoolteacher who is obsessed with bugs. Detective Klaski (Bruno Campos) doesn't think she did it, though.Then Klaski and Remy find out that it was actually a mutated Judas Bug that takes on the appearance of its victims. Its goal: to mate with Remy. Hence why he's been murdering any men who show interest in her, and why he traps her (plus Klaski and a couple students) in a deserted high school. At the same time, a secret government agency arrives, planning to kill everything inside the building.Like most sequels, ""Mimic 2"" is pretty much a copy of the original -- big spooky human-shaped bug stalks the heroes, who are trying to find a way to kill it -- but with a visibly smaller budget, no name stars and less gore. And of course, it is directed by Jean de Segonzac (who has mostly worked on ""Law and Order"") as the director.It also adds an uncomfortably misogynistic undercurrent, since the ONLY female character is ONLY in the movie because of her babymaking potential. She also gets ""raped"" by an insectile stinger. Ergh.But while it doesn't measure up to the original ""Mimic,"" ""Mimic 2"" is a fairly decent horror movie. It works in a claustrophobic, grimy atmosphere into the dark corridors and steam-filled basements. The Big Spooky Twist is telegraphed ahead of time (come on, who didn't guess that?), but it does mix in a grand finale that really is pants-soilingly creepy.Koromzay and Campos give pretty decent performances here, as does Gaven E. Lucas as a young boy who looks up to Remy as a mother substitute. But Will Estes is painfully annoying as a crabby old person's idea of what a teenager is like, and Edward Albert is not nearly as sinister as ""Darksuit"" is apparently supposed to be.It hasn't got the oomph of the original movie, but ""Mimic 2"" is an okay sequel with some nicely creepy moments.

Sometimes she's quirky (""I'm a wacko magnet""), sometimes she superwoman, sometimes she's annoyingly obtuse.  I get the sense she continuously asked, ""what's my motivation"" throughout the making of this movie but never got a suitable answer.  She even tried for sexpot in one scene.  I have to say I liked this movie in spite of her.  I would have liked it more had they used an actress with some ability.

If I was running the channel I'd want to get my channel name as far away from those pictures as possible especially if they don't really make them, which Sci-Fi doesn't.

She's a teacher and attracts the attention of a single Judas Breed bug who is in all seriousness attracted to her.  They don't really elaborate on this as much as they should have, but the Bug thinks she's some sort of Queen because she has alot of kids around her at school.  A very cool monster/character angle is the addition of the new ""evolution"" of the bug.  It can really mimic humans alot better than last time, and gets jealous of men that get close to her, whether they be on business terms, or for other reasons ;).  But, the bug doens't know the difference, so he just kills everyone anyway, including my favorite character who always dies in every movie..almost.

581069,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005BCKJ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[20, 22]","I saw Mimic in the movie theaters and enjoyed it.  The original plot: scientists in the near future genetically engineer bugs to stop an infestation of plague-spreading cockroaches.  They called them ""Mimics"" because they mimicked the behavior of the roaches and were able to infiltrate their nests.Fast-forward a few years and the Mimics have gotten out of hand.  Instead of being sterile, they reproduced.  And instead of just being able to mimic bugs, they are now giant-sized beetles that have an outer shell that looks a lot like a guy in an overcoat wearing a hat. In short, the Mimics started hunting us.There was way too much religious symbolism in the first movie for my tastes (from stigmata to calling the bugs ""Judas breed""), but it was a sci fi film that aimed high even if it didn't always hit the mark. Mimic 2, a direct-to-video sequel, aims low and hits its mark anyway.A minor character from the first film, Remi (Alix Koromzay), comes back as a hard-working redheaded schoolteacher who just wants to settle down with a nice guy in a soundstage-version of New York.  She has a tough time though, mostly because she seems to like bugs a little too much and talks about them a lot.What, you don't remember Remi from the first film?  Neither do I.  She was part of the CDC though, so we can assume she's fallen on hard times when we see Remi traipsing through the crumbling halls of a soon-to-be-condemned school teaching weird little freaky kids that talk about being insects and killing happy families.Remi's life is interrupted by a series of killings, all of them involving men who have their faces torn off.  The handsome Officer Klaski (Bruno Campos) enters to investigate and tolerates Remi's rambling about insects just enough to create something of a spark between them.Mimic 2 doesn't hit you over the head with the plot, which is unfortunate because sometimes you need a good whack to understand what might be obvious to the director.  Apparently, there is a Mimic from the original hive (you're shocked, I know) that's attempting to build a new hive right in the condemned schoolhouse.  We're supposed to infer all of this from Remi's conversations about a single soldier ant who is the last of his kind to die ""without a queen.""The rules of foreshadowing demand that we understand this to mean a few things: 1) that there's just one Mimic left, 2) that it's a soldier, 3) that it's looking for a queen.  If you don't catch this little dialogue and interpret it correctly, the movie doesn't really explain itself much further.  In fact, there's a scene that hit the cutting room floor that's on the DVD that explains everything. Without it the movie grasps at straws.But what about the face ripping?  Here's a quote from The Thing to help you out: ""Man is the warmest place to hide.""That said, there are lots of surprises, shocks, and twists in the movie.  The director (Jean de Segonzac) is competent and the writing (Joel Soisson) is well done. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have bad timing.  In at least two scenes, the movie gives itself away too early-by about 10 seconds in each case.  What the lone Mimic soldier is doing and what it plans to do is quite sinister, but pulling off the surprise twist requires careful timing, which this movie lacks. De Segonzac has directed TV, mostly, so maybe that's part of the problem.The characters are a mixed bag.  Remi's suitably quirky, although a little TOO quirky at times.  The guys she dates rate high on the creep-o-scale, a fact that of course guarantees they will all die horrible, faceless deaths.  The two kids Remi struggles to protect (Nicky played by Wil Estes and Sal played by Gaven Lucas) are really one-dimensional but are suitable foils for Remi's motherly instincts.  Detective Klaski is well done, as is the government agent who competes with him to exterminate the bug. When Detect Klaski encounters the Mimic, he empties his entire gun into it, grabs a gun from his ankle holster, and fires the rest of that too.  Now THAT'S what a normal cop would do when faced with a giant bug!Not that it helps.  Fortunately, the special effects are sparsely used.  There are occasional computer graphics, but for the most part the bug is a rubber suit just off screen.  We never see it in good lighting; a good thing too, given that when we do see the big bug it looks like a guy in a suit.  The director works with what he's got and uses it sparingly.The ending is the big payoff, but your reaction to it will really depend on your perspective of the film throughout.  If you think the idea of a bug taking the role of a serial killer and stalker is preposterous, the ending is so ridiculously absurd that it's just plain comical.  If you think the idea of a big bug flying around trying to stick its ovipositor in your gut is disturbing, then the ending will keep you awake at night.  It's all a bit misogynistic, actually, but then most stalker movies are.Koromzay is no Mira Sorvino, but she does okay.  There's a cut scene where a creepy cigarette-smoking guy who sits in the stairwell of the building explains how Remi is an ""average-looking chick that guys think they have a chance with,"" which explains why she has so many problems.  That's sums up the movie too...it knows it's a direct to video sequel and doesn't try to be more than it is.",3,direct-to-video movie that doesn't try to be more than it is,1106611200,"01 25,

When I seen there was a sequel I was interested in seeing where the movie makers would take the story next. Yet, this was pretty ridiculous.A minor character from the first movie returns as a hip, cool teacher in the Bronx. Her love life sucks and she has more respect and admiration for bugs then she does for men. She also has a tendency to date some really horrible characters. Well she is definitely in for a suprise because her next date is guaranteed to be worse. Apparently, a bug from the Judus experiment is loose in the school where she works and it has taken a liken to the bug lady. It has choosen this lucky girl to be the mother of his larva (or larvae...whatever!) With the help of a cop who is hot on the scent! They attempt to defeat the mimic.Now seriously....the problem I had with this movie was it didn't explain itself like the first Mimic. In this techno-science age it was plausible (almost) to believe that a mutant bug could be created that would have the ability to mimic human beings, their greatest predator. There was some believablity there, but this movie doesn't even explain why a bug would suddenly decide that a human woman is the perfect host for his children. I was left wondering at the end of the film what was really going on with the bug. Then they took it to the next level at the end and attempted to portray that the bug actually had some kind of affection for the lady in question.

581073,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005BCKJ,trebe,"[3, 4]","The original Mimic was an exciting and enjoyable bug movie.  There were a few problems with the concept, but the movie was suspenseful and exciting.  The low-budget sequel, Mimic 2 really adds nothing and shows how good the original was.  Recycling is plainly evident when the cover of the Mimic 2 DVD is actually taken from the original Mimic movie poster.The second time around, the element of surprise is gone, and it's much harder to create any suspense.  The movie centers on Remi Panos, a minor character from the first movie, where she was an assistant to the Mira Sorvino character.  The same actress, Alix Koromzay reprises her role from the first movie, but her appearance between the two films is so different, that it was difficult to recognize her as the same person.  Minus the frizzy hair, and the jewelry in her previously pierced nose, Remi is a now a science teacher who still gets around town on a bicycle.  Repeating a scene from the first movie, she once again bumps into the creature with her bike in an alley (Yes that was her).  She also continues the odd practice of taking Poloroids of her face.Men seem to be a problem for Remi, and more so, as various men in her life start to turn up dead, with their faces disfigured.  A local cop named Klaski (Bruno Campos), begins an investigation, and finds that the Feds are poking around too.  This time there is just one ""Judas breed"" roach on the loose (the budget you know), and he has nested in Remi's school, apparently to be close to her.  Mr. Roach makes his move, trapping Remi in the school with two boys.  Klaski shows up at the school to attempt a rescue.  While the Feds lead by an agent identified only as ""Darksuit"" (Edward Albert), impotently stand around outside the school, unwilling to confront the roach.  Waving guns, they unleash a giant canister of insecticide.Mimic 2 is just weak, and the ending is totally unbelievable.  The original concept, is extended to remove all credibility.

581074,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005BCKJ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Five years after the success of original ""Mimic,"" Demention Films brought back again the same bug-monster, but with a different cast.  In place of Mira Sorvino, who played the main character of entomologist Susan Tyler, Alix Kromozay re-appears as Remi, who briefly showed up as Susan's assistant.  If you remember her role in the original, you have a terrific memory.The story is basically the same.  Remi is now working at a school, teaching kids about the insects she seems to love more than humans, especially annoying guys, who literally keep on bugging poor Remi after her unfortunate dates with them.  Thus the sequel streches Remi's character, who actually vanishes in the second half of the original, but showed a glimpse of promising touch of more lively characterization.But I never dreamed that they stretch the premise that much!  Yes, Remi was unlucky in love five years ago, and took a picture of her own face after being treated badly by men.  But now it seems she collected many, many relics of her failed dates (see her closet full of photoes), and she is about to experience the most awful date with a bug, a big deadly bug, which apparently has became a stalker like a human.The sequel would not look ridiculous if you ignore the logic of the monster which literally keeps on bugging the leading lady.  There are some creepy moments (like a body dragged virtically upward) but the real surprise is the lead Alix Kromzay.  Her acting as Remy shows, despite its silly premises and diaglogue, enough strong power to carry the whole show to the end, with unexpected wry humor and even sexiness.Though the film displays the good use of lighting and rain, its ending part looks too outrageous -- it is suggested that the bug-monster is trying to adore her and ... make love (no way!) while stabbiing Alix Kromzay's character -- and the choice of school as bug-infected nest is not a wise decision, compared with the more realistic image of underground world of deserted subway in the original ""Mimic,"" but, the sequel should be called, considering its $ 10m. budget, adequate.Little special effects and short running time is a dead giveaway of the low budget backgorund of the film.  However, within those limited conditions, it ends up with a slightly better monster horror flick, probably better than average TV movies you see on cable TV, if not on the same height of the original.

After all, it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that didn't do very well at the box office to begin with. However, even with my low expectations I was disappointed. The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out. So, it has to mate so the species will continue to survive. However, this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans. Therefore, the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human. Get it? Pretty twisted, huh? Good.
