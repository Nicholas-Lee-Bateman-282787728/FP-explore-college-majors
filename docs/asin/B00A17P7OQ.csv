1603573,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00A17P7OQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I&#8217;ve heard a lot of good things about the gay-centered drama &#8216;Yossi & Jagger&#8217;, from the early aughts, but I never got around to seeing it.  Still, I ran across the sequel the other day and decided to give it a watch.  I know what many are thinking, and that is that you really can&#8217;t watch a sequel without seeing the first film first, but I&#8217;ll say this; &#8216;Yossi&#8217; is a standalone film and really doesn&#8217;t need the first film to be appreciated on its own.  In fact, this film has enough shading of backstory to fill in the audience on what they missed in the first film, and in my eyes this almost works entirely as its own feature, without the presence of &#8216;Yossi & Jagger&#8217;.  This isn&#8217;t to say that the films don&#8217;t work together, and even work together better (like I said, I&#8217;ve only seen this film) but if I didn&#8217;t know that there was a film that came before this, I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed with while watching &#8216;Yossi&#8217;.  This feels very much like a singular story, and for that I was grateful.This doesn&#8217;t mean that it works entirely, but I&#8217;ll get to that in a minute.&#8216;Yossi&#8217; tells the story of Dr. Yossi Gutmann, a gay man hiding (or more &#8216;not disclosing&#8217;) his sexual orientation from his colleges and pretty much living a quiet and uneventful life.  He has lost love (the death of his military lover Jagger) and this has scared him emotionally, leaving him a ghost almost.  He wanders through his life, sad and alone, seeking senseless escapades online and crawling deeper inside his shell of shame and regret.  Then he meets a group of young soldiers, and one a whim starts up a &#8216;sort of&#8217; relationship with one, a friendship from a distance that awakens Yossi&#8217;s thirst for life and love once again.As a whole, &#8216;Yossi&#8217; is a nice film.  It is anchored by a beautiful performance by Ohad Knoller, reprising his role from &#8216;Yossi & Jagger&#8217; and shading Yossi with so much internalized anguish.  Watching his bloom near the film&#8217;s end is beautiful to see, and this is a real testament to the honesty Knoller brings to the role.  Still, &#8216;Yossi&#8217; also feels somewhat like a non-event.  While the film does have that nice climax, bringing Yossi&#8217;s struggle full circle, it almost feels like too little too late.  We wait the entire film for something to happen, and when it does the film ends abruptly and we are left wondering why we waited so long for so little to actually happen.  The film has questionable pacing because of this fact (it drags a little in parts) but is so light you almost don&#8217;t feel that.  Like I said, it is a nice film and Knoller is fantastic.Still, when it&#8217;s over, that is that and you move on, not looking back once.I will say this though; seeing Lior Ashkenazi was a real treat for me.  Ashkenazi gives one of my FAVORITRE performances of the aughts in &#8216;Late Marriage&#8217; and seeing him in another film (I stupidly have not kept up with his career) was a surprise, but a great one.  He&#8217;s also still a stone cold fox, so I did wish that he had a larger role here (especially since his role was so&#8230;provocative).",4,"A likable, forgettable story about life&#8230;",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3261,"['8217', 've', 'heard', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'gay-centered', 'drama', '8216', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', '8217', 'early', 'aughts', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'Still', 'ran', 'sequel', 'other', 'day', 'decided', 'give', 'watch', 'know', 'what', 'many', 'are', 'thinking', 'really', 'can', '8217', 'watch', 'sequel', 'seeing', 'first', 'film', 'first', '8217', 'say', '8216', 'Yossi', '8217', 'standalone', 'film', 'really', 'doesn', '8217', 'need', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'appreciated', 'own', 'fact', 'film', 'enough', 'shading', 'backstory', 'fill', 'audience', 'what', 'missed', 'first', 'film', 'eyes', 'almost', 'entirely', 'own', 'feature', 'presence', '8216', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', '8217', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'say', 'films', 'don', '8217', 'work', 'together', 'even', 'work', 'together', 'better', 'said', '8217', 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'didn', '8217', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'came', 'wouldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'guessed', 'watching', '8216', 'Yossi', '8217', 'very', 'much', 'singular', 'story', 'was', 'grateful.This', 'doesn', '8217', 'mean', 'entirely', '8217', 'get', 'minute.', '8216', 'Yossi', '8217', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Yossi', 'Gutmann', 'gay', 'man', 'hiding', 'more', '8216', 'not', 'disclosing', '8217', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'colleges', 'pretty', 'much', 'living', 'quiet', 'uneventful', 'life', 'lost', 'love', 'death', 'military', 'lover', 'Jagger', 'scared', 'emotionally', 'leaving', 'ghost', 'almost', 'life', 'sad', 'alone', 'seeking', 'senseless', 'escapades', 'online', 'crawling', 'deeper', 'shell', 'shame', 'regret', 'Then', 'group', 'young', 'soldiers', 'one', 'whim', 'up', '8216', 'sort', '8217', 'relationship', 'one', 'friendship', 'distance', 'Yossi', '8217', 'thirst', 'life', 'love', 'once', 'whole', '8216', 'Yossi', '8217', 'nice', 'film', 'anchored', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Ohad', 'Knoller', 'reprising', 'role', '8216', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', '8217', 'shading', 'Yossi', 'so', 'much', 'internalized', 'anguish', 'Watching', 'bloom', 'film', '8217', 's', 'end', 'beautiful', 'see', 'real', 'testament', 'honesty', 'Knoller', 'role', 'Still', '8216', 'Yossi', '8217', 'also', 'somewhat', 'non-event', 'film', 'have', 'nice', 'climax', 'bringing', 'Yossi', '8217', 'struggle', 'full', 'circle', 'almost', 'feels', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'wait', 'entire', 'film', 'something', 'happen', 'when', 'film', 'abruptly', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'little', 'actually', 'happen', 'film', 'questionable', 'pacing', 'fact', 'little', 'parts', 'so', 'light', 'almost', 'don', '8217', 'feel', 'said', 'nice', 'film', 'Knoller', 'fantastic.Still', 'when', '8217', 's', 'move', 'not', 'looking', 'back', 'once.I', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'seeing', 'Lior', 'Ashkenazi', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'Ashkenazi', 'one', 'FAVORITRE', 'performances', 'aughts', '8216', 'Late', 'Marriage', '8217', 'seeing', 'film', 'stupidly', 'have', 'not', 'kept', 'up', 'career', 'was', 'surprise', 'great', 'one', '8217', 's', 'also', 'still', 'stone', 'cold', 'fox', 'did', 'wish', 'had', 'larger', 'role', 'here', 'especially', 'role', 'was', 'so', '8230', 'provocative']",N/A

I thought it was a very real an honest movie that just happened to be gay-themed as well.

Even though he has become a successful doctor, we see that he is still aimless and lost.  And I liked that he finds someone who renews hope in him.

He is mired in a morass of his loss - the love of his life, Jagger - and engulfing himself in his work.  There is much to like about this film, but unlike the earlier film, which was shot like a documentary and very honest in its directness of portrayal, both of the love story, and the other relationships of the soldiers, this film is more cinematic, though still staying close to its honest portrayal of the characters.We first see him now as a doctor specializing in the heart.  Then there is his friend and colleague, Moti, played by the excellent Lior Ashkenazy, says 'he looks like an operating table'. Lior's role of supportive friend - enough that he is ready to engage in a 3-way with Yossi in a bar's toilet in order to pull him out of his funk, is one that makes you sit up and say ""Wow"" to yourself!!Ohad Knoller has gained a lot of weight for this role, and he carries the gravitas of his loss believably.  He still mourns Jagger.  The scene when he reconnects with Jagger's parents is moving, and provides a believable catalyst for Yossi's escape.  The film tends to move a little slowly in places (for me, as a non-Israeli gay person, the cabaret scenes seemed to be too long and heavy), but the comedic moments are brilliant and touching on the issue of same-sex partners and being a widower was deftly handled.  Also, the sometimes-brutal quality of Jewish directness balances here with Yossi's nearly painful hesitancy and reserve.Also, Oz, the younger 'love interest' is very interesting here.  Yossi offers a ride to a group of young soldiers who missed their bus.  There is nothing 'cruisy' about his action.  Along the way, ""Tom's"" openness about his sexuality, his mates' clearly accepting attitude and Yossi's past serious military background all meld as we watch Tom become the pursuer : he senses in Yossi a deeply powerful kindred connection, and his tender yet confident approach with Yossi is believable and masculinely tender - no ageism here from him nor his military friends, who jokingly, and affectionately tag Yossi with the nickname ""Mozart"" (an ironic tie back to ""Jagger""?) because of his love of older style music.  If only there were such younger gay men in America!Note : There is some male nudity here (though not 'full frontal'), so if that offends you, be prepared!All-in-all, a film I enjoyed, and wonder if there will be another film 5 or 10 years down the line titled ""Yossi & Tom""?!

Eytan Fox, 2012, 85 minutes, Hebrew, English subtitles) is the 10-year-later sequel to the bittersweetYossi & Jagger(2002), a gay love story involving a unit commander and a soldier under his command. Which, by the way, I have always wanted to see but haven't yet.YOSSI, though, is a film I LOVED. Some may say it's boring, too short, drags too much - I disagree but I can understand some bored reactions.Here, Dr. Yossi Guttman (Ohad Knoller, who bears a resemblance to Russell Crowe) - now a renowned cardiologist - still struggles with his grief, his post traumatic stress and the even worse hell of a love lost. After struggling at work, overweight, alone and horribly sad, the day comes when Dr. Guttman is responsible for a patient's death - or at least he thinks he's responsible. That is the day he takes off for a vacation.It's not as though he completely gave up: his attempt to hook up with a hot guy and his equally earnest chasing of the past by following his deceased boyfriend's mother all prove he's trying to kick-start his heart. But this cardiologist, who saves lives to compensate for the one that really mattered, cannot repair his own heart.And vacation day is the day he meets the beautiful, young gay Israeli soldier Tom (a stunning dessert by the name of Oz Zehavi, who looks a bit like Ryan Phillippe). Tom takes an instant, powerful liking to Dr. Guttman, and part of the deeply enjoyable drama plus humor here is watching Tom flirt with the good doctor while the doctor takes an instant shine to Tom as well. Only the doctor is not quite certain what he should do, or how to do it!It's so funny it's sad, and it is supposed to be sad.In fact, I found it arresting, beautiful, like a powerful poem. Though it may strike the viewer as predictable - after all, it's two gay men meeting for the first time - it is haunting and lovely, or as they say in Hebrew, ""yoffi"". Tom immediately loves the great, sad, brave mind he has encountered in the doctor; the doctor, ashamed of letting himself go and putting on about 30 LBS., feeling old and of course ""widowed"", puts up a hopeless attempt at resisting Tom's charms.This film can be the only film in existence in which the director has caused his character to close up to the audience also. What I mean is, Dr. Guttman keeps it all bottled up, and he doesn't want anyone seeing anything of his interior life. The director skillfully conveys that to the audience, who is no wiser about the doctor than anyone in the film.As an example, very late in the film we see the doctor crying - but only from behind, in a pitch-black silhouette. He wouldn't want anyone seeing him weep, and that includes the audience. It is beautifully done.But the ending will make you cry - assuming YOU have a heart. Rest assured they would be healing tears. Though I think I missed a little since I haven't been able to enjoy the original film YOSSI AND JAGGER, this sequel stands beautifully on its own. It is necessary to know Dr. Guttman was a beloved, heroic unit commander, making him a dangerously skilled fighter and hero.Now, he is a new kind of hero: the kind who heals himself by finally allowing another to do it for him with a true, honest love.While I rank this film among the uppermost of all gay films, be sure to listen to it in the original Hebrew. Knoller's voice drips in turns with sadness, exhaustion and anger, but will make your eyes crinkle when you finally hear him chuckle. My wife and I both noted Dr. Guttman chuckles like I do, and in the film Tom ribs him about his ""weird laugh"".Tom's (that is, Zehavi's) slightly lisping, sweet, soft voice will relax you and then you'll get a sense of what this young man means to the older, world-weary doctor.The only minor aches this film gave me were things that seemed unlikely; they only seem that way I suppose. Get this marvelous classic and see if you pick up on anything. If you like this film, might I suggest Colin Firth's tour-de-force performance inA Single Man(see my review).",5,"Physician, heal thyself",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,4019,"['YOSSI', 'Dir', 'Eytan', 'Fox', '2012', '85', 'minutes', 'Hebrew', 'English', 'subtitles', '10-year-later', 'sequel', 'bittersweetYossi', 'Jagger', '2002', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'involving', 'unit', 'commander', 'soldier', 'command', 'Which', 'way', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet.YOSSI', 'film', 'LOVED', 'may', 'say', 'boring', 'too', 'short', 'drags', 'too', 'much', 'disagree', 'can', 'understand', 'bored', 'reactions.Here', 'Dr.', 'Yossi', 'Guttman', 'Ohad', 'Knoller', 'who', 'resemblance', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'now', 'renowned', 'cardiologist', 'still', 'grief', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'even', 'worse', 'hell', 'love', 'lost', 'struggling', 'work', 'overweight', 'alone', 'horribly', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Guttman', 'responsible', 'patient', 'death', 'least', 'responsible', 'day', 'off', 'vacation.It', 'not', 'completely', 'gave', 'up', 'attempt', 'hook', 'up', 'hot', 'guy', 'equally', 'earnest', 'chasing', 'past', 'following', 'deceased', 'boyfriend', 'mother', 'all', 'trying', 'kick-start', 'heart', 'cardiologist', 'who', 'lives', 'compensate', 'one', 'really', 'mattered', 'can', 'not', 'repair', 'own', 'heart.And', 'vacation', 'day', 'day', 'beautiful', 'young', 'gay', 'Israeli', 'soldier', 'Tom', 'stunning', 'dessert', 'name', 'Oz', 'Zehavi', 'who', 'bit', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Tom', 'instant', 'powerful', 'liking', 'Dr.', 'Guttman', 'part', 'deeply', 'enjoyable', 'drama', 'humor', 'here', 'watching', 'Tom', 'flirt', 'good', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'instant', 'shine', 'Tom', 'as', 'well', 'Only', 'doctor', 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'how', 'do', 'so', 'funny', 'sad', 'supposed', 'be', 'sad.In', 'fact', 'found', 'arresting', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'poem', 'may', 'strike', 'viewer', 'predictable', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'meeting', 'first', 'time', 'haunting', 'lovely', 'say', 'Hebrew', 'yoffi', 'Tom', 'immediately', 'great', 'sad', 'brave', 'mind', 'encountered', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'ashamed', 'letting', 'go', 'putting', '30', 'LBS.', 'feeling', 'old', 'course', 'widowed', 'up', 'hopeless', 'attempt', 'resisting', 'Tom', 'charms.This', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'film', 'existence', 'director', 'caused', 'character', 'close', 'up', 'audience', 'also', 'What', 'mean', 'Dr.', 'Guttman', 'bottled', 'up', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'anything', 'interior', 'life', 'director', 'skillfully', 'audience', 'who', 'wiser', 'doctor', 'anyone', 'film.As', 'example', 'very', 'late', 'film', 'see', 'doctor', 'crying', 'only', 'behind', 'pitch-black', 'silhouette', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'weep', 'audience', 'beautifully', 'done.But', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'assuming', 'YOU', 'have', 'heart', 'Rest', 'would', 'be', 'healing', 'tears', 'think', 'missed', 'little', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'enjoy', 'original', 'film', 'YOSSI', 'AND', 'JAGGER', 'sequel', 'beautifully', 'own', 'necessary', 'know', 'Dr.', 'Guttman', 'was', 'beloved', 'heroic', 'unit', 'commander', 'making', 'dangerously', 'skilled', 'fighter', 'hero.Now', 'new', 'kind', 'hero', 'kind', 'who', 'finally', 'allowing', 'do', 'true', 'honest', 'love.While', 'rank', 'film', 'uppermost', 'gay', 'films', 'be', 'sure', 'listen', 'original', 'Hebrew', 'Knoller', 'voice', 'drips', 'turns', 'sadness', 'exhaustion', 'anger', 'will', 'make', 'eyes', 'crinkle', 'when', 'finally', 'hear', 'chuckle', 'wife', 'noted', 'Dr.', 'Guttman', 'do', 'film', 'Tom', 'weird', 'laugh', '.Tom', 'Zehavi', 'slightly', 'lisping', 'sweet', 'soft', 'voice', 'will', 'relax', 'then', ""'ll"", 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'young', 'man', 'older', 'world-weary', 'doctor.The', 'only', 'minor', 'aches', 'film', 'gave', 'were', 'things', 'seemed', 'unlikely', 'only', 'seem', 'way', 'suppose', 'Get', 'marvelous', 'classic', 'see', 'pick', 'up', 'anything', 'like', 'film', 'might', 'suggest', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'inA', 'Single', 'Man', 'see', 'review']",N/A

Not only is this a fine follow-up film, a glance back at a gay love affair the took place in the Israeli Army that ended in the death of one of the lovers, it offers a story of the healing of grieving as well as the dramatic changes that have taken place in Israel concerning the current acceptance of gay men serving opening in the military. Times are changing, at last.In the ten years since Dr. Yossi Guttman (the sensitive actor Ohad Knoller recreating his original role) lost his lover in the war while fighting he has become an honored but overworked cardiologist, living alone, having gained weight, and his only social life is connecting with same sex dates on the Internet. One of his dates (who responded to an earlier photo of Yossi) is Yariv (Gil Desiano), a young hunk who when Yossi comes to Yariv's house shows disdain for Yossi's misrepresenting himself and settles for a quickie just to get Yossi to leave. Yossi's other 'social life' comes from the nurse Lea (Nuria Lusinzky) who has a crush on him and makes advances that Yossi rebuffs. After a minor error in the OR Yossi's fellow doctors insist he take a vacation to recuperate his exhaustion. Yossi sees a woman in the admitting area, recognizes her as Jagger's mother Varda (Orly Silbersatz), does her echo cardiogram, and subsequently drives her home (Varda does not know Yossi). After Yossi's friend newly divorced friend Moti (Lior Ashkenazi) tries to get Yossi a female sexual encounter, Yossi decides to take the recommended break from the hospital, but before he leave he visits Varda and her husband to share with them his affair with their son: only the father is sensitive to Yossi's past and shares Jagger's room with him.Yossi departs for a vacation to Eilat and on the road he meets four young Israeli soldiers - Nimrod (Meir Golan), Fefer (Shlomi Ben Attar), Benda (Amir Jerassi) and the openly gay Tom (Oz Zehavi) - and gives them a ride to a resort in Eilat. There Tom represents all the buoyancy of young love that recalls the Yossi/Jagger affair and the meeting of these two needy people alters Yossi's life and future.The entire cast is splendid and the screenplay by Italy Segal provides a fast moving, sensitive, and very touching resolution of an emotionally injured man's life, giving him a fresh start in a different world. There is humor, many touching moments, and sense of understatement that pervades the films of Eytan Fox. The film is in Hebrew with subtitles: the subtitles are very difficult to read so be prepared (if you don't understand Hebrew) to pause the film now and then to capture the meaningful dialog.

This is a story of what happens to Yossi later in life, and the fact that ten years later Jagger isn't still an integral part of it is both normal and fine with me.What does offend me greatly is the way Yossi is presented as if his being over 30 and slightly heavier than an anorexic fashion model makes him gross and repellent, incredibly lucky if any man even slightly younger or thinner looks at him without vomiting or at least sneering. Obesity is far too extreme a term, and even overweight is unreasonable. Yossi is a normal size, and he is by far the sexiest man in this movie. It's any other man who's lucky to get him, not the other way around.The movie's second great offense is Lior Ashkenazi, as Yossi's pseudo-friend and fellow cardiologist Moti. Somebody in addition to Ashkenazi himself evidently finds him overwhelmingly attractive, but not me. I can't stand him. The most disgusting, most infuriating movie scene I've seen in years has him bringing a girl into the bar restroom where Yossi is peeing and trying to work up a sleazy threesome even though Yossi clearly isn't interested.I know Moti is supposed to be disgusting, as are several others in this movie; but I already know that most people - especially straight men (and, unfortunately, most young gay men, like a smug, insufferable jerk Yossi meets online, and even the supposedly hot but arrogant and ugly soldier Tom who forces himself on Yossi near the end) - are disgusting, and having offensive behavior rubbed in my face doesn't entertain me.I love Ohad Knoller, and the older and beefier he gets the sexier he gets, but he's wasted in this sadly and annoyingly shallow movie.

1603601,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00A17P7OQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 27]","What a difference ten years can make!  Director Eytan Fox and star Ohad Knoller return to catch up with the titular character Yossi from their powerfully understated 2002 film ""Yossi and Jagger.""  Simply and appropriately titled ""Yossi,"" this sequel-of-sorts is really an entirely different beast.  The original film was not just a love story, but a look into the workings and relationships within a small Israeli army outpost.  It had an almost documentary feel, a voyeuristic fly-on-the-wall vibe in which you learned about camp life by catching brief exchanges and small moments between all of the characters.  In that way, it had a daring simplicity in style (and was not, perhaps, the movie that some people might have wanted).  I, personally, think these choices made the film a great and challenging experience.  The Yossi and Jagger pairing was woven into a much larger tapestry.  So when the movie turned its focus on their fate, it was all the more real and devastating.  ""Yossi,"" set exactly ten years later, might aptly be described as a more conventional character study.  It is all about Yossi, so Knoller is front and center for every scene.We quickly learn that immediately after leaving the army, Yossi decided to study medicine.  Now a weary and isolated doctor, he still seems haunted by past events and lost love.  He has shut himself off from experiencing emotional vulnerability, and even life itself.  The first half of the film highlights the mundane existence he has created by continuing to act as others expect him to.  He's in the closet at work, and is distant to the two people who want to get closer to him.  One day, he notices a waiting patient.  It is Jagger's mother.  And seeing her seems to awaken an uncertainty in Yossi.  Instead of carrying on in apathy, he starts to confront some of the issues he has kept buried.  Thusly, the second half of the film plays as a emotional sojourn (physical as well, I suppose, as he sets off on a road trip).  I won't say much more, but the subtle film is really about whether Yossi can reconnect with some aspect of his former self.  Can he return to a mental state where happiness is possible?I really enjoyed ""Yossi.""  Early scenes can be quite funny as the deadpan Knoller has an appealing awkwardness.  His Internet hook-up is hilariously believable.  As the movie takes to the road, you see Yossi's interest perk up slightly as he joins forces with a band of young soldiers.  He is drawn to an openly homosexual man (Oz Zehavi) and this helps him reflect on the path he chose.  There is a sweetness and hopefulness that permeates this second half.  Truthfully, though, Yossi is a lot of work!  I'm never quite sure why everyone takes the time to struggle so hard with him.  His divorcing friend, a nurse crushing on him, and the young man all do double duty to get him to show any signs of life.  And if you're expecting much in the way of transformation or catharsis, it's incredibly slight.  Still, Knoller is very good and Zehavi has charm to spare.  Perhaps ""Yossi"" isn't a new classic, but it was interesting to catch up with this character at a different point in his life.

In Yossi, his latest offering, all the aforementioned qualities are presented in a great cast and storyline.The problem with the storyline however, is that it seems highly unbelievable to me. The lead character's significant depression is a good example. I know that they have antidepressants and quality psychotherapy in Israel. To be this depressed, as Yossi seems, for a 10 year period, without someone along the way suggesting getting help, seems ludicrous to me.  It also doesn't make sense to me that he appears to have friends and acquaintances that attempt to help him out with his depression, seem to get nowhere with it, and yet continue to attempt to keep working on him. Most people would move on.The creepy part of the story is how he handles his heart patient, his dead lover's Mother. He shows up at her home, unannounced, tells his sad story, and burdens her and the lover's Father with all his stuff, stored up over the past 10 year. The Father seems a decent sort and attempts to help him out. But his Sad Sack routine should not have been visited on his patient. He should have been dealing with it in a more appropriate way.It was hard to believe that the young soldier, Tom, who made a serious play for Yossi, would have been realistically attracted to him. From the looks of him, and his bubbly personality, and major attractiveness, choosing someone as depressed and with such poor self esteem as Yossi would have been a choice  way down on the list of possible applicants for his heart.It would have been very interesting if Eytan had gone into the psychology of why Tom would find Yossi attractive and pursue him with such ardor. Clearing up that information would have added a great deal to the film and helped make the story much better. Instead, he slapped on this happy ending to the film, way too soon, without examining the psychology behind it ,and what lead up to it.Unfortunately, the film was a disappointment that could have been much better with a longer and more inclusive story.
