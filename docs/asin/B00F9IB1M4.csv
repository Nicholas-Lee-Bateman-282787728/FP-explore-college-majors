1670875,A1BIS6FID9J16M,B00F9IB1M4,Adam Silvia,"[29, 41]","I received my copy of Dragon Ball Z Blu Ray Season set today in the mail, and I'm very pleased with it.  When I first read that Dragon Ball Z Blu-Ray season sets were going to be in 16:9 ratio, I was very disappointed.  Like many other fans I was worried that the cropping was going to cut some of the picture out of the screen, but after watching a few episodes, I noticed that it's not that bad.  It does cut some picture out, but it's selective, and it isn't that bad.  The good thing about this release is that the colors are very bright, and Dragon Ball looks amazing in high definition.  The color quality feels very refreshing, and gives me hope for more Dragon Ball releases.  This particular set has English, Japanese, and the original English broadcast audio versions.  My one problem I have is that the original Japanese theme song does not have the Japanese subs along with the English subs.  I like to be able to read both at the same time, so I can see how the Japanese is pronounced along with the English translation.  My second issue I have with this set, is that when you play the English audio the guitar music plays without the sung lyrics.  I would like the option to hear the Japanese music with the English dubbed episodes just like it is with the Dragon Boxes.  I'm also very impressed with the case's artwork and quality.  I recommend this set for hardcore Dragon Ball fans, new fans, and people who missed out on the very limited edition Dragon Boxes.  Please support this release.  This set includes episodes 1-39.Funimation's first attempt at a Blu-Ray release was canceled due to poor sales, and not enough support.  The first Blu-Ray release was in 4:3, and it didn't sell well, so I can't blame Funimation for releasing the new release in 16:9 ratio.  One more good note is that the episode titles are remade too.Disk four has some extras that include a upcoming special feature sneak peak, textless opening song and closing song, the U.S. Blu-Ray trailer, and other trailers for more animes.",5,"His Power Level's Over 9000!!!!!

Yes, they cut a bit on the tops and bottoms to make it fit widescreen but it looks INCREDIBLE, SO much better than it ever did in other formats!  Looks and sounds amazing.  Tops.Why am I torn?  I liked the pacing of Kai, and didn't mind the standard 4:3 ratio.  HOWEVER, in Kai they took the initiative to re-draw several sequences, but they looked so jarring and out of place compared to the rest of the footage that it just took you out of the experience.  I couldn't get into Kai.  Right when I would be getting into it, there'd be an obnoxiously CLEAN, SHARP scene and you just snap out of it like, &#34;ugh.&#34;And honestly, it's much more immersive without the black bars on the sides.  I'm sorry; as much as I don't care for the filler in the original series, I'm gonna have to give this set the nod.  If you have the older orange-box DVD releases and didn't mind the aspect ratio, and want to step your collection up to the HD age, you should definitely pick this up.  It has all the audio tracks included; Japanese, English dub/Japanese Music and English dub/FUNimation music.  Very complete.If you're a purist who NEEDS those lost inches of footage in the 4:3 ratio, stay away.  Otherwise, you're in for a treat.

Stephen Alderson,"[35, 52]","I don't actually own this release, however I was able to borrow a friend's copy just so I would be able to give a (almost un-biased) review. For this review, I watched and compared episodes 1-34Pros:- In terms of picture quality, it is slightly less grainy than the Level 1.1 and 1.2 Blu-ray sets; but it's barely noticeable unless you looked very hard. In comparison with the Dragon Box....well let me put it this way: in order for the Dragon Box to be as high quality as possible, Toei subtlety brightened the episodes to tweak the color palette; in some instances this helps (like bringing out Goku's dark orange and dark blue Gi to a bright orange and a slightly light blue Gi) and in other instances it hurts (like when the bright lime green grass is changed to a pale light green grass). With this release (and the previously mentioned Level 1.1 and 1.2 release), FUNimation balances things out by slightly brightening the episodes and using color correction when needed. Overall the animation is beautifully remastered which breathes new life into this 30 year old anime-Once again, FUNimation gives us the option to watch the episodes in either:a) the original Japanese dub with the Japanese musicb) the US English dub with the Japanese musicc) the US English dub with the US Nathan Johnson/Bruce Faulconer musicNow for the Cons:- Unfortunately, these episodes are cropped into 16:9 widescreen. In terms of cropping, between the orange brick season sets and this release there is virtually no difference. The bits of visual information that were lost before are lost once again. The payoff of cropping it into widescreen is, once again, not worth it.The overall:Overall, if you're just a casual fan who wants to upgrade your collection from DVD to Blu-ray, then this is not a bad buy.If you are a die hard fan of the Japanese version with original opening title cards, original title cards, end credit title cards and original next episode previews, then this set isn't for you and I would recommend buying the Dragon Box sets.If you are a die hard fan of the US/Toonami version with the Nathan Johnson/Bruce Faulconer BGM but were disappointed with the orange brick season DVD boxsets that cropped the original native full screen 4:3 aspect ratio into wide screen 16:9 aspect ratio then, once again, this set isn't for you and I would recommend buying the Level 1.1 and Level 1.2 Blu-ray sets because those sets kept the episodes in the 4:3 full screen.",3,From someone who has done an extensive and time consuming comparison,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,2462,"['do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'own', 'release', 'however', 'was', 'able', 'borrow', 'friend', 'copy', 'just', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'give', 'almost', 'un-biased', 'review', 'review', 'watched', 'compared', 'episodes', '1-34Pros', 'terms', 'picture', 'quality', 'slightly', 'less', 'grainy', 'Level', '1.1', '1.2', 'Blu-ray', 'sets', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'looked', 'very', 'hard', 'comparison', 'Dragon', 'Box', '.well', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'order', 'Dragon', 'Box', 'be', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'possible', 'Toei', 'subtlety', 'brightened', 'episodes', 'tweak', 'color', 'palette', 'instances', 'bringing', 'out', 'Goku', 'dark', 'orange', 'dark', 'blue', 'Gi', 'bright', 'orange', 'slightly', 'light', 'blue', 'Gi', 'other', 'instances', 'when', 'bright', 'lime', 'green', 'grass', 'changed', 'pale', 'light', 'green', 'grass', 'release', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Level', '1.1', '1.2', 'release', 'FUNimation', 'balances', 'things', 'out', 'slightly', 'brightening', 'episodes', 'using', 'color', 'correction', 'when', 'needed', 'Overall', 'animation', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'new', 'life', '30', 'year', 'old', 'anime-Once', 'again', 'FUNimation', 'option', 'watch', 'episodes', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'musicb', 'US', 'English', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'musicc', 'US', 'English', 'dub', 'US', 'Nathan', 'Johnson/Bruce', 'Faulconer', 'musicNow', 'Cons', 'Unfortunately', 'episodes', 'are', 'cropped', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'terms', 'cropping', 'orange', 'brick', 'season', 'sets', 'release', 'virtually', 'difference', 'bits', 'visual', 'information', 'were', 'lost', 'before', 'are', 'lost', 'once', 'again', 'payoff', 'cropping', 'widescreen', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'it.The', 'overall', 'Overall', ""'re"", 'just', 'casual', 'fan', 'who', 'upgrade', 'collection', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'then', 'not', 'bad', 'buy.If', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Japanese', 'version', 'original', 'opening', 'title', 'cards', 'original', 'title', 'cards', 'end', 'credit', 'title', 'cards', 'original', 'next', 'episode', 'previews', 'then', 'set', ""n't"", 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Dragon', 'Box', 'sets.If', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'US/Toonami', 'version', 'Nathan', 'Johnson/Bruce', 'Faulconer', 'BGM', 'were', 'disappointed', 'orange', 'brick', 'season', 'DVD', 'cropped', 'original', 'native', 'full', 'screen', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'wide', 'screen', '16:9', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'then', 'once', 'again', 'set', ""n't"", 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Level', '1.1', 'Level', '1.2', 'Blu-ray', 'sets', 'sets', 'kept', 'episodes', '4:3', 'full', 'screen']",Dragon Ball Z: Season 1

This remaster, unlike 2007's ""Orange Brick"" sets, was actually... GOOD. Not perfect, mind you, but good. It was clean and wasn't screwed with. It even contained both the Japanese voice track, and the revised English voice track, with your option of two soundtracks; original Japanese or the American soundtrack. It was looking to be the definite Dragon Ball Z release that we've all been looking for. However, these dreams were crushed when FUNimation decided to cancel this production as it was becoming too costly.This was the last we'd heard from FUNimation about Dragon Ball Z being in Blu-ray until we saw a survey posted earlier this year, asking fans about the Blu-rays once again! However, an interesting question was in the survey; one that would divide the fanbase: What should the aspect ratio be? Original 4:3, or Cropped 16:9? For those who do not know, 4:3 is the original format Dragon Ball Z is displayed in, otherwise known as the ""box format"" or Fullscreen. 16:9 is known as Widescreen. What FUNimation will be doing is they will be cutting off the tops and bottoms of the original screen in order to make it fit the wider screen. You will be losing 20% of the original footage. Granted, this time around they will be using a more useful method of cropping to make sure that nothing important is cut out, but still, it will not be the full image. This decision oddly perplexes me. Why would you forcibly crop your footage, when most TVs nowadays have the option to crop the footage for you? That way, you're not disappointing your other half of the fanbase.Not only that, but this release will most likely not be as good as the Level sets, as that kind of remastering was too expensive.Very disappointed in FUNimation for making this decision.

1670910,A2X4YNTRY3XRTE,B00F9IB1M4,TL Movie Buff,"[7, 7]","This review is mainly on the Blu-ray itself. (which I own a copy of, AND actually had seen a few episodes)  All I can say about this show is that it may not be my favorite show, but I did grew up with this title when I was a kid (not this much) and it has its moments.  At times, the fillers that were not in the original Manga can make the show drag... a lot.  I recommend people to read the manga for the best experience, but the anime is still a good show to watch.In regards to the releases: Funimation never ceases on milking this title since the 90's, from VHS, DVD's to now Blu-ray.  Before discussing this set, I would like to discuss my earlier experiences with the earlier sets starting with the Season Set DVDs made years ago. (the next paragraph would start the analysis of this new release for those that only want to know about this.)- The ""Orange Brick"" DVDs were the first to have the entire series in 9 affordable box sets with controversial video framing and restoration, the worst being the widescreen cropping.  From my memory, it wasn't that great of cropping, and its details and colors were troubling.  It included 3 audio versions (the Original language and the newly-revised Funimation Dub [both in 5.1 mix with original Japanese music and 2.0 with American Broadcast music heard mainly on Toonami at the time]).  The Marathon Mode was a nice feature (no need to revisit the opening, the ending, and ""previously on"" segments all the time).- Then came the ""Dragon Boxes"" which corrected what should have been: A faithful (though still questionable, in regards to the colors) restoration from Toei Animation and Pony Canyon in 2003, the 2.0 American Soundtrack mix dropped for better video quality, leaving the original language and 5.1 mix, and presented in 7 well-made boxes nearly replicating the original imported Dragon Boxes.  Needless to say, the video quality was superior than the previous boxes.  It felt better seeing this than the previous sets.  It also had ""Next-Time previews"" that were never aired nor presented before on American DVDs. Unfortunately, these were not dubbed for these previews.  Like the imported box sets, these sets were definitely limited edition.  These can now be hard to get if one wants all 7 boxes.- In 2011, Funimation at one point decided to be generous to the fans, and provided Blu-ray sets called the ""Level Sets"".  These used newly-transfered restorations from Funi that retained the film grain, kept the original aspect ratio, got rid of most of the dirt and damage, and provided quite possibly the best version of DBZ out there.  I couldn't believe the quality that this set provided.  Only problem?  Funimation had to cancel the sets all together after releasing 2 sets due to what they state ""high costs of restorations"".  Will Funi go back to do this and continue from there? ... oh, if only.2 years after the release/cancellation of the Level Sets, Funimation is releasing the show again on Blu-ray, this time in affordable packaging featuring the same amount of episodes from the orange Boxes, now referred to as the Blue Boxes (Seems that Funi would be able to provide the entire series this time around with pre-orders of future sets made.)  What will people now get with this, and future, set(s)?1) Another cropped widescreen release. ... but not as bad as it seems.  As stated in the press releases, Frame-by-frame pan-and-scanning was used to not crop out the important information.  It's now better than the orange sets, and at times, you wouldn't mind seeing this in widescreen rather than the 1.33:1 ratio.  And I almost thought that Funi would use the troublesome HD source used for the Orange Sets.  It's that tolerable. ... except for the End Credits.  Severely cropped further.  No joke, it's actually that bad.  The opening is cropped nice but not the ending? ... why bother?2) HEAVY (distracting) DNR.  This is mainly the one negative thing about this set.  At times, you might not notice the issue. Other times though, it's beyond intolerable.  I've seen better handling on DNR through other titles.  Depending on the scene, it can get very distracting.  Why bother removing the grain entirely if it makes the picture quality worse? (same question to the Orange sets, but this is a Blu-ray release!  Meaning more flaws detected!  The Orange DVD sets had DNR also, but somehow, it looks more washed-up.  Guess they shouldn't have give artificial sharpening on this.) I now question Funimation's quality control in regards to the balance of grain.  Again, it's not always the case throughout the episodes, but depending on the screen size and technology on your HDTV, it can look bad at times.3) Color and Detail.  The colors can look nice (not the colors of the Dragon Boxes, but at least it mostly looks natural), and detail is a step-up from the Orange sets (despite the harsh DNR applied).  Most of the dirt and dust has been removed, another sign that it's not the same HD master that was used in the Orange Boxes.  Not that much to say in this area.4) Like the level sets, this contains the 3 audio tracks from the DVDs in Lossless Dolby TrueHD. (even the original language which is mainly in mono!)  The Audio quality is, as expected, the best I've ever heard.  The original language is sadly (and strangely) muffled, but I guess not much could be done on the original language version.  Not a lot of complaining here.  Subtitles included for translation of original language.  The differences between the original translated subtitles and the Funimation dubs can be staggering.5) Marathon Mode is back (like in the Level Sets).  Nice.In the end, it's not the release we wanted (in fact, it's the complete opposite of the Level Set/Dragon Boxes), but it's good enough for those that aren't that picky on the video quality.  I'm not a hard-core fan of this, as some are in the fandom, so I wouldn't complain much for this release.  The pricing is very justifiable, so I guess, for what it is, it's a decent release.  A huge upgrade to the Orange Boxes thankfully, but a step-back from previous (and better) releases.  Here's hoping that Funi can at least improve the quality for these future sets.If it sells well, fans might get a more faithful release like how the Dragon Boxes went though thanks to the sales of the orange boxes... along with Dragon Ball and GT Blu-ray sets.",4,DBZ Season 1 Blu-ray- A decent release with mixed results (honest review),1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,6373,"['review', 'mainly',
