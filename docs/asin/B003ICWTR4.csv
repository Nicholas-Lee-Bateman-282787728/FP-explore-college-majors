I'm so glad this Blu-Ray is available because, as far as trying to approximate being at a concert by watching one on TV, this is just about perfect. Great setlist, terrific performances, beautifully shot and edited, first-rate sound quality. Also, there's the matter of Springsteen's mood. Although he always take the stage to honor his fans and give them a good time, I've seen him, on occasion, be in SUCH a good mood that it take a bit of edge off the show. In this concert, he's a bit on the serious side and many of his songs are best with just a bit of angry edge. That just makes it really, really great. Last thing: There's no end to superlatives about the band. To the last person, whether officially E-Street Band or one of the supporting musicians, these people are tremendous. (By the way, in a fully just world, Soozie Tyrell, would be granted &#34;full membership.&#34;) But, that all said, holy cow: Max Weinberg. This guy is a beast.

1346210,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B003ICWTR4,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[27, 38]","Almost anyone who's seen Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band between 2007 and 2009 would agree that it was their strongest period on the road since the River Tour. Defying the restrictions of time and age, and even after the death of a key band member (Danny Federici in April of 2008), Bruce and the E Street Band electrified the stage each and every time they went out there, putting on some of their most legendary shows in years, culminating in the fall of 2009, when Bruce and the band performed their first six albums (""Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."" up to ""Born in the U.S.A."") in their entirety. With so many wonderful performances to choose from, one would think a truly special dvd release could be made to commemorate such a landmark period in the band's history?Unfortunately, it was not be. Like previous Bruce live releases, Bruce and co. have once again taken the easy way out, going for a show that had already been properly shot, mixed, edited and aired on television prior to its release, rather than take a little extra time to sit down and sift through the endless hours of pro-shot footage out there to create something fans would truly appreciate.""London Calling"" Live in Hyde Park"" was a show Bruce had done as part of a festival rather than an official Bruce show. Granted, the majority of the audiences were there for him, but you can certainly feel a difference in this show then ""Live in New York City"" or ""Live in Barcelona"" or even ""Live in Dublin."" The show has an incredibly bland, standard set list, as opposed to the many long lost gems Bruce had revived over the course of two years.Performance wise, Bruce and the band are at only 80 % total. Having done Glastonbury less than 24 hours earlier, Bruce's voice is tired and hoarse, with no force or power, robbing him of the expressive emotional coloring he's able to give his material when he's at his best. Even at 59, Bruce is still usually able to muster up the same energy he had at 29 or 35, but here he gets powered out quite often. The show's horrid stage setup, including a troublesome staircase that saps a lot of the connection Bruce is able to make so easily with his audience.The band's playing is strong, aside from Clarence Clemons, whose health woes have sapped a great deal of his playing skills. Steven Van Zandt in particular is the most lively he's appeared on stage in years. But even the band, great though they still may be, aren't quite up to their game here. The opening ""London Calling"" cover is a mess thanks to Steve's slurring of the lyrics, and ""Racing in the Street,"" ""The Rising,"" and ""Jungleland"" lack the power of previous versions. ""Jungleland"" is particularly disappointing here, with Bruce's voice in tatters and the tempo brought down to a snail's pace (Clarence nails the solo, though). ""Lonesome Day"" also suffers from similar faults.There are some highlight to be sure - ""Badlands"" and ""Born to Run"" never seem to get old, ""Out in the Street"" and ""Rosalita"" are a blast, ""Glory Days"" is given its definitive rendition, and ""No Surrender"" with Brian Fallon is sublime. The three song stretch of ""Seeds,"" ""Johnny 99,"" and ""Youngstown"" is also excellent, and represent the band at their most intense.But these highlights don't seem to outweigh the many tired, overplayed fluff that is ""Bobby Jean,"" ""Waiting on a Sunny Day,"" and ""The Promised Land."" And ""Outlaw Pete"" and ""Working on a Dream"" just don't hold up to the new stuff.As I said, there were so many other options they could've gone for - Danny's last shows in Boston and Indiana. The magnificent trio of shows at Giant Stadium in 2008. The St. Louis '08 show that many fans ranked up there with Roxy '78 and the Vietnam Veterans show in 1981. And, of course, the album shows - intense, once in a lifetime performances that brought some of Bruce's most underrated gems to life. All of these are now gathering dust.The sound and picture quality are the best of any Bruce release to date, which stings all the more since such aethestic goodies ae wasted on an inferior product.",3,An Incredibly Disappointing Of Two Great Years On The Road.,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,4062,"['Almost', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'E', 'Street', 'Band', '2007', '2009', 'would', 'agree', 'was', 'strongest', 'period', 'road', 'River', 'Tour', 'Defying', 'restrictions', 'time', 'age', 'even', 'death', 'key', 'band', 'member', 'Danny', 'Federici', 'April', '2008', 'Bruce', 'E', 'Street', 'Band', 'electrified', 'stage', 'time', 'went', 'there', 'putting', 'most', 'legendary', 'shows', 'years', 'culminating', 'fall', '2009', 'when', 'Bruce', 'band', 'performed', 'first', 'six', 'albums', 'Greetings', 'Asbury', 'Park', 'N.J.', 'Born', 'U.S.A.', 'entirety', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'choose', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'truly', 'special', 'dvd', 'release', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'commemorate', 'landmark', 'period', 'band', 'history', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'previous', 'Bruce', 'live', 'releases', 'Bruce', 'co.', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'taken', 'easy', 'way', 'going', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'properly', 'shot', 'mixed', 'edited', 'aired', 'television', 'prior', 'release', 'rather', 'take', 'little', 'extra', 'time', 'sit', 'down', 'sift', 'endless', 'hours', 'pro-shot', 'footage', 'there', 'create', 'something', 'fans', 'would', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'London', 'Calling', 'Live', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'was', 'show', 'Bruce', 'had', 'done', 'part', 'festival', 'rather', 'official', 'Bruce', 'show', 'Granted', 'majority', 'audiences', 'were', 'there', 'can', 'certainly', 'feel', 'difference', 'show', 'then', 'Live', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Live', 'Barcelona', 'even', 'Live', 'Dublin', 'show', 'incredibly', 'bland', 'standard', 'set', 'list', 'opposed', 'many', 'long', 'lost', 'gems', 'Bruce', 'had', 'revived', 'course', 'two', 'years.Performance', 'wise', 'Bruce', 'band', 'are', 'only', '80', '%', 'total', 'Having', 'done', 'Glastonbury', 'less', '24', 'hours', 'earlier', 'Bruce', 'voice', 'tired', 'hoarse', 'force', 'power', 'robbing', 'expressive', 'emotional', 'coloring', 'able', 'give', 'material', 'when', 'best', 'Even', '59', 'Bruce', 'still', 'usually', 'able', 'muster', 'up', 'same', 'energy', 'had', '29', '35', 'here', 'powered', 'out', 'quite', 'often', 'show', 'horrid', 'stage', 'setup', 'including', 'troublesome', 'staircase', 'lot', 'connection', 'Bruce', 'able', 'make', 'so', 'easily', 'audience.The', 'band', 'playing', 'strong', 'aside', 'Clarence', 'Clemons', 'health', 'woes', 'have', 'sapped', 'great', 'deal', 'playing', 'skills', 'Steven', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'particular', 'most', 'lively', 'appeared', 'stage', 'years', 'even', 'band', 'great', 'still', 'may', 'be', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'game', 'here', 'opening', 'London', 'Calling', 'cover', 'mess', 'thanks', 'Steve', 'slurring', 'lyrics', 'Racing', 'Street', 'Rising', 'Jungleland', 'lack', 'power', 'previous', 'versions', 'Jungleland', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'here', 'Bruce', 'voice', 'tatters', 'tempo', 'brought', 'down', 'snail', 'pace', 'Clarence', 'solo', 'though', 'Lonesome', 'Day', 'also', 'similar', 'are', 'highlight', 'be', 'sure', 'Badlands', 'Born', 'Run', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'old', 'Street', 'Rosalita', 'are', 'blast', 'Glory', 'Days', 'given', 'definitive', 'rendition', 'Surrender', 'Brian', 'Fallon', 'sublime', 'three', 'song', 'stretch', 'Seeds', 'Johnny', '99', 'Youngstown', 'also', 'excellent', 'represent', 'band', 'most', 'intense.But', 'highlights', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'outweigh', 'many', 'tired', 'overplayed', 'fluff', 'Bobby', 'Jean', 'Waiting', 'Sunny', 'Day', 'Promised', 'Land', 'Outlaw', 'Pete', 'Working', 'Dream', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'new', 'stuff.As', 'said', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'options', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Danny', 'last', 'shows', 'Boston', 'Indiana', 'magnificent', 'trio', 'shows', 'Giant', 'Stadium', '2008', 'St.', 'Louis', 'show', 'many', 'fans', 'ranked', 'up', 'there', 'Roxy', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'show', '1981', 'course', 'album', 'intense', 'once', 'lifetime', 'brought', 'Bruce', 'most', 'underrated', 'gems', 'life', 'are', 'now', 'gathering', 'dust.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'best', 'Bruce', 'release', 'date', 'more', 'such', 'aethestic', 'goodies', 'ae', 'wasted', 'inferior', 'product']",Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: London Calling - Live in Hyde Park

1346212,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B003ICWTR4,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[6, 13]","I caught Bruce Springsteen just as he was building a national audience. He had recently been on the cover of Time magazine concurrent with the release of ""Born To Run."" He was named as one of 3 male artists that were destined to change the face of music. The second was Jackson Browne and one could make an arguement that these two men have had a tremendous impact on music for over 3 decades. Third on the list was a young man named Nils Lofgren. I was a huge fan of Nils and to this day recommend his ""Cry Tough"" album whenever I get the chance. Some years later, a struggling Lofgren joined the E Street Band. The night I saw the Boss he was drunk. Very drunk. So drunk that during the solo for ""She's The One"" he leaned forward too far and pitched himself off the stage and fell six feet to the floor below. I was very unimpressed.Through the years I've still enjoyed many of his studio releases and heard nothing but rave reviews for his live show. I watched him perform at the Hall Of Fame concerts too, most notably playing ""London Calling"" when the Clash were inducted. I was impressed enough that I jumped at the chance to buy this concert when it was released.Midway through the first song I realized that Bruce's voice is absolutely shot. I'm not talking ""seasoned"" the way Tony Bennett's voice has become either. I mean shot. No range, no texture and the capacity for little more than screaming into the mike with enough gravel in his throat to pave the length of E Street.Midway through the first disk I almost gave up. The band is as tight as ever. What Max has lost in ability at the drums he's more than made up for in efficiency. Being an older drummer myself I can't help but admire how well he still drives the entire band. God bless Clarence Clemmons. If you've kept up with the music media you are already well aware of the painful battles ""The Big Man"" has fought with his damaged hips, spine, and knees. If you focus on him during the show you can quickly see that the man can barely move. Yet he plays with such signature style and tenderness that his axe is immediately recognizable. His style has a signature sound all its own, much like Clapton's guitar work. His bravery and skills should not be missed. Little Steven is a well-known musicologist but his voice, never as good as his best friend Bruce, has lost what little luster it once had.Then came Lofgren's moment to shine. He plays an absolutely magnificent guitar solo that takes the audience's breath away. It's long and shows all the reasons why he was once held in such high regard. Although the camera focuses on his effort, you can frequently see Bruce and Little Steven watching him across the stage. The look on Steven's face can only be described as ugly jealousy. The Boss simply looks bored. Although Springsteen calls for applause for virtually every other band member several times during the show, when an exhausted Lofgren finishes the solo, Bruce simply starts the next song without acknowledging Nils at all. I've played enough gigs in my time to be able to recognize when a band member isn't welcome. Nils apparently will be the E Street Outsider. He's treated like a black sheep throughout the concert and during the finale he follows the Boss out to the crowd and stands beside him. It takes Little Steven less than 5 seconds to race after him and crowd him away from Springsteen and the camera. These may be middle-aged adults, but they act like spoiled children for much of the show.I was so unimpressed by the first disk I almost didn't put part 2 into my machine. I'm SO glad I did. The second half of the show is light years ahead of the first and is packed with highlight moments. The band sings a heartfelt and gorgeous version of ""Hard Times Come Again No More"" and then jumps into a version of ""Rosalita"" that is so packed with fun and energy that it should be illegal. It was also a special joy to see ""Jungleland"" performed with all the love and emotional passion that the song deserves.Buy this concert. It's more than worth the price for just the second disk. Had this been the only disk in the set and included versions of ""Backstreets"" and ""Thunder Road"" it would have been worth twice the price. Unfortunately, it's a two disk set and the only use I've found for disk one is as a drink coaster. Your mileage may vary and you should watch the first half of the show at least once (you did pay for it after all) but the closing hour of the concert is so superior to the opening don't be surprised if that's the only spin you ever give disk one.",3,Give the Boss a watch and a pension,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,4562,"['caught', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'just', 'was', 'building', 'national', 'audience', 'had', 'recently', 'been', 'cover', 'Time', 'magazine', 'concurrent', 'release', 'Born', 'Run', 'was', 'named', 'one', '3', 'male', 'artists', 'were', 'destined', 'change', 'face', 'music', 'second', 'was', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'arguement', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'had', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'music', '3', 'decades', 'Third', 'list', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Nils', 'Lofgren', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Nils', 'day', 'recommend', 'Cry', 'Tough', 'album', 'whenever', 'get', 'chance', 'years', 'later', 'struggling', 'Lofgren', 'joined', 'E', 'Street', 'Band', 'night', 'saw', 'Boss', 'was', 'drunk', 'Very', 'drunk', 'drunk', 'solo', 'One', 'leaned', 'forward', 'too', 'far', 'pitched', 'stage', 'fell', 'six', 'feet', 'floor', 'was', 'very', 'years', ""'ve"", 'still', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'studio', 'releases', 'heard', 'nothing', 'rave', 'reviews', 'live', 'show', 'watched', 'perform', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'concerts', 'too', 'most', 'notably', 'playing', 'London', 'Calling', 'when', 'Clash', 'were', 'inducted', 'was', 'impressed', 'enough', 'jumped', 'chance', 'buy', 'concert', 'when', 'was', 'released.Midway', 'first', 'song', 'realized', 'Bruce', 'voice', 'absolutely', 'shot', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'seasoned', 'way', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'voice', 'become', 'either', 'mean', 'shot', 'range', 'texture', 'capacity', 'little', 'more', 'screaming', 'mike', 'enough', 'gravel', 'throat', 'pave', 'length', 'E', 'Street.Midway', 'first', 'disk', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'band', 'as', 'tight', 'ever', 'What', 'Max', 'lost', 'ability', 'drums', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'efficiency', 'Being', 'older', 'drummer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'how', 'well', 'still', 'entire', 'band', 'God', 'bless', 'Clarence', 'Clemmons', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'up', 'music', 'media', 'are', 'already', 'well', 'aware', 'painful', 'battles', 'Big', 'Man', 'fought', 'damaged', 'hips', 'spine', 'knees', 'focus', 'show', 'can', 'quickly', 'see', 'man', 'can', 'barely', 'move', 'such', 'signature', 'style', 'tenderness', 'axe', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'style', 'signature', 'sound', 'own', 'much', 'Clapton', 'guitar', 'work', 'bravery', 'skills', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Little', 'Steven', 'well-known', 'musicologist', 'voice', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'friend', 'Bruce', 'lost', 'what', 'little', 'luster', 'once', 'had.Then', 'came', 'Lofgren', 'moment', 'shine', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'guitar', 'solo', 'audience', 'breath', 'away', 'long', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'once', 'held', 'such', 'high', 'regard', 'camera', 'effort', 'can', 'frequently', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Little', 'Steven', 'watching', 'stage', 'look', 'Steven', 'face', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'ugly', 'jealousy', 'Boss', 'simply', 'bored', 'Springsteen', 'applause', 'virtually', 'other', 'band', 'member', 'several', 'times', 'show', 'when', 'exhausted', 'Lofgren', 'solo', 'Bruce', 'simply', 'next', 'song', 'acknowledging', 'Nils', ""'ve"", 'played', 'enough', 'gigs', 'time', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'when', 'band', 'member', ""n't"", 'welcome', 'Nils', 'apparently', 'will', 'be', 'E', 'Street', 'Outsider', 'treated', 'black', 'sheep', 'concert', 'finale', 'Boss', 'crowd', 'stands', 'beside', 'Little', 'Steven', 'less', '5', 'seconds', 'race', 'crowd', 'away', 'Springsteen', 'camera', 'may', 'be', 'middle-aged', 'adults', 'act', 'spoiled', 'children', 'much', 'show.I', 'was', 'so', 'unimpressed', 'first', 'disk', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'part', '2', 'machine', ""'m"", 'SO', 'glad', 'did', 'second', 'half', 'show', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'first', 'packed', 'highlight', 'moments', 'band', 'heartfelt', 'gorgeous', 'version', 'Hard', 'Times', 'Come', 'Again', 'No', 'More', 'then', 'version', 'Rosalita', 'so', 'packed', 'fun', 'energy', 'should', 'be', 'illegal', 'was', 'also', 'special', 'joy', 'see', 'Jungleland', 'performed', 'love', 'emotional', 'passion', 'song', 'deserves.Buy', 'concert', 'more', 'price', 'just', 'second', 'disk', 'Had', 'been', 'only', 'disk', 'set', 'included', 'versions', 'Backstreets', 'Thunder', 'Road', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'twice', 'price', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'disk', 'set', 'only', 'use', ""'ve"", 'found', 'disk', 'one', 'drink', 'coaster', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'should', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'least', 'once', 'did', 'pay', 'closing', 'hour', 'concert', 'so', 'superior', 'opening', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'only', 'spin', 'ever', 'give', 'disk', 'one']",Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: London Calling - Live in Hyde Park

That's the one word that comes to mind when thinking aboutd this DVD.The performance is great, almost of it in broad daylight. As always, Springsteen and the E-Stree Band are giving their best.Sound is great, and gool-old Bob Clearmountain is the mixing engineer. Also, I must thanks director Chris Wilson (or his editeur) for the great editing, that thanfully does not follow the actual trend of blinding-fast cuts where you can not even see what's happening! Other than Bruce, the the one who clearly gets more screen time is drummer Max Weinberg. The relacement of deceased Danny Federici of course handles the job well, but has very few screen time. Garry TAllent as always is almosta invisible and like a statue, but giving his best and absurdly precise.Pat Scialfa is absent, but that's due to taking care of the children at home. Sosie Tyrrell is strong, as also are Van Zandt (apparently the most affected by age) and Lofgren.The set list is a gem. Bruce's catalogue is so vast and high-quality, that he can choose effortlessly to change it from tour to tour or even from show to show. Tha inclusion of ""No Surrender"" and ""Bobby Jean"" were a plus for me.Image quality is top. Sound is also top.

The 163 min recording encompasses songs from his massive  repertoire including favourites ""No Surrender"" & ""Hard Times (Come Again No More)"" among others (the usual suspects). Rarities in this 2 DVD set include ""Trapped"" (Jimmy Cliff),"" Good Lovin'"" (The Young Rascals) & ""London Calling"" (The Clash). As usual with ""The Boss"" Bruce Springsteen & E-Street Band,the performance is impressive (but not spectacular, as compared to shows like 'Live in Barcelona', released in 2003) but visuals are rather breathtaking (as recorded in HD). The set has however only two tracks from ""Working On A Dream"" : ""Outlaw Pete"" & ""Working On A Dream"". One would have expected more tracks from the new album as promo!

The voices come across very well, though.
