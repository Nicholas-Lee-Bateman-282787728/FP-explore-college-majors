While at Whitman he is befriended by 41 year old Leo (Brendan Fraser) and develops a love interest in a townie high school girl (Julia Garner). Eli has joined the college Mastermind club and competes in intercollegiate intellectual contests, with designs on getting revenge on Harvard.The film is designed for teens including formulaic cliche writing. There is the college bully and the older girl who wants his baby. At 50 minutes into the film it awkwardly introduces Leo's daughter.
