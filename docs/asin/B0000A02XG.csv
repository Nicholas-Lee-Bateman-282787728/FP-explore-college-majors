But anyways the introduction to this movie is indication alone of its awesomeness. When you see the scarecrows hand moving across the floor in fast-motion you know you're in for a treat. And when you see the AMAZING effects done on the scene where the farmer gets thrown into a pitchfork (with his legs invisible for some great reason) you have already gotten what you paid for). Ok being serious now, it's f'ing sad to see Tony Todd in this film, he's an incredible actor and Hollywood needs to put better use of his talent instead of letting it go to waste. This film is like a prolonged episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark, but even that had better effects. Nothing anyone can possibly say bad about this movie can be greater than the effect the movie itself has on the viewer.

Only Hatred of a Minute this movie from being perhaps the worst horror movie in the universe---although House of the Dud would give this movie a fine brawl. First of all, to make sure that I'm getting things straight, apparently, in the Scarecrow ""Mythos"", if you die within eight feet of a scarecrow---ostensibly any scarecrow---your soul will jump into the scarecrow's body. So, if you're feeling a little thin in the skin, hotfoot it to your local cornfield ASAP. Then, all you have to do is wait for some chick to kill you with fire or a garden thresher, and your soul will jump into HER body. See how it works?What in the blue hell happened to the Candyman? Dear God. He was on the X-Files once, he was the Candyman, he was the Grim Reaper in those Final Destination movies. How did he end up here? Somebody out there call this poor guy and give him another decent role in a functioning movie. But of course, not even the Candyman, the Grim Reaper, Chuckie, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Dracula, ""the Humungus"", the Tooth Fairy, Captain Kirk, Shooter McGavin or the Main Man Jason Voorhees could save this stinkbomb.At the beginning of the movie, the Candyman has the Scarecrow trapped, lashed to a post, but was this supposed to be the Scarecrow from the first movie? Because THAT Scarecrow ended up soul-jumping into that chick with the gigantic...uh...smile. Not to mention that fact that this new Scarecrow was supposed to have killed the Candyman's father several decades earlier. You can't even keep up with this crap, although, it might be easier if you gave a flying corncob. Anyway, the main guy of the movie gets croaked, jumps into the Scarecrow, and turns all evil for whatever reason. Also, throughout all of this, there's this screwball mass acceptance of the whole Scarecrow thing as some sort of lore to which everyone is automatically privy. There's alot of this: ""Hey, do you believe all those stories about the Scarecrow?"" What stories, what rumors, what legends? No one cares. You can't just make a horror icon like Voorhees or Freddy. It has to happen naturally, and it also requires more than six people lined up (at their local video store) to watch the movie.Oh yeah, something else, there is NO Scarecrow ""Slayer"" in this movie. I wish there were. Some huge pissed-off crow with a claymore or a harpoon gun. That might have been better. Of course, a stunt like that might have required something just a notch higher than the movie's omnipresent ""computer technology"", which is used instead of any kind of physically-manufactured gore. This movie just sucks on so many different levels. I don't think there's really any kind of plot. The actors couldn't have been worse even if they had bred them on some farm for crappy actors. All of the characters suck, they need to die, die, die. The Scarecrow definitely sucks. But, the movie did have adequate closing credits.",1,I feel really sorry for the Candyman.,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3033,"['Well', 'seeing', 'first', 'Scarecrow', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'worse', 'Scarecrow', 'was', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'baby', 'Only', 'Hatred', 'Minute', 'movie', 'being', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', 'universe', '-although', 'House', 'Dud', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'fine', 'brawl', 'First', 'all', 'make', 'sure', ""'m"", 'getting', 'things', 'straight', 'apparently', 'Scarecrow', 'Mythos', 'die', 'eight', 'feet', 'scarecrow', '-ostensibly', 'scarecrow', '-your', 'soul', 'will', 'jump', 'scarecrow', 'body', 'So', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'little', 'thin', 'skin', 'hotfoot', 'local', 'cornfield', 'ASAP', 'Then', 'have', 'do', 'wait', 'chick', 'kill', 'fire', 'garden', 'thresher', 'soul', 'will', 'jump', 'HER', 'body', 'See', 'how', 'What', 'blue', 'hell', 'happened', 'Candyman', 'Dear', 'God', 'was', 'X-Files', 'once', 'was', 'Candyman', 'was', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'How', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'here', 'Somebody', 'there', 'call', 'poor', 'guy', 'give', 'decent', 'role', 'functioning', 'movie', 'course', 'not', 'even', 'Candyman', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Chuckie', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'Dracula', 'Humungus', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Shooter', 'McGavin', 'Main', 'Man', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'could', 'save', 'stinkbomb.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Candyman', 'Scarecrow', 'trapped', 'lashed', 'post', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Scarecrow', 'first', 'movie', 'Scarecrow', 'ended', 'up', 'soul-jumping', 'chick', 'gigantic', 'uh', 'smile', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'new', 'Scarecrow', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'killed', 'Candyman', 'father', 'several', 'decades', 'earlier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', 'up', 'crap', 'might', 'be', 'easier', 'gave', 'flying', 'corncob', 'Anyway', 'main', 'guy', 'movie', 'croaked', 'Scarecrow', 'evil', 'reason', 'Also', 'screwball', 'mass', 'acceptance', 'whole', 'Scarecrow', 'thing', 'sort', 'lore', 'everyone', 'automatically', 'privy', 'alot', 'Hey', 'do', 'believe', 'stories', 'Scarecrow', 'What', 'what', 'rumors', 'what', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'horror', 'icon', 'Voorhees', 'Freddy', 'happen', 'naturally', 'also', 'more', 'six', 'people', 'lined', 'up', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'watch', 'movie.Oh', 'yeah', 'something', 'else', 'NO', 'Scarecrow', 'Slayer', 'movie', 'wish', 'were', 'huge', 'pissed-off', 'crow', 'claymore', 'harpoon', 'gun', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'course', 'stunt', 'might', 'have', 'required', 'something', 'just', 'notch', 'higher', 'movie', 'omnipresent', 'computer', 'technology', 'used', 'instead', 'kind', 'physically-manufactured', 'gore', 'movie', 'just', 'sucks', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'kind', 'plot', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'even', 'had', 'bred', 'farm', 'crappy', 'actors', 'characters', 'suck', 'need', 'die', 'die', 'die', 'Scarecrow', 'definitely', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'adequate', 'closing', 'credits']",Scarecrow Slayer

The dumb blonde girl had some really stupid lines but delivered them so sincerely, I howled.

Oh, my..and when the doctor at the seriously understaffed hospital offers cookies I about lost mine.  And just who is the chick the cop is in bed with?  And is his partner, Rachel, his wife?  And what happens to her?  The effects are ridiculous; the stuntman scarecrow's acrobatics are hilarious.  There is no acting at all, and poor Tony Todd's presence does nothing to legitimize this awful (but awfully funny) travesty.

760620,A3RL4OTEXWRHEJ,B0000A02XG,Russell Sharp,"[2, 4]","I'm not sure if this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it comes close.However, it is difficult to make such a claim, because this movie really doesn't compare to many other bad movies I have seen. Some just look like the sloppy work of Hollywood professionals. Others are bad because the filmmakers attempt to make something entertaining and fail. But this movie is different. This movie does have Tony Todd in it, but beyond having one (and only one) actor who has been in movies people have actually heard of, there is absolutely nothing professional about ""Scarecrow Slayer."" There is no evidence that the filmmakers actually tried to produce anything remotely resembling entertainment. There is also no evidence that they could do anything like that if they wished. This looks like a home movie.Let me examine some of the flaws in detail.First, the story is absurd and stupid. Caleb Kilgore (Tony Todd) has been obsessed all his life  with the scarecrow in question (it killed his father). One night some college kids are near Kilgore's house (barn?) preparing for some fraternity prank and one them, Dave, gets killed when the scarecrow falls on him and Kilgore, not knowing Dave to be beneath the scarecrow, shoots both of them. Somehow, Dave becomes the scarecrow and he begins slicing up people with his scythe (or throwing them to death or smashing their heads behind doors) in his apparent attempt to kidnap his girlfriend, Mary, and turn her into another scarecrow. (At least I think that's what happened. It wasn't entirely clear in the movie; I had to use the summary on the DVD box to know exactly what was supposed to be going on.) Second, the acting is bad. Most of the scenes were probably filmed in one take, so I will forgive the actors on their sloppy performances. (Of course, that is not to say that any of the actors have any talent.) Third, the camera work is horrible. Anytime you see lights in this movie, you also see glare. The picture is grainy, too. It was probably shot on an 8mm camcorder. Fourth, there is no sense of continuity or attention to detail. At one point, for example, a car is abandoned in a field, it later ends up parked next to a fence for no reason. It is also unclear how long time passes in the story. There is evidence both that the movie takes place over the course of one night and that it takes place over the course of a few days. What is the right answer? Who knows? (And who cares?)And the special effects? They get a new paragraph. The special effects were quite literally the worst I have ever seen in any movie. That may seem like quite a statement, but you must realize that it is relative. If this movie had been made in say, the 1930s, I would only call the special effects mediocre. But this movie was made in 2003, and there are several sequences that literally look as if the special effects were produced on the director's laptop (assuming this movie had room in its budget for a laptop PC). And I am not exaggerating. You could probably recreate some of those sequences by buying some home-video-editing software from the bargain bin at CompUSA or downloading software from the Internet.Finally, the supposedly remarkable climactic battle of scarecrow vs. scarecrow is mindbogglingly atrocious. Here's the background to this scene: Dave's best friend Karl is apparently in love with Dave because near the end of the movie, he wishes that Dave would kill him instead of Mary, making Karl into another scarecrow so that Dave and Karl could spend eternity together instead of Dave and Mary. (Isn't that sweet?) Anyway, Karl gets his wish (I would have warned you about the spoiler, but the summary on the box gives it away, as if you should give a hoot). But I guess Karl is not grateful for having been killed and turned into a scarecrow, because he tries to defeat Dave immediately afterwards. Now, within the context of this movie, it at least made a modicum of sense as to how Dave came to inhabit the body of a scarecrow. But where the second one came from is not clear at all. What is clear, however, is that this new one was assembled rather quickly because it was the worst costume I have ever seen -- consisting of brown pants, a brown shirt and some straw sticking out of the sleves and covering the feet.Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs unless you are heavily under the influence of controlled substances and you have nothing better to do with your time (like pounding your head against a brick wall for 93 minutes or eating an entire container of styrophoam cups instead).",1,Oh God!,1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,4565,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'close.However', 'difficult', 'make', 'such', 'claim', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'compare', 'many', 'other', 'bad', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'look', 'sloppy', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'professionals', 'Others', 'are', 'bad', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'make', 'something', 'entertaining', 'fail', 'movie', 'different', 'movie', 'have', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'having', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'movies', 'people', 'have', 'actually', 'heard', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'professional', 'Scarecrow', 'Slayer', 'evidence', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'tried', 'produce', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'entertainment', 'also', 'evidence', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'wished', 'home', 'movie.Let', 'examine', 'flaws', 'detail.First', 'story', 'absurd', 'stupid', 'Caleb', 'Kilgore', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'been', 'obsessed', 'life', 'scarecrow', 'question', 'killed', 'father', 'One', 'night', 'college', 'kids', 'are', 'Kilgore', 'house', 'barn', 'preparing', 'fraternity', 'prank', 'one', 'Dave', 'killed', 'when', 'scarecrow', 'Kilgore', 'not', 'knowing', 'Dave', 'be', 'scarecrow', 'shoots', 'Somehow', 'Dave', 'scarecrow', 'slicing', 'up', 'people', 'scythe', 'throwing', 'death', 'smashing', 'heads', 'doors', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'kidnap', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'turn', 'scarecrow', 'least', 'think', 'what', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'movie', 'had', 'use', 'summary', 'DVD', 'box', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'going', 'Second', 'acting', 'bad', 'Most', 'scenes', 'were', 'probably', 'filmed', 'one', 'take', 'will', 'forgive', 'actors', 'sloppy', 'performances', 'course', 'not', 'say', 'actors', 'have', 'talent', 'Third', 'camera', 'work', 'horrible', 'Anytime', 'see', 'lights', 'movie', 'also', 'see', 'glare', 'picture', 'grainy', 'too', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', '8mm', 'camcorder', 'Fourth', 'sense', 'continuity', 'attention', 'detail', 'one', 'point', 'example', 'car', 'abandoned', 'field', 'later', 'up', 'parked', 'next', 'fence', 'reason', 'also', 'unclear', 'how', 'long', 'time', 'passes', 'story', 'evidence', 'movie', 'place', 'course', 'one', 'night', 'place', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'What', 'right', 'answer', 'Who', 'who', 'cares', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'new', 'paragraph', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'quite', 'literally', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'quite', 'statement', 'must', 'realize', 'relative', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'say', '1930s', 'would', 'only', 'call', 'special', 'effects', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '2003', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'literally', 'look', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'produced', 'director', 'laptop', 'assuming', 'movie', 'had', 'room', 'budget', 'laptop', 'PC', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'could', 'probably', 'recreate', 'sequences', 'buying', 'home-video-editing', 'software', 'bargain', 'bin', 'CompUSA', 'downloading', 'software', 'Internet.Finally', 'supposedly', 'remarkable', 'climactic', 'battle', 'scarecrow', 'vs.', 'scarecrow', 'mindbogglingly', 'atrocious', 'Here', 'background', 'scene', 'Dave', 'best', 'friend', 'Karl', 'apparently', 'love', 'Dave', 'end', 'movie', 'Dave', 'would', 'kill', 'instead', 'Mary', 'making', 'Karl', 'scarecrow', 'so', 'Dave', 'Karl', 'could', 'spend', 'eternity', 'together', 'instead', 'Dave', 'Mary', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'Anyway', 'Karl', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'warned', 'spoiler', 'summary', 'box', 'away', 'should', 'give', 'hoot', 'guess', 'Karl', 'not', 'grateful', 'having', 'been', 'killed', 'turned', 'scarecrow', 'defeat', 'Dave', 'immediately', 'afterwards', 'Now', 'context', 'movie', 'least', 'made', 'modicum', 'sense', 'how', 'Dave', 'came', 'inhabit', 'body', 'scarecrow', 'where', 'second', 'one', 'came', 'not', 'clear', 'What', 'clear', 'however', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'assembled', 'rather', 'quickly', 'was', 'worst', 'costume', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'consisting', 'brown', 'pants', 'brown', 'shirt', 'straw', 'sticking', 'sleves', 'covering', 'feet.Avoid', 'piece', 'garbage', 'costs', 'are', 'heavily', 'influence', 'controlled', 'substances', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'time', 'pounding', 'head', 'brick', 'wall', '93', 'minutes', 'eating', 'entire', 'container', 'styrophoam', 'cups', 'instead']",Scarecrow Slayer

I'm a huge gore fan so maybe that is part of the reason I enjoyed this movie. I think Tony Todd ( Candyman ) gave a somewhat good performance as Farmer Caleb. In the beginning of the movie, we see Caleb as a young boy riding on a tractor with his father. Caleb then witnesses his father being killed by the scarecrow ( cool scene ). The film then takes us to some kids who decide to steal the scarecrow. When Caleb happens upon this, he shoots Dave who's soul goes into the scarecrow bringing the scarecrow back to life. The scarecrow has 2 things on his mind now, revenge and murder. However, still being part Dave now, the scarecrow is unable to kill his girlfriend Mary but kills everyone else who gets in his way. I really liked the hospital scene when the scarecrow murders Farmer Caleb ( cool, gory scene ). When Dave's ( now the scarecrow ) friend rushes to save Mary, whom the scarecrow has taken to the cornfield with the hopes of turning her into a scarecrow, he is killed and then resurrected as a scarecrow. From then on, we see a battle of the scarecrows. Mary must do whatever it takes to stop what she is witnessing. I find the acting was not bad and the killing scenes and gore were good in this film.
