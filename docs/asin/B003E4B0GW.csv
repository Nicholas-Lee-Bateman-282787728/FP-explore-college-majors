I rented this from Amazon and watched it all the way through. While some reviewers thought it too scary or sad, I found it touching and heart tugging. Kaitlyn Maher as Quinn was a wonderful choice by Disney; she was both precious and believable in the role of a newly-become orphan. There were glimpses of the ""Annie"" story in it but it had such a fresh take on the idea of love and how it overcomes everything that it really stood on its own merit. I agree that it might be too much for very sensitive younger children, especially if they have been sheltered from the greed and avarice in the world. I think that kids under the age of five might be more likely to be upset by certain events in the story, but the good always wins out. Unfortunately, we don't have a perfect world without sorrow...or fear. I think it's okay for most kids to know that, so that they are perhaps a little better prepared for reality when they are faced with it. The movie has (as other reviewers have commented) a couple of events that make the viewer a little sad or worried, but they are short events, and they turn out fine in the end. One other thought is that when some kids see this, they may even take a second look at their own life and see how great they have it compared to what others may be experiencing.Even though I'm not a little child anymore, this story nevertheless touched my heart deeply. The music was very good, most especially where little Kaitlyn sings about wondering who will take care of her. It brought tears to my eyes! The end of the story is typical Disney, where you have the ""...and they lived happily ever after."" I adored the end.

The movie is a prequel to the 2009 movie Santa Buddies, which I have never seen and it didn't feel like I was missing anything.  It reminds me of Annie meets Christmas.  The story is about Santa Claus visiting New York City but after an accident he gets amnesia.  Then there is a group of orphans who help out and a husband/wife couple who open a wonderful toy store.  There is so much to this movie and it flows so nicely.  I put this movie on and my boys slowly started paying more and more attention, they are hooked!  I was really amazed that they like this movie since it is not animated but they saw Santa and his cute best friend Paws and couldn't stop watching.The movie tells a tale of believing in Santa and the Christmas Spirit, helping others, and making friends.  It really is a magical movie that I know we will be watching for years to come, as well as probably throughout the year if my boys have anything to do with it!

1337736,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B003E4B0GW,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[1, 3]","It's been said that there are only seven basic storylines for westerns. The same might be said for Christmas movies and The Search for Santa Paws is no exception. This one leans a bit toward Miracle on 34th Street, but as Santa's magic bag of story ideas started to run low, it clearly was time to ""pay tribute"" to Mister Magorium's Wonder Emporium and about eight gallons of Annie.The interesting thing is that, of the many entries in the ""Buddies"" series, including last year's Santa Buddies, this film is less about the cute talking puppies and more about an amnesiac Santa, several adorable orphans and warm hearted yuppies.No kidding, the little orphan girls sing a song in their room just like ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile""  and the youngest orphan sings her version of ""Maybe."" Actually the whole film is largely a musical with on-camera singing with both the orphans in New York and the elves at the North Pole. The songs and the lavish musical score are nice, though, and I'm looking for a soundtrack CD (last year, you had to buy Santa Buddies at Target to get a soundtrack) but can't seem to find one this time around.There's even a Miss Hannigan type who burns toys, bans singing and ""takes home schooling very seriously."" Okay, why did that line have to be there? Especially when countless home schooling parents might be part of the buying public. I know she's actually lying and really making the girls work for her, but the line's still not necessary nor nice.What's most interesting for holiday movie buffs is that the special effects, particularly Santa's sleigh flying over New York, must be more rudimentary and certainly less cumbersome to create for this modestly budgeted direct-to-DVD movie than it was back when 1985's Santa Claus the Movie used quite a bit of its multi million dollar budget on doing pretty much the same thing without the benefit of today's technology.Disney Channel watchers will recognize a lot of actors from various shows, including Madison Pettis (who's grown up a bit since Cory in the House), John Ducey (the JONAS dad) and G. Hannelius (of Sonny with a Chance). Voicing the lead puppy is Mitchel Musso of Hannah Montana and Pair of Kings.It's pleasant going but isn't likely to replace Dickens. But then, it isn't intended to. It's kind of like one of those store bought holiday cookie making kits. The cookies are kinda tasty, very colorful, the kids enjoy them.

I had more trouble dealing with the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" explaining that there is no such thing as ghosts, or at least based on my experience no ghosts that will wake you up in the middle of the night and make deals with you as you float around the world.So, here is my review.  If you feel that your child is sensitive to the criticisms in the 1 ratings (which I wholeheartedly feel are valid) then perhaps you should wait until your child is a bit older. We loved the movie and the next day my daughter invited her friends over to watch it - they also enjoyed it cheering for Paws and yelling out advice to Quin.It could be a valuable learning experience if you use it as a springboard to discuss orphans, unfair treatment to people, and the spirit of giving as Christmas is around the corner. It would be a good movie to watch and then donate a gift (or two) to children not so fortunate, but I do understand and want to emphasize it may not be for all children.Discretion - but not a 1 star in my view - emphasizing awareness that there is a sad scary side (as per the reviews here: we saw the events more as an adventure within the movie).",5,Great Learning Potential Here: But Discretion,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,1486,"['think', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'dark', 'side', 'film', 'loved', '8', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'ok', 'sad', 'parts', 'studies', 'have', 'looked', 'historical', 'events', 'educational', 'perspectives', 'holocaust', 'Rwanda', 'crisis', 'bombing', 'Hiroshima', 'make', 'movies', 'dark', 'side', 'pale', 'comparison', 'had', 'more', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'classic', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'explaining', 'such', 'thing', 'ghosts', 'least', 'based', 'experience', 'ghosts', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'make', 'deals', 'float', 'world.So', 'here', 'review', 'feel', 'child', 'sensitive', 'criticisms', '1', 'ratings', 'wholeheartedly', 'feel', 'are', 'valid', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'wait', 'child', 'bit', 'older', 'loved', 'movie', 'next', 'day', 'daughter', 'invited', 'friends', 'watch', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'cheering', 'Paws', 'yelling', 'out', 'advice', 'Quin.It', 'could', 'be', 'valuable', 'learning', 'experience', 'use', 'springboard', 'discuss', 'orphans', 'unfair', 'treatment', 'people', 'spirit', 'giving', 'Christmas', 'corner', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'then', 'donate', 'gift', 'two', 'children', 'not', 'so', 'fortunate', 'do', 'understand', 'want', 'emphasize', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'children.Discretion', 'not', '1', 'star', 'view', 'emphasizing', 'awareness', 'sad', 'scary', 'side', 'reviews', 'here', 'saw', 'events', 'more', 'adventure', 'movie']",N/A
