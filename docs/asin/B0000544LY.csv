566826,ATOK2HUHCVNPY,B0000544LY,410,"[3, 3]","Perhaps you are a Gould devotee or perhaps one with little patience for his many oddities or the cult-ish devotion showered upon his legacy.  For either case this biopic tastefully illuminates some of his major obsessions and choices:  the decision to stop performing in public, his self-important opinions on the role of the artist in society, his delirious love of music and the sharing of it...This amalgam of short vignettes sidesteps the many trappings of cinematic film bios.  Gould is never sentimentalized and the filmmakers never try to embellish or over-interpret the fact that Gould's personae was, and remains, a difficult nut to crack.  The short films recreate significant moments in his life, interviews with associates, and more mundane events that nonetheless sparkle, such as one in which Gould prompts a housekeeper to listen and ultimately engage in this music.  By the end you feel you know something more about him, yet you hardly know him, a truth many film bios feel an urge to manufacture their subject's motivations.  Indeed, the lead actor is never shown playing the piano.  More importantly, you feel Gould's connection to the music, and its infectiousness will make new fans of many who see this.  And hearing him play the Goldberg Variations (1955) is one of life's great joys, right up there with seeing Yellowstone or Yosemite valley.",5,Eccentric Biopic For An Idiosyncratic Performer,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,1366,"['Perhaps', 'are', 'Gould', 'devotee', 'perhaps', 'one', 'little', 'patience', 'many', 'oddities', 'cult-ish', 'devotion', 'showered', 'legacy', 'case', 'biopic', 'tastefully', 'major', 'obsessions', 'choices', 'decision', 'stop', 'performing', 'public', 'self-important', 'opinions', 'role', 'artist', 'society', 'delirious', 'love', 'music', 'sharing', 'amalgam', 'short', 'vignettes', 'sidesteps', 'many', 'trappings', 'cinematic', 'film', 'bios', 'Gould', 'never', 'sentimentalized', 'filmmakers', 'never', 'try', 'embellish', 'over-interpret', 'fact', 'Gould', 'personae', 'was', 'difficult', 'nut', 'crack', 'short', 'films', 'recreate', 'significant', 'moments', 'life', 'interviews', 'associates', 'more', 'mundane', 'events', 'nonetheless', 'sparkle', 'such', 'one', 'Gould', 'housekeeper', 'listen', 'ultimately', 'engage', 'music', 'end', 'feel', 'know', 'something', 'more', 'yet', 'hardly', 'know', 'truth', 'many', 'film', 'bios', 'feel', 'urge', 'manufacture', 'subject', 'motivations', 'Indeed', 'lead', 'actor', 'never', 'shown', 'playing', 'piano', 'More', 'importantly', 'feel', 'Gould', 'connection', 'music', 'infectiousness', 'will', 'make', 'new', 'fans', 'many', 'who', 'see', 'hearing', 'play', 'Goldberg', 'Variations', '1955', 'one', 'life', 'great', 'joys', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'seeing', 'Yellowstone', 'Yosemite', 'valley']",32 Short Films About Glenn Gould

Brilliant, at times amazing, but always somehow distant.There is no getting around his brilliance (genius is not wrongly used) and the power of his musical personality.  But then there are also those interpretations that are just beyond eccentric.  However, I can't help listening to them and learning from his playing.  His playing is compelling even when I disagree completely - sometimes angrily.This wonderful movie uses vignettes to tell the story of Gould, well, impressionistically.  It is like a movie by Degas.  A simple narrative about him would be so much more misleading.I don't pretend to be a scholar on Gould or to even know much about his biography.  But this movie lets us hear his music as well as catch some of his life.  I particularly loved #6 Hamburg because it works on many levels and tells us many things about a view of Gould.The only thing I wish is to see something like this done with footage with the real Gould.  It wouldn't be as poetic, but somehow seeing the real Gould responding to music is better than even the best acting.Just terrific!

The movie, disjointed, fragmented and disorganized like the genius Gould, is a wonderful artistic statement of the man and his marvelous gifts to all of us.

566833,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B0000544LY,Kendra,"[12, 13]","To dismiss Glenn Gould as a neurotic or eccentric is quite missing the point. While he was these things, he was also much more. Gould was likely one of the finest interpreters of J.S. Bach on the piano in the last 50 years. His musical output is mammoth and his technical skill almost unsurpassed. Gould is a fascinating character. Having difficulty with personal relationships, Gould left his sizable fortune to his cats. Leaving this earth too early, Gould's legacy is still felt in the musical world and will be for many generations to come.This movie is a fascinating entre into Gould's world and into his mind. For anyone who enjoys Gould's music this movie is derigeur.While Gould is played by an actor in the movie, Gould certainly is playing the piano. Sergei Eisenstein the great film director once said, ""One should be able to see the music and hear the image."" This film about Gould lets that happen.Done in short mini-films, 32 Short Films combines to create an image of Gould much like a Bach two- or three-part invention disc does for Bach's masterpiece. Separately, each stands alone and has value and import but together a new, vivid and complete unit is formed.Gould is so brilliant and talented-- yet self-absorbed, that he practically lives inside his head. The movie shows him having difficulty, as many brilliant artists do, in interacting in a satisfying way (to themselves and for the other) with other people. But there were moments when all the walls fell away, and all the neuroses pushed aside so that a real, yet brief connection could be made with another. There is such a moment in this film and for me it was the highlight.In the most beautiful sequence of the movie, Gould is in a hotel in Europe, Germany if I recall correctly-- the land of Bach himself. He is preparing for an evening's concert and has just received by courier the brand new pressing of his newest Bach LP. It is a lovely day, Gould is silent and preparing. A maid enters his room, she doesn't appear to know that the man in the room is Glenn Gould, likely the greatest pianist alive on the planet at that time. He asks her if she would like to hear something. He places his brand new LP, Bach piano, on his record player and puts the needle down. The disc is spinning... stunning piano music is heard.The maid is shown almost in a dream a kind of reverie as she glances out the hotel room overlooking the German city, transported by Bach music played so superbly on the piano. Gould lets the woman enjoy the moments as he watches her reaction in silence. She glances from the window and the realization that it is Gould himself who is playing the piano on the recording arises in her eyes. It is a beautiful moment. The maid is humbled and completely appreciative of this gift that Gould has just given her. She says, ""Thank you."" I have never seen a ""thank you"" delivered by any actor on film seem so meaningful and important as that one. This is what Bach does to people who care to listen... Bach transports you.When played by a pianist such as Gould, it's only a matter of time before Bach grabs your imagination and soul and takes you on a grand journey. Gould seems almost a channeler more than a virtuouso pianist. One can almost see the master standing over Gould as he plays whispering to him. Perhaps this is why Gould is often heard on his recordings humming-- perhaps Bach is just too close.The world is a lesser place with Gould not existing in it, playing for us, bringing Bach alive through his awesome talents. But, for a few minutes, with this movie-- we have him back in all his glory and fascinating eccentricities.

566835,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000544LY,Robert Moore,"[19, 27]","Formalistically, this is an attempt at a fragmented, nonnarrative portrait of the life of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould who is as famous for his eccentricity and his refusal to perform live as for his brilliant if debated recordings of works such as Bach's Goldberg Variations.  The Amazon official editorial review wonders if we learn more in this fashion than we would have with a more straightforward biopic and concludes, ""Probably not.""  I would, however, argue that a straightforward narrative probably did not suit the subject as well as the one employed in this film.  There is brokenness in Gould's life that a normal narrative would have obscured.  I have know a couple of souls who were geniuses in a fashion similar to Gould, and what was most striking about them was how poorly they meshed with greater societal expectations.  I think the method for the film was perfect for the subject matter.This does not, however, mean that this is a perfect film.  Too many of the pieces are not especially moving, and I found my attention wandering in some segments while riveted in others.  For the most part, I found that I enjoyed any scene in which Colm Feore, who portrayed Gould, appeared.  His is always a fascinating presence, and he did a masterful job of projecting someone you feel might have been Gould, though he dispensed with some of Gould's more arresting eccentricities, such as lowering his piano stool to the point where he was nearly sitting on the floor.Unfortunately, in the end the film fails as a portrayal in any detectable sense of the life of Glenn Gould simply because it omits too much.  For instance, the film ignores or mutes many of Gould's less pleasant qualities, such as his notorious habit of simply not showing up for performances.  Or the enormous idiosyncrasy of a huge number of performances.  Because of the oddness of many of his interpretations, Gould would certainly not be ranked among the very finest pianists of his or any other generation.  Certainly he ranks far, far below not merely luminaries such as Rubenstein and Horowitz, but contemporaries such as Alfred Brendel or Byron Janis.  Was Gould a great pianist?  Possibly not.  Was he a fascinating one?  Without any question.  But I suspect in the end Gould fascinates more because of his personality and the eccentricity of his life than for his brilliance on record or in the concert hall.This leaves us, finally, with the question of whether 32 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD is a failed biopic or a successful fiction based on a famous real life musician.

566836,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B0000544LY,Shashank Tripathi,"[10, 13]","Several reviews of this DVD operate under the misconception that it is intended as a documentary or as a fictional re-enactment of some short films on Gould. It is neither.The &quot;movie&quot; (by which I mean the integrated thirty-two vignettes) is an exploration of Glenn Gould (Pearl Harbour, Colm Feore, Storm of the Century), the Canadian-born musician who is considered to be one of the world's greatest pianists, an eccentric genius whose performance of Bach's Goldberg Variations was recorded and included onboard the Voyager space probes.By no means a conventional biography, the film's episodes rarely attempt to pin down exact events or particular dates in his life. Exceptions include his interviews, radio broadcasts, and his final concert appearance. Rather, the film shows us phases and stages of his life, from his childhood to his career as a concert performer, his hobbies - the stock market, humour, travel, and experimental radio broadcasts - and his last days, when he complained to friends and relatives of his apprehension of death.The aesthetic of the film is self-consciously arty, deliberately bizarre, and exceedingly concerned with crisp, polished sound - exactly like Glenn Gould.It runs for 100 minutes or so, which means each vignette should have an average of 3 minutes. In reality some of them are 1 minute long, and other more key sequences (like one where Gould is at a truck stop) are of 5-6 minutes duration.Very worthy purchase if you are familiar with or interested in the quirky but brilliant musician.",4,"VIGNETTES, NOT &quot;SHORT-FILMS&quot;, AND FASCINATING!",1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,1543,"['Several', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'operate', 'misconception', 'intended', 'documentary', 'fictional', 're-enactment', 'short', 'films', 'Gould', 'neither.The', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'mean', 'integrated', 'thirty-two', 'vignettes', 'exploration', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'Storm', 'Century', 'Canadian-born', 'musician', 'who', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'pianists', 'eccentric', 'genius', 'performance', 'Bach', 'Goldberg', 'Variations', 'was', 'recorded', 'included', 'Voyager', 'space', 'probes.By', 'conventional', 'biography', 'film', 'episodes', 'rarely', 'attempt', 'pin', 'down', 'exact', 'events', 'particular', 'dates', 'life', 'Exceptions', 'include', 'interviews', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'final', 'concert', 'appearance', 'film', 'phases', 'stages', 'life', 'childhood', 'career', 'concert', 'performer', 'hobbies', 'stock', 'market', 'humour', 'travel', 'experimental', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'last', 'days', 'when', 'complained', 'friends', 'relatives', 'apprehension', 'death.The', 'aesthetic', 'film', 'self-consciously', 'arty', 'deliberately', 'bizarre', 'exceedingly', 'concerned', 'crisp', 'polished', 'sound', 'exactly', 'Glenn', 'Gould.It', '100', 'minutes', 'so', 'vignette', 'should', 'have', 'average', '3', 'minutes', 'reality', 'are', '1', 'minute', 'long', 'other', 'more', 'key', 'sequences', 'one', 'where', 'Gould', 'truck', 'stop', 'are', '5-6', 'minutes', 'duration.Very', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'are', 'familiar', 'interested', 'quirky', 'brilliant', 'musician']",32 Short Films About Glenn Gould

There are some wonderful musical interludes and visual interpretations, but Feore is the film.Now, does the film cover every aspect of Glenn Gould's life? No.  But what biographical film ever does?  I've read a couple biographies, and some entertaining facets of Gould's life were missed.  The characters he created and performed as weren't even mentioned but his wit and warmth as a human being were expounded upon by people who actually knew him--now that is valuable, seeing and hearing the people who were touched by that great pianist.",5,The film won awards because it should've.,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,604,"['Colm', 'Feore', 'excellent', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'interludes', 'visual', 'interpretations', 'Feore', 'film.Now', 'film', 'cover', 'aspect', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'life', 'No', 'what', 'biographical', 'film', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'read', 'couple', 'biographies', 'entertaining', 'facets', 'Gould', 'life', 'were', 'missed', 'characters', 'created', 'performed', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'wit', 'warmth', 'human', 'being', 'were', 'expounded', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'knew', 'now', 'valuable', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'touched', 'great', 'pianist']",32 Short Films About Glenn Gould
