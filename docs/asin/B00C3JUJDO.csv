1641700,A35XG6755DWOJV,B00C3JUJDO,"albionphoto ""albion""","[0, 2]",This is a new twist on the Queen's Blade series. The characters are different and the animation has moved on a bit. For the majority of the series this is obviously much more of a fan service fest than any attempt to develop the series. The plot does take a few interesting turns at the end with the return of one of the servants of the Witch of the swamp but not enough to rescue the series overall.,3,A new twist on the Queen's Blade,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,400,"['new', 'twist', 'Queen', 'Blade', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'different', 'animation', 'moved', 'bit', 'majority', 'series', 'obviously', 'much', 'more', 'fan', 'service', 'fest', 'attempt', 'develop', 'series', 'plot', 'take', 'few', 'interesting', 'turns', 'end', 'return', 'one', 'servants', 'Witch', 'swamp', 'not', 'enough', 'rescue', 'series', 'overall']",N/A

You also find out about Laina the wondering warrior. There is no shortage of action in the Rebellion and if your a big fan of ecchi than this is the one for you. I have heard a lot of people complain that it's not like Queen's Blade well it's not sapose to, it sapose to be the answer to the lingering question what happened? Look if every one was like the last then the series turns to mud, it has to go some where and tell you something.

1641702,A22OD81Z9HYFV1,B00C3JUJDO,Kris,"[2, 5]","Queen's Blade is a rather new and famous anime title when if comes to fan service. In fact, I would say that the Queen's Blade series is probably the best of the fan service genre, despite it being ridiculous. This new release is no exception. At first I thought that Rebellion would be a little more tame, but that is not the case here. There is one character (Luna Luna) in this new series that has such a ridiculous outfit that she makes Echidna's snake underwear from the first series almost look normal.This season of Queen Blade is about a rebellion who opposes the new tyrannical queen, who is actually Claudette, the main character's older sister from the first series. The new main character is a violet hair colored girl named Annelotte Kreutz. She is a knight who befriends many of the unusual characters in the show.In the first series, many of the characters looked like they were from a fantasy story and actually looked like women instead of cute anime characters with big eyes. Not all the characters followed this, but I feel enough of them did follow this trend. This series seemed to use more anime looking character designs for the cast. There are a lot more young girl characters this time, and it feels kind of weird seeing them in a show which has tentacles, an octopus, fragile armor, and suggestive religious poses. One of the characters (Mirim) looks way too young to be in this show; she looks like Mint from the series, Galaxy Angel, and she obtains something called the ""Hyper Vibration Armor."" It just seems wrong that she gets this armor opposed to anyone else. The first time she appeared on screen, I thought that she looked too cute to be a regular cast member for this show, so she would be delegated to a random villager role, but no.New character tropes include: a pirate, an alchemist, an automaton, a samurai, twin Chinese sisters, a dancer, a nun, a warrior slave, a devoted housewife, and others. There are enough characters to pique the interest of any heterosexual male. Speaking of which, this is obviously a show for teenage boys or men who act or think like teenage boys. There are a lot of clothes getting ripped or torn, or tentacle-like objects. Girls probably won't get much out of this show, unless they feel empowered by a rebellion led by young women. However, Code Geass is a way better story about a rebellion. This is also probably the only time someone would compare Code Geass to Queen's Blade.Notably the English dub is the same from the first series, which is done by the people at Media Blasters, not Sentai Filmworks. If you have seen the first series, then you know what to expect.Overall, the series is a very fun fan service show, but do expect ludicrous situations. The DVD or Blue Ray release comes with 2 music CDs, which is very nice. I just wish this was available for more anime. This collection also has some audio dramas and short OVA skits. These OVAs are even more perverse than the regular show, just like the OVA shorts for the first series.",4,Fan service insanity continues,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,3018,"['Queen', 'Blade', 'rather', 'new', 'famous', 'anime', 'title', 'when', 'fan', 'service', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'Queen', 'Blade', 'series', 'probably', 'best', 'fan', 'service', 'genre', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'new', 'release', 'exception', 'first', 'thought', 'Rebellion', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'tame', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'one', 'character', 'Luna', 'Luna', 'new', 'series', 'ridiculous', 'outfit', 'Echidna', 'snake', 'underwear', 'first', 'series', 'almost', 'look', 'normal.This', 'season', 'Queen', 'Blade', 'rebellion', 'who', 'new', 'tyrannical', 'queen', 'who', 'actually', 'Claudette', 'main', 'character', 'older', 'sister', 'first', 'series', 'new', 'main', 'character', 'violet', 'hair', 'colored', 'girl', 'named', 'Annelotte', 'Kreutz', 'knight', 'who', 'many', 'unusual', 'characters', 'show.In', 'first', 'series', 'many', 'characters', 'looked', 'were', 'fantasy', 'story', 'actually', 'looked', 'women', 'instead', 'cute', 'anime', 'characters', 'big', 'eyes', 'Not', 'characters', 'followed', 'feel', 'enough', 'did', 'follow', 'trend', 'series', 'seemed', 'use', 'more', 'anime', 'looking', 'character', 'designs', 'cast', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'young', 'girl', 'characters', 'time', 'kind', 'weird', 'seeing', 'show', 'tentacles', 'octopus', 'fragile', 'armor', 'suggestive', 'religious', 'poses', 'One', 'characters', 'Mirim', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'show', 'Mint', 'series', 'Galaxy', 'Angel', 'something', 'called', 'Hyper', 'Vibration', 'Armor', 'just', 'wrong', 'armor', 'opposed', 'anyone', 'else', 'first', 'time', 'appeared', 'screen', 'thought', 'looked', 'too', 'cute', 'be', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'delegated', 'random', 'villager', 'role', 'no.New', 'character', 'tropes', 'include', 'pirate', 'alchemist', 'automaton', 'samurai', 'twin', 'Chinese', 'sisters', 'dancer', 'nun', 'warrior', 'slave', 'devoted', 'housewife', 'others', 'are', 'enough', 'characters', 'pique', 'interest', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'Speaking', 'obviously', 'show', 'teenage', 'boys', 'men', 'who', 'act', 'think', 'teenage', 'boys', 'are', 'lot', 'clothes', 'getting', 'ripped', 'torn', 'tentacle-like', 'objects', 'Girls', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'show', 'feel', 'empowered', 'rebellion', 'led', 'young', 'women', 'However', 'Code', 'Geass', 'way', 'better', 'story', 'rebellion', 'also', 'probably', 'only', 'time', 'someone', 'would', 'compare', 'Code', 'Geass', 'Queen', 'Blade.Notably', 'English', 'dub', 'same', 'first', 'series', 'done', 'people', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'not', 'Sentai', 'Filmworks', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'series', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'expect.Overall', 'series', 'very', 'fun', 'fan', 'service', 'show', 'do', 'expect', 'ludicrous', 'situations', 'DVD', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'release', '2', 'music', 'CDs', 'very', 'nice', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'available', 'more', 'anime', 'collection', 'also', 'audio', 'dramas', 'short', 'OVA', 'skits', 'OVAs', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'perverse', 'regular', 'show', 'just', 'OVA', 'shorts', 'first', 'series']",N/A
