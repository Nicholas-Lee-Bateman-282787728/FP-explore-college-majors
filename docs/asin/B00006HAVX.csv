Say a lot.He does the niggers vs african american debate with biting insight. In my opinion however, he labours the point and the jokes aren't as funny as they can be. I agree with his views on the subject but I just don't find this segment as hilarious as the rest. The OJ thing has been overdone in black comedy circles, but Rock gives it a fresh angle and makes it funnier than anyone else. In fact, it is funnier than most new material done by other good comedians as well as lesser ones such as Bill Hicks.The platonis relationships skit is timeless. It's as if Rock was sitting alongside Frued when Siggy came up with his theory.

Before this, he had made a movie or two (CB4) and had a shorter comedy special, but his career had pretty much hit a plateau.  ""Bring the Pain"" changed this.  The show is incredibly funny and the material was very fresh when it was first broadcast.  Unfortunately, some of the humor is dated (comments about the Million Man March and the OJ Simpson murder trial).  However, even with some of the jokes being dated, they are still funny.  There is quite a bit of race humor (which while funny, as a white man I can't repeat any of it) and also sexual/relationship humor.  While Rock does curse (often at times), he does not lose sight of the fact that the humor is in the joke, not the language.

715654,A356RFKNIG043B,B00006HAVX,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","4.5 starsThe predecessor to the near-perfection of B&B;, Bring The Pain was Rock's first truly great routine and is full of typically sharp CR social commentary that also happens to be hilariously insightful. There are many many classic lines here, and you might be surprised at how Rock uses his angry urban black persona and voice (nothing like his real self when he's interviewed) to promote some rather conservative views.But most of those views are dead-on, as Rock is smart enough to realize that any bright mind chooses for itself what is right, and not just from the laundry list of what libs and cons are supposed to believe. He attacks that very dichotomy here to great effect, in fact, and he's to be praised for bringing plenty of off-kilter viewpoints to an audience that would usually disagree with them.Rock's delivery is so sharp, however, and his material so cutting and so true, that you can't deny much of what he says. It's his in-character style that really sells this tuff, and no one working today can touch him on that front. He uses that persona to skewer all sorts of preconceptions from both sides of the fence, and it's a genius move. Plus which, his perfect touch with black urban slang and attitude is perfect in and of itself. It allows him to do a bit perhaps no other comic of any race could get away with, the famous black people vs n's (""and n's gotta GO!""). There's some real genius in that, and also plenty of daring. Same with his bits on hitting women, education, welfare, and so many other things on BTP.Rock broke all sorts of new ground here, taking Richard Pryor's attitude to the next degree, something that was waiting for a guy like Rock to come along. That he does it so well, with such perfect delivery and timing, shows that he is without doubt the heir to Pryor's mantle as not only the best black American comic, but pretty much the best comic, period.This is his first truly great HBO special, and second only to B&B.; If you don't have that one, run don't walk to see it, as it's the best stand-up routine of the last 20 years to my ears. BTP comes in not far behind; the bits about Marion Barry, food, and reLAtionSHIPs are very funny, and the OJ stuff is probably the best of the endless OJ jokes of that time, especially as his viewpoint is so un-PC yet so very accurately funny.Now that Rock has plenty of cash he's lost the edge he once had--it happens to the best of artists, and more power to them for achieving success--but at this time and place (D.C., a perfect locale for this routine), he is at his near-best, and that's as good as any comedian since Bill Hicks, to my mind. In fact, while Bill may have been more daring, Rock is more consistently funny here, and I'd recommend this to anybody who likes to laugh, period.One of the best stand-up dvds I've seen, and I've seen hundreds.",5,"Rock's best, except for Bigger And Blacker",1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,2850,"['4.5', 'starsThe', 'predecessor', 'near-perfection', 'B', 'B', 'Bring', 'Pain', 'was', 'Rock', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'routine', 'full', 'typically', 'sharp', 'CR', 'social', 'commentary', 'also', 'be', 'hilariously', 'insightful', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'classic', 'lines', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'Rock', 'angry', 'urban', 'black', 'persona', 'voice', 'nothing', 'real', 'self', 'when', 'interviewed', 'promote', 'rather', 'conservative', 'views.But', 'most', 'views', 'are', 'dead-on', 'Rock', 'smart', 'enough', 'realize', 'bright', 'mind', 'chooses', 'what', 'right', 'not', 'just', 'laundry', 'list', 'what', 'libs', 'cons', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'very', 'dichotomy', 'here', 'great', 'effect', 'fact', 'be', 'praised', 'bringing', 'plenty', 'off-kilter', 'viewpoints', 'audience', 'would', 'usually', 'disagree', 'them.Rock', 'delivery', 'so', 'sharp', 'however', 'material', 'so', 'cutting', 'so', 'true', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'much', 'what', 'in-character', 'style', 'really', 'tuff', 'one', 'working', 'today', 'can', 'touch', 'front', 'persona', 'skewer', 'sorts', 'preconceptions', 'sides', 'fence', 'genius', 'move', 'perfect', 'touch', 'black', 'urban', 'slang', 'attitude', 'perfect', 'do', 'bit', 'perhaps', 'other', 'comic', 'race', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'famous', 'black', 'people', 'vs', 'n', 'got', 'ta', 'GO', 'real', 'genius', 'also', 'plenty', 'daring', 'Same', 'bits', 'hitting', 'women', 'education', 'welfare', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'BTP.Rock', 'broke', 'sorts', 'new', 'ground', 'here', 'taking', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'attitude', 'next', 'degree', 'something', 'was', 'waiting', 'guy', 'Rock', 'come', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'perfect', 'delivery', 'timing', 'doubt', 'heir', 'Pryor', 'mantle', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'black', 'American', 'comic', 'pretty', 'much', 'best', 'comic', 'period.This', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'HBO', 'special', 'second', 'only', 'B', 'B', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'see', 'best', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'last', '20', 'years', 'ears', 'BTP', 'not', 'far', 'bits', 'Marion', 'Barry', 'food', 'reLAtionSHIPs', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'OJ', 'stuff', 'probably', 'best', 'endless', 'OJ', 'jokes', 'time', 'especially', 'viewpoint', 'so', 'un-PC', 'yet', 'so', 'very', 'accurately', 'funny.Now', 'Rock', 'plenty', 'cash', 'lost', 'edge', 'once', 'had', 'best', 'artists', 'more', 'power', 'achieving', 'success', 'time', 'place', 'D.C.', 'perfect', 'locale', 'routine', 'near-best', 'as', 'good', 'comedian', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'mind', 'fact', 'Bill', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'daring', 'Rock', 'more', 'consistently', 'funny', 'here', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anybody', 'who', 'laugh', 'period.One', 'best', 'stand-up', 'dvds', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds']",N/A

Fortunately, we've moved on somewhat since then but even now, a black man who is intelligent, well read and articulate can often be considered a challenging prospect even from within his own community and not just outside of it. Add humour to the mix though and that man is immediately seen as less of a threat. If he's wise he can use being seen as a funny man to have even more influence than a man who goes around straightfaced. A man with great comic timing and incisive wit can thus go on and spread his message with genius. That genius is the man known as Chris Rock.I love black stand up as a whole but this dude is in a class of his own. By the time this 1996 performance was taped as an HBO special, he had honed his skill to perfection and ensured he would be known as more than the guy who got to play the butt of all the jokes in movies like ""Boomerang"", ""CB4"" and ""New Jack City"". No subject is sacred and no one is safe. Rock lays into Marion Barry (the former Mayor of Washington DC who was involved in a drug scandal and still managed to get re-elected. The show was taped at the Takoma Theatre in D.C. so the response of the audience was particularly interesting), O.J. Simpson, Colin Powell, and also talks about race relations, education, the crack epidemic, family values, sex & relationships and what he sees as the (still controversial) difference between `ni**as' and black people. Rock is totally irreverent, unrelenting and foul mouthed, while at the same time managing to remain intelligent, practical and sensitive with a central underlying moral core to his message. He may offend you but he'll make you laugh yourself silly while he's doing it AND make you think after he's done. Overall though, you know he's talking the truth and if that isn't genius then I don't know what is.I first saw this on cable TV back in 2001 and nearly wet myself laughing. I got the DVD and watched it again a few months ago and even though I knew most of what was coming, I was still in hysterics. I can't wait to watch it again. The journalist, author and urban social commentator Nelson George interviews him for one of the extras, while the others are basically silly music videos starring Rock himself. I never saw any of these videos on MTV (they were probably too risqu&eacute; anyway) and I don't recall any of the songs making it into the charts but they're still a hoot to see.

715658,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,B00006HAVX,Regina McMenamin,"[5, 6]","In the HBO Special that finally made Chris Rock a bonafide star, despite his brief run on Saturday Night Live, BRING THE PAIN, is definitely one of the funniest DVDs I have ever watched, but still comedy is hardly the subject of this DVD.  Instead, this is a social commentary from the mind of a man who looks at American culture with a fresh perspective: total honesty.In some ways Rock in this DVD is less like a comedian and more like a lion tamer, as he struts across the stage, nervously taking jabs at his mostly African American live audience, who react with boos and horror as he airs their dirty laundry in the front yard of white America.For example, he questions how DC mayor Marion Barry was reelected after he smoked crack on camera while in office and appeared at the famed Million Man March.  ""Even in our finest hour, we got a crack head on the stage,"" Rock taunts.Yes, the audience laughs, but as you watch this DVD you can feel the tension between Rock and the audience that is further enraged when Rock starts talking about how he hates the black criminals (Rock uses the n word) who ruin everything half way decent about life in black neighborhoods.These people (again he uses the n word) want credit for something a normal man just does.  ""Hey I take care of my kids,"" Rock claims these people boast.  ""You're supposed to take care of your kids.  Whaddya want a cookie?"" Rock asks as he repeatedly explains that he's tired tired tired of these black criminals.What's interesting about BRING THE PAIN, is that Rock is masterful at controlling the audience.  Just when you think everyone will leave DC's Tacoma theater in disgust over his taunting, Rock changes gear and begins to seduce them with other realities of life in America.Rock mentions that black people make up on 10% of the population of the US and that except for a few of the so-called Chocolate Cities (DC, New York, Gary, Chicago, etc) the rest of the country is made up of ""broke ass, mayonaise sandwich eating white people"" on welfare.  For this reason, Rock refutes the perception that black people were horrified by the welfare reforms of the mid 90s.  ""Black people don't give a s--- about welfare.  But n-----s are shaking in their boots.""Likewise, Rock also taunts the white liberal HBO audience that is undoubtedly equally as horrified by the potshots he takes at lefty icons like Hillary Clinton and his understanding of why OJ had to slice Nicole's head off. ""Ain't nobody above an ass whupping. There's a good reason to kick an old man down a flight of steps, just don't do it,"" Rock explains.In BRING THE PAIN, Rock blames the entire Clinton-Lewinsky debacle on the ex-presidents's wife Hillary who Rock claims should have been the first one on her knee to take care of her husband's needs.Yes, obviously BRING THE PAIN is crude at times and at every turn delivers the kind of politically incorrect language that in polite society would never be tolerated from a speaker of a different color.  But still I would show this DVD to my grandmother and recently screened it for an 88 year old woman who loved it.I loved BRING THE PAIN so much that I purchased ten copies of it and gave it as Christmas gifts to my most sophisticated friends.- Regina McMenamin",5,"Though Very Funny, This is Hardly a Strict Comedy Concert",1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3252,"['HBO', 'Special', 'finally', 'made', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'bonafide', 'star', 'brief', 'run', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'BRING', 'THE', 'PAIN', 'definitely', 'one', 'funniest', 'DVDs', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'still', 'comedy', 'hardly', 'subject', 'DVD', 'Instead', 'social', 'commentary', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'American', 'culture', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'total', 'honesty.In', 'ways', 'Rock', 'DVD', 'less', 'comedian', 'more', 'lion', 'tamer', 'stage', 'nervously', 'taking', 'jabs', 'mostly', 'African', 'American', 'live', 'audience', 'who', 'react', 'boos', 'horror', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'front', 'yard', 'white', 'America.For', 'example', 'questions', 'how', 'DC', 'mayor', 'Marion', 'Barry', 'was', 'reelected', 'smoked', 'crack', 'camera', 'office', 'appeared', 'famed', 'Million', 'Man', 'March', 'Even', 'finest', 'hour', 'got', 'crack', 'head', 'stage', 'Rock', 'taunts.Yes', 'audience', 'watch', 'DVD', 'can', 'feel', 'tension', 'Rock', 'audience', 'further', 'enraged', 'when', 'Rock', 'talking', 'how', 'black', 'criminals', 'Rock', 'n', 'word', 'who', 'ruin', 'everything', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'life', 'black', 'neighborhoods.These', 'people', 'again', 'n', 'word', 'want', 'credit', 'something', 'normal', 'man', 'just', 'Hey', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'Rock', 'people', 'boast', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'Whaddya', 'want', 'cookie', 'Rock', 'repeatedly', 'tired', 'tired', 'tired', 'black', 'criminals.What', 'interesting', 'BRING', 'THE', 'PAIN', 'Rock', 'masterful', 'controlling', 'audience', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'leave', 'DC', 'Tacoma', 'theater', 'disgust', 'taunting', 'Rock', 'changes', 'gear', 'seduce', 'other', 'realities', 'life', 'America.Rock', 'mentions', 'black', 'people', 'make', 'up', '10', '%', 'population', 'US', 'except', 'few', 'so-called', 'Chocolate', 'Cities', 'DC', 'New', 'York', 'Gary', 'Chicago', 'etc', 'rest', 'country', 'made', 'broke', 'ass', 'mayonaise', 'sandwich', 'eating', 'white', 'people', 'welfare', 'reason', 'Rock', 'perception', 'black', 'people', 'were', 'horrified', 'welfare', 'reforms', 'mid', '90s', 'Black', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 's', 'welfare', '-s', 'are', 'shaking', 'boots', 'Likewise', 'Rock', 'also', 'white', 'liberal', 'HBO', 'audience', 'undoubtedly', 'equally', 'horrified', 'potshots', 'lefty', 'icons', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'understanding', 'why', 'OJ', 'had', 'slice', 'Nicole', 'head', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'nobody', 'ass', 'whupping', 'good', 'reason', 'kick', 'old', 'man', 'down', 'flight', 'steps', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Rock', 'explains.In', 'BRING', 'THE', 'PAIN', 'Rock', 'entire', 'Clinton-Lewinsky', 'debacle', 'ex-presidents', 'wife', 'Hillary', 'who', 'Rock', 'claims', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'one', 'knee', 'take', 'care', 'husband', 'needs.Yes', 'obviously', 'THE', 'PAIN', 'crude', 'times', 'turn', 'kind', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'language', 'polite', 'society', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'tolerated', 'speaker', 'different', 'color', 'still', 'would', 'show', 'DVD', 'grandmother', 'recently', 'screened', '88', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'it.I', 'loved', 'BRING', 'PAIN', 'so', 'much', 'purchased', 'ten', 'copies', 'gave', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'friends.-', 'Regina', 'McMenamin']",N/A

Well, I finally have it, and even as a married man watching it sober in my apartment this DVD still cracks me up.  Since this performance was recorded in the mid-'90's and it's now 2004 I was worried the material might seem dated, but Rock's insightful and colorful discussions of human failings are not only universal, but timeless.  Much of what he discusses here may not be in the news anymore, but you could substitute any number of current happenings and his remarks would fit just as well.  The man's animated style and frequent use of profanity are certanly entertaining, but beneath the shouted profanities is a razor-sharp wit backed by a lot of common sense and deep feel for irony.  With his knack for cutting through rhetoric and hyprocrisy to get at the underlying truth, Rock could even be called one of America's leading black conservatives.Rock bursts out of the gate with a bitingly hilarious bit on Marion Barry, musing that Barry managed to get reelected as mayor of Washington after being convicted of behavior that would get you fired from McDonald's.  Discussing a slightly more respectable figure in the form of Colin Powell, Rock highlights the low expectations whites hold for blacks by pointing out that an educated black general can be praised merely for speaking well.  This being the mid-90's, there was the obligatory bit on O.J., but Rock manages to go deeper than most comics in analyzing what the case said about the nature of fame and America's racial divide.  The real high point of the performance, though, is Chris's discussion of the divisions within black America itself, exemplified by the distinction he draws between black people and, well, a word I can't use on this site.  At any rate, Rock's penetrating look at this country's black underclass and its pathologies is hilarious, thought-provoking, and deadly accurate at the same time.There a few more good bits here, including an off-color riff on platonic friendship, but it's Rock's look at racial issues that makes this DVD for me.  He may occasionally drive home his points crudely, but Rock also advocates old-fashioned ideas like responsibility and self-respect which are all too lacking today, black or white.  A true equal-opportunity offender, Rock deserves a shot from all thinking people.",4,"Chris Rock, black conservative leader?",1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,2495,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'hoping', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'quot', 'Bring', 'Pain', 'quot', 'ever', 'college', 'when', 'friends', 'would', 'occasionally', 'sit', 'around', 'getting', 'drunk', 'listening', 'performance', 'CD', 'Well', 'finally', 'have', 'even', 'married', 'man', 'watching', 'sober', 'apartment', 'DVD', 'still', 'up', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', ""mid-'90"", 'now', '2004', 'was', 'worried', 'material', 'might', 'seem', 'dated', 'Rock', 'insightful', 'colorful', 'discussions', 'human', 'failings', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'universal', 'timeless', 'Much', 'what', 'here', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'news', 'anymore', 'could', 'substitute', 'number', 'current', 'happenings', 'remarks', 'would', 'fit', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'animated', 'style', 'frequent', 'use', 'profanity', 'are', 'certanly', 'entertaining', 'shouted', 'profanities', 'razor-sharp', 'wit', 'backed', 'lot', 'common', 'sense', 'deep', 'feel', 'irony', 'knack', 'cutting', 'rhetoric', 'hyprocrisy', 'get', 'underlying', 'truth', 'Rock', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'called', 'one', 'America', 'leading', 'black', 'conservatives.Rock', 'gate', 'bitingly', 'hilarious', 'bit', 'Marion', 'Barry', 'musing', 'Barry', 'managed', 'get', 'reelected', 'mayor', 'Washington', 'being', 'convicted', 'behavior', 'would', 'get', 'fired', 'McDonald', 'Discussing', 'slightly', 'more', 'respectable', 'figure', 'form', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Rock', 'low', 'expectations', 'whites', 'hold', 'blacks', 'pointing', 'out', 'educated', 'black', 'general', 'can', 'be', 'praised', 'merely', 'speaking', 'well', 'being', 'mid-90', 'was', 'obligatory', 'bit', 'O.J.', 'Rock', 'go', 'deeper', 'most', 'comics', 'analyzing', 'what', 'case', 'said', 'nature', 'fame', 'America', 'racial', 'divide', 'real', 'high', 'point', 'performance', 'Chris', 'discussion', 'divisions', 'black', 'America', 'exemplified', 'distinction', 'black', 'people', 'well', 'word', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'site', 'rate', 'Rock', 'penetrating', 'look', 'country', 'black', 'underclass', 'pathologies', 'hilarious', 'thought-provoking', 'deadly', 'accurate', 'same', 'time.There', 'few', 'more', 'good', 'bits', 'here', 'including', 'off-color', 'riff', 'platonic', 'friendship', 'Rock', 'look', 'racial', 'issues', 'DVD', 'may', 'occasionally', 'drive', 'home', 'points', 'crudely', 'Rock', 'also', 'old-fashioned', 'ideas', 'responsibility', 'self-respect', 'are', 'too', 'lacking', 'today', 'black', 'white', 'true', 'equal-opportunity', 'offender', 'Rock', 'shot', 'thinking', 'people']",N/A
