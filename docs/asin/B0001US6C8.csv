813168,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B0001US6C8,Alexiel,"[6, 8]","Uh oh, here comes the unhelpful votes. But really. This movie is not that bad. I'm not sure what people are expecting from a movie whose front box photo features Paris Hilton. ""Gee, a direct-to-DVD-release that never made the theaters and has a cast of people you've never heard of, a knock-off of the Scream box art on front, and Paris Hilton prominently featured. I'll go in expecting high cinema like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Rashomon.""Hardly. First off, too much emphasis is placed on Paris Hilton. She's not even in the movie that much and is the first to die. I know it's easy to take potshots at anything Hilton is involved in, but let's try and look past that since she isn't involved much.Why do I give this movie three stars? Because it entertained me. That's all I was looking for. My local video store gives you a deal that when you rent a new release in the middle of the week, you get a regular release free. Over time, I've ended up seeing a lot of horrible and unwatchable horror movies. This wasn't one of them.The opening scenes of everyone talking and drinking may seem to go on too long, but I think it works to establish the characterization. The dialogue is smarter than you might expect, if you want to rip on crap, check out those ""scary"" movies made by the Sci-Fi channel aired at odd times, or the Christian Slater/Tara Reid movie ""Alone in The Dark."" Those are crap. This isn't.The characters in this movie all seemed somewhat intelligent with realistic ways of coping with being trapped in a house isolated from the outside world while a malignant phantom possesses their friends. The visuals are well done, and the house itself is pretty good looking.The best characters, somewhat obviously, to me are Peter and Laura. Both of them turned in performances that were quite good, especially the actress who played Laura, no phoning in of roles here.Like I said earlier, this movie is a little smarter than people let on in some ways. In the early talk about existentialism and dice, there's a nice, wry, ""this is pretentious and nonsensical"" air of self-awareness that you don't find in a lot of movies that try and play a scene like that straight.Second, this movie actually has some characters that hole themselves up in a lock room and say ""Screw it, we're staying here, we're not leaving here for any reason until our phones work, etc."" Now that's not something you see too often, most of the time it's ""Split up so we can cover more ground."" Yeah.The last point I wanted to touch on was that this movie is properly suspenseful. The whole idea of being locked away in this one room while all around you there's a vengeful spirit just waiting for you to slip up somehow is a pretty good one, I think. The guys who wander around looking for their possessed killer friend (not a good idea, but it makes for more action-oriented movies) while the ""friend"" stalks them was also entertaining. The ""effect"" that the possessed friends have, while not high-budget, is suitably eerie. Finally, the idea that even if you come face to face with this possessed fiend, if you kill them, the spirit leaves and possesses you, poses a unique challenge to those who want to stay alive and survive the curse of the castle.That said, this movie does suffer from a lot of the same flaws that similar low-budget horror movies suffer from, but I'll take ""Nine Lives"" over ""Fear Of The Dark,"" ""Alone In The Dark,"" or ""The Devil's Pond.""",3,Come on... it's not that bad. *May contain minor spoilers*,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,3448,"['Uh', 'oh', 'here', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'really', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'front', 'box', 'photo', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Gee', 'direct-to-DVD-release', 'never', 'made', 'theaters', 'cast', 'people', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'knock-off', 'Scream', 'box', 'art', 'front', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'prominently', 'featured', ""'ll"", 'go', 'expecting', 'high', 'cinema', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Rashomon.', 'Hardly', 'First', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'not', 'even', 'movie', 'much', 'first', 'die', 'know', 'easy', 'take', 'potshots', 'anything', 'Hilton', 'involved', 'let', 'try', 'look', ""n't"", 'involved', 'much.Why', 'do', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'entertained', 'was', 'looking', 'My', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'deal', 'when', 'rent', 'new', 'release', 'middle', 'week', 'get', 'regular', 'release', 'free', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'lot', 'horrible', 'unwatchable', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'them.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'talking', 'drinking', 'may', 'seem', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'think', 'establish', 'characterization', 'dialogue', 'smarter', 'might', 'expect', 'want', 'rip', 'crap', 'check', 'out', 'scary', 'movies', 'made', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'aired', 'odd', 'times', 'Christian', 'Slater/Tara', 'Reid', 'movie', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'are', 'crap', ""isn't.The"", 'characters', 'movie', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'intelligent', 'realistic', 'ways', 'coping', 'being', 'trapped', 'house', 'isolated', 'outside', 'world', 'malignant', 'phantom', 'friends', 'visuals', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'house', 'pretty', 'good', 'looking.The', 'best', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'obviously', 'are', 'Peter', 'Laura', 'turned', 'performances', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Laura', 'phoning', 'roles', 'here.Like', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie', 'little', 'smarter', 'people', 'let', 'ways', 'early', 'talk', 'existentialism', 'dice', 'nice', 'wry', 'pretentious', 'nonsensical', 'air', 'self-awareness', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'lot', 'movies', 'try', 'play', 'scene', 'straight.Second', 'movie', 'actually', 'characters', 'hole', 'up', 'lock', 'room', 'say', 'Screw', ""'re"", 'staying', 'here', ""'re"", 'not', 'leaving', 'here', 'reason', 'phones', 'work', 'etc', 'Now', 'not', 'something', 'see', 'too', 'often', 'most', 'time', 'Split', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'cover', 'more', 'ground', 'Yeah.The', 'last', 'point', 'wanted', 'touch', 'was', 'movie', 'properly', 'suspenseful', 'whole', 'idea', 'being', 'locked', 'away', 'one', 'room', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'just', 'waiting', 'slip', 'up', 'somehow', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'think', 'guys', 'who', 'wander', 'looking', 'possessed', 'killer', 'friend', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'movies', 'friend', 'stalks', 'was', 'also', 'entertaining', 'effect', 'possessed', 'friends', 'have', 'not', 'high-budget', 'suitably', 'eerie', 'Finally', 'idea', 'even', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'possessed', 'fiend', 'kill', 'spirit', 'unique', 'challenge', 'who', 'want', 'stay', 'alive', 'survive', 'curse', 'castle.That', 'said', 'movie', 'suffer', 'lot', 'same', 'flaws', 'similar', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'suffer', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Nine', 'Fear', 'Dark', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'Devil', 'Pond']",Nine Lives

813172,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0001US6C8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","There's no way I could avoid a horror movie with Paris Hilton in it.  I admit it - I like Paris Hilton, even though her acting is as flat as her chest, and she seems particularly out of place in this particular movie.  As far as I can tell, her character is the only American in a group of old schoolmates getting together to celebrate one of their own's twenty-first birthday.  It turns out that Paris doesn't have as significant of a role as the DVD cover would lead you to believe, so it is possible for even the most ardent of Paris haters to approach Nine Lives as just another horror film - just another disappointing horror film, to be exact.So these nine friends get together at the palatial, Scottish family estate of Tim (Patrick Kennedy).  No one minds that a huge snowstorm is coming because there is plenty of good food, an ample supply of alcohol, and - while I can't speak for the men - all the women are fine.  The only mystery seems to concern who is going to sleep with whom and how soon. Then, before any shenanigans can commence, one of the nine goes and gets herself murdered.  At first, the quickly assembled others are worried that someone else is in the house, but they come to realize the murderer is one of them when they learn that he also attacked one of the guys in the library.  By now, they're snowbound in the manor house with no working phones of any kind.  Rather than staying together, they naturally head off in different directions, thus making the killer's job of picking them off one by one a good bit easier.  This is no ordinary killer, either.  It's an avenging spirit who can switch bodies, a fact which lovely brainiac Laura (Amelia Warner) somehow figures out based on very little evidence.  The end result is that the friends can't even trust one another implicitly because any of them could be the next killer.The weak storyline is somewhat less than believable, the deaths seem to involve a surprisingly small amount of blood loss, and characters started dying before I could clearly distinguish who was whom among the guys.  Logic is turned on its head and then pretty much ignored altogether as events play out.  You know only one person is going to survive it all, but it's hard to pick a champion among them.  I wanted to pull for Laura, but her bossiness and her poor exercise of existentialist thought kept trumping the fact that she looked like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones.  In the end, Nine Lives is just another in a long line of plot-challenged, disappointing horror films.  I can't even say it had any real potential because it is just taking us to places we've already been.",3,A weak plot makes this an average horror film at best,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,2635,"['way', 'could', 'avoid', 'horror', 'movie', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'admit', 'like', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'even', 'acting', 'as', 'flat', 'chest', 'particularly', 'place', 'particular', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'character', 'only', 'American', 'group', 'old', 'schoolmates', 'getting', 'together', 'celebrate', 'one', 'own', 'twenty-first', 'birthday', 'out', 'Paris', ""n't"", 'have', 'significant', 'role', 'DVD', 'cover', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'possible', 'even', 'most', 'ardent', 'Paris', 'haters', 'approach', 'Nine', 'Lives', 'just', 'horror', 'film', 'just', 'disappointing', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'exact.So', 'nine', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'palatial', 'Scottish', 'family', 'estate', 'Tim', 'Patrick', 'Kennedy', 'one', 'huge', 'snowstorm', 'coming', 'plenty', 'good', 'food', 'ample', 'supply', 'alcohol', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'fine', 'only', 'mystery', 'concern', 'who', 'going', 'sleep', 'whom', 'how', 'soon', 'Then', 'shenanigans', 'can', 'commence', 'one', 'nine', 'murdered', 'first', 'quickly', 'assembled', 'others', 'are', 'worried', 'someone', 'else', 'house', 'come', 'realize', 'murderer', 'one', 'when', 'learn', 'also', 'attacked', 'one', 'guys', 'library', 'now', ""'re"", 'snowbound', 'manor', 'house', 'working', 'phones', 'kind', 'Rather', 'staying', 'together', 'naturally', 'head', 'off', 'different', 'directions', 'thus', 'making', 'killer', 'job', 'picking', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'good', 'bit', 'easier', 'ordinary', 'killer', 'either', 'avenging', 'spirit', 'who', 'can', 'switch', 'bodies', 'fact', 'lovely', 'brainiac', 'Laura', 'Amelia', 'Warner', 'somehow', 'out', 'based', 'very', 'little', 'evidence', 'end', 'result', 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'trust', 'one', 'implicitly', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'killer.The', 'weak', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'less', 'believable', 'deaths', 'seem', 'involve', 'surprisingly', 'small', 'amount', 'blood', 'loss', 'characters', 'started', 'dying', 'could', 'clearly', 'distinguish', 'who', 'was', 'whom', 'guys', 'Logic', 'turned', 'head', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'altogether', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'know', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'going', 'survive', 'hard', 'pick', 'champion', 'wanted', 'pull', 'Laura', 'bossiness', 'poor', 'exercise', 'existentialist', 'thought', 'trumping', 'fact', 'looked', 'young', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'end', 'Nine', 'Lives', 'just', 'long', 'line', 'plot-challenged', 'disappointing', 'horror', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'had', 'real', 'potential', 'just', 'taking', 'places', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been']",Nine Lives

For example, they tried using a lot of jump scenes to scare the audience (cause the movie it's self sure couldn't do it).  Problem was, they made it overly obvious, and the music was totally off, so the closest you might come is when you role your eyes at the lame attempt.  Not only that, the composer was unable to generate any kind of tension at all.  And the story, wow.  We have a guy who had some med schooling, and can't bandage a cut?

Nine attractive college friends are snowbound in a huge manor in the secluded countryside of Scotland.  (One can become literally lost in the manor's maze of rooms.)  The atmosphere is creepy, cold, and foreboding.The ghost of a Scottish land baron, Murray, is angry because his eyes were gouged out and his lands and home seized from him.  He possesses one youth and begins to slaughter the others.  The ghost passes from one body to another, reminding me of the alien creature in ""The Hidden"" and the demonic creature that was Jason Voorhees in ""Jason Goes to Hell.""""Nine Lives"" is a good slasher film in that the viewer doesn't know who will die next.  However, there are no major revelations or surprises and no twist ending.  In fact, the ending was rather mundane.  This film is essentially standard slasher fare.Paris Hilton's performance was also a disappointment.  She receives top billing and I suspect her name appeal drew American audiences to rent this DVD.  She is the only American in the film.  The rest of the cast consists mostly of attractive Europeans with British and Scottish accents.  Paris basically plays herself:  a wealthy, spoiled socialite who lives a carefree, selfish life.  She barely raises her voice when threatened.  Paris' character is the first to die, which is early in the film.""Nine Lives"" shouldn't be bypassed altogether.  It does have some startling moments and the snowbound setting is wonderful.

Munson,"[7, 9]","I must admit, when I saw that Paris Hilton was the star of this movie, I wasn't sure if I should bother watching it, but after seeing it, I was glad I decided to go ahead and watch.The story goes like this.  Tim (Patrick Kennedy) has invited several of his college friends, Emma (Rosie Fellner), Lucy (Vivienne Harvey), Jo (Paris Hilton), Tom (Lex Schrapnel), Paul (David Leitch), Pete (David Nicolle), Andy (Ben Peyton), Damien (James Schleginger), Linda (Maureen Turner), and Laura( Amelia Warner) to spend the weekend in his Scottish manor house in honor of his 21st birthday.  A major snowstorm has covered the house.After getting re-aquainted with each other and settling into their rooms, the group gathers in the parlor for drinks.  Tom leaves to go to the restroom, but something strange happens to him; he sees his reflection in the mirror only to discover that his eyes are gone.  However, he snaps out of this and soon returns to normal.  Or does he?  Many of the guests soon decide to go to bed, all except Tom and Tim.  Tom is looking through the books in the library when he stumbles upon a volume about the history of the house.The book speaks about a man named Murray, a Scottish patriot who had his eyes cut out during the English invasion.  The spirit of Murray is contained in the book, and soon, it is unleashed.  Once the spirit enters the body of a person, that person is turned into a murderer. When the original murderer is killed, the spirit moves itself into the body of the person who killed the original murderer and so on.  A vicious circle has been unleashed in Tim's house.  Tom is the first person infected with Murray's spirit.  Who will survive?  Will the chain be broken, or will everyone end up dead?I found this movie to be very good.  True, Paris Hilton can't act, and thank goodness she didn't try to use a fake British accent.  But the rest of the cast are actually very good in their roles.  I thought the plot was well-conceived, and the tension among the characters is evident throughout the movie as they try to figure out who is carrying Murray's spirit within them.I feel this movie is worth watching, not for Paris Hilton (she actually dies very early in the movie), but for the unique plot twists which occur throughout the film.

If you are a Paris Hilton nut, then you will buy this no matter what I say, so what's the point? Well, let's just say you deserve fair warning. Paris Hilton does look good in this movie, well the first half anyway, she's the first to die. OK, you get to see her in a couple of slinky tight dresses, and a white tank top without a bra. Let's just say for that scene they had the AC turned up. You don't even get to see her die. One scene she's talking to a door, then for a split second you see a hand come through a glass window. Cut to a few scenes later and she's lying face down with a stomach wound. That's it.The plot is thin to say the least, part Clue, part Evil Dead. A bunch of kids are in a house celebrating a 21st birthday of their friend. One of them discovers an ancient book about some dude who was tortured and had his eyes removed. So now he has 'returned'. He possesses one body at a time as he goes around killing one by one. Finally there is a lone survivor. I won't give it away, but he (or she!) finds out the diabolical spectre's secret and why he (or she) was allowed to live. Lame.If anything else can be said, the character Laura is espescially aggravating. Her inane dialouge was written by a third rate script hack who didn't proofread or revise.

813185,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0001US6C8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","Nine Lives (Andrew Green, 2002)NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Okay, well, it's only a ""spoiler"" if you've never seen a horror movie with Paris Hilton in it. But still, if you don't want to know what I'm sure the writer and director intended as a critical twist in the film (as predictable as it may be), you will want to stop reading this paragraph. I'll make it easy for you and give you the final verdict right here: unless you're a connoisseur of crappy slasher films, you can avoid this one.Hey Hollywood, here's a mandate for you: every time Paris Hilton gets cast in a horror film, that horror film should be called Paris Hilton Dies First. Really, there aren't any exceptions to the rule, that I know of anyway. Even when you scrape the bottom of Paris' acting barrel, way back at the beginning of her ""career"", when she was young and needed the money. (Well, not really, but still.) Aside from a bit part in a bad family comedy when she was eleven, Nine Lives was Paris Hilton's first movie. It's a short (eighty-five minute) British affair, full of clich&eacute;, predictable, and silly, and honestly, the only reason to watch it is that it's Paris Hilton's first movie. But as I write this it sits at #78 on the IMDB Bottom 100, and I have to ask: people, you really hated it that much? I can think of one hundred films off the top of my head (well, no, but I can consult my 100 worst movies ever spreadsheet and get back to you) worse than this almost immediately.Plot: a bunch of old school friends head up to a remote castle in Scotland, owned by Tim (Patrick Kennedy, from the upcoming Spielberg joint War Horse), one of the group. Also there are Tom (Lex Shrapnel--no, really, and what's more, he's Deborah Kerr's grandkid!) and his girlfriend Jo (Hilton); childhood pals Damien (A Feast of Friends' James Schlesinger, who gave up acting and got behind the camera soon after) and Pete (Band of Brothers' David Nicolle); Emma ('s Rosie Fellner), whom Pete is rather sweet on, and brainless socialite Lucy (Dead Outside's Vivienne Harvey); Laura (Aeon Flux's Amelia Warner), Pete's former girlfriend; and Andy (The Bill's Ben Payton), Lucy's current beau. Nine kids in a big Scottish castle with a winter storm coming. Perfect setting for a slasher film. There's more to it (a supernatural angle that's entirely ripped off from the movieFallen (Snap Case)), but that's your basic setup, and it's really all you need to know.Andrew Green also wrote the film (note it's the only one credited to him on IMDB, and there's a good reason for that), and despite how generally bad it is, you have to admit the guy's got a decent eye for atmosphere; it's about the only thing in the film that works, and it goes away whenever one of the uniformly-inexperienced cast (only Fellner and Payton had previous substantive acting credits) opens his or her mouth, but there is atmosphere to be had in the creaky old castle, and Green plays it up as much as he can. Too bad there's nothing else to go with it. The script is woeful, the acting is wooden, even the lighting is embarrassing every once in a while. And yet it's not a total loss; the sets are wonderful, there are a handful of jumps to be had in an otherwise badly-paced movie, that sort of thing. And given that it's not a total loss, I just browsed the seventy-seven movies currently sitting beneath it at IMDB, and am shocked. There's noJesus Christ Vampire Hunter (Special Edition DVD). Ulli Lommel'sBlack Dahliais conspicuous in its absence (though Lommel is represented with the almost-as-awfulZombie Nation). Amir Valinia'sMutantsand Tom Skull'sGrizzly Park? Nowhere in sight.Jennifer's Body? Spiker? Dustin Voigt's Marked? Goblet of Gore? Need I go on? Because I can. I can give you ninety more, in fact. (Those who counted: two of the movies on my list actually appear in IMDB's. They are Monster A Go-Go and Attack of the Swamp Creatures (A.K.A. Hydra A.K.A. Zaat).)

813186,AUO5SZSK6P4CD,B0001US6C8,"R. Stringini ""moviman7643""","[7, 11]","All I can say is that this movie was dull.  It just never has any tension... nothing.  The script just never seems to want to speed up, or make anything seem urgent, so instead we just get characters wandering around, and getting killed in very ungory fashions (all stab wounds, all very cheap looking).  And the thing is, it had potential to be good.  The cast, with the exception of Paris Hilton (more on that later) seemed very up to task.  And the location, which honestly was not used enough, could have been very creepy, and very maze like, but no.  The problem is that the script, which seems to want to avoid being a slasher, ends up falling flat.  This one needed to be a slasher.  It needed insane gore.  It needed something!  But as it is now, it's just a snore.  And plot holes... well, lets just ignore the fact that things make almost no sense for a while, and yet everyone seems to figure it all out.Now, about the main advertising bit for this film, Paris Hilton.  She isn't a terrible actress, not by a long shot.  And she does seem okay in this movie, but the rest of the cast seems better trained then she does, so she seems to fall a bit flat at times.  And do you notice how, on the cover, she's dead center?  Well, she is in the movie for a total of... oh, ten minutes.  And the reason she gets killed makes no sense considering that they gave the killers motive as hating British people (long, dull story).  She's American, she doesn't fake the accent (thank God) and doesn't fit in to the mold of the rest of the victims.  Still, she does okay, but would probably do better against an American horror movie cast.Over all, the movie is weak.  It just never amounts to anything, and lacks the tension and suspense that all horror movies need.  I am also still wondering how this movie got an R rating.  There is hardly any violence (almost all off camera) and even then, nothing more than a little smeared blood.  I can't remember there being a ton of swearing, and there is no nudity at all.  Seemed like PG-13 fair to me.  Probably wanted the R so people would possibly pick it up for a glimpse of Paris's body.

Even though she gets top billing, she is the first character to get killed in about the first 20 minutes.The story, such that there is of it, concerns 9 friends getting together at a Scottish mansion far off the beaten path.  kind of a 20's ""Big Chill"" gathering.For the first 20 minutes or so they just sit around blah-blahing about their school days.  One of them finds a book hidden in a hole in the wall.  He begins to read it and then suddenly the pages all read ""I have returned!""  ohhhh...really spooky!(...)When he gets killed, the ghost jumps to the body of the person who killed him/her and the killing begins again.The story is part ghost story and part slasher film and does neither one all that well.  Of course the friends split up to find the killer making them fair game to get killed off easily.It's not particularly scary and certainly not enough gore or inventive ways to kill to satisfy splatter fans.  It's really quite dull with all the usual trappings:  stuck in an old house.,..story prevents you from leaving, power and phone lines are out, cell phones don't get a signal...yadda yadda...The people are so dull and so uninteresting that you're really hoping they all die.And of course there is NO explanation as to just who Murray is, and why he ""returned"" to kill off these people.

So if you want to see her, remember that the time alloted to her is not very long, and she looks like strayed into this film by accident (because her role requires little to do, virtually nothing but playing herself).  And as to her acting, I do not say anything, for her role (Jo, that's the name) is not a big one.  Whether or not  she can really do something, I cannot be sure.Well, but I can say for certain that the film itself is plain awful.  The young boys and girls travel all the way to a country house  in Scotland, where they celebrate the 21st birthday of one member.  But because of the supernatual existence, they start to get killed one after another, while they are all confined in the mansion surrounded by the wilderness.  And it is winter.  And it starts snowing.  And the telephone is dead.  And ...You have seen this type of situaion many times before.  The awfully contrived story includes one of the silliest ways of breaking the (last) comminication with the outside world -- I mean, the characters really (yes, really) manages to crush the cellphone with ... er ... a bed.  (See how it happens, and laugh.)  And the photography is so poor that you cannot see clearly the 'terrible' things which the terrified boys are referring to.The film's central character is not played by Paris Hilton; it is by Amelia Warner, who previously appeared in two pretty good films -- 'Quills' and TV's 'Lorna Doone.'  Now whatever she had achieved in there should be cancelled out because of the awful acting she gives here.  I don't like saying this, but to me at least it was very painful to see her character lacking any emotions that the film requires.  Perhaps the film is to be blamed.  Perhaps not.  See it for yourself.Total failure, and that's all I can say.
