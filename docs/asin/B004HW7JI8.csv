This show puts me on a roller-coaster of emotions in just one episode I cry, I laugh, I cheer (for Ezra and Aria), and i also get really mad. This show has been one of the greatest tv shows that i have seen in the longest time and i have been watching it since episode 1. I don't think many people would be disappointed in the show if they actually sit down and watch it from season one. It is a show that fills all my need, scary, funny, intense, mind-blowing, confusing and makes me think all the time. And they don't just leave leave you with a cliffhanger leave leave you with a Mount Everest hanger. this is the greatest show i can not express my love for it enough and i think everyone should give it a huge chance cause it will definantly not let you down.",5,"""A""mazing",1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,853,"['Ok', 'just', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'i', 'am', 'writing', 'finale', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'roller-coaster', 'emotions', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'cry', 'laugh', 'cheer', 'Ezra', 'Aria', 'i', 'also', 'get', 'really', 'mad', 'show', 'been', 'one', 'greatest', 'tv', 'shows', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'longest', 'time', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'episode', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'show', 'actually', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'need', 'scary', 'funny', 'intense', 'mind-blowing', 'confusing', 'think', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'leave', 'cliffhanger', 'leave', 'leave', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'hanger', 'greatest', 'show', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'love', 'enough', 'i', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'give', 'huge', 'chance', 'cause', 'will', 'definantly', 'not', 'let', 'down']",Pretty Little Liars:S2 (DVD)

1409623,A1PGC1T69RUJKW,B004HW7JI8,Annette,"[0, 0]","Loved the first series and watched the second series and decided that I wanted them as part of my collection of movies and t.v. series. Our local library had part one so I've been able to watch it at my leasure and really enjoyed the first season so when season 2 came out I had told my family that I wanted it for Christmas but they surprised me and ordered both seasons for me just because they could. Great quality and great service as it arrived within 6 days of them ordering and was perfect. This show gets better and better and although the books are very different from the televison show, it's so much fun to watch and to lose yourself an episode at a time. I had planned on waiting for the price to come down but when I looked at our stores prices, Amazon and it's sellers were $20.00 cheaper than the cheapest store price so it was a good deal all around. Having a large selection of things to watch at our home when it's convient for us is a big plus and having Pretty Little Liars seasons 1 and 2 is quite enjoyable for me, especially the price. Being able to pause and rewind and catch something I may have missed when watching it the first or second time is wonderful and this series has certainly kept me guessing as to who will ""A"" really turn out to be.

1409627,A1SOZ51PECGR0E,B004HW7JI8,Bianca Vandenbos,"[5, 8]","No matter how much better I liked this season of Pretty Little Liars better than the first season I had to give it 3 1/2 stars. There were both good and bad things about this show. I liked how we found out more shocking secrets and the show is suspensful especially the big secret about Spencers family and who A was and one good twist was there is an A team so theres more people involved in texting the girls nasty messages and that these people might have been involved in the murder of Alison. What was dissapointing was somebody was also killed off ""supposedly"" in the show and while it wasn't who I expected to get killed off it was kind of dissapointing. What really annoyed me is that if you're like me and you've read the book series, ABC Family fooled us into thinking that A wasn't who A was in the first 4 books and that got on my nerves because I expected someone different. But all in all this was a great season. However I do have to mention one important thing. Parents I suggest that you don't let younger teenagers or teenagers that are impressionable watch this. Because there is a student teacher reltionship going on with Aria and Mr.Fitz and the show is making it look okay which it shouldn't. And parents might not like some of the unrealistic things the parents of Aria do. One thing is Arias father gets a job for Ezra far away from Rosewood despite wanting to call the police on him. What is he waiting for? And the fact that Arias mother doesn't want to call the police because they don't want the police in their lives again and doesn't want Aria to elope with him but at the same time she doesn't want Aria to be with the teacher. But really theres no other way except to call the police and get the teacher away from Aria. There is also a scene where Aria and Mr. Fitz are having sex but its not explicit and they just show them kissing and about to take their clotes off but the sex scene isn't intense. But talk to your kids and tell them most of the stuff in that show is unrealistic especially the parents not doing much about the student teacher relationship.",4,3. 5 stars it was a great season but some things were dissapointing,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2094,"['matter', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'liked', 'season', 'Pretty', 'Little', 'Liars', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'show', 'liked', 'how', 'found', 'out', 'more', 'shocking', 'secrets', 'show', 'suspensful', 'especially', 'big', 'secret', 'Spencers', 'family', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'good', 'twist', 'was', 'A', 'team', 'so', 'more', 'people', 'involved', 'texting', 'girls', 'nasty', 'messages', 'people', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'murder', 'Alison', 'What', 'was', 'dissapointing', 'was', 'somebody', 'was', 'also', 'killed', 'off', 'supposedly', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'who', 'expected', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'was', 'kind', 'dissapointing', 'What', 'really', 'annoyed', ""'re"", ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'series', 'ABC', 'Family', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'A', 'was', ""n't"", 'who', 'was', 'first', '4', 'books', 'got', 'nerves', 'expected', 'someone', 'different', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'mention', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'Parents', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'younger', 'teenagers', 'teenagers', 'are', 'impressionable', 'watch', 'student', 'teacher', 'reltionship', 'going', 'Aria', 'Mr.Fitz', 'show', 'making', 'look', 'should', ""n't"", 'parents', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'parents', 'Aria', 'do', 'One', 'thing', 'Arias', 'father', 'job', 'Ezra', 'far', 'away', 'Rosewood', 'wanting', 'call', 'police', 'What', 'waiting', 'fact', 'Arias', 'mother', ""n't"", 'want', 'call', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'police', 'lives', 'again', ""n't"", 'want', 'Aria', 'elope', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'want', 'Aria', 'be', 'teacher', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'call', 'police', 'get', 'teacher', 'away', 'Aria', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'Aria', 'Mr.', 'Fitz', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'not', 'explicit', 'just', 'show', 'kissing', 'take', 'clotes', 'sex', 'scene', ""n't"", 'intense', 'talk', 'kids', 'tell', 'most', 'stuff', 'show', 'unrealistic', 'especially', 'parents', 'not', 'doing', 'much', 'student', 'teacher', 'relationship']",Pretty Little Liars:S2 (DVD)

I do think if you are concerned about exposure to stories of pre marital sexual relationships or teacher/student affairs you need to keep this show away from your kids. I definitely do not condone the story line of Aria & Mr Fitz's on going affair. I do hope this is the end of that story line. I believe Mr Fitz's character should have shown some & ended the relationship as soon as he found out Aria's true age. Other than that, it has alot of interesting twists and turns. Older teens can understand the ins & outs. Does teach that deception has a price and can be worse than dealing with the consequences of telling the truth immediately.

The story continues with A's antics causing rifts between the girls and their family and significant others. I definitely found this season creepier than the last with scenes in a haunted house, a murky lake, and a doll hospital. A continues to be one step ahead of the girls, always threatening to release a secret or damage a relationship. As everyone comes under suspicion, the identity of A is finally revealed in the season finale...or so it seems...I took off one star for this season only because I felt like some of the mystery was spiraling out of control. It was hard to keep track of all the suspected characters and where they were at different times and how they relate back to the clues. It also seemed like many of the arguments the central characters have with their parents or loved ones continually repeat to the point of exhaustion. I'm still excited to start the third season but I hope to see some fresh faces or at least some clarity about many of the characters.",4,More Scandal and Mystery in PLL Season 2,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,1103,"['season', '1', 'finale', 'Ian', 'bell', 'tower', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'more', 'mystery', 'unraveling', 'season', '2', 'story', 'A', 'antics', 'causing', 'rifts', 'girls', 'family', 'significant', 'others', 'definitely', 'found', 'season', 'creepier', 'last', 'scenes', 'haunted', 'house', 'murky', 'lake', 'doll', 'hospital', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'girls', 'always', 'threatening', 'release', 'secret', 'damage', 'relationship', 'everyone', 'suspicion', 'identity', 'A', 'finally', 'revealed', 'season', 'finale', 'took', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'season', 'only', 'felt', 'mystery', 'was', 'spiraling', 'control', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'suspected', 'characters', 'where', 'were', 'different', 'times', 'how', 'relate', 'back', 'clues', 'also', 'seemed', 'many', 'arguments', 'central', 'characters', 'have', 'parents', 'loved', 'ones', 'continually', 'repeat', 'point', 'exhaustion', ""'m"", 'still', 'excited', 'start', 'third', 'season', 'hope', 'see', 'fresh', 'least', 'clarity', 'many', 'characters']",Pretty Little Liars:S2 (DVD)

A is back and causing trouble for our pretty little liars, and A isn't plAying any games. A targets each of the pretty little liars, and has a special plan for them. The closer Aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna gets to A, the more A turns up the heat. However, A isn't all the PLL's have to worry about.  Hanna has family issues she has to deal with, Aria has some extra credit smooches with someone (and if you've seen season 1, you know who it is) and A tries to expose it., Emily has to deal with a person she loves, and Spencer learns some dark secrets from her family's past. People aren't who they seem to be or aren't really who they say the are.  The PLL's are determined to corner A and have A reveAled, the problem is that A is waiting from them.The PLL's also dig deep into Allison's disappearance in hopes to find out what happened to her. The problem is they get too close and A is pulling certain strings and sets out breadcrumbs for our PLL's to follow, and they follow like good little ducks, and falling into A's trap.This season is a lot darker than the first one, and that's what I love about it. My favorite episode is the second to last. Honestly, it gave me the creeps, and that's not easy to do. Wait to you hear the line, ""Follow me and end  up like me.""This show has a lot of plot twits and turns that you can't help get addicted too.  It's just so much fun seeing A do certain things, and we can sit back and enjoy what happens.If you've read the books, or have seen season 1, then you know what to expect, and you won't be disAppointed.  I know I wasn't.  You can purchase this on June 5th, the same day as Season 3 starts, and when the next book in the series, Stunning, comes out.This is A's world, and we just live in it.",5,"A is bAck, better then ever.",1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,1835,"['Ah', 'friends', 'A', 'bAck', 'better', 'then', 'ever', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'season', '1', 'back', 'causing', 'trouble', 'pretty', 'little', 'liars', 'A', ""n't"", 'plAying', 'games', 'targets', 'pretty', 'little', 'liars', 'special', 'plan', 'closer', 'Aria', 'Spencer', 'Emily', 'Hanna', 'A', 'more', 'up', 'heat', 'However', 'A', ""n't"", 'PLL', 'have', 'worry', 'about', 'Hanna', 'family', 'issues', 'deal', 'Aria', 'extra', 'credit', 'smooches', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'season', '1', 'know', 'who', 'A', 'tries', 'expose', 'it.', 'Emily', 'deal', 'person', 'Spencer', 'dark', 'secrets', 'family', 'past', 'People', 'are', ""n't"", 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'PLL', 'are', 'determined', 'corner', 'A', 'have', 'A', 'reveAled', 'problem', 'A', 'waiting', 'them.The', 'PLL', 'also', 'dig', 'deep', 'Allison', 'disappearance', 'hopes', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'problem', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'A', 'pulling', 'certain', 'strings', 'sets', 'out', 'breadcrumbs', 'PLL', 'follow', 'follow', 'good', 'little', 'ducks', 'falling', 'A', 'trap.This', 'season', 'lot', 'darker', 'first', 'one', 'what', 'love', 'My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'second', 'last', 'Honestly', 'gave', 'creeps', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'Wait', 'hear', 'line', 'end', 'up', 'show', 'lot', 'plot', 'twits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'addicted', 'too', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'seeing', 'A', 'do', 'certain', 'things', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'what', 'happens.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'have', 'seen', 'season', '1', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disAppointed', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'can', 'purchase', 'June', '5th', 'same', 'day', 'Season', '3', 'starts', 'when', 'next', 'book', 'series', 'Stunning', 'out.This', ""'s"", 'world', 'just', 'live']",Pretty Little Liars:S2 (DVD)
