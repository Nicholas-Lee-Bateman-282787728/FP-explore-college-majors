This season has Don Notts starring in one wild comedy show that is a must see.,5,Great show,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,172,"['must', 'own', 'show', 'love', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'only', 'downside', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'seasons', 'season', 'Don', 'Notts', 'starring', 'one', 'wild', 'comedy', 'show', 'must', 'see']",Bill Cosby Show: Season 2

I like the show I didn't know he starred in another show before doing his best show of all time (The Cosby Show). Since I wasn't around then when The Bill Cosby Show was aired. I happen to stumble across it on amazon when looking for another show. I thought this show was very good as well, and can't wait to order the final season of The Bill Cosby Show and see how Chet is and what else he gets into; Ohh Lawd, lol.",4,Its Cosby at his best,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,492,"['Cosby', 'best', 'time', 'era', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'starred', 'show', 'doing', 'best', 'show', 'time', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'then', 'when', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'aired', 'happen', 'stumble', 'amazon', 'when', 'looking', 'show', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'order', 'final', 'season', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'see', 'how', 'Chet', 'what', 'else', 'Ohh', 'Lawd', 'lol']",Bill Cosby Show: Season 2
1048877,A1H1BUM6QZ4ROZ,B000MQ4WN8,Trevor William Douglas,"[7, 9]","I waited five years to get season two. When season one arrived back in 2006, I watched every episode through the week and enjoyed all of them. The series is filmed beautifully and the prints are exceptional. SHOUT has done a remarkable job on this series and the extras with Bill are very informative. The guest stars are amazing and the plots always unique. I like the idea of a sitcom with no laugh track. Bill was wise to film it that way. It is refreshing to watch a show like this being released by a reliable company such as SHOUT.Add both to your collection today.Now if only SHOUT would release My World And Welcome To It (1969) William Windom and  The Girl With Something Extra (1973) Sally Field, John Davidson, William Windom, my life would be complete!",5,Very Entertaining Cosby Classic,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,764,"['waited', 'five', 'years', 'get', 'season', 'two', 'When', 'season', 'one', 'arrived', 'back', '2006', 'watched', 'episode', 'week', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'prints', 'are', 'exceptional', 'SHOUT', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'series', 'extras', 'Bill', 'are', 'very', 'informative', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'amazing', 'plots', 'always', 'unique', 'like', 'idea', 'sitcom', 'laugh', 'track', 'Bill', 'was', 'wise', 'film', 'way', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'show', 'being', 'released', 'reliable', 'company', 'such', 'SHOUT.Add', 'collection', 'today.Now', 'only', 'SHOUT', 'would', 'release', 'My', 'World', 'Welcome', '1969', 'William', 'Windom', 'Girl', 'Something', 'Extra', '1973', 'Sally', 'Field', 'John', 'Davidson', 'William', 'Windom', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'complete']",Bill Cosby Show: Season 2
