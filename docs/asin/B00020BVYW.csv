You would have survival gear in your plane (even though it was summer, wouldn't you have the basics?).  You'd have heard tales of other pilots going down, getting lost, etc. and would've been prepared.  The movie showed this guy as an arrogant bird-brain with the survival skills of a bank teller from downtown Peoria.

A cynical, crude young pilot develops an attachment for the young Inuit woman he is with when his plane crashes and he is attempting to get back to his world.  But during this time he is in her world.That this attachment develops, and that he eventually develops humility, and deep affection for his companion is no surprise.  Either is it a surprise to find that this young woman knows how to survive in this desolate land.The issue that got my attention is the comparison between the society of these indigenous people vs. our society.  For millennia, these Inuits have lived the same way, and their contact with other civilizations appears minimal.  Their hope seems to be to maintain their existence and to pass on this same existence to those that come after them.On the other hand, Westerners, in general, are always trying to make changes in their lives, in what they leave for the next generations.  We are never satisfied to live the same life as our fathers, and we make every attempt to progress to something better.  We believe in progress.  Whether by choice or by chance, these primitive peoples apparently do not.So, which life is more rewarding?  They know who their Gods are and what they want of them.  They know where their Gods live, and they know where their people go when they die.  There is a certainty in their lives that we, with all our  sophistication, and with all of our yearning for progress do not have.What is better?  I am a Westerner, and I would prefer the life I see around me, with all of its uncertainties and cruelty of people to each other.  But I can just as well understand the other side.

819655,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B00020BVYW,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[4, 5]","After adding a film about Native Americans to my shopping cart, ""The Snow Walker"" frequently showed up as a recommended movie for me to purchase.  I finally took a look at the description, but was hesitant to buy it (it was not available here in Helena for rent) as it did not sound like it really was about Native Americans, based upon the description and reviews.  None-the-less, I decided to buy the film based upon the praise for it, and I am so very glad that I did.  Let me state for the record, that if I had understood that the story was an adaptation of another book by Farley Mowat, author of book for which the film ""Never Cry Wolf"" was based upon, I would have been much quicker to purchase this movie.Barry Pepper, as Charlie Halliday, gives a very powerful and endearing performance; with one exception.  While the language of his character's bigotry was included--but clearly diluted for the film--Barry Pepper's personality (and performance, perhaps) just did not fit the role.  That is, Pepper just did not act like a hard core bigot that the role called for.  As such, his ""transformation"" in the film was less powerful than I suspect was the case in the book.  Regardless of the potency of Charlie Halliday's bigotry, Barry Pepper excelled in portraying the character's other traits.  ""New comer"" Annabella Piugattuk, as Kanaalaq, the Native woman that Halliday interacts with (and learns to become a ""Snow Walker"" from), is absolutely perfect in her performance--I hope we will see more of her in the future.As for being categorized as a ""Native American"" film, ""The Snow Walker"" is not about Native Americans; it is about two individuals from two different cultures, whose lives become interdependent by circumstances of life.  Through Barry's character, we learn a little bit about the type of person who ""runs away to the bush"" with minimal survival skills.  Through Annabelle's character we learn a little bit about an Inuit woman who is trying ""to live through"" a disease for which her body has limited inherited immunity to protect her from it.  The movie is about a man's tenacity to survive the ""wilderness"" after surviving World War II; about his ego and ultimate surrender of that ego to survive.  It is about a woman steeped in understanding life in the ""wilderness,"" having lived there her entire life; about her reticence and ultimate decision to share her knowledge and skills to survive.  To a lesser degree, the film is a metaphor for Native-Non Native culture interactions, and what potential could be had if both could ""surrender"" and learn.The primary drawback (like that for ""Never Cry Wolf"") to ""The Snow Walker,"" from my perspective, is that the topic is one that has limited appeal for viewers.  And unlike ""Never Cry Wolf"" that appealed to (and was essentially promoted to) children, ""The Snow Walker"" is geared towards an adult audience, and relies much more upon characters and drama.  To that end, ""The Snow Walker"" is wonderfully brilliant.  Like so many Canadian films, ""The Snow Walker"" deserves greater world wide recognition.If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

819656,A67NO0TFRCNK1,B00020BVYW,Dr Tathata,"[2, 2]","This surprising and startling film should not be forgotten. In a way it encapsulates much of what is wrong with the way that modern people view traditional societies, and their wisdom, what they have to offer that the modern world seems to have forgotten. It is also a film about the potential for personal transformation and growth in character, and the lengths that some must go to in order to be shed of their paradigm bound, wrong minded views. Those views are stripped away, one by one, and turned upside down, for the main character, a cocky and callow bush pilot who is a long way from home. After crashing his plane in the wilderness, he seems to little grasp the situation in which he finds himself, preferring to sit around and wait for rescue while the sick Inuit woman he has agreed to transport for medical treatment attempts to prepare for survival in an unforgiving landscape. Her people have made their lives here since the last ice age. She knows something about survival. She has skills. Once he finally realizes that nobody is coming for them, he abandons her, with a little food, assuming he has a better chance without her. Now, his real education begins. He quickly injures himself, becomes lost, eaten by insects, he is on the verge of death from exposure then the young woman, who has tracked him down, nurses him back to health, and with her dying strength, outfits him with the traditional clothing and skills that he will need to make it back to civilization. This is a profoundly poignant and deeply touching film that serves as a reminder for those who are quick to judge others on the basis of their own prejudice.  When he finally makes it back, I would be willing to bet that he would forever regard the episode as life changing, and the woman he initially dismissed as nothing more than a sick Indian, and a worthless burden, to be his savior and teacher. How different would his life have been had he successfully landed the plane in Yellow Knife and dumped her at the hospital. By crashing his plane in the Arctic tundra, he was given a chance for a kind of death and rebirth. He crash landed at the edge of the abyss and walked back to life.The story of a 'civilized man' becoming enmeshed in traditional tribal societies who is transformed by the encounter is an old, old literary trope--that it keeps eternally springing up is a testament to not only the romantic appeal of the notion, but the instinctive recognition that something is missing from modern realities that was part and parcel of the archaic human predicament, and that dialogue between the new and the primordial worlds is necessary for moderns to realize the extent to which their wholeness has been compromised by imported strawberries in January, by jet planes and wireless communication. In the civilized world everything is dependent on everything else--pull one linchpin, and the systems collapse. But the original situation involved small bands of people working together to scrape the resources out of the local environment on a daily basis, through their own skill and ingenuity. The closest thing to a stock market crash on the great tundra was a herd of caribou running away after an unsuccessful hunt--which meant your survival, and those around you, was in your own hands, on your own merits. If you had to lie motionless in the snow for ten hours along a seal breathing hole for one chance at a strike with the harpoon you made with your own hands--or go home to starving children, so be it. The ease of civilized life, and the interdependency of those systems, obscures some of these basic, original realities, and robs us of the pleasure of the confidence of knowing that we live day to day through the skill and perseverance of our own heart by our own hand. Could YOU make a kayak out of seal skins and whale bones and then push off onto arctic seas to kill a whale with a bone spear tip? Could you track a polar bear across the frozen ice for days on end and carry its hide and its meat home to your wife and children, armed only with a coiled sliver of bone? Think about it.

819657,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,B00020BVYW,D. Scott,"[0, 0]","I added The Snow Walker to my watchlist because I like ""man-against-the-elements"" films.  And this film does indeed show many of the survival challenges one might face in the Arctic tundra, including several that I hadn't thought about, such as immense clouds of mosquitoes and quicksand-like mud.  So it was very satisfying from that perspective.  There are no cliche wolf or polar bear attacks, just the quiet, ever-present challenge of the environment itself.But the film illustrates much more than just the skilled Inuit woman saving and changing the views of the racist pilot with her.  Initially, he was attempting to act as her savior by flying her to medical facilities, but he was very reluctant, and his motivations were entirely mercenary.  Then she has to save him, and he comes to appreciate her skill.  Then the camaraderie builds between them, and they become collaborative in their efforts, both of them better off for being together.  Finally, as she grows progressively more frail, he once again steps in to try to rescue her, but this time, his intentions are completely honorable.  He no longer needs her from a survival standpoint, but he is desperate to save her because he has developed feelings for her.  However, the film is very tasteful and low-key in this area.  There are no love scenes (not even kissing), and it is not even clear if his feelings are romantic.

This CANADIAN made movie (shot in Manitoba, NWT, and BC) has shot to the top of my favorite list.  Everyone I show it too is stunned by the terrific cast, photography, and outstanding story (quality A1).Berry Pepper (I did not know any of the cast before) is absolutely outstanding.  Annabelle Piugattuk (has so much chemistry with the media...film) it hits the viewer hard; there is something about her that extremely likeable (same for Berry); the the two work together in a wonderful way (so rare).I know that the storyline looks tough to take (winter, cold) but I guarantee that this one will delight.  The Pilot is essentially reborn, or transformed, by his experience.  Men will like Barry's performance as it is not at all mush ... tough and believable.After watching it about 3 times, some noteworthy things.  The Owl, I think symbolizes someone watching (the girl?); the pilot's flashbacks to the war; the last flashback hits me so hard; don't know why but I just well up now with the change that occurs in it (what does the Raven mean?).  The message I think is that &quot;we are not alone&quot;. Feminists will love it of course, Annabella is something like 4'8&quot; tall and amazes all.  Again, the sight of her makes me well up ... maybe I'm just an emotional wreck these days.The Director is Charles Martin Smith -- from The Untouchables, or American Graffitti (the one that got so sick from drinking).Oh, if you have Home Theatre Speakers the talk with the Raven (I think it is a Raven) will sound awesome on your speakers .. it was cool in the theatre).So buy this DVD; outstanding!!!",5,Absolutely Outstanding ...

When Charlie glides into the Inuit tribe he reluctantly agrees to transport an ailing Inuit girl Kanaalaq (Annabella Piugattuk) to a hospital. Once airborne the plane encounters a storm and, losing an engine, the plane crashes.  Charlie is enraged: Kanaalaq is stoic.  Charlie speaks no Inuit: Kanaalaq speaks only a little English,  The story is how the hotheaded, arrogant Charlie shakes his fist at the elements and makes futile attempts to contact the outside world, while the (?) tubercular Kanaalaq quietly goes about incorporating her instinctive tools of survival.  Slowly Charlie and Kanaalaq bond in a mutual dependency and Charlie softens his psyche in response to Kanaalaq's creative and ingenious manner of melding with nature in a oneness that is deeply touching.Director Charles Martin Smith displays great reverence to the natural phenomena of the Arctic circle by incorporating vista shots and architecturally perfect picture framing of two souls pitted against the trials of survival.  Massive mosquito swarm attacks, the treeless wastelands, the magnificence of the aurora borealis, sunsets unhindered by man's contamination - all of these enhance this tale of the collision of two cultures and the realm of mutual honor that can result in times of challenge.  Both Pepper and Piugattuk give exceptional performances allowing the slow metamorphosis of character revelation to seem utterly natural.There is much to admire in this small Canadian film, in concept, direction, production, acting and, most of all, in message.  Highly recommended for all audiences.

819688,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00020BVYW,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[10, 13]","""The Snow Walker"" is based on a short story by Canadian author Farley Mowat, ""Walk Well My Brother."" Charles Martin Smith, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film, is also an actor, (Terry ""The Toad"" Fields in ""American Graffiti""), and starred in another Mowat adaptation, ""Never Cry Wolf.""Mowat is one of the only writers I know who is able to capture and communicate the essence of life in the Arctic wilderness. Barry Lopez is another. This beautiful, haunting movie evokes the ways of the Inuit peoples of the Canadian Arctic, illustrating how human beings are capable of living in harmony with their environment, and of creating honorable societies. Farley Mowat writes of survival and courage, of superstition and destiny, of loyalty to family and tribe in an isolated, untamed, often brutal land. ""The Snow Walker"" truly captures these themes, as well as the visual magnificence of northern Canada's panorama - the majesty of her vast snowy plains, the monotony of the tundra, thousands of sparkling watery inlets, the extraordinary quality of light, and the variety of wildlife. Cinematographers David Connell, Jon Joffin and Paul Sarossy did a fantastic job. The photography is especially memorable during a misty morning caribou hunt.""The Snow Walker"" is set in the Canadian Northwest Territories, near the Arctic Ocean's Queen Maud Gulf during the summer/autumn of 1953. Arrogant bush pilot, Charlie Halliday, (Barry Pepper), flies supplies and people around the Arctic, and occasionally makes some extra money selling pelts and ivory which he gets from the indigenous population. He exploits the Inuit's shamelessly, without wasting a moment's thought, trading them chocolate and Coca-Cola for their valuable goods. Halliday is a WWII veteran, an angry young man, who apparently still suffers nightmares from the horrors he experienced serving as a bomber pilot over Germany. He's handsome in a macho way, with his chiseled features and cocky manner. Women flock to him and he is out for a good time, not much more.On a routine flight ferrying cargo, he picks up a sick Inuit woman named Kanaalaq, (Annabella Piugattuk), agreeing to take her to a hospital in return for two ivory walrus tusks, offered as payment by her family. He refuses to transport her for free, even though she is visibly suffering from tuberculoses. On the plane trip back to the air base in Yellowknife, serious engine problems occur and the plane crashes. Charlie and Kanaalaq are badly shaken but not really harmed - however, they are stranded in the middle of an immense, desolate wilderness.Charlie foolishly leaves his plane and the woman, promising, in sign language, to return with help when he reaches the nearest town. He attempts to trek over 200 miles in an old pair of boots, and collapses after a downpour which results in the hatching of millions of mosquitoes who all want to drink his blood. Predictably, Kanaalaq rescues him and proves to be more resilient than she looks,  in spite of her deteriorating condition. She teaches him survival skills, and they attempt to learn each other's languages. The story chronicles the growing friendship between the two, as autumn closes in, bringing the danger of freezing temperatures and blizzards.The story of man's survival in the wild is an old one, but ""The Snow Walker"" is filmed in a fresh way and is extremely effective as a drama. The performance of first time actress Annabella Piugattuk is amazing. She is able to communicate so much with her expressive face and eyes, a few words in English, and her own language, Inuktitut. Barry Pepper is superb as Charlie - really perfect casting. James Cromwell plays Charlie's boss who hates to give up on the search for his ""best pilot,"" and buddy. There are some slow moments, however, when the scene switches from wilderness to the worried friends back in Yellowknife.I am partial to anything that has to do with the Arctic, but this is an exceptional and poignant film. Author Barry Lopez believes that ""natural landscapes are capable of bestowing a grace upon those who pass through them."" Certainly Charlie Halliday is transformed.

819730,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00020BVYW,Lawyeraau,"[0, 1]","This wonderful film is based upon the short story, ""Walk Well, My Brother"", which appears in an anthology of short stories titled, ""The Snow Walker"", written by Canadian icon, Farley Mowat. The story takes place somewhere near the Artic in 1953 and opens with a shadowy figure traipsing slowly across a frozen wasteland. The film then flashes back to a time three months earlier in a settlement called ""Yellow Knife"", located somewhere in the Northwest Territories of Canada.  A raucous sort of place, the viewer is introduced to a young and  handsome, former World War II fighter pilot named Charles Halliday (Barry Pepper). He is a free living, arrogant, hot dogging young gun, who now flies over the frozen wastelands of the far north, working as a bush pilot for a man named Shepherd (James Cromwell).While making a routine delivery in a desolate area, he is met by a small family of Inuit with a seemingly tubercular daughter (Annabella Piugattuk)) who clearly needs medical attention. They request that Johnny take her to the hospital in Yellow Knife but Johnny refuses to do so. When they bribe him with some valuable ivory tusks, he has a change of heart, taking the young woman on board.  Unfortunately, the small aircraft experiences technical difficulties, and they crash in the frozen tundra, a couple of hundred miles from civilization, but are physically relatively unhurt by the crash.Thinking that he would do better on his own, Charlie divests himself of the young woman, leaving her with some supplies but believing that he is consigning her to her death. He is a young man with little respect for the Inuit people. He simply does not see the value in their culture, which he does not understand, and marches off into the bleak wilderness on his own. He, who is a whiz with machinery, has little knowledge on how to survive in that bleak but beautiful wasteland. Consequently,  by the time he is about a week into his trek through this unforgiving tundra, he is overcome by nature and the vicissitudes of this harsh and alien environment.  Fortunately for him, the young woman he left behind is far more resourceful than he is. She catches up with him, finding him on the brink of death, and nurses him back to life,  becoming the key to his survival.It is only after all this happens that he bothers to learn that she is called Kanaalaq. Slowly, he learns to connect with this young woman in a way that he has never connected with anyone. He learns to appreciate her, discovering that she is beautiful both inside and out. Through his relationship with Kanaalaq, whom he begins to regard as a little sister, he learns how to love another human being, becoming reborn as a better person in the process. He also learns to connect to the land and, in doing so, finds the strength to survive his ordeal. Kanaalaq ends up giving Charlie Halliday the gift of life.What happens to Charlie and Kanaalaq, how they manage, and how their relationship develops is at the heart of this  film. It is the story of two cultures that  come together and seamlessly mesh in order to survive out on the frozen tundra.  It is an intensely moving and deeply personal film that is simply beautiful. With a minimum of dialogue, this film sends out a major message.Barry Pepper is terrific in the role of Charlie Halliday, a flawed human being who manages to overcome his shortcomings and become all the better for his ordeal. He infuses the character with a certain charisma, so that when his shortcomings become apparent, the viewer does not dislike him but, rather, hopes that he will see the error of his ways and find redemption. Newcomer Annabella Piugattuk is simply sensational, giving a well-nuanced and very touching performance in the role of the dying Inuit girl, Kanaalaq. Her role is central to the film, and she is a breakout star. They searched for six months, until they found her, having auditioned hundreds of young women in the process, as they were looking for someone indigenous to the area to fill the female lead. The casting director discovered her at a local teen dance in the Northwest Territories, and what a find she is.This Canadian production was the recipient of numerous Genie nominations, which are the Canadian equivalent of Academy Award nominations, and  are conferred by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television. I have to say that, in recent years,  I have been mightily impressed with the originality, quality, and sophistication of Canadian films. They are sometimes simply the best films to be found. This one is no exception. Deftly directed by Charles Martin Smith, who is also an actor, he  fully understands the concept that less is oftentimes more and exacts powerful performances from the entire cast. Moreover, he perfectly captures the majesty, beauty, and sheer bleakness of the landscape that acts as the backdrop for this beautiful story.

Set in 1953 in northern Canada, a bush pilot, played by Barry Pepper, agrees to fly a seriously ill young Inuit woman, who seems to have tuberculosis, to a town where she can get medical attention. He's reluctant to do this but her family bribes him with a pair of walrus tusks.  Played by first-time actress Annabella Piugattuk, this Intuit woman is outstanding in her role, as she helps the pilot to survive after their plane crashes and also teaches him some valuable lessons about life.Yes, this is a hackneyed story with no real surprises.  But under the expert hand of writer/director Charles Martin Smith, the film comes out better than the sum of its parts.  I found myself completely drawn in and also learned a lot about survival in the frozen north.  I applaud the director's decision to use an authentic Inuit actress in the main role which made the film seem real.  It was well-paced with just enough tension to keep me wondering what would happen next.This is a fine film and I definitely recommend it.

Annabella Piugattuk is simply incredible in the role of the seriously ill woman that needs immediate medical attention. But on their way to another location, the plane suffers mechanical problems and they crash in the vast arctic wastes of the distant north.The scenery is authentic looking, the perils faced as the pilot sets out on foot for a settlement some 100 miles away considerable. Having left the young woman behind at the crash site, he is ill-equipped to survive the long walk. He ends up near death, saved by the skills of the Inuit woman who has followed him. She nurses him until his strength returns and here is where the logic problem arises.The pilot figures he has walked 5 days at between 15 to 20 miles per day. Figuring on the low side, he would now be between 20 to 25 miles away from the settlement and rescue. Instead, he decides to return the 75 to 80 miles back to the crash site because he heard a plane overhead and believes that searchers likely found their crashed plane. Lemme see now, which makes more sense... 20 to 25 miles to the settlement... or 75 to 80 miles back to the crash on the possibility searchers might have discovered the location? Which would be logical or intelligent.The answer is obvious to this bleeding idiot, who returns to the plane crash, only to discover that nobody has located the wreck! Great! Now he is once again 100 miles from safety rather than 20 to 25 from the settlement that he was when the Inuit woman found him! Meanwhile, she is getting sicker by the day, and the pilot learns from her and develops an appreciation and respect for her culture.Once the learn that nobody has discovered the crashed plane, the pilot throws a snit for several weeks, staying holed up in the wreck. Eventually they start walking toward the settlement again, while she becomes incapactiated by tuberculosis. Brilliant.This is a wonderful movie, with fantastic landscapes and a wild environment that should make this a compelling and marvelous addition to your DVD collection. Except that the illogic displayed ruin the artistic value that was invested into the project.I enjoyed the movie to the very last few minutes, when the outcome became clear, and left me simply furious. Perhaps I have a Pollyanna view of the world, but I cling to the hope, the abiding belief, that nobody can truly be that stupid. Why would someone walk 75 to 80 miles across some of the most hostile wilderness known to man, and being within 20 to 25 miles of safety and rescue, decide to retrace his steps back to the original crash site.It simply does not make any sense whatsoever, and ruined an otherwise totally brilliant film!",3,"Great Film, Flawed Logic",1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,2798,"['beautiful', 'movie', 'starring', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'bush', 'pilot', 'veteran', 'war', 'who', 'take', 'young', 'Inuit', 'woman', 'Yellow', 'Knife', 'Annabella', 'Piugattuk', 'simply', 'incredible', 'role', 'seriously', 'ill', 'woman', 'immediate', 'medical', 'attention', 'way', 'location', 'plane', 'suffers', 'mechanical', 'problems', 'crash', 'vast', 'arctic', 'wastes', 'distant', 'north.The', 'scenery', 'authentic', 'looking', 'perils', 'faced', 'pilot', 'out', 'foot', 'settlement', '100', 'miles', 'away', 'considerable', 'Having', 'left', 'young', 'woman', 'crash', 'site', 'ill-equipped', 'survive', 'long', 'walk', 'up', 'near', 'death', 'saved', 'skills', 'Inuit', 'woman', 'who', 'followed', 'strength', 'returns', 'here', 'where', 'logic', 'problem', 'arises.The', 'pilot', 'figures', 'walked', '5', 'days', '15', '20', 'miles', 'day', 'Figuring', 'low', 'side', 'would', 'now', 'be', '20', '25', 'miles', 'away', 'settlement', 'rescue', 'Instead', 'return', '75', '80', 'miles', 'back', 'crash', 'site', 'heard', 'plane', 'overhead', 'searchers', 'likely', 'found', 'crashed', 'plane', 'Lem', 'see', 'now', 'more', 'sense', '20', '25', 'miles', 'settlement', '75', '80', 'miles', 'back', 'crash', 'possibility', 'searchers', 'might', 'have', 'discovered', 'location', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'logical', 'intelligent.The', 'answer', 'obvious', 'bleeding', 'idiot', 'who', 'plane', 'crash', 'only', 'discover', 'nobody', 'located', 'wreck', 'Great', 'Now', 'once', 'again', '100', 'miles', 'safety', 'rather', '20', '25', 'settlement', 'was', 'when', 'Inuit', 'woman', 'found', 'Meanwhile', 'getting', 'sicker', 'day', 'pilot', 'appreciation', 'respect', 'culture.Once', 'learn', 'nobody', 'discovered', 'crashed', 'plane', 'pilot', 'snit', 'several', 'weeks', 'staying', 'holed', 'up', 'wreck', 'Eventually', 'start', 'walking', 'settlement', 'again', 'incapactiated', 'tuberculosis', 'Brilliant.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'landscapes', 'wild', 'environment', 'should', 'make', 'compelling', 'marvelous', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'illogic', 'displayed', 'ruin', 'artistic', 'value', 'was', 'invested', 'project.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'when', 'outcome', 'became', 'clear', 'left', 'simply', 'furious', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'Pollyanna', 'view', 'world', 'cling', 'hope', 'abiding', 'belief', 'nobody', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'stupid', 'Why', 'would', 'someone', 'walk', '75', '80', 'miles', 'most', 'hostile', 'wilderness', 'known', 'man', 'being', '20', '25', 'miles', 'safety', 'rescue', 'decide', 'retrace', 'steps', 'back', 'original', 'crash', 'site.It', 'simply', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'ruined', 'otherwise', 'totally', 'brilliant', 'film']",The Snow Walker

819770,A2Z1TPSSZHN5BB,B00020BVYW,N.,"[4, 6]","Quick plot review: arrogant Euro-Canadian pilot learns survival and life skills from ailing but industrious Inuit woman when they are stranded on the tundra.The Snow Walker starts out a bit shakily, with several actors including Barry Pepper awkwardly delivering their lines. I didn't buy Pepper's portrayal of the cocksure bush pilot with the anger management problem; several of his emotional blow-ups seemed faintly ridiculous and self-consciously ""acted."" But Pepper improves dramatically as his character softens and matures in response to the ministrations of Kanaalaq (solidly played by lively newcomer Annabella Piuggatuk). Thankfully, there is no disturbingly neo-colonialist Captain John Smith-Pocahontas love match to distract from the power of the fraternal relationship that does spring up between this Euro-Canadian man and Inuit woman (fraternal relationships in general are too often given short shrift in movies). The miming-charades style of communication between these two was sometimes rendered puzzling when Kanaalaq would later jump in with the English translation she knew along.The biggest miss-steps in my opinion were the contrived girlfriend (""Estelle"") storyline--again, as though the writers felt the audience needs that romantic connection to feel grief over the situation--and the related ""search and rescue"" drama of the gung-ho young searcher and his caustic co-pilot. James Cromwell was sadly wasted in a very minor role; much as I hate to say it, they could have done away with his part altogether. Also, it's important to keep in mind that this movie (and its source material by Farley Mowat) does nothing to remedy the unfortunately common film convention of the European (often, but not always male) aided in survival and general ""life skills"" by willing Native...***SEMI-SPOILER...who becomes means of European's redemption before meeting an untimely/tragic end.*****SEMI-SPOILER OVER***But these are minor quibbles in a movie with a simple but time-tested and effective ""survival"" storyline (come on, we're always riveted by those), the well-filmed and stark beauty of the tundra, and the Mychael Danna score (not among his best, but still evocative).

Marsh,"[0, 0]","The Snow Walker focuses on two characters: a bush pilot named Charles Halliday (played by Barry Pepper) and a young Inuit woman named Kanaalaq (played by Annabella Piugattuk).  It is 1953.  Halliday makes a stop with his float plane in a remote northern area when he comes across some Inuit who convince him to take Kanaalaq on board for the purpose of flying her to a hospital in Yellowknife.  She is apparently suffering from tuberculosis or a similar illness.  The plane crashes en route however and the two find themselves far from human civilization.  Halliday is distraught from the loss of his plane but still tries his best to get help for the two of them.  He soon learns however that he is the student and his companion is the teacher when it comes to the subject of survival.The dialogue is simple but moving as the two main characters begin to open up with each other.  There is an exchange of cultures that takes place and I dare say that Charlie has the most to gain.  Kanaalaq speaks little English but what she says; what she shares with Charlie resonates with him and warms his soul.  She is quiet but sure.The images/cinematography throughout the film are gorgeous.It is ironic that Charles Martin Smith directed this beautiful film about survival in the artic as he was the main character in Never Cry Wolf, another masterpiece set in the north.My only disappointment with the product is that there are no English subtitles for those hard of hearing.

Outwardly boisterous, inwardly wounded, he flies the NW territories to pass the time and pay the bills, and if he 'sees' the local Eskimos at all, its as a profit-making opportunity.  Since he is spiritually stranded, once he is stranded for real, would he think twice of abandoning her to 'find help'?  In a part of his mind, we are all abandoned, or, as another character relates, we are 'all alone in this world'.But what motivates her?  Time and time again, this young Inuit, gravely stricken with tuberculosis, appears by his side to rescue him from his own folly.  Why?  This morose invalid doesn't start the film in a promising way, yet we see a woman transformed by the opportunity to care.  This woman has trained her whole life to be someone's wife, her hero was her mother.  Cruelly, TB has apparently robbed her of her mission.  Yet, the plane-wreck that strands them represents a chance to put into practice her short lifetime of training.  Will he let her?  In the 'real world', his friends search for him.  But, like him, they are hobbled by a modern attitude of 'we're all alone in this world' that repeatedly makes their efforts fall short of rescue.  Will her more traditional attitude make the difference?The good woman fishes, she catches small game, and she sews, and sews, and sews.  Her heroism is completely traditional, it's poignancy informed by her illness.  Her reverence for the dead is also fully formed and uncompromising.  If it came to it, she would give her lifes-blood for her loved ones.  And she would never abandon another person, unless...In the frozen Arctic wilderness, abandonment lies just outside your door.  As her mother taught her, if she should ever go there, it would not be for herself.This is a great Farley Mowat story that translates perfectly to the film.

Zwick,"[11, 18]","***1/2Sort of a cross between ""Flight of the Phoenix"" and ""Nanook of the North,"" ""The Snow Walker"" tells the true story of Charles Martin Smith, a bush pilot in 1935 who crash landed his plane on the Canadian tundra with a seriously ill Inuit woman as his sole passenger (he reluctantly picked her up at a remote camp, agreeing to fly her to a hospital for treatment).  Stranded in the middle of nowhere, miles away from the nearest town or human settlement and with little or no hope of ever being rescued, the two struggled for survival against both the elements and the disease that continually threatened to take the woman's life.Smith is presented to us at the outset as a cocky, self-assured young man who feels, as a white man, innately superior to the natives who inhabit this far northern region of the globe.  It isn't until he is forced to rely on the instinctive cunning and acquired wisdom of this young Eskimo woman that he comes to understand and appreciate the beauty and majesty of her people in their oneness with nature.What starts off as a decent little tale of survival soon blossoms into a touching love story between two people from totally different worlds who connect at the very deepest levels of bonded commitment and mutual self-reliance.  Despite the fact that Kaanalaq can barely speak a word of English and Smith not a word of Inuit, the two of them learn to communicate almost entirely through expression and gesture, coming to a shared understanding of the other's worth as a human being.  Barry Pepper and newcomer Annabella Piugattuk achieve a real rapport as the unlikely lovers thrown together by a capricious, perhaps even cruel, but certainly life-altering trick of fate.  There are also fine performances from Kiersten Warren, James Cromwell and Jon Gries as just some of the people back at the base fretting over Smith's unexplained disappearance.""The Snow Walker"" makes full use of its unusual setting, showing us how harsh and unforgiving nature can be to humans who happen to wander into the most remote regions of this immense planet.

Covering only three months of time in 1953, the film follows the transformation of an arrogant and impulsive young pilot into a man of compassion, courage, and a native-inspired resourcefulness.The story is simple: a white man and an ill Inuit woman he has agreed to fly to a hospital are stranded on the trackless tundra when his plane crashes. Hundreds of miles from the nearest settlement, they wait for rescue that never comes. The short Arctic summer ends and winter looms as they face their dilemma separately and then together.The photography is stunning. It cries out to be seen on a big screen. The performances are wonderful, especially the 19-year-old Inuit actress, Annabella Piugattuk. Director Charles Martin Smith creates a movie experience that recalls his wonderful film, ""Never Cry Wolf."" The DVD has a high-spirited making-of-the-movie documentary which reveals much about the on-location logistics required to shoot a film under wilderness conditions, among polar bears (none of which appear in the film), and for part of the time under sub-zero conditions.

However, it is Kanalaaq who ends up saving Charlie, both physically and spiritually:  She saves his life after he collapses from exhaustion, starvation and bug bites (yes, they are that severe!) by applying traditional healing.  In one of the most powerful scenes of the movie, she heals his soul by freeing him from the trauma he suffered from his actions as a World War II fighter pilot by entering his dream and staying his hand from pulling the trigger.  She continues to transform him by teaching him the ways of her people, both physical skills such as hunting, fishing and igloo building, but also the traditions of her people, such as their views of life and death, family and brotherhood, and their connection to the land and animals.  As Kanalaaq becomes sicker, their roles reverse, as Charlie, who has now completely transformed from his original selfish nature, uses the knowledge she has taught him to care for her.In today's world in which our lives have become barren in the pursuit of toys and power, this truly inspiring movie allows us to see that change is possible. In a world filled with shallow, meaningless relationships it is incredibly uplifting to see two people grow to truly care about one another.Why not 5 stars? The movie spends too much time on unnecessary elements that have nothing to do with the main plot.  You could forward the parts of the crew looking for Charlie, Charlie's friends and girl friend grieving for him, Charlie's friends and family throwing him a funeral thinking he is dead, and not miss anything.  The side story was completely unnecessary, and took away time that could have been spent further developing the enthralling story of the two main characters.",4,"4 1/2 Stars.

He is convinced to take a young Inuit woman (Kanaalaq) to Yellow Knife to be treated for what appears to be tuberculosis.  He refuses at first to take her but when paid with ivory he decides it is not to much of an inconvenience.  As they are running to the next stop on his planned sidetrack flight to trade with natives, not his normal route, the plane crashed miles out in the tundra.  They are hundreds of miles away form civilization.Charlie being headstrong decides to strike out on his own and leave Kanaalaq behind thinking she is primitive, doesn't know what she is doing and too sick to travel.  But, Charlie quickly is overcome by the wilderness and his lack of knowledge as well as clothing almost brings the death of him. Despite her weakened condition, she follows Charlie and nurses him back to health when insects, cold and starvation threaten to kill him.  Though very sick Kanaalaq teaches Charlie the skills that he will need to survive.  This is everything from fishing, hunting and preparation of water tight footwear to winter clothing.  As they both learn how to communicate easier she also teaches him about the spirit world of the Inuit.  This is especially noticeable when they stumble upon the wrecked plane of another man who didn't survive.  Charlie starts to root through the wreckage to find things to use, while Kanaalaq builds a stone grave for him and packs the tools he will need to survive in the next life in with him.Charlie learns to respect the beliefs of others and the knowledge of those who are not ""civilized"".  He also learns how to survive and live on only what he needs to survive, and when to let nature take its course.Absolutely loved this story!  I laughed and cried.
