However, I consider myself advanced and know how to modify, so I added hand weights and jumps throughout to break a sweat. For example, there is a lot of marching between other moves, so I was jogging instead, or side-steps and I added ponies, and so on. All in all it was very easy to follow the first time through and I would consider it a fun low intermediate cardio workout.",4,Fun but not Intense enough,1227225600,"11 21, 2008",2008,464,"['fun', 'very', 'doable', 'dancey', 'workout', 'pleasant', 'instructor', 'ok', 'music', 'However', 'consider', 'advanced', 'know', 'how', 'modify', 'added', 'hand', 'weights', 'jumps', 'break', 'sweat', 'example', 'lot', 'marching', 'other', 'moves', 'was', 'jogging', 'instead', 'side-steps', 'added', 'ponies', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'first', 'time', 'would', 'consider', 'fun', 'low', 'intermediate', 'cardio', 'workout']",3 2 1 Dance

It's a little more interesting than doing just routine aerobics or walking workouts and Petra is energetic, enthusiastic and humorous, which makes things fun.  The music is not the greatest, but overall I really like the DVD.  One of the things I like best is that it's broken up into three segments so if you're short on time, you can do just one of the segments, or if you have more time, you can do two or all three.  The only negative is that it's a little hard to keep up with at first, so it takes a few times to learn the routine so you can get the most out of it.",4,Fun Workout,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,627,"['love', 'Petra', 'Kolber', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'doing', 'just', 'routine', 'aerobics', 'walking', 'workouts', 'Petra', 'energetic', 'enthusiastic', 'humorous', 'things', 'fun', 'music', 'not', 'greatest', 'overall', 'really', 'DVD', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'best', 'broken', 'up', 'three', 'segments', 'so', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'segments', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'three', 'only', 'negative', 'little', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'learn', 'routine', 'can', 'get', 'most']",3 2 1 Dance

Although getting the cues down is tricky at first, as with all of her other DVDs they come easily with practice.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the format. In order to do the whole routine you have to go back to the chapters and select which one you want to do. That takes time and a loss of concentration.  Even when you have done all 3 dance chapters and you want to do them from the top, you have to go back to the chapter menu and select that option.

I bought this a couple of weeks back and I'm really enjoying it.Petra is a great instructor.  This is about the 5th of hers I own and she's very good.  She's outgoing and encouraging and makes you have fun.  This is an easy to follow workout that will burn calories and you don't realise that you are in fact working out because you're enjoying yourself.  Each of the dance combinations start off with a basic pattern and then you build up on them.  With all the arm movements too, it makes your heart rate faster and burn heaps of fat.It's about 55 minutes all up (including warm up and cool down) and it goes really quick.  It's got great music and I can't stress enough how good this is.  It's become one of my favourite workouts and even if I don't feel like exercising, just beginning this hooks me in till it's done.  I highly recommend it to everyone.",5,Fantastic workout - don't wait for Amazon :-),1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,969,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Amazon', 'releasing', 'workout', 'dvds', 'so', 'long', 'other', 'online', 'retailers', 'have', 'stock', 'bought', 'couple', 'weeks', 'back', ""'m"", 'really', 'enjoying', 'it.Petra', 'great', 'instructor', '5th', 'hers', 'own', 'very', 'good', 'outgoing', 'encouraging', 'have', 'fun', 'easy', 'follow', 'workout', 'will', 'burn', 'calories', 'do', ""n't"", 'realise', 'are', 'fact', 'working', 'out', ""'re"", 'enjoying', 'dance', 'combinations', 'start', 'basic', 'pattern', 'then', 'build', 'up', 'arm', 'movements', 'too', 'heart', 'rate', 'faster', 'burn', 'heaps', 'fat.It', '55', 'minutes', 'up', 'including', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'really', 'quick', 'got', 'great', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'good', 'become', 'one', 'favourite', 'workouts', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'exercising', 'just', 'beginning', 'till', 'done', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",3 2 1 Dance

Received 3-2-1 as a gift, and can't remember the last time I had so much fun.  Petra calls her choreography ""doable dance"" and I found it VERY doable!  What's more, your dancing is a very cleverly disguised workout: your heart rate is elevated, you're sweating, and the next day your lower body is sore in places other forms of cardio don't access nearly as well.

1125722,A3N4ZOH7VUFH2Z,B0010QH1GE,Rina Perez,"[26, 27]","I received this yesterday [Friday] and previewed it right away. I'm not a dancer but I like dance aerobics. The steps looked complicated to me while I was watching it so today, Saturday which isn't normally a workout day for me, I tried it while taking a break from doing my household chores. I only planned to do the warm up, dance party 1 and cooldown BUT I couldn't stop and ended up doing the whole thing. Sure, I messed up a lot but I had a smile on my face the entire time. Mistakes burn calories also so just keep moving. I looked silly but it's a home workout video so who cares, nobody's watching....I REALLY ENJOYED THIS! I said to myself that I'd get it after few more tries. Time flew by; that's 50 minutes taken away from me on a busy Saturday. Right in the middle of the routine, I keep telling myself that my piles of laundry, sweeping, mopping, cleaning the bathrooms, etc....can wait. It's 'ME' time. This is one workout that I'll look forward to doing.....like how I feel when I'm going to do Turbo Jam routines. Petra cues very well; I like her a lot. The music is great [I'm from the era]. And even though I've been doing 1/2 hr workouts lately 'coz I have longer work hours, I think I'd make time for Petra after work while something is cooking in the oven and continue doing Jillian's 30-day Shred before going to work [I'll post a review on this after 30 days!]....that's my current plan and then switch back to my other videos after 4-6 weeks....To add variety in your exercise DVD collection, buy Petra's 321 dance 'coz you won't regret it.....GOODLUCK! FYI only: I'm high intermediate level who exercise 6 days/week and did I mention I'm 43 years old with a husband and 2 teenage boys.....",5,Addicting!,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1715,"['received', 'yesterday', 'Friday', ']', 'previewed', 'right', 'away', ""'m"", 'not', 'dancer', 'like', 'dance', 'aerobics', 'steps', 'looked', 'complicated', 'was', 'watching', 'so', 'today', 'Saturday', ""n't"", 'normally', 'workout', 'day', 'tried', 'taking', 'break', 'doing', 'household', 'chores', 'only', 'planned', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'dance', 'party', '1', 'cooldown', 'BUT', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'whole', 'thing', 'Sure', 'messed', 'up', 'lot', 'had', 'smile', 'face', 'entire', 'time', 'Mistakes', 'burn', 'calories', 'also', 'so', 'just', 'keep', 'moving', 'looked', 'silly', 'home', 'workout', 'video', 'who', 'nobody', 'watching', '.I', 'REALLY', 'ENJOYED', 'THIS', 'said', 'myself', ""'d"", 'get', 'few', 'more', 'tries', 'Time', 'flew', '50', 'minutes', 'taken', 'away', 'busy', 'Saturday', 'Right', 'middle', 'routine', 'keep', 'telling', 'piles', 'laundry', 'sweeping', 'mopping', 'cleaning', 'bathrooms', 'etc', '.can', 'wait', 'time', 'one', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'how', 'feel', 'when', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'Turbo', 'Jam', 'routines', 'Petra', 'very', 'well', 'like', 'lot', 'music', 'great', '[', ""'m"", 'era', ']', 'even', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', '1/2', 'hr', 'workouts', 'lately', ""'coz"", 'have', 'longer', 'work', 'hours', 'think', ""'d"", 'make', 'time', 'Petra', 'work', 'something', 'cooking', 'oven', 'continue', 'doing', 'Jillian', '30-day', 'Shred', 'going', 'work', '[', ""'ll"", 'post', 'review', '30', 'days', ']', '.that', 'current', 'plan', 'then', 'switch', 'back', 'other', 'videos', '4-6', 'weeks', '.To', 'add', 'variety', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'collection', 'buy', 'Petra', '321', 'dance', ""'coz"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'FYI', 'only', ""'m"", 'high', 'intermediate', 'level', 'who', 'exercise', '6', 'days/week', 'did', 'mention', ""'m"", '43', 'years', 'old', 'husband', '2', 'teenage', 'boys', '..']",3 2 1 Dance
1125723,A245HJ999FOPRI,B0010QH1GE,Tchik182,"[21, 21]","This DVD consists of a warm-up, 3 dance segments, and a cool down.  After you learn the 3 dance segments, you have the option of a last segment that combines all 3 dances.  The DVD motto is ""3 moves and you're dancing"" but I don't really think the 3 movements you learn in the warm-up are really a part of the dance moves presented later.  The moves are a lot of fun; however, if you're not very coordinated, you may have trouble with this DVD.  I was making lots of mistakes the first time, and it took me a couple of workouts before I got all the moves down.  Petra is enthusiastic, without being annoying.  The music is fun, and adds to the workout.  The cueing is adequate, but it could be better. There are several places where extra turns are given as options.  When turns are presented, Petra stays with the basic move, and her 2 back up dancers do the turns.Aside from the workout, Petra's back up dancers have normal bodies, which is refreshing in a workout video.If you enjoy aerobic dance videos, that are moderately challenging, I think you'll really enjoy this DVD.",5,Fun Aerobic Dance Workout,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,1078,"['DVD', 'warm-up', '3', 'dance', 'segments', 'cool', 'down', 'learn', '3', 'dance', 'segments', 'have', 'option', 'last', 'segment', '3', 'dances', 'DVD', 'motto', '3', 'moves', ""'re"", 'dancing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', '3', 'movements', 'learn', 'warm-up', 'are', 'really', 'part', 'dance', 'moves', 'presented', 'later', 'moves', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'however', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'coordinated', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'DVD', 'was', 'making', 'lots', 'mistakes', 'first', 'time', 'took', 'couple', 'workouts', 'got', 'moves', 'down', 'Petra', 'enthusiastic', 'being', 'annoying', 'music', 'fun', 'workout', 'cueing', 'adequate', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'are', 'several', 'places', 'where', 'extra', 'turns', 'are', 'given', 'options', 'When', 'turns', 'are', 'presented', 'Petra', 'basic', 'move', '2', 'back', 'dancers', 'do', 'turns.Aside', 'workout', 'Petra', 'back', 'dancers', 'have', 'normal', 'bodies', 'refreshing', 'workout', 'video.If', 'enjoy', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'videos', 'are', 'moderately', 'challenging', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'DVD']",3 2 1 Dance
