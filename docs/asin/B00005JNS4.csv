634723,A325ZMO6PL67FH,B00005JNS4,Anna McCall,"[1, 1]","Ed was part of my Wednesday night line-up in college and I looked forward to it every week.  Tom Cavanaugh is Ed, a New York city lawyer who returns to his hometown in Ohio after finding his wife in bed with another man.  He comes across an opportunity to purchase a bowling alley and runs his law office from there.  There is the usual cast of zany characters to support him as he rebuilds his life and reconnects with old friends, including his high school crush Carol Vessy.On the surface, the show is snarky and funny and totally tongue-in-cheek.  But delve a bit deeper into it, and you discover that the characters are layered and flawed. They are struggling with the American dream and what it means to them as they age and discover what it is they truly want out of life.",5,Grossly underappreciated and sorely missed!,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,779,"['Ed', 'was', 'part', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'line-up', 'college', 'looked', 'forward', 'week', 'Tom', 'Cavanaugh', 'Ed', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'lawyer', 'who', 'hometown', 'Ohio', 'finding', 'wife', 'bed', 'man', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'bowling', 'alley', 'law', 'office', 'there', 'usual', 'cast', 'zany', 'characters', 'support', 'life', 'reconnects', 'old', 'friends', 'including', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'Carol', 'Vessy.On', 'surface', 'show', 'snarky', 'funny', 'totally', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'bit', 'deeper', 'discover', 'characters', 'are', 'layered', 'flawed', 'are', 'struggling', 'American', 'dream', 'what', 'age', 'discover', 'what', 'truly', 'want', 'life']",Ed: Season 1

Great cast chemistry, quirky humor, exploration of relationship issues, etc. However, I feel the quality of the writing declined somewhat after the first season as it took on more of a soap opera feel.

634726,A3LART1Q4VFC2F,B00005JNS4,"gellerfan ""gell3334""","[113, 115]","Sometimes, the networks let a potentially great one slip away, due to ""just"" satisfactory ratings. For 4 years, David Letterman's company - Worldwide Pants, Inc. gave us just such a show - ""Ed""; a lovely and quirky ensemble comedy featuring a truly gifted cast including Tom Cavanugh, Julie Bowen, Josh Randall, Justin Long, Jana Marie Hupp, Lesley Boone among others and smartly written by Jon Beckerman and Rob Burnett.Briefly summarized, Ed Stevens, a NYC lawyer who loses his job, comes home to find his wife sleeping with the mailman; he decides to return gto his hometown  of Stuckeyville, Ohio in a quixotic search for his identity, and the unrequited high school love he left behind, the beautiful Carol Vessey, now a high school English teacher with her own wanderlust and uncertainty; Torn between her friendship with Ed and his persistent and humorous wooing and courtship of her, their relationship is the centerpiece of 83 wonderful episodes.Ed buys the local bowling alley, where he sets up his law office, and rediscovers the merriment and joy of smalltown life with renewed, meaningful friendships and relationships.The cast of characters - from his bowling alley employees to his relationships with his childhood best buddy, (now Dr.) Mike Burton, his wife Nancy,  Carol and Molly Hudson (H.S. principal ), the neophyte HS student Warren Cheswick - (superbly and obnoxiously portrayed by Justin Long)and his pursuit of life , love and lust are deftly interwoven in episodic gems, all with the central theme of Ed's pursuit of and friendship with Carol Vessey. There's a great story ""arc"" featuring the gorgeous Rena Sofer as ADA Bonnie Hanes who pursues Ed, much to the chagrin of a still uncertain Carol, and we feel Carol's angst as she discovers her true feelings for Ed begin to surface.Termed by TV Guide's Matt Roush as ""one of the best shows you are not watching for each of its four seasons, each epsiode captures the romance and longing for the simpler values of life and love by each of its characters.I recently acquired a pretty fair copy of the complete series, but have been looking forward to the series' ""official commercial"" pristine release. I watched the complete run over the course of several weeks. I found myself  laughing out loud, ""tearing up"" emotionally, wincing at embarrasing moments, but being altogether enchanted once again. It was so nice to renew friendships with ""the folks of Stuckeyville"" and the warm characters who who pass thru Stuckeybowl.From beginning to end, the show is a pure joy and one to be treasured. I recommend it highly and apologize for my wordy prose. Rent disc 1 when the dvd debuts in early 2007, and I assure the reader he or she will add the entire series to their shelves. (too bad the entire series couldn't be released as one set - and reasonably priced; after all, those who ""get"" the show, will certainly purchase the entire set). Latecomers will, too!A belated thanks to David Letterman, and his company for producing a quality television show.",5,"""ED"" - woefully underrated and sorely missed",1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,3026,"['Sometimes', 'networks', 'let', 'potentially', 'great', 'one', 'slip', 'away', 'due', 'just', 'satisfactory', 'ratings', '4', 'years', 'David', 'Letterman', 'company', 'Worldwide', 'Pants', 'Inc.', 'gave', 'just', 'show', 'Ed', 'lovely', 'quirky', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'truly', 'gifted', 'cast', 'including', 'Tom', 'Cavanugh', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'Josh', 'Randall', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Jana', 'Marie', 'Hupp', 'Lesley', 'Boone', 'others', 'smartly', 'written', 'Jon', 'Beckerman', 'Rob', 'Burnett.Briefly', 'summarized', 'Ed', 'Stevens', 'NYC', 'lawyer', 'who', 'job', 'home', 'find', 'wife', 'sleeping', 'mailman', 'return', 'gto', 'hometown', 'Stuckeyville', 'Ohio', 'quixotic', 'search', 'identity', 'unrequited', 'high', 'school', 'left', 'behind', 'beautiful', 'Carol', 'Vessey', 'now', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'own', 'wanderlust', 'uncertainty', 'Torn', 'friendship', 'Ed', 'persistent', 'humorous', 'wooing', 'courtship', 'relationship', 'centerpiece', '83', 'wonderful', 'episodes.Ed', 'local', 'bowling', 'alley', 'where', 'up', 'law', 'office', 'merriment', 'joy', 'smalltown', 'life', 'renewed', 'meaningful', 'friendships', 'relationships.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'bowling', 'alley', 'employees', 'relationships', 'childhood', 'best', 'buddy', 'now', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'Burton', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Carol', 'Molly', 'Hudson', 'H.S', 'principal', 'neophyte', 'HS', 'student', 'Warren', 'Cheswick', 'superbly', 'obnoxiously', 'portrayed', 'Justin', 'Long', 'pursuit', 'life', 'love', 'lust', 'are', 'deftly', 'interwoven', 'episodic', 'gems', 'central', 'theme', 'Ed', 'pursuit', 'friendship', 'Carol', 'Vessey', 'great', 'story', 'arc', 'featuring', 'gorgeous', 'Rena', 'Sofer', 'ADA', 'Bonnie', 'Hanes', 'who', 'Ed', 'much', 'chagrin', 'still', 'uncertain', 'Carol', 'feel', 'Carol', 'angst', 'true', 'feelings', 'Ed', 'begin', 'surface.Termed', 'TV', 'Guide', 'Matt', 'Roush', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 'four', 'seasons', 'epsiode', 'romance', 'longing', 'simpler', 'values', 'life', 'love', 'characters.I', 'recently', 'acquired', 'pretty', 'fair', 'copy', 'complete', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'series', 'official', 'commercial', 'pristine', 'release', 'watched', 'complete', 'run', 'course', 'several', 'weeks', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'tearing', 'up', 'emotionally', 'wincing', 'embarrasing', 'moments', 'being', 'altogether', 'enchanted', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'renew', 'friendships', 'folks', 'Stuckeyville', 'warm', 'characters', 'who', 'who', 'pass', 'thru', 'Stuckeybowl.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'show', 'pure', 'joy', 'one', 'be', 'treasured', 'recommend', 'highly', 'apologize', 'wordy', 'prose', 'Rent', 'disc', '1', 'when', 'dvd', 'early', '2007', 'assure', 'reader', 'will', 'add', 'entire', 'series', 'shelves', 'too', 'bad', 'entire', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'released', 'one', 'set', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'who', 'get', 'show', 'will', 'certainly', 'purchase', 'entire', 'set', 'Latecomers', 'will', 'too', 'A', 'belated', 'thanks', 'David', 'Letterman', 'company', 'producing', 'quality', 'television', 'show']",Ed: Season 1

From the reviews I am following, I appear to be with a great chorus of fans, who feel as I do. Perhaps, if the video scalpers had made top-notch quality of the DVDs they were selling, we would have already been enjoying the four episodic seasons over and over.Now I don't really know the hang-ups to getting the complete four seasons of ""Ed"" out on DVD, but there is such a thing as a shelf life and mortality. Putting off the availability of the seasonal DVD's much longer could result in a lower demand and be thought of as nice to have instead of a desire to own, like many other original TV series we use to watch with great anticipation each week. These four complete seasons are well worth a fair and competitive cost. Don't wait too long and make us both loose out.It has been more than a year since I first posted my review of ""Ed"" and I am really frustrated with those who have deterred the dvd presentations of ""Ed's"" 4 complete seasons. Furthermore, it looks dismal that this will ever happen. It would be nice if someone in the know would periodically (every 3 to 4 months) post up-dates as to what is being done to make this series available for home viewing.",5,"WE WANT ""Ed"" BACK IN PRIME TIME NOW!
