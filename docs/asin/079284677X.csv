157259,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,079284677X,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","The Amityville Horror, 1979 filmA mother, father, and children were murdered in 1974 for no apparent motive. A year later a new family inspects this house. The price is a bargain. The saleswoman tells about the rooms in this house. [The $80,000 price dates this film.] Does the murder mean anything? They take it. A priest knocks on the door and enters. [Unlocked front door!] He hears noises. Flies are at the window pane. A door opens. ""Get out!"" Father Delaney calls Kathy but drops the phone. A bad connection? ""Its cold in here."" Is the house well-insulated? A boy slips on the stairs. George chops wood, then picks up the groceries. Little Amy tells about her friend Jody. Kathy call Father Delaney, he was to bless the house.Flushing the toilet causes an overflow of black water! A visiting nun doesn't feel well and leaves. At night the fire went out. Kathy has a nightmare while sleeping. Something happens to the priest's car on the road! George doesn't feel well. Somehow $1,500 in cash disappeared from a jacket! The babysitter is locked in a closet, Amy is gone. Kathy and George go to the reception, then return home. Jody wouldn't let Amy open the unlocked closet door. We hear about the financial concerns of George. A window closes on a boy's hands! No bones broken. They hear the buzzing of flies by an open window. The front door pops open without a cause. The police are called to the Lutz home. They have questions. Amy talks about Jody. George visited the Town Hall and the library. Kathy sees something outside the window. Their house was built on a witch's land! Do they need a night out? One woman tells about the Shinnacock Indian and their use of this land.Is there something behind that brick wall? There is a room there. ""The passage to hell!"" A phone rings, there is no one on the line. What can they do? Someone turned a cross upside down. They hear noise in the early morning. There is thunder and lightning. Kathy has a nightmare. So does George. Should they move away? George is violent towards Kathy! She looks for Father Delaney, but he has gone away. Father Boylan visits him. The police sergeant asks about Father Delaney. Kathy does research at a newspaper. She recognizes a face in the newspaper! George returns to the house with his double-bit axe. There are strange actions. Blood drips down the stairs! The glass windows break inwards. There are screams. The drive away in the van. Where is their dog? The floor collapses! The dog attacks George at first. The van leaves, they never went back to this house.This is an interesting psychological horror film for those who believe in what they say. The threats are imagined or rigged. If you are a skeptic it seems like an oddball comedy without a laugh track. Was this inspired by the murder of the John List family? You may know of a local house where someone died violently yet there is no spooky reputation. You can't depend on newspapers that censor these deaths in some cases. [Was this the inspiration for the ""Blair Witch Project""?] The house where the Borden's were murdered has been in use for 120 years without any ghostly apparitions.",2,Another Haunted House Story,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,3136,"['Amityville', 'Horror', '1979', 'filmA', 'mother', 'father', 'children', 'were', 'murdered', '1974', 'apparent', 'motive', 'year', 'later', 'new', 'family', 'house', 'price', 'bargain', 'saleswoman', 'rooms', 'house', '[', '80,000', 'price', 'dates', 'film', ']', 'murder', 'mean', 'anything', 'take', 'priest', 'door', 'enters', '[', 'Unlocked', 'front', 'door', ']', 'noises', 'Flies', 'are', 'window', 'pane', 'door', 'Get', 'out', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'Kathy', 'phone', 'bad', 'connection', 'cold', 'here', 'house', 'well-insulated', 'boy', 'slips', 'stairs', 'George', 'wood', 'then', 'up', 'groceries', 'Little', 'Amy', 'friend', 'Jody', 'Kathy', 'call', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'was', 'bless', 'house.Flushing', 'toilet', 'overflow', 'black', 'water', 'visiting', 'nun', ""n't"", 'feel', 'well', 'night', 'fire', 'went', 'out', 'Kathy', 'nightmare', 'sleeping', 'Something', 'priest', 'car', 'road', 'George', ""n't"", 'feel', 'well', 'Somehow', '1,500', 'cash', 'disappeared', 'jacket', 'babysitter', 'locked', 'closet', 'Amy', 'gone', 'Kathy', 'George', 'go', 'reception', 'then', 'return', 'home', 'Jody', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'Amy', 'open', 'unlocked', 'closet', 'door', 'hear', 'financial', 'concerns', 'George', 'A', 'window', 'closes', 'boy', 'hands', 'bones', 'broken', 'hear', 'buzzing', 'flies', 'open', 'window', 'front', 'door', 'pops', 'open', 'cause', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'Lutz', 'home', 'have', 'questions', 'Amy', 'talks', 'Jody', 'George', 'visited', 'Town', 'Hall', 'library', 'Kathy', 'something', 'window', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'witch', 'land', 'Do', 'need', 'night', 'out', 'One', 'woman', 'Shinnacock', 'Indian', 'use', 'land.Is', 'there', 'something', 'brick', 'wall', 'room', 'there', 'passage', 'hell', 'phone', 'rings', 'one', 'line', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'Someone', 'turned', 'cross', 'upside', 'down', 'hear', 'noise', 'early', 'morning', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'Kathy', 'nightmare', 'So', 'George', 'Should', 'move', 'away', 'George', 'violent', 'towards', 'Kathy', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'gone', 'away', 'Father', 'Boylan', 'police', 'sergeant', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'Kathy', 'research', 'newspaper', 'face', 'newspaper', 'George', 'house', 'double-bit', 'axe', 'are', 'strange', 'actions', 'Blood', 'down', 'stairs', 'glass', 'break', 'inwards', 'are', 'screams', 'drive', 'away', 'van', 'Where', 'dog', 'floor', 'dog', 'attacks', 'George', 'first', 'van', 'never', 'went', 'back', 'house.This', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'who', 'believe', 'what', 'say', 'threats', 'are', 'imagined', 'rigged', 'are', 'skeptic', 'oddball', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'track', 'Was', 'inspired', 'murder', 'John', 'List', 'family', 'may', 'know', 'local', 'house', 'where', 'someone', 'died', 'violently', 'yet', 'spooky', 'reputation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'depend', 'newspapers', 'censor', 'deaths', 'cases', '[', 'Was', 'inspiration', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'house', 'where', 'Borden', 'were', 'murdered', 'been', 'use', '120', 'years', 'ghostly', 'apparitions']",N/A

Firstly though it grow's a little cheesier with time Amityville Horror was directed fine by Stuart Rosenberg,cinemaphotography and acting by James Brolin,Margot Kidder and their children good, though brilliant as he is Rod Steiger is way over the top and down-right embarasing as the Lutz family\priest in this. Musical-score by Lalo Schiffrin also errily-atmospheric I think maybe even nominated for an oscar or something similar at the time of original-release.In any case it was for it's time I believe the 2nd highest-grossing movie for it's year of release and most of us believed this so-titled based on a true-story which as most by now know was HOAX,hoax,and more of the same. Doesn't stand-up over time as a classical-scare in my opinion but other-horror-fan's love-it,actress Margot Kidder(then Superman's Lois Lane)has trashed connection with it saying she did it for monetary reason's only saying she never belived in the Lutz story and that she thought it was a pile of rubbish,that Jim Brolin was too sweet and a better PR man than she to dump on-it and with that I agree the content certainly is but as film it's entertaingly late 70's fiction. So check out an oldie not as bad as some made presently,however not frightening by today's standard's,but then who is anymore? Nostalgic for those who grew-up on Fangoria & Famous Monster's magazine's. Still not all that bad,has a few errie-moement's.

157261,AZSN1TO0JI87B,079284677X,A. Estes,"[0, 2]","Based on the semi-true story of the Lutz family, ""The Amityville Horror"" tells the tale of a newlywed couple who move their nuclear family into a spacious and gorgeous house they purchased on the cheap. Things aren't quite as simple as they seem, as the previous tenants were all brutally murdered in their sleep by one of their own. This part of the story is true, this much we know. What follows is either a shared hallucination by the Lutz family, a clever scam, or an unexplainable phenomenon.While ""The Amityville Horror"" isn't quite on par with other classics of its era such as ""The Omen"" or ""The Exorcist,"" it's still good for a few quality late-night scares. The special effects are pretty decent for their time, and even when they aren't achieved with the most sophisticated of means (see: eyes in the window) they still manage to send shivers down the spine. James Brolin and Margot Kidder play the unfortunate married couple and have enough on-screen chemistry to make the story believable. Brolin gives a performance so intense that the ""South Park"" boys likely fantasize about him going Amityville on Barbara Streisand. Kidder isn't given much to do other than act like a clueless hippy, but perhaps this is a trait carried amongst Lutz women. Rod Steiger appears as a priest who serves no other purpose than to slow down the plot. There is probably a good half-hour devoted to this character that could have been shaved off the final product, and the film would have been the better for it.The film is a slow-burner for sure. Unfortunately, what we get in the end is barely worth the 28-day build-up (2 hours for us). Common sense instills in us that leaving the house a few weeks earlier would have been the smart move, but I guess you just can't walk away from a ""killer"" deal, huh? The film inspired a slew of dumb sequels, some of which were admittedly more entertaining than their predecessor, as well as a Michael Bay-producedremakethat is actually pretty good. It may not have held up as well as others from its time, but ""The Amityville Horror"" is an intriguing story that is worth re-visiting from time to time.",4,"Get out of the...oh, nevermind!

Despite the fact of them finding out about the murder and being harrassed by ''demons'' they decide to stay and the chaos ensues.As far as this being a true story.. Whatever happened in that house could be attributed to common occurences or freak incidents-  How would a car accident or a cut on a priests hand have anything to do with spirits or demonic possession?They are trying to put a supernatural spin on things that are not out of the ordinary occurences. So the fact that a family died here just gives more of an excuse to attribute regular occurences to something supernatural.The people in this story could have made something out of nothing, been freaked out by the fact a family was killed there or the father could of been mentally ill. Everything else that happened was no proof of a ghost.. They could of made it all up.Other than that, This was a pretty good movie.

157265,A13RYFCGR7AM7E,079284677X,"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[3, 5]","I'm not even going to reduce myself to plumbing the depths of the question of whether or not this is a ""true"" story...I'm reviewing the film, and much like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (which we know to be fiction) or ""The Fourth Kind"" (of which the jury's still out in my case), the ""truth"" of the matter is irrelevant.I actually read the novel before I saw this movie (yes, I was reading at that age, and my father was of the opinion of 'if he wants to read it, let him read it'), but at in my youth I didn't really absorb the undercurrents of the story on the written page.As is the way of things, the movie comes out.  Of course, I wanted to go see it...well, my father's viewpoint diverged when it came to me seeing the film itself, so I had to wait a couple of years for the TV version one weekend prior to Hallowe'en...I'll admit it; scared the stew out of me, Ti-Di-Bowl and K-Tel Record collection commercials notwithstanding. My own home became a nightmare place of strange sounds and looming shadows, even moreso than it already was to a kid of my imagination (with parents that let me read that kind of stuff).Time passed...but I always fondly remembered that tension, that suspense, that WRONGness that the film inspired in me...so, my penchant for watching movies maturing along with me into a full-fledged hobby (or obsession, if you ask my family), I felt compelled to seek it out on DVD to add to the 'horror' shelf.I have to say, I'm thankful for my decision.A lot of people don't like this movie, and I wonder if it's because of it's purport to be true; if that's the case, close-mindedness is keeping a lot of folks from enjoying what is a startlingly effective film.  You have excellent actors in Brolin, Kidder, and Steiger, as well as a remarkable supporting cast.  The dread is built slowly but deliberately throughout the first half of the movie, the pacing quickening as you near the climax, when literally all hell breaks loose.  We witness James Brolin, as George Lutz, completely evolve into something he's not, but at the same time, we can relate to him as his world slowly comes unraveled around him (in his book ""Danse Macabre"", Stephen King alludes to the social/economic horrors that this film presents, and in the context of a family on edge, I agree with this wholeheartedly). His home spews black goo out of the plumbing, it's cold all the time, he can't sleep, and his job is swirling in the bowl.  Add to this the fact that his wife and step-kids seem to be falling apart, and you can almost understand why he's taken to not shaving or bathing...or talking.THIS is where the film shines; it's ability to make you relate to the characters...sure, their plight has a supernatural cause, but we've all had to deal with one thing after another just going haywire all at once...heck, it would be easier sometimes if we DID have an evil entity to blame it all on.That said, the supernatural elements of the film, in my opinion, are scary as hell.

None of the shock factors or scare tactics in this film ever reached to the proportional heights that The Excorcist did.In today's society in general and by today's movie standards, the devil just doesn't scare anymore...Again, it was the 70's.Margot Kidder looked hot and I have no idea where James Brolin was going with the hair (his character role ?).Despite years later finding out that the entire story may have been a hoax still leaves something to the imagination if indeed there was supernatural demonic forces at play somewhere within the real home itself.Now, 20-some years later,with dvd technology, the viewer is able to pause a lot of scenes and marvel or scoff at what was used for the special f/x sequences. Example: Pause the scene and zoom in on &quot;Jodi's eyes&quot;;nothing more than two cheap blinking red Christmas lights. Also, the scene where George Lutz (Brolin) looks up at the house in the end and sees Jodi's eyes staring at him is another &quot;zoom in marvel&quot;;It looks like a blow-up-close up of an actual rat,cat, or dog (could be a viscious gerbel).Actor Rod Steiger's priestly performance is very memorable.It could be considered a little bit over-the-top at times but still credible.Actress Helen Shaver from the current supernatural-thriller series Poltergeist:The Legacy makes a guest appearance as the friend who experiences &quot;bad vibes&quot; from the house.For a cheap and inexpensive Halloween treat this year rent Amityville Horror (the only one worth watching out of the entire sequels or prequels) !",4,No Excorcist...Still just as feisty...,971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,1894,"['Oh', 'sure', 'can', 'laugh', 'now', 'most', 'are', 'adults', 'However', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'teenager', 'tried', 'watch', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'back', '70', 'watching', 'alone', 'dark', 'less', 'Anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'chill', 'when', 'seeing', 'Jodi', 'red', 'eyes', 'glare', 'blink', 'bedroom', 'window', 'pulse', 'None', 'shock', 'factors', 'scare', 'tactics', 'film', 'ever', 'reached', 'proportional', 'heights', 'Excorcist', 'did.In', 'today', 'society', 'general', 'today', 'movie', 'standards', 'devil', 'just', ""n't"", 'scare', 'anymore', 'Again', 'was', ""70's.Margot"", 'Kidder', 'looked', 'hot', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'James', 'Brolin', 'was', 'going', 'hair', 'character', 'role', '.Despite', 'years', 'later', 'finding', 'out', 'entire', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hoax', 'still', 'something', 'imagination', 'indeed', 'was', 'supernatural', 'demonic', 'forces', 'play', 'somewhere', 'real', 'home', 'itself.Now', '20-some', 'years', 'later', 'dvd', 'technology', 'viewer', 'able', 'pause', 'lot', 'scenes', 'marvel', 'scoff', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'special', 'f/x', 'sequences', 'Example', 'Pause', 'scene', 'zoom', 'quot', 'Jodi', 'eyes', 'quot', 'nothing', 'more', 'two', 'cheap', 'blinking', 'red', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'Lutz', 'Brolin', 'up', 'house', 'end', 'Jodi', 'eyes', 'staring', 'quot', 'zoom', 'marvel', 'quot', 'blow-up-close', 'up', 'actual', 'rat', 'cat', 'dog', 'could', 'be', 'viscious', 'gerbel', '.Actor', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'priestly', 'performance', 'very', 'memorable.It', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'little', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'still', 'credible.Actress', 'Helen', 'Shaver', 'current', 'supernatural-thriller', 'series', 'Poltergeist', 'Legacy', 'guest', 'appearance', 'friend', 'who', 'quot', 'bad', 'vibes', 'quot', 'house.For', 'cheap', 'inexpensive', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'year', 'rent', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'entire', 'sequels', 'prequels']",N/A

Anyone who wants to avoid making a bad horror film needs to watch this and learn from this steaming pile of crap. Take lots of notes as possible. One scene in particular, George, who is wild-eyed and axing wood, is spotted by his wife who is wearing Catholic schoolgirl clothes(!), and she drops one of the two bags of groceries that's supposedly worth a week. Oh, wow...the spirit from the house controls a car. How could I forget the silly sex scene? You've got to be kidding me. An axe is thrown to a tree for no apparent reason. James Brolin, talk about stoicism. The stolen book from a library, the strange occurrence of unbroken hands, and the door broken from the inside are among the many bizarre moments. It's clearly evident, looking at Margot Kidder in The Amityville Bore, that she is a cuckoo person. No way is she anywhere near standards of Jamie Lee Curtis. One guy shows up with a six-pack, and then one minute later, he leaves. Instead of calling repeatedly for weeks, why doesn't Margot Kidder's character sally off to see the priest on the third day or so? What's the relevance of the priest and the detective in the film? Does anyone conceive the idea of interviewing the killer? Unbelievably, The Amityville Bore is a two hour fest yet nobody dies during it. It has the rip-offs moments from The Exorcist and The Shining. Why does the director have to keep showing the side of the house million of times? I get it already: the house resembles a skull!

157271,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,079284677X,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 3]","There is a lot of controversy surrounding the truthfulness of this supposed ""true story"". While a horrible crime did happen here, what is presented in this movie, and the book, seems to be, or what many believe to be, a complete and total hoax. On November 13, 1974, 23 year old Ronald DeFeo Jr., took a shotgun and murdered his entire family. His parents, both 43 years old, and his four siblings. Two sisters, 18 and 13, and two little brothers, 12 and 9. He later said that he heard ""voices"" telling him to do it and that many were trying to make the people believe that he was possessed(which would figure into the story for the sequel), and was just a convenient excuse for his case.  George and Kathy Lutz(here played by James Brolin and Margot Kidder), moved into the house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, N.Y., with her 3 kids, and after 28 days(although they originally said they were there for 10 days, which already makes you doubt their story), they moved out saying that the place was haunted and strange things happened. Things like weird smells, opening and shutting windows, glowing eyed pigs that levitated, a demonic pit in the basement, slime and blood from the walls, an abundance of flies, and urges to re-enact the DeFeo murders. George also seems to become possessed by the house's demonic spirit. While the publicity afterwards seemed to totally reak of ""hoax"", it has never actually been proven. Although, if you know the story and the details, you would never believe that any of this was ever true. It has been stated that the family moved in with a relative because of feeling unhappy living in the house, and this so called relative suggested that they exaggerate their ""feelings"" into a good ghost story. Right there tells you that this was nothing more than a grand hoax to fool the world, and it apparently worked. It was something made for a good ghost story, and it turned out that way. Some people, because of the scam factor of the ""haunted"" story, thought that the real murders were fake as well. That nothing ever happened at this house. The murders were real. The DeFeo's were real.  The movie itself is quite in-effective, and is never as ghostly or scary as it tries to be. The book it's based on is much creepier and more worth your time than this movie, if you are interested in the story at all. The acting is mediocre, with Brolin hamming it up, and Kidder just going through the motions. Rod Steiger also appears as a priest here, and it's a pretty one dimensional role. The effects are pretty cheesy and cheap looking, and the so called ""scares"" offer very little in that regard. There is an undeniable creep factor to it thanks to the scary windows and the decent musical score, but that is about it. It is a rather uneventful movie and it moves like molasses. What would be interesting is to have an actual movie about the real ""Amityville Horror"". The life of the DeFeo's and what brought Ronald Jr. to that fateful early morning on November 13,1974 to murder his entire family. They tried doing that in the sequel a few years later, but that too was not the DeFeo family and it incorporated the hauntings of this movie into that one as well. While the film doesn't hold up well at all, the only other unfortunate thing to come out of this besides the horrible murders of the DeFeo family, is the curse that George and Kathy Lutz have put upon the small, idyllic town of Amityville. To this day, 30 years later, there are still people bugging the citizens of the town over the story. Where to find the house. People who may or may not believe the story, but are there anyway. It will probably continue for as long as the house is standing. The whole story is great for a good book and an interesting ghost tale, but it did not translate well to film, and this movie is one that should of been left alone to the imaginations of the book's readers.",2,4 BD  1 BA  1 Demonic Spirit,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,3899,"['lot', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'truthfulness', 'supposed', 'true', 'story', 'horrible', 'crime', 'did', 'happen', 'here', 'what', 'presented', 'movie', 'book', 'be', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'be', 'complete', 'total', 'hoax', 'November', '13', '1974', '23', 'year', 'old', 'Ronald', 'DeFeo', 'Jr.', 'took', 'shotgun', 'murdered', 'entire', 'family', 'parents', '43', 'years', 'old', 'four', 'siblings', 'Two', 'sisters', '18', '13', 'two', 'little', 'brothers', '12', '9', 'later', 'said', 'heard', 'voices', 'telling', 'do', 'many', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'people', 'believe', 'was', 'possessed', 'would', 'figure', 'story', 'sequel', 'was', 'just', 'convenient', 'excuse', 'case', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'here', 'played', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'moved', 'house', '112', 'Ocean', 'Avenue', 'Amityville', 'N.Y.', '3', 'kids', '28', 'days', 'originally', 'said', 'were', 'there', '10', 'days', 'already', 'doubt', 'story', 'moved', 'out', 'saying', 'place', 'was', 'haunted', 'strange', 'things', 'happened', 'Things', 'weird', 'smells', 'opening', 'shutting', 'windows', 'glowing', 'eyed', 'pigs', 'levitated', 'demonic', 'pit', 'basement', 'slime', 'blood', 'walls', 'abundance', 'flies', 'urges', 're-enact', 'DeFeo', 'murders', 'George', 'also', 'become', 'possessed', 'house', 'demonic', 'spirit', 'publicity', 'afterwards', 'seemed', 'totally', 'reak', 'hoax', 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'proven', 'know', 'story', 'details', 'would', 'never', 'believe', 'was', 'ever', 'true', 'been', 'stated', 'family', 'moved', 'relative', 'feeling', 'unhappy', 'living', 'house', 'so', 'called', 'relative', 'suggested', 'exaggerate', 'feelings', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'Right', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'grand', 'hoax', 'fool', 'world', 'apparently', 'worked', 'was', 'something', 'made', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'people', 'scam', 'factor', 'haunted', 'story', 'thought', 'real', 'murders', 'were', 'fake', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happened', 'house', 'murders', 'were', 'real', 'DeFeo', 'were', 'real', 'movie', 'quite', 'in-effective', 'never', 'as', 'ghostly', 'scary', 'be', 'book', 'based', 'much', 'creepier', 'more', 'worth', 'time', 'movie', 'are', 'interested', 'story', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'Brolin', 'hamming', 'up', 'Kidder', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'also', 'priest', 'here', 'pretty', 'one', 'dimensional', 'role', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'cheap', 'looking', 'so', 'called', 'scares', 'offer', 'very', 'little', 'regard', 'undeniable', 'creep', 'factor', 'scary', 'windows', 'decent', 'musical', 'score', 'rather', 'uneventful', 'movie', 'molasses', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'have', 'actual', 'movie', 'real', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'life', 'DeFeo', 'what', 'brought', 'Ronald', 'Jr.', 'fateful', 'early', 'morning', 'November', '13,1974', 'murder', 'entire', 'family', 'tried', 'doing', 'sequel', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'too', 'was', 'not', 'DeFeo', 'family', 'incorporated', 'hauntings', 'movie', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'only', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'come', 'horrible', 'murders', 'DeFeo', 'family', 'curse', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'have', 'put', 'small', 'idyllic', 'town', 'Amityville', 'day', '30', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'still', 'people', 'bugging', 'citizens', 'town', 'story', 'Where', 'find', 'house', 'People', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'story', 'are', 'there', 'anyway', 'will', 'probably', 'continue', 'as', 'long', 'house', 'standing', 'whole', 'story', 'great', 'good', 'book', 'interesting', 'ghost', 'tale', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'imaginations', 'book', 'readers']",N/A

E Jackson,"[3, 5]","I am in complete shock at the moment- I can't believe after ALL these years, the Amityville Horror still does an incredibe job scaring me senseless, haha.This is just the ultimate horror film in every single way.  The slow and quiet build-up to the unexplainable events that supposedly actually happened and tormented a family that just wanted to move somewhere nice is STILL a story that sends shivers up my spine.  Something that still makes me think and try to come up with a rational explanation to all those wild experiences.I gotta tell you- when I was real young, I REFUSED to watch this movie because I knew what kind of fear the story was based on.  As a 28 year old man, many of those fears are still there and come back to haunt me while watching the story develop.The original Amityville Horror will always hold a special place in my heart as the first movie to ever give me nightmares, the first horror movie to ever make me shake and cry in total fear, and the first horror flick to ever change the way I think about life and death.  If all these events really did occur and torment that poor family, then I think people should open their eyes to the possibility there might be something evil out there.  I personally believe in God, and believe something happens when we die, but I'm not quite sure I believe something evil is out there.  Assuming this movie is based on a completely true story, well, who knows?Now, the movie is not flawless, because some of those ""GET OUT"" screams feel a bit dated to me, and when those voices are screamed instead of whispered, it kind of takes away from the suspense a bit.  But then again, if those sounds are based on a true story, I can't really complain.  Also, in reality, not EVERY lightning strike sounds the same.  I think the movie directors could have made each lightning strike sound different from the next and that would have made the frightening atmosphere even MORE intense and believable.One thing I didn't know is that, it's wasn't necessarily the people who were murdered in the home that was causing the next family to go through a series of disturbing events- but something evil made the oldest son of the previous family go insane and murder his family.  It was something that was living in the basement apparently, behind a brick wall where the families dog kept digging to the point where his paws were bleeding.On a final note, yes, it was VERY disturbing how the family seemed to completely disregard that the previous family was murdered.  If that was ME who found out about that kind of information, I wouldn't have moved into that house for anything.  Then again, in todays world you don't really hear about haunted houses anymore because apparently ghosts don't like the 21st century, haha.

Kidder was in SISTERS and BLACK CHRISTMAS, while Brolin showed up in WESTWORLD and THE CAR. Then, the two joined forces to play George and Amy Lutz in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR! Now, don't get me wrong, it's not the best movie in the world, nor is it very frightening. I just like seeing the Kidder / Brolin match-up! As the Lutz's, they get to act scared and crazy (Margot is slowly terrified and James goes bananas!). The house they buy is haunted / possessed by evil spirits that cause mayhem and whatnot. You see, the former occupants were all murdered in their sleep! The Lutz's start experiencing weird stuff almost immediately, including swarms of nasty house-flies and Jody, their daughter's new invisible friend. Rod Steiger is Father Delaney, the loudest priest in the universe, yelling and screaming his way through the film. When he finally shuts up, your ears will be ringing. Don Stroud is Father What's-his-name, Delaney's apprentice of sorts. Stroud usually plays tough-guys, so I kept waiting for him to clock someone! Anyway, the subplot between Steiger and Stroud is the main problem w/ this movie. It could have easily been left out and made TAH a better and (blessedly) shorter story! I know it's based on a ""true"" story, but come on now! I also love the psychic lady who simply must go to the house's basement. She's hilarious! Between her Constipated facial expressions and Steiger's howling, I found myself laughing out loud! Watch this one for the Margot Kidder / James Brolin factor. Ms. Kidder even bares a little skin for heaven's sake! If you like 70s-style cheese-fests, then this is just what the witchdoctor ordered!

However, the movie itself was dreadfully dull. I have seen 10 minute long haunted house stories on TV specials that are far more chilling than this slow moving, boring and silly movie. The whole success of the movie depended upon the misleading assertion that it was based upon a true story given that the only reason for watching it was out of curiosity. As it was later revealed, however, the novel, and therefore the movie, are total works of fiction, and rather poor ones at that. This movie is not the type of bad movie a la Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space that is fun to watch. It is just miserably bad. You might still want to rent the video to see some of the scenes that have since become popular cliches satarized in other movies and TV shows (like the bleeding walls), but otherwise avoid this one.

157277,A3LQU8CWUYFMJH,079284677X,Blu Review Obscura,"[4, 5]","The Amityville Horror Blu-ray reviewDistributor MGM Video USFor all the people who were supposedly scared witless by the recent modern day uprising in ghost/possession stories such as Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch Project and the other various haunted house efforts, many others were left wondering what all the fuss was about as it had all been done many years before only on a far greater scale. Now in fairness to some of the above mentioned titles, they are actually pretty good movies in their own right, however what they lacked in heart and soul is something that The Amityville Horror has in spades.Filmed at a time when most people actually still believed in this kind of phenomena, the film went on to be a cult favourite and spawned countless sequels with only the second one being of any value. The film begins with  a grisly murder spree and goes on to show a new family then moving into the same property some 12 months later. Almost as soon as they are settling into the property, does the audience comes to realise that this is the last place on Earth that any regular family would want to be and the tension gradually builds over the following days and nights until the inevitable final showdown. Watching the film many years ago it was clear that it was going to be an unnerving experience and unlike the modern day sagas which mostly rely mostly on cheap shocks and quick jumps to scare their audience, this movie uses more of a sense of foreboding and creepy atmosphere which gradually builds and places the viewer into the house right alongside the family concerned. Certainly one of the more genuinely creepy efforts, this is a film which should leave paranormal believers reaching nervously for the light switch and non believers at least somewhat entertained as the film comes across as being well made with decent acting and an interesting take on a now classic tale.As far as this Blu-ray release is concerned, MGM have unfortunately decided to release the film on a region A locked disc which is a shame for fans of movie who still have to worry about region coding. For anyone else, then the 1.85:1 1080p transfer offers a steady upgrade over previous non HD releases. Black levels are suitably strong with detail and colour appearing prominent throughout. Although the print could at some level be considered as being a little soft, close up shots contain some surprisingly strong imagery and the transfer is thankfully free from damage.Audio is presented with both a lossless DTS track and an original English mono option for purists. The DTS option is bassy and powerful which provides a certain new depth to the soundtrack with the now classic score appearing more vibrant and unsettling than ever before. Certain stand out moments will actually have you jumping from your seat on the odd occasion and this really helps to draw you into the movie like never before. Regular dialogue appears clear throughout although ultimately not spectacularly crisp as in newer releases, however bearing in mind the age and original filming elements, it may be unfair to expect anything more.Extras wise is probably the only real disappointment here, as the film has had a number of DVD releases with the previous special edition release containing a wealth of documentaries relating to not only to the film, but also covering the real life murder case in which the story is taken from. Unforgivably non of this material is present on the Blu-ray and that in itself should be considered a great loss and a slap in the face to followers of the film. The only extra we are given in fact, is a theatrical trailer which is accessed from a very cool spooky looking menu, however in this day and age this is simply not good enough, especially for a title such as this where the extras package is almost as important to the background story as the film itself.All things considered, if you love old time creepy horror stories with buckets of atmosphere, character development and guaranteed chills, then this film is for you. It is also safe to say that the movie itself  has never looked or sounded better and probably never will. For long time fans of the film, the Blu-ray is an easy purchase, however on this occasion you may need to also keep hold of your special edition DVD just so you can hang onto all of that excellent supplemental material.The Amityville Horror although deserving of a more complete package, makes a decent debut on high definition. Hopefully the first sequel will also find it's way to Blu-ray which although at times perhaps relied a little too much on the gore/shock factor, nicely sits alongside the original and completes the background story from the opening murders briefly shown at the start of this film.The best selling book about a haunted house has just become real!BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of those less

There is no point throughout the entire film where the audience is safe. Rather than forcing heavy make-up or special FX on the audience, it is the atmosphere built through the slow destruction of the characters' sanity paired with creepy events that garners genuine scares. There is no point at which the film clearly states that the events are actually occurring, and many of the clues leave the audience guessing as to whether the characters have passed their mental breaking point or whether the gate of hell has truly been opened beneath their new home. James Brolin offers one of the most frightening performances in the entire genre, truly becoming the character of George Lutz and walking the audience through his paranoid delusions, fear, and obsession. His crazed expressions and downward spiral into madness are more terrifying than any of the supernatural elements of the plot. AMITY also offers some of the most memorable horror scenes as well, most notably the scenes of the walls dripping blood and the priest that is forced out of the house by the disembodied voice screaming ""GET OUT!!"" While there are clearly elements that have been lifted from several other successful films from the 70s in this haunted tale, it is by all means and standards a classic in the genre, and becomes more and more interesting with repeated viewings.

157283,AE42JLYPXUI45,079284677X,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[2, 3]","In 1979, the most terrifying haunted house movie came our way. The haunted house film was entitled, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR. This film is based on the true events of the DeFeo murders, where Ronald Butch DeFeo, Jr. murdered his parents, two brothers, and two sisters, while the slept. This film is definitely the most horrifying haunted house story to have ever been told.In November of 1974, Ronald Butch DeFeo, Jr. murdered his parents and four brothers and sister in cold blood. He claimed during the trial that he heard the voices of evil spirits telling him to do so. A certain evil spirit, as Ronald claims, had possessed Ronald. But the town of Amityville, New York, is too smart to let him get off that easy. In 1975, a year after the massacre, the DeFeo's beautiful colonial house, located at 112 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, New York, is now up for sale. GEORGE LUTZ (played by the outstanding James Brolin) and his wife, KATHLEEN ""KATHY"" (played by Margot Kidder), come across the house, with a major interest in buying it, despite the news they've heard about the house's previous tenants. ""Houses don't have memories"", claims the couple, where they go on with buying the house. A month later, George and Kathy finally move in with their three childre, AMY (played by Natasha Ryan), GREG (played by K.C. Martel), and MATT (played by Meeno Peluce).On the first day, while Kathy and George are out in the back having some fun with the kids, the local priest, FATHER DELANEY (played by Rod Steiger), drops by to bless the house. He does not see Kathy or George, but he decides to bless the house anyway. He goes into one of the rooms, and is ready to bless the house, when a sudden mess of flies surround Father Delaney. They continue to surround him until the bedroom door suddenly opens, where an evil voice demands that Father Delaney, ""Get out..."" ""GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" (This particuarly scene made me crap myself). Father Delaney gathers up his belongings, as well as his energy, and runs out of the house.Over the course of the next few weeks, say around 12 days, things become very strange for the Lutz's. On such occasion, Amy has been talking to an invisible girl named, Jody. Kathy happens to get a glimps of Jody, where she sees a horrifying pig's face, with evil red glowing eyes, complete with an evil pig's grunt. The walls all ooze blood, the toilets spill a strange black ooze, the door is ripped off its hinges one night. One more thing, George Lutz, is suddenly not feeling very well. Every night, he awakens at 3:15 am. Why?, you ask. Because that is the time that Ronald had killed his entire family, single-handedly. While at a bar with his friend and co-worker, JEFF (played by Michael Sacks), the bartender serves George, but when he gets a good look at George, the bartender becomes startled from fright, for he claims that George looks exactly like...Ronald DeFeo. Jeffery's wife, CAROLYN  (played by Helen Shaver), is sort of a medium. They accompany George to the house, where they all plan to go out for a few hours, but Carolyn is drawn to the cellar, for she feels the evil presence within the house. She, George, and Jeff break down the wall that the Lutz's dog, Harry, has been clawing at. The wall reveals an ancient Indian burial ground that contains that of the spirits that were slaughtered there around the 1600s or the 1700s. On the 28th day, all hell breaks loose. George and Kathy gather up the kids and Harry, where they make a run for their lives. They make it out of the house without any problem, where they drive off to safety. The family never returned to claim the house or their personal belongings.This film is the scariest haunted house film I have ever seen in my entire life. I sat up one night to watch it and I was scared out of my wits. Now, as I said, this film is based on true events. The DeFeo murders did actually take place at 112 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, New York. The hauntings that the Lutz's experienced were not at all to this extent, but I have heard that they did experience some pretty spooky stuff. I just would like to point out that the DeFeo family that was murdered by their oldest son, Ronald, are in no way, shape, or form, relatives of mine.

For one thing, the George in the movie didn't seemed nearly as worry about his debts as he was stressed by it. This took away the anxiety feelings of the novel. Also different is the particular way he acted. In the novel, he was really dependent on his priest to help him and frequently called him to update his status. In the movie, I see the priest a few times, but wasn't too sure of what he was there for as he didn't seem to be too connected with George.Not much else about the movie's differences from the book bothered me, except for one other thing, Jodie. In the book, I thought the character of Jodie was done beautifully. The novel really made him seem like a sinister force and always kept me trying to think up what he might look like. The movie, on the other hand, bored me. Jodie had maybe one good scene and the other scenes confused me more than anything.The ending in the novel was also much more sinister than the cliche ""total chaos"" ending in the movie, but the movie's ending was not that bad.

James Brolin was quite good as George Lutz. Margot Kidder & Rod Steiger also did an excellent job in the film.  I'm pleased to have it to my collection.  The DVD was clear & crisp. The sound quite sharp.  There were (I think) seven radio spots, a commentary also, as well as the original theatrical trailer (& I think a documetary segment which I haven't seen yet).Overall, MGM did justice to the release of the movie.The back cover states widescreen, yet after watching the DVD, I can say for a fact that it was indeed a pan & scan with no options anywhere in the menu for any widescreen option which I would have preferred.In any event, as the film was so good & the clarity & audio of the DVD were looking quite nice, I'd say it deserves a five star rating, so I'm giving it one (Another reviewer said things were slow in developing momentum before the happenings began in the movie.  I can't really agree.  Within the first 12-15 minutes we see Rod Steiger as the priest there to bless the house, covered in bees.  From that point onwards, the pace was rather fluid.

Margot Kidder and James Brolin are pretty good as the young couple who purchase a large house, to bring their children to as well. When strange things occur, the family begins a suspenseful escape from the house, which apparently has a life of its own.The special effects are sometimes imaginitive and scary (such as the blood and ooze ejecting from the walls), but they can also be silly and embarrassing (the red eyes watching from the window). The music score is really absorbing and eerie, adding more atmosphere. It's no wonder the score was nominated for an Oscar.

There were suspenseful moments, but they got mired in a whole lot of padding.  And the whole thing had television production feel to it.The story starts out with the murder of a family while they sleep.  Then we skip to a year later and we see a young couple, played by James Brolin and Margot Kidder, taking a tour with a real estate agent of the same house.  The real estate agent seems impatient to unload the house, and the house is apparently selling for a great deal less than it's worth, due to the murders that occurred a year prior.  Kathy (Margot Kidder) states that it's a great house, but she states her reluctance to buy a house where such gruesome murders occurred.  George (James Brolin) tells her ""Houses have no memories"" and they decide to take the house.  We also find out that they are newlyweds, and Kathy has three children, 2 boys and a girl, from a previous marriage.So the Lutz family moves in, and strange things start happening.  The Catholic priest, played by Rod Steiger, comes over to bless the house, and he encounters an evil presence and some flies.  He starts to try and perform the blessing, but is taken ill and basically chased out of the house by voices and more flies.  The Lutz family, who happen to be outside at the time, don't get to experience the show.  The priest runs away, but tries to contact the Lutz family numerous times on the phone, but keeps getting cut off.  The mood of the movie suggests evil forces at work, but I wouldn't discount poor phone service.Anyway, more crazy stuff starts happening, cold drafts, noises, doors getting ripped off hinges, the family dog getting a little nutty, the daughter talking to a new pretend friend, chairs rocking on their own, things getting lost, baby sitter getting locked in a closet and freaking out, etc.  George starts to lose it, getting all moody like, and apparently begins to take on the appearance of the killer of the previous family that lived in the house, who happened to be the older son of said family.Now I just want to say that, while this movie is two hours long, there's no real depth provided for the main characters, so you don't really become involved with them, and basically don't care what happens to them.  At least that's how it was for me.  The house, however, was presented in such a way that it became a character in the movie, a creepy, eerie character that I wanted to know more about.Other stuff happens, and we eventually find out through George's business partner's girlfriend, who apparently possesses some limited psychic ability, that the house was built on a spot where something terrible happened, and now the spirits of the victims of that terrible event are in the house.  After a month, the Lutz family finally has had enough, and leaves the house without taking anything but the clothes on their back.  Having forgotten the dog, George does go back to retrieve it, but based on what happened when he did so, I would have just gotten a new dog.Anyway, not a bad movie, but a little longer than necessary, and not a whole lot of depth to the characters, except maybe the house.  Had they cut the running time down, made us more involved with the characters, and added a few more levels to the creep factor, this could have been a really great, scary movie, instead of a somewhat scary more often boring movie.  There are a few truly creepy scenes, but they are far and few between.  There is a trailer, but that's about it for extras.  I would have liked to seen a little more with regards to the history of the house, or production notes, but that would have required someone to do a little extra work, and I guess this movie wasn't worth it.

MGM may not exactly be known for superb DVD transfers, but this disc actually looks pretty good. (I had to have it no matter what though.) Brolin and Kidder make a great couple, and their acting is spot-on. They may experience some quite incredible things in their new home, but their performances stay believable throughout. -And guess what, I don't think Steiger is hammy at all !. It's too bad Hollyweird doesn't make that many haunted house movies anymore, because if you know what you're doing, they can be (relatively) easy to make. -Just keep it simple, and stay the heck away from CGI if you can. I saw &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; in a theater when it first came out back in '79, and it scared me like few other films had before it.

157297,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,079284677X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 13]","Certainly, this movie deserves a place in the collection of all horror lovers, but it is far from epitomizing the best of the genre.  I am sure it proved much scarier for original audiences back in 1979 than it does for we blood-and-gore inured veterans of such macabre moviemaking today, especially since an air of &quot;truth&quot; surrounded the events back then.  As a modern viewer, I can't help but be somewhat put off by the fact that this whole story proved to be a fabrication; as a believer in supernatural phenomena, Amityville immediately conveys to my mind a sense of shame and frustration--this story being revealed as untrue is the kind of thing that makes the pursuit of the reality of ghosts seem ludicrous to so many people.You all probably know the story.  A family is murdered, a young family decides to buy the house in spite of its recent violent history, frights and general freakiness ensue, and a final escape is finally made.  There's not much gore here--a few sweeping shots of murdered children, nothing that would scare most six-year-olds today.  I really expected more physical manifestations to be presented; the bleeding walls is just about it in terms of special effects.  In some respects, I have to ask myself why the family, especially the mother, became convinced that something evil was taking place; the evidence she was presented with did not seem to be enough to make a normal person jump so quickly to the conclusion that the place was haunted or possessed.  Then again, I have to ask myself why these people, once they figured out what was seemingly going on, waited so long to leave the house.  I know--if they had fled earlier, the movie would have been too short, but I am trying to examine this in terms of my prerequisite suspended disbelief.Frankly, the most horrifying part of the movie for my eyes was the totally unnecessary sight of James Brolin approaching the camera in his underwear (three times, in fact).  As a second aside, this film offers one of the most impressive examples of overacting I have ever seen in the person of the tuned-in, vibe-feeling associate who feels compelled to walk right into the house and commence taking an axe to a  basement wall.All in all, it's a pretty good movie.

157299,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,079284677X,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[25, 32]","The seventies were crazy times to be an American. We had just bailed ignominiously out of Vietnam, been chewed up by inflation, suffered throught the resignation of a President, brazened out the gas shortage, mobilized the Civil Defense and fought off plagues of flesh-hungry zombies stalking the Pennsylvania countryside, coped with reports of cannibalistic crazies terrorizing the badlands of Southwest Texas, slicing up tourists and wearing their faces like Halloween masks. And things were just getting started: as the decade waned, Americans had to deal with houses spewing blood and black tarlike goop, with red-eyed spectral pigs bothering good taxpaying New York homeowners, and worse---with Roman Catholic priests running around the dioceses, begging to perform exorcisms!Yeah, you guessed it: I've just awakened to chunky nuggets of ghoulish delight that lair deep down in the storm cellar of ""Amityville Horror"", which is an often reviled, albeit woefully flawed, fun little classic of horror and grue. I like the kitchen and the double bath---let's MOVE IN!Full Disclosure: Had I not been subject to American Movie Classics Amityville Triple Feature---including the impossibly sick and twisted Part II (Possession) and the amusing but derivative Part III (in glorious 3-D!)---I would never have appreciate this little bauble of depravity for what it is. I first caught it on VHS a decade ago; already unimpressed with the cheesy cross-cut edits in the intro massacre, I decided to part ways with the 'Horror the moment James Brolin's bushy Chewbacca face popped into the picture---I was thoroughly grossed out by an excessive, whopping overdose of sheer seventies cheese, and flipped the tape off. What a mistake my young self made! With that, Moral #1 of The Amityville Horror:MORAL #1: NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF JAMES BROLIN. Yah he's a hairy Wookie, but the guy really grows on you, especially as he starts upping the quality time with an Axe. Brolin plays unlucky homeowner George Lutz, who spots a great deal in a charming Long Island colonial mansion and moves in with wife Kathy (Margot Kidder, fresh off mega-stardom in ""Superman"") and his lovely little family, not knowing that another charming little family was blown to atoms just a couple of years before in this very house, not realizing that gaping Hell awaits, and not even noticing that the House looks like a big hungry monster with those nasty windows leering at passerby like forlorn eyes!Wake up, you Walkin' Carpet!That said, Brolin really gets into this flick and admittedly the big guy grows on you, flexing those mighty thews, chopping wood like a Greek god, and crackling with hostile energy (he even unnerved me when he and a nervous employee had a little face-to-face and Brolin wouldn't part ways with that wood-chopper)with latent hostility. Brolin owns ""Amityville Horror"".MORAL #2: IF PRIESTS AND NUNS RUN SCREAMING FROM YOUR HOUSE, IT'S TIME TO MOVE. Nuns and priests don't think the Lutzes got a steal. Rod Steiger (Father Delaney)is really just unforgivably awful in this film, presaging his complete meltdown as an actor in the excremental ""Mars Attacks!."" His only real task in this role is to cover his face with his hands and look critically constipated. He succeeds wildly. Also, the scene in which he's grilled by Hal Holbrook-lookalike Murray Hamilton (also the Mayor from ""Jaws"") goes on forever. Hit fast forward---the Mercy of Christ compels thee!MORAL #3: IS IT JUST ME, OR IS THE STUFF MARGOT KIDDER IS WEARING JUST A LITTLE TOO PRE-TEEN TO PASS MUSTER IN POLITE SOCIETY? C'mon, folks---pig-tails and fake school uniforms? Anyway, Kidder handles her role of screaming and bugging out her eyes just fine for me. Though I do have some ethical questions about the nature of Mr. Lutz's attraction for Mrs. Lutz---all those kiddie dresses, for pity's sake, man!!!---, but those are outside the scope of this review.MORAL #4: WHEN YOUR HUSBAND NAMES THE HOUSEHOLD AXE, IT'S TIME TO GET COUNSELING. Look, director Stuart Rosenberg was an old hand at helming a movie: he was 52 years old when he directed the flick and had been in the business for 25 years. He directed ""Cool Hand Luke"", for God's sake! And for all that experience, he turns out a pretty ugly film, let's be honest. It's all very seventies: the point and shoot camera-work, the incessant shots of the House's admittedly freakish windows, ugly overexposure and miserable lighting, sets that look like ugly sets, and tons of pancake make-up.And yet, for all of that---""Amityville Horror"" has a delicious little horror vibe all its own that raised my hackles. The dark circles around Brolin's eyes, his apelike surliness, my absolute certainty that if his hapless employee asked him just ONE MORE QUESTION he was going to bury that chopper up to the hilt in the guy's forehead, the spooky red-lit House, the huge demonic pig hulking in one of the eye-shaped windows (that one is going to give me nightmares), Brolin getting chummy with the axe, and the total breakdown of an otherwise all-American family---for some reason, it just clicked. It worked me like a professional, and after the first 60 minutes of sitting spellbound watching it on TV (even with horrible commercial breaks) I broke down, gave in to the power of The Brolin, and ran out and bought the DVD. It's worth every penny.MORAL #4: MAYBE THAT 'IMAGINARY FRIEND JODIE' YOUR KID HAS BEEN PLAYING WITH ISN'T IMAGINARY AT ALL. ""Amityville Horror"" the First has all the earmarks of a trashy seventies creepfest, but in the end I believed! Nasty, vicious, dark, atmospheric, boasting Brolin and the Axe, and featuring a creepy red-eyed demon pig, ""Amityville"" signed my Halloween dance card and made me giggle in fear. Everything I know about Real Estate I learned from ""Amityville Horror""---if it sounds too good to be true, it's probably demon possessed.",3,There goes the Neighborhood!,1098748800,"10 26,

The site of the Amityville House was once used to house criminally insane native americans. Now for modern history: On November 13, 1974, Ronny DeFeo murdered his parents, &amp; 4 brothers &amp; sisters with a shotgun at 3:15 a.m. (The Lutzes would later let their sleep in the very bed that the DeFeo children were murdered in.)  A year later, the lutzes moved in. In an erie coincidence, George Lutz looked like Ronny Defeo's twin. Weird things started almost immediately. When a priest, who was a family friend, tried to bless the house. The room became filled with flies, he became extremely ill, &amp; a voice told him to get out. Later, when he tried to call &amp; warn his friends, the line went to static &amp; the phone burned his hands. Kathy Lutz's aunt was a nun, &amp; she too became violently ill &amp; fled. The daughter, Amie, kept talking about an &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot;, Jodi. When Kathy tried to say noone was there, Amy said she went out the window. Kathy looked and SAW a pig with glowing red eyes. George saw it from the yard also. Probaby the most erie, George woke up EVERY NIGHT at exactly 3:15 a.m. (The time of the murders) The idea that this was a hoax was started by a man who was called to investigate, &amp; was thrown out for bringing 6 witches &amp; a news crew. He NEVER set one toe in the house. He later recanted &amp; apologized shortly before his book, &quot;The Amityville Conspiracy&quot; was released, but died shortly after, even before his book hit the stands. Also, a story abounds that the Lutz's lawyer helped them conjur this over a bottle of wine, but the Lutz's didn't drink AT ALL. All that they had in the house was one bottle of blessed wine. If anyone doubts this story, I invite you to do as I did: go to a web site called &quot;The Warrens Investigate The Amityville Horror. There are even photographs to prove it. The Warrens  were going to write the book, but Jay Anson simply beat them to it.

157303,A1FHKTXCB0CKKM,079284677X,"D. Barreto ""ladydi4476""","[2, 3]","Ok I realize this movie has become increasingly cheesy and corny with each passing year. Most reviewers would say it's a piece of crap, but having seen it numerous times over the past 25 years I still say it's one creepy film. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I was so young when I first saw it, but to this day it just gives me goosebumps. I've always been fascinated with the story of Defeo murders that took place in that house 30 years ago. That more than anything else absolutely terrifies me. Mainly because it really happened. I visited, well took pictures from a car, this house two decades ago and it was so surreal to be looking at a house where such awful events too place. All that aside, the actual claim of the Lutz's hauntings doesn't particularly frighten me as much. This movie does however. I know it's extremely dated and the acting is melodramtic and James Brolin looks like a maniac with a ax, but it still scares me. It could be the look of the film that does it for me. Or it could be that damn eery music. That opening theme has got to be the number one most terrifying theme for me ever. It's second even to the theme on The Exorcist or Halloween. Actually I love the Halloween theme and listen to it with no problem. But Amityville's haunting children singing theme...yeah that's not cool. I hear it and I immediately start to feel a chill. If you take away the music perhaps this film wouldn't be as scary. Whether the Lutz's story was a hoax or not, I really don't care. This is a movie, it's fiction.

157312,AJZZWCLI4I5GY,079284677X,Ender84,"[3, 5]","I want to start out by saying that this movie is an undisputed horror classic. I do not want any of my critiques to take away from that.The Amityville Horror is a familiar haunted house tale derived from ""true"" events. It is about a young family who moves into a house that was a real steal. So what if its previous inhabitants were all shot to death in their sleep by a man guided by voices in his head? Does it really matter that the patriarch of the new family looks exactly like that gun toting lunatic? Houses don't have memories, right?The house is the real star of the movie. Walls bleed, crucifixes invert, and disembodied voices are aplenty. While there are plenty of scares to go around, they simply are not as scary by today's standard. However, the image of the house with a soft glow emitting from the windows is every bit as iconic and memorable as Freddy's glove.The audio is superb. Squalling cats, creaky steps, and raspy demonic voices are crisp and clear and will have you wondering about that dark corner in your room when the surround sound is cranked up. The haunting children's choir that runs throughout the movie is as disturbing today as it was when I first heard it so many years ago.The picture quality and complete lack of any special features is a bit disappointing. The picture is certainly and upgrade from the DVD, but it is only average at best compared to other Blu-rays. Many scenes are sharp and vibrant, but too many are dull and blurry. Whether this is the fault of the filmmakers or simply a less than stellar transfer, I do not know, but the bad is more visible on Blu-ray than it is on DVD. Luckily the good outweighs the bad, but only marginally.However, something that is unforgivable is the lack of any special features except for a poor quality trailer. No commentary, no behind the scenes, no documentaries-nothing. This simply does not fly in this day. Even something as simple as a screen of text about the events that this movie is based on would have been okay, but to have nothing is inexcusable.Overall, this is a great release of a horror classic. If you have never seen this movie before, keep in mind that it is about 30 years old. Scare tactics then were considerably different than they are today. Don't be critical. Dim the lights, crank the surround sound, and I'm sure you will have a great time. This is definitely the best version to date despite my minor complaints.

Some of them are impressive (the blood running off the walls and stairs, the flies surrounding one particular room), but they all look as if the creators of this movie were trying way too hard to scare the audience back in 1979. The acting doesn't help, either. Margot Kidder is the only one in the movie who seems to give a good performance, while the others are either laughable or dull. The music was pretty tedious, but the main theme is its finest moment.As an agnostic, I doubt that the alleged true events actually happened.

Yes, there's been controversy about the authenticity of this supposedly true story versus a fictionalized embellishment for making a Hollywood profit (and if it was embellished, well, hey, it worked because it was a hit).

In other words, the final theatrical product, whatever it took to get there, is undoubtedly effective and downright creepy, especially James Brolin's (George) disturbing and gradually paced mental and physical transformation into a pale, bloodshot-eyed doppelganger of one particular person (eek!), which I won't give away.  The special effects also hold up surprisingly well, even today, except for one particularly bad special effect near the end when George is about to enter the house and looks up to the second-floor window.  If it did, indeed, however, borrow or steal from the superior ""Exorcist"" for monetary gain, like some say, versus the supposedly true Lutz's account, that would be, well, normal.  That's what a lot of movie-makers do in Hollywood, because, as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery (well, at least that's the nicest way to say it, instead of saying you're a thief).  Going back and seeing ""The Amityville Horror"" now, I can even see where ""Poltergeist"" borrowed some of its closing scenes from ""Amityville,"" including the family dog.  One could even say that ""The Shining"" borrowed from ""Amityville"" regarding the husband's change in personality, so to speak, and how the husband breaks into the bathroom.  See what I mean?  Judge for yourself.  It's also about 20 minutes too long (the brother's wedding was unnecessary and should have been edited out, along with a couple of other scenes), but that's all redeemed somewhat by its surprisingly high fear factor and above-average number of thunder claps, which are definitely integral to the plot!",4,The consummate haunted-house story for purists who really want a scare.,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2496,"['[', 'Rounded', 'up', '3-1/2', 'stars', ']', 'original', '1979', 'version', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'James', 'Brolin', 'father', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'George', 'Lutz', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'original', 'Superman', 'movies', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'easily', '2005', 'remake', 'even', 'remake', 'had', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'actually', 'performance', 'Oscar-winner', 'Rod', 'Steiger', '1976', 'Heat', 'Night', 'preacher', 'movie', 'best', 'Yes', 'been', 'controversy', 'authenticity', 'supposedly', 'true', 'story', 'fictionalized', 'embellishment', 'making', 'Hollywood', 'profit', 'was', 'embellished', 'well', 'worked', 'was', 'hit', 'enough', 'send', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'knowing', 'undeniably', 'true', 'account', 'documentation', 'real-life', 'murders', 'regardless', 'Lutz', 'family', 'on-screen', 'version', 'experiences', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'murders', 'took', 'place', 'other', 'words', 'final', 'theatrical', 'product', 'took', 'get', 'there', 'undoubtedly', 'effective', 'downright', 'creepy', 'especially', 'James', 'Brolin', 'George', 'disturbing', 'gradually', 'paced', 'mental', 'physical', 'transformation', 'pale', 'bloodshot-eyed', 'doppelganger', 'one', 'particular', 'person', 'eek', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'special', 'effects', 'also', 'hold', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'even', 'today', 'one', 'particularly', 'bad', 'special', 'effect', 'end', 'when', 'George', 'enter', 'house', 'up', 'second-floor', 'window', 'did', 'indeed', 'however', 'borrow', 'steal', 'superior', 'Exorcist', 'monetary', 'gain', 'say', 'versus', 'supposedly', 'true', 'Lutz', 'account', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'normal', 'what', 'lot', 'movie-makers', 'do', 'Hollywood', 'because', 'say', 'imitation', 'sincerest', 'form', 'flattery', 'well', 'least', 'nicest', 'way', 'say', 'instead', 'saying', ""'re"", 'thief', 'Going', 'back', 'seeing', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'now', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'where', 'Poltergeist', 'borrowed', 'closing', 'scenes', 'Amityville', 'including', 'family', 'dog', 'One', 'could', 'even', 'say', 'Shining', 'borrowed', 'Amityville', 'regarding', 'husband', 'change', 'personality', 'so', 'speak', 'how', 'husband', 'bathroom', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'Judge', 'also', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'brother', 'wedding', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'couple', 'other', 'scenes', 'redeemed', 'somewhat', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'fear', 'factor', 'above-average', 'number', 'thunder', 'claps', 'are', 'definitely', 'integral', 'plot']",N/A

There would seem to be some justification for such a notion.  I mean, we all know about poor Margot Kidder's personal difficulties of a decade or so ago (thank goodness she seems to be on the rebound).  But could she have inadvertantly summoned a few demons from Amityville's Gateway to Hell?  And what of James Brolin?  Did he suffer from a similar curse?  After all, HE wound up marrying Barbra Streisand!!!(Kidding, kidding!  I'm kidding!  Love ya, Babs!  Really.)But I don't love this movie.  Somehow I watched the whole darn thing on a recent Sunday afternoon, all the while waiting for it to get just a little scary.  The problem, which others have alluded to, is that the movie was apparently trying to adhere to the outlines of the book on which it was based--a work which was supposed to be ""non-fiction"" but has since been largely debunked.  So the film hopes to win us over with its ""just the facts ma'am"" approach when the ""facts"" were largely fiction to begin with.In other words, we could have used some good hardcore BUNK to up the entertainment ante.  And Devil take the hindmost--or the most boring, in this case.  By some reports, the 2005 AMITYVILLE HORROR takes all kinds of liberties with the plotline, and I imagine it's at least more of a spirited ride than this dud.  When the ""truth"" is found to be lies, you are at least free to improvise on it you want.There is something emblematically ""70s"" about THE AMITYVILLE HORROR.  I was actually kind of surprised that it was made so late in the decade.  But of course, the (supposed) events depicted took place in the early 70s, and it seems fitting that its action (if not the film itself) pre-dates slicker fare such as THE EXORCIST.  Everything about AMITYVILLE is very B-movie--from the downright poor cinematography to the hokey script.  It's all very cheesy, but it's too earnest to turn into good campy fun.Consider the Rod Steiger factor.  Now Rod could be very good--or painfully bad.  In a reasonably good vehicle, a savvy director could reign Steiger's innate hamminess in, at least a little.  But here he chews the scenery so ferociously that it's no wonder that eventually the walls start bleeding.I suppose this stinker of a film could be said to at least offer one valuable object lesson:  never EVER move into a  home that looks like one giant jack-o-lantern!",2,CalAmityville Horror,1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,2546,"['have', 'wonder', 'are', ""n't"", 'Tinseltown', 'urban', 'myths', 're', 'AMITYVILLE', 'HORROR', 'Curse', 'la', 'POLTERGEIST', 'other', 'movies', 'cast', 'crew', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'jinxed', 'thereafter', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'justification', 'notion', 'mean', 'know', 'poor', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'personal', 'difficulties', 'decade', 'so', 'ago', 'thank', 'goodness', 'be', 'rebound', 'could', 'have', 'inadvertantly', 'summoned', 'few', 'demons', 'Amityville', 'Gateway', 'Hell', 'what', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Did', 'suffer', 'similar', 'curse', 'HE', 'wound', 'up', 'marrying', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Kidding', 'kidding', ""'m"", 'kidding', 'Love', 'ya', 'Babs', 'Really', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'Somehow', 'watched', 'whole', 'darn', 'thing', 'recent', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'while', 'waiting', 'get', 'just', 'little', 'scary', 'problem', 'others', 'have', 'alluded', 'movie', 'was', 'apparently', 'trying', 'adhere', 'outlines', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'work', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'non-fiction', 'been', 'largely', 'debunked', 'film', 'win', 'over', 'just', 'facts', ""ma'am"", 'approach', 'when', 'facts', 'were', 'largely', 'fiction', 'begin', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'good', 'hardcore', 'BUNK', 'up', 'entertainment', 'ante', 'Devil', 'take', 'hindmost', 'most', 'boring', 'case', 'reports', '2005', 'AMITYVILLE', 'HORROR', 'kinds', 'liberties', 'plotline', 'imagine', 'least', 'more', 'spirited', 'ride', 'dud', 'When', 'truth', 'found', 'be', 'lies', 'are', 'least', 'free', 'improvise', 'something', 'emblematically', '70s', 'THE', 'AMITYVILLE', 'HORROR', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'surprised', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'late', 'decade', 'course', 'supposed', 'events', 'depicted', 'took', 'place', 'early', '70s', 'fitting', 'action', 'not', 'film', 'slicker', 'fare', 'such', 'EXORCIST', 'Everything', 'AMITYVILLE', 'very', 'B-movie', 'downright', 'poor', 'cinematography', 'hokey', 'script', 'very', 'cheesy', 'too', 'earnest', 'turn', 'good', 'campy', 'fun.Consider', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'factor', 'Now', 'Rod', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'painfully', 'bad', 'reasonably', 'good', 'vehicle', 'savvy', 'director', 'could', 'reign', 'Steiger', 'innate', 'hamminess', 'least', 'little', 'here', 'scenery', 'so', 'ferociously', 'wonder', 'eventually', 'walls', 'start', 'bleeding.I', 'suppose', 'stinker', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'least', 'offer', 'one', 'valuable', 'object', 'lesson', 'never', 'EVER', 'move', 'home', 'one', 'giant', 'jack-o-lantern']",N/A
157321,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,079284677X,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 2]","Relying on a horrifying story supposedly based on some true events and a very creepy atmosphere that builds throughout the movie, The original ""Amityville Horror"" is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, haunted house movie ever made.  Critics consistently point to the lack violence and overt action in the movie but, perhaps, what the ""Amityville Horror"" does not do is indeed the very same thing that makes it an effective ghost story/haunted house horror movie.So many of today's films attempt to create manifestations of demons, ghosts, and the like...the result is usually something laughable or just pathetic.  A brilliant case in point is the remake of ""The Haunting"".  The manifestations created there, while imaginative, are entirely ineffective at creating horror, and resulted in a disaster of a movie by the movie's conclusion.  In the original ""Amityville Horror"", the filmmakers do not try to do too much with the movie.  Thus, the saying, sometimes more is less and vice-versa.  What you do have in the original ""Amityville Horror"" is a classic haunted house movie, a great story supposedly based on true events, and a very true murder that happened at the Amityville house so many years ago.  Please see the ""City Confidential"" Amityville for an excellent treatment of that murder.The makers of the original ""Amityville Horror"" knew that the fact that several people were actually murdered in the Amityville house was unsettling enough for the audience.  So, the trick was to accentuate that horror by employing the Lutz's story (which they claim is based on actual events witnessed by them when they lived at the Amityville house) along with the house's morbid history to somehow convince the audience that the house is haunted, and that the house is evil.  I think the filmmakers of the original ""Amityville Horror"" were largely able to pull that off, but such a task does present difficulties of selling it to the audience.Basically, the original ""Amityville Horror"" (notice I say original because there has been a remake...look for my reviews on the remake and the sequels to the original in subsequent reviews) is about a family that moves to the Amityville house after some absolutely brutal murders take place at some point in the house's past.  After moving into the house, strange things begin to happen which are indeed rather small and pedestrian when considering the reputation of modern day horror movies.  However, the makers of the original ""Amityville Horror"" were able to create a scary atmosphere which is absolutely essential to any horror movie's success and effectiveness, especially a horror movie based on a haunted house.  It is this atmosphere present in the ""Amityville Horror"" that gets the viewer's imagination working.  Of course, the manifestations e.g. floating pig with red eyes, that are employed in the ""Amityville Horror"" do help in my opinion to accentuate the horror and the resonance of the scary atmosphere which is clearly present in this movie.Finally, the filmmakers' use of the story itself (which, as viewers' we should be skeptical of the Lutz's motives here) helps in the creation of the horror which is clearly evident in this movie.  The actual story of the Amityville house is presented and driven home to the audience quite well by the quality acting that is present in this movie.  Frankly, Margot Kidder and James Brolin do a hell of a job in this movie, as does the supporting cast.  The question remains however, whether the filmmakers did enough to this movie to make into the best horror movie it could be.  I would argue that they did for the very reason that the story itself has limitations, and therefore the movie has limitations as to how great an effective the movie can be as a horror movie.  I would argue that the original ""Amityville Horror"" is a very good horror movie, and that no horror movie fan's collection is complete without a copy of this DVD, mainly because the original ""Amityville Horror"" and probably ""Burnt Offerings"" are two of the very best haunted house movies ever created, if not the best, period.  I would argue that it is very difficult to make a movie like this work, but clearly the original ""Amityville Horror"" does work quite well, notwithstanding its obvious limitations (lack of manifestations of the evil entities).Perhaps the most effective criticism of ""Amityville Horror"" is its lack of violence within the heart of the movie.  Clearly, the audience gets a good picture of the brutal murders that occurred prior to the Lutz's moving in, but that is in the beginning.  Beyond that, there is not much violence in the movie at all, but that is because the filmmakers were trying to sell the original ""Amityville Horror"" as a TRUE haunted house story.  Now, whether they pulled that off or not is for the viewer to decide.  That being said, I do recommend the original ""Amityville Horror"" to any serious horror movie fan as one of the best haunted house horror movies ever made.",4,"""Where the hell is it!!!!???""

157322,A2BVCT2MPS6LHI,079284677X,Huge Viking,"[1, 2]","I've read the book by Jay Anson as compiled by the alleged account by George and Kathy Lutz and I've also watched the movie starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder. Though based on a ""true"" story about the alleged haunted house on Long Island's south shore some 35 miles east of New York City, the only horror the Lutzes faced, were not ghosts and goblins or any possessive evil spirit during their 28 days of ""terror"", they were financial ones. George could not keep up with the burden of Amityville's taxes and the mortgage he had to pay on the house, which drained him physically that led to frustration and anger moods that affected the entire family. The story was fabricated by the Lutzes in order to sell a story for a financial gain.Three different families resided at the home prior to the DeFeos, and reading the history of the house, it was a dream home built by a couple, John and Catherine Moynahan, back in 1925 who resided there until they died. Their daughter, Eileen Fitzgerald, moved in with her family until she sold the home to a John and Mary Riley in 1960. The Rileys had marriage problems, divorced and sold the house to the DeFeo family in 1965 where they lived nine years until 23 year-old Ronnie ""Butch"" DeFeo murdered his family on the early morning hours of November 14, 1974. This was the only real horror to occur in the normally peaceful Amityville.Butch DeFeo claimed he heard voices prior to the murders, and this was due to his drug addiction to heroin. Aside from the DeFeos with their constant fights and the Lutzes with their financial woes, many other families who have resided there were happy ones. Subsequent residents experienced no problems whatsoever and lived normally as in any other home. The quarter moon windows that gave an ""eerie"" impression as seen on the movie were replaced by square ones. The house used on the film was one that was replicated to look like the real house, but was located in Toms River, NJ. Comparing the movie prop with the real home, the prop had the chimney exposed along the exterior wall, the quarter moon windows were larger and the prop was painted white.

157325,A39VJRIW7HC5C0,079284677X,James Kunz,"[0, 0]","The 1979 horror release The Amityville Horror earned a lot of money and a legion of fans by generating tension and delivering a solid Haunted House picture.  However, under scrutiny the film does not measure up to several other classics of the era.  Whether or not this is based on a true story is of little consequence, for the 119 minutes of the money it can be assumed that a family, the Lutzes, moved into a Long Island home in which a gruesome sextuple murder occured and was harrassed by a demonic presense.  The aforementioned homidices are dealt with well in the script, and soon enough thereafter George Lutz and his wife move in with their three children.  After some character buildup, the house begins to threaten the lives of the Lutzes and a local Priest.As mentioned previously, there are several good sequences in this film, notably some of the ""3:15"" parts and the final night.  Further, the house is great looking, especially when the attic lights make it look alive.  However, the two subplots - the house's attack on the priest and George's money woes- do not work very well.  The former starts out well with the accumulation of the flies, but never really goes anywhere.  Instead the audience is privy to Rod Steiger yelling at the top of his lungs, going blind in a horribly cliched turn, and ultimately losing touch with reality.  Aside from the initial ""fly"" scene there is no horror quotient in this entire series of scenes, and they serve no plot purpose either.  As to Mr. Lutz's financial problems, while they add to his strained character and partially explain his reluctance to leave the cursed house, they never come to a head or matter all that much.  Furthermore, the thought that the house would steal 1,500 dollars from a character's pocket seems a bit forced, especially when this serves no more purpose than to exacerbate the pointless money subplot.Nonetheless, the movie could have succeeded without the alternate plots, but it never really comes together.  Are we truly to beleive that a house which (supposedly) forced a boy to murder his parents and four siblings would think up torments like ooze coming out of a toilet or flies massing in the sewing room?  The movie never goes all-out; I recognize that this was based on a book, but by not killing anyone (nay, even harming anyone beyond the priest's blindness) the film lacks teeth.  Perhaps worth a look, but not a purchase.  **/4",3,"Delivers its share of scares, but ultimately doesn't hold up",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2427,"['1979', 'horror', 'release', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'earned', 'lot', 'money', 'legion', 'fans', 'generating', 'tension', 'delivering', 'solid', 'Haunted', 'House', 'picture', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'several', 'other', 'classics', 'era', 'not', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'little', 'consequence', '119', 'minutes', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'assumed', 'family', 'Lutzes', 'moved', 'Long', 'Island', 'home', 'gruesome', 'sextuple', 'murder', 'occured', 'was', 'harrassed', 'demonic', 'presense', 'aforementioned', 'homidices', 'are', 'dealt', 'well', 'script', 'soon', 'enough', 'thereafter', 'George', 'Lutz', 'wife', 'move', 'three', 'children', 'character', 'buildup', 'house', 'threaten', 'lives', 'Lutzes', 'local', 'Priest.As', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'sequences', 'film', 'notably', '3:15', 'parts', 'final', 'night', 'Further', 'house', 'great', 'looking', 'especially', 'when', 'attic', 'lights', 'make', 'look', 'alive', 'However', 'two', 'subplots', 'house', 'attack', 'priest', 'George', 'money', 'woes-', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'former', 'out', 'well', 'accumulation', 'flies', 'never', 'really', 'anywhere', 'Instead', 'audience', 'privy', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'yelling', 'top', 'lungs', 'going', 'blind', 'horribly', 'cliched', 'turn', 'ultimately', 'losing', 'touch', 'reality', 'Aside', 'initial', 'fly', 'scene', 'horror', 'quotient', 'entire', 'series', 'scenes', 'serve', 'plot', 'purpose', 'either', 'Mr.', 'Lutz', 'financial', 'problems', 'add', 'strained', 'character', 'partially', 'explain', 'reluctance', 'leave', 'cursed', 'house', 'never', 'come', 'head', 'matter', 'that', 'much', 'Furthermore', 'thought', 'house', 'would', 'steal', '1,500', 'dollars', 'character', 'pocket', 'bit', 'forced', 'especially', 'when', 'more', 'purpose', 'exacerbate', 'pointless', 'money', 'subplot.Nonetheless', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'alternate', 'plots', 'never', 'really', 'together', 'Are', 'truly', 'beleive', 'house', 'supposedly', 'forced', 'boy', 'murder', 'parents', 'four', 'siblings', 'would', 'think', 'up', 'torments', 'ooze', 'coming', 'toilet', 'flies', 'massing', 'sewing', 'room', 'movie', 'never', 'all-out', 'recognize', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'not', 'killing', 'anyone', 'nay', 'even', 'harming', 'anyone', 'priest', 'blindness', 'film', 'teeth', 'Perhaps', 'look', 'not', 'purchase', '**/4']",N/A

The Amityville Horror film is loosely based on the real-life account of the son of the Ronald De Feo family who killed all six members of his family sleeping in the house in the middle of the night.  His father and himself had a heated arguement prior.  The book and the film highly fictionalized the supernatural happenings, however two people (one claimed psychic) who had entered the house after the tragic incidents had taken place had their own story to tell and no doubt other owners of the house as well.  In any case, the book became a bestseller and the film was a hit.  This film will give you the creeps.  I suggest  you watch it in the dark for extra goosebumps.James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger offer excellent performances.  Don Stroud is also in this film. You might remember him from The Buddy Holly Story (1978) and Licence To Kill (1989).  Natasha Ryan is one child you may recognize from Sybil (1976-TVM) and The Entity (1983).  K.C.

Mical,"[2, 2]","The Amityville Horror, just in time for Halloween on MGM's value-priced DVDs, is a classic &quot;inspired by a true story&quot; haunted house yarn that offers some pretty decent chills in a nice little package in the digital format.  This is a film that easily stands the test of time as horror, and although isn't as creepy as other classic (and recent) ghost fare, it does much better than some of the CGI-packed trash that passes as &quot;horror&quot; these days.The Amityville Horror, based on a book of the same name, which was in turn based on a (supposedly) true story (later &quot;proved&quot; false), introduces the audience to the Lutz family, who are buying their first house.  When they find a great place on Long Island for an unbelievable price, they jump on it - even though they realize a family of six was murdered there a year ago by a schitzophrenic son.  Soon after they move in, strange stuff starts to happen - the parish priest cannot stay in the house long enough to bless it, doors open and shut of their own accord, and the daughter begins to talk to an invisible friend whom she refuses to describe.Amityville Horror is a horror movie that relies on atmosphere to create the tension, and does so with decent results.  The music is annoying (it was actually a rejected score to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;), and sounds far too much like &quot;Psycho&quot; for its own good.  One of the most commendable aspects of Amityville Horror is that the horror itself isn't revealed physically until the very end of the film, and even then it is only as a fleeting shadow, something that the viewer cannot even be sure he or she saw.  That is, if you don't count the eyes, staring out from the dark.  Remembering that scene is giving me goosebumps as I type this...The DVD itself is obviously bare-bones; it's a single-layer disc with a mono soundtrack, and no extras to speak of except for the trailer.  The audio mix is poor, and voices often change pitch and volume in the same scene (not to mention that sometimes they sound as if they are using entirely different audio tracks in the middle of a scene, which can really detract from the film).  The video, though, is nice and crisp, with none of the lines or artifacts associated with poor transfers.  The print used was fairly clean as well, and colors show up vibrantly, with very few dust speckles throughout (especially considering this is just a value disc).For the price, it's worth picking up.

It was still disturbing today. I munched down my Wendy's single combo and only after digesting fully, did I watch it again after all that time.There are some amusing and upsettling moments. It becomes over the top if you accept the ""This is a True Story."" claim at the beginning.One part that made me jump was when a window suddenly falls on a young boy's hand and his parents can't get the window back up. There was no way to see that coming. I hate seeing kids get hurt, even in the movies.A parapsychologist performed the commentary and I can't really agree with him.He claims that the house was built in Amityville back in 1904. A bad rainstorm caused the skeleton of an old Indian Chef on a horse to pop out of the ground. A kid walking by, pulled off the skull and played football with it. Ever since the skull Football game, the house has had strange occurences. The first family moved the house to a different location in 1928 after poltergiest style activities developed. When the house was moved nothing else happened. A new house was built on the same land in 1928 which leds to the idea that the land is haunted and not the house on the land.In 1974 Ronald Defoe, killed his entire family with a rifle. That did happen, althought I don't really believe the story about the skull being popped off. The dumb thing about it is, none of the Defoe family woke up after the father was shot in the head. No neighbers reported any sounds of gunfire. The parapsychologist tried to claim that the Indian spirits muffled the noises so the attacks could be carried out. I have may doubts about that. I think that Defoe had help from a relative or someone else otherwise it couldn't happen as claimed. The bedroom walls in the Amityville house are so close that you would hear a rifle going off and more than likely make a run for it.But I think the whole thing is a work of fiction, including the past haunting backgrounds, the only thing real was the Defoe Killings.It is an amusing movie to watch today. James Brolin is hairy looking indeed. Imagine Grizzly Adams as a family man up against the supernatural. He had the whole 70's Natural Cool look down (allowing all hair, including facial, to grow out as long as possible.)The priest was covered with honey and real flies landed on his face.Jodie was an imaginery friend of one of the kids in the movie. Jodie appears in the movie as a pig or possible cat with bright red glowing eyes and seems to spring up outside windows for unknown reasons.All in all, a classic retro flick to re-live.Oddly, Jay Anson who wrote the book is dead. The Lutz family who claimed the whole thing was real are both dead. George was the last to die back in May 2006. It is interesting that they got a divorce in the 80's afterwards. But divorce was the In Thing to do in the 80's. It has been rumored that Anson and other writers working on the book and the movie screenplay died of mysterious circumstances. I just don't think an enraged Indian Chef is responsible. The house is stil standing and the current family should have been ran off years ago if the legend is really true.",4,What's with the Weird Cat Thing glaring in the window?,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,3246,"['film', 'scared', 'fried', 'shrimp', 'colon', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'age', '8', 'TV', 'ABC', 'Sunday', 'Night', 'Movie', 'was', 'still', 'disturbing', 'today', 'munched', 'down', 'Wendy', 'single', 'combo', 'only', 'digesting', 'fully', 'did', 'watch', 'again', 'are', 'amusing', 'upsettling', 'moments', 'top', 'accept', 'True', 'Story', 'claim', 'beginning.One', 'part', 'made', 'jump', 'was', 'when', 'window', 'suddenly', 'young', 'boy', 'hand', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'window', 'back', 'up', 'was', 'way', 'see', 'coming', 'hate', 'seeing', 'kids', 'get', 'hurt', 'even', 'movies.A', 'parapsychologist', 'performed', 'commentary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'agree', 'him.He', 'claims', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'Amityville', 'back', '1904', 'bad', 'rainstorm', 'caused', 'skeleton', 'old', 'Indian', 'Chef', 'horse', 'pop', 'ground', 'kid', 'walking', 'pulled', 'off', 'skull', 'played', 'football', 'Ever', 'skull', 'Football', 'game', 'house', 'had', 'strange', 'occurences', 'first', 'family', 'moved', 'house', 'different', 'location', '1928', 'poltergiest', 'style', 'activities', 'developed', 'When', 'house', 'was', 'moved', 'nothing', 'else', 'happened', 'new', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'same', 'land', '1928', 'idea', 'land', 'haunted', 'not', 'house', 'land.In', '1974', 'Ronald', 'Defoe', 'killed', 'entire', 'family', 'rifle', 'did', 'happen', 'althought', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'story', 'skull', 'being', 'popped', 'off', 'dumb', 'thing', 'none', 'Defoe', 'family', 'woke', 'up', 'father', 'was', 'shot', 'head', 'neighbers', 'reported', 'sounds', 'gunfire', 'parapsychologist', 'tried', 'claim', 'Indian', 'spirits', 'muffled', 'noises', 'attacks', 'could', 'be', 'carried', 'have', 'may', 'doubts', 'think', 'Defoe', 'had', 'help', 'relative', 'someone', 'else', 'could', ""n't"", 'happen', 'claimed', 'bedroom', 'walls', 'Amityville', 'house', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'would', 'hear', 'rifle', 'going', 'off', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'run', 'it.But', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'work', 'fiction', 'including', 'past', 'haunting', 'backgrounds', 'only', 'thing', 'real', 'was', 'Defoe', 'Killings.It', 'amusing', 'movie', 'watch', 'today', 'James', 'Brolin', 'hairy', 'looking', 'indeed', 'Imagine', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'family', 'man', 'up', 'supernatural', 'had', 'whole', '70', 'Natural', 'Cool', 'look', 'down', 'allowing', 'hair', 'including', 'facial', 'grow', 'out', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'priest', 'was', 'covered', 'honey', 'real', 'flies', 'landed', 'face.Jodie', 'was', 'imaginery', 'friend', 'one', 'kids', 'movie', 'Jodie', 'movie', 'pig', 'possible', 'cat', 'bright', 'red', 'glowing', 'eyes', 'spring', 'up', 'outside', 'windows', 'unknown', 'reasons.All', 'classic', 'retro', 'flick', 're-live.Oddly', 'Jay', 'Anson', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'dead', 'Lutz', 'family', 'who', 'claimed', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'real', 'are', 'dead', 'George', 'was', 'last', 'die', 'back', 'May', '2006', 'interesting', 'got', 'divorce', '80', 'afterwards', 'divorce', 'was', 'Thing', 'do', '80', 'been', 'rumored', 'Anson', 'other', 'writers', 'working', 'book', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'died', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enraged', 'Indian', 'Chef', 'responsible', 'house', 'stil', 'standing', 'current', 'family', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ran', 'off', 'years', 'ago', 'legend', 'really', 'true']",N/A
157330,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,079284677X,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[18, 21]","I grew up in the 70's.  As such I remember a select few films from that decade that struck fear in my heart at the mere mention of their title.  The Excorcist, The Omen, Dawn of the Dead and The Amityville Horror.  I'd like to say that all of these films held up to the test of time but alas, one just does not make the cut.  Amityville is that film.I'll grant that I was a lot easier to scare in those days and didn't watch films with the critical eye that I do now as a reasonably intelligent adult.  So I expected to be somewhat disillusioned with a movie I'd last seen 27 years earlier.  But upon viewing Amity again, I am amazed that adults were ever scared by this film when it was released much less able to sit through it in its entirety.With apologies to those who revere this film as a classic, The Amityville Horror is just a complete disaster as a film.  Just because it was made in the 70's does not qualify it as a classic.  One must keep in mind that Amityville WAS NOT a B-budget chop job that simply grew a cult following.  This was a major motion picture with big name actors.  It does not get a break for being cheesy or camp because the cheese/camp is completely unintentional on the director's part.  The screenplay is often nonsensical, overly cryptic and repetitive in its attempt to convince us that evil is afoot.  It is clear that the director was trying to achieve a subdued atmosphere of unseen evil as was done successfully in The Excorcist.  But The Excorcist succeeded in achieving this atmosphere because a great deal of care went into preserving the authenticity of the characters and their world through the script and sets.  We believe that the characters we see on the screen in The Excorcist could in fact exist in the real world.  Further, the evil is actually defined in The Excorcist, even if it is not seen in its natural form.  In Amity, the evil is never truly defined in this way.  And the characters, through poor scripting just do not shine through effectively as people we might know in everyday life.  These characters just walk around in a stupor hoping that will be enough to get the idea across that something isn't right.To say that the pacing of the film is wrought would be an understatement.  Amity jumps around from scene to scene completely oblivious to any semblance of a compelling story arc and the editing is awful.  Amityville is just a series of flat, understated scenes depicting a spectre of impending doom that never really manifests itself in any meaningful or frightening way (unless of course you consider disappearing wedding money and James Brolin brooding about for two hours with a bad perm as meaningful and frightening.)There's nothing wrong with watching an old movie as a walk down memory lane.  I do it all the time.  But an old movie doesn't necessarily make a good movie.  Good old movies, while reminding one of the era in which they take place, do not allow that era to become so distracting that one can't still immerse himself in the story and characters.  The Excorcist is the perfect example of a good older movie.  I can sit down to watch that film and am immediately aware of the decade in which it takes place.  But the sets and characters are so well written and depicted that I soon forget and stop caring about what year it takes place in.  All I could think about as I watched Amity was how it REALLY looked like it was made 30 years ago.  It relied entirely too much on cheap, now horribly dated antics like slamming doors and windows and the like to supply the horror.  The horror never got to the psycholigical level as it did in The Excorcist.  Perhaps it's unfair to compare Amity to The Excorcist, but they are often mentioned in the same breath as being two of the better horror films of the 70's.  Amity just does not earn its place in that rare air.

157331,A106016KSI0YQ,079284677X,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","Really first-rate supernatural horror movies are rarer than you'd suspect; but when a film in this genre gets even part way there, you're pretty grateful (given how many truly lousy examples there are). THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is never as good a movie as you'd like it to be, but it was a huge success, in part because so many of the elements of a really topnotch horror film are in it. There's the haunted house concept updated for the contemporary era (so as to include serial killings as well as demons haunting the house), the director Stuart Rosenberg's fine sense of pace, some absolutely fine acting moments from James Brolin and (particularly) Margot Kidder, and most of all the house itself, which although not the actual Amityville house where the DeFeo and Lutz families lived, is a Tom's River, NJ doppelganger that visually approximates the creepy jack-o'-lantern appearance of the original. (Rosenberg wisely allows multiple startling establishing shots of the house--often in colored filters--to emphasize its importance as, in many ways, the main character of the film.)On the other hand, neither Kidder nor Brolin are consistently at their best (as Brolin himself admits in the excellent short feature, ""For God's Sake, Get Out!,"" his performance is not consistent with itself, and at some moments approximates camp), and Rod Steiger gives a completely over-the-top performance as Kathy Lutz's confessor-adviser priest that involves howling, shrieking, and other hysterics. The story is sometimes very jerky (especially at the big climax), and much material seems left out establishing the backstory of the Lutzes, who move into the Long Island mansion where the DeFeo family murders once took place, supposedly on the site (naturally) of a Native American burial ground. But moments in the film still seem to linger: the house vocally insisting Steiger leave it, the red eyes of a demon staring in through a window at a terrified Kidder, Brolin maniacally sharpening and re-sharpening his double-bladed axe, and the image of the house itself glowering balefully in the dark night all seem to have entered to some degree or another our shared horror lexicon.",3,The fixer-upper,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,2173,"['Really', 'first-rate', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'rarer', ""'d"", 'suspect', 'when', 'film', 'genre', 'even', 'part', 'way', 'there', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'grateful', 'given', 'how', 'many', 'truly', 'lousy', 'examples', 'are', 'AMITYVILLE', 'HORROR', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'part', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'really', 'topnotch', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'haunted', 'house', 'concept', 'updated', 'contemporary', 'era', 'so', 'include', 'serial', 'killings', 'as', 'well', 'demons', 'haunting', 'house', 'director', 'Stuart', 'Rosenberg', 'fine', 'sense', 'pace', 'absolutely', 'fine', 'acting', 'moments', 'James', 'Brolin', 'particularly', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'most', 'house', 'not', 'actual', 'Amityville', 'house', 'where', 'DeFeo', 'Lutz', 'families', 'lived', 'Tom', 'River', 'NJ', 'doppelganger', 'visually', 'creepy', ""jack-o'-lantern"", 'appearance', 'original', 'Rosenberg', 'wisely', 'multiple', 'startling', 'establishing', 'shots', 'house', 'often', 'colored', 'filters', 'emphasize', 'importance', 'many', 'ways', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Kidder', 'Brolin', 'are', 'consistently', 'best', 'Brolin', 'excellent', 'short', 'feature', 'God', 'Sake', 'Get', 'Out', 'performance', 'not', 'consistent', 'moments', 'approximates', 'camp', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'confessor-adviser', 'priest', 'howling', 'shrieking', 'other', 'hysterics', 'story', 'sometimes', 'very', 'jerky', 'especially', 'big', 'climax', 'much', 'material', 'left', 'out', 'establishing', 'backstory', 'Lutzes', 'who', 'move', 'Long', 'Island', 'mansion', 'where', 'DeFeo', 'family', 'murders', 'once', 'took', 'place', 'supposedly', 'site', 'naturally', 'Native', 'American', 'burial', 'ground', 'moments', 'film', 'still', 'seem', 'linger', 'house', 'vocally', 'insisting', 'Steiger', 'leave', 'red', 'eyes', 'demon', 'staring', 'window', 'terrified', 'Kidder', 'Brolin', 'maniacally', 'sharpening', 're-sharpening', 'double-bladed', 'axe', 'image', 'house', 'glowering', 'balefully', 'dark', 'night', 'seem', 'have', 'entered', 'degree', 'shared', 'horror', 'lexicon']",N/A

Brolin and Kidder star as George and Kathy Lutz, newlyweds who are looking to purchase a new home for their family.  The house they choose was the scene of six grisly murders committed by Ronnie DeFeo a year earlier.  Undaunted, the Lutz family moves in.Almost immediately, strange things begin happening.  Father Delaney, played brilliantly by Rod Steiger, comes to bless the house, but he is soon set upon by a swarm of flies and told by an unseen voice to ""get out"".  After fleeing the house, he becomes violently ill and is haunted by what occurred while he was there.Strange things are happening to the Lutzes as well.  Kathy's brother has $1500 simply vanish from his coat pocket, her aunt suffers the same sickness as Father Delaney, and George is constantly cold.Father Delaney believes that there is an evil presence inside the house, but his fellow priests are not convinced.  Still, he says a private mass for the Lutz family, but he cannot escape the presence even while in his own church; he loses his sight during the mass.  Finally, after twenty eight days of horror and unexplained occurances, the Lutz family flees their home; never to return for their possessions.This is a classic haunted house tale.  Brolin and Kidder are excellent as George and Kathy, but its Rod Steiger's memorable performance as the troubled Father Delaney that makes this movie so good.  His portrayal of the compassionate yet unbelieved priest who only has the Lutzes best interests at heart is tremendous.

157337,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,079284677X,J. Michael Click,"[1, 2]","In the three-plus decades since its 1979 theatrical release, ""The Amityville Horror"" has lost its original edge.  Time, coupled with the improved special effects and film techniques displayed in subsequent horror films, has not been kind to this pedantic fright-fest, which was, inexplicably, a huge hit in its day.  Audiences at the time were attracted to the film because it was allegedly based on a ""true story"" which had been the subject of a best-selling novel ... I wonder how many movie-goers noticed the disclaimer at the end of the credits noting that some characters and incidents had been altered ""for dramatic effect""?  (So much for its ""docudrama"" credentials!)Certainly the film's plot was already a clich&eacute; in 1979, and is still one today.  It's Basic Horror Script #13, the one in which family moves into a house that is haunted by satanic forces because of the evil events that took place within its walls in the past.  And of course the family is too stupidly stubborn to move out when things ""go wrong"" ... in this instance, the Lutzes find out that their basement is a Passage to Hell, and still they stay!I'd like to be able to report that the cast does their best with the material, but in truth, only James Brolin as the patriarch of the family builds much of a character - and even he (as he admits in an interview included on the DVD) sometimes goes way over the top.  Margot Kidder is defeated by her costumes and hairstyles - she's supposed to be the mother of three children, but in her girls' boarding school uniforms and her pigtails, she comes off as an overgrown (and annoying) Lolita.  Rod Steiger as the family's priest is the absolute worst: he chews up the scenery as if he hasn't been fed in a decade.  It occurred to me as Steiger screamed and raved and wailed, that in a just world, he would have been forced to return his Best Actor Oscar (for 1967's ""in the Heat of the Night"") to the Academy as punishment for his hammy emoting here.That interview with James Brolin that I mentioned earlier is actually the best thing on the 2005 MGM DVD.  It's part of the documentary extra, ""For God's Sake, Get Out!""  In it, Brolin discusses the making of the movie with a charming, gently mocking, and graciously self-deprecating lilt in his voice and a twinkle in his eye.  Margot Kidder is also interviewed - separately.  Both she and Brolin tactfully admit that the differences in their approaches to acting caused friction between them during the filming.  The particular edition of the DVD also includes the theatrical trailer, radio spots and a commentary by a parapsychologist, and it features an excellent sound and video transfer.  Too bad the movie itself is such a turkey!  Recommended only to those in the mood for some campy, tongue-in-cheek fun; real horror buffs won't find this at all frightening.",2,"The ""Making Of"" Documentary is Better Than the Film!",1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,2848,"['three-plus', 'decades', '1979', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'lost', 'original', 'edge', 'Time', 'coupled', 'improved', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'techniques', 'displayed', 'subsequent', 'horror', 'films', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'pedantic', 'fright-fest', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'huge', 'hit', 'day', 'Audiences', 'time', 'were', 'attracted', 'film', 'was', 'allegedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'subject', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'movie-goers', 'noticed', 'disclaimer', 'end', 'credits', 'noting', 'characters', 'incidents', 'had', 'been', 'altered', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'So', 'much', 'docudrama', 'credentials', 'Certainly', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'already', 'clich', 'eacute', '1979', 'still', 'one', 'today', 'Basic', 'Horror', 'Script', '13', 'one', 'family', 'house', 'haunted', 'satanic', 'forces', 'evil', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'walls', 'past', 'course', 'family', 'too', 'stupidly', 'stubborn', 'move', 'out', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'instance', 'Lutzes', 'find', 'out', 'basement', 'Passage', 'Hell', 'still', 'stay', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'able', 'report', 'cast', 'best', 'material', 'truth', 'only', 'James', 'Brolin', 'patriarch', 'family', 'much', 'character', 'even', 'interview', 'included', 'DVD', 'sometimes', 'way', 'top', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'defeated', 'costumes', 'hairstyles', 'supposed', 'be', 'mother', 'three', 'children', 'girls', 'boarding', 'school', 'uniforms', 'pigtails', 'off', 'overgrown', 'annoying', 'Lolita', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'family', 'priest', 'absolute', 'worst', 'up', 'scenery', ""n't"", 'been', 'fed', 'decade', 'occurred', 'Steiger', 'screamed', 'raved', 'wailed', 'just', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'return', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', '1967', 'Heat', 'Night', 'Academy', 'punishment', 'hammy', 'emoting', 'here.That', 'interview', 'James', 'Brolin', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'actually', 'best', 'thing', '2005', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'part', 'documentary', 'extra', 'God', 'Sake', 'Get', 'Out', 'Brolin', 'making', 'movie', 'charming', 'gently', 'mocking', 'graciously', 'self-deprecating', 'lilt', 'voice', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'also', 'interviewed', 'separately', 'Brolin', 'tactfully', 'admit', 'differences', 'approaches', 'acting', 'caused', 'friction', 'filming', 'particular', 'edition', 'DVD', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'radio', 'spots', 'commentary', 'parapsychologist', 'excellent', 'sound', 'video', 'transfer', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'such', 'turkey', 'Recommended', 'only', 'mood', 'campy', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'fun', 'real', 'horror', 'buffs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'frightening']",N/A

When you watch Amityville Horror, it's like a punsihment to your brain and you deserve so much better to kill some time. This movie is supposed to be scary right? Well, if this is scary then Looney Tunes are too. Amityville Horror is simply not scary at all, even worse, it's just bad from start to finish. Running two long hours in length, the film is too long and doesn't even have a satisfying ending. It kind of leaves you hanging. Some people as I see by the review board, really seem to enjoy this garbage, but I think they're just drawn to it's reputation. But believe me, it's not scary and it's not a good movie by an sense of the word. If it came out today, the movie would be PG 13. There's really no redeeming qualities in this trash. No gore or anything really disturbing to make you cringe, heck, nobody even dies. The movie focuses on an idiotic family that moved into the cursed house and the entity basically just causes little problems for the family. Amazingly, the movie is based on a true story, but I'm sorry, people cannot be this dumb.The Amityville Horror is a story about a cursed house that makes a husband grumpy and causes fights between him and his wife. Oh, he also scolds his kids more with the evil demons by his side. Well, that's the movie in a nutshell. The so-so acting is only 1/2 of the problem. It's very slow paced, make sure you have coffee by your side to keep you awake.  The shortlived visit from the priest was about the best part of the movie, those flies were a bit disturbing to see crawling in his mouth. The demon or entitys in the house don't really make any grand appearances during the whole film, they just annoy the family and they leave when the movie is over. Perhaps the real story of the house is scary, but the way this movie is portrayed says other wise, the actors look bored.There are so many other better movies of this genre, the Exorcist, The Ring, Blair Witch, Prom Night, Halloween, Friday the 13th,  and other trippy thrillers that are worth your hard earned dough. If you want retro and crave Amityville, take a look at the Amityville Horror II: The Possession. While not based on the actual true story, it's clearly the best Amityville movie of the series, give that a whack before subjecting yourself to this vile movie.I do have to say, the movie has been cleaned up a lot and looks a lot better than the cruddy VHS versions, but the looks, better sound and good picture can't make this a good movie.

A family of six had been murdered in a Long Island, New York home on November 13, 1974. A year or so later George and Kathy Lutz moved into this Long Island home. When the Lutz family moves in, strange events start to take place, such as walls that drip blood, rooms with swarms of flies, rocking chairs that rock by themselves, and toilets with pitch black water with the appearance of tar. It seems as though some Satanic presence is in the house. There is even what seems to be a portal to Hell in the basement. The Lutzes must try to escape this house they had moved into just 28 days earlier. Can they do it?This movie is what I would classify as a good, but not great, horror movie.  It's definitely not in my all-time Top 5 list of haunted house movies, but it's in the Top 10, perhaps in eighth place.  The story itself has been controversial from the very beginning, with many claiming it's a hoax. This has never been proven. Regardless of whether it's a hoax or not, it's a good horror movie to watch on Halloween night. On the plus side, this movie's greatest thing it has going for it is its musical score, especially the main theme.  Very creepy.  In a close second is the autumn atmosphere.  We also get to see Margot Kidder in pigtails! Gotta love the '70s.  Kidder also shows some skin.  The lighting inside the house at night in the dark is very well done, too.  It really adds to the creepiness of the film.  On the negative side, the movie has some boring parts.  That's the movie's greatest weakness.  Also, this movie, in my opinion, borrows from other horror movies that were released during the 1960s and 1970s, even if it's in a very subtle way.All in all, a good haunted house movie.

Yet after all this time and with the knowledge that the book was a hoax--I still found this movie to be very scarey.  Except for the unecessary--and poorly done--flash-backs of the original murders in the beginning while the realestate agent is showing the house to Kidder and Brolin, this is a very well directed movie.  The tiniest subtle things in the beginning leading to less subtle events later on is what makes a horror movie great.  Like when after the realestate agent is alone in the kitchen, sorting her contracts after she made the sale:  a subtle breeze rustles her papers.  She looks around quickly and abruptly packs up her things and leaves.  I just wish I could edit out those flashbacks which almost seems like it wasn't the intended work of the director.  Oh well, aside from those brief 45 seconds, the rest of the movie is great.  Also note Helen Shaver (Poltergiest: the Legacy) in an early role as a psychic.  This movie predates the original Poltergeist movie but is much more frightening and with less flash.  I would put this on the same level as the original &quot;The Haunting,&quot; &quot;The Haunting of Hell House,&quot; &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; &quot;Ghost Story.&quot;  If you liked those, you will like this.

157350,A356TJCTCLDN89,079284677X,Kimberley Wilson,"[3, 5]","Amityville Horror is cheesy--processed cheese at that but there are several scenes in the movie where it rises to the level of the finest cheddar. George and Kathy Lutz are newlyweds, they've just bought a big old Dutch colonial house for a pittance. Right after moving in Kathy turns to her husband and is just shinning with joy. She is the first person in her working class family to own a home. It's a lovely moment. Life is good for the Lutz family. George has a successful business, he's financially comfortable and has aparently adopted her kids and treats them as his own. The movie makes it clear that this nice little family deserves peaches and cream. They're about to get black flies and the kind of slime that is found on decomposing bodies.The movie starts out well and then makes the first of a series of mistakes. Rod Steiger. Oh man, Rod Stieger performed like a dancing canned ham. He's horrible as Father Delaney an old priest who realizes that something is wrong in the Lutz house and reacts like a thirteen year old seminarian. When he goes to bless the house the demon/ghosts get upset and drive him out. Okay, that's fine, Rod over does it in this scene but it's fairly short and you can ignore it but then movie goes back to Steiger. He's semi recovered from his experience at the house and miles away in his church attempts to do (the audience assumes)an exocorcism of the Lutz house and is attacked again. This time he screams and carries on and is driven into a catatonic state. I guess Steiger must have demanded that he be given a meaty scene and was accomodated but this scene makes no sense. Ghost stories have rules and this scene smashes one of the oldest ones. If the demon can leave the Lutz property why doesn't it? It ought to be harrassing the neighbors or scaring people at the Amityville lovers lane but it doesn't. The thing freaks out when a priest comes into the house so how is it able to enter a church? The alternate explanation that Father Delaney has just imagined the church scene and had a stroke works better but the whole scene was annoying and takes away from the movie. The Father Delaney scenes should've been as short as the scene where Kathy Lutz's aunt, a nun finds that she can't stay in the house for more than five minutes and leaves.Now back to the good stuff. James Brolin played the role of his life as George Lutz. George is a big lovable lug and it's delightfully creepy to watch him change. He's cold all the time and isn't sleeping, he's also neglecting his hygiene. His hair and face are unwashed, and there are dark circles under his eyes. You get the impression that he doesn't smell too hot either. Margot Kidder as Kathy is so busy getting the house in order that she doesn't notice until very late in the movie. Her husband is going crazy. He's either ignoring the kids or snarling at them, his business is going to pot, and ole Geoge has developed an usually close attachment to his axe. Oh, and he's starting to look just like the son of the first family to live in the house, the kid heard voices one night and chopped up his whole family.The movie moves along a steady clip. There's a great scene where the house demons steal George's money, there's another fine scene where the audience and Kathy realize that her daughter's imaginary friend is real and in another scene George gets a glimpse of what he looks like and is horrified. The house is stalking the family like a cat with a mouse and when it feels certain that it has them it goes for the final attack.Amityville is not a great film but it's not too shabby either.

157352,A2NJO6YE954DBH,079284677X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","The last time I saw a story about the infamous house from ""The Amityville Horror"" on television I saw that the current owners had changed the telltale pair of quarter-moon windows that served as the house's ""eyes"" in the movie posters and the film itself. Doing so has made driving buy the house in Amityville, Long Island a disappointment (amazing how changing two windows can make such a difference in the look of a house). Unfortunately there is nothing that would serve the same function of turning people away from watching this film.I had read Jay Anson's ""nonfiction"" novel before I saw the movie, so I was keenly aware of any changes in the screenplay by Sandor Stern. But it was quickly clear that the biggest difference, which most affected the film, was that the documentary aspect of the novel (i.e., the idea that this was a TRUE STORY that had REALLY HAPPENED) was lost. The story is of the Lutz family, George (James Brolin), Kathy (Margot Kidder), and their three kids who move into this house in Amityville. Nobody bothered to tell them that a year earlier the house had been the scene of a mass murder, or that the place is built on an Indian burial ground. Either one of these things would explain why toilets start spurting black goo, flies start covering the windows, and blood starts seeping from the walls. Rod Steiger somehow shows up as a priest who tries to do a low-rent exorcism on the house, only to see the house win. Then comes the LAST NIGHT in which the Lutz's are driven from their home by the final cascade of evil things going bump in the night.Any movie in which a pig with glowing eyes is the embodiment of all evil is not going to fare well, and ""The Amityville Horror"" is just too cheesy to succeed. This is one of those films that might have worked better if the three name stars had been replaced by unfamiliar faces. Otherwise you are periodically distracted from the proceedings by thoughts of how low the film careers of Brolin, Kidder, and Steiger had sunk at that time. When George goes off the deep end and starts screaming it is rather laughable. The usual comparison of ""The Amityville Horror"" is with ""The Exorcist,"" as a way of making this 1979 look bad in comparison, but a better comparison, and equally devastating to this film's reputation, would be to compare it with ""Poltergeist,"" which does a much better job of driving a family (of much better actors) out of their happy home.Their are a incredibly long list of bad sequels to this film: a pair of theatrical releases, ""Amityville II: The Possession"" (1982) and ""Amityville 3-D"" (1983); a pair of television movies, ""Amityville: The Evil Escapes"" (1989) and ""Amityville 1992: It's About Time"" (2000); and some direct to video efforts in ""The Amityville Curse"" (1990), ""Amityville 1992: It's About Time"" (1992), ""Amityville: A New Generation"" (1993), and ""Amityville: Dollhouse"" (1997).

Few movies serve as a better example of this idea than ""The Amityville Horror,"" which sits unshakeably near the top of my all-time horror movie list.This is a brooding movie that unnerves the viewer with some of the spookiest scenes in horror history. But, wild-eyed monsters don't lunge from the screen. Instead they reside in closets or in the room at the top of the stairs, unseen and yet powerfully menacing.When the camera forces you to stand inside that empty room with the priest, as flies gather on the window sill and the door slams shut, you want to hurl yourself through the window to escape. When you see the closet door swing shut on the babysitter, you want to burrow your way through the wall with bloody fingers to flee that claustrophobic darkness. This is a movie that places you directly in the center of the nastiness and won't let you go. The haunting music doesn't help, either. What is more terrifying than the singing voices of children in the darkness?Another strength of the flick is the witnessing of Brolin's character slowly coming unraveled as he seeks to maintain control out of the growing terror around him.

157361,APOUYO1BEPK22,079284677X,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[0, 1]","In 1974, Ronald DeFeo brutally massacred his entire family via shotgun blasts while they were sleeping in their beds. One year later, the Lutz family moves into the same house. With 3 kids, it was too sweet a deal to pass up and was exactly what George and Kathy were looking for. And then just after a few days of moving in, strange things begin to occur. Most notably with George and also with their only daughter Amy. George seems to always be freezing cold and is starting to become less of the man than the family knows. While daddy is beginning to go insane, Amy is making a new friend, who seems to be imaginary, that is if imaginary friends can rock in a rocking chair and lock people in closets. To make matters worse, Kathy is friends with a lot of Priests and Nuns and asks for Father Delaney to come and bless the house. While no one is inside, Father Delaney begins to bless the passive house, to only piss it off. As the little occurrences start to become bigger, the family has to make a decision to stay and fight... or just get the hell out.I still think this movie has some decent scares in it. Especially if you aren't immune to scary movies yet. The first time I saw this movie, the scene with Father Delaney in the room of flies, freaked me out. It was so quiet and then `BAM' so loud. Really scary... especially if it happened. I also thought the flow of the movie was nice. It wasn't fast nor was it too slow. I can see it being a little slower than most would like though, but I just thought it was good development. Of course there were some things I just didn't like and that was a lot of the scenes with the priests. I only liked Delaney and that was it, everyone else annoyed me. I also thought a lot of the ending was just plain hokey. Since the movie is supposed to be a true story (and I believe in ghosts), I can believe most of the movie. But the ending was just dumb. Also the effects they used for Amy's imaginary friend was pretty bad and made the movie look really amateur in those parts.In the end, give it a rent. Unless you're a horror buff, then you'd probably want to own this classic.P.S. - I woulda went back for the dog also.",3,GET OUT!,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,2170,"['1974', 'Ronald', 'DeFeo', 'brutally', 'massacred', 'entire', 'family', 'shotgun', 'blasts', 'were', 'sleeping', 'beds', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'Lutz', 'family', 'same', 'house', '3', 'kids', 'was', 'too', 'sweet', 'deal', 'pass', 'up', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'George', 'Kathy', 'were', 'looking', 'then', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'moving', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'occur', 'Most', 'notably', 'George', 'also', 'only', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'George', 'always', 'be', 'freezing', 'cold', 'starting', 'become', 'less', 'man', 'family', 'daddy', 'beginning', 'go', 'insane', 'Amy', 'making', 'new', 'friend', 'who', 'be', 'imaginary', 'imaginary', 'friends', 'can', 'rock', 'rocking', 'chair', 'lock', 'people', 'closets', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Kathy', 'friends', 'lot', 'Priests', 'Nuns', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'come', 'bless', 'house', 'one', 'inside', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'bless', 'passive', 'house', 'only', 'piss', 'off', 'little', 'occurrences', 'start', 'become', 'bigger', 'family', 'make', 'decision', 'stay', 'fight', 'just', 'get', 'hell', 'out.I', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'decent', 'scares', 'Especially', 'are', ""n't"", 'immune', 'scary', 'movies', 'yet', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'scene', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'room', 'flies', 'freaked', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'quiet', 'then', 'BAM', 'so', 'loud', 'Really', 'scary', 'especially', 'happened', 'also', 'thought', 'flow', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'was', ""n't"", 'fast', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'can', 'see', 'being', 'little', 'slower', 'most', 'would', 'like', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'development', 'course', 'were', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'lot', 'scenes', 'priests', 'only', 'liked', 'Delaney', 'was', 'everyone', 'else', 'annoyed', 'also', 'thought', 'lot', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'hokey', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'can', 'believe', 'most', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'dumb', 'Also', 'effects', 'used', 'Amy', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'really', 'amateur', 'end', 'give', 'rent', ""'re"", 'horror', 'buff', 'then', ""'d"", 'probably', 'want', 'own', 'classic.P.S', 'woulda', 'went', 'back', 'dog', 'also']",N/A

It is regarded as a sort of ""classic"" horror film.. but It's not my taste, I dont scare easy and this one provided no scares to me at all.After finally seeing this movie after being told to see it, it's been a long, and disapointing wait. For some reason parts 2,3 & 4 were available here, but not part 1. I didnt think much of any of the sequels to this movie, but after vewing the so called ""original and the best"" I guess I am just not any kind of fan of this particuler story.Based on the true story of a house in a town called Amittyville it stars whats his face and Lous Lane... the story is about a happy fammily who move into a house where a man had killed his entire family, who eventualy it was claimed he was possesed. The same thing is happening to the Lutz familly when they move in, there perfect loving family starts to demolish when they realise they have moved into a house from hell with a dooryway *laughing* to hell.It has all the ""hollywood"" B.S put into it, even on the audio commantary, the doctor is telling you what is real, and what Hollywood made up, and you can work it out for yourself that the walls did not bleed, no preist was told to get out, there was no portal to hell under the stairs... infact, the real story has nothing to do with Satan or Hell at all.I found the movie pretty lame, I know so many people love it and think it's a scary movie, but I'm hard to impress. I did not enjoy the film at all.The bonus features onm the other hand are great. The audio commantary from the man brought into the house to investigate it first talks about what really happend, and whats been lost in translation with the film. He also explains how things came about, what happend, the story behind why somebody claimed it was a hoax, the issues with Amityville, and the REAL explination to whats going on. They are documentries from the hisroty channel. There is also some behind the scene/reunion interviews... they actualy say they didnt get along, they dont use that ""oh, we had a great time, he's wonderfull to work with"" garbage.

157375,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,079284677X,OverTheMoon,"[1, 1]","For over a decade now rumors have been circulating that The Amityville Horror was a load of bunk. Most of this is derived from a book called - The Amityville Horror Conspiracy by Stephen Kaplan. However Kaplan's book is a work of theory! Kaplan wrote his book because he was refused permission to visit the house by the owners - the Lutzes, because he turned up on their doorstep, albeit invited, acting as a parapsychologist ... but had a television crew with him. The Lutzes refused him entry because they did not want the media involved and instead opted for demonologists - Ed and Lorraine Warren to help them with their problems. When the story became big news Kaplan immediately set out to ""expose"" the case. Most of Kaplan's views on this hoax are based on the fact that the book is not entirely accurate. However the Warrens and the Lutzes also agree that much poetic license has been used by the book's publishers and writer. Kaplan also claimed to have been inside the house at the time of the haunting but was only ever in the house once - as a guest at a party after the fact. Whatever way you want to look at it Kaplan is one of two people to claim that he has evidence to suggest that this is one big hoax and his evidence can be refuted. The other is a ""lawyer"" called William Weber who wanted to write a book about a murder than took place in the house some years back when a man called DeFeo murdered his own family there. DeFeo claimed that ""spirits"" made him do it. Weber was invited to the house because he had defended DeFeo at his trial. Weber wanted to write his own book but was beaten to it and also did not get DeFeo off the hook. Weber claimed that he came up with the idea of a haunted house story with Lutz over a bottle of wine - but George Lutz does not drink. However we can not draw a positive from a false negative and it still well may be a hoax, but it has yet to be debunked. Contrary to popular belief - the Lutzes have never said that this was a hoax and it still stands today, mostly because a priest also witnessed the strange activity at the house.The truth be told that the book does stretch the facts and has made some things up. Since the movie is based on the book and also stretches the facts, well there ya go really. It is now mostly fiction, however if you read some books from Ed and Lorraine Warren you will get bits of the true story.The film has not aged well since its release and certainly is extremely boring in parts where nothing happens at all. However when things do get going they still carry the ability to shock. Just do not expect an action packed horror movie here and you will do fine. Certainly Amityville 2 and 3 have much more going on in them than this one. The Amityville Horror was written by Jay Anson in August 1977. The film was released in 1979. The Exorcist had been out since 1973 and the scenes from Amityville involving priests are nowhere near as good as The Exorcist and are extremely contrived from that movie. The Amityville Horror also features a detective type character that appears to have been lifted right out from The Exorcist also, down to little details like the moustache and the coat he wears. However if we are going to blaming spin-offs and rip-offs then we must also including Stephen King's The Shining, which came out two months after Anson's book with yet another mad axe-man ending! I believe that King was influenced by this story for his Shining but that is a matter of conjecture, but the similarities are striking. So before Kubrick was shooting Jack Nicholson chopping down doors to hack up the family, old George Lutz, played by James Brolin, was the original family hatchet man right here!All in all The Amityville Horror has the look and feel of a television movie. It can be prolonged in parts and you will be bored to death waiting for something to happen. Halfway through the movie, the priests become the central characters of focus however it feels as if they have nothing really to do with the film, nor do they have any impact on the ending. The same goes for the detective who ends up doing nothing. Truth be told there are very few horrors in this movie, but just barely enough to keep you alive and watching it. Again don't go expecting an action packed horror film and you will probably enjoy it a lot more.",3,It has not aged that well but is still very interesting.,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,4329,"['decade', 'now', 'rumors', 'have', 'been', 'circulating', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', 'load', 'bunk', 'Most', 'derived', 'book', 'called', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Conspiracy', 'Stephen', 'Kaplan', 'However', 'Kaplan', 'book', 'work', 'theory', 'Kaplan', 'wrote', 'book', 'was', 'refused', 'permission', 'visit', 'house', 'owners', 'Lutzes', 'turned', 'up', 'doorstep', 'albeit', 'invited', 'acting', 'parapsychologist', 'had', 'television', 'crew', 'Lutzes', 'refused', 'entry', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'media', 'involved', 'instead', 'opted', 'demonologists', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'help', 'problems', 'When', 'story', 'became', 'big', 'news', 'Kaplan', 'immediately', 'set', 'out', 'expose', 'case', 'Most', 'Kaplan', 'views', 'hoax', 'are', 'based', 'fact', 'book', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'However', 'Warrens', 'Lutzes', 'also', 'agree', 'much', 'poetic', 'license', 'been', 'used', 'book', 'publishers', 'writer', 'Kaplan', 'also', 'claimed', 'have', 'been', 'house', 'time', 'haunting', 'was', 'only', 'ever', 'house', 'once', 'guest', 'party', 'fact', 'way', 'want', 'look', 'Kaplan', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'claim', 'evidence', 'suggest', 'one', 'big', 'hoax', 'evidence', 'can', 'be', 'refuted', 'other', 'lawyer', 'called', 'William', 'Weber', 'who', 'wanted', 'write', 'book', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'house', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'man', 'called', 'DeFeo', 'murdered', 'own', 'family', 'there', 'DeFeo', 'claimed', 'spirits', 'made', 'do', 'Weber', 'was', 'invited', 'house', 'had', 'defended', 'DeFeo', 'trial', 'Weber', 'wanted', 'write', 'own', 'book', 'was', 'beaten', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'DeFeo', 'hook', 'Weber', 'claimed', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'Lutz', 'bottle', 'wine', 'George', 'Lutz', 'not', 'drink', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'draw', 'positive', 'false', 'negative', 'still', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'hoax', 'yet', 'be', 'debunked', 'Contrary', 'popular', 'belief', 'Lutzes', 'have', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'hoax', 'still', 'today', 'mostly', 'priest', 'also', 'witnessed', 'strange', 'activity', 'house.The', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'book', 'stretch', 'facts', 'made', 'things', 'up', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'also', 'facts', 'well', 'there', 'ya', 'go', 'really', 'now', 'mostly', 'fiction', 'however', 'read', 'books', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'will', 'get', 'bits', 'true', 'story.The', 'film', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'release', 'certainly', 'extremely', 'boring', 'parts', 'where', 'nothing', 'However', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'get', 'going', 'still', 'carry', 'ability', 'shock', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'action', 'packed', 'horror', 'movie', 'here', 'will', 'do', 'fine', 'Certainly', 'Amityville', '2', '3', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'one', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', 'written', 'Jay', 'Anson', 'August', '1977', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1979', 'Exorcist', 'had', 'been', 'out', '1973', 'scenes', 'Amityville', 'involving', 'priests', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'Exorcist', 'are', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'movie', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'also', 'detective', 'type', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'right', 'Exorcist', 'also', 'down', 'little', 'details', 'moustache', 'coat', 'However', 'are', 'going', 'blaming', 'spin-offs', 'rip-offs', 'then', 'must', 'also', 'including', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Shining', 'came', 'out', 'two', 'months', 'Anson', 'book', 'yet', 'mad', 'axe-man', 'ending', 'believe', 'King', 'was', 'influenced', 'story', 'Shining', 'matter', 'conjecture', 'similarities', 'are', 'striking', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'shooting', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'chopping', 'down', 'doors', 'hack', 'up', 'family', 'old', 'George', 'Lutz', 'played', 'James', 'Brolin', 'was', 'original', 'family', 'hatchet', 'man', 'right', 'here', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'look', 'feel', 'television', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'prolonged', 'parts', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'death', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'priests', 'become', 'central', 'characters', 'focus', 'however', 'have', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'impact', 'ending', 'same', 'detective', 'who', 'up', 'doing', 'nothing', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'horrors', 'movie', 'just', 'barely', 'enough', 'keep', 'alive', 'watching', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'action', 'packed', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'more']",N/A
157376,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,079284677X,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","The Amityville Horror has gone down in time as one of the most popular and enjoyed haunted house flicks.Part of this intrigue may lie in the fact that it was reputably based on true events. Whether what happened in the book by Jan Ansen was actually accurate or not, the movie went in an almost completely different direction in terms of incidents with the cast involved. Personally I found the giant pig thing from the written version creepy as all hell, but sadly the movie left this out. The film itself was well-done and interesting in its own right, and not much really irks me more than people basing their thoughts on movie adaptations that came from books they either loved or loathed.The plot, if you don't know it yet, surrounds a semi-large family (Wife, hubby, and three kids), moving into a house where a previous murder took place. The Defeo son had murdered his folks and all his siblings, and now the house is up for sale - cheap - for any folks in the market. But soon after moving in, their 'dream come true' turns out to be a nightmare, and 28 days after first setting up to play house, they practically break their necks trying to get out.For the acting, Margot Kidder plays Kathy Lutz and does an excellent job. Much better than the superman movie, she is convincingly paranoid, stressed out, full of rage when its needed and terrified. Her husband, George, does his job -- a man almost over the edge. It think the giant size of the man and his beard make him creepy enough without all the paranormal jeebie creepies. The children are annoying and are creepy in their own way (Even though they're probably not meant to be).And who can forget that house!?! The windows, everything, perfect! The music score for the film (Lalo Schifrin) was nominated for an Oscar award, so obviously this gets high brownie points with me.Other than some quick flashes at the beginning of the movie, there's not much violence, but there is excellent buildup of tension and suspense; the kitchen scene where Kathy is looking over her shoulder actually makes you feel her unease. The lack of blood and killings shouldn't turn you off, however, for it's a quiet and chilling tale where you grow to care about the couple and their children.Some of the scenes with the priest were almost silly but I did like a few things about it. For one thing this wasn't one of those religious based movies where a person just walks in and waves a cross, with a priest around quoting from the bible. The ending wraps up well - the evil is too much, it can't be beat, so they just leave. No good conquers evil here, folks.Where the statue almost moves (that lion thing was creepy enough already! Why do people actually put these evil looking statues in their house!?! It's almost asking for trouble!) also raises the blood pressure a notch. The rooms and the scenery/set up of the house delivers on this level as well, enhancing the fear you could expect. This movie was directed so well you could place yourself in their shoes quite easily. Unfortunately, some things about the film show its age, especially at the ending. After all that had gone on they resort to blood oozing down the walls. Then again perhaps this was the first movie to do this -- if so, it wouldn't have looked so cheesy and offbeat back then.Some people have expressed dismay about going back for the dog Harry, finding it unrealistic. I don't. Some people enough about their animals, and George seems like one of those take-charge, dominant guys who may do that sort of thing. He also seems like he wouldn't be the biggest animal lover either. I guess this is one of those plot tidbits everyone has to make up their own mind about.Some have complained that this was boring. I didn't find this to be true at all but I can see where some people who prefer more high-paced or violent/gory flicks may think so. Overall, though, I find Amityville a classic haunting movie in the true sense, and think every horror fan owes it to themselves to at least give it a try.",4,Excellent,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4019,"['Amityville', 'Horror', 'gone', 'down', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'enjoyed', 'haunted', 'house', 'flicks.Part', 'intrigue', 'may', 'lie', 'fact', 'was', 'reputably', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'what', 'happened', 'book', 'Jan', 'Ansen', 'was', 'actually', 'accurate', 'not', 'movie', 'went', 'almost', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'terms', 'incidents', 'cast', 'involved', 'Personally', 'found', 'giant', 'pig', 'thing', 'written', 'version', 'creepy', 'hell', 'sadly', 'movie', 'left', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'well-done', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'irks', 'more', 'people', 'basing', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'came', 'books', 'either', 'loved', 'loathed.The', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'semi-large', 'family', 'Wife', 'hubby', 'three', 'kids', 'moving', 'house', 'where', 'previous', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'Defeo', 'son', 'had', 'murdered', 'folks', 'siblings', 'now', 'house', 'up', 'sale', 'cheap', 'folks', 'market', 'soon', 'moving', ""'dream"", 'come', 'true', 'out', 'be', 'nightmare', '28', 'days', 'first', 'setting', 'up', 'play', 'house', 'practically', 'break', 'necks', 'trying', 'get', 'acting', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'excellent', 'job', 'Much', 'better', 'superman', 'movie', 'convincingly', 'paranoid', 'stressed', 'out', 'full', 'rage', 'when', 'needed', 'terrified', 'husband', 'George', 'job', 'man', 'almost', 'edge', 'think', 'giant', 'size', 'man', 'beard', 'make', 'creepy', 'enough', 'paranormal', 'jeebie', 'creepies', 'children', 'are', 'annoying', 'are', 'creepy', 'own', 'way', 'Even', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'house', 'windows', 'everything', 'perfect', 'music', 'score', 'film', 'Lalo', 'Schifrin', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'award', 'so', 'obviously', 'high', 'brownie', 'points', 'me.Other', 'quick', 'flashes', 'beginning', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'violence', 'excellent', 'buildup', 'tension', 'suspense', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'where', 'Kathy', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'actually', 'feel', 'unease', 'lack', 'blood', 'killings', 'should', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'however', 'quiet', 'chilling', 'tale', 'where', 'grow', 'care', 'couple', 'children.Some', 'scenes', 'priest', 'were', 'almost', 'silly', 'did', 'like', 'few', 'things', 'one', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'religious', 'based', 'movies', 'where', 'person', 'just', 'walks', 'cross', 'priest', 'quoting', 'bible', 'ending', 'wraps', 'up', 'well', 'evil', 'too', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'just', 'leave', 'good', 'conquers', 'evil', 'here', 'folks.Where', 'statue', 'almost', 'moves', 'lion', 'thing', 'was', 'creepy', 'enough', 'already', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'actually', 'put', 'evil', 'looking', 'statues', 'house', 'almost', 'asking', 'trouble', 'also', 'blood', 'pressure', 'notch', 'rooms', 'scenery/set', 'house', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'enhancing', 'fear', 'could', 'expect', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'so', 'well', 'could', 'place', 'shoes', 'quite', 'easily', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'film', 'show', 'age', 'especially', 'ending', 'had', 'gone', 'resort', 'blood', 'oozing', 'down', 'walls', 'Then', 'again', 'perhaps', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'looked', 'so', 'cheesy', 'offbeat', 'back', 'then.Some', 'people', 'have', 'expressed', 'dismay', 'going', 'back', 'dog', 'Harry', 'finding', 'unrealistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'enough', 'animals', 'George', 'one', 'take-charge', 'dominant', 'guys', 'who', 'may', 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'biggest', 'animal', 'lover', 'guess', 'one', 'plot', 'tidbits', 'everyone', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'about.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'was', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'true', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'prefer', 'more', 'high-paced', 'violent/gory', 'flicks', 'may', 'think', 'so', 'Overall', 'find', 'classic', 'haunting', 'movie', 'true', 'sense', 'think', 'horror', 'fan', 'least', 'give', 'try']",N/A

Johnson,"[0, 1]","Based on the controversial real-life claims of the Lutz family in the 1970s (in the book of the same name), The Amityville Horror soon gives up any horror &quot;faction&quot; pretentions (that so strongly benefited superior stablemates like The Haunting) in favour of visceral, post-Exorcist sensationalism. The result has predictably polarised horror fans, with some viewing it as unnecessarily schlocky and exploitative (coming from Samuel Z. Arkoff's AIP stable pretty much nails this down from the outset!) and others as a neglected frightfest that suffered too harshly at the hands of mainstream critics hostile to the genre anyway. The truth is probably somewhere in-between. The Amityville Horror is neither a horror masterpiece or entirely as rotten as you may have heard. Certainly, retro-comparison with Tobe Hooper's mainstream-pleasing, Spielbergian, pyrotech-heavy Poltergeist only renders Amityville's unashamed lack of pretention somewhat refreshing.

Now that the new version is releasing in April, I thought `sure why not?' and decided to rent this movie.The story is about the Lutz family, consisting of George (the dad, played by James Brolin), Kathy (the wife, played by Margot Kidder), and their kids, Amy, Greg and Matt. They move into a new house on Amityville, Long Island, which is huge, for a really cheap price, because of the history of the house. Before they moved in, a man who lived there shot he wife and four kids in the house while they were sleeping and then shot himself; the reason unknown. Once the Lutz family moves in, each of them start experiencing strange things. The priest who comes in the house sees flies and becomes ill. George starts acting different and begins to feel cold all the time. Amy makes friends with `Jody', a person nobody else can see. A windowsill pushes down on Greg's hand and gets stuck there, making him bleed. Kathy starts suspecting that there is something really wrong with the house. Her Aunt, a nun, too falls ill upon entering the house. Kathy's brother finds his money disappeared before the wedding. Can Kathy prevent the house from taking over her family before it's too late?I wouldn't call this movie really scary. There were some really eerie moments like the flies, and the rocking chair in Amy's room, but apart from that, it very pretty much bland. While the background music really gives a creepy feeling during the scenes, the special effects just ruin it. I know this movie was taken in 1979, but so were the Star Trek series and I felt that they could have made the ghost look more horrifying. The actors, however, did a wonderful job in the movie. James Brolin and Margot Kidder acted splendidly as did Rod Steiger as Father Delaney. Stuart Rosenberg, did a good job with the direction.I wouldn't really call it spooky, since I felt that the `Poltergeist' was made much better than this, since it's in the same genre. I can understand why it would have been famous in the 70s but when you watch it now, it just doesn't hold that effect on you.

Apparently, on November 13, 1974, a friend of Ronald DeFeo Jr. called the police, reporting that everyone in the DeFeo house had been shot and murdered.However, after a brief investigation the police found that Ronald DeFeo Jr. was the one who'd in fact murdered his parents, along with his four younger siblings with a .35-caliber Marlin rifle. To this day, Ronald, AKA ""Butch"" DeFeo's true motive for killing his entire family has never been established. Yet the strangest, as well as the creepiest thing about the murders was, none of the family members heard the gunfire in each of their subsequent bedrooms- -which several speculators attribute to the fact that Ronald DeFeo Jr. probably had one or more accomplices. Not only that, but it is alleged that each family member was found in exactly the same position- -lying face down with gunshot wounds to the back and/or head.About a year after the DeFeo murders, George and Cathy Lutz moved into the Amityville house. Shortly after moving in, the Lutzes asserted that several frightening, supernatural occurrences took place. Among the strange happenings includes a demonic, unseen voice telling the Lutz's local priest to, ""get out,"" when he came over to bless the house, an imaginary being named ""Jodie,"" who only communicated with their daughter, and their 200+ lbs. backdoor being mysteriously pulled off the hinges at night. The Lutzes maintained that the evil spirits that tormented them were also responsible for driving Butch DeFeo to murder.Well this movie, ""The Amityville Horror,"" chronicles the 28 days of terror the Lutz family supposedly endured in their new Long Island home. And while the Lutz's claim that their house was haunted has been labeled by many reliable sources as a mere money-making scheme, the actual DeFeo murders really did take place- -which for me is scary enough.Unsurprisingly, Hollywood has significantly intensified the actual events reported by the Lutz family throughout the film. In other words, many of the events in the movie were never reported, and are put in the film for mere shock value. The movie itself isn't all that spooky, and the whole evil spirits/haunted house routine is trite at best. However, the acting is pretty good, and the movie at least kept my attention from start to finish.As a whole, this film is way better than its 2005 remake. Yet in my opinion, the actual events of the Amityville house are much creepier than ANY of the fictitious Amityville movies- -so I suggest buying the book titled, ""The Amityville Horror Conspiracy,"" or even the novel, ""The Night the DeFeos Died.""

Obviously some better than others, but so many of them necessary in a cheap thrills way. While my favorites include ""The Shining"", ""The Omen"" and ""The Exercist"", there are several others that deserve credit. On that 2nd tier right next to ""The Thing"", ""Halloween"", ""Nightmare On Elm St"" and ""Poltergeist""... I must put ""The Amittyville Horror"" (1979). The acting by James Brolin as new homeowner George Lutz was average and stiff at best. His glazed look, his snappy remarks to the stepkids, and his wild shaggy hair were downright comical at times... not to mention his strutting around in his Fruit-Of-The Looms - didn't need to see that. Margot Kidder (prior to her talking to trees and living on park benches) was also average at best - a ""B"" movie actress if ever there was one (including ""Superman""). Rod Steiger was good but over dramatic as the priest trying to bring some heart and soul into the house. This movie was not bloody in the sense of a ""Friday The 13th"" style of slasher flick. It was packed with style and suspense leading the viewer to believe there really was something hellacious going on in the house. Suspenseful moments include hundreds of flys gathering in one upstairs room; the house itself regurgitating the words ""Get Out""; doors slamming shut by themselves, a brace-faced babysitter being locked in a closet, toilets vomiting black slime, blood dripping from the walls and staircase, loud rings of the phone at quiet inopportune times, and the family dog madly scratching at a cellar wall. ""Amittyville"" was more story than effects... showing the character(s) losing grips with reality by a haunted house. The scenery is typical Long Island (even though the outside town shots were in Toms River, NJ). The ending of the movie you can see again in 1982's ""Poltergeist""... where the family runs out of the demon house yelling and screaming at night in a blinding rain storm never to return again. 7 sequels later it's still considered one of the horror classics. Many say the movie/book was a hoax... but, who is really to say? On a late night with the lights off, this movie serves up a nice clean scare.

Well, it builds the suspense pretty well, starting with a slaughter at the house and a young couple a year or so later buys the place for a song.  And then weird things start to happen.I would have liked more of an explanation of the hauntings at the house.  There were allusions to an Indian burial ground and a place in the basement that was a ""gate to Hell"" but not much to that.  The dog scratching under the wall until he bled was sad, but no closure for me.When George (played in an overdramatic way by James Brolin) would get more and more possessed, you can see the over the top acting that was going on - screaming ""I'm coming apart"" and all that, knocking his wife around and throwing an axe quite deftly.The weird daughter who talked to her friend Jody, who was really a ghostly pig.And the red ooze running down the walls as the family got into a van to drive off when George wanted to get the dog - and you're tense yelling ""No, don't go back!""Margot Kidder was just off her Superman gig at the time and did let out a pretty mean yell and there were some scenes that were meant to be sexy and a little chest action, but that was just for audience interest and didn't move the plot at all. She's a great screamer but that's about it.Rod Steiger as the priest - and I didn't understand how a house could be against priests and Catholicism when it was a pagan burial ground - who yells about how the house is, trying and failing to get cooperation from his parish (what were they supposed to do about it?  See The Exorcist!) and failing, and ending up a blind, catatonic in a park.  Oh well!Features: Outside of some trailers and a radio promotion for the show, I did enjoy the chat with Margot Kidder and James Brolin, both much older, and reminiscing about the film. And one thing they said that really sticks is that ""films are supposed to be fun.""  So Amityville Horror is not a serious ghost film - just a fun one.  Cool!Bottom Line:  Not all that scary and the lighting, editing and acting make it a fun film actually.  But don't expect Nightmare on Elm Street or Saw.

157398,AZCDCO6KK2T81,079284677X,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[7, 10]","Decent acting, solid special effects, and a fairly intelligent script save this film from being just another haunted house tale.This review contains some minor spoilers after the following brief paragraph:This film follows the supposedly true story of the Lutz family that lived a mere 28 days in a house that is not just haunted, but possessed by both ancient and contemporary evil spirits.  The film is effectively scary and great for a stormy cold night, but you've seen this kind of film before.  I don't consider this a ""classic"" as it added very little to the genre other than some demonic elements not typically found in traditional haunted house tales and it's influence on the film industry was barely a blip on the radar scope; however, it is top-notch entertainment and it has held up well over time.  It greatest value is that you can enjoy this film multiple times.  There are even those out there that consider this film more silly than scary, but find it entertaining regardless.Now the spoilers:There is no way I can believe a single thing in this film as having really happened and everyone, but the Lutz family, connected to the real life events deny their involvement as presented in the film and book.  For example, George Lutz's partner denies ANYTHING ever happened between him and George as depicted in the film.  The local church parish denies that any priest ever went to that house to bless it, let alone go blind later as a result of that visit, and official weather reports clearly indicate that the violent storm noted on their last night in that house never happened.Those are just a few problems with the supposedly ""true"" story.  Other concerns relate to the fact that the Lutz family may have been encouraged to fabricate this story as after buying the house, George's business began to sink and this story may have been a way to save himself financially.  He may have also been encourage by a family friend who claimed to be a ""sensitive"" (AKA Medium) to pursue the history and supernatural possibilities connected to the house.Of course,  the credibility of their story takes another hit when the supposed ""red room"" under the staircase of the house was discovered to NOT EXIST in reality.  The owners after the Lutz family moved out showed the house off to disprove the nonsensical claims by the Lutzes.  In addition, there is one serious question to be ask in that if the house itself was possessed (not just haunted), then why is it not one single owner of that house after the Lutzes had left ever had a single unusual thing happen to them?  Sure sounds like very selective spirits to me --lol.Hey, I can suspend my disbelief as much as anyone to enjoy a good book or film, but don't try and snow job me with claims of ""a true story"" on something that is completely and totally fabricated in order to garner attention and/or make a buck for someone.  I have a large forehead, but ""stupid"" isn't written on it.BTW:  I lived in New York at the time the original murders in that house took place, when the Lutz family lived there, and when the later owners opened the home to disprove the tall tales about the house.  I was actually at that house once, and I never got so much as a goose bump.",4,"A good old-fashioned haunted house tale, but don't believe a word of this ""true"" story.",1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,3229,"['Decent', 'acting', 'solid', 'special', 'effects', 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'script', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'just', 'haunted', 'house', 'tale.This', 'review', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'following', 'brief', 'paragraph', 'film', 'supposedly', 'true', 'story', 'Lutz', 'family', 'lived', 'mere', '28', 'days', 'house', 'not', 'just', 'haunted', 'possessed', 'ancient', 'contemporary', 'evil', 'spirits', 'film', 'effectively', 'scary', 'great', 'stormy', 'cold', 'night', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'classic', 'added', 'very', 'little', 'genre', 'other', 'demonic', 'elements', 'not', 'typically', 'found', 'traditional', 'haunted', 'house', 'tales', 'influence', 'film', 'industry', 'was', 'barely', 'blip', 'radar', 'scope', 'however', 'top-notch', 'entertainment', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'time', 'greatest', 'value', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'multiple', 'times', 'are', 'even', 'there', 'consider', 'film', 'more', 'silly', 'scary', 'find', 'entertaining', 'regardless.Now', 'spoilers', 'way', 'can', 'believe', 'single', 'thing', 'film', 'having', 'really', 'happened', 'everyone', 'Lutz', 'family', 'connected', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'deny', 'involvement', 'presented', 'film', 'book', 'example', 'George', 'Lutz', 'partner', 'ANYTHING', 'ever', 'happened', 'George', 'depicted', 'film', 'local', 'church', 'parish', 'denies', 'priest', 'ever', 'went', 'house', 'bless', 'let', 'alone', 'go', 'blind', 'later', 'result', 'visit', 'official', 'weather', 'reports', 'clearly', 'indicate', 'violent', 'storm', 'noted', 'last', 'night', 'house', 'never', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'problems', 'supposedly', 'true', 'story', 'Other', 'concerns', 'relate', 'fact', 'Lutz', 'family', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'encouraged', 'fabricate', 'story', 'buying', 'house', 'George', 'business', 'began', 'sink', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'save', 'financially', 'may', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'encourage', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'sensitive', 'AKA', 'Medium', 'pursue', 'history', 'supernatural', 'possibilities', 'connected', 'house.Of', 'course', 'credibility', 'story', 'hit', 'when', 'supposed', 'red', 'room', 'staircase', 'house', 'was', 'discovered', 'NOT', 'EXIST', 'reality', 'owners', 'Lutz', 'family', 'moved', 'out', 'showed', 'house', 'disprove', 'nonsensical', 'claims', 'Lutzes', 'addition', 'one', 'serious', 'question', 'be', 'ask', 'house', 'was', 'possessed', 'not', 'just', 'haunted', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'owner', 'house', 'Lutzes', 'had', 'left', 'ever', 'had', 'single', 'unusual', 'thing', 'happen', 'Sure', 'like', 'very', 'selective', 'spirits', 'lol.Hey', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'enjoy', 'good', 'book', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'snow', 'job', 'claims', 'true', 'story', 'something', 'completely', 'totally', 'fabricated', 'order', 'garner', 'attention', 'and/or', 'make', 'buck', 'someone', 'have', 'large', 'forehead', 'stupid', ""n't"", 'written', 'it.BTW', 'lived', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'original', 'murders', 'house', 'took', 'place', 'when', 'Lutz', 'family', 'lived', 'there', 'when', 'later', 'owners', 'opened', 'home', 'disprove', 'tall', 'tales', 'house', 'was', 'actually', 'house', 'once', 'never', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'goose', 'bump']",N/A

157404,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,079284677X,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","I've always been a bit torn on this film.  On one hand, when I read the book when it first came out it was the scariest thing I had ever read.  It may still be the scariest thing I ever read.  Of course, my feeling on that now is somewhat tempered by the revelations that the whole Lutz story may have been a hoax.  FAct or fiction, it was still darn scary.  The movie was widely lampooned then and now but I still think it generates more scares than many films, certainly many low-budget offerings to be sure.The Lutz's and their children move into a beautiful home on Long Island and get it for such a deal.  Well of course we come to find out that the a member of the previous family that lived there had shot and killed a number of his famlily members with a shotgun in a real-life incident.  Things at first are subtle and passed off.  Strange sounds, flies about the windows, missing wallets, etc.  But as director Stuart Rosenberg gradually builds the tension, things get worse.  George Lutz (James Brolin) becomes more distant from his family and acting strange.  He constantly goes out to check the boathouse and is always buidling a raging fire because he is cold.  Is this scary?  Maybe not, but I think it does a nice job of building up the insanity of the character.  Meanwhile daughter Amy is seeing imaginary people who aren't there, culminating in George and Kathy seeing a disembodied pair of red eyes in the sewing room window.Kathy asks her Priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger to bless the house.  He soon becomes violently ill and hears a voice telling him to ""Get Out!""  This all leads to a climax where all hell breaks loose with doors slamming, toilets spewing black ooze and blood dripping from the walls as the Lutz's flee the home, and all their belongings.As a pure haunted house film Amityvilles is fairly effective.  It has some definite chills and builds the tension slowly, maybe too slowly, but surely.  Were talking 1979 so were not going to get much in the way of special effects and it will be interesting to see how the remake handles this.  I hope they don't go overboard with CGI effects.  I guess the weakest part of the movie would be the cast.  Margot Kidder was somewhat of a big name back then thanks to being in Superman but she's just not a very good actress and Brolin is so wooden in his role that he seems positively bored to death.  Only Steiger really shines as Father Delany.Amityville Horror gets a bit of a bad rap in large part due to the fact that the story is now being questioned  as a hoax and the film doesn't hold up well 25 years later, but it's still a moderately effective horror film.",3,LOOKING AT IT WITH NOSTALGIC EYES,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,2647,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'torn', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'was', 'scariest', 'thing', 'had', 'ever', 'read', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'scariest', 'thing', 'ever', 'read', 'course', 'feeling', 'now', 'somewhat', 'tempered', 'revelations', 'whole', 'Lutz', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hoax', 'FAct', 'fiction', 'was', 'still', 'darn', 'scary', 'movie', 'was', 'widely', 'lampooned', 'then', 'now', 'still', 'think', 'more', 'scares', 'many', 'films', 'certainly', 'many', 'low-budget', 'offerings', 'be', 'sure.The', 'Lutz', 'children', 'move', 'beautiful', 'home', 'Long', 'Island', 'get', 'deal', 'Well', 'course', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'member', 'previous', 'family', 'lived', 'had', 'shot', 'killed', 'number', 'famlily', 'members', 'shotgun', 'real-life', 'incident', 'Things', 'first', 'are', 'subtle', 'passed', 'off', 'Strange', 'flies', 'windows', 'missing', 'wallets', 'etc', 'director', 'Stuart', 'Rosenberg', 'gradually', 'tension', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'George', 'Lutz', 'James', 'Brolin', 'more', 'distant', 'family', 'acting', 'strange', 'constantly', 'out', 'check', 'boathouse', 'always', 'buidling', 'raging', 'fire', 'cold', 'scary', 'Maybe', 'not', 'think', 'nice', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'insanity', 'character', 'Meanwhile', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'seeing', 'imaginary', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'culminating', 'George', 'Kathy', 'seeing', 'disembodied', 'pair', 'red', 'eyes', 'sewing', 'room', 'window.Kathy', 'Priest', 'Father', 'Delaney', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'bless', 'house', 'soon', 'violently', 'ill', 'voice', 'telling', 'Get', 'Out', 'climax', 'where', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'doors', 'slamming', 'toilets', 'spewing', 'black', 'ooze', 'blood', 'dripping', 'walls', 'Lutz', 'flee', 'home', 'belongings.As', 'pure', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'Amityvilles', 'fairly', 'effective', 'definite', 'chills', 'tension', 'slowly', 'maybe', 'too', 'slowly', 'surely', 'Were', 'talking', '1979', 'so', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'much', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'remake', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'CGI', 'effects', 'guess', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'was', 'somewhat', 'big', 'name', 'back', 'then', 'thanks', 'being', 'Superman', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'Brolin', 'so', 'wooden', 'role', 'positively', 'bored', 'death', 'Only', 'Steiger', 'really', 'Father', 'Delany.Amityville', 'Horror', 'bit', 'bad', 'rap', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'fact', 'story', 'now', 'being', 'questioned', 'hoax', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', '25', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'moderately', 'effective', 'horror', 'film']",N/A

Tippin,"[6, 6]","The first time I saw this movie, 'after reading the book, and under the impression it was based on a true story,' it scared the heck out of me. Not quite as scary as The Exorcist, but just the thought of going through what the Lutz's did, was enough to give me nightmares.Being raised by a very superstitious family, growing up with ghost and demon tales, made it all the more scarier.After reading feedback, especially the 1 & 2 stars, many people were put off by Amity's sound effects. IMO, the sound effects weren't over-done, nor placed in every scene like some claimed. Besides, what's spookier than sleeping in a big, old house, not long after murders were committed, on a dark, windy night, with roaring thunder and striking lightning?Considering the year Amityville Horror was released, I think it was well-done. Not my favorite, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars, but definately one of the top 20. It's much better than the remake, which I didn't like. In fact, we watched the remake on DVD, as soon as it hit the video stores, and I can't remember one part..Reason: One word.. BORING.Whether or not AH is deemed a classic makes no difference. It's a very good, scary movie, and anyone who enjoys horror should buy the DVD.

Even though his performance is good, but it was Margot Kidder(Kathy) who was more striking with a performance that was filled with emotion and fear. Rod Steiger is very convincing as the priest with best intension to save the Lutz family from the evil force that lived in the old colonial house, but he gets defeated by the powerful demonic force.The story is very detailed and slow-paced compared to the remake. It excels in providing a very gripping atmosphere to this movie while it had neglected to be visually stimulating like the remake. The sound effect and music are kind of cheessy when it always tried to accompanied the reactions of the characters. Theire are more characters in this film, even Helen Shaver had a bit part here.There really is not enough scary moments in this film compared to the remake.
