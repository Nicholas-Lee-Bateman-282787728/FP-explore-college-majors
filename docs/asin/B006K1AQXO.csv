1516835,A30I9X1I32YE5H,B006K1AQXO,"George B. Vieto ""Dee pizza guy""","[2, 2]",The movie was better than I thought it would be. The message is being a bully when fighting crime is not very good. Word Girl hurt the villains as well as people she loved like her partner and her parents. Word Girl learned how to defeat Miss Power by using words that were the opposite of what Miss Power said and not be bullied by her harsh comments and Miss Power then fled the Earth and Word Girl gained the love of the villains who loved Word Girl because she does not make hurtful comments at them.,5,Word Girl The Rise of Miss Power,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,504,"['movie', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'message', 'being', 'bully', 'when', 'fighting', 'crime', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Word', 'Girl', 'hurt', 'villains', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'loved', 'partner', 'parents', 'Word', 'Girl', 'learned', 'how', 'defeat', 'Miss', 'Power', 'using', 'words', 'were', 'opposite', 'what', 'Miss', 'Power', 'said', 'not', 'be', 'bullied', 'harsh', 'comments', 'Miss', 'Power', 'then', 'fled', 'Earth', 'Word', 'Girl', 'gained', 'love', 'villains', 'who', 'loved', 'Word', 'Girl', 'not', 'make', 'hurtful', 'comments']",WordGirl: The Rise of Miss Power

That is now Miss Power gets her power, and as much as I tell my 4 and 5 year old boys that it doesn't work for her (Word Girl does, of course, defeat her), they run around the house saying I'm Miss Power and have gotten into saying things like &#34;You're stupid&#34; and &#34;Your smell&#34; then laughing...thinking it is funny and gives them power.

Peck,"[2, 2]","When I originally set this up to record I thought it was a 1/2 hour episode when in fact it was an hour long special, so I missed the last half.  I eventually saw the rest of The Rise of Miss Power on the PBS Kids site but this episode was so good that I wanted a recording to watch whenever I wanted.  I figure that PBS isn't going to have another 1 hour time slot for WordGirl anytime soon, so the chances that Rise of Miss Power will be rerun seem slim.  So I ordered the DVD.  I watch WordGirl for the witty banter and gags more than anything.  The superhero action is fun but not remarkable (what do you expect from PBS?) and I already know the definitions of practically all the words they present in the series.  A departure from the normal episodes are intervening segments featuring the Pretty Princess character instead of May I Have a Word.  Pretty Princess, of course, is super cheesy but the writers are fully aware of this and the result is delightfully ironic humor like that of Mystery Science Theater 3000.",4,"They probably won't rerun this, so...",1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1023,"['When', 'originally', 'set', 'up', 'record', 'thought', 'was', '1/2', 'hour', 'episode', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'hour', 'long', 'special', 'missed', 'last', 'half', 'eventually', 'saw', 'rest', 'Rise', 'Miss', 'Power', 'PBS', 'Kids', 'site', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'wanted', 'recording', 'watch', 'whenever', 'wanted', 'figure', 'PBS', ""n't"", 'going', 'have', '1', 'hour', 'time', 'slot', 'WordGirl', 'anytime', 'soon', 'chances', 'Rise', 'Miss', 'Power', 'will', 'be', 'rerun', 'seem', 'slim', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'watch', 'WordGirl', 'witty', 'banter', 'more', 'anything', 'superhero', 'action', 'fun', 'not', 'remarkable', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'PBS', 'already', 'know', 'definitions', 'practically', 'words', 'present', 'series', 'departure', 'normal', 'episodes', 'are', 'intervening', 'segments', 'featuring', 'Pretty', 'Princess', 'character', 'instead', 'May', 'Have', 'Word', 'Pretty', 'Princess', 'course', 'super', 'cheesy', 'writers', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'result', 'delightfully', 'ironic', 'humor', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000']",WordGirl: The Rise of Miss Power
1516838,A1DBNHVO2HI81O,B006K1AQXO,Zomus Prime,"[0, 0]","After recently rediscovering this show, I was reminded of its simple charm and clever humor, and how it has fun with the superhero genre and hero/villain dynamics.  This DVD has a great bit of content, including a two-parter &#34;A World Without Wordgirl&#34; and a silly but fun spin-off based on an in-universe show called Pretty Princess and Magical Pony Power Hour (which is both silly and doesn't take itself seriously, but also has an innocent charm).  The main event, &#34;The Rise of Miss Power&#34;, is a great mini-movie.  Many of the stories main villains show up, along with cameos for almost every less common villain (Yay Learnerer!).  The story isn't ground-breaking, but it has great heart and there were a few gem moments.  Whether trying to teach some new words and morals to your kids, or looking for a fun and innocent cartoon, I would recommend this!",4,May I Have a Word(girl)!,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,871,"['recently', 'rediscovering', 'show', 'was', 'reminded', 'simple', 'charm', 'clever', 'humor', 'how', 'fun', 'superhero', 'genre', 'hero/villain', 'dynamics', 'DVD', 'great', 'bit', 'content', 'including', 'two-parter', '34', 'A', 'World', 'Without', 'Wordgirl', '34', 'silly', 'spin-off', 'based', 'in-universe', 'show', 'called', 'Pretty', 'Princess', 'Magical', 'Pony', 'Power', 'Hour', 'silly', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'also', 'innocent', 'charm', 'main', 'event', '34', 'Rise', 'Miss', 'Power', '34', 'great', 'mini-movie', 'Many', 'stories', 'main', 'villains', 'show', 'up', 'cameos', 'almost', 'less', 'common', 'villain', 'Yay', 'Learnerer', 'story', ""n't"", 'ground-breaking', 'great', 'heart', 'were', 'few', 'gem', 'moments', 'Whether', 'trying', 'teach', 'new', 'words', 'morals', 'kids', 'looking', 'fun', 'innocent', 'cartoon', 'would', 'recommend']",WordGirl: The Rise of Miss Power
