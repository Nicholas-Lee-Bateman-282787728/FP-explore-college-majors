Garak has rejoined his old boss (Enabran Tain) in the Cardassian Obsidian Order and renegade factions of the Cardassian and Romulan military have joined forces to launch an attack on the home planet of the Founders of the Dominion. Odo has been imprisoned with a device that prevents him from regenerating and Garak is interrogating him.As Odo slowly deteriorates, Garak begins to lose his ruthless interrogatory manner and starts to sympathize with Odo. The combined Cardassian/Romulan fleet passes through the wormhole and arrives to attack the Founder home world. However it is a trap that has been cleverly laid by the Founders, the combined fleet is attacked by the forces of the Founders and destroyed. Fortunately, Odo and Garak manage to escape with the help of a Founder spy and they return to their lives on Deep Space Nine.The depth of deception and double-dealing carried out by Enabran Tain is worthy of inclusion in any spy thriller; the strength of the attraction of the intelligence operative lifestyle to Garak is palpable and believable. Once again, the Founders prove to be masterful at deceptions of their own, clearly superior to the combined efforts of the Romulans and Cardassians. Garak also proves that his time on DS9 has altered his views of things as he develops sympathy for Odo and ultimately saves his life. This is a very entertaining episode; the combination of ""Improbable Cause"" and this episode is one of the better moments in the series.",5,"The best laid plans of mice, men, Romulans and Cardassians",1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1544,"['episode', 'conclusion', 'cliffhanger', 'Improbable', 'Cause', 'Garak', 'rejoined', 'old', 'boss', 'Enabran', 'Tain', 'Cardassian', 'Obsidian', 'Order', 'renegade', 'factions', 'Cardassian', 'Romulan', 'military', 'have', 'joined', 'forces', 'launch', 'attack', 'home', 'planet', 'Founders', 'Dominion', 'Odo', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'device', 'regenerating', 'Garak', 'interrogating', 'him.As', 'Odo', 'slowly', 'Garak', 'lose', 'ruthless', 'interrogatory', 'manner', 'sympathize', 'Odo', 'combined', 'Cardassian/Romulan', 'fleet', 'passes', 'wormhole', 'attack', 'Founder', 'home', 'world', 'However', 'trap', 'been', 'cleverly', 'laid', 'Founders', 'combined', 'fleet', 'attacked', 'forces', 'Founders', 'destroyed', 'Fortunately', 'Odo', 'Garak', 'manage', 'escape', 'help', 'Founder', 'spy', 'return', 'lives', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine.The', 'depth', 'deception', 'double-dealing', 'carried', 'out', 'Enabran', 'Tain', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'spy', 'thriller', 'strength', 'attraction', 'intelligence', 'operative', 'lifestyle', 'Garak', 'palpable', 'believable', 'Once', 'again', 'Founders', 'prove', 'be', 'masterful', 'deceptions', 'own', 'clearly', 'superior', 'combined', 'efforts', 'Romulans', 'Cardassians', 'Garak', 'also', 'time', 'DS9', 'altered', 'views', 'things', 'sympathy', 'Odo', 'ultimately', 'life', 'very', 'entertaining', 'episode', 'combination', 'Improbable', 'Cause', 'episode', 'one', 'better', 'moments', 'series']","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 67: The Die Is Cast VHS"

MooreDirected by: David Livingston""The Die Is Cast"" is a direct sequel to the outstanding ""Improbable Cause"" and to all surprise, it manages to live up to it's prequel's standards, even if they diverse tremendously.After the subtle and dramatic ""Improbable Cause"", ""The Die Is Cast"" offers direct escalation and powerfully and rapidly paced storstructure.It is, in a way, as dark as it's prequel, but not at all in the way you'd expect. As ""Improbable Cause"" was dark in an anxiously repressed way, ""The Die Is Cast"" throws the pain directly onto the viewer's face.It's also as slow to open up to the viewer as yo might expect from the earlier episode, but not because it's so subtle, but because it's so out in the open. At first it seems only to be a political action-adventure, but as you watch it more, from analytical perspective, it's one of the most thought-provoking and profound star trek episodes.So, in the end, it was probably a good thing this two episode long story was divided into two different parts, with two very different writers, and two very different directors.I never would have thought the infamous third season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine could produce such a masterpiece of drama and talent.",5,Intence darkness and drama,1013731200,"02 15, 2002",2002,1272,"['Episode', 'title', 'Die', 'Is', 'CastWritten', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'MooreDirected', 'David', 'Livingston', 'Die', 'Is', 'Cast', 'direct', 'sequel', 'outstanding', 'Improbable', 'Cause', 'surprise', 'live', 'up', 'prequel', 'standards', 'even', 'diverse', 'tremendously.After', 'subtle', 'dramatic', 'Improbable', 'Cause', 'Die', 'Is', 'Cast', 'direct', 'escalation', 'powerfully', 'rapidly', 'paced', 'storstructure.It', 'way', 'as', 'dark', 'prequel', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Improbable', 'Cause', 'was', 'dark', 'anxiously', 'repressed', 'way', 'Die', 'Is', 'Cast', 'pain', 'directly', 'viewer', 'face.It', 'also', 'as', 'slow', 'open', 'up', 'viewer', 'yo', 'might', 'expect', 'earlier', 'episode', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'so', 'out', 'open', 'first', 'only', 'be', 'political', 'action-adventure', 'watch', 'more', 'analytical', 'perspective', 'one', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'profound', 'star', 'trek', 'episodes.So', 'end', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'two', 'episode', 'long', 'story', 'was', 'divided', 'two', 'different', 'parts', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'writers', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'directors.I', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'infamous', 'third', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'could', 'produce', 'masterpiece', 'drama', 'talent']","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 67: The Die Is Cast VHS"
