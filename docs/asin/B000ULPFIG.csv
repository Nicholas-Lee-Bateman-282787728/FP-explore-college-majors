1095333,A36C6WVZKSG4XB,B000ULPFIG,merm,"[0, 1]","""A Family Holiday"" is a fun movie with all sorts of things happening in the beginning.  The main actor, Dave Coulier handles many situations and I guess we could call him a ""total multi-tasker"".  He is going to inherit a bunch of money but in order to get this money he must have a family.That was a bit difficult since he had no children or wife.  The Christmas movie makes one smile and even laugh out loud when it comes to making a ""real family"" from two children who had no home and no parents.  They are basically living off the streets.  So...two children have appeared for the family he needs to get all the money.  Money does make people try harder but my goodness he got it all together!Just as the children were found somehow the wife is found as well.  If you want to watch a Christmas movie which is sometimes very funny and at times just funny but then it becomes full of love and ""you can feel the need"" to be together then this is a movie you would totally enjoy.  The money becomes less and less important.I do love the part where Dave Coulier,  the pretend kids, the pretend mom go and the case worker all go to cut a Christmas Tree for their house in the woods.  All I can say is it did not turn out quite like they had hoped!  It's funny.If you get the chance to watch this movie then go for it.  You and your family will enjoy it for sure!  I own it so many Christmas Movies...more than other movies.  I find super deals on Amazon and I find movies I cannot find in stores.",5,A Family Holiday,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1493,"['Family', 'Holiday', 'fun', 'movie', 'sorts', 'things', 'happening', 'beginning', 'main', 'actor', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'many', 'situations', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'total', 'multi-tasker', 'going', 'inherit', 'bunch', 'money', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'must', 'have', 'family.That', 'was', 'bit', 'difficult', 'had', 'children', 'wife', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'one', 'smile', 'even', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'making', 'real', 'family', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'home', 'parents', 'are', 'basically', 'living', 'off', 'streets', 'So', 'two', 'children', 'have', 'appeared', 'family', 'get', 'money', 'Money', 'make', 'people', 'try', 'harder', 'goodness', 'got', 'together', 'Just', 'children', 'were', 'found', 'somehow', 'wife', 'found', 'as', 'well', 'want', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'just', 'funny', 'then', 'full', 'love', 'can', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'together', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'totally', 'enjoy', 'money', 'less', 'less', 'important.I', 'do', 'love', 'part', 'where', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'pretend', 'kids', 'pretend', 'mom', 'go', 'case', 'worker', 'go', 'cut', 'Christmas', 'Tree', 'house', 'woods', 'can', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'quite', 'had', 'hoped', 'funny.If', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'go', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'sure', 'own', 'so', 'many', 'Christmas', 'Movies', 'more', 'other', 'movies', 'find', 'super', 'deals', 'Amazon', 'find', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'stores']",The Family Holiday

Even if it isn't their type of story, I can't understand why they thought it was terrible.  In my opinion, this movie was a delight to watch.  Dave Coulier (Joey from Full House) is so loveable in his role as con man Donald ""Doc"" Holiday.  His comic timing is still spot on.  Who didn't laugh during the scene where Doc was showing the new nanny to her room in a house he had never lived in before?  And how adorable were those children.  I had tears in my eyes every time the brother protected his twin sister, and the little girl's innocence and hope was so gorgeous.This was definitely my type of Christmas movie.  It was clean, funny and had that wonderful feel-good ending which I love.

This was a surprisingly funny movie with no bad language or inappropriate material.  Dave Coulier does a great job as the lead actor and the supporting cast is very good as well.  The plot is a bit contrived at points, but still quite enjoyable.  There is a touch of spirituality but it is not an overtly Christian message, and in fact has a line that most Christians would reject (suggesting that good deeds can help one get into heaven, which is not the message of biblical religion).  All in all, a highly recommended, enjoyable film that left my family feeling happy at the end..",4,Clean Christmas Fun,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,712,"['are', 'lot', 'Christmas-themed', 'movies', 'there', 'finding', 'one', 'suitable', 'ages', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'task', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'movie', 'bad', 'language', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'actor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'plot', 'bit', 'contrived', 'points', 'still', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'touch', 'spirituality', 'not', 'overtly', 'Christian', 'message', 'fact', 'line', 'most', 'Christians', 'would', 'reject', 'suggesting', 'good', 'deeds', 'can', 'help', 'one', 'get', 'heaven', 'not', 'message', 'biblical', 'religion', 'highly', 'recommended', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'left', 'family', 'feeling', 'happy', 'end..']",The Family Holiday
