The instruction is clear and concise. It provides a strong grounding in the basics that is needed to progress to other tapes that are suppose to be for &quot;beginners&quot; but dont seem to be to a beginner like me. I think you'll find yourself quickly growing out of this tape but good basics building blocks are indispensable.,5,excellent for newcomers,995760000,"07 22, 2001",2001,431,"['just', 'started', 'looking', 'yoga', 'expand', 'fitness', 'program', 'found', 'tape', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'instruction', 'clear', 'concise', 'strong', 'grounding', 'basics', 'needed', 'progress', 'other', 'tapes', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'quot', 'beginners', 'quot', 'seem', 'be', 'beginner', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'quickly', 'growing', 'tape', 'good', 'basics', 'building', 'blocks', 'are', 'indispensable']",Kathy Smith - New Yoga Basics for Beginners VHS

I still use it, although I now use, among others, her New Yoga and New Yoga Challenge - along with Baron Baptiste's Soul of Strength, Kripalu Dynamic  and so on - but now I use it either on days when I am tired and have the energy to do more than a half hour Kripalu Gentle.I had gotten Patrical Walden's Beginner tape - yoga journal's yoga practice introduction - but it turned me off rather than on - made everything seem too difficult.  Whereas Kathy makes it seem doable.I also like it because it is a kind of review of my technique.  It is incredibly relaxing, gives great stretch and tone as well, and the relaxation at the end is fabulous.  She is so mellow here - totally different from the slightly OTT whooper of Latin Rhythms and Timesaver Weights.

Even though I have been doing Yoga for a relatively long time I still enjoy working with ""beginners"" programs on days when I don't want to push really hard but still want a well rounded practice.I found this program to be a real joy to practice with and have been pleasently surprised by the two Yoga Programs of Kathy Smith's that I've gotten to practice with so far. In fact I'll be trying out her intermediate DVD tomorrow and from what I've seen so far I have great expectations. In fact I plan on ordering the 3 DVD set.I think it's admirable that while Kathy Smith is the featured teacher in this program, she was wise enough to have collaborated  with Rod Stryker (who not only developed the routine but also was a co-producer on the video if I'm not mistaken). Rod is the real deal, he's as reputable a teacher of yoga as one might find anywhere so this program is extremely sound and well structured.I feel that Kathy does a great job of leading you through the program, she paces the program well, has clear and concise instruction and is an inspiring model.I can see how some might feel there are some poses (particularly those in lunge positions as well as Downward facing dog) that might be a bit too much for a brand new beginner, but if these weren't included the tape would become pretty useless very quickly. The key is just to do what you can and rest when you need to, you will eventually build up strength incrementally.Another positive thing about this program is that it is not filled with ""too much"" verbal instruction and therefore maintains a flow which makes it very ""practice friendly"". There are other very good introductory programs out there but often those become hard to practice with because they can get too bogged down with details and therefore are cumbersome to practice with.Anyway, I highly recommend this program for beginners or even those more advanced who (like me on this particular morning) want to have a gentle yoga program to practice with to alternate with more intense programs.Namaste",5,Gentle Yoga Practice and Great Place to Start,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,2545,"['took', 'DVD', 'Library', 'curiousity', 'two', 'Kathy', 'Smiths', 'other', 'Yoga', 'videos.While', ""'ve"", 'been', 'practicing', 'daily', '7', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'be', 'blessed', 'wonderful', 'gifted', 'teacher', 'classes', 'wish', 'could', 'attend', 'daily', 'rely', 'heavily', 'home', 'practice', 'due', 'schedule.I', 'find', 'VHS/DVD', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'way', 'keep', 'home', 'practice', 'getting', 'stale', 'like', 'alternate', 'lots', 'programs', 'variety', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'levels', 'intensity', 'Even', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'relatively', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'enjoy', 'working', 'beginners', 'programs', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'push', 'really', 'hard', 'still', 'want', 'well', 'rounded', 'practice.I', 'found', 'program', 'be', 'real', 'joy', 'practice', 'have', 'been', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'two', 'Yoga', 'Programs', 'Kathy', 'Smith', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'practice', 'so', 'far', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'be', 'trying', 'out', 'intermediate', 'DVD', 'tomorrow', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'great', 'expectations', 'fact', 'plan', 'ordering', '3', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'think', 'admirable', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'featured', 'teacher', 'program', 'was', 'wise', 'enough', 'have', 'collaborated', 'Rod', 'Stryker', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'developed', 'routine', 'also', 'was', 'co-producer', 'video', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'Rod', 'real', 'deal', 'reputable', 'teacher', 'yoga', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'anywhere', 'so', 'program', 'extremely', 'sound', 'well', 'structured.I', 'feel', 'Kathy', 'great', 'job', 'leading', 'program', 'program', 'well', 'clear', 'concise', 'instruction', 'inspiring', 'model.I', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'feel', 'are', 'poses', 'particularly', 'lunge', 'positions', 'as', 'well', 'Downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'brand', 'new', 'beginner', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'tape', 'would', 'become', 'pretty', 'useless', 'very', 'quickly', 'key', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'rest', 'when', 'need', 'will', 'eventually', 'build', 'up', 'strength', 'incrementally.Another', 'positive', 'thing', 'program', 'not', 'filled', 'too', 'much', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'therefore', 'flow', 'very', 'practice', 'friendly', 'are', 'other', 'very', 'good', 'introductory', 'programs', 'out', 'there', 'often', 'become', 'hard', 'practice', 'can', 'get', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', 'details', 'therefore', 'are', 'cumbersome', 'practice', 'with.Anyway', 'highly', 'recommend', 'program', 'beginners', 'even', 'more', 'advanced', 'who', 'particular', 'morning', 'want', 'have', 'gentle', 'yoga', 'program', 'practice', 'alternate', 'more', 'intense', 'programs.Namaste']",Kathy Smith - New Yoga Basics for Beginners VHS

I felt that she kind of babbled too much and the poses were held for quite a while.  I didn't exactly find it as relaxing as it probably should have been.I have only done the video once. I believe in giving things a second chance so I will do that with this video, but I'm not convinced that my star-rating or feelings will change.",3,It's okay,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,471,"['have', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'wanted', 'try', 'so', 'read', 'reviews', 'particular', 'DVD', 'decided', 'go', 'was', 'okay', 'felt', 'kind', 'babbled', 'too', 'much', 'poses', 'were', 'held', 'quite', 'while', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'find', 'as', 'relaxing', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been.I', 'have', 'only', 'done', 'video', 'once', 'believe', 'giving', 'things', 'second', 'chance', 'will', 'do', 'video', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'star-rating', 'feelings', 'will', 'change']",Kathy Smith - New Yoga Basics for Beginners VHS
451556,A2F7UCDYPS7YBA,6305150109,Michelle Lee,"[10, 11]","I agree with the previous reviewer in that the background music and ambiance of the DVD are good, but that was pretty much the only redeeming quality I found in this yoga DVD.  I find Kathy Smith's &quot;basics&quot; (in general, aerobics and strength training videos included) to be a little too demanding for a beginner.  I think she is too in shape for her own good and can't relate to how hard it is for a real beginner to get started.My mom bought this DVD as an introduction to yoga, and she said it was really hard.  As a somewhat experienced yoga student, I tried it, and I could totally understand her viewpoint.  I myself found it too slow, and I think she could have made better choices in terms of what postures to demonstrate.  The ones she does perform are kind of awkward, especially if your muscles are not extremely warm (a fact she briefly mentions at the beginning of the DVD).It's like Kathy Smith can't decide if she wants this to be for relaxation or for a tough workout, and I think that really weakens the whole experience.  Half the time I wanted to close my eyes so I could just focus on my breathing and posture, but then she'd be jumping into a strenuous posture (like warrior pose) without much warning.If you really want this DVD, I recommend you watch it a few times before you actually do it, and I recommend you turn your air conditioning off before you start.  Otherwise, you will be floundering trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing every second, and your muscles will be too cold to stretch the way she expects you to.",2,Not good for a beginner,1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,1570,"['agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'background', 'music', 'ambiance', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'found', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'find', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'quot', 'basics', 'quot', 'general', 'aerobics', 'strength', 'training', 'videos', 'included', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'demanding', 'beginner', 'think', 'too', 'shape', 'own', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'how', 'hard', 'real', 'beginner', 'get', 'started.My', 'mom', 'bought', 'DVD', 'introduction', 'yoga', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'somewhat', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'student', 'tried', 'could', 'totally', 'understand', 'viewpoint', 'found', 'too', 'slow', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'choices', 'terms', 'what', 'demonstrate', 'ones', 'perform', 'are', 'kind', 'awkward', 'especially', 'muscles', 'are', 'not', 'extremely', 'warm', 'fact', 'briefly', 'mentions', 'beginning', 'DVD', '.It', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'relaxation', 'tough', 'workout', 'think', 'really', 'whole', 'experience', 'time', 'wanted', 'close', 'eyes', 'could', 'just', 'focus', 'breathing', 'posture', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'jumping', 'strenuous', 'posture', 'warrior', 'pose', 'much', 'warning.If', 'really', 'want', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'actually', 'do', 'recommend', 'turn', 'air', 'conditioning', 'off', 'start', 'Otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'floundering', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'second', 'muscles', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'cold', 'stretch', 'way']",Kathy Smith - New Yoga Basics for Beginners VHS

This DVD starts lying on the ground with abdominal breathing exercises and then moves on to stretches (knees to chest etc) and then twist (knees to ground etc.)This is bit different than most yoga DVD's start, but I like the change.  The practice starts out with a more relaxed and calm atmosphere.Then on to hands and knee poses (Cat-Cow, knees to chest) and then standing.  There are only a few standing poses (high lunge, side-angle, forward bend with a chair, etc) but they are held long enough so you can feel the effect of the pose.It ends again on the floor with forward bends and relaxation.  Beginners will learn about posture, foot placement, breath work and alignment.  The total workout is about 1 hour and is well cued, expertly demonstrated and has a person to the right who modifies most moves.  You will need a chair, strap, and or wall available to complete the practice.
