Nothing is as it seems. The story will appear to be heading in a certain direction, only to take a quick,  off-kilter turn. Lydie Denier is the increasingly perplexed Marie. She slowly uncovers the family secrets that will cost her so dearly. Kevin Hicks is Marie's unpredictable fiance&eacute;, Thomas.

817946,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B0001Z4OVU,Grindhouse and Horror,"[1, 2]","This exploitation flick that's about a fight over a rich family's inheritance is a suspenseful and well made horror film that kept me engrossed in its unpredictable and sometimes bizarre story. The setting is an isolated exquisite mansion and the surrounding area; nice scenery and some good atmosphere is present. We've got this greedy couple who arrive at the mansion in the beginning to apparently receive the inheritance from his father, a psychotic brain surgeon, by any means. Some surprises and odd twists then follow in a flick that kept me on edge. There's topless and also full frontal nudity in the flick. Aside from some sex scenes, there's a full frontal nude scene that's thrown in for exploitation. Lydie Denier strips completely nude in this scene for a bedridden old guy who wants her to strip before his death; if you want a full nude scene with a really attractive woman, then you'll like this part. The gore is limited and there isn't anything that I would call extreme, but it does have some decent gore. I thought it was well acted, directed, and I liked the twisted and strange story that contained some surprises. The film is talky in some scenes, it doesn't have a lot of action and is slow in some parts, and the body count is low.This was obviously mastered from a VHS master, but I thought it looked pretty good overall. It's a little dark and some may be disappointed with the quality, but I've seen other films that look a lot worse than this when they were mastered from VHS sources. The color, contrast and sharpness are acceptable.",4,Suspensful and strange,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1564,"['exploitation', 'fight', 'rich', 'family', 'inheritance', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'made', 'horror', 'film', 'kept', 'engrossed', 'unpredictable', 'sometimes', 'bizarre', 'story', 'setting', 'isolated', 'exquisite', 'mansion', 'surrounding', 'area', 'nice', 'scenery', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'present', ""'ve"", 'got', 'greedy', 'couple', 'who', 'arrive', 'mansion', 'beginning', 'apparently', 'receive', 'inheritance', 'father', 'psychotic', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'means', 'surprises', 'odd', 'twists', 'then', 'follow', 'flick', 'kept', 'edge', 'topless', 'also', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'flick', 'Aside', 'sex', 'scenes', 'full', 'frontal', 'nude', 'scene', 'thrown', 'exploitation', 'Lydie', 'Denier', 'completely', 'nude', 'scene', 'bedridden', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'strip', 'death', 'want', 'full', 'nude', 'scene', 'really', 'attractive', 'woman', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'part', 'gore', 'limited', ""n't"", 'anything', 'would', 'call', 'extreme', 'have', 'decent', 'gore', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'liked', 'twisted', 'strange', 'story', 'contained', 'surprises', 'film', 'talky', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'action', 'slow', 'parts', 'body', 'count', 'low.This', 'was', 'obviously', 'mastered', 'VHS', 'master', 'thought', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'little', 'dark', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'look', 'lot', 'worse', 'when', 'were', 'mastered', 'VHS', 'sources', 'color', 'contrast', 'sharpness', 'are', 'acceptable']",Blood Relations

817948,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0001Z4OVU,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","When a young man brings his fiancee home to the family mansion to meet the relatives, sinister happenings start to occur all around.  In a plot that should be too wacky to work but somehow does, it seems everybody has deep secrets and wicked motivations, with the young couple evidently scheming to knock the man's extremely wealthy father off in order to collect a large inheritance; with the father possibly guilty in the 'accidental' death of his own wife a couple of years back and possibly having sinister plans for his son's fiancee; and with the very aged, bed-ridden grandfather seemingly having some skeletons in his closet as well.  Throw into this the family doctor's apparant involvement with at least one nasty plot and his girlfriend's role in all of this, and it's hard to believe this isn't the outline for a farcical comedy.  But it's not, and somehow it manages to pull it off.  There's no question that there's a camp factor in here, but Blood Relations is another reminder that, occasionally, some campiness isn't all that bad.  Although most of the characters are pretty villainous, they're interesting, and there's some doubt as to just how guilty some of the parties really are or how far they plan to take their ideas; nonetheless there are few traditional 'innocents' in here.There are some definate problems with the movie that I'll address quickly; one is the sound job - during the early parts much of the movie is unintentionally hard to hear without having the volume so loud that the rest of the movie is thunderous; thankfully this is limited primarilily to two or three early scenes.  And occasionally the gaps in logic go too far, and require a sizable suspension of disbelief.Beyond those shortcomings, the movie is loaded to the max with classic horror/mystery elements.  With eerie and effective lighting, a great harpsichordish musical score, ominously creaking doors, a mansion in the wilderness, hidden passages and secret corridors, and the mystery of just what unholy frights are hidden away in the basement, not to mention a considerable sexy edge (bolstered by the beautiful and frequently naked Lydie Denier in the lead female role), this is the kind of movie that will make afficionados of this type of horror (like myself) overlook a couple of gaffes.
