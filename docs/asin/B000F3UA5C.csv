981959,A3SW2JDRSMF70Z,B000F3UA5C,,"[5, 5]","I saw this film in the theater (literally going out of town to catch a sneak preview, held up in horrible rush hour traffic, and barely making it there) I was so intrigued by the premise of the movie. I do love romances, whether comedy or drama, but it is so hard to find decent ones lately, it seems. And to find that rarest of plotlines---exploring interracial love in an open-minded, open-hearted way, was just too good to resist.Well, the movie delivered and more.It helps, of course, that the leads are absolutely gorgeous. Would we want to look at average people for a couple of hours? But that aside, the plot is mind expanding, exploring interracial love in an honest way, with a few twists and turns on the usual format. If you want to know more on that, check out some of the other reviews. Or better still, leave some mystery to discover when you actually buy this DVD and watch it.The main theme of the movie is to ""be willing to be open to true love in whatever outer package it comes in, and follow your heart"".We singletons can get so stuck in our perfect ""other"" list, that we may miss the ""perfect one for us"" by eliminating the one who doesn't quite fit.Running concurrently, there is a major theme of discovering who you really are and what you really want in life. Also, being willing to shake up the status quo, and potentially disappoint loved ones to find your own way. As a maverick myself in life, I was routing for the Sanaa character to make the hard choices for her personal growth. Just as the Simon character discovered corporate life wasn't for him, and made the subsequent changes.While Blair Underwood is a hotie, and I would be routing for him normally---not in this movie. It is Simon Baker all the way. He is the best one for Sanaa.You can debate all you want about the ""realities"" of the plotline. But this is a romantic comedy, guys! It isn't meant to be 100% politically and culturally correct! Just call it a slice of life that could actually happen somewhere to two people, who found each other, and fell in love.",4,"Following your heart , and discovering who you really are",1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,2054,"['saw', 'film', 'theater', 'literally', 'going', 'town', 'catch', 'sneak', 'preview', 'held', 'up', 'horrible', 'rush', 'hour', 'traffic', 'barely', 'making', 'was', 'so', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'movie', 'do', 'love', 'romances', 'comedy', 'drama', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'decent', 'ones', 'lately', 'find', 'rarest', 'plotlines', '-exploring', 'interracial', 'love', 'open-minded', 'open-hearted', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'resist.Well', 'movie', 'delivered', 'more.It', 'course', 'leads', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Would', 'want', 'look', 'average', 'people', 'couple', 'hours', 'aside', 'plot', 'mind', 'expanding', 'exploring', 'interracial', 'love', 'honest', 'way', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'usual', 'format', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'reviews', 'better', 'still', 'leave', 'mystery', 'discover', 'when', 'actually', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watch', 'it.The', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'be', 'willing', 'be', 'open', 'true', 'love', 'outer', 'package', 'follow', 'heart', '.We', 'singletons', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'stuck', 'perfect', 'other', 'list', 'may', 'miss', 'perfect', 'one', 'eliminating', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit.Running', 'concurrently', 'major', 'theme', 'discovering', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'life', 'Also', 'being', 'willing', 'shake', 'up', 'status', 'quo', 'potentially', 'disappoint', 'loved', 'ones', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'maverick', 'myself', 'life', 'was', 'routing', 'Sanaa', 'character', 'make', 'hard', 'choices', 'personal', 'growth', 'Just', 'Simon', 'character', 'discovered', 'corporate', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'subsequent', 'changes.While', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'hotie', 'would', 'be', 'routing', 'normally', '-not', 'movie', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'way', 'best', 'one', 'Sanaa.You', 'can', 'debate', 'want', 'realities', 'plotline', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guys', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', '100', '%', 'politically', 'culturally', 'correct', 'Just', 'call', 'slice', 'life', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'somewhere', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'other', 'fell', 'love']",N/A
981960,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B000F3UA5C,,"[5, 5]","Something New starring Sanaa Lathan and the very sexy Simon Baker is a smart and engaging story of a successful African-American woman who falls in love with a white landscaper. Kenya McQueen (Lathan) thinks she has it all, a great job, a brand new home, and level-headed friends, but when one of her co-workers sets her up on a blind date, Kenya refuses to fall for him because he is a different race than her. Nonetheless, Kenya does find him attractive but is she willing to give in to temptation and what will her friends and priviledged family say when they find out she's dating a white man? I highly recommend checking this film out, one of the best and under-rated films of 2006. The film also stars Alfre Woodward and Donald Faison.

The path to true love is fraught with inconvenience and obstacles; at least one would think so when watching Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan).Kenya is on the fast track to making partner - but only at her law firm. Her personal life sucks. Where are all the eligible black men? She and her similarly high-achieving girlfriends chalk up their track record to the miserable statistics on the marriage prospects of professional African-American women. Apparently, only 42.4% of them ever marry.But Kenya's real problem is that she has impossibly high standards, and she has a list of what she does and doesn't do, a mental index of uncomely attributes - bad teeth, poor education, kids, previously married. She seems to be convinced that she has to land an IBM: Ideal Black Man.Kenya is also insufferably uptight, she wears a full work outfit on Saturdays, and complains to her friends about the ""black tax,"" the idea that blacks have to work twice as hard to achieve the same accolades as their white peers. And just like the garden in the back of her newly purchased house, Kenya is just as dry and emotionally barren.The man of her dreams arrives in the form of hunky blond haired and blue eyed Brian (terrific Tasmanian actor Simon Baker). They meet on a blind date, but because Kenya can't think outside the box and would never dream of dating a white guy, she tells him she's not interested. Coincidently, she meets him again and hires him to landscape her garden.The more Brian wrestles manfully with a hoe, biceps bulging, the hotter Kenya gets under her starchy, buttoned-up collar. ""You need me,"" Brian says when he first sees Kenya's pathetic garden, clearly meaning to make this stunning but chilly woman blossom along with the seedlings.Obvious problems arise with the race card - not so much from Kenya's family and friends - but from her own views and insecurities over dating a white guy. Brian sees women as women, and looks beyond the skin colour, he's also remarkably laid back, almost spiritual in his outlook, and he sees Kenya as ""a piece of work,"" she's absolutely gorgeous but seems damaged by her life experiences.The two leads are enormously appealing and have obvious screen chemistry  - Baker - an actor of formidable talents - is suitably earthy and sexy as Brian, whilst Lathan is absolutely gorgeous as Kenya. The film is also smart enough to address the economic gap between the two principals, which is considerable; and there's a class barrier as well as a racial one. And in a kind of reverse racism, Kenya's brother and his friends rib Brian for being white every chance they get.This is a lovely, elegant and beautifully acted movie, the humor coming from the characters themselves as they grapple with their perceived limitations of living in the modern world.  The movie also doesn't shy away from the subtle, everyday racism that has made Kenya so guarded and distrustful in the first place.Yet when all is dead and done, true love conquers all, the colour of one's skin is superfluous, and both Brian and Kenya realize they are meant to be together. Something New is very smart and very entertaining, and if at times it hedges on matters of stereotyping and ethnic tension while focusing on the steamy love affair, then all the better.

I felt that at points, the racial issues were a bit forced and tiresome, but in the end it all sort of works out in a happy way. I wish the Kenya character would have had a bit more obvious attraction than just looks for the Brian character. She never seems to be anything other than a stressed, reclusive hard-charger.

The chemistry between Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker is great.

Granted, the film has a happy ending, but that happy ending comes after a lot of realistic soul searching and painful choices.

981969,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000F3UA5C,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","I just adore Sanaa Lathan.  Maybe that's why I just had to see this movie.  After watching her chew up the screen in `Love and Basketball' I think I'd find any excuse to watch her (I did see `AVP').  Thankfully Lathan is not the only good thing about `Something New'; in fact the entire film was well constructed and it delivers a nice and satisfying slice of entertainment.The film focuses on the very successful Kenya McQueen, a corporate lawyer who has fought her way to the top and just keeps on fighting to get higher.  All that fighting has had an adverse effect on her love life, leaving her single and in need of some male attention.  When a friend and co-worker sets her up on a blind date she ends up getting more than she bargained for in Brian Kelly.  He's good looking, successful and charming; but he's also white, and Kenya doesn't `do' white guys (there's a whole list, trust me).  After rudely turning him away she winds up being reacquainted with him when she inquires about having her backyard landscaped.Guess what Brian does for a living.It's obvious that sparks will fly and that the two of them will start a relationship.  It's also obvious that her family will disapprove (not only is he white but they are wealthy and it's obvious that Kenya's mother puts a lot of value in social standing).  It's predictable that race will become and issue and they will break up and Kenya will pursue the black man only to realize that regardless of skin color she loves Brian and needs to be with him.  All of this is predictable yet what isn't predictable or `obvious' is the fact that we will care so much.  Brian is such a sweet and charming guy, and Kenya is such a confused and sheltered person that we are rooting for them to complete one another.  We are rooting for Kenya to lose Brian so she can appreciate him and visa versa.Sanaa Lathan doesn't disappoint me here.  She plays Kenya with dedication and naturalism (she reminds me so much of my wife here; all those beautiful flaws).  Simon Baker is another standout.  As Brian he really understands his character, but he also understands Kenya.  It's obvious why one would fall for him; he's a complete package.  I thought that Mike Epps turned in a great supporting performance as well.  Donald Faison is non other than Donald Faison (he really only has one shade of character) and Blair Underwood comes off a little creepy to me (that might be because I was rooting for him to fail and for Brian to `get the girl').  Alfre Woodard and Earl Billings do a nice job of representing two different sides of a parent.  As Kenya's mother, Alfre is intrusive and controlling, but as her father, Earl is gentle and understanding.  They compliment each other very well.`Something New' may not be all that `new' but in a few aspects it truly is.  It approaches the race relations issue in a non-biased, realistic and, most importantly, likable way, a way that proves that in the end race doesn't matter; especially in matters of the heart.

Anyone who's seenLove and Basketball (New Line Platinum Series)knows why.  It's also nice to see Simon Baker here as a likable character, since he's best known (well, to me, at least) as being a bit of a cad inThe Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition).  As an aside, I know this film is supposed to be an ""opposites attract"" type of thing, but with Baker the filmmakers have opted for the polar extreme.  He's a gardener here, but you half expect him to ask if anyone has any Grey Poupon.Other enjoyable performances:  Mike Epps, an engaging presence who I really like on-screen; and Taraji P. Henson, who I've described in other reviews as a Force of Nature, especially inTalk to Me (Widescreen Edition)andHustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition).In addition to the movie's romantic theme, Lathan shows her comedic chops.  The funniest scene is when Lathan's character - having just met Baker's character in a blind date set-up at a Magic Johnson/Starbucks JV (excellent touch by director Sanaa Hamri) - tries to assert her street cred on the way to a table by loudly asking questions of the employees like ""How's Magic treating you, brother?"" The stunned recipient of the question - while Baker looks on bemusedly and knowingly - scrunches up his face and says ""I don't know, I've never met the man.""

Their relationship moved slowly and smoothly throughout the film.  For some, interracial relationships can be difficult.  In this day and time, one wouldn't think so, but it can be.This film showed how others can prevent a possibly good relationship between interracial couples, from possibly happening.  Sanaa struggled with this, even to the point of hiding it.  Some have their beliefs about not going out of their own race.  Sanaa had it as well.  When it boils down to it, we are all humans, male and female.  Race shouldn't be an issue, even though it is for some.I think in the end that Sanaa decided to follow her own heart, though almost losing Simon for good.  She had to oversome some of her beliefs toward interracial relationships, and allow her true feelings to conquer her fears.

I saw the previews and went all over town trying to rent it and could not find it, so I bought it.  I was glad I took the risk.  The movie is not for everyone.  It is not action packed or a tear jerker.  It is simply a great story, done with integrity, humor, and intelligence.  It did a superb job of presenting both sides of racism from both a black and a white perspective, in a real yet tactful way.

""Something New"" is one of these rare romantic comedies that finally gets it right!  Most romantic comedies--while a fairly harmless way to spend $10 on a Friday night--rarely make me want to go out and buy the DVD.  On the other hand, I couldn't wait for ""Something New"" to be released on video, and I picked up my copy the first day of its release.""Something New"" gives us a rare glimpse into the actual process of two people falling in love.  Most so-called romances jump straight to the sex, and it's all downhill from there.  It was really gratifying to actually witness Kenya and Brian's feelings and relationship evolve on screen.  The commentary on interracial dating and its complications (even in this modern day and age) was ""just right"": realistic, but subtle.  There was no need to beat the viewer over the head with the race issue, with such stellar actors to convey the message.  As an African-American woman, I enjoyed the fresh perspective on a subject that is too often either delivered in an overly ""preachy"" way, or ignored entirely in film.All-in-all, ""Something New"" is an uplifting movie, with a universal message:  Sometimes a person that looks perfect ""on paper"" is not THE ONE, and love can strike where you least expect it.

981977,A13GEXUA4SJ8J5,B000F3UA5C,Carol Hunt,"[12, 12]","I am not sure that I got the same thing out of the film that everyone else did.  I am mulatto.  So my opinion is the opinion of a mulatto observer.I really liked this film, and I do believe that it is, in some aspects, very realistic.  The thing that I found the most interesting in the film is that it not only depicts racism, but the movie bravely portrays the problems with reverse racism.  The main character in this film is extremely racist (Kenya) and she does not know it.  She treats Brain, her white boyfriend, with contempt in many scenes within the movie.  She is unfair to him and blames him for the bad experiences that she has had with other white people in her life. The development in this movie comes when Kenya comes to terms with her own racism and stops projecting outward the feelings that she has herself. Everyone has to behave the way that they would like people to behave.Brain is an educated man in a lower social class than the girl he is trying to date.  His low status is displayed realistically.  He is treated in an inferior manner because of his job--despite his his good character. He displays the most mature behavior of any character in the movie.  He is completely untouched by racism even though he does not always understand the social implications.  As a character, he is not a saint.  He is ignorant of the damaging experience that black women experience on a daily basis, but he tries to understand. This character is probably the most beautiful that I have ever watched in any film; he tries.  He is also extremely patient in the face of mistreatment, refuses to complain if he thinks it is nonconstructive, and looks constantly for the positive in the situation.  He is an enlightened person and he does not have the status of a professional class job.Kenya is anxious, very serious, and needs help handling stress.  She is very competent and hard working.  This is the first movie that I have ever seen in which the heroine is stressed for legitimate reasons.  She is an over-achiever with an under developed personal life. She lacks interpersonal skills and suffers from unrealistic fears.  She also does not know how to express her feelings so she attempts to hide her emotions behind a facade of social propriety. She appears as a boring person, but is very intriguing underneath the flat way that she projects herself because of her own feelings of inferiority.  She suppresses herself because of the way that her self-esteem has been damaged by her white co-workers and the way that she believes other people perceive her. She does not see the positive in her life because she is over sensitive. This is an extremely realistic portrayal of an intelligent woman that faces adversity; the character displays common errors in thinking. I have also never come across a film in which the female had a serious relationship with her family.  We usually get the orphaned heroine, but in this film all family members are alive and talking.  That is unusual.What I found to be less realistic is the cruel manner in which the blacks in this film treat a white man.  I grew up in an interracial neighborhood.  On the block that I lived most of my life on, four families had marriages that were interracial, and all those families had children.  All their children also grew up to have children with either black or white spouses.  Black people are often racist, but they are not so racist that they will insult a white partner at social events.  That is extremely rude, and the cruel manner that Brain is treated by blacks, in my experience, is not realistic.  It is a little extreme.  I do not think that this detracts greatly from the film because the movie is pointing out a genuine difficulty-- even if it is an over dramatized one.The board has a very interesting discussion on it.  I just wonder if some of this controversy is not generational.  I am a twenty-five year old mulatto female, and I have had problems with racism in relationships before, but the circumstances are different from in this movie (different religions or political beliefs).  I have two kids from white fathers, and I was married to a white man.  Interracial marriages are not that taboo anymore.

Daniels,"[3, 30]","I had been hearing and critiques on ""Something New"" and this is the first movie featuring a Black American Women in a realtionship with a White American Man, I did not see the movie because I personally thought  what about movies like 'Eraserhead' or Rosanne Cash and Stacey Keach  in the 1970's or many british movies on the subject. To me this movie seemed like a 'get back' movie at Black Men who either..1. dating  white women2. on the dl3. are irresponsible4. take black women for granted5. sexist black menAfter people telling me that it's not the case and it's a movie that's not bashing black men but telling black women to seek more options than an ""Ideal Black Man"". I decided to wait until the overhyping of this movie ended by it's female actors, director, and producers and movie critics hailing this movie as a great ' racial breakthrough' (lolol) for Black Women. I have finally seen the movie and my reivew that it's a well acted but predictable romatic drama about the same subject that's starting to plaque black movies in the last 10 years. Black Movies used to feature just ghetto sterotypes are now doing the same thing but it's now the Black Middle or Upper Class who can't find love but usually it's Morris Chestnutt, Taye Diggs, and Jamie Foxx. But unlike those black leading men the 'white knight' is actually white, Simon Barker (land of the dead) is the landscape owner who Sanna Lathan falls for in this predictable romp.As her friends and others encouarge her to pursue this relationship, her IBM show up in the quise of Blair Underwood (in a solid but wooden performance) Kenya (Lathan) reacess her realtionship with Barker after some friction on race (how typical of hollywood) after Underwood is so driven by his job and not Kenya, the talk of tolerance by her pops and the ending at the cotilion with the Lathan running to Barker at the end (doesn't that scence look like Spiderman 2)with Lathan learning that Black Women should expand their options especially for professional black women.I could say this movie is some social breakthrough, but there is nothing in this film that is artisitc, there has has been movies that focus on the subject that are better than ""Something New'. If Black Women want to date IR just do it, but don't con me with a film that is average at best, and don't insult my intelligence. Its a chick flick and for Roger Ebert (who is married to a black woman) to say this movie has social impact is insulting to films that have actually done just that.Something New would be a good T.V. movie of the week on LIFETIME but it's not a major motion picture.P.S. To the Black Women and White Males sending me negative vibes show me a movie about Mixed Realtionships that are better,more realistic than Mississippi Masala than the black female writers and producers 'wet dream' of a movie then I  will believe it. The ending of this movie was unrealistic AT IT'S BEST.In real-life (not kriss turner's fantasy) Black Female/White Male realtionships the couple lives the white male's life and social interests not dancing at predominately black social events Kenya's a black upper class woman in a segregated black elite and would not even consider someone like Brian as part of her social circle or does a 150 years of black elite social conditioning is thrown out the window? Frankly BF/WM are intergrated into mainstream society. Black Women in those relationships are like pro black ballplayers, ""Honoray Whites"" and have all privledges. White Women (or other ethnic groups) who are married to black males are more connected to the Black community than African- American Females married to white males.",2,"2.5 stars an average romantic movie, nothing that has not been seen before",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,3658,"['had', 'been', 'hearing', 'critiques', 'Something', 'New', 'first', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Black', 'American', 'Women', 'realtionship', 'White', 'American', 'Man', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'personally', 'thought', 'what', 'movies', ""'Eraserhead"", 'Rosanne', 'Cash', 'Stacey', 'Keach', '1970', 'many', 'british', 'movies', 'subject', 'movie', 'seemed', ""'get"", 'back', 'movie', 'Black', 'Men', 'who', 'either..1.', 'dating', 'white', 'women2', 'dl3', 'are', 'irresponsible4', 'take', 'black', 'women', 'granted5', 'sexist', 'black', 'menAfter', 'people', 'telling', 'not', 'case', 'movie', 'not', 'bashing', 'black', 'men', 'telling', 'black', 'women', 'seek', 'more', 'options', 'Ideal', 'Black', 'Man', 'decided', 'wait', 'overhyping', 'movie', 'ended', 'female', 'actors', 'director', 'producers', 'movie', 'critics', 'hailing', 'movie', 'great', 'racial', 'breakthrough', 'lolol', 'Black', 'Women', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'movie', 'reivew', 'well', 'acted', 'predictable', 'romatic', 'drama', 'same', 'subject', 'starting', 'plaque', 'black', 'movies', 'last', '10', 'years', 'Black', 'Movies', 'used', 'feature', 'just', 'ghetto', 'sterotypes', 'are', 'now', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'now', 'Black', 'Middle', 'Upper', 'Class', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'love', 'usually', 'Morris', 'Chestnutt', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'black', 'leading', 'men', ""'white"", 'knight', 'actually', 'white', 'Simon', 'Barker', 'land', 'dead', 'landscape', 'owner', 'who', 'Sanna', 'Lathan', 'predictable', 'romp.As', 'friends', 'others', 'encouarge', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'IBM', 'show', 'up', 'quise', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'solid', 'wooden', 'performance', 'Kenya', 'Lathan', 'reacess', 'realtionship', 'Barker', 'friction', 'race', 'how', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'Underwood', 'so', 'driven', 'job', 'not', 'Kenya', 'talk', 'tolerance', 'pops', 'ending', 'cotilion', 'Lathan', 'running', 'Barker', 'end', ""n't"", 'scence', 'look', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Lathan', 'learning', 'Black', 'Women', 'should', 'expand', 'options', 'especially', 'professional', 'black', 'women.I', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'social', 'breakthrough', 'nothing', 'film', 'artisitc', 'been', 'movies', 'focus', 'subject', 'are', 'better', 'Something', 'New', 'Black', 'Women', 'want', 'date', 'IR', 'just', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'con', 'film', 'average', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'chick', 'flick', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'married', 'black', 'woman', 'say', 'movie', 'social', 'impact', 'insulting', 'films', 'have', 'actually', 'done', 'just', 'that.Something', 'New', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'T.V', 'movie', 'week', 'LIFETIME', 'not', 'major', 'motion', 'picture.P.S', 'Black', 'Women', 'White', 'Males', 'sending', 'negative', 'vibes', 'show', 'movie', 'Mixed', 'Realtionships', 'are', 'better', 'more', 'realistic', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', 'black', 'female', 'writers', 'producers', ""'wet"", 'dream', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'believe', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'AT', 'IT', 'BEST.In', 'real-life', 'not', 'kriss', 'turner', 'fantasy', 'Black', 'Female/White', 'Male', 'couple', 'white', 'male', 'life', 'social', 'interests', 'not', 'dancing', 'predominately', 'black', 'social', 'events', 'Kenya', 'black', 'upper', 'class', 'woman', 'segregated', 'black', 'elite', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'consider', 'someone', 'like', 'Brian', 'part', 'social', 'circle', '150', 'years', 'black', 'elite', 'social', 'conditioning', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'Frankly', 'BF/WM', 'are', 'intergrated', 'mainstream', 'society', 'Black', 'Women', 'relationships', 'are', 'pro', 'black', 'ballplayers', 'Honoray', 'Whites', 'have', 'privledges', 'White', 'Women', 'other', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'black', 'males', 'are', 'more', 'connected', 'Black', 'community', 'African-', 'American', 'Females', 'married', 'white', 'males']",N/A
981990,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000F3UA5C,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","I was fully prepared to dislike this 2006 film since on the surface, it seems like yet another variation on the overused rom-com formula of the high-powered woman finding true love against her initial judgment. The fact that it employs the race card had me concerned that another version of last year's soft-centered ""Guess Who"" was in store. However, this type of movie depends so much more on execution than story framework, and director Sanaa Hamri and writer Kriss Turner, both first-timers in feature films, have done a surprisingly effective job in making the premise feel fresh and involving in spite of its predictable elements.The story focuses on Kenya McQueen, a type-A and anal-retentive corporate accountant on the verge of making partner at her firm. Her depressingly beige single life is given a jolt by Brian, a hunky gardener first on a blind date at Starbucks and then as her landscape architect. The fact that she is black and he is white makes her resistant to his romantic impulses until he taps into her soul. Of course, there is passive disapproval all around, but the biggest barrier is how the couple responds to their own inherent racism. This is where the movie exceeds expectations, especially in a bitterly honest conversation at a supermarket, as the tension goes palpably beyond racism into differences in socioeconomic status and life priorities. Enter Mark, the ideal black man, handsome, ambitious and the perfect match for Kenya. If you cannot figure out the rest of the plot, then clearly you do not go to the movies much.So much of the success of the film depends on the right casting of the leads. Luckily, this is not a problem here. Sanaa Lathan does a fine job showing all the emotional contours of Kenya, and with a winking nod to ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"", Simon Baker is appropriately magnetic as Brian. Similar to the role he played as Miranda's failed suitor on ""Sex in the City"", Blair Underwood plays his stock character as Mark with somewhat predictable aplomb. Speaking of which, Kenya is surrounded by a trio of ""Sex""-like girlfriends played with relish by Wendy Raquel Robinson (especially sharp as Cheryl), Golden Brooks and Taraji P Henson (last seen in a 180-degree turn as the cowering pregnant hooker Shug in last year's ""Hustle and Flow""). I just wish there were more scenes with the four of them bantering. The usually wondrous Alfre Woodward is wasted playing Kenya's exclusionary mother, but she does what she can with the stereotypical role, as does Donald Faison from ""Scrubs"" as Kenya's aspiring playboy brother Nelson.It actually helps that Hamri was a music video director before this movie. She provides a nice visual style, in particular, an intriguing use of jump cuts and elliptical edits that make the story move along at a nice clip and feel less predictable than it is. Turner's screenplay is especially observant and trenchant in the small moments at Kenya's workplace and her housewarming party. It's refreshing to see such an unbiased portrayal of upscale black professionals without some heavy social message attached.  The DVD has few extras - no commentary track, a perfunctory ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather silly five minute short, ""Do's and Don't's of Dating"", in which cast members offer their advice.",4,Surprising Sparkle in Opposites-Attract Romantic Comedy,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,3298,"['was', 'fully', 'prepared', 'dislike', '2006', 'film', 'surface', 'yet', 'variation', 'overused', 'rom-com', 'formula', 'high-powered', 'woman', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'initial', 'judgment', 'fact', 'race', 'card', 'had', 'concerned', 'version', 'last', 'year', 'soft-centered', 'Guess', 'Who', 'was', 'store', 'However', 'type', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'execution', 'story', 'framework', 'director', 'Sanaa', 'Hamri', 'writer', 'Kriss', 'Turner', 'first-timers', 'feature', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'job', 'making', 'premise', 'feel', 'fresh', 'involving', 'spite', 'predictable', 'elements.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Kenya', 'McQueen', 'type-A', 'anal-retentive', 'corporate', 'accountant', 'verge', 'making', 'partner', 'firm', 'depressingly', 'beige', 'single', 'life', 'given', 'jolt', 'Brian', 'hunky', 'gardener', 'first', 'blind', 'date', 'Starbucks', 'then', 'landscape', 'architect', 'fact', 'black', 'white', 'resistant', 'romantic', 'impulses', 'soul', 'course', 'passive', 'disapproval', 'biggest', 'barrier', 'how', 'couple', 'own', 'inherent', 'racism', 'where', 'movie', 'expectations', 'especially', 'bitterly', 'honest', 'conversation', 'supermarket', 'tension', 'palpably', 'racism', 'differences', 'socioeconomic', 'status', 'life', 'priorities', 'Enter', 'Mark', 'ideal', 'black', 'man', 'handsome', 'ambitious', 'perfect', 'match', 'Kenya', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'rest', 'plot', 'then', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'movies', 'much.So', 'much', 'success', 'film', 'right', 'casting', 'leads', 'Luckily', 'not', 'problem', 'here', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'emotional', 'contours', 'Kenya', 'winking', 'nod', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'appropriately', 'magnetic', 'Brian', 'Similar', 'role', 'played', 'Miranda', 'failed', 'suitor', 'Sex', 'City', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'stock', 'character', 'Mark', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'aplomb', 'Speaking', 'Kenya', 'surrounded', 'trio', 'Sex', '-like', 'girlfriends', 'played', 'relish', 'Wendy', 'Raquel', 'Robinson', 'especially', 'sharp', 'Cheryl', 'Golden', 'Brooks', 'Taraji', 'P', 'Henson', 'last', 'seen', '180-degree', 'turn', 'cowering', 'pregnant', 'hooker', 'Shug', 'last', 'year', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'four', 'bantering', 'usually', 'wondrous', 'Alfre', 'Woodward', 'wasted', 'playing', 'Kenya', 'exclusionary', 'mother', 'what', 'can', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'Scrubs', 'Kenya', 'aspiring', 'playboy', 'brother', 'Nelson.It', 'actually', 'Hamri', 'was', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'movie', 'nice', 'visual', 'style', 'particular', 'intriguing', 'use', 'jump', 'cuts', 'elliptical', 'edits', 'make', 'story', 'move', 'along', 'nice', 'clip', 'feel', 'less', 'predictable', 'Turner', 'screenplay', 'especially', 'observant', 'trenchant', 'small', 'moments', 'Kenya', 'workplace', 'housewarming', 'party', 'refreshing', 'see', 'such', 'unbiased', 'portrayal', 'upscale', 'black', 'professionals', 'heavy', 'social', 'message', 'attached', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'perfunctory', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'rather', 'silly', 'five', 'minute', 'short', 'Do', 'Do', ""n't"", ""'s"", 'Dating', 'cast', 'members', 'offer', 'advice']",N/A

Well, this little movie may be a romantic comedy but it is well written (Kriss Turner), well directed (Sanaa Hamri), and very well acted and has some down to earth important observations about interpersonal relationships...and, oh yes, it deal with interracial issues, beautifully!Kenya (Sanaa Lathan - Best Man, Blade, The Wood, etc) is a beautiful Type A personality, an overachiever who is up for Partner in her Accounting Firm: she has no time to search for IMB (Important Black Man) as her list of qualifications is far too extensive.  Her fellow professional girlfriends (Wendy Raquel Robinson, Golden Brooks and Taraji P. Henson - all superb!) encourage her to date to 'go with the flow' and a fellow business associate sets her up with a blind date - the very handsome, hunky, landscape architect Brian Kelly (Simon Baker - superb actor from Tasmania, Australia has starred in LA Confidential, Book of Love, The Ring Two, The Affair of the Necklace etc) - and despite the fact that Kenya refuses to consider dating any man who is not black, she does accept Brian's card and in no time hires him to landscape her new home.The usual dating events occur: Simon is an educated, laid-back, tender, thoughtful, adventuresome male who happens to fall in love with the closely guarded Kenya; when introduced at parties Simon falls victim to prejudice form black men AND form Kenya's parents; Kenya gradually succumbs to Brian's charms and despite all misgivings they begin an affair.  But peer pressures, work demands, and Kenya's self doubt jumble matters and she decides she must search for a black man.  One 'just happens' to appear as Mark (Blair Underwood) and for a moment Kenya believes she has found her ideal - until her heart speaks up and she for the first time is honest with her emotions and follows her true heart's desire.The  apparent disparity between Kenya and Brian is handled in a sensitive and realistic way and Lathan and Baker have a sizzling screen chemistry.  The supporting roles are in excellent hands: in addition to those mentioned above there are fine roles by Alfre Woodward, Earl Billings, Donald Faison, Mike Epps etc.  This is a fine little film that approaches the touchy subject of black professional women who are unmarried ('42.4 Percent' was the working title) and for once shows an interracial film that is more a sound love story than a sermon.

The chickflick catagorization seems silly. On the other hand The film certainly probes the vexations that black/white romantic inimacy encounter--as well as the hope that any real intimacy engenders. But it does more. It succeeds in exploring the differences between not only black and white but in exploring the variatons of insight within a group of black people and white people.  For example:  Kenya's girlfriend Cheryl(?) (one problem I  noticed with with my copy was quality of sound)  notices that Kenya has been hiking with Brian and understands that THAT outing is perhaps as important as the night Brian and Kenya subsequently spend together. Kenya's other girlfriends miss that. Small  moment  gracefully done!Similarly I thought that the nuanced way the film points to the humiliation Kenya suffers at the hands of a white client (Jack?)) who is never on the surface even  ""impolite"" was especially well done and the understated nature of  Jack's prejudice made it all the more painful. But the film also shows the way Kenya is liked by other white characters-- not only by Edwin (who balances out Jack)  but in a small and delightful way by a worker at the firm who tells a depressed Kenya he has a bottle of  Tequilla in his desk. Such touches are testimony to the director and actors. Lathan and Baker are superb; they create real people--in fact the one criticism of the film that I have is that Mark- the Blair  Underwood - character comes off as perhaps two demensional--though I hesitate even here. Perhaps his part  should have been larger but It must be difficult to craft an estimable character who somehow cannot offer what Kenya needs.Finally the architecture of the film beautifully parallels the landscape architecture in the film-- the way the color red is used throughout the film or even the way a  phrase like  ""no pressure"" is used point to the charm and importance of the film's syntax.The best film about black/white relations I can think of at the moment is  ""A Family Thing"" with Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones two of the finest living actors--but this film comes real close and is also a love story.

982004,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000F3UA5C,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[3, 3]","The great thing about this movie is that it really isn't about the controversy of racism but the truthful facts of it.  That black people can be just as racial as white people.  That there is truth to the `Black Tax' in the American business world and in some cases the assumption of that Tax is generated by paranoia of being judged because they are black.  The fact that some people cannot get past the notion that someone they are set up with is NOT of the same race (not just black or white).  The main message I got from this movie was not just being open to other races, but to something different.  The two characters In the movie are Brian (the white guy) and Kenya (the black woman).  Brian is a former suit and tie exec turned landscape architect.  Kenya is a CPA who is up for promotion to Partner in her firm.  After a shocking and fumbled attempt at a blind date where Kenya panics and ends it abruptly, because she obviously has a problem with him being white, she meets him again at a mutual friends engagement party.  Turns out he did the landscaping and Kenya ends up hiring him to do something with the backyard on her new house.  Brian notices that the interior of Kenya's house is bland and beige.  His desire to get her to try some color and styles starts her on the path of opening her mind.  This lends to getting us to think that this isn't just about going after the person who is the right color but just the right person.  This is really the primary message in the film, hence the title.  See people as people and not races and you gain perspective, objectivity and a better chance at finding the PERSON that is right for you.  Personalities and social beliefs are ingrained by our environment, not by our genetics.  We are (or were) taught by our parents and friends that you should only date someone in your race.  Excuses such as `Inter-racial relationships don't bother me but it's hard on the children' or `It could cause problems with our family or religion'; whatever people.  We're living in the 21st century.  We need to be more culturally diverse.  We need to experience what it's like to have relations with people from other cultures.  Otherwise we will stick ourselves in a rut that will keep us in a social salad bowl where no blending diversification is possible.  But I digress; the movie is very good.  It's romance-drama with some funny moments and some serious water cooler conversation pieces.  Both actors don't seem to be afraid to tackle the issue and they have great chemistry.  Most of the movie is from the perspective of Kenya, the successful black woman, and we get a look at every day black culture, good and bad.  We see her at work, with family and with friends.  All have their pros and cons.  Once the intimate relationship starts between the two, it's only for fun in Kenya's mind.  But as she realizes how much he adds to her lifestyle, she begins to rethink everything.  Wrapping up with something of a Hollywood ending, it's still a good ending.  There is no doubt that the Black-White dating hurdle is still the biggest in America.  This movie would not have been as big a deal if this pairing had been White-Hispanic or Asian-White or German-Indian or French-Pakistani.  Why is that?  There is no easy answer, but maybe the message here can get us closer.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","I had seen this twice and thought it was good film but the script was lacking some form of richness and depth for a big motion picture. The stereotypical depictions of whites loving dogs and camping and hiking and and blacks being mostly concerned about their physical appearance, wearing weaves, and bumping and grinding was a disappointment. It said to me that black women are superficial, contrary to whites who appreciate nature, animals and good fresh air and exercise. This isn't the first film that Sanaa Lathan has done regarding interracial relationships the first one she done is called ""Catfish in Black Bean Sauce"" which is a truly heart-warming movie. It's a story of a Vietnamese male (the protagonist) who fell in love with a beautiful black woman. It's very comical but extremely low budget film.Three things I'm going to give the film credit for in discussing things that probably no other mainstream film had the balls to tackle such as ""The Black Tax,"" the true difference between racism and reverse racism, and Black hair culture that was accompanied by two scene that standout pretty well. To me, a real connection is when you meet up with someone whom you don't have to adjust to, or adjust for. I don't recall him having to make many adjustments - but she had to, to fit in with him. The movie was focused too much on a preoccupation with sex, rather than a soulful connection. That's the key, a soulful connection. The chemistry between her mom and dad was moderately-existent but more from her dad, and where were Brian's friends? Let's talk about what his friends and family would think, say or do.Sanaa is very likable in this film and she has great acting range. Unfortunately, the script was weak and needed a bit of substance. It needed to show her growth, introspection and progression. Hopefully one day she gets the recognition she deserves in Hollywood. Blair Underwood is a skilled and under-used actor. I was glad to see him cast in this also. Alfre Woodard is also great actress but she does NOT make a good ""snooty"" mom. Interesting that this is the second time she has been paired up with Sanaa. She was Sanaa's ""snooty"" mother in Love and Basketball, too.Having said all of that, I do recognize that the movie was a comedy and while it should not be expected to make strong social statements, it was a missed opportunity to do just that. The issue is not ""dating a white guy is good (or better than dating a black man)"". The issue is, if the RIGHT guy just happens to be white, then don't let his being white prevent you from pursuing the relationship!

Racial issues are also front and center in the pic, although the traditional ideas about love and fulfillment predicatably come to the fore in the film's closing scenes.Sanaa Lathan playing oddly-named Kenya McQueen -- is this already a tipoff of a story about race and class divisions? -- is the female love interest and star of the show playing a successful accountant in a big New York firm. She comes from a wealthy background -- father a doctor, mother a socialite, sibilings and friends all eminently successful -- and she seems hidebound by the tradition-bound framework of her success.Enter blind date-landscape architect-boyfrined Brian (Simon Baker) who confuses her further by being attractive while being white, a blue collar professional, a guy whose dogs travels with him and, well, that other race. Conservative Kenya at first resists but later falls under his charm and the racial love story is on. Friends, family and cohorts chime in often on her affair, which takes a predicatable path, then recovers, then turns into a fairy tale at the end.Some big name actors lend a hand to this tale which is essentially a high class urban love story about people with everything going for them and one obvious conflict. The irony of this situation, it appears, is the inability of Kenya to see the obvious in spite of having everything else in life.I like this movie and would recommend it to anyone seeking a pleasing urban drama. The director ensures that no one overacts, the script doesn't try to do or say too much, and the perspectives presented are unusual enough to keep the typical love story fresh. In addition, the script makes no one an idiot, lighting is fantastic in every scene (so all the beautiful people look even more beautiful than they are), and the movie goes exactly where any romantic wants it to go.Last time I felt like this after a movie was with ""Certain Guys"", another romance the travailed a similar path without the racial conflict.

982016,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F3UA5C,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","""Something New"" is the story of Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan), a young professional black woman who is concerned with making partner at her accounting business and finding a partner for her romantic life.  She is having problems in both areas.  At work she is given a key client who does not like her, and whether it is because she is black, a woman, both, or because she is not telling him what he wants to hear (or all of the above), is not clear.  On the romantic front a friend at work sets her up with a blind date, who turns out to be Brian Kelly (Simon Baker), who is white.  He also happens to be a professional gardener (actually more of a landscape architect), and that would seem to constitute an additional gulf to their having a relationship, because Kenya comes from a family of professionals.  Her mother (Alfre Woodard) keeps score, her father (Earl Billings) keeps silent, and her brother, Nelson (Donald Faison) is almost as upset by his sister dating a gardener as he is by the idea that the guy is white.  Even her girl friends think all she is talking about here is a harmless fling.  But they do not make movies about harmless flings.The problem is not that Kenya might be falling in love with someone who is a different skin color, but that she might be falling in love period.  The biggest difference between these two is that Brian intends to stop and smell the roses and Kenya is not used to or even comfortable with the idea of making time for herself.  No wonder she is spending money on landscaping for her new home.  It is a lot easier to buy flowers and plants than it is to find a man.  Despite this, there are the early inroads to a romance between the two, which gets as far as kissing and sex.  But that is easy compared to what lies ahead.  A party with her friends is enough of a cold reception, but then there is a comedy club where a female comedienne empties a barrage on Brian and his relationship with a black woman.  If you thought Brian asking Kenya to change her hair was a major mistake in this relationship, then wait until he suggests they spend one night not talking about race.  Then throw into the mix Mark Harper (Blair Underwood), a black professional who Kenya's family would adopt if they cannot get him to marry Kenya.My complaint, if you want to call it that, is that the two best scenes in ""Something New"" both involve Kenya and another man, but neither of them is with Brian.  The first is between Kenya and her boss (Matt Malloy), where she has to deal with the consequences of her actions at the big meeting with the client who does not like her.  The second is with her father, played out in a location that is seldom used for talks between fathers and daughters.  Up until these scenes this movie was just not connecting with me, because I had bought into the idea that this was a romantic comedy, and that is not really true.  It is certainly not a comedy like ""Guess Who,"" where the racial issue is played for laughs, and it is not the sort of frank discussion we had in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" regarding interracial marriage.  What the two scenes prove that this really is about Kenya becoming a self-actualized person, which happens not only in regards to her love life but also the professional side of her life as well.  A big clue towards this is that we do not really have scenes of Bryan without Kenya or other characters in the picture.  This really is Kenya's story.Final Note: The working title of the film was ""42.4 Percent,"" which is the percent of African-American women that never get married.  That is certainly an impressive statistic, but fortunately they came up with a different title because the story told by screenwriter Kriss Turner and director Sanaa Hamri is not going to apply to most of the women that make up that particular percentage.  This is not to argue that this story is unrealistic, because even if it is not representative of why most African-American women do not get married, it is still a story worth telling.  I would think that ""Something New"" will strike a responsive chord with professional women, regardless of race.  The other working title for this 2006 film was ""Bloom.""",4,"""Something New"" is not a romantic comedy and it is not just about interracial love",1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,4190,"['Something', 'New', 'story', 'Kenya', 'McQueen', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'young', 'professional', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'concerned', 'making', 'partner', 'accounting', 'business', 'finding', 'partner', 'romantic', 'life', 'having', 'problems', 'areas', 'work', 'given', 'key', 'client', 'who', 'not', 'black', 'woman', 'not', 'telling', 'what', 'hear', 'above', 'not', 'clear', 'romantic', 'front', 'friend', 'work', 'sets', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'who', 'white', 'also', 'be', 'professional', 'gardener', 'actually', 'more', 'landscape', 'architect', 'would', 'seem', 'constitute', 'additional', 'gulf', 'having', 'relationship', 'Kenya', 'family', 'professionals', 'mother', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'score', 'father', 'Earl', 'Billings', 'silent', 'brother', 'Nelson', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'almost', 'upset', 'sister', 'dating', 'gardener', 'idea', 'guy', 'white', 'Even', 'girl', 'friends', 'think', 'talking', 'here', 'harmless', 'fling', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'movies', 'harmless', 'flings.The', 'problem', 'not', 'Kenya', 'might', 'be', 'falling', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'different', 'skin', 'color', 'might', 'be', 'falling', 'love', 'period', 'biggest', 'difference', 'two', 'Brian', 'stop', 'smell', 'roses', 'Kenya', 'not', 'used', 'even', 'comfortable', 'idea', 'making', 'time', 'herself', 'wonder', 'spending', 'money', 'landscaping', 'new', 'home', 'lot', 'easier', 'buy', 'flowers', 'plants', 'find', 'man', 'are', 'early', 'inroads', 'romance', 'two', 'as', 'far', 'kissing', 'sex', 'easy', 'compared', 'what', 'ahead', 'A', 'party', 'friends', 'enough', 'cold', 'reception', 'then', 'comedy', 'club', 'where', 'female', 'comedienne', 'barrage', 'Brian', 'relationship', 'black', 'woman', 'thought', 'Brian', 'asking', 'Kenya', 'change', 'hair', 'was', 'major', 'mistake', 'relationship', 'then', 'wait', 'spend', 'one', 'night', 'not', 'talking', 'race', 'Then', 'throw', 'mix', 'Mark', 'Harper', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'black', 'professional', 'who', 'Kenya', 'family', 'would', 'adopt', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'marry', 'Kenya.My', 'complaint', 'want', 'call', 'two', 'best', 'scenes', 'Something', 'New', 'involve', 'Kenya', 'man', 'Brian', 'first', 'Kenya', 'boss', 'Matt', 'Malloy', 'where', 'deal', 'consequences', 'actions', 'big', 'meeting', 'client', 'who', 'not', 'second', 'father', 'played', 'out', 'location', 'seldom', 'used', 'talks', 'fathers', 'daughters', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'connecting', 'had', 'bought', 'idea', 'was', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'certainly', 'not', 'comedy', 'Guess', 'Who', 'where', 'racial', 'issue', 'played', 'laughs', 'not', 'sort', 'frank', 'discussion', 'had', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'regarding', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'What', 'two', 'scenes', 'prove', 'really', 'Kenya', 'becoming', 'self-actualized', 'person', 'not', 'only', 'regards', 'love', 'life', 'also', 'professional', 'side', 'life', 'well', 'big', 'clue', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'scenes', 'Bryan', 'Kenya', 'other', 'characters', 'picture', 'really', 'Kenya', 'story.Final', 'Note', 'working', 'title', 'film', 'was', '42.4', 'Percent', 'percent', 'African-American', 'women', 'never', 'get', 'married', 'certainly', 'impressive', 'statistic', 'fortunately', 'came', 'up', 'different', 'title', 'story', 'told', 'screenwriter', 'Kriss', 'Turner', 'director', 'Sanaa', 'Hamri', 'not', 'going', 'apply', 'most', 'women', 'make', 'up', 'particular', 'percentage', 'not', 'argue', 'story', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'not', 'representative', 'why', 'most', 'African-American', 'women', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'married', 'still', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'would', 'think', 'Something', 'New', 'will', 'strike', 'responsive', 'chord', 'professional', 'women', 'regardless', 'race', 'other', 'working', 'title', '2006', 'film', 'was', 'Bloom']",N/A

982029,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000F3UA5C,mirasreviews,"[40, 45]","""Something New"" is a romantic comedy with a social agenda. Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan) is a workaholic investment banker with no time or patience for men. She yearns for companionship but has impossibly high -and very specific- standards. Urged by her friends to loosen up and ""let go"" of her concept of the ideal man, she agrees to a blind date arranged by a co-worker. If only the date were colorblind too. Kenya is set up with Brian Kelley (Simon Baker), a handsome, easy-going landscape architect who abandoned his corporate career to go into business doing what he loves. But Brian is white. Kenya is black. And white men are at the top of the list of things Kenya doesn't do. But she does need a landscaper for her new backyard. So she hires Brian, and their mutual attraction blossoms -to the variable horror and curiosity of Kenya's friends and family.The moral of the story is that social conventions don't always know best in matters of the heart: You might find the companion you seek if you are open to other possibilities. Kenya and Brian's story is predictable, but Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker are attractive and interesting to watch. The greater social insight of the film may be in Kenya's coterie of friends, all upper-middle class professional black women who fret over the dearth of suitable black men available to them. Their predicament and their views of men and race are interesting from the perspective of an outsider. White members of the audience will doubt Brian's willingness to tolerate the enormous chip Kenya carries on her shoulder. And he is more tolerant and self-sacrificing in the face of Kenya's self-absorption than is believable. But romantic comedies require some suspension of disbelief, and ""Something New"" is entertaining.The DVD (Universal 2006): In ""The Do's and Don'ts of Dating"" (5 min), 8 members of the cast give their do's and don'ts of dating and relationships.

While I saw why and how Bryan weedled his way into Kenya's heart, I never understood from his point of view what he loved about Kenya.  He seemed to be the one doing all the giving and bending over backwards, but I never saw Kenya doing the same from him.  What was it like to be around his parents his friends (did he have friends) and etc?  In that sense the film felt one sided and I didn't buy into the romance as deep as I should have.  Plus, the lead actors, in my opinion, totally didn't have any chemistry.  It pretty much involved her looking pissed off and him being at a loss as to what he did now to piss her off.

982035,A2N4AG4AK6HYEV,B000F3UA5C,Peggy Daniels,"[0, 0]","This love story about a driven black executive (Kenya) and a white down to earth landscaper (Brian) takes a unique approach to romance across racial lines. Kenya (Sanna Lathan) and Brian (Simon Baker, in his best film role) are an unlikely match for each other. Kenya has a list of what she wants in a man and her adherence to this list has rendered her dateless. One of her co-workers sets her up on a blind date with Brian. Kenya, who never imagined the blind date could be with a white man, is flustered and escapes as fast as she can. The same co-worker is about to get married and throws a party to celebrate. While there with her girlfriends, Kenya admires the landscaping and is taken aback when the landscaper turns out to be Brian. Brian isn't on Kenya's list because he doesn't have a high power job and he's not black. Brian, on the other hand, doesn't see Kenya as a black woman, he sees her as a beautiful woman. Unfortunately, Kenya is under a lot of pressure from her parents to find an upscale black man to marry. The development of Brian's love for Kenya, her struggle to overcome her conflicted feelings for Brian and her desire to please her parents make this a thoughtful, compelling and tender movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good romance and would like to see interracial relationships dealt with outside of the box they are usually put in.",5,A Charming Love Story,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1382,"['story', 'driven', 'black', 'executive', 'Kenya', 'white', 'down', 'earth', 'landscaper', 'Brian', 'unique', 'approach', 'romance', 'racial', 'lines', 'Kenya', 'Sanna', 'Lathan', 'Brian', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'best', 'film', 'role', 'are', 'unlikely', 'match', 'other', 'Kenya', 'list', 'what', 'man', 'adherence', 'list', 'rendered', 'dateless', 'One', 'co-workers', 'sets', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'Brian', 'Kenya', 'who', 'never', 'imagined', 'blind', 'date', 'could', 'be', 'white', 'man', 'flustered', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'same', 'co-worker', 'get', 'married', 'party', 'celebrate', 'girlfriends', 'Kenya', 'landscaping', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'landscaper', 'out', 'be', 'Brian', 'Brian', ""n't"", 'Kenya', 'list', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'power', 'job', 'not', 'black', 'Brian', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'see', 'Kenya', 'black', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Unfortunately', 'Kenya', 'lot', 'pressure', 'parents', 'find', 'upscale', 'black', 'man', 'marry', 'development', 'Brian', 'love', 'Kenya', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'Brian', 'desire', 'please', 'parents', 'make', 'thoughtful', 'compelling', 'tender', 'movie', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'romance', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'outside', 'box', 'are', 'usually', 'put']",N/A

The show's review just whet my appetite for more.I enjoy romances where two people from totally different worlds meet, fall in love and then work through the challenges of their different backgrounds. I normally feel that such relationships are stronger, deeper and richer.As the 'product' of such a marriage myself (my father is Indian and my mom is mixed as well - half Brit, half Portugese), I can understand how difficult it is to 'fit in'. Seeing Simon Baker trying to fit into Saan's world as he tries to strike up conversation with her friends and family reminded me of how uncomfortable my parents used to be around each other's family and friends.Kudos to the writers, producers and directors of the movie for bringing some of these 'fitting in' issues to light.  All those in mixed relationships will be able to relate.All said and done, I gave the movie four stars though as I have to agree with another reviewer, the two leads seemed uncomfortable and stiff with each other.

Kearns-White ""rockiw""","[4, 4]","When the movie Something New was being advertised on the Black radio station that I listen to earlier this year, it was being touted as ""a movie by Black women for Black women about what Black women want."" Because the movie is about a love affair between a Black woman and a White man, we are to believe that what Black women want are White men. As the DVD came to the stores, they changed the marketing a bit. It's now a romantic comedy about a Black woman trying to find Mr. Right, and race isn't even mentioned. After watching the movie, the latter marketing strategy was more accurate. This movie isn't as much about race as we are led to believe although some people aren't going to get past the race issue and pay attention to the deeper issues.Sanaa Lathan plays Kenya McQueen, a smart, beautiful, well-off, and a successful professional. All of the Black people in this movie are well-off and firmly entrenched in the upper-class. Although it was probably not Something New's intention, this movie is more about the division of class than race.Kenya and her girlfriends are looking for their ideal black man: well-spoken, well-educated, and be close to the same professional caliber. They want a man who is their class equal. Although it is  difficult, Kenya keeps hope alive for her IBM.Enter landscaper, Brian, played by Simon Baker. He's a small-business owner who makes a decent living.Brian and Kenya have a strong chemistry, but Kenya is very resistant to their relationship even before it begins. On the outside, she plays the race card saying she would prefer Black men. As the movie moves along and we get a deeper look into her upper-class upbringing, we realize that race is only the second problem. Brian is not upper class in the slightest. As the romance goes through its ups and downs, class and race battle it out for the cause.Something New is a refreshing twist on an old story, and a date movie that can cross racial barriers. Simon Baker and Sanaa Lathan heat up the screen with their furtive glances brimming with lust. When they finally come together, you'll exhale as though you were in the romantic clinch. Sanaa Lathan proves she is a great young actress as she conveys a thousand feelings with just a mere expression. I don't know where Hollywood has been hiding Simon Baker, but they need to get him into more movies pronto.",4,Not the Same Ol Black & White and that's Good,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2359,"['When', 'movie', 'Something', 'New', 'was', 'being', 'advertised', 'Black', 'radio', 'station', 'listen', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'being', 'touted', 'movie', 'Black', 'women', 'Black', 'women', 'what', 'Black', 'women', 'want', 'movie', 'love', 'affair', 'Black', 'woman', 'White', 'man', 'are', 'believe', 'what', 'Black', 'women', 'want', 'are', 'White', 'men', 'DVD', 'came', 'stores', 'changed', 'marketing', 'bit', 'now', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Black', 'woman', 'trying', 'find', 'Mr', 'Right', 'race', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'watching', 'movie', 'latter', 'marketing', 'strategy', 'was', 'more', 'accurate', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'race', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'race', 'issue', 'pay', 'attention', 'deeper', 'issues.Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Kenya', 'McQueen', 'smart', 'beautiful', 'well-off', 'successful', 'professional', 'Black', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'well-off', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'upper-class', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'Something', 'New', 'intention', 'movie', 'more', 'division', 'class', 'race.Kenya', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'looking', 'ideal', 'black', 'man', 'well-spoken', 'well-educated', 'be', 'close', 'same', 'professional', 'caliber', 'want', 'man', 'who', 'class', 'equal', 'difficult', 'Kenya', 'hope', 'alive', 'IBM.Enter', 'landscaper', 'Brian', 'played', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'small-business', 'owner', 'who', 'decent', 'living.Brian', 'Kenya', 'have', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'Kenya', 'very', 'resistant', 'relationship', 'even', 'outside', 'race', 'card', 'saying', 'would', 'prefer', 'Black', 'men', 'movie', 'along', 'get', 'deeper', 'look', 'upper-class', 'upbringing', 'realize', 'race', 'only', 'second', 'problem', 'Brian', 'not', 'upper', 'class', 'slightest', 'romance', 'ups', 'downs', 'class', 'race', 'battle', 'out', 'cause.Something', 'New', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'old', 'story', 'date', 'movie', 'can', 'cross', 'racial', 'barriers', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'heat', 'up', 'screen', 'furtive', 'glances', 'brimming', 'lust', 'When', 'finally', 'come', 'together', ""'ll"", 'exhale', 'were', 'romantic', 'clinch', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'great', 'young', 'actress', 'thousand', 'feelings', 'just', 'mere', 'expression', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'hiding', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'need', 'get', 'more', 'movies', 'pronto']",N/A
982042,A2OZTJ8QSNFGZ,B000F3UA5C,R. Wood,"[4, 11]","The considerable acting skills of Sanaa Lathan, Blair Underwood, and Simon Baker saved this movie from being a total and complete failure. The end result was that I enjoyed the movie. Not enough to buy it, but certainly enough to rent the DVD.Before I saw it, I assumed [as everyone should know by now] that the white guy would end up with the girl ... and I was not mistaken. The writer, by the way, is a sister, Kriss Turner. But, even so, I figured she would concede that if she wanted her script to sell, she had better play up to the White Male ego.Now, since so many of you reading this are now thinking ""another black guy playing the race card"" I challenge you to drop back two paces, take a deep breath, and consider all of Sanaa Lathan's work.I am an unabashed Sanaa Lathan fan. I make a point of checking out any thing I find out she is in. So, I have seen, and own in my private DVD collection,  ""Brothers"", ""Love and Basketball"", ""Disappearing Acts"", ""Best Man"", and ""Brown Sugar"". So, I think back over all of her movies and I find that all of her male romantic interests in all these movies were black and had some serious character flaws [remember Wesley Snipes' character in ""Disappearing Acts""]. The one exception to the rule, up until now, was ""Brothers"" and only because the movie ended before anything serious could develop between Sanaa's and Omar Epps' characters.So, now, we have a change up. In this her latest movie aptly named ""Something New"", her love interest is now white and is now as near to perfect as a writer can make a character without boring the audience to tears. Kudos to Simon Baker for figuring out how to take a boring weak white male lead character and mold him into this incredibly strong yet sensitive person who can be beat up throughout the entire movie by any and all of the other black characters and still come out at the end not looking like a big wussy.In ""Something New"", in the scene where Sanaa dumps Blair Underwood, she admits, tearfully, that Blair's character is perfect. After all, he is wealthy, good-looking, upwardly mobile,  and, well, he is Blair Underwood. Still, she just can't help herself.

I wasn't a fan of Sanaa Lathan at the time so that was strike one, and strike two was I just didn't get what the big deal was about dating. However, five years later and after some changes in my own personal and professional life, I do get the issues that come up with career-focused black women and dating. NOW it makes more sense to me, and I think I needed to just do some growing before I could relate to the film. For some odd reason, when I first saw the film, I didn't think the male lead (Simon Baker) was cute. Now I look at him and I think he's gorgeous. I truly don't know why I didn't think he was a cutie before. Maybe my taste has changed, too. Anyway, all of that put together and I sat down to watch the film again, and I enjoyed it. There were a couple of cons though.Cons: I just can't see a brotha referring to somebody as ""the help."" That seemed like a bit of a stretch to me, even with an elite family. Maybe it does happen, but it just seemed odd. I'm not saying he had to hug the man and give him dap, but a snide hello would've been more believable than a slap on the hand and an eye roll, talking about ""the help."" I also thought the ending with that mariachi outfit seemed to ridicule the point, and in the final scene, I thought that would be where the point should be driven home as powerful as possible. I wished the T-shirt and jeans would've stayed on.Pros: Everything else--excellent points about dating, work environment issues (although I am relieved to say I don't currently deal with the problems she did THANK GOODNESS!), and I even liked the topic of weaves versus real hair.

982049,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000F3UA5C,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[8, 9]","I fell in love with this movie from the first time I saw it. It's not just another film with an romantic interracial twist - this time it's told from a female black urban professional's point of view, which you really don't see very much. It could be classified as a light-hearted romantic comedy, and it does have its moments - but it also takes on some heavyweight issues and taboos about race, income and status, and does so very well. Sanaa Lathan, who is an excellent actress, is the main character, Kenya McQueen. She is successful in her career as a high-powered corporate CPA in a mostly white firm and enjoys what she does. But Kenya deep down longs for someone she can share her life with - preferably a man who has a similar upper-middle class background, similar goals - and definitely someone who is black. But her choices seem extremely limited, as are those of her friends, all single black professional women who are looking for love and marriage. It is all too well known that there are fewer black American males than females that are educated and without ""baggage"". So it knocks Kenya for a loop when she finds herself attracted to Brian Kelly (Simon Baker) - the cute and sexy white landscape architect she once had a blind date with (having no idea that he was white). After admiring the landscaping at a friend's engagement party, she learns that it was none other than Brian who was responsible for how beautiful everything looked. Despite her reservations, Kenya hires Brian to transform the backyard of her new home, which she recently purchased. Over time, their business relationship grows personal, and although Kenya is happy in her new romance, she worries about the opinions of her peers and upper middle-class family members.In this script, perhaps the problems that Kenya and Brian face are solved a bit simplistically, but in its defense, this is a film where the storyline is believable. Many successful, independent sistas in corporate America face the same kind of issues Kenya does - the frustrations involved with having co-workers and employers doubt their abilities merely because of their race and gender, regardless of their Ivy League education - and of course, their romantic choices - Sanaa Lathan nailed it down. She and Simon Baker have a nice, easy chemistry on screen and you find yourself rooting for their characters to get together. You honestly believe that the two of them share something very special, and their love for one another is real. After a while, you don't even care that this is a interracial romance - all you see are two people who love each other, regardless of the odds. My only fault with this film is that I would have liked the screenwriters to give us more info about Brian's life, other than how he got into botany and landscaping - what about his family, his friends and his upbringing? However, this movie is one I can't help but watch time and time again. For anyone who's ever been torn between following their heart and doing what they (and others, mind you) thought was best for them, I highly recommend this.",5,"""Something New"" is something special",1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,3091,"['fell', 'love', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'romantic', 'interracial', 'twist', 'time', 'told', 'female', 'black', 'urban', 'professional', 'point', 'view', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'classified', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', 'moments', 'also', 'heavyweight', 'issues', 'taboos', 'race', 'income', 'status', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'who', 'excellent', 'actress', 'main', 'character', 'Kenya', 'McQueen', 'successful', 'career', 'high-powered', 'corporate', 'CPA', 'mostly', 'white', 'firm', 'what', 'Kenya', 'deep', 'down', 'longs', 'someone', 'can', 'share', 'life', 'preferably', 'man', 'who', 'similar', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'background', 'similar', 'goals', 'definitely', 'someone', 'who', 'black', 'choices', 'seem', 'extremely', 'limited', 'are', 'friends', 'single', 'black', 'professional', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'love', 'marriage', 'too', 'well', 'known', 'are', 'fewer', 'black', 'American', 'males', 'females', 'are', 'educated', 'baggage', 'Kenya', 'loop', 'when', 'attracted', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'cute', 'sexy', 'white', 'landscape', 'architect', 'once', 'had', 'blind', 'date', 'having', 'idea', 'was', 'white', 'admiring', 'landscaping', 'friend', 'engagement', 'party', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Brian', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'how', 'beautiful', 'everything', 'looked', 'reservations', 'Kenya', 'Brian', 'transform', 'backyard', 'new', 'home', 'recently', 'purchased', 'time', 'business', 'relationship', 'personal', 'Kenya', 'happy', 'new', 'romance', 'opinions', 'peers', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'family', 'members.In', 'script', 'perhaps', 'problems', 'Kenya', 'Brian', 'face', 'are', 'solved', 'bit', 'simplistically', 'defense', 'film', 'where', 'storyline', 'believable', 'Many', 'successful', 'independent', 'sistas', 'corporate', 'America', 'face', 'same', 'kind', 'issues', 'Kenya', 'frustrations', 'involved', 'having', 'co-workers', 'employers', 'doubt', 'abilities', 'merely', 'race', 'gender', 'regardless', 'Ivy', 'League', 'education', 'course', 'romantic', 'choices', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'nailed', 'down', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'have', 'nice', 'easy', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'find', 'rooting', 'characters', 'get', 'together', 'honestly', 'believe', 'two', 'share', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'love', 'one', 'real', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'interracial', 'romance', 'see', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'regardless', 'odds', 'only', 'fault', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'screenwriters', 'give', 'more', 'info', 'Brian', 'life', 'other', 'how', 'got', 'botany', 'landscaping', 'what', 'family', 'friends', 'upbringing', 'However', 'movie', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'torn', 'following', 'heart', 'doing', 'what', 'others', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

It's rather sad in this day and age that a romantic comedy (which is exactly what this film is) becomes some sort of treatise (in the eyes of the more cynical) on race relations. I have the feeling that much of the discomfort with this film has nothing to do with the film at all, and *everything* to do with our personal ambiguous feelings on interracial relationships, especially interracial relationships featuring black/white pairings.  The first time I saw this film was in a mixed theater on L.A.'s Westside, and the myriad of reactions from the various filmgoers would be a grad thesis in itself.Don't believe me - think back to all the bruhaha over Halle Berry's and Billy Bob Thornton's love scene in 'Monster's Ball'.'Something New' does do something refreshing that very seldom happens in American cinema - black characters who transcend the stereotyped images so popular these days.  Kenya (played by the talented and gorgeous Sanaa Lathan) is a lot closer to the reality of black life than what is seen in the media.  There are many upwardly mobile and successful black women in this country (outside of Oprah of course).As is the staple in many romantic comedies that feature white actors, Kenya's looking for Mr. Right, not knowing that Mr. Right just so happens to be the white landscaper, Brian (Simon Baker, who's just so darn sexy).  The film is as much about the class differences between the white collar Kenya and the blue (or green) collar Brian as it is about their obvious racial differences.Of course, it's understood that Kenya's idea of the perfect man certainly isn't of the 'caucasian persuasion', and the prerequisite jokes and barbs follow.  Brian, on the other hand, simply sees this highly attractive and intelligent woman who just so happens to be black.I think the film's most poignant moment (and the one that makes me hit the *replay* button) is when Brian tells her that her natural hair is far more attractive than the fake stuff she's been wearing.  Talk about scoring big points with this 'natural sista'!  My boyfriend (who's Mexican--I'm Black) reached over to me in the theater and ran his fingers through my short crop and whispered ""they got that right"".And like all romantic comedies, this one wraps everything up in a nice, if not always tidy bow and sends the audience away with the faint hope that we're smart enough to see our shared humanity.

982055,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B000F3UA5C,Wanda B. Red,"[0, 0]","This is an enjoyable, well cast, and workmanlike romantic comedy -- neatly structured and satisfying to watch. All the plots and subplots come together to make the point that, while inter-racial relationships are not easy and racism pervades all quarters of American life, love wins out over racial barriers. In a way, that's the most fundamental of all American dreams -- so of course the viewer is happy to see everything work out for this adorable couple (Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker are a very cute pair). The other American dream (of professional success) also appears here and is likewise satisfactorily resolved. A real feel-good film -- nothing bad about that!Sometimes, however, I thought the movie set up its conflicts and made its arguments too easily. It was too obviously a film that set out to prove something: in this case that true love conquers all. I enjoy that message myself, but I didn't always feel that the film was making it emotionally believable or complicated enough. For example, Kenya's African American suitor (Mark played by the devilishly handsome Blair Underwood) appears in this film simply as a contrast to Brian. He is the ""IBM"" (Ideal Black Man), a moniker used in the film that somewhat betrays the stereotype he fulfills, but neither he -- nor the progress of his relationship with Kenya (which I shall refrain from revealing so as not to be a spoiler) has much depth. That subplot seems to exist simply to advance the main plot and make the film's larger point.  (And Underwood better watch out for being typecast -- He played this same part, too-good-to-be-true-but-I-don't-really-love-him, in ""Sex and the City"" opposite Miranda.)Still, this is a fun and wholesome movie.

982058,A1CMT6DOXS6Z8R,B000F3UA5C,W. Ellis,"[0, 0]","As you can probably guess by the picture, it's about a black woman, Kenya, dating a white man, Brian.  Forget the other guy in the picture, there's not much of love triangle going on.Kenya is somewhat of an uptight, highly successful and well-paid, professional woman who is setup on a blind date with landscape architect, Brian.  She is dismayed to find that Brian is white.The move portrays some of the issues that people in interracial relationships have to deal with, such as comments and attitudes from friends, family and society.  But most importantly, it portrays how they choose to deal with those comments and attitudes.  I thought, for the most part, that the issues were handled fairly well and examined in an entertaining, yet thought provoking manner.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was Kenya's attitude toward race.  I felt that someone with her educational and economic background should have built up much more of an immunity to the prejudices she has to face, especially in the workplace.  Kenya seems to be a bit too sensitive.  She was dismissive to Brian, almost to the point of rudeness, when she first met him,  and was extremely uncomfortable just being seen with him in a public place on their blind date.  Although she handles a situation superbly at work, she continues to let an incident, which she perceived to be racial affront, get under her skin.  We all know racism still exists, and when there's a blatant egregious act, we sometimes need to take appropriate actions to deal with it, but for the other, more minor issues, most people, especially those in the professional workplace, have learned to give people the benefit of the doubt and not allow a few idiots to get to us.  Also, there were a few scenes where she got disproportionately upset with Brian because he asked about her hair.  There's also another scene where she gets caught in the rain, and screams, &#34;My hair!&#34; while trying to run for cover ... really.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and found it entertaining.  Other than some of Kenya's reactions, the movie didn't try to hard to be about an interracial couple, but just a love story about two people, with some interesting differences.",4,Really liked this movie!,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2218,"['can', 'probably', 'guess', 'picture', 'black', 'woman', 'Kenya', 'dating', 'white', 'man', 'Brian', 'Forget', 'other', 'guy', 'picture', 'not', 'much', 'love', 'triangle', 'going', 'somewhat', 'uptight', 'highly', 'successful', 'well-paid', 'professional', 'woman', 'who', 'setup', 'blind', 'date', 'landscape', 'architect', 'Brian', 'dismayed', 'find', 'Brian', 'white.The', 'move', 'issues', 'people', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'have', 'deal', 'such', 'comments', 'attitudes', 'friends', 'family', 'society', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'choose', 'deal', 'comments', 'attitudes', 'thought', 'most', 'part', 'issues', 'were', 'handled', 'fairly', 'well', 'examined', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'thought', 'provoking', 'manner.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'Kenya', 'attitude', 'race', 'felt', 'someone', 'educational', 'economic', 'background', 'should', 'have', 'built', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'immunity', 'prejudices', 'face', 'especially', 'workplace', 'Kenya', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'sensitive', 'was', 'dismissive', 'Brian', 'almost', 'point', 'rudeness', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'was', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'just', 'being', 'seen', 'public', 'place', 'blind', 'date', 'situation', 'superbly', 'work', 'let', 'incident', 'perceived', 'be', 'racial', 'affront', 'get', 'skin', 'know', 'racism', 'still', 'when', 'blatant', 'egregious', 'act', 'sometimes', 'need', 'take', 'appropriate', 'actions', 'deal', 'other', 'more', 'minor', 'issues', 'most', 'people', 'especially', 'professional', 'workplace', 'have', 'learned', 'give', 'people', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'not', 'allow', 'few', 'idiots', 'get', 'Also', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'got', 'disproportionately', 'upset', 'Brian', 'asked', 'hair', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'caught', 'rain', 'screams', '34', 'My', 'hair', '34', 'trying', 'run', 'cover', 'really.Overall', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'found', 'entertaining', 'Other', 'Kenya', 'reactions', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'be', 'interracial', 'couple', 'just', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'interesting', 'differences']",N/A
