The two art forms have quite a bit in common and it seems like a natural marriage. However, if the execution is as bad as it is in this DVD, I'd rather the potential be left unexplored.The animation in this movie is terrible. Maybe it would have been impressive ten years ago, but since then we've been spoiled by the likes of ""Toy Story,"" ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" This movie can't possibly measure up. The motions are jerky, the backgrounds don't blend, any character with hair or loose fur looks terrible... if you've got the ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Shrek"" DVDs, you've seen the test animation they did on those two far superior films. This entire movie looks like that kind of animation.And the story is.. okay, it's a kid's movie, but it's a REALLY predictable kid's movie. While I have to confess there were a few clever ideas -- the kite that's afraid of heights, for instance -- the music and story just are nowhere near as good as the original. Granted, that's a high bar to hurdle -- however, if you're going to fall this short, you'd be better off trying something else. Heck, the titular &quot;Island of Misfit Toys&quot; barely plays into the story at all.If this movie had been made in the early 90s,  it might have been interesting.

Regarding the songs, they are horrendous (which is why it loses a point in my rating), but the cartoon, story and all, surprised the heck out of me! All the lovable characters (including Charlie-in-the-box) from the 1964 classic is brought back with a new set of vocal talents that sound so much like the original cast, it's breath-taking and a little eerie. Yes, it's computer-animated instead of the stop-action of the '64 original, but so much attention, care, and love was given to the details, it doesn't become an issue and it gives this installment its own special charm.Even a new twist on the social issue of Rudolph wishing to be like all the other reindeers was thought-provoking, clever, and wonderfully done. The animators even gave new dimension to Rudolph's nonconformity that does not, in my opinion, ruin the charm of the original. If anything, I look at it as Rudolph's nose changing its nature as he grows older, just as children's traits grow and change and evolve as they go through life.The writers and animators thought of everything, including Rudolph's continuing relationship with Clarisse, and even giving Hermie the elf a love interest after graduating from Dental School. There are lots of in-jokes galore, including Hermie's vehicle having a modern-day alarm remote that chirps when activated, and there's even a ""borrowing"" from ""Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom.""The main crux of the story is a dark character called the Toy Taker who has taken toys everywhere including all of the toys in Santa's workshop, and it's up to Rudolph and his friends to solve the mystery, catch the Toy Taker and return the toys in time for Santa's run on Christmas Eve.With all that being said, I heartily recommend you buy or rent this wonderful movie and be in for the treat of your life ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of the 1964 original!!",4,A wonderful addition to the Rudolph story,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,1992,"['picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'garage', 'sale', 'thinking', 'was', '1964', 'classic', 'read', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'home', 'discover', 'sequel', 'Regarding', 'songs', 'are', 'horrendous', 'why', 'point', 'rating', 'cartoon', 'story', 'surprised', 'heck', 'lovable', 'characters', 'including', 'Charlie-in-the-box', '1964', 'classic', 'brought', 'back', 'new', 'set', 'vocal', 'talents', 'sound', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'cast', 'breath-taking', 'little', 'eerie', 'Yes', 'computer-animated', 'instead', 'stop-action', ""'64"", 'original', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'care', 'love', 'was', 'given', 'details', ""n't"", 'become', 'issue', 'installment', 'own', 'special', 'charm.Even', 'new', 'twist', 'social', 'issue', 'Rudolph', 'wishing', 'be', 'other', 'reindeers', 'was', 'thought-provoking', 'clever', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'animators', 'even', 'gave', 'new', 'dimension', 'Rudolph', 'nonconformity', 'not', 'opinion', 'ruin', 'charm', 'original', 'anything', 'look', 'Rudolph', 'nose', 'changing', 'nature', 'older', 'just', 'children', 'traits', 'grow', 'change', 'evolve', 'go', 'life.The', 'writers', 'animators', 'thought', 'everything', 'including', 'Rudolph', 'continuing', 'relationship', 'Clarisse', 'even', 'giving', 'Hermie', 'elf', 'love', 'interest', 'graduating', 'Dental', 'School', 'are', 'lots', 'in-jokes', 'galore', 'including', 'Hermie', 'vehicle', 'having', 'modern-day', 'alarm', 'remote', 'chirps', 'when', 'activated', 'even', 'borrowing', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'main', 'crux', 'story', 'dark', 'character', 'called', 'Toy', 'Taker', 'who', 'taken', 'toys', 'everywhere', 'including', 'toys', 'Santa', 'workshop', 'up', 'Rudolph', 'friends', 'solve', 'mystery', 'catch', 'Toy', 'Taker', 'return', 'toys', 'time', 'Santa', 'run', 'Christmas', 'Eve.With', 'being', 'said', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'buy', 'rent', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'be', 'treat', 'life', 'ESPECIALLY', ""'re"", 'fan', '1964', 'original']",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer & the Island of Misfit Toys

I found it to be very colorful and Christmas-y looking, although the characters did lack facial emotions (at some points in the film, some of the characters reminded me of the ghosts from &quot;Pac-Man&quot;). I'm not an expert on computer animation but I liked what was done here....a little bit weird....but weird is good.The story was cute - it concerned the faceless Toytaker who sucks up toys through a giant vacuum into his blimp. Most of the original characters were here (Rudolph, Clarice, Hermey the Dentist, Yukon Cornelius, Charley-in-the-Box, King Moonracer etc...) as well as a few new ones (a different Snowman narrator, a pink hippo who performs plastic surgery on toys, a piggy bank with no slot for coins etc...) I felt, after viewing this, that the makers did actually have a genuine like and respect for their predecessor (after all, imitation is the highest form of flattery) and that they tried to keep the look and sound of everyone as close to the original as they could.The burning question of the original....&quot;What exactly was wrong with the doll that caused her to be on the Island Of Misfit Toys&quot;?....is never answered in this sequel and I guess, will forever remain one of the great mysteries of our time.The one thing I did not like about this special were the songs...the best of which were bare-able, the worst of which were pretty bad. While an excellent score like that of Rankin/Bass's &quot;Rudolph&quot; would be almost impossible to top, this one did not even come close.But overall, a very enjoyable Christmas special (especially for kids) that I will probably watch again. However, I think when all is said and done....in a couple years, this show will fade away - like the other &quot;Good Times&quot; Rudolph remake a few years back - and the original classic will still be shining as brightly as Rudolph's nose!",4,Not as good as the original but a nice try!,1008547200,"12 17, 2001",2001,2240,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', '1964', 'Rankin/Bass', 'puppet-animated', 'masterpiece', 'immediately', 'took', 'offense', 'computer-animated', 'sequel', 'watched', 'movie', 'pretty', 'intent', 'hating', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'sequel', ""'d"", 'least', 'use', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'surprise', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'colorful', 'Christmas-y', 'looking', 'characters', 'did', 'lack', 'facial', 'emotions', 'points', 'film', 'characters', 'reminded', 'ghosts', 'quot', 'Pac-Man', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'computer', 'animation', 'liked', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'here', '.a', 'little', 'bit', 'weird', '.but', 'weird', 'good.The', 'story', 'was', 'cute', 'concerned', 'faceless', 'Toytaker', 'who', 'up', 'toys', 'giant', 'vacuum', 'blimp', 'Most', 'original', 'characters', 'were', 'here', 'Rudolph', 'Clarice', 'Hermey', 'Dentist', 'Yukon', 'Cornelius', 'Charley-in-the-Box', 'King', 'Moonracer', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'different', 'Snowman', 'narrator', 'pink', 'hippo', 'who', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'toys', 'piggy', 'bank', 'slot', 'coins', 'etc', 'felt', 'viewing', 'makers', 'did', 'actually', 'have', 'genuine', 'respect', 'predecessor', 'imitation', 'highest', 'form', 'flattery', 'tried', 'keep', 'look', 'sound', 'everyone', 'close', 'original', 'could.The', 'burning', 'question', 'original', 'quot', 'What', 'exactly', 'was', 'wrong', 'doll', 'caused', 'be', 'Island', 'Misfit', 'Toys', 'quot', 'never', 'answered', 'sequel', 'guess', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'one', 'great', 'mysteries', 'time.The', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'special', 'were', 'songs', 'best', 'were', 'bare-able', 'worst', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'excellent', 'score', 'Rankin/Bass', 'quot', 'Rudolph', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'top', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close.But', 'overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Christmas', 'special', 'especially', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'However', 'think', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'couple', 'years', 'show', 'will', 'fade', 'away', 'other', 'quot', 'Good', 'Times', 'quot', 'Rudolph', 'remake', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'original', 'classic', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'shining', 'as', 'brightly', 'Rudolph', 'nose']",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer & the Island of Misfit Toys

I was a huge fan of the old Rakin/Bass incarnation of Rudolph, and was excited to get this video, but I hafta say it's pretty low rent.The animators did a fine job of creating computer models of the characters. Problem is, they seemed to stop there. Things are rendered often very basically, with no texture. Rudolph himself appears smooth and hairless, which may actually be a good thing seeing as how Bumbles' fur and Yukon Cornelias's beard appear to exist in a dimemsion slightly removed from the characters they're attatched to. It's not that I'm against the classic characters being rendered via computer animation, it's that I'm against them being rendered via BAD computer animation. Contrary to what the Amazon.com staff critic says, this movie doesn't look &quot;sharp&quot;. In places, it looks quite bad.It would be nice if the story and writing were interesting enough to carry the day despite the technical limitations, but they're not.

This tale was obviously made by people who have a great deal of love and respect for the 1964 classic original.  They have worked very hard to use computer animation to come as close as possible to the look of the old stop-motion animation, and I think they have succeeded.  The characters' movements are a bit smoother than the original, but that is about the only difference.Returning from the '60s are Rudolph, the reindeer of the famous shiny nose, his dentist/elf buddy Hermie, the whacked-out miner Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable Snow Monster (will he ever learn to swim?), Rudolph's girlfriend Clarice, all of the minor characters, and of course, Santa Claus.  They have come together to investigate the mysterious Toy Taker, who has managed to succesfully pirate all the world's toys, including Santa's workshop itself.  The new actors provided to give voice to the classic characters all sound perfect.  Richard Dreyfuss does well in a role as the obligatory snowman narrarator (though I do miss Burl Ives), and Jamie Lee Curtis puts in an appearance as the Hippo Queen.  Rick Moranis provides the voice of the Toy Taker himself.Like many others out there, I grew up watching the original stop-motion Rudolph every year.  I was a little worried that this wouldn't be any good, especially when I saw the GoodTimes label on it.  But, my kids LOVE it!  And, it was produced for them, after all.  This movie makes absolutely NO pretense whatsoever that it was designed and produced for anyone but preschoolers, and it certainly succeeded with mine.As adults, we see the world with different perspectives than we did as little kids.  Nothing, no matter how well done, will ever recapture the joys of the specials we saw for the first time as little kids back when you only had a chance to watch these shows once or twice a year.  Especially since now you can buy them on DVD or VHS and watch them over and over, any time you want.  Anything is more special when you are a kid and it is only availble to watch once a year.The animation is not the most top-notch out there, but then, it's not supposed to be.  It's more concerned with looking like the original, with all its flaws due to 60's technology.  And yes, the plot is not the most original in the world.  Any parent will figure out the identity and motives of the Toy Taker before the movie is half over.
