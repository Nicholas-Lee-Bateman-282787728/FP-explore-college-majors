The acting was terrible.  Cheesy.  Not scary at all.  But for 5 dollars, who cares?

If you are reading these reviews and are interested based on the actually pretty decent design on the dvd cover, well get it just for the artwork then, and listen to all these reviewers. I would gamble with a 6 in 10 chance my McDonalds Fries will be cold and soggy, rather than buy this dvd and hope you would find it scary, decent or full of cinematic wonderment. It is utterly repulsive; the script, the reactions on screen, pure 'B' movie talent (for lack of a better word), and even the Japanese should be ashamed of themselves, but then again (for the most part) most of their horror films reak of amaetur fodder anyway, so listen save your well earned dollar.

First of all, the highway was not haunted, so I was kind of let down there.  Also, as I saw our hero driving I kept thinking: ""What kind of a highway is this?"" Most of the time it was just a single lane through the forest, so it really wasn't a highway as I would describe it. No highway and it wasn't haunted.  Okay, what about the plot?  Actually, it wasn't completely bad, but the title should have been something like 'Road to madness"" or ""Driving me crazy"" or something. Rand Gamble gives a sincere if less than stellar performance as the main character but to tell the truth I liked the girl (Hinano Yoshikawa)he was having the affair with, Yumie.  She alternated between gorgeous and scary.  I also liked the wife, played by Laura Putney.  Not sure why he would be having an affair if he was married to Laura Putney who obviously loved him.  My biggest problem with this film is that it tried to deliver a lot of quick cheap scares, with apparitions appearing and vanishing and of course a hand grabbing the hero in the boat, but there never was any real feeling of terror.  It just did not achieve believability like this could actually be happening.

As essentially a Japanese horror film, it has some things in common with ""The Grudge."" Here again, we have a haunting who delivers the chills by having her face curtained with hanging hair. I'm not sure why hiding an apparition behind strands of hair is so eerie an effect - but it is.Also, the premise of driving along a lonely road at night is eerie in and of itself. And when you have a dead body in the trunk of your car - the ride becomes doubly fraught with danger.The acting is generally wooden. The actress who plays one of the lead love interests is Japanese with a very limited, stilted command of the English language. With so many actors eagerly available to appear in films, I don't know why they can't find some better talent.So, this film isn't very memorable. But it isn't a complete waste of time.

993856,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FP2YXG,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 6]","""Haunted Highway"" is a low-budget horror suspense directed by Japanese director. You may expect something scary and creepy like the original version of ""Ring,"" but ""Haunted Highway"" is actually more like a ride to boredom, where nothing but familiar tricks of horror genre happens.The film is about an American photographer Greg (Rand Gamble) who has an affair with a Japanese model Yumi (Hinano Yoshikawa). Bitter accusation from his wife Amanda (Laura Putney) leads to one accident, which forces Greg to drive on the deserted midnight road to the lake. On the way Greg encounters several weird things that might drive his mind which is already confused to insanity.To create a gripping suspense or horror using a confined space like a car is a really challenging thing, but judging from the film the filmmaker is not up to the task. From the opening credit (that looks like David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"") to its ending, there is nothing that would interest us. The film uses up all the tricks in its first half, and the inserted flashback scenes (of which content is already suggested in the pre-credit section) are just unnecessary. The film's passable acting and creaky dialogues (especially in the first scene) do not help. Hinano Yoshikawa is not known for her acting talent in Japan, but I never expected she could be that bad.But probably she should not be blamed because, according to the film's official homepage, her English is dubbed by someone else. That fact makes me wonder why Japanese director Junichi Suzuki decided to make an English-speaking film entirely shot in America while the film's locations and characters do not need to be American (almost all the events on the ""highway"" scenes happen during one night). I know Mr. Suzuki has been living in USA since 2001, but wouldn't it be a better choice for him to shoot a film in Japan where he had been working for a long time?Anyway I agree with most of the previous reviewers who say ""Haunted Highway"" is a terrible film.
