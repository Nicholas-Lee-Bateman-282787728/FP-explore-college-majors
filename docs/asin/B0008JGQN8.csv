899258,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0008JGQN8,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[4, 4]","To purchase ELMER GANTRY and BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ separately in DVD format would cost nearly sixty dollars.  In this budget DVD (one disc, single-sided) both movies can be had (currently) for less than ten dollars.Both films are essentially vehicles for Burt Lancaster at the peak of his career.  BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (1962) is in B&W;, starring Lancaster as the legendary (some would say notorious) Robert Stroud (1890-1963), a murderer who, with the help of an additional murder in the pen, was sentenced to death but had his conviction commuted to life based on an appeal by his mother to President Wilson through Edith Bolling Wilson (Stroud's mother beautifully underplayed here by Thelma Ritter).  Stroud was hardly a lovable character in real life and Lancaster plays him as largely humorless, but compassionate, in a role that required him to age roughly fifty years.  The job of the funny con in the next cell fell to Telly Savalas, who was lovable.  This admirable cast is rounded out by Karl Malden, Betty Field, Huge Marlowe, Whit Bissell and Edmond O'Brien in a cameo based on Stoud's biographer, Thomas E. Gaddis.  John Frankenheimer (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) directed.ELMER GANTRY (1960), in color, was based on the eponymous 1927 novel by Sinclair Lewis about a magnetic salesman who becomes an even more magnetic charlatan as a traveling evangelist who hits the top.  Jean Simmons plays mentor-turned-preaching partner ""Sister"" Sharon Falconer, who was largely patterned after Aimee Semple McPherson.  Shirley Jones played a cathouse hooker (originally a sweet girl whom Elmer had jilted and ""ruined"") and did it so vividly, and in such a departure from her previous roles as Rodgers & Hammerstein singing sopranos, that she snagged the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  With Patti Page as choir mistress and Edward Andrews in a wonderfully comic turn as the sputtering George Babbitt of Zenith, part of a gang of businessmen who recruit Gantry to help quell labor unrest (does anything ever change?).  A bit shrill at times, but solid.  Lancaster portrays Gantry as the eternal con man equally adept at hustling vacuum cleaners and souls, much as author Lewis wrote him, but the actor's intelligence triumphs over the essentially doltish Gantry.  Directed by Richard Brooks.These two fine movies were released by United Artists, which means they fell under ownership of MGM, which released them as this ""Two-Pack.""  They are both in 'scope and the anamorphic quality of them is apparent, but play out from this disc with no objectionable level of distortion.  GANTRY was filmed in Eastmancolor, which at this remove shows browns and reds better than greens, but I've seen the film on the standard DVD and this one was no worse in its color rendition.  However, this DVD is as no-frills as it gets with no side features, no trailers, not even stops for Scene Selections.  Highly recommended, with plenty of money left over for popcorn, birdseed, and the paperbackElmer Gantryall around.IMDb comparison ratings (Burt Lancaster movies):THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS (1957)  -  8.2ELMER GANTRY (1960)  -  7.9THE BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (1962)  -  7.8",5,Burt Lancaster Double Feature - Great Price,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3154,"['purchase', 'ELMER', 'GANTRY', 'BIRDMAN', 'OF', 'ALCATRAZ', 'separately', 'DVD', 'format', 'would', 'cost', 'nearly', 'sixty', 'dollars', 'budget', 'DVD', 'one', 'disc', 'single-sided', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'currently', 'less', 'ten', 'dollars.Both', 'films', 'are', 'essentially', 'vehicles', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'peak', 'career', 'BIRDMAN', 'ALCATRAZ', '1962', 'B', 'W', 'starring', 'Lancaster', 'legendary', 'would', 'say', 'notorious', 'Robert', 'Stroud', '1890-1963', 'murderer', 'who', 'help', 'additional', 'murder', 'pen', 'was', 'sentenced', 'death', 'had', 'conviction', 'commuted', 'life', 'based', 'appeal', 'mother', 'President', 'Wilson', 'Edith', 'Bolling', 'Wilson', 'Stroud', 'mother', 'beautifully', 'underplayed', 'here', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Stroud', 'was', 'hardly', 'lovable', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'Lancaster', 'largely', 'humorless', 'compassionate', 'role', 'required', 'age', 'roughly', 'fifty', 'years', 'job', 'funny', 'con', 'next', 'cell', 'fell', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'who', 'was', 'lovable', 'admirable', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Betty', 'Field', 'Huge', 'Marlowe', 'Whit', 'Bissell', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'cameo', 'based', 'Stoud', 'biographer', 'Thomas', 'E.', 'Gaddis', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'THE', 'MANCHURIAN', 'CANDIDATE', 'directed.ELMER', 'GANTRY', '1960', 'color', 'was', 'based', 'eponymous', '1927', 'novel', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'magnetic', 'salesman', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'magnetic', 'charlatan', 'traveling', 'evangelist', 'who', 'top', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'mentor-turned-preaching', 'partner', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'Falconer', 'who', 'was', 'largely', 'patterned', 'Aimee', 'Semple', 'McPherson', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'played', 'cathouse', 'hooker', 'originally', 'sweet', 'girl', 'whom', 'Elmer', 'had', 'jilted', 'ruined', 'did', 'so', 'vividly', 'such', 'departure', 'previous', 'roles', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'singing', 'sopranos', 'snagged', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Patti', 'Page', 'choir', 'mistress', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'wonderfully', 'comic', 'turn', 'sputtering', 'George', 'Babbitt', 'Zenith', 'part', 'gang', 'businessmen', 'who', 'recruit', 'Gantry', 'help', 'quell', 'labor', 'unrest', 'anything', 'ever', 'change', 'bit', 'shrill', 'times', 'solid', 'Lancaster', 'Gantry', 'eternal', 'con', 'man', 'equally', 'hustling', 'vacuum', 'cleaners', 'souls', 'much', 'author', 'Lewis', 'wrote', 'actor', 'intelligence', 'triumphs', 'essentially', 'doltish', 'Gantry', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Brooks.These', 'two', 'fine', 'movies', 'were', 'released', 'United', 'Artists', 'fell', 'ownership', 'MGM', 'released', 'Two-Pack', 'are', ""'scope"", 'anamorphic', 'quality', 'apparent', 'play', 'out', 'disc', 'objectionable', 'level', 'distortion', 'GANTRY', 'was', 'filmed', 'Eastmancolor', 'remove', 'browns', 'reds', 'better', 'greens', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'standard', 'DVD', 'one', 'was', 'worse', 'color', 'rendition', 'However', 'DVD', 'as', 'no-frills', 'side', 'trailers', 'not', 'even', 'Scene', 'Selections', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'plenty', 'money', 'left', 'over', 'popcorn', 'birdseed', 'paperbackElmer', 'Gantryall', 'comparison', 'ratings', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'movies', 'SWEET', 'SMELL', 'OF', 'SUCCESS', '1957', '8.2ELMER', 'GANTRY', '1960', '7.9THE', 'BIRDMAN', 'OF', 'ALCATRAZ', '1962', '7.8']",Birdman Of Alcatraz/Elmer Gantry
899259,AGENS6MY9PZGW,B0008JGQN8,Anthony Mitchell,"[0, 0]","I had never seen a Burt Lancaster movie before ordering this product.  I have to say that now I would pay to see all of his work.  I had only vaguely heard of Birdman of Alcatraz.  I knew there was a real man called the Birdman of Alcatraz.  This movie surprised me at his accomplishments.  He forms a bond with the sparrow and later on the canaries he keeps in solitary in Leavenworth Prison and even concocts a medicine to cure them of a popular illness.  I had no idea he made such strides in the field.  His character is extremely anti-social and violent in the beginning but his change into a more intelligent, gentle soul over time is very inspiring.  Lancaster delivers in this part which drew him an Oscar nomination.And then there's Elmer Gantry.  I had heard about this movie years ago but never got around to watching it until now and I am glad.  I am older now and this film means more to me now than it would have years ago as a younger man.  Burt Lancaster shines every single second in this film about a salesman turned preacher.  he brings so much life to the part and is more convincing than just about any other actor I've ever seen.  The cinematography and musical performances are breath taking and Lancaster himself proves he had a remarkable singing voice.  While Lancaster may be gone, he sure seems alive in this movie.  If you have never seen a Lancaster movie, this is the ultimate introduction and even though there are no extras, the movies themselves are excellent.  And at this price, it is a steal!",5,Lancaster is Superb,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1529,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'movie', 'ordering', 'product', 'have', 'say', 'now', 'would', 'pay', 'see', 'work', 'had', 'only', 'vaguely', 'heard', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'knew', 'was', 'real', 'man', 'called', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'movie', 'surprised', 'accomplishments', 'bond', 'sparrow', 'later', 'canaries', 'solitary', 'Leavenworth', 'Prison', 'even', 'medicine', 'cure', 'popular', 'illness', 'had', 'idea', 'made', 'such', 'strides', 'field', 'character', 'extremely', 'anti-social', 'violent', 'beginning', 'change', 'more', 'intelligent', 'gentle', 'soul', 'time', 'very', 'inspiring', 'Lancaster', 'delivers', 'part', 'drew', 'Oscar', 'nomination.And', 'then', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'had', 'heard', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'now', 'am', 'glad', 'am', 'older', 'now', 'film', 'more', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'years', 'ago', 'younger', 'man', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'shines', 'single', 'second', 'film', 'salesman', 'turned', 'preacher', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'part', 'more', 'convincing', 'just', 'other', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'breath', 'taking', 'Lancaster', 'had', 'remarkable', 'singing', 'voice', 'Lancaster', 'may', 'be', 'gone', 'sure', 'alive', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Lancaster', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'introduction', 'even', 'are', 'extras', 'movies', 'are', 'excellent', 'price', 'steal']",Birdman Of Alcatraz/Elmer Gantry
