I think, considering his life and his personal difficulties, that its amazing Brian continues to write such fantastic music. So I purchased this DVD and was pleasantly surprised by the live performance and mostly the Documentary and behind-the-scenes footage of Brian and his band in the studio.If you're a fan of Brian and/or the ""That Lucky Old Sun"" album, this is definitely worth the money.",5,Awesome,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,498,"['have', 'had', 'CD', 'Lucky', 'Old', 'Sun', 'ever', 'came', 'out', 'music', 'really', 'grown', 'think', 'considering', 'life', 'personal', 'difficulties', 'amazing', 'Brian', 'write', 'such', 'fantastic', 'music', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'live', 'performance', 'mostly', 'Documentary', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'Brian', 'band', 'studio.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Brian', 'Lucky', 'Old', 'Sun', 'album', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money']",Brian Wilson: That Lucky Old Sun

For me personally, the bonus features are the best part of the dvd, though - particularly the Yahoo set and the Black Cab Session.I was very disappointed in the way the producers decided to present the actual TLOS ""concert"".  First off, the performance was in front of a very small audience at Capitol Records.  Although the crowd was enthusiastic, the actual concert I saw in November at the Ryman in Nashville was much more energetic and I'm not sure this dvd fully captures that energy.  Secondly, the vocals on the dvd are, to my ear, over-produced.  There is far more effect on Brian's vocals on the dvd than on the studio album and it contributes to making the dvd sound more like a studio recording than a live concert.  Additionally, Brian's vocals are so heavily overdubbed that at times it looks like he's lip-synching to a record.  Overdubbing the occasional bad note is one thing.  Completely re-recording and replacing the vocal performance that accompanied the video, on the other hand is something altogether different.  My personal preference is for music dvd's to contain the actual performance that was heard by the audience - mistakes and all.  The occasional off-pitch notes are like flaws in fine leather in that they verify the authenticity of the product.  Brian was in such fine voice on the TLOS tour that the overdubbing was, in my opinion, unnecessary and more of a distraction than an improvement.Don't take my observations as suggestions that the dvd is not worthwhile, though, because TLOS is a moving, finely crafted work and the dvd is a treasure for fans of Brian Wilson.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dvd and highly recommend it to others as well.",5,Definitely worthwhile,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1770,"['huge', 'fan', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Brian', 'TLOS', 'album', 'was', 'destined', 'like', 'dvd', 'personally', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'dvd', 'particularly', 'Yahoo', 'set', 'Black', 'Cab', 'Session.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'way', 'producers', 'decided', 'present', 'actual', 'TLOS', 'concert', 'First', 'performance', 'was', 'front', 'very', 'small', 'audience', 'Capitol', 'Records', 'crowd', 'was', 'enthusiastic', 'actual', 'concert', 'saw', 'November', 'Ryman', 'Nashville', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'energetic', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'dvd', 'fully', 'energy', 'Secondly', 'vocals', 'dvd', 'are', 'ear', 'over-produced', 'far', 'more', 'effect', 'Brian', 'vocals', 'dvd', 'studio', 'album', 'making', 'dvd', 'sound', 'more', 'studio', 'recording', 'live', 'concert', 'Additionally', 'Brian', 'vocals', 'are', 'so', 'heavily', 'overdubbed', 'times', 'lip-synching', 'record', 'Overdubbing', 'occasional', 'bad', 'note', 'one', 'thing', 'Completely', 're-recording', 'replacing', 'vocal', 'performance', 'accompanied', 'video', 'other', 'hand', 'something', 'altogether', 'different', 'personal', 'preference', 'music', 'dvd', 'contain', 'actual', 'performance', 'was', 'heard', 'audience', 'mistakes', 'occasional', 'off-pitch', 'notes', 'are', 'flaws', 'fine', 'leather', 'verify', 'authenticity', 'product', 'Brian', 'was', 'such', 'fine', 'voice', 'TLOS', 'tour', 'overdubbing', 'was', 'opinion', 'unnecessary', 'more', 'distraction', 'improvement.Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'observations', 'suggestions', 'dvd', 'not', 'worthwhile', 'though', 'TLOS', 'moving', 'finely', 'crafted', 'work', 'dvd', 'treasure', 'fans', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'dvd', 'highly', 'recommend', 'others', 'well']",Brian Wilson: That Lucky Old Sun

The half hour Nissan Live set and Q&A; is maybe the highlight for me featuring many great performances and some fun Q&A....;this is seriously a few hours of fun fun fun!!!PS...Brian said the favorite song he's written was ""God Only Knows"" and his favorite recording was ""California Girls"".

1206723,A1I47GSUZ7XH0Q,B001JRB1BK,"Wayne Studer ""geowayne""","[2, 2]","Although Brian Wilson's previous live DVDs of ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smile"" in their entireties are marvelous, in some ways ""That Lucky Old Sun"" is the most remarkable of all. It's one thing -- and quite a good thing at that -- for him to re-create some of his greatest music some 35-40 years after it was written with the invaluable assistance of one of the finest backup bands in the history of popular music. But it's quite another for him to produce brand-new music of such unexpectedly superb quality. Not only are the melodies and arrangements first-rate, but toward the end it becomes some of the most emotionally naked music he's ever recorded. The one flaw in ""That Lucky Old Sun"" is that, after a strong start, it drags a bit toward the middle, with ""Mexican Girl"" in particular not living up to the rest of the suite. But that's a minor quibble, especially since the best material of all is in the final third. If you're a Brian Wilson and/or Beach Boys fan, this is essential viewing. And even if you're not, you just might find it a real eye-opener. If you'll excuse the pun, I consider myself one ""lucky old son"" to own this DVD!",5,A wonderful performance,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,1138,"['Brian', 'Wilson', 'previous', 'live', 'DVDs', 'Pet', 'Sounds', 'Smile', 'entireties', 'are', 'marvelous', 'ways', 'Lucky', 'Old', 'Sun', 'most', 'remarkable', 'one', 'thing', 'quite', 'good', 'thing', 're-create', 'greatest', 'music', '35-40', 'years', 'was', 'written', 'invaluable', 'assistance', 'one', 'finest', 'backup', 'bands', 'history', 'popular', 'music', 'quite', 'produce', 'brand-new', 'music', 'such', 'unexpectedly', 'superb', 'quality', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'melodies', 'arrangements', 'first-rate', 'end', 'most', 'emotionally', 'naked', 'music', 'ever', 'recorded', 'one', 'flaw', 'Lucky', 'Old', 'Sun', 'strong', 'start', 'bit', 'middle', 'Mexican', 'Girl', 'particular', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'rest', 'suite', 'minor', 'quibble', 'especially', 'best', 'material', 'final', 'third', ""'re"", 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fan', 'essential', 'viewing', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'real', 'eye-opener', ""'ll"", 'excuse', 'pun', 'consider', 'one', 'lucky', 'old', 'son', 'own', 'DVD']",Brian Wilson: That Lucky Old Sun
