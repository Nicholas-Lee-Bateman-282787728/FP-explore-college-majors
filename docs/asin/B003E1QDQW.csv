1337712,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B003E1QDQW,The Patriarch,"[20, 25]","I bought this movie for my anthropomorphic talking dog, Kibble-Head, because he likes family films about dogs. However, he was really disappointed in this film for several reasons which I will now discuss.First of all, the film's dog protagonist, Marlowe, dies early on in the film, and comes back as a ghost. Kibble-Head hated this because there was only one dog in a movie about cops and they killed him off within the first act. What made matters even worse is that the dog in the movie died by being hit by a car. The same thing happened to Kibble-Head, and ever since watching Cop Dog he now has nightmares about getting hit by the car. Heartwarming? Gimmie a break.Even though my dog didn't like this movie, I still liked it a lot. There's an awkward romance between two children and they have a romantic scene where they chew gum together. I also didn't mind it when the dog died because I don't really like dogs. Just don't tell Kibble-Head.I have to admit though, it doesn't make sense that this movie is called Cop Dog when the dog is a ghost, it should be called Ghost Dog. That's like if Bill Cosby's Ghost Dad movie was about just an ordinary guy who wasn't a ghost. Wait, does that make sense? Anyway, you get my point. I hope.I recommend this to film to juvenile delinquents and dog haters such as myself, but not sensitive dogs, like Kibble-Head.",5,My dog HATED this movie!
