752664,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000096IAJ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[11, 12]","I am constantly impressed with the level of animation that is coming from overseas.  I think it is because they are going places that our native animators are afraid to go.  We still see cartoons for children, where overseas they see it as a form of entertainment for both adults and children.  Why can't they see that it is a form of cinema that will and can take us to places that live-action never will, and give us characters that no actor could ever conjure up?  Who knows?  I hope that one day we get there, but until then I can sit on my comfy couch and watch amazing cinema like that of Read or Die.To begin, this was a fantastic story.  I loved the literary references throughout the course of the film.  I loved that there was so much to see or do in the story that you never really knew where it was going to go next.  This was a very unpredictable story that left so much up to the imagination.  It was futuristic, yet somewhat present day.  There was a feeling that you were seeing on old novel opened for the first time and remastered for today's generation.  It was breathtaking, uncontrollably mesmerizing, and spellbinding to say the least.  I mentioned before about the imagination that this film held, well let me say that it flowed like water from this Read or Die.  It is hard to explain, but if you watch so much live-action cinema, it is hard to comprehend, but there was more alive in this film than I have seen in any of Spielberg's epics.  Keep in mind that I am also relatively new to the Anime genre, and probably am missing some of the better stuff, but for a newbie like myself, Read or Die was perfection in its purest form.In live-action films I always mention the characters, and am normally nervous to mention them in animation (because it is actors voicing not really acting), but I need to applaud the animators in this film.  The way that the characters in this film carried themselves, to their facial expressions, to the intensity that they brought to the screen is equal to that of most live-actors out there.  There was enough back-story and future story for these characters that you knew them, you honestly knew them as if they were real.  This was a character-based film.  While some may argue with me on that topic, it was about friendship, love, and a desire to read and be successful.  These are not emotions that you feel or see with just simple drawings.  The animators went above and beyond their call of duty with this film, and it was demonstrated through cunning visionary and smart characters.With a gripping story that took us all over the world (showed the vast horror that could be found, instead of just making it centralized) and characters that literally jumped out of the screen with heart-pounding animation and style, there is only one more thing to say about this film.  The action.  Growing up in a post-Matrix style film world, it is getting harder and harder to see fight sequences choreographed without the use that made The Matrix so popular.  I continually see more and more films ripping off the ""bullet-time"" effect and making their money back on just that one effect alone.  While I do realize that this was ... yet again ... a cartoon, the action in it seemed more real than in most action films.  Sly and AH-NOLD have nothing on ""The Paper"" as she uses brains and strength to outwit her opponents.  This continued to keep my attention throughout the entire film and nearly pushed me to watch it again.  I know there was something that I probably missed the first time because my jaw was stapled to the floor.  The action sequences were, for lack of a better word, beautiful.  Like a ballet gone wrong, this film stepped into the screen with simplicity, violence, and this subtle delicacy that is unmatched in American cinema today.Overall, this was an impressive film for me.  I loved everything about it from the beginning to the end.  Again, perhaps it has something to do with my amateurish nature around Anime (which is going to change soon), but this is one of the best that I have seen.  It left me satisfied, yet with this strong desire to watch again and again.  Not many films do that to me, so it was great to see something as powerful as this pull me into the Anime world.  I cannot wait for my next adventure!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,The Pen is mightier than the Sword!,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,4321,"['am', 'constantly', 'impressed', 'level', 'animation', 'coming', 'overseas', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'places', 'native', 'animators', 'are', 'afraid', 'go', 'still', 'see', 'cartoons', 'children', 'where', 'overseas', 'see', 'form', 'entertainment', 'adults', 'children', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'form', 'cinema', 'will', 'can', 'take', 'places', 'live-action', 'never', 'will', 'give', 'characters', 'actor', 'could', 'ever', 'conjure', 'up', 'Who', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'get', 'there', 'then', 'can', 'sit', 'comfy', 'couch', 'watch', 'amazing', 'cinema', 'Read', 'Die.To', 'begin', 'was', 'fantastic', 'story', 'loved', 'literary', 'references', 'course', 'film', 'loved', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'see', 'do', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'next', 'was', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'story', 'left', 'so', 'much', 'imagination', 'was', 'futuristic', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'present', 'day', 'was', 'feeling', 'were', 'seeing', 'old', 'novel', 'opened', 'first', 'time', 'remastered', 'today', 'generation', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'uncontrollably', 'mesmerizing', 'spellbinding', 'say', 'least', 'mentioned', 'imagination', 'film', 'held', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'flowed', 'like', 'water', 'Read', 'Die', 'hard', 'explain', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'live-action', 'cinema', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'alive', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Spielberg', 'epics', 'Keep', 'mind', 'am', 'also', 'relatively', 'new', 'Anime', 'genre', 'probably', 'am', 'missing', 'better', 'stuff', 'newbie', 'Read', 'Die', 'was', 'perfection', 'purest', 'form.In', 'live-action', 'films', 'always', 'mention', 'characters', 'am', 'normally', 'nervous', 'mention', 'animation', 'actors', 'voicing', 'not', 'really', 'acting', 'need', 'applaud', 'animators', 'film', 'way', 'characters', 'film', 'carried', 'facial', 'expressions', 'intensity', 'brought', 'screen', 'equal', 'most', 'live-actors', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'enough', 'back-story', 'future', 'story', 'characters', 'knew', 'honestly', 'knew', 'were', 'real', 'was', 'character-based', 'film', 'may', 'argue', 'topic', 'was', 'friendship', 'love', 'desire', 'read', 'be', 'successful', 'are', 'not', 'emotions', 'feel', 'see', 'just', 'simple', 'drawings', 'animators', 'went', 'call', 'duty', 'film', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'cunning', 'visionary', 'smart', 'characters.With', 'gripping', 'story', 'took', 'world', 'showed', 'vast', 'horror', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'instead', 'just', 'making', 'centralized', 'characters', 'literally', 'jumped', 'screen', 'heart-pounding', 'animation', 'style', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'say', 'film', 'action', 'Growing', 'up', 'post-Matrix', 'style', 'film', 'world', 'getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'see', 'fight', 'sequences', 'choreographed', 'use', 'made', 'Matrix', 'popular', 'continually', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'films', 'ripping', 'off', 'bullet-time', 'effect', 'making', 'money', 'back', 'just', 'one', 'effect', 'alone', 'do', 'realize', 'was', 'yet', 'again', 'cartoon', 'action', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'Sly', 'AH-NOLD', 'have', 'nothing', 'Paper', 'brains', 'strength', 'outwit', 'opponents', 'continued', 'keep', 'attention', 'entire', 'film', 'nearly', 'pushed', 'watch', 'again', 'know', 'was', 'something', 'probably', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'jaw', 'was', 'stapled', 'floor', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'beautiful', 'ballet', 'gone', 'wrong', 'film', 'stepped', 'screen', 'simplicity', 'violence', 'subtle', 'delicacy', 'unmatched', 'American', 'cinema', 'today.Overall', 'was', 'impressive', 'film', 'loved', 'everything', 'beginning', 'end', 'Again', 'perhaps', 'something', 'do', 'amateurish', 'nature', 'Anime', 'going', 'change', 'soon', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'left', 'satisfied', 'yet', 'strong', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'something', 'as', 'powerful', 'pull', 'Anime', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'next', 'adventure', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",R.O.D. - Read Or Die
752665,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B000096IAJ,A. Schneider,"[4, 4]","I'm an avid anime enthusiast and I enjoy watching all of the latest anime flicks. Now and then I happened to catch a brief glimpse of the television series Read or Die on a channel called TechTV. Looked like interesting stuff but I never knew where to start... beside, from what little I knew of the plot it sounded strange so I put it on the back burner.What a mistake I made.First off this review is for Read or Die the movie (not the series as I haven't seen the series yet but surely the movie makes me want to). This is one of those really well made anime movies that obviously a lot of research was put into as well as a lot of time designing it so beautifully (visually that is - the animation is stunning to say the least). Not only is it beautiful but it's funny in an adorable kind of way, serious enough where you won't feel like a fool watching it if you're accustomed to more ""serious"" anime movies, and just downright creative as hell!It's a real treasure to get an anime as creative as this one. James Bond music, meets X-Men-like characters, meets downright creative/great story with adorable laugh-out-loud moments! From the way mechanical things work in the movie to just the character-power designs... amazing the way it's handled in the movie.I know how silly it sounds to someone reading the movie's description without having actually seen it but the storyline and characters featured in the movie just work so damn well with the movie's plot and aesthetics. I can go at great length detailing what was so great about the movie but in reality it was a perfect blend of everything! There were heartfelt moments, happy moments, cool action sequences, some sexy characters for fun and well... just about anything else you can ask for.Some comments on here people left regarded the characters as ""flat"" or ""shallow"" in some way - that simply isn't true, as for the story it's designed well enough that it'll keep you on your feet and wanting more.Really an amazing movie, it might just get you interested in seeing the series as well!",5,"Wow, pleasantly suprised!!!",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,2052,"[""'m"", 'avid', 'anime', 'enthusiast', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'latest', 'anime', 'flicks', 'Now', 'then', 'happened', 'catch', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'television', 'series', 'Read', 'Die', 'channel', 'called', 'TechTV', 'Looked', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'never', 'knew', 'where', 'start', 'beside', 'what', 'little', 'knew', 'plot', 'sounded', 'strange', 'so', 'put', 'back', 'mistake', 'made.First', 'review', 'Read', 'Die', 'movie', 'not', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'yet', 'surely', 'movie', 'want', 'one', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'anime', 'movies', 'obviously', 'lot', 'research', 'was', 'put', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'time', 'designing', 'so', 'beautifully', 'visually', 'animation', 'stunning', 'say', 'least', 'Not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'adorable', 'kind', 'way', 'serious', 'enough', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fool', 'watching', ""'re"", 'accustomed', 'more', 'serious', 'anime', 'movies', 'just', 'downright', 'creative', 'hell', 'real', 'treasure', 'get', 'anime', 'as', 'creative', 'one', 'James', 'Bond', 'music', 'X-Men-like', 'characters', 'meets', 'downright', 'creative/great', 'story', 'adorable', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'way', 'mechanical', 'things', 'work', 'movie', 'just', 'character-power', 'designs', 'amazing', 'way', 'handled', 'movie.I', 'know', 'how', 'silly', 'someone', 'reading', 'movie', 'description', 'having', 'actually', 'seen', 'storyline', 'characters', 'featured', 'movie', 'just', 'work', 'so', 'damn', 'well', 'movie', 'plot', 'aesthetics', 'can', 'go', 'great', 'length', 'detailing', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'movie', 'reality', 'was', 'perfect', 'blend', 'everything', 'were', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'happy', 'moments', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'sexy', 'characters', 'fun', 'well', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'ask', 'for.Some', 'comments', 'here', 'people', 'left', 'regarded', 'characters', 'flat', 'shallow', 'way', 'simply', ""n't"", 'true', 'story', 'designed', 'well', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'feet', 'wanting', 'more.Really', 'amazing', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'interested', 'seeing', 'series', 'well']",R.O.D. - Read Or Die
752666,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B000096IAJ,A. Trotter,"[8, 18]","The animation was excellent. The attention to character detail was brilliant. There were subtle touches of humor, there was sly and finely drawn character development, there was... almost no story. It's a brilliantly made, carefully crafted pile of nothing. It's hollow. Not that that's what dropped my rating; I've forgiven pretty, empty stories before on the basis of their charm.This won't be a popular complaint, I'm afraid. I think the U.S. president was drawn with malice (and mockery) aforethought, which is the artist's right - but it's also mine not to like it, and I don't. My reaction - annoyance, disgust at the writers - snapped me out of the story, broke my absorbtion in watching. I don't like that. It smacks of clumsyness in telling the story, which is really irritating when the potential exhibited by the rest of movie was so high. And I wasn't expecting it, so I brooded on it and continued to be irked and really, it spoiled my enjoyment. If you're going to mock, I'd really prefer something either subtler or more in keeping with the feel and flow of the story. In this case their capitulating to the temptation towards mockery struck a jarring note and ruined the movie for me.Maybe you won't care, or maybe having warning that that's in there will keep it from being a surprise that spoils it. It's still a nicely done movie - I liked the main charcter a lot, I liked how they portraied her, I liked the interactions and the characters. I was not impressed with the plot or the sillyness of their super-secret organizations.

752668,APU6AXJGSS96S,B000096IAJ,"Ben Carpenter ""darthsparkyx""","[14, 16]","The plot was pretty twisted but I liked it anyway.  Yomiko Readman, a.k.a. ""The Paper"" is a special agent who is working for the British Library, helping them to put an end to a gang of villaneous clones of made-up famous people from history bent on destroying humanity and stealing its rarest books.  Yomiko is nuts about books and reading and her superpower is that she can manipulate paper into just about anything she wants it to be.  She can cause it to become as hard as metal or she can bunch it all together to form objects ect.  She even carries a briefcase around thats full of paper(unsuspected ammo).  She teams up with another couple of special agents, including the lovely Ms. Deep whose superpower is that she can pass through solid objects.  Together they take on the evil clones. So yes, the story may seem weird but it works and thats whats important.  It was a highly enjoyable superspy romp around the world with superheroes taking out supervillians with some of the craziest diabolicol schemes ever devised.The music in the series was awesome!  Music in an anime is very important to me, it has the ability to draw one into the story and the mood of the show.  ROD's music does just that.  Its got a kinda upbeat spy/thriller thing going.Animation was amazing!  Extremely detailed characters and environments, beautiful colors, backdrops and clean lines.  The characters were all great, either very suave, sophisticated, mysterious, or dangerous.Parental Guidence:  There is no nudity, only Ms. Deep cleavage.  Language if I remember correctly was mild.  Violence is moderate.  For the most part it wasn't very graphic, the worst scenes that come to mind are a bad guy getting shot in the side of the head with some sharp object.  This was shown from the front so it wasn't graphic.  Then there was a suicide scene that showed people cutting themselves and blood running all over.  Both instances happened very quickly though.  Also Ms. Deep sometimes kills by ""phasing"" through people.  I'd recommend for 13+My only gripe with the show was that it was only 3 episodes long!  If you watch the show not knowing what its about, you may become a bit confused as I was as you are thrown straight into the meat of the story without even knowing that the characters are supposed to have superpowers.  I started out watching the show thinking Yomiko was just an ordinary book-lovin citizen and was pretty darned confused when she turned around and started fighting with paper and then I couldn't at first figure out her connection to the British Library or that she was an agent all along.  But if you read this review, you'll have a better understanding of the show before it shoots you right into the plot.  I say all this cus I almost quit watching when all these things started happening - just glad I didn't :)On a happy note, I read in Newtype that theyre coming out with a new ROD tv series in Japan and they may be keeping Yomiko in it!

752670,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B000096IAJ,Brian Camp,"[85, 87]","R.O.D. (READ OR DIE) is quite an imaginative and delightful three-episode Japanese OAV (Original Animated Video) series that deftly mixes sci-fi, adventure, comedy, history and a love of rare books. Made in 2000, it's set against a marvelously detailed background of urban settings like Tokyo, Washington DC, and New York, along with the massive Victorian-style (but secretly high-tech) British Library headquarters, as well as a diverse fleet of retro-style aircraft and seacraft. Overall, it offers the kind of fresh, unpredictable and literate entertainment that caters to the restless tastes of the more discriminating anime fans in America.The heroine is a 20-something woman named Yomiko Readman, a shy, self-effacing bookworm who is a teacher and obsessive collector of rare books. She traipses about in a long skirt and overcoat, lugging a large briefcase behind her on a wheeled cart everywhere she goes, even when chasing super-villains. She's also a secret agent known as ""The Paper"" who has the extraordinary power of turning any kind of paper product into a lethal weapon or protective barrier. One of the special thrills of this series is the way this talent is used so often to ingenious effect in the course of the three episodes. When the Library of Congress is attacked and robbed by a famous Japanese inventor cloned back to life, Yomiko is assigned by the British Library to retrieve the stolen books. The enemy is soon revealed to be much wider in scope and encompasses a host of other historical figures brought back to life, including a certain famed composer. World domination is not their aim but something much more sinister.The plot is rather complex, but never wavers off track as the action moves from Tokyo to D.C. to New York (including a harrowing scene at a pre-9/11 World Trade Center) in the first episode alone, venturing to India in the second, and to a massive techno-fortress which rises out of the central Pacific Ocean in the third.

It's also a neat anime featuring a nerdy, bespectacled heroine, one who simply loves books, to the point of distraction, to the point where sometimes she forgets about her missions. Yomiko Readman may have just gotten hired as a substitute teacher, but her real gig is working for the British Library Special Engineer Force, the British Empire's preeminent intelligence service. Yomiko doesn't look like much. But her codename is the Paper, which has absolutely everything to do with her uncanny affinity for paper, for her ability to manipulate its shape and function. In her hands, a sheet of paper can stop a bullet cold or become a deadly weapon. Under Yomiko's influence, paper, reams of it, can transform itself into a functional human-sized glider. But, really, she'd rather read books.A mysterious samurai figure's assault on the White House and the U.S. Library of Congress and the resulting theft of 600 invaluable manuscripts incurs a plea for help to the British Library Special Engineer Force. As such, the Paper is assigned to deal with things, along with fellow agents Miss Deep (who can phase thru solid objects) and Drake Anderson (a no-nonsense, non-powered grunt). Yomiko may not be the most reliable or unflappable of agents to handle this kind of operation, and she can't seem to stop shrieking with glee every time she espies a book she likes, but her talents very quickly prove indispensible as the agents go up against colorful, freakishly powered types (including ones who ride grasshoppers and part seas). It all seems to center on a highly coveted book titled ""Immortal Beloved,"" of which contents surely spell the extinction of mankind. I never was that big a fan of Beethoven.Give this a chance, if you dig imaginative aerial combats and spiffy papercraft pitted against a formidable, fire-breathing monk, and if you aren't yet sick and tired of clones. These clones, by the way, are of historical and literary figures, but, honestly, I recognized only one of them. Still, it's encouraging that you really do pick up tidbits of knowledge everywhere. READ OR DIE is a wild ride, but without much of a set-up to anything, so just sit back and let this sweeping adventure carry you away. This OVA consists of three episodes and offers crisp animation, with plenty of fantastic visuals and terrific action sequences, and even a moving relationship between the sorta naive Yomiko and the hard-bitten Nancy (Miss Deep). And at three episodes, it moves at a blistering pace, with a barely coherent plot. As a result, character development does suffer; there are simply too many characters to really delve into, given the limited screen time. But you do come to care enough that when the bittersweet ending comes, you do feel it. It certainly makes me want to check out R.O.D. the TV series, which follows this one in continuity.",5,Man!

Read or Die is a fantastic superhero adventure, mixing elements of spy movies with comic book superhero powers.  Extremely clever as it is campy, this tour de force takes us to a world where literature matters a little too much and the most useful of weapons are sheets of paper.Our heroine is Miss Yomiko Readman, a mousey young substitute teacher and book ethusiast.  After purchasing a rare book, Yomiko suddenly finds herself at odds against terrorists who are stealing prized books from around the world.  The storyline seems to have evolved from some B-class spy movie, where villians take on the form of deranged historic figures.  Yomiko proves to be quite an adversary, using elaborate fighting techniques by controlling scraps of paper.  In one scene, she transforms book pages into a hanglider/airplane for an aerial strike while in another scene, dollar bills are transformed into a sword.  The visuals are just as intriguing as they are hilarious.Armed with a rolling cart full of blank notebook pages, Yomiko joins other super heros as part of ""Operation Manuscript Retrieval"", fighting of a color cast of villians like an insect-riding entomologist, a mob-boss monk and evil Beethoven.  The entire play of history, literature and classic comic book/anime action is brilliant and well put together.  In typical sci-fi/adventure style, the movie climaxes with the world on the edge of destruction, leaving the heroine with the most unlikely powers to stop it.  With such a great mix of action and humor, its obvious that the production team had just as much fun making the film as I did watching it.I would recommend Read or Die to any Anime fan and history buff.

The power seh has to control paper is easier for her when she is touching it. However she does not need to be touching it to create something (such as the paper airplane she forgot to put the tail on.)And the last one people seem to be askng.  Is Yomiko a bumbling bookworm, or a ninja warrior?  the short answer is a warrior bookworm.  her personality is bookwormish but when she is on the job she can become one tough babe.  however she doesn't lose her bookworm personality.I hope this helps clear up some of the air about this show.spoiler warning so read only if you are confussed about the ending:The Nancy in the hospital was the clone.  she lost het memory after losing to the real Nancy in the fight.",5,An original story in a sea of sameness.,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,1442,"['OVA', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'animes', 'time', 'story', 'really', 'original', 'when', 'down', 'efven', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'need', 'go', 'whole', 'story', 'considering', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'do.some', 'things', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'story', 'story', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'very', 'future', 'reason', 'older', 'looking', 'clothes', 'steam', 'powered', 'equipment', 'people', 'whom', 'super', 'clones', 'are', 'created', 'come', 'certain', 'era', 'wo', ""n't"", 'modernize', 'have', 'perfected', 'tools', 'time', 'need', 'modernize.The', 'next', 'thing', 'come', 'up', 'Yomiko', 'powers', 'power', 'seh', 'control', 'paper', 'easier', 'when', 'touching', 'However', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'touching', 'create', 'something', 'such', 'paper', 'airplane', 'forgot', 'put', 'tail', 'last', 'one', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'askng', 'Yomiko', 'bumbling', 'bookworm', 'ninja', 'warrior', 'short', 'answer', 'warrior', 'bookworm', 'personality', 'bookwormish', 'when', 'job', 'can', 'become', 'one', 'tough', 'babe', 'however', ""n't"", 'lose', 'bookworm', 'personality.I', 'hope', 'helps', 'clear', 'air', 'show.spoiler', 'warning', 'so', 'read', 'only', 'are', 'confussed', 'ending', 'Nancy', 'hospital', 'was', 'clone', 'lost', 'het', 'memory', 'losing', 'real', 'Nancy', 'fight']",R.O.D. - Read Or Die
752683,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000096IAJ,P. Hardy,"[2, 3]","Having watched ROD THE TV first I was curious to know what the Read or Die ova was like, because I knew so little about Yomiko Readman and the girl called Nancy. Truth of the matter is that Read or Die is not as great a movie or three part episode OVA as everyone has been saying it was. For one fact the plot and story lines were easy to predict and not so impressive or gripping, the characters (mostly Readman) were not as interesting as they were on THE TV series. Yomiko is a very wimpish type character who is a little too naive to be considered a paper-master of great-skill. She always thinking of her books and not the mission until one of her friend's double cross her, but even then is she too wimpy a character to take seriously. Read or Die is also missing the dynamics that makes ROD THE TV so interesting in both character and storyline (which is not so easy to figure out when first watching it). Another downfall is that your hardly see Yomiko manipulate paper and when she does its more-or less five or three times. And that's when you see her fighting against the villains of a corporation called I-JIN who's origin or purpose aside from the totally obvious one is never fully explained in the tree-part episodes. There is also unnecessary profanity, over embellished death-scenes, and silly dialogue, but there enough ample action despite its choppy-sloppy ness to keep me entertained.The plot is simplistic: Yomiko Readman --- a pack-rat and rabid book lover--- who works for the British Government in order to retrieve books or rarity and great value for a man named Mr. Gentleman. For some particular reason she along with a man named Drake, and a woman supposedly called Nancy are placed into a mission that has them searching for a rare book of Beethoven's while fending off Clone's of people of history (or that past), none of which I've heard of.The trio fend them off for a while until they reach India where Mr. Joker (Readman's secondary boss) was supposed to have a contact for them but are ambushed by more clones (who basically too very stupid things like, puling of Moses' splitting the ocean apart and fly on a Cloud coupled with a power-pole like Goku in DBZ) and the book is ultimately taken from them due to a mishap performed by Yomiko. Mr. Joker and the British Government soon find out that their third operative, Nancy is a spy sent by I-JIN but are powerless to stop her because Yomiko steps in Drakes way helping Nancy's escape.The two (Readman and Drake) are then sent into the I-JIN HQ to stop a missile of a 'suicide symphony' that will ultimately kill the entire human race, thus creating a paradise for the clones (Who hasn't done this). Yomiko continues to believe that Nancy is simply acting out a part and finds out she was right when she discovers a clone that took the place of her friend who is killed right in front of her eyes.The story from there is the simple 'stop the bad-guys before its too late' premise. And at the end when Yomiko goes to visit her friend, Nancy we find out that its not Nancy but her ""sister"" who she ends up visiting. One last Major problem in this story line is that they never explain to you the name of Nancy's evil lover bent on destroying the world or who he is or why he's doing it. So the story is left with gaping holes in the plot, character, and story development.The English voice actors in the English Dub are totally different from the one Geneon used for Yomiko, Mr. Joker, Drake, Nancy's little sister, and Wendy, which is what probably took me out of the experience of watching it with pleasure. But not even that could save this movie from the enormous plot holes and mistakes made.

752685,A3P3WYB24WLIVH,B000096IAJ,R. Rydberg,"[14, 55]","This OAV was an anime I really looked forward to viewing.  Unfortunately, the promising premise was undercut by flaws too sizable and numerous to overlook.The story focuses mostly on two characters, Yomiko and Nancy.  They`re the only `good guys` who have extraordinary powers, and the nature of these powers is very similar to those displayed by Marvel`s X-men.  First off, we have the main character, Yomiko Readman, aka The Paper.  She can manipulate paper to effects ranging from mundane to deadly (think Magneto`s ability with magnetism).  The combination of the element involved, paper (which is hardly your usual super-hero material), and Yomiko's nebbish, librarian, yet compelling demeanor make for a winning character rather than the feel of a rip-off that might have easily occurred.  Then there`s Nancy Makuhari, aka Miss Deep, who can phase through any and all matter with moves that rival Nadia Comaneci (think Shadowcat, aka Kitty Pride, with Nightcrawler`s gymnastic ability).The first incongruity we come across regarding agent Yomiko is her level of experience with, and working for, British intelligence.  When she first meets Miss Deep, she introduces herself using her real name.  Deep admonishes her for this rookie mistake.  But Yomiko isn`t supposed to be a rookie.  Her familiarity with the upper brass is evident.  She`s a known quantity in British Intelligence and is being tapped for a very important assignment that has implications for international diplomacy as well as military and security objectives.Secondly, the extent of her ability to manipulate paper appears inconsistent.  The show can`t make up its mind if she can control paper that`s simply nearby, or if she has to be in contact with the paper, along with any sheets touching the first.  In one life-and-death situation, she is bound, and cannot manipulate the paper ribbon in her braided hair until she can grasp it with her teeth.  Yet in another scene, she can control pieces of paper floating around her without making contact with them, either directly or via other paper.  The first case itself seems rather odd; since the paper ribbon is in her hair, she is technically already touching it (even though it was tied by Miss Deep).  Perhaps once she has touched a piece of paper, she can manipulate it ever after by proximity (at one point we do see her flipping through a stack of currency). But that still wouldn`t explain the former case above. Even if this is true, why reach for, grab, and then throw paper that she's obviously already touched from a briefcase, instead of just commanding it to fly on it`s own? I`m sure there`s some rational explanation for these apparent variances, but one can't escape the feeling that her ability is dictated by whatever the director needs at the moment to create the desired dramatic effect.Third, is Yomiko a bumbling bookworm, or a ninja warrior?  For the most part, Yomiko behaves as someone more likely than most to trip over or bang into something out of clumsiness, or inattentiveness.  Yet she holds her own in battles with master samurai.  If she doesn`t understand the basics (never give your real name in an operation), how did she manage to hone her martial arts skills to such a degree?There are some problems in directing as well.  In one shot involving the Statue of Liberty, everything happens in normal speed?except for Yomiko, who is suspended in mid-air, coat flapping, seemingly going slow motion, left-to-right in a straight line.  There`s nothing to keep her from falling, which she eventually does in the next shot.  I`m surprised this got passed the editing process.The show also has the rather annoying habit of shuttling you from place to place without any indication of travel, or identification of the new location.  With a little thought, one can suss out soon enough what has happened, but time has to be spent wondering exactly where you are now? Japan, Britain, or Washington?One other thing that bothers me. The story seems reluctant to define the era in which it takes place. There are steam powered contraptions from the 1800s, clothes from the 1920s, conveyance systems from the 40s, manual typewriters from the 50s, James Bond style music from the 70s, computer monitors and satellite imagery from the 90s, genetic replication technology that hasn?t been invented yet, just to name a few.  Half way through the first episode, I found myself wishing that they would choose a time period and stick with it.Yet even given all this, it`s definitely not a complete waste of time.  As others have pointed out, the story is engaging enough, the characters interact in an interesting manner, and the artwork is very pleasant. Yomiko`s character has a child-like sincerity that`s devoid of cynicism, coupled with a hard-core tenacity to accomplish her mission.  It`s a difficult combination that comes off in spades and saves the show.  We quickly come to really like and care about Yomiko.Even though Read or Die has been somewhat overhyped, it is still worth a look.  I would recommend seeing it before buying.  This anime had the potential to be an immediate buy-off-the-shelf keeper, but the gaps and incontinuites lessened what should have been an excellent show.",2,X-Men meet the Dewey Decimal

First off, this is obviously a high-budget production: these three episodes (which is the complete Read or Die direct-to-video series) sport character designs which are attractive, animation which is top-notch, and great sound and music.  Moreover, Manga, the studio releasing Read or Die in the US did a wonderful authoring job on the DVD, in contrast to some of their releases (e.g., Macross II).  On the technical side, Read or Die simply screams quality.Fortunately, that quality is matched by the quirky, likeable characters and the quirkier plot.  The heroine, Yomiko Readman, is a book-obsessed woman with the power to manipulate paper  (which is far more interesting than it may sound).  She is also a secret agent for the British Library.  When cloned historical figures try to steal her newest book purchase and destroy the world, she is assigned to stop them.  Yomiko is the most interesting heroine of the last several years of anime releases: she is a woman, not a girl; she is not overly sexualized; she is capable and strong without pride or arrogance.The only real flaw in Read or Die is that, because it's only 3 episodes long, the weird little plot is somewhat opaque.

I taped it many years ago off of Adult Swim and it's just the same as I remember! Action packed, &#34;The Paper&#34; is back! It's about a bookworm named Yomiko Readman that works for the British Library trying to obtain rare books. The bad guys are trying to steal one book in particular with sheet music written all over it. The song is the &#34;Death Symphony&#34; and after being heard, causes it's listener to commit suicide.
