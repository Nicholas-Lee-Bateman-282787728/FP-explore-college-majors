Picking up a while after the first season concluded, season two begins with the Caffee family picking up the pieces.  Michael (Jason Isaacs) is recovering from the brutal beating he took at last season's finale, and coping with the unexpected mental side effects to boot, all the while still trying to stay in the semi-good graces of crime boss Freddie Cork (Kevin Chapman).  His politician brother Tommy (Jason Clarke) continues the campaign trail, and is drawn further and further away from his wife Eileen (Annabeth Gish) after learning of her infidelities.  Things get even more complicated for the Caffee's when their estranged Irish cousin Colin (Brian F. O'Byrne) returns to The Hill to reconnect with the family, much to the chagrin of Michael and Tommy's mother Rose (the excellent Fionnula Flanagan).  Also in this season, we witness the descent of cop Declan (Ethan Embry) whose life continues to spiral out of control.  While there isn't anything on Brotherhood that hasn't been seen before, it still manages to provide plenty of entertainment for fans of gangster crime-dramas and back-office politics.

I wish they held it back till the soprano's ended it would've have many more viewers. Also than didn't advertise it well but Showtime has learned from it's mistakes they ran commercials for shameless before the new season on basic cable. Getting back to brotherhood one of the best written shows & great acting as well! The whole cast but the 2 brothers u would never guess one is English & the other from Australia.

1114098,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000XCZGXG,Wesley Mullins,"[28, 32]","The first season of Showtime's dark, brooding Brotherhood spent time exploring its main characters, often at the expense of plot.  So much of what most people loved about the first season involved the family dynamics, the personal struggle and angst and the fine line between love and hate.  Just seeing the characters in their unique positions in life sufficed for a larger story.The second season really couldn't repeat that.  Viewers now know these characters and expected more concrete plots to accompany the character studies.  Several long plots appear throughout the season, even though at times, the series feels misguided and directionless.  The primary stories focus on Michael's physical, mental and emotional recovery from his beating at the end of Season, Tommy's tit-for-tat affair and the arrival of the Caffee's cousin Colin, a blue collar Irishman bent on reconnecting with his American family, including the father he never knew.That last plot comes with a heavy price for most fans of the first season.  To make room for Colin, the writers eliminated Michael's right hand Pete, a viewer favorite.  Colin takes his place alongside Michael, performing his dirty work.  Although a deeper more flexible character, Colin lacks the warmth and humanity of Pete, and the show suffers because of the trade.Another change from Season 1 is the downward spiral of Declan.  Along with his non-existent relationship with his wife, Declan's drug abuse worsens, and he finds himself in a moral neverland at work, having to betray the trust of his friends to keep his shield.  Declan's duplicity is never better displayed than in the season's best episode, when he bribes voters to help re-elect Tommy, all with the approval of his supervisors who want the Caffee's blood.Even though Brotherhood takes a step back in its second season, it's still among the best television has to offer.  Sharply written, wonderfully acted and as serious and somber as a funeral, the often graphically violent drama both entertains and challenges viewers with a family so unlike any other family in the world, yet also so similar to us all.",5,A Step Back But Still Among TV's Best,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2125,"['first', 'season', 'Showtime', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Brotherhood', 'spent', 'time', 'exploring', 'main', 'characters', 'often', 'expense', 'plot', 'So', 'much', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'involved', 'family', 'dynamics', 'personal', 'struggle', 'angst', 'fine', 'line', 'love', 'hate', 'Just', 'seeing', 'characters', 'unique', 'positions', 'life', 'sufficed', 'larger', 'story.The', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'Viewers', 'now', 'know', 'characters', 'expected', 'more', 'concrete', 'plots', 'accompany', 'character', 'studies', 'Several', 'long', 'plots', 'appear', 'season', 'even', 'times', 'series', 'feels', 'misguided', 'directionless', 'primary', 'stories', 'focus', 'Michael', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'recovery', 'beating', 'end', 'Season', 'Tommy', 'tit-for-tat', 'affair', 'arrival', 'Caffee', 'cousin', 'Colin', 'blue', 'collar', 'Irishman', 'bent', 'reconnecting', 'American', 'family', 'including', 'father', 'never', 'knew.That', 'last', 'plot', 'heavy', 'price', 'most', 'fans', 'first', 'season', 'make', 'room', 'Colin', 'writers', 'eliminated', 'Michael', 'right', 'hand', 'Pete', 'viewer', 'favorite', 'Colin', 'place', 'Michael', 'performing', 'dirty', 'work', 'deeper', 'more', 'flexible', 'character', 'Colin', 'warmth', 'humanity', 'Pete', 'show', 'trade.Another', 'change', 'Season', '1', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Declan', 'non-existent', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Declan', 'drug', 'abuse', 'worsens', 'moral', 'neverland', 'work', 'having', 'betray', 'trust', 'friends', 'keep', 'shield', 'Declan', 'duplicity', 'never', 'better', 'displayed', 'season', 'best', 'episode', 'when', 'voters', 'help', 're-elect', 'Tommy', 'approval', 'supervisors', 'who', 'want', 'Caffee', 'blood.Even', 'Brotherhood', 'step', 'back', 'second', 'season', 'still', 'best', 'television', 'offer', 'Sharply', 'written', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'serious', 'somber', 'funeral', 'often', 'graphically', 'violent', 'drama', 'entertains', 'viewers', 'family', 'so', 'other', 'family', 'world', 'yet', 'also', 'so', 'similar']",Brotherhood: Season 2
