The movie is sweet, and gentle, and fun, and innocent... and thoroughly enjoyable.  Those who say that the translation from the original is badly handled are completely off base.

I love animation, I still love kids' entertainment in general, and I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan, but I think I had some fuzzy, distant memory that I didn't really care for the Curious George books (and maybe I had seen a couple of the early films when I was in high school) and I was vaguely aware of a negative buzz about this film.  Well, putting it off was a mistake, because this is now easily one of my favorite films from 2006--everything about it is perfect, and I have to doubt my memory about previous Curious George works (I've already ordered one of the old books and films to check out).The first thing you notice is how gorgeous and unusual the animation is.  It's highly stylized to create a complete fantasy world, and seamlessly combines high-tech and low-tech, cartoonish caricature and realistic computer-aided design.The plot, which is about Ted (Ferrell) venturing from a fantasy New York City to Africa to try to find a huge statue that would save the natural history museum he works for, may seem to be the weakest link, but that would come from misunderstanding the focus, which is instead on a number of abstract ideas and themes.The primary idea is relatively unusual but very welcome--a message about the extreme importance of curiosity, creativity and play.  This is merged with a very positive Zen-like ""go with the flow""/""live mindfully in the moment"" theme, which is partially achieved via a stream-of-consciousness flow of various subplots that frequently, very enjoyably dip into silliness and absurdities.The main plot turns out to fit perfectly with this tone, as do the choices and performances of the voice actors, including Ferrell, Frank Welker, Eugene Levy, Dick Van Dyke, Drew Barrymore and David Cross.  The Jack Johnson songs also set an unexpected but perfect mood for the film.",5,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't this masterpiece",1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,1909,"['had', 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'Curious', 'George', 'while', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'love', 'animation', 'still', 'love', 'kids', 'entertainment', 'general', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'think', 'had', 'fuzzy', 'distant', 'memory', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Curious', 'George', 'books', 'maybe', 'had', 'seen', 'couple', 'early', 'films', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'negative', 'buzz', 'film', 'Well', 'putting', 'off', 'was', 'mistake', 'now', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2006', 'everything', 'perfect', 'have', 'doubt', 'memory', 'previous', 'Curious', 'George', ""'ve"", 'already', 'ordered', 'one', 'old', 'books', 'films', 'check', 'out', '.The', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'how', 'gorgeous', 'unusual', 'animation', 'highly', 'stylized', 'create', 'complete', 'fantasy', 'world', 'seamlessly', 'combines', 'high-tech', 'low-tech', 'cartoonish', 'caricature', 'realistic', 'computer-aided', 'design.The', 'plot', 'Ted', 'Ferrell', 'venturing', 'fantasy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Africa', 'try', 'find', 'huge', 'statue', 'would', 'save', 'natural', 'history', 'museum', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'weakest', 'link', 'would', 'come', 'misunderstanding', 'focus', 'instead', 'number', 'abstract', 'ideas', 'themes.The', 'primary', 'idea', 'relatively', 'unusual', 'very', 'welcome', 'message', 'extreme', 'importance', 'curiosity', 'creativity', 'play', 'merged', 'very', 'positive', 'Zen-like', 'go', 'flow', '/', 'live', 'mindfully', 'moment', 'theme', 'partially', 'achieved', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'flow', 'various', 'subplots', 'frequently', 'very', 'enjoyably', 'dip', 'silliness', 'absurdities.The', 'main', 'plot', 'out', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'do', 'choices', 'performances', 'voice', 'actors', 'including', 'Ferrell', 'Frank', 'Welker', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'David', 'Cross', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'songs', 'also', 'set', 'unexpected', 'perfect', 'mood', 'film']",N/A

I've enjoyed Jeff Bennett's performance as the Man with the Yellow Hat on TV, but I doubted Ferrell could pull it off.Boy, was I wrong!  Will Ferrell did a very good job with the voice, and George was cute enough that I found him irresistible.  Although I missed Gnocchi, the cat from the TV series, it was refreshing to see some different characters (like baby jungle animals and Clovis's robotic creations).  The scenario by which Ted became the Man with the Yellow Hat differed from the scenario presented by the TV series, and I noticed that the characters in Ted's building differed between the two as well.Basically, the movie was very sweet, and George was endearing.  The premise that Ted had to go claim a giant artifact was a little Indiana Jones for me--he didn't seem to have any problem with just taking another culture's artifacts from a faraway land.  But there's no way Ted was malicious, so you have to just assume that he didn't think better of it.Even the ""bad guy"" of this film is only motivated by the desire to attain his father's love; there's nobody really evil in the story.

I, for one, thought that it was pretty good. It is very colorful, kid-friendly, and just fun to look at it.One of the more noticeable changes was that from the original book by H.A. Rey consisting of George being TAKEN from Africa and into the zoo. In this film, the man in the yellow hat, named Ted, is in Africa on some sort of expedition and George is following him around everywhere, including Ted's home, after meeting him in the jungle.Unfortunately, there's just one little thing that interferes with its ability to get a solid five-star rating. There is a scene in the film showing one of the characters deliberately spilling coffee onto a projector. Of course, having been a projector owner since one month before this film's release, I just couldn't help but cringe at this particular scene. Needless to say, a projector is a very expensive piece of equipment, and though I don't get to use mine quite as often as I'd like, I am very fond of it and can only hope that this film doesn't give anyone any ideas for persons like myself who might be owning such a machine as well.",4,"would have been a five, except for that projector thing",1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,1420,"['avid', 'reader', 'children', 'books', 'much', 'younger', 'age', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'CG', 'flicks', 'just', 'had', 'go', 'public', 'cinema', 'catch', 'was', 'just', 'eight', 'days', 'nationwide', 'release.My', 'mother', 'took', 'see', 'film', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'plans', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'release', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'colorful', 'kid-friendly', 'just', 'fun', 'look', 'it.One', 'more', 'noticeable', 'changes', 'was', 'original', 'book', 'H.A', 'Rey', 'consisting', 'George', 'being', 'TAKEN', 'Africa', 'zoo', 'film', 'man', 'yellow', 'hat', 'named', 'Ted', 'Africa', 'sort', 'expedition', 'George', 'following', 'around', 'everywhere', 'including', 'Ted', 'home', 'meeting', 'jungle.Unfortunately', 'just', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'ability', 'get', 'solid', 'five-star', 'rating', 'scene', 'film', 'showing', 'one', 'characters', 'deliberately', 'spilling', 'coffee', 'projector', 'course', 'having', 'been', 'projector', 'owner', 'one', 'month', 'film', 'release', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'cringe', 'particular', 'scene', 'Needless', 'say', 'projector', 'very', 'expensive', 'piece', 'equipment', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'use', 'mine', 'quite', 'as', 'often', ""'d"", 'like', 'am', 'very', 'fond', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'anyone', 'ideas', 'persons', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'owning', 'such', 'machine', 'as', 'well']",N/A

But we have lived in Tokyo for many years now and I think he missed out because George gets burried under all the violent kids characters here.When I heard they weremaking this movie I wanted to see it, to my happy surprise my son did too.  My only fear was that they would do a piss poor job and I would be left wishing George's memory was untarnished for my son.  I am sure many of you know how that feels.  You feel like they ripped off your memories to make a buck because Hollywood hasn't had an original idea since Kennedy died. (before my time)This show did NOT disappoint, it was worth twice what I paid, easily, and I only wish it was a series so I could keep sharing these stories with my sone before he is too old to enjoy them...
