831695,A1IUEB3ENN9NK,B0002EB68E,"Donald D. Coney, Jr.","[8, 10]","As a film unto itself, this adaptation stands as a well made movie. The production values compare quite favorably with western mystery films (not being much a Russian film buff this was a concern of mine before getting the DVD). Taken as a film this is a well made, well acted and 'good looking' effort. I didn't even mind the subtitles (which usually drive me to distraction). The one 'compliant' I would offer is that the subtitle translations are a little stiff (for lack of a better term). The language is very stilted and often humorous, but they are done well enough that you get the gist of what the actors are saying --- especially if you have read the original book or seen any of the earlier versions of the story.Regarding the inevitable comparisons to the earlier adaptations of Christie's story ( I have only seen the 10 Little Indians from the 60's and And Then There Were None from the 40's), this version is much closer to the original story. This is a much darker adaptation then these earlier efforts and hence not as 'fun' to watch. This film demands more work from the viewer than those earlier, lighter versions. Where those earlier films provided some comic relief (in the person of the bumbling, drunken butler in And Then There Were None and the ham handed sexual relationship in 10 Little Indians) this film has none of that. This is a serious mystery with serious portrayals.One caveat I might offer (especially in this age of political correctness) is that the statues in this versions are of black children. I mention this only because some may find offense in this aspect of the film.Other than this I would highly recommend this film to any serious mystery buff or follower of Dame Christie's work.",4,More faithful to book than earlier/english versions,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1728,"['film', 'adaptation', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'compare', 'quite', 'favorably', 'western', 'mystery', 'films', 'not', 'being', 'much', 'Russian', 'film', 'buff', 'was', 'concern', 'mine', 'getting', 'DVD', 'Taken', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', ""'good"", 'looking', 'effort', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'subtitles', 'usually', 'drive', 'distraction', 'one', ""'compliant"", 'would', 'offer', 'subtitle', 'translations', 'are', 'little', 'stiff', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'language', 'very', 'stilted', 'often', 'humorous', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'get', 'gist', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'saying', 'especially', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'seen', 'earlier', 'versions', 'story.Regarding', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'earlier', 'adaptations', 'Christie', 'story', 'have', 'only', 'seen', '10', 'Little', 'Indians', '60', 'Then', 'Were', 'None', '40', 'version', 'much', 'closer', 'original', 'story', 'much', 'darker', 'adaptation', 'then', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'hence', 'not', ""'fun"", 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'work', 'viewer', 'earlier', 'lighter', 'versions', 'Where', 'earlier', 'films', 'provided', 'comic', 'relief', 'person', 'bumbling', 'drunken', 'butler', 'Then', 'Were', 'None', 'ham', 'handed', 'sexual', 'relationship', '10', 'Little', 'Indians', 'film', 'none', 'serious', 'mystery', 'serious', 'portrayals.One', 'caveat', 'might', 'offer', 'especially', 'age', 'political', 'correctness', 'statues', 'versions', 'are', 'black', 'children', 'mention', 'only', 'may', 'find', 'offense', 'aspect', 'film.Other', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'serious', 'mystery', 'buff', 'follower', 'Dame', 'Christie', 'work']",N/A
831696,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0002EB68E,Galina,"[12, 12]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***This disturbing, slow but riveting movie is one of the most impressive, darkest, and truthful adaptations of Agatha Christie's mysteries. It is not only the mystery but also a very convincing journey into the minds and souls of ten characters, the victims who found themselves trapped on the isolated rock of an island. One of them took upon him/herself to become the jury and the executioner for these ten who never met before but who have in common one dark secret - all of them might have committed a murder in the past.I saw this film first time on the big screen in the theater in Moscow back in 1987 when it was released. It is very dark, violent, and atmospheric. The film follows Christie's novel (not the play) truthfully including the pessimistic ending, original politically incorrect title, and set design. The film was shot at the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea and the breathtaking ominous view of the mansion sitting on the large cliff is a shot of the famous castle Swallow's Nest. Another Crimea's landmark that was used in a movie is the Vorontov Estate in Alupka. The front facade is built in the 16Th -- 17Th-century Neo-Gothic or Tudor style by the request of its first owner, Russian general M.S. Vorontsov who was brought up in England and loved English style in architecture. The links to the images are provided on the film's board.Film director Stanislav Govoruchin had invited very talented and popular actors for the parts. Just one example. Philip Lombard was played by Aleksandr Kajdanovsky - a friend of Sergei Parajanov and Andrei Tarkovsky who is well known to the movies fans as Mr. Stalker himself from Tarkovsky's film of the same title. The rest of cast played their parts well with Vladimir Zeldin as Old Justice Wargrave, Mikhail Gluzsky as General Macarthur, and strikingly beautiful Tatyana Drubich as Vera Claythorne especially memorable.I recommend the film to all fans and admirers of Agatha Christie, the Queen of mysteries. ""Desyat Negrityat"" is not the only Russian screen adaptation of a Christie's novel. I also remember and recommend ""Tayna chyornykh drozdov"" (1983) ... aka ""Secret of the Blackbirds"" which is based on the Miss Jane Marple's novel ""A Pocketful of Rye"".4.5/5",4,"One of the most impressive, darkest, and truthful adaptations of Agatha Christie's mysteries",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2269,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***This', 'disturbing', 'slow', 'riveting', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'darkest', 'truthful', 'adaptations', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mysteries', 'not', 'only', 'mystery', 'also', 'very', 'convincing', 'journey', 'minds', 'souls', 'ten', 'characters', 'victims', 'who', 'found', 'trapped', 'isolated', 'rock', 'island', 'One', 'took', 'upon', 'become', 'jury', 'executioner', 'ten', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'who', 'have', 'common', 'one', 'dark', 'secret', 'might', 'have', 'committed', 'murder', 'past.I', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'theater', 'Moscow', 'back', '1987', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'very', 'dark', 'violent', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'Christie', 'novel', 'not', 'play', 'truthfully', 'including', 'pessimistic', 'ending', 'original', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'title', 'set', 'design', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Crimea', 'peninsula', 'Black', 'Sea', 'breathtaking', 'ominous', 'view', 'mansion', 'sitting', 'large', 'cliff', 'shot', 'famous', 'castle', 'Swallow', 'Nest', 'Crimea', 'landmark', 'was', 'used', 'movie', 'Vorontov', 'Estate', 'Alupka', 'front', 'facade', 'built', '16Th', '17Th-century', 'Neo-Gothic', 'Tudor', 'style', 'request', 'first', 'owner', 'Russian', 'general', 'M.S', 'Vorontsov', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'England', 'loved', 'English', 'style', 'architecture', 'links', 'images', 'are', 'provided', 'film', 'board.Film', 'director', 'Stanislav', 'Govoruchin', 'had', 'invited', 'very', 'talented', 'popular', 'actors', 'parts', 'Just', 'one', 'example', 'Philip', 'Lombard', 'was', 'played', 'Aleksandr', 'Kajdanovsky', 'friend', 'Sergei', 'Parajanov', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'movies', 'fans', 'Mr.', 'Stalker', 'Tarkovsky', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'rest', 'cast', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'Vladimir', 'Zeldin', 'Old', 'Justice', 'Wargrave', 'Mikhail', 'Gluzsky', 'General', 'Macarthur', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'Tatyana', 'Drubich', 'Vera', 'Claythorne', 'especially', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'admirers', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Queen', 'mysteries', 'Desyat', 'Negrityat', 'not', 'only', 'Russian', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Christie', 'novel', 'also', 'remember', 'recommend', 'Tayna', 'chyornykh', 'drozdov', '1983', 'Secret', 'Blackbirds', 'based', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'novel', 'Pocketful', 'Rye', '.4.5/5']",N/A

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[9, 10]","This 1987 Russian masterpiece may well be the very best Agatha Christie adaptation film to date.While there is no English ""voice-over,"" the English subtitles can be clearly read. The translations are brief, sometimes omitting articles (such as the word ""the"") but I did not find this to be at all distracting. The film runs 137 minutes, NOT 156 minutes as listed in the product information.The movie is shot in color (with beautiful color saturation) and the aspect ratio is 16:9 (full screen) for those who are interested in such technical information. The locations are spectacular with incredible scenery supplemented by some of the best sets I've seen anywhere.Here's the story: Ten people get enticed to a small, remote island for a period of free, high-class recreation. The reality is that these folks have all ""committed murder"" in one sense or another but their crimes either went undiscovered or, they were not looked upon as actual murders, ergo, the dashing young playboy who ""accidentally"" ran down two children and got his driver's license revoked, but no more punishment than that.The murderer in this case plans to effect some vigilante justice, covertly killing off his/her victims one at a time, generating ever more terror for the remaining island guests as s/he does so. The killing methods follow the respective descriptions found in the poem ""Ten Little Indians"" which is prominently posted in each of the guests' (victims') rooms.The island guests represent a cross section of humanity, a judge, an ex-policeman, a governess, an old spinster, a playboy, etc. And the murderer clearly does face one big problem: How does he or she escape from the island once the pick-up boat arrives to take everyone back to the mainland? Well, this is achieved very shrewdly, and I'll stop there to avoid a spoiler.It will be of special interest to Christie fans to note that this is one of her few mysteries which does NOT feature a central, shrewd detective, either professional or amateur.This mystery really has it all including a brilliant setting (the remote Indian Island), a good story, a nice big storm that traps everyone on the island until the murders are concluded, stoic British servants (who are also victims!) and, an ending that few would ever guess, albeit the clues are there to empower the shrewd viewer to solve the crime.The actors, to a person, are superb -- they each accurately represent their characters as they appeared in the original Christie work. They also pull off their roles quite convincingly. The director of this film took both his job and the mystery seriously and there is nothing hokey about this movie. The ambiance of this flick is strictly film-noir which we do not see enough of these days. As you may have already observed, most Christie mystery films embrace an element (sometimes, a lot!) of pure goofiness on varying levels.All the details of this artful work convey the true brilliance of this fine film -- the producers didn't mess with the story and they focused 100% on telling the tale rather than limelighting some witless pseudo-star as the Hollywood people would have done (and HAVE done in their previous vain attempts to produce this film coherently -- they even used Fabian in one adaptation and he was truly awful). Here are the other two (earlier) inferior versions:And Then There Were NoneTen Little Indians (aka And Then There Were None)I do feel compelled to alert prospective purchasers of this DVD to the fact that the Russian version carries Christie's original and unfortunate English title on the reverse side of the DVD packaging: ""Ten Little Niggers"". Some people might not want this lying about their house.Other than that singular incongruent caveat, I have nothing but good things to say about this well-done movie and I congratulate the Russians for being the first to pull it off brilliantly.So, there you have it!",5,"A brilliant adaptation, subtitled in English",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,3897,"['1987', 'Russian', 'masterpiece', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'very', 'best', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'adaptation', 'film', 'date.While', 'English', 'voice-over', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'clearly', 'read', 'translations', 'are', 'brief', 'sometimes', 'omitting', 'articles', 'such', 'word', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'distracting', 'film', '137', 'minutes', 'NOT', '156', 'minutes', 'listed', 'product', 'information.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'color', 'beautiful', 'color', 'saturation', 'aspect', 'ratio', '16:9', 'full', 'screen', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'such', 'technical', 'information', 'locations', 'are', 'spectacular', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'supplemented', 'best', 'sets', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'Ten', 'people', 'get', 'enticed', 'small', 'remote', 'island', 'period', 'free', 'high-class', 'recreation', 'reality', 'folks', 'have', 'committed', 'murder', 'one', 'sense', 'crimes', 'went', 'undiscovered', 'were', 'not', 'looked', 'actual', 'murders', 'ergo', 'dashing', 'young', 'playboy', 'who', 'accidentally', 'ran', 'down', 'two', 'children', 'got', 'driver', 'license', 'revoked', 'more', 'punishment', 'that.The', 'murderer', 'case', 'effect', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'covertly', 'killing', 'off', 'his/her', 'victims', 'one', 'time', 'generating', 'ever', 'more', 'terror', 'remaining', 'island', 'guests', 's/he', 'so', 'killing', 'methods', 'follow', 'respective', 'descriptions', 'found', 'poem', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'prominently', 'posted', 'guests', 'victims', 'rooms.The', 'island', 'guests', 'represent', 'cross', 'section', 'humanity', 'judge', 'ex-policeman', 'governess', 'old', 'spinster', 'playboy', 'etc', 'murderer', 'clearly', 'face', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'How', 'escape', 'island', 'once', 'pick-up', 'boat', 'take', 'everyone', 'back', 'mainland', 'Well', 'achieved', 'very', 'shrewdly', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there', 'avoid', 'spoiler.It', 'will', 'be', 'special', 'interest', 'Christie', 'fans', 'note', 'one', 'few', 'mysteries', 'NOT', 'feature', 'central', 'shrewd', 'detective', 'professional', 'amateur.This', 'mystery', 'really', 'including', 'brilliant', 'setting', 'remote', 'Indian', 'Island', 'good', 'story', 'nice', 'big', 'storm', 'everyone', 'island', 'murders', 'are', 'concluded', 'stoic', 'British', 'servants', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'victims', 'ending', 'few', 'would', 'ever', 'guess', 'clues', 'are', 'there', 'empower', 'shrewd', 'viewer', 'solve', 'crime.The', 'actors', 'person', 'are', 'superb', 'accurately', 'represent', 'characters', 'appeared', 'original', 'Christie', 'work', 'also', 'pull', 'off', 'roles', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'director', 'film', 'took', 'job', 'mystery', 'seriously', 'nothing', 'hokey', 'movie', 'ambiance', 'flick', 'strictly', 'film-noir', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'enough', 'days', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'observed', 'most', 'Christie', 'mystery', 'films', 'embrace', 'element', 'sometimes', 'lot', 'pure', 'goofiness', 'varying', 'details', 'artful', 'work', 'convey', 'true', 'brilliance', 'fine', 'film', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'mess', 'story', 'focused', '100', '%', 'telling', 'tale', 'rather', 'limelighting', 'witless', 'pseudo-star', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'HAVE', 'done', 'previous', 'vain', 'attempts', 'produce', 'film', 'coherently', 'even', 'used', 'Fabian', 'one', 'adaptation', 'was', 'truly', 'awful', 'Here', 'are', 'other', 'two', 'earlier', 'inferior', 'versions', 'Then', 'Were', 'NoneTen', 'Little', 'Indians', 'aka', 'Then', 'Were', 'None', 'do', 'feel', 'compelled', 'alert', 'prospective', 'purchasers', 'DVD', 'fact', 'Russian', 'version', 'Christie', 'original', 'unfortunate', 'English', 'title', 'reverse', 'side', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Niggers', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'lying', 'house.Other', 'singular', 'incongruent', 'caveat', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'well-done', 'movie', 'congratulate', 'Russians', 'being', 'first', 'pull', 'off', 'brilliantly.So', 'have']",N/A

831702,A1RVBEAD8RKDT8,B0002EB68E,SpirituallySpeaking,"[2, 3]","It's astounding to me that of Agatha Christie's 85 novels, her most classic and one of her top three greatest works, has been adapted to film no less than five times...and NONE of them use the original ending.  Even Christie herself adapted the work for the stage and changed her own ending because she was afraid it needed a ""happier"" end for theater audiences.  Since when does a murder mystery thriller need a ""happy ending""?  Isn't ""happy ending murder mystery"" an oxymoron?In any case...I was thrilled to discover this 1987 Russian film.  True to the description, with slight changes, is does indeed retain Christie's terrifically dark ending to a very dark tale.  That's why I'm giving it four stars.  Some would argue that even that slight change in ending of this film alters Christie's intent greatly, as the book ends in the ""perfect crime""...meaning, every single person on the island appears to have been murdered by a killer that seems to have vanished into thin air.  That would never be inferred by this film.  You'll see what I mean.The cast is well-chosen and they perform well.  Even so, one of my biggest complaints was the utter lack of surprise or terror in the characters' actions or demeanor each time a new murder victim is discovered.  It's like it's ""no big deal"" to find another dead body, realizing you're one corpse closer to your own death.  It seemed, at times, that attitude was very much a part of the Russian stoic personality.  Still, it comes off as cold and completely unrealistic under the circumstances of the story...ESPECIALLY during the climactic scene on the island's edge between the final two characters.Because the characters don't seem to get increasingly terrified as the bodies pile up...neither does the viewer.  The entire genius of the story depends on the build up of tension and terror as the bodies drop and the rest of the living suspects find themselves in an ever-increasingly claustrophobic environment with the killer.  It's this constant, slow, turning up of the heat that leaves the final character to make the decision he/she does because of complete exhaustion, guilt and resignation during what should be a complete and utter nervous breakdown.  I didn't get that feeling from this production, which makes justification of that act difficult without having read the book.The location of Indian Island is great.  The house, although too small, still works well and is perched on a cliff, literally hanging off the edge of the island, giving the feeling that everyone's fate is balancing on the edge of disaster.  FAR too much of the film is shot in bright, sunny weather.  Christie's story has a VERY Gothic feel to it, even though it takes place in the 1930's.  The scenes should have been filmed in cold, overcast, windy, rainy weather.  So much more should have been done with lighting and mood that just wasn't given any attention.  Indian Island is just a naked rock with little to no vegetation on it, giving the killer nowhere to hide.  It's a great suspense device, but the cinematographer should have used the weather to create suspense, atmosphere and almost an 11th character.Because it preserved the ending, I gave the film four stars.  Otherwise, it's closer to three stars.  I didn't find the English subtitles that were sometimes stilted, a problem.  If you haven't read the book, they might seem a bit clunky.  The film doesn't give any real setups for the characters as they journey to the island.  That would make it tough for someone who hasn't read the book to keep them all straight.  All in all...I'm very glad at least ONE film has preserved Christie's fantastic, original ending to this amazing story, since it's publication almost 100 years ago.  I still feel that a true, Hollywood adaptation with the original ending would not only do justice to such a fine book, but be a blockbuster, as well.",4,"Uneven, but the best and truest ending, yet...",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,3885,"['astounding', 'Agatha', 'Christie', '85', 'novels', 'most', 'classic', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'greatest', 'works', 'been', 'adapted', 'film', 'no', 'less', 'five', 'times', 'NONE', 'use', 'original', 'ending', 'Even', 'Christie', 'adapted', 'work', 'stage', 'changed', 'own', 'ending', 'was', 'afraid', 'needed', 'happier', 'end', 'theater', 'audiences', 'when', 'murder', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'need', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'happy', 'ending', 'murder', 'mystery', 'oxymoron', 'case', 'was', 'thrilled', 'discover', '1987', 'Russian', 'film', 'True', 'description', 'slight', 'changes', 'indeed', 'retain', 'Christie', 'terrifically', 'dark', 'ending', 'very', 'dark', 'tale', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'would', 'argue', 'even', 'slight', 'change', 'ending', 'film', 'Christie', 'intent', 'greatly', 'book', 'perfect', 'crime', 'meaning', 'single', 'person', 'island', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'killer', 'have', 'vanished', 'thin', 'air', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'inferred', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.The', 'cast', 'well-chosen', 'perform', 'well', 'Even', 'so', 'one', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'was', 'utter', 'lack', 'surprise', 'terror', 'characters', 'actions', 'demeanor', 'time', 'new', 'murder', 'victim', 'discovered', 'big', 'deal', 'find', 'dead', 'body', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'one', 'corpse', 'closer', 'own', 'death', 'seemed', 'times', 'attitude', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'Russian', 'stoic', 'personality', 'Still', 'off', 'cold', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'circumstances', 'story', 'ESPECIALLY', 'climactic', 'scene', 'island', 'edge', 'final', 'two', 'characters.Because', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'increasingly', 'terrified', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'neither', 'viewer', 'entire', 'genius', 'story', 'build', 'tension', 'terror', 'bodies', 'drop', 'rest', 'living', 'find', 'ever-increasingly', 'claustrophobic', 'environment', 'killer', 'constant', 'slow', 'turning', 'up', 'heat', 'final', 'character', 'make', 'decision', 'he/she', 'complete', 'exhaustion', 'guilt', 'resignation', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'complete', 'utter', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'production', 'justification', 'act', 'difficult', 'having', 'read', 'book.The', 'location', 'Indian', 'Island', 'great', 'house', 'too', 'small', 'still', 'well', 'perched', 'cliff', 'literally', 'hanging', 'off', 'edge', 'island', 'giving', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'fate', 'balancing', 'edge', 'disaster', 'FAR', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'shot', 'bright', 'sunny', 'weather', 'Christie', 'story', 'VERY', 'Gothic', 'feel', 'even', 'place', '1930', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'cold', 'overcast', 'windy', 'rainy', 'weather', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'lighting', 'mood', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'attention', 'Indian', 'Island', 'just', 'naked', 'rock', 'little', 'vegetation', 'giving', 'killer', 'nowhere', 'hide', 'great', 'suspense', 'device', 'cinematographer', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'weather', 'create', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'almost', '11th', 'character.Because', 'preserved', 'ending', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'Otherwise', 'closer', 'three', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'English', 'subtitles', 'were', 'sometimes', 'stilted', 'problem', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'clunky', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'real', 'setups', 'characters', 'journey', 'island', 'would', 'make', 'tough', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'keep', 'straight', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'least', 'ONE', 'film', 'preserved', 'Christie', 'fantastic', 'original', 'ending', 'amazing', 'story', 'publication', 'almost', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'feel', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'adaptation', 'original', 'ending', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'justice', 'fine', 'book', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'as', 'well']",N/A
