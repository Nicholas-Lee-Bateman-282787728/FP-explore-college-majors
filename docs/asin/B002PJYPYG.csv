Maria Bello does a wonderful job portraying such a miserable, broken character.  One cannot ignore her intense pain and anguish.

The relationship that occurs between Nancy and Louis is incredibly spooky and creepy, but still feels real.This is such a bleak movie that I wish I has spent the time watching something else.

1282993,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B002PJYPYG,Blue Leaf,"[0, 1]","This film is based on a true-life story about a psychologically damaged woman who only finds relief by hurting herself. WARNING: This movie deals with extremely serious material that is not for every viewer.  It is incredibly raw and painful to watch but at the same time completely believable with some of the best acting I have seen in a long time.Nancy, (Mario Bello), plays a woman whose mental illness has gone on for so long it can not simply be fixed by prescription drugs or even therapy once a week. She needs so much more help than anyone can give her.  The only person who seems to understand her is her Internet lover played by Jason Patric.Her husband, (Rufus Sewell), is tired of her desperate antics for attention and is incredibly insensitive to her emotional needs. I think this film vilifies him a bit too much and that would be the only problem I had with the film. She was sick way before she met him but he confirms her beliefs of self-disgust and ignores her pain and she has become much worse because of his negative affirmations and by acting as if she is not worthy of his time or love.I will leave the rest of the story for you to uncover. I will just continue by saying I think these kind of films, which are so hauntingly authentic are not produced enough, especially in this country. These actors and everyone involved in this film was really courageous. Maria Bello's performance was incredible. It must have been extremely draining to play the role of Nancy. I can understand why people would not be able to watch this film but I think as human beings we have to realize that true existence is not what we see on ""reality t.v."" at night but true reality is often times a person's life crumbling away before them without a life raft to hold on to.Once again this film is definitely for adults only.  The subject matter is for mature audiences only.

1282995,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002PJYPYG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 4]","This has to be one of the most depressing, gut wrenching films I've seen in a long time. The only thing that rescues this film from the garbage heap is the method the director used to tell this story; essentially three timeline threads that weave back and forth. The film fades to black at the end.There is absolutely nothing happy about this film, no jokes, and no humor. This is a study of some form of insanity, a woman who has absolutely no self esteem, and hates her life. The bright spot in the story is as a cautionary tale to anyone that was abused as a child. I hate to reveal much of the plot, the method the director used to uncover the story is critical to enjoying this film. The film is the classic love triangle turned on its head, maybe with a bit of Romeo and Juliette thrown in for good measure.The intriguing part of this film, the director runs three timeline threads at once. He uses subtle clues to place the particular sequence in the past, present, or future. The time span of the film is not much more than four or five days. Some films require a lot of work and careful viewing to understand complex timeline manipulation; not Downloading Nancy, the director telegraphs the time very clearly and never uses the dreaded date or time titles.The film is one hour and forty two minutes long. Like being stopped on the highway due to a traffic wreck, this film is very hard to avert your eyes. The acting is quite good. Maria Bello (ER) is beautiful and believably crazy as Nancy; Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy) is a somewhat clueless psychiatrist and gorgeous; Rufus Sewell (a fine British actor, but not British at all in this film) is the clueless husband that is much more into his golf than anything else; and Jason Patric (In the Valley of Elah) is the on line love interest, a bit too handsome, and a bit too well spoken. This is a low budget film, there are no special effects. All the painful bits are shown off camera and the effects are shown with makeup; no need for stunt doubles. There were only a few shooting locations. The film relied on the power of the story and the dialog to move it forward.This film is not rated, but is really meant for mature audiences. Cutting is a recurring theme, shown a few times on camera, and pretty graphically made up aftermath. There is frontal female nudity. But most importantly, the film deals with a mature subject. A woman and a man are shown masturbating, albeit with their private parts covered up. This film is not for younger viewers.The DVD includes previews to other Strand Releasing films. The only other bonus material is the original theatrical trailer.Like a car accident this film was hard to stop watching. It left me feeling not very happy, and emotionally drained. Sometimes that can be a good thing, and others it is painful. In this case it was a little of both. The director did a very creative thing with the timeline. From a pure cinema viewpoint, this is an interesting film. The audience for this film must be small.I realized that my original review included a potential spoiler and that might have upset a few people. Although I don't think this spoils the film in the least bit, in some ways knowing this last bit enhances the film, some may not wish to know this part. So if you don't want to know about the end of the film, STOP READING.  The film fades to black and we learn that it is based on actual events. The sad life Nancy lived is based on a real woman's life.",3,Depressing Film,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,3468,"['be', 'one', 'most', 'depressing', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'garbage', 'heap', 'method', 'director', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'essentially', 'three', 'timeline', 'threads', 'weave', 'back', 'forth', 'film', 'black', 'end.There', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'happy', 'film', 'jokes', 'humor', 'study', 'form', 'insanity', 'woman', 'who', 'absolutely', 'self', 'esteem', 'life', 'bright', 'spot', 'story', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'anyone', 'was', 'abused', 'child', 'hate', 'reveal', 'much', 'plot', 'method', 'director', 'used', 'uncover', 'story', 'critical', 'enjoying', 'film', 'film', 'classic', 'love', 'triangle', 'turned', 'head', 'maybe', 'bit', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.The', 'intriguing', 'part', 'film', 'director', 'three', 'timeline', 'threads', 'once', 'subtle', 'clues', 'place', 'particular', 'sequence', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'time', 'span', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'four', 'five', 'days', 'films', 'require', 'lot', 'work', 'careful', 'viewing', 'understand', 'complex', 'timeline', 'manipulation', 'not', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', 'director', 'telegraphs', 'time', 'very', 'clearly', 'never', 'dreaded', 'date', 'time', 'titles.The', 'film', 'one', 'hour', 'forty', 'two', 'minutes', 'long', 'being', 'stopped', 'highway', 'due', 'traffic', 'wreck', 'film', 'very', 'hard', 'avert', 'eyes', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'ER', 'beautiful', 'believably', 'crazy', 'Nancy', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'Judging', 'Amy', 'somewhat', 'clueless', 'psychiatrist', 'gorgeous', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'fine', 'British', 'actor', 'not', 'British', 'film', 'clueless', 'husband', 'much', 'more', 'golf', 'anything', 'else', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Valley', 'Elah', 'line', 'love', 'interest', 'bit', 'too', 'handsome', 'bit', 'too', 'well', 'spoken', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'painful', 'bits', 'are', 'shown', 'off', 'camera', 'effects', 'are', 'shown', 'makeup', 'need', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'shooting', 'locations', 'film', 'relied', 'power', 'story', 'dialog', 'move', 'forward.This', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'really', 'meant', 'mature', 'audiences', 'Cutting', 'recurring', 'theme', 'shown', 'few', 'times', 'camera', 'pretty', 'graphically', 'made', 'up', 'aftermath', 'frontal', 'female', 'nudity', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'deals', 'mature', 'subject', 'woman', 'man', 'are', 'shown', 'masturbating', 'private', 'parts', 'covered', 'up', 'film', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers.The', 'DVD', 'previews', 'other', 'Strand', 'Releasing', 'films', 'only', 'other', 'bonus', 'material', 'original', 'theatrical', 'car', 'accident', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'stop', 'watching', 'left', 'feeling', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'others', 'painful', 'case', 'was', 'little', 'director', 'did', 'very', 'creative', 'thing', 'timeline', 'pure', 'cinema', 'viewpoint', 'interesting', 'film', 'audience', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'small.I', 'realized', 'original', 'review', 'included', 'potential', 'spoiler', 'might', 'have', 'upset', 'few', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'least', 'bit', 'ways', 'knowing', 'last', 'bit', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'wish', 'know', 'part', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'end', 'film', 'STOP', 'READING', 'film', 'black', 'learn', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'sad', 'life', 'Nancy', 'lived', 'based', 'real', 'woman', 'life']",N/A

1282997,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B002PJYPYG,Douglas King,"[19, 19]","""Downloading Nancy"" is the best film I've seen in a while. What is so impressive about it is its ability to make the characters in an almost unbelievable story so believable.Nancy wants to die. After suffering horrific childhood abuse, and being stuck in a loveless marriage for 15 years, she can only really feel alive when she's in physical pain. To cope, she cuts herself, but her fantasy is to find a sexual sadist willing to take her life for her. Enter Louis, who she meets on the internet, and who is willing to serve as her sexual dominant and eventual murderer.Louis is the yan to Nancy's yin. He deals with psychic pain by inflicting physical pain. His demeanor is calm and controlled, as opposed to Nancy's histrionics. They're soul mates. They understand each other. And ultimately, when Louis acts, it's out of love.What makes the film is really Maria Bello's powerhouse performance. Nancy is not an easy character to like - she's a person who's so determined to die that she's lost any desire to maintain any kind of dignity. She can be harsh, abusive, cruel ... and yet the actress makes her pain so real that it's hard to fault her for anything she does. She is somehow able to make this disturbed, ruined woman both relatable and even lovable.",5,Soulmates,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,1260,"['Downloading', 'Nancy', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'What', 'so', 'impressive', 'ability', 'make', 'characters', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'so', 'believable.Nancy', 'die', 'suffering', 'horrific', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'being', 'stuck', 'loveless', 'marriage', '15', 'years', 'can', 'only', 'really', 'feel', 'alive', 'when', 'physical', 'pain', 'cope', 'fantasy', 'find', 'sexual', 'sadist', 'willing', 'take', 'life', 'Enter', 'Louis', 'who', 'internet', 'who', 'willing', 'serve', 'sexual', 'dominant', 'eventual', 'murderer.Louis', 'yan', 'Nancy', 'yin', 'psychic', 'pain', 'inflicting', 'physical', 'pain', 'demeanor', 'calm', 'controlled', 'opposed', 'Nancy', 'histrionics', ""'re"", 'soul', 'mates', 'understand', 'other', 'ultimately', 'when', 'Louis', 'film', 'really', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Nancy', 'not', 'easy', 'character', 'like', 'person', 'who', 'so', 'determined', 'die', 'lost', 'desire', 'maintain', 'kind', 'dignity', 'can', 'be', 'harsh', 'abusive', 'cruel', 'yet', 'actress', 'pain', 'so', 'real', 'hard', 'fault', 'anything', 'somehow', 'able', 'make', 'disturbed', 'ruined', 'woman', 'relatable', 'even', 'lovable']",N/A

The ending is basically revealed early on so the rest of the film is just leading up to what you know is going to happen.  In that sense there was lots of filler as you pretty much understand the main characters and their motivations (and shortcomings) already, there is not much revealed you don't already know.I suppose you are supposed to feel bad for the Bello character but at some point her anguish is so over the top and relentless you are just wishing she would quit screwing around and off herself already. She is actually a selfish person in my mind because her method of accomplishing her objective ends up condemning the only person in the film that felt any real affection for her.I suppose you can't employ logical thinking when judging the actions of the mentally ill, but you get the feeling that she is deliberately putting herself in a no-win situation. She had options to improve her lot in life that she ignores or rules out for no real reason.  Odder still is those options are given short shrift by the other characters as well.

1283003,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B002PJYPYG,Peter Baklava,"[2, 6]","I recommend this movie only for the performance of Maria Bello, who is truly a remarkable young actress.  Like Toni Collette, she's got great acting chops and a remarkable physical presence, but she is probably underappreciated simply because she is not classically beautiful.This movie reminded me a bit of ""Hard Candy"" (with Ellen Page)as an exploration of an explosive and little examined area of sexuality. In this case, it's a young woman who engages in self-mutilation, AKA ""cutting"".  Like ""Hard Candy""-- which dealt with sexual predation-- ""Downloading Nancy"" has a claustrophobic feel, with most of the action taking place indoors in dull locations, and a small cast of only 4 or 5 characters interacting intensely.""Downloading Nancy"" doesn't immediately tip its hand as to whether it will treat sado-masochism either erotically or honestly, but thankfully this is not a film for voyeurs. It gives you plenty to think about.In the end I think it suffers from a lack of style.  There isn't really much here that is visually interesting.  Bello's performance far outshines that of Rufus Sewell or Jason Patric, who come off rather flatly.  Bello's exchanges with Amy Brenneman are good, but not central to the plot.I'd call this movie a brave attempt, in regards to the territory it explores.  But as a movie about a young woman with a death wish, it is much less watchable than that old chestnut, ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"", with an electrifying performance from then-newcomer Diane Keaton.",3,Looking for Mister de Sade,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,1497,"['recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'performance', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'who', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'young', 'actress', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'got', 'great', 'acting', 'chops', 'remarkable', 'physical', 'presence', 'probably', 'underappreciated', 'simply', 'not', 'classically', 'beautiful.This', 'movie', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'exploration', 'explosive', 'little', 'examined', 'area', 'sexuality', 'case', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'self-mutilation', 'AKA', 'cutting', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'dealt', 'sexual', 'predation', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'most', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'indoors', 'dull', 'locations', 'small', 'cast', 'only', '4', '5', 'characters', 'interacting', 'intensely', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'tip', 'hand', 'will', 'treat', 'sado-masochism', 'erotically', 'honestly', 'thankfully', 'not', 'film', 'voyeurs', 'plenty', 'think', 'end', 'think', 'lack', 'style', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'here', 'visually', 'interesting', 'Bello', 'performance', 'far', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'who', 'come', 'rather', 'flatly', 'Bello', 'exchanges', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'central', 'plot.I', ""'d"", 'call', 'movie', 'brave', 'attempt', 'regards', 'territory', 'movie', 'young', 'woman', 'death', 'wish', 'much', 'less', 'watchable', 'old', 'chestnut', 'Looking', 'Mr.', 'Goodbar', 'electrifying', 'performance', 'then-newcomer', 'Diane', 'Keaton']",N/A

A woman committed suicide by hiring a man over the internet to torture and strangle her.  Like this film's main character, Nancy Stockwell, the real-life woman, Sharon Lopatka, was unhappy with her life and wanted to ""feel something"".  I'm not sure that ever comes across 100% in this film.  Sure, Maria Bello, playing Nancy Stockwell, did her best to show us that, but this film strived more than anything else to be creepy.  Jason Patric, playing Louis Farley, the man who agreed to kill Stockwell, certainly accomplished that as I got chills just from him still being in the movie about halfway through.  But, given the grim story being told here, that just isn't enough.  Also, Stockwell's husband, Albert Stockwell, played by Rufus Sewell, just seemed lost in a generic way.  Yes, he was upset over what happened to his wife, but it was a performance we've seen a hundred times before in movies featuring the loss of a loved one.  Ultimately, I gave this film a high rating simply because of the effort put into tackling such a grim plot.  Maybe someone else will see something I missed, because chilling as it already is, this film could have been more.

1283006,A1HK1LRON0UJ5X,B002PJYPYG,William McNeill,"[4, 4]","Downloading Nancy takes place in a cold, dark world. Literally. It always appears to be about nine-thirty at night, even when the characters are shopping for a dress. Outside, the streets are covered in snow and run past bus stations, parking lots, and fast food places. Nothing decayed: just aggressively unglamorous. The colors are all watery blues and grays. Even the chunky computer monitors from a few years back are oppressive. One of them sits on the desk of protagonist Maria Bello's ineffective psychiatrist along with a bunch of ring binders, which as depressing bric-a-brac goes is maybe a bit much. When Bello storms out of a restaurant in a fit of depressive rage she appears to walk directly into a junkyard. At one point, she lies to her husband about going to visit friends in Baltimore, which sounded way too far south to me. Maybe instead of being merely metaphorically hellish, Downloading Nancy is actually a film about the afterlife, and before it begins Bello's character has already died and gone to Buffalo.It may seem odd to focus so much on the way this movie looks, but Downloading Nancy is more effective as a mood piece than either a character study or a thriller, and its look is the most effective medium for conveying its sense of unvarying dreariness. One-note art direction can draw strength from its consistency, but plot and characterization need more variation, something Downloading Nancy bravely foregoes. It uses tricky chronology to build some suspense, but can only manage so much. Early on you see where the story is going, and then it goes there. The performances are better. Particularly from Bello, who swings wildly from rage to self-pity to clear-eyed hopelessness. She is sympathetic but never likable. As her husband, Rufus Sewell is also intriguing. In another movie you'd wonder how the female lead ended up with a fish-faced tool who tunes out her emotions, no matter how volcanic, so that he can retreat to his basement rec room and play video golf, but he seems weirdly damaged too, so their pairing makes sense. Oddly enough, the performance that seems off is Jason Patric as Nancy's internet-paramour-cum-torturer. Patric is usually the go-to guy for hunky menace, but here he's burdened with offering the movie's only moments of actual kindness which fatally undercuts his scariness. He is a psycho with a heart of gold. In theory this is intriguing, but in practice it's just murky. But then murk is what this movie is all about. Downloading Nancy is static and emotionally numb. Maybe that's appropriate for a film about clinical depression, but I'm not sure it was on purpose.",3,Well That Was Bleak,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,2637,"['Downloading', 'Nancy', 'place', 'cold', 'dark', 'world', 'Literally', 'always', 'be', 'nine-thirty', 'night', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'shopping', 'dress', 'Outside', 'streets', 'are', 'covered', 'snow', 'run', 'past', 'bus', 'stations', 'parking', 'lots', 'fast', 'food', 'places', 'Nothing', 'decayed', 'just', 'aggressively', 'unglamorous', 'colors', 'are', 'watery', 'blues', 'grays', 'Even', 'chunky', 'computer', 'monitors', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'are', 'oppressive', 'One', 'sits', 'desk', 'protagonist', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'ineffective', 'psychiatrist', 'bunch', 'ring', 'binders', 'depressing', 'bric-a-brac', 'maybe', 'bit', 'much', 'When', 'Bello', 'restaurant', 'fit', 'depressive', 'rage', 'walk', 'directly', 'junkyard', 'one', 'point', 'husband', 'going', 'visit', 'friends', 'Baltimore', 'sounded', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'south', 'Maybe', 'instead', 'being', 'merely', 'metaphorically', 'hellish', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', 'actually', 'film', 'afterlife', 'Bello', 'character', 'already', 'died', 'gone', 'Buffalo.It', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'way', 'movie', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', 'more', 'effective', 'mood', 'piece', 'character', 'study', 'thriller', 'look', 'most', 'effective', 'medium', 'conveying', 'sense', 'unvarying', 'dreariness', 'One-note', 'art', 'direction', 'can', 'draw', 'strength', 'consistency', 'plot', 'characterization', 'need', 'more', 'variation', 'something', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', 'bravely', 'tricky', 'chronology', 'build', 'suspense', 'can', 'only', 'manage', 'so', 'much', 'Early', 'see', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'then', 'there', 'performances', 'are', 'better', 'Particularly', 'Bello', 'who', 'swings', 'wildly', 'rage', 'self-pity', 'clear-eyed', 'hopelessness', 'sympathetic', 'never', 'likable', 'husband', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'also', 'intriguing', 'movie', ""'d"", 'wonder', 'how', 'female', 'lead', 'ended', 'up', 'fish-faced', 'tool', 'who', 'out', 'emotions', 'matter', 'how', 'volcanic', 'so', 'can', 'retreat', 'basement', 'rec', 'room', 'play', 'video', 'golf', 'weirdly', 'damaged', 'too', 'pairing', 'sense', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'performance', 'off', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Nancy', 'internet-paramour-cum-torturer', 'Patric', 'usually', 'go-to', 'guy', 'hunky', 'menace', 'here', 'burdened', 'offering', 'movie', 'only', 'moments', 'actual', 'kindness', 'fatally', 'scariness', 'psycho', 'heart', 'gold', 'theory', 'intriguing', 'practice', 'just', 'murky', 'then', 'murk', 'what', 'movie', 'Downloading', 'Nancy', 'static', 'emotionally', 'numb', 'Maybe', 'appropriate', 'film', 'clinical', 'depression', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'purpose']",N/A
