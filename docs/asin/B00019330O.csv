I want to thank you for pointing this one out to me. I have always enjoyed movies about Native Americans, but this one is a modern story with a link to the past way of storytelling. A grandfather talks a grandson into taking him to a All-Nations Powwow a long drive away. He tells his grandson traditional stories to pass the time. The stories that grandfather tells are brought to life with real actors, sets, and special effects. I thought it was all nicely done. I was impressed with how many stories from a variety of nations (tribes) they managed to tell. I highly recommed this DVD.

Of 88 speaking parts, 87 were Indian, about time.The camera work in this film is outstanding. The stereo cameras provide an almostperfect match to the workings of the human eye---these facts from the special portion of the DVD.Perhaps the most meaningful thing to me, are the legends from the Old Ones of our tribes. Have Cherokee blood from both paternal and maternal sides of family and Creek from paternal bloodline as well.Some of our relatives were taken to Oklahoma to reservations there. The herding of our people to these pens broke the spirits of many. This, in my opinion, led to the reservation conditions we see today.The stories are listed in other reviews here and will not duplicate the excellent efforts put forth there. The fact that Indians are shown telling the legends of our people is very meaningful.Thank you to Robert Halmi,Sr and Jr the Producers;John Fusco, one adopted into the Nation, for his Script;Director of Photography Jon Hoffin;Music by Stephen Warbeck;and the directing by Steve Barron.This is and outstanding work by so many of the Real People.

I predict the film industry will at some point be forced to tap into indigenous and other minority cultures in film simply because looking at whats on TV and in theaters now, they have run and are running out of material! The film could have done without targeting the Kiowa as the bearers of white adoption. Many tribes took enemy captives, but the Kiowa resisted white encroachment the most, are credited with some of the highest casualty rates on whites on the southern plains, and didn't back down to the US Army.

Native American legends are so generally little-known that the film's story-telling segments have the feel of a completely original fantasy world.The stories are told within the framework of the modern-day story of a young man on the run, who agrees to take his storyteller grandfather to a powwow in New Mexico. The outer story is enjoyable--the grandfather delivers some pretty funny lines with a wonderfully deadpan expression--though not really that different from what I've seen in other Native American movies.  Still, it's got gorgeous scenery, a gorgeous young man, a funny grandfather, and horses, so who can complain?The legends are fun and exciting, with some fairly interesting special effects.  Actors tend to deliver their lines more as if they were declaiming than acting, but I assume that's part of the storytelling style.  The grandfather tells several stand-alone stories, and the epic story of Eagle Boy, told in many parts through the film.There wasn't any section or this show which failed to grip, interest or entertain. This is the most fun I've had in front of the TV for a long time.Plus, it comes with the soundtrack CD included!!! You can't get a better deal than that.One other note--Pulfrich type 3D glasses (black and clear eyes, not red-and-blue)work excellently with many of the scenes.

Along the way, Grandfather spins a number of old myths and tales from the Lakota, Cheyenne, Mohawk, Kiowa, Blackfoot, Chinook-Salish, and several other tribes that teach Shane a great deal about how to approach this life and what follows it. The myths themselves are wonderfully played-out in realistic non-animated fashion, and the 180-minute film is evenly divided between Shane & Grandpa and the stories Grandpa tells. The costume design and settings in the myth sequences are as good or better than those in even the very best western films: DREAMKEEPER truly puts you there among the Indians. The cinematography and acting are also splendid throughout. Amazing special effects too.This film could have turned out really sappy, but despite the Hallmark, it's not. The realism is stunning, especially for a made-for-TV affair. Some violence and generally disturbing material, but no serious gore or sex/nudity. Grandpa's tales include everything from the ribald ""What's this? My balls for your dinner?"" to the transcendent ""Quillwork Girl and Her Seven Star Brothers.""

The story of a young man who has made bad decisions in life who is driving his grandfather to the First Nations pow wow, while hearing stories of heroism, danger, tragedy and love is beautifully done.  The acting is strong, and it was great to see the beautiful, authentic costumes of the diverse cultures.This film was a long time coming, and I really hope this is the beginning of a new chapter in Native film in the United States.  For too long, indigenous people have been played by Whites with black wigs and ugly, unconvincing makeup.  Also, the portrayal of natives in mainstream media is embarressing and offensive (yes, even in this day and age--things actually haven't changed that much since the days of John Wayne).  We need to honor and remember the great contributions native people have made in their communities, and in their traditions that were alive long before other groups of people immigrated here.  Not all people know that there are over 500 indigenous groups.  Think of all the cultures within those groups, and all of the stories that must exist that haven't been told to a mainstream audience.

Dreamkeeper tries to be honest about modern reality as well as giving the viewer an appreciation of past traditions and their relevance to today.I love the bonus features that the DVD medium provides. I enjoyed the production featurette and the director's audio commentary track. I would have liked to have either a second audio commentary from the author, John Fusco, or have him included in the commentary track with the director. I wanted to know more about how Fusco felt about the story that he wrote and the film, actors, etc. This was a missed opportunity.Also, a widescreen presentation (instead of full screen) would have been preferable, and subtitles. How about a new, director's cut version with some more goodies and deleted scenes?Finally, I think this is a film that has a long future ahead of it, as it gets discovered by more people.

Also, good to see was a tie in with contemporary on-and-off-the-res life and a few of the problems as well as accomplishments of native peoples.In the interviews I found it refreshing to see acknowledgement paid to the universality of humans in the tradition that we have the swimming creatures; the flying creatures; the walks-on-four creatures; the walks-on-two creatures as our categories vs. the artificially narrower and divisive national, cultural, religious and ethnic categories created by organizations and groups. I would even take it one plane higher and just say we are all one category - life or just carbon creatures. There is more genetic, biological and personal variation between individuals within a population than between populations of peoples.

Crammer,"[46, 49]","The three hour length made me put off watching this DVD (it's actually from a television miniseries), but once I started watching, the time passed quickly (although I did watch it in two segments).  At the risk of sounding crass, it reminded me a bit of some of the Disney efforts of the fifties to teach children folk tales and legends (Paul Bunyon, Johnny Appleseed, etc.), only the tales and legends are from the Native American tradition, and very authentic, as I understand it.  The director makes use of modern techniques to create special effects (helpful as some of the legends involve supernatural effects, such as a rock turning into a bear).This is basically a road trip story, with an old Lakota man telling stories to his grandson as they drive from South Dakota to an All Nations Pow Wow in Santa Fe, NM.  The young man is in trouble with a gang, so he's anxious to get out of town.  The old man is trying to get the young man back on track, but instead of lecturing him, as they travel, he tells the young man stories from their tradition that make an appropriate point.  When the young man starts to talk of his love for a woman (how he got in trouble to begin with), for example, his grandfather tells him a story from the tradition about a young man who loved a woman.  The stories are fascinating and like all good stories, express universal truths, for example, that being able to have whatever you want doesn't lead to happiness.I know the DVD cautions about children, but honestly, I had trouble thinking of ANYTHING in this film that might be objectionable.  I guess there was one story that someone who was prudish might have trouble with, but given television these days -- including commercials -- I wouldn't hesitate to rate this as ""family viewing.""

796799,A3KSW2CDMNMN34,B00019330O,Mr. James A. Newton,"[35, 35]","Let me first preface this by stating that I am one of those people much more interested in contemporary Native American issues such as water/ land rights and language retention than I am in the spirituality stuff. The way I see it is that for every European like me there are probably a hundred that are awaiting a wizened medicine man to tell them all the secrets of the universe and bless them with long life...blah, blah, blah.....Taking this into account I was a little bit cautious about 'Dreamkeeper' which I received as a Christmas present from my sister. How very pleasantly suprised I was. The story starts on the Pine Ridge Reservation and a young man - Shane - being co-erced by his mother into taking his Grandfather hundreds of miles away to the All Nations Powwow in New Mexico. Shane reluctantly agrees and so the real story starts.Along the trip the Grandfather - a storyteller - relates stories that are relevant to Shane in understanding events happening in his own life and that of some of the people they meet along the way. I won't divulge too much else about the story except to say that Shane meets his estranged father and there is a reconciliation between the two. By the end of the trip Shane has also 'found' that there is more to himself than he believed.The stories presented are great in terms of detail to attention, covering a broad breadth of Native American cultures and never neglecting humour - love the ugly woman in the cave.
