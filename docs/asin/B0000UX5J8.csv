And I just don't understand why. I think it's funnier than both Gremlins and Critters, with campy and over-the-top performances by Harvey Korman and Alix Elias.

One day I was browsing a movie store and found this lost gem for 7 bucks.  Needless to say I snatch that little beggar up.  Heck I would have spent 15 dollars to recapture a little of my childhood.  Amazingly enough I still laughed at some of same parts I did when I was a kid.  The characters are just way over the top and very cartoon like, especially Dude, the deadhead.  This movie like many of its genre shows everything bad about the 80s, which is one thing I enjoy about films such as these.This film came out during the same decade that brought us other movies with little killer monsters such as Gremlins, Ghoulies I and II, Puppet Master, and Critters I and II.  Granted, Munchies are much tamer movie than those other films, but it has to be the funniest out of the bunch.  If you weren't a kid during the 80s you might ask yourself why the heck do some people like this film?

HOWEVER, this movie holds it's own by drawing you in with it's interesting yet corny story.  Somehow a tiny living alien nicknamed a &#34;Munchie&#34; is discovered in an Incan tomb and brought back to the United States to prove the existence of alien influence on Incan architecture and culture.  Apparently this &#34;Munchie&#34; is a very quick learner and picks up speaking other languages very well on top of developing a very perverted personality when exposed to his very first playboy!  I don't want to spoil the movie but like the Gremlins, the Munchies can replicate by cutting them in half and unlike the Gremlins, the Munchies can not be killed!

This movie is fun and silly, and very cheaply made. The creatures look ridiculous and fake, but as the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, this just adds to the charm. Horny little monsters with the munchies... Cool! The added trait that if you chop them up into little pieces, the pieces will multiply into new Munchies is another twist on Gremlins-style lore, but unique and cool in its own way.
