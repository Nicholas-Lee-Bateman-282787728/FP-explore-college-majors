Just the flaw in describing the main character as she walks around endlessly telling her story to you.  It is one of those movies you watch when you have the flu and can't think anyways.

A bugdet of a camera and little else. the character goes around a world where stores still are full of product and have lights on etc. Some scenes where the infected chase her are good but others make no sense. FOr instance six of them jump on her , she manages to defeat them off camera?. They did the best they could with abdolutely no money though. It's similiar to videofilm of the 80's, where some folks decided to make a movie with no money or experience. In spite of that , the lead actress is quite good, perhaps she had lessons? The boy is good too. But the budget makes this one for fans of microbudget or made by first timers with a camera fans only. I love bad movies though, I give lots of 3 star ratings for movies that most people would rate as one star , but this one was just beyond low budget that it's hard to say two stars wasn't generous.  the sets here are  outside shots mainly , they couldn't find any good areas that look overgrown, so they just filmed deserted streets.
