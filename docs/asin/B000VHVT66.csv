1101579,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B000VHVT66,Brian Maitland,"[1, 3]","I don't get casting directors. Do they really think putting Natalie Portman in a movie will drive the box office especially when she plays a Spanish woman? I guess in the entire nation of Spain there are no beautiful Spanish actresses capable of playing this role. The hilarious thing is she plays both the mother and the daughter yet the poor makeup job makes both look exactly the same age.Add to this the actor playing the painter Francisco Goya is Swedish and American Randy Quaid plays the Spanish king. OK, I get actors can play people of other nationalities but get real.Plus this movie is not really about Goya at all and is supposed to be about what Goya observes during the Inquisition and the French invasion of Spain. Although I half expected No Country Bardem to pull out the air pump and kill Portman or a few Spanish priests, he sadly did not. It would have made this movie about as plausible as the casting.In the ""making of"" featurette, Milos Forman claims this is a story the world has been waiting to see on the big screen. Really? People were dying to hear of the Spanish Inquisition starring Natalie Portman? I think Monty Python did it better, funnier and got the point across--these people back then were power hungry and insane.Let's put it this way even the Spanish thought Forman's take was dreadful as it grossed barely over $2 million at the box office there and only $8 million worldwide.To be honest, other than One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest back in 1975, Forman makes pretentious twaddle even his hits like Amadeus.

1101581,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000VHVT66,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is a good film, but not a great film. It misses the mark because it is a dark tale and it does not go far enough into the darkness to convince us of its authenticity. Whereas many may have wished that Milos Forman had produced another Amadeus, Goya's Ghost suffers by backing away from the horror it should have depicted. The film wisely placed the outstanding artist Goya as an observer of cruelty, corruption, and chaos. Thus we see much of the film through the moral eyes of the artist Goya. Yet, the film tries too hard to entertain. When three French soldiers rape a Spanish young woman, the bright costumes and half-hearted slapstick struggle is not convincing. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain under the ideological cover of overthrowing the incompetent decadent Bourbon family. Instead he met considerable insurgency from the Spanish people who hated the French invaders more than they hated to incompetent Bourbon family. But the nastiness of this terrible confrontation is caught by Goya's amazing paintings and prints but is not really captured on film. The film is educating for those who are not familiar with the political and social conditions during the time that Goya was the favorite painter of King Carlos IV and his wife, Queen Maria Luisa. Carlos is depicted as not especially bright and Maria Luisa is depicted, accurately, as the dominant partner in the marriage who was known for her love affairs. Goya is accurately pictured as the court painter, managing the challenges of painting some homely royalty in a manner that would please them but also retain the integrity of his artistic vision. Goya also is known for his paintings and prints of the Spanish Inquisition, a cruel and terrible institution by which the Roman Catholic Church practiced torture and murder in the name of religious doctrine and ideology. Goya is also known for his series of gory prints of the scenes of cruelty imposed on the Spanish peasants by the French soldiers as well as by the soldiers on the Spanish peasants. All are guilty in Goya's world. But the film should have been darker to fully capture the ignorance and cruelty of the times. After investing millions of dollars in this film, certainly there would be the temptation to `lighten up' and not fully immerse the viewer into the darkness that was Spain at this time in history, but by not going far enough the viewer is left with a somewhat confusing reaction to the entire film.Francisco Goya is played by Stellan Skarsgard, who does a great job of portraying an ethical and moral actor in a world of chaos. His primary patrons, Carlos IV played perfectly by Randy Quaid and Queen Maria Luisa, played by Blanca Portillo, are engaging and entertaining. But it is the Inquisition activist monk, Brother Lorenzo, for whom this story really revolves. The constantly changing fortunes of Lorenzo depict the turmoil of the times. It is Lorenzo's fall from grace, his rise to power, and then his second fall which is the primary character development and trajectory of the film. Javier Bardem plays him well. His fall and rise and fall are contrasted against that of the victim, Ines, played by Natalie Portman. This poor character is victimized by the terror of the Inquisition, revealing the incredible bigotry of the Catholic Church toward the Jewish people. Her poor parents try to gain her release but to no avail. Here Foreman missed the mark. He depicts this wealthy family as being in distress at the arrest and imprisonment of their daughter, but he stops short of capturing and expressing the complete terror that such events would have for a family. Foreman makes the mistake of trying to tell a tale of horror, torture, cruelty, murder, and injustice but he also tries too hard to entertain",4,Dark but not dark enough to match the work of Goya,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,3765,"['good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'mark', 'dark', 'tale', 'not', 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'darkness', 'convince', 'authenticity', 'Whereas', 'many', 'may', 'have', 'wished', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'had', 'produced', 'Amadeus', 'Goya', 'Ghost', 'suffers', 'backing', 'away', 'horror', 'should', 'have', 'depicted', 'film', 'wisely', 'placed', 'outstanding', 'artist', 'Goya', 'observer', 'cruelty', 'corruption', 'chaos', 'Thus', 'see', 'much', 'film', 'moral', 'eyes', 'artist', 'Goya', 'film', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'entertain', 'When', 'three', 'French', 'soldiers', 'rape', 'Spanish', 'young', 'woman', 'bright', 'costumes', 'half-hearted', 'slapstick', 'struggle', 'not', 'convincing', 'Napoleon', 'Bonaparte', 'invaded', 'Spain', 'ideological', 'cover', 'overthrowing', 'incompetent', 'decadent', 'Bourbon', 'family', 'Instead', 'met', 'considerable', 'insurgency', 'Spanish', 'people', 'who', 'hated', 'French', 'invaders', 'more', 'hated', 'incompetent', 'Bourbon', 'family', 'nastiness', 'terrible', 'confrontation', 'caught', 'Goya', 'amazing', 'paintings', 'prints', 'not', 'really', 'captured', 'film', 'film', 'educating', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'political', 'social', 'conditions', 'time', 'Goya', 'was', 'favorite', 'painter', 'King', 'Carlos', 'IV', 'wife', 'Queen', 'Maria', 'Luisa', 'Carlos', 'depicted', 'not', 'especially', 'bright', 'Maria', 'Luisa', 'depicted', 'accurately', 'dominant', 'partner', 'marriage', 'who', 'was', 'known', 'love', 'affairs', 'Goya', 'accurately', 'pictured', 'court', 'painter', 'managing', 'challenges', 'painting', 'homely', 'royalty', 'manner', 'would', 'please', 'also', 'retain', 'integrity', 'artistic', 'vision', 'Goya', 'also', 'known', 'paintings', 'prints', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'cruel', 'terrible', 'institution', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'practiced', 'torture', 'murder', 'name', 'religious', 'doctrine', 'ideology', 'Goya', 'also', 'known', 'series', 'gory', 'prints', 'scenes', 'cruelty', 'imposed', 'Spanish', 'peasants', 'French', 'soldiers', 'as', 'well', 'soldiers', 'Spanish', 'peasants', 'are', 'guilty', 'Goya', 'world', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'darker', 'fully', 'capture', 'ignorance', 'cruelty', 'times', 'investing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'film', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'temptation', 'lighten', 'up', 'not', 'fully', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'darkness', 'was', 'Spain', 'time', 'history', 'not', 'going', 'far', 'enough', 'viewer', 'left', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'reaction', 'entire', 'film.Francisco', 'Goya', 'played', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'ethical', 'moral', 'actor', 'world', 'chaos', 'primary', 'patrons', 'Carlos', 'IV', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Queen', 'Maria', 'Luisa', 'played', 'Blanca', 'Portillo', 'are', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'Inquisition', 'activist', 'monk', 'Brother', 'Lorenzo', 'whom', 'story', 'really', 'constantly', 'changing', 'fortunes', 'Lorenzo', 'depict', 'turmoil', 'times', 'Lorenzo', 'fall', 'grace', 'rise', 'power', 'then', 'second', 'fall', 'primary', 'character', 'development', 'trajectory', 'film', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'well', 'fall', 'rise', 'fall', 'are', 'contrasted', 'victim', 'Ines', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'poor', 'character', 'victimized', 'terror', 'Inquisition', 'revealing', 'incredible', 'bigotry', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Jewish', 'people', 'poor', 'parents', 'try', 'gain', 'release', 'avail', 'Here', 'Foreman', 'missed', 'mark', 'wealthy', 'family', 'being', 'distress', 'arrest', 'imprisonment', 'daughter', 'short', 'capturing', 'expressing', 'complete', 'terror', 'such', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'family', 'Foreman', 'mistake', 'trying', 'tell', 'tale', 'horror', 'torture', 'cruelty', 'murder', 'injustice', 'also', 'too', 'hard', 'entertain']",Goya's Ghosts Natalie Portman ALL Regions PAL DVD Milos Forman

Unfortunately, in this fantasy on the paintings and prints of Goya, the framework is weak. In spots one gets cinematic highlights and effective interaction of characters, in other spots, however, one gets the most hoary of film images and situations. Except for a few scenes, where an image is allowed which would have banned by the Hayes Office, one could imagine oneself watching, once more, an Irving Thalberg film starring his wife, Norma Shearer, such as Marie Antoinette (although nobody in this film resembles the hero of that one, beautiful Tyrone Power). Beyond that weakness, the story itself lacks a sense of filmatic inevitability. In key segments, one gets the feeling that they appear to appease the creators need to get the scene in, rather than because they had to happen. That sense, that some particular action grows from the nature of the film's reality, is crucial to a fine film; in other words, in reality the action may be ridiculously unreal, but in the film it clearly arises from necessity.Despite these criticisms, for most of us, this film is worth the time taken to watch it.

When Ines is taken captive by the inquisition and forced to make a false confession these lives become entangled in ways they never would have guessed. During the tumultuous years of the Inquisition, and then the invasion by Napoleon's forces, these people's lives are thrown into a kind of madness when their world's are thrown upside down. The scenes in the movie are interesting in that they are often recreations of Goya's own paintings, drawings and etchings. One feels like one is experiencing something of this great painter's life, with the surroundings and people that formed the basis for his works.The movie looks very good for a dvd with rich colours and good clarity, and with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack that pulses to life with its orchestral track and details of sound.

1101588,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000VHVT66,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[8, 8]","Goya's Ghost is an excellent film that surfaces the great contributions of Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes. Born on March 30th, 1746, Goya was a famous Spanish painter and printmaker who served to record history through his art during the Spanish Inquisition.During his life, Goya was given great commissions, such as decorating the bare stone walls of El Escorial and the Palacio Real del Pardo, where Spanish monarchs were to reside, therefore, Goya was given access to the royal court and painted many of the portraits of the time.Goya was a favorite of King Carlos III and became a friend to Crown Prince Don Luis, living in his house while he was painting the portraits of the Queen. After an illness where he contracted a high fever, Goya is left deaf and became introspective and reserved. Goya becomes rather informed about the French Revolution because while recuperating he dedicates his idle time to reading the philosophical writings of the rights of man.During the reign of Charles III and IV, Goya becomes the royal painter, finally promoted to First Court Painter and assigned a salary of 50,000 reales, which was a fortune at the time. Goya is not given to flattery and paints subjects as he sees them, and the Queen of Spain is rather upset when she sees her image interpreted by Goya because the result is that of a rather ugly female.In this movie, we see Goya's relationship to Brother Lorenzo, played by Javier Bardem and to a model he uses, played by Natalie Portman. The movie surfaces how Judaism was persecuted. Anyone suspected of respecting or following any of the traditions of Jews ended in jail, put the test, the famous ""Question"" which through torture tested those accused on their resolve to tell the truth. But the cruelty of the torture was such that anyone put to the test would end up asking: ""What is the truth you seek?"" and they would confess to anything so they would be left alone.Ines, Goya's model, is suspected of practicing Judaism simply because she refuses to eat pork during a night out with her brothers. Her father asks that Goya intercede with those in power to obtain the freedom of his daughter and because he is a rather wealthy merchant he donates a large fortune to the Church in exchange for his daughter. But the Church representatives are not moved and while they accept the donation, they do not return Ines and the father proves to Brother Lorenzo how any man / woman put to ""The Question"" would confess anything for the torture to stop.Brother Lorenzo visits Ines in prison and is taken by the young beauty, and he takes advantage of her situation... much ensues... and we learned lots about the Spanish Inquisition and how Spain is influenced and transformed by the French Revolution and Napoleon's invasion.We enjoyed the film, learned about a subject that we rarely find in films, the Spanish Inquisition, and were very impressed with Natalie Portman's ability to play multiple roles for she is Ines... young and old, and a daughter that is born while in prison, fathered by Brother Lorenzo.

Memories of his own childhood and youth, reflection on the years spent under the suffocating power of the oppressive political regimes are the main subjects of his film that takes place in Spain of the late 18th -beginning of the 19th centuries and focuses realistically on the role of the Inquisition and its end under Napoleon's rule. Forman was a college student when he read and studied the book about Spanish Inquisition that affected all aspects in the lives of the ordinary people but it took him many years to envision the film that would bring his reflection to life through the paintings, drawings and prints of the great Artist who had captured the spirit of those times brilliantly.I personally love ""Goya's Ghosts. Visually, it was just like Goya's painting spanned in time and space.  I've always admired Goya, ever since I read the novel by Lion Feuchtwanger, and saw Goya's paintings and prints first as a teenager in reproductions and Art books. Few years ago I saw many of his originals for the first time in Prado, Madrid. They were very different - dark, twisted, macabre, sensual, serene, tender, satiric, realistic, romantic, hallucinatory, surreal, very Spanish yet universal in their understanding of human nature. ""Everyone wants to seem what they are not, all deceive each other and no-one knows himself,"" wrote Francisco Goya on one of his prints.  His works are strange mixture of horror and hope, monsters born while the mind wonders in the dream world (the series Los Capriccios), the formal portraits of the royal family with not a single flattering image. They were created during the times when Inquisition ruled the country with an iron hand, and the time is the real hero of the Milos Forman's movie. Goya has been regarded both as the last of the Old Masters and as the first of the moderns. It is not just a coincidence that Goya lived and created his paintings and prints that captured closely the time when Spain was changing slowly from old times to new modern epoch but how slow and painful the changes were.  The story in the movie may seem too blizzard and implausible but if you look closer in the movie's images, you'd realize that the characters of the story, the whole surrealistic and wild content came directly from Goya's works, his paintings, drawings, and prints. He lived through surreal time, and the time got a fascinating treatment in his works and in the work of the great modern film director, Milos Forman. The final scene of the film with all Goya's ghosts presented and with him capturing the bitterly ironic in their grotesque absurdity images in his sketch book is a masterwork of cinema.",4,"""In Spain, during the Goya's time, I was searching for echoes of my own life under the Nazis and the Communists ..""

In GOYA'S GHOSTS he not only explores the multifaceted aspects of the great Spanish artist Francisco Goya as a painter of court portraits as well as canvases  of dramatic collisions between the factions of people versus military cruelty of 18th and 19th century Spain, but he also dissects the infamous Spanish Inquisition, not only by defining characters who represented the Holy Office and the victims of the 'purging' but also by subtly remarking on the tenor of the times by focusing on Goya's 80 etchings titled 'Los Caprichos'. This is a richly realized film that captures the horror of the times while it offers insights into the changes that occurred in Spain in a rather comprehensive fashion.1792 and while Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgrd) is painting portraits of the royal family (Randy Quaid and Blanca Portillo) as well as portraits of his favorite model In&eacute;s (Natalie Portman) and of the Inquisition activist Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem).  Corruption abounds  in Spain and the fear of the Inquisition headed by Father Gregorio (Michael Lonsdale) penetrates all of society. When In&eacute;s is called before the Inquisition because she doesn't like the taste of pork offered at a public banquet, she is tortured for not confessing to be a Jewess and imprisoned.  Despite the pleadings of Goya and the money offered by her family (Brother Lorenzo is asked to intervene on her behalf), In&eacute;s remains in prison for 15 years and when Brother Lorenzo visits her he impregnates her and the resulting girl child is sold upon her birth).  France invades Spain (courtesy of Napoleon Bonaparte) and when the French Revolution begins to spread through Europe the chastised Brother Lorenzo travels to France where he assumes a new life away from the church.  During the trauma of these years Goya loses his hearing and in response to the disintegration of society, creates the Caprichos - etchings that stress the brutality and madness to which the country has succumbed.  Lorenzo returns to Spain, the prisoners of the Inquisition are freed, and In&eacute;s (now pitifully ugly) searches for her daughter, confronting Lorenzo with the paternity. How all of the pieces of the Caprichos come to life brings an end to the story fills the final moments of this fine period piece.Javier Bardem is particularly strong in his role of the mutating Lorenzo and Stellan Skarsgrd makes Goya an understandable genius.  In addition to the named cast there are excellent cameo roles for such fine actors as Unax Ugalde, Wael Al Moubayed (Goya's interpreter), Jos&eacute; Luis G&oacute;mez and Mabel Rivera among others.  The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe captures the flavor of the period and the musical score by Varhan Bauer and Jos&eacute; Nieto quotes some 20th century compositions (Shostakovich) and blends Spanish court and dance themes into a rich musical tapestry.  This is a fine film despite the lack of critical acceptance and certainly deserves a large audience, especially those who appreciate historical drama.

The acting was uniformly high quality, and the fact that it hit so many moral themes that we would not touch with a ten foot pole were they taking place during contemporary times, raised in my mind how dominating Spanish influence has been on the development of Western society.We tend to forget that even before England assumed the mantle of leader of the Western world, it was Spain that claimed and carried that mantle for nearly half a millennium after the decline of Rome. For better, and often for worse, it was Spanish moral, religious and political corruption that set the stage for modern Western democracies. It was Spain that expelled both the Jews and the Muslims, introduced African slavery, and the inquests to the Western world. It was Spanish Catholics that went along with and acquiesced to the political corruption of the crown.Without being heavy handed, we see these flawed morals being played out in the subtext of this movie.

Francisco de Goya is the real painter of the King and certainly the best of Spain at that moment. His muse is an alluring teenager Ines, daughter of a wealthy family.But the wings of the moral degradation dressed with Holy clothes finds a reason to imprison her once the Brother Lorenzo a sort of little Savonarola induces the Holy Office to restore the moral authority and bring back the Church the ancient fears and missed respect in those times of sacrilege and heresy.Ines is captured in the tavern and supposedly accused of Jewish rituals because her linage involves her with a Jewish converted to Catholicism, 168 years before.This fact will become the dramatic premise for this tragic story when the Brother Lorenzo will use and exert all his influence to abuse her. Soon he is unmasked and expatriated to France where the new airs of the French Revolution will transform this chameleon and faker in the most conspicuous delegate of the new moral order.

Schneider,"[2, 2]","Milos Forman has made some good movies and was awarded 2 Best Director Oscars for his past work: `One flew over the Cuckoo Nest' and later `Amadeus' were also successful in the market place.I don't know how the market reacted to `Goya's Ghosts', but I know that I was rather disgusted myself. Poor Goya got hijacked for a trashy pulp film. His drawings of the Inquisition and of the French invasion under Napoleon serve as excuse for a wild, vulgar, violent monster story.Stellan Skarsgrd seems to look like the real Goya and does a decent if not so complicated job. Many scenes from the film look like Goya's drawings.Nathalie Portman has a triple role: she is the innocent young woman who gets dragged into the wheels of the Inquisition under suspicion of practicing Judaism (because she refused to eat pork in a tavern while spies watched); she is the same woman after 15 years in the dungeon, with her mind deranged (which also gives Forman another chance at going into a mental institution); and she is her own daughter as a 15 y old prostitute.Bardem is the ultimate piece of opportunist manure: first an inquisition Jacobin, then a Spanish Quisling in French service, always at the forefront of the respective ideology. Incidentally he is also Portman's rapist and the father of her daughter.If you want to know more about Goya, go elsewhere.If you want to know more about the inquisition, go elsewhere.If you want to know more about Spain and Napoleon, go elsewhere.If you have never seen a Goya painting or print, then this film serves the purpose of showing you some and of putting them roughly in context.

I must give credit to the director for being able to create such strong a scene with so few expressions and scripts. In the last scene, Portman gives the best moment of the entire movie.

1101604,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000VHVT66,K. Driscoll,"[5, 5]","Milos Forman's (AmadeusandOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) film about some of the fascinating events that occurred during the time of Francisco Goya was not widely seen and received for the most part mixed reviews.  It was criticized primarily for being too slow and having a convoluted plot.  I suppose I can see where those points might have merit but I found Goya's Ghosts pros to far outweigh the cons.  So much so I was very close to giving this a five star rating.  My one true hang-up was that the film is a Spanish production shot in English.  Odd, and the mix of accents can be slightly annoying in flashes.The performances here from Stellan Skarsgrd, Javier Bardem, and Natalie Portman are highlights in all of their careers.  This is probably the only time besidesNo Country for Old Menthat I really watched Bardem.  In the first half of this film Bardem plays a character that is behaviorally not very different from his role in 2007's best picture Oscar winner, but as Goya's Ghosts moves forward his character changes and Bardem's depth is on display.  He really is a great actor.  Portman on the other hand has always been touted as great for her potential but has never really had a showcase role.  Here she does, and unfortunately no one saw it.  Portman is a legitimate super-talent that only gets these tiny opportunities to show that off to the mainstream.  Something tells me she doesn't care about that but it would be nice to see her land a big budget Oscar bait role where she can really get the credit she deserves.  Stellan Skarsgrd is good in almost everything he has ever done.  Moreover, the supporting cast is also strong.  Especially the performance of unlikely cast member Randy Quaid. That's right, I said Randy Quaid, who plays King Carlos IV.The film is set in late 18th century Spain during the time of the French Revolution.  Goya (Skarsgrd), a famous artist for Spanish royalty, seemingly becomes a target from the inquisition.  Lorenzo, a monk who soon becomes in charge of the inquisition's more intense initiatives, defends Goya.  Lorenzo actually becomes a subject of one of Goya's paintings.  In&eacute;s (Portman), a Goya muse, is soon targeted by the inquisition.  This brings microcosmic conflict between many of the film's characters while the macrocosmic conflicts of the time period shift the characters even more profoundly.  This makes for some very interesting and unpredictable circumstances.  So much so, that it might be best to leave the rest unmentioned here.  Suffice to say, I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would.Goya's Ghosts references his paintings effectively and although the film may be guilty of unlikely coincidences, some melodrama, and some historical inaccuracy; it is certainly no more guilty of those things than other period pieces that are widely acclaimed by today's critics.  Goya is the straight man of Goya's Ghosts, he is the observer and his work is used toward the narrative while the film is used as a tribute of sorts toward his work.  I see Goya's Ghosts as being one par with both One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. Perhaps if Foreman were appreciated today like he was twenty or thirty years ago critics would've received this film with the same level of praise?  Not sure, but I'm recommending this.",4,A Nearly Great Film that Nobody Saw,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,3310,"['Milos', 'Forman', 'AmadeusandOne', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'film', 'fascinating', 'events', 'occurred', 'time', 'Francisco', 'Goya', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'seen', 'received', 'most', 'part', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'was', 'criticized', 'primarily', 'being', 'too', 'slow', 'having', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'suppose', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'points', 'might', 'have', 'merit', 'found', 'Goya', 'Ghosts', 'pros', 'far', 'outweigh', 'cons', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'giving', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'one', 'true', 'hang-up', 'was', 'film', 'Spanish', 'production', 'shot', 'English', 'Odd', 'mix', 'accents', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'flashes.The', 'performances', 'here', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'are', 'highlights', 'careers', 'probably', 'only', 'time', 'besidesNo', 'Country', 'Old', 'Menthat', 'really', 'watched', 'Bardem', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Bardem', 'character', 'behaviorally', 'not', 'very', 'different', 'role', '2007', 'best', 'picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Goya', 'Ghosts', 'forward', 'character', 'changes', 'Bardem', 'depth', 'display', 'really', 'great', 'actor', 'Portman', 'other', 'hand', 'always', 'been', 'touted', 'great', 'potential', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'showcase', 'role', 'Here', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'saw', 'Portman', 'legitimate', 'super-talent', 'only', 'tiny', 'opportunities', 'show', 'mainstream', 'Something', 'tells', ""n't"", 'care', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'land', 'big', 'budget', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'role', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'credit', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'good', 'almost', 'everything', 'ever', 'done', 'Moreover', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'strong', 'Especially', 'performance', 'unlikely', 'cast', 'member', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'right', 'said', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'who', 'King', 'Carlos', 'IV.The', 'film', 'set', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'Spain', 'time', 'French', 'Revolution', 'Goya', 'Skarsgrd', 'famous', 'artist', 'Spanish', 'royalty', 'seemingly', 'target', 'inquisition', 'Lorenzo', 'monk', 'who', 'soon', 'charge', 'inquisition', 'more', 'intense', 'initiatives', 'Goya', 'Lorenzo', 'actually', 'subject', 'one', 'Goya', 'paintings', 'eacute', 'Portman', 'Goya', 'muse', 'soon', 'targeted', 'inquisition', 'microcosmic', 'conflict', 'many', 'film', 'characters', 'macrocosmic', 'conflicts', 'time', 'period', 'shift', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'profoundly', 'very', 'interesting', 'unpredictable', 'circumstances', 'So', 'much', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'leave', 'rest', 'unmentioned', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'thought', 'would.Goya', 'Ghosts', 'paintings', 'effectively', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'guilty', 'unlikely', 'coincidences', 'melodrama', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'certainly', 'no', 'more', 'guilty', 'things', 'other', 'period', 'pieces', 'are', 'widely', 'acclaimed', 'today', 'critics', 'Goya', 'straight', 'man', 'Goya', 'Ghosts', 'observer', 'work', 'used', 'narrative', 'film', 'used', 'tribute', 'sorts', 'work', 'see', 'Goya', 'Ghosts', 'being', 'one', 'par', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Amadeus', 'Perhaps', 'Foreman', 'were', 'appreciated', 'today', 'was', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'years', 'critics', 'would', ""'ve"", 'received', 'film', 'same', 'level', 'praise', 'Not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'recommending']",Goya's Ghosts Natalie Portman ALL Regions PAL DVD Milos Forman

It is not the stunning, fast-paced and colorful display of Amadeus, but it is a fine looking and entertaining film chocked full of tasty historical and philosophical tidbits.  It also has that sense of mystery that made Amadeus so great.I thought it would be more biographical, but it turns into an interesting story about the end of the Golden Age of Spain as well as perspective on the War of Independence.I won't give the story away because it is much more fun for the viewer to be surprised at the interesting twists and turns.The acting can at times be a little stiff, but once the story was completed I appreciated it as a whole. So be patient and let it unfold.The portrayal of Goya is subtle. He is not lionized or trashed. Stellan Skarsgrd plays the role with a degree of sophistication and worldliness that is surprising.  The acting of Natalie Portman is a take it or leave it proposition. However, the Brother Lorenzo played by Javier Bardem is a witty and enjoyable villain on par with Maestro Salieri.  Randy Quaid is truly memorable as the aging, dimwitted King of Spain.Many interesting historical events and artistic developments are on display in the film, so it is a feast for the lover of Spanish culture.We can only hope we will see many more films of this kind.

There is an underling message in the movie that is not being commented on: humans have desires for power, wealth, sex, hate, love, and beauty. The methods used to achieve these are vividly portrayed in the movie. The justifications are for the most part a coverup to protect the individual from being exposed that he is taking advantage of the circumstances to benefit himself.The Catholic Church employed the Inquisition as a form of ""cleansing"" in the guise of love for Jesus. There are lots of examples in the last 2 decades of ""protecting"" the populace by torturing and killing ""enemies"". The men who did the interrogation were fanatics and those who did the torture enjoyed their hatred of other humans. The merchant offered a bribe to get his daughter freed, but the inquisitors who would materially benefit claimed it was just a donation of a loyal Catholic. Political donations are bribes. Financial advisers take their fees while telling you they are increasing your wealth.Those who are supposed to be the protectors take advantage of their position for sex- politicians, clergy, coaches. The French courts punished past evildoers but also innocents who were falsely condemned by personal enemies. In the movie the judges are signing the death warrant before the ""trial"" is even over. Watch the movie and you will see many additional examplesThe movie helps you picture the terrors and frustration of the period. It helps you see the superb craftsmanship of the time. I would not characterize the movie as entertainment. It's value is taking a look at how cruel humans can be to each other when they are driven by power or the inherent competitiveness between humans.

Many of the historical details are wrong, the acting is considered ""over the top"",  and the plot thought of as confused and the pacing too slow.  Of all the critics who reviewed it, only 26% liked it.However, from the moment the film opened I couldn't get my eyes off the screen.  I loved the pomp and spectacular setting, I thought the acting was terrific and in my mind there wasn't a dull moment.  O.K. - I didn't know much about this particular period of history and had no way of knowing the historical accuracy of the the plot. But. after all, this was a fictional movie, produced for entertainment.Staring Javier Bardem as Lorenzo, a priest during the Inquisition and Stellan Skarsgard as Franciso Goya, the painter, the film opens as the wicked priest is looking for heretics to torture.  Natalie Portman is a cast as young woman whose portrait had just been painted by Goya.  She comes from a wealthy merchant family and is leading a happy life.  But the bad priest has her arrested and tortured until she confesses that the reason she declined to eat pork was because she was a secret Jew.  In spite of her father giving a fortune to the Church, she is kept in prison and raped by the priest. The father also embarrasses the Priest by entrapping him in what seems like a good way to prove his daughter's innocence, forcing the priest to flee the country but still not releasing the daughter from the horrors of the Inquisition.  Fifteen years pass.  Napoleon invades Spain and the former priest has become a wealthy Frenchman.  After all this time in the horrible jail, the daughter is now an ugly half-mad crone who is searching for her daughter who was born in jail.  Goya helps the daughter out and the plot thickens.I found all this fascinating and wasn't bored for a moment.  There was a lot of pomp, great costumes and good depictions of  both the splendor and horror of the time and the place.  Acting was good.  And the plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It might not have really happened this way but I personally didn't care about this.

Using the characters of Inez, Lorenzo and Goya who observes them both, Forman demonstrates the cruelty and absurdity of mass hysteria, brutal war and the assumption of unrestrained power. Inez is an innocent metaphor for artistic vision and Lorenzo a portrayal of fanaticism. Watching them both is Goya, unable to rescue anyone in a world gone mad with violence in the name of right. Observing the tragedy of Inez and the blindness of Lorenzo (given a taste of his own cruel medicine over a dining table)reveals to us what would have driven Goya to paint the images of Saturn devouring his children in his later life. Important for its portrayal of these historical events, the film is not pretty to watch, or uplifting, but sobering and thought provoking.

Though heart-breaking, the story is fascinating because it reminds you of how fragile our lives really are, and how forces beyond our control can turn life onto a completely different path.The only thing I didn't really get and why I rated the movie at four stars, not five, was that although the title is Goya's Ghosts, Goya himself is really just an observer to the main storyline.  He doesn't play an important role in the story at all, and as I watched it there came a point when I thought, why is this character even in here?

PLEASE read this PS, and, if you so desire, tell other people its message....As this movie deals with the Spanish Inquistion, and brings up religious discusssions in general, I'd like to mention a recent religius discusssion I had, quite unexpectedly, with a new, Moslem neighbour of mine.  I generally like my privacy, and don't discuss much, (and try to be seen little), with my neighbours.  They're nice people -- it's just that I like my privacy.  However, I was waiting by the elevator, near the front door, of our building, to reject a package I had mistakenly ordered, so meeting with negibours was unavoidable.  I got into a conversation with this nice guy, eventually mentioning to him my own theory that I've had for a while, that God made up all these different religions to see how and if we all got along together.  This nice guy, a Moslem, informed me that THIS IDEA THAT I THOUGHT I HAD MADE UP BY MYSELF, WAS ACTUALLY IN THE KORAN!  I said, ""You're kidding!""  He smiled and said, ""No--it's in there!""  Well, I guess I DID make it up, because before last week, I never knew it WAS in the Koran.  And, if it IS in the Koran....  Isn't it then a sin for those believing in Islam to go on a ""Jihad"", and try to make everyone a Moslem?  I mean, it's in the Koran not only that God created all these religions, but also WHY He did!  Converting Everyone to Islam would distroy this purpose, wouldn't it?  If you have a mind to, please feel free to postulate this theory with any Moslem person you may meet! Permission is here totally granted!  I know I will discuss this with my nice Moslem neighbour, if and when I ever bump into him again.  I don't know what he thinks of this, but I do know this.  When I said I have nothing against ""fundamentalists"", that Jimmy Carter is a ""fundamentalist"", believing in his own religion, but also respecting and honouring other traditions, and that the people I dislike are not ""fundamentalists"", but FANATICS, my neighbour smiled in agreement!  Hopefully, other people of many faiths think the same way.  If this is true....maybe people HAVE come a long way from the Spanish Inquistion, after all.  That is, at least SOME people have....(shudder!)M A I N.....R E V I E W..:This is a cohesive, immensely followable film, that holds one's interest from beginning to end.  Although a work of fiction, this film -- as historical fiction -- still needed to be grounded on historical FACT to be credible.  What was INcredible to me was that the Inquisition, (started in 1492 by Ferdinand and Isabella -- yes, THAT Ferdinand and Isabella, who gave Columbus the money he needed to explore the Indies...and resulted instead in the discovery of the Americas -- the New World), was still around in 1792, when the story begins!In the story, INES, (portrayed by NATALIE PORTMAN, who from the first scene onward, shows herself to be versatile in many different situations, and is here quite different from her most famous role, that of Queen Amidala in the ""Star Wars"" series.)  Here, Ines is a beautiful young lady and daughter of a rich merchant.  She is intelligent, but her station in life has obviously kept her from experiencing any of the darker things life can hold.  She is happy in the home of an obviously loving mother and father, and brothers.  Inez is posing to give inspiration, to Francisco Goya, the famous Spanish painter, and a family friend.  Later, Ines accompanies her brothers to a local tavern, and, with them, enjoys the atmosphere, as well as food and drink.The next day, Ines is summoned by the Inquisition! She and her parents, and her two brothers. and even their servants, are all terrified.  They all know what the Inquisition could do...and besides, whatever could she have done that was wrong?When she goes to the Inquistion,they ask her her name, and what she did the day before.  Yes, she went the tavern.  Yes, she ate chicken and vegetables there.  No, she did not eat any of the pork that was offered her -- because, as she innoently remarks, she just doesn't like the TASTE of pork.But the Inquisition sees thing sifferently.  Her not eating pork, signifies to them, that she has secretly been practicing Judaism!  (To the modern mind, this is akin to accusing someone of being a communist, because they like wearing the colour red -- but the Inquisition, (and perhaps Joe McCarthy, too), were in dead earnest.Complicating this is the fact that is broght up later, when a friar, comes to dinner.  He reveals a fact known to the Inquisition, and to Inez father -- but to no one else.  And that is that the family CONVERTED from Judaism to Catholicism about 125 years earlier, when immigrating from Holland.  Heavens -- was Inez backsliding?(( Poor Ines! She obviously did NOT want re-convert to the Judaism her family had left behind a century and a quarter before. I don't even think she even knew that pork is forbidden to Jews. If she HAD known about Jewish Law, she would have been able to tell the Inquisition that Jewish Law says that the MOST imporant thing to do is STAY ALIVE, no matter what you must eat. If kosher food is not available, you MUST eat the non-kosher meat, stay alive, and help the continuity of the Jewish people. Therefore, if she DID want to covert to Judaism, she WOULD have eaten the pork, just to put on a show for those who might be watching. Some Jews did just this -- pretend to be Catholic in public, and only secretly practiced Judaism.  These were called ""Marranos"". Some Jews, of course, did not even want to pretend to be non-Jews, and never converted, even publicly.  They -- along with others who commited ANYTHING considered an abberation by the Inquisition -- being a Protestant, a Free-Thinker, a believer in abortion, etc -- were called ""Heretics"".  But the fact that she DIDN'T eat the pork shows Ines WAS telling the truth -- she just didn't like the taste!  Of course, then the Inquisition would have asked her how she knew about this -- and tortured her anyway.At any rate, Francisco Goya tells a friend of his, a prelate, about the problem, and asks him to try to intercede with the Church and bring Ines home.  The priest visits Ines in the dungeons of the Inquisition, and promises to bring home her message to her family that she loves them all.  At Ines' family's home, the priest explains that, since torture has already made Ines confess, he can do nothing.  Her father, however, has other plans.  He draws up a ""confession"" paper, wherein he asks the priest to sign, and reveal the ""terrible secret"" of the priest's past: that he, the priest, though masquerading as a human being, is actually the illegitmate son of a chimpanze and an orangatan!  The priest says he will never sign such a ridiculus document -- but, under the mildest of tortures, finally does.  Thus, he learns that the Inquistion's doctrine -- that an innocent person will never confess, no matter how awful the torture, (because God will give the innocent the strength to endure) -- is false.  But he cannot convince his superiours of his.  Ines stays in the dungeons.  And -- worse than this -- when the priest takes this message to Ines, he, struck by her beauty, does an entirely UN-priestly action.....(XXX)The story continues 15 years later.  Ines is still in prison.  Francisco Goya has gone deaf, and the priest has left his order, and is now a fugitive from the Inquision.  By this time, NAPOLEON has arrived in Spain!  The year is 1813, and it is only now thatthe victorious Napoleon abolishes the Inquistion, and frees the remaining prisoners of the Inquistion.  The Spanish Inquisition thus lasted for the astounding time-period of THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY- ONE YEARS! Although Ines and her family may be fictious characters, THIS historic timeline is all too sadly true.....Ines has had a daughter by the priest, and the film now shifts to Goya's efforts to bring mother and daughter together.  The priest re-enters the story, and .....well, it continues to show what happens to these involving, 3-D characters.This movie holds the attention from beginning to end.  The story is riviting, the acting involving, the scenery and costumes realistically magnificent, and magnificiently chilling.  The music is almost too atmospheric -- it is tuneful and evocative of every mood in the movie.....In the end, this is a story of how fanaticism can ruin lives.  One hope this sort of thing never happens again....  Although, withboth Moslem, Christian, (AND ""One World Order"") fanatics, very much alive, well, and all-too-active....as well as even Jewish groups urging Jews to be more religious, (and even seeking out converts among non-Jewish people!), the rational, realistic person still must sadly realize that fanaticism is still all-too-much around, in the hearts and minds of far too many people, even today.  GOYA'S GHOSTS, therefore, is a movie that deserves a far wider viewing audience.  Hopefully, upon watching it, many people will reach the same conclusion I have: Believe what you want, to make you happy.  But be sure to RESPECT other people and other beliefs. If one believes that God is Love, there can be no other way to direct one's thoughts!",5,H O R R I F Y I N G......B U T....A M A Z I N G....A N D....E D U C A T I O N A L...,1258934400,"11 23,

Goya was a painter during 18th century when many changes were taking place.  While inquisition had a stronghold in Spain, French Revolution was taking place in France.  In order to prevent further explosion of Jacobian ideas, British got involved in Portugal and Spain.  The fear, power strugle, monarchy, upper classes, lower classes and artistic freedoms all clash at once. As a bystander, Goya gets to experience is first hand thru people he paints and ineracts with.  We see the power of art as a means to show true state of society, humanity and beauty around us.  Natalie Portman gives wonderful performance as a young aristocrat girl who spends 15 years in jail of the church inquisition for refusing to eat pork.  In the process, she is impregnated by one of the priests and gives birth to a girl.

1101617,AMKZHBOK7VMQR,B000VHVT66,R. J. Marsella,"[0, 1]",I came away from watching this film with very mixed feelings. The film is stunning in period imagery and many of the performances are really outstanding. The plot is intriguing enough and there are several surprises along the way. The historical aspect of seeing Spain in the late inquisition followed by the French invasion and then the British marching up from Portugal to drive out Napoleon's troops is very well captured in a compressed timeline. Excellent costuming and atmospherics contribute to a highly entertaining period piece. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that for me the involvement and chance encounters of the main characters during these tumultuous events strained believability to the breaking point. While that distracted me while watching I still recognized the beauty of the film and admire the attempt to tell a truly fascinating historical tale through the eyes of a handful of people including of course Goya. Bardem is convincingly evil and self- interested. Portman in a dual role is very good.

1101618,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000VHVT66,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[13, 15]","Goya's Ghosts (Milos Forman, 2006)There was a time when I thought Milos Forman can do no wrong. That time is long past, alas, but I still at least attempt to watch everything the man releases. The fact that Javier Bardem had a major role in this one was added spice, since I also attempt to watch everything he releases. I was pretty much sold on Goya's Ghosts from the time I first heard about it, despite its getting almost no play in American theaters (hey, neither did William Friedkin's amazing Bug) and lukewarm-at-best critical reviews (if the critics can't find the greatness in Barbet Schroeder's Our Lady of the Assassins, what good are they anyway?). This time, however, I was wrong, and everyone else was right; Goya's Ghosts  is overlong, overslow, and despite an exceptionally juicy plot, overboring as well.The great Stellan Skarsgard, who seems to hamstring himself more often than not by finding the silliest roles he can, here stars as Goya, the icnonoclastic painter making his living by poking fun at Mother Church during the hottest days of the Inquisition. Despite his disfavor with the church, Brother Lorenzo (Bardem), an Inquisitor, commissions Goya for a portrait, giving Goya an ear in the church. Goya needs it when Ines (Natalie Portman), the daughter of a friend of Goya's, is arrested and thrown into the dungeon to be tortured. When Lorenzo's superiors refuse to release her, said friend (Jose Luis Gomez) arranges a dinner for Lorenzo with a nasty surprise attached. Fast-forward fifteen years; the Inquisition is in ruins, the French have invaded Spain, Goya is basically oblivious to everything around him after the trauma of that dinner party and its fallout, and Ines is still missing. Commence second half of movie, about which I can say nothing without major spoilers.Bardem, as usual, is the real centerpiece here. (I find it amusing that most reviews I've read overlook the obvious-- that he's a scheming, selfish beast-- and instead consider him to be a champion for whatever cause he happens to be espousing at any given time during the film.) The man can do no wrong, even when he ends up in a thoroughly awful film (e.g., Dios Contados). Skarsgard, on the other hand, often seems as if he's only as strong as the material he's working with-- brilliant in Insomnia, while ineffective and boring in The Glass House. He comes off as somewhat flat here when playing the flamboyant Goya, and I'll admit it does work well during the second half of the film, but during the first, there always seems to be something slightly wrong with his portrayal. Portman, as usual, is just gorgeous, but I'm still waiting for a performance from her anywhere near the caliber she showed in Leon; her work in the second half of this movie is as close as she's come to date, but is still a few notches below. Forman's career took a nosedive after Amadeus and hasn't yet righted itself (while it's a given that Valmont is a far, far better film than Dangerous Liaisons, let's face it, ten times nothing is still nothing); perhaps that's why this is only his fourth film in the past twenty years. And it's a decided improvement over his last one, the godawful Man on the Moon, but it's still more a curiosity than anything else. Recommended for hardcore fans of Javier Bardem; everyone else can ignore it. **",2,Meh.,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,3329,"['Goya', 'Ghosts', 'Milos', 'Forman', '2006', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'thought', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'time', 'long', 'past', 'alas', 'still', 'least', 'attempt', 'watch', 'everything', 'man', 'fact', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'had', 'major', 'role', 'one', 'was', 'added', 'spice', 'also', 'attempt', 'watch', 'everything', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'sold', 'Goya', 'Ghosts', 'time', 'first', 'heard', 'getting', 'almost', 'play', 'American', 'theaters', 'hey', 'did', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'amazing', 'Bug', 'lukewarm-at-best', 'critical', 'reviews', 'critics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'greatness', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'Lady', 'Assassins', 'what', 'good', 'are', 'anyway', 'time', 'however', 'was', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'right', 'Goya', 'Ghosts', 'overlong', 'overslow', 'exceptionally', 'juicy', 'plot', 'overboring', 'well.The', 'great', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', 'hamstring', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'finding', 'silliest', 'roles', 'can', 'here', 'Goya', 'icnonoclastic', 'painter', 'making', 'living', 'poking', 'fun', 'Mother', 'Church', 'hottest', 'days', 'Inquisition', 'disfavor', 'church', 'Brother', 'Lorenzo', 'Bardem', 'Inquisitor', 'commissions', 'Goya', 'portrait', 'giving', 'Goya', 'ear', 'church', 'Goya', 'when', 'Ines', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'daughter', 'friend', 'Goya', 'arrested', 'thrown', 'dungeon', 'be', 'tortured', 'When', 'Lorenzo', 'superiors', 'refuse', 'release', 'said', 'friend', 'Jose', 'Luis', 'Gomez', 'dinner', 'Lorenzo', 'nasty', 'surprise', 'attached', 'Fast-forward', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Inquisition', 'ruins', 'French', 'have', 'invaded', 'Spain', 'Goya', 'basically', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'around', 'trauma', 'dinner', 'party', 'fallout', 'Ines', 'still', 'missing', 'Commence', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'major', 'spoilers.Bardem', 'usual', 'real', 'centerpiece', 'here', 'find', 'amusing', 'most', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'obvious', 'scheming', 'selfish', 'beast', 'instead', 'consider', 'be', 'champion', 'cause', 'be', 'espousing', 'given', 'time', 'film', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'even', 'when', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'awful', 'film', 'e.g.', 'Dios', 'Contados', 'Skarsgard', 'other', 'hand', 'often', 'only', 'as', 'strong', 'material', 'working', 'brilliant', 'Insomnia', 'ineffective', 'boring', 'Glass', 'House', 'off', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'here', 'when', 'playing', 'flamboyant', 'Goya', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'work', 'well', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'first', 'always', 'be', 'something', 'slightly', 'wrong', 'portrayal', 'Portman', 'usual', 'just', 'gorgeous', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'performance', 'anywhere', 'caliber', 'showed', 'Leon', 'work', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'as', 'close', 'come', 'date', 'still', 'few', 'notches', 'Forman', 'career', 'took', 'nosedive', 'Amadeus', ""n't"", 'yet', 'righted', 'given', 'Valmont', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'let', 'face', 'times', 'nothing', 'still', 'nothing', 'perhaps', 'why', 'only', 'fourth', 'film', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'decided', 'improvement', 'last', 'one', 'godawful', 'Man', 'Moon', 'still', 'more', 'curiosity', 'anything', 'else', 'Recommended', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'everyone', 'else', 'can', 'ignore', '**']",Goya's Ghosts Natalie Portman ALL Regions PAL DVD Milos Forman
1101619,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000VHVT66,Robert J. Crawford,"[4, 5]","I was hoping for a historical snapshot like the one in Amadeus, which is unquestionably one of the best in spite of all its inaccuracies. Alas, while there are very strong moments, this film founders on its many TV-like simplifications of very complex events. That being said, the acting is excellent, in particular the sublimely beautiful Portman as Inez.The story is extremely novelesque: you have the artist and his muse as well as an outside authority that interferes. Inez is taken in by a revived Spanish Inquisition, which operates with frighteningly bizarre reasoning (if you are innocent, God will give you the strength to resist torture). Of course, this proves untrue, and Inez is consigned to heretics prison, while a monk ally must flee for his own forced confession. Goya is the recording eye for all of this, and the emotional center of the film. Upon the invasion of Napoleon's forces, we see the return of the characters after 15 years. Portman is magnificent as the ruined Inez, who has lost everything. The monk-turned revolutionary (Bardem) is also entirely believable as a chameleon-like survivor who remains much the same person in spite of his profound ideological transformation. It is very moving and full of very complex themes.Unfortunately, Forman tries to pack too much history into the story. For example, when Goya is attempting to convince a key character to come with him, it is at that precise moment that the French troops choose to intervene.

1101621,A3LY692S9YFLUH,B000VHVT66,Rodney J. Moss,"[1, 2]","Titles are usually a cue to what a film might elucidate. However, in Forman's most recent foray into C18th fin de siecle court life(Amadeus), neither Goya or his ghost amount to much. Indeed, Goya, who like most of the cast, looks the part, is very much an observer to the film's limply developed dramatic interest, conveyed by Javier and Postman and a cast of church and court characters. With respect to fidelity of appearance, the sets and costumes are exemplary, topped by Randy Quade as the mediocre King Charles(absolutely loved his cameo). The role of the church and the Question, as the Inquisition euphemistically refers to its mode of torture, is the film's real business. The highlight of its dreary passage comes when Javier is hoisted by the arms over the rich merchant's banquet table and given a taste of his own medicine. It's one of the few moments when we feel what mostly remains as spectacle. Goya's portrait of him is publicly burned as the Church denounces him. this coincides with the onset of Goya's deafness, an odd link -something that, of course, would need to be introduced in any bio-pic of the artist. though most accounts of Goya give significant leverage to this disease as a factor in his developing visual language, Forman does little with it. At this point, the priest's furtive laison with the the falsely accused, merchant's daughter(Portman) and his subsequent betrayal of the church, dominates the script. In swift succession Napoleon's troops invade Madrid, fifteen years transpire and Goya's voice-over explains his deafness. And the dramatic interest degenerates into a series of lifless set pieces. While war collateral, hospital, court and asylum scenes inspired actual Goya imagery(and we are given a credible demonstration of the etching technique) Forman's efforts never achieve  the clout of the Goyas'. Hollywood sentiment is writ large. the final scene is unforgivably saccharine. The intended interest in the relationship with flawed priest and femme fatale might have worked had some chemistry exist between them. Unfortunately Portman's acting lacks Javier's presence. If she is playing an historical figure of the  kind that lusty old Francisco might base a naked maja upon, this ain't the girl. Her scant effort to disguise an American accent detracts. The title might reasonably have suggested an exploration of events that lead to the peerless suite of dark paintings, now appropriately in a room of their own in the Prado. Given how Forman measured his imaginative abilities against Goya's, it's little wonder he has left the master's epiphanies untouched. Goya remains peripheral, the 'ghost' in a film purportedly about him.",2,A Ghost of a Goya,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2684,"['Titles', 'are', 'usually', 'cue', 'what', 'film', 'might', 'elucidate', 'However', 'Forman', 'most', 'recent', 'foray', 'C18th', 'fin', 'de', 'siecle', 'court', 'life', 'Amadeus', 'Goya', 'ghost', 'amount', 'much', 'Indeed', 'Goya', 'who', 'most', 'cast', 'part', 'very', 'much', 'observer', 'film', 'limply', 'developed', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'conveyed', 'Javier', 'Postman', 'cast', 'church', 'court', 'characters', 'respect', 'fidelity', 'appearance', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'exemplary', 'topped', 'Randy', 'Quade', 'mediocre', 'King', 'Charles', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'cameo', 'role', 'church', 'Question', 'Inquisition', 'euphemistically', 'mode', 'torture', 'film', 'real', 'business', 'highlight', 'dreary', 'passage', 'when', 'Javier', 'hoisted', 'arms', 'rich', 'merchant', 'banquet', 'table', 'given', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'one', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'feel', 'what', 'mostly', 'spectacle', 'Goya', 'portrait', 'publicly', 'burned', 'Church', 'onset', 'Goya', 'deafness', 'odd', 'link', '-something', 'course', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'introduced', 'bio-pic', 'artist', 'most', 'accounts', 'Goya', 'give', 'significant', 'leverage', 'disease', 'factor', 'developing', 'visual', 'language', 'Forman', 'little', 'point', 'priest', 'furtive', 'laison', 'falsely', 'accused', 'merchant', 'daughter', 'Portman', 'subsequent', 'betrayal', 'church', 'script', 'swift', 'succession', 'Napoleon', 'troops', 'invade', 'Madrid', 'fifteen', 'years', 'transpire', 'Goya', 'voice-over', 'deafness', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'series', 'lifless', 'set', 'pieces', 'war', 'collateral', 'hospital', 'court', 'asylum', 'scenes', 'inspired', 'actual', 'Goya', 'imagery', 'are', 'given', 'credible', 'demonstration', 'etching', 'technique', 'Forman', 'efforts', 'never', 'achieve', 'clout', 'Goyas', 'Hollywood', 'sentiment', 'writ', 'large', 'final', 'scene', 'unforgivably', 'saccharine', 'intended', 'interest', 'relationship', 'flawed', 'priest', 'femme', 'fatale', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'chemistry', 'exist', 'Unfortunately', 'Portman', 'acting', 'lacks', 'Javier', 'presence', 'playing', 'historical', 'figure', 'kind', 'old', 'Francisco', 'might', 'base', 'naked', 'maja', 'upon', 'ai', ""n't"", 'girl', 'scant', 'effort', 'disguise', 'American', 'accent', 'detracts', 'title', 'might', 'reasonably', 'have', 'suggested', 'exploration', 'events', 'lead', 'peerless', 'suite', 'dark', 'paintings', 'now', 'appropriately', 'room', 'own', 'Prado', 'Given', 'how', 'Forman', 'measured', 'imaginative', 'abilities', 'Goya', 'little', 'wonder', 'left', 'master', 'epiphanies', 'untouched', 'Goya', 'peripheral', ""'ghost"", 'film', 'purportedly']",Goya's Ghosts Natalie Portman ALL Regions PAL DVD Milos Forman

At that level the film didn't disappoint.  A young woman from a wealthy merchant family is arrested for the high crime of refusing suckling pig at a party.  She is put to ""The Question"", which is made all the more emphatic by her being stretched on the rack.  She doesn't know what her ""crime"" is, so she is unable to answer the question.  A few more turns of the screw and with a little help from the inquisitor, she finds that she must confess to being a secret Jew i.e. a New Christian, a converso, a secret Judaizer.  She's a devout Catholic but, a few more turns, and she confesses to a crime she knows nothing about.The girl's father knows that she has been called in for questioning by the Holy Office but doesn't know for what reason and doesn't know why she hasn't returned.  He invites one Father Lorenzo, a familiar of the Inquisition, to his home and learns the truth.  Lorenzo says he can't help because the girl has confessed and a confession, even under torture, is necessarily the truth.  The father and his servants seize Lorenzo and put him to ""The Question"" by stretching him from the ceiling.  Lorenzo's faith fails him and he confesses to being the bastard son of apes and admits, under torture, that he is attempting to subvert the Holy Office--the Inquisition.To me this was the high point of the film.  Afterwards things get muddled.  There's Lorenzo's fall from Grace and an invasion by the French.  There are atrocities and Lorenzo, who has fled to France and become a staunch Napoleon man, returns to lord it over his previous oppressors.  The French, in their turn, are defeated by the English and Spanish guerillas.  Lorenzo is captured and turned over to the newly reconstituted Inquisition.  In a contorted sense, Lorenzo is redeemed by refusal to recant his previous errors to save his own life.  Wearing the peaked hat and San Benito of a condemned heretic, he is garroted during an Auto de Fe in which hundreds cheer his death.Yes, Goya is featured during the film but only as a backdrop against which the Lorenzo story is played.

Lorenzo is now a Buornopartist and sends Inez to an asylum and searches through orphanages for his daughter Alice.He condemns the Inquisitor General to death.Goya discovers Alice working as a prostitute in a park and informs Lorenzo,who later gets prostitutes rounded up to be sent to America.Goya purchases Inez's freedom to reintroduce her to her daughter.Then English soldiers invade and drive out the French reinstituting the church.Lorenzo is captured,sentenced to death unless he repents.The 2nd part is bombastic and melodramatic,historical soap-opera,with the gap of 15 years. There are too many implausibilities: Lorenzo's rape of Inez in the dungeon,his conversion from Inquisitor priest to Republican revolutionary.All this is served up with a pot-pourri of English accents,with Spaniard Bardem's the most mannered.I did think it attempted a sweep of historical epic proportions,but lost its focus on character and narrative direction with too many changes and events.The cinematography is excellent,the rich painterly colouring and sumptuous set design. Skarsgard's Goya is a Candide-like observer,but is not given enough personality.His deafness is conveyed.Instead his satirical prints are used to tie things together.Bardem's Lorenzo is the central character,displaying charisma and intensity,without explaining his motivation.Portman was good in 3 roles as herself at different ages or as her daughter.The script by Carriere is patchy,bizarre and fails.This from a man who'd worked with Bunuel,whoidentified with Goya's sense of the absurd and worked with Forman before,makes the failure greater.The goal to depict an age never before filmed,showing it's evil,cruelty,irrationality and hysteria was in itself admirable.But let's get a proper film of Goya and his works.Clarke left Spanish art out of his 'Civilization' series.",3,Pot

HOWEVER, the story is so good, you can make yourself ignore the non-Spanish accents.It is an exceptionally beautiful time-period movie -- in the visual sense (costumes, scenery).It might not be so much a movie about Goya as it is a movie about the Spanish Inquisition ... and THAT will leave you breathless with how horrible religious persecution is.  It made me shake my head and think how did I ever even get here with what my ancestors, from wherever  they came from, had to survive!  Plagues! Wars! Religious Persecutions!  Ocean voyages!Back to Goya, the artist and the artist in this movie -- you will now understand his UGLY etchings and drawings.  He depicts the victims of the injustice and cruelty of his time.  How HE managed to survive after daring to paint kings UGLY ...  was he giving his own indictment of anti-monarchy / anti-clerics?Beautifully acted by ALL of the principal actors.THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT MOVIE. I'm giving it 5 Stars!  They do show Goya Art (just like the Van Gogh's in Lust for Life movie).Did you know that SMU in Dallas has the largest collection of Goya artwork outside of Spain?I bought the movie Used in Amazon.

Although I cant understand the title of the movie.  It had less to do with the artist Goya than with Bardems character of the priest.  I really think Bardem should have been cast in the role of a spanish painter than a scandinavian?  And it should have been more about the painter.  Bardem could have played that role to perfection.

I like historical films, and yes history isn't very pretty at times.  The Spanish Inquisition, as portrayed in this film, and the human suffering of innocent souls I found deeply disturbing.Not that the movie itself was poorly done in acting or cinematography, it was merely the story itself that broke my heart.  Natalie Portman's portrayal was wonderful, I will say that much. Your heart breaks for her suffering and her condition after 15 years of being cruelly tortured and locked up for turning away a pork dinner.I do not enjoy watching the ""dark side"" of humanity in centuries past, and the ignorance the church portrayed as messengers of a loving Christ by torturing individuals when ""put to the question.""

Fifteen years of torture and all she can do is shuffle her feet and stick out her lower jaw like she's packing a dip? I've seen more convincing portrayals of torture victims in community theater. And after 15 years of being imprisoned she'd barely aged!Also, it was ridiculous to cast Portman as both the mother and daughter (adding a mustache to the latter to differentiate the two didn't make it any more convincing).The script relies too much on coincidence to be believable.I love Spain.
