It is the story of a talented but undisciplined medical student from a lowly background who has an easy time in medical school but struggles to live up to the expectations of his teachers and fellow students. It has some interesting characters that are fairly well-developed through the course of the movie and it gives a good feel for what certain aspects of medical school must be like. There are the usual plot twists for a movie like this involving a number of personal struggles and obstacles for different characters to overcome and a few surprising turns of events. Because of the nature of what Gross Anatomy is, there are a few scenes that might be tough for squeamish viewers to watch, but if you like dramas from the 1980s or are interested in a film about medical school, you will probably enjoy this movie.",4,Fairly well-done,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,914,"['movie', 'fairly', 'standard', '80s', 'drama', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'story', 'talented', 'undisciplined', 'medical', 'student', 'lowly', 'background', 'who', 'easy', 'time', 'medical', 'school', 'struggles', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'teachers', 'fellow', 'students', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'well-developed', 'course', 'movie', 'good', 'feel', 'what', 'certain', 'aspects', 'medical', 'school', 'must', 'be', 'are', 'usual', 'plot', 'twists', 'movie', 'involving', 'number', 'personal', 'struggles', 'obstacles', 'different', 'characters', 'overcome', 'few', 'surprising', 'turns', 'events', 'nature', 'what', 'Gross', 'Anatomy', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'tough', 'squeamish', 'viewers', 'watch', 'like', 'dramas', '1980s', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'medical', 'school', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

Finally, I was able to watch it from start to finish for the first time. What particularly impressed me about the film was that how mature the film was in regards to the serious study of medicine. The viewers were taken through the arduous journey of medical students in terms of their studies. It gave them an idea how hard and difficult it was for many future doctors to be where they were. That's why I have a lot of respect for them. On the other hand, Gross Anatomy had nice human moments, especially the one with Joe and his female teacher. There were two negatives I have about Gross Anatomy. One was the romantic aspect between Joe and Laurie which I thought was a distraction. Not that I didn't mind, but the movie makers already had a compelling story to tell to render the aspect useless. Two was the brief in-look of the first year studies. I thought the story should have encompassed more years of medical school including residency to make things interesting. Then again, I should be reminded of the movie's title. All in all, Gross Anatomy was probably and still is to this day one of the rarest films about medical school studies.",4,A Pleasant Viewing Experience.,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1298,"['Viewed', '12/13Rate', '812/13', 'had', 'seen', 'Gross', 'Anatomy', 'clips', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'kept', 'getting', 'middle', 'whenever', 'flipped', 'channels', 'Finally', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'first', 'time', 'What', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'mature', 'film', 'was', 'regards', 'serious', 'study', 'medicine', 'viewers', 'were', 'taken', 'arduous', 'journey', 'medical', 'students', 'terms', 'studies', 'gave', 'idea', 'how', 'hard', 'difficult', 'was', 'many', 'future', 'doctors', 'be', 'where', 'were', 'why', 'have', 'lot', 'respect', 'other', 'hand', 'Gross', 'Anatomy', 'had', 'nice', 'human', 'moments', 'especially', 'one', 'Joe', 'female', 'teacher', 'were', 'two', 'negatives', 'have', 'Gross', 'Anatomy', 'One', 'was', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'Joe', 'Laurie', 'thought', 'was', 'distraction', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'makers', 'already', 'had', 'compelling', 'story', 'tell', 'render', 'aspect', 'useless', 'Two', 'was', 'brief', 'in-look', 'first', 'year', 'studies', 'thought', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'encompassed', 'more', 'years', 'medical', 'school', 'including', 'residency', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'Then', 'again', 'should', 'be', 'reminded', 'movie', 'title', 'Gross', 'Anatomy', 'was', 'probably', 'still', 'day', 'one', 'rarest', 'films', 'medical', 'school', 'studies']",N/A

I'll be starting medical school in a few months, myself, so I can't say that I'm any different.  That's what initially drew me to the movie, and maybe that's the reason why I liked it.This movie has Matthew Modine playing a first year medical student named Joe Slovak.  He's the antithesis of everything that a stereotypical med student is perceived to be.  He's laid back, worldly, handsome, and not especially self-serving.  At first I thought his character would be in the style of Robin Williams in ""Patch Adams"", where he'd end up being the rebel who believed that medicine lacked humanity and would lead a crusade to somehow change things for the better.  However, he doesn't really seem to care about people enough to make such a change.  While this apathetic lack of motivation might be realistic, it certainly doesn't make for a colorful character in a movie.  He is surrounded by four other med students who, as any movie about medical school would require, are all driven to excel and are vilified as a result.  The movie tells how these five people worked together to get through their first year in school.  All the typical elements are here: cut-throat competitiveness, jealousy, elitism, ways of dealing with stress, and of course, the obligatory subplot involving the budding romance between two lab partners.If you're thinking about going to medical school, don't use this movie to decide whether it's a good idea.  It won't sway your opinion in any particular direction.  However, aside from the way in which the characters are skewed, this movie will give you a good idea of what medical school might be like.  Though, if you're just looking for a movie to provide you with entertainment, this isn't what you want.  Go watch ""Patch Adams"" instead.  It's of the same genre, and it's better.

I am sure they took liberties like most movies and TV shows of the same or similar genres.  It is however a very well acted, funny at times, and even dramatic movie.  In some ways it was pretty typical of the movies back then.  Matthew Modine played the good natured, fun loving ""almost"" slacker perfectly.  He gets into med school on average grades and good test scores, and is initially more concerned with having fun until he turns it around.  They had the hot girl that he had to chase, the obnoxious foil, the friend that can't stand the pressure who all come together as a group to get through class.The standout performance to me was Christine Lahti, who played a great hard ass professor.  They definitely wanted to portray her as the tough teacher who cared (another great 80s movie cliche), and she did a great job with it.I remember thinking it was a great movie when I first saw it years ago, and it is definitely one of those that holds up well over time.  While I do not think it is the greatest movie of all time, it is very enjoyable and definitely worth the hour and a half or so your time.

704907,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B000068MBX,S. Morales,"[2, 2]","Gross Anatomy follows one year of new medical students who end up together in a lab group and deal with the tribulations of their stressful assignments and responsibilities in order to pass. Matthew Modine plays the somewhat stereotypical ""hotshot streetsmart bad boy"" with some hidden insecurities, and his love interest, fellow medical student Daphne Zuniga (of Spaceballs) plays a more serious headstrong type who somewhat disappointingly goes for Modine a little too fast and soon to be totally realistic.While the movie may be labeled as a Romantic Comedy, there honestly is not much comedy to be had in this film as it is not all that funny, nor does it really try to be. While the film mostly should be labeled a drama, there are few comedic influences as well as a vibe that almost promises a comedy but never really delivers, albeit a few scenes. No, this is mostly a fast-paced drama that at first feels as if it will not fare too well, except that during the second half of the film (and the cast's 2nd half year of medical school) tensions begin to arise, friction between lab partners and love interests as well as friction between students and professors.What makes this film work is that while the script is not too daring on comedy or memorable choreography or even dialogue, it doesn't ever really try to be, but seems more concerned with building characters, ones in which reveal themselves throughout the school year in forms of deeper insecurities and stresses. While the characters do try and keep a professional attitude at first, the tensions of medical school assignments soon begin to weigh them down, thus they end up depending on each other emotionally more than they originally thought they would need to. This builds a set of characters who may not be the funnest people in the world, but are in fact VERY REAL. And that is where the film strikes gold. Some characters do surprising things that end up getting a few either kicked out or quitting. One throughout the film can either very much relate to it; either by the tension of taking on such a difficult field of study or seeing characters become downright raw with one another - yet virtues such as forgiveness and grace play a tremendous part, thus the film does an excellent job of almost unconsciously exploring many degrees and angles of the human psyche and heart, showing that there is so much more to us depending on what situations we find ourselves in.I for one very much enjoyed the movie, not because it made me really laugh or cry or tense up, but because the characters felt more downright HUMAN than most movies I've regularly seen.",4,Surprise Sleeper Hit!,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,2630,"['Gross', 'Anatomy', 'one', 'year', 'new', 'medical', 'students', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'lab', 'group', 'deal', 'tribulations', 'stressful', 'assignments', 'responsibilities', 'order', 'pass', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'hotshot', 'streetsmart', 'bad', 'boy', 'hidden', 'insecurities', 'love', 'interest', 'fellow', 'medical', 'student', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'Spaceballs', 'more', 'serious', 'headstrong', 'type', 'who', 'somewhat', 'disappointingly', 'Modine', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'soon', 'be', 'totally', 'realistic.While', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'labeled', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'honestly', 'not', 'much', 'comedy', 'be', 'had', 'film', 'not', 'funny', 'really', 'try', 'be', 'film', 'mostly', 'should', 'be', 'labeled', 'drama', 'are', 'few', 'comedic', 'influences', 'as', 'well', 'vibe', 'almost', 'comedy', 'never', 'really', 'delivers', 'few', 'scenes', 'No', 'mostly', 'fast-paced', 'drama', 'first', 'feels', 'will', 'not', 'fare', 'too', 'well', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'cast', '2nd', 'half', 'year', 'medical', 'school', 'tensions', 'begin', 'arise', 'friction', 'lab', 'partners', 'love', 'interests', 'as', 'well', 'friction', 'students', 'professors.What', 'film', 'work', 'script', 'not', 'too', 'daring', 'comedy', 'memorable', 'choreography', 'even', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'try', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'building', 'characters', 'ones', 'reveal', 'school', 'year', 'forms', 'deeper', 'insecurities', 'stresses', 'characters', 'do', 'try', 'keep', 'professional', 'attitude', 'first', 'tensions', 'medical', 'school', 'assignments', 'soon', 'begin', 'weigh', 'down', 'thus', 'end', 'up', 'depending', 'other', 'emotionally', 'more', 'originally', 'thought', 'would', 'need', 'set', 'characters', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'funnest', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'fact', 'VERY', 'REAL', 'where', 'film', 'strikes', 'gold', 'characters', 'do', 'surprising', 'things', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'few', 'kicked', 'out', 'quitting', 'One', 'film', 'can', 'either', 'very', 'much', 'relate', 'tension', 'taking', 'difficult', 'field', 'study', 'seeing', 'characters', 'become', 'downright', 'raw', 'one', 'yet', 'virtues', 'such', 'forgiveness', 'grace', 'play', 'tremendous', 'part', 'thus', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'almost', 'unconsciously', 'exploring', 'many', 'degrees', 'angles', 'human', 'psyche', 'heart', 'showing', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'depending', 'what', 'situations', 'find', 'in.I', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'really', 'laugh', 'cry', 'tense', 'up', 'characters', 'felt', 'more', 'downright', 'HUMAN', 'most', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'regularly', 'seen']",N/A
