He begins working for the boss (Akim Tamiroff) as a collector of payoff money, and is then pushed into politics. Eventually he gets himself elected mayor and then governor; but then he has a turn of heart and decides to cut out the graft and go straight. Of course, this doesn't wash and he is forced to flee the country for South America (where he tells his story in flashbacks) or face jail time in the States. It would take Sturges a couple of pictures to really hit his stride - he seems restrained here where later he would let it all hang out - but it's a terrific comedy anyway.

241064,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6300987493,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","Once again, Brian Donlevy (""Dan McGinty"") provides pretty good entertainment. He isn't one of the more famous actors of the classic era but he did his share of good films and good performances. This certainly ranks among his best.Donlevy, fellow actor Akim Tamiroff and director Preston Sturges all combine for a good movie All of that makes it a surprise there are so reviews of this film on this website.The story of McGinty and his wife ""Catherine"" (Murel Angelus) also turns out to be nice with a unique twist to the relationship.To be fair, however, I have to admit I liked this far more on the first viewing. When I looked it at 6 years later after watching thousands of other classic films, this just didn't come across as that strong. The first thirty 30 minutes was good with some snappy dialog but then it bogged down with that marriage-for-convenience angle and the politics got really sappy. So beware: you might really enjoy this, or you might find it really stupid. It could go either way, but if you are classic movie fan, you should consider checking this film out.",3,Donlevy Was An Underrated Actor,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,1081,"['Once', 'again', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'Dan', 'McGinty', 'pretty', 'good', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'one', 'more', 'famous', 'actors', 'classic', 'era', 'did', 'share', 'good', 'films', 'good', 'performances', 'certainly', 'best.Donlevy', 'fellow', 'actor', 'Akim', 'Tamiroff', 'director', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'combine', 'good', 'movie', 'surprise', 'are', 'so', 'reviews', 'film', 'website.The', 'story', 'McGinty', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Murel', 'Angelus', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'nice', 'unique', 'twist', 'relationship.To', 'be', 'fair', 'however', 'have', 'admit', 'liked', 'far', 'more', 'first', 'viewing', 'When', 'looked', '6', 'years', 'later', 'watching', 'thousands', 'other', 'classic', 'films', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'strong', 'first', 'thirty', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'good', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'then', 'bogged', 'down', 'marriage-for-convenience', 'angle', 'politics', 'got', 'really', 'sappy', 'beware', 'might', 'really', 'enjoy', 'might', 'find', 'really', 'stupid', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'are', 'classic', 'movie', 'fan', 'should', 'consider', 'checking', 'film', 'out']",Great Mcginty VHS
241065,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6300987493,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[8, 8]","After writing several sucessful Hollywood scripts, hotshot Preston Sturges took his first crack at directing, in this crisp, typically cynical, intelligent 1940 debut. The Great McGinty is one Dan McGinty, a down-and-out, yet tough-as-nails tramp who finds opportunity handed to him on a silver platter when a the boss of a big political machine sees McGinty's potential, and taps him to be one of his many henchmen in a statewide graft ring. Affable, savvy, and ruthlessly ambitious, McGinty rises to the top, eventually riding into the governor's office on a hypocritically-fashioned ""reform"" ticket. Naturally, a woman softens him up, and brings his downfall. As usual, it's difficult not to compare Sturges with the equally populist director, Frank Capra, especially as the plot of this film closely mirrors that of Capra's ""Meet John Joe,"" and other Capra films. How do they stack up? Well, Sturges's story is in certain regards darker, in others less harrowing. His bum-made-reformed-conman starts way more corrupt, and never really softenss to the degree a Capra hero would... He finds his moral center, but not his actual salvation, and the film doesn't have what you'd exactly call a ""happy ending,"" at least not for the hero himself. Other elements are similar, though, particularly in the skillful use of supporting character actors. Particularly appealling here are Akim Tamiroff as the political boss and William Demarest as the stooge who first recruits McGinty. Brian Donlevy, as McGinty, is adequate, but hardly as appealing as some of the actors Sturges would work with later on. Still, a nice example of the Sturges formula at work.",4,Preston Sturges' directorial debut,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,1650,"['writing', 'several', 'sucessful', 'Hollywood', 'scripts', 'hotshot', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'took', 'first', 'crack', 'directing', 'crisp', 'typically', 'cynical', 'intelligent', '1940', 'debut', 'Great', 'McGinty', 'one', 'Dan', 'McGinty', 'down-and-out', 'yet', 'tough-as-nails', 'tramp', 'who', 'opportunity', 'handed', 'silver', 'platter', 'when', 'boss', 'big', 'political', 'machine', 'McGinty', 'potential', 'be', 'one', 'many', 'henchmen', 'statewide', 'graft', 'ring', 'Affable', 'savvy', 'ruthlessly', 'ambitious', 'McGinty', 'top', 'eventually', 'riding', 'governor', 'office', 'hypocritically-fashioned', 'reform', 'ticket', 'Naturally', 'woman', 'up', 'downfall', 'usual', 'difficult', 'not', 'compare', 'Sturges', 'equally', 'populist', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'especially', 'plot', 'film', 'closely', 'mirrors', 'Capra', 'Meet', 'John', 'Joe', 'other', 'Capra', 'films', 'How', 'do', 'stack', 'up', 'Well', 'Sturges', 'story', 'certain', 'regards', 'darker', 'others', 'less', 'harrowing', 'bum-made-reformed-conman', 'starts', 'way', 'more', 'corrupt', 'never', 'really', 'softenss', 'degree', 'Capra', 'hero', 'would', 'moral', 'center', 'not', 'actual', 'salvation', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', ""'d"", 'exactly', 'call', 'happy', 'ending', 'least', 'not', 'hero', 'Other', 'elements', 'are', 'similar', 'though', 'particularly', 'skillful', 'use', 'supporting', 'character', 'actors', 'Particularly', 'appealling', 'here', 'are', 'Akim', 'Tamiroff', 'political', 'boss', 'William', 'Demarest', 'stooge', 'who', 'recruits', 'McGinty', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'McGinty', 'adequate', 'hardly', 'as', 'appealing', 'actors', 'Sturges', 'would', 'work', 'later', 'Still', 'nice', 'example', 'Sturges', 'formula', 'work']",Great Mcginty VHS
241066,A3L31489BCB1D7,6300987493,El Kabong,"[7, 9]","Stunned to see no reviews for this brilliantly funny movie. The conventional wisdom on McGINTY is that it's lesser Sturges, more important as his directorial debut (one he did for next to nothing just to get the shot) than as a standalone comedy. Pish and tosh. This is a supremely satisfying comedy and had it been Sturges' only directing credit, would still mark him as a filmmaker to remember. (And, no, that's not a subtle swipe at his others, merely a defense of this too-often overlooked movie.)Maybe the best asset of McGINTY is its budget constraint, which steered Sturges towards the 'ensemble' casting which would become one of his hallmarks. The movie is filled stem to stern with sharp-eyed turns by primarily supporting players (including the leads, Donlevy &amp; Tamiroff, who are excellent). What I can't help but notice is how the Sturges films of the 40s are really the last gasp of the great breakneck comedies of the pre-Code 30s, just prior to the 'screwball' era, when Hollywood was still allowed to poke fun at people/institutions/conventions of the Real World. In fact, McGINTY -with only minor casting changes- would have fit right in with the Warner Bros/First National bumper crop of fast, cynical comedies of '31-'34. (And, by the way, Tamiroff's cheerfully corrupt and malapropping Boss would be paid hilarious homage 20+ years later in animation form as Boris Badinov in Jay Ward's ROCKY &amp; BULLWINKLE cartoons.) The love interest of Muriel Angelus, and adjoining subplot, may come off a bit treacly, but Sturges was canny enough to make this studio-mandated mawkishness an integral part of the plot...even as early as 1940, he was subverting True Love to his devilishly satiric purposes! So stop nitpicking and thoroughly enjoy one of the great American comedies, brought to unforgettable life by that great if unrecognized repertory company, The Sturges Players (featuring, among others, Wm Demarest, Thurston Hall &amp; Arthur Hoyt).",5,Looks like the suit got YOU!,954720000,"04 3, 2000",2000,1968,"['Stunned', 'see', 'reviews', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'movie', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'McGINTY', 'lesser', 'Sturges', 'more', 'important', 'directorial', 'debut', 'one', 'did', 'next', 'nothing', 'just', 'get', 'shot', 'standalone', 'comedy', 'Pish', 'tosh', 'supremely', 'satisfying', 'comedy', 'had', 'been', 'Sturges', 'only', 'directing', 'credit', 'would', 'still', 'mark', 'filmmaker', 'remember', 'not', 'subtle', 'swipe', 'others', 'merely', 'defense', 'too-often', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'best', 'asset', 'McGINTY', 'budget', 'constraint', 'steered', 'Sturges', ""'ensemble"", 'casting', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'hallmarks', 'movie', 'filled', 'stem', 'stern', 'sharp-eyed', 'turns', 'primarily', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'leads', 'Donlevy', 'amp', 'Tamiroff', 'who', 'are', 'excellent', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'how', 'Sturges', 'films', '40s', 'are', 'really', 'last', 'gasp', 'great', 'breakneck', 'comedies', 'pre-Code', '30s', 'just', 'prior', ""'screwball"", 'era', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'still', 'allowed', 'poke', 'fun', 'people/institutions/conventions', 'Real', 'World', 'fact', 'McGINTY', '-with', 'only', 'minor', 'casting', 'changes-', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'right', 'Warner', 'Bros/First', 'National', 'crop', 'fast', 'cynical', 'comedies', ""'31-'34"", 'way', 'Tamiroff', 'cheerfully', 'corrupt', 'malapropping', 'Boss', 'would', 'be', 'paid', 'hilarious', 'homage', '20+', 'years', 'later', 'animation', 'form', 'Boris', 'Badinov', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'ROCKY', 'amp', 'BULLWINKLE', 'cartoons', 'love', 'interest', 'Muriel', 'Angelus', 'adjoining', 'subplot', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'bit', 'treacly', 'Sturges', 'was', 'canny', 'enough', 'make', 'studio-mandated', 'mawkishness', 'integral', 'part', 'plot', 'even', 'as', 'early', '1940', 'was', 'subverting', 'True', 'Love', 'devilishly', 'satiric', 'purposes', 'So', 'stop', 'nitpicking', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'comedies', 'brought', 'unforgettable', 'life', 'great', 'unrecognized', 'repertory', 'company', 'Sturges', 'Players', 'featuring', 'others', 'Wm', 'Demarest', 'Thurston', 'Hall', 'amp', 'Arthur', 'Hoyt']",Great Mcginty VHS
