The minute I saw the second season of ""DaVinci's Inquest"" was available, I bought it.  I've no idea how it is possible, but this series just gets better every season.  The mixture of humor, pathos, mystery and drama is perfection.  The only flaw I've seen in either season is the attempt to make DaVinci's mother seem more Italian than she is.  I can't tell whether the problem lies with the actress or the director, but when she uses an Italian phrase, it comes off as clumsy and amateurish.  This character doesn't spend more than 15"" on the screen in all the episodes together, and that's a good thing.Season 2's episode of ""Sister's Light"" will break your heart and is flawless, as are most of the episodes.  In the first season, the writing had Leo (Donnelly Rhodes) as an irritating grump, but by the second season, they figured out what to do with him and his gruff humor, sadness of a husband with a wife losing her mind - fit the character beautifully.You know when he comes on the screen he will either make you laugh or break your heart.Wish I knew how to reach the team that put this series together and ask them why they don't just put the entire set on sale?  I didn't find this series until just before it was shot down by CBC, so was at the mercy of the commercials/reruns until the first two seasons came available on DVD.I'd like to comment on CBC and their treatment of this team, as evidenced by what they are currently doing to ""Intelligence"", but that's another show and a separate issue.  When Canadians find something as perfect as ""DaVinci"" and ""Intelligence"", they have systematically sabotaged them for what I call milk-toast shows that I wouldn't turn the TV on for. If any of you want to catch DaVinci reruns, they are currently in the first season on ABC, Monday mornings, at about 12:04 a.m.  CBC stopped the reruns years ago but ABC is putting it through a second set of re-runs.Set your VCR and watch the magic happen.Come on, Mr. Haddock - get ALL your shows on DVD.  It would be a crime to bury them in rerun land, chopped up and butchered.  You wrote a series that matches or tops most everything American.  Make your programs available for your fans to view and enjoy over the years.Just because CBC didn't know what they had, doesn't mean the people  don't appreciate your shows, the actors and the amazing writing.",5,A SERIES FOR ALL SEASONS,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,2481,"[""'m"", 'American', 'fortunate', 'be', 'able', 'receive', 'CBC', 'When', 'see', 'Chris', 'Haddock', 'name', 'anything', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'quality', 'minute', 'saw', 'second', 'season', 'DaVinci', 'Inquest', 'was', 'available', 'bought', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'how', 'possible', 'series', 'just', 'better', 'season', 'mixture', 'humor', 'pathos', 'mystery', 'drama', 'perfection', 'only', 'flaw', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'season', 'attempt', 'make', 'DaVinci', 'mother', 'seem', 'more', 'Italian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'problem', 'actress', 'director', 'when', 'Italian', 'phrase', 'off', 'clumsy', 'amateurish', 'character', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', '15', 'screen', 'episodes', 'together', 'good', 'thing.Season', '2', 'episode', 'Sister', 'Light', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'flawless', 'are', 'most', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'writing', 'had', 'Leo', 'Donnelly', 'Rhodes', 'irritating', 'grump', 'second', 'season', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'gruff', 'humor', 'sadness', 'husband', 'wife', 'losing', 'mind', 'fit', 'character', 'beautifully.You', 'know', 'when', 'screen', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'break', 'heart.Wish', 'knew', 'how', 'reach', 'team', 'put', 'series', 'together', 'ask', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'put', 'entire', 'set', 'sale', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'series', 'just', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'CBC', 'so', 'was', 'mercy', 'commercials/reruns', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'came', 'available', 'DVD.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'comment', 'CBC', 'treatment', 'team', 'evidenced', 'what', 'are', 'currently', 'doing', 'Intelligence', 'show', 'separate', 'issue', 'When', 'Canadians', 'find', 'something', 'as', 'perfect', 'DaVinci', 'Intelligence', 'have', 'systematically', 'sabotaged', 'what', 'call', 'milk-toast', 'shows', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'TV', 'want', 'catch', 'DaVinci', 'reruns', 'are', 'currently', 'first', 'season', 'ABC', 'Monday', 'mornings', 'about', '12:04', 'a.m.', 'CBC', 'stopped', 'reruns', 'years', 'ago', 'ABC', 'putting', 'second', 'set', 're-runs.Set', 'VCR', 'watch', 'magic', 'happen.Come', 'Mr.', 'Haddock', 'get', 'shows', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'bury', 'rerun', 'land', 'chopped', 'up', 'butchered', 'wrote', 'series', 'most', 'everything', 'American', 'Make', 'programs', 'available', 'fans', 'view', 'enjoy', 'years.Just', 'CBC', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'had', ""n't"", 'mean', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'shows', 'actors', 'amazing', 'writing']",Da Vinci's Inquest - Season 2

1078795,A1PO24RPVBV09N,B000R349JS,Puppluv,"[1, 2]","I got hooked on this after the first episode - called the parents and they got hooked too.-then it was gone.This aired a couple times in the US and switched to late night where it aired out of order all over the time slots-even daytime.  I'm so sad that there are only three seasons released on DVD and that it was ever cancelled at all.  At least if it was still running in Canada I would hold out hope that there are more releases to come.  Bravo to Canada for airing it for 6? years but where's the rest of the series?  What about Davinci's City Hall?Since there are some really terrific shows that come out of Canada I would have thought that they had more sense than the US TV producers and networks.  Our networks seem to re-arrange and cancel shows willy-nilly-with what appears to be corrupt ratings systems and shows that get juggled to the point that they are hopeless or cancelled after two or three airings.  Unfortunately, the really great shows from Canada that I have bought on DVD (didn't know they were Canadian at the time but have recently realized the common factor in some of the great crime shows of recent is that they are Canadian) - but they've all been cancelled already and none have all season released on DVD.  Apparently it's no different in Canada than here - the quality of the show means nothing-in fact, the better it is, the sooner it goes.

1078796,AY7YN8E6NFY94,B000R349JS,"Richard C. Geschke ""In search of History!!""","[1, 2]","With the further development of subplots, Da Vinci's Inquest's second season is aging like a fine wine.  Led by Actors Nicholas Campbell and Donnelly Rhodes, this fast pace gritty narrative set in Vancouver B.C. continues to impress its faithful following.As stated in my review of Season I, all the characters are delightfully flawed and all contribute to a riveting and believable fast paced Police drama.  As in the first season the plots are not predictable, you never really know what's coming up next.  In many ways it's much better than the standard "" who done it"" scenario.  The interplay dialogue between characters is both biting and caustic.  This language scenario adds to the realism of this incredible Police drama.Look for the last two episodes to chill the back of your spine.  Matt Fewer plays a chilling and unstable serial killer that makes Norman Bates look like Theodore Cleaver.  As in all of Da Vinci's seasons they are limited to 13 episodes.  Unlike the set normal TV Series in the USA which is normally 22 episodes, you will only see the limited 13 shows.  So you'll have to savor each episode in the short season.This fast paced series is absolutely the best of its genre.  7 Stars!
