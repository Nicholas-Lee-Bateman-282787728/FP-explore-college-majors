390174,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303934668,Byron Kolln,"[15, 15]","HEARTBEAT is a delightful film from RKO, which stars Ginger Rogers.  She plays an escaped reform-school girl called Arlette Lafon, who becomes a pupil in Professor Aristide's (Basil Rathbone) school for petty crime.  Arlette is a reluctant pupil but soon shows much promise in the art of pocket-picking.  One day whilst trying to steal the tie-pin of an ambassador (Adolphe Menjou), she is thrown into a scheme to unmask a debonair young politician called Pierre la Roche (Jean-Pierre Aumont).  Complications arise when Arlette and Pierre begin to fall in love, but what will happen when he discovers her criminal associations?Ginger Rogers is the angel on top of the Christmas-tree in this delightful screwball comedy. True, perhaps the film might have been enhanced by having a European actress playing Arlette (Danielle Darrieux and Simone Simon come to mind), but Rogers is so lovely here it's hard to imagine the film being better without her.  Jean-Pierre Aumont is a capable partner; Menjou and Rathbone are wonderful as the metaphorical puppeteers manipulating Rogers.Alpha's DVD has a watchable print.  For the most part, the picture is sharp and well-defined, with varying degrees of dirt and debris throughout the film.

On her very first mission she gets caught and then finds herself posing as a rich man's niece at the embassy ball.  Naturally, the fellow she's supposed to entrance is charming and handsome and love ensues.  However, there are several class hurdles to overcome and misunderstanding to overcome in the process as well.  Ginger Rogers, although not her youngest in this film, nonetheless pulls off the role admirably.  And the movie is quite simply an excellent one.

Rogers plays a young run-away, desperately turning to crime to survive the streets of Paris. Basil Rathbone is the owner and operator of a rather unique school for pickpockets she unwittingly stumbles upon.After receiving some prelimanary training on the art of theft Rogers is sent out into Paris to repay Rathbone's investment. Things get compilcated though as she is caught trying to lift a man's tie-pin on her very first day. Instead of turning her in to the police, the man comissions her to make a lift at a high society ball. Her mark turns out to be a handsome French Diplomat, and the plot then follows their various misadventures as they fight, argue, and fall in love.Jean Pierre, playing the diplomat, has great chemistry with Rogers, and we get to see the great Basil Rathbone as head master at a school for pickpockets. The plot manages to stay surprising, and the dialogue is above average. Rogers (in a rare non-dancing role) is very charming and handles the comedy well. All in all, a well made film perfect for old-movie lovers.

She is lively, funny, and virtuous. Her morality makes her an obvious misfit for what will take place. Leaving reform school, Arlette joins a French pickpocket class headed by a very animated Professor Aristide (Basil Rathbone of Sherlock Holmes fame) to have room and board. With natural acting ability, she becomes a star pupil despite her desire to be honest. Unhappy with the thought of stealing, she contemplates returning to reform school. A befriended pickpocket classmate convinces her that entering a ""white marriage"" of convenience would prevent her from that unpleasant destiny. All she needs is money to pay for the arrangement. With such a noble goal in mind, she sets out for the French public with her newly learned craft.The temporary success of her first heist leads to a guilty conscious and indebted service to an ambassador at a fancy ball where she meets young French diplomat Pierre La Roche (Jean Pierre Aumont) under false pretenses. After confessing her sins and goals to him, she expects him to marry her. Arlette and Pierre are obviously attracted to each other. However, he decides to sponsor a deadbeat to fill the husbandly role so as not to sully his diplomatic reputation. As she plays along with his stubbornness, Pierre's feelings grow even stronger. She even belts out a love song in a swimsuit to allure Pierre's affection. Whoever gets Arlette in the end is truly the winner.The funny HEARTBEAT story and invigorated acting compensate for the poor B+W image quality of the DVD and the unconvincing 18-year-old claim. There are no extras but for the low price (especially when purchased used), it's an entertaining way to spend 100 minutes multiple times.Movie quote: ""Steal to stay honest?
