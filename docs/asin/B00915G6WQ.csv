It lost so much of it's edge and originality that made this show so special. But season seven has just saved it. I heard that eight might be the last, if so I will be saddened. The season actually has about 4 major plot lines. The first is Debra's realization of Dexter's alter ego, The Bay Harbor Butcher and how she must deal with and eventually accept it. Especially since she just discovered she's in love with him. The second is Isaak, a Ukrainian mob boss whose gay lover just happened to land on Dexter's table, enter serial killer #1. The third plot line is Hanna, a poisoner who becomes Dexter's first true love. And the final major plot is LaGuerta putting the pieces together and too realizing that Dexter's the real Butcher not Doakes. I just finished the last episode and the final five minutes kept me on my toes. When she pulled the trigger, I damn near fell out of of my chair.

1583597,APOJGLIZTNQ3K,B00915G6WQ,Apollo,"[0, 0]","CONTAINS SPOILERS, ASSUMES YOU HAVE SEEN SEASONS 1-6, IS A LITTLE LONG, AND DISSES CSI!Well, we recently watched S7 over the course of 3 nights.....we don't know about most viewers but Dexter is one of only a few shows that we simply cannot watch 'old school' (ie. 1 episode per week!?  Just can't do it!!).  After what was easily the worst season last season, despite the excellent cliffhanger and the regrettably brief period Mos Def was a part of the show, we had fears that Dexter may be sputtering to its close in season 8.  Thankfully, S7 is probably our favourite since the first 2 and may be a contender for best season to date.  Many reviewers seem to have been disappointed with S5 (some specifically negative of Julia Stiles; not quite sure what the problem was there, she was great).  What WAS an issue in S5 & 6 was the writing that tended to treat the fans like cretins (something we refer to as CSI writing; when something is needlessly explained multiple times in case you were too dim to get it the first time!).  This is fine for mediocre shows like CSI, NCIS, and the rest (and if you think those shows are well written then a level of contempt is probably justified), but this is not good for a supposedly intelligent show like Dexter (eg. a character refers to Rudy and then another character says the ice truck killer or Dexter's internal monologue says 'my brother'.  We are fans of the show.....we KNOW Rudy is the ice truck killer and is Dexter's brother......please stop treating us like morons.....there are plenty of shows that do that already.  S7 is almost completely devoid of this and we are forever grateful.We always knew that if this show lasted a number of seasons that eventually the story line would turn to the prospect of Dexter being in a situation that he will kill (or contemplate killing) an innocent, either by mistake or to protect himself (and by doing this you risk alienating the core reason for why this show is so special....you're rooting for the serial killer!  But how can you continue to do so if he kills the innocent!?).  This prospect isn't new to the show as it happened with Doakes in the first 2 seasons but with S7 it went to a place that will make it impossible for the show to have a happy ending.....and if the writers are true to the Deb character.....it's an act that she would never forgive herself for.  As much as we want to see the last season.....we also don't!The significant pro's for S7 were the introduction of the Stevenson and Strahovski characters (not bad considering Ray's acting is generally a little stiff and we're not big fans) but with even more focus on the 2 main characters of Dexter & Deb it is no surprise that this was a much improved season.  As good as Michael is as Dexter, Jennifer is absolutely astonishing; and their performances and chemistry are the shows greatest strength....and is there an actress in TV today that can do 'emotion' better than Jennifer!?Possible story developments for the last season?  Quinn getting set up for the murder of Maria (assuming Maria IS dead) since he's a dodgy cop anyway and did have it out for Dexter at one point; Sonya comes back? (unlikely, but we always thought the Irish nanny was too good to be true and was going to be a problem for Dexter); the best season yet for Angel Batista?  Hasn't had a lot to do over the last couple of seasons, was looking like getting written out for season 8 but now has almost been given the greatest reason to be a focal point of the last season.....delay retirement to hunt for Maria's killer (assuming Maria IS dead....sorry for CSI-ing that!); Strahovski's gotta be a big part of it you'd think.Dexter is truly a wonderful show with a great cast of almost universally likeable characters and isn't that what brings you back for more!?......Boardwalk Empire is likely a better show (technically) but who do you care about or root for!?  Here's to a final season that will leave fans satisfied although those expecting a happy finale are gonna be outta luck we think.Can't wait for 8.....and please don't CSI the writing......and thanks to everyone involved with bringing the show to the screen and for the fans big enough in number to allow it to run for as long as it has.....it is very much appreciated.Happy viewing!PS : shame it was shot on digital and more Vince, please!!",4,A return to form,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,4354,"['CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'ASSUMES', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'SEEN', 'SEASONS', '1-6', 'LITTLE', 'LONG', 'AND',

My wife and I have been big ""Dexter"" fans for several years, but Season Seven was really a chore to get through. The stories and character motivations seem strained, the plot devices spawned many unlikely, impractical scenarios, and numerous characters (not just Dexter) pursued courses of action that seemed improbable and ill-advised. Deb, in particular. The emergence of yet another love interest for Dexter held its share of tedium, as well as potential psychological angles that could have been better explored... Numerous supporting characters were thrust into situations that weren't that involving and in general the show seems to be going through the motions, occasionally peppering the landscape with HBO-style sex and gore to keep viewers titillated. Or so they think: it's starting to get old.One bright spot, and I mean a HUGE positive for this season was Irish actor Ray Stevenson who was AMAZING as the bad guy Isaak Sirko.  Stevenson, who previously played the soldier Titus Pullo in HBO's ""Rome,"" is intensely magnetic and subtle, and steals every scene he's in. Our recommendation: cast this guy as James Bond. Immediately. In the meantime, this was a great performance, and one of the only real highlights to what was otherwise a rather sluggish, repetitive season of ""Dexter."" I guess Season Eight is the series finale... hopefully they are renewing their creative juices to make that final season a real winner.

Martin,"[4, 4]","Dexter has generated so much good will during its first five seasons, that it's easy to overlook the shortcomings of last season as well as this most recent one since we're so invested in how things are going to end for everyone's favorite serial killer.  And let's face it, season 7 has a lion's share of flaws to forgive.  The writing is inconsistent and lazy at times, there are too many uninvolving plot lines, way too much padding in terms of the story lines of the supporting players and the whole season feels like it is about twice as long as it needs to be.  Thankfully Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter continue to give excellent performances in this penultimate season.The action picks up following the bombshell that ended season 6.  Debra witnessed Dexter murdering one of his victims thus opening up a fascinating new venues for the series to explore.  Unfortunately, not enough time is devoted to the quandry of how Dexter and Debra can reconcile the dark passenger with their complicated relationship.  The best moments of season 7 focus on Debra's conflict over her response to Dexter's secret and the residual effects it has on her physically and emotionally.  The rest of the time the show spins its wheels with underwhelming storylines such as the romance between Dexter and a fellow murderer, Quinn's involvement with a stripper, Bautista's retirement, and a serial killer who hunts down his victims in homemade mazes.  One saving grace is the dynamic that is explored between Dexter and a Ukranian mob boss who start out as enemies but come to respect and understand one another.Thankfully, the season ends with a bang and puts things in motion for the eight and final season which will ultimately reveal Dexter's fate.  Will his humanity win out over his dark passenger?  Can he ever be forgiven for his actions?  Should he be?  Will he lose everything that he holds dear?  These are the fascinating questions that I'm look forward to mulling over and they are what make the show worth sticking with until the end.",3,Limping to the finish line?,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,2042,"['Dexter', 'generated', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'will', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'easy', 'overlook', 'shortcomings', 'last', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'recent', 'one', ""'re"", 'so', 'invested', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'serial', 'killer', 'let', 'face', 'season', '7', 'lion', 'share', 'flaws', 'forgive', 'writing', 'inconsistent', 'lazy', 'times', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'uninvolving', 'plot', 'lines', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'padding', 'terms', 'story', 'lines', 'supporting', 'players', 'whole', 'season', 'feels', 'about', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'be', 'Thankfully', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'continue', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'penultimate', 'action', 'up', 'following', 'bombshell', 'ended', 'season', '6', 'Debra', 'witnessed', 'Dexter', 'murdering', 'one', 'victims', 'thus', 'opening', 'up', 'fascinating', 'new', 'venues', 'series', 'explore', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'devoted', 'quandry', 'how', 'Dexter', 'Debra', 'can', 'reconcile', 'dark', 'passenger', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'best', 'moments', 'season', '7', 'focus', 'Debra', 'conflict', 'response', 'Dexter', 'secret', 'residual', 'effects', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'rest', 'time', 'show', 'wheels', 'underwhelming', 'storylines', 'such', 'romance', 'Dexter', 'fellow', 'murderer', 'Quinn', 'involvement', 'stripper', 'Bautista', 'retirement', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'down', 'victims', 'homemade', 'mazes', 'One', 'saving', 'grace', 'dynamic', 'explored', 'Dexter', 'Ukranian', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'start', 'out', 'enemies', 'come', 'respect', 'understand', 'one', 'another.Thankfully', 'season', 'bang', 'things', 'motion', 'eight', 'final', 'season', 'will', 'ultimately', 'reveal', 'Dexter', 'fate', 'Will', 'humanity', 'win', 'out', 'dark', 'passenger', 'Can', 'ever', 'be', 'forgiven', 'actions', 'Should', 'be', 'Will', 'lose', 'everything', 'dear', 'are', 'fascinating', 'questions', ""'m"", 'look', 'forward', 'mulling', 'over', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'show', 'sticking', 'end']",Dexter: Season 7

1583636,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B00915G6WQ,D. C. Obraztsov,"[1, 4]","SPOILER-FREEAfter last year's somewhat abysmal season and painfully unfair cliffhanger finale, season 7 (the one before the last!) really picks up.  There's a lot of good 'ol fashioned Dexter drama, and while there was plenty of over attention to guest star storylines while neglecting the main cast (like always!), the best part of this season is how the relationship between Dexter and Debra is really explored.  Debra has to deal with a LOT of emotions from what she witnessed in the season six finale, and this season is very Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall focused (Debra and Dexter Morgan), which is a GREAT thing for this show.DEBRA/DEXTER - hands down, the interactions between the two are the best moments of the season.  They're better than all of the other interactions and character development combined by far, and Hall and Carpenter are such amazing actors that other actors at times have difficulty keeping up with them in terms of skill (Velez as Laguerta is a good example).  Carpenter is definitely one of the most underrated actresses on television.  While I know Dexter may not be the best show of all time, Carpenter could literally be given the worst script ever and turn it into gold.  Carpenter is really what makes this season shine to its fullest, and it's really a travesty that she wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe!  And her performance in the finale was really heart-wrenching and beautifully done.Oh, and no, and the show didn't forget about Debra realizing she's in love with her brother.LAGUERTA - Laguerta finds a blood slide in the first episode at Travis' murder scene and starts to do some serious investigation into whether or not the Bay Harbor Butcher is still alive and well.  This causes a lot of drama and confusion for Laguerta, who becomes increasingly more prevalent as the season progresses.  Matthews also comes back, and he's just as big of a jerk as ever.JOEY QUINN - eh.  Definitely one of the worst storylines of the season.  Something about him and a stripper and some guy is mad about....I don't know.  It was so boring I literally already forgot about it.BATISTA - Batista is also incredibly pointless this season.  He has dreams to open some lame restaurant and retire.  I don't know.  Dexter tends to value its guest stars a lot more than its core cast.Speaking of....GUEST STARS -HANNAH - Hannah McKay was the accomplice of a serial killer as a teen, and ended up being let go for a variety of factors.  Hannah and Dexter have great on-screen chemistry when they talk to each other, and there's something hauntingly ominous in her eyes that reminds Dexter of himself.  They have secrets to share.  And she becomes a huge part of the storyline as the season progresses, including a couple very vicious verbal run-ins between her and Debra.  A bad character?  No.  But the way her storyline turned out toward the end of the season really leaves me scratching my head in confusion.SIRKO - Issak Sirko is the boss of a Ukrainian criminal organization called Koshka (which means little kitty cat in Russian...very scary) and played by the amazing Ray Stevenson (Titus in HBO's Rome).  Unfortunately, as much as I love Stevenson, his storyline was one of the biggest bombs of the season.  While I'm glad they decided to use Hannah and Sirko as guest stars this season instead of one big, bad menacing evil person, Sirko fell flat because he seemed to be nothing short of a cartoonish villain.  I never found him to be particularly interesting or scary, and it's comparable to Quinn in the terms that it's so bad that I'm almost blocking it out of memory.FUN - this season is fun because with a couple of exceptions, it wasn't trying to be bigger than it's supposed to be.  Dexter always thrives when it tries to be more classic fun and thrilling rather than thought-provoking and touching.  While it doesn't always fail at that, I do feel the writers have difficulties at times when trying to make their characters too deep.  Without spoiling anything, there's a certain scene later in the episode where Dexter has some kind of daydreams (or maybe they were dreams) of what his future could be like, and it just felt cheesy, out of place, and even spoiled the ending of the episode if you really paid attention.However, there's not a whole lot of that this season, and the finale is one of the best I may have ever seen on Dexter.  It wasn't a disgusting cheap cliffhanger like last season; it wrapped things up nicely for the season that just finished while still leaving plenty of loose ends.  It sets a darker, ominous tone that we've ever felt on Dexter before.  And with next season being the last (most likely), expect for the traditional Dexter formulae to change dramatically...there really is no telling what will happen next!What is truly worth watching it though?  Even if every other storyline *was* terrible this season?  The interactions between Dexter and Debra.  Not only are the acting performances amazing, but Debra is so well-written and completely believable in every difficult line she delivers.  Debra has been a very consistent character along with Dexter since the beginning of the series, so seeing the two develop their relationship between each other so much is really a treat to watch.",5,"""That's how love is.

He's a bad guy; a serial killer"".""Dexter"" was one of the few programs left on TV that I would actually set time aside to watch. The writing was intelligent, it had a strange and engaging sense of humor and had a mostly superb cast. What season seven managed to do was lose the fine line of good taste that made the show such a joy to watch.For some reason it was felt that Deborah need to develop an incestuous desire for Dexter. There were six seasons ahead of this establishing Deb's sense of family loyalty, they did not need to fly off in this uncharacteristic line to establish her motives for the final episode. Her conflict over this felt contrived and forced.There have been complaints over the killing of Maria but considering the inconsistency of the character I personally felt she should have gone long ago. She's a selfish, amoral, bask stabbing political animal; no, wait, she has a deeply motivating love of community - oops, um, no - it's her sense of duty that drives her. It really seemed that during several seasons they had no idea of what to do with her so they pulled some story line out of the air to accommodate keeping the character on the air. This, however, is not the reason why the killed of Maria; they needed a lynch pin to drive season eight and that was it.Even more problematic for season seven was their inability to maintain the sense of humor. The attempt was there but the execution left much to be desired. Whether it was in the editing or the script is hard to tell, but Dexter's funny little internal observations come off as morbid and angry. All through this season he keeps telling Deborah that this is his territory, he's used to problem solving in this atmosphere. The funny little observations he would make over his irritations are now ruthless and devoid of wit.I will purchase this season but I will wait until it is drastically reduced in price. That purchase is more about my ""OCD"" sense of continuity in that I have all the prior seasons. If you're a casual fan and don't have the other DVD sets then rent ""Dexter"" season seven or borrow a friend's.

This season is also good but some of the situations are getting a bit hard to believe.  There was that cliff-hanger at the end of season six that made you want to watch this season and, true to form, there is a cliff-hanger at the end of this season too.  I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  I hated to see Monk end after &#34;only&#34; eight seasons but I think they did the right thing in pulling the plug before it jumped the shark, maybe the folks at Dester should consider ending it in one, or two at the most, more seasons.

1583647,A3RR2P5IS3DGPR,B00915G6WQ,"Dr. M. A. Dixon ""hyper-observant""","[76, 95]","Dexter is my favorite tv series and this season 7 is absolutely the best ever!First of all, Hannah McKay (played by gorgeous and playful Yvonne Strahovski of ""Chuck"") is the most exciting sexual interest for Dexter ever!  Goodie-2-shoes was done seasons 1-4 by girlfriend-turned-wife Rita (played by Julie Benz) with the relationship being mainly focused on Dexter having a cover for his true self which he hid from his family.  He was able to share more of his ""dark passenger"" with Lumen (played by Julia Stiles) in Season 5 which is by far my second favorite season after this season 7 with Dexter's sexual encounters with an experienced killer.I also love the development of Dexter's adopted sister and current boss Debra (played by Jennifer Carpenter) as she learns her adopted brother is a serial killer (in season 6 cliff-hanger ending) and begins her processing of this startling information this season 7.  Other law enforcement characters of the fictional Miami Metro Police Department (based on the real life Miami-Dade Police Department) must also make choices in how to deal with law enforcement / law breaking.While the writing of season 6 was too philosophical IMO for any tv drama series, the writing of this series over-all is so creative and characters are so forthrightly portrayed.  Also the nemesis in season 6 seemed more annoying than dangerous and challenging, yet season 7's nemesis is more dangerous than ever with the head of a Ukrainian crime syndicate (played by all-so-handsome and debonair Ray Stevenson) targeting Dexter for revenge.  Will Stevenson surpass the bar set by John Lithgow in season 4?Michael C Hall continues with outstanding acting beyond imagination.  Dexter is in danger from all directions - the mob, the police department including his sister, his new girlfriend, and even from within by a critical father voice as well as his own self-image - and all while managing to be a single parent working full-time.  How will he handle it all?It is no surprise that Dexter has been nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards, in the category of Outstanding Drama Series 3 times in a row, from 2008 to 2010 and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (for Michael C. Hall) 4 times in a row, from 2008 to 2011. Dexter has also received over a dozen Creative Arts Emmy Awards. It has also been nominated for 7 Golden Globes (winning 2), 14 Satellite Awards (winning 7), 18 Saturn Awards (winning 5), 8 Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning 1), and 5 Writers Guild of America Awards.I can't believe Season 8 will be the last season.

The opening of the season picks up where season 6 ended - same room, with Dexter just having murdered Travis - while his sister Debra (now a lieutenant in the police force) watching. Dexter tells her ""I snapped,"" blaming Rita's death. She asks about him being wrapped in plastic and he says it is just ""second nature not to leave a trace."" When Debra tries to call the station he stops her, pointing out how weird everything looks. He points out that even if it is ruled self-defense he'd lose his job and his son. He suggests getting rid of the body, but she doesn't go for it. Dexter then thinks they could make it look like a suicide, including setting the church on fire. The plan involves gasoline and Debra says she'll go get a few gallons. Dexter flashes back to childhood and Harry wanting to get rid of a dog that Debra likes. Dexter thinks he needs to keep Debra from the ""whole truth."" Dexter takes down all of his kill stuff. Dexter is forced to attempt a cover-up, which works for a while until Debra uncovers enough evidence to as Dexter is he is indeed a serial killer.  It looks as though the season will play on this strange predicament with every episode, but meanwhile there is an added murder with grand implications that sets the team, including Dexter, into action to uncover the killer.  The entire cast returns for this season - Michael C. Hall as the blood spatter expert Dexter Morgan, Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan, C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka, Lauren V&eacute;lez as Lt.

Season 6 was pretty good I thought (Edward James Olmos in a villainous role was kind of fun and I thought he did a good job).  But Season 7 has just been great and for so many reasons.  First of all there are lots of very poignant jewels of wisdom in Dexter's reflections on life and these ring true even for those who are not serial killers.  Second, they shifted the plot up in season 7 - it's not just Dexter against some new psycho, but rather Dexter in love with the new psycho, not to mention other interesting subplots, including one that develops in a big way and will lead us with great anticipation into the next season.  This anticipation for the next season was something I didn't experience after season 5.  But it's here in spades at the end of season 7!  OK, and finally, the last reason I like this show is that it's often darkly humorous.  Among other things, it's kind of funny bringing Sgt Doakes back into the picture - every time Doakes comes into the picture I just gotta laugh.. He's like a smaller version or Mr T, but on steroids!!!  I really started enjoying this show once I accepted it for what it is - a show!!  I don't demand perfect logic or beleivability in every scene, though I appreciate them when they're there.. but rather I am happy to enjoy the show in the same way I might enjoy a comic book.  It has that quality about it, and it doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Great screenplay writing in this season - very imaginative and creative and good on many levels.

Deb witnessed Dexter's killing of Travis Marshall, the Doomsday Killer. His sister now knows she has to deal with his disturbing secret. She can arrest him or cover up his crimes. Her choices become the meat of Season 7.The writers dig deep into Dexter's psyche and what makes him tick. This season has many plot twists and a jaw-opening finale that will leave fans stunned. All rules of love, honesty and decency are broken in Season 7. Dexter is wavering from the clear ""Code"" that his adoptive father created for him...a code that lets a serial killer keep murdering but with his conscience intact. Harry is long dead but he appears at Dexter's side as his conscience and voice of reason. Now that Deb knows that her dear, sweet brother is a killer, nothing can be the same. How will they protect their secret?New and fascinating characters are added this season. Ray Stevenson guest stars as Isaac Sirko - the head of a Ukrainian mob running drugs out of a strip club in Miami.  Stevenson is perfect as the ruggedly handsome and diabolically ruthless Sirko. Soon Sirko is out to kill Dexter who is out to kill Sirko before Sirko and Dexter join forces. Sound confusing? Just follow along. Somehow the writers make it all work.  The writers turn murderous Sirko becomes almost a sympathetic and likeable character when the tables are turned and his life is in danger. Let's not forget to mention that sleazy Detective Quinn falls for one the Russian strippers working in the club.Added to the mix, is the gorgeous Yvonne Strahovski as Hannah McKay. As a teenager, she was involved with a serial killer, but she was just an innocent victim....or was she? Dexter is faced with a moral dilemma as he falls deeply in love with the only person who can truly understand him. Strahovski is an absolute knock-out in both looks and deception. What a perfect match for Dexter. He uncovers her secrets and she knows only Hannah will ever truly understand them. Two twisted minds are bound by some unseen force and both Dexter and Hannah know there can be no happily ever after to their story.Things are worse than ever at Miami Metro. Items disappear from the evidence room and killers go free. Investigations that are getting to close to the truth are quelched. Are there any honest cops in Miami Metro? Someone is going to pay a price for all these unsavory shenanigans. LaGuerta finally comes to bat as revealing evidence comes her way. She closes in on Dexter. She's sure the Bay Harbor Killer is still alive and that detective Doakes was framed all those years ago. The question that begs an answer is why does LaGuerta keep the evidence to herself and only tells Debra?Jennifer Carpenter as foul-mouthed Debra Morgan has plugged along through the years as the annoying police officer turned lieutenant who now has the power to quelch investigations that could jeopardize Dexter's secret. Her character has grown and expanded and is much more pivotal than ever before. She has to protect Dexter from the police and from his new love Hannah. Carpenter's emotional scene in the finale is heart-wrenching and so believable that there is no better acting on TV. Kudos to Jennifer Carpenter for finally being able to delve into her character.In a nutshell, Season 7 of DEXTER is like no other. Dexter seems to go deeper and deeper into his madness. His rigid code is going be broken. He is willing to plant evidence to frame innocent people. The code is expanded to allow for the killing of anyone, no matter how innocent, if they stand in the way of Dexter, Debra or Hannah's safety. Anyone is free game now. All of this leads to the most shocking and unnerving cliff-hanger finale. Dexter and Debra's worlds are spiraling out of control. Can the final Season 8 put all the pieces together?",4,DEXTER'S CODE IS BROKEN,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,3872,"['Season', '6', 'finale', 'DEXTER', 'clear', 'Dexter', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Deb', 'witnessed', 'Dexter', 'killing', 'Travis', 'Marshall', 'Doomsday', 'Killer', 'sister', 'now', 'deal', 'disturbing', 'secret', 'can', 'arrest', 'cover', 'up', 'crimes', 'choices', 'become', 'meat', 'Season', '7.The', 'writers', 'dig', 'deep', 'Dexter', 'psyche', 'what', 'tick', 'season', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'jaw-opening', 'finale', 'will', 'leave', 'fans', 'stunned', 'rules', 'love', 'honesty', 'decency', 'are', 'broken', 'Season', '7', 'Dexter', 'wavering', 'clear', 'Code', 'adoptive', 'father', 'created', 'code', 'serial', 'killer', 'keep', 'murdering', 'conscience', 'intact', 'Harry', 'long', 'dead', 'Dexter', 'side', 'conscience', 'voice', 'reason', 'Now', 'Deb', 'dear', 'sweet', 'brother', 'killer', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'same', 'How', 'will', 'protect', 'secret', 'New', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'are', 'added', 'season', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'guest', 'stars', 'Isaac', 'Sirko', 'head', 'Ukrainian', 'mob', 'running', 'drugs', 'strip', 'club', 'Miami', 'Stevenson', 'perfect', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'diabolically', 'ruthless', 'Sirko', 'Soon', 'Sirko', 'out', 'kill', 'Dexter', 'who', 'out', 'kill', 'Sirko', 'Sirko', 'Dexter', 'join', 'forces', 'Sound', 'confusing', 'Just', 'follow', 'along', 'Somehow', 'writers', 'make', 'work', 'writers', 'turn', 'murderous', 'Sirko', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'likeable', 'character', 'when', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'life', 'danger', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'sleazy', 'Detective', 'Quinn', 'one', 'Russian', 'strippers', 'working', 'club.Added', 'mix', 'gorgeous', 'Yvonne', 'Strahovski', 'Hannah', 'McKay', 'teenager', 'was', 'involved', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'just', 'innocent', 'victim', '.or', 'was', 'Dexter', 'faced', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'deeply', 'love', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'understand', 'Strahovski', 'absolute', 'knock-out', 'looks', 'deception', 'What', 'perfect', 'match', 'Dexter', 'secrets', 'only', 'Hannah', 'will', 'ever', 'truly', 'understand', 'Two', 'twisted', 'minds', 'are', 'bound', 'unseen', 'force', 'Dexter', 'Hannah', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'happily', 'ever', 'story.Things', 'are', 'worse', 'ever', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'Items', 'disappear', 'evidence', 'room', 'killers', 'go', 'free', 'Investigations', 'are', 'getting', 'close', 'truth', 'are', 'quelched', 'Are', 'there', 'honest', 'cops', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'Someone', 'going', 'pay', 'price', 'unsavory', 'shenanigans', 'LaGuerta', 'finally', 'bat', 'revealing', 'evidence', 'way', 'Dexter', 'sure', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Killer', 'still', 'alive', 'detective', 'Doakes', 'was', 'framed', 'years', 'ago', 'question', 'answer', 'why', 'LaGuerta', 'keep', 'evidence', 'herself', 'only', 'Debra', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'foul-mouthed', 'Debra', 'Morgan', 'plugged', 'years', 'annoying', 'police', 'officer', 'turned', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'now', 'power', 'quelch', 'investigations', 'could', 'jeopardize', 'Dexter', 'secret', 'character', 'grown', 'expanded', 'much', 'more', 'pivotal', 'ever', 'protect', 'Dexter', 'police', 'new', 'love', 'Hannah', 'Carpenter', 'emotional', 'scene', 'finale', 'heart-wrenching', 'so', 'believable', 'better', 'acting', 'TV', 'Kudos', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'delve', 'character.In', 'nutshell', 'Season', '7', 'DEXTER', 'other', 'Dexter', 'go', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'madness', 'rigid', 'code', 'going', 'be', 'broken', 'willing', 'plant', 'evidence', 'frame', 'innocent', 'people', 'code', 'expanded', 'allow', 'killing', 'anyone', 'matter', 'how', 'innocent', 'stand', 'way', 'Dexter', 'Debra', 'Hannah', 'safety', 'Anyone', 'free', 'game', 'now', 'most', 'shocking', 'unnerving', 'cliff-hanger', 'finale', 'Dexter', 'Debra', 'worlds', 'are', 'spiraling', 'control', 'Can', 'final', 'Season', '8', 'put', 'pieces', 'together']",Dexter: Season 7

1583663,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00915G6WQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This season takes Deb down into the deepest layers of hell. It starts with Deb falling upon Dexter's killing a Christian serial killer in his church and it ends with an even grosser and more deliriously crazy crime. Dexter used to be more or less manipulated by his Dark Passenger, by a need he had to satisfy, an impulse he had to follow, but little by little he realizes that there is no dark passenger and that he is entirely responsible for his crimes and that leads to the idea that he is killing to survive, and eventually to avenge the killing of his mother.As soon as this idea that survival is the main objective Dexter becomes a plain ordinary simple and banal serial killer. He does not kill dangerous people, I mean dangerous for society because they are serial killers themselves, but he kills because he feels menaced. His killing is no longer an act of vigilante justice but an act of pure fear, the fear to be taken, and when his sister is totally involved, the fear she might get caught or that she might become the target of some other criminal, and little by little of the police itself. It is no longer awesome but it has become awful.The psychological level of the characters, Dexter among them, then loses a lot of its appeal. Dexter is a monster, a self-centered, egocentric, selfish monster. He has not one ounce of humanity left. He has become a danger for society by not being a scavenger that takes care of mental rubbish and social garbage. Then the suspense in the series is no longer only about when and how he is going to be caught but rather how he is going to get out of his mess by killing whom, when, where, how. Up to now there was an ethical dimension he called a code in that appeal. Now it is purely morbid and nothing but morbid.The series uses some circumstantial subjects to build some kind of setting and environment to the predator's hunt. The Ukrainian mafia in Miami opens night clubs with Ukrainian dancers who are essentially strippers and pole dancers, in other words something close to prostitution that is more or less tolerated but the Ukrainian mafia uses that cover to import all kinds of highly profitable drugs. This clandestine commerce then comes to a direct clash with the Colombian drug mafia that tries to defend their territory. But that transforms the series again into a simple criminal action film like so many others.The series tries to widen Dexter's scope by making him fall in love with another criminal who has killed exclusively to protect herself from all kinds of ills, a father first who was brutal, a gambler, a child molester, etc, and then juvenile institutions and then the serial killer she makes an escape at 15 with and whose crimes she shares, apparently with a lot of zeal but her lawyer manages to get her some immunity for these crimes because she was considered to be a hostage more than an accomplice. She knows what killing means, and she is in poison, and she understands Dexter and Dexter understands her. They fall in love, real love, not some social convenient arrangement like with Rita. But she menaces Deb who is trying to step between her and Dexter. Then Dexter has to get her in prison for one crime he had covered up.But she escapes. Food for the next season.Then this season revives Maria La Guardia, the Captain, and her love affair with Dokes, a Haitian sergeant who hated Dexter and had seen him through, and her obsession, in continuation of Dokes's own obsession, against Dexter and she brings back out of the boxes the case of the Bay Harbor Butcher, but things have become tricky and since Dexter promised Deb not to compete with the police any more, he has to find other solutions than killing people and he becomes very good at framing them. He thus frames Maria who has tried and is trying to frame him. These two framers and their accomplices are like writing the new constitution of the Crime Republic, but that is easy, that is not even respectable, nor believable. And the framers lose their frames in the mean time and have to come back to the radical solution: dispose of the menace.I am afraid I have to say this season is packed with action and dynamic intrigue, but the main and most successful actor has become the mosquito in the very opening credit sequence, even if its nlife is very short-lived. Even the love of Deb for Dexter is turned into something perverse and sickening. Crime corrupts and absolute crime corrupts absolutely.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,From vigilante to plain serial killer,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,4476,"['season', 'Deb', 'down', 'deepest', 'layers', 'hell', 'Deb', 'falling', 'Dexter', 'killing', 'Christian', 'serial', 'killer', 'church', 'even', 'grosser', 'more', 'deliriously', 'crazy', 'crime', 'Dexter', 'used', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'manipulated', 'Dark', 'Passenger', 'need', 'had', 'satisfy', 'impulse', 'had', 'follow', 'little', 'little', 'dark', 'passenger', 'entirely', 'responsible', 'crimes', 'idea', 'killing', 'survive', 'eventually', 'avenge', 'killing', 'mother.As', 'soon', 'idea', 'survival', 'main', 'objective', 'Dexter', 'plain', 'ordinary', 'simple', 'banal', 'serial', 'killer', 'not', 'kill', 'dangerous', 'people', 'mean', 'dangerous', 'society', 'are', 'serial', 'killers', 'menaced', 'killing', 'no', 'longer', 'act', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'act', 'pure', 'fear', 'fear', 'be', 'taken', 'when', 'sister', 'totally', 'involved', 'fear', 'might', 'get', 'caught', 'might', 'become', 'target', 'other', 'criminal', 'little', 'little', 'police', 'no', 'longer', 'awesome', 'become', 'awful.The', 'psychological', 'level', 'characters', 'Dexter', 'then', 'lot', 'appeal', 'Dexter', 'monster', 'self-centered', 'egocentric', 'selfish', 'monster', 'not', 'one', 'ounce', 'humanity', 'left', 'become', 'danger', 'society', 'not', 'being', 'scavenger', 'care', 'mental', 'rubbish', 'social', 'garbage', 'Then', 'suspense', 'series', 'longer', 'only', 'about', 'when', 'how', 'going', 'be', 'caught', 'rather', 'how', 'going', 'get', 'mess', 'killing', 'whom', 'when', 'where', 'how', 'now', 'was', 'ethical', 'dimension', 'called', 'code', 'appeal', 'Now', 'purely', 'morbid', 'nothing', 'morbid.The', 'series', 'circumstantial', 'subjects', 'build', 'kind', 'setting', 'environment', 'predator', 'hunt', 'Ukrainian', 'mafia', 'Miami', 'opens', 'night', 'clubs', 'Ukrainian', 'dancers', 'who', 'are', 'essentially', 'strippers', 'pole', 'dancers', 'other', 'words', 'something', 'close', 'prostitution', 'more', 'less', 'tolerated', 'Ukrainian', 'mafia', 'cover', 'import', 'kinds', 'highly', 'profitable', 'drugs', 'clandestine', 'commerce', 'then', 'direct', 'clash', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'mafia', 'defend', 'territory', 'series', 'again', 'simple', 'criminal', 'action', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'others.The', 'series', 'tries', 'widen', 'Dexter', 'scope', 'making', 'fall', 'love', 'criminal', 'who', 'killed', 'exclusively', 'protect', 'kinds', 'ills', 'father', 'first', 'who', 'was', 'brutal', 'gambler', 'child', 'molester', 'etc', 'then', 'juvenile', 'institutions', 'then', 'serial', 'killer', 'escape', '15', 'crimes', 'shares', 'apparently', 'lot', 'zeal', 'lawyer', 'get', 'immunity', 'crimes', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'hostage', 'more', 'accomplice', 'what', 'killing', 'means', 'poison', 'Dexter', 'Dexter', 'fall', 'love', 'real', 'love', 'not', 'social', 'convenient', 'arrangement', 'Rita', 'Deb', 'who', 'trying', 'step', 'Dexter', 'Then', 'Dexter', 'get', 'prison', 'one', 'crime', 'had', 'covered', 'up.But', 'Food', 'next', 'season.Then', 'season', 'Maria', 'La', 'Guardia', 'Captain', 'love', 'affair', 'Dokes', 'Haitian', 'sergeant', 'who', 'hated', 'Dexter', 'had', 'seen', 'obsession', 'continuation', 'Dokes', 'own', 'obsession', 'Dexter', 'back', 'boxes', 'case', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'things', 'have', 'become', 'tricky', 'Dexter', 'promised', 'Deb', 'not', 'compete', 'police', 'more', 'find', 'other', 'solutions', 'killing', 'people', 'very', 'good', 'framing', 'thus', 'frames', 'Maria', 'who', 'tried', 'trying', 'frame', 'two', 'framers', 'accomplices', 'are', 'writing', 'new', 'constitution', 'Crime', 'Republic', 'easy', 'not', 'even', 'respectable', 'believable', 'framers', 'lose', 'frames', 'mean', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'radical', 'solution', 'dispose', 'menace.I', 'am', 'afraid', 'have', 'say', 'season', 'packed', 'action', 'dynamic', 'intrigue', 'main', 'most', 'successful', 'actor', 'become', 'mosquito', 'very', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'even', 'nlife', 'very', 'short-lived', 'Even', 'love', 'Deb', 'Dexter', 'turned', 'something', 'perverse', 'sickening', 'Crime', 'corrupts', 'absolute', 'crime', 'corrupts', 'absolutely.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Dexter: Season 7

We were along on Dexter's journey to &#34;discover himself&#34; and navigate life in a world that was morally confusing and ambiguous.Season 2 stayed edgy, and when season 3 started to &#34;lose the edge&#34;, Season 4 came along to become one of the greatest Season's of any show in television history, thanks to an excellent John Lithgow villain, incredible tension and writing, and the culmination of Dexter's emotional Journey.Then the descent into mediocrity began again in earnest. Season 5 picked up where season 3 left off, and the show, while entertaining, was no longer very creative or edgy. Season 6 was downright terrible, and season 7 does little to improve upon season 6. The sophisticated and thoughtful way in which Dexter rationalizes his world of darkness and light, and moral ambiguity is replaced by a feeling that Dexter is like a child with a dark side who is unable to cope. He is lost with his &#34;dark passenger&#34;, his sexual urges, and his relationships with others. Also gone is the prevalent feeling that you were experiencing a little piece of Miami with every episode, the suspense, and the interesting character conflicts.If you like a mediocre soap opera about a childish serial killer who only kills bad guys, watch the show.",3,No more edge,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1406,"['Season', '1', 'Dexter', 'was', '34', '34', 'unique', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'full', 'suspense', 'conflicts', 'reached', 'right', 'down', 'emotional', 'level', 'were', 'along', 'Dexter', 'journey', '34', 'discover', '34', 'navigate', 'life', 'world', 'was', 'morally', 'confusing', 'ambiguous.Season', '2', 'stayed', 'edgy', 'when', 'season', '3', 'started', '34', 'lose', 'edge', '34', 'Season', '4', 'came', 'along', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'Season', 'show', 'television', 'history', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'villain', 'incredible', 'tension', 'writing', 'culmination', 'Dexter', 'emotional', 'Journey.Then', 'descent', 'mediocrity', 'began', 'again', 'earnest', 'Season', '5', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'season', '3', 'left', 'off', 'show', 'entertaining', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'very', 'creative', 'edgy', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'downright', 'terrible', 'season', '7', 'little', 'improve', 'season', '6', 'sophisticated', 'thoughtful', 'way', 'Dexter', 'world', 'darkness', 'light', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'replaced', 'feeling', 'Dexter', 'child', 'dark', 'side', 'who', 'unable', 'cope', 'lost', '34', 'dark', 'passenger', '34', 'sexual', 'urges', 'relationships', 'others', 'Also', 'gone', 'prevalent', 'feeling', 'were', 'experiencing', 'little', 'piece', 'Miami', 'episode', 'suspense', 'interesting', 'character', 'conflicts.If', 'mediocre', 'soap', 'opera', 'childish', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'only', 'bad', 'guys', 'watch', 'show']",Dexter: Season 7

After a somewhat disappointing 6th season, the writers pull out all the stops in a sometimes hard to believe plot twists script.  But in spite of its weaknesses, I found myself riveted and involved and glad I wait on the DVD to avoid waiting week to week.  I watched all 12 episodes in three nights!It's well known that Season 8 is the last so its direction can pretty much go anywhere.  The acting is generally flawless---Michael C. Hall is brilliant in his gradual progression to an even more sinister character.  Are the writers preparing us to see Dexter in a darker light?  Jennifer Carpenter acts up a storm as Deb faces an inconceivable truth about her brother.  The remaining regular cast especially David Zayas, Lauren Valez and CS Lee are great.  Desmond Harrington and his Quinn foul-up Quinn have become tiresome and superfluous.Yvonne Strahovski as the deadly Hannah is remarkably effective, possibly more frightening soulmate for Dexter.  Ray Stevenson brings a cruel detachment as Izaak and Jason Gedrick seems to relish his role as heartless George. Dexter's runinations with Daddy James Remar are becoming redundant as well.I have enjoyed the ride with the Dark Passenger but I agree with the decision to go out while the series is still strong.

FINALLY got Dexter season 7 on Blu-Ray, but I'm disappointed in this release for several reasons.1) Lack of special features.A) Previous seasons have had at least SOME special features, if not a few. Usually interviews / commentaries. This one seems to have none.B) This season seems to mark a turning point in the show. Dexter's relationship with his sister, the unraveling of Dexter's methodical, uhh, methods for reamining undetected, signals of the beginning of the end. I'd have expected the cast & crew and script writers to have plenty to say about this season in particular. The silence is deafening.For both reasons I'm disappointed.-----2) The deceptive use of UV Digital Copy on this release.Yes, it comes with a UV redemption code. But it blows for two reasons:A) The code is not for what you'd expect it to be for. You DO NOT get a copy of the series on UV. Nope. So why bother adding UV anything at all?B) The code is for only the pilot of a completely different show. Rob something-or-other-I-really-don't-care. Yes, it says what you get on the top of the sticker in ""fine print,"" but does anyone ever actually read the stickers? No, we assume when we buy the thing that if we buy Hotel Transylvania with UV, we get Hotel Transylvania with a UV copy *OF* Hotel Transylvania, not a UV copy of something completely different and barely if at all related.It's both a slap in the face and deceptive packaging. Any reasonable person would expect that if there's a UV sticker on the front of the thing, it means you're getting a UV copy of the title you're buying. That's what UV is for. It's not for advertising some product OTHER than the title in question.If I'm buying Dexter, I don't want a copy of Mama's Family or Carebears, or the pilot episode of Zombieland. I want DEXTER. That was what I was expecting. Not until I got home and opened the package did I begin to suspect that the code was not for the title I purchased, but something else. At first I thought, okay, I get Dexter AND a pilot episode of something else. NOPE! JUST the pilot episode of something else. NO DEXTER on UV.Add this to my irritation at the deceptively packagedBreaking Bad - The Fifth Season(which is not ""The Fifth Season"" bu the FIRST HALF of the season, which is nowhere mentioned in any obvious way).So, basically, this season is a barebones release and you don't get what you'd assume you're getting based on the UV sticker. To me, that's bait & switch. Feel free to vote with your $$ and hope they remedy this problem. Though, I'm not expecting much.Otherwise, the show is still great, picture quality is good, etc. I'm just irritated with the lack of features (especially given there's SOME stuff on SHO's web site relating to this season; would it have killed them to include THAT?) and the lack of a UV copy of the title purchased, despite the UV sticker (which implies, even if it actually states otherwise, that you should be getting a copy of the title you just purchased not what amounts to advertising for something completely different; I didn't intentionally pay to be advertised to, and had I realized the deception I might have reconsidered my purchase).",4,"Barebones Blu-Ray, deceptive use of UV Digital Copy.

Very much of it is implausible, and it definitely takes a lot of suspension of disbelief.  But this season really began to focus on what has really always been the question.  What would happen if the wrong person found out about Dexter.  Granted yes, others have found out that he is a serial killer, and he has always been able to end up with the upper hand.  Yet, the one person he will not kill had never found out about him.  That changed this season (actually at the very end of last season), and the storyline dealing with that fallout was great.Another wonderful addition to the season was Yvonne Strahovski, as a true love interest.  As anyone who watched Chuck knows, she is a very talented actress beyond being drop dead gorgeous, and she played the character as cunning, vulnerable, dangerous and loving.  Unlike any of the other love interests she was not blind to what Dexter is, over the top crazy, or damaged.  Yet the character is crazy and damaged but in different ways than Lila and Lumen.The other story of the season was Dexter as a target of a Ukrainian mobster.  It is in a lot of ways the filler story of the season, but even so has its own little twists and turns and basically gives Dexter something to deal with while trying to keep even more people from finding out his secret.  Sgt.

Ive felt that the show has been going down hill for some time now sadly as it became more and more unlikely, less about the psychology of what is happening, and frankly, increasingly more boring.  As slow and dull as season 6 was, it at least still had some great, taut, suspenseful parts to it as well as some truly horrific imagery.  It also ended with a huge bang.  For season 7, they really didnt bother.**SPOILERS**!. They completely forgot to add any suspense to the entire season.  I mean not one ounce2. One of the main things has always been Dexter trying to hide his big secret, his dark passenger if you must. Is it just me, or was there no secret to hide this time around? Deb knew, the new girlfriend Hanna knew, hell Laguerda knew. Granted the captain was trying to get Dexter, but was there ever even a moment in which you ever felt she might?3. In the final episode at the end, Deb shows up at the container and draws her gun. Was there even a fraction of a second in which you werent absolutely certain shed kill Laguerta? How much more predictable and one dimensional could this season have been?4. Was there ever really even a bad guy, an arch nemesis this time around? Sure, you had Isaak Sirko play the enemy for a couple of episodes, but pretty soon even hes just another friend that also knows the big secret and keeps it to himself, then dies anyway.5. Where was the creepy? Where was the mystery? Where was the WTF? Not one moment of any of the episodes ever had you guessing, shocked, confused or even on the edge of your chair for even 2 minutes.I believe the 8th season coming up may be the final one.

What I am commenting on  here is the poor dvd sets Showtime produces. The Dexter DVD sets have no, or next to no, extras on them that actually relate to the show. Instead, they make you go online to find any extras. Then they load the set you are actually paying for down with single episodes of other Showtime series they want to try and get you to buy, most of which you will have no interest in at all. Then, for the past two seasons, they have put ads for their other shows, several minutes worth, at the start of every disk in the set,and engineered it so you cannot skip or fast forward though the ads to get to the menu. This means that forever, every time you load a disk, you will have to sit through the ads with no way to avoid them. It really shows Showtime's total disrespect and distain for their customers. I would advise waiting on ordering this set and see if Showtime is going to pull  the same shoddy tricks with their viewers and customers they have pulled on the last two DVD sets. At that point decide if you are willing to put up with Showtime's dirty tricks. Will I still end up buying this set? Probably,since I love the show and this season. But by not preordering so far in advance I hope a message is sent to Showtime that they are abusing their customer loyalty and to let them know that their tricks are alienating their customers. I for one will never by a Showtime dvd set other than Dexter, that is for sure. Showtime cannot be trusted.Adding this to my entry here on 04-19-2013: I just learned that there will be no Dexter extras other than the biographies of the actors again. What is being put on the disks are as follows:Special Features:Ray Donovan (Pilot Episode) on Disc 4 on DVD; via UltraViolet on Blu-rayFirst two episodes of the Second Season of The Borgias (DVD only)First two episodes of the First Season of House of Lies (via E-Bridge Technology on DVD)Biographies (DVD only)As far as I am concerned, these are not ""Special Features"".  They are advertising to try and get you to buy their other series as well as Dexter. Special Features, in my opinion, are extras that relate to the show you are buying. Since this follows their same pattern as the previous couple of years releases for Dexter, I fear they will also treat their customers and fans as idiots and include the forced advertising at the start of every disk as well. At the price they are asking, I for one am going to hold off buying this season of Dexter for a year and see if the price drops to something more reasonable for a bare bones release loaded with annoying forced ads and unrelated episodes of other shows.",3,"Fantastic show, fantastic season, but worst dvd sets I've ever seen",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,2750,"['give', 'Dexter', 'less', 'Five', 'stars', 'show', 'five', 'stars', 'season', 'fantastic', 'too', 'What', 'am', 'commenting', 'here', 'poor', 'dvd', 'sets', 'Showtime', 'Dexter', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'next', 'extras', 'actually', 'relate', 'show', 'Instead', 'make', 'go', 'online', 'find', 'extras', 'Then', 'load', 'set', 'are', 'actually', 'paying', 'down', 'single', 'episodes', 'other', 'Showtime', 'series', 'want', 'try', 'get', 'buy', 'most', 'will', 'have', 'interest', 'Then', 'past', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'put', 'ads', 'other', 'shows', 'several', 'minutes', 'worth', 'start', 'disk', 'set', 'engineered', 'can', 'not', 'skip', 'fast', 'forward', 'ads', 'get', 'menu', 'forever', 'time', 'load', 'disk', 'will', 'have', 'sit', 'ads', 'way', 'avoid', 'really', 'Showtime', 'total', 'disrespect', 'distain', 'customers', 'would', 'advise', 'waiting', 'ordering', 'set', 'see', 'Showtime', 'going', 'pull', 'same', 'shoddy', 'tricks', 'viewers', 'customers', 'have', 'pulled', 'last', 'two', 'DVD', 'sets', 'point', 'decide', 'are', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'Showtime', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'Will', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'set', 'Probably', 'love', 'show', 'season', 'not', 'preordering', 'so', 'far', 'advance', 'hope', 'message', 'sent', 'Showtime', 'are', 'abusing', 'customer', 'loyalty', 'let', 'know', 'tricks', 'are', 'alienating', 'customers', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'Showtime', 'dvd', 'set', 'other', 'Dexter', 'sure', 'Showtime', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted.Adding', 'entry', 'here', '04-19-2013', 'just', 'learned', 'will', 'be', 'Dexter', 'other', 'biographies', 'actors', 'again', 'What', 'being', 'put', 'disks', 'are', 'Special', 'Features', 'Ray', 'Donovan', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'Disc', '4', 'DVD', 'UltraViolet', 'Blu-rayFirst', 'two', 'episodes', 'Second', 'Season', 'Borgias', 'DVD', 'only', 'First', 'two', 'episodes', 'First', 'Season', 'House', 'Lies', 'E-Bridge', 'Technology', 'DVD', 'Biographies', 'DVD', 'only', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'are', 'not', 'Special', 'Features', 'are', 'advertising', 'try', 'get', 'buy', 'other', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Dexter', 'Special', 'Features', 'opinion', 'are', 'extras', 'relate', 'show', 'are', 'buying', 'same', 'pattern', 'previous', 'couple', 'years', 'releases', 'Dexter', 'fear', 'will', 'also', 'treat', 'customers', 'fans', 'idiots', 'include', 'forced', 'advertising', 'start', 'disk', 'as', 'well', 'price', 'are', 'asking', 'one', 'am', 'going', 'hold', 'off', 'buying', 'season', 'Dexter', 'year', 'see', 'price', 'drops', 'something', 'more', 'reasonable', 'bare', 'release', 'loaded', 'annoying', 'forced', 'ads', 'unrelated', 'episodes', 'other', 'shows']",Dexter: Season 7

1583811,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00915G6WQ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 4]","Dexter gets no respect. Showtime has continued to offer little to nothing in the way of ""special features"" for the series. While that might not be a big deal for some, it is, for others, one of the reasons that they buy a DVD or Blu-ray. In this instance, the DVD has better ""special features"" because you get access to the episode from other Showtime series (""The Borgias: Season Two-episodes 1 & 2 and the pilot for the series ""Ray Donovan"", biographies--something that was out of date a decade ago). Blu-ray buyers get only the pilot for ""Ray Donovan"". Oh, and to add insult to injury the pilot episode is only available as a Ultra Violet Download.Four stars for the season, no stars for the special features.I digress.The seventh season proved that there was still some life in ""Dexter"". The previous season showed promise but it fully flowers here on the seventh.SPOILERS:Dexter is caught just after a kill by his sister Debra. She becomes complicit in Dexter's activities because she chooses not to turn him in. She also believes that she can help Dexter control his impulses. Dexter himself becomes involved with a woman who went on a killing spree as a teenager and now quietly runs her own gardening business--except she hasn't exactly given up killing.She suggests that Dexter doesn't have a Dark Passenger at all--that it's all part of HIM which forces Dexter to re-evaluate who he is.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray for Dexter looks exceptionally good. The early Blu-rays released by CBS for Showtime were a mixed bag with nice detail but had issues with noise. ""Dexter: The Seventh Season"" looks darn near perfect with skin tones spot on, solid blacks and exceptional detail.The lossless 5.1 mix sounds marvelous as well with excellent use of the format to immerse you in the action. It's an amazingly detailed soundtrack with sounds everywhere. There's also the option for 2.0 surround as well as 5.1 French and Spanish audio tracks.Unfortunately, subtitles are ONLY provided in English which, given that this also has French & Spanish 5.1 mixes available is an odd choice, indeed.We spoke about special features earlier. This continues to be a failing for ""Dexter"". Curiously, Jennifer Carpenter tweeted earlier this year that she had completed a commentary track for the seventh season which begs the question--where is it? My guess is that once the show wraps up, CBS will release a boxed set complete with commentary tracks and other special features forcing the hardcore ""Dexter"" fans to pony up yet again for something they may have already purchase. If that IS the case, shame on CBS/Paramount/Showtime.We get the pilot for ""Ray Donovan"" but that's all folks. It's somewhat embarrassing that what used to be Showtime's flagship series (winner of multiple awards)is treated so shoddily on Blu-ray and DVD.For those fans who watched the original run on Showtime and want to own this on Blu-ray, the only advantage is that this looks better here than the compressed high def version that ran on Showtime.

He had accidently killed a couple of innocents before, but tried to rectify his mistakes. Now he aids a serial killer to escape, and kills a person deliberately who is outside the guidelines of the code, but probably deserves it.

Dexter gets caught up in a Ukrainian mob war, LaGuerta closes in upon her quarry, and Quinn and Angel move forwards with their lives and careers. Finally, FINALLY they begin to pull their act together. They're not the inebriated winos used for cheap laughs. More flashbacks into Dexter's past deepen the bonds between step-brother and step-sister. Nothing is out of character and every action makes sense, both individually and as part of the whole.The primary villains (Isaak Sirko and Hannah McKay) aren't just evil villains who want to torture their prey or destroy society. They're well-rounded, developed and almost four-dimensional. And all the better, because at least some of them will be surviving until the show's final season.Because of the nature of the plot and character development, this is best watched after re-watching the first two seasons.",5,What Season Six Should've Been,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,1102,"['Season', 'six', 'undeniably', 'lacklustre', 'especially', 'compared', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'tension', 'suspense', 'riveting', 'viewing.After', 'Deb', 'Dexter', 'secret', 'was', 'almost', 'exposed', 'season', '5', 'climax', 'things', 'unravel', 'Dexter', 'caught', 'up', 'Ukrainian', 'mob', 'war', 'LaGuerta', 'quarry', 'Quinn', 'Angel', 'move', 'forwards', 'lives', 'careers', 'Finally', 'FINALLY', 'begin', 'pull', 'act', 'together', ""'re"", 'not', 'inebriated', 'winos', 'used', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'More', 'flashbacks', 'Dexter', 'past', 'deepen', 'bonds', 'step-brother', 'step-sister', 'Nothing', 'character', 'action', 'sense', 'individually', 'part', 'whole.The', 'primary', 'villains', 'Isaak', 'Sirko', 'Hannah', 'McKay', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'evil', 'villains', 'who', 'want', 'torture', 'prey', 'destroy', 'society', ""'re"", 'well-rounded', 'developed', 'almost', 'four-dimensional', 'better', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'surviving', 'show', 'final', 'season.Because', 'nature', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'best', 'watched', 're-watching', 'first', 'two', 'seasons']",Dexter: Season 7
