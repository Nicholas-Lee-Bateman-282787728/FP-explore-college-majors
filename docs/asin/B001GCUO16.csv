While it has its faults, there is a lot to love about the movie.The good.  The main characters all do an excellent job.  Especially Jackman since he real life voice and demeanor do not even come close to Logan.  Sabertooth also does a great job in his acting for the script he was given.  You get a real sense that even though he is at odds with his brother, he cares about him more than anything else.... after all according to the movie plot, they have been together for about 150 years.They do a good job explaining how he got the metal in him and the claws as well as his memory loss even though I personally did not like that part of it.The graphics and effects were great too.  On blu ray especially it looked so good.The bad.  The movie moved along way to fast.  You get a small glimpse of the brothers going through wars and stuff up till the present day but largely ignore that back story.  Then they join a special group of others like them and again we get fast forward through their time together and a very brief introduction to the other specials.  He leaves during what appears to be his first mission and somehow everyone is upset and that breaks up the group even though he was new and never did anything for them at least as the movie shows.  He goes and tries to start a normal life and of course that can not happen.  Again this was all so rushed, it should have been its own movie and spent the time to develop these characters better and their relationships.Also far too many characters die and for no reason it seems.  Now in the first Xmen I had an issue with the fact that they were so light on killing and they needed some low level mutants as fodder but this movie just wastes good established (from the comic books) characters.Of course as many others pointed out this movie strays far from the comics but so do the Xmen movies.  I can not really fault that here as they try to stay more in line with the other films than with the comics.  Personally I can accept this as an alternate version of the Xmen world and am ok with that.Overall we still enjoyed the movie but were disappointed at how far short they fell with what they could have done.  I imagine that in 10 years or so somebody will pick up Xmen again and perhaps do the series right.

It was about him as a child, a brother, a son, a mutant, a warrior, a husband. The only disappointment was Taylor Kitsch as Gambit.

1195437,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B001GCUO16,amerdale876,"[2, 9]","Just as good asIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition), with all the action and origins that I expected, and wished had been, in the first X-Men movie. Although I DON'T like what they did with Deadpool. Talk about a drastic change from the comic! Still, a good comic book film. This was what I thought the firstX-Men 1.5movie should have been. I thought Bryan Singer's film was much too overrated and found it often boring at times; at least if paid off by the public receiving the awesomeX2 - X-Men United (Widescreen Edition). And I hope they go through with the rumored Deadpool prequel/sequel movie they have planned; Ryan Reynolds is awesome!As much as I'm not too crazy over Marvel characters (with the exception of Daredevil and the Punisher), I do find Wolverine as one of the most intriguing characters in the Marvel universe, even though he is a bit overexposed. He is interesting the same sense as Superman in that he hardly ages and can not be killed by conventional methods. How would that affect someone? While the topic for both Superman and Wolverine can be dark, it is Supes that takes it lighter than Wolverine. Supes sees death and destruction (very rarily, but sometimes, by his hand and because of him), and while every living being's death does bother him, he has the inner strength to let go of things past and look to the ""big picture."" Wolverine, however, sees nothing but death and destruction (often by his own hand or because of him), and it plagues him to no end, even though he pretends to not care. Supes has the convenience of understanding that his alien biology causes his remarkable powers -- it's who he is, it's how he was born. On the other hand, Logan's power (his bone claws and regenerative healing) while being from his mutant-born gene, are outweighed by his violated feelings about the adamantium fused to his skeleton as well as the memory tampering by the Weapon X program (that's where the movie differs from the comic: Logan did not volunteer for the adamantium Weapon X operation).They've already announced a sequel for this film, and are having some of the story take place in Japan, no doubt showcasing either Logan's 1937 run-in with Ogun, in 1945 where he finds love with a girl in Hiroshima, or post-WWII where he conceives a child with Itsu. Even though all take place before the Weapon X program, it still would be great material to see on screen.Look for appearances by Agent Zero, Deadpool, John Wraith, Blob, a young Cyclops, Silver Fox, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Sabretooth.

His family background . . . well, he didn't have much of one, at least, one that cared. Except for his friend, Victor. One night, during a drunken upset with his later-to-be-found-out father, James learned he could produce bone claws from his hands and defends himself, killing his father.That night, James and Victor are on the run, and promise to always stick together. The years go by and the two find a great outlet for their rage: war. Victor (Liev Schreiber) also has a special ability and he is more animal than man, with claws coming out of his fingers. The two are very similar and age very slowly. War after war goes by, and the two eventually end up working with a secret team run by William Stryker (Danny Huston). While on one mission, James-now calling himself Logan (Hugh Jackman)-feels Victor has gone too far in his attack on an innocent and walks out on the group.Years later, the group's been disbanded and Stryker comes to warn Logan that Victor is behind the recent string of deaths of its former members. The only way Logan will be strong enough to fight the always-stronger Victor is to undergo a special experiment of Stryker's own design: graft the indestructible adamantium to his bones. Logan agrees.But there's something Stryker hasn't told him about what's been going on and when Logan finds out, he's furious and wages an all-out one-man war against Stryker, Victor and anyone else who stands in his way.On the action: cool fight scenes and neat concepts. However, it seemed to me Logan was a little too acrobatic and was able to survive way more and take way more pain than even a mutant with a healing ability could.On the story: works for me, in that we knew Logan had a history going in. He was the star of the X-Men movies after all, and X2 especially focused on Logan's origins as much as they were able without detracting from the main story. I did like seeing what really went on and, more specifically, how Logan lost his memory. I was under the impression that he lost it because of the adamantium experiment and not after it. Doesn't matter, but I did feel for the guy when the love of his life wasn't all she was cracked up to be.On Deadpool, because, you know, it has to be covered: the whole story involving the secret ops group Logan was a part of made for fun action. Deadpool's origin, hey, why not. To be honest, I don't know if they followed the comics or not because I'm more a DC guy than a Marvel one and don't know too much about Deadpool other than he's the ""merc with a mouth."" His transformation from normal-looking Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) to disfigured Wade-good stuff.Was this a perfect movie? No, unfortunately. It felt too cartoony as opposed to carrying with it the realistic tone the other X-movies had, namely the first two.Will I see the sequel? Absolutely.

With stars such as Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Hallie Berry, and Hugh Jackman, the franchise is terrific, one that I really enjoy watching the movies over and over again on DVD.Of the five X-Men films to date, however, I confess I enjoyed this film the least for its sometimes excessive violence, particularly by Wolverine's older brother, Sabertooth.  Hugh Jackman is brilliant -- as you expect -- but the writing is just not quite as solid as it is with the original trilogy nor with X-Men First Class.  It's simply just a bit too much of a violent blockbuster and not quite enough heart to it.  I was especially disappointed in the treatment of Scott Summers (Cyclops) as Cyclops has always been one of my favorite characters.There was also a continuity goof with the film with regards to the very brief appearance of Professor Charles Xavier who is shown STANDING on his own two legs, even though his scene is set fairly close to the present -- long after Xavier was paralyzed.  While this could be explained by his appearance being a psychic illusion (which Xavier is readily capable of), the X-Men franchise has typically done a very good job at making the distinction between reality and what Professor Xavier projects telepathically.  Without such a flash to reality, his appearance makes very little sense.Probably the best part of this film comes through the appearance and use of Gambit (Remy LeBeau) who in many ways steals the show.  In a film largely absent of fan favorite mutants, Gambit is the one face those of us who have seen the other films (and animated series before that) can relate to.",3,The most violent X-Men of All,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,1647,"['love', 'X-Men', 'series', 'stars', 'such', 'Sir', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Hallie', 'Berry', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'franchise', 'terrific', 'one', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'over', 'again', 'DVD.Of', 'five', 'X-Men', 'films', 'date', 'however', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'least', 'sometimes', 'excessive', 'violence', 'particularly', 'Wolverine', 'older', 'brother', 'Sabertooth', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'brilliant', 'expect', 'writing', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'solid', 'original', 'trilogy', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'simply', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'violent', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'heart', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'treatment', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'Cyclops', 'Cyclops', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters.There', 'was', 'also', 'continuity', 'goof', 'film', 'regards', 'very', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'who', 'shown', 'STANDING', 'own', 'two', 'legs', 'even', 'scene', 'set', 'fairly', 'close', 'present', 'long', 'Xavier', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'could', 'be', 'explained', 'appearance', 'being', 'psychic', 'illusion', 'Xavier', 'readily', 'capable', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'typically', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'distinction', 'reality', 'what', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'projects', 'telepathically', 'flash', 'reality', 'appearance', 'very', 'little', 'sense.Probably', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'appearance', 'use', 'Gambit', 'Remy', 'LeBeau', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'steals', 'show', 'film', 'largely', 'absent', 'fan', 'favorite', 'mutants', 'Gambit', 'one', 'face', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'animated', 'series', 'can', 'relate']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

Sabertooth was never shown to be the truly evil monster that he is (there was a surprising lack of violence in this film). Wolverine himself is never shown being a true bad@$$ either--Logan had more exciting action scenes in ""X2"" than he did in his own movie! Also the third act of the film is fairly anticlimactic and rather than the ultimate Wolverine vs. Sabertooth battle fans have been waiting for, we get Victor & Jimmy battling a totally new character, which while this guy has some cool powers the battle with him lacks any emotional weight at all.The film was not without its highlights though. The all too brief encounter with Gambit was (aside from some ridiculous wire-fu moments) perfect. The origin of the ""Blob's"" name was a surprisingly good scene, Sabertooth vs. Wraith and Wade/Deadpool vs. a room full of bad guys with guns was also pretty spectacular. Fans of the comics and X-films also get a few more cool little moments sprinkled out through the film that I won't spoil here.The bottom line is this film definitely has flashes of brilliance that are too short and too brief to keep ""Wolverine"" from being the weakest and most disappointing addition yet to the X-Men film franchise.",3,X-Men fans--prepare to be underwhelmed.,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1394,"['X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'disappointing', 'film', 'several', 'reasons', 'mostly', 'broke', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'superhero', 'films', 'have', 'villain', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'hero', 'Sabertooth', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'be', 'truly', 'evil', 'monster', 'was', 'surprising', 'lack', 'violence', 'film', 'Wolverine', 'never', 'shown', 'being', 'true', 'bad', '@', 'Logan', 'had', 'more', 'exciting', 'action', 'scenes', 'X2', 'did', 'own', 'movie', 'Also', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'fairly', 'anticlimactic', 'rather', 'ultimate', 'Wolverine', 'Sabertooth', 'battle', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'get', 'Victor', 'Jimmy', 'battling', 'totally', 'new', 'character', 'guy', 'cool', 'powers', 'battle', 'emotional', 'weight', 'all.The', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'highlights', 'too', 'brief', 'encounter', 'Gambit', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'wire-fu', 'moments', 'perfect', 'origin', 'Blob', 'name', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'scene', 'Sabertooth', 'vs.', 'Wraith', 'Wade/Deadpool', 'room', 'full', 'bad', 'guys', 'guns', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'Fans', 'comics', 'X-films', 'also', 'get', 'few', 'more', 'cool', 'little', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'out', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'definitely', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'brief', 'keep', 'Wolverine', 'being', 'weakest', 'most', 'disappointing', 'addition', 'yet', 'X-Men', 'film', 'franchise']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

1195458,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001GCUO16,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[3, 5]","""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" got bashed pretty hard by critics when it opened, and I won't deny that it's not in a league with ""X-Men 2"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (what other comic book-based films are?), but viewing it on DVD, I found that I really wasn't disappointed in it, with much of the credit going to Hugh Jackman. He has such charisma and intensity that when he's onscreen, I find that plotholes don't bother me nearly as much...and this is certainly his best performance as Wolverine, yet.If anything, the film is guilty of trying to accomplish too much; trying to answer all of the questions raised in the first three films nearly guarantees that some depth will have to be sacrificed (and the filmmakers were well aware that this could well be the last film of the franchise, and wanted to tie up loose ends). But what emerges isn't just a resolution, but a new chapter, as well, with new characters (Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit are standouts), a love interest you actually cared about (Lynn Collins), and a terrific love/hate relationship between Logan and his brother, Victor/Sabertooth (Liev Schreiber). I won't deny, though, it was fun seeing Patrick Stewart, again, briefly reprising his role as Professor Xavier (and looking more youthful, thanks to CGI).From a boyhood discovering his 'gifts' in the Canadian Rockies of the 1840s, to an explosive 1970s climax at Three-Mile Island (ah, the real reason for the near melt-down!), the Wolverine saga certainly deserves more than a one-film 'wrap', but it is fun!Two Special Features are worth your attention, as well; a conversation between 'Wolverine' creater Len Wein and 'X-Men' creator Stan Lee is light-hearted and entertaining, with both giving sincere credit to Jack Kirby and Chris Clarement's involvement; and the 'Making Of' featurette is an often funny look of Jackman's total commitment to an exercise/diet regimen to be as 'bulked' as possible as Wolverine.

1195462,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B001GCUO16,blackaciddevil,"[5, 5]","I've been wanting to see a Wolverine movie that lives up to how the man is the comics. Too many times in the movies, characters are watered down to make them more appealing to those who aren't into comics so much and, because of this, comic book fans(like me) feel like we've been cheated. Thankfully, X-Men Origins: Wolverine etches that much closer to what Wolverine is in the comics and that makes this movie worthwhile in my books.X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the tales of how Wolverine came to be, with the story beginning in 1845. Young James Howlett sees his father killed by their groundskeeper Thomas Logan. This trauma brings about James mutation with bones protruding from his hands. He then proceeds to kill Thomas Logan. Before he does, however, Logan tells James that he is his father. He flees with Thomas' son, Victor Creed, who is his half-brother. That's where the movie begins. The conclusion is pretty epic, I assure you, but to find out- you'll have to watch the movie.In my opinion,this has to be Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. In what little time he's been Wolverine, he's taken the character and encompassed what he truly is. I know many were disappointed with this movie, in general, but I felt that it was a good(if not great) movie in the X-Men series(definitely better than X-Men First Class, even though this one came out long beforehand).I've read a sequel is in the works to this movie, simply called:The Wolverine. I've also read that the sequel might sport an R-rating. I'd really love to see that happen so that Wolverine fans can really see their beloved character 'cut loose'. I've only seen one other movie to ever really show a Marvel character for what it was and that was Punisher: War Journal(one I also recommend).

But then when I thought about it, I realized how bad it really was. On my first watch I thought that it was such a pleasure to watch the movie, but I was disappointed on my second watch. I've been reading several fan reviews on this movie and came to this conclusion. If you are a hardcore comic book fan of Wolverine or are looking for something new, you probably will be disgusted with what they did with the movie. If you aren't too familiar with the comic book stories of Wolverine or are just looking for some quick entertainment, this movie is for you. I find myself in between these two groups.Some positives of the movie were Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman was the best actor in the film. I was also so happy to see that complicated relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth that was absent from X1. Other characters that stood out were Gambit and WADE WILSON (NOT THE FILM'S VERSION OF DEADPOOL). Some people also said that the action and special effects were bad. I disagree to a certain point.Some negatives were the story. One minute the story seemed exciting, then it would fall flat on its face.

1195466,ALLVXWH9HCW2X,B001GCUO16,Bobo,"[1, 1]","It's not just that this movie is more filled with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the trilogy, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. Wolverine starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action.  But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that  mutant super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. The movie delivers enough story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. This movie and the action is just plain spectacular.One of the great things about this film is that virtually no screen time is spent on background character development. Like with last year's Incredible Hulk, the opening credits serve as a cool update and feeder for a basic origin. Even the newer characters that are introduced get very little time devoted to their past and it all works quite well. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information. Apparently the director figured this out and doesn't ""talk down""  to his audience even though it's an action film. The pace flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the story or the action. That's the key. As good as X2 was, Wolverine simply has better action without sacrificing the heart or character development or the emotion that made this franchise the juggernaut that it has turned out to be.This movie stands on its own, as its own Wolverine.  People who've never seen any of the other movies can go and see it and enjoy it. I saw it with two people that have never seen any X-Men stuff and they loved it. One of the year's best.

1195470,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001GCUO16,Caleb Williams,"[4, 8]","I like the Wolverine character. He's one of the original anti-heroes and is revered worldwide as an all out badass of ridiculous proportion. Apart from in a recent series of comics, the origins of the Wolverine character have never really been discussed so a movie about those origins I can imagine was a bit of a surprise for fans when it was announced. The real question being, just how are they going to take on the origins of such a complex character in the Marvel universe? Let's be honest it wasn't going to be an easy task. This film acts not just as a prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films but also as a stand alone film to give the fans of the X-Men films an idea of the history of this character and just how exactly he came to be.Starting off in 1845 a young James Howlett witnesses the murder of his father by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Shocked and angry, James' mutation (bone claws) is activated and he attacks and kills Logan. With his last breath Logan reveals that he is James' biological father. James flees the home with Logan's abused son Victor Creed and they both promise each other that they will always have each others back. Fast forward to when they are adults and they are approached by a young William Stryker who offers them a chance to join Team X. The brothers join but soon their questionable actions cause James to leave the group.6 years later, James is now known as Logan and is living with his girlfriend in Canada. He is approached by Stryker who warns him that someone is killing off each member of the original team. Victor is the one killing off the members and he is the one that kills Logan's girlfriend leading them into a brutal sibling rivalry. Stryker offers Logan a way of defeating Creed, joining the weapon X programme which will reinforce Logan's bones with the indestructible Adamantium. When Stryker attempts to wipe Logan's memory during the procedure Logan breaks free and vows to take revenge on Stryker and Victor. Logan needs to find Stryker's hidden laboratory known as ""The Island"" and he must enlist the help of the famous X-Man, Remy LeBeau (Gambit).The characters in the film are a very welcome additional fantasy and comic element to the X-Men movie universe. In the X films the characters, although maintaining the fantasy element, were a bit too serious for their own good. In this, in my opinion, they have taken on a more comic book element similar to the newest comic book movies such as Incredible Hulk and Iron Man. The characters don't take themselves too seriously which, in a film like this, is always a good thing. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine and although I did enjoy him in the X-Men films, I found he struggled slightly to keep my interest in the character for the entirety of the film.  Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth to the comic fans) was an inspired choice and I have to say a much preferred one to Tyler Mane who played the character in the X-Men movies. They both had a fantastic chemistry together during their fight scenes and general acting together. The brotherhood seems believable and it makes the film work when they are beating the hell out of each other.The other interesting characters that made this film work wonders are mainly the ones involved in Team X mainly displayed at the start of the film and, of course, the legendary Gambit. Ryan Reynolds made this film an enjoyable and light hearted piece of work as the character Wade Wilson or Deadpool to others. The funny one liners and general character demeanour made me wonder why Reynolds didn't have a larger part to play in the film as a whole. I can't help but think that the film would have been a bigger success in terms of critical ratings had he obtained a higher prominence in the film. Taylor Kitsch as Gambit achieves his goal of portraying the coolness of the character well, but doesn't match up to the brilliance of the comic interpretation. The young William Stryker played by Danny Huston isn't as intimidating as his X2 predecessor, Brian Cox, but does manage to play the manipulative role quite well.Some of the settings really don't work as well as you would think. A lot of the indoor sets look like the sets from what you would imagine to see in a cheap independent film. The special effects when used to their fullest extent work well but other times fell short (see the initial back alley fight between Logan & Gambit) and come across as if they were done at the last minute. The fight choreography between the two brothers is at times flawless and the best example of a great fighting scene is during the end of the movie which I wont reveal anything about as it's a must see.The film wasn't great. In fact the majority of the plot and dialogue was quite poor but my attention was brought back when the cool action would take place. Ryan Reynolds could have saved this film had his character been given a more prominent role throughout. The effects and settings work where they're supposed to but do fall flat at some points during the film. Jackman is a good choice as the Wolverine character, but he struggled slightly to hold the whole film as the character. We all learn from experience and where this film fell down may be repaired. A Sequel is apparently in the works and although we didn't see it in this instalment I do hope that we do, at some point, see Jackman put on the famous Blue & Yellow suit.",3,Nothing

The viewer never tires of watching him overcome one conflict after another. He commands empathy from the viewer and is in virtual control of the entire film from start to finish. Playing his brother, Liev Schreiber, also demonstrates his considerable skills playing a highly threatening, violent man-beast. We do learn the origin of Wolverine as young Jimmie Logan and his brother discover the gift of an animal nature within both of them and they exercise this violent side in the US Civil War, World War I and II, and the Vietnam conflict. The special effects were outstanding. The other members of the cast were totally superior, including wise cracking Ryan Reynolds and darkly beautiful Lynn Collins. The script was a bit too predictable. However, underneath all the millions of dollars of production and talent, there is a fascinating theme embodied in Wolverine, which is the struggle between the human and savage animal nature of mankind. Wolverine struggles with this duality but part of the fascination in watching Jackman is that at some level every viewer recognizes that we are all like Wolverine, constantly struggling to maintain our higher nature and control our most violent impulses. In this story, we see Jimmie Logan maintain control and seek serenity while his brother allows every violent animalistic impulse to rise to the surface and control his actions. But it is not just his brother who demonstrates a homicidal ruthless nature. Danny Huston plays a project director who will stop at nothing to control the gifts that have been given to the mutants. This is an entertaining film. It is not full of subtle nuance and is rather straight forward story-telling. Jackman and the rest of the cast make it special.",4,The wolf in man incarnation fascinates and scares us,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,1893,"['Hugh', 'Jackman', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'film', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'can', 'command', 'almost', 'scene', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'viewer', 'never', 'tires', 'watching', 'overcome', 'one', 'conflict', 'empathy', 'viewer', 'virtual', 'control', 'entire', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'Playing', 'brother', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'also', 'considerable', 'skills', 'playing', 'highly', 'threatening', 'violent', 'man-beast', 'do', 'learn', 'origin', 'Wolverine', 'young', 'Jimmie', 'Logan', 'brother', 'discover', 'gift', 'animal', 'nature', 'exercise', 'violent', 'side', 'US', 'Civil', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'outstanding', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'were', 'totally', 'superior', 'including', 'wise', 'cracking', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'script', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'predictable', 'However', 'millions', 'dollars', 'production', 'talent', 'fascinating', 'theme', 'embodied', 'Wolverine', 'struggle', 'human', 'savage', 'animal', 'nature', 'mankind', 'Wolverine', 'duality', 'part', 'fascination', 'watching', 'Jackman', 'level', 'viewer', 'are', 'like', 'Wolverine', 'constantly', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'higher', 'nature', 'control', 'most', 'violent', 'impulses', 'story', 'see', 'Jimmie', 'Logan', 'maintain', 'control', 'seek', 'serenity', 'brother', 'violent', 'animalistic', 'impulse', 'rise', 'surface', 'control', 'actions', 'not', 'just', 'brother', 'who', 'homicidal', 'ruthless', 'nature', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'project', 'director', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'control', 'gifts', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'mutants', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'full', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'rather', 'straight', 'forward', 'story-telling', 'Jackman', 'rest', 'cast', 'make', 'special']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

1195485,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001GCUO16,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 9]","Of the comic book characters I'm familiar with, which really isn't that many, I can't think of anyone I'd like to be less than Wolverine. What a depressing character, a man well over 100 years old who at one point or another loses everything he holds dear. He has no real home, no real friends, and no real family (with one exception, but we'll get into that later). Worse yet, he's a mutant, with retractable blades that emerge from his knuckles and the ability to regenerate damaged skin. Because of this, he's relentlessly pursued by the government, who, naturally, want to capture him and perform all sorts of nasty experiments. They succeed in one regard; he's injected with a special metal from outer space that makes his bones unbreakable. So not only is an outsider, he's also forced to live with being at outsider seemingly for all time. Compared to Wolverine, being Bruce Wayne is downright fun, especially with all that money at his disposal.As the title suggests, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" takes place before the events of the first three ""X-Men"" films and documents the history of the title character. It does a decent job explaining how he became so indestructible and why he's so miserable, but it fails to explain how he (or anyone else, for that matter) was born a mutant in the first place. Nor does it explain how he stopped aging or when it might have happened. Honestly, I had no idea Wolverine was such an old man. He discovered he was a mutant in 1845 when he was only a boy named James Logan, an event that coincided with the untimely death of his father. It also marked the start of a rivalry between him and his half-brother, Victor, who has fangs and claws and can run on all fours. As the years pass, we see them grow into primal warriors who were a part of many major wars, including the Civil War, both World Wars, and Vietnam. It's during the latter war that the story proper begins.After surviving a firing squad, Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) are approached by William Stryker (Danny Huston) and offered a chance to be part of a mutant military squad. The other members of the group: John Wraith/Kestrel (will.i.am), who can transport himself from one place to another in the blink of an eye; Chris Bradley/Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), who can manipulate electrically operated objects with his mind; Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand), who will eventually gain a lot of weight and become The Blob; David North/Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), who's lethal with a gun in each hand; and Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), a martial arts expert who can't seem to shut up, especially when it begins annoying everyone else. There comes a point where Logan has had enough of Stryker and decides to turn his back on the squad. This doesn't please Victor, who feels that brothers should stick together no matter what.Six years later, Logan's quiet life as a lumberjack is brutally interrupted when he learns that the squad members are being murdered one by one. This reunites him with Victor, who now goes by the name Sabretooth and is hell bent on punishing Logan. After a series of unpleasant encounters and unfortunate losses, Logan turns to Stryker, who takes him to a secret laboratory and oversees a complete molecular refit of his body. This includes a new set of stainless steel knives to replace the bony protrusions he was born with. It also includes a name change from Logan to Wolverine. Basically, he has unleashed the animal that was always lurking somewhere within, abandoning any notion of restraint and compassion.And that's pretty much where the story becomes a prolonged seek-and-destroy mission, which can only go so far before it stops being entertaining. You'd think that characters like Remy LeBeau/Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) or Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) would help enliven the film, but they don't. They are important characters, yet they aren't given the chance to contribute much to the story.To be fair, this movie will give action lovers and comic book fans everything they've been expecting. Just wait until the unveiling of Weapon XI, a strange looking mutant with a number of impressive superpowers. There's also a fun shot of Wolverine flying over a helicopter in slow motion, which happens just after being ejected from a fast-moving motorcycle.But spectacle comes easy in a film based on a comic book. What I really wanted was a more substantive story, something that could make the Wolverine character seem like more than an angry, brooding victim. I also would have appreciated a bit more insight as to how and why specific things came to be, mutants most of all. Regardless, I'm sure ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" will be a great financial success, appealing to those who want nothing more from their superhero movies than cool stunts and eye-popping visual effects. There's also a fair amount of humor, which is good because it saves the film from becoming an action-packed melodrama. Much of the audience's laughter was reserved for a brief boxing match between Wolverine and The Blob, whose proportions make him look more like a living beach ball. I didn't laugh quite as hard as everyone else, but in my defense, I was still thinking about all the bad things that happened earlier in the story.",3,The Brothers Mutant,1241136000,"05 1,

These are the same people who complain about every little thing.  We already know that Hollywood changes commic book movies around, so why get mad?  They may not have played it by the book, but at least we did get to see things that reminded me of the comic, like Wolverine's sheep lined jacket and the cigar!Like X-Men 3, we get a chance to see characters we probably would not have seen otherwise.  Like Deadpool, Emma Frost (I hopt they do the Hellfire Club...), Gambit and others.  Speaking of which, I never liked Gambit, but this film made me like him.  I could never see why people liked him.  I still don't see it, but at least like him on film!My only complaint is that it is only an hour and forty minutes.  However, the time seems longer as they did get everything they needed to into the film.  FOr the haters, the movie is about WOlverine and his life, not super action, although that is there too.  It is not about the other characters either.  Be happy they put so many others into thefilm instead of just Wolverine and Sabertooth.  Sbaertooth is another character I did not care for.This movie is worthy to be in my collection and stand beside X2.  In some ways it is better due to the fact that it came later.

Starring Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston and Dominic Monaghan, X-Men Origins Wolverine is the story before X-Men. It charts the beginnings for Wolverine also known as James Logan.When Logan, played by Jackman, accidentally kills his own father in a fit of rage and is looked upon as a freak by his mother, he leaves home to find his place in the world. With the help of his half-brother, Victor, better known as Sabertooth (Schreiber), Wolverine embarks on a journey through wars and time to fight the forces of evil. Sabertooth soon becomes consumed with bloodlust and in disgust, Wolverine sets out on his own.Years later, a mutant killer is on the loose and the government needs Wolverine's help to stop him. The indestructible Wolverine is then created. Inevitably, Wolverine is betrayed by those closest to him and he is then forced to take revenge & free the other enslaved mutants.I absolutely enjoyed this movie. It was in-your-face exciting and the fight scenes were amazing and well choreographed. Wolverine was action-packed from start to finish and it answered so many questions about where Wolverine came from before joining the X-Men.I would recommend this movie to all ages, young and old.

1195499,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B001GCUO16,Craig Whittle,"[1, 1]","X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINESTARRING: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Will I Am, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins and Ryan ReynoldsWRITTEN BY: David Benioff and Skip WoodsDIRECTED BY: Gavin HoodRated: PG-13Genre: Science Fiction / ActionRelease Date: 01 May 2009I'm not going to get into how far this film was from the comic books for two reasons. One is the review would never end and the second is, I don't really care because to me it's a prequel to the three X-Men films; not a comic book. From what I understand, fans of the comic found it to be devastatingly far from the true origin of Wolverine.The film opens with two young boys: James and Victor, growing up in Canada with super powers. Certain events happen and the boys leave home. Then at I guess whatever age the actors are in real life, (Hugh Jackman as James and Liev Schreiber as Victor), they stop aging; for whatever reason, this is never explained. And don't tell me it's disclosed in the comics, because this is not a comic book. It may be a comic-book-movie, but it's a movie nonetheless. And in a movie certain things need to be revealed. A sequel or prequel shouldn't rely on its previous installment alone, to fill in loose holes. Any film should be able to stand on its own.We know that they have stopped aging because as the opening credits roll, we see them fighting in several wars and we end the credit sequence at well over a hundred years from where we began. I guess they were tired of being Canadian because they eventually start fighting in American wars. Maybe they had dual citizenship?They are both in trouble with the military until a man named Stryker (Danny Huston) asks them if they want to join a special team. They join and the team is comprised of way too many super-mutant characters to keep track of.Next for no reason at all, Stryker starts calling James, Logan. I understand this was Wolverine's original name but it is never exposed to us why he is suddenly called Logan. The team becomes corrupt and Logan walks away. Victor isn't pleased.We fast forward six years to learn that Victor is apparently now bad and is murdering off the members of the team. I've seen the film twice now and with the exception of sheer boredom, I can't tell you why he does this.We learn why Logan is going to be called Wolverine and then Victor kills his girlfriend. Having nothing else to live for, Logan agrees to allow Stryker to spend ""half a billion dollars making him indestructible"" by injecting him with a special metal. Evidently, for a reason that is again not explained to us, Wolverine is the only one that can handle this painful operation. Then they get mad at each other and Stryker tries to have him killed, just minutes later. I guess the government doesn't audit this guy's allowance.The problem with this being a prequel is that we already know from seeing the first X-Men that at some point Wolverine is going to have to lose his memory. This takes a lot of the suspense out of the film and you won't believe how lame the idea is that they use to justify his memory loss.The thing that bothered me the most in the film was the horrible CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery). I am not generally a fan of CGI anyway. His claws looked like something out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; particularly in the scene of him checking himself out in the bathroom mirror. Last time I checked, technology has improved since the first three films, so what was the problem? The satire-filled commercials with Charles Barkley sprouting Wolverine like claws looked more realistic.There's even a CGI shot of Wolverine driving a motorcycle by the Las Vegas sign. Did they need this shot? If they did then why didn't they just have some no-name stunt guy ride by? The camera was so far away, we wouldn't have known if it was really Jackman or not anyway.There was also a shot of an elderly couple driving and the entire background was CGI. Why? These were two unknown actors. Why couldn't they have shot this sequence on location with any two actors? They clearly had Jackman there, running through the fields. And the elderly couple was only driving down their driveway for crying out loud; it wasn't dangerous!Nearly all of the action sequences looked fake. Wolverine flying through the air and landing on a helicopter looked like something out of a videogame instead of one of the most highly anticipated summer blockbusters.They even used CGI for dust in the motorcycle chase scene and when Wolverine was running through the woods with the helicopter shooting at him. Why? This is one of the most basic tricks in Hollywood, used for years; you set explosives in the ground, then you detonate them and it makes the dirt fly in the air, looking like bullets hitting the ground near the character. The exception would be the final action scene; it wasn't half bad.One of the things in the film that I did like was Hugh Jackman's portrayal as Wolverine. He was clearly born to play this part. He takes it very seriously and does a tremendous job; as he did in the other three films. Watch him in an interview and you will see that this character could not be any farther from the real Hugh Jackman.I also loved Liev Schreiber as the villain. He really got into character here. He is a tremendous actor and I have had my eye on him for years. He should be able to taste an Oscar because he's due one any time.Ryan Reynolds was great as always, but only in the film for a few minutes. And at last they put Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) in an X-Men film. I'm not sure if Kitsch was the ultimate choice for the role or not but he was descent. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with him and Wolverine together; but of course they tried to cram all of these other characters into the film who were boring. This movie did not have enough of Wolverine in it.I suspect the film was horribly written. The plot was weak and had too many holes. I don't know how they got these great actors to sign on for this film. Not to directly blame this on the writers, but I was so upset to see my favorite line from the trailer by Wolverine tarnished. It played great on the trailer but in the actual film they add a strong and un-needed swear word. I know Wolverine swears but the line was stronger without it.I obviously wasn't very impressed with the directing of the film either. I feel like the director (Gavin Hood) didn't take this project seriously. I have no idea how he landed this job. According to [...], the only major film he had ever directed was Rendition. How does one go from directing a mediocre film like Rendition, to directing a movie as huge as this? Sadly, Rendition is probably a bit better.",2,X-Men Origins: Wolverine Review,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,6671,"['X-MEN', 'ORIGINS', 'WOLVERINESTARRING', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Liev', 'Schreiber',

1195507,AIR1OLVTVMI3Y,B001GCUO16,Daniel Mendoza Villa,"[0, 2]","As Marvel's first in a planned line of ""origin"" stories, Wolverine appropriately starts back in 1845, when our hero is but a sickly pup in the wilds of Canada. Young James Howlett--get it, Howlett--unexpectedly sprouts spiny, bone-like claws in rage when the man he thinks is his father is killed by the man who actually is his father. It makes sense on screen, I swear. After murdering his real dad with a fist-first bum-rush, James runs off with his similarly mutated half-brother Victor Creed. The credit sequence shows the two taking part in one hundred years of conflict, from the regimented lines of the Civil War, all the way through to the horrors of Vietnam. The purpose of this is two-fold; we realize that the brothers have stuck together for over a century, but we also see them subtly growing apart. Played by Hugh Jackman for the fourth time now, James--now known as Logan--tries to rein in his animal nature, while his bro Victor (Liev Schreiber) lets loose with his primal instincts. The story begins in earnest when the two face the firing squad and, not unexpectedly, live to tell the tale.Wolverine goes into violently rage on Blu-ray with an impressive 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer. I'm not going to lie--the issues that so many people mentioned during the theatrical release are still here, clearly defined in high definition. Of course, I'm talking about the occasionally all-too-obvious CGI. That said, this is a review of the film's transfer, not the special effects, and as such, I just have to say that the film looks great on Blu-ray.The color palette is rich and vibrant; with a good sense of contrast overall and skin tones that are pleasingly warm. The picture can also be exceptionally sharp at times. Just check out Jackman's face as he sits in military prison--each pore, crease, and drop of sweat is rendered clearly. There are a few soft moments, specifically some of the long landscapes and the occasional medium shot, but most of the film is crisp and detailed, with fine textures apparent throughout.The title doesn't really exhibit the sense of depth that the best Blu-ray discs can offer, though, as the CGI can make the image look flat at times. But really, I have few complaints here. Black levels are well tuned throughout the film, and though there's no overt crush or grey soupiness, a few shots could stand to be tweaked darker or lighter. The opening scene did seem a little dim to me, but hey, it's lit mostly by candlelight.I'm giving the film a solid 8 out of 10, I do feel I have to take the CGI into account for the overall visual experience--but feel free to mentally slide the score up to 9 if needed, after all no major flaws in the BD.I'll be the first to admit that Wolverine got a tough break. Between studio interventions and a not-quite-finished work print being leaked online before the release, the film got a thorough critical lambasting before it even arrived in theaters, and that was kept in our minds also for the BD release. Hopefully, the inevitable sequel reportedly set during Logan's time in Japan, will learn from the movie's mistakes, and maybe even take a few lessons from The Dark Knight and Iron Man about how to tell an absorbing comic book story. Until then, Wolverine is a flawed but occasionally fun watch that looks fantastic in high definition, well, BD that is... sounds great with lossless audio, and fills out a 50-GB Blu-ray disc with enough special features to keep fans occupied for several hours, at least. The overall quality of the total package definitely warrants a recommendation, keeping in mind that this is not a perfect BD.",3,"""I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do isn't very nice.""",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,3620,"['Marvel', 'first', 'planned', 'line', 'origin', 'stories', 'Wolverine', 'appropriately', 'back', '1845', 'when', 'hero', 'sickly', 'pup', 'wilds', 'Canada', 'Young', 'James', 'Howlett', 'get', 'Howlett', 'unexpectedly', 'spiny', 'bone-like', 'claws', 'rage', 'when', 'man', 'father', 'killed', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'father', 'sense', 'screen', 'swear', 'murdering', 'real', 'dad', 'fist-first', 'bum-rush', 'James', 'off', 'similarly', 'mutated', 'half-brother', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'credit', 'sequence', 'two', 'taking', 'part', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'conflict', 'regimented', 'lines', 'Civil', 'War', 'way', 'horrors', 'Vietnam', 'purpose', 'two-fold', 'realize', 'brothers', 'have', 'stuck', 'together', 'century', 'also', 'see', 'subtly', 'growing', 'apart', 'Played', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'fourth', 'time', 'now', 'James', 'now', 'known', 'Logan', 'tries', 'rein', 'animal', 'nature', 'bro', 'Victor', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'loose', 'primal', 'instincts', 'story', 'earnest', 'when', 'two', 'face', 'firing', 'squad', 'not', 'unexpectedly', 'live', 'tell', 'tale.Wolverine', 'violently', 'rage', 'Blu-ray', 'impressive', '1080p/AVC-encoded', 'transfer', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'lie', 'issues', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'mentioned', 'theatrical', 'release', 'are', 'still', 'here', 'clearly', 'defined', 'high', 'definition', 'course', ""'m"", 'talking', 'occasionally', 'all-too-obvious', 'CGI', 'said', 'review', 'film', 'transfer', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'such', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'great', 'Blu-ray.The', 'color', 'palette', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'good', 'sense', 'contrast', 'overall', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'pleasingly', 'warm', 'picture', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'sharp', 'times', 'Just', 'check', 'out', 'Jackman', 'face', 'military', 'prison', 'pore', 'crease', 'drop', 'sweat', 'rendered', 'clearly', 'are', 'few', 'soft', 'moments', 'specifically', 'long', 'landscapes', 'occasional', 'medium', 'shot', 'most', 'film', 'crisp', 'detailed', 'fine', 'textures', 'apparent', 'throughout.The', 'title', ""n't"", 'really', 'exhibit', 'sense', 'depth', 'best', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'can', 'offer', 'though', 'CGI', 'can', 'make', 'image', 'look', 'flat', 'times', 'really', 'have', 'few', 'complaints', 'here', 'Black', 'levels', 'are', 'well', 'tuned', 'film', 'overt', 'crush', 'grey', 'soupiness', 'few', 'shots', 'could', 'stand', 'be', 'tweaked', 'darker', 'lighter', 'opening', 'scene', 'did', 'seem', 'little', 'dim', 'hey', 'lit', 'mostly', 'candlelight.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'solid', '8', '10', 'do', 'feel', 'have', 'take', 'CGI', 'account', 'overall', 'visual', 'experience', 'feel', 'free', 'mentally', 'slide', 'score', 'up', '9', 'needed', 'major', 'flaws', 'BD.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'Wolverine', 'got', 'tough', 'break', 'Between', 'studio', 'interventions', 'not-quite-finished', 'work', 'print', 'being', 'leaked', 'online', 'release', 'film', 'got', 'thorough', 'critical', 'lambasting', 'even', 'arrived', 'theaters', 'was', 'kept', 'minds', 'also', 'BD', 'release', 'Hopefully', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'reportedly', 'set', 'Logan', 'time', 'Japan', 'will', 'learn', 'movie', 'mistakes', 'maybe', 'even', 'take', 'few', 'lessons', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Iron', 'Man', 'how', 'tell', 'absorbing', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'then', 'Wolverine', 'flawed', 'occasionally', 'fun', 'watch', 'fantastic', 'high', 'definition', 'well', 'BD', 'great', 'lossless', 'audio', 'out', '50-GB', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'enough', 'special', 'features', 'keep', 'fans', 'occupied', 'several', 'hours', 'least', 'overall', 'quality', 'total', 'package', 'definitely', 'warrants', 'recommendation', 'keeping', 'mind', 'not', 'perfect', 'BD']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

If you think that invalidates my opinion of this film and that's going to put you off reading this review, then so long and happy trails, pilgrim.That said, I know of ""The X Men"" - read some of the comics as a kid, can identify the characters and had soaked up some vague knowledge of ""Wolverine's"" origins from somewhere. I saw the first ""X Men"" film at the cinema (yawned and winced my way through it), saw the second one on DVD (yawned and winced my way through that as well) and unintentionally saw the third one on TV over the weekend (and actually quite enjoyed it, the change of director, the increasing moral ambiguity and the increased level of peril to the muties made for a much more enjoyable experience).I initially had no desire to see ""Wolverine"", but the change in tone of the third film made me think that there might be something in it. So I rented it.My Two Cents?Its good stuff. Let me qualify that. Its good stuff if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, CGI filled Hollywood blockbuster (which was actually filmed in NSW - go skips!) in which lots of things blow up. The fact that it's an origin tale also helped as I'm a sucker for a good origin story.Hugh Jackman, by his own admission, wanted to take this one to darker places and he does so with aplomb. He also has the perfect foil in Liev Schrieber's ""Sabretooth"", who turns out to be the catalyst that ultimately sends him down the road to becoming the man with the cuisinart claws. It has some nice twists in it and some great cameos by other mutants that I vaguely remembered from sunny afternoons spent reading Marvel comics in the back-garden as a child. There's also a deeply amusing riff on the nature of what really happened at ""Three Mile Island"".That said, I did wince twice (did we really need the glib shot of Wolfboy walking away stone-faced from an exploding helicopter or the obligatory crane shot of him looking up to the sky and yelling ""NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"" at the heavens? I mean, come on - those were already bad cliches when both the universe AND Dick Clark were young)Will you enjoy it?Well, take the following as a litmus test.I've hated all three of the ""Spiderman"" films, the first two ""X-Men"" films and the first ""Hulk"" movie.However, I really, really enjoyedIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)and really enjoyedThe Incredible Hulk (Three-Disc Special Edition)(the one with Ed Norton where, you know, you actually got to see the Hulk smash some stuff up?) and quite enjoyed this film.So my cards are on the table and from them you can make your own call, hombre.",4,Probably The Best Of The Lot...,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,2616,"['First', ""'m"", 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'fanboy', 'think', 'invalidates', 'opinion', 'film', 'going', 'put', 'off', 'reading', 'review', 'then', 'so', 'long', 'happy', 'trails', 'pilgrim.That', 'said', 'know', 'X', 'Men', 'read', 'comics', 'kid', 'can', 'identify', 'characters', 'had', 'soaked', 'up', 'vague', 'knowledge', 'Wolverine', 'somewhere', 'saw', 'first', 'X', 'Men', 'film', 'cinema', 'yawned', 'winced', 'way', 'saw', 'second', 'one', 'DVD', 'yawned', 'winced', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'unintentionally', 'saw', 'third', 'one', 'TV', 'weekend', 'actually', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'change', 'director', 'increasing', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'increased', 'level', 'peril', 'muties', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experience', '.I', 'initially', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'Wolverine', 'change', 'tone', 'third', 'film', 'made', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'So', 'rented', 'it.My', 'Two', 'Cents', 'good', 'stuff', 'Let', 'qualify', 'good', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'mood', 'big', 'dumb', 'CGI', 'filled', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'NSW', 'go', 'skips', 'lots', 'things', 'blow', 'up', 'fact', 'origin', 'tale', 'also', 'helped', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'good', 'origin', 'Jackman', 'own', 'admission', 'wanted', 'take', 'one', 'darker', 'places', 'so', 'aplomb', 'also', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'Sabretooth', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'catalyst', 'ultimately', 'down', 'road', 'becoming', 'man', 'cuisinart', 'claws', 'nice', 'twists', 'great', 'cameos', 'other', 'mutants', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'sunny', 'afternoons', 'spent', 'reading', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'back-garden', 'child', 'also', 'deeply', 'amusing', 'riff', 'nature', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Three', 'Mile', 'Island', 'said', 'did', 'wince', 'twice', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'glib', 'shot', 'Wolfboy', 'walking', 'away', 'stone-faced', 'exploding', 'helicopter', 'obligatory', 'crane', 'shot', 'looking', 'up', 'sky', 'yelling', 'NOOOOOOOOOO', 'heavens', 'mean', 'come', 'were', 'already', 'bad', 'cliches', 'when', 'universe', 'AND', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'were', 'young', 'Will', 'enjoy', 'Well', 'take', 'following', 'litmus', 'test.I', ""'ve"", 'hated', 'three', 'Spiderman', 'films', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'first', 'Hulk', 'movie.However', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyedIron', 'Man', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'really', 'enjoyedThe', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Three-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'one', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'where', 'know', 'actually', 'got', 'see', 'Hulk', 'smash', 'stuff', 'up', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'film.So', 'cards', 'are', 'table', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'call', 'hombre']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

1195516,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001GCUO16,David J. Brown,"[0, 2]","Well, I thought I might, but as the credits rolled on the first official summer film of '09, I realized I really didn't.  The way the origin was set up or rather alluded to in the previous X-Men installments was far more interesting then this film's blow by blow of the specific events that created the Logan we all know and love.  Sure, I used to read X-Men comics as a middle schooler so I already knew how Wolverine became Wolverine, but I never realized how much  the mystery of Wolverine was more entertaining without the details until I saw this film.No plot synopsis...there's not much plot to this film anyway.The plot to this current Marvel film is very small and uninspired.  The majority of the film is made up of the relationships or rather the meloncholy melodrama Wolverine has with his half brother, his wife, and General Stryker.  The plot doesn't kick in until about the forty minute mark.  Honestly, once the plot wheels get greased and rolling the film becomes less and less involving.  Even the action sequences were ho-hum.  Which is surprising, because so much dark conflict is built into them they should have severe impact similar to that of The Dark Knight, but they just ring hollow and routine.  I really, for the life of me, can't pull a single memorable image from any of the pyrotechnics involved in this film's story.  Considering that where the majority of the budget goes on these films, that's not a good thing.The acting is all fine.  Liev Shrieber brings an adequetely menacing presence as Wolverine's half brother Victor.  How we're supposed to believe that this well-spoken and sadistic maniac turns into the lumbering oaf that was Sabertooth in X-Men part one maybe the next film's major mystery.  Ryan Reynolds shows up briefly to play the character of Wade.  It's so brief that when he(or rather a stuntman under heavy prosthetics) returns in the finale you have to take a few seconds to realise it's him, or at least listen very closely to some dubbed dialogue to further drive the point home.  Which is another problem.  The whole film sets up this major conflict between Logan and Victor and then drops it in favor of a mega showdown with Deadpool.  A character whose creation is rushed into the narrative at the last hour, and holds no emotional ties to Wolverine and ends up being a big, but hollow, special effects light show.  Bummer.  With all the pathos this film contains the ending really could've sealed the deal for this film.Marvel now oversees the productions of all its characters' film adaptions.  Sometimes this is a good thing(Iron-Man), sometimes not so much(The Incredible Hulk).  Did we really need to be introduced to Deadpool, Gambit and Cyclops in this film?  Nope!  Sure, the fanboys had joygasms in unisen when they showed up, but the rest of us who put their comics away years ago, got nothing out of it but a slight crinkle in the upper left side of the cheek.  The actor who plays Gambi, can't think of his name, does an admirable job of hinting at the type of character he may be or become in future installments.  Nothing outrageously speical, but that has more to do with the writing and less to do with the acting.  He's adequetly charming for the part.  We also get some scraps in the form of other Marvel characters, none of us average Joes give a crap about like The Blob, The Wraith and Silverfox and others....Hugh Jackman was born to play this role.  Yes, fanboys will go on and on about how he's too tall and not squat like a wolverine(lol), but he embodies the pathos and physicality and strength of character I remember from my comic years.  I want more Jackman Wolverine but I want a better written film to go with it.The bottom line is, the film is passable or better yet servicable fluff fair.  You won't remember much about it after its over and it's about equal to the first X-Men film, but not quite up to par with the second or third film, or other Marvel Universe films released.  It's a good companion piece with Ghost Rider and The Incredible Hulk, good enough but nothing special.PS: Is anyone else out there sad that the first major films of the summer are sequels(Terminator:Salvation), re-boots AKA remakes(Star Trek) and spin-offs(Wolverine)?  It's starting to depress me.  I've heard great things about the upcoming Terminator and Star Trek and hopefully I'll like them, but damn, could we get something original in the E.R. stat!?!?!?!?",3,Did anyone honestly give much of a crap about the details of Wolverine's origins?,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,4437,"['Well', 'thought', 'might', 'credits', 'rolled', 'first', 'official', 'summer', 'film', ""'09"", 'realized', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'origin', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'rather', 'alluded', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'installments', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'film', 'blow', 'blow', 'specific', 'events', 'created', 'Logan', 'know', 'love', 'Sure', 'used', 'read', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'middle', 'schooler', 'already', 'knew', 'how', 'Wolverine', 'became', 'Wolverine', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'mystery', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'more', 'entertaining', 'details', 'saw', 'film.No', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'film', 'anyway.The', 'plot', 'current', 'Marvel', 'film', 'very', 'small', 'uninspired', 'majority', 'film', 'made', 'relationships', 'rather', 'meloncholy', 'melodrama', 'Wolverine', 'half', 'brother', 'wife', 'General', 'Stryker', 'plot', ""n't"", 'kick', 'forty', 'minute', 'mark', 'Honestly', 'once', 'plot', 'wheels', 'get', 'greased', 'rolling', 'film', 'less', 'less', 'involving', 'Even', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'ho-hum', 'Which', 'surprising', 'so', 'much', 'dark', 'conflict', 'built', 'should', 'have', 'severe', 'impact', 'similar', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'just', 'ring', 'hollow', 'routine', 'really', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'single', 'memorable', 'image', 'pyrotechnics', 'involved', 'film', 'story', 'Considering', 'where', 'majority', 'budget', 'films', 'not', 'good', 'thing.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'Liev', 'Shrieber', 'adequetely', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Wolverine', 'half', 'brother', 'Victor', 'How', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'well-spoken', 'sadistic', 'maniac', 'lumbering', 'oaf', 'was', 'Sabertooth', 'X-Men', 'part', 'one', 'maybe', 'next', 'film', 'major', 'mystery', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'up', 'briefly', 'play', 'character', 'Wade', 'so', 'brief', 'when', 'rather', 'stuntman', 'heavy', 'prosthetics', 'returns', 'finale', 'have', 'take', 'few', 'seconds', 'realise', 'least', 'listen', 'very', 'closely', 'dubbed', 'dialogue', 'further', 'drive', 'point', 'home', 'Which', 'problem', 'whole', 'film', 'up', 'major', 'conflict', 'Logan', 'Victor', 'then', 'drops', 'favor', 'mega', 'showdown', 'Deadpool', 'A', 'character', 'creation', 'rushed', 'narrative', 'last', 'hour', 'emotional', 'ties', 'Wolverine', 'up', 'being', 'big', 'hollow', 'special', 'effects', 'light', 'show', 'Bummer', 'pathos', 'film', 'ending', 'really', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sealed', 'deal', 'film.Marvel', 'now', 'productions', 'characters', 'film', 'adaptions', 'Sometimes', 'good', 'thing', 'Iron-Man', 'sometimes', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'introduced', 'Deadpool', 'Gambit', 'Cyclops', 'film', 'Nope', 'Sure', 'fanboys', 'had', 'joygasms', 'unisen', 'when', 'showed', 'up', 'rest', 'who', 'put', 'comics', 'away', 'years', 'ago', 'got', 'nothing', 'slight', 'crinkle', 'upper', 'left', 'side', 'cheek', 'actor', 'who', 'Gambi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'name', 'admirable', 'job', 'hinting', 'type', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'become', 'future', 'installments', 'Nothing', 'outrageously', 'speical', 'more', 'do', 'writing', 'less', 'do', 'acting', 'adequetly', 'charming', 'part', 'also', 'get', 'scraps', 'form', 'other', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'none', 'average', 'Joes', 'give', 'crap', 'Blob', 'Wraith', 'Silverfox', 'others', 'Jackman', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'Yes', 'fanboys', 'will', 'go', 'how', 'too', 'tall', 'not', 'squat', 'wolverine', 'lol', 'pathos', 'physicality', 'strength', 'character', 'remember', 'comic', 'years', 'want', 'more', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'want', 'better', 'written', 'film', 'go', 'it.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'passable', 'better', 'yet', 'servicable', 'fluff', 'fair', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'about', 'equal', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'second', 'third', 'film', 'other', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'films', 'released', 'good', 'companion', 'piece', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'good', 'enough', 'nothing', 'special.PS', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'sad', 'first', 'major', 'films', 'summer', 'are', 'sequels', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 're-boots', 'AKA', 'remakes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'spin-offs', 'Wolverine', 'starting', 'depress', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'upcoming', 'Terminator', 'Star', 'Trek', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'like', 'damn', 'could', 'get', 'something', 'original', 'E.R', 'stat']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

So first, my credentials-  I am a huge comic fanatic and own thousands of x-men and wolverine comics that I have been collecting for well over 20 years.  I also enjoyed the original x-men movie, liked number 2 better, and thought the last stand was very good on its own, but it messed around with the comic storyline too much for my tastes.  I really believe ""the last stand"", on its own would be considered great otherwise.Now,  Wolverine.  I saw it in the movies, and got it on Blu Ray.  First, it is exciting as heck. It moves at breakneck speed and the battles are terrific.  Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan.  The story is pretty impressive.  I thought the script was intelligent, and the acting outstanding.  And it kept fairly close to the story line of the comic, probably as much as it could given that it is a movie. I have no idea what people are looking for.  They talk about it just being loud dumb and forgettable, and it is anything but.Wolvering is the best action picture of 2009, better than 2008's Iron Man (I don't care what anyone says- Explain to me Why Wolverine is not great but Iron Man is, which was lots of action, and what else really, except some anti-war soul searching which is standard fare and treated with more complexity in a coloring book for 5 year olds).  Wolverine is maybe not as deep as the Dark Knight because it did not deal with themes as complex as those in the Dark Knight, but it certainly deals with heartbreaking loss, heartbreak and vengenace in a compelling and intelligent (not to mentoin exciting fashoion) designed to cover as much of the origin story as is reasonably possible for a movie.Hugh Jackman was terrific as Logan, and LIev Schreiber was terrific as Victor Creed.  Lengendary villain if I ever saw one.  Yet I hear nothing about his acting chops.  Some of the characters like Gambit, who is an outstanding character in his own right, are given a more perfunctory treatment, probably because at some point you can't have a movie that's 17 hours long.I truly believe that if you are sitting on the fence trying to figure out whether to get it or not based on the reviews, GET IT!.  Sit back and enjoy it.  It is an outstanding action film that hews fairly (although not completely) close to the comic.

An informative featurette in regards to the comic books.  For some reason, I felt that Stan Lee was not his jovial self.* Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins - (12:02) Interviews with the director, producers, Hugh Jackman in regards to shooting the film, origins of Wolverine, training, making his claws and the set.* Weapon X Files - This segment features each talent in character talking about themselves and then we hear from the director/producer about what they wanted to accomplish with their character and special effects that went into the making of that character.  Probably my favorite was the featurette on Kevin Durand's Blob and what went into making the fat suit.- Victor Creed/Sabretooth (7:25)- William Stryker (4:25)- John Wraith (4:15)- Kayla Silverfox (3:26)- Fred Dukes/Blob (7:18)- Bradley (3:18)- Remy Lebeau/Gambit (9:08)- Agent Zero (3:45)- Wade Wilson/Deadpool (7:10)- Emma (Kayla's Sister) (3:25)* The Thrill of the Chase: The Helicopter Sequence - (5:53) The making of the helicopter sequence.* Ultimate X-Mode - While watching the film, viewers can watch the director, producers and cast talking about the film via picture-in-picture.* Deleted & Alternate Scenes - (9:30) With optional commentary by director Gavin Hood, Hood introduces four deleted and alternate scenes which include: Young Storm, Victor at the boxing ring, Alternate Memory Erase Sequence and a Japanese Bar Scene.* Fox Movie Channel Presents: World Premiere - (6:20) The ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" debut in Tempe, Arizona (The contest winners of where the red carpet premiere took place).* X-Men on Blu-ray: Trailers for X-Men Trilogy and ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"".* BD-Live Lookup - With a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player, viewers can access up-to-date information on actor filmographies, information related to ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" on imdb (The Internet Movie Database).JUDGMENT CALL:I literally grew up with the ""X-Men"" and ""Wolverine"" comic books when I was younger.  During the 80's, you had your American superheroes but Wolverine represented a character that was just exciting, deadly and literally kickass.Since the release of the three X-Men films, I have no doubt in my mind that Hugh Jackman was the best casting decision made for the character.  He embodies the character completely and the amount of discipline he puts in working out and being Logan is just incredible and it shows in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".For the most part, the film is full of action and full of characters.  The excitement is there, the killer instinct of both Logan and Victor are there and of course, we have pre-Deadpool Wade Wilson in the film as well, along with many other characters that makes this film fun and exciting.  And to feature a storyline that revolves around Logan's origin is not easy.  After all, having followed the comic books for so long, I think even writers had their challenge of how the Weapon X program would be and even today, just seeing how things have evolved with the program is just staggering.  So, before watching the film, I did have my reservations of how muddled the plot could be.Fortunately, the filmmakers took a different approach and created their own storyline with some aspects of the comic book still part of the storyline.  Keeping things simple and for the most part, for those who are not familiar with the comic books, at least exciting enough to understand where Logan came from and why he and Victor have had this dysfunctional relationship.For the most part, Jackman is just great as Logan/Wolverine and Liev Schreiber can always play the definitive bad ass.  Danny Huston as Stryker was quite effective and Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox did a great job as well.  As for Taylor Kitsch (""Friday Night Lights"") as Remy Lebeau/Gambit, that was quite interesting but for the most part, I felt that Kitsch did a good job albeit the thick French accent that Gambit exhibits in the comic books and people are so used to hearing from the X-Men animated series.  The others have small roles such as ""LOST"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" actor Dominic Monaghan as Bradley and Black Eyed Peas member Will.i.am also ventures to the acting world, appearing onscreen (instead of voice as he did in ""Madagascar 2').  But one of the exciting parts of this film was seeing the Blob (Kevin Durand) and of course, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds).  It was great to see on the Blu-ray of how they came up with the Blob's outfit and of course, having Wade Wilson in the film.  It's important to note that if you are a fan of Wade Wilson, make sure you watch through the ending credits.With all my gushing about how much I enjoy this film, one must wonder if I have any negatives.  Well, what I didn't like about the film was the overuse of CG, in which some scenes looked a bit too unrealistic.  Also, the tweaking of the Wade Wilson character was a bit too much for my taste.  I can understand some hardcore fans who may have a problem with the comic book continuity and how the film has quite a few differences but personally, many super hero films has its differences from its comic book counterpart that its not surprising anymore.  As long as the soul of the characters are intact and the storyline is well-presented, it's good enough for me.As for the Blu-ray release, the film definitely gets a wonderful HD transfer as picture and audio quality is solid.  A good number of special features are included, as well as a slipcase and a digital copy of the film.With that being said, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a good superhero film with a lot of action.  Was it as deep and entertaining like ""The Dark Knight Returns"", my answer is no.  But I definitely enjoyed it more than the third X-Men film and even the ""Hulk"" related films.  I felt that the storyline focused on Logan/Wolverine, his rivalry with Victor Creed quite well.  If anything, it's the CG that tends to be overdone at times that bothered me a bit but for the most part, I did enjoy watching the film.But after watching the awesome Blu-ray version and seeing the film in High Definition and watching the special features, that actually enhanced my perspective towards the film.  A lot went into the making of this film and to see that Hugh Jackman did most of his own stunts, that is incredible.Overall, if you are a fan of Wolverine and the previous X-Men films, definitely give ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" a try.  Definitely worth recommending!",4,"Blu-ray: Enjoyed the film, enjoyed the PQ and AQ and the special features as well!",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,9551,"['X-Men', 'films', 'becoming', 'too',

As it's something that i've read in his comic book series and through the X-Men as well.  So for me that wasn't an issue.  It was good seeing them bring some stand characters in Deadpool, Agent Zero and of course Sabretooth played very good by Liev Schrieber.  Col. Stryker is his typical, mutant loving/hating self and is obviously using Wolverine to get his powers so that he can build the ultimate mutant killer.  The action is solid, intense and in your face which is just how it should be.  Wolverine is one of my favorite X-Men and this movie only serves to amplify that.It should also be noted that Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds is getting his own spin-off through this movie.  Gambit is played very well by Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and hope that they decide to go more into his back story as well.  Because he has a lot also (Rogue anyone?).

1195526,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B001GCUO16,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 8]","""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""(20th Century Fox, 2009)----------------------------------------I've seen lot of reviews complaining that this movie was all special effects and too little plot.  Personally, that's just fine with me. I think the biggest problem with most superhero blockbusters (to date, with the exception of ""Iron Man"") is that they have too much plot, and not enough action. Film after dreadful film has come out, each one more top-heavy and pretentious than the other, and as someone who has been reading DC and Marvel comics since 1971, I've just gritted my teeth and waited for them to get all that blah-blah-blah stuff out of their system and start making movies that are as fast-moving and fun as the comics themselves.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a big step in the right direction. It's action-packed, thrilling and mercifully light on leaden exposition: there's not a lot of time wasted explaining every little thing or trying to (verbally) impress us with the holy-cow awesome awesomeness of what we are about to witness. Show, don't tell. That works a lot better.Yes, there are inconsistencies and quirks (Wolverine's heightened sense of smell, for example, seems to desert him at several key moments) and yes, at times there are things that could be better explained (Gambit's powers, for example.) The biggest problem is that the main bad guy, Col. Stryker, is pretty boring and gets old quick, but this is balanced by a great performance by Liev Schreiber, who is consistently creepy and menacing as Wolverine's nemesis, Sabretooth. Also, the script -- in what has become a Hollywood traditional -- needlessly muddies up the original continuity from the comicbooks. But, whatever. It's just a superhero movie.Mostly, these are just quibbles. This film zooms nicely along and has far more action in it than any superhero movie to date, which is a good thing. Although it's exhausting to watch, it's also exciting, and frankly, I think that's what fans want, not some lame attempt to turn dopey kid's stuff into high art. Finally! Bring on the mayhem!Nerd-fan postscript: Since this film is set in the past and doesn't immediately link Wolverine to the present-day X-Men team, I'd totally be up for a non-X Men sequel that has Wolvie becoming a SHIELD super-spy or learning all his ninja tricks, or whatever.

This is one of those ""it's all about the money folks"" type of deals. The producers know that no matter how bad a particular product will be, there will be hordes of consumers ready and willing to give up their greenbacks to satisfy their appetite for cheap entertainment. Well, it was expensive for the filmmakers at least. [...]Perhaps I'm being too harsh, judging this flick against The Dark Knight and Watchmen is bad form. Wolverine should be judged against the X-Men flicks, all of which are far more variable in quality than Dark Knight or Watchmen. But even against the X-Men movies, Wolverine fails handily. In the X-Men trilogy, Wolverine was strangely the main character even though he had no right to be. He is not leader of the X-Men, he is an outsider but he was always taking up most of the screentime because he's the most popular and in films full of fantastical superpowers, he was the only identifiable character for the audience.Ok then, audiences want the focus on Wolverine, give them a spin-off. So in this Wolverine origin movie we should rightfully get the spotlight almost exclusively on Logan and instead much screentime is wasted parading a whole gaggle of extras when it should just have Sabretooth as the main villain and that's it. We don't need an extra dozen characters! Perhaps the most offensive character in the film was this movie version of Deadpool which had almost nothing to do with the real Deadpool. When I was a kid, Deadpool was my favorite Marvel character, well him and Wolverine that is. Hearing that Deadpool would make a big appearance in this film I looked forward to it all the while knowing that Hollywood would screw it up big time and screw up they have! Casting Ryan Reynolds was mistake number one but fine, give the actor a chance. But why does Deadpool look like some reject version of Baraka from the Mortal Kombat videogame series when Deadpool in the comic has one of the sharpest, flashiest designs in the Marvel universe?The insipid blandness of this whole movie just irks me. The chase scenes and action were all second-rate. The helicopter attack with the blades was one of the few genuine fun moments of the movie. The climactic battle scene on Three Mile Island was a case of we've seen this a million times before. The movie was still a blockbuster, made plenty of money but not enough I think to warrant another Wolverine film. Time to retire this franchise. I'm still up for a standalone Deadpool movie, provided that it has nothing to do with this travesty.",2,"""The Dark Knight and ""Watchmen"" have raised the bar.

1195536,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001GCUO16,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[7, 12]","After three movies of amnesia and claw-slashing, Wolverine is actually getting his own movie, all for his own. Sure, some familiar characters appear, but the stage is for him alone.And it's neither a horrendous movie nor a good one -- just a popcorn collection of explosions and Matrixian fight scenes, linked together by a rather loosely-strung plot that doesn't have any twists or unexpected events. Hugh Jackman does a simply stellar job as the beclawed titular character and it has some funny moments, but the part of the movie that galvanized me the most was the trailer for ""District 9.""After a century of fighting, James Logan (Jackman) and his savage half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are recruited by a mysterious army officer, William Stryker (Danny Huston), to join his elite mutant squad. Logan is sick of killing, so he tries to have the quiet life with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a humble logger... until Victor reappears and murders Kayla, as part of a vendetta against his old teammates. Intent on revenge, Logan accepts the offer Stryker gives him -- he will accept a horrible and painful procedure that will make him invincible, so he can kill Victor.With an adamantium skeleton and an instantly-healing body, the newly-renamed Wolverine is invincible -- but he soon finds himself on the run not only from his older brother, but from Stryker's ruthless military forces. Now he must uncover a mysterious ""island"" that only one mutant has ever escaped from... except there are some other nasty surprises waiting for him there, courtesy of Stryker's experiments.By all rights, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" should have been a far better movie than it is. But the story itself is only so-so -- it's rather straightforward in its narrative without many twists, and the Sabretooth/Wolverine backstory is handled pretty confusingly. It's only in the last quarter that the movie really acquires that epic comic-book feeling -- up until then, it's a rather bland you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and ""Origins"" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies. And Schreiber does an excellent job as well, especially considering that Sabretooth is as likable as an ingrown nail -- he actually almost makes us feel sorry for his character now and then. Too bad we never, uh, really figure out why he wants to kill his brother.And there's a lot of great lesser roles as well -- Collins does a decent job considering her total lack of chemistry with Jackman, while the coldly contemptuous Daniel Henney, kindly will.i.am, charming gambler Kitsch and puckish Dominic Monaghan all do great jobs with their smaller-scale roles. Huston is okay, but he never quite seems scary or fanatical enough.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has enough explosions, stunts and elaborate aerial fight scenes to shame most blockbusters, but it's lacking heart and plot.

1195541,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001GCUO16,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 8]","I don't think this strenuous 2009 offshoot of theX-Menseries should be dismissed entirely, but it really doesn't contribute much to the genre the wayIron ManandThe Dark Knightdid last year. Both of those films set a high water mark for comic book franchises, and unfortunately director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) can't seem to get his filmmaking arms around what would make Wolverine a compelling character over the course of 107 minutes. Don't blame Hugh Jackman, who puts in a valiant effort now in his fourth familiar turn in the title role. Addressing the inner demons of a conflicted character should have been within Hood's oeuvre given his previous serious-minded work, but he seems overwhelmed by the film's persistent blockbuster aspects. Fight scenes seem identical with each other, and there are lots of them here, so much so that the net result is more wearing than enthralling with the choreography and special effects looking the same from scene to scene. There are also new characters constantly introduced, each with some unique superpower of dubious distinction, so the story starts to feel like a springboard for yet more franchises.Given that I am not familiar with the X-Men series, I will trust that screenwriters David Benioff (The Kite Runner) and Skip Woods have remained faithful to the comic book with the convoluted storyline, a true chore to follow for the uninitiated like myself. The opening sequence shows Wolverine as a sickly child sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Along with his brother Victor, he has apparently fought every major war since the Civil War, both getting killed and resuscitated for their next enlistment. The immortality aspect is probably the most problematic aspect of the story since it really doesn't give the viewer any legitimate reason to be concerned with Wolverine's ultimate fate. Consequently, the story focuses the conflict more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant. This inner turmoil tears the brothers apart since Victor cannot forgive his brother for deserting the military. However, living peacefully as a poor lumberjack in Canada with his comely schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla does not prevent him from being drawn back to the cause as a member of an elite mutant unit due to the persistent efforts of Colonel Stryker.Even if abject alienation is still not his forte, Jackman does what he can with a rage-filled cardboard role that requires him to alternate between vindictive and sympathetic in lightning flashes. In an exasperating turn, Liev Schreiber has even less latitude as Victor (a.k.a. Sabretooth) since we never figure out why he turns so completely malevolent. Danny Huston fares better as Stryker since the character is rich in Machiavellian tendencies that are easy to root against. Lynn Collins plays an ambiguously dichotomous role similar to Eva Green's in the James Bond vehicle,Casino Royale, and Ryan Reynolds has a near-cameo role as yet another comic book franchise in the making. He provides some much needed comic relief, but it's not enough to offset the constant mayhem. The explosion-driven helicopter chase and the relentless fight atop the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor are the only set pieces that linger in the memory. The rest of the movie will have greater resonance for devoted fans of the comic book.",3,A Convoluted and Wearing Flick Despite Jackman's Familiar Seething and Clawing,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,3363,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'strenuous', '2009', 'offshoot', 'theX-Menseries', 'should', 'be', 'dismissed', 'entirely', 'really', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'much', 'genre', 'wayIron', 'ManandThe', 'Dark', 'Knightdid', 'last', 'year', 'films', 'set', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'Tsotsi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'filmmaking', 'arms', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'Wolverine', 'compelling', 'character', 'course', '107', 'minutes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'valiant', 'effort', 'now', 'fourth', 'familiar', 'turn', 'title', 'role', 'Addressing', 'inner', 'demons', 'conflicted', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Hood', 'oeuvre', 'given', 'previous', 'serious-minded', 'work', 'overwhelmed', 'film', 'persistent', 'blockbuster', 'aspects', 'Fight', 'scenes', 'seem', 'identical', 'other', 'are', 'lots', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'net', 'result', 'more', 'wearing', 'enthralling', 'choreography', 'special', 'effects', 'looking', 'same', 'scene', 'scene', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'characters', 'constantly', 'introduced', 'unique', 'superpower', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'story', 'feel', 'springboard', 'yet', 'more', 'franchises.Given', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'X-Men', 'series', 'will', 'trust', 'screenwriters', 'David', 'Benioff', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'Skip', 'Woods', 'have', 'remained', 'faithful', 'comic', 'book', 'convoluted', 'storyline', 'true', 'chore', 'follow', 'uninitiated', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Wolverine', 'sickly', 'child', 'sometime', 'middle', '19th', 'century', 'brother', 'Victor', 'apparently', 'fought', 'major', 'war', 'Civil', 'War', 'getting', 'killed', 'resuscitated', 'next', 'enlistment', 'immortality', 'aspect', 'probably', 'most', 'problematic', 'aspect', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'give', 'viewer', 'legitimate', 'reason', 'be', 'concerned', 'Wolverine', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'Consequently', 'story', 'conflict', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'soldiering', 'government', 'growing', 'identification', 'mutant', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'brothers', 'apart', 'Victor', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'brother', 'deserting', 'military', 'However', 'living', 'peacefully', 'poor', 'lumberjack', 'Canada', 'comely', 'schoolteacher', 'girlfriend', 'Kayla', 'not', 'prevent', 'being', 'drawn', 'back', 'cause', 'member', 'elite', 'mutant', 'unit', 'due', 'persistent', 'efforts', 'Colonel', 'Stryker.Even', 'abject', 'alienation', 'still', 'not', 'forte', 'Jackman', 'what', 'can', 'rage-filled', 'cardboard', 'role', 'alternate', 'vindictive', 'sympathetic', 'lightning', 'flashes', 'exasperating', 'turn', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'even', 'less', 'latitude', 'Victor', 'a.k.a', 'Sabretooth', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'completely', 'malevolent', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'better', 'Stryker', 'character', 'rich', 'Machiavellian', 'tendencies', 'are', 'easy', 'root', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'ambiguously', 'dichotomous', 'role', 'similar', 'Eva', 'Green', 'James', 'Bond', 'vehicle', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'near-cameo', 'role', 'yet', 'comic', 'book', 'franchise', 'making', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'not', 'enough', 'offset', 'constant', 'mayhem', 'explosion-driven', 'helicopter', 'chase', 'relentless', 'fight', 'Three', 'Mile', 'Island', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'are', 'only', 'set', 'pieces', 'linger', 'memory', 'rest', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'greater', 'resonance', 'devoted', 'fans', 'comic', 'book']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

It wasn't spectacular or anything, but it wasn't horrible. I can overlook the shafting of sub-characters. But when you COMPLETELY re-write a main character, or a main villain...that's when it becomes ridiculous.As previously mentioned...why they chose to erase Wolverine's memory by shooting him in the head with adamantium bullets...yeah I don't know. Why they chose to have dead pool not have a mouth...don't know. Why they chose to have wolverine have bone claws?!? ...yeah your guess is as good as mine. Heck you may as well have Cable and Apocalypse come back from the future and tag team with wolverine to take out Spiderman, Hercules, and Buzz Lightyear. I understand that certain things must change when adapting something from comics to film. I didn't even mind XMEN 3 when they completely re-wrote the phoenix story. That was because it needed to happen to make it filmable. Bone claws, a mouthless deadpool, and adamantium bullets were NOT needed.

And surprise!  The film is not that bad.  Yes, it is corny and rather geared to young impressionable audiences, but the surprise is that the actors participating in this very slow weak script by David Benioff and Skip Woods seem to believe in it - or at least tongue in cheek have a good time with all the gimmicks built in to this story about the creation of mutants.  Gavin Hood directs the chaos.Hugh Jackman takes the lead, struggling against his darker brother of special traits Liev Schreiber and the audience actually hollers for the good guy/bad guy encounters.  It really helps this very long film to add the always reliable gifted comedian  cum Adonis Ryan Reynolds to the recipe: his time is far to short as he seems to be able to balance the comic book idea against the 'real drama' flavor the story needs. Danny Huston likewise makes the most of the head bad guy, maintaining a dignity that makes his role more credible.  Taylor Kitsch adds some interest as a newcomer and Lynn Collins does her best to toss in a bit of love life to the soup.But it is a film for CGI lovers and that audience will likely not be disappointed.  The idea of justifying the beginnings of a comic book hero grows old, but at least we don't have to worry about a prequel to this one!  See it for Jackman, Reynolds and Schreiber -lots of flash and pizZazz and set destruction in addition to their inherent star quality values.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","The Canuck who goes ""snikt"" is back and in his own feature film, and my tepid reaction goes along the lines of ""Um.. oh.. huh."" X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is serviceable enough, but in no way does it elevate the X-Men film franchise to new heights. There's always peril in disclosing a character's mysterious past, that the doing of it may possibly sabotage the character's existing appeal. Sometimes, things are better left alone, better left to the viewer's imaginations lest the reality not live up to all the fun speculations. In having long-withheld details from his murky past finally revealed, Wolverine ends up being less interesting. And the big, exciting reveals end up not so big, not so exciting. For a vehicle featuring a mutant berserker who's the best at what he does - which is fighting - X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE lacks punch.Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. Okay, I had to get over the fact that Logan in the comic books stands at only 5'3,"" and not 6'2,"" which is Jackman's height. Because, for me, part of Wolverine's appeal is that he's often the smallest runt in the place and still he tears  up the shizzy. Another thing is that Jackman doesn't quite convincingly demonstrate that utterly berserko rage that Logan succumbs to. So, not feral enough, vicious enough, scruffy enough, or, yeah, smelly enough. Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. But he's too, I dunno, elegant? Tame?The film begins somewhen in 1845, which is when young James Howlett's (Wolverine/Logan's real name) mutant abilities first truly kick in. We note James' popping of his retractable bone claws, the tragedy in his home, the panicked dash thru the woods, the show of togetherness by Victor Creed, James' older half-brother, and then we're off to the opening credits to catch brief glimpses of James and Victor adventuring thru various wars down the decades. Thru the years Victor (a very good Liev Shreiber) becomes increasingly bestial and amoral and you could see James growing more and more concerned about this. It was never gonna end well between the two. If you read the X-Men titles, you know this, that Wolverine and Sabertooth are the bitterest of enemies.In telling Logan's story, the movie skips key junctures in his past, or since this is the movie version, maybe Logan simply never did venture to Madripoor or get married in Japan. During 'Nam, we do see him and Victor being handpicked by Colonel Stryker for Team X, a black ops unit peopled with hardened mutants. We witness Stryker's interest in the rare metal alloy known as adamantium, and we fans know how adamantium impacts Wolverine later on. The movie cherry picks (and sometimes throws a curve on) elements from the Wolverine mythos. We follow Logan as he encounters Silverfox and later undergoes the excruciatingly painful Weapon X experiment. The film peppers in various superhero scuffles as Wolverine and Sabertooth separately throw down with various mutants, all this culminating in a showdown on Three Mile Island. But the disappointing thing is that most of the action sequences don't get you up as they should.I get the sense that Gambit and especially Deadpool were spotlighted with eventually having them star in their own movies in mind. Except that Taylor Kitsch underwhelms as Remy LeBeau. On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds as the mouthy merc Wade Wilson is very promising. Ryan Reynolds is at his scene-stealing best and, in one scene, as Wade Wilson furiously deflects bullets with his flashing swords, he solidifies himself as the baddest dude in a roomful of bad dudes. So I'm sold on the Deadpool movie. Actually, that whole sequence in which Team X invades a well-defended structure in Lagos, Nigeria counts as the most scintillating action sequence in the film. However, what they later do to Deadpool is just too much. I also wasn't down with the out-of-left-field reimagining of Blob. A fun thing, though, is that I once again get to play the ""Identify that Cameo"" game. Most prominent are a young Cyclops and Emma Frost. But see if you could pick out the others.The movie gives us a momentary glimpse of Logan being happy, the operative word being ""momentary."" We see Logan suffering a tragic loss and giving in to his inner rage and losing his inhibitions. And yet, as portrayed by Hugh Jackman, when Wolverine loses it, in my eyes, he doesn't lose it enough. The PG-13 rating may also be to blame for this. Word is that a sequel is already underway. I'm crossing my fingers for an Alpha Flight sighting.Lastly, Wade Wilson just cracks me up. Mouthy as he is, he doesn't really get a chance to mouth off. However, he does manage to get on Sabertooth's bad side when he observes that Sabertooth has the ""fingernails of a bag lady.""",3,Longing for a more thrilling snikt,1259280000,"11 27,

1195573,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B001GCUO16,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[1, 3]","After multiple warnings from friends, colleagues, and random fan-boys/girls, I braved the theatre this opening weekend and hoped that the critics were wrong about how horrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine was.They were.It was even worse than I'd imagined.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------For the most part, the X-Men movie franchise has been good to us. Somehow, FOX Studios and Marvel had created a movie brand that not only appeased the old comic-book lovers of the franchise, but was also able to draw in new blood. Everybody liked X-Men. The franchise had gotten so big that prime-time television is on its third season of a hit spin-off, Heroes. They drew in so much new blood that they started releasing new comic-book spin-offs of the X-Men, and everyone and their grandmother bought them.Hey, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed the ride.Then, they got greedy. The producers decided to ""go back in time"" to explain the origins of Wolverine. It wasn't a bad idea. Out of all the X-Men, both heroes and villians, Wolverine's back-story is probably the most interesting, aside from Angel/Archangel, and even Jubilee(who's surrounding story of The Reavers is much more interesting than the character herself. Excuse me, my dorkiness is showing.)Unfortunately, the producers didn't feel the same way, and decided to ""Hollywood it up"" into the piece of drek in theatres today.I cannot blame the actors. Across the board, I had no complaints. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine efficiently. He still has that angst-ridden animal nature working for him. Liev Schreiber recasts Victor Creed(aka Sabretooth) well, although he bounces around a little too much like ""a cat."" Ryan Reynolds surprised me with the brief time he was on-screen as Wade Wilson(before becoming Deadpool). All his lines had a bit of dry comical wit, just like the Deadpool I enjoyed reading back when I read comic books. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job. Except maybe Jason Lee(from My Name is Earl, Mallrats, etc.) I even enjoyed Dominic Monaghan's(of LOST and Lord of the Rings fame) short stint as the fearful technolith, Bolt, and Kevin Durand's Blob. Unfortunately, these latter three characters barely had any screen time. They could only do as much as the script, and a last minute rewrite, allowed them to do.A major problem seemed to be script and directing. The movie's intro was a huge step away from the end of the original X-Men trilogy. Instead of the dark drama, that coincided with the death of Scott Summers and the rise of the Dark Phoenix, continuing, the franchise reverted back to comic-book goofiness, where action drives the story and character development plays second fiddle. That wouldn't be so bad, except that the action is sparse, too. Having Wolverine and Sabretooth run through 4 wars is a nice idea, but looks way too forced on-screen as an intro. It is continued with a short government task force stint, a lot of walking around and lumber-jacking, until finally Wolverine receives his adamantium infusion. And the story gets worse from there, until the final fight with Deadpool himself, which is a travesty to anyone who enjoyed the ""merc with a mouth.""Another thing that bothered me, however small, was the depiction of Wolverine's claws. I remember the past movies having some decent looking claws coming out of Hugh Jackman's fists. For some reason, this time around they reminded me more of what they would look like in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or ""Cool World."" This was especially prevalent in the bathroom scene. They looked way too cartoonish. I don't remember them looking that bad in the trilogy.",2,An Original Flop,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,3668,"['multiple', 'warnings', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'random', 'fan-boys/girls', 'braved', 'theatre', 'opening', 'weekend', 'hoped', 'critics', 'were', 'wrong', 'how', 'horrible', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'was.They', 'were.It', 'was', 'even', 'worse', ""'d"", 'imagined.', 'most', 'part', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'franchise', 'been', 'good', 'Somehow', 'FOX', 'Studios', 'Marvel', 'had', 'created', 'movie', 'brand', 'not', 'only', 'appeased', 'old', 'comic-book', 'lovers', 'franchise', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'draw', 'new', 'blood', 'Everybody', 'liked', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'big', 'prime-time', 'television', 'third', 'season', 'hit', 'spin-off', 'Heroes', 'drew', 'so', 'much', 'new', 'blood', 'started', 'releasing', 'new', 'comic-book', 'spin-offs', 'X-Men', 'everyone', 'grandmother', 'bought', 'them.Hey', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'enjoyed', 'ride.Then', 'got', 'greedy', 'producers', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'explain', 'origins', 'Wolverine', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'X-Men', 'heroes', 'villians', 'Wolverine', 'back-story', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'aside', 'Angel/Archangel', 'even', 'Jubilee', 'who', 'surrounding', 'story', 'Reavers', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'Excuse', 'dorkiness', 'showing', 'Unfortunately', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'decided', 'Hollywood', 'up', 'piece', 'drek', 'theatres', 'today.I', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'actors', 'board', 'had', 'complaints', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'efficiently', 'still', 'angst-ridden', 'animal', 'nature', 'working', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'Sabretooth', 'well', 'around', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'cat', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'surprised', 'brief', 'time', 'was', 'on-screen', 'Wade', 'Wilson', 'becoming', 'Deadpool', 'lines', 'had', 'bit', 'dry', 'comical', 'wit', 'just', 'Deadpool', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'back', 'when', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'maybe', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'My', 'Name', 'Earl', 'Mallrats', 'etc', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'LOST', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fame', 'short', 'stint', 'fearful', 'technolith', 'Bolt', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Blob', 'Unfortunately', 'latter', 'three', 'characters', 'barely', 'had', 'screen', 'time', 'could', 'only', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'script', 'last', 'minute', 'rewrite', 'allowed', 'do.A', 'major', 'problem', 'seemed', 'be', 'script', 'directing', 'movie', 'intro', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'away', 'end', 'original', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'Instead', 'dark', 'drama', 'coincided', 'death', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'rise', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'continuing', 'franchise', 'reverted', 'back', 'comic-book', 'goofiness', 'where', 'action', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'second', 'fiddle', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'action', 'sparse', 'too', 'Having', 'Wolverine', 'Sabretooth', 'run', '4', 'wars', 'nice', 'idea', 'way', 'too', 'forced', 'on-screen', 'intro', 'continued', 'short', 'government', 'task', 'force', 'stint', 'lot', 'walking', 'around', 'lumber-jacking', 'finally', 'Wolverine', 'adamantium', 'infusion', 'story', 'worse', 'there', 'final', 'fight', 'Deadpool', 'travesty', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'merc', 'mouth', 'thing', 'bothered', 'however', 'small', 'was', 'depiction', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'remember', 'past', 'movies', 'having', 'decent', 'looking', 'claws', 'coming', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'fists', 'reason', 'time', 'reminded', 'more', 'what', 'would', 'look', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Cool', 'World', 'was', 'especially', 'prevalent', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'looked', 'way', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'looking', 'bad', 'trilogy']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

Wolverine busts out of a tank of water where he basically died a few minutes ago, then in the next scene his hair is perfectly coiffed and blow-dryed. That's the kind of storytelling and movimaking care in evidence through most of the film. Characters pop up then disappear, no one has any emotional depth outside of Wolverine and Sabretooth and even this is given short shrift in favor of annoying cameos by Deadpool and Gambit. Then nothing solid is done with either so they are there... why?Stunts are ""Oh, this' ll be cool"" rather than flowing from the story, the kid playing young Wolverine is not fantastic. And the one part of the film where something new with emotional depth occurs (Wolverine's retreat into the Canadian wilderness with a beautiful, seemingly caring woman, from what little we see of her) is rushed over in order to get to some more clich&eacute; ""superhero movie"" writing (i.e. think the derivative Daredevil, not Dark Knight), etc.I give this 2 stars because Hugh Jackman is awesome, as always, as is Liev Schrieber as Sabretooth.

1195579,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B001GCUO16,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 7]","I saw it recently expecting one of the worst films ever made (like X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) and I was mildly surprised. I think that surprise was due to the fact that I had EXTREMELY low expectations. It's interesting to see so many characters in this film that are part of the X-Universe in some way, from Blob to Emma Frost to Deadpool, but waaaay too much of this film is either aped completely from other films (Agent Zero's gun skills are essentially cribbed from the far superior EQUILIBRIUM, and a drug inducing a death-like state of a loved one? Read any Shakespeare lately?) or the film has plot holes the size of The Milky Way. Seriously... an Adamantium bullet? THAT'S how you can explain something like the ending of this film? Ugh. The biggest mistake that director Gavin Hood and the writing team made was not really keeping with James Howlett's actual origin, which would have been a film in and of itself if they had adapted the graphic novel ORIGIN, but they decided to do a REALLY short adaptation of it: The opening five minutes. And then they went berserk with mutant mayhem. And the mayhem isn't so much the action or the story; it turned into a game: How many obscure mutants can we fit into one film?The other game that it turned into was how can we create a spinoff for Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool? Like that's a character that needs its own film, especially after what they did to him in this film.There are cool moments in the film, and moments that made me smile, and Hugh Jackman is very cool as Logan. So, again... not so bad that it made me want to punch everyone involved, like THE LAST STAND did, but not so good as to rank amongst the really-good-ness of the first film or the sheer genius of X-MEN UNITED. 3 out of 5 is a decent score if you expect NOTHING from this film other than some cool action and Jackman's wife-beater posturing.",3,Not nearly as bad as THE LAST STAND.,1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,1866,"['saw', 'recently', 'expecting', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'X-MEN', 'LAST', 'STAND', 'was', 'mildly', 'surprised', 'think', 'surprise', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'had', 'EXTREMELY', 'low', 'expectations', 'interesting', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'part', 'X-Universe', 'way', 'Blob', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Deadpool', 'waaaay', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'aped', 'completely', 'other', 'films', 'Agent', 'Zero', 'gun', 'skills', 'are', 'essentially', 'cribbed', 'far', 'superior', 'EQUILIBRIUM', 'drug', 'inducing', 'death-like', 'state', 'loved', 'one', 'Read', 'Shakespeare', 'lately', 'film', 'plot', 'size', 'Milky', 'Way', 'Seriously', 'Adamantium', 'bullet', 'THAT', 'how', 'can', 'explain', 'something', 'ending', 'film', 'Ugh', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'writing', 'team', 'made', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'keeping', 'James', 'Howlett', 'actual', 'origin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'had', 'adapted', 'graphic', 'novel', 'ORIGIN', 'decided', 'do', 'REALLY', 'short', 'adaptation', 'opening', 'five', 'minutes', 'then', 'went', 'berserk', 'mutant', 'mayhem', 'mayhem', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'action', 'story', 'turned', 'game', 'How', 'many', 'obscure', 'mutants', 'can', 'fit', 'one', 'film', 'other', 'game', 'turned', 'was', 'how', 'can', 'create', 'spinoff', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Deadpool', 'character', 'own', 'film', 'especially', 'what', 'did', 'are', 'cool', 'moments', 'film', 'moments', 'made', 'smile', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'very', 'cool', 'Logan', 'So', 'again', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'made', 'want', 'punch', 'everyone', 'involved', 'LAST', 'STAND', 'did', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'rank', 'really-good-ness', 'first', 'film', 'sheer', 'genius', 'X-MEN', 'UNITED', '3', '5', 'decent', 'score', 'expect', 'NOTHING', 'film', 'other', 'cool', 'action', 'Jackman', 'wife-beater', 'posturing']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

I'm talking Spielberg, Bruckhiemer, Scott (Ridley or Tony) or Snyder. Blu Ray was made for big budget action movies that push the format to give the best possible sound and amazing special effects displayed in glorious 1080p resolution with 7.1 High Def audio. With the release of the first big summer action flick of 2009 (Watchmen not withstadating), I was at least looking forward to watching a pretty terrible movie in it's best possible resolution.ouch.Origins is the prequel to the hit and miss X-Men franchise starring one of the most popular characters in Marvel's universe. I'm a comic fan. Not an uber fan, but I do still try to keep up and have read some of the origin stories of Wolverine. There is no getting around the fact that this is just a very poor movie that makes little use of some amazing source material. Hugh Jackman does what he can, but the story is so lame, it falls flat. Liev Schriber looks scary enough, but again, story and direction derail. And there's the introduction of two of my very favorite characters, Gambit and Deadpool. Both are perfectly cast (Ryan Reynolds will be Deadpool again and Gambit may be done), but niether have enough screen time to justify the hype. I won't spoil the end, but will say that Ryan Reynolds excels and being a smart mouth. He's playing a character that is a smart mouth. Ladies seem to love him (at least my wife sure does). And Currently, he's surpased Jackman and is the biggest star in this movie. So what do the filmakers do? Replace Reynolds with a speechless body double to fight Wolvy. LAME.Poorly choreographed action and terrible special effects round out the film. Enter the mighty Bluray. What looked bad in the theater looks horrendous in high def. Like Indiana Jones:Crystal Skull, the special effects actually take away from the movie. The one thing that had to look good were the claws. No exaggeration, they look like the plastic toys. They are REALLY BAD. This is a case where I might suggest a standard DVD to cloud up the visuals. The sound is solid, but nothing remarkable. Special features are standard, nothing new to note and it has what is becoming standard, a digital copy.I'm a huge fan of the summer blockbuster - I'm not a film snob by any stretch. I give Wolverine 2 stars for great casting and a good job by Jackman.

1195590,A2RKLZ21ST874P,B001GCUO16,"JennJ ""jenng13""","[0, 0]","Here is what many fans including myself had been waiting for the chance to find out the back story of Logan a.k.a Wolverine. So many questions were left open in the first three Xmen movies about Wolverine and how he became what he was. And since he is suffering from amnesia and could remember nothing about his past but painful flashbacks, most fans (who again like me) weren't avid followers of the comics had many more questions about his character than we had answers regarding his very elusive past. This movie will fill in pretty much all of the blanks for you. We follow Logan from being a very young boy through adulthood and all the through the circumstances that lead to him becomine involved with the Weapon X program and how he became the Wolverine with that seemingly indestructible Adamantium skeleton.We also get to see several of the relationships that majorly shape his life throughout the movie. Victor a.k.a Sabertooth...and just how close they were only to become bitter enemys later in life...as well as several other characters that we come to know better in later movies too (Cyclops, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Charles Xavier all make an appearance).I won't go into a lot of detail about what happens, because in doing so I would ruin parts of the movie for those that haven't gotten to see this one yet. But I personally loved this movie. In fact it just might be my favorite Xmen movie so far. I know that for some reason a lot of Xmen fans had very negative reviews for this one and I personally can't see one reason why. The story to me was very well written, the acting by all actors was superb, and it laid the very firm ground work for why Wolverine is the way he is. Maybe it had something to do with the comic books and the way the backstory was done in them I don't know. Although I am an Xmen fan I hasten to say that I am a fan of the movies and the Xmen cartoon that came on back in the 80's. I am not nor have I ever been a fan of the comics themselves, so maybe some of the rabid comic fans took acception to the movie conficting with things in the comics. I know some do that no matter what the movie so maybe that was the reason why some hated this one. That is the only thing I can think of why some didn't like the film.Hugh Jackman was simply outstanding, and yes he is outrageously handsome in this one ladies. He to me IS Wolverine now. He has become the complete embodiment of the character and I can't imagine another actor playing him at this point. He is perfect in the action sequences, tender in the scenes with Kayla, and perfect as the pained anti-hero we have all come to love. Don't think of this as some corny comic book flick it's much deeper than that. It's a very good action packed movie that the whole family from pre-teens and up will enjoy.http://romanceps.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-xmen-origins-wolverine.html",4,I don't know why so many don't like it.

And the bone claws are just rediculous.

Schreiber's performance is especially noteworthy since he's probably the best villain I have seen in an X - Men film since Ian McKellen's wicked, quite twisted, take on Magneto. Indeed, in almost every scene, Schreiber almost steals the spotlight from Jackman. Replete with great action adventure sequences, this film sags a bit in discussing the origins of Wolverine and his conflicted relationship with his half-brother Sabretooth, whom we meet first in the desolate wildnerness of Canada's Northwest Territories, sometime in the mid 1840s (We see next a thrilling montage of both brothers servicing in the USA's armed forces from the Civil War through Vietnam and beyond.). Another compelling reason to see ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is Danny Huston's creepy performance as Colonel Stryker, who finds himself as both mentor and sinister overlord to both X-Men. Have no doubt that diehard fans of the ""X-Men"" series will enjoy this film, especially for the fine screen chemistry between Jackman and Schreiber, but I also suspect that those unfamiliar with this classic comic book series may feel a bit underwhelmed.",3,"Good, Not Great, X-Men Film",1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,1264,"['are', 'really', 'two', 'good', 'reasons', 'watch', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'respectively', 'Wolverine', 'Sabretooth', 'Schreiber', 'performance', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'probably', 'best', 'villain', 'have', 'seen', 'X', 'Men', 'film', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'wicked', 'quite', 'twisted', 'take', 'Magneto', 'Indeed', 'almost', 'scene', 'Schreiber', 'almost', 'spotlight', 'Jackman', 'Replete', 'great', 'action', 'adventure', 'sequences', 'film', 'bit', 'discussing', 'origins', 'Wolverine', 'conflicted', 'relationship', 'half-brother', 'Sabretooth', 'whom', 'meet', 'first', 'desolate', 'wildnerness', 'Canada', 'Northwest', 'Territories', 'sometime', 'mid', '1840s', 'see', 'next', 'thrilling', 'montage', 'brothers', 'servicing', 'USA', 'armed', 'forces', 'Civil', 'War', 'Vietnam', 'beyond.', 'compelling', 'reason', 'see', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Colonel', 'Stryker', 'who', 'mentor', 'sinister', 'overlord', 'X-Men', 'Have', 'doubt', 'diehard', 'fans', 'X-Men', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'especially', 'fine', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Jackman', 'Schreiber', 'also', 'suspect', 'unfamiliar', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'may', 'feel', 'bit', 'underwhelmed']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

From the Civil War to Vietnam in the 70's, James a.k.a. Logan (Huge Jackman) and his big brother nicknamed Sabretooth (Liv Schriber) have joined a secret government agency task force. But after killing innocent people in Nigeria, six years later he decides to make a better life in the Canadian rockies with a beautiful girlfriend Kayla(Lynn Collins) and with a job. However after Kayla was murdered, Logan particaptes in a experiment involving a rare indestructable metal called adamantium as it makes his skeleton and claws even more powerful then ever. He still retains his powers of immortality and self-healing as now he vows revenge on his brother and those that killed his true love, but it seems Stryker is kidnapping mutants and using them for experiments. He teams up with a Cajun mutant with unique explosive powers named Gambit a.k.a. Remy Labeau (Taylor Kitsch) and John Wraith (Will I.Am) who's powers include teleporting as they must find the mutants to free them.Entertaining and action-packed prequel to the X-Men saga is a fascinating film. This one sets itself 15 years before the first movie as it tells us how Wolverine became to be the savage hero he is today and a little history that it adapts the graphic novel ""Wolverine: ORIGINS"" quite well on the screen.

There are some great action scenes and the fight scenes were pretty cool.

The focus is on the origin and essence of the young man who becomes the most famous Marvel Universe mutant. In the same vein as the recent comics storylines, this movie adaptation reveals that despite his somewhat youthful appearance, Wolverine is among the oldest of the mutants. His physical prowess, as well as his abilities to physically heal immediately after being injured, make him virtually ageless in the sense ascribed to the Vampires and Lycans in Underworld.Though not perfect, X-Men Origins: Wolverine has no quickly apparent plot holes. The attention was placed upon the title character, as one would rightfully expect. A ""sibling rivalry"" against Sabretooth provided an interesting twist that laid the foundation for both character and story development. And it is the escalating animosity between the two that plays to the movie's strengths.Fascinating special effects are added as Wolverine's physiology undergoes drastic transformations. With his natural healing abilities put to the ultimate test, Wolverine is having to endure levels of extreme pain, as his skeleton is infused with the indestructible metal that comes to be known as adamantium.Wolverine, by undergoing this experiment, is identified as the outcome of the Weapon X project, which, as a central theme in itself, adds nice science fiction components. Involved in the program are the capture of mutants of exceptional ability and then taking samples of their traits and later amalgamating them to create a type of indomitable super soldier. One might not help but think of Frankenstein or Re-Animator but with a higher level of genetic engineering involved.Ironically, it is when the the most stunning visuals are displayed that the story momentarily loses traction. As the movie delves further into the Weapon X project, the viewer finds out that it is part of a grand scheme designed to wage war on mutants. This overture, I think, could and should have been avoided. Though there are brief glimpses of the early pasts of Wolverine and Sabretooth, as they survive the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War, the history of how humans came to fear mutantkind is not intertwined. Thus the mutants are our enemies theme does not serve an insightful, pivotal element.However, despite the deficient forthcomings that have emanated, things are properly adjusted, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine turns out to be a success as opposed to a disappointment that fizzles to the end. The movie gets back to its strong points, where we are entreated to a Wolverine and Sabretooth showdown, as well as romantic involvements concerning Wolverine that were never introduced in the previous X-Men releases.Overall, a thumb up for this near masterpiece. Hugh Jackman, as anticipated, shows his acting talents and, once again, recreates one of the most fascinating and popular Marvel characters around. His Wolverine, from a theatrical perspective, triumphs as the lovable, perfect character who, though not idealistic, has far too much courage to be branded an antihero.",4,"ACTUALLY, 3.5 ADAMANTIUM CLAWS OUT OF 5",1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,3158,"['X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'good', 'prequel', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'once', 'again', 'starring', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'focus', 'origin', 'essence', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'famous', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'mutant', 'same', 'vein', 'recent', 'comics', 'storylines', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'reveals', 'somewhat', 'youthful', 'appearance', 'Wolverine', 'oldest', 'mutants', 'physical', 'prowess', 'as', 'well', 'abilities', 'physically', 'heal', 'immediately', 'being', 'injured', 'make', 'virtually', 'ageless', 'sense', 'ascribed', 'Vampires', 'Lycans', 'Underworld.Though', 'not', 'perfect', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'plot', 'holes', 'attention', 'was', 'placed', 'title', 'character', 'one', 'would', 'rightfully', 'expect', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'Sabretooth', 'provided', 'interesting', 'twist', 'laid', 'foundation', 'character', 'story', 'development', 'escalating', 'animosity', 'two', 'movie', 'strengths.Fascinating', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'added', 'Wolverine', 'physiology', 'undergoes', 'drastic', 'transformations', 'natural', 'healing', 'abilities', 'put', 'ultimate', 'test', 'Wolverine', 'having', 'endure', 'levels', 'extreme', 'pain', 'skeleton', 'infused', 'indestructible', 'metal', 'be', 'known', 'adamantium.Wolverine', 'undergoing', 'experiment', 'identified', 'outcome', 'Weapon', 'X', 'project', 'central', 'theme', 'nice', 'science', 'fiction', 'components', 'Involved', 'program', 'are', 'capture', 'mutants', 'exceptional', 'ability', 'then', 'taking', 'samples', 'traits', 'later', 'amalgamating', 'create', 'type', 'indomitable', 'super', 'soldier', 'One', 'might', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'Frankenstein', 'Re-Animator', 'higher', 'level', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'involved.Ironically', 'when', 'most', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'are', 'displayed', 'story', 'momentarily', 'traction', 'movie', 'further', 'Weapon', 'X', 'project', 'viewer', 'out', 'part', 'grand', 'scheme', 'designed', 'wage', 'war', 'mutants', 'overture', 'think', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'are', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'early', 'pasts', 'Wolverine', 'Sabretooth', 'survive', 'Civil', 'War', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'history', 'how', 'humans', 'came', 'fear', 'mutantkind', 'not', 'intertwined', 'Thus', 'mutants', 'are', 'enemies', 'theme', 'not', 'serve', 'insightful', 'pivotal', 'element.However', 'deficient', 'forthcomings', 'have', 'emanated', 'things', 'are', 'properly', 'adjusted', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'out', 'be', 'success', 'opposed', 'disappointment', 'end', 'movie', 'back', 'strong', 'points', 'where', 'are', 'entreated', 'Wolverine', 'Sabretooth', 'showdown', 'as', 'well', 'romantic', 'involvements', 'concerning', 'Wolverine', 'were', 'never', 'introduced', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'releases.Overall', 'thumb', 'up', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'anticipated', 'acting', 'talents', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'popular', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'around', 'Wolverine', 'theatrical', 'perspective', 'triumphs', 'lovable', 'perfect', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'idealistic', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'courage', 'be', 'branded', 'antihero']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

The writers however decided to try to turn this into yet another X-Men movie by bringing in way too many additional characters and trying to form a team. Why is Gambit in this movie? I understand that he is a favorite of many who love the X-Men comics but he feels so forced in this movie. It was like the writers said ""We need to get Gambit into an X-Men movie or the fans will hate us. So lets put him in this movie where he doesn't belong at all!"" And then there is the elephant in the room Deadpool. There is so much outrage from the fans of Deadpool being completely unlike how he is in the comics. In the movie, they remove his mouth. WTF? He is supposed to be 'the merc with a mouth'. And then they make swords come out of this arms like Baraka from Mortal Kombat. Then there are the visuals. They clearly ran out of time to finish many of the CGI effects and this movie shows more than any other that I can think of. The scene where Wolverine is in the mirror, his claws looked like they were drawn in with a pencil. It looks so bad its actually hilarious. Then they cast Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth). Now, I have no problem with Liev, I actually think he is a really good actor. But Sabretooth is supposed to be huge. Quite a bit taller than Wolverine at least, and he looks tiny. Hugh Jackman does everything he can to save this movie. He really has his character of Wolverine nailed down and I like it, and many of the fans like it. But this movie could have been avoided entirely. In X2: X-Men United they have flashback sequences to tell the audience of how Wolverine got his adamantium skeleton and those few sequences are better than this entire movie. So this movie ranks in my opinion the worst X-Men movie tied with X-Men 3 The Last Stand. They are both so horrible I don't know which one to pick as worse.",2,They tried to turn this movie into X-Men 4.,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,1974,"['movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'correctly', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'revolved', 'around', 'Wolverine', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'Stryker', 'Thats', 'really', 'writers', 'however', 'decided', 'try', 'turn', 'yet', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'bringing', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'additional', 'characters', 'trying', 'form', 'team', 'Why', 'Gambit', 'movie', 'understand', 'favorite', 'many', 'who', 'love', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'so', 'forced', 'movie', 'was', 'writers', 'said', 'need', 'get', 'Gambit', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'hate', 'lets', 'put', 'movie', 'where', ""n't"", 'belong', 'then', 'elephant', 'room', 'Deadpool', 'so', 'much', 'outrage', 'fans', 'Deadpool', 'being', 'completely', 'how', 'comics', 'movie', 'remove', 'mouth', 'WTF', 'supposed', 'be', ""'the"", 'merc', 'mouth', 'then', 'make', 'swords', 'come', 'arms', 'Baraka', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'Then', 'are', 'visuals', 'clearly', 'ran', 'time', 'finish', 'many', 'CGI', 'effects', 'movie', 'more', 'other', 'can', 'think', 'scene', 'where', 'Wolverine', 'mirror', 'claws', 'looked', 'were', 'drawn', 'pencil', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'hilarious', 'Then', 'cast', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'Sabretooth', 'Now', 'have', 'problem', 'Liev', 'actually', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'Sabretooth', 'supposed', 'be', 'huge', 'bit', 'taller', 'Wolverine', 'least', 'tiny', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'everything', 'can', 'save', 'movie', 'really', 'character', 'Wolverine', 'nailed', 'down', 'like', 'many', 'fans', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'entirely', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'have', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'tell', 'audience', 'how', 'Wolverine', 'got', 'adamantium', 'skeleton', 'few', 'sequences', 'are', 'better', 'entire', 'movie', 'So', 'movie', 'opinion', 'worst', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'tied', 'X-Men', '3', 'Last', 'Stand', 'are', 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'pick', 'worse']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195612,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B001GCUO16,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[2, 3]","This was probably the weakest of all the X Men movies. I do not hate this movie like say Spider Man 3 but still it's not good. Directed by Gavin Hood stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth, Danny Huston as Colonel William Stryker, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit & Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox. I 'm going to be honest this movie has a lot of problems. Like Wolverine & Sabertooth are brothers. Basically they join Team X & later due to questionable actions & disregard for human life Wolverine leaves moves to Canada goes under the name Logan he's lived there for 6 years with his girlfriend Kayla. Colonel Stryker tells him that people are killing members of Team X ok this could be like a Commando version of X Men. Kayla is murdered by Sabertooth Wolverine gets pwnd by Sabertooth & he's offered a way to beat him to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium. Logan overhears Stryker say erase his memory. Wolverine fights his way out & hides at a farm. Stryker has his men track him down they kill the owners of the farm. Then were introduced to Remy LeBeau or Gambit he mangles to convalesce him to take him to Stryker's main headquarters at 3 Mile Island. There Wolverine finds out Kayla wasn't killed she's been working with Stryker all along so he will release his sister. It has too many problems the stuff with Wolverine & Sabertooth being brothers wasn't needed cause all we need to know is they have this history they hate each other. Wolverine's woman working with Stryker it was 1 of those left feild things but it just didn't work for a movie. The PG 13 rating didn't help cause in Wolverine's past it's dark & violent it should've been rated R. The CGI for the claws look so fake. CGI or pactical effects when the claws came out in the other 3 movies it looked good. Wolverine losing his memory by an adamantium bullet is lazy script writing. Deadpool looks like Baraka from the MK games. I liked some of the action it has some ok fights. Gavin Hood wasn't the best choice for this movie maybe Bryan Synger could've done a better I don't know but Hood isn't capeable. Hugh Jackman was good. Danny Huston was a bad choice I'd rather had Brian Cox come back. Liev Schtaiber I didn't care for. Lynn Collins was ok. Taylor Kitsch was ok as Gambit but they should've done a better job I mean 4 movies & this was it. There going to do a 2nd Wolverine movie I hope 20th Century Fux are far away from it & it's R rated. I'm not looking forward to The 1st Class mostly cause I'm not a fan of prequels. I'd say rent it to see if you like it.",2,Not as good as it could've been 6/10,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2562,"['was', 'probably', 'weakest', 'X', 'Men', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'movie', 'say', 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'Directed', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Sabertooth', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Colonel', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Gambit', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Kayla', 'Silverfox', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'lot', 'problems', 'Wolverine', 'Sabertooth', 'are', 'brothers', 'Basically', 'join', 'Team', 'X', 'later', 'due', 'questionable', 'actions', 'disregard', 'human', 'life', 'Wolverine', 'moves', 'Canada', 'name', 'Logan', 'lived', '6', 'years', 'girlfriend', 'Kayla', 'Colonel', 'Stryker', 'people', 'are', 'killing', 'members', 'Team', 'X', 'could', 'be', 'Commando', 'version', 'X', 'Men', 'Kayla', 'murdered', 'Sabertooth', 'Wolverine', 'pwnd', 'Sabertooth', 'offered', 'way', 'beat', 'reinforce', 'skeleton', 'adamantium', 'Logan', 'Stryker', 'say', 'erase', 'memory', 'Wolverine', 'fights', 'way', 'hides', 'farm', 'Stryker', 'men', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'owners', 'farm', 'Then', 'were', 'introduced', 'Remy', 'LeBeau', 'Gambit', 'convalesce', 'take', 'Stryker', 'main', 'headquarters', '3', 'Mile', 'Island', 'Wolverine', 'out', 'Kayla', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'been', 'working', 'Stryker', 'along', 'so', 'will', 'release', 'sister', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'stuff', 'Wolverine', 'Sabertooth', 'being', 'brothers', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'cause', 'need', 'know', 'have', 'history', 'hate', 'other', 'Wolverine', 'woman', 'working', 'Stryker', 'was', '1', 'left', 'feild', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'PG', '13', 'rating', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'cause', 'Wolverine', 'dark', 'violent', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rated', 'R.', 'CGI', 'claws', 'look', 'so', 'fake', 'CGI', 'pactical', 'effects', 'when', 'claws', 'came', 'out', 'other', '3', 'movies', 'looked', 'good', 'Wolverine', 'losing', 'memory', 'adamantium', 'bullet', 'lazy', 'script', 'writing', 'Deadpool', 'Baraka', 'MK', 'games', 'liked', 'action', 'ok', 'fights', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'choice', 'movie', 'maybe', 'Bryan', 'Synger', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hood', ""n't"", 'capeable', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'good', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'was', 'bad', 'choice', ""'d"", 'rather', 'had', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'come', 'back', 'Liev', 'Schtaiber', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'was', 'ok.', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'was', 'ok', 'Gambit', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'job', 'mean', '4', 'movies', 'was', 'going', 'do', '2nd', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'hope', '20th', 'Century', 'Fux', 'are', 'far', 'away', 'R', 'rated', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'forward', '1st', 'Class', 'mostly', 'cause', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'prequels', ""'d"", 'say', 'rent', 'see', 'like']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195613,A3TTZQ1WARN3ZT,B001GCUO16,J. Romeo,"[2, 3]","I didn't want to like X-Men Origins: Wolverine When it was announced the movie was in the works, along with X-Men Origins: Magneto, I cringed. I cringed because it reeked of gimmick. What Marvel Comics does (to be fair, DC Comics does the same thing) is create an ""event""-a rather long and convoluted storyline-that is spread out over every title published by Marvel Comics. The reader is almost forced to buy every single comic in Marvel's lineup in order to understand what is going on in the story.At $ 3.99 a comic, the gimmick pays off quite well for Marvel. It was also announced, around the same time, that there would be a Captain America movie (Captain America: The First Avenger; which is now being filmed), followed by a Thor movie (again being filmed), and then another Iron Man movie (Iron Man 3 for those of you keeping score). After all three of these films are completed Marvel Studios is going to start production on an Avengers movie. The Avengers movie will star all the players from the other Marvel movies, including Edward Norton as the Hulk. I can only assume that the major players signed contracts stating that they would do an Avengers movie.Seeing Marvel Studios trying and pull the same gimmick in the movies left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I already had a biased view of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I knew that it wasn't going to be any good. There was no way that this was going to be any good. However, a funny thing happened on the way to the ending credits. I started enjoying Wolverine.It isn't an Academy Award winning movie by any stretch of the imagination. The movie has its fair share of problems, but with these kinds of movies you have to expect some problems. For instance, after only one mission we are suppose to believe that Logan, Victor Creed and the rest of the commando unit are a tight knit group. I can buy that the rest of the group as a tight knitted group because we are told how they went on more missions after Logan left. But, how the whole group was tight with Logan is a mystery because they were only on one mission together.What sets the movie in motion is the death of Logan's girlfriend, Kayla. Of course, she never died. It turned out that she was given a drug that slowed her heart down so that it appeared that she were dead. It's a pretty bad story device, but Shakespeare did the same thing, right? However, when he wrote Romeo and Juliet it hadn't been done a million times. But this isn't Shakespeare it's Wolverine. As far as storytelling is concerned, using the fake death ploy is not only played out, but it's a device used by weak writers. What makes her ""death"" even more ridiculous is the character of Wolverine. Wolverine is supposed to have heightened senses-smell, vision, taste, the whole nine yards-he would have known that Kayla wasn't dead. I watch enough TRU TV to know that dead bodies don't give off heat. Of course, it would take some time for the body to grow cold, but he would have felt her body growing colder.  It gets even worse when we see Victor Creed pouring blood on her to ""further"" the illusion. Maybe I am going out on limb here, but wouldn't fresh blood smell different than blood that has been stored in a refrigerator somewhere? And why wouldn't he have noticed that there wasn't a mark on her?It In Wolverine we finally learn how Logan lost his memories and the reason is just as cheesy as the faked death. It turns out that a bullet- an adamantium bullet- in the brain is the reason. But, we've seen Logan take a bullet to the brain before and nothing happened to him.I need to point out that when we saw him get shot in the head in X-Men 2 the bullet was in his head. It didn't ricochet off his adamantium skull; the bullet went into his brain. We even see it pop out when he heals. So, why did one bullet take his memories and the other one didn't? Now I'm not a brain surgeon or a metallurgist, so I am only guessing when I say that any type of metal shot into your brain is a bad thing. The writers and the director could have chosen any number of ways that his memories could have been erased. For instance, they could have said that the process of grafting adamantium onto his bones was so painful that his mind shut down as a means to cope with the pain. There could have been some sort of malfunction to the equipment that resulted in the memory loss. An even better reason would be that his memories were erased on purpose!Think about it. If you were the mad scientist creating the ultimate killing machine wouldn't you have wiped his memories? When he learns what you did to him and his girlfriends don't you think that he would be a little ticked off? Think of your own reasons. Anything would have been better than the reason that we were given.I hate to say it because I like Ryan Reynolds, but there was zero reason that he should have been in the movie. Well, I guess there is one reason-Reynolds had already been cast to play Deadpool (A movie spin-off of a movie spin-off. Yeah, there's not gimmick there) in the upcoming movie. He delivers his lines in his trademarked sarcastic tone, but you get the feeling that there is somewhere else that Reynolds wants to be.I know that it sounds like I just tore the whole movie apart, but I still found things in the movie that I enjoyed. The staples of superhero movies are well represented. Things blow up, guns are fired in ultra-cool ways, and bullets are sliced in mid-air. The special effects are great. The stand out scene is when Deadpool's head, eyes still blasting lasers, falls down one of 3 Mile Island's cooling towers and cuts it to pieces.  Watching it crumble to the ground was a visual treat.The fight scenes were well choreographed with no restrictions on cable work. In the opening credits we follow Logan and Victor as they move through history one war after another. Each war, beginning with the Revolutionary War, seamlessly flows into the next war finally stopping during the Vietnam War. Not only do the opening credits show the audience that the two characters have been around for centuries, it also manages to show what turned Victor into the monster that we see during the rest of the movie.Wolverine is just as good as, if not better than, other superhero movies. Which to some people is not saying a lot, but if you look at the three main roles Wolverine does have a lot more talent than some other superhero movies. Hugh Jackman is a talented actor. To say that he is not a talented actor is simply not true. If you don't want to watch him sing and dance (which he has received a Tony Award for) then watch The Prestige, The Fountain, or Deception for proof that he has talent.Jackman gets to a do little comedy to lighten the mood. Liev Schreiber, as Victor Creed, and Danny Huston, as William Stryker, compliment Jackman's performance perfectly. Before he came to the attention of mainstream audiences as Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy, Schreiber starred in independent and small budget features. However, it has been in movies like The Hurricane, The Manchurian Candidate and Defiance that Schreiber has made a name for himself. He's often cast in good guy roles. As Victor Creed, he gets to show us that he can do mean and nasty too.I have a list that I call ""You May not Know the Name, but You Know the Face."" I'm always adding names to it, but rarely am I taking names off. Danny Huston is easily in the top ten. If it weren't for the make up, that made him almost unrecognizable, fans of the comic genre would recognize him as the head vampire, Marlow, in 30 Days of Night. Others may remember him from The Number 23, Children of Men, Edge of Darkness,and in the critically acclaimed HBO mini-series John Adams.A lesser actor would have portrayed William Stryker as a crazed maniac, a Dr. Frankenstein screaming ""Its alive!"", but not Huston. Huston plays Stryker with more reserve that manages to bring out the character's obsession more than any over the top acting could do.There is a bigger reason why I liked Wolverine. What's that reason? I turned my brain off. Maybe not completely off, but definitely down several notches. You almost have to when you watch a superhero movie. For the most part, superhero movies are garbage. If you try and tear them to pieces, as critics like Ebert and Roper do on a regular basis and that I have briefly done, you won't enjoy them for what they are- good, mindless entertainment.Do you have to be a comic book fan to enjoy Wolverine? No. In fact, you will enjoy the movie more if you aren't a comic book fan. You won't get bogged down with the things that will perturb your average comic book reader. Just be a fan of good action movies, turn the DVD player on, your brain off and enjoy the movie.",3,Turn Your Brain Off and Enjoy,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,8749,"['did', ""n't"", 'want', 'like',

1195614,A3MZU8A1ASX8X2,B001GCUO16,"J. Sherman ""The Critic""","[0, 1]","He's a superhero who breaks every stereotype.  He smokes, drinks, kills without mercy and threatens even his comrades.  So it's about time that Marvel's fiercest mutant gets his own movie.  The first of the new ""Origins"" film lineup, it reveals Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) long, choatic past and the transformation that made him the badass comic fans know and love.  The film also explores his ties to William Stryker (Danny Huston) as well as his history with Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), which never came up in the X-Men movie trilogy (just one of many plotholes).This film starts off well enough, with Jackman in all his roughneck, adamantium glory.  Halfway through, however, director Gavin Hood shakes things up a bit.  And by 'shake up,' I mean throwing other X-Men characters like Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) and a young Scott Summers (Tim Pocock) into the mix with no regard for story continuity or logic.  And then there's Hood's version of special-needs merc Deadpool; the only thing he did right was sew his mouth shut.  And even that doesn't compare with the movie's climax, which should have done more lasting damage to Wolverine but doesn't.  So while Wolverine is still the best at what he does, Hood apparently is not.This film is rated PG-13: Violence, Adult Language.",2,Cut Down to Size,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1281,"['superhero', 'who', 'stereotype', 'drinks', 'kills', 'mercy', 'even', 'comrades', 'time', 'Marvel', 'fiercest', 'mutant', 'own', 'movie', 'first', 'new', 'Origins', 'film', 'lineup', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'long', 'choatic', 'past', 'transformation', 'made', 'badass', 'comic', 'fans', 'know', 'love', 'film', 'also', 'ties', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'never', 'came', 'up', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'plotholes', '.This', 'film', 'starts', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'Jackman', 'roughneck', 'adamantium', 'glory', 'Halfway', 'however', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'shakes', 'things', 'up', 'bit', ""'shake"", 'up', 'mean', 'throwing', 'other', 'X-Men', 'characters', 'Gambit', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'young', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'Tim', 'Pocock', 'mix', 'regard', 'story', 'continuity', 'logic', 'then', 'Hood', 'version', 'special-needs', 'merc', 'Deadpool', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'right', 'was', 'sew', 'mouth', 'shut', 'even', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'climax', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'lasting', 'damage', 'Wolverine', ""n't"", 'So', 'Wolverine', 'still', 'best', 'what', 'Hood', 'apparently', 'not.This', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Violence', 'Adult', 'Language']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

1195616,A2E1QTFS01GT4P,B001GCUO16,"J. Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[8, 15]","***SPOILERS***Basically, there were a lot of consistency flaws with ""Wolverine"" and the other ""X-Men"" movies and of course the 30+ years of source material in the comics. After reading many Jackman interviews leading up to the movie's release, I was really shocked by how the movie was a lot different than he claimed it would be, in consistency and overall story. The one comment he repeated over and over and I'm paraphrasing was that he wanted the movie to be like you could watch it, then put in ""X-Men"" and it would literally make you believe that he walked right into that bar in Canada (in ""X-Men"" 1) from the ending of ""Wolverine."" That's not the way I feel after watching it.Basically here are the inconsistencies which really detract from the movie for me as a fan:*Wolverine's origin as a kid and his relationship with Victor Creed AKA Sabertooth--Sabertooth was Wolverine's father, not brother, in the comic. In the first ""X-Men"" they didn't elaborate or even make it apparent that Logan/Wolverine even knew Sabertooth. He was just a throwaway (literally) bad guy, with no character development in the first ""X-Men.""*The facility where Wolverine is ""created"" is NOT the same one from ""X-Men 2."" Alkali lake--you know, where Jean Grey/Phoenix has to save the X-Men--was up in Canada and was completely different.*Deadpool is NOTHING like he is in the comic book, except when he is ""Wade"" at the beginning. The abomination they create at the end is NOTHING like Deadpool and why is it that in these movies they always feel they need to give the final bad guy who is mysteriously created, all of the powers of everyone. Wolverine still dispatched him quite easily.*Memory erased. COME ON, only an adamantium bullet can pierce Wolverine's skull and Stryker is so sure that he is going to hit the right parts of Wolverine's brain to erase his memory...both long term and short term...is that why he shot him 2-3 times? Come on! I think in the other movies (and know in the comics) the memory wipe was part of the whole Weapon X procedure. He escapes the Weapon X facility not knowing who or what he is.*Silver Fox. Unnecessary love interest with Lifetime original movie channel cliched betrayal, forgiveness, then second final death. Honestly, they ruined her good early scenes with the incoherent plot of the 3rd act.*Underwhelming action scenes. For a big summer movie I felt this movie had the least spectacular action scenes. There is one memorable one...where he is on the motorcycle and then gets on top of the military vehicle, just as it gets blown up and he flies through the air towards the helicopter. (And if you saw the trailer, you saw the best action scene already.)*Too many underdeveloped characters. My God, this was supposed to be ""Wolverine"" not ""X-Men 4""--even Jackman was adamant that it not be thought of as that. So why have mutant team after mutant team pop up in the movie? Every character, besides, Wolverine, is so underdeveloped that you could remove them and never miss them. The one unique new character, Gambit, was so underused that it made no sense to have him in it.*Young Cyclops and Professor X. Come on, talk about flagrant cameos that serve no purpose. If Cyclops had been in that testing facility, don't you think he would have remembered it years later when he and the X-Men return to it in ""X-Men 2""? (Marvel, if you need help with continuity, hire me.)Enough about the bad stuff...Hood did a good job with the good actors, getting average to good performances out of them, but with the not so good actors, he was not so lucky.I honestly felt this was a good movie, but fell short of so much potential. 87 million US gross is not bad, but expect a huge drop-off this week due to (a) bad worth of mouth and (b) ""Star Trek"" opening. I think it might break even in the US and then make up money on DVD sales. It won't come close to the ""X-Men"" movies in gross though.3/5",3,Wolverine Spoiled - Spoilers and Complaints,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,3916,"['***SPOILERS***Basically', 'were', 'lot', 'consistency', 'flaws', 'Wolverine', 'other', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'course', '30+', 'years', 'source', 'material', 'comics', 'reading', 'many', 'Jackman', 'interviews', 'leading', 'up', 'movie', 'release', 'was', 'really', 'shocked', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'different', 'claimed', 'would', 'be', 'consistency', 'overall', 'story', 'one', 'comment', 'repeated', 'over', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'was', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'could', 'watch', 'then', 'put', 'X-Men', 'would', 'literally', 'make', 'believe', 'walked', 'right', 'bar', 'Canada', 'X-Men', '1', 'ending', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'way', 'feel', 'watching', 'it.Basically', 'here', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'really', 'detract', 'movie', 'fan', '*Wolverine', 'origin', 'kid', 'relationship', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'AKA', 'Sabertooth', 'Sabertooth', 'was', 'Wolverine', 'father', 'not', 'brother', 'comic', 'first', 'X-Men', 'did', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'even', 'make', 'apparent', 'Logan/Wolverine', 'even', 'knew', 'Sabertooth', 'was', 'just', 'throwaway', 'literally', 'bad', 'guy', 'character', 'development', 'first', 'X-Men', '*The', 'facility', 'where', 'Wolverine', 'created', 'NOT', 'same', 'one', 'X-Men', '2', 'Alkali', 'lake', 'know', 'where', 'Jean', 'Grey/Phoenix', 'save', 'X-Men', 'was', 'up', 'Canada', 'was', 'completely', 'different', '*Deadpool', 'NOTHING', 'comic', 'book', 'when', 'Wade', 'beginning', 'abomination', 'create', 'end', 'NOTHING', 'Deadpool', 'why', 'movies', 'always', 'feel', 'need', 'give', 'final', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'created', 'powers', 'everyone', 'Wolverine', 'still', 'dispatched', 'quite', 'easily', '*Memory', 'erased', 'COME', 'ON', 'only', 'adamantium', 'bullet', 'can', 'pierce', 'Wolverine', 'skull', 'Stryker', 'so', 'sure', 'going', 'hit', 'right', 'parts', 'Wolverine', 'brain', 'erase', 'memory', 'long', 'term', 'short', 'term', 'why', 'shot', '2-3', 'times', 'Come', 'think', 'other', 'movies', 'know', 'comics', 'memory', 'wipe', 'was', 'part', 'whole', 'Weapon', 'X', 'procedure', 'Weapon', 'X', 'facility', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'what', '*Silver', 'Fox', 'Unnecessary', 'love', 'interest', 'Lifetime', 'original', 'movie', 'channel', 'cliched', 'betrayal', 'forgiveness', 'then', 'second', 'final', 'death', 'Honestly', 'ruined', 'good', 'early', 'scenes', 'incoherent', 'plot', '3rd', 'act', '*Underwhelming', 'action', 'scenes', 'big', 'summer', 'movie', 'felt', 'movie', 'had', 'least', 'spectacular', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'memorable', 'one', 'where', 'motorcycle', 'then', 'top', 'military', 'vehicle', 'just', 'blown', 'up', 'air', 'helicopter', 'saw', 'trailer', 'saw', 'best', 'action', 'scene', 'already', '*Too', 'many', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'My', 'God', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'X-Men', '4', 'even', 'Jackman', 'was', 'adamant', 'not', 'be', 'thought', 'So', 'why', 'have', 'mutant', 'team', 'mutant', 'team', 'pop', 'up', 'movie', 'character', 'Wolverine', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'could', 'remove', 'never', 'miss', 'one', 'unique', 'new', 'character', 'Gambit', 'was', 'so', 'underused', 'made', 'sense', 'have', '*Young', 'Cyclops', 'Professor', 'X', 'Come', 'talk', 'flagrant', 'cameos', 'serve', 'purpose', 'Cyclops', 'had', 'been', 'testing', 'facility', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'remembered', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'X-Men', 'return', 'X-Men', '2', 'Marvel', 'need', 'help', 'continuity', 'hire', 'Enough', 'bad', 'stuff', 'Hood', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'good', 'actors', 'getting', 'average', 'good', 'performances', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'actors', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'lucky.I', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'fell', 'short', 'so', 'much', 'potential', '87', 'million', 'US', 'gross', 'not', 'bad', 'expect', 'huge', 'drop-off', 'week', 'due', 'bad', 'worth', 'mouth', 'b', 'Star', 'Trek', 'opening', 'think', 'might', 'break', 'even', 'US', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'money', 'DVD', 'sales', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'gross', 'though.3/5']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195617,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001GCUO16,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","Over the course of the ""X-Men"" trilogy there has been one constant story thread that has been touched upon, yet it's never been fully explored. For those of you that have watched the series, then you most likely know exactly what I'm referring to... the origin of the most popular mutant of all, Logan/Wolverine. Finally, after three highly successful films chronicling the adventures of the X-Men team, 20th Century Fox has chosen to spin-off Wolverine into his own movie and potential franchise by providing his official origin story with ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" presents many key events in Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) life prior to his fateful arrival at the X-Mansion in the original ""X-Men"" film. Beginning with his initial discovery as a youth that he possessed the ability to unsheathe claws from beneath his skin, to his complicated friendship and eventual hatred of his former best friend Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), his time spent working for the government as part of an elite team of mutant trackers, and all of this culminating in a senses-shattering showdown that will leave no one unscathed.The mystery behind Wolverine's origin has been a long-standing plotline, not just in the film trilogy, but in the various comic books in which the character has appeared. In 2001, Marvel Comics began a six-issue limited series aptly titled ""Origin"" that would establish the official backstory for the berserker mutant once and for all. Obviously, so long as interest in the onscreen version of the character remained alive, it would only be a matter of time before his origin, or at least some semblance of it, made it to the big screen as well.Many times with spin-offs, the story tends to be weaker than those utilized for the main franchise; however, this film appears to be one of those very rare exceptions where the quality actually remains intact. Written by David Benioff (""Troy"") and Skip Woods (""Swordfish""), with some elements loosely based upon the mini-series ""Origin"", the story focuses upon some of the various influences, circumstances, and powerful outside forces that shaped Logan into becoming one of the most dangerous mutants on the face of the Earth.The story spends ample time showcasing the extremely visceral nature of the film's two primary characters, Wolverine and Sabretooth, and how they deal with their inner beasts in drastically different ways. Along with this complicated relationship, the film delves into the almost constant, yet subtle, manipulation that eventually led to Logan's decision to participate in the excruciatingly painful Weapon X program, which bonded liquid Adamantium to his bones. It's during these moments of manipulation, mostly at the hands of William Stryker (Danny Huston), that the film's story really shines.Another strong aspect of the film is the sharply written, and often times witty, dialogue. The interactions between the characters felt believable and completely natural within the scenes. Some spin-offs suffer from an over-abundance of clich&eacute;s or merely recycled lines and moments from the original franchise on which they are based; however, ""Wolverine"" easily side-steps these issues in every respect. In the hands of less capable writers that didn't feel some responsibility to keep the quality of the franchise intact, the dialogue, and the rest of the story for that matter, could have potentially gone the way of so many other spin-offs and failed miserably, thus hurting the main franchise in the process. As a fan of the series, I am very pleased by the fact that even though this is the fourth film in the franchise, the creative minds behind the series continually try to surpass what has come before.For all you action fans out there do not worry. This series hasn't lost sight of one of its key elements. Throughout the film's story the action scenes never take a backseat to the drama unfolding within the characters' lives. The fights are much more violent and at times graphic in comparison to the previous three films of the ""X-Men"" franchise; not to mention, even more up close and personal due to fewer mutants with projectile-like abilities. The decision to make the fights even more brutal worked very well alongside the animalistic overtones of the story; although it may have resulted in some parents not wishing their children to see the film, despite the fact that they may have seen the other three in the series.Of course, what would a comic book movie be without the use of visual effects? Well, obviously it would be quite boring, but that almost goes without saying. For the most part, the CGI-intensive sequences were well executed; however, there were some surprising scenes in which the effects looked a bit shoddy. Oddly, enough these scenes involved the use of Wolverine's claws, which by this point should have been mastered and no longer a cause for concern. I'm not sure what caused the problem, if it was a lack of texture on the CGI claws or what, but something was definitely off about them during a couple of scenes. Please note, that these are not pivotal scenes and that the problem was not all that detrimental to the end result of the movie, it's just something that I found frustrating and thought honestly shouldn't have occurred within the film. Otherwise, like I said, the visual effects were very good, and at times numerous sequences were truly awesome to watch and easily overshadowed any of the weaker moments in this area.Lastly, the acting for the film, just as it was in the original three movies, remains consistently high throughout. Despite having played the role of Wolverine three times already, Hugh Jackman is still able to bring a fresh new approach to the character that is crucial to the continued success of the series. No doubt the ability for Jackman to convey such enthusiasm for the role was assisted by the fact that he was so passionate about finally getting to tell the official origin for this beloved comic book icon. Another neat aspect of the character that was explored a little further in this film than in the previous movies was Wolverine's famed ""Berserker Rage"" (comic book fans know what I'm talking about). Although, we don't necessarily get to see an all-out fully realized rage, we are given a much closer look at what he would be like if he succumbed to his unbridled fury, and it was obvious that Hugh enjoyed this new side to the character being explored.Supporting Hugh are some extremely talented actors beginning with Liev Schreiber (""The Sum of All Fears""). Liev takes a role that was relatively wordless in the original film, and was tasked with creating a character that was dramatically rich, incredibly feral, and ultimately could become the nemesis to Wolverine we saw in the first movie. Not necessarily an easy job, but Liev pulled it off perfectly. He delivered a multi-layered villain that was a prime example of what Wolverine could have become if given a couple of different choices along the way, and Liev is clearly relishing every evil moment he gets onscreen. Next is actor Danny Huston (""30 Days of Night"") taking over the role of William Stryker from Brian Cox (""X2: X-Men United""). Danny played Stryker with the perfect blend of subtle manipulation and malice. At times he would be fatherly, especially towards Logan (albeit only to further his own agenda), but then he would snap and show his true colors by unveiling an obviously twisted, sadistic, and potentially unstable man who wanted nothing more than unlimited power to quell the surging mutant problem.Rounding out the supporting cast is actor Ryan Reynolds (""The Proposal"") and singer turned actor Will.i.am (""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa""). I've become a fan of Ryan's work over the last few years, and I enjoy his unfettered sarcasm that he seems to imbue into almost every single character he portrays, but never in a way that feels unnatural or tired within in the role, mind you. In this film, Ryan isn't given all that much screen time, but what he does get he definitely makes the most of by making his character of Wade Wilson (comic book fans know him as the Merc with the Mouth, Deadpool) an enjoyable addition to the group of rogues that Stryker has assembled. Sadly, his role was intended as an introduction to the character in hopes of getting an eventual spin-off for him as well, a tactic that most likely worked given the film's success; however, I for one wish there could have been a little more of the character in this story, not to mention fewer major tweaks to the character's origin that don't line-up with the comic books. But, I digress. Last, but not least, is Will.i.am as John Wraith, a mutant teleporter. Will shows that he definitely has potential, displaying some good comedic timing in a few scenes, and a natural charisma that makes for a more interesting character than I believe he would have been if played by another actor.Directed by Gavin Hood (""Rendition""), ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is an incredibly fast-paced action film that delivers on all counts. Granted there are some gripes with the movie, but overall it's a very solid addition to a terrific franchise. This is a must-see for fans of the original trilogy and a perfect jumping on point for newcomers to the series.""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief

As a Marvel Film and (unofficially) the fourth X-Men film, ""Origins"" delves deep into the history of fan favorite, Wolverine, and opens the floor to ideas for similar ""Origins"" movies. Treated as its own entity or even as an extension to the film franchise, this movie was a great Summer blockbuster for 2009 and proved its worth to the Marvel library. However, for as great as the action was and how nice it was to see Wolverine's rise to become the mutant that he is, there are a few inconsistencies (I know this because I never read the comics but played the games and watched the TV shows enough that even I could spot a couple):-Fred ""The Blob"" Dukes was never a member of Department H; he never worked alongside Wolverine. His allegiance was always to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants-James and Heather Hudson (the couple whom, true to form, helped Logan in the film) were not old retirees; they were mutants who worked for Alpha Flight (where Wolverine served for a time).-Deadpool was known as the ""Merc With the Mouth"" for a reason. Yet, from the moment he becomes Deadpool, his mouth is sewn shut.On a side note (having mentioned members of Department H), was the character of ""Bradley"" (the guy who could manipulate electronics) based off a character that Marvel had previously created (I found his character interesting and would like to know). The same question as above applies to the character played by Will. I. Am (the teleporter). It's not really important but their characters interested me and I wondered if they were based off of the comics or were just made for the movie?I digress. These were the comics/television series. ""...Origins..."" is Hollywood's take on the lore of another of Marvel's more popular heroes. And, in that regard, respect is given where respect is due.

1195620,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001GCUO16,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[9, 17]","The first thing to remember about X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is that it is based on a comic book (admittedly, one I have not read).  If you can remember that, and take this movie as it is meant to be, then WOLVERINE is extremely entertaining.  Just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is a sort of prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films.  In WOLVERINE, we learn about two half-brothers, Victor and James, who are born in the 1800s, both with unusual characteristics.  It seems that these two young mutants are virtually indestructible.  Living through the better part of two centuries, fighting war after endless war, Victor and James become killing machines, better known as Sabrertooth and Wolverine.  The brothers eventually get pulled into a super-secret government unit, whose purpose is unclear, but deadly for those who defy it.  However, James is getting tired of it all, while Victor is starting the like it much too much.  James walks out, walks away, and tries to retire from all the killing.  Unfortunately, as he soon discovers, it isn't easy to walk out on the US Government.  Suddenly, members of the old team are being murdered, and it is up to James to stop the killer.  But, of course, there is more to the story than meets the eye.WOLVERINE starts of with a bang and never slows down.  The action is fast-paced, butt-kicking, and fun.  While the comic book plot is a bit predictable, it is still everything that you want it to be, and more.  The locations and settings are beautiful, the stunts over the top, and the acting great and appropriate to this genre.  Hugh Jackman is WOLVERINE; he has taken this character through four movies and really made it his own.  Liev Schreiber is positively sinister as Sabretooth, radiating violence and malevolence at every turn.  As for Stryker, the leader of the super-secret government unit played by Danny Huston, you pretty much hate him, just as you are supposed to.  The rest of the cast does a fine job, and you get a glimpse of the X-Men movies to come.  Overall, the continuity from Wolverine to the X-Men films is correct and cohesive.X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is not a deep movie; it won't change your life.  But if you want an action-packed, well done, enjoyable flick, then go see it.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","Director Gavin Hood pulls together an enjoyable, if not especially profound, survey of the most popular X-Man's missing years.  Moving mainly in fits and starts through most of two centuries, it shows how a sickly young boy becomes an angry fighter, shrugs off mortal wounds, and loses interest in being alive.  And then, at the last moment, he rediscovers what he believes in--and it costs him everything.Hood teases out little hints dropped in the prior movies, turning disconnected images into a coherent narrative.  Though nothing particularly surprising or revelatory takes place, the film at least acquits itself with a number of good set pieces, a realistic science fiction conflict and rationally motivated characters.  It does a good job setting up where Wolverine came from, and opening doors for where he might go.And the acting is strong.  Hugh Jackman proves once again that he's able to carry off an action hero who suffers the full range of human emotions.  Danny Huston's Colonel Stryker is smart but in love with his own intelligence.  And who knew brainy Liev Schreiber could hulk out and play such a powerful villain?  If there's a real shock in this film, it's a  previously unseen side of Schreiber.All in all, this movie is good.  While it lacks the moving intensity of the first two X-Men movies, it entertains and engages, pulling viewers through a story that keeps us hooked as we wait to see secrets revealed.

It's more violent than the previous trilogy and feels darker - not because of the plot events, since a lot of bad things also happened to the characters in the first trilogy; but the fantasy element is diminished in this one, so I found the dark stuff more disturbing.It was really interesting to see Wolverine's past in such detail, and it explains a lot about how he came to be the character he is in the trilogy.  The acting ability of the kids in this movie leave something to be desired, but the story almost makes up for it.  I really liked seeing Scott as a high schooler.  Gambit was cool, though I wish the story had involved him more; his personality also seemed a bit off from how I've seen him in the comics - the film version didn't have a cheeky sense of humor.[SPOILER (if you don't know much about the X-Men comics)]I _really_ liked Wade and was therefore absolutely HORRIFIED at what they did to him to turn him into Deadpool. I did some research afterward (I'm pretty new to the X-Men universe) and discovered that the way they portrayed Deadpool in this movie is barely even similar to how he's supposed to be in the comics, and that they're working on a version of Deadpool for future movies where he's more like he's supposed to be and not some poor tortured Frankenstein monster.  That was a relief.[END SPOILER]Anyway, my overall thought is that even though this movie is a bit too dark and violent for my taste, I still enjoyed it.

I am not one to usually review movies, as I'm more of a book buff, but it was so good that I had to comment.Taking my love of the X-Men comic books series aside, the movie was fantastic.  There was a ton of action, many open endings (which can be taken both ways, see below), and so much action was covered.  I loved the CGI, though at times it was obvious.  His claws were a bit too cartoon-y, and even in the scene of his first lumberjack job, the bulk machines were obviously not really there.  Also, in the scene with Gambit in the alley, obviously CGI- but I don't really expect the guy to climb the walls in real life.Loved the scenes with Hugh Jackman during Stryker's experiment, but thought the director was trying a little too hard to make Wolverine a love-struck sissy boy.  I mean, Logan is like Bruce Wayne in Batman.  He's hardcore, strong, and revenge-driven.  Maybe Batman vs. Wolverine isn't the best description, but... hey, I hope you get my point.  Maybe I don't remember the comics as well as I believe I do, but I thought the whole Wolverine vs. Sabertooth was due to the dad killings, not the girl.I don't remember many of the characters they brought up, like Wolverine's girl- I don't remember her in the comics, but maybe she came up in a later edition that I just haven't read yet?  I was thankful that they showed that Wolverine volunteered for Stryker's experiment, as it is true to the comics.I wish they made the movie longer because it's hard to keep everything straight with years in between while we're waiting on the movie productions.  The Blob I would have loved more story on.  As well as Gambit.  Even Omega Red (? Didn't name him ?) (Weapon XI) would have benefited from a little more of a story. I was disappointed to see it ended just as the next movies began, but I guess that's expected.  I wanted more of Cyclops as well.Liev Schreiber did a great job of protraying Sabertooth.  Though he was not the same actor who cameo-ed Sabertooth in X-Men I (or was it X II?), I will accept him as the future Sabertooth.The movie seemed short, they overused Wolverine's CGI claws a little too much at the beginning, but... overall I was impressed with the story, the acting, and the true-to-the-books plot.I can't wait for the next origins (I've heard it's Storm next?) and I want more more more of Wolverine's story.  He is my favorite character in the comics.  I think this is one of the movies that Jackman can get right when it comes to his acting skills.  His portrayal of Wolverine (throughout all of the XMen movies) has been stellar, even if it is a bit sappy.",4,Wolverine is So Cool!,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,2648,"['X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'usually', 'review', 'movies', ""'m"", 'more', 'book', 'buff', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'had', 'comment.Taking', 'love', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'books', 'series', 'aside', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'ton', 'action', 'many', 'open', 'endings', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'ways', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'was', 'covered', 'loved', 'CGI', 'though', 'times', 'was', 'obvious', 'claws', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'cartoon-y', 'even', 'scene', 'first', 'lumberjack', 'job', 'bulk', 'machines', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'Also', 'scene', 'Gambit', 'alley', 'obviously', 'CGI-', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'guy', 'climb', 'walls', 'real', 'life.Loved', 'scenes', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Stryker', 'experiment', 'thought', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'Wolverine', 'love-struck', 'sissy', 'boy', 'mean', 'Logan', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman', 'hardcore', 'strong', 'revenge-driven', 'Maybe', 'Batman', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', ""n't"", 'best', 'description', 'hey', 'hope', 'get', 'point', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'believe', 'do', 'thought', 'whole', 'Wolverine', 'vs.', 'Sabertooth', 'was', 'due', 'dad', 'killings', 'not', 'girl.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'many', 'characters', 'brought', 'up', 'Wolverine', 'girl-', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'comics', 'maybe', 'came', 'up', 'later', 'edition', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'yet', 'was', 'thankful', 'showed', 'Wolverine', 'volunteered', 'Stryker', 'experiment', 'true', 'comics.I', 'wish', 'made', 'movie', 'longer', 'hard', 'keep', 'everything', 'straight', 'years', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'movie', 'productions', 'Blob', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'story', 'As', 'well', 'Gambit', 'Even', 'Omega', 'Red', 'Did', ""n't"", 'name', 'Weapon', 'XI', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'ended', 'just', 'next', 'movies', 'began', 'guess', 'expected', 'wanted', 'more', 'Cyclops', 'well.Liev', 'Schreiber', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'protraying', 'Sabertooth', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'cameo-ed', 'Sabertooth', 'X-Men', 'was', 'X', 'II', 'will', 'accept', 'future', 'Sabertooth.The', 'movie', 'seemed', 'short', 'overused', 'Wolverine', 'CGI', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'beginning', 'overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'story', 'acting', 'true-to-the-books', 'plot.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'origins', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Storm', 'next', 'want', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'story', 'favorite', 'character', 'comics', 'think', 'one', 'movies', 'Jackman', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'when', 'acting', 'skills', 'portrayal', 'Wolverine', 'XMen', 'movies', 'been', 'stellar', 'even', 'bit', 'sappy']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

1195644,A17ZEPJC9TR3AM,B001GCUO16,Laura Mayer,"[5, 8]","Wolverine was an entertaining comic book movie, definitely better than X-Men 3.The strengths: Wolverine's background info was interesting and fit well with what was established in the previous X-Men movies. In fact I like this background story more than the trite they've been throwing out in the Wolverine Origins comic book. The actress playing Wolverine's girlfriend is pretty interesting. Gambit appears and doesn't say Chere every two minutes like in the old X-Men cartoon.The weaknesses: Deadpool's character could have been much better represented, especially in the end. He's too powerful and has none of his trademark bantering. Who is the teleporter? Why even have him in the movie at all? Less characters = more time with the characters we do have = we care more about the characters in the movie. Why make the government that experiments with Wolvie the U.S.? That is pointless and stupid. The only reason is take an oh so trendy shot at the U.S. I realize they made Striker work for the U.S. in the X-Men movies, but it was a mistake from the beginning. While many of the special effects looked great, Wolverine's claws when he is standing in front of the bathroom mirror are the worst I've seen in maybe 10 years. But one bad special FX over the course of the whole movie isn't bad.All in all it was a great movie if you're not bringing in your expectations as to how the movie would be made if you were in charge. Unfortunately this happens with many diehard comic book fans. It's a movie. It can't exactly follow thirty some years of Wolverine comic history, and it certainly can't follow the individual expectations of millions of fans. Honestly Marvel Comics can't seem to decide what Wolverine's true origin is. Just watch the movie and see if you like it or not.

His troubles however, have only just begun...Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, however, there is a very noticeable absence of attractive women that we have become accustomed to in previous X-Men films (such as Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, and Rebecca Romijn among others).X-Men Origins: Wolverine is very well written and very well presented, and thus allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over again.

Awful theatrical trailers that make you look at your friends like, ""Seriously?"" generally indicate a bad movie ahead. This movie was preceded by trailers for movies like Transformers, Night at the Museum, and Ice Age. The whole audience was revved up just by the previews.The movie had me from the start... it had a brilliant intro. Who knew Wolverine was so interesting?! It starts with Wolverine and Sabertooth as kids, Jimmy and Victor (respectively). After an incident with their fathers, and discovering they're brothers, they run off and stick together throughout all sorts of amazing experiences. Surviving numerous wars, they are eventually recruited by Col. William Stryker, who has put together an elite team of mutants. Wolverine ends up deciding he'd rather have a life of peace and finds himself a woman. Things start getting nasty when Sabertooth and Stryker team up to gather mutants' abilities in an effort to create a super weapon.I thought it was awesome how they brought in so many characters to tell the story of Logan as he became Wolverine... We see early Scott (Cyclops), Young Prof. Xavier, etc. As soon as Scott heard ""Go Left"" I knew Xavier was close! The new characters were great too! Gambit was downright intense, and Deadpool was amazing with a sword (I couldn't even recognize Ryan Reynolds at the end of the movie).That movie was an intense, action packed movie! I will most definitely buy it the day it hits DVD. It's one of the few movies in a long time that I feel has been worth the $10 to see in movie theatres. The only problem I have with the whole series now is that I loved Liev Schrieber as Sabertooth.

And until the official published work byJemas/Quesada/Jenkins in 2002- was a secret on par with Watergate's Deep Throat in terms of lore and provocation.For regular film fans - that scene is four-and-a-half minutes long. &lt;g>Despite enormous reservations, I found myself actually enjoying this latest installment of the X-Men franchise. Infinitely better than the craptacular disaster of 'The Last Stand'. Good grief, I'll watch almost anything but that shyte pile.Hugh Jackman reminds me of Roger Moore. Why? Because like Moore, he found the one role he was born to play - but sadly it will always be that 'one role' for all of film eternity. Certainly Moore has done other good things, 'The Sea Wolves' comes to mind. But there's no escaping the career defining character that he will be forever linked to - you know it without any prompting. And so goes the career of Jackman.Personally never found any of Jackman's performances, with the lone exception of 'The Prestige', of any worth or value. His acting has the emotional reach and agility of a tree sloth. Don't even ask about his freakish natural smile. Ugh. But as Wolverine - he absolutely rocks. You would be hard pressed to think of anyone besides him in the role of Mr. Berserker Fury. Pitch perfect, the true embodiment of Len Wein's vision.I'm actually a bit surprised and amused to read some reviews which comment on the comic-level characterizations and plot. Seriously? Some people actually thought this was going to be ... what...'The Godfather' in terms of depth of character and storyline?A fun-filled flick filled with decent-to-spectacular special effects. And a big thumbs up for Jackman's superlative, and always reliable, performance in his career vehicle.One last worthy note: Kevin Durand's Blob. I'm genuinely floored to see him take on this role. Until 'Origin', I could not imagine him doing anything other than big bad stud. So this was a real stretch of his acting muscles, so to speak. A repertoire enhancement for him.

Recent releases like WHITEOUT and SURROGATES are both based on comics. And while they're a few years back, the X-MEN movies were always hits. So it's no surprise that the most popular character of the comics and films would get his own solo flick.X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE begins in 1845 when young James Howlett kills a man for killing his father, only to discover that the man he's killed is actually his biological dad. On the run with his half-brother Victor Creed, the pair bound through history, both mutants with the ability to self heal and age slowly. Their killing abilities are utilized in all wars, but it is Victor who seems to enjoy it while James merely sticks with his brother.Fast forward to the Vietnam War with Victor (Liv Schreiber) and James (Hugh Jackman) facing a firing squad only to survive. In prison, they are recruited by General Stryker (Danny Huston) for a unique squad that will covertly take care of problems for the U.S. Composed of various other mutants, the team often rustles each other's feathers, but do the wet work their job requires of them. The killing begins to get to James, now known as Logan, and he quits the team.The scene changes to several years later and Logan is now living happily in Canada as a lumberjack with a woman he loves, Kayla (Lynn Collins). Stryker arrives to tell Logan that someone is killing the ex-members of the team and to be careful. The warning is too late and we are there to see Victor meet up with Kayla. When Logan finds her body, he tracks down Stryker to be a part of his secret project, Weapon X, in an attempt to turn Logan into an indestructible killer. When asked what his dog tags should read, he says Wolverine, a reference to a story Kayla had told him.The procedure nearly kills Wolverine as the scientists inject molten adamantium, the strongest metal known to man, to his skeletal system. Where he once had bones, he now has adamantium. And where skeletal claws once popped from his fists, now shining blades appear. As the process is completed, Wolverine overhears the group planning on killing him. In a rage, he leaps from the lab's tank and takes out anyone in his way, escaping to a nearby farm.But the welcome an elderly couple there provides is short lived as Stryker's assassins kill them both and try to get Wolverine. Once more in a rage, Wolverine takes out the team. But before Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) dies, he lets Wolverine know that Stryker has been behind it all.Wolverine seeks out the rest of the team to find out where Stryker has gone to ground. With the help of two he is sent to New Orleans to meet a mutant named Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), the only mutant to escape from ""the island"", a secret location of Stryker's where he is experimenting on mutants, like Scott Summers and Emma Frost (two main characters from the comics). Out for blood, Wolverine convinces Gambit to take him there and attempts to put an end to Stryker's experiments and Victor for killing the woman he loved.The film is action packed from beginning to end. The scenes and set ups bring to mind numerous images from comics past as well as characters that have become legends at Marvel comics. One is even on fast track to have his own film, Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds. He becomes a major force in the film, though to reveal why would ruin the surprise.The effects are amazing here. Any and every possible effect is used for maximum advantage and it shows. Streets blow up, buildings come down a brick at a time and powers shoot from eyes and playing cards. Not to mention the adamantium claws fans are so familiar with.The acting is better than most would think, with Jackman now comfortable in the lead role. But Schreiber as Victor Creed is amazing. His feline like qualities from his stance to his bloodlust comes off as realistic. And Reynolds as the smart aleck Deadpool deserves his own film.The first time I saw this film I left unimpressed. I think perhaps I was too stoked by the hype surrounding it. This time I got to enjoy it for the sake of the film itself. I wasn't disappointed. You don't have to see the other films to enjoy this one. As a matter of fact, it actually would be better to watch this then the rest. Any way you look at it, you can expect to find plenty of action, plenty of story, and plenty of thrills that will entertain from opening to closing credits.",4,X-MEN Fans Will Find WOLVERINE Cl-awesome!,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,4472,"['Comic', 'book', 'fans', 'are', 'Heaven', 'right', 'now', 'Movies', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'left', 'right', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'Recent', 'releases', 'WHITEOUT', 'SURROGATES', 'are', 'based', 'comics', ""'re"", 'few', 'years', 'back', 'X-MEN', 'movies', 'were', 'always', 'hits', 'surprise', 'most', 'popular', 'character', 'comics', 'films', 'would', 'get', 'own', 'solo', 'flick.X-MEN', 'ORIGINS', 'WOLVERINE', 'begins', '1845', 'when', 'young', 'James', 'Howlett', 'man', 'killing', 'father', 'only', 'discover', 'man', 'killed', 'actually', 'biological', 'dad', 'run', 'half-brother', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'pair', 'history', 'mutants', 'ability', 'self', 'heal', 'age', 'slowly', 'killing', 'abilities', 'are', 'utilized', 'wars', 'Victor', 'who', 'enjoy', 'James', 'merely', 'brother.Fast', 'forward', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Victor', 'Liv', 'Schreiber', 'James', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'facing', 'firing', 'squad', 'only', 'survive', 'prison', 'are', 'recruited', 'General', 'Stryker', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'unique', 'squad', 'will', 'covertly', 'take', 'care', 'problems', 'U.S', 'Composed', 'various', 'other', 'mutants', 'team', 'often', 'other', 'feathers', 'do', 'wet', 'work', 'job', 'killing', 'begins', 'get', 'James', 'now', 'known', 'Logan', 'team.The', 'scene', 'changes', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'Logan', 'now', 'living', 'happily', 'Canada', 'lumberjack', 'woman', 'Kayla', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Stryker', 'tell', 'Logan', 'someone', 'killing', 'ex-members', 'team', 'be', 'careful', 'warning', 'too', 'late', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'Victor', 'meet', 'up', 'Kayla', 'When', 'Logan', 'body', 'down', 'Stryker', 'be', 'part', 'secret', 'project', 'Weapon', 'X', 'attempt', 'turn', 'Logan', 'indestructible', 'killer', 'When', 'asked', 'what', 'dog', 'tags', 'should', 'read', 'Wolverine', 'reference', 'story', 'Kayla', 'had', 'told', 'him.The', 'procedure', 'nearly', 'Wolverine', 'scientists', 'inject', 'molten', 'adamantium', 'strongest', 'metal', 'known', 'man', 'skeletal', 'system', 'Where', 'once', 'had', 'bones', 'now', 'adamantium', 'where', 'skeletal', 'claws', 'once', 'popped', 'fists', 'now', 'shining', 'blades', 'appear', 'process', 'completed', 'Wolverine', 'group', 'planning', 'killing', 'rage', 'lab', 'tank', 'out', 'anyone', 'way', 'escaping', 'nearby', 'farm.But', 'welcome', 'elderly', 'couple', 'short', 'lived', 'Stryker', 'assassins', 'kill', 'try', 'get', 'Wolverine', 'Once', 'more', 'rage', 'Wolverine', 'out', 'team', 'Agent', 'Zero', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'Wolverine', 'know', 'Stryker', 'been', 'all.Wolverine', 'out', 'rest', 'team', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Stryker', 'gone', 'ground', 'help', 'two', 'sent', 'New', 'Orleans', 'meet', 'mutant', 'named', 'Gambit', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'only', 'mutant', 'escape', 'island', 'secret', 'location', 'Stryker', 'where', 'experimenting', 'mutants', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'comics', 'blood', 'Wolverine', 'Gambit', 'take', 'there', 'attempts', 'put', 'end', 'Stryker', 'experiments', 'Victor', 'killing', 'woman', 'film', 'action', 'packed', 'beginning', 'end', 'scenes', 'set', 'ups', 'bring', 'mind', 'numerous', 'images', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'legends', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'One', 'even', 'fast', 'track', 'have', 'own', 'film', 'Deadpool', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'major', 'force', 'film', 'reveal', 'why', 'would', 'ruin', 'surprise.The', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'here', 'possible', 'effect', 'used', 'maximum', 'advantage', 'Streets', 'blow', 'up', 'buildings', 'come', 'down', 'brick', 'time', 'powers', 'shoot', 'eyes', 'playing', 'cards', 'Not', 'mention', 'adamantium', 'claws', 'fans', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'with.The', 'acting', 'better', 'most', 'would', 'think', 'Jackman', 'now', 'lead', 'role', 'Schreiber', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'amazing', 'feline', 'qualities', 'stance', 'bloodlust', 'off', 'realistic', 'Reynolds', 'smart', 'aleck', 'Deadpool', 'own', 'film.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'left', 'unimpressed', 'think', 'perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'stoked', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'time', 'got', 'enjoy', 'sake', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'enjoy', 'one', 'matter', 'fact', 'actually', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'watch', 'then', 'rest', 'way', 'look', 'can', 'expect', 'find', 'plenty', 'action', 'plenty', 'story', 'plenty', 'thrills', 'will', 'entertain', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

I enjoyed it immensely. It served as a great prequel to the trilogy of X-Men movies, and had a rather engaging story and plot. I do wish a bit more could have been given to the back story, but I gotta say, the sequence with the brothers moving from war to war (Civil through Vietnam) was pretty fricking sweet. I can't help but wonder what Victor was doing all these years aside fighting in wars and what made him the way he was, but overall the setup was pretty good.Some people might not like how this movie was done - I wasn't a big fan of all the changes, but again, it's just a movie (and a enjoyable one at that) Personally, I wasn't much for Deadpool, even his makeup was just... garish and overdone. But it makes for a fun prequel, with quite a few familiar faces (including a young and teen-aged Scott Summers) The visuals were impressive.If you really want to enjoy this movie, don't compare it to the comic books so you can nitpick. Just sit back and relax, and let the story and special effects take you away. Hugh Jackman is AWESOME in this movie, he makes a rocking (and very sexy!) Wolverine.

My criticism would be that the movie rests on these things rather than tries to be something better.  Sure, I know there was behind the scene issues which prevented something better, but I still feel that the movie could still have at least made some effort to cut back on the number of mutants and concentrate on Wolverine, the title character.

Billed as X-Men 4 by the movie theater (says so right on my ticket), it is anything but.  This is Wolverine getting the full Weapon X treatment, a mystery that took forever in comic-land to finally reveal. And with a few exceptions, Wolverine gets it right.Whereas the previous X-Men movies became increasingly complex, with jumbled storylines and too many characters, a single character sharpens Wolverine's plot to a knife's edge. Nigh immortal and capable of regenerating from the most grievous wounds, Wolverine and his brother Sabretooth slash their way through the century, engaging in every major war and some minor ones too. For a little while, that's enough, until Sabretooth's propensity for raping and pillaging gets out of hand. A firing squad doesn't do the job (that whole immortal thing), which is when General Stryker offers a devil's deal.There's nothing new here with the exception of the movie's primary x-factor: Wolverine.  Jackman transforms Wolverine from a passive loner to an outraged spirit of vengeance as everyone he loves dies. And behind it all, pulling the puppet strings, is Stryker, channeling Hannibal from the A-Team.Throughout his adventures, Wolverine is surrounded by a cadre of other mutants with their own abilities. Unlike the other X-Men movies, each mutant serves a very specific purpose.  Nothing feels forced.  Except for maybe the Blob, but he's amusing enough in early and later incarnations to provide some much needed levity that borders on the game Super Punchout.The real revelation here is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Reynolds did a great job as a sword wielding antihero in the last Blade movie and he's largely the same wisecracking nut job here.  Only he's much cooler and plays a larger role (think Darth Maul without the makeup).There are some odd points where the Wolverine movie isn't sure where to go.  Stryker, for all his duplicity, often seems content to pull the movie villain mistake of letting people just walk out of his grasp.  Some twists are emphasized with a theatrical exclamation point as the character tells us in no uncertain terms exactly what their plans are. And a few feats of derring-do border on the ludicrous...But then I remember this is a movie about a comic about a guy who has metal claws between his knuckles. If you can keep that perspective, Wolverine is a lot like the titular character's signature move: it tears through crowded plot lines with deadly efficiency. And if you're a fan of other members of the Weapon X program, stay to the end of the credits.

They go on to fight in all the major wars, both being able to heal quickly and being just about indestructible.  In the 1970's, they are recruited by William Stryker (Huston) who is putting together a mysterious team.  While Victor (Schreiber) is comfortable doing the team's dirty deeds, Logan (Jackman) isn't, and breaks from the team to lead a normal life.  Eventually, Victor and Stryker come looking for Logan, so they can return him to his place in that team, but Logan won't go easily, and soon pays the price.With the success of the ""X-Men"" movies, it was only a matter of time before Wolverine got a solo movie, this time in the form of a prequel.  In ""Wolverine"", we get his origins, as well as a look at a number of other new mutants.  We see the bond that Wolverine and Sabertooth have, and we see a glimpse of further X-Men movies to come.  Jackman is clearly comfortable in the role he has played three times before.  He does nothing special here, but he doesn't disappoint either.  Schreiber gives depth to Victor/Sabertooth that wasn't there in the first X-Men movie.  That being said, ""Wolverine"" falters due to an enormous amount of other mutants and a story where the ending is pretty much a given.  It has to get to ""point B"" to stay in continuity with the first X-Men movie, and so there is never any real doubt as to who will live between the characters we have seen before.

1195679,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B001GCUO16,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[3, 4]","Ok, maybe I am a kid at heart, or maybe this movie wasn't as bad as I expected, but I really enjoyed ""Wolverine"". I thought that the story was easy to follow, well written, and full of surprises. For example, I had no idea (because I didn't read the comics and only saw some of the cartoons and the X-Men movies) that Wolverine was Sabertooth's brother (and I am not even sure that this was in the original storyline of Wolverine). I loved that twist and others in the story. And while I wouldn't say that the movie was exactly fast moving and action packed (don't get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes) ...I thought Origins did a wonderful job setting the stage for later X-Men stories. And I now understand why Wolverine has very few memories of his life pre-metal claws. We also got to see several of the characters from later stories (Gambit, Professor X, etc.) and understand how some mutants became X-Men!Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, and I liked Sabertooth's character as well. Understanding the Wolverine/Sabertooth dynamic is key I think, to later stories or even potential storylines.Now a brief synopsis of the movie.....As a young boy Wolverine discovers that everything in his life is not as it seems, and finding out that he has a brother is the least of his worries. For spending years fighting beside his brother has not prepared him for a future of tracking down mutants for his boss, a military man trying to cure his son (who has mutant powers), and eliminating them because they are threats. When Wolverine decides that killing and fighting isn't necessarily fun anymore, and maybe the person they are working for isn't what he appears, he leaves the organization and settles down as a lumberjack. The rest is a story that only you can appreciate if you watch it. Understanding the motives for people's actions is not always as clear cut as you would think, in this movie. There are tales of jealousy, greed, and power woven throughout. Anyway,X-Men Origins, had tons of great characters (interesting mutants with interesting powers) and a sweet love story to boot. I don't see why people are being so hard on this movie because it really wasn't that bad, or maybe it is because I was expecting a lot worse.",4,Wolverine Rocked!,1254873600,"10 7, 2009",2009,2244,"['Ok', 'maybe', 'am', 'kid', 'heart', 'maybe', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Wolverine', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'well', 'written', 'full', 'surprises', 'example', 'had', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'comics', 'only', 'saw', 'cartoons', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'Sabertooth', 'brother', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'original', 'storyline', 'Wolverine', 'loved', 'twist', 'others', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'exactly', 'fast', 'moving', 'action', 'packed', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'thought', 'Origins', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'setting', 'stage', 'later', 'X-Men', 'stories', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'Wolverine', 'very', 'few', 'memories', 'life', 'pre-metal', 'claws', 'also', 'got', 'see', 'several', 'characters', 'later', 'stories', 'Gambit', 'Professor', 'X', 'etc', 'understand', 'how', 'mutants', 'became', 'X-Men', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'great', 'Wolverine', 'liked', 'Sabertooth', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Understanding', 'Wolverine/Sabertooth', 'dynamic', 'key', 'think', 'later', 'stories', 'even', 'potential', 'storylines.Now', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'Wolverine', 'everything', 'life', 'not', 'finding', 'out', 'brother', 'least', 'worries', 'spending', 'years', 'fighting', 'brother', 'not', 'prepared', 'future', 'tracking', 'down', 'mutants', 'boss', 'military', 'man', 'trying', 'cure', 'son', 'who', 'mutant', 'powers', 'eliminating', 'are', 'threats', 'When', 'Wolverine', 'killing', 'fighting', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fun', 'anymore', 'maybe', 'person', 'are', 'working', ""n't"", 'what', 'organization', 'down', 'lumberjack', 'rest', 'story', 'only', 'can', 'appreciate', 'watch', 'Understanding', 'motives', 'people', 'actions', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'cut', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'are', 'tales', 'jealousy', 'greed', 'power', 'woven', 'Anyway', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'had', 'tons', 'great', 'characters', 'interesting', 'mutants', 'interesting', 'powers', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'boot', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'so', 'hard', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'maybe', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'worse']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195680,AMZF6CTXFSJRW,B001GCUO16,Michiru,"[3, 8]","I'm a long-time X-Fangirl, but I'm trying to write this review as a movie viewer, instead of someone who knows exactly where the movie deviated from the comics on a panel by panel basis.  *coughs*Two brothers, Victor (Sabertooth) and James/Logan (Wolverine), join a government program of mutants called Weapon X and fight in a lot of wars.  Wolverine grows disgusted by his teammates bloody actions and quits, appearing years later as lumberjack with a girlfriend named Kayla Silver Fox (which should win the movie an Oscar right there, I tell you).Of course, he can't leave his past behind that easily, and soon finds himself the target of his old Weapon X buddies.  So, he teams up with his friend Kestrel/John Wraith and goes in search of Gambit/Remy LeBeau, the only man who ever escaped Weapon X.  From there, more big fight scenes ensue.The result was a fun popcorn flick.  The action scenes were great, well done and exciting.  Because the movie went for action over characterization, no character was unforgettable.  However, a few were surprisingly interesting.  Deadpool/Wade was funny and deliciously amoral, while Kayla Silver Fox was an unusual heroine, wise and spiritual with an edge of sarcasm.  Unlike, say, the Punisher or Iron Man movies where the time spent on romance made me want to fall asleep, I was interested in Logan/Wolverine's interaction with Kayla.The plot was predictable, but not groan-inducingly so, and it was bolstered by good acting and effects.  Moments of humor broke up the drama, such as naked Wolverine streaking past an old couple.Overall, I recommend ""Wolverine"" to fans of action who don't demand that all plot lines make sense.For fellow comic book fans: there's lots of deviation from the comics, but fans of certain characters are advised to go anyway.  Of course, if you're a Wolverine or Sabretooth fan, you're going to be very happy.  But there are a lot of favorites in smaller roles who get good parts too.  Taylor Kitsch was perfect as Gambit, sexy and disarming one minute, dangerous and violent the next.  Blob was great, a dorky dimbulb who gave us the movie's funniest scene: a boxing match with Wolverine.  And, as stated above, Ryan Reynolds became Deadpool.  He played Wade a bit more staid then we're used to in the books, but it fit, and the old love of violence and droll sense of humor were present.So: action fans will like this one, as will comic fans who aren't purists.

1195684,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B001GCUO16,mitchell5954,"[2, 3]","X-Men Origins Wolverine continues the downfall of the X-Men franchise.  The franchise had already taken a big dive because of X-Men the Last Stand, and this film did not help matters any.  Admittedly, I did enjoy this movie when I first saw it in the theaters.  However, the more I thought about and the more reviews I saw of it, my opinion changed on the film.  I can still watch it as a time waster but that is about it.  If I had to pick between this and X-Men 3 I like this a little more but they are both pretty bad.Obviously this film is goes into Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) origins that the fans have been hoping to see for a while since X2.  We get to see him in the Weapon X program and how he lost his memory.  However, they did such a half-assed job that it would have been better if his origins had been left a mystery.  We got quite a bit of his origin in X-Men 2.  To me that is all that we really needed to know.  This movie to me is very much like the Star Wars Prequels (minus episode 3).  When I finally got to see Anakin's origin and the old republic, I thought that it should have remained a mystery.  To me the prequels kind of make me like the original films a bit less now.  I have the same feeling with Wolverine.First of all why he joined the Weapon X project is lame and uninteresting.  At the start of the film he joined a team with his brother, Sabertooth, and other mutants like Deadpool, the Blob, etc.  However he quits and moves back to Canada.  Later Sabertooth murders his woman, and Wolverine wants revenge.  He goes to striker to be a part of the Weapon X program.  Wolverine's reason for joining Weapon X is due to some flimsy revenge motive that we've seen a million times.I did not find Wolverine and Sabertooth's rivalry to be that engaging at all.  Plus Sabertooth as a character is both uninteresting and inconsistent.  In this movie Sabertooth is Wolverine's brother, but we never got any indication of that in the other movies.  Sabertooth seemed like he never knew  Wolverine in the first X-Men film.  This Sabertooth is quite intelligent, while the one in the first X-Men seemed very stupid and was just there to be the muscle.  In both movies I do not find Sabertooth to be an interesting character.Also they have to through in random mutants into the film for no purpose.  The majority of these mutants are in the film just to be in the film.  Cyclops and Professor X make a cameo which does not amount to much.  Gambit also makes a cameo.  He is basically there because he had not been put into a movie yet until then.  These mutants take away precious time that could have been used to further develop Wolverine.  This should have been Wolverine's film with very few other mutants involved.The worst thing though is what they did to Deadpool.  Deadpool is one mutant that I actually do not mind being in the film because he, like Wolverine, was in Weapon X.  In the comics Deadpool was involved in the Weapon X program and had regenerative abilities like Wolverine.  He is also supposed to be like Spiderman in that he cracks a lot of one-liners.  He is supposed to be very witty.  However, the filmmakers decided to ignore all of that and turn him into a videogame boss.  In this he not only has regenerative abilities but the powers of many other mutants' powers.  Plus is mouth is sealed shut, which takes away a major aspect of his character.  Needless to say Deadpool fans were not happy about these changes to the character to say the least.The action scenes are okay but I have seen better in the other movies including the Last Stand.  The effects are good in some places, but in other places they looked off.  The effects in the other X-Men movies, again including the Last Stand, are much better which is sad because those movies were made years before this.Overall I do not recommend this movie.  This movie could have easily been great but they just dropped the ball.  Hopefully the new Wolverine is actually good.

I know it's not in the same league as the second X-Men film or in the same galaxy as something like The Dark Knight, but I really liked some of the characters and action scenes. The CGI is pretty good for the most part, though for some reason Wolverine's claws looked terrible when he is inspecting the new metal for the first time in the bathroom. Hugh Jackman could play this character in his sleep, but thankfully he put a lot into the role yet again (dude must lift some serious weights). I also thought Liev Schreiber made a fantastic Sabertooth. He doesn't overact the part and manages to inject the right amount of menace. Sadly, fan favorites like Deadpool and Gambit (been waiting for him to enter the mix since the first X-Men movie) aren't given much to do and amount to little screen time. The story itself wasn't as bad as I feared and it moved at a good pace, while leaving room for some quieter moments early on.I enjoyed Watchmen when it came out of couple of months ago and I understand why some didn't. This flick is like the anti-Watchmen. Its sole purpose is to provide the goods for everyone and not trying to be anything special.

In many ways X-MEN Origins Wolverine comes across as a western film littered with Mutants at every turn.Deadpool,The Blob,Gambit,and a handful of other mutant elite make their screen debut during the course of the film while a few familiar faces return as well. liev schreiber gives the character Saber-tooth (simply known as Victor Creed in this film) the big screen portrayal the mutant deserves. Far surpassing the henchmen like role given to Tyler Mane in the original X-MEN movie.Hugh Jackman is bigger than ever with muscles bulging in every scene, though the film falls short of really showing a darker side to Wolverine he never loses the bad ass appeal that makes him so lovable as a super hero.The western vibe works to a large degree but also causes the themes of the original X-MEN trilogy to lose significant power in the process. The idea of mutants simply becomes a cover to display powers as opposed to showing opposistion from the world at large.The biggest problem with this film is that instead of sticking more closely to Wolverine's true origins the film makers attempt to change a little too much for the films own good. The way in which Logan gains his trademark amnesia is bizarre to say the least. Another problem I had with this film is that instead of sticking to Wolverine's origins the film also attempts to tell a larger tale in showing us the beginnings of at least one of the X-MEN and ends up feeling too forced in the end.To sum things up Wolverine is a fun movie packed with mounds of un-ending action that manages to roughly ride over a few potholes in the process. The end product is a mixed bag of adrenaline and dissapointment. The mutants (and humans alike) are intriguing and rarely does an action film cover such a large spectrum of character types but we see far too little of most of them.Bluray quality and special features:Comparing the DVD next to the bluray back to back didn't yield any large improvements though a few small things where noticable.The Bluray has some very nice special features including small bio's for every character played by the actors.",3,A western cleverly disguised as an X-MEN film,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,2247,"['was', 'bound', 'happen', 'movie', 'centered', 'star', 'mutant', 'X-MEN', 'favorite', 'adamantium', 'wielding', 'weapon', 'X', 'experiment', 'Wolverine', 'many', 'ways', 'X-MEN', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'across', 'western', 'film', 'littered', 'Mutants', 'turn.Deadpool', 'Blob', 'Gambit', 'handful', 'other', 'mutant', 'elite', 'make', 'screen', 'debut', 'course', 'film', 'few', 'familiar', 'return', 'as', 'well', 'liev', 'schreiber', 'character', 'Saber-tooth', 'simply', 'known', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'mutant', 'deserves', 'Far', 'surpassing', 'henchmen', 'role', 'given', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'original', 'X-MEN', 'movie.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'bigger', 'ever', 'muscles', 'bulging', 'scene', 'film', 'short', 'really', 'showing', 'darker', 'side', 'Wolverine', 'never', 'bad', 'ass', 'appeal', 'so', 'lovable', 'super', 'hero.The', 'western', 'vibe', 'works', 'large', 'degree', 'also', 'themes', 'original', 'X-MEN', 'trilogy', 'lose', 'significant', 'power', 'process', 'idea', 'mutants', 'simply', 'cover', 'display', 'powers', 'opposed', 'showing', 'opposistion', 'world', 'large.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'instead', 'sticking', 'more', 'closely', 'Wolverine', 'true', 'film', 'makers', 'attempt', 'change', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'films', 'own', 'good', 'way', 'Logan', 'gains', 'trademark', 'amnesia', 'bizarre', 'say', 'least', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'instead', 'sticking', 'Wolverine', 'film', 'also', 'tell', 'larger', 'tale', 'showing', 'beginnings', 'least', 'one', 'X-MEN', 'up', 'feeling', 'too', 'forced', 'end.To', 'sum', 'things', 'up', 'Wolverine', 'fun', 'movie', 'packed', 'mounds', 'un-ending', 'action', 'roughly', 'ride', 'few', 'potholes', 'process', 'end', 'product', 'mixed', 'bag', 'adrenaline', 'dissapointment', 'mutants', 'humans', 'alike', 'are', 'intriguing', 'rarely', 'action', 'film', 'cover', 'large', 'spectrum', 'character', 'types', 'see', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'most', 'them.Bluray', 'quality', 'special', 'features', 'Comparing', 'DVD', 'next', 'bluray', 'back', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'yield', 'large', 'improvements', 'few', 'small', 'things', 'where', 'noticable.The', 'Bluray', 'very', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'small', 'bio', 'character', 'played', 'actors']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195690,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B001GCUO16,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[2, 4]","X-Men Origins: WolverineFor those who waited for this prequel to X-Men, it was worth every moment, every day of anticipation. For those who have never seen X-Men, well, this is a great place to start. In the grand tradition of the comic book, this edition features the origins of The Wolverine, the mutant who is at the core of the storyline.  I do not like to get into plot or storyline too heavily. I despise trailers with their 'let's show them the entire movie in split-second sequencing'. It's designed to monetize, not for the viewer. You'll not get that in my reviews either.There have been some excellent renditions of the `Batman', `Spider-man', and `Watchmen' series' in recent years. With just the right mix of CGI, storytelling, and acting, we have reached new levels in the way comic books are depicted on film. Director, Gavin Hood, has taken these tools and designed an outstanding issue in this, the third installment of the series. The bar now rests at a higher level for those who follow. I enjoy director's who compete with their peers. When they get it right, amazing results are often achieved.Like the original comic book series, a tale can be told with the flourish of great graphics, coupled with minimal, but carefully selected text, to achieve a creative and comprehensible story line. The great artist, Jack Kirby (Captain America, Fantastic Four), was the initial artist in the X-Men series. While not the creator of the `Wolverine' character, I believe he would have approved of the camera work in `Wolverine'. There is great stop action framing, perhaps homage to King Kirby. I also love the angles used in shooting. In many cases, the distant view of the entire scene is shown, much like in the comic books.Hugh Jackman stars as `Logan/Wolverine'. He is perfect in every frame. The effort that Jackman has put into this portrayal is clear. He has turned himself into a physical specimen rarely seen in a starring role since Bruce Lee in `Enter The Dragon'. Add to this his powerful ability to project dialogue in any manner and its clear Jackman is far beyond the coveted `triple threat' that most entertainers aspire to be. His turns onstage as `Curly' in Oklahoma, `Peter Allen' on Broadway, and film roles in `Van Helsing' and ` The Prestige' solidify that fact. For good measure, he was the song and dance, comedic host of the 2008 Academy Awards show.There is excellent supporting talent at every turn in this production. Liev Schreiber is particularly nasty as the `hell bent' Victor Creed. Musician, Will.i.Am,Kevin Durand and Taylor Kitsch all lend nice supporting roles as well. I particularly liked Lynn Collins, as Logan's love interest Kayla.Dominic Monaghan (Lost) lit the way as mutant `Bolt'. He was joined by and `A-Team' group of mutants that put on an excellent display of their superpowers. Rounding out the team was Tim Pocock, Ryan Reynolds (as Hal Jordan/The Green Lantern' in production), and Daniel Henney. Their scenes epitomize what many comic readers love to see in the pages, action packed, and jaw dropping abilities. They did not disappoint here.TechnicalThe Blu-ray edition is vibrant and exceptional at 1924 X 1080p, 120Hz. The sound is fine on all levels at 5.1, dts-HD. The special features are many. They include the customary commentary with the director (Gavin Hood), a great feature with Stan Lee and former writer Len Wein. The back and forth banter is pure gold for fans. So many tidbits of fascinating information are thrown at you, seemingly as afterthoughts. Also included are `Ultimate X-mode' (ability to sit in the director's chair, pre-visualize Wolverine and X-Facts), a helicopter scene, insight segment, and an alternate ending. The language options are English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The subtitles available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Cantonese.",4,Origins of Xcellence...,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,3849,"['X-Men', 'Origins', 'WolverineFor', 'who', 'waited', 'prequel', 'X-Men', 'was', 'worth', 'moment', 'day', 'anticipation', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'X-Men', 'well', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'grand', 'tradition', 'comic', 'book', 'edition', 'origins', 'Wolverine', 'mutant', 'who', 'core', 'storyline', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'get', 'plot', 'storyline', 'too', 'heavily', 'despise', 'trailers', ""'let"", 'show', 'entire', 'movie', 'split-second', 'sequencing', 'designed', 'monetize', 'not', 'viewer', ""'ll"", 'not', 'get', 'reviews', 'either.There', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'renditions', 'Batman', 'Spider-man', 'Watchmen', 'series', 'recent', 'years', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'CGI', 'storytelling', 'acting', 'have', 'reached', 'new', 'levels', 'way', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'depicted', 'film', 'Director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'taken', 'tools', 'designed', 'outstanding', 'issue', 'third', 'installment', 'series', 'bar', 'now', 'higher', 'level', 'who', 'follow', 'enjoy', 'director', 'who', 'compete', 'peers', 'When', 'get', 'right', 'amazing', 'results', 'are', 'often', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'tale', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'flourish', 'great', 'graphics', 'coupled', 'minimal', 'carefully', 'selected', 'text', 'achieve', 'creative', 'comprehensible', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'artist', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'Captain', 'America', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'initial', 'artist', 'X-Men', 'series', 'not', 'creator', 'Wolverine', 'character', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'approved', 'camera', 'work', 'Wolverine', 'great', 'stop', 'action', 'framing', 'perhaps', 'homage', 'King', 'Kirby', 'also', 'love', 'angles', 'used', 'shooting', 'many', 'cases', 'distant', 'view', 'entire', 'scene', 'shown', 'much', 'comic', 'books.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Logan/Wolverine', 'perfect', 'frame', 'effort', 'Jackman', 'put', 'portrayal', 'clear', 'turned', 'physical', 'specimen', 'rarely', 'seen', 'starring', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'Add', 'powerful', 'ability', 'project', 'dialogue', 'manner', 'clear', 'Jackman', 'far', 'coveted', 'triple', 'threat', 'most', 'entertainers', 'aspire', 'be', 'turns', 'onstage', 'Curly', 'Oklahoma', 'Peter', 'Allen', 'Broadway', 'film', 'roles', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Prestige', 'solidify', 'fact', 'good', 'measure', 'was', 'song', 'dance', 'comedic', 'host', '2008', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'talent', 'turn', 'production', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'hell', 'bent', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'Musician', 'Will.i.Am', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'lend', 'nice', 'supporting', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Logan', 'love', 'interest', 'Kayla.Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Lost', 'lit', 'way', 'mutant', 'Bolt', 'was', 'joined', 'A-Team', 'group', 'mutants', 'put', 'excellent', 'display', 'superpowers', 'Rounding', 'out', 'team', 'was', 'Tim', 'Pocock', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Hal', 'Jordan/The', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'production', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'scenes', 'epitomize', 'what', 'many', 'comic', 'readers', 'love', 'see', 'pages', 'action', 'packed', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'abilities', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'here.TechnicalThe', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'vibrant', 'exceptional', '1924', 'X', '1080p', '120Hz', 'sound', 'fine', 'levels', '5.1', 'dts-HD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'many', 'include', 'customary', 'commentary', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'great', 'feature', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'former', 'writer', 'Len', 'Wein', 'back', 'forth', 'banter', 'pure', 'gold', 'fans', 'So', 'many', 'tidbits', 'fascinating', 'information', 'are', 'thrown', 'seemingly', 'afterthoughts', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'Ultimate', 'X-mode', 'ability', 'sit', 'director', 'chair', 'pre-visualize', 'Wolverine', 'X-Facts', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'insight', 'segment', 'alternate', 'ending', 'language', 'options', 'are', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles', 'available', 'are', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'Cantonese']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

The action sequences are very cool and the story moves along smoothly for the most part, but in the end it seemed like it could have been better. It's not the worst super hero film, but it's not the best either. I liked the X-Men movies, but none of them are as well thought out as any on the Spider-Man films...yes including Spider-Man 3!The single disc edition has the movie and some trailers so for fans of the character I think you might want to buy the two discs edition. The DVD transfer looks very good!",3,HEY BUB!

1195696,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001GCUO16,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 5]","After X-Men: The Last Stand left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, I had hoped that X-Men Origins: Wolverine would fix that. Considering that it has director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, Rendition) at the helm and Hugh Jackman behind it one hundred percent, I had figured that a film telling Wolverine's origins wouldn't be half bad. Well, it isn't as bad as some would lead you to believe, but it definitely leaves something to be desired, especially if you're a die hard fan of X-Men comics in the least. I won't really bother going into the story of the film, since so many have already and chances are if you're reading this you already know a bit about it yourself, but I will say that the best parts about the film are definitely Jackman and Liev Schreiber. Jackman, who first played Wolverine nearly ten years ago, is still one of the best actors to ever take on a comic book character period, and Schreiber is almost equally good as his nemesis Sabretooth. Finally getting to see characters like Gambit (Friday Night Lights' Taylor Kitsch), Blob (Kevin Durand), Emma Frost (Tahyna Tozzi), and Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) on the big screen is bittersweet, considering how much their characterizations get mishandled, especially Deadpool, who by the film's end is a shadow of the ""merc with a mouth"" we all know and love, which is even more of a shame considering that having Reynolds in that role should be perfect casting. Other characters show up and disappear like Wraith (Will i Am), Silverfox (Lynn Collins), Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), and Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), while Danny Huston plays a younger Stryker and Tim Pocock plays a young Scott Summers; all of whom are thrown into the mix in a screenplay that is often confusing and non-sensical, and leads to a final fight is just plain incoherent to watch. Character's motivations change at the drop of a hat, and it almost gets to the point that Wolverine ends up playing second fiddle in his own movie. Still, there's enough here to hold your interest, including great performances from Jackman and Schreiber, and some great special effects work as well. Other than that though, I may be a little generous here with the film's rating, as it remains worth seeing for X-Men fans of all ages, but here's hoping that the next time around, we'll manage to get something that recaptures the magic that Bryan Singer managed to weave on the first two X-Men films.",3,"Not terrible, but definitely leaves something to be desired",1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2409,"['X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'left', 'bit', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'had', 'hoped', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'would', 'fix', 'Considering', 'director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'Tsotsi', 'Rendition', 'helm', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'had', 'figured', 'film', 'telling', 'Wolverine', 'origins', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'half', 'bad', 'Well', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'definitely', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'especially', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'going', 'story', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'reading', 'already', 'know', 'bit', 'will', 'say', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'Jackman', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Jackman', 'who', 'first', 'played', 'Wolverine', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'ever', 'take', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'period', 'Schreiber', 'almost', 'equally', 'good', 'nemesis', 'Sabretooth', 'Finally', 'getting', 'see', 'characters', 'Gambit', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Blob', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Tahyna', 'Tozzi', 'Deadpool', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'big', 'screen', 'bittersweet', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'characterizations', 'get', 'mishandled', 'especially', 'Deadpool', 'who', 'film', 'end', 'shadow', 'merc', 'mouth', 'know', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'shame', 'considering', 'having', 'Reynolds', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Other', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'disappear', 'Wraith', 'Will', 'i', 'Am', 'Silverfox', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Bolt', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Agent', 'Zero', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'younger', 'Stryker', 'Tim', 'Pocock', 'young', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'whom', 'are', 'thrown', 'mix', 'screenplay', 'often', 'confusing', 'non-sensical', 'final', 'fight', 'just', 'plain', 'incoherent', 'watch', 'Character', 'motivations', 'change', 'drop', 'hat', 'almost', 'point', 'Wolverine', 'up', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'own', 'movie', 'Still', 'enough', 'here', 'hold', 'interest', 'including', 'great', 'performances', 'Jackman', 'Schreiber', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Other', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'generous', 'here', 'film', 'rating', 'worth', 'seeing', 'X-Men', 'fans', 'ages', 'here', 'hoping', 'next', 'time', 'around', ""'ll"", 'manage', 'get', 'something', 'magic', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'managed', 'weave', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

The fourth film to see Jackman behind the growl of Marvel's popular anti-hero Wolverine aptly spotlights both the charismatic actor and the no-nonsense character that made his career. And a superbly cast Liev Schreiber (as the vicious Sabretooth) helps offset the film's hodge-podge plot and barrage of obscure characters.The story focuses on the relationship between brothers Wolverine (aka Logan) and Sabretooth (aka Victor Creed), from their adolescence to wartime heroics to involvement in the controversial Weapon X program. After being sacrificed to a firing squad (an experience that ""tickled,"" Logan says), Wolverine and Sabretooth are approached by General William Stryker (Danny Huston). Stryker convinces the men to join a team of tough mutants that includes sharp-shooter Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), brawler Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) and wisecracking mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), aka Deadpool.But Stryker's band is decidedly ruthless, and Wolverine resigns (much to the dismay of Sabretooth). Flash forward: Wolverine is living the mountaineer life in the woods of Canada, earning money as a lumberjack and enjoying a romance with school teacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). When former members of Stryker's squad start getting assassinated -- and Kayla is thrown in harm's way -- Wolverine agrees to undergo a procedure (at Stryker's request) that will lace his bones with adamantium, a nigh-indestructible metal.Never trust the government. It turns out Stryker has sinister intentions and Wolverine is fortunate to survive the adamantium infusion. As Wolverine endeavors to dismantle Stryker's nefarious program, he turns to fellow mutants for help, including Cajun-born card shark Remy Lebeau (Taylor Kitsch), aka Gambit, and teleporter John Wraith (musician Will.i.am). Meanwhile, Sabretooth is eager for a brotherly scrap with Wolverine and never seems far from the action.Jackman and Schreiber are so well-cast and are so sharp in their roles that extraneous missteps almost feel excusable. Sure, Jackman could sleepwalk through his part after perfectly portraying the feral hero in three previous films, but Schreiber was a question mark. And Schreiber nearly steals the show with his fanged snarls and wolf-ish movement. Kitsch is also terrific as Gambit, though his New Orleans accent seems to waver at times.But ""Wolverine"" is not without its problems. The filmmakers stray from the character's comic-book origin too much -- seemingly a result of character overload -- and the film lulls in the second act. There's also a sense of lost opportunity, from both storytelling and visual standpoints. In the comics, Wolverine and Deadpool have impressive-looking outfits that could translate well to the big screen in the hands of a gifted costume designer, but the filmmakers take the easy route. Movies such as ""Spider-Man,"" ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Watchmen"" have aptly adapted their title characters' costumes -- so why not ""Wolverine""?Overall, the movie is not unlike the character himself: Rough around the edges but memorable nonetheless.",3,A Decent Pop-Corn Muncher.,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,3302,"['Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Gambit', 'Will.i.am', 'John', 'Wraith', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Sabretooth', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Tim', 'Pocock', 'Cyclops', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Wade', 'Wilson', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Silverfox', '.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'certainly', 'earned', 'claws', 'fourth', 'film', 'see', 'Jackman', 'growl', 'Marvel', 'popular', 'anti-hero', 'Wolverine', 'aptly', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'no-nonsense', 'character', 'made', 'career', 'superbly', 'cast', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'vicious', 'Sabretooth', 'offset', 'film', 'hodge-podge', 'plot', 'barrage', 'obscure', 'characters.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'relationship', 'brothers', 'Wolverine', 'Logan', 'Sabretooth', 'aka', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'adolescence', 'wartime', 'heroics', 'involvement', 'controversial', 'Weapon', 'X', 'program', 'being', 'sacrificed', 'firing', 'squad', 'experience', 'tickled', 'Logan', 'Wolverine', 'Sabretooth', 'are', 'approached', 'General', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Stryker', 'men', 'join', 'team', 'tough', 'mutants', 'sharp-shooter', 'Agent', 'Zero', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'brawler', 'Fred', 'Dukes', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'wisecracking', 'mercenary', 'Wade', 'Wilson', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'aka', 'Deadpool.But', 'Stryker', 'band', 'decidedly', 'ruthless', 'Wolverine', 'resigns', 'much', 'dismay', 'Sabretooth', 'Flash', 'forward', 'Wolverine', 'living', 'mountaineer', 'life', 'woods', 'Canada', 'earning', 'money', 'lumberjack', 'enjoying', 'romance', 'school', 'teacher', 'Kayla', 'Silverfox', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'When', 'former', 'members', 'Stryker', 'squad', 'start', 'getting', 'assassinated', 'Kayla', 'thrown', 'harm', 'way', 'Wolverine', 'undergo', 'procedure', 'Stryker', 'request', 'will', 'lace', 'bones', 'adamantium', 'nigh-indestructible', 'metal.Never', 'government', 'out', 'Stryker', 'sinister', 'intentions', 'Wolverine', 'fortunate', 'survive', 'adamantium', 'infusion', 'Wolverine', 'endeavors', 'dismantle', 'Stryker', 'nefarious', 'program', 'fellow', 'mutants', 'help', 'including', 'Cajun-born', 'card', 'shark', 'Remy', 'Lebeau', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'aka', 'Gambit', 'teleporter', 'John', 'Wraith', 'musician', 'Will.i.am', 'Meanwhile', 'Sabretooth', 'eager', 'brotherly', 'scrap', 'Wolverine', 'never', 'far', 'action.Jackman', 'Schreiber', 'are', 'so', 'well-cast', 'are', 'so', 'sharp', 'roles', 'extraneous', 'missteps', 'almost', 'feel', 'excusable', 'Sure', 'Jackman', 'could', 'sleepwalk', 'part', 'perfectly', 'portraying', 'feral', 'hero', 'three', 'previous', 'films', 'Schreiber', 'was', 'question', 'mark', 'Schreiber', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'fanged', 'snarls', 'wolf-ish', 'movement', 'Kitsch', 'also', 'terrific', 'Gambit', 'New', 'Orleans', 'accent', 'waver', 'times.But', 'Wolverine', 'not', 'problems', 'filmmakers', 'stray', 'character', 'comic-book', 'origin', 'too', 'much', 'seemingly', 'result', 'character', 'overload', 'film', 'lulls', 'second', 'act', 'also', 'sense', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'storytelling', 'visual', 'standpoints', 'comics', 'Wolverine', 'Deadpool', 'have', 'impressive-looking', 'outfits', 'could', 'translate', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'hands', 'gifted', 'costume', 'designer', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'easy', 'route', 'Movies', 'such', 'Spider-Man', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Watchmen', 'have', 'aptly', 'adapted', 'title', 'characters', 'costumes', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'Wolverine', 'Overall', 'movie', 'not', 'character', 'Rough', 'edges', 'memorable', 'nonetheless']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

Why did we need to hear more about Wolverine then we did in X2. Wasn't killing Stryker and learning of those origins enough?No, it definitely wasn't. There was much to learn about Wolverine's very long past, and I say long because somehow they get a hell of a lot of material done in a 1 hour and 47 minutes. From the awesome credits scenes with him and Sabertooth (needed an origin story as well)in various wars, it becomes obvious that a great movie has been made.From the introduction of Deadpool (gets the coolest scenes in the movie) the death of a love of Wolverine's, to his involvement in the ""Weapon X"" program, the movie moves from one to thing to another very smoothly.From great action scenes (Wolverine being shot at on a motorcyle after being admanatium is in him being the best) and some really sad moments when various characters are killed, I completly forgot why I ever cared about ""Bryan's Singer"" ovveratted vision.I would rate this either the best or 2nd best X-Men movie, only possibly 2nd to X3. I know what most people of think of X3, so an explanation is needed for this belief.X-Men was a good movie, but it was obvious that the budget wasn't high enough and just didn't allow for enough explosive action in a franchise that is half about the awesome powers in fight scenes. X-Men 2 got that budget and while having a great story wasted money on a dragged on ending scene (breaking facility=boring) and a lack of anything for Colossus to do. X-Men: The Last Stand (X3) was not dragged on in any way, and while it did insert way too many characters (wasted Colossus and side characters as well), gave Storm more screen time (give her a spin-off for god sakes) and fufilled a excellent storyline involving the pheonix.Yes, Deadpool was a little off in Wolverine. But it was meant to be his origin story as well, wasn't it? Yes. I imagine his spin-off will show us the true Deadpool. And yes Gambit was randomly inserted to please no one. But other characters like Silver Fox, The Blob, and the guy Will.I.AM played (forgot his name) were handled perfectly, which is less than I say for the limited screen time of Storm in any X-Men movie.The next time around, I would like to see no random characters that sacrifice story being inserted. But the action must be kept up and the story must as well. If this is done, the next X-Men movie, whether it be Deadpool, X-Men; First Class, Magneto, or Wolverine 2, could easily be the best.Oh, and if X4 is ever made, I want to see Angel as a main character doing a lot of flying around, Roque realizing her true powers, Professor X-s new body, and Apocalypse causing humans and mutants to team up to fight him.",5,Living proof that Wolverine NEEDED an origin story...,1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,2805,"['Bryan', 'Singers', 'vision', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great.At', 'first', 'idea', 'spin-off', 'origin', 'story', 'Wolverine', 'sounded', 'stupid', 'Why', 'did', 'need', 'hear', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'then', 'did', 'X2', 'Was', ""n't"", 'killing', 'Stryker', 'learning', 'origins', 'enough', 'No', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'much', 'learn', 'Wolverine', 'very', 'long', 'past', 'say', 'long', 'somehow', 'get', 'hell', 'lot', 'material', 'done', '1', 'hour', '47', 'minutes', 'awesome', 'credits', 'scenes', 'Sabertooth', 'needed', 'origin', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'wars', 'obvious', 'great', 'movie', 'been', 'introduction', 'Deadpool', 'coolest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'death', 'love', 'Wolverine', 'involvement', 'Weapon', 'X', 'program', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'smoothly.From', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'Wolverine', 'being', 'shot', 'motorcyle', 'being', 'admanatium', 'being', 'best', 'really', 'sad', 'moments', 'when', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'killed', 'completly', 'forgot', 'why', 'ever', 'cared', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'ovveratted', 'vision.I', 'would', 'rate', 'best', '2nd', 'best', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'only', 'possibly', '2nd', 'X3', 'know', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'X3', 'explanation', 'needed', 'belief.X-Men', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'obvious', 'budget', 'was', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'enough', 'explosive', 'action', 'franchise', 'awesome', 'powers', 'fight', 'scenes', 'X-Men', '2', 'got', 'budget', 'having', 'great', 'story', 'wasted', 'money', 'dragged', 'ending', 'scene', 'breaking', 'facility=boring', 'lack', 'anything', 'Colossus', 'do', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'X3', 'was', 'not', 'dragged', 'way', 'did', 'insert', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'wasted', 'Colossus', 'side', 'characters', 'well', 'gave', 'Storm', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'give', 'spin-off', 'god', 'sakes', 'fufilled', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'involving', 'pheonix.Yes', 'Deadpool', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'origin', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'Yes', 'imagine', 'spin-off', 'will', 'show', 'true', 'Deadpool', 'yes', 'Gambit', 'was', 'randomly', 'inserted', 'please', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'Silver', 'Fox', 'Blob', 'guy', 'Will.I.AM', 'played', 'forgot', 'name', 'were', 'handled', 'perfectly', 'less', 'say', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Storm', 'X-Men', 'movie.The', 'next', 'time', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'random', 'characters', 'sacrifice', 'story', 'being', 'inserted', 'action', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'up', 'story', 'must', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'next', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'be', 'Deadpool', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Magneto', 'Wolverine', '2', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'best.Oh', 'X4', 'ever', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'Angel', 'main', 'character', 'doing', 'lot', 'flying', 'around', 'Roque', 'realizing', 'true', 'powers', 'Professor', 'X-s', 'new', 'body', 'Apocalypse', 'causing', 'humans', 'mutants', 'team', 'up', 'fight']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

I am one of the many people whohave seen it, and me being an X-Men fan (OK, well I wasn't too big afan of X-Men 3: The Last Stand), I decided to check it out. Movies thatexplore the origins of a specific character are usually a dime a dozen,which is why I wasn't looking too forward to X-Men Origins: Wolverineupon seeing the trailer, but I decided to give it a go anyways.The result is that I was surprisingly satisfied! It's not really atypical X-Men movie. Then again, you have to know what you are seeingbefore walking into the theater: an X-Men movie. And Hugh Jackman isexcellent as usual in his performance as Wolverine, the mutant withthose metal claws that come out of his knuckles we all have come toknow and love.This movie is the start of a series of movies that explore the originsof characters. The storyline isn't really as confusing or ""Stupid"" assome people have made it out to be, actually. It's not the best storybut it serves well. Whereas X2's storyline was easy to follow, thisstory IS a tad confusing in some bits. As for the humor- this movieisn't as humorless as people are complaining about, there is lots ofdry humor, And we even get a pretty funny introduction to the characterof Gambit, as well as the boxing match scene is pretty funny too. RyanReynolds' performance as the talkative Deadpool is pretty funny aswell.The action scenes are the real highlight, though. The multiple battlesbetween Wolverine and Sabretooth are very well done, and theintroduction to the newly-embalmed Deadpool is quite stylish too.There's an entertaining chase scene, which ends with a nice finish.I can't really judge the Special effects yet since the finished cut isnot released but I can tell they are going to be great. What WASfinished was pretty impressive, in fact the opening credits played overthe war scenes were full of some great effects. There's some good plottwists too- one towards the end that was very strong and unexpected.Sure there are some let-downs- some of the introductions (most notablyCyclops) were a tad rushed, the ending was a bit too quick, thecharacter of Gambit, while funny, was a bit confusing, the story was atad hard to follow in a few places. But looking past the discrepancies,this is a pretty good film, and they may be fixed with the 15 minutesthey are going to add to the finished cut.

Compound that with the fact that there's barely any respect for the source material, add in the fact that they don't even care too much for sensible continuity to the other films that have been made and you get a pretty awful film. Except commerically speaking, since it does satisfy giving Wolverine his own vehicle and showcasing all the fun things he can do, and throwing in a few mutants who couldn't get crowbarred into the other film series.Even looking at the film on its own, ignoring any source material or other films whose canon or continuity it mutilates or just completely overlooks and ignores, it doesn't hold up. Put on it's own, it needs to be seen as an action movie, and the action was boring and stereotypical. If this movie was made in 1999 the sequences might have wowed me. Too bad that was ten years ago and this movie wasn't made then. What could have been the best sequence with Wolverine on a motorcycle being chased down by two hummers and a helicopter was ruined by a bleached-out looking cgi that screamed fake and the fact that it wasn't choreographed very excitingly.There were some moments I liked, notably Liev Schrieber in general since he's a great actor who really shines in this one. I wasn't feeling the ferocity from Hugh Jackman, although maybe he lost some of his bite trying to trudge through the script without feeling he was losing some kind of integrity as an actor.In general, I've seen Jean Claude Van Damme movies that made more sense, had more emotion, and were less cheesy than them.

1195726,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B001GCUO16,Robert Badgley,"[2, 3]","Marvel comics X-Men character Wolverine gets his own movie X-Men Origins:Wolverine.The movie originally released in North America in May/2009 stars Hugh Jackman as,of course,Wolverine and a fine job he does reprising his role as the fearsome mutant.Legendary comic writer/creator Stan Lee is also back in the production department.The story starts out back in the 1800s as we see two brothers in a room,one sick in bed(it appears as an on going issue)and the other at his side.A man comes in to comfort him and soon has to leave abruptly as there is a commotion downstairs.Not too long after a shot rings out and his ""father""lays dead on the floor.The ""sick"" boy comes out to witness the scene and leaps in rage at the man who appeared to kill his father and kills him.It turns out he has just killed his real father who had come to get his son.The man on the floor was a doctor of some type who had done experiments on his brother and himself.The boys flee their ""home"" for good.The movie progresses ahead through time as the brothers reach manhood and are seen in various wars,world and otherwise;very little aging having taken place.The last war they engage in is the Vietnam War as the Wolverine's brother Victor(Liev Schreiber)has gotten them both into hot water.After a military firing squad fails to dispatch the pair they are recruited from jail to join a black ops project,which turns out to be a mutant squad.The head of this project is one Col.Stryker(Dan Huston).Time passes and Stryker's team is in Nigeria finding out the origins to a mysterious piece of metal called adamantium.It is on this mission that Wolverine calls it quits.Wolverine goes to Canada and leaves the life of a humble lumberjack.In the meantime the black ops mission he left has not stopped but actually stepped up its protocol.They fake the Wolverine's fiancee's death in order for him to become so bent on revenge that he submits to being injected with an admantium compound.He becomes experiment#10,and a successful one at that.He goes after his brother Victor but it turns out Victor is just a red herring.Col.Stryker as usual is the one pulling all the strings.In fact Stryker has been rounding up mutants the world over and depositing them on an island which we later learn turns out to be the infamous nuclear reactor facility of Three Mile Island.The Wolverine makes his way there and in the resulting struggles manages to free all of the captive mutants.His brother Victor,who has been popping in and out of the plot,helps the Wolverine to defeat experiment#11;a composite not only of the Wolverine but of some of the other captive mutants held there.The captives manage to find their way out of the facilities and who should be waiting in a stealth helicopter outside,but Xavier himself(Patrick Stewart).Meantime Col.Stryker has created some admantium bullets to stop the Wolverine with.While they don't kill him the Colonel pops two into his brain which causes a terrible memory loss.The movie ends with the Wolverine on his own,confused and fleeing the authorities who arrive on the scene.The movie,while not jam packed with weird and wonderful mutants showing off their wares like the previous X-Men films(which I can see would a problem with those expecting this),still has many wonderful and exciting moments throughout as the pace/plot winds its way to its inevitable conclusion.We certainly see a more human side to this character and we have much more empathy for him now that we know where he came from and why.Jackman,et al,do a wonderful job in their parts and the special effects are top notch.Technically speaking the movie has been transferred well and is in its original a/r of 2:35:1.The trailer is packaged here along with a featurette on the origins of the Wolverine in the comics and movies.All in all a recommended movie for all fans of the other X-Men films.The movie is fast paced,has some nice action tucked here and there and the S/FX are great.Recommended.",4,The Wolverine gets his day!,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,3975,"['Marvel', 'comics', 'X-Men', 'character', 'Wolverine', 'own',

1195729,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001GCUO16,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","There is a certain kind of potential viewer for this movie that simply shouldn't: the comic book or fantasy fundamentalist. The most extreme example are those silly people who wouldn't see LORD OF THE RINGS because of the removal of Tom Bombadil or WATCHMEN because there was no squid (though in the case of the latter the fact that it was one of the least cinema films ever made is more to the point). WOLVERINE or as it is officially known X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE engages in a great deal of revisionism. Comic fans (of which I count myself) need to chill out. We've seen so many revisions of various comic characters and there are so many incompatibilities between various incarnations that if they do the same thing in the movies, how can we sanely complain? We can have debates about whether the changes are any good, but that things have changed from various versions in the comics is absolutely not a legitimate criticism. WATCHMEN proved that for all time. No film has been so slavishly faithful to a source before, and no film has ever suffered so much as a result.Frankly, this isn't a bad movie. Neither is it a great one. I can name a long string of superhero movies that are better. Heck, I can name four in 2008 that were infinitely better: IRON MAN, HELL BOY II, HULK, and THE DARK KNIGHT (and I rank them in that order), and we are likely to see better Marvel Studios films in the future. But that doesn't mean that this is bad. Did I like every change? Nope. I was especially bothered by the apparent nerfing of Emma Frost, seemingly eliminating her very powerful psychic powers and emphasizing exclusively her secondary mutation of turning into diamond (which is interesting primarily because when she is in that form she loses her emotions and abilities, hence her sometimes nickname The Ice Queen). But overwhelmingly, Emma Frost is psychic, and that is rather too large of a thing in my opinion to leave out. (Though I did find it interesting that in multiple shots they paired Emma Frost and Scott Sommers. Foreshadowing? In the most recent reimaginings of the X-Men Emma and Scott have enjoyed an extremely complex relationship before Jean Grey's death; after her death they are a full-fledged couple.) But I found the creation of a much, much deeper background between Logan and his traditional nemesis Sabertooth to be a lot of fun and fairly compelling.Another group of comic book fundamentalists are going to be upset because the timeline doesn't work, especially with the timeline of the three X-Men movies. But I agree with Emerson that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. And of course there is the complication that we had a completely different Sabertooth in the first X-Men film. But none of this really bothers me. Liev Schreiber is just outstanding as Victor/Sabertooth. He has for many years been one of the least utilized great actors in Hollywood and hopefully after this he will be in more high profile films.The one person I was most interested in seeing in this was Taylor Kitsch, who plays Gambit. A lot of newspapers and magazines and critics, whenever lists are make of ""upcoming stars,"" Kitsch persistently makes an appearance. He has been one of the most exciting young actors on television as Tim Riggins on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, where he not only has displayed lots of acting ability, but has put on display physical charms that make three of my closest female friends declare that he is the most attractive male in the world. But for those who are not watchers of FNL, this could be their introduction to Kitsch. And I have to say that he manages to put on display as Gambit a lot of the same charm that he flashes on FNL. That is one consistent element in Gambit in all of his X-Men appearances, a roguish charm. and Taylor Kitsch has that in spades (no pun intended, given Gambit's skill at cards). It has been interesting seeing how they handle various X-Men in the movies. Some are almost impossibly nerfed, most horribly Rogue, who went from being one of the most dominant X-Men to being one of the lamest, with them stripping her of just about all of her powers. I mentioned above Emma Frost having her greater powers removed. But the strange thing with Gambit is that he is made, if anything, more powerful than usual. My greatest disappointment was, however, with one of the most powerful of all the Marvel Universe entities, Weapon XI, Deadpool. As presented he was simply not very interesting.All in all, however, I found this pretty entertaining. It won't go down as one of the greatest superhero movies. I did enjoy it as much as the three X-Men movies. I think in all four Hugh Jackman has been excellent as Wolverine. The really odd thing about that is that he is utterly wrong for the role. He pulls the hair and facial expressions off, but like Peter O'Toole in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (where the 6'3 O'Toole played the 5'3 T. E. Lawrence), he is far too tall for the role. In the official Marvel description, Logan is 5'3. He is supposed to be stocky and squat and thick, like a wolverine. Still, apart from that he has made this role his own. Unless you are a comic book fundamentalist, you should find plenty in this film to enjoy.",4,"Honestly, it is not that bad as long as you can cut its revisionism some slack",1241222400,"05 2,

This prequel to the Marvel Comics` ""X-Men"" franchise is otherwise a pretty tepid affair, lacking the sharp sociopolitical underpinnings that so distinguished the first installment in the series (the franchise has been in steady decline since that stunning opening salvo).It's true that Logan is a bit of a tortured soul in this film - he just wants to be left alone to live his life as a lumberjack with his beautiful girlfriend by his side, but no one will let him - but it's an inner conflict without much emotional resonance or dramatic impact.

This movie explores his history, which is much deeper than anyone could have possibly expected. We know that he has experienced a process by which adamantium was bonded to his bones, but what we didn't know is that, even before he underwent those experiments, he was....different.We meet Wolverine as a child, along with his differently-abled brother, and watch them grow up, always on the move to prevent local people from catching on.As in the other X-men films there is something of a formula, by now well honed: bursts of action/chase/fighting separated by longer periods of story and dialog establishing the convictions of the characters. As the movie progresses, the action becomes more frequent and intense, until a huge showdown conclusion, with a brief epilog looking toward the future.I appreciated seeing how Wolverine's character and personality were shaped by the experiences which he had undergone as he grew up, and how, strangely, his brother had shared many of those same experiences, yet chosen a different path. This seemed very insightful to me, and very reflective of true life.X-men Origins also features a few characters from some of the other X-men films, at a younger stage in their lives, plus introduces a few new characters.Although I hadn't read X-men comic books in decades, I've enjoyed all the movies in the series, this one as much as any of them.

I'll definitely get the DVD as many female fans are--for the Eye Candy! I love that Jackman is not so full of himself and that his first solo X-men flick--he spread the hottness around. I don't know if he did this because, he feels more comfortable in a group ensemble; or because he just rather give another actor a hand up. Nevertheless, in this movie you get to see more characters and a lot, A LOT of Fine Men.LADIES TAKE NOTE:Ryan Reynolds stands out as Deadpool--so much that a spin-off is in the works. His typical smarta$$ mouth comedy makes his one liners really zing. And the man can swing a pair of swords, and look bada$$ doing so.Also, a lesser known Korean American actor/model Daniel Henney as weapons expert Agent Zero, makes his first appearance on a US movie. He's mostly known for Korean TV, Cinema and modeling. Yet in this flick, his supermodel looks work in his favor as he brings an icey sharp demeanor that make him one to take note of--and makes fans like me pray for a Agent Zero spin-off. His action sequence at the beginning of the film left me wanting more.Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch as Gambit was a big crowd pleaser in Comic Con, and he delivers on the big screen. This one might also have a spin-off in the future. The ladies sure love him and the guys seemed pleased with his deliver of the gambler as well.Howevery I agree completely with other reviews. The plot was weak, and they didn't explain much about Logan's past (which was the purpose of the movie). We kind get a glimpse and quick run through and the rest is all BOOM! BAM! POW! All in all the movie was worth my money. I got a great night out with friends and a lot to drool over for. Thank you Jackman for all that nakedness! *shivers* I am totally still hoping this movie does well on DVD release. Cuz Jackman's such a good guy that he deserves it.I hope in the upcoming spin-offs they do focus a bit more on the plot. Just a wee more than they did on this one. Cuz altho they might have felt the male comic geeks would love all the BOOM! BAM! POW! actions stuff, and female geeks would love all the nakedness and sexy...Sexy Men, we'd also would like a better story line to bring it all together.

The film is an hour and a half, so you can imagine how bad the pacing was. Everything happens so quickly that the characters and the story have no room to breath. It's just bad writing. You really don't connect well with any of the characters and you hardly care about them because there is no damn character development. They focused more on the action and things blowing up than they did with the actual characters.It's hardly an origins story. It's basically everything we already know plus some crap about him trying to find out stuff that really adds nothing to the story. The end is pretty predictable and probably the only scene you need to watch if you've seen the other X-Men films. Overall, it's somewhat entertaining but the title is very misleading. They should have just called it ""Same old Wolverine"" or something along those lines, because the most we learn about him happens within 5 to 10 minutes of the film. The rest is just dull action.

When his father is killed by a gunshot, Logan gets very angry and slices the guy who did it, who turns out, in his dying breath is Logan's actual father.What?No explanation on why this is and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story, other than a plot device to have Logan and his brother (Sabertooth) escape into the forest to fend for themselves.A very fast run through American wars -- Civil, WWI, WWI, Vietnam -- (what happened to Korea?  Oh well) -- find Logan's brother loving the bloodlust to a point where he enjoys killing and nearly rapes a Vietnamese woman until Logan steps in.  Even so, Logan watches his brother's back.Somewhere in there Logan's wife is apparently killed -- more tragedy -- and when Striker steps in, the most oily, sly, deceitful military man in film history, convinces the mutant pair that they were made for better things.Logan gets the adamantium bones and basically escapes with his life.The director found it necessary to fill time, so he gives us an old farm couple that takes in Logan.  Hardly five minutes goes by when they're mercilessly gunned down by Striker's forces.  Why?  Such an unnecessary part of the story and did nothing for the plot other than what a bastard Stryker is, but we knew that.And a CGI version of Patrick Stewart was very, very disappointing!There's a post-credit scene at a bar that does nothing to liven interest in the plot at all.The comic book movie succeeds in filling in the missing holes in Wolverine's past but has enough Swiss cheese in the storyline to begin entering Daredevil territory (YES, I said it!).The brief intro with Gambit and Deadpool was entertaining but disappointingly little was done to flesh out these characters,Rental!Better:X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)",3,Wolverine Back Story Bash -- A Fair Interpretation!,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,2170,"['wanted', 'animal', 'got', 'animal.The', 'story', 'early', '1840', 'Canada', 'Northwest', 'Territories', 'history', 'section', 'Canada', 'was', 'not', 'Northwest', 'Territories', '1870', 'review', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'Wolverine', 'child', 'living', 'brother', 'father', 'Seems', 'Logan', 'mutant', 'bone', 'claws', 'when', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'When', 'father', 'killed', 'gunshot', 'Logan', 'very', 'angry', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'who', 'out', 'dying', 'breath', 'Logan', 'actual', 'father.What', 'explanation', 'why', 'nothing', 'do', 'rest', 'story', 'other', 'plot', 'device', 'have', 'Logan', 'brother', 'Sabertooth', 'escape', 'forest', 'fend', 'themselves.A', 'very', 'fast', 'run', 'American', 'wars', 'Civil', 'WWI', 'WWI', 'Vietnam', 'what', 'happened', 'Korea', 'Oh', 'well', 'find', 'Logan', 'brother', 'loving', 'bloodlust', 'point', 'where', 'killing', 'nearly', 'rapes', 'Vietnamese', 'woman', 'Logan', 'steps', 'Even', 'so', 'Logan', 'brother', 'back.Somewhere', 'Logan', 'wife', 'apparently', 'killed', 'more', 'tragedy', 'when', 'Striker', 'most', 'oily', 'sly', 'deceitful', 'military', 'man', 'film', 'history', 'mutant', 'pair', 'were', 'made', 'better', 'things.Logan', 'adamantium', 'bones', 'basically', 'escapes', 'life.The', 'director', 'found', 'necessary', 'fill', 'time', 'old', 'farm', 'couple', 'Logan', 'Hardly', 'five', 'minutes', 'when', ""'re"", 'mercilessly', 'gunned', 'down', 'Striker', 'forces', 'Why', 'unnecessary', 'part', 'story', 'did', 'nothing', 'plot', 'other', 'what', 'bastard', 'Stryker', 'knew', 'that.And', 'CGI', 'version', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'disappointing', 'post-credit', 'scene', 'bar', 'nothing', 'liven', 'interest', 'plot', 'all.The', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'filling', 'missing', 'holes', 'Wolverine', 'past', 'enough', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'storyline', 'begin', 'entering', 'Daredevil', 'territory', 'YES', 'said', '.The', 'brief', 'intro', 'Gambit', 'Deadpool', 'was', 'entertaining', 'disappointingly', 'little', 'was', 'done', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'Rental', 'Better', 'X-Men', 'Trilogy', 'X-Men/', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United/', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

1195752,A246YIFE5M6M2C,B001GCUO16,"Shawn Kovacich ""Shawn Kovacich""","[4, 9]","I just got back from the movie and let me tell you that although it isn't entirely faithful to the comic books, it is still one heck of a thrilling ride. Now I am not going to post any real spoilers, although I will tell you a bit about the movie.The opening sequence is short but really to the point and quickly explains the relationship between James Howlett (Wolverine/Logan) and Victor Creed (Sabretooth/Logan's older brother) and how James was treated kindly and with love by both his mother and father, while Victor was left under the care of his abusive alcoholic father with no mother whatsoever. This all plays out during the 1840's.After a particularly violent episode, James and Victor leave their respective homes together and proceed to look out for each other as they participate in every major war from the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. A particularly funny scene takes place when both James and Victor are sentenced to die by firing squad after Victor kills a superior officer who attempts to stop him from raping and killing a Vietnamese girl.Things really start progressing from this point and it would truly be remiss of me to give you too many details, but I will give you a bit more about some of the characters.Now some reviewers have been a bit harsh about Liev Schreiber playing the role of Victor Creed/Sabretooth because he doesn't look anything like the comic book version. Well let me assure you that even though he may not look like him, he does and outstanding job of portraying him. Unlike Taylor Mane who did really look like the comic book version, but unfortunately he didn't really fulfill the part at all in the firstX-Men (Widescreen Edition)movie.Ryan Reynolds on the other hand did an outstanding job, as always, playing Deadpool. Reynolds since of humor and delivery has always been enjoyable ever since I seen him inNational Lampoon's Van Wilder - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)and later inBlade - Trinity (New Line Platinum Series), although that movie really needed some help.I didn't much care for the performance of William Stryker, and I thought that the actor who portrayed him inX2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)did a much better job. However, a lot of the character actors throughout the film did a great job. Especially be on the lookout for the performance of the old farmer.We also get a chance to see Fred Dukes a.k.a. The Blob, John Wraith, Emma Frost (although I really don't like how they portrayed her), and of course the ""ragin' cajun"" himself, Gambit. Which I felt was portrayed rather well. I also rather enjoyed the appearance of a younger Scott Summers/Cyclops and his sudden realization of his powers.I only had two HUGE complaints with this movie and actually considered giving it a much lower ranking because of it, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because I am such a fan and really had been anxiously awaiting the release of this movie, along with everyone else I might add.1. I really didn't like the way the director and writers presented Logan's memory loss and thought that they really should have stuck to the original method presented in the comic books.2. The character of Wolverine, as he was portrayed in this movie, was way too wimpy and whiney for my taste. I mean really, all these claws and swords flashing around and through human bodies and yet not a single drop of blood anywhere? They're bone, metal, and fingernail type claws, not lightsabers which cauterize the wounds as they go through them. What's up with that?3. To do this movie justice, it should have been rated R and really shown a vicious and brutal pre-X-Men Wolverine and stayed true to his character. But that is just mine and several million others opinion. What do we know, we are just the fans.Other than that, I really did enjoy the movie. Or did I just enjoy it so much because I am such a HUGE fan and wanted it to be good? I don't know, go to the movie yourself and you be the judge.Now a bit of friendly non-spoiler advice;1. Look for a special guest cameo from a very famous and powerful mutant.2. Don't leave the theater right after the end of the movie.3. And finally, don't leave the theater until after the entire end of the credits.Trust me, it is well worth it!

This also looks at his relationship with his brother, who is excellently played by Liev Schreiber, after they fight in numerous wars together and then become estranged after becoming mutant mercenaries. Jackman plays this just like the other X-Men films, all gruff and angry and there is no real nuance to his acting, but for a gutsy, all action role you don't really need tenderness or finesse. There are plenty of fights and explosions here to keep action fans pleased and this also ties in the later films and introduces some of the characters we are to meet down the line. The story is pretty formulaic and you can guess nearly all the twists and turns from the outset, but for a reasonably decent action film and a worthy addition to the X-Men franchise this isn't too bad at all.

1195781,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001GCUO16,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 4]","Neatly tying in and building upon many of the characters in the mutant universe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine will undoubtedly satisfy fans of the franchise. Anyone else needn't apply. Plenty of action scenes find their way into the origin story, and while most are wildly spectacular with inventively insane stunts, certain superpowers lend themselves to rather staid showdowns and the occasional over-the-top confrontation that no amount of belief-suspending tactics can overcome. In its defense though, it is a comic book movie, and we finally get to see a glimpse of some twin mutant girls.One of the most famous X-Men characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), receives the full origins treatment, and the latest installment in the series chronicles the harrowing events in the mutant's early years leading up to the first film. The year is 1845, and young James Howlett discovers in a cruel twist of fate the consequences of his temper and the power of his mutant abilities. Swearing to stay by his older brother Victor's (Liev Shreiber) side, James fights through several major wars and the duo wind up more than dishonorably discharged for their failure to respect authority. A way out comes to them in the form of William Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy elite military group carrying out dangerous missions with an army of powerful mutants. When an assignment in Africa sours, the brothers are separated and James, now adopting the name Logan, begins a tranquil new life with girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a lumberjack in the Canadian wilderness. But his newfound happiness doesn't last long as Stryker reappears and draws him once again into a world of violence and deception, and Logan must rely on his own cunning, a skeletal upgrade, and the aid of a few new mutant heroes to survive a threat of unimaginable destructive power.The expected staples of blockbuster superhero movies are naturally included, right down to the outlandish fight sequences, pose-striking before and after important battles, slow motion explosions and loud noises galore. Despite all the intense bells and whistles, the generic plot points also find their way into Origins. Brotherly friends find themselves fighting on opposite sides of morality wars, allies hunt down their own kind blindly for a supposed greater good, the villains must create an uncontrollable monster to defeat an even deadlier foe, and innocent victims along with true love stumble into the mess of sacrifices and revenge.Of course the main event is the overload of action sequences sure to numb the senses. But the PG-13 rating puts a brazenly noticeable cap to the violence and bloody realism that could be witnessed when mutants duel with Adamantium claws, swords, and razor-sharp fingernails. Instead, the bloodless fights consist primarily of carefully timed charges like a bull squaring off with a matador, running, yelling and grappling. The cautious attention to avoiding truly bloodthirsty engagement limits creative violence. Even when the hand-to-hand combat looks impressive, the stunts get far-fetched, pushing the special effects to the limit.The mutant super powers are still entertaining, even when they're not specifically defined (Gambit's abilities include a little of everything, although the comics summed it up as the manipulation of kinetic energy), and several new skills get to make a sharp introduction. But perhaps the most fascinating element, the ethical ideas behind living normal lives, concealing inhuman differences, having not asked for such ""gifts"" and choosing to exploit them, which made the original X-Men movie trilogy so thought-provoking, never quite makes it into this new Wolverine spectacle.- The Massie Twins",3,X-Men Origins: Wolverine Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3726,"['Neatly', 'tying', 'building', 'many', 'characters', 'mutant', 'universe', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'franchise', 'Anyone', 'else', 'need', ""n't"", 'apply', 'Plenty', 'action', 'scenes', 'find', 'way', 'origin', 'story', 'most', 'are', 'wildly', 'spectacular', 'inventively', 'insane', 'stunts', 'certain', 'superpowers', 'lend', 'rather', 'staid', 'showdowns', 'occasional', 'over-the-top', 'confrontation', 'amount', 'belief-suspending', 'tactics', 'can', 'overcome', 'defense', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'glimpse', 'twin', 'mutant', 'girls.One', 'most', 'famous', 'X-Men', 'characters', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'full', 'origins', 'treatment', 'latest', 'installment', 'series', 'harrowing', 'events', 'mutant', 'early', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'year', '1845', 'young', 'James', 'Howlett', 'discovers', 'cruel', 'twist', 'fate', 'consequences', 'temper', 'power', 'mutant', 'abilities', 'Swearing', 'stay', 'older', 'brother', 'Victor', 'Liev', 'Shreiber', 'side', 'James', 'several', 'major', 'wars', 'duo', 'wind', 'more', 'dishonorably', 'discharged', 'failure', 'respect', 'authority', 'way', 'out', 'form', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'leader', 'shadowy', 'elite', 'military', 'group', 'carrying', 'out', 'dangerous', 'missions', 'army', 'powerful', 'mutants', 'When', 'assignment', 'Africa', 'sours', 'brothers', 'are', 'separated', 'James', 'now', 'adopting', 'name', 'Logan', 'tranquil', 'new', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Kayla', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'lumberjack', 'Canadian', 'wilderness', 'newfound', 'happiness', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Stryker', 'reappears', 'once', 'again', 'world', 'violence', 'deception', 'Logan', 'must', 'rely', 'own', 'cunning', 'skeletal', 'upgrade', 'aid', 'few', 'new', 'mutant', 'heroes', 'survive', 'threat', 'unimaginable', 'destructive', 'power.The', 'expected', 'staples', 'blockbuster', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'naturally', 'included', 'right', 'down', 'outlandish', 'fight', 'sequences', 'pose-striking', 'important', 'battles', 'slow', 'motion', 'explosions', 'loud', 'noises', 'galore', 'intense', 'bells', 'whistles', 'generic', 'plot', 'points', 'also', 'find', 'way', 'Origins', 'Brotherly', 'find', 'fighting', 'opposite', 'sides', 'morality', 'wars', 'allies', 'hunt', 'down', 'own', 'kind', 'blindly', 'supposed', 'greater', 'good', 'villains', 'must', 'create', 'uncontrollable', 'monster', 'defeat', 'even', 'deadlier', 'foe', 'innocent', 'victims', 'true', 'love', 'stumble', 'mess', 'sacrifices', 'revenge.Of', 'course', 'main', 'event', 'overload', 'action', 'sequences', 'sure', 'numb', 'senses', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'brazenly', 'noticeable', 'cap', 'violence', 'bloody', 'realism', 'could', 'be', 'witnessed', 'when', 'mutants', 'duel', 'Adamantium', 'claws', 'swords', 'razor-sharp', 'fingernails', 'Instead', 'bloodless', 'fights', 'consist', 'primarily', 'carefully', 'timed', 'charges', 'bull', 'squaring', 'off', 'matador', 'running', 'yelling', 'grappling', 'cautious', 'attention', 'avoiding', 'truly', 'bloodthirsty', 'engagement', 'limits', 'creative', 'violence', 'Even', 'when', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'impressive', 'stunts', 'get', 'far-fetched', 'pushing', 'special', 'effects', 'limit.The', 'mutant', 'super', 'powers', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'specifically', 'defined', 'Gambit', 'abilities', 'include', 'little', 'everything', 'comics', 'summed', 'up', 'manipulation', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'several', 'new', 'skills', 'get', 'make', 'sharp', 'introduction', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fascinating', 'element', 'ethical', 'ideas', 'living', 'normal', 'lives', 'concealing', 'inhuman', 'differences', 'having', 'not', 'asked', 'such', 'gifts', 'choosing', 'exploit', 'made', 'original', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'so', 'thought-provoking', 'never', 'quite', 'new', 'Wolverine', 'spectacle.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

Wolverine and his brother are recruited to fight in a special mutant force. The mutants are never introduced. There is an assumption you know these characters from previous movies or comics. I would not recommend this film as an introduction to X-Men.The special forces are more brutal than what Wolverine wants to be. ""This isn't what we signed up for, "" he says as he walks out. He becomes a Canadian and lives quietly like as a lumber jack. His brother is on a rampage...and Wolverine's life becomes disrupted. He must once again fight, only this time he is stronger and is more of a killer.The movie ties in nicely with the other 4 X-Men movies, which should be viewed to get an overall picture, which is difficult to obtain in this film alone. The acting was sufficient. Good CG, super action and fighting. It has plot twists, so pay attention.

1195785,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001GCUO16,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","***1/2In an effort to milk the cash machine dry, studios are coming up with fairly new and elaborate methods of sustaining their tent pole franchises. A tent pole is any film that a studio expects to make a boat full of money by selling tickets, spawning sequels, selling DVDs, selling toys, etc., etc. Generally, tent poles involve superheroes and special effects and hit the multiplexes in the summer, when all of the kids are out of school. Fox hit the payload a number of years ago when they created ""X-Men"" along with Marvel Comics. Two sequels followed and now they have started a new line of films called ""X-Men Origins"". Presumably, the idea is to create a film exploring the myth and creation of each of the individual members of the X-Men. Whether this works or not (an entire film telling the story of Storm doesn't seem to hold as much interest as say an entire film telling the story of Wolverine) remains to be seen. But the first film is out and it is pretty good.Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine and the story begins when he is a child growing up in Canada in the mid 1800s. Logan seems like a sickly child, living with his mom and dad in a palatial home. One night, as a snowstorm rages, there is a fight and Logan stumbles downstairs to find Victor's dad fighting with his father. When Logan becomes mad, he retaliates and kills Victor's dad with his bone talons. Victor learns that he and Logan are brothers and befriends the younger boy, taking him to safety in the forest. In an interesting montage, we watch as the two brothers fight side by side in the Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam. They learn early on that they are virtually indestructible and want to put that and their blood lust to some good. During the Vietnam War, Victor and Logan end up in the brig and General William Stryker (Danny Huston) shows up, ready and willing to rescue them. The General is confident they will make an excellent addition to his team or mercenaries who will carry out very different types of missions. Victor fits in with the new team just fine; Agent Zero (David Henney) is Stryker's second in command and has the ability to control guns, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is your average smart aleck guy along for the ride until he starts to brandish the swords strapped to his back, Bolt (Dominic Monaghan, TV's ""Lost"") can control things, machines, people's thoughts, with his mind, Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) can take a punch and John Wraith (Will I. Am) can make himself disappear and reappear in a different place. This is Stryker's mercenary force and Victor is all about brandishing his teeth and claws and running like the Sabretooth he is into battle. But Logan has had enough of the murder and blood lust and begins to have second thoughts. Years later, Logan is now living as a lumberjack in the Canadian wilderness. Very happy, he has found the woman of his dreams, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Just when Logan thought his life would be peaceful and idyllic, Sabretooth and Stryker reappear to shake things up again. This leads Logan to participate in Stryker's new experiment, and allow him to introduce a strange metal, adamantium, to his bones, making Wolverine virtually indestructible. But Stryker has ulterior motives. When Wolverine learns of this, he escapes and teams up with Wraith to find Gambit (Taylor Kitsch, TV's ""Friday Night Lights""), a New Orleans gambler who can control things moving through space. He thinks Gambit may be able to help him put an end to Stryker's experiments.""Wolverine"" is an interesting film, and it has a lot of great action scenes, but there are problems.I always find it interesting when a high profile, big budget film like this is directed by a filmmaker who has experience on much smaller films; the director, Gavin Hood, first became known for the Oscar nominated South African film ""Tsotsi"". It was a very good film exploring the lives and relationships of a number of people who live in the slums of South Africa. But I would be surprised if it cost $1 Million Dollars. ""Wolverine"", on the other hand, cost more than $100 Million Dollars. Like ""Pineapple Express"", a big budget comedy directed by David Gordon Green, Hood brings a unique sensibility to the material, concentrating a lot of time and story on the relationships in Wolverine's life. This helps to make the film more interesting than a lot of summer movie fare. And this type of situation happens so infrequently in big budget summer films that it warrants mention, which is a sad statement for me to make. Because of the sheer amount of dollars spent on these films, you might expect them to spend an inordinate amount of time making sure the screenplay is perfect, the characters believable, and the story suspenseful. But in many, many cases, most of the money is spent on the action and special effects leaving every other aspect of the film to flounder and flop.Hugh Jackman became an A Lister playing Wolverine, and he continues to give his portrayal of the character everything he has. In ""Wolverine"", we see a slightly different aspect of the character. As a young man, as he fights beside Victor, we see that he is fighting to satisfy a bloodlust, he is putting this need to a good use fighting for our country in many, many wars. It is interesting to see this and fit it into the puzzle of the three ""X-Men"" films and realize this is what Professor Xavier has been trying to help Logan control for so many years.It is also interesting to see Logan truly in love with Kayla. As he thinks he has escaped General Stryker and his team, he is truly happy trying to live a normal life with this lovely woman. They live in a little cabin in the woods. She is a teacher, he is a lumberjack. Sure, he has nightmares, but his life is good. This becomes all the more poignant when you consider his later relationship with Jane Gray.This idyll is soon threatened. Stryker shows up with Agent Zero and warns Logan about someone killing former members of his crew. And Victor has also gone rogue. Soon Victor shows up and tears Logan's life apart. This leads Logan to seek revenge and accept an offer to participate in one of Stryker's experiments. Victor is virtually indestructible, but Stryker has a new metal compound that he wants to fuse to Logan's skeletal structure, making him all the more indestructible and deadly. And Wolverine is officially born.Live Schreiber is very interesting as Sabretooth. Logan's brother, Victor suffers from a similar mutation in that his fingernails can become claws and he grows fangs. This, and his catlike run, make him Sabretooth. But Victor is different from Logan in that he seems to have no remorse when he kills. This makes him more ruthless, more villainous and harder to control.Schreiber seems to have a lot of fun with the role and really sinks his teeth into the character. (Har, har!)Danny Huston also does a good job of portraying General Stryker. Suitably villainous and mysterious, he is working on a project that provides the backbone to the film. He takes the team to Africa when he hears of the discovery of a rare metal substance. Each of the team members has a unique ability and all come into play when they try to storm the compound of an African Warlord. When the warlord realizes his men have been outnumbered and out skilled, he offers the piles of diamonds on his desk. But Stryker wants what appears to be a worthless hunk of metal. It is adamantium.Taylor Kitsch plays Gambit, a New Orleans gambler who has the ability to control the movement of objects. He pops up late in the story but quickly becomes Wolverine's ally and helps him throughout the remainder of the film. He has a coupe of unique powers to offer and these are neat to watch.I have a few complaints with ""Wolverine"". First, in a film labeled ""Origins"", I was sort of expecting to get at least an indication of what caused Wolverine to have this mutation. Why does he have bone claws coming through his knuckles whenever he gets mad? Why is he seemingly indestructible? I can understand why this was left vague in the ""X-Men"" films. But in a film exploring the origins of a single character, we have time to at least touch on this item. Also, since we quickly learn Victor is his brother, and has a similar mutation, I feel it becomes even more important to learn why they have this mutation.My other complaint is that many interesting people are introduced and then simply disappear or seem underutilized. During the scenes with General Stryker, we meet all of the members of his team and see how they utilize their unique powers to help Stryker achieve his goals. When the film picks up a number of years later, we find Bolt (Monaghan) now working at a deteriorating carnival using his powers to unimpress the paying patrons. A brief throwaway line a few minutes later clues us in to the fate of Deadpool (Reynolds). Deadpool is an interesting character and I would like to have seen him in action more.So ""Wolverine"" is fun, filled with action and shows some promise for Jackman. But it also sidelines some of the characters too quickly and doesn't give others enough time to shine.A side note, they are already working on a ""Wolverine"" sequel and a separate film detailing the origins of Deadpool. I wonder if that film will be called ""X-Men: Origins: Wolverine: Origins: Deadpool"".",4,Good - But Not Without Its Problems,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,9364,"['***1/2In', 'effort', 'milk', 'cash',

Before its release--I would come away feeling not all that excited...Which seemed strange since I generally liked all 3 films from the X-Men trilogy.Given those feelings though and the whole leak thing--I was not planing to see this one in theaters...But an opportunity presented itself--and I thought ""What The Heck""...My instincts proved very much corect...The film opens in 1845 where a young James Logan (Troye Sivan) makes 2 shocking discoveries about his family bloodline, First that he has a brother (Michael-James Olsen)--and that they both have strange mutant powers to heal at a rapid rate...We see the mutant siblings battling side by side through two world wars and Vietnam conflict-- where they are sentenced to death for killing a commanding officer...Having obviously survived...Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth, Liev Schreiber) then are recruited to join a top-secret government task force.But as their targets begin to include innocent civilians, Logan 's conscience forces him to flee to the Canadian Rockies, where he builds a home with a schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins).Informed by his old commanding officer William Stryker (Danny Huston) that the old team is being killed off one at a time.Logan is devastated when Victor finds and kills Kayla.A vengeful, Logan agrees to take part in an experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called adamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength needed to defeat his powerful brother. Betrayed by Stryker, Logan (now Wolverine) sets out to find Victor...Along the way, he meets and is joined by fellow mutants like John Wraith (Will i Am) and Remy LeBeau (aka Gambit, Taylor Kitsch). Ultimately Wolverine must battle with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds)We know going in the end of the movie lead into the events of Bryan Singer's first X-Men flick--and while there's action aplenty here--the narrative getting there is a disjointed mess most of the time.Director Gavin Hood, writers David Benioff and Skip Woods along with editors Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill contributed to the ""cut and paste"" feel of things At one point--I even felt like I was watching a scene from executive producer Richard Donner's Superman--as Logan is taken in by an elderly couple who live on a farm. Not sure if that's from Wolverine mythos--if it is apologies--if not then it just felt like another excuse to see more of Jackman's physique then we need to.Mutants are introduced and then quickly dealt out of play--So that we can see the next action set piece.Jackman saves himself by just being Wolverine--I thought Huston was gteat as Stryker. Schreiber as Victor/Sabretooth was OK but I wanted to see how he becomes Tyler Mane's Sabertooth from X1There is one nice surprise near the end of the movie but by then...A sequel is already being planned as well as a spin-off for Deadpool....Better luck next time.",2,Cut To Pieces,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,3011,"['time', 'saw', 'bits', 'footage', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'release', 'would', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'not', 'excited', 'Which', 'seemed', 'strange', 'generally', 'liked', '3', 'films', 'X-Men', 'trilogy.Given', 'feelings', 'whole', 'leak', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'planing', 'see', 'one', 'theaters', 'opportunity', 'presented', 'thought', 'What', 'Heck', 'instincts', 'proved', 'very', 'much', 'corect', 'film', '1845', 'where', 'young', 'James', 'Logan', 'Troye', 'Sivan', '2', 'shocking', 'discoveries', 'family', 'bloodline', 'First', 'brother', 'Michael-James', 'Olsen', 'have', 'strange', 'mutant', 'powers', 'heal', 'rapid', 'rate', 'see', 'mutant', 'siblings', 'battling', 'side', 'side', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'where', 'are', 'sentenced', 'death', 'killing', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Having', 'obviously', 'survived', 'Logan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'brother', 'Victor', 'Creed', 'aka', 'Sabretooth', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'then', 'are', 'recruited', 'join', 'top-secret', 'government', 'task', 'force.But', 'targets', 'begin', 'include', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'Logan', 'conscience', 'flee', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'where', 'home', 'schoolteacher', 'Kayla', 'Silverfox', 'Lynn', 'Collins', '.Informed', 'old', 'commanding', 'officer', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'old', 'team', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'time.Logan', 'devastated', 'when', 'Victor', 'Kayla.A', 'vengeful', 'Logan', 'take', 'part', 'experiment', 'will', 'fuse', 'bones', 'powerful', 'metal', 'alloy', 'called', 'adamantium', 'virtually', 'indestructible', 'strength', 'needed', 'defeat', 'powerful', 'brother', 'Betrayed', 'Stryker', 'Logan', 'now', 'Wolverine', 'out', 'find', 'Victor', 'way', 'joined', 'fellow', 'mutants', 'John', 'Wraith', 'Will', 'i', 'Am', 'Remy', 'LeBeau', 'aka', 'Gambit', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Ultimately', 'Wolverine', 'must', 'battle', 'Deadpool', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'know', 'going', 'end', 'movie', 'lead', 'events', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'first', 'X-Men', 'flick', 'action', 'aplenty', 'here', 'narrative', 'getting', 'disjointed', 'mess', 'most', 'time.Director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'David', 'Benioff', 'Skip', 'Woods', 'editors', 'Nicolas', 'De', 'Toth', 'Megan', 'Gill', 'contributed', 'cut', 'paste', 'feel', 'things', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'scene', 'executive', 'producer', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Superman', 'Logan', 'taken', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'live', 'farm', 'Not', 'sure', 'Wolverine', 'mythos', 'apologies', 'not', 'then', 'just', 'felt', 'excuse', 'see', 'more', 'Jackman', 'physique', 'then', 'need', 'to.Mutants', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'quickly', 'dealt', 'play', 'can', 'see', 'next', 'action', 'set', 'piece.Jackman', 'saves', 'just', 'being', 'Wolverine', 'thought', 'Huston', 'was', 'gteat', 'Stryker', 'Schreiber', 'Victor/Sabretooth', 'was', 'OK', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'Sabertooth', 'X1There', 'one', 'nice', 'surprise', 'end', 'movie', 'then', 'A', 'sequel', 'already', 'being', 'planned', 'as', 'well', 'spin-off', 'Deadpool', '.Better', 'next', 'time']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine

The plot also details his early encounters with Colonel William Stryker, the Weapon X program, Wolverine's interactions with other mutants and his complex relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed.Hearing the reactions from the majority of the people that have seen this film, I'm not surprised that the movie was disappointing. This film suffers from what X-Men 3 did and more: It has too many characters in one short running time, although the film felt like it never seemed to end. Including that, the story wasn't that good and the film felt like it should have never been made. What's the point? Why would anyone want to know the origins of Wolverine? Well, if you do, why would anyone want to sit through such a disappointing origins story?It's apparent the filmmakers didn't spend a lot of time with the whole story. I've never read the comics so I wouldn't know if the film translated what was on page to screen or not. Even in the first few scenes, I was laughing through my mind because of Wolverine's horrible-looking bone claws. The origins story also didn't add much to Wolverine's past. And for the first time, I'll say that the CGI in here was a bit cheesy and very unreal. When Wolverine actually plays with his steel claws for the first time, the CGI looks horrible and cartoonish.With the many characters here, I felt like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and Will i Am were the best ones here. I feel sorry for Jackman, because you can tell he's trying to do his best with the source he has been given, along with the rest of the cast. I found Lynn Collins very annoying, though, as Wolverine's girlfriend. Ryan Reynolds was decent, although he appears for only a short time in the film and Taylor Kitsch was good too as Gambit.With the negatives aside, I liked one thing: Split the film into three parts and I liked the last, third part. I really found the film enjoyable from that to the end, including an interesting way how they connected the last scenes to the first X-Men film. I also found the action sequences above par, especially the last sequence. Overall, I'm not surprised that I was going to be disappointed.

Don't take me wrongly, I love X-men but the thing is most of the time prequels and spin offs really came together badly. So when I heard that Fox is cashing in on Wolvie with Hugh Jackman, my heart sank and tanked.The movie told us where Wolverine came from and how things led up to the first X-men movie. It is a pretty big parameter to deal with. The movie did come along nicely - nicely means no major disappointment. If you love Wolverine and Hugh, you will be able to sit through the two hours without a problem. The major issue with the movie is the story of Wolverine in the comics was so rich and yet the movie story itself was so thin. The back-story changed here and there and was sprinkled with lots of actions. There is no problem with the actions because Wolverine is all about actions, but then the story failed to back it up with a strong line.  Major scripting flaws included if Wolverine could track down Sabertooth miles away with his super senses, how could he not sense the existence of his girlfriend when he first arrived the lab? That is something beyond comprehension. Also how could he not sense the presence of Zero just up the hill too?In order to tell the audience that it is an X-men movie, there are other few well recognised icons in the movie - Scott Summers (aka Cyclops), Gambit, Blob, Deadpool are all in there. But then because it is a Wolverine movie, they are more like cameos,  and not even supporting characters, which is a pity cos some of them have so much potential. The lack of real interactions of these characters with Wolverine failed to enrich the story further.Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine as always but then how many more time can we see him playing the same character again and again? Wolverine as a character is an outstanding character when you see how different he is compared to other X-men, but Fox and Seed Productions failed to capitalise on this very important aspect. Gambit is very cool although I think a lot of Gambit fans would want to see more of him.In terms of production values, there are some awkward moments in the movie that you wonder how could they spent so much money and yet failed to check their cgi's before releasing it. The most notable scenes are the farmhouse bathroom scene and the Professor X scene, which is so obvious that they were incomplete or over-polished. I think that is something quite unforgivable when it comes to a Sci-Fi / X-men movie.All in all, X-men Origins: Wolverine is an enjoyable movie without dull moments. However, how much more can Fox and Marvel bank in on this character will depend on how they approach this character in the future. They wouldn't want to kill the character like Warner Brothers did with Batman or it will go down the history as a joke. The movie is full of actions and great fighting, but it does need a stronger and richer story with stronger and richer characters to support it.",3,Rage on a thin story,1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,2973,"['Did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'expectation', 'X-men', 'spin', 'off', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wrongly', 'love', 'X-men', 'thing', 'most', 'time', 'prequels', 'spin', 'offs', 'really', 'came', 'together', 'badly', 'when', 'heard', 'Fox', 'cashing', 'Wolvie', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'heart', 'sank', 'tanked.The', 'movie', 'told', 'where', 'Wolverine', 'came', 'how', 'things', 'led', 'up', 'first', 'X-men', 'movie', 'pretty', 'big', 'parameter', 'deal', 'movie', 'did', 'come', 'nicely', 'nicely', 'major', 'disappointment', 'love', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'two', 'hours', 'problem', 'major', 'issue', 'movie', 'story', 'Wolverine', 'comics', 'was', 'so', 'rich', 'yet', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'thin', 'back-story', 'changed', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'sprinkled', 'lots', 'actions', 'problem', 'actions', 'Wolverine', 'actions', 'then', 'story', 'failed', 'back', 'up', 'strong', 'line', 'Major', 'scripting', 'flaws', 'included', 'Wolverine', 'could', 'track', 'down', 'Sabertooth', 'miles', 'away', 'super', 'senses', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'sense', 'existence', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'lab', 'something', 'comprehension', 'Also', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'sense', 'presence', 'Zero', 'just', 'hill', 'too', 'order', 'tell', 'audience', 'X-men', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'few', 'well', 'recognised', 'icons', 'movie', 'Scott', 'Summers', 'aka', 'Cyclops', 'Gambit', 'Blob', 'Deadpool', 'are', 'there', 'then', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'cameos', 'not', 'even', 'supporting', 'characters', 'pity', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'lack', 'real', 'interactions', 'characters', 'Wolverine', 'failed', 'enrich', 'story', 'further.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'great', 'as', 'Wolverine', 'always', 'then', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'again', 'again', 'Wolverine', 'character', 'outstanding', 'character', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'compared', 'other', 'X-men', 'Fox', 'Seed', 'Productions', 'failed', 'capitalise', 'very', 'important', 'aspect', 'Gambit', 'very', 'cool', 'think', 'lot', 'Gambit', 'fans', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'him.In', 'terms', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'awkward', 'moments', 'movie', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'yet', 'failed', 'check', 'cgi', 'releasing', 'most', 'notable', 'scenes', 'are', 'farmhouse', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'Professor', 'X', 'scene', 'so', 'obvious', 'were', 'incomplete', 'over-polished', 'think', 'something', 'quite', 'unforgivable', 'when', 'Sci-Fi', '/', 'X-men', 'movie.All', 'X-men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'dull', 'moments', 'However', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'Fox', 'Marvel', 'bank', 'character', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'approach', 'character', 'future', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'character', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'did', 'Batman', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'joke', 'movie', 'full', 'actions', 'great', 'fighting', 'need', 'stronger', 'richer', 'story', 'stronger', 'richer', 'characters', 'support']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195803,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001GCUO16,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","While watching ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" I couldn't help feeling something is missing here, in this special effect-laden ""prequel"" to the ""X-Men"" franchise. It has a lot of actions, but though they are entertaining enough, none of them is really imaginative and some effects look a bit cheesy. It has a lot of characters (including young Cyclops), but none of them are really interesting with no plot or character development. But perhaps what ""Wolverine"" doesn't have is the soul - soul of the characters including Wolverine himself.What you have instead is typical cardboard characters and uninvolving romance / revenge story. The new film tells the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), his half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) and Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy military organization. Sadly, the conflict or complexity within the characters that made the two Bryan Singer-directed ""X-Men"" films something special is totally gone. Victor and Stryker are both stereotyped (psychopathic villain and military villain) and Wolverine is the hero bent on revenge. Such a waste of potential.But of course, it might be that the new film wants to be something different, something with lots of actions and visuals. The filmmakers (including Hugh Jackman himself as co-producer) are entitled to that. However, I don't think Gavin Hood (best known for his Oscar-winning ""Tsotsi"") is the best choice for that job. With poorly-edited actions and not-so-impressive effects, the thrills and suspense is half gone especially when most characters are too stupid to know the obvious results of their choice.What ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" really needs is a good story with more complicated characters like Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier.

I knew that for a character with such a murky and tangled backstory that things would have to be simplified for the audience. But I was in no way prepared for it to be caveman stupid. Before I go on I would like to clarify I am writing this, not as a comic fan, but as a film fan.This movie starts very strong with a well done introduction to wolverine, and sabertooth. We are then treated to an incredibly entertaining segment showing wolverine and sabertooth throughout their very long lives in  extremely awesome battles.After that we are introduced to Stryker and his team of bad-asses. They put several generations of ninjas to shame, and then the movie ends. After that the movie shifts to Wolverine: the studio version. Wolverine gets his ass handed to him for the majority of the movie whether it be his first beating from sabertooth, or from the horrible soul searingly ineffective final villan weapon 11(sobs) Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?! Outside of the opening, the action in the movie doesn't hold up well enough to excuse the awful story.I'm sorry, I lost myself for a minute. Why? Well, the studios were able to get Ryan Reynolds to play deadpool, and he nailed the 5 lines that he was given. After that the next time you see him his mouth has been sewn shut. Not only is that poor writing, but we also lose out on hearing what could have been very clever final battle banter.If you like action than you should watch Star trek. If you want an actual story Watchmen should fit quite nicely. If you want a movie that seems to forget what little plot it had half way through the movie, and either kills off or maims the majority of it's most interesting characters than X-Men Origins: Wolverine is the film for you!",1,They should have stopped after the first fifteen minutes,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,1757,"['did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'knew', 'character', 'murky', 'tangled', 'backstory', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'simplified', 'audience', 'was', 'way', 'prepared', 'be', 'caveman', 'stupid', 'go', 'would', 'like', 'clarify', 'am', 'writing', 'not', 'comic', 'fan', 'film', 'fan.This', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'well', 'done', 'introduction', 'wolverine', 'sabertooth', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'segment', 'showing', 'wolverine', 'sabertooth', 'very', 'long', 'extremely', 'awesome', 'battles.After', 'are', 'introduced', 'Stryker', 'team', 'bad-asses', 'put', 'several', 'generations', 'ninjas', 'shame', 'then', 'movie', 'movie', 'shifts', 'Wolverine', 'studio', 'version', 'Wolverine', 'ass', 'handed', 'majority', 'movie', 'be', 'first', 'beating', 'sabertooth', 'horrible', 'soul', 'searingly', 'ineffective', 'final', 'villan', '11', 'sobs', 'Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy', 'opening', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'enough', 'excuse', 'awful', 'story.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'lost', 'minute', 'Why', 'Well', 'studios', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'play', 'deadpool', 'nailed', '5', 'lines', 'was', 'given', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'mouth', 'been', 'sewn', 'shut', 'Not', 'only', 'poor', 'writing', 'also', 'lose', 'out', 'hearing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'clever', 'final', 'battle', 'banter.If', 'action', 'should', 'watch', 'Star', 'trek', 'want', 'actual', 'story', 'Watchmen', 'should', 'fit', 'quite', 'nicely', 'want', 'movie', 'forget', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'had', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'either', 'kills', 'off', 'maims', 'majority', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'film']",X-Men Origins: Wolverine
1195807,AWRGM17GTMND8,B001GCUO16,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[0, 2]","You know, Wolverine really impressed me within the first hour of the film.  They didn't try to cram too much in and overaction the film.  The weren't making the same mistake they did X3.  We got to see a lot of characterization, which is my favorite quality of superhero films.  I want to see the story and the journey, don't just blow up stuff and throw in riduculous fight scenes to sell movie tickets.  I want reality within the surreal.  The first half of the film really did justice to some of my favorite comic characters.  And the new non-comic book characters (John Wraith and the electric mutant) complimented the film just fine.  Everyones performance in the beginning of the film was fine by my standards.Then something went wrong in the second half.  They tried to put in a bike chase scene, but it ended up being way over the top.  I think everyones a little tired of seeing action heroes walk out of a flaming ball of fire.  The action in general isn't smooth and they didn't pay enough for better CG.  If you rewind before the chase scene we see a bathroom scene where Logan comes to terms with his blades.  This scene takes the cake as the most useless scene in the movie, because the whole time the audience is distracted by just how badly they animated his blades.  They look opaque for christ's sake.So going on we finally end up at Strker's island.  This whole last part of the movie does not sit well with me.  Wolverine learns the truth and then wants to cry and walk away instead of killing stryker.  I'm not saying he should kill stryker, but WHAT WOULD WOLVERINE REALLY DO?  So he walks off and cries and then hears a scream and comes back.  How many times have I seen someone get upset and run away and then come back right before someone dies to save the day? Anyway, by the end we've totally ruined deadpool, and yes I know I can't beg Fox to keep everything the way it is in the comics, but guess what?  Even the producer of this film and all the X-men films says  I regret what happened to Deadpool, I want an entire reboot, I hope we can do that.  You made a beloved killer an indestructable villain, who definately can't make another appearance the way he is right now.  They would have to erase everything they've done to make a Deadpool movie now.  Ok, enough about the film.SPECIAL FEATURES: I think we were sold a little short.  We get a few short clips and about 6 commentaries/picture in picture tracks that play throughout the whole feature film.  Please, I think everyone would rather have more behind-the-scenes segments and less commentaries.  I like both but I don't want to watch the film 6 times to get my moneys worth.  More lengthy behind the scenes, and less ""Fun Facts while your movie plays"".  Trust me close to no one watched the X-facts or the Previsualizing tracks that play througout the movie.  It's just cheap special features.  The first three films have great special features on their blu-rays.  I don't see how this can be so difficult.So all in all, Wolverine isn't bad, but it definately has it's flaws.  It was more of a dissapointment, but it was definately better than X3.  Hopefully, since one of Brian Singers friends is writing the Wolverine sequel, Singer might return to do justice to the franchise.

Hugh Jackman himself even hinted at it. Well, as it turns out, Wolverine is neither of those-nor is it memorable. The plot is somewhat on the silly side, filled with a very boring romance, boring characters and a not-so-interesting backstory on Logan/Wolverine. This movie explains the reason for his turning to Stryker to essentially become 'Wolverine' and the reason is pretty ridiculous. There is just something missing from this film that has plenty of action, but still feels empty. The scene in X-men 2 with Logan getting the adamantium metal insterted is completely redone here, and not in a good way- I thought they botched this up badly. In X-Men 2, Wolverine escaped a bleeding, distraught mess. In Wolverine, it was done rather plainly and not so interesting.I applaud Hugh Jackman for acting as if he actually WANTS to be in this film, as the rest of the actors sort of just appear and say their lines. Jackman really puts 100% in his role and though his character isn't as described in the comics, he is still very likable. His half-brother, Victor Creed, played by Liev Schreiber, should also be commended. He is clearly having a ball with his role, though his backstory is as bland as Logan's. The rest of the characters are extremely forgettable, and that includes Deadpool and Gambit-the latter has maybe 10 min of pointless screentime. There is a silly battle at the end featuring Deadpool and Wolverine and a boring ending.

In short:  The movie is a simple, soulless action movie that really doesn't give justice to its primary characters.  No character ever has a chance to develop a distinct personality, and we only understand Logan because of the fact that he has been a key player in three other films.Hugh Jackman is a wonderful, very promising actor who is somewhat typecast as Wolverine at this point -somewhat sad since he's had many better performances- but he never is really given a chance to display his acting talent a single time in this film.  This movie is a rock'em sock'em with no point to it other than the filmmakers wondering how many action scenes they can jam pack into its short running time.The point of the film seemed to be someone asking ""How many mutants can we stuff into a single X-Men movie?"" and then they just went from there.  Instead of actually giving us a chance to learn more about the character of Wolverine we end up with 90-minutes of pure action and zero in the way of character development.Now I know summer movies are supposed to be big, dumb fun, but when we had two great movies (X-Men, X2) building up this film's title character the result is his origin isn't nearly as interesting, or exciting as those films would have lead us to believe.The film is built on clich&eacute;s and has no interesting characters.  I would recommend skipping this film if you want to preserve the mystery of the Wolverine character you were given in the first films, because this ""Origin Story"" is bound to seriously disappoint you.

But they took way too many liberties in breaking from the story continuity of the comics. I tried giving this movie a chance after all the rumors and meet it with a open mind, and I did. I understand if they went to his childhood origin series and made it from front to back of the story that would be a whole other movie. That being said there was no mention of Rose who helped Logan escape from his home not Victor Creed that hit me like a hammer in the face considering that series was just out a few years ago.They totally debunked the whole Weapon X series by Barry Winsor Smith with him volunteering for the Project. He was abducted against his will and forced into the project which not only builds more sympathy for Logan but builds on the tragedy of the hero. Silver Fox was from his distant past and her Death was a memory implant and not the reason for his sole hate for Sabertooth.There intertwined family history was never fully established in the comics. But it is a fair and reasonable liberty to take to say that Victor Creed was Dog from origins and Wolverines Brother. They should have made this a R rated movie to truly do this justice like when James aka Logan kills his real Father when he 1st pops his claws they should have when by the books and had the mother call him an abomination and have her kill herself right in front of him with the shotgun since that was the beginning moment when James ceased to exist and Logan was born.Last but not least that Adamantium round through the Adamantium laced skull thing to erase his Memory. Totally false when wolverine went up against Captain America his claws bounced off Caps Adamantium + Vibranium shield, and when going up against Cyber his old enemy with the Adamantium laced skin Wolverines claws bounced right off. In both cases Adamantium is unable to pierce through Adamantium. In short that bullet should have bounced right off not go through his skull, and Adamantium spine Hello no way you can decapitate him guys like you were wanting some of the actors to do in the movie.For someone who never read Wolverine this is a great movie.

1195826,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001GCUO16,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 7]","Seeking to further capitalize on the popularity of Marvel's favorite mutant group, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a prequel of sorts to the X-men trilogy. I'll get right to the point, if you thought Bret Rattner's ""X-Men Last Stand"" was a mockery of the franchise, then ""Wolverine"" provides some redemption. This latest spin-off won't exactly offer anything groundbreaking but it is an improvement over Rattner's version. Director Gavin Hood`s (King Solomon`s Mines, 2004) ""Wolverine"" is just popcorn entertainment that combines the usual Hollywood fare with some comic book references.Logan was born in the 19th century. He was in puberty when his mutant powers began to manifest itself and his life had a tragic twist when his father died. Being endowed with a fantastic healing factor that slows his aging, Logan (now played by Hugh Jackman) and his companion Victor Creed (Liev Schreider) fought many wars for many decades. After being recruited by a sleeper group led by colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) for an unknown mission. Differences caused Logan to abandon his post and he finds a simple but quiet life with a beautiful woman named Kayla  Silverfox (sexy Lynn Collins). But Logan's past have caught up to him that resulted with his beautiful girlfriend being killed by Creed (who would later become Sabretooth). Logan is thristy for vengeance as he agrees to be part of a ""weapon X"" program that would further enhance his mutant powers.The screenplay by David Beniott and Skip Woods combines the usual Hollywood mechanics such as revenge, love and betrayal to references from the comic book. The film carries some strong ties to ""Origin"", ""Weapon X"" and even issues from the X-men comic series. The film has its share of ""iconic"" comic book scenes. However, the film doesn't have any blood or gore as portrayed in ""Weapon X"". Familiar characters are a welcome treat to comic book fans as we see Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), Deadpool (?) (shortly played by Ryan Reynolds) and William Stryker. Those who are ""X-men veteran readers"" would recognize Emma Frost, the Blob, Cyclops and the appearance of Logan's lost love Silverfox; these references are indeed a good part of our favorite ""canucklehead`s"" life. ""Weapon 11"" and Xavier also makes an appearance. I was a little disappointed that the film didn't touch on Logan's time in Japan, but I suppose that if it did, it would slow the film's pace too much. The film also touches upon the element of friendship as brought into exposition by Creed and Logan's relationship. Creed loses a part of his humanity with each kill, and Logan tries to hold on any remaining sense of humanity. Creed embraces this fate he believes is his destiny while Logan only wants to stay within his brand of morality.The direction by Gavin Hood was decently played and does feel energetic. Hood manages to keep the film's pace very compressed and full of forward momentum in its 90+ minute runtime. While the film is undoubtedly crippled by certain blunders and some holes, Hood manages to keep the film moving that viewers will take notice of its entertainment value much more than its very simple plot. Th appearance of its characters does pay some welcome ""tribute"" to the comic books but most of them did feel absolutely unnecessary than to be a simple comic book eye candy since there are too many to develop. Director Gavin Hood revitalizes the screen with elaborate stuntwork, cool fight sequences, great CGI effects, and a lot of explosions--all in an attempt to cover up its very weak plot. The performances were decent for the most part, although I thought Stryker made for a somewhat underwhelming villain. Danny Huston was good but not entirely convincing. Liev Schneider made a good ""Victor Creed"" and his chemistry with Jackman was pretty palatable. Jackman well, is Jackman, he looks and feels the same as in the X-men movies.We will see Hugh Jackman all pumped up and oiled up to emphasize his nice physique, complete with ""macho"" posturing and facial expressions that look very reminiscent to the renderings of Jim Lee and John Byrne in the X-men comic series. Jackman does deliver as our favorite ""canucklehead"" although we have to take note than Logan should be a lot shorter, hairier and stockier than the actor. There is plenty of action scenes to be had with ""Wolverine"". The encounters with Agent Zero's group as Logan slices through a helicopter and Humvees are very cool to watch. The final encounter with Logan and Creed could've been a lot better and I thought it ended in a very perfunctory manner. The brawl on top of reactor was the exact exclamation point that Hood was looking for and he does somewhat achieve his goal.I suppose ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" does provide a credible backstory (considering Bryan Singer's groundwork) to our favorite mutant. Keep in mind that this is your usual Hollywood serving, beautifying up the film, and stays safe to be within the guidelines of PG-13. It does try to stay faithful to its source material but it does have its weaknesses. The action proves to be a good diversion and would likely impress action junkies. As a film, it does not offer anything memorable, but at least its wasn't too much of a travesty as ""..Last Stand"" was. Yes, it is better than Rattner's take of the X-men franchise but won't approach the status of becoming an instant ""comic book adapted classic"". ""Wolverine"" won't reinvent the X-men franchise but thankfully it doesn't hurt it either.Recommended!

1195828,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001GCUO16,Wuchak,"[0, 1]","I admit that 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" started out pretty shaky with the cartoony action sequence after the opening credits (Stryker's force raiding a facility in Nigeria), but the film found its footing and kicked total axx. I like it for the most basic reason people like movies: The story and its characters pulled me in and kept my attention; I was entertained, pure and simple. How so?For one thing, the movie effectively accomplished precisely what it set out to do - unveil Wolverine's origin. It shows Logan's early family, however brief; it establishes his relationship with his brother, Victor; it shows his participation in all the American wars since the Civil War in an excellent opening credits sequence; it establishes his relationship with Stryker and the US government; it shows his inner conflict between universal morality and being an animalistic killing machine; it establishes his capacity for true love and heroism (Kayla and the old couple, as well as going back to save the mutants at the end); it shows how his bones became reinforced with adamantium; it effectively shows how he lost his memory; and why he's known as Logan/Wolverine.This isn't some mindless action/CGI flick with little dramatic valleys or depth, as some have criticized. As just noted, the film starts out with a dramatic sequence from Logan's youth and proceeds with the dramatic montage of various wars during the opening credits. This effectively sets the tone that ""Wolverine"" is a serious superhero film, like the three X-Men films before it. From there we get touching moments with Kayla, both early in the story and later; as well as dramatic lulls with Victor, Stryker, the old couple, the black guy in New Orleans (I forget his name), Gambit, Cyclops and Professor X.As far as depth goes, we get Wolvie's intense struggle between flesh and spirit, which we can all relate to one way or another - will he selfishly and greedily use his powers to be a moral-less killing machine at Stryker's beck & call or will he use his powers for the good of humanity? Will he take the high pay from the government or will he be content making $18,500 as a lumberjack? We also get his discovery of love with a moving relationship with Kayla, his later struggle with betrayal, and then understanding and forgiveness for Kayla's plight (her concern for her sister). Not to mention a certain character's powerful admission of genuine love at the end. Furthermore we get Victor's headfirst plunge into lawlessness with zero respect for life other than his own but then - surprisingly - evidence that he still possesses a sense of loyalty to his blood kin. This shows that even one of the main villains isn't one-dimensional. In addition, near the end we see Cyclops as a boy trusting the still small voice he hears somewhere within, which leads to salvation and Xavier, an obvious type of the Holy Spirit or what have you.One aspect I really liked was the build-up of mystery regarding Stryker's ""island"" lab for mutant experimentation. When Wolvie & Gambit fly over it and it's location is finally revealed it's a thrilling revelation. From there the final act just builds to an explosive climax with the creative destruction of something, the deliverance of the mutants and the revelation of how Logan completely lost his memory.As far as all the criticism about Wolvie's claws, particularly in the bathroom scene, so they look a little cartoony, so what? They're obviously a reflection of the comic medium of which the film is adopting.Let me end by addressing some other common criticisms:The helicopter explosion: This was thrown-in for the explosion and simply to show Wolvie's ultra-coolness. Logan would have no concern about the explosion due to his mutant healing factor; after over 150 years - so many wars and so many mortal wounds - such an experience was now mundane.The dialogue in the non-action scenes: I thought a lot of this dialogue was witty and busted out laughing 7-10 times during the film. As far as the verbiage being weak, it's a Wolverine flick where most of the characters are warriors or kids, not James Fenimore Cooper.Kayla's moon parable: This was worth it just for the hilarious ""Koo-koo-ka-choo"" line and I found it a very creative touch. Not only does the legend link to Logan & Kayla's relationship, including Logan accusing her of being the ""trickster"" later in the film, it provides Logan his namesake, Wolverine! In short, it wasn't some worthless tale thrown in just to show Kayla was Native American.Criticisms about Deadpool: The movie is showing Deadpool's FIRST appearance only; after all, it's ""X-Men ORIGINS."" As far as his twirling head and the laser eyes destroying the tower - how awesome and creative! Film is a visual medium and they knocked it out of the park with this one. As for Deadpool being silenced, stick around for the post-credits scene.The bullet to the brain: This was the perfect way to explain Logan's complete memory loss. Think about it: Being shot in the brain is the closest to death Logan would ever come, but his healing factor kicked in and renewed the damaged brain tissue. His restored brain would be as good as new, but with Logan's memory wiped clean.The inclusion of mutant kids as hostages supposedly just for the fun of putting names there: The movie's called ""Wolverine"" so it focuses mainly on him, but it's also called ""X-Men Origins"" and so naturally details the very beginning of the X-men. I enjoyed seeing Cyclops as a kid in the film, but I'm glad they didn't take the focus off Wolvie by getting bogged down with Cyclops' story or anyone else's.GRADE A-",5,A Top Superhero

Yes, sure it was watchable (mainly due to some decent special effects), but just barely. The story was so choppy and unfocused, it was very hard to stay interested or care. The mutants were boring and uninspired (was it really the best the comics universe could offer?)  Probably the best part was the first 5 minutes where Wolverine's and Sabertooth's militant past was captured. After that, the movie felt like a patchwork of random events assembled to tie this movie to the rest of X-Men franchise.
