We only let her watch TV on the weekends so I want it to be good stuff. About 2 minutes into the video she started cracking up hysterically and hasn't stopped yet. She loves it and after only 10 minutes knows the name ""Pingu."" Family visited recently and I had Pingu on, and they all sat down to watch it and really enjoyed it too. So it seems all generations can enjoy this.",5,This is like SNL for kids... and is also great fun for adults!,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,482,"['rented', 'library', 'bunch', 'other', 'preschool', 'videos', 'see', 'what', 'daughter', 'likes', 'only', 'let', 'watch', 'TV', 'weekends', 'so', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'stuff', '2', 'minutes', 'video', 'started', 'cracking', 'up', 'hysterically', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'yet', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'name', 'Pingu', 'Family', 'visited', 'recently', 'had', 'Pingu', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'generations', 'can', 'enjoy']",Meet Pingu
787064,A1ZI39BA3KWE1S,B0000VD11O,"Matt Tuozzo ""The Chisa""","[5, 6]","It's highly unlikely that the Pygos Group intended this stop-frame claymation series to be an exercise in surrealism, but the world of Pingu is a fine introductory example of abstract logic.  Taking place in the Antarctic, the adventures of Pingu center around a young penguin who lives in a small village with his family.  Often accompanied by his best friend -- a somewhat sadistic seal named Robbie -- Pingu finds himself in a series of germane situations that are cosmopolitan enough to apply to any of us, which makes us feel all the better whenever he eventually triumphs.  One particularly notable detail of the series is that there is no literary component whatsoever; all of the characters speak in a sort of complex gibberish known as Penguinese, which relies on expressiveness and context more than phonetics.  This 30 minute ""best of"" is a delightfully entertaining addition to any video collection, and it's sheer absurdity will drive even the most stoic and sardonic of grown-ups into fits of uncontrollable laughter.",5,Meck meck!,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,1031,"['highly', 'unlikely', 'Pygos', 'Group', 'intended', 'stop-frame', 'claymation', 'series', 'be', 'exercise', 'surrealism', 'world', 'Pingu', 'fine', 'introductory', 'example', 'abstract', 'logic', 'Taking', 'place', 'Antarctic', 'adventures', 'Pingu', 'center', 'young', 'penguin', 'who', 'small', 'village', 'family', 'Often', 'accompanied', 'best', 'friend', 'somewhat', 'sadistic', 'seal', 'named', 'Robbie', 'Pingu', 'series', 'germane', 'situations', 'are', 'cosmopolitan', 'enough', 'apply', 'feel', 'better', 'whenever', 'eventually', 'triumphs', 'One', 'particularly', 'notable', 'detail', 'series', 'literary', 'component', 'whatsoever', 'characters', 'speak', 'sort', 'complex', 'gibberish', 'known', 'Penguinese', 'expressiveness', 'context', 'more', 'phonetics', '30', 'minute', 'best', 'delightfully', 'entertaining', 'addition', 'video', 'collection', 'sheer', 'absurdity', 'will', 'drive', 'even', 'most', 'stoic', 'sardonic', 'grown-ups', 'fits', 'uncontrollable', 'laughter']",Meet Pingu

787068,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0000VD11O,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[34, 36]","Being a penguin fanatic, my sister bought this DVD for me for Christmas. I wasn't for sure what to think of it originally, but came to really enjoy the DVD after watching it.Pingu is a young penguin and he and everything in his world are created through claymation (the type of animation responsible for WALLACE AND GROMIT, GUMBY, CHICKEN RUN). The stories on the DVD involve Pingu and his friends and family as they go about the daily tasks of their lives.  Unlike most claymation shows, there is no literal dialogue:  the creatures all speak a type of mumbling that is called Pengeese.  There are six episodes on the DVD.""Pingu Goes Fishing""--in this episode Pingu has his first encounter with a young seal named Robbie who becomes his best friend.""Pingu Helps to Deliver the Mail""--in this episode Pingu helps his father deliver the mail in their small village.""Pingu Plays Fish Tennis""--in this episode Pingu and Robbie are bored and end up playing a game of fish tennis.""Pingu Gets a Bike""--in this episode Pingu's father runs over Pinga's (Pingu's little sister) bike. She cries and cries and cries until Pingu gives her his bike. Good lesson in sharing.""Pingu at the Nursery""--Pingu takes Pinga to school at the nursery.""Pingu and the Organ Grinder""--the poor Organ Grinder who lives on the outskirts of town is having a difficult time making a living.  No one pays attention to him or his music.  Pingu loves his music and decides to help the Organ Grinder.Overall, I found this DVD to be highly entertaing.  The whole DVD is a little over 30 minutes and can be easily watched in one setting.  My favorite episode was ""Pingu and the Organ Grinder""; I found it to be touching and reminded me of how much I love my grandparents. This is a great DVD to watch with younger children and makes an excellent gift for any penguin or claymation fans.",5,Clay and Ice.,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,1849,"['Being', 'penguin', 'fanatic', 'sister', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'originally', 'came', 'really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'watching', 'it.Pingu', 'young', 'penguin', 'everything', 'world', 'are', 'created', 'claymation', 'type', 'animation', 'responsible', 'WALLACE', 'AND', 'GROMIT', 'GUMBY', 'CHICKEN', 'RUN', 'stories', 'DVD', 'involve', 'Pingu', 'friends', 'family', 'go', 'daily', 'tasks', 'lives', 'most', 'claymation', 'shows', 'literal', 'dialogue', 'creatures', 'speak', 'type', 'mumbling', 'called', 'Pengeese', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'Pingu', 'Goes', 'Fishing', 'episode', 'Pingu', 'first', 'encounter', 'young', 'seal', 'named', 'Robbie', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'Pingu', 'Helps', 'Deliver', 'Mail', 'episode', 'Pingu', 'father', 'deliver', 'mail', 'small', 'village', 'Pingu', 'Plays', 'Fish', 'Tennis', 'episode', 'Pingu', 'Robbie', 'are', 'bored', 'end', 'up', 'playing', 'game', 'fish', 'tennis', 'Pingu', 'Bike', 'episode', 'Pingu', 'father', 'Pinga', 'Pingu', 'little', 'sister', 'bike', 'cries', 'cries', 'Pingu', 'bike', 'Good', 'lesson', 'sharing', 'Pingu', 'Nursery', 'Pingu', 'Pinga', 'school', 'nursery', 'Pingu', 'Organ', 'Grinder', 'poor', 'Organ', 'Grinder', 'who', 'outskirts', 'town', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'making', 'living', 'one', 'attention', 'music', 'Pingu', 'music', 'help', 'Organ', 'Grinder.Overall', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaing', 'whole', 'DVD', 'little', '30', 'minutes', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'watched', 'one', 'setting', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', 'Pingu', 'Organ', 'Grinder', 'found', 'be', 'touching', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'grandparents', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'younger', 'children', 'excellent', 'gift', 'penguin', 'claymation', 'fans']",Meet Pingu
