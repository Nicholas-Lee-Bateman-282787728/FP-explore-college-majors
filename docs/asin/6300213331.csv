But it's justified by how hostile and sadistic these particular aliens are. This is the one with the flying jellyfish who stick to your back and then cause you incredible pain if you don't do what they want. Though individually not intelligent, they collectively operate as neurons of a single ""brain."" They make the Borg and the Klingons look sweet-natured by comparison.What lifts this episode above a 3-star rating is the dramatic tension and large number of moral dilemmas, impressive even by Star Trek standards. 1) Should Spock be allowed to resume his post, even though the ""things"" are trying to control him? 2) Should Spock be used as a guinea pig, even though the test may cause permanent blindness? 3) Above all, is it better to kill a few million people (an act of commission) or let billions of others die (an act of omission)?Y'see, the only way to kill the evil jellyfish is to kill everyone on the planet below. If this isn't done, then the flying jellyfish will someday spread to other, more populous planets, where they will torture and enslave billions of people. Spock says killing the population is the only logical thing to do. (The needs of the many vs. the needs of the comparatively few.) Bones says, No, no, Jim, it's not the human thing to do. Kirk shows both his strong will and his humanity by saying, ""Gentlemen, both alternatives are unacceptable. Find me another solution."" In this way, Kirk is much like Pres. Kennedy in the Cuban Missile Crisis, unwilling to accept either defeat or nuclear war. JFK also demanded a third option. Kirk has much in common with JFK.And yet this episode -- a scary ""kill the evil aliens before they get us"" story -- is not everyone's cup of tea, which is why I can't quite give it 5 stars.",4,It's a Pain in the Back,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1915,"['episodes', 'original', 'series', 'one', 'Enterprise', 'most', 'aggressively', 'alien', 'species', 'arguably', 'intelligent', 'justified', 'how', 'hostile', 'sadistic', 'particular', 'aliens', 'are', 'one', 'flying', 'jellyfish', 'who', 'stick', 'back', 'then', 'cause', 'incredible', 'pain', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'want', 'Though', 'individually', 'not', 'intelligent', 'collectively', 'operate', 'neurons', 'single', 'brain', 'make', 'Borg', 'Klingons', 'look', 'sweet-natured', 'comparison.What', 'episode', '3-star', 'rating', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'large', 'number', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'impressive', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'standards', '1', 'Should', 'Spock', 'be', 'allowed', 'resume', 'post', 'even', 'things', 'are', 'trying', 'control', '2', 'Should', 'Spock', 'be', 'used', 'guinea', 'pig', 'even', 'test', 'may', 'cause', 'permanent', 'blindness', '3', 'better', 'kill', 'few', 'million', 'people', 'act', 'commission', 'let', 'billions', 'others', 'die', 'act', 'omission', ""Y'see"", 'only', 'way', 'kill', 'evil', 'jellyfish', 'kill', 'everyone', 'planet', ""n't"", 'done', 'then', 'flying', 'jellyfish', 'will', 'someday', 'spread', 'other', 'more', 'populous', 'planets', 'where', 'will', 'torture', 'enslave', 'billions', 'people', 'Spock', 'killing', 'population', 'only', 'logical', 'thing', 'do', 'needs', 'many', 'vs.', 'needs', 'comparatively', 'few', 'Bones', 'No', 'no', 'Jim', 'not', 'human', 'thing', 'do', 'Kirk', 'strong', 'will', 'humanity', 'saying', 'Gentlemen', 'alternatives', 'are', 'unacceptable', 'Find', 'solution', 'way', 'Kirk', 'much', 'like', 'Pres', 'Kennedy', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'either', 'defeat', 'nuclear', 'war', 'JFK', 'also', 'demanded', 'third', 'option', 'Kirk', 'much', 'common', 'JFK.And', 'yet', 'episode', 'scary', 'kill', 'evil', 'aliens', 'get', 'story', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'give', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It was good for a few laughs and did not get us in too much trouble. The parasitical beings in this episode appear to have been created in the same way.The Enterprise has been charting a sequence of outbreaks of mass insanity and they are traveling to the planet Deneva, where Kirk's brother Sam and his family live. As they arrive, a Denevan pilots his ship into a star and at the last moment before death, the Denevan announces that he is free of the creature.When the Enterprise landing party reaches the surface, they find that the inhabitants are all indoors, some with barricades. Kirk finds his brother Sam dead and his family terrified. When they investigate further, Spock is attacked and injected by one of the parasitical beings. It inflicts pain on the host in order to control them and after a battle; Spock is able to control the pain. He volunteers to beam down and retrieve one of the creatures for study. Although the creature is very resistant to phaser fire, Spock is able to capture one and return to the Enterprise.At first all tests prove ineffective against the creature, until suddenly it perishes when exposed to intense light. Spock volunteers as a test subject and after being bombarded with the light, pronounces that he is free of the parasite. Unfortunately, he is also blind. Later, McCoy discovers that Spock need not have been blinded, the wavelengths of light that the creature is subject to does not damage the visual organs.The Enterprise constructs a series of orbiting platforms that bombard the planet with radiation that kills the creatures. Later, it is revealed that Vulcans have an inner eyelid that snaps shut when exposed to intense light. Eventually that eyelid reopens and Spock is no longer blind.With the exception of the glimpse into Kirk's family, there is little to praise about this episode. However, the one other significant point is that once Kirk was aware of the nature of the plague, he would have had to contain it on the planet. That would have meant preventing any person from leaving the planet, which most certainly meant destroying any ship that attempted to leave. That is one point of serious analysis, namely how space traveling societies would deal with plague planets.",3,What do you do with a plague planet?,1212710400,"06 6, 2008",2008,2353,"['When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'one', 'pranks', 'friends', 'played', 'others', 'was', 'plastic', 'hunk', 'fake', 'vomit', 'was', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'parasitical', 'beings', 'episode', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'same', 'way.The', 'Enterprise', 'been', 'charting', 'sequence', 'outbreaks', 'mass', 'insanity', 'are', 'traveling', 'planet', 'Deneva', 'where', 'Kirk', 'brother', 'Sam', 'family', 'live', 'arrive', 'Denevan', 'pilots', 'ship', 'star', 'last', 'moment', 'death', 'Denevan', 'announces', 'free', 'creature.When', 'Enterprise', 'landing', 'party', 'surface', 'find', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'indoors', 'barricades', 'Kirk', 'brother', 'Sam', 'dead', 'family', 'terrified', 'When', 'investigate', 'further', 'Spock', 'attacked', 'injected', 'one', 'parasitical', 'beings', 'pain', 'host', 'order', 'control', 'battle', 'Spock', 'able', 'control', 'pain', 'beam', 'down', 'retrieve', 'one', 'creatures', 'study', 'creature', 'very', 'resistant', 'phaser', 'fire', 'Spock', 'able', 'capture', 'one', 'return', 'Enterprise.At', 'first', 'tests', 'prove', 'ineffective', 'creature', 'suddenly', 'when', 'exposed', 'intense', 'light', 'Spock', 'volunteers', 'test', 'subject', 'being', 'bombarded', 'light', 'pronounces', 'free', 'parasite', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'blind', 'Later', 'McCoy', 'Spock', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'blinded', 'wavelengths', 'light', 'creature', 'subject', 'not', 'damage', 'visual', 'organs.The', 'Enterprise', 'series', 'orbiting', 'platforms', 'bombard', 'planet', 'radiation', 'creatures', 'Later', 'revealed', 'Vulcans', 'have', 'inner', 'eyelid', 'snaps', 'shut', 'when', 'exposed', 'intense', 'light', 'Eventually', 'eyelid', 'reopens', 'Spock', 'no', 'longer', 'blind.With', 'exception', 'glimpse', 'Kirk', 'family', 'little', 'praise', 'episode', 'However', 'one', 'other', 'significant', 'point', 'once', 'Kirk', 'was', 'aware', 'nature', 'plague', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'contain', 'planet', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'preventing', 'person', 'leaving', 'planet', 'most', 'certainly', 'meant', 'destroying', 'ship', 'attempted', 'leave', 'one', 'point', 'serious', 'analysis', 'namely', 'how', 'space', 'traveling', 'societies', 'would', 'deal', 'plague', 'planets']",N/A
