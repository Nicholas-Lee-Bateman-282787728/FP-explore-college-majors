1679804,A37PT3XX6SEXFM,B00GNOFCZA,Exercisequeen,"[0, 0]",I have used Jillian Michaels KettleBell workout and others and this one was different.  I thought it would be easy since I had mastered all levels of Jillian Michaels but I was definitely feeling it the next day.  I like Amy's cuing and her moving quickly through the exercises without a lot of chatter.  I would definitely recommend this.  Kettle Bells are the new 'best exercise secret' these days and you feel the cardio burn without a lot strain with lifting.,4,Great Workout,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,463,"['have', 'used', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'KettleBell', 'workout', 'others', 'one', 'was', 'different', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'had', 'mastered', 'levels', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'was', 'definitely', 'feeling', 'next', 'day', 'like', 'Amy', 'cuing', 'moving', 'quickly', 'exercises', 'lot', 'chatter', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Kettle', 'Bells', 'are', 'new', ""'best"", 'exercise', 'secret', 'days', 'feel', 'cardio', 'burn', 'lot', 'strain', 'lifting']",Raise Some Bell: The Ultimate Kettlebell Workout
1679805,AUFV4KVKDEYO4,B00GNOFCZA,Isabel,"[3, 5]","I had expected something more fast paced, challenging. The repetition count is low, and you don't get the exhaustion feeling as with other KB workout (Jillian Michaels is my fave). I tried to get heavier with the KB, but not all the exercises admit a heavier KB, so you end up feeling just a little tired, not covered in sweat as Amy (which, on the other hand, I found pretty awkward). It the DVD were $10, I this wouldn't be a major issue, just leave it for the recovery days. But it's $20 and I believe it doesn't live up to expectations.Sorry Amy, I really like your work... but this one is not your best.",3,Not as I expected,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,608,"['had', 'expected', 'something', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'challenging', 'repetition', 'count', 'low', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'exhaustion', 'feeling', 'other', 'KB', 'workout', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'fave', 'tried', 'get', 'heavier', 'KB', 'not', 'exercises', 'admit', 'heavier', 'KB', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'just', 'little', 'tired', 'not', 'covered', 'sweat', 'Amy', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'pretty', 'awkward', 'DVD', 'were', '10', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'major', 'issue', 'just', 'leave', 'recovery', 'days', '20', 'believe', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations.Sorry', 'Amy', 'really', 'work', 'one', 'not', 'best']",Raise Some Bell: The Ultimate Kettlebell Workout

1679807,A12OW9KMHGK1EE,B00GNOFCZA,"Kara L. Sanford ""Kaleigh""","[0, 0]","I have a lot of workout DVDs and own and love all of the Breathless Body DVDs from Amy Dixon. I am less inclined to do strength training, especially for upper body, so I really needed something that I like enough to stick with that challenges me and works upper body well. Since I love Amy's other workouts, I decided to give this one a try. I've done kettlebell in workouts in the gym before but never a full kettlebell workout. Since I'm intermediate to advanced, I got a 12-lb bell. Here are my thoughts on this:1. Whoa. It's a challenge if you're like me and don't typically do much upper body strength. For once in a workout of hers, I was sticking with the modifier for a good bit of it, not comfortable jumping into lunges while trying to swing a 12-lb weight overhead with one arm!2. Like her other workouts, this flows very well and goes by fast. I attribute that to the fact that she has you do a drill for several minutes and then moves on to something completely different. No going back to a standard KB swing for endless minutes to transition.3. BURPEES! They suck, and I hate them. I didn't expect there to be burpees, and I'm tempted to remove a star for that! LOL. That drill was tough, but I did it. Actually, had to take a sec.4. Some of her moves are a little complicated, but I think they'll be easy to do once I'm used to them. Again, I think her workouts go by quickly because they're not the same old, same old that we've all been doing in every other dvd.5. I LOVE that she doesn't have smiley, happy Barbie dolls working out with her. Of all my dvds, only Amy Dixon and Bob Harper seem to get that it's not normal to have a fake smile plastered on one's face while being worked to the max. I love Turbo Fire, but I can't stand the fake smiles. Amy is real, and so are the people working out with her. She enjoys it, but there's no fake here.6. I was glad this was only 40 minutes. I do 55-65 min cardio workouts, but I really didn't want to do this any longer, especially since it's so much shoulder work. I think it was just long enough.7. It's as much cardio as you want it to be. I wanted to focus on getting the strength moves down and feel that I do enough cardio in my other workouts, so I opted out of most of the jumps. But if you want some cardio moves, she gives you that option.Great job, Amy!",5,Another great workout!,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,2330,"['have', 'lot', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'own', 'love', 'Breathless', 'Body', 'DVDs', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'am', 'less', 'inclined', 'do', 'strength', 'training', 'especially', 'upper', 'body', 'really', 'needed', 'something', 'like', 'enough', 'stick', 'upper', 'body', 'well', 'love', 'Amy', 'other', 'workouts', 'decided', 'give', 'one', 'try', ""'ve"", 'done', 'kettlebell', 'workouts', 'gym', 'never', 'full', 'kettlebell', 'workout', ""'m"", 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'got', '12-lb', 'bell', 'Here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'this:1', 'Whoa', 'challenge', ""'re"", 'do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'do', 'much', 'body', 'strength', 'once', 'workout', 'hers', 'was', 'sticking', 'modifier', 'good', 'bit', 'not', 'comfortable', 'jumping', 'lunges', 'trying', 'swing', '12-lb', 'weight', 'overhead', 'one', 'arm', '2', 'other', 'workouts', 'very', 'well', 'fast', 'attribute', 'fact', 'do', 'drill', 'several', 'minutes', 'then', 'moves', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'going', 'back', 'standard', 'KB', 'swing', 'endless', 'minutes', 'transition.3', 'BURPEES', 'suck', 'hate', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'burpees', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'remove', 'star', 'LOL', 'drill', 'was', 'tough', 'did', 'Actually', 'had', 'take', 'sec.4', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'complicated', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'easy', 'do', 'once', ""'m"", 'used', 'Again', 'think', 'workouts', 'go', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'not', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'other', 'dvd.5', 'LOVE', ""n't"", 'have', 'smiley', 'happy', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'working', 'out', 'dvds', 'only', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'seem', 'get', 'not', 'normal', 'have', 'fake', 'smile', 'plastered', 'one', 'face', 'being', 'worked', 'max', 'love', 'Turbo', 'Fire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'fake', 'smiles', 'Amy', 'real', 'so', 'are', 'people', 'working', 'out', 'fake', 'here.6', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'only', '40', 'minutes', 'do', '55-65', 'min', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'longer', 'especially', 'so', 'much', 'shoulder', 'work', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'long', 'enough.7', 'as', 'much', 'cardio', 'want', 'be', 'wanted', 'focus', 'getting', 'strength', 'down', 'feel', 'do', 'enough', 'cardio', 'other', 'workouts', 'opted', 'most', 'jumps', 'want', 'cardio', 'moves', 'option.Great', 'job', 'Amy']",Raise Some Bell: The Ultimate Kettlebell Workout
1679808,A1LY1LSXQ7GHA1,B00GNOFCZA,Workout gal,"[6, 10]","I received this KB workout a few days ago.When I did it I used a 8LB KB and I didn't sweat all that much and I wasn't out of breath all that much.I consider myself a advanced exerciser.I workout 5 to 6 days a week for about an hour a day,so I thought I needed a heavier KB and I thought I don't won't to have to go buy another one,so I have 10LB and 12LB dumbbells and I thought huuummmmm I'm gonna try one of the 10LB dumbbells that I have and see how that works out AND you can do this workout with a dumbbell.If someone don't have a KB but you do have dumbbells try it and see how it works for you,it worked fine for me.I think I actually liked using a dumbbell instead of the KB.With the dumbbell I sweated more and my heart rate was up more but of course it was a heavier dumbbell.It lasts right around 40 minutes including warm up and cool down and the time for me flew by.I do like it but will probably use on  lighter days.Cause I'm use to Cathe and HIIT workouts and  more intense workouts. It does have a KB core workout that is separate from the workout it self,the core workout I believe is around 7 minutes.It was ok but I don't plan on using the core work though,I have another core workout that I do that I like alot better,that's just MY opinion.Other people might like the core work better than I did.She does have a modifier on this workout.I do like Amy and I have some of her other workouts she is a good instructor.",4,"You can use a dumbbell if you don't have a kettlebell,it worked for me...",1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,1436,"['received', 'KB', 'few', 'days', 'ago.When', 'did', 'used', '8LB', 'KB', 'did', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'breath', 'much.I', 'consider', 'advanced', 'exerciser.I', 'workout', '5', '6', 'days', 'week', 'hour', 'day', 'thought', 'needed', 'heavier', 'KB', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'buy', 'one', 'so', 'have', '10LB', '12LB', 'dumbbells', 'thought', 'huuummmmm', ""'m"", 'gon', 'try', 'one', '10LB', 'dumbbells', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'can', 'do', 'workout', 'dumbbell.If', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'KB', 'do', 'have', 'dumbbells', 'try', 'see', 'how', 'worked', 'fine', 'me.I', 'think', 'actually', 'liked', 'using', 'dumbbell', 'instead', 'KB.With', 'dumbbell', 'sweated', 'more', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'up', 'more', 'course', 'was', 'heavier', 'dumbbell.It', 'lasts', 'right', '40', 'minutes', 'including', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'time', 'flew', 'by.I', 'do', 'will', 'probably', 'use', 'lighter', 'days.Cause', ""'m"", 'use', 'Cathe', 'HIIT', 'workouts', 'more', 'intense', 'workouts', 'have', 'KB', 'core', 'workout', 'separate', 'workout', 'core', 'workout', 'believe', 'around', '7', 'minutes.It', 'was', 'ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'using', 'core', 'work', 'have', 'core', 'workout', 'do', 'like', 'alot', 'better', 'just', 'MY', 'opinion.Other', 'people', 'might', 'like', 'core', 'work', 'better', 'did.She', 'have', 'modifier', 'workout.I', 'do', 'Amy', 'have', 'other', 'workouts', 'good', 'instructor']",Raise Some Bell: The Ultimate Kettlebell Workout
