The fight scenes are pretty amazing and well choreographed (with the excpetion of Huo Yuan Jia's father's fight which is very disorienting and strange).  Needless to say, if you like fight scenes, you should bronze this baby!  This movie does fall short on the storyline - there are parts that are slow, and fiction enters an otherwise incredible, true story (the fight between Huo and Hercules never occurred and Huo Yuan Jia was actually a farmer with a lot of brothers and sisters - not a rich spoiled kid).  I really don't understand why Jet Li would want to alter a great story in Chinese history - it really only cheapens the accomplishment ---- that being said, I am searching for the lost footage which never made the cut.  I have a friend who say footage of Huo fighting in Thailand (a Thai boxer).  My friend said it was amazing! Why did they cut it?!!!  If you have any knowledge of where I can get a copy I will pay for info leading to its capture.

This is a film that didn't give into the hokey symbolism and fantasy that seems to be prevalent in a lot of the Chinese period movies about the late 1800's.  Instead we have an honest story that teaches lessons about friendship and good sportsmanship.  What makes this movie even better is that we are told that the film is based on a true story.Jet-Li is a Wu-shu champion who was deeply upset when his father lost a Wu-shu championship match.  Li is determined to become the best Wu-shu artist there is and win the championship for his father.  What he learns is that winning is not as important as how you compete and that respecting your opponent is by far the most important lesson to be learned.Though we can see instances of ""wires"" supporting the fighters, the fight scenes are way more realistic looking then most films of this genre.  We also learn that many of the supposedly ""evil"" opponents are really not so ""evil"" once they are shown a little bit of mercy.Not to be a spoiler but the ending is very unconventional and even with tragedy there is greatness.

984043,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000F6VVVG,Michael Zuffa,"[5, 5]","""Fearless"" is the story of martial art master Huo Yuanjia (Li), from early childhood to his death.  His father was a great fighter who did not want his son to follow in his footsteps, so Yuanjia was forced to teach himself.  When his father refuses to deliver a fatal blow to end a match, Yuanjia is taunted to the point where he must defend his family's name.  He is defeated, but swears never to lose again.  Over the years, he becomes known as one of the greatest fighters in China.  Unlike his father, he becomes ruthless, and will have to pay the price for his actions.""Fearless"" is an entertaining and interesting movie.  In what is supposed to be his final martial arts movie, Jet Li gives a good performance as this Chinese hero.  The fight scenes are top notch, and there are plenty of them.

984044,APIW11UEPKIC2,B000F6VVVG,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[2, 2]","I know I certainly have my fingers crossed.  Still, this is a great movie.Finally, I can see why this is being promoted as Jet Li's last martial arts epic. He has stood on the top of the top after the Once Upon a Time In China series, and I found this movie even more enjoyable. In 1994 Jet Li and Yuen Woo Ping collaberated on a remake of Bruce Lee's 'Fist of Fury' called 'Fist of Legend' which told the story of Chen Zen, a fictional character who takes revenge after his Master Hua Yuanjia dies. So it is very fitting for Jet to play the Master as the non fictional character himself. You will be taken back at the start to hear Jet's voice so much. I don't ever rememebr him talking that much and it did seem a bit odd. In his earlier movies like OUATIC his voice was always dubbed. It was nice to hear though and Jet is great in those emotional moments. Good thing because you will certainly have some emotions running through your body by the end of this.I loved the start as it reminded me a bit of my favorite move ever- 'Legend of a Fighter', also a story of Hua Yuanjia and it was directed by Woo Ping. I was wondering if this was just going to be a remake when they showed the war footage to note the year is 1940 or so and also Hua spying on his father, secretly learning kung fu. Then we realize that Ronny Yu is directing this and it is a big budget 2006 movie and all is good.Hua Yuanjia is perfectly played by Jet Li and shows the full range of emotions that an actor needs. Studying martial arts from a very young age to prove his father wrong and show that he can become a great fighter even if he has asthma. We learn later that practicing and fighting has cured his asthma. With Hua being very arragont he forgets that he cannot be the champion of the county. There is still a man named Master Chin who is considered the best. After Master Chin beats one of Hua's disciples to a pulp, Hua comes for murderous revenge. This was a duel to the death that was absolutely mindblowing. Not only is the action sublime, it is as brutal as can be. After this we get a cut that was all too quick to the young man telling his master that he had said negative things abotu Master Chin's wife and that he was wrong for doing this. Hua goes and completely loses himself in sorrow but luckily we get a woman named Moon from a nearby village that takes care of him. After seeing life in a whole new way Hua comes back and with help from his childhood friend Jinsun, he moves to Shanghai and opens the Jingwu Sports Federation. With an ego being higher than ever before and the Japanese and British trying to destroy the Chinese people, he may have his hands full. There are at least 10 fights that I can remember in this movie but 3 stood out as some of the best action sequences ever. The fight with master Chin was epic and the second one was a fight with Nathan Jones, the same 7 foot 350 lb muscleman who fought Tony Jaa in 'The Protector' and had a spear jammed in his throat by Brad Pitt in 'Troy'. Well Fearless takes the cake with his best screen fight yet. You will never ever see a fight that seems like it is going to be so cheesy and turns out as breathtaking as this. I didn't even know that Woo Ping had it in him to make such an awesome fight out of a 7 foot Jones and a 5 foot 6 inch Li. You will honestly believe that a man of Li's size can truly take down anybody.The last fight is the best of the movie bar none, maybe the greatest fight ever put into a movie. I cannot allow myself to give anything away about it but you will not be dissapointed with the end of this movie no matter what genre you usually watch.I give the movie a 4.5/5 but not the full 5 because there seemed to be so much missing. I couldn't figure out how they could leave parts in like the crazy bum always asking Jet Li if he is the champion but not leaving in parts explaining Jet startign up his school, more on the betrayal of his student, if the crazy bum ever has a significant scene in the movie at all. I really hope that I can give it the full 5 stars it deserves when it comes to DVD and we have an extended edition but more than that, I hope that we get an extended edition.Like I said at the top, I can see why this is being billed as Jet's last martial arts movie. Reason being is that I thought it was his best ever performance. Just don't be fooled and believe Jet won't make anymore fighting flicks. He has already been talking for quite a while about 'The One' part 2, a Shaolin fighter movie with Tsui Hark, and a movie with Jackie Chan. So don't worry, they say it's his last because they want to see it so badly, AND THEY HAVE GOOD REASON!!!",4,A movie that we have to hope that an extended edition comes out for,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,4657,"['know', 'certainly', 'have', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'Still', 'great', 'movie.Finally', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'being', 'promoted', 'Jet', 'Li', 'last', 'martial', 'arts', 'epic', 'stood', 'top', 'top', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'series', 'found', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', '1994', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Yuen', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'collaberated', 'remake', 'Bruce', 'Lee', ""'Fist"", 'Fury', 'called', ""'Fist"", 'Legend', 'told', 'story', 'Chen', 'Zen', 'fictional', 'character', 'who', 'revenge', 'Master', 'Hua', 'Yuanjia', 'very', 'fitting', 'Jet', 'play', 'Master', 'non', 'fictional', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'start', 'hear', 'Jet', 'voice', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'rememebr', 'talking', 'much', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'odd', 'earlier', 'movies', 'OUATIC', 'voice', 'was', 'always', 'dubbed', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'Jet', 'great', 'emotional', 'moments', 'Good', 'thing', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'emotions', 'running', 'body', 'end', 'this.I', 'loved', 'start', 'reminded', 'bit', 'favorite', 'move', 'ever-', ""'Legend"", 'Fighter', 'also', 'story', 'Hua', 'Yuanjia', 'was', 'directed', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'remake', 'when', 'showed', 'war', 'footage', 'note', 'year', '1940', 'so', 'also', 'Hua', 'spying', 'father', 'secretly', 'learning', 'kung', 'fu', 'Then', 'realize', 'Ronny', 'Yu', 'directing', 'big', 'budget', '2006', 'movie', 'good.Hua', 'Yuanjia', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Jet', 'Li', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'actor', 'needs', 'Studying', 'martial', 'arts', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'prove', 'father', 'wrong', 'show', 'can', 'become', 'great', 'fighter', 'even', 'asthma', 'learn', 'later', 'practicing', 'fighting', 'cured', 'asthma', 'Hua', 'being', 'very', 'arragont', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'champion', 'county', 'still', 'man', 'named', 'Master', 'Chin', 'who', 'considered', 'best', 'Master', 'Chin', 'one', 'Hua', 'disciples', 'pulp', 'Hua', 'murderous', 'revenge', 'was', 'duel', 'death', 'was', 'absolutely', 'mindblowing', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'sublime', 'as', 'brutal', 'can', 'be', 'get', 'cut', 'was', 'too', 'quick', 'young', 'man', 'telling', 'master', 'had', 'said', 'negative', 'things', 'abotu', 'Master', 'Chin', 'wife', 'was', 'wrong', 'doing', 'Hua', 'completely', 'sorrow', 'luckily', 'get', 'woman', 'named', 'Moon', 'nearby', 'village', 'care', 'seeing', 'life', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'Hua', 'back', 'help', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jinsun', 'Shanghai', 'Jingwu', 'Sports', 'Federation', 'ego', 'being', 'higher', 'ever', 'Japanese', 'British', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Chinese', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'hands', 'full', 'are', 'least', '10', 'fights', 'can', 'remember', 'movie', '3', 'stood', 'out', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'ever', 'fight', 'master', 'Chin', 'was', 'epic', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'fight', 'Nathan', 'Jones', 'same', '7', 'foot', '350', 'lb', 'muscleman', 'who', 'fought', 'Tony', 'Jaa', ""'The"", 'Protector', 'had', 'spear', 'jammed', 'throat', 'Brad', 'Pitt', ""'Troy"", 'Well', 'Fearless', 'cake', 'best', 'screen', 'fight', 'yet', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'see', 'fight', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'cheesy', 'out', 'as', 'breathtaking', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'had', 'make', 'such', 'awesome', 'fight', '7', 'foot', 'Jones', '5', 'foot', '6', 'inch', 'Li', 'will', 'honestly', 'believe', 'man', 'Li', 'size', 'can', 'truly', 'take', 'down', 'last', 'fight', 'best', 'movie', 'bar', 'none', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'fight', 'ever', 'put', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'end', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'usually', 'watch.I', 'give', 'movie', '4.5/5', 'not', 'full', '5', 'seemed', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'missing', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'leave', 'parts', 'crazy', 'bum', 'always', 'asking', 'Jet', 'Li', 'champion', 'not', 'leaving', 'parts', 'explaining', 'Jet', 'startign', 'up', 'school', 'more', 'betrayal', 'student', 'crazy', 'bum', 'ever', 'significant', 'scene', 'movie', 'really', 'hope', 'can', 'give', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'when', 'DVD', 'have', 'extended', 'edition', 'more', 'hope', 'get', 'extended', 'edition.Like', 'said', 'top', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'being', 'billed', 'Jet', 'last', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'Reason', 'being', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'performance', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'believe', 'Jet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'fighting', 'flicks', 'already', 'been', 'talking', 'quite', 'while', ""'The"", 'One', 'part', '2', 'Shaolin', 'fighter', 'movie', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'say', 'last', 'want', 'see', 'so', 'badly', 'AND', 'THEY', 'HAVE', 'GOOD', 'REASON']",N/A
984045,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B000F6VVVG,Ping Lim,"[1, 3]","For those of us that grew up with Jet Li, we have seen him playing various roles that are famous in Chinese folklores such as Fang Shi Yu, Chang San Fong, Huang Fei Hong and now, Huo Yuan Jia.  Because all those characters are prevalent during the Ching Dynasty, Jet's characters are always wearing pigtails.  In Chinese title, Fearless is actually named Huo Yuan Jia but for Western audience, it wouldn't mean a thing.  But in Chinese society, everyone would know that he's the martial art master that fought against his challengers and to be poisoned by Japanese authority subsequently.  Many Chinese TV dramas of him have since been spunned off and some even have sequels of his most outstanding disciple venting his revenge against the Japanese.  Now that we are living in the 21st century, one-sided story never makes a good yarn and thus, Japanese characters in this instance are portrayed with sensibility.  How much factual this movie is towards the real person is also beyond me.  Suffice to say that the story is rather cliche, someone who has seen his own wrong doings, seeking repentance from himself and in the end, exerting his moral authority to do the just and along the way, gaining respects from everyone.  Yes, it sounds like Ghandi on adrenalin, if you think of his earlier days in South Africa and his evolution into this peaceful old guy in a stick partaking in the infamous Salt March.  Anyway, Jet Li's movie is always about actions and it used to be that I would look forward to his action bits and skipping the rest because his acting ability is simply woeful especially when he's in Western movies.  However, in this instance, it's the Renaissance Jet Li that we are seeing and he is able to portray an arrogant person, a person who has lost his way, a person who knows better and wiser, a forgiving person prior to Huo's untimely death.  In terms of Yuen Ho Ping's choreography, this would be his rawest contribution yet but rather effective.  Please don't be turned off by Director's previous directing efforts because in this instance, Raymond is doing a heck of a good job.  A sound and effectual movie but never raises over the top.
