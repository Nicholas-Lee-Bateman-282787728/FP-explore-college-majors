Minutella ""mystery buff""","[14, 15]","After three great, innovative seasons featuring some terrific writing and acting, QAF in its 4th season is starting to show some rust on its hinges. In its attempt to be more thoughtful and mature, it's also zapped the life out of such major firecrackers as Brian and Debbie. The plot lines in this season are borderline ridiculous: the ""Rage"" Hollywood drama is so left field its hardly believable; the Melanie court battle goes nowhere; the breakup of Melanie and Lindsay over Lindsay's affair makes no sense since Melanie had previously cheated on her in season 2; Brian's cancer is handled so melodramatically it literally zaps the life out of the character; and the resolution between Emmett and Ted is undernourished to say the least, and very unsatisfying. The edginess and anything-can-happen vibe of the first three seasons is mostly absent in this season, an unfortunate turn for a once-fabulous series. However, the acting remains top notch (with the exception of Robert Gant who emotes with bug eyed indifference) and there's hope that the final season will deliver the goods.

That's extremely true. The packaging is VERY fragile and basically four large DVD covers in a paper-thin box. The other seasons came with more bonus features, more thought behind the look of the boxes, and a lot more thought in general. Some have speculated that Showtime is setting aside the money that was saved from this season's box set so that the fifth (and final) DVD would be much more extravagant and worth the money.The content (excluding bonus features) is absolutely amazing. The shows are great, the plot is fantastic, and the characters are as real and unpredictable as everyday life. So if you love the show, buy the set, it'll be worth it.

880420,AIJN7CVPQ2CS5,B0007DBJG4,arial,"[3, 5]","From its very first season to the third, Showtime's QAF is fast paced, with lots of sex, drama and loud music. The acting has always been consistently very good, but the script and story lines could always use more improvement.Nonetheless, QAF is still as entertaining as ever albeit at a much reduced pace. One could say that the characters have all grown up in Season 4. Mellowed. For example, Brian... well, Brian is no longer Brian. The ""Brian"" character has evolved the most. He is almost quite a different person in Season 4, almost only because one thing has not changed ie. he is still to-die-for hot!My complaints for this season - the DVD box set is not as pretty as the previous 3 seasons. It looks cheap-er. The bonus features are not great either. Like a lot of QAF/DVD fans, I really miss the behind-the-scene bloopers. Sorry, they could have been way better. Season 4, like Season 3, is also very short. Too short for my liking. It also looks like they, the producers, are keeping us audience waiting until the very last moment before they unleash the final Season 5. Nothing is given away. No clue at all from the bonus features of Season 4.However, from the Season 5 promo, it clearly looks like All Bets Are Off! I really can't wait until the final season is released, on DVD, that is. It'll be a long while yet! I'll be sure to check out the various QAF forums on the net for some info about the new season.Finally, thank you Amazon.com for the speedy delivery of the Season 4 DVD set.

Season 4, as well as the previous seasons, really tackles issues of concern for the gay community.  Queer As Folk presents gays and lesbians as humans -something that our society has worked extra hard to avoid, and it is for this reason that this show is a must.  It is a real eye opener for those that do not know the ""gay world"" and those that must someday become part of it.  I recommend this series to anyone dealing with issues of homosexuality.  This show was long overdue, it will be a real lose when the last episode of the series is aired.  With its no apologies and no excuse way of presenting gay life, it was finally something for the gay community to watch that was not candy coated or censored to meet the needs and expectations of the non-homosexual world.

880422,A3JM17QHAJCOWD,B0007DBJG4,Catherine Gallanti,"[7, 9]","Well, what can I say. I have been an avid QAF fan. I have loved this show with more passion than any TV production in years. I love the casting, I love the characters. I think every actor in this show is very special in their very unique kind of way. I do not have Showtime, so I had been waiting with anticipation for season four since July, when I first finished watching season three. I had pre-booked season four and was counting the days to the DVD release date. After watching the whole series in two days, I have found myself feeling very sad and, well, yes, disappointed. What happened to the good, engaging daring scripts? What happened to the hip feeling of this show? I understand that the boys are maturing, but does this mean that they become dull? Is it not possible to stay fabulous and outside of the box as one grows? I feel that the characters are becoming too politically correct, for lack of a better word...one can go on so much about the issues as to drown out the fun. There are ways to talk about the issues less blatantly and more powerfully. The way seasons 1-3 were done. This series verges on boring- and this is coming from a die hard fan!(...)Also I did not like the Brian gets cancer in his sexual area storyline. I find it kind of defeats what I thought was part of the message of the series: a message of sexual liberation. I found throughout the series that the character of Brian was a breath of fresh air, no matter if gay or straight. Here is a man that embodies a very unique form of eroticism, a male sensuality/sexuality that is bold and aggressive and yet on another level sensitive and introspective. A very interesting and uninhibited depiction of male Eros - not what we usually see on screen. A character that also was, as said so many times, unapologetic about his sexuality. And yet, in season four we see this man crippled by his Eros. How else can one interpret testicular cancer if not as an imbalance in his sexuality? I know that he is then forced to love himself beyond his sexual identity and to go beyond his own self created sexual predator image, but still, I think there were other ways to make this character grow that would have had less of a "" you slept around and were overly sexual and now your sexual organs get cancer"" kind of message. This feels like an apology to me. As usual sex gets a bad rap, in the end.This little vent aside, all the storylines in the fourth season were too short. They built out of nowhere and often ended without any proper resolution in just a couple of episodes. For example, the whole Lindsey/the artist story- after all that passion he just suddenly disappears and Lindsay never thinks of him again? Hum, not very realistic. And Emmit and the football player? Same thing. They get together, things get steamy, Emmit ends it and he is never to be seen or spoken of again. Also I did not feel that the relationship between him and Ted was wrapped up well. IMHO, of course.This season had a very different feel from previous seasons, feels almost rushed, like it was done in a hurry without much thought. This makes me feel sad, as this was such groundbreaking television and it is sad to see something so good slowly slipping into average ness. I hope they do better with season 5 and that they bring back some of the full on outrageousness and powerful emotion that was so distinctive of the first few seasons. There were some episodes in seasons 1-3 that gave me goose bumps they were so powerful. No goose bumps here, unfortunately.I am giving this season 4 stars out of the deep love I have for the show and its actors, but, please, bring back the good scripts and the flauntingly hip vibe. Still hoping for a magnificent season five.",4,Sad: an excellent show slowly slipping into averageness,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3732,"['Well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'avid', 'QAF', 'fan', 'have', 'loved', 'show', 'more', 'passion', 'TV', 'production', 'years', 'love', 'casting', 'love', 'characters', 'think', 'actor', 'show', 'very', 'special', 'very', 'unique', 'kind', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Showtime', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'anticipation', 'season', 'four', 'July', 'when', 'first', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', 'three', 'had', 'pre-booked', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'counting', 'days', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'two', 'days', 'have', 'found', 'feeling', 'very', 'sad', 'well', 'yes', 'disappointed', 'What', 'happened', 'good', 'engaging', 'daring', 'scripts', 'What', 'happened', 'hip', 'feeling', 'show', 'understand', 'boys', 'are', 'maturing', 'mean', 'become', 'dull', 'not', 'possible', 'stay', 'fabulous', 'outside', 'box', 'one', 'feel', 'characters', 'are', 'becoming', 'too', 'politically', 'correct', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'issues', 'drown', 'out', 'fun', 'are', 'ways', 'talk', 'issues', 'less', 'blatantly', 'more', 'powerfully', 'way', 'seasons', '1-3', 'were', 'done', 'series', 'boring-', 'coming', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Also', 'did', 'not', 'Brian', 'cancer', 'sexual', 'area', 'storyline', 'find', 'kind', 'defeats', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'part', 'message', 'series', 'message', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'found', 'series', 'character', 'Brian', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'matter', 'gay', 'straight', 'Here', 'man', 'very', 'unique', 'form', 'eroticism', 'male', 'sensuality/sexuality', 'bold', 'aggressive', 'yet', 'level', 'sensitive', 'introspective', 'very', 'interesting', 'uninhibited', 'depiction', 'male', 'Eros', 'not', 'what', 'usually', 'see', 'screen', 'character', 'also', 'was', 'said', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'unapologetic', 'sexuality', 'yet', 'season', 'four', 'see', 'man', 'crippled', 'Eros', 'How', 'else', 'can', 'one', 'interpret', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'not', 'imbalance', 'sexuality', 'know', 'then', 'forced', 'love', 'sexual', 'identity', 'go', 'own', 'self', 'created', 'sexual', 'predator', 'image', 'still', 'think', 'were', 'other', 'ways', 'make', 'character', 'grow', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'less', 'slept', 'around', 'were', 'overly', 'sexual', 'now', 'sexual', 'organs', 'get', 'cancer', 'kind', 'message', 'apology', 'usual', 'sex', 'bad', 'rap', 'end.This', 'little', 'vent', 'aside', 'storylines', 'fourth', 'season', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'built', 'nowhere', 'often', 'ended', 'proper', 'resolution', 'just', 'couple', 'episodes', 'example', 'whole', 'Lindsey/the', 'artist', 'story-', 'passion', 'just', 'suddenly', 'Lindsay', 'never', 'again', 'Hum', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'Emmit', 'football', 'player', 'Same', 'thing', 'get', 'together', 'things', 'get', 'steamy', 'Emmit', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'spoken', 'again', 'Also', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'relationship', 'Ted', 'was', 'wrapped', 'up', 'well', 'IMHO', 'course.This', 'season', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'feel', 'previous', 'seasons', 'feels', 'almost', 'rushed', 'was', 'done', 'hurry', 'much', 'thought', 'feel', 'sad', 'was', 'such', 'groundbreaking', 'television', 'sad', 'see', 'something', 'so', 'good', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'average', 'ness', 'hope', 'do', 'better', 'season', '5', 'bring', 'back', 'full', 'outrageousness', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'was', 'so', 'distinctive', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'were', 'episodes', 'seasons', '1-3', 'gave', 'goose', 'bumps', 'were', 'so', 'powerful', 'goose', 'bumps', 'here', 'unfortunately.I', 'am', 'giving', 'season', '4', 'stars', 'deep', 'love', 'have', 'show', 'actors', 'please', 'bring', 'back', 'good', 'scripts', 'flauntingly', 'hip', 'vibe', 'Still', 'hoping', 'magnificent', 'season', 'five']",N/A
880423,A2MBF4WWPD470M,B0007DBJG4,Charles J. Mcgeever,"[2, 5]","The fourth season is an extraordinary artistic achievement. The previous seasons were fun, adolescent, and very raunchy, but season four is more mature, more focused on character, and concerned about theme as well as interpersonal relationships in a way we have never seen before.Some characters I missed seeing  return in four: Blake, more gorgeous as a good  boy than a bad one, helps Ted through rehab; Carl, the gritty yet likeable cop is here, too; and Hunter's disconnected  mother reveals her ""true"" tortured persona. There are great new faces as well: Cody, an Edward Norton look alike, persuades Justin to hook up  with a straight-bashing group known as the Pink Posse; Sam, an artist with talent and a libido to match, complicates Mealanie and Lindsay's relationship; and, Brett Keller, a Hollywood director who wants to adapt the comicbook, ""Rage,"" to film with Tom Cruise or Toby McGuire as the lead, introduces a naive Justin to the Hollywood  scene.One of our favorite characters dies, but is a revenant in some pivotal scenes with Brian Kinney who is worried about his  own mortality. The revenant tells Brian not to worry: ""You'll be around for a long time."" Brian asks, ""How do you know?"" The answer: ""Judy told me; she's very in with God.""  Emmet and Michael go on a two-week ""fairy"" retreat where Michaels chhoses the fairy name ""Powder Puff,"" I  think, and Michael and Ben are awarded custody of Hunter. Oh, yeah: Brian is fired and sets up his own company.The script for each episode is profoundly literary. Kinney, of all people, quotes Shakespeare and the Old Testament while Ben finds an admirer for his novel who turns out to be a bugchaser.In sum,  the fourth season represents a magical coming to0gether of cast, production techniques, and  script. In the final episode, for instance, two tunes are prominantly interspersed: ""When Jesus Wash"" (O Happy Day) and ""Somewhere Ove the Rainbow.""

I always buy the sets as they are released & am proud & happy to own them.I hope the show goes on for at least a few more years.  I've heard that the 5th season may be it's final one.  I hope this isn't true.  This show is topical, groundbreaking & engrossing.  The characters bond well in the face of adversity & genuinely love & care about each other.It's really refreshing to see a creative & contemporary series address bigotry in our society & spit in the face of it & be bold enough to rebel against ""convention"", whatever that is!  I applaud the creators & the cast for doing this show & making a difference in the lives of many by their portrayals in & contributions to the series.  They deserve a great deal of credit as far as i'm concerned.  And I know many feel just as I do.I absolutely love Emmett, he's a card & someone i'd be only too proud to have as a best friend.  I think Brian is sexy as hell & love his sarcasm, he is a tough nut to crack where his friends & others are concerned, but in the end he always comes through for them, showing he is not callous & unfeeling, but human, which endears us to him even more.I also like Ben alot & Michael & Lynds & Mel.  They're great too!April 5th cannot get here fast enough.  I'm very anxious for my copy!  The only other thing that would make this show even better, is if it also examined a storyline centering on the Transgendered community.  Trash TV, such as Jerry Springer has made a mockery of who we are & so society's perception of us is, as Freaks.  This show I have no doubt would portray us in a realistic fashion & show us as real people & demonstrate how we, along with those in the gay community aspire for equality & the same respect of those in mainstream society.

880425,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B0007DBJG4,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[9, 18]","Somewhere in its five-year run, Showtime's ""Queer as Folk"" series picked up the disclaimer that the presentation of life here isn't intended as a real-life depiction of gay and lesbian life. How true! This fourth season maintains a gradual slide of the show's quality after its freshman season despite attempts to deal with two significant issues, one still a raging political and moral debate and the other an intensively private agony. As for the first, the series dishes up a lame treatment of the same-sex controversy as Michael and his college professor lover, Ben, literally peddle off to Canada to tie the knot, only to return to the United States to find societal refusal to acknowledge their marriage still there. And the reaction of Michael's boisterous mother, Debbie, usually played flawlessly by Sharon Gless, is a less-than-satisfying stand to shack up rather than marry her lover detective as some kind of moral protest. In the other, the always nerve-grating Brian comes down with testicular cancer, and the show's depiction of it is nowhere near the grim reality endured by anyone diagnosed with cancer and their loved ones. As Showtime concedes, ""Queer as Folk"" is not meant to be an accurate depiction of an ""alternative"" lifestyle: anyone looking for that needs to get it somewhere else. But if a break from realism is needed and a suspension of credibility is okay, and if the viewer can overlook a couple of truly irritating characters, this season's rates about average. Expecting anything more will bring disappointment.",3,Much ado about nothing,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1544,"['Somewhere', 'five-year', 'run', 'Showtime', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'series', 'picked', 'disclaimer', 'presentation', 'life', 'here', ""n't"", 'intended', 'real-life', 'depiction', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'life', 'How', 'true', 'fourth', 'season', 'gradual', 'slide', 'show', 'quality', 'freshman', 'season', 'attempts', 'deal', 'two', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'still', 'raging', 'political', 'moral', 'debate', 'other', 'intensively', 'private', 'agony', 'first', 'series', 'up', 'lame', 'treatment', 'same-sex', 'controversy', 'Michael', 'college', 'professor', 'lover', 'Ben', 'literally', 'peddle', 'off', 'Canada', 'tie', 'knot', 'only', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'find', 'societal', 'refusal', 'acknowledge', 'marriage', 'still', 'there', 'reaction', 'Michael', 'boisterous', 'mother', 'Debbie', 'usually', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'less-than-satisfying', 'stand', 'shack', 'up', 'rather', 'marry', 'lover', 'detective', 'kind', 'moral', 'protest', 'other', 'always', 'nerve-grating', 'Brian', 'down', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'show', 'depiction', 'nowhere', 'grim', 'reality', 'endured', 'anyone', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'loved', 'ones', 'Showtime', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'anyone', 'looking', 'get', 'somewhere', 'else', 'break', 'realism', 'needed', 'suspension', 'credibility', 'okay', 'viewer', 'can', 'overlook', 'couple', 'truly', 'irritating', 'characters', 'season', 'rates', 'average', 'Expecting', 'anything', 'more', 'will', 'bring', 'disappointment']",N/A

880427,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0007DBJG4,David Anderson,"[7, 7]","When ""Queer As Folk"" originally debuted in The UK in 1999, it earned massive critical acclaim.  Unlike other sitcoms that came before it, this tackled controversial issues that many unfortunately do not accept.  Many people began talking.  A year later, The US version aired on Showtime, and the reaction was the same.  This gave millions from the GLBT community and their allies something to relate.  Its powerful storylines grabbed many audiences' attention.  Before its debut, only two other sitcoms tackled GLBT issues to this magnitude: ""Will And Grace"" and ""Ellen"".  This earns the cast and crew tremendous respect for doing what few others have dared and result successfully.  It has since earned many award nominations and wins, including four consecutive GLAAD (Gay, Lesbians, and Allies Against Defamination) nominations for Outstanding TV Drama.Season four is no acception.  Though it has toned down its sexually graphic nature, the subject matter remains as powerful and attention-grabbing as since its debut.  It maintains its ""in your face"" and its unapologetic theme wonderfully.  Nobody could ask for more.  It expresses issues dealing with HIV/ AIDS, cancer, standing up for ones' rights, gays in professional sports, same-sex marriage, same-sex parenting, and others.  This well-written and produced season shows some growth in certain plots and characters.  Though there's less major plots compared to the previous seasons, it proves that the show has come a long way since its debut.  This season beautifully presents how everything has evolved to where it is now, especially the flashbacks to the beginning.Season four awaits many plot surprises.  It begins by answering questions about season three's cliffhanger: Does Ted complete rehab?  Will Ted regain the trust lost from his friends?  Will Michael get arrested for protecting Hunter from his abusive mother?  Meanwhile, viewers will witness Justin briefly joining the violent street-watching group Pink Posse (hence his dramatic change in hairstyle), Ben encountering a disturbed student hunting for the HIV virus, a dating revolution in Hunter, a death within the group, a change in Lindsay and Mel's relationship, and a surprising maturing point in Brian while still maintaining his signature ""no-bullshit"" reputation.  Such powerful storylines are only part of what keeps this show running strong after four years.  Everything combined leads to a conclusion that keeps audiences anxiously awaiting for season five.Through these storylines, the cast performs their roles wonderfully.  Through their angry scenes, passionate scenes, disturbing scenes, despressing scenes, and celebrating scenes, they maintain their talents.  All express their unique personalities through the characters beautifully, giving the show its variety that makes it more enjoyable.  Brian's bluntness, Emmitt's flamboyance, Michael's child-like charm, Debbie's eccentricness, and others fit beautifully as one masterpiece thanks to the cast.  The chemistry within everyone remains strong as since its debut, namely the trio of romantic relationships.  Despite, Sharon Gless and Peter Paige state their performances the strongest.The enjoyable bonus features are great for after having watched every episode.  The trailers of two films featuring certain cast members await audiences for their release dates: ""Say Uncle"" and ""The Unseen"".  Peter Paige makes his directorial debut in ""Say Uncle"", which explores a man who comes out of the closet and is immediately accused of being a pedophile.  ""The Unseen"", starring Gale Howard and Michelle Clunie explores a town that is threatened by severe racism.  Also included are a behind-the-scenes of the Babylon Tour and the wardrobe designing.  All these short clips make for interesting viewing beyond the show.Such show quality makes ""Queer As Folk: Season Four"" essential for show fans.  This is sure to please many of its audiences GLBT or straight.  Those interested in this must watch the previous seasons first in order.  Otherwise, nobody will know what's occurring.Cast: Gale Howard (Brian), Hal Sparks (Michael), Randy Harrison (Justin), Peter Paige (Emmitt), Scott Lowell (Ted), Robert Gant (Ben), Thea Gill (Lindsay), Michelle Clunie (Mel), and Sharon Gless (Debbie)",5,Still Running Strong,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,4277,"['When', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'originally', 'debuted', 'UK', '1999', 'earned', 'massive', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'came', 'tackled', 'controversial', 'issues', 'many', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'accept', 'Many', 'people', 'began', 'talking', 'year', 'later', 'US', 'version', 'aired', 'Showtime', 'reaction', 'was', 'same', 'gave', 'millions', 'GLBT', 'community', 'allies', 'something', 'relate', 'powerful', 'storylines', 'grabbed', 'many', 'audiences', 'attention', 'debut', 'only', 'two', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'tackled', 'GLBT', 'issues', 'magnitude', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Ellen', 'cast', 'crew', 'tremendous', 'respect', 'doing', 'what', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'dared', 'result', 'successfully', 'earned', 'many', 'award', 'nominations', 'wins', 'including', 'four', 'consecutive', 'GLAAD', 'Gay', 'Lesbians', 'Allies', 'Against', 'Defamination', 'nominations', 'Outstanding', 'TV', 'Drama.Season', 'four', 'acception', 'toned', 'down', 'sexually', 'graphic', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'powerful', 'attention-grabbing', 'debut', 'face', 'unapologetic', 'theme', 'wonderfully', 'Nobody', 'could', 'ask', 'more', 'issues', 'dealing', 'HIV/', 'AIDS', 'cancer', 'standing', 'up', 'ones', 'rights', 'gays', 'professional', 'sports', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'same-sex', 'parenting', 'others', 'well-written', 'produced', 'season', 'shows', 'growth', 'certain', 'plots', 'characters', 'less', 'major', 'plots', 'compared', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'debut', 'season', 'beautifully', 'how', 'everything', 'evolved', 'where', 'now', 'especially', 'flashbacks', 'beginning.Season', 'four', 'awaits', 'many', 'plot', 'surprises', 'answering', 'questions', 'season', 'three', 'cliffhanger', 'Does', 'Ted', 'complete', 'rehab', 'Will', 'Ted', 'regain', 'trust', 'lost', 'friends', 'Will', 'Michael', 'get', 'arrested', 'protecting', 'Hunter', 'abusive', 'mother', 'Meanwhile', 'viewers', 'will', 'witness', 'Justin', 'briefly', 'joining', 'violent', 'street-watching', 'group', 'Pink', 'Posse', 'hence', 'dramatic', 'change', 'hairstyle', 'Ben', 'encountering', 'disturbed', 'student', 'hunting', 'HIV', 'virus', 'dating', 'revolution', 'Hunter', 'death', 'group', 'change', 'Lindsay', 'Mel', 'relationship', 'surprising', 'maturing', 'point', 'Brian', 'still', 'maintaining', 'signature', 'no-bullshit', 'reputation', 'Such', 'powerful', 'storylines', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'what', 'show', 'running', 'strong', 'four', 'years', 'Everything', 'combined', 'leads', 'conclusion', 'audiences', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'season', 'storylines', 'cast', 'roles', 'wonderfully', 'angry', 'scenes', 'passionate', 'scenes', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'despressing', 'scenes', 'celebrating', 'scenes', 'maintain', 'talents', 'express', 'unique', 'personalities', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'giving', 'show', 'variety', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Brian', 'bluntness', 'Emmitt', 'flamboyance', 'Michael', 'child-like', 'charm', 'Debbie', 'eccentricness', 'others', 'fit', 'beautifully', 'one', 'masterpiece', 'thanks', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'everyone', 'strong', 'debut', 'namely', 'trio', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'state', 'performances', 'strongest.The', 'enjoyable', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'having', 'watched', 'episode', 'trailers', 'two', 'films', 'featuring', 'certain', 'cast', 'members', 'await', 'audiences', 'release', 'dates', 'Say', 'Uncle', 'Unseen', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Say', 'Uncle', 'man', 'who', 'closet', 'immediately', 'accused', 'being', 'pedophile', 'Unseen', 'starring', 'Gale', 'Howard', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'town', 'threatened', 'severe', 'racism', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Babylon', 'Tour', 'wardrobe', 'designing', 'short', 'clips', 'make', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'show.Such', 'show', 'quality', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Season', 'Four', 'essential', 'show', 'fans', 'sure', 'please', 'many', 'audiences', 'GLBT', 'straight', 'interested', 'must', 'watch', 'previous', 'seasons', 'first', 'order', 'Otherwise', 'nobody', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'occurring.Cast', 'Gale', 'Howard', 'Brian', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Michael', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Justin', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'Emmitt', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Ted', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'Ben', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Lindsay', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'Mel', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Debbie']",N/A

Ted, who was considered the wallflower, started becoming a stronger person through each episode. He kicked his drug addiction, dropped those druggies, renewed his friendship with the gang, and gained a job in Brian's new company Kinetic.I was also glad that Cowlip decided to focus more on Michael and Ben's relationship. The previous season showed less of them and too much of Brian and Justin whose relationship is an ""open door policy"". In the wake of presidential elections, gay marriages caused a furor between ""family value"" groups and the GLBT community. Cowlip had to step up to the plate on Michael and Ben showing them tackle parenting Hunter, a street kid who was forced to do tricks to feed his mother's drug habit, and resolving relationship conflicts.I was sorry to see Victor pass on. He was just life on his own with his new partner and getting out from under Debbie's grasp. He is the mirror of the past and the future of gay men. He survived amidst the politics of sexuality and civil rights. His extravagant lifestyle forced him to lay low just as he was getting himself back on track (working with Emmett and his newfound love), he had to die. I thought that was a blow, but it was also the beginning of the end of the series.The relationship between Melanie and Lindsay has experienced highs and lows, but it takes another turn. Melanie, carrying a child, tries to juggle a career and maintain the household. They both dote very much on Gus.Debbie, Michael's mother, is always full of mouth. She and Horvath get back together. Good. She and Emmett share a house since both of them can't live alone. Speaking of which, Emmett can never live by himself. He lived with Michael; then he lived with Ted. But he's always enjoyable to watch. His business is doing well but he tanks in the relationship. He gets himself involved with a football player who is engaged to be married. Oh what a tangled web we weave!Let's not forget Brian and Justin. Although I get tired of seeing them in their sexual escapades, which is what fans love, I am glad that they didn't try to watershed Brian too much. He wanted to get more involved in his son's life which is touching. Seeing Justin negotiate a deal on the Rage movie proved very much that he is able to make it on his own without Brian. But will both of them ever decide to be monogamous?Relatively new to the series, I see that the show does exemplify the gay culture socially, politically, and economically.",5,Best Season Ever,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,2511,"['was', 'good', 'season', 'characters', 'Ted', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'wallflower', 'started', 'becoming', 'stronger', 'person', 'episode', 'kicked', 'drug', 'addiction', 'dropped', 'druggies', 'renewed', 'friendship', 'gang', 'gained', 'job', 'Brian', 'new', 'company', 'Kinetic.I', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'Cowlip', 'decided', 'focus', 'more', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'relationship', 'previous', 'season', 'showed', 'less', 'too', 'much', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'relationship', 'open', 'door', 'policy', 'wake', 'presidential', 'elections', 'gay', 'marriages', 'caused', 'furor', 'family', 'value', 'groups', 'GLBT', 'community', 'Cowlip', 'had', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'showing', 'tackle', 'parenting', 'Hunter', 'street', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'do', 'tricks', 'feed', 'mother', 'drug', 'habit', 'resolving', 'relationship', 'conflicts.I', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'Victor', 'pass', 'was', 'just', 'life', 'own', 'new', 'partner', 'getting', 'out', 'Debbie', 'grasp', 'mirror', 'past', 'future', 'gay', 'men', 'survived', 'amidst', 'politics', 'sexuality', 'civil', 'rights', 'extravagant', 'lifestyle', 'forced', 'lay', 'low', 'just', 'was', 'getting', 'back', 'track', 'working', 'Emmett', 'newfound', 'love', 'had', 'die', 'thought', 'was', 'blow', 'was', 'also', 'beginning', 'end', 'series.The', 'relationship', 'Melanie', 'Lindsay', 'experienced', 'highs', 'lows', 'turn', 'Melanie', 'carrying', 'child', 'juggle', 'career', 'maintain', 'household', 'dote', 'very', 'much', 'Gus.Debbie', 'Michael', 'mother', 'always', 'full', 'mouth', 'Horvath', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Good', 'Emmett', 'share', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'alone', 'Speaking', 'Emmett', 'can', 'never', 'live', 'lived', 'Michael', 'then', 'lived', 'Ted', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'business', 'doing', 'well', 'relationship', 'involved', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'Oh', 'what', 'tangled', 'web', 'weave', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'what', 'fans', 'love', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'watershed', 'Brian', 'too', 'much', 'wanted', 'get', 'more', 'involved', 'son', 'life', 'touching', 'Seeing', 'Justin', 'negotiate', 'deal', 'Rage', 'movie', 'proved', 'very', 'much', 'able', 'make', 'own', 'Brian', 'will', 'ever', 'decide', 'be', 'monogamous', 'Relatively', 'new', 'series', 'see', 'show', 'exemplify', 'gay', 'culture', 'socially', 'politically', 'economically']",N/A

By it's fourth season Queer as Folk had found it's stride. The writers had the characters and their storylines established and the show has the flow of a well tuned series that knew where it was going. Episode one of season four starts off with drama and ends with a bang. Brian has a lot of financial problems and doesn't know how to go about getting the money to sustain himself. He is too proud to ask his friends and supporters for help but by episodes end he put his pride aside and realizes that nothin is wrong with a little help from friends. Michael and Hunter are still on the run. Hunter is hoping to not have to live with his mother again, but his mother is actively working to gain custody of him. His mother threatens to call the police if Hunter is home soon. Ben gets word to Ted is in rehab at the start of the episode. He briefly leaves rehab and returns home a bit suicidal--or at least talking about suicide. These are just a few of the storylines working at the beginning of season four.  Episode one of season 4 ends with the brutal hate driven attack of a character.There is alwasy drama going on during the fourth season of Queer as Folk. The show does include some graphic gay sex scenes, but this is a show that both straight and gay viewers will enjoy. The writing is wonderful, the acting is superb and this is a one hour drama that will make you want to watch more than one episode at a time.The DVD set includes all 14 episodes from the fourth season. The DVD's come in individual protective cases enclosed in a blue box. The special collectors edition DVD box set has a nice amount of extras that the Queer as Folk fan is sure to enjoy, although I have been told the extras pale in comparison to previous seasons. All of the bonus material is included on disc five.I must admit, I am new to the show and only started watching it this season.

880430,AM059O5PLNQBA,B0007DBJG4,"Dustin C. Holden ""Da Reel Deal""","[34, 40]","As an avid view of the show, I urge anyone to at least RENT this series on DVD!  This is such a good show.  The first couple of seasons are really hard for people to get past because of the ""graphic"" sex scenes (I only use quotations because, to me, now they aren't so graphic).  As the program has continued on and the characters have aged, the sex has died down (thus ending the shock-factor to draw in audiences), and the storylines have matured.You can honestly look at these characters and relate them to everyday people in your life.  They have such emotion and depth to them that the crazy situations that they continuously find themselves in start to become believable.Don't get me wrong, this is a nighttime soap opera with gay characters, but it's not cheesy or fashion-centered.

It's truly a remarkable  season with the writers allowing the characters to mature, to change, and for some, to become rather bitter and, sadly for some, to get sick and to no longer exist being reflective of life as it,(I'm afraid)really is.(On subsequent viewings of this season,  I have noted a hint of sadness in the actors--maybe they are trying to give off a sense of nostalgia due to the passing of time--I really don't know but it is very touching)I look forward to future episodes but not to the conclusion of this great series.

But in Folk, all that many of the important characters and extras do is get laid and do drugs in clubs. Many of the people are prurient, bitter, overly dramatic jerks. And their actions make me scoff with incredulity.The irresponsibility of having sex with people without even knowing their FIRST NAMES is just ridiculous, yet you see plenty of anonymous, animalistic sex in the back rooms of the clubs they frequently visit. I mean, two men just walk up to each other and start screwing. It's disgusting. Haven't we learned anything from the whoring generation of the 70s?The show as a whole is sexually gratuitous and the characters are lame and annoying. They make weak attempts at political stories, but they come off as obligatory with no heart. In fact this show doesn't seem to have a heart.

From marriage to runaways, to AIDS, to cancer, the plots of QAF cover and vast and wide range, and that precisely becomes the problem.We left the gang with a great victory over a corrupt politican, and the reemergence of LIberty Avenue in all of its colorful glory. Michael is on the lam with Hunter. Brian is broke. Ted is experiencing rehab, and Mel is pregnant. The first few episodes rap up those plotlines fairly satisfactorily, with the exception of Hunter's story, which seemed a bit too quick and convienient.But then, the show seemed ot take a wrong turn. It began to feel as if the writers of the show had a giant wheel in their offices filled with possible plot lines. They'd spin it, and that was that week's problem they'd introduce. It began to feel as if they were trying to cover all of the bases of gay life, rather than pay attention to the story. For example, the Justin vigilante story came to a conclusion, somewhat, and then the next week Justin is all gaga over a movie deal.One rather fulfilling storyline is Ted's re-emergence after rehab. He struggles with putting his life together, and repairing all of the damage inflicting in the last season. Somewhat unexplicably, most of Ted's friend abandoned him during his most critical moments, but Ted pushes through and makes peace. It was actually nice to see Ted move back to the center of his orginial character.Each season of QAF ended with a bang, and this one, ends with a mere whimper. Sure, I'll still watch the show.

This, too, communicates thatQAF has lost it's status with Showtime.  Personally, I happen to prefer the standard DVD cases of this seasonover the splashy foldout boxes of the other seasons (the standard cases protect the DVDs better and are easier to handle withouthaving to do a balancing act), but still, the packaging downgrade does indicate a loss of status for the show in the eyes of Showtime's marketing folks.But more than that, is the fact that there are, in my opinion, NO significant ""extras"" on this set.  There isa photo gallery (ho-hum), a fashion photo gallery (snooze....), and a bunch of promos for other movies done bya couple of cast members (sell, sell, sell...).  There is a short Babylon/LA piece, but one only sees a couple ofvery brief glimpses of Hal Sparks and Scott Lowell signing autographs.  No substantive material.  There is even a cruise giveaway labeled an ""extra"" (gimme a break!).  Most of these are advertisements.  Only the photo galleryfashion gallery could truly be classified as ""extras"" and these are VERY WEAK.What is MISSING are the wonderful behind-the-scenes programs about the production of the show, or, like lastseason's set, the interesting day-in-the-life of the stars during their hiatus.  There is NOTHING of this calibrehere in this set.  Also, unless I have missed it (I've watched up through episode 12), there are no producer/star commentary tracks either.  LAST season's eps had that wonderful program where they were all sitting around inthe Brian's Loft set and watching the episode with us.  Great!  Nothing like that here.It's almost as if Showtime just gave up on the show now that it's been announced that season five will be thelast season (after all why put money/effort behind something that's already cancelled?).

This New Queer As Folk Season 4 DVD Box Set has all 14 episodes of the fourth season which still happens to be one of the most controversial and bravest series on television today. The BOX SET includes Bonus features such as: Behind-the-scenes with Peter Paige's directorial debut; Sneak peek at Michelle Clunie and Gale harold's latest movie; Behind the Babylon tour; Wardrobe closet; Photo gallery; Biographies; plus Previews and promotions. I have seen all 14 episodes of Season 4 and it is another great and very emotional season. Like before I am a little upset that this season is very short (like season 3) when compared to season 1 and 2. Either way season 4 is still a good season. I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Queer As Folk ia about the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show has some issues that are far more real for some than others. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something that we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. With season 5 rumored to be the final season I encourage you all to enjoy this great show because very few shows can touch your heart yet push the limit as far as this show has. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think. Watch more than one episode before you judge this amazing series. I would just like to say Queer As Folk Season 1 and 2 and 3 are also great to own.

QAF continues to dodge the unconventional & take its characters & storylines to unchartered waters.I was glad to see Michael & Ben gain custody of former teen hustler Hunter and create the ""new family of the millenium"". They've driven each other almost crazy, but gained strength from their own personal issues. Gale Harold deserves a medal as Brian; he has succeeded in softening his character around the edges (he's actually more loving and--gasp!--more monogamous with Justin) while at the same time, retaining his typically jaded exterior. Not an easy feat to do. Speaking of Justin--his ""gay vigilante"" story arc was powerful, voicing the pent-up rage any gay person feels towards violence in their community. The story progresses from patroling the streets to brandishing weapons to picking fights ""before they get us first"". Justin finally gets his justice with basher Chris Hobbs, but does it on his own terms. Brian's secret battle with testicular cancer deconstructs his character momentarily as he deals with the strength-sapping effects of radiation treatments, and--worst for him--diminished sex drive, his own personal ""kryptonite"". Ted's struggle to reclaim his life after hitting bottom from substance abuse might have been tedious & annoying, but it's luckily wrapped up in time.I was sorry to see the passing of Uncle Vic, such a wonderful supporting character & enduring icon to the show. As Justin summarized beautifully at his funeral: ""He was gay long before it was fashionable"".One plot bordered on the improbable (Effeminate Emmett having a furious affair with a straight-acting, macho pro football player??). Another leaned back on the familiar (Lindsay cheating on Melanie...with a MAN??). But even these storylines had some insightful moments.I was relieved, for a change, to have a cliffhanger that didn't hinge on the overly dramatic or shocking. Here, most of the characters (Justin was absent pitching a movie deal in Hollywood for the ""Rage"" comic book character) are given a breath of fresh air--literally--by participating in a fund-raising bike marathon from Toronto to Pittsburgh. The ""Liberty Ride"" season-ender was lighthearted, adding amusing moments (Ted & Emmett getting completely lost & conducting a 12-step meeting before cattle!) along with thoughtful, touching ones (Mike & Ben getting hitched in Toronto; Debbie proposed to by cop Karl; and Brian determined to cross the finish line after a serious bike injury).Can't wait to see the final season five!",5,"The ""queer"" cometh fourth",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,2879,"['viewing', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'appetite', 'was', 'ready', 'fourth', 'helping', 'Once', 'again', 'cast', 'crew', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'season', 'was', 'rather', 'short', 'one', 'only', '14', 'episodes', 'was', 'worthy', 'one', 'badge', 'honor', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'become', 'smash', 'hit', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'old', 'cliches', 'just', 'stagnate', 'Not', 'here', 'QAF', 'dodge', 'unconventional', 'take', 'characters', 'storylines', 'unchartered', 'waters.I', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'gain', 'custody', 'former', 'teen', 'hustler', 'Hunter', 'create', 'new', 'family', 'millenium', ""'ve"", 'driven', 'other', 'almost', 'crazy', 'gained', 'strength', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'medal', 'Brian', 'succeeded', 'softening', 'character', 'edges', 'actually', 'more', 'loving', 'gasp', 'more', 'monogamous', 'Justin', 'same', 'time', 'retaining', 'typically', 'jaded', 'exterior', 'Not', 'easy', 'feat', 'do', 'Speaking', 'Justin', 'gay', 'vigilante', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'powerful', 'voicing', 'pent-up', 'rage', 'gay', 'person', 'feels', 'towards', 'violence', 'community', 'story', 'patroling', 'streets', 'brandishing', 'weapons', 'picking', 'fights', 'get', 'first', 'Justin', 'finally', 'justice', 'basher', 'Chris', 'Hobbs', 'own', 'terms', 'Brian', 'secret', 'battle', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'character', 'momentarily', 'strength-sapping', 'effects', 'radiation', 'treatments', 'worst', 'diminished', 'sex', 'drive', 'own', 'personal', 'kryptonite', 'Ted', 'struggle', 'reclaim', 'life', 'hitting', 'bottom', 'substance', 'abuse', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'tedious', 'annoying', 'luckily', 'wrapped', 'up', 'time.I', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'passing', 'Uncle', 'Vic', 'such', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'character', 'enduring', 'icon', 'show', 'Justin', 'summarized', 'beautifully', 'funeral', 'was', 'gay', 'long', 'was', 'fashionable', '.One', 'plot', 'bordered', 'improbable', 'Effeminate', 'Emmett', 'having', 'furious', 'affair', 'straight-acting', 'macho', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'leaned', 'back', 'familiar', 'Lindsay', 'cheating', 'Melanie', 'MAN', 'even', 'storylines', 'had', 'insightful', 'moments.I', 'was', 'relieved', 'change', 'have', 'cliffhanger', 'did', ""n't"", 'hinge', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'shocking', 'Here', 'most', 'characters', 'Justin', 'was', 'absent', 'pitching', 'movie', 'deal', 'Hollywood', 'Rage', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'are', 'given', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'literally', 'participating', 'fund-raising', 'bike', 'marathon', 'Toronto', 'Pittsburgh', 'Liberty', 'Ride', 'season-ender', 'was', 'lighthearted', 'adding', 'amusing', 'moments', 'Ted', 'Emmett', 'getting', 'completely', 'lost', 'conducting', '12-step', 'meeting', 'cattle', 'thoughtful', 'touching', 'ones', 'Mike', 'Ben', 'getting', 'hitched', 'Toronto', 'Debbie', 'proposed', 'cop', 'Karl', 'Brian', 'determined', 'cross', 'finish', 'line', 'serious', 'bike', 'injury', '.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'final', 'season', 'five']",N/A

Not only is a (very) small segment of gay life examined, but it has characters that you really care about, who make decisions--good and bad--that all can relate to. Straight or gay. Straight shows are so prevalent and plentiful; yet, QAF confronts issues that haven't been touched by those others. Season 4 is quite a bit darker than the others, and way too short. After getting almost unnaturally involved with these people, it finally dawned on me that Brian is the heart and soul of this show, warts 'n all. His reflections and trials are proactive and sincere; pride be damned, he has the utmost integrity. Peter Paige as Emmett, originally a fringe character, has provided solid delight in his honesty, integrity and reliability. Sad and intense moments abound, and I was left with an intense desire to watch Season 5 for some resolutions. In my reviews of previous seasons, I failed to expand on the magnificent presence of the Lesbian couple, Melanie and Lindsey. They are ever-present and vital to the whole picture. Auxilliary characters are fine, such as Justin's militant buddy and Ted's savior counselor. Ted is still adorable in his navet&eacute; and vulnerability. What amazes me the most is the consistancy of the characterizations, each an individual with a very individual agenda. I have Season 5, and I'll watch it thoughfully, as it's the last. I wish the DVDs had more info about the supporting characters. I liked so many, but I still don't know their names. Let's not forget Sharon Gless, that blast from the past that keeps a lot in perspective. Death, cancer, violence against gays, HIV, gay-parenting, and so much more is examined in Season 4. And love.

What used to be a Fun and Cleverly written show has now been turned into The Gay Version of thirtysomething. The 4th season deals way to much with Death, Immortality, Cancer, AIDS, HIV, broken friendships, broken relationships, The road to rehab and all the Shrill Whining that comes with these issues. It wasnt all bad, I mean its nice to see the characters mature and grow to a point but this is the first season in which I hardly laughed. This was also the first time in which I actually fast forwarded some of the scenes due to boredom. The problem with this season is that the writers and producers of the show take themselves way to seriously, this show used to be fun, used to be a diversion. it was just way to real for me and way to depressing. This show used to be groundbreaking, now it is stale . I am not surprised that the ratings have gone way down, my gay friends dont even talk about the show anymore and you rarely see Any of the QAF stars on mag covers. The one Ray of Light is Sharon Gless, she is Sassy as ever and her acting is top notch, its a shame that she has never been recognized by the emmmys for her role in this film. The Producers have made the right decision in ending the show(the 5th season will be its last). Hopefully, they will do the season justice and end on a high note.
