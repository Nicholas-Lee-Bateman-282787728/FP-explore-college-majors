I was wrong; it was surprisingly good.  Hong Mi-Ju is an emotionally fragile music teacher whose past comes back to haunt her--or is it all in her head?  The story unfolds like a Twilight Zone episode.If you get impatient with some of the Asian horror conventions (an insistence on cheesy effects when CGI would be better, unresolved major plot elements) then this might be more your speed.  The body count is as high, and as bloodily graphic, as a Hollywood horror flick, and while there are weaknesses in the story--I'm still not sure what the housekeeper was doing there--the ending isn't a baffling existential statement.  It's not as nuanced as a movie like A Tale of Two Sisters, but it doesn't require cliff notes to understand, either.",4,If you're looking for something a little different...,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,894,"['watched', 'Cello', 'thought', 'was', 'scraping', 'bottom', 'K-horror', 'barrel', 'movie', 'haunted', 'musical', 'instrument', 'sounded', 'kind', 'lame', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Hong', 'Mi-Ju', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'music', 'teacher', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'head', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode.If', 'get', 'impatient', 'Asian', 'horror', 'conventions', 'insistence', 'cheesy', 'effects', 'when', 'CGI', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'unresolved', 'major', 'plot', 'elements', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'speed', 'body', 'count', 'as', 'high', 'bloodily', 'graphic', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'flick', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'story', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'housekeeper', 'was', 'doing', 'there', 'ending', ""n't"", 'baffling', 'existential', 'statement', 'not', 'as', 'nuanced', 'movie', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', ""n't"", 'require', 'cliff', 'notes', 'understand']",Cello

994837,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000FS9FIA,Ernest Jagger,"[13, 13]","Once again, Korea has given their viewers a beautiful film in terms of cinematography. In fact, I find most Korean films these days visually stunning. However, this has never been a problem. What many of these horror films lack are real scares. Sure, ambiguity is nice once in awhile, and the revenge factor works now and then. But how about something totally different? Now, in all fairness, I do believe that Korean horror and suspense films are still a notch above what we in America churn out on a daily basis. But, these films are becoming so formulaic, that I find it hard to really like many of the films coming out of the Korean horror industry these days. That is not to say that some viewers will not like this film.For me the film itself lacks the suspense and horror that I really look forward too in this genre. Having written this, I will write that ""Cello"" is better than many films that have been released in recent years from Korea--yet that is not saying much, as so many are so similar. Yes, they are much better than most of the horror films here in the States, but one keeps hoping that they will make a breakout with some really captivating and scary films that will capture the world with the same unique quality that their dramas, and suspense films have been able to do. Moreover, the talent in both the acting, and the directing is definitely there. Yet, by continuing to churn out the same formulaic horror films at a rapid rate, they are going to suffer the same fate that American horror films now find themselves in: Stale and turgid.""Cello"" is not that bad of a film. If anything it is watchable. I would just like something a little bit more than ""well it was worth a watch."" Anyway, the films narrative is more like a drama, with very little to non-existent horror. The film centers around a woman named Hong Mi-ju (Hyeon-a Seong) who is a former Cello player. Due to a tragic car accident, she injures her hand---and as a result, she gives up playing the Cello, and instead becomes a music instructor. [One more thing I would like to add, the Korean horror/suspense genre has pretty much played out the classical music in their films, however, the sound of the cello is beautiful]. Further, there is something that still haunts Mi-ju in regards to her past: For it was in this car accident that her good friend and cello rival Tae-yeon Kim (Da-an Park) was also killed.Trying to forget this terrible incident and get on with her life, she finds herself saddled with a difficult student who is upset with the grade she has been given. Given a cassette tape from an unknown source, her past begins to haunt her again. Is Mi-ju being haunted by the spirit of her dead rival? And what about the student? How does she fit in? But there is more to the narrative. With a new servant in the house who is mute, and a daughter who begins learning how to play the cello, the film veers into more of a dramatic suspense film with the various characters that are introduced into the film. The film does drag a bit, and plays out more like a drama. And if you have seen Korean horror or thriller films you will notice there is nothing really new here. Once again, this is not a bad film, but it is not a good film either. Somewhere in between. I recommend that viewers rent the film first. It may not appeal to many viewers.

994839,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000FS9FIA,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 5]","The cover of this DVD is very appealing but not so much the film. ""Cello"" is another entry into the Asian horror genre; the South Korean Cello tries to distance itself from the pack by focusing more on the story than predictable scares. Unfortunately,this only half-works. We are treated to a rich drama involving a former cellist-turned-music instructor, her family, her tragic past and her seemingly slipping sanity, but the scares are almost non-existent.Mi-Ju is a part-time music professor with a tragic past. When she was younger, she was an up-and-coming cellist, until she was in a car accident with her rival/best friend, Tae-yeon. After Tae-yeon died, Mi-Ju gave up playing the cello and decided just to teach. One day, one of her students threatens her after receiving a bad grade and so begins Mi-Ju's problems. She is sent a mysterious cassette tape that contains a haunting cello duet that dredges up some painful memories of Tae-yeon and almost causes her to get into a car accident. She is distant from her loving family which includes her two daughters, husband and sister-in-law. Her older daughter is mentally disabled and mute, but falls in love with a cello she spies in a window. Mi-Ju buys it for her and begins to teach her how to play it. Meanwhile, a new maid moves into the house. She is creepy as hell and is also mute. It seems as though her family was killed in a car crash and she tried to commit suicide numerous times, once by swallowing acid. No more vocal cords there! Anyways, things start to get creepy slowly but surely...the family's golden lab, Sunny, begins barking all the time until one morning he is found dead. Mi-Ju starts seeing things, her daughter begins playing that haunting song on the cello, the sister-in-law goes crazy after her fiance breaks up with her and ""accidents"" befall the householdI found this different than most typical Asian horror films. The story is much more rich, with well-developed characters but it doesn't focus much on typical Ju-On or Ringu-type scares. The terror doesn't really begin until the last 20 minutes of the film, giving only glimpses of what or who is terrorizing Mi-Ju and her family. Like most Asian films, it does focus on building tension through the atmosphere. The atmosphere is nicely complemented by the gorgeous cinematography and the soundtrack (heavy on the use of the cello, of course). This is a slow film, but if you can live without the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am speed of most films today, I recommend Cello. Some claim the film is slow and redundant, but unlike most films where repetitiveness is a time-filler, the repeating themes throughout Cello actually stand for something; in this case, the nightmare that Mi-Ju relives over and over through the different tragedies she suffers.

True, the movie is based upon some common horror suspense themes.  Yes, there is a revenge aspect and an element of the beyond.  But there is also a very well crafted story of guilt and regret, as well as an intriguing plot structure that is full of small details expertly sprinkled throughout.  And contrary to a common belief that seems to be held about this movie, as far as I can tell the cello is not haunted.The film is shot beautifully and makes equal use of darkness and light for various scenes.  There is a somewhat mixed use of CG darkness (you will have to see for yourself to understand what I mean) that sometimes seems to be an add-on.  But overall, this is a slick looking film.The cast is made up of some big stars of Korean film, as well as some relative unknowns.  The results are very impressive and the entire cast does a good job.The film makes greater use of plot and character development to build suspense.  There is some use of special effects but not really too much gore.  This is a slow moving movie that is meant to be analyzed.  If that's not your kind of horror, then you have been warned.ConclusionThe final scene of the movie does bring to mind Asian horror remakes likeThe Grudgeand it might be the reason why so many have judged this movie harshly.  Despite the similarities with other movies, this one still is very well executed.  It was definitely entertaining and it was fun to figure out the riddles behind what was going on.

Yes the acting is pretty good, the directing and cinematography are great, but the continuity of things in the story being provided for us, fails to make its mark.Ok, so our girl Mi-Ju, a cello instructor, is being haunted by the spirit of her dead friend, who comes back as the typical angry asian spirit, black hair-pasty-faced and pissed off.  Now every one in her house is in danger of being done in by the ghost.  Some of this movie is straight forward, some of it feels like an out of place dream sequence.the film even throws the red herring at you in the form of one of her students threatening her. Either by her hands of the spirit, Mi-Ju's whole family ends up buying the farm, or did they? By the end of the movie I'm thinking was the whole thing a premonition in the form of a dream?  I don't know.This film was ok, it dragged a bit here and there.On the back of the DVD case it reads in quotation marks..""Chilling...and Bloody!"" next to the brief story synopsis.  Cello had a couple of chilling parts, but bloody? Not even close.  The picture on the front of the case, if one were to just glance at it, is misleading. Bottom Line....Yawn!

It's not one of the best Asian horror flicks I've ever seen, but it's far from the worst; there is, however, not terribly much to make it stand out from the pack. That said, it reminded me in many, many ways of Twisted, an execrable Jay Lowi film (if you haven't seen it, don't waste your time), except that Cello was everything Twisted couldn't figure out how to be--atmospheric, suspenseful, mysterious. Which leads to a dilemma: rate the film in comparison to other Asian films (in which case it's mediocre), or in comparison to the closest thing we have to it in America (in which case it's brilliant)? Eh, well, I'll decide that eventually.After a car accident that kills her best friend and causes her a hand injury, Mi-jou (Woman Is the Future of Man's Hyeon-a Seong), a promising young cellist, becomes a professor at a nearby school. Some years later, married and with a family, seemingly unrelated events set Mi-jou down the path of remembering the circumstances (which she's blocked from her mind) surrounding the accident: her autistic daughter wants to learn to play the cello, a student at school to whom she gave a bad grade vows revenge, she receives a rare album for her birthday, a handful more. As she gets closer to the truth of the accident, she begins to question her own sanity.It's not a terribly original plot, and it's not handled in any terribly original way. Still, that doesn't mean it's not worth a couple of hours of your time. The soundtrack (which is, of course, mostly cello) is wonderful, the acting is above average, and if the ending doesn't come as a terrible shock, it's probably because you've seen Twisted.

She now works only as an instructor, and after an unpleasant encounter with a former student, bizarre things begin to occur in her life.  The family dog behaves oddly and then dies suspiciously, a grisly ""present"" appears in Mi-ju's school locker, and she receives ominous, untraceable messages on her mobile phone.  Her older, developmentally disabled daughter displays a sudden interest in learning to play the cello.The viewer is led to believe a number of things may be happening, from retaliation by the disgruntled student, to possession of the daughter.  Or does it have something to do with the mysterious new housekeeper who has a tragic past of her own?  However, this is one of those movies that doesn't really make sense until the very end.  Red herrings and misdirection are fine, but if not handled well they can seem like a bunch of things are just happening randomly.  Even the cello itself is something of a MacGuffin.  At the end, when the true story comes out and several details shown earlier in the film are given significance, the other elements still felt gratuitous.It's not a bad film, and I give it extra credit for being willing to kill off two small children (one of them in a fairly bloody manner.)
