Great interview segments though, and the video footage is definitely rare and precious for fans of the Yardbirds, Clapton, Beck and Page. My only real gripe is that the running time is only HALF of what it claims (1 hr. 45 min.). After the show is over, it just repeats itself! What a dirty trick...of course, it's no big deal since the video is so cheap. I would have bought it even if they had listed the running time accurately as 52 minutes. Maybe it's just an honest error, but they should fix that so that there are no unpleasant surprises.",3,"Great viewing, but the running time is WRONG.",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,681,"['content', 'program', 'great', 'just', 'what', 'hoped', 'far', 'aside', 'fact', 'performance', 'clips', 'were', 'short', 'truncated', 'Great', 'interview', 'segments', 'video', 'footage', 'definitely', 'rare', 'precious', 'fans', 'Yardbirds', 'Clapton', 'Beck', 'Page', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'running', 'time', 'only', 'HALF', 'what', '1', 'hr', '45', 'min.', 'show', 'just', 'What', 'dirty', 'trick', 'course', 'big', 'deal', 'video', 'so', 'cheap', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'even', 'had', 'listed', 'running', 'time', 'accurately', '52', 'minutes', 'Maybe', 'just', 'honest', 'error', 'should', 'fix', 'so', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'surprises']",N/A
1180325,AEKWRBJ9GGHFV,B001DGFGRC,Barry,"[0, 0]","Much of this DVD is documentary interviews that were fairly interesting. I found Jeff Beck's interviews to be the most interesting because they were extremely frank and uncensored.Many of the performances on this DVD are frustratingly incomplete. SOME of the Video Quality is really poor. The clips from US television are all lip sync, unexciting and disappointing. The more complete genuinely live perfomances from NME Poll Winner concert and the Richmond (UK) Blues Festival with Jeff Beck are very rewarding. The sound quality is not great as can only be expected due to their age and crude recording techniques.The late Keith Relf comes off better than I expected. His showmanship was well highlighted in the DVD.The Bonus Track from German TV 1967 (Beat,Beat,Beat) with Jimmy Page is  a real MONSTER. The audio recording is clean and undistorted. The Black and White Video is clean also. The engineers on this recording did an excellent job for the times. The camera work is good. You can really see Jimmy Page working hard. All the songs on the Bonus Track are among the very best of The Yardbirds repertoire. There is an extended version of I'm a Man as it was performed live when I saw The Yardbirds in 1968. Keith Relf puts on a good show here as well. You won't be disappointed by the Bonus Track, which is worth the price of the DVD itself.",5,Killer rare clips and Interviews,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1351,"['Much', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'were', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'found', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'interviews', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'were', 'extremely', 'frank', 'uncensored.Many', 'performances', 'DVD', 'are', 'frustratingly', 'incomplete', 'SOME', 'Video', 'Quality', 'really', 'poor', 'clips', 'US', 'television', 'are', 'lip', 'sync', 'unexciting', 'disappointing', 'more', 'complete', 'genuinely', 'live', 'perfomances', 'NME', 'Poll', 'Winner', 'concert', 'Richmond', 'UK', 'Blues', 'Festival', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'are', 'very', 'rewarding', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'due', 'age', 'crude', 'recording', 'techniques.The', 'late', 'Keith', 'Relf', 'off', 'better', 'expected', 'showmanship', 'was', 'well', 'highlighted', 'DVD.The', 'Bonus', 'Track', 'German', 'TV', '1967', 'Beat', 'Beat', 'Beat', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'real', 'MONSTER', 'audio', 'recording', 'clean', 'undistorted', 'Black', 'White', 'Video', 'clean', 'also', 'engineers', 'recording', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'times', 'camera', 'work', 'good', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'working', 'hard', 'songs', 'Bonus', 'Track', 'are', 'very', 'best', 'Yardbirds', 'repertoire', 'extended', 'version', ""'m"", 'Man', 'was', 'performed', 'live', 'when', 'saw', 'Yardbirds', '1968', 'Keith', 'Relf', 'good', 'show', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Bonus', 'Track', 'price', 'DVD']",N/A

There will be those who say it is not enough and/or incomplete, points to which I will not disagree, but for what there is, I'm grateful as there is little else to view with fair amount of film and photos to aid in fleshing-out this doc.  This outing adds some surviving members of the band who gave interviews (not sure if  exclusive to this doc or archival), like Jeff Beck (candid about his time and leaving the band) seemed relaxed and shared.

Of all the interviewees I really enjoyed his down to earth commentary best--especially on the pretentious Antonioni and his silly film Blow -Up.This 51 minute documentary covers the Yardbirds from their inception in 1963-to 68 and focuses on its incredible guitar players. It's a bit short on the Clapton era [ but then he's gotten so much coverage elsewhere], has rare and wonderful though abbreviated clips of Jeff Beck, a few of the dueling guitar period with Jimmy Page and then goes on to the Page era- with its mind blowing bowing.Interviews include  Beck, Clapton, Dreja, Samwell-Smith, Mccarty and manager Giorgio Gomelski [ don't you just love that name?!]; and it was amazing to get their insights into each other and into this seminal and highly influential band.

1180333,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B001DGFGRC,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[30, 32]","This DVD on the HiQ label is a quirky release. It's a UK produced DVD distributed by Voiceprint - which has been releasing the Tony Palmer films in the US this year.  The DVD feature is a reissue of a 1992 Documentary on the Yardbirds produced by Delilah productions for Atlantic Records and released on VHS in 1993 by Warner Strategic Marketing  (It still has the copyright notice at the end). The 53-minute film features new interviews (at the time it was produced) with all the then living members. Vocalist and harmonica player Keith Reif died in the 1970s. The story of the short span of five years that the band was together is laid out with interviews combined with rare archival footage of performances in the US (Hullabaloo), French and Belgian TV and the BBC. There are many full numbers (though I wish they had indexed these as separate chapters for repeated viewing). The interviews are insightful, particularly the comments from Jeff Beck.There is also a ""Bonus Feature"" which consists of a FABULOUS performance of four numbers from the German TV show ""Beat Beat Beat"" from 1967, with a seven-minute version of ""I'm A Man"" that's worth the price of the DVD alone. (There are more ""Beat Beat Beat"" shows coming early next year from HiQ and I, for one, am excited to see these. The crisp print and great camera close-ups are perfect.The DVD comes with a booklet of, supposedly, liner note but most of the 20-page booklet is devoted to an essay and liner notes for a new Yardbirds album ""Birdland"" recorded in 2003v with new members. These notes have nothing at all to do with the story here.I would give this DVD five stars for what's on the disc - but dropped a star because of this strange packaging, which makes no sense.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Superb Documentary on the Band that brought us Clapton, Beck and Page!",1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1768,"['DVD', 'HiQ', 'label', 'quirky', 'release', 'UK', 'produced', 'DVD', 'distributed', 'Voiceprint', 'been', 'releasing', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'films', 'US', 'year', 'DVD', 'feature', 'reissue', '1992', 'Documentary', 'Yardbirds', 'produced', 'Delilah', 'productions', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'released', 'VHS', '1993', 'Warner', 'Strategic', 'Marketing', 'still', 'copyright', 'notice', 'end', '53-minute', 'film', 'features', 'new', 'interviews', 'time', 'was', 'produced', 'then', 'living', 'members', 'Vocalist', 'harmonica', 'player', 'Keith', 'Reif', 'died', '1970s', 'story', 'short', 'span', 'five', 'years', 'band', 'was', 'together', 'laid', 'out', 'interviews', 'combined', 'rare', 'archival', 'footage', 'performances', 'US', 'Hullabaloo', 'French', 'Belgian', 'TV', 'BBC', 'are', 'many', 'full', 'numbers', 'wish', 'had', 'indexed', 'separate', 'chapters', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'interviews', 'are', 'insightful', 'particularly', 'comments', 'Jeff', 'Beck.There', 'also', 'Bonus', 'Feature', 'FABULOUS', 'performance', 'four', 'numbers', 'German', 'TV', 'show', 'Beat', 'Beat', 'Beat', '1967', 'seven-minute', 'version', ""'m"", 'Man', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'are', 'more', 'Beat', 'Beat', 'Beat', 'coming', 'early', 'next', 'year', 'HiQ', 'one', 'am', 'excited', 'see', 'crisp', 'print', 'great', 'camera', 'close-ups', 'are', 'perfect.The', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'supposedly', 'liner', 'note', 'most', '20-page', 'booklet', 'devoted', 'essay', 'liner', 'notes', 'new', 'Yardbirds', 'album', 'Birdland', 'recorded', '2003v', 'new', 'members', 'notes', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'here.I', 'would', 'give', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'what', 'disc', 'dropped', 'star', 'strange', 'packaging', 'sense.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
