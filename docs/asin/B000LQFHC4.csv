1040153,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B000LQFHC4,Captain Insanity,"[8, 12]","*** For Those New to the Series ***Simulated Snuff.Torture Porn.Gorno.Call it whatever you want,it still won't change the effect this sequel will have on your soul.You'll definitely need to follow this flick up with about 5 hours of Telecare. (Religious Television Station)Because quite honestly, if this is the last movie you see before you die, you're seriously going to burn in hell.There is no story to speak of, no plot, no character development.It's just 3 psychopaths, their unsteady camera, and depravity after depravity.Each one more jaw-dropping than the last.Don't worry I won't ruin it for ya.(I'll list them in the comments section for any who want to know the skinny)Make no mistake,this is a shaky home-video from a maniacs personal library,And it's just a glance into their fun-loving, over-zealous world of madness.*** Synopsis ***3 Psychopaths went out ot play,Went on a killing spree one day,They had such enormous fun,that they called for another psychopath to come.*** For the Seasoned Gorehound ****Personally I thought it would be quite a task to top the insanity of the first August Underground flick,(That's right this is a sequel)which was essentially a one man show accompanied by a cacophony of giggles from behind the lens.But Fred Vogel takes a back seat this time around to the new Captain Giggles, and his ballistic sister, who really outdo themselves putting on a horrific show.Suprisingly though, the lack of Vogel was ultimatlely disheartening.I kinda grew accustomed to his explosive threats, and his Teddy-Bear demeanor after the first flick.Everybody in this movie was amazingly convincing to say the least,especially for an independent film.Excellent performances all around.Specifically the victims.Some of them put on the most believable performances I have ever seen.Everybody involved should be proud of themselves,everybody that is.......except Killjoy.He was just downright awful!!I have never been so acutely aware that I was watching a movie in my entire life,The minute this cat opened his mouth, the illusion of realism was shattered.His performance completely takes you out of the moment.His character was trite, unnecessary, and seemed rather tacked on to the overall movie.Regardless,The effects are phenominal this time around,even better than the last time.And the gore ......well when it rains it pours.ONLY FOR FANS OF THE EXTREME!!!MORAL OF THE STORY:Happiness is a cold, dead corpse.",5,"Easily the Most  Mindlessly Depraved, Sequel in the Annals of American Horror",1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,2441,"['***', 'New', 'Series', '***Simulated', 'Snuff.Torture', 'Porn.Gorno.Call', 'want', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'effect', 'sequel', 'will', 'have', 'soul.You', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'need', 'follow', 'flick', 'up', 'about', '5', 'hours', 'Telecare', 'Religious', 'Television', 'Station', 'quite', 'honestly', 'last', 'movie', 'see', 'die', ""'re"", 'seriously', 'going', 'burn', 'hell.There', 'story', 'speak', 'plot', 'character', 'development.It', 'just', '3', 'psychopaths', 'unsteady', 'camera', 'depravity', 'depravity.Each', 'one', 'more', 'jaw-dropping', 'last.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'ya', ""'ll"", 'list', 'comments', 'section', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'skinny', 'Make', 'mistake', 'shaky', 'home-video', 'maniacs', 'personal', 'library', 'just', 'glance', 'fun-loving', 'over-zealous', 'world', 'madness', '***', 'Synopsis', '***3', 'Psychopaths', 'went', 'out', 'ot', 'play', 'Went', 'killing', 'spree', 'one', 'day', 'had', 'such', 'enormous', 'fun', 'called', 'psychopath', 'come', '***', 'Seasoned', 'Gorehound', '****Personally', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'task', 'top', 'insanity', 'first', 'August', 'Underground', 'flick', 'right', 'sequel', 'was', 'essentially', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'accompanied', 'cacophony', 'giggles', 'lens.But', 'Fred', 'Vogel', 'back', 'seat', 'time', 'new', 'Captain', 'Giggles', 'ballistic', 'sister', 'who', 'really', 'outdo', 'putting', 'horrific', 'show.Suprisingly', 'lack', 'Vogel', 'was', 'ultimatlely', 'disheartening.I', 'kinda', 'grew', 'accustomed', 'explosive', 'threats', 'Teddy-Bear', 'demeanor', 'first', 'flick.Everybody', 'movie', 'was', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'say', 'least', 'especially', 'independent', 'film.Excellent', 'performances', 'around.Specifically', 'victims.Some', 'put', 'most', 'believable', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Everybody', 'involved', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'everybody', 'Killjoy.He', 'was', 'just', 'downright', 'awful', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'acutely', 'aware', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'entire', 'life', 'minute', 'cat', 'opened', 'mouth', 'illusion', 'realism', 'was', 'shattered.His', 'performance', 'completely', 'moment.His', 'character', 'was', 'trite', 'unnecessary', 'seemed', 'rather', 'tacked', 'overall', 'movie.Regardless', 'effects', 'are', 'phenominal', 'time', 'even', 'better', 'last', 'time.And', 'gore', 'well', 'when', 'FOR', 'FANS', 'THE', 'EXTREME', 'MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Happiness', 'cold', 'dead', 'corpse']",Mordum DVD From August Underground

1040157,A2ZRV40FWALSQB,B000LQFHC4,"Richard Nervous ""Dedicated Horror Fan""","[1, 3]","Well I saw this after watching Penance and the first August Underground.This is one sick masterpiece.  It takes the first movie and literally makes it look like Rebecca at Sunnybrook Farm, ok, not really, but there was a farm used in the first film.  If you thought August Underground was sick and depraved that was only a primer for this one.  This time we have 2 new characters added into the mix, Crusty (the vomiting superwoman) and Killjoy.  Some reviewers have said that they really didn't like Killjoy but he has some of the sickest scenes in the whole series.Fred is not in this one as much but he has a couple of cameo's, he's the director/writer/star of the first August Underground for those not initiated into the August Underground series.  It helped to add to the proceedings when he was on camera but what is shown on camera is one completely bone jarring flick.  My girlfriend who has watched the other 2 started to gag at some of the scenes that are shown here.  She didn't have that same reaction to the other movies in the series.I think this film really is by far the sickest of the entire series.  There is not really a lot I want to say about what is seen because I don't want to give it away, you just need to see it if you are into seeing what real horror would look like.  It's shot very roughly to give you that reality element and it really works.This is not a series for those that have weak stomachs and even if you got through August Underground, this one will have your jaw hanging open.  Great stuff and it's too bad that Fred is done with this series but I honestly don't see where else it can go.  If you haven't seen this I think it's worth a look but prepare yourself for just outright slaughter.  It does what it sets out to do, disgust, sicken and make you think, could there really be people out there that could do this?  That's why I say it's what real horror looks like, not because it's real but because it really could be and that's the scariest thing about a flick like this.  You know somewhere in the world someone might be at this right now. Wow!

This movie is just too sick to sit and watch by yourself. But as a group activity its fun to watch everybody squirm in their seats at the carnage that is displayed before them. IGN has rated this as the most disturbing movie ever made - and that's no wild boast as this film delivers more than what you would expect of it. I wouldn't even say this movie is for serious gorehounds (even though there is plenty of that). This is a movie for those who can handle going to the ugliest places of the deranged human mind.
