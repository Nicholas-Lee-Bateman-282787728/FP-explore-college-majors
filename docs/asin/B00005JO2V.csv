That's why this season is so good - because it is about the Winslows. Even if there was not an Urkell, the show still would have worked on it's own. I'm not saying that I don't like the following seasons, I do. I remember watching the original episodes as a kid during it's first run with Urkell in them. Only in syndication did I see these episodes from the first season, and I enjoyed the first season as much as the following four seasons. After the 5th season, the show fell flat though. I am as annoyed as everyone else about the box cover showing Steve in front and the family in the back. Even for the following seasons, that wouldn't be right. It should have all of them in a picture together. Steve shouldn't be pictured on the box at all because he wasn't a major part of these episodes. The second season should rightfully have the whole family plus Steve together on the cover. But of course, WB wants to sell it. At least they put it out, and I hope they continue because WB has never released the second seasons to Murphy Brown or Madtv.",5,A great debut season to the show that made TGIF on abc in the early 90's,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,1123,"['Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'Steve', 'Urkell', ""n't"", 'star', 'why', 'season', 'so', 'good', 'Winslows', 'Even', 'was', 'not', 'Urkell', 'show', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'own', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'following', 'seasons', 'do', 'remember', 'watching', 'original', 'episodes', 'kid', 'first', 'run', 'Urkell', 'Only', 'syndication', 'did', 'see', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'following', 'four', 'seasons', '5th', 'season', 'show', 'fell', 'flat', 'am', 'as', 'annoyed', 'everyone', 'else', 'box', 'cover', 'showing', 'Steve', 'front', 'family', 'back', 'Even', 'following', 'seasons', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'should', 'have', 'picture', 'together', 'Steve', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'pictured', 'box', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'part', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'should', 'rightfully', 'have', 'whole', 'family', 'Steve', 'together', 'cover', 'course', 'WB', 'sell', 'least', 'put', 'out', 'hope', 'continue', 'WB', 'never', 'released', 'second', 'seasons', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'Madtv']",Family Matters:S1 (DVD)

The first season was much more down to earth, with Urkel not debuting till the 4th episode and keeping a relatively minor role for most of the season.  The focus here was on the family, a sort of working class version of the Cosby Show, but with that trademark Miller-Boyett Style.  Looking back at it, it actually holds up quite well, and Reginald VelJohnson is truly a warm and wonderful star who anchors the show and is the clear standout.  Of course, sometimes ratings are low for shows like these and a certain popular character tends to take over, which is exactly what happened after this season.  This is fine, as Urkel is extremely funny and well played by Jaleel White, and he certainly deserved to become the focal point of attention.

Later seasons he would be a regular, but season 1 he just recurring, like Rodney. Steve Urkel wasn't on until the 12th episode except one episode where he was on before opening credit, but no more that episode. He should not have been given star treatment on the Season 1 set.  The first Season mainly revolved around the Winslow family. The first seasonartwork should have revolved around the Winslow family. This ismisleading. It leads people to believe he was more than he was. Steve Urkel is all over the artwork on everything. The first disk had his face on it, but he wasn't on those episodes except for the one episode where he was on before opening credits. I think the artwork should have featured the Winslow family only. The disks should have had: Disk one; Carl and Harriet, Disk two: Eddie, Laura, and Judy, Disk three: Momma Winslow, Rachel, and Little Richie.

639104,A1ZI5JS3YJM988,B00005JO2V,Conner Kent,"[0, 0]","Like most of the rest of the world, I didn't discover Family Matters until the second season, when Urkel had already started his takeover of the series. I was totally unfamiliar with Season One and it's very interesting to see compared to what came later.For starters... although the show is somewhat generic, usual fare for what one would expect from a Miller-Boyett production of that day and age, there's a lot more heart to it. Thankfully Reginald VelJohnson, Jo-Marie Payton-France (what's with all these long names?), Telma Hopkins, and Rosetta LeNoire carry the show because the acting from the children aside from maybe Eddie is horrendous. I'm sure they got better with time, because I don't remember them being so bad later.Despite that criticism, I really like it. Get it when it's on sale like I did, and go back to a time when sitcoms were simpler but not fluff.Sadly, there are no extras... I'd actually be curious if Carl Winslow ever showed up on Perfect Strangers to visit his wife... and the original Season 1 theme song, which was Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World,"" has been replaced with the traditional Family Matters theme. That's one change that doesn't bother me too much - at least it's not as blatantly obvious as the later Happy Days theme replacing ""Rock Around The Clock"" for the Happy Days Season 2 set.I'm also sad that, so far, no more Family Matters seasons have been released on DVD.

The cast was great, the plots wonderful. Each episode always had something that everyone could relate to or empathize with, and that was part of the reason it was so great. The other reason was the family interaction - it was great to have a good, wholesome family show because that's what kids & parents alike wanted and needed when this show was on.From the characters Steve Urkel and Laura Winslow, the non-existant romance was entertaining and amusing. The daily problems Carl Winslow faced as a police officer were great. I still remember one episode, though I'm not sure it was in the first season, where Carl was having serious guilt issues because of an incident where a guy got killed and Carl blamed himself.Then, the school drama of the kids was great. From middle school to high school, the problems were real. Graffiti, bullies, grades, friends, it had it all. One episode even touched on bullies using/displaying deadly force, which promoted a drive by the Winslow family to do a ""marathon"" type event where people could turn in their weapons, no questions asked, to get their lives back.After watching all the seasons, I honestly have nothing bad to say about the show.",5,Amazing,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,1281,"['watched', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'airing', 'was', 'amazing', 'show', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'plots', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'always', 'had', 'something', 'everyone', 'could', 'relate', 'empathize', 'was', 'part', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'other', 'reason', 'was', 'family', 'interaction', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'good', 'wholesome', 'family', 'show', 'what', 'parents', 'alike', 'wanted', 'needed', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Urkel', 'Laura', 'Winslow', 'non-existant', 'romance', 'was', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'daily', 'problems', 'Carl', 'Winslow', 'faced', 'police', 'officer', 'were', 'great', 'still', 'remember', 'one', 'episode', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'Carl', 'was', 'having', 'serious', 'guilt', 'issues', 'incident', 'where', 'guy', 'got', 'killed', 'Carl', 'blamed', 'himself.Then', 'school', 'drama', 'kids', 'was', 'great', 'middle', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'problems', 'were', 'real', 'Graffiti', 'bullies', 'grades', 'friends', 'had', 'One', 'episode', 'even', 'touched', 'bullies', 'using/displaying', 'deadly', 'force', 'promoted', 'drive', 'Winslow', 'family', 'do', 'marathon', 'type', 'event', 'where', 'people', 'could', 'turn', 'weapons', 'questions', 'asked', 'get', 'lives', 'back.After', 'watching', 'seasons', 'honestly', 'have', 'nothing', 'bad', 'say', 'show']",Family Matters:S1 (DVD)

Living with the Winslows, is Harriette's sister & Carl's sister-in-law Rachel, who has a son from a previous marriage named Richie (played by twins Joseph & Julius Wright [Season One only]). In ""The Mama Who Came To Dinner"", Mother Estelle Winslow comes to live with the family, despite Carl's objections.

Carl purchases a vintage police car in ""Body Damage"" - where Rachel decides to take a spin in the jalopy with disastrous results!. Carl dreams of son Eddie making it big in ""Basketball Blues"" - where Carl asks a former pro ball player to talk to Eddie about sticking with basketball. The Winslows catch a glimpse of their favorite TV idol in ""False Arrest"" - where Carl has an unfortunate run-in with Buddy Goodrich (played by guest-star Ron Glass). Eddie is excited when he brings home a perfect report card in ""Straight As"", only to find his friend Rodney (played by Randy Josselyn [Seasons One & Two]) has doctored it up.

The wind blows in just the right creator, just the right performers and the kind of writing that extends beyond the domestic audience into something universal that can be enjoyed at many levels by many kinds of people. Family Matters has the kind of classic formula that made The Three Stooges, The Munsters and Seinfeld great in and beyond their time, and features the kind of endearing personalities that transcend the usual American barriers of color.Though going from top billing to next in line after unexpected bombshell Jaleel White hit the show could not have been easy for the rest of the crew, all the support they gave him for as long as they could endeared each of their characters to the viewers even more.  The show does suffer from some errors in continuity and inconsistencies / exaggerations, many most probably stemming from network pressure to ride the Urkel wave at the expense of all else.

Though comparable to 'Full House', it was NOT a rip-off. Instead of an uncle/brother-in-law and a male family friend, the plus-two in the Winslow family is a widowed aunt and her baby son, and Carl's mother (and grandmother to the Winslow children), and Carl is not a widower, his wife still very much around. The gender of the children were also mixed instead of being three girls like in Full House. We had Carl's three children, Eddie, Laura, and Judy, and Rachel's baby boy (who would grow though the series to become a character of his own)In some ways, I liked this show better than Full House.

How many days have gone by while fans eagerly waited for the release of this classic family sitcom on DVD?! Now fans who have waited patiently, like myself and my friends, will be able to own the complete first season of the Winslow's and their quirky neighbor Steve Urkle in Family Matters. The 3-disc set will contain the following 22 episodes originally airing from 1989-1990:The Mama Who Came To DinnerTwo-Income FamilyShort StoryRachel's First DateStraight A'sBaseball BluesBody DamageMr. BadwrenchStake-OutFalse ArrestThe QuiltLaura's First Date (Steve Urkle's Proper Introduction!!!)Man's Best FriendBaker's DozenThe Big ReunionThe PartyThe Big FixSitting PrettyIn A JamThe CandidateBowl Me OverRock VideoNo news yet on any special features and some are wary of expecting any but just being able to own these episodes on a proper set should be more than enough to please fans. Though, any exec's out there with a say in the matter should be aware of how much us fans who have waited so long would appreciate a little something extra, a blooper reel would be great, even some sort of featurette or promotional material if not a commentary or two, just throwing that out there.Anybody growing up or alive in the 90's knows the name Steve Urkle. Urkle became a household name and now fans can revisit, and newcomer's can finally be introduced to, the man who did do that. Though Steve Urkle easily became a star the show wasn't only great because of him, (in fact Urkle wasn't written in until the 12th episode but became so popular they made him a regular and fit him into some earlier episodes not yet aired), but it was also great because of Carl, Harriette, Laura, Eddie and the entire Winslow family and how audiences related to them and the issues they dealt with, which is an even rarer thing this day and age. I still remember the way Carl would drag out ""Harr-i-ette"" or how Steve would be told ""go home Steve"" only to then respond ""I don't have to take this, I'm going home."" This show is classic American sticom at it's finest and they just can't make them like this anymore. I don't know if it's because the world has changed or if they just don't know how to capture the innocence, comedy and family values the way sitcoms once used to. This show in particular had great stories that at their core taught us family does matter and it still does just as much if not more so today.2010 is a great year for the 'Most Wanted TV Series on DVD' crowd, shows like Daria and Family Matters that fans have waited for patiently for so many years are finally getting released. It looks like all the online petitions and fans showing desire to purchase these great series has finally paid off. I have to give this show 5 stars and don't see any reason that this set won't deserve five stars, especially for fans who have waited so long for this ""most wanted on DVD"" series.

It focuses on the Winslows, a multi-generational, middle-class, suburban Chicago family.The show takes a closer look at the at-home adventures of Harriette Winslow (JoMarie Payton-France), the sarcastic elevator operator who was initially featured on ""Perfect Strangers.""  Also featured in the series are Harriette's husband Carl (Reginald VelJohnson), a Chicago police sergeant, and their three kids: rebellious son Eddie (Darius McCrary), intelligent daughter Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams), and youngest kid Judy (Jaimee Foxworth/Valerie Jones).  Other regulars include Carl's streetwise mom (Rosetta LeNoire) and Harriette's sister Rachel (Telma Hopkins).During the first season, the Winslows are introduced to the show's scene-stealing breakout star, geeky next-door neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White).  Urkel, the ultimate nerd, develops a big crush on Laura.  With his oversized glasses, high-waisted pants, suspenders, and high-pitched, squeaky voice, Urkel is a living, breathing sight gag.The three-disc set contains 22 episodes.",3,Urkel Steals the Show,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,1169,"['Family', 'Matters', 'First', 'Season', 'new', 'box', 'set', 'devoted', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'aired', 'originally', '1989', '1998', 'Winslows', 'multi-generational', 'middle-class', 'suburban', 'Chicago', 'family.The', 'show', 'closer', 'look', 'at-home', 'adventures', 'Harriette', 'Winslow', 'JoMarie', 'Payton-France', 'sarcastic', 'elevator', 'operator', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'featured', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'Also', 'featured', 'series', 'are', 'Harriette', 'husband', 'Carl', 'Reginald', 'VelJohnson', 'Chicago', 'police', 'sergeant', 'three', 'kids', 'rebellious', 'son', 'Eddie', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'intelligent', 'daughter', 'Laura', 'Kellie', 'Shanygne', 'Williams', 'youngest', 'kid', 'Judy', 'Jaimee', 'Foxworth/Valerie', 'Jones', 'Other', 'regulars', 'include', 'Carl', 'streetwise', 'mom', 'Rosetta', 'LeNoire', 'Harriette', 'sister', 'Rachel', 'Telma', 'Hopkins', '.During', 'first', 'season', 'Winslows', 'are', 'introduced', 'show', 'scene-stealing', 'breakout', 'star', 'geeky', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Steve', 'Urkel', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'Urkel', 'ultimate', 'nerd', 'big', 'crush', 'Laura', 'oversized', 'glasses', 'high-waisted', 'pants', 'suspenders', 'high-pitched', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'Urkel', 'living', 'breathing', 'sight', 'gag.The', 'three-disc', 'set', '22', 'episodes']",Family Matters:S1 (DVD)
