1546017,A22CJPTFPQAWEJ,B0084CAU10,"Brooklyn Phantom ""Brooklyn Phantom""","[0, 0]",This was a good film about a player who had to learn to love and respect women. Keith Robinson played his role well. I didn't like his character but I understood his actions. I really felt for some characters and strongly disliked others. This film had my attention from start to finish. Lynn Whitfield was excellent in a small cameo.Everyone in this film plays their part well. I don't know why there was a laugh track. It was distracting. This film would be rated PG-13 because of the adult themes. No profanity or nudity.

I just wish that our sisters would wake up and not have sex until you are married to him. The other sister got mad because he did not want to commit himself to her. Hello!!! Don't ever give yourself to a man unto he is your husband. If it doesn't work out after awhile, at least you can say that you have done it the right way in God's eyes. Pray about him first my sister. He might not be the one for you. Don't settle! God wants the best for you! I am tired of my sisters getting abused and abusing themselves, all because they have failed to learn about God's Grace. Pray for strength against temptation, and he will give you the strength. I didn't like the fact that he wouldn't give his mother a chance to tell him exactly what had happened to her from her husband. It's a shame when we hate the person instead of the devil that is behind it all. If you know someone that has this dvd, you might want to ask them to watch it first before you buy it.",3,Redemption?

But then, he meets a woman different than all the rest.It wasn't the title that got my attention. Redemption of a Dog? If I hadn't noticed Tamera Mowry-Housley on the poster and Lynn Whitfield's name, I wouldn't have been interested in watching this stage play. That's not to say Keith Robinson isn't a good actor. He is. I've seen some of his other performances and he did a fine job with this role.The reason for Will's redemption was not what I expected. There is a serious issue being dealt with - took me totally by surprise and grabbed my attention just when I was thinking about pressing stop on my remote. Some of the performances touched me and quite a bit of the dialogue had me nodding my head in agreement.Redemption of a Dog is a ""dramedy"" worth watching.",3,Good Dialogue,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,833,"['Will', 'Austin', 'Keith', 'Robinson', 'not', 'interested', 'settling', 'down', 'then', 'woman', 'different', 'rest.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'title', 'got', 'attention', 'Redemption', 'Dog', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'Tamera', 'Mowry-Housley', 'poster', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'name', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'watching', 'stage', 'play', 'not', 'say', 'Keith', 'Robinson', ""n't"", 'good', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'performances', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'role.The', 'reason', 'Will', 'redemption', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'serious', 'issue', 'being', 'dealt', 'took', 'totally', 'surprise', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'thinking', 'pressing', 'stop', 'remote', 'performances', 'touched', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'had', 'nodding', 'head', 'agreement.Redemption', 'Dog', 'dramedy', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I went with 4 stars because it is better than okay and I did like the movie when all was said and done. The characters definitely pull you in! I couldn't stand Willard and I was wondering why in the world an educated woman like Dagney would even stay with him. His character was questionable and scary. However, the scene (unfortunately at the end of the play/movie) between Willard and his mom brought everything together and made Willard much more understandable. I would watch the movie again, so I can give it 4 stars after all.",4,3.5 or 4 stars?,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,651,"['agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'beginning', 'out', 'slow', 'stick', 'play/movie', 'better', 'went', '4', 'stars', 'better', 'okay', 'did', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'characters', 'definitely', 'pull', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Willard', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'world', 'educated', 'woman', 'Dagney', 'would', 'even', 'stay', 'character', 'was', 'questionable', 'scary', 'However', 'scene', 'unfortunately', 'end', 'play/movie', 'Willard', 'mom', 'brought', 'everything', 'together', 'made', 'Willard', 'much', 'more', 'understandable', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'can', 'give', '4', 'stars']",N/A
