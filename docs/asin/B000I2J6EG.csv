Also, I'd always heard that the tapes from the New York years were lost, but evidently (much to my delight), not ALL of them were.Having said that, I must point out that this collection is somewhat choppy, and includes some moments which aren't Soupy's best. There are some overly long sketches, although it is a treat to actually SEE more of Frank Nastasi than I recall from the 60's. And there are a number of good features: interaction with the ""man at the door"", rockin' out with Pookie, a few scenes with White Fang, and tuning in the radio for the weather report. I did long to see/hear other things that are missing altogether: ""Reba"" & her husband in the stove, Peaches, the ""Words of Wisdom"". Also; surprisingly for a man who claims to have been hit by 19,000 of them, there aren't that many ""pies"" in this collection.The information regarding this DVD is sketchy and confusing, so let me attempt to clarify a few things: these clips (most of them) are from Soupy's NY days in the mid 60's. The references posted regarding ""Lunch with Soupy Sales"" and ""Saturday mornings"" I believe refer to prior years, when Soupy was based in Detroit, and wore a black top hat along with his floppy bow tie. Those shows are not in evidence on this DVD.But in conclusion - whatever the time frame, and however good/bad the features, Soupy Sales always leaves me wanting more.",5,A True Icon of the Sixties,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,1515,"['Soupy', 'Sales', 'was', 'preeminent', 'influence', 'childhood', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'give', 'Living', 'Black', 'White', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'Also', ""'d"", 'always', 'heard', 'tapes', 'New', 'York', 'years', 'were', 'lost', 'evidently', 'much', 'delight', 'not', 'were.Having', 'said', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'collection', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'Soupy', 'best', 'are', 'overly', 'long', 'sketches', 'treat', 'actually', 'SEE', 'more', 'Frank', 'Nastasi', 'recall', '60', 'are', 'number', 'good', 'features', 'interaction', 'man', 'door', 'rockin', 'out', 'Pookie', 'few', 'scenes', 'White', 'Fang', 'tuning', 'radio', 'weather', 'report', 'did', 'long', 'see/hear', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'altogether', 'Reba', 'husband', 'stove', 'Peaches', 'Words', 'Wisdom', 'Also', 'surprisingly', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'hit', '19,000', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'pies', 'collection.The', 'information', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'sketchy', 'confusing', 'so', 'let', 'attempt', 'clarify', 'few', 'things', 'clips', 'most', 'are', 'Soupy', 'NY', 'days', 'mid', '60', 'references', 'posted', 'regarding', 'Lunch', 'Soupy', 'Sales', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'believe', 'refer', 'prior', 'years', 'when', 'Soupy', 'was', 'based', 'Detroit', 'wore', 'black', 'top', 'hat', 'floppy', 'bow', 'tie', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'evidence', 'DVD.But', 'conclusion', 'time', 'frame', 'however', 'good/bad', 'features', 'Soupy', 'Sales', 'always', 'wanting', 'more']",Soupy Sales: In Living Black & White
1018512,A2BLITJITO97N5,B000I2J6EG,Ingalls,"[11, 33]","First the good: Soupy Sales was good in front of the camera. He was relaxed, fun loving, consistently upbeat, and seemed to be having a great time goofing around with the characters on this popular children's show. Now the bad: this show has not aged well. The low resolution black and white looks very crude today. Were these remastered? I think not. The jokes fall flat. The ultra-low budget was apparent throughout. It looks like it was thrown together with a few wooden crates and two hand puppets. It isn't entertaining. It drags on forever. I fast forwarded through most of the episodes. It is that boring.If you had fond memories of this, remember, you were probably age 5 - 12 when you first saw this.
