I've been doing workout videos since high school, plus I do a lot of jogging and walking.Ok, now on to the review: If you want to work out the hardest you've ever worked in your life, this isn't it what you're looking for.  Go check out Jillian Michaels's ""Hard Body"" or Jeanette Jenkins's ""Bikini Bootcamp"" instead.However, if you (like me) already do those workouts and want something different that fulfills the following requirements, then I recommend considering getting the Skinny Bitch DVDs:- Doesn't make you feel like you're going to die, but still burns calories (this and their Body workout burn 400-500 calories each, according to my heart rate monitor).- Offers a variety of moves you haven't seen in other workouts.  You can tell the routines were created by a professional trainer (Patrick Goudeau).  Yeah, both women mess up a couple times, but it's really not as bad as most of the reviews here make it seem.  You always see at least one of the backup fitness models/dancers, so it's pretty easy to follow along with the routine during the few times Kim or Rory mess up a little.- Doesn't trigger your ""exercise ADD"".  Most workout videos spend way too much time on each exercise and I get bored 3 minutes in (Jillian and Jeanette are the exceptions here). The Skinny Bitch workouts flow quickly from move to move, so they stay fun.  To up the burn, I hold 2lb weights during the cardio sequences and switch to 5 or 8lb dumbbells for the toning sequences.- Has choreography that takes a couple times to get.  For the same reason that it's NOT boring, I didn't pick up the entire choreography instantly.At the end of the day, I just enjoy these workouts.  The moves and routines are fun and intelligently put together.  That's all I really care about.  When I feel like the banter is too much, I mute the DVD and put my ipod on instead.Also, I want to respond to the complaint about Kim and Rory introducing themselves in the beginning.  Yes, they should have made it skippable, but c'mon people.  The fast-forward button exists for a reason.  Besides, when I put in my exercise DVDs I'm still pulling on my workout shoes and getting my water bottle, so I always miss the intros anyway.  That one little annoyance has nothing to do with the routines and shouldn't seriously influence how you rate the workouts, IMO.",5,Unpopular Opinion: I Really LIke It!,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2400,"['Just', 'reference', ""'m"", 'mid-20s', '5', '6', '147lbs', 'fairly', 'fit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'workout', 'videos', 'high', 'school', 'do', 'lot', 'jogging', 'walking.Ok', 'now', 'review', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'hardest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'worked', 'life', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Go', 'check', 'out', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Hard', 'Body', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'Bikini', 'Bootcamp', 'instead.However', 'already', 'do', 'workouts', 'want', 'something', 'different', 'following', 'requirements', 'then', 'recommend', 'considering', 'getting', 'Skinny', 'Bitch', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', 'still', 'calories', 'Body', 'burn', '400-500', 'calories', 'according', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', '.-', 'variety', 'moves', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'workouts', 'can', 'tell', 'routines', 'were', 'created', 'professional', 'trainer', 'Patrick', 'Goudeau', 'Yeah', 'women', 'mess', 'up', 'couple', 'times', 'really', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'reviews', 'here', 'make', 'seem', 'always', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'backup', 'fitness', 'models/dancers', 'pretty', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'routine', 'few', 'times', 'Kim', 'Rory', 'mess', 'up', 'little.-', 'Does', ""n't"", 'trigger', 'exercise', 'ADD', 'Most', 'videos', 'spend', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'exercise', 'get', 'bored', '3', 'minutes', 'Jillian', 'Jeanette', 'are', 'exceptions', 'here', 'Skinny', 'Bitch', 'flow', 'quickly', 'move', 'move', 'stay', 'fun', 'burn', 'hold', '2lb', 'weights', 'cardio', 'sequences', 'switch', '5', '8lb', 'dumbbells', 'toning', 'sequences.-', 'Has', 'choreography', 'couple', 'times', 'get', 'same', 'reason', 'NOT', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'entire', 'choreography', 'instantly.At', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'enjoy', 'workouts', 'moves', 'routines', 'are', 'fun', 'intelligently', 'put', 'together', 'really', 'care', 'about', 'When', 'feel', 'banter', 'too', 'much', 'mute', 'DVD', 'put', 'ipod', 'instead.Also', 'want', 'respond', 'complaint', 'Kim', 'Rory', 'introducing', 'beginning', 'Yes', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'skippable', ""c'mon"", 'people', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'reason', 'Besides', 'when', 'put', 'exercise', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'still', 'pulling', 'workout', 'shoes', 'getting', 'water', 'bottle', 'always', 'miss', 'intros', 'anyway', 'one', 'little', 'annoyance', 'nothing', 'do', 'routines', 'should', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'influence', 'how', 'rate', 'workouts', 'IMO']",Skinny Bitch: Boot Camp
1196902,AL8M1UQW6F7OR,B001GJOL5E,"coolgamer ""coolgamer""","[3, 3]","Wow, I must say I am surprised by all these negative reviews! I have been working out tot this dvd for some time now and it is one of the most fun workouts I've done!Kim and Rory are at it again with Bootcamp! Get ready to have your butt-kicked because this is one intense workout. The main workout, bootcamp, is a mixture of fast-paced, non-stop cardio routines with a nice amount of arm work done with weights. Basically you do one set cardio, one set weights, then you rotate again, but each time its something new. This workout is really fun, because obviously its Skinny Bitch, but also because of the fast pace. It keeps you going for about thirty-forty minutes and by the end your butt has been whooped!Some of the exercises include lunges, squats, twists, jumping jacks, and just all around fast-paced movements. It incorporates arms, legs, abs, butt, just everything is being stretched and pulled in this workout! It is so much fun because you really get motivated and you have a fun time with this workout routine. Even though it's tough, I do it over and over whenever I want a good solid workout because it is just so much fun. The soundtrack alone is bouncy and fun to listen to. Of course the girls are cracking their jokes, as well...There is a separate workout routine on the disc called ""five-by-fives"" which is five five-minute workouts, targeting abs, butt, arms, legs, and one yoga routine which is a little longer than five minutes (maybe 10-15 min). These workouts are fun to do by themselves or all together if you are pressed for time. You can literally just do one five minute workout to target a specific area if you don't feel like doing a big workout but want to get something in for the day.One aspect I don't like is how Rory and Kim are always commenting on how ""you shouldn't eat cr*p"" and ""you should change your life."" I don't think they should assume just because it is a dvd that the women using it only eat junk food and never exercised before, because that isn't true. I just found that bit slightly annoying which is why I gave it four stars.But that's no biggie! Overall it is a great, fun, intense workout which WILL get you sweating by the end if you are doing it right and making a real effort. I don't know if some reviewers didn't like it because they didn't get anything out of it, but I will say you probably have to be fit to do this workout. If you are starting unfit, go with their Body dvd. This one may be a little too intense to start with. I highly recommend this workout; have fun with it!",4,"Intense, fun workout!",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,2544,"['Wow', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'surprised', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'tot', 'dvd', 'time', 'now', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Kim', 'Rory', 'are', 'again', 'Bootcamp', 'Get', 'ready', 'have', 'butt-kicked', 'one', 'intense', 'workout', 'main', 'workout', 'bootcamp', 'mixture', 'fast-paced', 'non-stop', 'cardio', 'routines', 'nice', 'amount', 'arm', 'work', 'done', 'weights', 'Basically', 'do', 'one', 'set', 'cardio', 'one', 'set', 'weights', 'then', 'rotate', 'again', 'time', 'something', 'new', 'workout', 'really', 'fun', 'obviously', 'Skinny', 'Bitch', 'also', 'fast', 'pace', 'going', 'thirty-forty', 'minutes', 'end', 'butt', 'been', 'whooped', 'exercises', 'include', 'lunges', 'squats', 'twists', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'just', 'fast-paced', 'movements', 'arms', 'legs', 'abs', 'butt', 'just', 'everything', 'being', 'stretched', 'pulled', 'workout', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'really', 'get', 'motivated', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'workout', 'routine', 'Even', 'tough', 'do', 'whenever', 'want', 'good', 'solid', 'workout', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'soundtrack', 'alone', 'bouncy', 'fun', 'listen', 'course', 'girls', 'are', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'as', 'well', 'separate', 'workout', 'routine', 'disc', 'called', 'five-by-fives', 'five', 'five-minute', 'workouts', 'targeting', 'abs', 'butt', 'arms', 'legs', 'one', 'yoga', 'routine', 'little', 'longer', 'five', 'minutes', 'maybe', '10-15', 'min', 'workouts', 'are', 'fun', 'do', 'together', 'are', 'pressed', 'time', 'can', 'literally', 'just', 'do', 'one', 'five', 'minute', 'workout', 'target', 'specific', 'area', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'big', 'workout', 'want', 'get', 'something', 'day.One', 'aspect', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Rory', 'Kim', 'are', 'always', 'commenting', 'how', 'should', ""n't"", 'eat', 'cr*p', 'should', 'change', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'assume', 'just', 'dvd', 'women', 'using', 'only', 'eat', 'junk', 'food', 'never', 'exercised', 'before', ""n't"", 'true', 'just', 'found', 'bit', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'stars.But', 'biggie', 'Overall', 'great', 'fun', 'intense', 'workout', 'WILL', 'get', 'sweating', 'end', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'making', 'real', 'effort', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'will', 'say', 'probably', 'have', 'be', 'fit', 'do', 'workout', 'are', 'starting', 'unfit', 'go', 'Body', 'dvd', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'intense', 'start', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'have', 'fun']",Skinny Bitch: Boot Camp

1196904,A245HJ999FOPRI,B001GJOL5E,Tchik182,"[3, 4]","I bought this DVD despite the bad reviews because Amazon was selling it for around $6.  I'm glad I didn't spend anymore on this DVD.The DVD has a 5 minute warm up, 25 minutes of cardio (which consists of cardio intervals and strength training), 10 minutes of abs and a 5 minute stretch.  The cardio length is a little short for my taste.The girls chatter NON STOP during the entire DVD and even talk over each other at times.  Sometimes, the chatter was funny, but it gets old really fast.  They mess up quite a bit.  You can tell they're looking at someone off screen to know what to do and Rory even asks several times, ""What's next?"". Neither woman cues AT ALL.  Both of them are looking at someone do the moves off camera and just transition between moves with no warning.  That being said, the moves are very easy and you can catch on quickly, even though there's no cueing.  I did get a decent workout, but I usually did the hardest cardio interval demonstrated for the entire cardio interval.  During the strength training the girls move really quickly.  Both girls say not to swing the weights, but the movements are so fast, you can't have slow and controled movements.  The ab workout was good and had a variety of exercises and advanced and beginner options were shown.With all the bashing out of the way, this DVD wasn't that awful.  If you can find a used copy, or catch an Amazon sale, it's ok.  I'll do this DVD again, but I'm an intermediate to advanced exercisor, so this will be for my easy days. I would recommend this DVD for beginners, except for the fact that there's no cueing.  I think a beginner would be frustrated really quickly.  Whenever moves are demonstrated, the girls do show beginner versions, for people who may not be ready for the more intense exercises.",3,Full of inane chatter and no cueing,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,1791,"['bought', 'DVD', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'was', 'selling', '6', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'anymore', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', '5', 'minute', 'warm', 'up', '25', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'strength', 'training', '10', 'minutes', 'abs', '5', 'minute', 'stretch', 'cardio', 'length', 'little', 'short', 'taste.The', 'girls', 'chatter', 'NON', 'STOP', 'entire', 'DVD', 'even', 'talk', 'other', 'times', 'Sometimes', 'chatter', 'was', 'funny', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'mess', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'can', 'tell', ""'re"", 'looking', 'someone', 'off', 'screen', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Rory', 'even', 'several', 'times', 'What', 'next', 'woman', 'cues', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Both', 'are', 'looking', 'someone', 'do', 'moves', 'camera', 'just', 'transition', 'moves', 'warning', 'being', 'said', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'can', 'catch', 'quickly', 'even', 'cueing', 'did', 'get', 'decent', 'workout', 'usually', 'did', 'hardest', 'cardio', 'interval', 'demonstrated', 'entire', 'cardio', 'interval', 'strength', 'training', 'girls', 'move', 'really', 'quickly', 'girls', 'say', 'not', 'swing', 'weights', 'movements', 'are', 'so', 'fast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'slow', 'controled', 'movements', 'ab', 'workout', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'variety', 'exercises', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'options', 'were', 'shown.With', 'bashing', 'way', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'awful', 'can', 'find', 'used', 'copy', 'catch', 'Amazon', 'sale', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'do', 'DVD', 'again', ""'m"", 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisor', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'days', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'fact', 'cueing', 'think', 'beginner', 'would', 'be', 'frustrated', 'really', 'quickly', 'Whenever', 'moves', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'girls', 'do', 'show', 'beginner', 'versions', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ready', 'more', 'intense', 'exercises']",Skinny Bitch: Boot Camp
