They tried, but oh, how awful and oh how mediocre it was. But Eddie Murphy was worth the price of admission, (Gumby, Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood)and Joe Piscopo was adequate, with moments where he showed that he had some talent.

1123426,A24MFKJNHJDVZF,B000ZOXDFU,Mel Zorro,"[18, 21]","Obviously the 80's were a rough go for the revolving door of writers, directors and cast members of SNL, this restrospective puts that to the forefront, but leaves you feeling a little sad.Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy are credited as saving the show from total obscurity and ridicule, retaining rhe praise of their co-cast members as team players and generally talented people. While Jon Lovitz is shown as the only cast member beloved enough to survive one cast literally going up in flames at the end of a season.The interviews are not complete downers, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is pretty chipper about the experience (obviously she had some success afterwards), Kevin Nealon recalls his time at SNL with great fondness and Victoria Jackson's memories are just fascinating to listen to.The sad part is watching the footage of the sketches, which were just words being thrown into the air and the audience seemingly laughing at the hope of hearing something funny.Also Gilbert Gottfried is terribly glum about the situation, with his basic message being ""this was my chance and they set me up to fail"".There is a light at the end of the tunnel however as 1989 leads into the promise of the 1990's and true comedy to come, but of course we aren't treated to that footage.If you're looking for a perspective from movie star cast members like Robert Downey Jr., Joan Cusack, Anthony Michael-Hall or Eddie Murphy, you won't find it here.But if you want a reason to appreciate the magic of the original cast or the joy that was the 1990's, by seeing just how bad it could be and was, then buy this DVD.",3,The Rejects of SNL,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1594,"['Obviously', '80', 'were', 'rough', 'go', 'revolving', 'door', 'writers', 'directors', 'cast', 'members', 'SNL', 'restrospective', 'forefront', 'feeling', 'little', 'sad.Joe', 'Piscopo', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'are', 'credited', 'saving', 'show', 'total', 'obscurity', 'ridicule', 'retaining', 'rhe', 'praise', 'co-cast', 'members', 'team', 'players', 'generally', 'talented', 'people', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'shown', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'beloved', 'enough', 'survive', 'one', 'cast', 'literally', 'going', 'up', 'flames', 'end', 'season.The', 'interviews', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'downers', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfuss', 'pretty', 'chipper', 'experience', 'obviously', 'had', 'success', 'afterwards', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'time', 'SNL', 'great', 'fondness', 'Victoria', 'Jackson', 'memories', 'are', 'just', 'fascinating', 'listen', 'to.The', 'sad', 'part', 'watching', 'footage', 'sketches', 'were', 'just', 'words', 'being', 'thrown', 'air', 'audience', 'seemingly', 'laughing', 'hope', 'hearing', 'something', 'funny.Also', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'terribly', 'glum', 'situation', 'basic', 'message', 'being', 'was', 'chance', 'set', 'fail', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'however', '1989', 'promise', '1990', 'true', 'comedy', 'come', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'treated', 'footage.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'perspective', 'movie', 'star', 'cast', 'members', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Anthony', 'Michael-Hall', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here.But', 'want', 'reason', 'appreciate', 'magic', 'original', 'cast', 'joy', 'was', '1990', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'then', 'buy', 'DVD']",Saturday Night Live Lost & Found: SNL in the 80's

But I felt that this presentation was lacking a bit in depth, even considering the two-hour run time (which includes bonus content).Most of this seems to focus on the fact that  Lorne Michaels WASN'T there throughout the first half of the '80s. Not a whole bunch of showcasing sketches. Less time was spent on the latter part of the decade when the show really made its resurgence (thanks in large part to the 15th anniversary special, not mentioned here).As interesting as it is, this just feels incomplete to me, and lacking in details that I think might have made it far better.",3,Probably doesn't go deep enough,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,706,"['hard', 'not', 'like', 'taking', 'dip', 'period', '34', 'SNL', '34', 'history', 'least', 'known', 'remembered', 'cared', 'felt', 'presentation', 'was', 'lacking', 'bit', 'depth', 'even', 'considering', 'two-hour', 'run', 'time', 'bonus', 'content', '.Most', 'focus', 'fact', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'first', 'half', ""'80s"", 'Not', 'whole', 'bunch', 'showcasing', 'sketches', 'Less', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'latter', 'part', 'decade', 'when', 'show', 'really', 'made', 'resurgence', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', '15th', 'anniversary', 'special', 'not', 'mentioned', 'here', '.As', 'interesting', 'just', 'incomplete', 'lacking', 'details', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'better']",Saturday Night Live Lost & Found: SNL in the 80's
