Terminally adolescent, utterly rude, incapable of restraining his vile behavior, he finds a perfect match in Gerwig's wasp space cadet, who leaps from bed to bed with no sense of purpose or virtue, and whose standards could hardly be lower.

1303694,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002ZG97TC,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[4, 6]","Director Noah Baumbach has consistently made films that study the human condition under different scenarios, some of which we may be familiar with. In fact, he is one of the few that doesn't take the commercial approach in doing so. His films ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005) and ""Margot at the Wedding"" (2007) are good examples of successful movies that explore dysfunctional relationships. ""Greenberg"" triumphantly follows this pattern, and takes a sincere and penetrating look at another group of people trying to find happiness in the weirdest of conditions.Ben Stiller stars as Roger Greenberg, a troubled human being who was recently released from a mental institution. He is on the way to recovery, and agrees to temporarily move from New York to Los Angeles, to babysit his brother's house, while he and his family go to Vietnam for vacation. Everything is going well, until he apparently gets bored with his solitude. With all the time in the world in his hands and nothing else to do - other than taking care of the dog --, he decides to get in touch with his best friend in that city (Rhys Ifans) and his ex-girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh). He also tries his luck with Florence Marr (Greta Gerwig), his brother's personal assistant. All these relationships will be a true test for Roger during his recovery, and he may get more of what he is looking for.Ben Stiller's performance reminded me to the one that he played in ""Permanent Midnight"" (1998), in which he was intense and unpredictable. Green berg is a man of many obsessions, one being his constant complaining to government and private officials in regards to things like he doesn't like. This film really captures this character's complexity, and we can identify with him, as well as with Florence, who is in a world of her own, too. The Blu-ray version of this film includes a making-of documentary, ""Greenberg loves Los Angeles"" feature, and a segment on Baumbach's approach to the film.

The laughs earned by the film come from a very perceptive observation of a character who seems lost wherever he goes.What Ben Stiller does with this role is a revelation -- he makes an audience sympathetic to a very unsympathetic character.  If a character like Greenberg has even the slight possibility of finding love and happiness then there is truly hope for us all.Ben Stiller hasn't shown acting chops like this in years and it's very refreshing to see him take on an adult role for a change.'Greenberg' is easily one of the best films of 2010 and will find a place on many Top Ten lists.
