962787,A14OKJXPQ7F7GB,B000CSUNTS,Bri,"[2, 3]","Jenna Fischer of NBC'S The Office unleashes a Troma-distributed mockumentary about a wealthy couple ( Fischer and Gunn ) who decide to help the homeless. How, you may ask? By giving them money? Providing housing? Working in a soup kitchen? No. Handing out suckers.  Armed with inspirational phrases, these lollipops are distributed to the homeless.  What follows is a mockumentary that skewers the lengths people go to for notoriety, and the seemingly well-intentioned, yet narcissistic nature of a couple who see the world through different lenses.  The charity becomes a production to them, with a television crew and celebrity endorsements gleaming in their eyes, as they view social causes casually, aiming to find the ""perfect charity"" to bestow their generosity upon..  In doing so, they fail to spot the problems in their own marriage and lives.",4,Sweet as candy.. ..,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,852,"['Jenna', 'Fischer', 'NBC', 'Office', 'Troma-distributed', 'mockumentary', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'Fischer', 'Gunn', 'who', 'decide', 'help', 'homeless', 'How', 'may', 'ask', 'giving', 'money', 'Providing', 'housing', 'Working', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'No', 'Handing', 'out', 'suckers', 'Armed', 'inspirational', 'phrases', 'lollipops', 'are', 'distributed', 'homeless', 'What', 'mockumentary', 'lengths', 'people', 'go', 'notoriety', 'seemingly', 'well-intentioned', 'yet', 'narcissistic', 'nature', 'couple', 'who', 'see', 'world', 'different', 'lenses', 'charity', 'production', 'television', 'crew', 'celebrity', 'endorsements', 'gleaming', 'eyes', 'view', 'social', 'causes', 'casually', 'aiming', 'find', 'perfect', 'charity', 'bestow', 'generosity', 'upon..', 'doing', 'so', 'fail', 'spot', 'problems', 'own', 'marriage', 'lives']",Lollilove

Also, both of their characters reminded me of people I know, especially Jenna's. There were also things that needed work.

962790,A32GLRK2JC5OXY,B000CSUNTS,"HumorousSmile ""J-Biz""","[2, 2]","Wow, this movie really hits the spot. Whether you love lollipops or not, the subtle (and sometimes blatantly in-your-face) humor of this short, one hour film is is brilliant! Now I know why I love Jenna Fischer's fun character on ""The Office"" (U.S. version) and James Gunn. They sell this movie so well it'll make you want to, occasionally, hate them both enough to want to slap them across the head! Jenna Fischer and James Gunn play a married couple who want to give back to the community and all that jazz. So Fischer creates Lollilove, a charity to get the homeless back on their feet by giving each of them a lollipop. In essence, the lives of these homeless people will suddenly turn around and get back in gear because of a lollipop with Gunn's imaginative (and pretty ignorant) art on the wrappers. This movie is definitely smart, so check it out if you are looking for a good mockumentary. It follows the likes of ""The Office,"" but with the more subtle humor of ""Series 7: The Contenders,"" another subtle and smart low budget film.The whole film has Jenna and James followed around by a camera as they are interviewed about Lollilove as well as their journey to their confident success. Written, produced, and directed by Fischer herself, you will not regret this purchase. Plus, the DVD has tons of goodies in the special features area, so you can have tons of fun even after the hilarity of the movie is over.",5,My love for Lollilove,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,1420,"['Wow', 'movie', 'really', 'spot', 'love', 'lollipops', 'not', 'subtle', 'sometimes', 'blatantly', 'in-your-face', 'humor', 'short', 'one', 'hour', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'love', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'fun', 'character', 'Office', 'U.S.', 'version', 'James', 'Gunn', 'sell', 'movie', 'so', 'well', ""'ll"", 'make', 'want', 'occasionally', 'hate', 'enough', 'want', 'slap', 'head', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'James', 'Gunn', 'play', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'want', 'give', 'back', 'community', 'jazz', 'Fischer', 'creates', 'Lollilove', 'charity', 'get', 'homeless', 'back', 'feet', 'giving', 'lollipop', 'essence', 'lives', 'homeless', 'people', 'will', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'around', 'get', 'back', 'gear', 'lollipop', 'Gunn', 'imaginative', 'pretty', 'ignorant', 'art', 'wrappers', 'movie', 'definitely', 'smart', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'mockumentary', 'likes', 'Office', 'more', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Series', '7', 'Contenders', 'subtle', 'smart', 'low', 'budget', 'film.The', 'whole', 'film', 'Jenna', 'James', 'followed', 'around', 'camera', 'are', 'interviewed', 'about', 'Lollilove', 'as', 'well', 'journey', 'confident', 'success', 'Written', 'produced', 'directed', 'Fischer', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'tons', 'goodies', 'special', 'features', 'area', 'can', 'have', 'tons', 'fun', 'even', 'hilarity', 'movie']",Lollilove

I admit I viewed this DVD because I love Jenna on The Office and Lollilove did not disappoint at all.  It is similar in the mockumentary sense, but also very different.  It is hilariously done and Jenna & her husband, James Gunn, are spot on. There are also great cameos from Linda Cardellini and Jason Segel from Freaks and Geeks.The context of the mockumentary is a couple who wants to start a charity but the couple (Jenna and James) are somewhat shallow and self-centered.

Believe me, the rest of the DVD makes up for that, as the cover boasts ""over 3 hours of extra features"", I didn't actually keep track of time watching the extras, but there is an overwhelming amount. There is a video diary from Lloyd Kaufmann (of Troma) on the set of SLiTHER (James directed/wrote this movie). There is a scene from ""Make Your Own Damn Movie"" with James and Lloyd. I might be confusing my DVDs, but I think there is the scene from ""Tromeo and Juliet"" (a movie that James wrote) that James was in (the actor that was supposed to play the part was sick that day). There is plenty of deleted scenes. There is also my favorite kind of commentaries, the kind where its a video of the people talking rather than bringing myself to watch the movie with people talking over it (although I think that is there too).

962797,A1NJLISY4ZWP7D,B000CSUNTS,Ton,"[3, 3]","Directed by and starring Jenna Fischer who most people will know from her role in the American version of The Office tv series. Her very natural acting abilities make it very easy to forget that the documentary LolliLove you are watching, is actually a skillfully scripted and directed film. Fischer wrote her directorial debut with Peter Alton and (uncredited) her real-life husband James Gunn (writer of the Scooby Doo films, Dawn of the Dead remake and Tromeo and Juliet and writer/director of Slither) . Gunn also plays her husband in the film as well, and as he has shown briefly in Tromeo & Juliet, his acting is of the same lifelike quality as Jenna's.Lollilove is about those people who try to do the right thing by devoting themselves to a charity project for all the wrong reasons and without any genuine knowledge or understanding of the badly treated individuals in our society they try to help, and even worse so: without any interest in them apart from the opportunity to show off as a better person themselves. And the saddest thing is that they don't even know or realize this themselves.A very dark comedy that is never too funny and sometimes gut-wrenchingly showing the mental poverty of those who are looked upon as being well off.With this film as her debut as a film director, it should only be common sense to be confident that Jenna Fischer has a rich career ahead of her.The feature film is done justice with a rich collection of extra's on Troma's dvd presentation that would make Criterion proud. A very informative and entertaining audio-commentary by Fisher and Gunn with Peter Alton and producer Stephen Blackeheart (100 million BCfriends, a very detailed behind the scenes documentary and a rich collection of deleted scenes and interviews with the Gunns, but also historic film introductions with James Gunn and Stephen Blackeheart from various Troma films, exclusive footage from the set of  James Gunn's Slither and much more.Also starring Linda Cardellini (E.R., Broke Back Mountain), Jason Segel (CSI), Joan M. Blair (Donnie Darko, E.R.), Lloyd Kaufman (Terror Firmer) and many more, this is a star studded film that would have been a huge hit if it wasn't released by a blacklisted small independent film studio.
