328870,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302717612,C. O. DeRiemer,"[6, 6]","They Only Kill Their Masters is a flawed murder mystery. A meatloaf dinner half way through stops it in its tracks. The female romantic lead is as bland and uninteresting as packaged custard. The director never establishes control over the movie.On the other hand, it also has a great deal of easy-going charm, a winning performance by James Garner (who carries the picture) and a deliberately misleading set of clues that lead to steamy speculation, smarmy behavior and committed kinkiness. There's a sleight-of-hand solution that makes sense and a Doberman named Murphy with chompers big enough to rip out a throat and a tail that could power an aluminum smelter just by wags.Never trust small town values, especially if the small town is Eden Landing on the California coast. When a young woman washes up on the sand in front of a beach house, she has major mauling on her body and a prancing Doberman bouncing around in the surf next to her. It's not long before the newspaper pronounces the woman dead by dog and Murphy is scheduled for euthanasia by Dr. Watkins (Hal Holbrook), the town vet. Then Police Chief Abel Marsh (Garner) has a talk with the town coroner. Seems the dog's bites were all on the body's arms and legs. Looks like Murphy might have been trying to rescue her. Then there's evidence that she drowned...on purpose and it wasn't suicide. Her lungs are full of tap water mixed with salt, not seawater. And she was pregnant. As Abel investigates, he finds more questions than answers. He gets bashed and beaten. And he finds he likes the vet's new assistant (Katharine Ross) well enough to invite her over for a meatloaf supper. Abel also finds some erotic photos. Seems the dead woman liked to keep a record of her doings. Through it all Abel remains skeptical, likeable, wry and smart...just like James Garner. The conclusion is tricky and nearly lethal for Abel.Some fine actors join Garner in this flawed but interesting murder mystery. Katharine Ross, unfortunately, brings little to the part. The character is bland, has a nice smile, not much personality and pours too much dressing on the salad she makes for herself and Abel to accompany Abel's meatloaf. But as compensation there are all those excellent, aging actors who show up and demonstrate why Garner is wise enough not to go toe-to-toe with them in their scenes together. Tom Ewell is one of Abel's cops; June Allyson is the vet's wife; Edmund O'Brien is the liquor store owner; Arthur O'Connell owns the local diner and Ann Rutherford is Abel's police dispatcher. Even Peter Lawford shows up as a sleaze with a lot of hair. They give us more than cameos, but none of the parts requires actors as known as they are. The result is that each actor gets a little extra business to do so that we can appreciate their skill and we can remember their great roles. As much as they add to the movie's pleasure, their presence distracts from the story.I've always liked this movie. The solution is unexpected. Garner is Garner, and that's a plus. And it's still good to see in their old age just how skilled and professional were Edmund O'Brien (D.O.A.,Seven Days in May,The Wild Bunch), Tom Ewell (Adam's Rib,The Seven Year Itch) and Arthur O'Connell (Picnic,Anatomy of a Murder).They Only Kill Their Masters comes from Warner's Archive Collection, films from their vault that may once have been released long ago as a VHS and then disappeared. Warner slaps them as is on DVDs and charges a premium. The quality of each movie's transfer is no better than the quality of the print from the vault. In this case, the quality is better than average. There are no extras and no chapter index. You can click ahead at ten-minute intervals.

328872,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302717612,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","That above sarcastic remark is courtesy of veterinary nurse, Mrs. Kate Bingham (Katharine Ross), and it's directed at the less-than-enthused Chief of Police Abel Marsh (James Garner). Marsh is at the vet on official business, there to show paperwork that'll get a Doberman pinscher put down for killing its owner. I'm guessing it's routine stuff like that, more often than not, that Marsh has dealt with in his years of service in the California coastal town of Eden's Landing.But there's something about that lovely nurse and her quiet (but pointed) championing of Murphy the Doberman. It makes the chief take a pause. It makes him take a closer look. And it turns out, the woman didn't die by way of Doberman. She was drowned. And now Chief Marsh suspects something foul.In plenty of ways, 1972's THEY ONLY KILL THEIR MASTERS reminds one of a television movie. The production values weren't exactly top caliber. In fact, no sooner were the scenes completed than the lot cast and crew were on was shut down by MGM, and for good. There is, surprisingly, an element of racy stuff going down in the narrative (four words: promiscuous, dead, pregnant 1esbian). And it's not the bit where the sleepy tiny town is rocked by a steamy scandal. No, that's actually par for the course in these murder mysteries. What had some viewers harrumphing when this movie was first released was that June Allyson, who has a supporting role here, played a decidedly unfamiliar role.I don't think there ever was a movie with James Garner in it that I didn't like. He's simply very likable and seems so down-to-earth. As Abel Marsh, he exudes his patented laid-back charm and a worldweariness and maybe even a certain air of superiority over them bustling city folk. One look at Garner and you don't doubt that the man has smarts. He makes it look so easy. It's a pleasure watching him interact with his cast. Not too long after this, Garner would embark on the fabulous television series, THE ROCKFORD FILES. And Chief Marsh and Jim Rockford share many characteristics. They're both sharp as a tack and cool as the other side of the pillow.The grind-it-out procedural feel is another thing that likens the movie to a television show. Sort of offsetting that is the joy in watching a supporting cast heftily composed of classic film stars. Marsh, in the course of his investigation, runs into characters played by June Allyson, Peter Lawford, Ann Rutherford, Edmond O'Brien, and Tom Ewell. But if you're not into old, familiar faces or small town sleaze, then see this, anyway, for Garner's self-assured performance, for a very good, very comely Katharine Ross, for that cute (and sometimes scary) Doberman, and for them touches of humor, most of which come by way of amusing observations on the daily grind of a small town policeman.",4,"""C'mon, Mr. Marsh, don't be nervous.

The others are: (1) Isn't It Shocking (Alan Alda, 1973); and (2) The Girl In The Empty Grave and (3) Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977).Here, Chief Abel Marsh (James Garner) returns from a Los Angeles vacation to read in the paper about a local woman's death while he was away. She was found dead at the beach, with her pet Doberman ""Murphy"" beside her and its bite marks on her arms. Marsh finds some suspicious signs at her house and learns that Dobermans strike for the neck, not the arms. So he has the woman's body exhumed and autopsied. He discovers that she was drowned in fresh water but dumped in the sea. He also learns that she was pregnant. Her ex-husband (Peter Lawford) tells Marsh that she ended the marriage because she was in love with a woman. Although the killer stripped the victim's house of evidence, Marsh finds in some litter on the floor a photograph of an unidentified nude couple running toward the beach, away from the camera. He takes in Murphy. He also starts a romance with Katharine Ross, who plays the assistant to veterinarian Hal Holbrook, husband of June Allyson.Marsh arrives at the victim's house to meet Lawford. Marsh finds the house in flames and Lawford unconscious inside, before being slugged. There is a nice scene as Marsh uses the phone in the house (his car tire and radio cord were slashed) to call for a fire truck and ambulance, only to have to sit outside and watch the house burn down and Lawford die, because the assailant, who took off in Lawford's car, blocked with the car the ""one-way tunnel"" between the town and the house, delaying the reinforcements. Further deductions lead Marsh to a suspect, who drugs and eludes him in an implausible scene (why would Marsh take the bundle from the suspect, tying up his arms, instead of handing it off to the owner, who was standing right there?). Marsh pursues the suspect and gets closer to the killer, with limited help from the bungling county police and apparently little or none from his own men. His relationship, such as it is, with Ross, falls apart due to his work on the case, at least for now.Unlike Alda, Garner is credible as a police chief. He uses a gun, breaks up a bar fight, and comports himself with authority. Unlike Griffith, Garner plays the role straight. The supporting cast is good, even if not as well-used as Alda's. There is more plotting and detective work in Garner's than the others. It strikes a better balance between serious and light elements than the dreary Alda or silly Griffith versions. Garner's has pleasant music and some good use of locations.But problems spoil fuller enjoyment of the movie. The plot depends on Marsh not being able to distinguish a 30-year-old woman from a 55-year-old woman. Why did the careful culprit leave the crucial photo behind? And there is no explanation for how the case could have initially been so badly mishandled (mistaking cause of death for bite marks, instead of drowning). The director seems to go out of his way to present early scenes as unpleasant and loud (Marsh banging incessantly on the police car horn outside the station; a waiting room at the vet's with countless barking, jumping dogs; sickly lime green counter trim and wallpaper in the victim's house; Marsh clumsily knocking things on the floor there).Garner acts so sullen and cynical that he lacks his usual charm and energy. Marsh's catch-phrases ""Neat,"" ""City folks,"" and ""When you know where not to look, that tells you something about where to look,"" feel overused and phony, not natural. Marsh wisecracks about ""triple bourbons for lunch,"" gleefully brings a second full pitcher of beer to his table, and always has a bottle handy. Nothing is made of this. Although likable, attractive actors, the relationship between Garner and Ross is hasty and unexplained in how it begins and especially ends, with excruciating, slow-paced scenes in which he, doing tight-lipped slow burns, and she, inquisitive and confused, take forever to say nothing. Lines that are supposed to be significant are incomprehensible (suspect tells Marsh, ""You're shrewd, Abel, but you're not very smart""). Marsh is too rough with Ross and with Murphy.There is little depth to the characters or relationships. Allyson is a mere stick figure plot device, with only a brief glimpse early and a few coarse, bitter lines (""She was a bitch.""; ""If you're so smart, you find the car.""). The victim is left obscure. Marsh's deputies play no meaningful role. The running joke of the gung-ho county police's incompetence is taken too far when it causes a death.The plot relies on sensationalism and innuendo rather than clear, satisfying explanation. The killer's confession is nearly incoherent (""....There was nothing left of him. Nothing of me. I had no choice.""). The movie seems to exploit homosexuality and ""threesomes"" as plot gimmicks. It can be crude and offensive, as when Marsh jokes to Ross' question about why he is still single, ""I'm a faggot. Have you seen the women in this town?""; Ross remarks, ""I guess dykes don't use the pill.""; a deputy laughs hysterically when discussing with Marsh a young woman who had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy with her in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road; Marsh mutters in response to Lawford's new teenage-looking floosie girlfriend's question about whether there are motels in town with vibrator beds ""in the box,"" ""In the box, neat....City folks.""; and dirty old townsmen quiz Marsh about ""Did he get much?"" on his L.A. vacation.",3,Better than expected but a lot of
