It's a shame that something like that is not offered here, I find it very practical2) workouts are fairly short - only when I did everything back to back did I get a decent, 50 min workout. On the DVD it is suggested that you do weight training every other day, abs twice a week and cardio at least once - I am simply not sure it would be enough..",4,"good, but it could have been better",1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,816,"['favour', '-1', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'likeable', 'instructor', 'what', 'doing', 'cues', 'well2', 'fancy', 'moves', 'everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'doable', 'still', 'get', 'job', '-1', 'own', 'Women', 'Health', 'DVD', 'same', 'instructor', 'believe', 'same', 'publisher', 'possibility', 'mix', 'match', 'can', 'choose', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'sequence', 'want', 'repeat', 'workout', 'segment', 'more', 'once', 'shame', 'something', 'not', 'offered', 'here', 'find', 'very', 'practical2', 'workouts', 'are', 'fairly', 'short', 'only', 'when', 'did', 'everything', 'back', 'back', 'did', 'get', 'decent', '50', 'min', 'workout', 'DVD', 'suggested', 'do', 'weight', 'training', 'other', 'day', 'abs', 'twice', 'week', 'cardio', 'least', 'once', 'am', 'simply', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'enough..']",The Abs Diet for Women Workout
1124054,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B00104AYZQ,Feles31,"[2, 3]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.I have quite a few workouts with this instructor --- she is a little more smiley and peppy than I usually like but somehow still works for me.  Two backup ""dancers"" are non-annoying and low impact modifications are available.  Music is minimal --- would have preferred something with strong beat that you can hear and follow easily without watching screen the whole time.  [update:  did the cardio segment with music only --- awesome!!! Great beat, great music, and the instructors mostly move in time to the music. cool down segment at end was 80s bad but the rest was really great.]As others have noted, this is a no-frills straight forward workout. I used 10 lbs on weight segments since the reps are rather low and slow (perfect for higher weights.)  Cardio consists of lots of jogging, squatting, jumping, jacks with long durations of each move and repeated cycles.  For those that are easily bored and want a new and unusual move every five moves (like the Firm workouts I've tried), this is not for you.  That said, I don't mind the simplicity as long as I get a good workout.  This fit my level perfectly so I sweated big time but could easily keep up.Based on the bonus nutrition segment on DVD, the abs diet seems misnamed.  It basically seems like the usual eat healthy type diet, so I must be missing why the name is ab-centric.  I think this probably would have gone better if not advertised under the abs diet concept.  I almost passed this by based on the title thinking it would be a workout for abs only (I prefer overall workouts, which this is.) Seems other reviewers thought the same and was disappointed it was not all about abs although the DVD description clearly shows it is not all abs so, technically, that is their mistake to have assumed.Maybe they should have called it Abs Diet Total Body Workout or something.",4,probably better to alter title,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1894,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.I', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'workouts', 'instructor', 'little', 'more', 'smiley', 'peppy', 'usually', 'like', 'somehow', 'still', 'Two', 'backup', 'dancers', 'are', 'non-annoying', 'low', 'impact', 'modifications', 'are', 'available', 'Music', 'minimal', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'something', 'strong', 'beat', 'can', 'hear', 'follow', 'easily', 'watching', 'screen', 'whole', 'time', '[', 'update', 'did', 'cardio', 'segment', 'music', 'only', 'awesome', 'Great', 'beat', 'great', 'music', 'instructors', 'mostly', 'move', 'time', 'music', 'cool', 'down', 'segment', 'end', 'was', '80s', 'bad', 'rest', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'no-frills', 'straight', 'forward', 'workout', 'used', '10', 'lbs', 'weight', 'segments', 'reps', 'are', 'rather', 'low', 'slow', 'perfect', 'higher', 'weights', 'Cardio', 'lots', 'jogging', 'squatting', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'long', 'durations', 'move', 'repeated', 'cycles', 'are', 'easily', 'bored', 'want', 'new', 'unusual', 'move', 'five', 'moves', 'Firm', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'not', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'simplicity', 'as', 'long', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'fit', 'level', 'perfectly', 'so', 'sweated', 'big', 'time', 'could', 'easily', 'keep', 'up.Based', 'bonus', 'nutrition', 'segment', 'DVD', 'abs', 'diet', 'misnamed', 'basically', 'usual', 'eat', 'healthy', 'type', 'diet', 'must', 'be', 'missing', 'why', 'name', 'ab-centric', 'think', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'better', 'not', 'advertised', 'abs', 'diet', 'concept', 'almost', 'passed', 'based', 'title', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'workout', 'abs', 'only', 'prefer', 'overall', 'workouts', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'same', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'abs', 'DVD', 'description', 'clearly', 'not', 'abs', 'so', 'technically', 'mistake', 'have', 'assumed.Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'Abs', 'Diet', 'Total', 'Body', 'Workout', 'something']",The Abs Diet for Women Workout

1124057,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B00104AYZQ,Little Miss Cutey,"[38, 39]","This workout is OK.  It's certainly not my favourite, but it gets the job done and I definately felt the burn and felt 'new' muscles for a day later.  I bought it because I enjoyed their book and wanted to see what they did here.  They don't only focus on abs, but they have moves to work the entire body.  There is some cardio too which is good for overall fat burning - it's not too dificult to do and mainly geared for intermediates.  They give you low impact options if the higher impact is too tough to do or if you have bad joints.  I have to say that the stretch at the end is really nice and worth the price of the dvd alone.  All you need are some dumbbells and you're good to go.  It's led well, and while I won't use it all the time, it's good to go back to it everynow and then to keep myself from workout boredom.",4,Good intermediate workout :-l,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,826,"['workout', 'OK', 'certainly', 'not', 'favourite', 'job', 'done', 'definately', 'felt', 'burn', 'felt', ""'new"", 'muscles', 'day', 'later', 'bought', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'focus', 'abs', 'have', 'moves', 'work', 'entire', 'body', 'cardio', 'too', 'good', 'overall', 'fat', 'burning', 'not', 'too', 'dificult', 'do', 'mainly', 'geared', 'intermediates', 'give', 'low', 'impact', 'options', 'higher', 'impact', 'too', 'tough', 'do', 'have', 'bad', 'joints', 'have', 'say', 'stretch', 'end', 'really', 'nice', 'worth', 'price', 'dvd', 'alone', 'need', 'are', 'dumbbells', ""'re"", 'good', 'go', 'led', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'time', 'good', 'go', 'back', 'everynow', 'then', 'keep', 'workout', 'boredom']",The Abs Diet for Women Workout
1124058,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B00104AYZQ,L. Perry,"[10, 14]","I have to admit, I probably own around 200 workouts.  And, of ALL of them, this one probably has the Most Boring Cardio segement.  Good points on the cardio are that it requires little space and does raise your heart rate.  However, I cannot conquer the dread factor that comes from the repetiveness in the cardio!  Seriously, where is the imagination?  You spend well OVER HALF the cardio segment simply jogging in place.  Just that: Jogging!  And, the few intervals of not-jogging are repetitve in themselves.  (No combos, you just repeat a move more intense that jogging for 30-90 seconds; so, for instance, you might jog for 3 minutes, then do jump squats for 1.)  INCREDIBLY DULL!  I will never do the cardio segment again. The toning segments are good and fun; so I kept this dvd for them alone.  If I could rate the toning and cardio seperately, I would.  I would like to give the Cardio exactly half of a star.  I would give the toning a full four stars;  well, four and half.  If you expect imagination and choreography:buyer beware.  This instructor DOES have another dvd (Women's Health Train for Your Body Type) which I would recommend instead.  It has really solid, fun toning segments.  The cardio on it is not particularly imaginative or exciting, but she does far less jogging in place (but, yes, she still doest that!  why????).  If you tried it and thought that cardio was dull, you will never survive this one!  I would give that whole video a solid 4 stars.  Check in out.
