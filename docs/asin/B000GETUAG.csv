1002612,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000GETUAG,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[2, 5]","From Crown International Pictures, who describe themselves as a `leading force in independent film production and distribution', which is just a fancy way of saying purveyors of schlock, comes Hunk (1987), a relatively vapid Faustian variant where a seemingly pathetic nerdlinger involves himself in a deal with the devil in order to fulfill his greatest fantasy, to become a serious piece of man meat, the kind women want most and men most want to be.  Written and directed by Lawrence Bassoff (Weekend Pass), the film stars John Allen Nelson (Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell), Steve Levitt (Last Resort), former Miss USA Deborah Shelton (Body Double), and the late James Coco (Murder by Death, The Cheap Detective), in one of his last roles.  Also appearing is Rebeccah Bush (""Jake and the Fatman""), Cynthia Szigeti (Johnny Dangerously), Avery Schreiber (Galaxina), and Hilary Shepard (Private Resort).As the movie begins we see a toned, tanned, blonde haired, blue eyed man rising from bed in his California beachfront home, going through his morning routine, eventually leaving home in a red beamer with the word `Hunk' on his license plates.  Upon arriving in the city he visits a psychologist's office and meets Dr. Susan `Sunny' Graves (Bush), whereupon we learn the man's name is Hunk Golden (Nelson), and he's got a fantastic story to tell.  Seems a few weeks prior, Hunk was actually computer programmer Bradley Brinkman (Levitt), a nerdly sort with an active imagination who is about to lose his job if he doesn't come up with a successful program.  In an act of desperation he states he'd sell his soul for an idea, to which something strange happens...his computer writes a program on its own, one that details how to live a yuppie lifestyle.  Turns out the program is a huge success, one for which Bradley gets a huge commission allowing him to rent a dumpy beachfront house in an exclusive California beach community for the summer if only to better understand yuppies, apparently.  He meets a number of residents, including a large, rotund, female neighbor named Chachka (Szigeti), who reminds me a lot of actress Wendie Jo Sperber (Moving Violations, Back to the Future), only more annoying, if such a thing were possible.  Anyway, Bradley's not well accepted within the land of pretension, but help soon comes in the form of a beautiful demonic sorceress simply named O'Brien (Shelton), who makes a temporary deal, one that includes giving Bradley everything he wants in exchange for his soul (seems Bradley has an opportunity to back out within a certain timeframe).  Bradley, thinking it's a joke, accepts, and awakens the next morning a new man named Hunk Golden.  Not only that but his house, his car, his clothes and so on are all befitting the lifestyle of the ultimate Yuppie.  Soon enough James Coco makes the scene, dressed as Attila the Hun for some odd reason, calling himself Dr. D (in case you haven't guessed he's the devil) and we learn he's got some serious plans for Bradley/Hunk, so long as Hunk doesn't decide to go back to being Bradley before Labor Day...I thought this movie, loaded with an extraordinary amount of ridiculous late 1980s fashion sensibilities, was passable, but I think I would have enjoyed it more had I been an indiscriminating female viewer or a dude who enjoyed the company of men (if you know what I mean) given the extensive amount of man flesh displayed throughout the film.  It felt like nearly every other scene featured John Allen Nelson without his shirt on (or in some form of undress), showing off his well toned, exceedingly tanned, immaculate physique.  It's not that I can't appreciate a handsome man, but there was just a little too much here in terms of pectorals, buns, and banana hammocks for my tastes.  On the flipside there are quite a few female characters running around, few of them I considered attractive except for the vibrant Deborah Shelton and the demure Rebeccah Bush...and know neither show much in the way of skin, which didn't surprise me given the film is rated PG.  By the way, if you ever wanted to see a blubbery James Coco in a wetsuit, here's your chance (there's an image you don't want to be saddled with, let me tell you).  The performances were decent enough for a movie like this and the characters a bit stronger than I would have expected (albeit none of them are all that likeable), but I did feel the film ran a little longer than necessary (the running time is right around an hour and forty minutes) as director Bassoff could have easily cut twenty minutes off and not lost anything.  One aspect I didn't understand was why James Coco's character was constantly appearing in various outfits, including Attila the Hun, a German soldier, a Trojan emperor, etc.  I know it was explained (apparently he traveled through time spreading his own brand of wickedness), but it just felt pointless.  As far as Coco playing the devil, well, it works, I suppose, if you can accept the master of all that is evil as an over the hill, portly, mincing, sexually ambiguous man, but I had a hard time biting.  As far as the comedy, I really didn't find a whole lot of laughs.  It often tended to involve exaggerated depictions, in my opinion, of various elements within the story, the main target being yuppies along with a whole lot of lame jokes about the afterlife in general.  The movie does feel drawn out at times, and I thought the ending a little too syrupy and drawn out for my tastes, but there are worse ways to spend your time, I suppose, like shaving rabid monkeys or eating freshly ground glass.The picture on this BCI DVD release, presented in widescreen (1.78:1), looks better than expected and the stereo audio comes through fairly clean, with little or no distortion.  There aren't any extras, but there are a handful of previews for other BCI DVD releases including Tomboy (1985), Weekend Pass (1984), My Tutor (1983), and one for My Chauffer (1986), which is actually spelled incorrectly on the menu, listed as `My Chaufffer', which seemed kind of sloppy to me.Cookieman108",3,"""Will success spoil Hunk Golden?""",1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,6093,"['Crown',

1002613,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000GETUAG,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","I usually like older 80s romantic comedies, but Hunk just takes 80s corniness to a new level. The acting is atrociously bad, and I say that as someone who typically forgives weak acting. The basic plot is fine - a guy sells soul to the devil in order to become a hunk - but the plot twists just don't make sense. Why does the devil keep going back in time to create more evil? Is he actually trying to change the past? A TV host nearly drives a jeep in reverse off a pier and doesn't seem capable of braking during the minute or so it's going on? Isn't it a bit all too convenient that the Devil's assistant falls in love with the main character? On top of all that, the guy's name is Hunk!

1002615,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B000GETUAG,Rick L. Parrish,"[4, 5]","I believe this is the last movie appearance by the late, great James CoCo who plays Satan in this little 80's jewell with devilish glee. Certainly he gives it a spin that Little Nicky nor his dad could conjure.  He makes the movie worth watching and he certainly had the biggest slice of the costume budget.  Surprisingly, John Allen Nelson,(currently on 24) one of the endless supply of Soap Hunks seemingly available on demand at any given time in any given decade, gives a meaty (couldn't resist it) performance that is full of charm and wit. Steve Levitt acquits himself perfectly as the pre- and post- transformation nerd. Even CoCo had to watch out for the scene stealing vamping of Deborah Shelton (Body Double) as the assistant from Hell (literally).  Of course watch for Robert Morse in a drier than the Sahara perf.  And last but not least serve plenty of savory Avery Doritos at your Celebration Of The California Hunk Lifestyle Party when you screen it (sorry, never been much of a Schreiber describer).

The plot is simple:  an average looking guy nearly sells his soul to the devil for a summer as a hunk.  Only in the end when he nearly loses his soul does he realize what the important things in life are.The acting was horrible and the director must have been on something when the final cut was made.  It had the potential to be a cute comedy but instead turns into an eye-roller.  The only saving grace is John Allen Nelson who is extremely handsome in this movie.  That said, there's nothing in this movie that really is anything original.On a side note, I think it's interesting how Hunk was portrayed as the ideal man.  You have to admit that in today's society, Hunk Golden would only be attractive to men in the gay community.
