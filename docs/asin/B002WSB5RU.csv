1297292,A3J0TTY0GFPPQP,B002WSB5RU,Adam J. Hopper,"[2, 3]","Alright, first and foremost lets get the obvious out of the way.  This is a direct rip-off of Paranormal Activity.  They knew this when they made it, and anyone that claims this little fact as a reason for hating the movie should never have watched it in the first place.  Watch this movie because you really enjoyed Paranormal Activity and wouldn't mind watching another inferior version of the same plot to see what they add to it.I really liked Paranormal Activity.  When I saw a movie called Paranormal Entity on Netflix, I knew I had to watch it and just see how bad it really was.  I won't lie, it isn't the greatest....but surprisingly it wasn't the worst either.  I will use spoilers ahead because I truly feel that you have to break a movie like this down in order to truly review it.The acting was quite poor.  It was just very amateur.  For a movie like this, the actors need to be ""not actors.""  In other words, they need to look like real people going through this stuff, and not like actors playing people going through this stuff.  It wasn't terrible through the whole movie, but definitely got worse when things started getting intense.Pacing was a little too fast in this one.  Things really get going quick.  Some people love that.  I however, prefer to get to know the characters better.The scares were pretty similar to Paranormal Activity.  Lots of crazy invisible things going on, with loud slamming doors and knocks.  Perhaps the best ""new"" addition to this movie is the demon's motives.  It wants the sister character in more than one way.  That's a freaky concept.  There is also a scene with an alarm system of sorts involving bells that I thought was a decent idea.Honestly there is a lot of bad elements to this movie.  I was able to ""trick"" myself into just not seeing them.  However, for you over thinkers out there I will admit that they really messed some things up.  The characters continue to sleep in separate rooms and just let the sister suffer each night.  They never have other people over to witness the ""happenings.""  The psychic that is supposed to help, is conveniently on a very long vacation while these people are getting destroyed.  The sister is obviously attractive, and is scantly clad throughout the movie when she is probably scared out of her mind.  Probably most notable of all, the beginning has the mother character calling 911, the end it's the son.Watch this movie with a grain of salt for lack of a better saying.  You could enjoy it if you can get past it's short-comings, of which there are many.",3,"Good, if you don't over think it.....",1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,2557,"['Alright', 'first', 'foremost', 'lets', 'get', 'obvious', 'way', 'direct', 'rip-off', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'knew', 'when', 'made', 'anyone', 'little', 'fact', 'reason', 'hating', 'movie', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'place', 'Watch', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'inferior', 'version', 'same', 'plot', 'see', 'what', 'add', 'it.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'called', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'Netflix', 'knew', 'had', 'watch', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'really', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', ""n't"", 'greatest', '.but', 'surprisingly', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'will', 'use', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'truly', 'feel', 'have', 'break', 'movie', 'down', 'order', 'truly', 'review', 'it.The', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'poor', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'amateur', 'movie', 'actors', 'need', 'be', 'not', 'actors', 'other', 'words', 'need', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'going', 'stuff', 'not', 'actors', 'playing', 'people', 'going', 'stuff', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'whole', 'movie', 'definitely', 'got', 'worse', 'when', 'things', 'started', 'getting', 'intense.Pacing', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'one', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'quick', 'people', 'love', 'however', 'prefer', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'better.The', 'scares', 'were', 'pretty', 'similar', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Lots', 'crazy', 'invisible', 'things', 'going', 'loud', 'slamming', 'doors', 'knocks', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'new', 'addition', 'movie', 'demon', 'motives', 'sister', 'character', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'freaky', 'concept', 'also', 'scene', 'alarm', 'system', 'sorts', 'involving', 'bells', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'idea.Honestly', 'lot', 'bad', 'elements', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'trick', 'just', 'not', 'seeing', 'However', 'thinkers', 'will', 'admit', 'really', 'messed', 'things', 'up', 'characters', 'continue', 'sleep', 'separate', 'rooms', 'just', 'let', 'sister', 'suffer', 'night', 'never', 'have', 'other', 'people', 'witness', 'happenings', 'psychic', 'supposed', 'help', 'conveniently', 'very', 'long', 'vacation', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'destroyed', 'sister', 'obviously', 'attractive', 'scantly', 'clad', 'movie', 'when', 'probably', 'scared', 'mind', 'Probably', 'most', 'notable', 'beginning', 'mother', 'character', 'calling', '911', 'end', 'son.Watch', 'movie', 'grain', 'salt', 'lack', 'better', 'saying', 'could', 'enjoy', 'can', 'get', 'short-comings', 'are', 'many']",N/A

1297294,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B002WSB5RU,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","Let me begin by saying that this film is obviously inspired by Paranormal Activity, it have the same set up, a household where strange Paranormal things happen where they inhabitants decides to film the whole thing to see if they can figure out what is going on and the movie then presented in a home video format. I however do not agree that Paranormal Entity is a remake of Paranormal Activity, the story is rather different even if the concept is the same. Asylum is known for making their own versions of popular movies and I sort of think they have lived both up to their reputation as copycats here and at the same time managed to create their own movie with it's own story.Paranormal Entity is about a widowed mother and her two teen children that live in a nice house together. The mother start using automatic writing to communicate with her husband and then strange things starts to happen around the house. Now it is here I start having some problems with the film, it moves to quickly. The things that made Paranormal Activity scary was it's realism, even if you knew you where watching a film you could sort of imagine this being a real home movie, what helped this effect was that the paranormal happenings where suable at first and just gradually became more threatening. Paranormal Entity throws all this slow buildup out the door and you have things flying from the start. Another thing that reduces the effectiveness of the film is the family's house, it is just to neat, it look like a shabby chick dream house from a interior decoration magazine, there is hardy any personal objects just lying around unless they are used as part of the storytelling, all that make it hard to believe that anyone is actually living there. The third problem with this film is the actress that play the sister. Now the sister is supposed to be very traumatized and she do not talk much, but this is drawn out into idiotic degrees with whole scene with just the brother asking his sister questions on everyday thing and she staring at him. Now this could work if she was catatonic but she is not, she go out on the town, have a normal life she is just a brat and refuse to speak or even acknowledge her brother is there most of the time. The actress do this very poorly and the sister just come off as arrogant and spoiled and that do not do when the viewer is supposed to be horrified at what happens to her.Paranormal Entity moves to fast, have bad acting and a to sterile set, but all in all I did enjoy the movie, it not a great movie but if you like haunted house movies then I think you will like this one. The story is okey, some of the effects towards the end is spooky, and if you liked Paranormal Activity then this might help tide you over until the next movie in the franchise. However all in all Paranormal Entity was rather mediocre, it was not bad, but it was not really memorable either.",3,Ok haunted house mockumentary flick.,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2903,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'film', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'have', 'same', 'set', 'up', 'household', 'where', 'strange', 'Paranormal', 'things', 'happen', 'where', 'inhabitants', 'decides', 'film', 'whole', 'thing', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'then', 'presented', 'home', 'video', 'format', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'remake', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'story', 'rather', 'different', 'even', 'concept', 'same', 'Asylum', 'known', 'making', 'own', 'versions', 'popular', 'movies', 'sort', 'think', 'have', 'lived', 'up', 'reputation', 'copycats', 'here', 'same', 'time', 'managed', 'create', 'own', 'movie', 'own', 'story.Paranormal', 'Entity', 'widowed', 'mother', 'two', 'teen', 'children', 'live', 'nice', 'house', 'together', 'mother', 'start', 'using', 'automatic', 'writing', 'communicate', 'husband', 'then', 'strange', 'things', 'happen', 'house', 'Now', 'here', 'start', 'having', 'problems', 'film', 'quickly', 'things', 'made', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'scary', 'was', 'realism', 'even', 'knew', 'where', 'watching', 'film', 'could', 'sort', 'imagine', 'being', 'real', 'home', 'movie', 'what', 'helped', 'effect', 'was', 'paranormal', 'happenings', 'where', 'suable', 'first', 'just', 'gradually', 'became', 'more', 'threatening', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'slow', 'buildup', 'door', 'have', 'things', 'flying', 'start', 'thing', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'family', 'house', 'just', 'neat', 'look', 'shabby', 'chick', 'dream', 'house', 'interior', 'decoration', 'magazine', 'hardy', 'personal', 'objects', 'just', 'lying', 'around', 'are', 'used', 'part', 'storytelling', 'make', 'hard', 'believe', 'anyone', 'actually', 'living', 'there', 'third', 'problem', 'film', 'actress', 'play', 'sister', 'Now', 'sister', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'traumatized', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'much', 'drawn', 'out', 'idiotic', 'degrees', 'whole', 'scene', 'just', 'brother', 'asking', 'sister', 'questions', 'everyday', 'thing', 'staring', 'Now', 'could', 'work', 'was', 'catatonic', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'town', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'just', 'brat', 'refuse', 'speak', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'brother', 'there', 'most', 'time', 'actress', 'do', 'very', 'poorly', 'sister', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'arrogant', 'spoiled', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'be', 'horrified', 'what', 'her.Paranormal', 'Entity', 'fast', 'have', 'bad', 'acting', 'sterile', 'set', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'like', 'haunted', 'house', 'movies', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'story', 'okey', 'effects', 'end', 'spooky', 'liked', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'then', 'might', 'help', 'tide', 'next', 'movie', 'franchise', 'However', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'was', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'memorable', 'either']",N/A

Police were called to the scene by Finley himself. He was found with his sister cradled in his arms. Despite the evidence against him, Thomas claimed that the victims were attacked by a demonic entity of unknown origin. Days later, he committed suicide. his video, which was found at the scene, is being released to the public as a record of what really happened inside the Finley home.I'd have to say both movies were about on par with one another as far as scares and whatnot are concerned. It's relevant to point out that both movies were low-budget. The only difference is that Paranormal Activity got more promotion and advertisement. The only thing I found, between the two movies, is that Enitity suffers with several plot holes and script woes. The acting was decent and believable. It was never boring enough, at any time, for me to quit watching. I ended up watching it through to the end.Overall, I enjoyed the movie despite it being labeled as a Paranormal Activity rip-off.

Ironically, this cheap cash-in both proves and disproves the effectiveness of the original film. The rapid-fire scares in ENTITY make it far more skeptical than the subtle haunts in ACTIVITY, but the cleverly implied scares that are created in both show that almost anyone can pick up a camera and generate the same level of terror with hardly any effort. Van Dyke asks very little of his actors, and receives little in return besides the expectantly bland performances and the obligatory nude scene. As a matter of budgetary convenience, the cameras placed in the rooms that are experiencing activity just happen to either get pushed aside or knocked over during pivotal moments. This leaves the viewer staring at a blank screen for much of the film.

That said, this one has many, many problems.First, not all of the performances are believable. A lot of it is contrived and poorly written and acted. Particularly the mother of the story. The sister is reasonable, and the main role is believable only until the dramatic moments. Then he loses me.Second, so much of the plot is directly lifted from Paranormal Activity. No brownie points for not even trying to make it seem a little different. Many elements are straight from it to the point where you could probably watch the two side by side and they would be nearly identical save for just a few minor elements.Third, the sets are completely disingenuous. It looks like a cheap display home in a cookie cutter neighborhood with a little cheap furniture for staging. It just isn't believable as someone's actual home so it serves as a constant reminder causing the movie to lose some of its realism and voyeuristic quality that the whole home camera thing is supposed to give. It defeats the purpose.Lastly, its completely predictable. Not only because so much of it is lifted from Paranormal Activity, but even the changed/added elements are easy to see coming from a mile away.Basically, if you are fairly easily amused and find it easy to look past some bad movie making and forgive some lack of imagination, you could find worse movies.

The studio is the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) master of the movie industry, making a living out of creating low-budget movies that are reminiscent of bigger franchises in name-only - mockbusters.  So the guys at Asylum must have been gnashing their teeth when Paranormal Activity, an ultra-low-budget horror film, became a runaway smash hit.  Surely, Asylum could make a movie at least as good - after all, it's what they do, right?And so we have Paranormal Entity. You can see that Entity ""corrects"" all the issues raised about Paranormal Activity: it wasn't violent enough, the attacks happened off screen, and there wasn't enough nudity.  If you felt that way about Paranormal Activity, then Paranormal Entity is for you.The Finley family consists of distraught mother Ellen (Fia Perera), her son Thomas (Shane Van Dyke) and hottie daughter Samantha (Erin Marie Hogan).  With the death of the patriarch David, Ellen is overjoyed when she writes to her deceased husband and gets a response.  That response turns to dread when it becomes clear that it's not the ghost of David but something far more sinister stalking the Finleys.Where Activity preferred to keep the dialogue between its young couple, Entity has three to work with.  Where Activity stays primarily in the house, Activity has its characters do the logical thing and move out - until they realize the entity just follows them. When Activity uses time-lapsed footage to reinforce the creepiness of possession, Entity films it all in real time. When a paranormal expert shows up in Activity but then flees for his life, in Entity he actually sticks around to do combat with the demon. The ending, while predictable, is considerably more graphic but lacks the visceral terror of Activity.Paranormal Entity gleefully embraces its low-budget roots by simply fading to black and jumping to the next plot point.  Depending on your perspective on faux documentaries, this is a lazy way to make a film or a realistic means of propelling the plot. Paranormal Entity will fool precisely no one into thinking that it's real, but then it's unlikely Paranormal Activity fooled anybody either.In short, Paranormal Entity scratches the itch of a lot of folks who were frustrated with Paranormal Activity. Of course, being a mockbuster, it's unlikely any of those viewers saw both movies - you really have to be a fan of one to watch the other.",3,A curious complement to Paranormal Activity,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2412,"['Poor', 'Asylum', 'studio', 'Search', 'Engine', 'Optimization', 'SEO', 'master', 'movie', 'industry', 'making', 'living', 'creating', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'bigger', 'franchises', 'name-only', 'mockbusters', 'guys', 'Asylum', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'when', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'ultra-low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'became', 'runaway', 'smash', 'hit', 'Surely', 'Asylum', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'least', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'right', 'so', 'have', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'can', 'see', 'Entity', 'corrects', 'issues', 'raised', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'was', ""n't"", 'violent', 'enough', 'attacks', 'happened', 'off', 'screen', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'nudity', 'felt', 'way', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'then', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'you.The', 'Finley', 'family', 'distraught', 'mother', 'Ellen', 'Fia', 'Perera', 'son', 'Thomas', 'Shane', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'hottie', 'daughter', 'Samantha', 'Erin', 'Marie', 'Hogan', 'death', 'patriarch', 'David', 'Ellen', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'deceased', 'husband', 'response', 'response', 'dread', 'when', 'clear', 'not', 'ghost', 'David', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'stalking', 'Finleys.Where', 'Activity', 'preferred', 'keep', 'dialogue', 'young', 'couple', 'Entity', 'three', 'work', 'Where', 'Activity', 'primarily', 'house', 'Activity', 'characters', 'do', 'logical', 'thing', 'move', 'out', 'realize', 'entity', 'just', 'When', 'Activity', 'time-lapsed', 'footage', 'reinforce', 'creepiness', 'possession', 'Entity', 'real', 'time', 'When', 'paranormal', 'expert', 'up', 'Activity', 'then', 'flees', 'life', 'Entity', 'actually', 'do', 'combat', 'demon', 'ending', 'predictable', 'considerably', 'more', 'graphic', 'visceral', 'terror', 'Activity.Paranormal', 'Entity', 'gleefully', 'low-budget', 'roots', 'simply', 'fading', 'black', 'jumping', 'next', 'plot', 'point', 'Depending', 'perspective', 'faux', 'documentaries', 'lazy', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'realistic', 'means', 'propelling', 'plot', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'will', 'fool', 'precisely', 'one', 'thinking', 'real', 'then', 'unlikely', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'fooled', 'anybody', 'either.In', 'short', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'itch', 'lot', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'frustrated', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'course', 'being', 'mockbuster', 'unlikely', 'viewers', 'saw', 'movies', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'one', 'watch', 'other']",N/A

Activity failed to deliver anything much more then a low budget snore fest with a few sounds thrown in over the top... so, when I heard that it was getting a sequel, surely enough, I had to go and give my peace of mind at the idiots leaving graffiti all over the internet walls with how exciting they think it is going to be. (they really need to see proper horror movies, not what their teeny bopper magazines think is supposedly ""cool"" till the next issue goes on sale)So while wasting a few minutes of my time abusing those who praised a sequel coming to PA, I noticed there was also mention about this other movie ""Paranormal Entity"", which a few people where saying was a hell of a lot better then ""Activity"". I thought I would check it out, just to have an opinion on the debate, and you know, heck, with internet now a days, who needs to pay, so I checked out ""Entity"" going into it expecting to hate it with a passion, just like I hated ""activity""... but now I feel guilty having downloaded it, and I think I will send the company a check for $3 saying it was worth it, or I will wait till the DVD's in the cheapie bin.Well, now I can say, a low budget snore fest's script that gets over-promoted and overrated can be made into a decent movie! The thing that happens in Hollyweed, is that someone writes a script, and it gets passed from studio to studio looking for someone to make it, but along the way, some companies agree to do it, but their needs to be a lot of changes, so the script writers say no, and move onto the next studio... leaving the previous studio thinking, ""euhh, who needs your script, we can make our own""... so who knows which was the original script, Entity or Activity, but Entity definitely had better writers an actors behind it... well, the chubby chick in Activity was nice eye candy to me, but I will never give a movie a thumbs up based on how 1 person in the movie looked, as it does not make up for the lack of thought put into the rest of the movie.Still, ""Entity"" is not something I am praising as a great horror film, i'm just saying it's decent, and a lot better then ""Activity"".. and this one does lose points from me by trying to CLAIM it's based on a true story... I really wish Hollyweed would stop trying to promote these things as ""it really did happen""... as any idiot these days knows when they see ""based on a true story"" they know what that means is the movie is based on the script, which is now a true story that exists on paper, but still pure fiction, which is why if you try to find any evidence of any of the events in ""based on true stories"" you will either find you need to allowed access to the film studios script archives, or discover that as much as it is based on an actual true story is that a woman really did visit a supermarket on the 4th of October 1982, only she did not buy eggs, she bought gum, but eggs was much more interesting to the actual films story telling.",3,Better then Paranormal Activity,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,3162,"['did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'especially', 'knowing', 'was', 'companies', 'version', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'was', 'last', 'years', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'make', 'promoting', 'hell', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'Activity', 'failed', 'deliver', 'anything', 'much', 'more', 'then', 'low', 'budget', 'snore', 'fest', 'few', 'sounds', 'thrown', 'top', 'so', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'getting', 'sequel', 'surely', 'enough', 'had', 'go', 'give', 'peace', 'mind', 'idiots', 'leaving', 'graffiti', 'internet', 'walls', 'how', 'exciting', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'proper', 'horror', 'movies', 'not', 'what', 'teeny', 'magazines', 'think', 'supposedly', 'cool', 'next', 'issue', 'sale', 'So', 'wasting', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'abusing', 'who', 'praised', 'sequel', 'coming', 'PA', 'noticed', 'was', 'also', 'mention', 'other', 'movie', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'few', 'people', 'where', 'saying', 'was', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'Activity', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'just', 'have', 'opinion', 'debate', 'know', 'heck', 'internet', 'now', 'days', 'who', 'pay', 'checked', 'out', 'Entity', 'going', 'expecting', 'hate', 'passion', 'just', 'hated', 'activity', 'now', 'feel', 'guilty', 'having', 'downloaded', 'think', 'will', 'send', 'company', 'check', '3', 'saying', 'was', 'worth', 'will', 'wait', 'till', 'DVD', 'cheapie', 'bin.Well', 'now', 'can', 'say', 'low', 'budget', 'snore', 'fest', 'script', 'over-promoted', 'overrated', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'decent', 'movie', 'thing', 'Hollyweed', 'someone', 'script', 'passed', 'studio', 'studio', 'looking', 'someone', 'make', 'way', 'companies', 'agree', 'do', 'needs', 'be', 'lot', 'changes', 'script', 'writers', 'say', 'move', 'next', 'studio', 'leaving', 'previous', 'studio', 'thinking', 'euhh', 'who', 'script', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'so', 'who', 'was', 'original', 'script', 'Entity', 'Activity', 'Entity', 'definitely', 'had', 'better', 'writers', 'actors', 'well', 'chubby', 'chick', 'Activity', 'was', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'movie', 'thumbs', 'up', 'based', 'how', '1', 'person', 'movie', 'looked', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'thought', 'put', 'rest', 'movie.Still', 'Entity', 'not', 'something', 'am', 'praising', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'i', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'decent', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'Activity', '..', 'one', 'lose', 'points', 'trying', 'CLAIM', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'really', 'wish', 'Hollyweed', 'would', 'stop', 'trying', 'promote', 'things', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'idiot', 'days', 'knows', 'when', 'see', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'based', 'script', 'now', 'true', 'story', 'paper', 'still', 'pure', 'fiction', 'why', 'try', 'find', 'evidence', 'events', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'will', 'either', 'find', 'need', 'allowed', 'access', 'film', 'studios', 'script', 'archives', 'discover', 'as', 'much', 'based', 'actual', 'true', 'story', 'woman', 'really', 'did', 'visit', 'supermarket', '4th', 'October', '1982', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'eggs', 'bought', 'gum', 'eggs', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'actual', 'films', 'story', 'telling']",N/A

This is not a good Mockbuster and for that I am sad.It's a rip off, pulling from Exorcist, Entity, and of course Paranormal Activity.  It's so very badly done.  The entire film reeks of really bad logic flaws that most Mockbusters manage to avoid in all their low budget glory.  For example: a ghost walks on the ceiling so let's hang bells on wire at foot level because surely that will work.  Wait, it does?The biggest problem with this Mockbuster was that they couldn't use that fishing wire they were employing to actually film the paranormal scenes.  What sort of freaky German ghost cretin closes a closet door before molesting a girl in her sleep?  I mean, why bother?  They aren't going to see your face!  Especially since her brother has no qualms about filming her breasts multiple times, and is far more concerned with holding the camera than helping her; you're a ghost, you aren't even related to her.  Turn on the radio to some Barry White and get jiggy with it Maron!The set was painfully sparse and eye offensive, I mean, pink and green pillows on outdoor furniture serving as living room accoutrements?  How gauche!  Even worse you take the time to clean your ceiling of ghost footprints made by the ashes of your deceased loved one (the father / husband of the family) and yet you don't remove the ink on the glass top coffee table that wipes away clean in one scene and is impervious the next?  Poor form, bad cleaning, tsk tsk.Obviously we never learn why the boy doesn't just call the police since there's a lapse between their deaths and his arrival, or why his sister makes that really bad fake choking noise, or even, well...anything.  I don't want to know where that ghost had his nether regions!There are some amusing Mockbusters out there, but for the most part I was trying to figure out how they couldn't manage to close doors with fishing line or have footprints of different shapes, and how you could (on the door note) even live in a house with nothing being flush and creaking all the time.

I loved Paranormal Activity, so I really wanted to like this, but there are more problems than good things about the picture.  The good things are that it follows a successful formula(just not as well) and the daughter's boobs.  They make sure she is in low cut tops and bras the entire film.  That is enough for you to stick around for the boob shots at the end.  The problems are that the activity is just over the top right away.  There is no slow believable build to a climax.  I certainly would not sit back and let a spirit assault me for 16 nights and do nothing but film the insanity.

1297319,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002WSB5RU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Paranormal Entity (Shane van Dyke, 2009)The Asylum strikes again. Take a recently-released (and by ""recently"" I mean ""a couple of months ago or less"") theatrical flick that made it big, rip it off, slap a very close name on it, and release it direct to video. This is becoming a common-enough occurrence at The Asylum (a company founded by disenfranchised folks who left Village Roadshow Pictures back in the late nineties) that Rolf Potts, writing in The New York Times in 2007, dubbed many of Asylum's releases ""mockbusters"". Transformers becomes Transmorphers (and the sequel, of course: Transmorphers: Fall of Man), Pirates of the Caribbean becomes Pirates of Treasure Island. Paranormal Activity becomes Paranormal Entity, though in this unsurprisingly crappy ripoff by Shane van Dyke (Transmorphers: Fall of Man, and Dick van Dyke's grandson), he at least added an interesting twist: instead of being a straight rip-off of Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Entity splices the two films referenced in its title, Paranormal Activity and The Entity. And, actually, if you want to take this really, really far, crosses the result with The Poughkeepsie Tapes, John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine)'s second feature. Don't get me wrong, it's still unmitigated crap, but at least it's more amusing to play spot-the-influence here than it is in most Asylum flicks.In case you missed the movies this is ripped off from, a quick synopsis: this is supposed to be actual footage documented by Thomas Finley (van Dyke) at the request of paranormal investigator Edgar Lauren (Inception's Norman Saleet, much better known as a songwriter than an actor) of a haunting. We're told at the beginning of the movie that Thomas Finley has been charged with the murder of Edgar Lauren and the rape and murder of his sister Samantha (Abbey of Thelema's Erin Marie Hogan), so there's no real mystery about who the final girl--umm, boy--is here. Other than Thomas and Samantha's mom Ellen (Shut Up and Kiss Me's Fia Perera), these are the only characters in the film. Aside, of course, from the title creature.Once I realized that there was a strong Entity subtext here (and it took me about five minutes after they mention Thomas is charged with ""the rape and murder"" of Samantha for that to happen), I had some hopes for the movie's special effects budget. Who that has seen The Entity will ever forget the ghost pawing at Barbara Hershey's [censored for Amazon consumption]? (Not only because it's so prurient, but thirty years ago it was also cutting-edge stuff.) No such luck here, unfortunately; van Dyke is nowhere near as capable a director as Sidney J. Furie, not that that should surprise anyone, and ""cutting-edge"" is not a term anywhere in his vocabulary. This plays out exactly as you think it will, with a bit of nudity that Paranormal Activity was lacking, but otherwise there's nothing at all original to be found here.

That is normally the layout for a haunted affair between four walls and a family, and this movie is no different. The people set up cameras in their home (three, on tripods), utilize a handicam, and resort to other things to see if they can figure out what is trying to take them down. See, something is visiting Sam, the teenage female of the group, and it is becoming more and more violent as this progresses. And, of course, leaving the house is not an option so they do what everyone else does. They call in a person ""who knows,"" and everything gets tangled and terrible.This is a movie that I really could not find redemetion in - and i tried. There were some parts in it that made it look like the movie was going to take off, sure, but these parts were just foreplay for an ending that was terrible. You already knew what was going to happen, too, because the beginning of the movie told you. Yes, it said who was going to die, how it was going to play out, and that these moments were found a year after the event and were published by the family to clear up what had gone on in that house.Aside from a lot of yawning and one - count it, one - moment of creepy footprints, I would say that yawning was the only thing that went on there.I could dog on the movie about quality, the cheap budget, the actors, and the terrible plot for paragraghs on end but I will leave you with this warning instead. Watch the movie, take someone else's advice, and you wil want to write a review like this. you will find yourself murmuring throughout the movie, too, wondering if you should fast-forward or wait until what you know is going to happen. And the part you know is going to happen will come, only it does not give you what it has promised. The doom it says happened IS NOT TAPED - only a fraction of the time is - and that is maddening.I cannot say that this movie was bad enough times to really get across what I'm feeling now. Do not pick this up, please, for the sake of those yet to be born - it might cause a rift in the universe and destroy creation (how's that for a pleading?).",1,"The world is flat, Columbus was a great man, and this movie is fantastic (You guess it - lies come in threes)",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2152,"['home', 'houses', 'something', 'more', 'occupants', 'understand', 'normally', 'layout', 'haunted', 'affair', 'four', 'walls', 'family', 'movie', 'different', 'people', 'set', 'up', 'cameras', 'home', 'three', 'tripods', 'utilize', 'handicam', 'resort', 'other', 'things', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'See', 'something', 'visiting', 'Sam', 'teenage', 'female', 'group', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'violent', 'course', 'leaving', 'house', 'not', 'option', 'do', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'call', 'person', 'who', 'everything', 'tangled', 'terrible.This', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'redemetion', 'i', 'tried', 'were', 'parts', 'made', 'look', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'off', 'sure', 'parts', 'were', 'just', 'foreplay', 'ending', 'was', 'terrible', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'too', 'beginning', 'movie', 'told', 'Yes', 'said', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'moments', 'were', 'found', 'year', 'event', 'were', 'published', 'family', 'clear', 'up', 'what', 'had', 'gone', 'house.Aside', 'lot', 'yawning', 'one', 'count', 'one', 'moment', 'creepy', 'footprints', 'would', 'say', 'yawning', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'went', 'there.I', 'could', 'dog', 'movie', 'quality', 'cheap', 'budget', 'actors', 'terrible', 'plot', 'paragraghs', 'end', 'will', 'leave', 'warning', 'instead', 'Watch', 'movie', 'take', 'someone', 'else', 'advice', 'wil', 'want', 'write', 'review', 'will', 'find', 'murmuring', 'movie', 'too', 'wondering', 'should', 'fast-forward', 'wait', 'what', 'know', 'going', 'happen', 'part', 'know', 'going', 'happen', 'will', 'come', 'only', 'not', 'give', 'what', 'promised', 'doom', 'happened', 'IS', 'NOT', 'TAPED', 'only', 'fraction', 'time', 'maddening.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'what', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'now', 'Do', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'please', 'sake', 'yet', 'be', 'born', 'might', 'cause', 'rift', 'universe', 'destroy', 'creation', 'how', 'pleading']",N/A
