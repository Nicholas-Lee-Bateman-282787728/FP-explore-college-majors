I am so happy that they showed Barry Sanders who was my inspiration as a teenager. And how can anyone forget that graceful catch by Lynn Swann. This DVD brings you in categories of hall of famers from the past and the players who would be inducted in the future. Although I enjoyed the Greatest Superbowl DVD a little more, this DVD is a must for all NFL fans.

1010524,AP3B615GM191G,B000H6SXNI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[10, 12]","For fans of the current National Football League, which is now far and away the most popular professional sporting league in American history, it is often difficult to imagine a time when not every game (or any game) was on TV, and not every second was scrutinized by round-the-clock media coverage.  This DVD takes fans back to a simpler time and gives a nice little history lesson on some of the players, coaches, and personalities that paved the way for the success the league enjoys today.Though technically out to document the ""greatest NFL players and coaches"", this DVD in all actuality focuses primarily on players from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s (or even earlier) and gives them their ""fair due"" in an age when fans often times don't care about the rich history of the game.  Though I knew most of the names, it was still interesting to put a face to them, see them in action and hear their thoughts about playing the game they loved.  Names like Red Grange, Jim Brown, Otto Graham, and Gale Sayers may not resonate with young fans, but this program shows how truly important they were in terms of popularizing televised football.Usually, it is only baseball that gets a good reputation for having a rich, vibrant history dating back many, many years, but this show proves that football has an interesting past of its own.  Thus, I would recommend this DVD to any football-lovers out there.  Older fans will become awash in nostalgia, while younger viewers will be treated to a history lesson about the game they currently obsess over.",4,A Great History Lesson For More Recent Fans,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,1541,"['fans', 'current', 'National', 'Football', 'League', 'now', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'popular', 'professional', 'sporting', 'league', 'American', 'history', 'often', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'time', 'when', 'not', 'game', 'game', 'was', 'TV', 'not', 'second', 'was', 'scrutinized', 'round-the-clock', 'media', 'coverage', 'DVD', 'fans', 'back', 'simpler', 'time', 'nice', 'little', 'history', 'lesson', 'players', 'coaches', 'personalities', 'paved', 'way', 'success', 'league', 'technically', 'document', 'greatest', 'NFL', 'players', 'coaches', 'DVD', 'actuality', 'primarily', 'players', '1950s', '60s', '70s', 'even', 'earlier', 'fair', 'due', 'age', 'when', 'fans', 'often', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'rich', 'history', 'game', 'knew', 'most', 'names', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'put', 'face', 'see', 'action', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'playing', 'game', 'loved', 'Names', 'Red', 'Grange', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Otto', 'Graham', 'Gale', 'Sayers', 'may', 'not', 'resonate', 'young', 'fans', 'program', 'how', 'truly', 'important', 'were', 'terms', 'popularizing', 'televised', 'football.Usually', 'only', 'baseball', 'good', 'reputation', 'having', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'history', 'dating', 'back', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'show', 'football', 'interesting', 'past', 'own', 'Thus', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'football-lovers', 'there', 'Older', 'fans', 'will', 'become', 'awash', 'nostalgia', 'younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'history', 'lesson', 'game', 'currently', 'obsess', 'over']",The Greatest NFL Players and Coaches
