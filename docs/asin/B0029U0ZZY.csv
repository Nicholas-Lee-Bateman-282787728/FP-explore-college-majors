You don't have to be British to appreciate it (I'm American), either.  Be sure you get the Artiflix version (the one with red curtains on the cover), instead of the Synergy one that has the silver background and picture of David Tomlinson and Margaret Rutherford.  The Artiflix one has much better sound quality, whereas I couldn't understand more than half the words (and thus couldn't appreciate it or even follow the plot) on the Synergy one.

This film was a rollicking lot of fun.  The story is &#34;almost&#34; believable and really enjoyable to watch.  Margaret Rutherford provided her usual riotous performance.

1257258,AWI9GDTFUZZ9K,B0029U0ZZY,DAVID G. MCHALE IV,"[59, 60]","What is great about this old British film is that it is just plain deliciously fun! Some people gawk at the use of that word to describe something pleasureable, but I find it perfect for this mostly (unfortunetly) forgotten film. 1952's CASTLE IN THE AIR is witty, charming, and has a stellar cast throughout. This is really David Tomlinson's movie as he is truely brilliant as the Scottish Laird who's desperately trying to keep his sinking castle financially afloat. American audiences will most remember Tomlinson from Disney's 1964's megasmash Mary Poppins. Margaret Rutherford effortly shines as well, as one of the castles tenants who thinks the Laird is really the rightful King of Scotland - yes she is a bit eccentric, but afterall we are talking about Margaret Rutherford performance! I am a big fan of Miss Rutherford's and only which her part was a little bit larger. Can't say this was her most memorable role, but a perfect addition to this solid cast through and through. The humor revolves around the Laird's awful financially straped situation, and the desperate measures by which he and his loyal staff do to not end up in the poor house. At times the castle is a Bed & Breakfast and they even give ""Estate Tours"" to help raise runds. Between the tenants, bill collectors, an American guest, a repressed romance, tourers, mice, and a ghost - you have vintage old school, old world British humour at its best!  I also have to mention the often huge amazing sets and the adorable silly ghost named Emmentrude that helps the Laird at just the right times. My only complaint is not with the picture itself, but with the lousy transfer DVD quality they have for this particular disc. This really is an enchanting old film and it deserves a far better treatment that it has gotton here. Unfortunitely at this time of this review its the only way to own a copy of it on DVD, and being a fan I'd rather have a not so great copy than none at all. Despite the crappy transfer, I do love this film and recommend this bit of old fashioned fun to anyone who find a glimmer joy and inquirey to the words above.

1257259,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0029U0ZZY,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Be forewarned, the transfer quality is abysmal.  The tonal values are on the muddy side of gray, the picture is a hazard of splotches, all scratchy and bent out of shape.  The images look to be out of alignment, nothing is in focus.  The only thing worse is the sound.  Sometimes it's impossible to hear a line of dialog here and there.  Whoever was responsible for producing this crappy DVD should be fired.  0 for not even making the effort.As for the film, it's based on a play by Alan Melville (who also had a hand in adapting it for the screen).  It is, for the most part, an amusing story of a man and his castle (David Tomlinson as the Earl of Locharne).  He makes do by renting out rooms and foraging for food where he can.  ""What do you shoot around here?""  My neighbor's grouse and creditors if they come in range.""  He also gives guided tours of the place, payment first.  There's a handy ghost on call.  And a daft old lady (Margaret Rutherford) intent on crowning him King of Scotland.  It's insubstantial fare but just amusing enough to entertain.  I bought it primarily for Margaret Rutherford but the rest of the cast is exceptional as well.  It is a funny idea.  It could have been executed better.  Getting around the problem of the hideous transfer is its greatest obstacle.
