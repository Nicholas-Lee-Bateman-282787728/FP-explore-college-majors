817301,A29EIYMO50BX3I,B0001Z3HIG,Andrea,"[0, 0]","Is this movie cheesy? Yes. But that's classic Disney for you. It's fluffy, family-friendly fun. It's lightyears away from what Disney airs now. I'm nearly 21 years old and I STILL think this is one of Disney's best movies. It has a message that resonates with all young girls and women. I don't know where these angry parents are getting the idea that it's a &#34;bad influence&#34; on young girls because I don't see that at all.I have been reading the books since I was 9 years old, just bought all the bind-up books recently so I could finish the series. Both the books and the film have a positive message about diversity and following your dreams. I see nothing negative in trying to teach young girls to have confidence in themselves and to go after their dreams, to believe they can accomplish anything they want when they put their minds to it.If you have read the books, the movie has made some slight changes (Aqua's twin sister Angie is not included in the films, for example). Nevertheless, it's a great film. It shows young girls that diversity exists. Galleria is half black and half Italian. Chanel is a mixture of several Hispanic cultures. Aqua is from the South and Dorinda is a white foster child who doesn't have a lot of money. The girls are all good friends, despite their differences, and come together to pursue their dream of being pop singers.Being an aspiring musician myself, I totally relate with this film. There are going to be people out there, not just in the entertainment or music industry, but out there in general who will want to change who you are for their own personal gain. These girls face that challenge of following someone else's ideas for the pursuit of fame, or staying true to themselves and to each other to pursue their dreams on their OWN terms and no one else's. That's a far more powerful message than most children's films have to offer these days. Now more than ever we should be teaching our young girls and women that they should believe in themselves and not be pushed into doing anything they don't want to. I would show this to any young daughter or granddaughter out there in a heartbeat. The girls in this film are by no means rich or spoiled. Galleria begins getting a big head because of all the fame but soon realizes that no one wants to be friends with her anymore because of it.Besides an empowering, universal message, this film also has some great music. I'm disappointed that they did not record the songs that were featured in the books written by Deborah Gregory (Welcome to the Glitterdome, Wannabe Stars in the Jiggy Jungle, Shop in the Name of Love, More Pounce to the Ounce, It's Raining Benjamins, etc.) because I'd really like to know how the author intended for them to sound, but the songs that are included in the film are great as well. All the songs sung by The Cheetah Girls have empowering messages for young girls about staying true to themselves, to their friends, and being strong.Is the ending totally predictable and cheesy? Yes. But it wouldn't be a Disney film without a happy ending now would it? As I said, I'm almost 21 years old and I STILL love this movie just as much as I did ten years ago. I recommend it for any girl of any age out there. There are also 2 sequels to this film: The Cheetah Girls 2 and One World.",5,Fun Family Film,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,3315,"['movie', 'cheesy', 'Yes', 'classic', 'Disney', 'fluffy', 'family-friendly', 'fun', 'lightyears', 'away', 'what', 'Disney', 'airs', 'now', ""'m"", 'nearly', '21', 'years', 'old', 'STILL', 'think', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'movies', 'message', 'young', 'girls', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'angry', 'parents', 'are', 'getting', 'idea', '34', 'bad', 'influence', '34', 'young', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'all.I', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'books', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'bought', 'bind-up', 'books', 'recently', 'could', 'finish', 'series', 'books', 'film', 'have', 'positive', 'message', 'diversity', 'following', 'dreams', 'see', 'nothing', 'negative', 'trying', 'teach', 'young', 'girls', 'have', 'confidence', 'go', 'dreams', 'believe', 'can', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'want', 'when', 'put', 'minds', 'it.If', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'movie', 'made', 'slight', 'changes', 'Aqua', 'twin', 'sister', 'Angie', 'not', 'included', 'films', 'example', 'Nevertheless', 'great', 'film', 'young', 'girls', 'diversity', 'exists', 'Galleria', 'half', 'black', 'half', 'Italian', 'Chanel', 'mixture', 'several', 'Hispanic', 'cultures', 'Aqua', 'South', 'Dorinda', 'white', 'foster', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'money', 'girls', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'differences', 'come', 'together', 'pursue', 'dream', 'being', 'pop', 'singers.Being', 'aspiring', 'musician', 'totally', 'relate', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'people', 'there', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment', 'music', 'industry', 'there', 'general', 'who', 'will', 'want', 'change', 'who', 'are', 'own', 'personal', 'gain', 'girls', 'face', 'challenge', 'following', 'someone', 'else', 'ideas', 'pursuit', 'fame', 'staying', 'true', 'other', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'OWN', 'terms', 'one', 'else', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'message', 'most', 'children', 'films', 'have', 'offer', 'days', 'Now', 'more', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'teaching', 'young', 'girls', 'women', 'should', 'believe', 'not', 'be', 'pushed', 'doing', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'would', 'show', 'young', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'there', 'heartbeat', 'girls', 'film', 'are', 'means', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'Galleria', 'getting', 'big', 'head', 'fame', 'soon', 'one', 'be', 'friends', 'anymore', 'it.Besides', 'empowering', 'universal', 'message', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'music', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'record', 'songs', 'were', 'featured', 'books', 'written', 'Deborah', 'Gregory', 'Welcome', 'Glitterdome', 'Wannabe', 'Stars', 'Jiggy', 'Jungle', 'Shop', 'Name', 'Love', 'More', 'Pounce', 'Ounce', 'Raining', 'Benjamins', 'etc', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'know', 'how', 'author', 'intended', 'sound', 'songs', 'are', 'included', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'songs', 'sung', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', 'have', 'empowering', 'messages', 'young', 'girls', 'staying', 'true', 'friends', 'being', 'strong.Is', 'ending', 'totally', 'predictable', 'cheesy', 'Yes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Disney', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'now', 'would', 'said', ""'m"", 'almost', '21', 'years', 'old', 'STILL', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'recommend', 'girl', 'age', 'there', 'are', 'also', '2', 'sequels', 'film', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', '2', 'One', 'World']",N/A

817309,A29L2RN5D8C0HM,B0001Z3HIG,"Prism Light ""Prism""","[1, 2]","Galeria, Chanel, Dorinda, and Aqua make up ""The Cheetah Girls"", a girl group who dreams of fame and fortune.  What starts out as entering the school talent show turns into planning a single with hot record producer ""Jackel Johnson"".  Each girl (Except for Aqua; she's hardly mentioned.) has an obstacle or two to over come before they can realize what's really important in their lives, and in their career.  But if they can't solve their problems in time, it could be the end of their music dreams, AND their friendship.This movie (based on the book series) starts out really goofy.  Everyone is ""cool"", and everyone uses ""cool"" words like ""Cheetahlicious"", and all sorts of other jibber-jabber that is hard to understand at first.  To make it short: it's pretty sickening.  But towards the middle, there starts to be more drama, and less time for ""Cheetah Chatter"", so things start to pick up and be less gagly.  I won't say anything about the ending except that I'm sure that viewers will be pleased.  Overall, this is a movie that will appeal to younger girls.  If you're a teenager, you'll probably turn the movie off before the middle, since there are so many better movies out there to watch.  I mean, don't get me wrong!  When I was a year or two younger, I LOVED ""The Cheetah Girls"".  But now that I'm older, I could care less if it comes on T.V. and I miss it.  It's a good tween movie, but it's nothing worthy of ""Top Movie In America"", or ""Academy Award Nominee"".  So if you're looking for a movie with good music, and an at least decent storyline, then I recommend ""The Cheetah Girls"".  But I also recommend that you watch it on T.V. and don't waste your money buying it on video unless you're a huge fan.",3,It Gets Better,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,1718,"['Galeria', 'Chanel', 'Dorinda', 'Aqua', 'make', 'up', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', 'girl', 'group', 'who', 'fame', 'fortune', 'What', 'out', 'entering', 'school', 'talent', 'show', 'planning', 'single', 'hot', 'record', 'producer', 'Jackel', 'Johnson', 'girl', 'Aqua', 'hardly', 'mentioned', 'obstacle', 'two', 'come', 'can', 'realize', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'lives', 'career', 'ca', ""n't"", 'solve', 'problems', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'end', 'music', 'dreams', 'friendship.This', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'series', 'out', 'really', 'goofy', 'Everyone', 'cool', 'everyone', 'cool', 'words', 'Cheetahlicious', 'sorts', 'other', 'jibber-jabber', 'hard', 'understand', 'first', 'make', 'short', 'pretty', 'sickening', 'middle', 'be', 'more', 'drama', 'less', 'time', 'Cheetah', 'Chatter', 'so', 'things', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'be', 'less', 'gagly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'ending', ""'m"", 'sure', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'Overall', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'younger', 'girls', ""'re"", 'teenager', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'turn', 'movie', 'middle', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'watch', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'When', 'was', 'year', 'two', 'younger', 'LOVED', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'T.V', 'miss', 'good', 'tween', 'movie', 'nothing', 'worthy', 'Top', 'Movie', 'America', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominee', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'good', 'music', 'least', 'decent', 'storyline', 'then', 'recommend', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', 'also', 'recommend', 'watch', 'T.V', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'video', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan']",N/A
