The two main women are activists in New York's famous movement against police brutality and have to deal with some very intense and realistic twists.  For example, what would you do if you were leading a rally against genuine police brutality and the surviving parent of a victim of a police shooting looses it and shoots a cop ""guarding"" the rally?I thought Rosie Perez did a good job as the girlfriend who isn't totally into the struggle, but has to rise to the occasion when tragedy strikes.The storyline of the father who doesn't accept his mentally disabled son's limitations is Okay, although not that believable to me.",4,Fascinating backdrop,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,716,"['main', 'storyline', 'film', 'only', 'so-so', 'setting', 'context', 'fascinating', 'two', 'main', 'women', 'are', 'activists', 'New', 'York', 'famous', 'movement', 'police', 'brutality', 'have', 'deal', 'very', 'intense', 'realistic', 'twists', 'example', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'leading', 'rally', 'genuine', 'police', 'brutality', 'surviving', 'parent', 'victim', 'police', 'shooting', 'looses', 'shoots', 'cop', 'guarding', 'rally', 'thought', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'totally', 'struggle', 'rise', 'occasion', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes.The', 'storyline', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'accept', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'son', 'limitations', 'Okay', 'not', 'believable']",N/A

I like Seth Rosenfeld, and I thought that he would've taken this film to a better place.  His movies always has good actors.  Although, at times it seems he doesn't know what to do with them.  The story is interesting, but the overall product could've been better.  To me, it seemed as if it were rushed.  You never know that could've been the case.  Either way, I will always support Seth Rosenfeld.  He's got a gift.

699598,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000065AZE,Linda Linguvic,"[10, 11]","This 2001 film stars John Leguisamo as Seymour, a mentally challenged young man on the tough streets of New York.  He has the mind of a five year old, and yearns to be accepted.  His mother, Julie Carmen, a civil rights activist, babies her son and tries to protect him.  His divorced father, Cliff Gorman, tries to deny that anything is wrong with his son.  Rosie Perez, his mother's lover, tries to help him.  And so does a friend, Jeff Rappaport, who tries to teach him to fight and see himself as &quot;king of the jungle.&quot;Seymour's troubled world is shattered when his mother is murdered. That's when everything seems to spin out of control.  The story pulled me in and kept me there because I wanted to see how it would all play out.  Marisa Tomei plays a small role as a tough detective.  And Annabella Sciorra plays the murderer's mother.  It's a fine cast and they all do a good job.I liked the film.  It's tight, moves fast, and introduces some unique and interesting characters.  And John Leguisamo shines in a difficult role.  Recommended.",5,"Unique characters, fine acting and good story.

Salinger: director Seth Zvi Rosenfeld, who presents urban Darwinism through a mental handicap and his parents who hope to find social justice or art, in a city of Survival of the Fittest.  Survival of the Fittest soon turns out to be Survival of the Cruelest, and the random violence against the weak stands in stark contrast with Seymour's final outburst of violence against the world that he does not understand.  Like Salinger's stories, the movie isn't for everyone.  You get it or you don't.  There is no grandeur, no pretty people.  There's not even a hint of big city glamor--only 'jungle' as far as the eye can see.
