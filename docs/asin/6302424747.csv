Kirk Douglas and Kim Novak are perfect in this melodrama, their chemistry is explosive and geez how about Novak's beautiful clothes? Just breahtaking to say the least. This film is a little bit on the slow side but I think this classic tearjerker is worth a viewing or two.

311853,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302424747,Byron Kolln,"[4, 4]","Based on Evan Hunter's bestselling novel, STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET (Richard Quine, 1960) is a fascinating romantic drama, very indicative of the conservative period in which it was made, yet still fresh and vibrant in it's depiction of a pair of married lovebirds whose affair is doomed from the start...Successful architect Larry Coe (Kirk Douglas) and housewife Maggie Gault (Kim Novak) meet during the daily ritual of dropping their kids at the bus-stop.  Larry is married to Eve (Barbara Rush), a woman who'd rather Larry drop his principals and design for money, not artistic freedom.  Maggie married ""the first nice guy that came along"" and has since enjoyed occasional meaningless flings during her husband's various business trips.  Together, they find a rare kind of love.  But how long will it be before their happiness is halted--by the discovery of a loved one, or the cry of a conscience?STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET no doubt raised more than a few eyebrows in it's day, with many comparing it to ""Peyton Place"" in it's themes of peeking through tidy middle-class curtains to discover the debauched lifestyles playing behind.  It's really much more than that.  I've always felt that it shares a closer kinship to the Douglas Sirk melodramas, most specifically ""All That Heaven Allows"".  Though essentially a morality tale, Douglas and Novak add a great deal of sympathy and strength to their characters.  We feel for both these people, because even though they are committing adultery on their partners, we believe their own love-bond is stronger and more valid than their respective married unions.Another reviewer has pointed out the similarity between Kim Novak's character in this movie and her most famous role, Madeleine Elster, in ""Vertigo"".  Both share the same haunted, elusive quality.  We never really feel that we know her.  It's one of the many reasons why I count Novak among my all-time favourite actresses.  It's always a pleasure to see Ms Novak work her magic on the screen.Director Richard Quine always loved working with Kim Novak, and had previously guided her through 1954's ""Pushover"" (her official movie debut) and ""Bell, Book and Candle"" in 1958; reuniting with her again for the underrated comedy gem ""The Notorious Landlady"" two years after this film.  STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET also features familiar Quine faces Ernie Kovacs (""Bell, Book and Candle"", ""It Happened to Jane"") and Paul Picerni (""Operation Mad Ball"").Also keep your eyes peeled for talented Broadway actress Helen Gallagher playing neighbour Betty Anders, and former Disney moppet Roberta 'Jymme' Shore as the babysitter.

311854,AS558SNWF1DXG,6302424747,Clare Quilty,"[6, 7]","A soap opera, sure, but one that's perfectly extravagant and surprisingly grown up, with unexpected moments of surprise and tension -- ""Strangers,"" it's worth noting, has the best, most nerve-wracking unanswered phone call this side of ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" and that's by no means faint praise.Kirk Douglas plays a driven, artistically-inclined, vaguely-Zen-without-saying-Zen architect who builds high-dollar homes around Los Angeles. He's contentedly married but you couldn't call it ""happily"" -- to turn the old phrase, ""his wife just doesn't understand him."" Seriously.Kim Novak is a troubled neighbor Douglas' character meets, befriends and then falls into an affair with. No way around it -- she's beautiful but she is seriously damaged goods and while an expensive big studio film from 1960 can't lay out everything we'd like to know about her past, it's still surprisingly frank: Her husband seems to have gone cold toward her following a rape she may or may not have allowed to happen.We follow the couple through their rendezvous, awkward meetings and changes of favor, and the movie really takes its time establishing their environment and telling their story. It should be boring but it isn't. Part of that is due to the overall backdrop -- with its moneyed flavors, stitch-perfect clothes, painstakingly appointed sets and barely covered subtext, ""Strangers"" feels right in line with Douglas Sirk from the same period. But director Richard Quine and screenwriter Evan Hunter eschew Sirk's overt melodrama and lace the story with some unexpected maturity.Novak, her blonde hair tinted vaguely violet, plays the whole movie on edge, phrasing her lines with tense whispers that shouldn't work but mostly kind of do.Walter Matthau is also good as a sleepy-eyed suburban shark who makes big trouble for nice people, and the character could've supplied the basis for a fascinating film all on his own. As he and his son stroll the neighborhood, Matthau spies a beautiful housewife and says to his boy, who is about ten years old, ""Love 'em all."" Funny for a second, but hearing the leer in that friendly, familiar voice made my skin crawl.Ernie Kovacs is also on-hand as one of Douglas' clients, a best-selling author. Kovacs doesn't appear to have a literary bone in his body (jet pilot, clothing magnate, casino owner and lottery winner all would've been more suitable-seeming careers for this character) but he sells their friendship far better than he sells the character. Plus, it's Ernie Kovacs, which is cool period casting you can't argue with.I'm still working out the ending -- maybe it's a cop-out, but it's also devastating. Throughout the film, Douglas and Novak are constantly putting their fling on hold, then rushing back to each other, apologizing and basically asking to never fight again. Onscreen, it seems wildly indecisive and chain-yanking, but it also carries truth. That's how passion frequently operates. So at the end (SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT) when Douglas tells Novak he's going off to Hawaii to ""build a city"" and he's taking his wife and kids instead of her ... we have to wonder if that's really his final answer. Or an answer dictated by the studio. On top of which, hours earlier Douglas' wife banished him from her life with blunt economy, only to return almost immediately and successfully take it all back.These questions and concerns, however, pale in harsh light of the final shot in which Novak, freshly dumped and taking it well, almost immediately encounters another smiling man (the same way she met Douglas, the same way she met the man who raped her) and drives away, crying, screwed again. It looks like a gimmick ending, it feels like a gimmick ending, but as it extends to show us her long drive away from something that really should've work out, it asks a particularly bleak question: What the hell is she going to do now?",5,Dancing about architecture,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,3905,"['soap', 'opera', 'sure', 'one', 'perfectly', 'extravagant', 'surprisingly', 'grown', 'up', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'surprise', 'tension', 'Strangers', 'worth', 'noting', 'best', 'most', 'nerve-wracking', 'unanswered', 'phone', 'call', 'side', 'Once', 'Time', 'America', 'means', 'faint', 'praise.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'driven', 'artistically-inclined', 'vaguely-Zen-without-saying-Zen', 'architect', 'who', 'high-dollar', 'homes', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'contentedly', 'married', 'could', ""n't"", 'call', 'happily', 'turn', 'old', 'phrase', 'wife', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Seriously.Kim', 'Novak', 'troubled', 'neighbor', 'Douglas', 'character', 'meets', 'befriends', 'then', 'affair', 'way', 'beautiful', 'seriously', 'damaged', 'goods', 'expensive', 'big', 'studio', 'film', '1960', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lay', 'out', 'everything', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'past', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'frank', 'husband', 'have', 'gone', 'cold', 'following', 'rape', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'allowed', 'happen.We', 'follow', 'couple', 'rendezvous', 'awkward', 'meetings', 'changes', 'favor', 'movie', 'really', 'time', 'establishing', 'environment', 'telling', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'boring', ""n't"", 'Part', 'due', 'overall', 'backdrop', 'moneyed', 'flavors', 'stitch-perfect', 'clothes', 'painstakingly', 'appointed', 'sets', 'barely', 'covered', 'subtext', 'Strangers', 'feels', 'right', 'line', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'same', 'period', 'director', 'Richard', 'Quine', 'screenwriter', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'eschew', 'Sirk', 'overt', 'melodrama', 'lace', 'story', 'unexpected', 'maturity.Novak', 'blonde', 'hair', 'tinted', 'vaguely', 'violet', 'whole', 'movie', 'edge', 'phrasing', 'lines', 'tense', 'whispers', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'mostly', 'kind', 'do.Walter', 'Matthau', 'also', 'good', 'sleepy-eyed', 'suburban', 'shark', 'who', 'big', 'trouble', 'nice', 'people', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'supplied', 'basis', 'fascinating', 'film', 'own', 'son', 'stroll', 'neighborhood', 'Matthau', 'beautiful', 'housewife', 'boy', 'who', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'Love', ""'em"", 'Funny', 'second', 'hearing', 'leer', 'friendly', 'familiar', 'voice', 'made', 'skin', 'crawl.Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'also', 'on-hand', 'one', 'Douglas', 'clients', 'best-selling', 'author', 'Kovacs', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'literary', 'bone', 'body', 'jet', 'pilot', 'clothing', 'magnate', 'casino', 'owner', 'lottery', 'winner', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'suitable-seeming', 'careers', 'character', 'friendship', 'far', 'better', 'character', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'cool', 'period', 'casting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'with.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'working', 'out', 'ending', 'maybe', 'cop-out', 'also', 'devastating', 'film', 'Douglas', 'Novak', 'are', 'constantly', 'putting', 'fling', 'hold', 'then', 'rushing', 'back', 'other', 'apologizing', 'basically', 'asking', 'never', 'fight', 'again', 'Onscreen', 'wildly', 'indecisive', 'chain-yanking', 'also', 'truth', 'how', 'passion', 'frequently', 'So', 'end', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'when', 'Douglas', 'Novak', 'going', 'off', 'Hawaii', 'build', 'city', 'taking', 'wife', 'kids', 'instead', 'have', 'wonder', 'really', 'final', 'answer', 'answer', 'dictated', 'studio', 'top', 'hours', 'earlier', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'banished', 'life', 'blunt', 'economy', 'only', 'return', 'almost', 'immediately', 'successfully', 'take', 'back.These', 'questions', 'concerns', 'however', 'pale', 'harsh', 'light', 'final', 'shot', 'Novak', 'freshly', 'dumped', 'taking', 'well', 'almost', 'immediately', 'smiling', 'man', 'same', 'way', 'met', 'Douglas', 'same', 'way', 'met', 'man', 'who', 'raped', 'away', 'crying', 'screwed', 'again', 'gimmick', 'ending', 'gimmick', 'ending', 'show', 'long', 'drive', 'away', 'something', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'work', 'out', 'particularly', 'bleak', 'question', 'What', 'hell', 'going', 'do', 'now']",N/A
311855,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6302424747,David Von Pein,"[64, 66]","""Strangers When We Meet"" (1960) is simply a magnificent movie. In this reviewer's opinion, the acting performances from every single member of this first-rate cast are brilliant -- from Kirk Douglas to Kim Novak to Ernie Kovacs to Walter Matthau. They are each just perfect here. Also keep an eye peeled for Sue Ane Langdon, who pops up in a brief cameo role.And I certainly don't want to leave out Barbara Rush, who gives a knockout portrayal of Douglas' wife. Rush's final emotion-filled scenes in the film are literally worth a replay every time this movie is watched.Walter Matthau's role in the film is fairly small, but powerful. Walter is thoroughly repulsive here as an aggressively-lecherous, scheming, and oversexed neighbor, who lives just a few doors down from Douglas.Can you imagine that -- Walter Matthau being deemed ""repulsive""? Hardly seems right, does it? But, in this flick, it applies. ""Strangers"" was made at a time when the then-39-year-old Matthau was playing more serious roles in the movies, and before all of his excellent comic parts. Four years after ""Strangers"", Matthau played another rather unlikable character, in 1964's ""Fail-Safe"", which was yet another fine performance by the versatile actor.It's also kind of funny to note (in an ""in-joke"" fashion) that Matthau's character's name in ""Strangers"" is ""Felix"", which is a name that would be closely associated with Walter in the film ""The Odd Couple"" (1968), when Matthau's ""Oscar"" played opposite Jack Lemmon's ""Felix"".Douglas and Novak are ""strangers when they meet"" in the supermarket one day, and they seem to have a genuine chemistry on screen here. I found Kim's ""Maggie"" in this movie very similar in ""icy"" and ""moody"" style to her role two years earlier in Alfred Hitchcock's classic tale, ""Vertigo"". Both of those Novak characters seem to be forever tormented by some inner demons that can never be fully exorcised. But by the end of ""Strangers"", Maggie has shed a great deal of her inner anguish, with the film ending in a bittersweet -- but in my opinion very fitting -- fashion.""Strangers When We Meet"", I think I'm safe in assuming, is one of Kirk Douglas' lesser-known efforts during the man's amazing screen career -- but its relative obscurity doesn't make the movie any less powerful. Douglas is 100% believable in his role here as ""Larry Coe"", an architect who's tired of the drab cookie-cutter assignments that have been served up to him. He wants to design a house that's different. And that's just what he does in the movie.Throughout the film, we can actually see Larry's uniquely-designed, multi-level house take shape, bit by bit. By the film's final reel, the project is completed, and it's a truly stunning home, in my opinion.Larry Coe also has a roving eye for his quite fetching and alluring neighbor (Maggie) -- and despite the fact that each of them is married with young children, Larry and Maggie find their mutual attraction to each other too much to resist, and they begin a love affair.The screenplay for ""Strangers"" was written by Evan Hunter (based on his novel). The film was directed with great style and obvious ""TLC"" by Richard Quine (who also doubled as the movie's producer).The setting is California, circa 1960, and Mr. Quine's excellent use of his beautiful ""CinemaScope"" widescreen (2.35:1) framing comes through with flying colors on this DVD version of the film. The movie was shot in color and the cinematography for both the outdoor and indoor scenes is rich in colorful details, which this DVD from Columbia/Sony exhibits very nicely.There's a scene near the end of the movie that's just spectacular (from a photography and lighting standpoint), with a rainbow of colors on the screen at once -- this scene taking place in Larry's just-finished hilltop home, with the light shining through various tinted panes of window glass in a way that's just simply gorgeous.This adult drama, which is replete with multiple cases of infidelity, could very easily (in my view) have been a real ""snooze-fest"" (aka: a boring 2-hour nightmare to have to sit through). But, instead, it's exactly the opposite -- it comes across as fresh and alive and interesting, all the way through its entire length of 1 hour and 57 minutes.Director/Producer Quine and screenwriter Hunter have made these characters compelling and intriguing -- and just flat-out interesting to watch. Quine and Hunter make us care about these people on screen, from beginning to end. And I'm guessing that this wasn't an easy task, given the rather heavy and somber subject matter that the film deals with.The ""suburban"" feel of the early 1960s comes across very strongly in the film as well. Each frame of the movie reflects the era in which it was made -- and I don't mean that in a negative way whatsoever; to the contrary in fact. That ""feeling"" for the era is something I like very much here. The film began playing in movie houses on Wednesday, June 29th, 1960.I was flabbergasted when I discovered this movie was actually available on the DVD format. It had been on my ""Buy When Available"" list for many moons; but slipped under my radar of new releases when Columbia/Sony streeted this little gem on February 22, 2005. To say the least, I was most pleased when I was finally able to cross this one off of the ""To-Get"" list.This single-disc, single-sided DVD gives us the film in its intended and original 2.35:1 Widescreen video format, and it offers up a dandy-looking Anamorphic (16x9 enhanced) transfer to boot. It just looks great. .... The audio on the disc comes across fine via a 2.0 Dolby Digital Mono soundtrack. Subtitles can be accessed in either English or Japanese.The DVD comes packaged in an Amaray-type plastic Keep Case. There's no Scene Selection paper insert included in the box; but there is the normal Scene Index included on the disc itself (the film is divided up into a modest number of chapters, totalling 12).The DVD's Menus are silent and non-animated, with the Main Menu (and ""Scene"" Menu) sporting an odd, albeit very picturesque, view of the skyline of New York City. (That's ""odd"" only because the movie is not set in New York, and has nothing whatever to do with that city; the film is set entirely in California. And what makes the DVD Main Menu picture of NYC even more peculiar is the fact that it depicts the World Trade Center as part of the New York skyline; the WTC wasn't completed until more than a decade after ""Strangers"" was made. Oh, well, it's still a nice-looking Menu photo nonetheless. A portion of that same New York skyline picture is also used for the DVD's front cover; the packaging photo is cropped, however, and lacks the World Trade Center image.)The only ""Bonus"" material on the DVD are three ""Previews"" (Trailers). But, unfortunately, the original theatrical trailer for ""Strangers When We Meet"" is not included.-----------------To Sum It Up.........""Strangers When We Meet"" is highly recommended -- both the film and this DVD. Anyone who is a fan of intelligently-written motion-picture dramas -- or a fan of Kirk Douglas or the always-lovely Kim Novak -- will have no choice but to admire ""Strangers"" (IMHO).If you haven't done so already, take ""Strangers"" for a spin in your DVD Player as soon as you can. It's a 117-minute journey back to 1960 -- and it's worth the time spent making the trip.",5,A Fabulous Motion Picture (From First Scene To Last),1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,7356,"['Strangers',

311856,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302424747,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 9]","This glossy 1960 melodrama was part of a wave of elegantly mounted Eisenhower-era films that dealt with seemingly normal people caught in situations in which they violate socially acceptable behavior but of course, not without a lot of grief, much of it self-inflicted. The acknowledged master of the genre was German-born filmmaker Douglas Sirk (All That Heaven Allows,Imitation of Life), but this especially soapish entry is definitely cut from the same cloth. Directed by journeyman Richard Quine (Paris When It Sizzles), it doesn't have the Baroque-level sensibilities to make this quite the wallow that Sirk's films have become over the years. Part of the reason is that the story is told mostly from a decidedly male perspective, which appears to run counter to the viewing audience one would expect for this film. It also feels overlong at 117 minutes.Written by Evan Hunter (The Birds) based on his own novel, the plot concerns successful architect Larry Coe frustrated by his inability to live out his Frank Lloyd Wright-level aspirations while married to Eve, a sharp woman whose innate pragmatism encourages him to take on unappealing commercial projects. At the local supermarket, he meets Maggie Gault, beautiful but also married, and sparks are inevitable. She helps him get a commission to build a mid-century stunner of a cliff-side house for commercial novelist Roger Altar. The out-of-the-box design and construction of the house appears to parallel the illicit affair that develops between Larry and Maggie. What's most interesting about the story is not so much the adultery but the motivations behind the affair. Larry is not running away from a shrewish wife but rather looking for a kindred spirit who understands his artistic aspirations, while Maggie is married to an indifferent, probably impotent husband and trying to escape the stigma of ""the other woman"" already lived out by her mother. Nonetheless, what really dates the film is the underlying misogyny toward both Maggie and Eve as both appear victimized by how men define them.Quine gathered an intriguing cast here. Just before taking on Kubrick'sSpartacus, Kirk Douglas can't help but look heroic with his clenched jaw and chiseled features, but he is also surprisingly reserved and life-sized as a suburban father who waits with his children at the bus stop. Still fresh from Hitchcock'sVertigo, Kim Novak uses her glamorous allure and hesitant manner to solid effect here. Truth be told, despite the attractiveness of the leads, the sideline performances are comparatively more interesting - Barbara Rush shifting mercurially from sensible to distraught as Eve; TV comedian Ernie Kovacs likeably vulnerable in a rare dramatic role as Altar; and best of all, a young Walter Matthau as caddish neighbor Felix whose prurient interests become fully exposed when he discovers the affair. There is a particularly unnerving scene between him and Rush that makes you wish Quine took even more chances with the trite story. The movie even comes with a syrupy, overblown theme song with a full orchestra and chorus. Unfortunately, the 2005 DVD offers no extras except previews for three other films. I would have liked to have seen a featurette on the modern Japanese-style house Larry designed.",3,"Adultery, Architecture and a Bit of Misogyny Dominate This Glossy Melodrama",1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,3273,"['glossy', '1960', 'melodrama', 'was', 'part', 'wave', 'elegantly', 'mounted', 'Eisenhower-era', 'films', 'dealt', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'people', 'caught', 'situations', 'violate', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'behavior', 'course', 'not', 'lot', 'grief', 'much', 'self-inflicted', 'acknowledged', 'master', 'genre', 'was', 'German-born', 'filmmaker', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'especially', 'soapish', 'entry', 'definitely', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'Directed', 'journeyman', 'Richard', 'Quine', 'Paris', 'When', 'Sizzles', ""n't"", 'have', 'Baroque-level', 'sensibilities', 'make', 'wallow', 'Sirk', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'years', 'Part', 'reason', 'story', 'told', 'mostly', 'decidedly', 'male', 'perspective', 'run', 'counter', 'viewing', 'audience', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'also', 'overlong', '117', 'minutes.Written', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'Birds', 'based', 'own', 'novel', 'plot', 'concerns', 'successful', 'architect', 'Larry', 'Coe', 'frustrated', 'inability', 'live', 'out', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright-level', 'aspirations', 'married', 'Eve', 'sharp', 'woman', 'innate', 'pragmatism', 'take', 'unappealing', 'commercial', 'projects', 'local', 'supermarket', 'Maggie', 'Gault', 'beautiful', 'also', 'married', 'sparks', 'are', 'inevitable', 'get', 'commission', 'build', 'mid-century', 'stunner', 'cliff-side', 'house', 'commercial', 'novelist', 'Roger', 'Altar', 'out-of-the-box', 'design', 'construction', 'house', 'parallel', 'illicit', 'affair', 'Larry', 'Maggie', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'adultery', 'motivations', 'affair', 'Larry', 'not', 'running', 'away', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'rather', 'looking', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'who', 'artistic', 'aspirations', 'Maggie', 'married', 'indifferent', 'probably', 'impotent', 'husband', 'trying', 'escape', 'stigma', 'other', 'woman', 'already', 'lived', 'out', 'mother', 'Nonetheless', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'underlying', 'misogyny', 'Maggie', 'Eve', 'victimized', 'how', 'men', 'define', 'them.Quine', 'gathered', 'intriguing', 'cast', 'here', 'Just', 'taking', ""Kubrick'sSpartacus"", 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'heroic', 'clenched', 'jaw', 'chiseled', 'features', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'reserved', 'life-sized', 'suburban', 'father', 'who', 'children', 'bus', 'stop', 'Still', 'fresh', ""Hitchcock'sVertigo"", 'Kim', 'Novak', 'glamorous', 'allure', 'hesitant', 'manner', 'solid', 'effect', 'here', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'attractiveness', 'leads', 'sideline', 'performances', 'are', 'comparatively', 'more', 'interesting', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'shifting', 'mercurially', 'sensible', 'distraught', 'Eve', 'TV', 'comedian', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'likeably', 'vulnerable', 'rare', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Altar', 'best', 'young', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'caddish', 'neighbor', 'Felix', 'prurient', 'interests', 'become', 'fully', 'exposed', 'when', 'affair', 'particularly', 'unnerving', 'scene', 'Rush', 'wish', 'Quine', 'took', 'even', 'more', 'chances', 'trite', 'story', 'movie', 'even', 'syrupy', 'overblown', 'theme', 'song', 'full', 'orchestra', 'chorus', 'Unfortunately', '2005', 'DVD', 'extras', 'previews', 'three', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'featurette', 'modern', 'Japanese-style', 'house', 'Larry', 'designed']",N/A

It was a time when stars were stars and there was no more to it. It really had nothing to do with their private lives but their onscreen performance and the places they could take us to. It was a great era of escapism and fantasy. Unfortunately those days are gone and everything is judged on reality rather than pure entertainment.We did not have too many movie critics to tell us what we shoud be seeing. We had only our personal aspirations and experiences to be able to relate to the movie of the week. It was innocent and it was naive but it was great. This is a film for those who want to revisit the days when it was ok to  sit goggle eyed in the cinema and escape for a while. i highly recommend it.I recently bought this on dvd and watched it again.

Perhaps Kirk Douglas was the epitome of the true artist (who will not sacrifice his talents for filthy lucre).  Whereas Douglas had a strong personality, Kim Novak, playing the cool, icy blonde type Hitchcock had a thing for, had a weak one, but Douglas obviously saw something in her besides her beauty (he even tells her she's not that beautiful when they happen to meet in the grocery store; something else about her draws him to her, but what?)--he fell in love with her (and was willing to give up a plum job in Hawaii to stay in Vermont, where I believe this was set, though many reviewers are saying California?, to stay near to her).  He probably would have left his wife had she not told him she couldn't live without him and practically begged him not to leave her, yet Barbara Rush (who plays Douglas's wife) did it in such a way that I, even with my feminist leanings, did not find sickening and typical of the era.As for Novak's husband, he came across as either a religious fundamentalist who doesn't believe in frequent sex (even within the bonds of marriage unless for procreational purposes) or a closet homosexual.  He just didn't seem very excited seeing Kim Novak wearing a black brassiere (but they didn't have Viagra back then), leaving his wife unfulfilled sexually.It was easy to see why Novak strayed, but as for Douglas--all I could see was that Barbara Rush, an attractive brunette, wasn't very understanding about her husband's work (she was a practical woman--providing for the family came first, the art came second), but this didn't make her a monster.  Douglas simply coveted his neighbor's wife when he first looked upon her, and she knew she would want him, too, if she let herself get close to him.  I did think it was best Novak's husband never found out because husbands aren't nearly as forgiving as wives, even though his inattentiveness did play a part in her infidelity (not excusing her for it, for the vows do say, ""in sickness and in health"").Though adultery is wrong (I don't think anyone would dispute that fact), I did feel for Novak at the end, and it would have been so much easier had Douglas's wife been a shrew who didn't love him anymore and Novak's husband not worshiped her, but too many people would have been hurt.  I don't like to see two people who truly love each other be separated, but there was really no other way for this to end without promoting destroying families in the pursuit of happiness by destroying another's.Ernie Kovacs' comedic talent was wasted here (watch him in ""North to Alaska"" instead).""Strangers"" is somewhat entertaining the first time, but it isn't a movie I would care to watch again.",3,Lovers when we part (2.5 stars),1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,2753,"['am', 'guessing', 'house', 'movie', 'was', 'metaphorical', 'something', 'what', 'Perhaps', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'was', 'epitome', 'true', 'artist', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'talents', 'filthy', 'lucre', 'Whereas', 'Douglas', 'had', 'strong', 'personality', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'playing', 'cool', 'icy', 'blonde', 'type', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'thing', 'had', 'weak', 'one', 'Douglas', 'obviously', 'saw', 'something', 'beauty', 'even', 'not', 'beautiful', 'when', 'happen', 'meet', 'grocery', 'store', 'something', 'else', 'draws', 'what', 'fell', 'love', 'was', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'plum', 'job', 'Hawaii', 'stay', 'Vermont', 'where', 'believe', 'was', 'set', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'saying', 'California', 'stay', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'wife', 'had', 'not', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'practically', 'begged', 'not', 'leave', 'yet', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'who', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'did', 'way', 'even', 'feminist', 'leanings', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'sickening', 'typical', 'era.As', 'Novak', 'husband', 'came', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'frequent', 'sex', 'even', 'bonds', 'marriage', 'procreational', 'purposes', 'closet', 'homosexual', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'excited', 'seeing', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'wearing', 'black', 'brassiere', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Viagra', 'back', 'then', 'leaving', 'wife', 'unfulfilled', 'sexually.It', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Novak', 'strayed', 'Douglas', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'attractive', 'brunette', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'understanding', 'husband', 'work', 'was', 'practical', 'woman', 'providing', 'family', 'came', 'first', 'art', 'came', 'second', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'monster', 'Douglas', 'simply', 'coveted', 'neighbor', 'wife', 'when', 'first', 'looked', 'knew', 'would', 'want', 'too', 'let', 'get', 'close', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'Novak', 'husband', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'husbands', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'forgiving', 'wives', 'even', 'inattentiveness', 'did', 'play', 'part', 'infidelity', 'not', 'excusing', 'vows', 'do', 'say', 'sickness', 'health', 'adultery', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'dispute', 'fact', 'did', 'feel', 'Novak', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'had', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'been', 'shrew', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'anymore', 'Novak', 'husband', 'not', 'worshiped', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hurt', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'other', 'be', 'separated', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'end', 'promoting', 'destroying', 'families', 'pursuit', 'happiness', 'destroying', ""another's.Ernie"", 'Kovacs', 'comedic', 'talent', 'was', 'wasted', 'here', 'watch', 'North', 'Alaska', 'instead', 'Strangers', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'first', 'time', ""n't"", 'movie', 'would', 'care', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

They both have spouses, but are bored and, of course, unappreciated at home.  Soon they're lying to their mates and meeting regularly for romantic trysts.  Eventually, the truth comes out and Larry must choose between Maggie and his family.The romantic drama is set in an affluent suburb in 1960, with beautiful clothes, bright orange furniture, and copper-colored kitchen appliances.  Douglas's Larry is real, sensitive, and  undeniably sexy; I really enjoyed his performance.  Novak's sultry-voice and sleepwalker-style are overdone, but she's still believable as the housewife who wants to be good, but always ends up in trouble because she's just so gosh-darned pretty.  Barbara Rush is lovely and charming as Larry's long-suffering wife.

It is set in Southern California, with many scenes set at a  neighborhood bus  stop - and some in a local grocery store. The film starts at the bus stop, where parents gather to wait for the school bus.  Architect Larry Coe (Kirk Douglas) and his neighbor, Maggie (Kim Novak),  exchange  first glances and the chase begins.  They have fallen head over heels in love and both try to fight it.  Unfortunately, they both have spouses and young children.  Nevertheless,  Larry ardently pursues Maggie and she eventually decides  to be in an exciting relationship with him.  Her husband is cold and dull, and prefers the routines of daily life.  Maggie has also had a previous liaison outside of marriage and explains this to Larry during a confrontation at their hotel rendezvous.  For awhile they Larry decides he wants nothing to do with her, but he cannot leave Maggie alone.  Throughout the story,  Larry is designing a beautiful new home for writer Roger Altar (Ernie Kovacs).  The building of the house is shown in stages throughout the movie.  It almost becomes another character in the movie.  As the building goes on,  Larry's wife (Barbara Rush) begins to have suspicions that her husband is having an affair. She feels left out when he does not tell her of a five year project in Hawaii.  This is for an entire city in Hawaii.  Another subplot deals with their neighbor, Felix (Walter Matthau), who is also married, decides to make a pass at Larry's wife since he knows of Larry's affair.  He barges into their home as Larry is parking his car in the driveway.  When they confront each other, Felix makes Larry realize that he has done the same thing with Maggie.  Every relationship in this movie seems to come to a dead end, but the beautiful home Larry is building is completed at the end of the movie, and that gives some sort of satisfaction.Overall, it is a high class soap opera with big stars.

311865,A3HGTTFIDLCWDJ,6302424747,Medici,"[0, 1]","I love this movie and always have. I was testing out an upscaling DVD player using this DVD which I hadn't viewed in a couple years and found myself really enjoying the scene I used for the test, which took place in Earnie Kovac's apartment where he criticizes then praises Kirk's design. Having owned it for 6 years and seen it on TV as a teenager sometime after it first came out, I've always loved this movie, particularly the new house and the clandestine meetings there between Kirk and Kim's characters and the sad last scene with Kim in her black pumps, the house finally completed, but needing to say goodbye. But until this week, I didn't know how reviewable it was. Another good test movie, highly reviewable, is To Catch A Thief. The longshot scenes of the French Riviera and the flower cart accident as well as the motor boat run are great test subjects. Turns out the upscaler didn't work any better than the newer DVD player.As I was a child the age of the kids getting off the bus, I truly love all the scenes of houses, shopping centers, cars, rides and restaurants from that era. Something about early memories, especially if they're overwhelmingly good and complete, overpowers all else. Great nostalgia for people who love that time period, very great.",5,Can watch it Again and Again,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1271,"['love', 'movie', 'always', 'have', 'was', 'testing', 'out', 'upscaling', 'DVD', 'player', 'using', 'DVD', 'had', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'couple', 'years', 'found', 'really', 'enjoying', 'scene', 'used', 'test', 'took', 'place', 'Earnie', 'Kovac', 'apartment', 'where', 'then', 'Kirk', 'design', 'Having', 'owned', '6', 'years', 'seen', 'TV', 'teenager', 'sometime', 'first', 'came', 'out', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'movie', 'particularly', 'new', 'house', 'clandestine', 'meetings', 'there', 'Kirk', 'Kim', 'characters', 'sad', 'last', 'scene', 'Kim', 'black', 'pumps', 'house', 'finally', 'completed', 'needing', 'say', 'goodbye', 'week', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'reviewable', 'was', 'good', 'test', 'movie', 'highly', 'reviewable', 'Catch', 'Thief', 'longshot', 'scenes', 'French', 'Riviera', 'flower', 'cart', 'accident', 'as', 'well', 'motor', 'boat', 'run', 'are', 'great', 'test', 'subjects', 'out', 'upscaler', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'better', 'newer', 'DVD', 'player.As', 'was', 'child', 'age', 'kids', 'getting', 'off', 'bus', 'truly', 'love', 'scenes', 'houses', 'shopping', 'centers', 'cars', 'rides', 'restaurants', 'era', 'Something', 'about', 'early', 'memories', 'especially', ""'re"", 'overwhelmingly', 'good', 'complete', 'overpowers', 'else', 'Great', 'nostalgia', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'time', 'period', 'very', 'great']",N/A
311866,A3QFC8X23IR3QC,6302424747,"Michael C. Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[43, 45]","After World War II movies became more frank in subject matter. This was in part due to the changing mores of the returning vets and the women they came home to. After the horrors of war things would never be the same for them or for Hollywood. The other factor was the slow demise over the 50's of the studio system and the rise of television as a threat to the box office. The censors began to relax and allowed more adult themes to be presented on the big screen. By the early 1960's movies were well on there way to growing up. Taboo subjects such as prostitution, homosexuality and adultery were now subjects Hollywood was now eagerly taking on.One of the more interesting and surprisingly un-judgmental of these films was the 1960 Colombia release, `Strangers When We Meet'. Produced by Kirk Douglas' company Bryna Productions and Richard Quinn Productions and taken from the novel by Evan Hunter the film is a fascinating look into the suburban lives of a Los Angeles architect, his wife and the other woman in his life.Kirk Douglas gives a fine, understated performance as the architect Larry Coe. It is a stark contrast to his epic Spartacus of the same year. At a cross roads in his life he is given the chance to build the kind of house he always wanted to for upcoming novelist Ernie Kovaks while his company wants him to go on doing the same dull work they expect. He fights for his chance to take the chance of a life time with the skill of a fine screen actor.As his wife, Barbara Rush is outstanding in one of her finest moments on screen. She is cold and withholding yet needy of her husbands love. Her finest moments come in her scenes with Douglas where they argue over their future and in her chilling confrontation with the lecherous Walter Matthau on a dark rainy afternoon.As Maggie Gault actress Kim Novak turns in a nuanced and deeply felt performance. She is a woman that men have been hunting down all her life. Her beauty is something that brings her only sorrow and despair though a string of meaningless affairs. Her husband seems to be the only man who has no interest in sleeping with her and though she does love him he drives her away embarrassed by her open and honest desire for him. When Douglas says to her on their first meeting, ""You're not so pretty."" it throws her and intrigues her. Throughout the affair she embarks on with Douglas she is smart enough to know that this like all the others will ultimately lead nowhere. In the final frames of the film she is shown this very fact when faced with another leering man.Kim Novak is so cool and remote at times that it seems the perfect fit for her, the role of Maggie. She is the kind of natural actress that when left alone with her instincts and the eye of the camera she surprises the viewer with the dark emotions that live just beneath her lovely features. One scene among many where she shines is when she is confronted with her past and has to tell the truth to Douglas about it.The cinematography is wonderful to see in the widescreen aspect of this DVD and shows the great talent of cinematographer, Charles Lang who also shot such classics as `Charade' and ""Some Like It Hot' and the stunning ""One-Eyed Jacks"".The score by George Dunning is the perfect meeting of the romantic and dramatic. It stands along side his classic scores for ""Bell, Book, and Candle"", ""The World of Suzy Wong"" and ""Picnic.""Jean Louis one of the top designers of costumes for actresses of the period turns in just enough suburban glamour to keep the ladies in the cast looking wonderful.Director Richard Quinn pulls it all together with his usual style. He presents us with not only a good drama but also an interesting look at the suburban life of Los Angeles in 1960. The locations are memorable, the glamorous old Romanoff's restaurant, the stunning house that is built through the course of the film, and the beautiful beach at Malibu where the lovers rendezvous. This film stands along with ""Suzy Wong,"" ""Bell Book and Candle"", and ""How to Murder Your Wife"" as some of his best work. The film holds up after forty-five years as a fresh and timely look at the relationships between husbands and wives and lovers who are always ""Strangers When We Meet.""",5,"Husbands, Wives, and Lovers",1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,4231,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'became', 'more', 'frank', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'part', 'due', 'changing', 'mores', 'returning', 'vets', 'women', 'came', 'home', 'horrors', 'war', 'things', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Hollywood', 'other', 'factor', 'was', 'slow', 'demise', '50', 'studio', 'system', 'rise', 'television', 'threat', 'box', 'office', 'censors', 'began', 'relax', 'allowed', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'be', 'presented', 'big', 'screen', 'early', '1960', 'movies', 'were', 'well', 'way', 'growing', 'up', 'Taboo', 'subjects', 'such', 'prostitution', 'homosexuality', 'adultery', 'were', 'now', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'now', 'eagerly', 'taking', 'on.One', 'more', 'interesting', 'surprisingly', 'un-judgmental', 'films', 'was', '1960', 'Colombia', 'release', 'Strangers', 'When', 'Meet', 'Produced', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'company', 'Bryna', 'Productions', 'Richard', 'Quinn', 'Productions', 'taken', 'novel', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'film', 'fascinating', 'look', 'suburban', 'lives', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'architect', 'wife', 'other', 'woman', 'life.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'fine', 'understated', 'performance', 'architect', 'Larry', 'Coe', 'stark', 'contrast', 'epic', 'Spartacus', 'same', 'year', 'cross', 'roads', 'life', 'given', 'chance', 'build', 'kind', 'house', 'always', 'wanted', 'upcoming', 'novelist', 'Ernie', 'Kovaks', 'company', 'go', 'doing', 'same', 'dull', 'work', 'expect', 'chance', 'take', 'chance', 'life', 'time', 'skill', 'fine', 'screen', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'outstanding', 'one', 'finest', 'moments', 'screen', 'cold', 'withholding', 'yet', 'needy', 'husbands', 'love', 'finest', 'moments', 'come', 'scenes', 'Douglas', 'where', 'argue', 'future', 'chilling', 'confrontation', 'lecherous', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'dark', 'rainy', 'afternoon.As', 'Maggie', 'Gault', 'actress', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'nuanced', 'deeply', 'felt', 'performance', 'woman', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'hunting', 'down', 'life', 'beauty', 'something', 'only', 'sorrow', 'despair', 'string', 'meaningless', 'affairs', 'husband', 'be', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'interest', 'sleeping', 'love', 'away', 'embarrassed', 'open', 'honest', 'desire', 'When', 'Douglas', 'first', 'meeting', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'pretty', 'intrigues', 'affair', 'Douglas', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'others', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'final', 'frames', 'film', 'shown', 'very', 'fact', 'when', 'faced', 'leering', 'man.Kim', 'Novak', 'so', 'cool', 'remote', 'times', 'perfect', 'fit', 'role', 'Maggie', 'kind', 'natural', 'actress', 'when', 'left', 'alone', 'instincts', 'eye', 'camera', 'viewer', 'dark', 'emotions', 'live', 'just', 'lovely', 'features', 'One', 'scene', 'many', 'where', 'when', 'confronted', 'past', 'tell', 'truth', 'Douglas', 'it.The', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'see', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'great', 'talent', 'cinematographer', 'Charles', 'Lang', 'who', 'also', 'shot', 'such', 'classics', 'Charade', 'Hot', 'stunning', 'One-Eyed', 'Jacks', '.The', 'score', 'George', 'Dunning', 'perfect', 'meeting', 'romantic', 'dramatic', 'along', 'side', 'classic', 'scores', 'Bell', 'Book', 'Candle', 'World', 'Suzy', 'Wong', 'Picnic', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'one', 'top', 'designers', 'costumes', 'actresses', 'period', 'just', 'enough', 'suburban', 'glamour', 'keep', 'ladies', 'cast', 'looking', 'wonderful.Director', 'Richard', 'Quinn', 'together', 'usual', 'style', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'drama', 'also', 'interesting', 'look', 'suburban', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1960', 'locations', 'are', 'memorable', 'glamorous', 'old', 'Romanoff', 'restaurant', 'stunning', 'house', 'built', 'course', 'film', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'Malibu', 'where', 'lovers', 'rendezvous', 'film', 'Suzy', 'Wong', 'Bell', 'Book', 'Candle', 'How', 'Murder', 'Wife', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'up', 'forty-five', 'years', 'fresh', 'timely', 'look', 'relationships', 'husbands', 'wives', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'Strangers', 'When', 'Meet']",N/A

And this is one of the better ones of the genre.Kirk Douglas plays an architect who works primarily from home. He's married to Barbara Rush and has two sons. He meets and developes an affair with neighbor Kim Novak, also married with a son. Douglas and Novaak both feel guilty, but also feel powerless in the face of their attraction to each other. As time goes on, their secret bubbles closer and closer to the surface. Smarmy neighbor Walter Matthau (who also starred with Douglas in The Indian Fighter and Only The Brave) gives Douglas pointers on how to cheat, and even tries to entice Rush into a tryst. Further complicating things is an offer Douglas is weighing to move to Hawaii for five years to help develop a city. Does he leave to make a fresh start with his wife (who is beginning to suspect what's going on), or does he stay and juggle his marriage and affair?The film is entertaining and well-acted. Ernie Kovacs plays a pivotal role as a writer for whom Douglas is building a house - a single, amoral man who is a success in career, but envies the wife and kids that Douglas has.
