They briefly time travel back to medieval times and return to present time.

404605,A3EOHYIHQM3KK,6304153716,Sean Ares Hirsch,"[5, 5]","Actually, I give this Goosebumps video 4 1/2 stars. I have seen all of the Goosebumps videos, and this may very well actually be the best one.  The only one I really didn't like was ""Stay Out of the Basement."" I did like ""The Werewolf of Fever Swamp."" I really liked ""Welcome To Deadhouse,"" ""The Haunted Mask,"" and ""The Haunted Mask Part 2."" But if I had to choose the best, I would have to say this is the one. Like good horror, the movie STARTS normal and harmless. Gradually, some spooky things start to happen. One fine thing about this video is that a harmless practical joke (""We tour guides have to have some fun"") foreshadows the horror to come. It's hard for me to talk about this without ruining the surprise, but I will do my best. Things go along normal for some time, but then spooky things start to happen. The setting of the tower provides a wonderful background for an alternation of fear between real threats to Eddie and Sue and trivial objects that just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Without ruining this video for you, I will say that it will keep you guessing. The greatest thing about this video is that while their are some really implausible events, (such as a journey far away Eddie and Sue will take), the implausible events eventually lead the way to a tragic event that ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN in 1483. Once this is established, we stop worrying about the implausible aspects of this story, and we are able to concentrate on the horror that DID ACTUALLY HAPPEN in history. I don't want to ruin the final scene, but I will say we are given a great combination of relief and sudden fear. The scenery is wonderful and the movie will keep you in suspense. Another thing I must compliment is the smooth transition between scenes and locations, and scenes where we think one thing, and then start to realize another. If you like the Goosebumps, you absolutely MUST have this video tape.",4,"Possibly, The Best Goosebumps Video",998524800,"08 23, 2001",2001,1925,"['Actually', 'give', 'Goosebumps', 'video', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'have', 'seen', 'Goosebumps', 'videos', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Stay', 'Out', 'Basement', 'did', 'Werewolf', 'Fever', 'Swamp', 'really', 'liked', 'Welcome', 'Deadhouse', 'Haunted', 'Mask', 'Haunted', 'Mask', 'Part', '2', 'had', 'choose', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'STARTS', 'normal', 'harmless', 'Gradually', 'spooky', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'One', 'fine', 'thing', 'video', 'harmless', 'practical', 'joke', 'tour', 'guides', 'have', 'have', 'fun', 'horror', 'come', 'hard', 'talk', 'ruining', 'surprise', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'Things', 'go', 'along', 'normal', 'time', 'then', 'spooky', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'setting', 'tower', 'wonderful', 'background', 'alternation', 'fear', 'real', 'threats', 'Eddie', 'Sue', 'trivial', 'objects', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'ruining', 'video', 'will', 'say', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'greatest', 'thing', 'video', 'are', 'really', 'implausible', 'events', 'such', 'journey', 'far', 'away', 'Eddie', 'Sue', 'will', 'take', 'implausible', 'events', 'eventually', 'lead', 'way', 'tragic', 'event', 'ACTUALLY', 'DID', 'HAPPEN', '1483', 'established', 'stop', 'worrying', 'implausible', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'able', 'concentrate', 'horror', 'DID', 'ACTUALLY', 'HAPPEN', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'given', 'great', 'combination', 'relief', 'sudden', 'fear', 'scenery', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'suspense', 'thing', 'must', 'compliment', 'smooth', 'transition', 'scenes', 'locations', 'scenes', 'where', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'start', 'realize', 'like', 'Goosebumps', 'absolutely', 'MUST', 'have', 'video', 'tape']",Goosebumps - A Night in Terror Tower VHS

The two children begin seeing things at the Tower that apparently aren't there. They also keep getting behind the rest of the group and soon find themselves being chased by a mysterious man in black. Who is the man and why is he chasing Sue and Ed? This episode is of note for two particular reasons. The first is that the events are loosely based upon real, historic people, Prince Edward & Prince Richard and their imprisonment in the Tower of London by their Uncle, Richard III. The second reason this episode is noteworthy is that it is bookended by an introduction and concluding remarks by R.L. Stine, ala William Castle.""Stay Out of the Basement Pts. 1 & 2"" - Margaret and Casey Brewer are left at home with their botanist father when their mother has to go visit her injured sister. Mr. Brewer hasn't exactly been himself lately as he is busy working on a very ""hush-hush"" experiment. However, his behavior continues to become more and more bizarre and the kids begin to suspect that something has happened in the basement to affect their father.GOOSEBUMPS: A NIGHT IN TERROR TOWER is an excellent ""Goosebumps"" collection.
