772737,A3RODEQMP1IY51,B0000C2IQQ,"Allison Fox ""Film Fanatic & Philosopher""","[42, 49]","I agree with some of the other critiques - I'm not sure how well this movie is made in terms of explaining the background of the story.  Rose Red was scary.  Diary is more like a documentary almost.  More drama than horror.  It mainly has to do with a husband and wife ... the wife is permissive and the husband is a jerk who sleeps with other women.  Not sure what that has to do with the house exactly.  I thought they should have focused more on how the house first became haunted.  I feel there should be a prequel to the prequel now.  To explain in more detail what occurred BEFORE all of this.  Like before the house was built.  What was there beforehand (like a cemetery, ancient burial grounds, etc.) and why is it haunted in the first place.  It was not scary.  It wasn't really even suspenseful.  It did keep me interested through the whole movie though and the actress that played Ellen Rimbauer I thought was quite good.  I would suggest seeing this movie if you are a big fan of Rose Red though because it does explain SOME things ... I wish they would make a sequel too though.  ""Rose Red: Part Two - Revenege of the House"", maybe?As far as the DVD itself goes, what someone else mentioned is true.  If you click on Scene Selections, instead of the scenes for the Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, there are scenes from another movie.  Which is a pretty major mistake, I say!  No one in production caught that???  Come on, that's a pretty big thing to mess up.  Unless... they did it on purpose.... I mean, this is Stephen King we're talking about.  ;)  I plan on writing to the production company to try and figure out the mystery identity of the Scene Selection mess-up.

I knew what to expect in the plot (obviously), but they DID make some changes. The biggest changes, in my opinion, were to the psychic and the way they handled Posey's suicide. In this version, Madame Lu (not Stravinsky/Cora Fry) was an actual Chinese mystic with actual paranormal senses. I liked that much better than the ""mystic"" in the other film, who was a fake. Madame Lu and Sukeena became good friends, which is another thing I really enjoyed. As for Douglas Posey...in ""Rose Red"" he had Adam and April watch while he hung himself in front of them, after giving them his hat and a rose. The kids watched impassively, not caring that the man they considered to be an ""uncle"" had just killed himself in front of their eyes. I always hated that part. But in ""The Diary"", Posey hugs them and tells them that they are going to play hide and seek--just to get them away from the room so they won't watch him suicide. I MUCH prefer that version. It really showed how much he loved them, and I got really attached to his character. It also made the kids seem more real too.The special effects were pretty much non-existent in this film. At times the dialogue was a little stilted, but I am of the opinion that this is due more to their attempts to stay with the perceived time period. I like this version of Ellen much better too. Thankfully they didn't change Sukeena much at all, and what they added to her story only made me love her more. The plot was handled superbly and everything pretty much matched up to the sequel. We also heard portions of Ellen's diary read aloud through parts of the movie. On a whole, it came across as a drama, not a horror, but a GOOD drama.I enjoyed this, and I hope you will too.",5,Good prequel.,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,1826,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'Rose', 'Red', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'saw', 'Diary', 'TV', 'one', 'night', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'plot', 'obviously', 'DID', 'make', 'changes', 'biggest', 'changes', 'opinion', 'were', 'psychic', 'way', 'handled', 'Posey', 'suicide', 'version', 'Madame', 'Lu', 'not', 'Stravinsky/Cora', 'Fry', 'was', 'actual', 'Chinese', 'mystic', 'actual', 'paranormal', 'senses', 'liked', 'much', 'better', 'mystic', 'other', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'fake', 'Madame', 'Lu', 'Sukeena', 'became', 'good', 'friends', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Douglas', 'Posey', 'Rose', 'Red', 'had', 'Adam', 'April', 'watch', 'hung', 'front', 'giving', 'hat', 'rose', 'kids', 'watched', 'impassively', 'not', 'caring', 'man', 'considered', 'be', 'uncle', 'had', 'just', 'killed', 'front', 'eyes', 'always', 'hated', 'part', 'Diary', 'Posey', 'tells', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'hide', 'seek', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'room', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'suicide', 'MUCH', 'prefer', 'version', 'really', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'got', 'really', 'attached', 'character', 'also', 'made', 'kids', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'too.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-existent', 'film', 'times', 'dialogue', 'was', 'little', 'stilted', 'am', 'opinion', 'due', 'more', 'attempts', 'stay', 'perceived', 'time', 'period', 'version', 'Ellen', 'much', 'better', 'too', 'Thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'Sukeena', 'much', 'what', 'added', 'story', 'only', 'made', 'love', 'more', 'plot', 'was', 'handled', 'superbly', 'everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'matched', 'up', 'sequel', 'also', 'heard', 'portions', 'Ellen', 'diary', 'read', 'aloud', 'parts', 'movie', 'whole', 'came', 'drama', 'not', 'horror', 'GOOD', 'drama.I', 'enjoyed', 'hope', 'will', 'too']",Diary Of Ellen Rimbauer

This movie, which reunites King (as an executive producer, which I suspect means he merely cashed the check he was given), author Ridley Pearson (who wrote the tie-in novel), and Craig Baxley (who directed both films), is one of the worst in the King filmography.  It is appallingly boring, from beginning to end.  I kid you not: nothing of interest happens the entire time.  My memory of the novel is a bit sketchy, but I don't remember being so bored by it that I considered not even finishing, as was the case with this movie.  The characters are cardboard-thin, with no insights of ANY sort into their motivations.  Why is Rose Red so drawn to Ellen?  Why is John such a terrible person?  Why does Sukeena agree to move continents away from her home for this family?  Don't expect any such answers from this movie, for you will not get them.  Nor will you get one single scene that has anything resembling a scare.  &quot;Rose Red,&quot; though highly derivative, is a fairly entertaining and well-made movie, but this one is DOA.The only people I would reccommend this movie for are people who, like myself, feel compelled to own everything that has Stephen King's name on it.

772753,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0000C2IQQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","A very strange story in  this film. A story that does not look like Stephen King's traditional stories. Many things are different from what he has ever produced. Strangely enough it comes after the film ""Rose Red"" that is posterior in story time. This story is thus a prequel to the previously shot one. The element that is typically Kingian is the haunted house with some connection to Indians behind. But that is all. The story itself is some kind of distorted and warped ""Gone with the Wind"" in a setting that looks like and sounds like a Victorian house from England's 19th century, the Bronte Sisters maybe. The main character, Ellen Rimbauer herself is more like one of these feminine characters from this English literary period. Little to do with Stephen King's social approach and even historical time. There is even a vodun dimension that is more typical of Anne Rice's witches, especially the last volumes of the vampire series when the witches join the vampires in some kind of old central American chase. Yet the film is outstanding and mesmerizing in its slow rhythm and its slow building of the terror that is attached to the man of the house, to the man that has to be eliminated. But we know better, since we know the sequel that came before the prequel. It is the house that is twisted and warped and not the man who just used the house to get rid of his mistresses and then later of his own children. The question that is not answered though is why the house accepted to be the servant of that man, and what's more why the house accepted to be the justice-bringer, the executioner of the demand for vengeance and retribution from the wife. Can we interpret that as the taking over of the house by the wife and her African servant and confident? I am not sure. It is not all that  clear. What's more there are so many corners in the house that are not on the blue print that we would like to know how all that is possible. Did the house build itself, or grow inside the structure that was given to it, as it is suggested at the end? Maybe. But that is original for Stephen King. In ""The Shining"" the evil Indian spirit is living in the hotel but the hotel is not growing. In ""Salem's Lot"" the vampire takes over the house that welcomes him because of the crime it hosted some time before, but once again the house itself does not grow. There are several other haunted houses in King but never a house that has the power of growing, even if the Dark Tower could be seen as such, though it is not and it is only the  character that is growing through mythical and maybe mystical time as he is going up the tower. The magic comes from somewhere else, not the building itself. And in this case the evil that haunts the house is not very clear, clearly identified. Indian, Irish hence Celtic, or whatever, it is not clear at all.

There were a lot of things about ROSE RED that I didn't like--but I will admit to watching it twice. It had the irritating, stereotypical quality associated with most--not all--film versions of the great horror writer. My rule of thumb: The more involved SK is in the film production, the more irritating it would be. As soon as I realized that DIARY was based on ROSE RED, I couldn't help but think ""Oh, sh-t."" However, at that point I was already drawn in to the point of no return.I loved it.Where ROSE RED is overtly obvious, THE DIARY OF ELLEN RIMBAUER is lyrical in its story & visuals. It brought depth & humanity where none existed before. I credit the acting & direction for that. Tsidii Leloka, whose striking physical appearance in ROSE RED as the African Nurse/Companion in little more than a sort of walk-on special effect, is allowed to develope her characterization in DIARY, and that character is allowed to really project the ""feel"" of the production. In fact, all the actors were very good.The cinematography was excellent & the overal art design impressive.Thankfully, no walk-ons by the writer.PS.

The creepy and well-done ghost story about a vast mansion in seattle that continued to build itself even after it was empty.The prequel tells the story of how the mansion was built by oil magnate John Rimbauer and his marriage to Ellen.  Mr. Rimbauer is, well, he's a sex maniac.  And when he could not get some lovin' from his wife, he more he gladly made use of many of the servant staff in the huge mansion.All the while Ellen is learning that Rose Red is really alive with a presence that loves her but then becomes jealous and possesive of Ellen, even taking her daughter.  She disappears without a trace and it forces Ellen to remain in the house rather than flee as she is advised to do by a Chinese psychic.Diary unfortunately doesn't have nearly the scare factor of Rose Red.  You're a good 3/4 of the way into the movie before you detect any remote chill.  Mostly we just get the lurid and sex-crazed life of Mr. Rimbauer.Not a good sequel and really not needed.",2,BORING AND NOT SCARY PREQUEL,1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,1116,"['Diary', 'Ellen', 'Rimbauer', 'sequel', 'rather', 'prequel', 'very', 'successful', 'Stephen', 'King', 'mini-series', 'Rose', 'Red', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'creepy', 'well-done', 'ghost', 'story', 'vast', 'mansion', 'seattle', 'continued', 'build', 'even', 'was', 'empty.The', 'prequel', 'story', 'how', 'mansion', 'was', 'built', 'oil', 'magnate', 'John', 'Rimbauer', 'marriage', 'Ellen', 'Mr.', 'Rimbauer', 'well', 'sex', 'maniac', 'when', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'lovin', 'wife', 'more', 'gladly', 'made', 'use', 'many', 'servant', 'staff', 'huge', 'mansion.All', 'while', 'Ellen', 'learning', 'Rose', 'Red', 'really', 'alive', 'presence', 'then', 'jealous', 'possesive', 'Ellen', 'even', 'taking', 'daughter', 'trace', 'Ellen', 'remain', 'house', 'rather', 'flee', 'advised', 'do', 'Chinese', 'psychic.Diary', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'scare', 'factor', 'Rose', 'Red', ""'re"", 'good', '3/4', 'way', 'movie', 'detect', 'remote', 'chill', 'Mostly', 'just', 'get', 'lurid', 'sex-crazed', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Rimbauer.Not', 'good', 'sequel', 'really', 'not', 'needed']",Diary Of Ellen Rimbauer

I ordered it new, and surprisingly enough, it was brand new. I tried watching the movie, and realized that for the attempt, it was in fact better than I thought it was when i originally watched it.
