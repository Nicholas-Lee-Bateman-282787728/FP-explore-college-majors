957575,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000CELOW2,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 4]","There are a number of shows from my youth(the 80's, but a number of 70's shows I saw in reruns too)that I love, remember fondly, and still catch thanks to TV Land and such. One show I absolutely loved during this time was ""Gimme A Break"". It's long been a favorite, but I never saw it on TV anymore. I always wondered what it would be like to stay in the Kanisky household once again, and now, thanks to DVD, we can all remember. This set comes with all 19 episodes from the show's debut season, which was the 1981 to 1982 season. The show may of not re-invented the sitcom, but it was a fun one. Nell Harper(Nell Carter), moves into the Kanisky household run by Carl, the chief of police(Dolph Sweet), a widower with three daughters. Pretty, popular Katie(Kari Michaelsen, who has the distinct honor of being my fist ever ""TV/celebrity crush""), nerdish middle daughter Julie(Laurie Hendler), and energetic tomboy Samantha(Lara Jill Miller). Nell moves in to help when their mother dies. There are a number of good moments here. The one I remember the most was ""Sam's Affair"", where Sam kisses a friend, thinks that's ""sex"", and is afriad she is pregnant. What's funny is just going back and seeing how things used to be back in the 80's. There are things I miss. Other notable exceptions here include ""Mom's Birthday"", a funny but sad episode where Nell tries to cheer the family up when their mothers' birthday rolls around. We meet the hilarious grandparents(especially John Hoyt as Grandpa Kanisky), and others. ""Your Prisoner Is Dead"" finds Carl having a hard time dealing with the death of a robber he shot. There's some old standbys in TV world here with Julie wanting and not making it into Katie's popular club of friends in ""Julie's Rejection"". Katie cheating on a test and feeling the guilt when her family praises her right and left in ""Katie The Cheat"". But like other 80's sitcoms, Gimme A Break touched on interesting and topical issues at the time. ""The Emergency"" finds Katie heading to the hospital in pain and the Chief finding out the cause. ""An Unmarried Couple""(which features Helen Hunt), has Katie's unwed and pregnant friend staying with the famiy. But it all comes down to Nell. She was just live with amazing energy, warm hearted love, and sharp comedic skills. She made the show come alive and you felt her presence. The kids were not the greatest actors, but they all had their appeal and charm. Dolph Sweet was perfectly cast as Carl. Gruff and tough and ""filled out"", he was an old fashioned hard boiled dad who loved his girls more than anything else. Be on the lookout for guest stars like Rue McClanahan in ""The Second Time Around"", Danny Glover in ""A Man In Nell's Room"", and Crystal Bernard in ""Hot Muffins"". The show could venture into cheesy ""family sitcom"" territory now and then, but we accept it because it was so charming and likeable. Gimme A Break was funny, touching, entertaining, and took issues with topical things at that current time. It may not be up there with the all time TV greats, but it's something quite good and something I remember so very fondly from my childhood. Watching these took me back, and I am definitley looking forward to future seasons coming out. As for extras, there is a bonus episode from season 2 called ""Nell Goes To Jail"", which is a good one. Also, there is an episode of ""Kate And Allie"" and ""Charles In Charge"". Why those two?. Because they all came from the same studio(Universal). There is also a half hour documentary on 80's TV pop culture. It's fun, but very slight. Could of been much better and much more in depth. But what a treat to see Nell again.",4,"""Gimme A Break, We Sure Deserve It!!....""",1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,3640,"['are', 'number', 'shows', 'youth', '80', 'number', '70', 'shows', 'saw', 'reruns', 'too', 'love', 'remember', 'fondly', 'still', 'catch', 'thanks', 'TV', 'Land', 'such', 'One', 'show', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'time', 'was', 'Gim', 'Break', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'never', 'saw', 'TV', 'anymore', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'stay', 'Kanisky', 'household', 'once', 'again', 'now', 'thanks', 'DVD', 'can', 'remember', 'set', '19', 'episodes', 'show', 'debut', 'season', 'was', '1981', '1982', 'season', 'show', 'may', 'not', 're-invented', 'sitcom', 'was', 'fun', 'one', 'Nell', 'Harper', 'Nell', 'Carter', 'Kanisky', 'household', 'run', 'Carl', 'chief', 'police', 'Dolph', 'Sweet', 'widower', 'three', 'daughters', 'Pretty', 'popular', 'Katie', 'Kari', 'Michaelsen', 'who', 'distinct', 'honor', 'being', 'fist', 'ever', 'TV/celebrity', 'crush', 'nerdish', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'Laurie', 'Hendler', 'energetic', 'tomboy', 'Samantha', 'Lara', 'Jill', 'Miller', 'Nell', 'help', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'are', 'number', 'good', 'moments', 'here', 'one', 'remember', 'most', 'was', 'Sam', 'Affair', 'where', 'Sam', 'friend', 'sex', 'afriad', 'pregnant', 'What', 'funny', 'just', 'going', 'back', 'seeing', 'how', 'things', 'used', 'be', 'back', '80', 'are', 'things', 'miss', 'Other', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'here', 'include', 'Mom', 'Birthday', 'funny', 'sad', 'episode', 'where', 'Nell', 'cheer', 'family', 'up', 'when', 'mothers', 'birthday', 'rolls', 'around', 'meet', 'hilarious', 'grandparents', 'especially', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'Grandpa', 'Kanisky', 'others', 'Prisoner', 'Dead', 'Carl', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'death', 'robber', 'old', 'standbys', 'TV', 'world', 'here', 'Julie', 'wanting', 'not', 'making', 'Katie', 'popular', 'club', 'friends', 'Julie', 'Rejection', 'Katie', 'cheating', 'test', 'feeling', 'guilt', 'when', 'family', 'right', 'left', 'Katie', 'Cheat', 'other', '80', 'sitcoms', 'Gim', 'A', 'Break', 'touched', 'interesting', 'topical', 'issues', 'time', 'Emergency', 'Katie', 'heading', 'hospital', 'pain', 'Chief', 'finding', 'out', 'cause', 'Unmarried', 'Couple', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Katie', 'unwed', 'pregnant', 'friend', 'staying', 'famiy', 'down', 'Nell', 'was', 'just', 'live', 'amazing', 'energy', 'warm', 'hearted', 'love', 'sharp', 'comedic', 'skills', 'made', 'show', 'come', 'alive', 'felt', 'presence', 'kids', 'were', 'not', 'greatest', 'actors', 'had', 'appeal', 'charm', 'Dolph', 'Sweet', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Carl', 'Gruff', 'tough', 'filled', 'out', 'was', 'old', 'fashioned', 'hard', 'boiled', 'dad', 'who', 'loved', 'girls', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Be', 'lookout', 'guest', 'stars', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Second', 'Time', 'Around', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'A', 'Man', 'Nell', 'Room', 'Crystal', 'Bernard', 'Hot', 'Muffins', 'show', 'could', 'venture', 'cheesy', 'family', 'sitcom', 'territory', 'now', 'then', 'accept', 'was', 'so', 'charming', 'likeable', 'Gim', 'Break', 'was', 'funny', 'touching', 'entertaining', 'took', 'issues', 'topical', 'things', 'current', 'time', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'time', 'TV', 'greats', 'something', 'quite', 'good', 'something', 'remember', 'so', 'very', 'fondly', 'childhood', 'Watching', 'took', 'back', 'am', 'definitley', 'looking', 'forward', 'future', 'seasons', 'coming', 'out', 'extras', 'bonus', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'called', 'Nell', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'good', 'one', 'Also', 'episode', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'Why', 'two', 'came', 'same', 'studio', 'Universal', 'also', 'half', 'hour', 'documentary', '80', 'TV', 'pop', 'culture', 'fun', 'very', 'slight', 'Could', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'what', 'treat', 'see', 'Nell', 'again']",Gimme a Break!

It's funny that some of the issues that they dealt with on this show were considered to be somewhat explicit at the time but not so much anymore.  I also found it to be very interesting that Nell's character believed that she was an attractive, sexy woman even though she was not a size 2.  (As a woman who is also not a size 2, I found it refreshing because you don't see much of that on tv these days.)  Nell didn't let her size or race get to her because she believed in herself.  There are some very, very funny moments and some very tender moments (specifically in the episode ""Mom's Birthday"".)  I laughed so hard I cried and then I cried so hard that I had to laugh at myself.

957580,A15STWX7P0NE0D,B000CELOW2,Christopher R. Hernandez,"[0, 0]","Universal did a great job by listening to us fans and finally releasing this classic 80's sitcom.  Gimme a Break focuses on Nell Harper, played by Nell Carter.  She is the housekeeper to the Kaninsky family who recently lost their matriarch.  Nell's official title is housekeeper, but she is much more than that.  She acts almost as a surrogate mom to the three Kaninsky daughters, and always looks out for their dad Karl.  The plots focus on many issues, mainly comical, but sometimes serious.  One such serious issue is the family's grief in losing their mom/wife.  Another episode deals with police officer Karl's killing of an armed robber in the line of duty.The set contains all 19 first season episodes.  These are all the original network episodes, not syndicated cuts.  No music has been replaced or omitted.  Nell does sing some commercial songs in some episodes and some song themselves do play.  I guess Universal got the hint to not edit music on this set.  The video looks great for a show over 20 years old.  There are one or two spots with lines or slight jumping, but nothing major.  The audio is 2.0 mono.  The only bonus features are previews of other Universal titles, an 80's TV featurette (which features Lara Jill Miller who plays Sam on the show), and bonus episodes of Charles in Charge, Kate & Allie and a season 2 Gimme a Break episode.  It would have been nice to see interviews and commentaries on the episodes, but hopefully next set.If you watched this show when it first ran, or watched it in syndication, you will want this set.  Even if you've never seen it, you will enjoy this set.  I haven't seen this show in years but it used to be one of my favorites.  When I started watching it I was expecting to be nostalgic but didn't expect to laugh that much.  I was in for a big surprise.  This show has more than held up.  I was hysterical laughing through much of it.  Once I finished an episode I just had to keep watching the enxt one.

957586,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000CELOW2,Dorrie Wheeler,"[1, 1]","Universal did a great job with Gimme a Break! season one. Product wise, this is one of the best TV on DVD sets they have released. The set includes all 19 episodes from the shows 1981 -1982 season. Guess what? No dual discs. The episodes are on individual discs with colorful artwork on each disc. Okay, it's super great not to have dual discs. But wait there's more-bonus features. The Gimme A Break Season One DVD includes 3 bonus episodes. It includes an episode from Gimme a Break Season 2 ""Nell Goes To Jail,"" and episode from Kate and Allie: Season One ""A Very Loud Family,"" and an episode from Charles in Charge Season One ""Extracurricular Activity."" In addition to the bonus features is a half hour featurette titled ""The Great 80's Flashback.""The first season of Gimme A Break was a memorable one. The first thing I noticed was that there were more jokes about Nell's weight during this season than in later seasons. Her weight was also written into several storylines during the first season. In later seasons Nell's weight became a non-issue. As the season begins we see Nell acting in a motherly role toward young Samantha who is being bullied in school. Viewers are introduced to Carl Kanisky's tough lough parenting (he grounds daughter Julie and forbids her to attend the prom in one episode, in another episode he threatens to whoop 17 year old Katie with a belt.)The first season includes many memorable episodes. Samantha kisses a boy and is totally distraught when she thinks she is pregnant. In another episode it is revealed that young Katie Kanisky has an IUD. Katie also frets about uncertainaity about going to college. The Chief stresses when he starts dating again. During season one Carl also deals with the after shock of killing a criminal. It's a really good season.",5,The Great Nell Carter Gets a Great DVD Box Set,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1796,"['Universal', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Gim', 'Break', 'season', 'one', 'Product', 'wise', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'released', 'set', '19', 'episodes', 'shows', '1981', '-1982', 'season', 'Guess', 'what', 'dual', 'discs', 'episodes', 'are', 'individual', 'discs', 'colorful', 'artwork', 'disc', 'Okay', 'super', 'great', 'not', 'have', 'dual', 'discs', 'wait', 'more-bonus', 'features', 'Gim', 'A', 'Break', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', '3', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'episode', 'Gim', 'Break', 'Season', '2', 'Nell', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'episode', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'Season', 'One', 'Very', 'Loud', 'Family', 'episode', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'Season', 'One', 'Extracurricular', 'Activity', 'addition', 'bonus', 'half', 'hour', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Great', '80', 'Flashback', 'first', 'season', 'Gim', 'A', 'Break', 'was', 'memorable', 'one', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'were', 'more', 'jokes', 'Nell', 'weight', 'season', 'later', 'seasons', 'weight', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'several', 'storylines', 'first', 'season', 'later', 'seasons', 'Nell', 'weight', 'became', 'non-issue', 'season', 'see', 'Nell', 'acting', 'motherly', 'role', 'young', 'Samantha', 'who', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'Viewers', 'are', 'introduced', 'Carl', 'Kanisky', 'tough', 'lough', 'parenting', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'attend', 'prom', 'one', 'episode', 'episode', 'whoop', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Katie', 'belt', 'first', 'season', 'many', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'Samantha', 'boy', 'totally', 'distraught', 'when', 'pregnant', 'episode', 'revealed', 'young', 'Katie', 'Kanisky', 'IUD', 'Katie', 'also', 'uncertainaity', 'going', 'college', 'Chief', 'stresses', 'when', 'dating', 'again', 'season', 'one', 'Carl', 'also', 'shock', 'killing', 'criminal', 'really', 'good', 'season']",Gimme a Break!

957596,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000CELOW2,MortensOrchid,"[1, 4]","Like a lot of sitcoms for its time, Gimme A Break was about a family and family oriented situation.  Nell Carter played a character by the same name, Nell, who had promised a long time friend on her deathbed that she would look after her family.  Nell moves into the Kanisky house as their housekeeper / ""mammie"" figure to care for three daughters and their father.  The household would eventually include Grandpa and orphaned Joey, while Chief Kanisky's bumbling fool deputy (a la Barney Fife) and Nell's childhood friend Addie become non resident family members.What makes a good sitcom is the conflict, and in a situation like this you will have many a conflict.  There will be obvious clashes between the no nonsense Chief Kanisky and Nell's more relaxed attitude about parenting and running the household.  The three daughters were softened up quite a bit, looking at it now.  They implied their behaviors spiraling out of control, but probably because of the censors were not allowed to directly say their situation (ex. the oldest daughter's birth control episode when she's clearly still a teenager).  They seem like real nightmares, going through their changes and getting into trouble.  The addition of Joey still makes me wonder.  It's clear they added him as a foil for Nell, but I otherwise wouldn't see how adopting this child would add to the family's well being.It takes me back seeing it now.

This was one of the most underrated, yet funny sitcoms of the '80s, even though NBC spent more time hyping up Cheers, Cosby, Night Court and others in later years. The true star is Nell Carter here and the other actors like Dolph Sweet were good too. I noticed the growth in Joey Lawrence's acting, which was later realized in the '90s hit Blossom. I liked the pop album he made in 1993, but that's another story. Funny moments were of Nell hitting Joey's head every time he was getting in trouble. Few shows now would take a chance with a black woman being the surrogate mother of white children after their mother deceased. But I noticed how much the writers made Nell be the mother of the kids whenever they got out of hand. She communicated very well with their father. There was a strong family atmosphere among the characters. This show took chances and looked past the criticism of others to last for 6 years from 1981 to 1987. I even watched most of the last season's shows in 86-87.  But I still love that theme song, with its dopey sounding piano and I'm always screaming GIMME A BREAK at the end when the song ends!

957600,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B000CELOW2,RetroRhythms,"[4, 5]","It truly is a shame that this couldn't have been released before Nell Carter's untimely death. But season sets of sitcoms weren't quite the rage that they have become in the few years since. So I'm glad that it's here now as one testament to this lady's undeniable talent!As early-80's sitcoms go, ""Gimme a Break"" had a very real edge to it! Unlike with ""Diff'rent Strokes,"" another sitcom of the time that dealt with an interracial family structure, one can easily find traits in the characters and storylines of ""Gimme a Break"" to relate to real life.* Firstly, Nell Carter in her role as ""Nell"" was NO-nonsense, but not in an overbearing kind of way. Both her and her character approached situations with a combination of wit, humor, and honesty that is rare to find. Secondly, the rest of the cast was equally strong! Dolph Sweet's portrayal of Chief Carl Kanisky may seem over-the-top by today's standards; but the way it was written was realistic and also, clearly, added to both the chemistry and tension between his character and Nell's. And the kids...The kids were not just token kids. They each had complex, well-developed roles that were consistently entertaining. While the role of the youngest daughter, ""Samantha,"" seemed somewhat trivial in the beginning, it gradually strengthened. Lara Jill Miller covered the emotional spectrum quite well for an actress of her age, and she exhibited keen senses of time and reaction in her portrayal of the ""tomboy"" sibling. She was also a very pretty girl, which made for a nice contrast to stereotypes of the type of character she was playing. Meanwhile, Lauri Hendler was strikingly effective in the role of ""Julie."" Similar to Miller, she was multi-dimensional in her acting, preventing the ""nerdy"" role from becoming uniform. Kari Michaelson as ""Katie"" was not as consistent in her delivery. There are times when there's a certain depth missing in her acting. But, she still showed potential, and did present a nice contrast to Miller and Hendler.What made the realistic portrayal of these characters and their respective situations possible was the strong writing. Though the 25-minute sitcom format will never be limitless, the ""Gimme a Break"" writers did a refreshingly effective job of presenting the details and dimensions of each storyline. And any time the characters had a ""change in personality,"" it was explained inherently within their lines and based in reality.I could go on to describe the various plots of the episodes here, but this review would then verge on becoming a longer essay! However, the character development and writing at large speak volumes for this classic show! It's one of a kind, and it has an all-around feel-good vibe, while also tackling serious issues. The acoomplishment of both of those things is one of the benchmarks of a good sitcom, and ""Gimme a Break"" HAS IT...AND MORE!*Note: I still AM a fan of ""Diff'rent Strokes.""

957601,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000CELOW2,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[6, 9]","Since this (along with ""Facts of Life"", ""Silver Spoons"", ""Webster"", and ""21 Jump Street"") is one of the 1980's classic television shows of my generation's childhood, it's a shame that season one's DVD release comes only after death of series star Nell Carter. Carter died January 23, 2003 of diabetes complications.An African American honors the deathbed request of her white friend, Margaret Kanisky. She moves in to take care of the family, including the crusty old `Chief' (Dolph Sweet) who really has a heart of gold. I really did not understand the series premise when first seeing episodes just because I was so young, but it now makes sense. Most people WOULD want their families taken care of by a trusted friend if they knew they were dying.Best episodes are ""Katie The Crook"" because the effects of mom's death upon her surviving kids is realistically explored; Katie Kanisky  (Kari Michaelson) has a very difficult time making peace with her mother's death, subsequently getting in lots of trouble. There is additional conflict in the episode because the daughter of a police officer theoretically knows MUCH better.I am also partial to ""Mom's Birthday"" because the family continues healing from Margaret's death, again NOT relegating it to a one-time incident just to `start' the series.Finally ""A Man In Nell's Room"" ultimately clarifies Nell decides whomever she wants spending the night in her own room----such as Bill (special guest star Danny Glover)! She is NOT an employee.The episode standing out the most from both this first season and the entire series is ""The Emergency"". It undoubtedly was influenced by high-profile Dalkon Shield cases of the late 1970's-early 1980's. Katie suddenly becomes really sick from her IUD-but only mom previously knew about Katie's sexual activity-leaving Dad and Nell in a big panic----especially discovering only after Katie got sick. Where today's teen use `protection' use is almost entirely focused on AIDS/STD prevention, a television episode about a method only preventing pregnancy is quaint. Plus, IUDS have declined in overall popularity as a contraceptive device for American teens---in part because of the Dalkon Shield case.This series had ignited some controversy among some African American groups and allies when first airing. The ""large black caretaker of a white family"" plot appeared to invoke the same stereotypical portrayals of ""black women-as-mammy"" which they previously had campaigned against. However, Nell Harper was never ever disciplined for speaking her mind and was an equal. Finally, Harper also dated while living with the Kaminsky's, again negating those stereotypical Hollywood binaries of black women as being portrayed as either hyper-sexualized seductresses or asexual entities.My favorite extras for this season release include ""The great 80's TV flashback"", a bonus episode from ""Kate and Allie"", and ""Gimme a Break""'s second season.I hope release of this series means that networks will `gimme' more classic 1980's television (""Facts of Life"", ""Family Ties"",etc...).

As with sitcoms, cartoons etc. that you watch as a child and then again as an adult, you realise how many things went over your head. In the very first episode Carl comes home from work talking about a gay cop wanting to come out of the closet. It was a big deal then back in the 80s and is still a big deal now. Some of the episodes deal with issues of cheating, stealing, teen sexual issues (dating, pregnancy, birth control)...in short, the social issues of the time. The more things change the more they stay the same...It was so much fun watching this DVD, I could hardly wait for one episode to end and another to begin. I was able to fully appreciate all of the adult humour and content, and relate to the pop culture references that I remember so well (Billy Dee Williams was a really big deal back then). I was laughing out loud quite a bit and I loved that. So many times, a purchase made for nostalgia turns out to be so disappointing. It's never as good as you remember it but this was all that and MORE!I had a couple of ""Whoa Nellie! Where have I seen this before?"" moments a couple times:1.

Girl named Samantha who is a tomboy called Sam, who comes home with a black eye from a fight with a boy (Who's the Boss?)And a couple of ""Heyyyy, I know that person!"" moments with the following guest stars:Johnny Brown (Good Times, The Jeffersons)Harrison Page (Benson, Webster, Fame and a dozen other shows in the 80s)Jack Carter (Match Game)Liz Sheridan (Alf, Seinfeld)Mary Jo Catlett (Diff'rent Strokes, That's So Raven)Ben Powers (Good Times)Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon etc.)Crystal Bernard (Wings)Jay Johnson (Soap)Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister etc.)My very favourite ""extras"" though were Alvernette Jimenez (Angie) and John Hoyt (Grandpa Kanisky). They contributed quite a share to my laughs, and I wish that I could have seen more of Angie (the Black ""dumb blonde"")especially. What a character!One cool feature that I haven't seen on my other DVDs is that if you select to play by episode, it gives you a little synopsis of that episode right on the screen so you don't have to be fiddling with DVD cases and papers to see what that episode is all about. Also, it's not Closed Captioned but does contain English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing.THE BUT - The DVD quality is pretty inconsistent. On Disc 1, the video is typical 80s - muted colours - the characters look so pale that they're almost green, then on Disc 2 the colours get better and they look a bit more human, while on Disc 3 they are positively rosier, darker and glowing with health! The audio track does contain some crackling and popping but not too noticeable during the episodes. The worst part of the audio would be at the beginning and end of the episodes when the theme song plays. Some bits sound quite like when a cassette's been stretched out, and the hissing is more noticeable then. Bet you haven't heard the word ""cassette"" in ages! As with the video, the audio gets progressively clearer by DVD. Odd, maybe I got a weird set...All in all, it's ***** for the content and about *** for the DVD quality. Pity, because Universal's taken so much time to make sure each DVD is in its own case in the box set. That quality could have been transferred over into the internals of the set as well.",4,Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it...but...,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,3405,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Gim', 'Break', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'sitcoms', 'cartoons', 'etc', 'watch', 'child', 'then', 'again', 'adult', 'realise', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'went', 'head', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'Carl', 'home', 'work', 'talking', 'gay', 'cop', 'wanting', 'come', 'closet', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'then', 'back', '80s', 'still', 'big', 'deal', 'now', 'episodes', 'deal', 'issues', 'cheating', 'stealing', 'teen', 'sexual', 'issues', 'dating', 'pregnancy', 'birth', 'control', 'short', 'social', 'issues', 'time', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'DVD', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'one', 'episode', 'end', 'begin', 'was', 'able', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'adult', 'humour', 'content', 'relate', 'pop', 'culture', 'remember', 'so', 'well', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'was', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'quite', 'bit', 'loved', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'purchase', 'made', 'nostalgia', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'disappointing', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'was', 'MORE', 'had', 'couple', 'Whoa', 'Nellie', 'Where', 'have', 'seen', 'couple', 'times:1', 'Overweight', 'cop', 'named', 'Carl', 'Family', 'Matters', '2', 'Girl', 'named', 'Samantha', 'who', 'tomboy', 'called', 'Sam', 'who', 'home', 'black', 'eye', 'fight', 'boy', 'Who', 'Boss', 'couple', 'Heyyyy', 'know', 'person', 'moments', 'following', 'guest', 'stars', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'Good', 'Times', 'Jeffersons', 'Harrison', 'Page', 'Benson', 'Webster', 'Fame', 'dozen', 'other', 'shows', '80s', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'Match', 'Game', 'Liz', 'Sheridan', 'Alf', 'Seinfeld', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Catlett', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'That', 'So', 'Raven', 'Ben', 'Powers', 'Good', 'Times', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'etc', 'Crystal', 'Bernard', 'Wings', 'Jay', 'Johnson', 'Soap', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Mad', 'Twister', 'etc', 'very', 'favourite', 'extras', 'were', 'Alvernette', 'Jimenez', 'Angie', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'Grandpa', 'Kanisky', 'contributed', 'quite', 'share', 'laughs', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Angie', 'Black', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'especially', 'What', 'character', 'One', 'cool', 'feature', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'DVDs', 'select', 'play', 'episode', 'little', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'right', 'screen', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fiddling', 'DVD', 'cases', 'papers', 'see', 'what', 'episode', 'Also', 'not', 'Closed', 'Captioned', 'contain', 'English', 'subtitles', 'deaf', 'hard-of-hearing.THE', 'BUT', 'DVD', 'quality', 'pretty', 'inconsistent', 'Disc', '1', 'video', 'typical', '80s', 'muted', 'colours', 'characters', 'look', 'so', 'pale', ""'re"", 'almost', 'green', 'then', 'Disc', '2', 'colours', 'get', 'better', 'look', 'bit', 'more', 'human', 'Disc', '3', 'are', 'positively', 'rosier', 'darker', 'glowing', 'health', 'audio', 'track', 'contain', 'crackling', 'popping', 'not', 'too', 'noticeable', 'episodes', 'worst', 'part', 'audio', 'would', 'be', 'beginning', 'end', 'episodes', 'when', 'theme', 'song', 'plays', 'bits', 'sound', 'quite', 'when', 'cassette', 'been', 'stretched', 'out', 'hissing', 'more', 'noticeable', 'then', 'Bet', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'word', 'cassette', 'ages', 'video', 'audio', 'progressively', 'clearer', 'DVD', 'Odd', 'maybe', 'got', 'weird', 'set', '*****', 'content', '***', 'DVD', 'quality', 'Pity', 'Universal', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'DVD', 'own', 'case', 'box', 'set', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'internals', 'set', 'as', 'well']",Gimme a Break!

NBC had many quality sitcoms on the air in the 80s, such as Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts Of Life, Silver Spoons, etc. Gimme A Break, was certainly in the same league as any of NBC's other popular comedy shows. It was warm, funny, and presented many contemporary topics that modern families struggle with, such as teen sex, drugs, alcoholism, dating, etc.Nell Carter played the main character, Nell Harper. On the show, Nell often got to display her considerable singing and dancing talents. This made the show quite entertaining overall. And Nell held this show together, with her no nonsense brand of comic delivery. She had a feisty charm, that made her shine above the rest of the cast. Her co-star Dolph Sweet (who played the family patriarch, Carl Kominski), was lackluster by comparison. Only Thelma Hopkins, as Nell's best friend Addy Wilson, had nearly as much comedic talent as Nell. If you like 80s sitcoms, I'd highly recommend watching Gimme A Break on DVD.",5,"Warm, funny 80s sitcom.",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1029,"['Gim', 'A', 'Break', 'was', 'sitcom', 'line-up', 'NBC', '80s', 'NBC', 'had', 'many', 'quality', 'sitcoms', 'air', '80s', 'such', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Silver', 'Spoons', 'etc', 'Gim', 'Break', 'was', 'certainly', 'same', 'league', 'NBC', 'other', 'popular', 'comedy', 'shows', 'was', 'warm', 'funny', 'presented', 'many', 'contemporary', 'topics', 'modern', 'families', 'struggle', 'such', 'teen', 'sex', 'drugs', 'alcoholism', 'dating', 'etc.Nell', 'Carter', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'Nell', 'Harper', 'show', 'Nell', 'often', 'got', 'display', 'considerable', 'singing', 'dancing', 'talents', 'made', 'show', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'overall', 'Nell', 'held', 'show', 'together', 'nonsense', 'brand', 'comic', 'delivery', 'had', 'feisty', 'charm', 'made', 'shine', 'rest', 'cast', 'co-star', 'Dolph', 'Sweet', 'who', 'played', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Carl', 'Kominski', 'was', 'lackluster', 'comparison', 'Only', 'Thelma', 'Hopkins', 'Nell', 'best', 'friend', 'Addy', 'Wilson', 'had', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'comedic', 'talent', 'Nell', 'like', '80s', 'sitcoms', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Gim', 'A', 'Break', 'DVD']",Gimme a Break!

957604,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B000CELOW2,S. T. Peterson,"[1, 7]","I can remember as a kid watching this show. While I didn't follow it every week I do remember the major transitions after seeing this DVD and thinking about . . . the first part where the dad was still alive and how it changed after he and the real actor playing the dad died. Funny thing is the only specific dialogue I remember is of Nell's character angrily throwing everything she could find on the floor in a rage over something. Then the character (don't even remember her name . . . she comes into the show in a later season) screams, ""Stop. Nell that's the Bible."" And Nell stops right before slamming the Bible on the floor clasping it to her and thanking God. But as an adult I just finished watching this show and there was nothing Godly about it.It is nothing but more liberal moralizing and brainwashing. Sexual innuendo everywhere in every episode. You would think from watching this that people's only motivation in life was sex or a decision about it. There was the episode on the oldest daughter having problems with her IUD birth control device and having to be hospitalized. The liberal moral of the story can be summed up in the father's line (who was supposed to be the old fashioned conservative grouch): ""Just remember honey I will always love you no matter what you do."" Gag. That is the lesson taught. Sickening. What a waste of a teachable moment . . . since liberals love to preach to us about such things. But then again AIDS really hadn't burst on to the scene just yet. In 81 the sexual revolution from the 60s was still unfolding. Then you had the episode where the oldest daughter's pregnant teenaged friend who was kicked out of her parents home for getting pregnant ran away from her live in boyfriend because ""he didn't show he loved her"" and ""just wanted to get married because it was the right thing to do"". What!?!?! I would think the teachable moment would be to find out someone loved you before you got pregnant. But once again Hollywood and its twisted morality presents another side.The dialogue was stupid. The jokes were flat. While I am by no means into or supporting name calling you get to see the early beginnings of shielding overweight people from anyone saying anything about how unhealthy their bodies are in this show.They only positive thing I can say about this show was 1) it showed people as people . . . not plastic dummies reciting lines . . . I mean these people looked normal . . . the actors. The dad looked like a dad not a surfer dude. The one daughter looked normal but not like she just has breast implants and a nose and lip job done. and 2) it showed a dad being tough on his kids like you expected parents to be . . . back when they were unlike now where everyone tries to reason with a child when the child's reasoning skills are far from developed.I have done this walk down memory lane thing over the last few years and have been shocked that my parents of all parents allowed me to watch these shows and sometimes even sat there watching them with me. So I said something to my parents about this show, mentioning the above and asked why they thought that was OK.The only answer I got was ""While I remember that show I don't remember anything specific about it and don't recall any of what you said. I don't recall following it each week. And an adult would know what the creators were trying to do and just overlook it."" That seems to be the problem. People just overlooked stuff and now TV has ""evolved"" into it current unwatchable state. It has fed upon itself. And what about what a kid would think? I didn't push the conversation as I didn't want to appear like I was blaming anyone. Besides I know that was a transition period for parents anyway . . . there was so much going on and so much shock content that it was probably hard to be a parent back then. I mean you went from I Love Lucy and The Donna Reed Show to this stuff. Today it is easy . . . just don't have cable. I don't.Anyway I am getting away from this specific review. Another annoying part of this (and shocking too) was that Carter's character plays a stereotypical black America . . . one who threatens violence if she doesn't get her way. In just about every episode she is threatening people . . . . The audience jumps to its feet whooping it up and applauding. Kinda disturbing.Anyway as I say with all this similar genre . . . just leave it in the past.",1,Give ME a break from this liberal vomit,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,4406,"['can', 'remember', 'kid', 'watching', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'week', 'do', 'remember', 'major', 'transitions', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'about', 'first', 'part', 'where', 'dad', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'how', 'changed', 'real', 'actor', 'playing', 'dad', 'died', 'Funny', 'thing', 'only', 'specific', 'dialogue', 'remember', 'Nell', 'character', 'angrily', 'throwing', 'everything', 'could', 'find', 'floor', 'rage', 'something', 'Then', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'name', 'show', 'later', 'season', 'screams', 'Stop', 'Nell', 'Bible', 'Nell', 'stops', 'right', 'slamming', 'Bible', 'floor', 'clasping', 'thanking', 'God', 'adult', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'nothing', 'Godly', 'it.It', 'nothing', 'more', 'liberal', 'moralizing', 'brainwashing', 'Sexual', 'innuendo', 'everywhere', 'episode', 'would', 'think', 'watching', 'people', 'only', 'motivation', 'life', 'was', 'sex', 'decision', 'was', 'episode', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'having', 'problems', 'IUD', 'birth', 'control', 'device', 'having', 'be', 'hospitalized', 'liberal', 'moral', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'father', 'line', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'old', 'fashioned', 'conservative', 'grouch', 'Just', 'remember', 'honey', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'Gag', 'lesson', 'taught', 'Sickening', 'What', 'waste', 'teachable', 'moment', 'liberals', 'love', 'preach', 'such', 'things', 'then', 'again', 'AIDS', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'burst', 'scene', 'just', 'yet', '81', 'sexual', 'revolution', '60s', 'was', 'still', 'unfolding', 'Then', 'had', 'episode', 'where', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'pregnant', 'teenaged', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'kicked', 'parents', 'home', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'ran', 'away', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'loved', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'married', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'What', 'would', 'think', 'teachable', 'moment', 'would', 'be', 'find', 'out', 'someone', 'loved', 'got', 'pregnant', 'once', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'twisted', 'morality', 'side.The', 'dialogue', 'was', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'were', 'flat', 'am', 'means', 'supporting', 'name', 'calling', 'get', 'see', 'early', 'beginnings', 'shielding', 'overweight', 'people', 'anyone', 'saying', 'anything', 'how', 'unhealthy', 'bodies', 'are', 'show.They', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'was', '1', 'showed', 'people', 'people', 'not', 'plastic', 'dummies', 'reciting', 'lines', 'mean', 'people', 'looked', 'normal', 'actors', 'dad', 'looked', 'dad', 'not', 'surfer', 'dude', 'one', 'daughter', 'looked', 'normal', 'not', 'just', 'breast', 'implants', 'nose', 'lip', 'job', 'done', '2', 'showed', 'dad', 'being', 'tough', 'kids', 'expected', 'parents', 'be', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'now', 'where', 'everyone', 'reason', 'child', 'when', 'child', 'reasoning', 'skills', 'are', 'far', 'developed.I', 'have', 'done', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane', 'thing', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'shocked', 'parents', 'parents', 'allowed', 'watch', 'shows', 'sometimes', 'even', 'sat', 'watching', 'said', 'something', 'parents', 'show', 'mentioning', 'above', 'asked', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'OK.The', 'only', 'got', 'was', 'remember', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'specific', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'what', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'following', 'week', 'adult', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'creators', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'overlook', 'be', 'problem', 'People', 'just', 'overlooked', 'stuff', 'now', 'TV', 'evolved', 'current', 'unwatchable', 'state', 'fed', 'what', 'what', 'kid', 'would', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'conversation', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'appear', 'was', 'blaming', 'anyone', 'know', 'was', 'transition', 'period', 'parents', 'anyway', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'so', 'much', 'shock', 'content', 'was', 'probably', 'hard', 'be', 'parent', 'back', 'then', 'mean', 'went', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'stuff', 'Today', 'easy', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', ""don't.Anyway"", 'am', 'getting', 'away', 'specific', 'review', 'annoying', 'part', 'shocking', 'too', 'was', 'Carter', 'character', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'America', 'one', 'who', 'violence', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'just', 'episode', 'threatening', 'people', 'audience', 'feet', 'whooping', 'applauding', 'Kinda', 'disturbing.Anyway', 'say', 'similar', 'genre', 'just', 'leave', 'past']",Gimme a Break!

She is a gem who packs a punch in her role as Nell, a maid to a police chief - played by Dolph Sweet.  The Chief's wife, Margaret, had recently died and is raising 3 girls on his own and hires her to do the help.Back to hyping up the delightful Nell; her work on doing kid-friendly pratfall jokes (e.g. vacuuming the fish tank!) are still fresh and uproarious today, and her take on ""politically incorrect"" humor only sweetens the pot.  This show is refreshingly funny without resorting to crudity that's the norm in today's television.  She really makes this show more than the sum of its parts and will instantly grow on you; this show is a CLASSIC.  And, the kid jokes still work well on adults.Even the product references of the time (Sanka brand coffee) are easily recognized and remembered, but then I'm something of a geek...The children are interesting, but the naughty ones (Katie, the 'wild child') is my favorite.DVD quality is pretty good and I'm an irrational stickler with this sort of thing.  Video compression quality is more or less typical, but it looks good.  The source material is fantastic and very well restored.  And the audio is crisp and clean; excellently restored too.I highly recommend this set to anybody.  It's a terrific family show.  This set is worth EVERY penny and I hope the remainder of the series comes out soon!02/09/07 update:  Having re-watched season 1 a couple more times, while it is true Nell Carter steals the show, it dawned on my my initial review may have sounded harsh, by ignoring the quality of all the actors on the show, for which I truly wish to apologize.  Nell steals the show, but compared to other 80s family or other shows with child actors, the acting by ALL is solid and believable.
