1378442,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B003ZXNCH2,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[9, 43]","Immediate reaction after just seeing it... The film critics LOVE this movie but it is not THAT great. Maybe art critics love it too? EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP is so clever and ""hysterical"", etc., and, you know, it like questions ""what is art??"" and pokes fun at/critiques the ""inanity"" of the art world, etc. It's a brilliant, satirical, """"subversive"""" send-up of fill-in-the-blank. Of the art world, YOU, me, society, art itself, so-called ""street art"". I wasn't sure, but was curious.Just saw it and it isn't THAT entertaining or illuminating, to me anyways. Why I feel this way is I guess because I'd hoped for a doc mostly on graffiti artists and of course on U.K. based artist Banksy that also featured insightful commentary on the art world and the filthy lucre that runs the show ETC. And I don't like this guy Thierry Guetta, whoever he is. So I was wanting something a little different ok.Guetta aka Mr. Brainwash ends up the main feature. Some people are saying this whole thing is a prank. It is a faux documentary. I'd read the film subject was Banksy who in turn became the ""director"" and turned the tables on the guy who was originally doing a film on Banksy and street art. This peculiar L.A. boutique owner Frenchman Terry Guetta was the ""filmmaker"". If he really put on an ""art"" show like presented in this movie, he is a brilliant conman (and maybe truly mentally ill -but a brilliant conman nonetheless). Anyway, the movie starts off good with some priceless footage of incredible art and artists at work and getting chased by cops. And when we meet Terry he seems cool as a fan obsessively video recording street artists while they do their thing and he becomes a trusted aid in their risky nocturnal outings to put pictures on buildings and public spaces. Terry assists Shepard Fairey of ""Obey"" and Obama Hope poster fame (you know the one. Wonder what he thinks of O'Bummer now. Artists can be pretty naive, politically.). And we meet Invader who is named after his claim to street art fame, his ""Space Invader"" pieces based on the 80s pixel video game characters. (Got to love it! I played that game when I was little. Ahhh, nostalgia for pop-culture artifacts. Darn it tho! Been seeing Space Invaders and Atari images on t-shirts at the Target. Oh well so it goes...). Terry is kinda likable at first, budding with infectious enthusiasm, and he records EVERYTHING and promises -lies- to the artists he records that he is making a documentary of their work. This appeals to them, esp. because of the temporary nature of their work. They paint on buildings and put things up on private property that are usually taken down quickly (or it was back-in-the-day and still is by poor unfortunate souls that may not know they have a real Banksy on their building! Cha-Ching!!). Anyway Terry finally meets the elusive and mysterious Banksy while the artist is on a mission in L.A. Like a true life comic book hero Banksy keeps his origins a mystery and his birth name and appearance secret from the public and has an inner core of trusted aids and confidants who help him with his ongoing mission to do what he does. Make really truly cool art, basically. --A highlight of the film are recordings of the artist painting the Wall in Israel. Brilliant.-- (Look at some compilation tribute clips on YouTube.)To cut to the chase, turns out Terry ain't no ""film maker"" when he shows Banksy a bizarre final product that is simply a horrid, nonstop, random, back-to-back series of images that he'd recorded over the years. Banksy realizes, at least according to *this* movie you see, that Terry is a talentless nut. So he plays it cool and recommends Terry go home to L.A. and ""make his own art"". This is not a good idea... L-O-L. Or is it? Ha-ha. I think we're supposed to be laughing anyway in any case, if you're clever enough maybe. I'm not sometimes. Meanwhile Banksy decides he'll try to do something with the footage himself, realizing the importance of the precious footage and documenting his and his fellow artists' work. Anyway, Terry morphs into street artist ""Mr. Brainwash"" and somehow gets together a massive crew of people to make art for him and then puts on an absurdly massive ""art show"" in L.A. and, with the help of some blurbs by luminaries such as Banksy, the press covers the show and he makes millions. Mr. Brainwash's stuff is nothing but knockoffs of actual street artists and as somebody says he succeeds even quicker than Andy Warhol himself in making meaningless his chosen subjects. And so for example Mr. Brainwash has instead of a Campbell's Soup Can --a giant Campbell's Soup Spray Can. And a bunch of goofy portraits of celebrities and politicians inspired by Warhol's Marilyn Monroe. And a stroke of genius of Mr. Brainwash is the stack of T.V.s built into the shape of a robot. How much? I must have it! And an Elvis holding a toy gun. Sux. The footage of the crowd attending the opening is disgusting. The phonies and pretentious creeps and predictable pseudo-intellectual art gallery claptrap. I guess -no, I know- this is supposed to be funnier than what I found it, but really I just hated the people and the grand poser Mr. Brainwash with his muttonchops and dumb, banal statements and dumb name. It was amusing to hear some of his crew that helped (knowingly?) put on the hoax call him retarded on camera (But in fairness to all, like What is a hoax in this ""art world""?). Now Banksy and Shepard Fairey do express their regrets on camera over what transpired with Terry. Is the joke really on them then? Banks says he'll never help anybody again. Actually that really IS a funny moment and got some chuckles from the crowd. Is it a real sentiment? And Fairley thoughtfully remarks that artists usually take time to develop their styles (unlike Mr. Brainwash). And somebody, I forget who, wonders what this Mr. Brainwash thing all means for the meaning of art, etc. and if there's a joke here then what is the punch line... Hmmm....Maybe I'll find it more amusing and fascinating on dvd if a friend rents it and I'm drunk. But after seeing Exit Through the Gift Shop I have lost interest in street art and have even less faith in humanity or the possibility for meaning through art and the creative spirit of fellow human beings. Thanks. Actually if the whole thing is a joke it is funny, but damn that is really, really twisted. ""Haha you fools! You'll buy anything! Look here is a hack that we supported selling unoriginal knock-offs that invalidates(?) street art culture."" Is this what I failed to appreciate on my initial viewing? Maybe I'll laugh more latter you hipster nihilists. No THAT isn't right. It IS a send-up of crass commercialism, conspicuous consumption and all.Actually, you know who I thought of when I saw this? A vandal known as ""The Splasher"". That'd be a great documentary to ""subvert"" $--- with. The Splasher splashes paint onto street art thereby ruining it in protest of the selling-out of the street art scene. Anyway this character Mr. Brainwash is incredibly lame but, come to think of it, he is more subversive than the Splasher. When crass figures like Terry ""Mr. Brainwash"" Guetta arrive and usurp they are a signaler of decline...  Wait honestly I just laughed out loud when I pictured him. ""Life is Beautiful"" was the name of his multi-million dollar L.A. fake-art show shebang. I 'lol-ed' Well Whatever. Con-art/Street-art. How about calling it F'art. ??????????????$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$[edited: 05-31 into paragraphs for YOU]",3,J'accuse muttonchop$. haha,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,7510,"['Immediate', 'reaction', 'just',

1378443,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B003ZXNCH2,Adam,"[6, 8]","I went into this film not knowing exactly what to expect - for one thing I had very little interest in the topic of Street Art, but I'd read an article about Banksy in the WSJ a while back and the film was recommended by a couple of friends.  I'm glad I gave it a chance, as Exit Through the Gift Shop is a brilliant, hilarious, entertaining, and thought provoking documentary, or mockumentary - I'm not sure which.  The film style reminds me ofThis Is Spinal Tap [Blu-ray] andWhere's Marlowe?, although it's better done and funnier than both.The characters are unforgettable - Banksy, who's face and voice are disguised, serves as a narrator of sorts and is the true mastermind behind the entire experiment.  Banksy is excellent, but the star of the show is Thierry Guetta, a Frenchman who sets out to make a documentary on Street Art.  I do not believe in narrating the story in my reviews due to spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say that Thierry has an overabundance of energy and passion for his work and the art he pursues but he lacks the organization and formal training (i.e. proper editing, narration) to produce a refined final work.  Thierry's character is a classic underdog - a clueless yet talented (in some respects) dreamer that the audience can't help but root for.  When Banksy and Thierry finally meet, Banksy turns the tables and Thierry the documenter becomes the documented, with hilarious results.Exit Through the Gift shop is extremely funny - laugh out loud funny, from beginning to end.  But unlike most comedies, Exit Through the Gift Shop actually asks a thought provoking question - What is Art?  I'm not quite sure how to formulate my answer at this point, and the film certainly demands a second viewing, but through Thierry and the challenge he's set upon Bansky does an incredible job of framing the question.I mentioned at the beginning of this review I didn't have much interest in the subject matter of Street Art, and moreover when I saw the film I dragged with me a friend and his wife who had even less interest than I.  They went in with sort of a ""really Adam, what are you getting us into?"" attitude (along with 4th who went much more willingly) ... at the end of the film the four of us looked at each other and simultaneously mouthed ""wow"".  I haven't done any research on the film after the fact and honestly I can't tell you how much of this ""documentary"" is staged/preplanned/hoax and how much is real (my guess is something in the middle), but either way it was well worth the price of admission.Exit Through the Gift Shop is excellent - hilarious, thought provoking, and most importantly it includes original and genuinely likable characters.  Whether you're interested in Street Art or into the ""indie"" film scene or not, this one is worth buying, and I say that as someone who doesn't buy very many DVDs/Bluray in the age of netflix.Five stars.",5,What is art?,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,2899,"['went', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'topic', 'Street', 'Art', ""'d"", 'read', 'article', 'Banksy', 'WSJ', 'while', 'back', 'film', 'was', 'recommended', 'couple', 'friends', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'chance', 'Exit', 'Gift', 'Shop', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'documentary', 'mockumentary', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'style', 'Spinal', 'Tap', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Marlowe', 'better', 'done', 'funnier', 'both.The', 'characters', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'Banksy', 'who', 'face', 'voice', 'are', 'disguised', 'narrator', 'sorts', 'true', 'mastermind', 'entire', 'experiment', 'Banksy', 'excellent', 'star', 'show', 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'out', 'make', 'documentary', 'Street', 'Art', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'narrating', 'story', 'reviews', 'due', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'say', 'Thierry', 'overabundance', 'energy', 'passion', 'work', 'art', 'organization', 'formal', 'training', 'i.e', 'proper', 'editing', 'narration', 'produce', 'refined', 'final', 'work', 'Thierry', 'character', 'classic', 'underdog', 'clueless', 'yet', 'talented', 'respects', 'dreamer', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'When', 'Banksy', 'Thierry', 'finally', 'meet', 'Banksy', 'tables', 'Thierry', 'documenter', 'documented', 'hilarious', 'results.Exit', 'Gift', 'shop', 'extremely', 'funny', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'beginning', 'end', 'most', 'comedies', 'Exit', 'Gift', 'Shop', 'actually', 'thought', 'provoking', 'question', 'What', 'Art', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'formulate', 'answer', 'point', 'film', 'certainly', 'second', 'viewing', 'Thierry', 'challenge', 'set', 'Bansky', 'incredible', 'job', 'framing', 'question.I', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'interest', 'subject', 'matter', 'Street', 'Art', 'moreover', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'dragged', 'friend', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'even', 'less', 'interest', 'went', 'sort', 'really', 'Adam', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'attitude', '4th', 'who', 'went', 'much', 'more', 'willingly', 'end', 'film', 'four', 'looked', 'other', 'simultaneously', 'mouthed', 'wow', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'research', 'film', 'fact', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'documentary', 'staged/preplanned/hoax', 'how', 'much', 'real', 'guess', 'something', 'middle', 'way', 'was', 'well', 'price', 'admission.Exit', 'Gift', 'Shop', 'excellent', 'hilarious', 'thought', 'provoking', 'most', 'importantly', 'original', 'genuinely', 'likable', 'characters', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Street', 'Art', 'indie', 'film', 'scene', 'not', 'one', 'worth', 'buying', 'say', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'buy', 'very', 'many', 'DVDs/Bluray', 'age', 'netflix.Five', 'stars']",Exit Through The Gift Shop

1378447,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B003ZXNCH2,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","Exit Through the Gift Shop: A Banksy Film is a film directed by Banksy that tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles, and his obsession with street art. The film charts Guetta's constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader, to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Shepard Fairey and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta's eventual fame as a street artist himself.Much has been hinted at that the film is actually a hoax but it was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Documentary Feature. Banksy, the pseudonymous British street artist, has built his reputation on stunts -- like inserting his own work among the masters' in museums -- that taunted the market in which his pieces sold for millions. But with his latest project, the documentary ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" he is laboring to convince audiences that he's playing it straight.The blogs buzzed with rumours: that Mr Brainwash is nothing but a front for Banksy; even that he is Bansky. As the film picked up acclaim at Sundance and then Berlin, Mr Brainwash's career has taken off. If the film was intended as a satire on the superficiality of the contemporary art scene, the satire was going over the heads of the buyers forking out $50,000 to $200,000 a canvas. ""It doesn't matter if he is good or bad,"" one said. ""He has the right connections, and that's why I am buying. Plus, I like him.""Ultimately, wondering whether ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is real or not may be moot.

If so, well, that would be the ultimate Dada type joke of the millennium on the high-brow/museum/buyer/dealer circuit. Either way, it's a great film and says a lot about art. Shows how drive, more than any thing else, is the line between artist and non artist. Talent, skill, opinion, and all else are just secondary. When anyone produces a pile of art, (some might say junk) they are, for better or for worse, an artist. I think Bansky and Fairey recognize this and they show this no talent Brainwash ""Jeff Koons"" type got a zoo of people to make him into a brand name the masses ate up (supposedly) like garbage. Phony or not, It was entirely fascinating and forces the viewer to consider the idea of art and what it is and why people want it,  just like a gift shop forces you to consider buying something you likely don't need.Addition...I suspect it was real and about 2/3 of the way through the real person, video dude is fictionalized as a pseudo street artist Brainwash. It gets too hokey there to be real. The film makers can claim it's ""real"" all they want. They took a real person and made him an artist at the end. That last 1/3 was just too contrived. It's a statement about what is art and whhat exactly makes someone an artist. If they admitted it was partially contrived the discussion would end and it is the debate, the discussion that the filmmaker wants. He wants us to consider the garbage in the gift shop, the art, it's value as a commodity and it's monitory worth. The film was well constructed beyond it's surface and pushes deep into society and art as a reaction and also a sometimes misunderstood esoteric obtuse nonsense juxtapositions, viewed and often misunderstood by non artists and as sometimes mistakenly created by artists in today's directionless over saturated world who many times just do not know what to create, even though they are driven to create something and they don't know why or what to make.

Even he is uncertain just what the difference is, or if indeed there is any real difference. This film (which is itself another example of Banksy's talent for appropriation) is Banksy's way of examining & commenting on his generation's countercultural confusion. Banksy's film shows us that most people in his generation (but especially Thierry Guetta) are more interested in ""hype"" & ""cool"" & ""image"" than they are in any real countercultural message or politics.In the beginning its Thierry Guetta who wields the camera, but once Bansky identifies Guetta as inept & appropriates his footage, he brings to the project the critical eye & intelligence that Thierry Guetta lacked. The most fascinating thing that Bansky does is turn that critical eye (that is the camera) on himself. So for me, the most interesting section of the film is what Bansky does with Thierry Guetta's documentary footage of his own theft, transformation, & re-installation of a British telephone booth. What Bansky seems to realize while putting this footage together is that he ""Banksy"" has now become so famous that when passersby encounter the hatcheted telephone booth in the middle of London they know it is a ""Banksy"" who created the object. The artist's own reputation/notoriety is what excites people; the actual art object and message are secondary to the growing mystique of the artist. This is one of the many insights afforded by this clever film. And Banksy surely puts the hatchet in his own street artist mystique when he hosts an exhibition of his work in an LA wearhouse. What Banksy seems to be documenting (intentionally or no) is his evolution from street artist to Jeff Koons-styled art brat but not being certain whether this marks a progression or a step backward. So, the film is both a unique and fascinating portrait of the street art & gallery world of the 80's & 90's, but also a self-portrait of the artist at a transitional point in his life & career. Will be interesting to see if Bansky makes more films.The way Bansky tells the story it would seem that the best street artists (just as artists in other time periods who worked with more conventional methods & mediums) are waging a kind of warfare over the meaning of images & over the way we perceive things & construct our realities. Unfortunately, the people who defuse such movements are often the artists themselves, or at least the hack street artists among them, who are just cashing in on cool.The best film of the year.",5,Visual Punk,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,2586,"['Public', 'space', 'image', 'appropriater', 'Banksy', 'punk', 'hero', 'just', 'mod', 'con', 'make', 'Even', 'uncertain', 'just', 'what', 'difference', 'indeed', 'real', 'difference', 'film', 'example', 'Banksy', 'talent', 'appropriation', 'Banksy', 'way', 'examining', 'commenting', 'generation', 'countercultural', 'confusion', 'Banksy', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'generation', 'especially', 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'hype', 'cool', 'image', 'are', 'real', 'countercultural', 'message', 'politics.In', 'beginning', 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'who', 'camera', 'once', 'Bansky', 'identifies', 'Guetta', 'inept', 'footage', 'project', 'critical', 'eye', 'intelligence', 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'lacked', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'Bansky', 'turn', 'critical', 'eye', 'camera', 'So', 'most', 'interesting', 'section', 'film', 'what', 'Bansky', 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'documentary', 'footage', 'own', 'theft', 'transformation', 're-installation', 'British', 'telephone', 'booth', 'What', 'Bansky', 'realize', 'putting', 'footage', 'together', 'Banksy', 'now', 'become', 'so', 'famous', 'when', 'passersby', 'encounter', 'hatcheted', 'telephone', 'booth', 'middle', 'London', 'know', 'Banksy', 'who', 'created', 'object', 'artist', 'own', 'reputation/notoriety', 'what', 'people', 'actual', 'art', 'object', 'message', 'are', 'secondary', 'growing', 'mystique', 'artist', 'one', 'many', 'insights', 'afforded', 'clever', 'film', 'Banksy', 'surely', 'hatchet', 'own', 'street', 'artist', 'mystique', 'when', 'exhibition', 'work', 'LA', 'wearhouse', 'What', 'Banksy', 'be', 'documenting', 'intentionally', 'evolution', 'street', 'artist', 'Jeff', 'Koons-styled', 'art', 'brat', 'not', 'being', 'certain', 'progression', 'step', 'backward', 'So', 'film', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'street', 'art', 'gallery', 'world', '80', '90', 'also', 'self-portrait', 'artist', 'transitional', 'point', 'life', 'career', 'Will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Bansky', 'more', 'films.The', 'way', 'Bansky', 'story', 'would', 'seem', 'best', 'street', 'artists', 'just', 'artists', 'other', 'time', 'periods', 'who', 'worked', 'more', 'conventional', 'methods', 'mediums', 'are', 'waging', 'kind', 'warfare', 'meaning', 'images', 'way', 'perceive', 'things', 'construct', 'realities', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'who', 'defuse', 'such', 'movements', 'are', 'often', 'artists', 'least', 'hack', 'street', 'artists', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'cashing', 'cool.The', 'best', 'film', 'year']",Exit Through The Gift Shop

Sorel ""book lovah""","[0, 0]","I took a chance on this documentary because both Entertainment Weekly and Netflix recommended it though there was little explanation as to what it is about besides that everyone should see it. After viewing this documentary twice I have to agree, everyone must see this film!I will try to explain what it is about without giving too much of its intrigue away. Basically, the film starts as a documentary of street art in LA in recent years and the man who filmed it: Thierry Guetta. To say that Guetta is an avid amateur videographer, is a gross understatement. Guetta filmed every waking minute of his life, so when he became interested in street art...her filmed every second of that! Through his obsession, he was able to meet famous street artists including Space Invader, Shepard Fairey and eventually Banksy (the director of Exit Through the Gift Shop). Banksy takes Guetta under his wing and shows Guetta the secret ways of the street artist. Eventually, Guetta is asked what he is doing with all of the film he takes to which he responds that he is making a documentary on street art. It is when Guetta must actually make a documentary that Exit Through the Gift Shop takes an interesting path (I won't spoil it for you here).There are so many intriguing aspects about this film but I think the most interesting is the current controversy that this entire documentary is just another one of Banksy's pranks.

I look at the graffiti strewn box cars and marvel at how totally ugly they are. Then one will happen by that was obviously done by someone who had something more in mind. An actual work of art. It reminds me that not everyone indulging in this endeavor is a mindless gang-banger whose only need is to mark his spot.This is a nifty documentary about an immigrant Frenchman with an obsession for video taping nearly every waking hour of his life. He happens across the ""street art"" thing and now must find these artists and document them and their work. He even manages to spend an enormous amount of time with the king of all street artists, Banksy, as he goes on his night time excursions to place as much art on buildings as possible. He then takes the next leap and becomes an obscenely prolific and popular artist himself.Living just outside of Chicago, I have seen some really cool building art. Some of it has been every bit as imaginative as its attention grabbing counterparts hanging in pop art galleries, but much of what is shown in this film makes much of what I've seen pale by comparison.The Frenchman, Thierry Guetta, is a real character. Even with his broken English, he has a way of expressing himself that grabbed my attention. As a successful retailer, he had the means to support his video taping habit which, even he admits, is like a drug. That he finds the subject, street art, that allows him to focus his attention is something everyone gains from. I simply never thought much about street artists and this was a real eye-opener. Many of them are sincere about their format(s) and they are doing a lot to push the envelope. There is a lot of cool and clever artwork shown in this film. Any number of these pieces I would love to have framed and hanging in my home. The act of selling the artwork is what fuels the final act of this documentary.As Terry shifts from documenter to artist, and produces an expensive, lavish showing of his own work, it brings into question the entire philosophy of street arts and artists. Is Terry any good and should he be doing this? The argument is that he turns the whole idea about street art around and puts it back into a purely commercial pop business. Not where the artists feel it should be.This is an interesting and informative look at this amazing and unusual segment of the art world.

Many of these artists are truly amazing, and the efforts they go to in pursuit of venues and canvases are equally amazing. In the process, though, the public interest has turned those such as the enigmatic Banksy into sellable properties. Banksy, while making political statements on the West Bank wall and other places, decides to cash in on the growing fame and does a huge show in L.A. that drew Hollywood's brightest stars. In so doing, he makes street art into something marketable on a grand scale. Was this his intention? We don't know. Conveniently, he never lets us know how much he made.He does, however, use this film to set up the French filmmaker Thierry asan artist to be mocked. Thierry, good at documenting but not good at putting together a cohesive film, decides to put on a show of his in L.A. By some miracle, he pulls it off, flirting with financial ruin to make it happen, and ends up making a lot of money and a new name for himself as Mr. Brainwash. Yes, his art is derivative, and no, he did not pay his dues. He becomes a slightly pathetic, slightly comedic figure in all of this. But Banksy also cashes in, while not playing as honestly by letting us in on the details of his prestige and income in the art world. He also, glaringly, fails to explain how some of these artists travel the world. Perhaps it's all part of protecting identity, but it is a question that begs to be answered throughout the film.All of it, nonetheless, makes for some highly entertaining documentary work, and calls into question the ideas of marketing, art, and whether art can be objectively judged for its own merits or merely subjectively judged by those who buy into the hype, as in the case of Mr. Brainwash. In the end, maybe Mr. Brainwash is right. Maybe life is beautiful in the midst of all the brainwashing.

It's a generational minder-binder, a challenge to any conservative's most fundamental instinct of order and propriety. It's a film by and about... gasp! ... ""street artists!""My acrobatic 20-year-old son, who has been a highly-paid 'street performer' at the Circus Festival in Montreal and who used to delight in scratching his name in fresh cement, lured me into watching ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" with him. I doubt I'd ever have known of it otherwise, though I live in a city where murals on any vacant walls are treated with reverence. The director of the film is the mysterious Briton 'Banksy' - a street artist so famous that there are guidebooks to his work in London and protective plastic sheets over his few pieces in San Francisco. Banksy includes himself both as subject and as narrator in his film, electronically muffling his voice and shrouding his face in darkness. Another well-known street artist - Shephard Fairey of Los Angeles - appears openly and turns out to be startlingly clean-cut, the boy next door 1950s style. The prolific Space Invader, whose little mosaics of plastic cubes are everywhere in Paris, plays an essential role in the film as he introduces his 'cousin' Thierry Guetta to the excitement of nocturnal tagging. First challenge here: where are the lines to be drawn between malicious defacement, playful self-assertion, defiant creativity, free-speech demonstration against repressive authority, and the highly skilled art of Banksy and others whose aesthetic includes outlaw outrage? Indeed, are there lines? And who really has the ""right"" to delineate? What art is sacrosanct, if any, and why?The central character in the film is Thierry Guetta, and the chief enjoyment of the film is the bafflement of trying to make sense of a guy who is either an obsessive-compulsive idiot-savant, or a genius at self-promotion, or a total fluke. Guetta first appears as an immigrant small-business-owner family man who gets a video camera as a gift from his wife and who 'goes nuts' taking pictures of everything everywhere all the time. Eventually he finds his bizarre niche as the documenter of street artists at work. I won't short-circuit the development of his career any further.The cinematography of this film is as random and amateurish as most street art, and that's exactly what makes it both authentic and fascinating. When one street artist metaphorically scratches his head about the work of another, and declares that the other hasn't 'played by the rules,' you will KNOW that you've wandered into unsurveyed ethical/aesthetic territory.",5,If You're As 'Conservative' As I Am ...,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,2845,"['person', 'who', 'opera', 'lot', 'seldom', 'walks', 'grass', 'when', 'sign', 'prohibiting', 'quiet', 'restaurants', 'clean', 'white', 'restroom', 'walls', 'occasionally', 'feels', 'resentful', 'sprawling', 'graffiti', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'challenge', 'receptivity', 'generational', 'minder-binder', 'challenge', 'conservative', 'most', 'fundamental', 'instinct', 'order', 'propriety', 'film', 'gasp', 'street', 'artists', 'acrobatic', '20-year-old', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'highly-paid', ""'street"", 'performer', 'Circus', 'Festival', 'Montreal', 'who', 'used', 'delight', 'scratching', 'name', 'fresh', 'cement', 'lured', 'watching', 'Exit', 'Gift', 'Shop', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'ever', 'have', 'known', 'otherwise', 'live', 'city', 'where', 'murals', 'vacant', 'walls', 'are', 'treated', 'reverence', 'director', 'film', 'mysterious', 'Briton', ""'Banksy"", 'street', 'artist', 'so', 'famous', 'are', 'guidebooks', 'work', 'London', 'protective', 'plastic', 'sheets', 'few', 'pieces', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Banksy', 'subject', 'narrator', 'film', 'electronically', 'muffling', 'voice', 'shrouding', 'face', 'darkness', 'well-known', 'street', 'artist', 'Shephard', 'Fairey', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'openly', 'out', 'be', 'startlingly', 'clean-cut', 'boy', 'next', 'door', '1950s', 'style', 'prolific', 'Space', 'Invader', 'little', 'mosaics', 'plastic', 'cubes', 'are', 'everywhere', 'Paris', 'essential', 'role', 'film', ""'cousin"", 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'excitement', 'nocturnal', 'tagging', 'First', 'challenge', 'here', 'where', 'are', 'lines', 'be', 'drawn', 'malicious', 'defacement', 'playful', 'self-assertion', 'defiant', 'creativity', 'free-speech', 'demonstration', 'repressive', 'authority', 'highly', 'skilled', 'art', 'Banksy', 'others', 'aesthetic', 'outlaw', 'outrage', 'Indeed', 'are', 'there', 'lines', 'who', 'really', 'right', 'delineate', 'What', 'art', 'sacrosanct', 'why', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'Thierry', 'Guetta', 'chief', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'bafflement', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'guy', 'who', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'idiot-savant', 'genius', 'self-promotion', 'total', 'fluke', 'Guetta', 'first', 'immigrant', 'small-business-owner', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'video', 'camera', 'gift', 'wife', 'who', 'nuts', 'taking', 'pictures', 'everything', 'everywhere', 'time', 'Eventually', 'bizarre', 'niche', 'documenter', 'street', 'artists', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'short-circuit', 'development', 'career', 'further.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'random', 'amateurish', 'most', 'street', 'art', 'exactly', 'what', 'authentic', 'fascinating', 'When', 'one', 'street', 'artist', 'metaphorically', 'head', 'work', 'other', ""n't"", ""'played"", 'rules', 'will', 'KNOW', ""'ve"", 'wandered', 'unsurveyed', 'ethical/aesthetic', 'territory']",Exit Through The Gift Shop

1378468,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003ZXNCH2,Haunted Flower,"[7, 10]","""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is a documentary comedy of sorts about the unsuccessful making of a documentary about street art/graffiti. When French designer clothes shop owner, Thierry Guetta becomes obsessed with recording his everyday life on film, he finds a muse in capturing street artists at night creating their work. His passion results in tapes upon tapes upon tapes by the thousands of famous street artists like Space Invader, Shepard Fairey, and the fiercely anonymous Banksy with a global reputation for his work on the Palestinian West Bank among other projects.What is graffiti? What is art? Does it depend solely on its location? Or just whether or not people judge it as good? I can't answer these questions alone, but personally if it were my building, I'd be pretty ticked unless it were amazing and helped attract business.Thierry begins with his cousin who goes by the handle, Space Invader because he shapes pieces out of cubes to recreate images of characters from that video game and Pac-Man and places them everywhere. Through that relationship, Thierry comes into contact with Shepard Fairey who created the iconic image of Andre the Giant's face with the word ""OBEY"" underneath that has become recognizable in pop culture and is best known as the creator of the Barack Obama ""Hope"" poster. Street artists use a variety of techniques including props (a blow-up doll, a mutated phone booth), giant stickers, stencils to spray paint through, and of course the good ol' freestyle spray-painting method most of us are familiar with when we think of the trade. There is a spirit of creativity and passion mixed with stealth and plotting with look-outs to avoid the cops that makes the profession exciting to those involved. Repetition of similar images and signatures is what makes artists arise from utter obscurity to some sort of notoriety and sense of validity.The film has short segments of interviews with Thierry and a mysterious hooded man in black with a voice-changer whom we eventually find out is Banksy. Banksy is Thierry's own white whale, the most difficult artist to track down that no one knows contact information for and the harder he is to find, the more he is needed for the footage collection. Banksy's spirit of doing it for the love of making a statement is preached heavily in the film despite his choice to put on an art show that attracted quite a bit of media coverage and money.What is fascinating about this film is its surprise in direction. After all, it starts with family footage of Thierry, branches out into graffiti, and his aspirations to make a documentary about it. When the artists get to view Thierry's edited film, ""Life by Remote Control"", it looks like it could cause an epileptic seizure with all the hummingbird editing and acid color changes. Banksy who has a directing credit on this film gives Thierry some busy work so he can recover the footage and put it in a watchable format since Thierry is a lousy editor. The camera gets turned back on Thierry to watch as he pursues his own art career at the prodding of Banksy. What follows is very amusing as Thierry takes everything he learned through observing as a jumping off point to assemble his own army of artists to attempt to create something larger than any of his predecessors much to their surprise.Thierry is a mystery. Thierry can come off as an idiot, he forms sentences in English in an awkwardly but entertaining way, and somehow manages accidentally to bring genius to his own promotions and art. He has such a scattered, disorganized personality and it makes him difficult to work with. For example, soon before the opening of his big show, some promoters show up to take care of some of the detail work to allow Thierry more time just to choose his pieces to put on the walls....which he STILL fails to start until 8 hours beforehand. This leads the promoter after interacting with him several times to conclude ""he might be a little retarded"" and just take over certain aspects and throwing things up to finish the job.Hearing the other artists comment on Thierry's journey, they can't help but muster astonishment, jealousy, and a little bitterness at his clumsy becoming of an overnight sensation.

He starts filming in L.A. and fastens on the ""master"" Shepard Fairey, an extremely handsome young man, whose ""Obey"" and his Obama piece have become famous (there's a book of his work titled ""Obey"").This street art is about one level up from graffiti, and, of course is done illegally, clandestinely  on public and private property. This documentary shows the leading figures of the genre in America, England, France, and other parts of the world.Banksy, an English ""artist"" who was very elusive finally revealed himself to Thierry and allowed himself to be filmed. Banksy was one of the artists who morphed into a pop artist and had a big pop art show in L.A. called ""Barely Legal"" with a live elephant painted in vivid pink. His installation of a V shaped red English phone booth was clever and became iconic. In the film his voice is disguised, and he is shown in semi-darkness wearing a hood.Thierry becomes a street artist himself, then morphs into a pop artist calling himself ""Mr. Brainwash."" He has a huge show called ""Life is Beautiful"" in L.A. and sells more than a million dollars worth of stuff the first day. Much of the art will remind you of Andy Warhol and is often derivative rather than highly original though some of it is clever and comic.At the end of the film Banksy and Fairey comment on Thierry's work, and they regard his work as a rip-off. The film itself and Thierry as a pop artist may all be a Banksy hoax.As a documentary it is cleverly done, funny at times, and a commentary on the strange world we live in where art has no intrinsic value. Some viewers of this film will be annoyed by these so-called street artists who keep depositing their ""art"" all over streets and buildings where it often constitutes litter and not the beautification of buildings but desecration. Graffiti in many major cities added to urban blight and decay.It's a fascinating view of a world most of us know little about.

Ryan ""JRyan""","[1, 2]","Exit Through the Gift Shop is an incredibly interesting film that begs the question that has been asked millions of times over again: what is art? *sips latt&egrave;* *adjusts glasses*The movie starts out as one man's (Thierry Guetta) habit of always carrying a video camera and filming everything around him. He soon accidentally stumbles upon the growing and subversive (an underground word for `underground') world of street art. This habit of his turns into an obsession, as he begins to constantly follow these artists around at night to capture this somewhat mysterious world.One of the reasons these artists allow him to film them is because street art is a very unique art form in that it is constantly being created and destroyed. When Guetta tells them that he is making a documentary about it, they look at this film as a way to actually preserve their art for once.There is a problem, however: Guetta isn't a filmmaker at all. In fact, he originally never intended on watching these tapes ever again. He was simply filming for the sake of filming. That is, until he had the opportunity to meet and follow around the most famous and elusive street artist of all time: Banksy. Part director, part watchdog, part instructor, Guetta gives us a glimpse into the world of a reclusive street artist whose work now sells for thousands of dollars at art shows across the world.  And then things start to get interesting... and confusing.Though Guetta himself filmed most of the footage, it is Banksy who is in the director's chair for this film after he quickly realizes the original man behind the camera is far more interesting than any of the artists who were in front of it. What follows is a fascinating turn of events that culminates into something that is part documentary, part social commentary, and quite possibly part prank. Nonetheless, Exit Through the Gift Shop is an excellent film that makes you question the somewhat arbitrary line that has been drawn between art and vandalism, and how it is often times people's reaction to something that helps draw that  line.",4,Is it real?

The film details a very strange Frenchman named Tierry who has lately become OBSESSED with video-recording his life. He films every single second of it, afraid that he will lose his family memories and so forth if they are not fastidiously documented. There doesn't seem to be much of an artistic motive at first, until Tierry meets up with his cousin Space Invader, a local street artist, and starts documenting his night-life, scaling rooftops and laying out stencils of his iconic 8-bit themed artwork. Gradually, Tierry is drawn into the world of street art this way. He meets more and more people, most of them shown with their faces obscured to protect them since street art is essentially vandalism in the eyes of the law. One exception is Shepard Ferry, a good looking roguish California artist who did that famous Barack Obama poster we all saw a year ago. Shepard inevitably introduces Tierry to the mad British rebel Banksy, who appears in the film only in a shadowed cloak, his voice ominously deepened electronically. Tierry is excited to meet him and become his merry cameraman and accomplice. He films and films...and films some more.The film is ultimately an in-depth examination of the way we perceive and develop art. Tierry's inevitably decision to turn the camera on himself is incredibly interesting. As he dons the persona Mr. Brain Wash and starts to make his own bizarre Andy Warhol esque art (a Campbell's Soup icon turned into a spray paint can takes focus in his art show), a lot of his contemporaries, Ferry, Banksy, etc. begin to elicit not a small amount of grumbles. The implication is that they have paid their dues and have inherent messages in their work, Banksy specifically, as his art is almost unanimously anti-corporate and outrageously so (SPOILERS: axed phone booths, kids with balloons painted on the wall of a war zone, a delightful Guantanamo Bay prisoner blowup doll expertly placed in Disney Land providing one of the best scenes of the movie and so forth END SPOILERS). Tierry invades the art world and makes a lot of money. His journey is 100% worth taking, even if you aren't a big fan of modern art. His zeal is infectious and you can't help but be swept along through the madness. Relatedly, if you haven't seen it, check out Banksy's Simpsons couch gag, it is deadly smart.This film is not ""his"" in the classical sense in that he only cobbled together what Tierry recorded and slapped his name across it, making something so weird and anti-commercial paradoxically acceptable by the masses.

1378482,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003ZXNCH2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[73, 77]","Having heard much praise heaped on the art world documentary ""Exit Through The Gift Shop,"" I expected to enjoy the film although I had no inherent interest in the graffiti scene.  But the film is a sly examination of what constitutes art in the modern era.  What starts out as a conventional biography turns into one of the most pointed satires about this topic that I've ever seen.  (Coincidentally, I just watched the fictional comedy ""(Untitled)"" which covers many of the same themes and offers an equally savage skewering of the hype and pretensions to be found in this world).  I didn't, however, realize that I was specifically aware of the film's subject matter.  I lived in Los Angeles during the pivotal time period presented in the movie, and I remember and recognize the major event that dominates the film's second half.  Of course, I didn't have an insider's knowledge of how it came about--and I had no idea that learning the story would be so patently absurd or that it would have me laughing out loud!That's right, for me, ""Exit Through The Gift Shop"" works as a comedy.  I was entertained by the more conventional first half, but I was delighted by the ridiculous turn of events for the finale!  The film follows Thierry Guetta, an amateur documentarian that becomes obsessed by the world of street art.  With a camera constantly at the ready, Guetta insinuates himself into this underground community.  He's an oddball, to be sure, traveling the globe and leaving his family to endlessly film footage without ever constructing a final product.  When he teams up with one of Britain's most elusive talents (Banksy), the two become virtually inseparable.  Banksy eventually steps into the spotlight with an upscale show in Los Angeles, asks what's going on with the documentary, and is perplexed by the hastily assembled disaster that Guetta finally presents.  Banksy keeps the footage to see if he can put something more coherent together and sends Guetta off to put together a small show of his own art.As Guetta returns to stage an art spectacular, ""Exit Through The Gift Shop"" ramps up into overdrive.  More concerned with hype and promotion than artistic integrity, Guetta forges an alter ego, employs a production team, and starts to mass produce derivative work based on classic pop art or recognizable pop iconography.  Art as commerce--Guetta fashions himself a star!  And if you tell enough people you're a genius, the word gets around.  ""Exit Through The Gift Shop,"" in the end, becomes an indictment of gullibility and hype--but also of success.  The madcap and over-the-top antics of this self deluded narcissist becomes the year's most scathing comedy, all the more absurd because it's real.  Banksy, never showing his face, claims credit for the resultant documentary--now about Guetta as opposed to the real street artists.  And it is this sly shift of expectations and presentation that makes the film a unique entry into the documentary field.  A lot of fun, but in a truly disturbing way!

From the opening of the film, however, it's clear that this documentary is not going to go down that route.The star of this film is not Banksy, it's actually the cameraman who films him, a French man by the name of Thierry Guetta. Thierry is an odd man who obsessively films everything in his life, and he stumbles upon the world of street art almost coincidentally. The film follows his exploits filming famed street artists (including Banksy) and his unlikely path into street art himself. The direction of the film changes significantly a few times, and it does take some getting used to, but in the end, it makes perfect sense, or no sense at all.Speculations have arisen that the whole film is in fact a hoax, created by Banksy, with many questioning the authenticity of Thierry's portrayal. Whether or not it's a ""hoax"", this film is definitely the best documentary I've seen this year (not that I've seen many).

While visiting Los Angeles in 2006, Banksy was introduced to a French &eacute;migr&eacute; named Thierry Guetta, who compulsively films everything he sees. Thierry had been introduced to street art in 2000 by his cousin, who calls himself ""Invader"" for the Space Invader art that he plasters everywhere. Thierry found a focus: He would film street artists. Back in L.A., he filmed the artist Shepard Fairey and learned the process of making street art in all the best spots in L.A. So, when the celebrated and elusive Banksy needed an assistant, Thierry was the perfect person to show him around the city.Thierry was supposedly making a documentary about street artists -and epic documentary judging by the quantity of film footage. But when Banksy finally puts Thierry on the spot about the documentary, it becomes clear that Thierry is no filmmaker. He records everything but has no ambitions for his collection of documentary evidence. So Banksy takes on the project himself, sifting through over 10,000 hours of footage. In an inspired moment, Banksy decides that the film should be about Thierry Guetta rather than about street artists. So this compulsive filmmaker who became the documentarian of so many street artists becomes the subject of a street artist documentary.But the story doesn't end there. While Banksy tries to put the film together, he encourages Thierry to pursue his fledgling artistic ambitions. He doesn't expect that Thierry will take all he has learned from other artists and try to do them one better by producing computer-generated street art on a commercial scale and putting on a huge art show that will net $1 million. Thierry doesn't know much about art or art shows, in fact, but he does understand hype, and, whatever else he may lack, he does have guts.

1378494,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B003ZXNCH2,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","So there's this French guy (Thierry) who runs a vintage clothing boutique in L.A., and who's obsessed with shooting video.  He captures everything he can - no matter how boring or profound, and just throws his tapes into boxes ... until he finds something fascinating to follow and make a film about, and doesn't have a clue what to do with it.  It turns out his cousin is the semi-famous street artist, ""Space Intruder."" He introduces Thierry to the world of street art, where he ends up meeting Banksy, the most famous and elusive of them all, and gets inspired to be an artist in his own right, whether or not he has anything original to say.  This all takes place as the art market is discovering street art, and what had been transgressive acts of artistic rebellion put up in secret are now becoming costly and coveted and displayed with pride by the same museums that Banksy once had to sneak into in order to place his work.  When Banksy discovers that the guy has no idea how to make the film that this movement calls for with all his material, he decides to take on the task of making the film himself.  It becomes a film about the obsessive guy with a camera who wanted to make a film about street artists and became Mr. Brainwash, either the ultimate con-artist or the true artist who revealed that all art is a con, a ""brainwash scheme,"" and still managed to make money with it.  Of course, as some have alleged, the film itself could be just another Banksy prank.  It's fun to watch and pretty fascinating regardless.  It ranks up there with Orson Welles'sF for Fakeas an exploration of the art world and its apparent charlatans, who nevertheless manage to produce work that can't simply be dismissed.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in modern art, but it's portrait of what looks to be an impending trainwreck should be suspenseful and intriguing enough for almost any audience.",4,"If it sells, it's art? - an intriguing and amusing take on the rise (and fall?) of the underground world of street art",1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1903,"['French', 'guy', 'Thierry', 'who', 'vintage', 'clothing', 'boutique', 'L.A.', 'who', 'obsessed', 'shooting', 'video', 'everything', 'can', 'matter', 'how', 'boring', 'profound', 'just', 'throws', 'tapes', 'boxes', 'something', 'fascinating', 'follow', 'make', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'out', 'cousin', 'semi-famous', 'street', 'artist', 'Space', 'Intruder', 'Thierry', 'world', 'street', 'art', 'where', 'up', 'meeting', 'Banksy', 'most', 'famous', 'elusive', 'inspired', 'be', 'artist', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'anything', 'original', 'say', 'place', 'art', 'market', 'discovering', 'street', 'art', 'had', 'been', 'transgressive', 'acts', 'artistic', 'rebellion', 'put', 'up', 'secret', 'are', 'now', 'becoming', 'costly', 'coveted', 'displayed', 'pride', 'same', 'museums', 'Banksy', 'once', 'had', 'sneak', 'order', 'place', 'work', 'When', 'Banksy', 'guy', 'idea', 'how', 'make', 'film', 'movement', 'material', 'take', 'task', 'making', 'film', 'film', 'obsessive', 'guy', 'camera', 'who', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'street', 'artists', 'became', 'Mr.', 'Brainwash', 'either', 'ultimate', 'con-artist', 'true', 'artist', 'who', 'revealed', 'art', 'con', 'brainwash', 'scheme', 'still', 'managed', 'make', 'money', 'course', 'have', 'alleged', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'Banksy', 'prank', 'fun', 'watch', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'regardless', 'there', 'Orson', ""Welles'sF"", 'Fakeas', 'exploration', 'art', 'world', 'apparent', 'charlatans', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'manage', 'produce', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'be', 'dismissed', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'modern', 'art', 'portrait', 'what', 'be', 'impending', 'trainwreck', 'should', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'almost', 'audience']",Exit Through The Gift Shop

A genteel mob-mentality?  This is one of the main questions that the wonderful documentary EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP asks...perhaps without knowing it is asking.Sometimes documentaries are about something and then the filmmaker surprises us with a twist in the story they are documenting.  In this case, the film is about one thing and suddenly it not only turns out to be about something else...it's actually being created by someone else.The movie starts in 1999, and introduces us to a very eccentric man, Thierry (pronounced more or less ""Terry"") Guetta.  He's a Frenchman who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and 3 kids.  He runs a VERY successful vintage clothing store.  And he's also obsessed with his camcorder.  He films everything around him, all the time.  And it really is an obsession...he films, tosses the full video tape into a box and moves on to the next.  One day, he discovers that his cousin is the well-known graffiti artist Space Invader.  He begins to fill his cousin at work, darting into dark alleys and onto rooftops, putting his video game inspired ""art"" onto buildings...staying one step ahead of the authorities.  Thierry now becomes obsessed with the idea of following these urban artists, and he begins to ingratiate himself with more and more of them.  He's now intent on making a documentary.  And he's also determined to finally meet the most famous graffiti artists of all:  the super-secretive Banksy.And when the world's and obsessions of these two men collide, the movie takes off in an utterly unexpected way.  I don't want to spoil any more of it for you...when I saw it, I had no idea what to expect.  And I was utterly taken by pleasant surprise when tables (and cameras) were turned.Let's just say that in part, the movie asks its questions by showing us the work of these street artists.  What they do is generally illegal or nearly so.  But what they do is also often beautiful, powerful, cool, daring, funny and sometimes all of these.  It sure seems like art.  What would make it NOT be art?  The fact that it's illegal?  The fact that it is by its nature transient (so is performing art)?But with the twists that come later, the movie also asks:  are we, the public, incapable of distinguishing art from hype?  If something grabs our attention in a loud and insistent manner, are we fooled into thinking it's important or meaningful?  Is something full of hype thus incapable of being art?  Is art only art when it become valuable?  Is art only art when it ISN'T valuable?  What is the goal of the artist?  What is the role of the public and the critic?  And so forth.  These questions are never asked explicitly...but they are buried in the fabric of the very interesting story that is being told.I was initially hesitant to watch the film.  I'm not that interested in graffiti or street art.  I know a lot of it is ""cool"" but I still have trouble with people just assuming they are free to put whatever they want on a public (or private) wall.  If you have the same thoughts as me...don't let that stop you from seeing the film.  It's an exceedingly interesting movie on many levels, and frankly, it stirred me on the same intellectual level as a film such as THE SOCIAL NETWORK or INCEPTION did.  It's also funny.  And, except for a few casually tossed expletives and f-bombs...it's surprisingly tame.  The artwork is never hugely offensive.  I'd have been okay with anyone 14 or older seeing this film...and I would actually advise it.  It's provocative and stimulating, in all the right ways.

At times, it's hard even to tell who's the subject of the film and who's the creator.  At some point in the movie, the street artist and the filmmaker switch roles, with the street artist becoming the filmmaker and the filmmaker becoming the street artist.  It's all very mind-blowing and Pirandellian, to say the least, but it sure makes for one hell of a clever and fascinating film.  A bit too clever, perhaps, for there are those who've accused the film of being a hoax, of being just an elaborate work of ""street art"" in its own right.Thierry Guetta is a French &eacute;migr&eacute; living in Los Angeles who has apparently recorded virtually every single moment of his adult life on videotape and film.  A few years into this obsession, Thierry began filming a number of underground ""street artists"" from various cities, as, under the cloak of darkness, they secretly created their works.  These included such well-known figures as Shepherd Fairey (he of the ubiquitous Obama poster) and Bansky, a British artist who had already established quite a reputation for himself in London.  But not only did Thierry film them doing their art, he frequently joined them in the process, often at great risk to his own freedom and safety.It is with Bansky that the movie begins to get truly mind-bending and complicated, for it is he who directed ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" not Thierry, yet he uses Thierry's footage.  So who is the actual maker of the film?  Who can say?  And what does that say about the fluidity of the creative process?  About blurring the line between art and its subject?  (To hide his identity, Bansky appears only in silhouette as he films himself giving interviews for the audience).  Then about halfway through the movie, we discover that Thierry has become a street artist (going by the appellation Mr. Brainwash) himself, sponsoring elaborate gallery shows displaying his own work.And as Thierry begins to achieve fame, fortune and international acclaim as the ""new Wharhol,"" we can't help noting the irony that an art form that originally sprang up as a subversive reaction against the Establishment has now gone full-board mainstream itself, earning millions for its pieces and high-profile celebrity for its artists.  No more furtive forays into the dead-of-night for this dude at least.If you're confused by all this, don't worry.  Even after seeing the film, I still cannot say I understand everything that takes place within it.  But that's just what makes ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" such a unique and trippy experience.  And besides, it offers a rare glimpse into a scene few of us have any real familiarity with, so whether the thing is real or fake doesn't really matter all that much in the end.

But it eventually becomes clear that he is a very bad filmmaker, and that is where the story begins to diverge from reality.IS GUETTA FOR REAL, THEN? Yes and no. The beginning of the film is likely accurate, until he meets Fairey, who determines that Guetta means well, but will never be able to produce a finished documentary.

The people who are hungry, unemployed, suffering at the hands of a for-profit healthcare industry, died for a cause, reign in Dog Town or are Sugar Man himself seldom have the time, energy, money or knowhow to script and film their stories. Documentary stars--most of them--probably never even considered documenting their stories. The same was true for street artists, but they are a horse of a different color. The fact that they, vandals at their best, would let an outsider in to film them was unusual. That the man behind the camera turned out to be a guy who just liked to film things (including thousands of hours of unedited street art film footage), and had no talent for documentary-making, had to be both disappointment and aggravation to the artists who had come to appreciate the idea of chronicling the expression designed to raise awareness of society's malfunction, but--because their messages were posted on other people's walls--seldom had the chance to survive more than a few days. Ultimately, Banksy, the elusive king of the street art counterculture, takes charge and creates a documentary that stars the man who shot the film, but only features the pioneer artists and their work.

1378509,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B003ZXNCH2,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[0, 0]","I thought this was a documentary about Banksy, the world-renowned street artist (read: graffiti vandal), and it is to some extent.  But to a greater extent, Exit Through the Gift Shop : A Banksy Film (2011) is about how anything that is cool and underground necessarily becomes overexposed and mainstream.  This movie was so-so as entertainment but pretty good as a parable of how the cutting edge loses its edge.  Semi-spoiler: this might be a mockumentary.Thierry (pronounced ""Terry""; he's French) Guetta is a film nut.  He also owns a successful vintage clothing shop near Hollywood.  He loves to film everything.  The camera is an omnipresent extension of his hand.  He films and films and films, but he never watches the tapes.  He stores them away in a big closet.  That is, he stored them away until he decided to put his obsession to use and film street artists as they risked life and limb for thrills and recognition.Thierry got into filming street artists late at night as they climbed buildings and billboards to ply their craft.  We learn that these particular graffitos don't only use spray paint.  Oh no.  They head to Kinko's and order up 30 x 40 foot blowups of sketches and paintings, which are applied to walls and signs using industrial-strength glue and paint rollers.  How the cops haven't busted these artists by doing the super sleuthing of calling up the local Kinko's to find out who is spending hundreds of dollars on mega-prints is beyond me.  Although, it is not against the law to blow money on oversized copies, and I presume that these artists are well-known to the fuzz already.In any event, Thierry latches onto Banksy after a successful stint filming another now-famous street artist, Shepard Fairey.  Banksy is a hot commodity at this point, and his work is recognizable around the globe.  Although Banksy hails from London, apparently, he flies around the world to far-flung locales like Los Angeles to paste and scrawl his creative, funny, and political works all over the place.  As his art goes vogue, he starts making bank, which allows him to pursue even more aggressive and ambitious projects and installments.  Banksy's art even graces the West Bank wall.Thierry follows Banksy around.  Thierry is a reliable sidekick, even surviving a run-in with Disney rent-a-cops after a stunt criticizing Gitmo.  But then Theirry gets an idea:  Hey, I can do this.  So, he goes whole hog.  He mortgages all of his property.  He dumps all of the cash into popular street art of his own design and hires a team of crack artists and promoters to manufacture his Banksy-knockoff line of work by ""Mr Brainwash.""This is where I question the reality of this documentary.  Mr Brainwash is too successful too quickly, and Thierry's work is much too similar to Banksy's style.  The implication from the documentary is that Banksy has disavowed Theirry.  Ask yourself whether it is a hoax and whether Banksy is Mr Brainwash.Thierry sells a boatload of art.  He appears to break even and perhaps even turn a handsome profit from his first (humongous, mega) Los Angeles art show.  Street art is selling, which in turn kills it as a cool, rebellious, anti-establishment art form.  When a Banksy piece is selling for tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds at auction, how cool can it be?If you've never heard of Banksy and want to tune in for a phenomenon that was catching steam in the mid-2000s, this is a good bet as a primer.  But don't expect a thrilling story with a ""Wow!"" ending.

Thierry is a Frenchman who emigrated to Los Angeles and started a used clothing shop. He also has some sort of weird Obsessive/Compulsive disorder with video-recording every waking moment he possibly can. Somewhere in the camera era of Thierry's life, he becomes obsessed by street/graffiti artists and begins to tape them and their nocturnal activities. As he climbs the strata of artists, he eventually encounters Banksy. Voila! A film is born.Only one problem. Turns out Thierry is a complete dud as a filmmaker and Banksy takes over the tapes and editing. This is where the film gets interesting. After watching Banksy throw a huge and profitable opening in Los Angeles, Thierry takes Banksy's offhand comment about creativity (Thierry has developed some street art and a personna of his own) to mean that Banksy is approving of Thierry's work and should become the next big name in the artist community. Before you can say 'spray paint,' Thierry is overhauling an old network studio and planning his own, major coming out exhibit.The question is, can art be made just by sheer force of will? Thierry seems like such a savant that his ascension into a world-class artist seems hard to swallow. Even the artists he was filming on his camera seem dumbstruck that this ""character from the 1860's"" could launch himself without much experience; there are some who believe the whole ""Mister Brain Wash"" (as Thierry has now dubbed himself) is one of Banksy's elaborate pranks on the creative universe. That's not to say the film is without entertainment value. Thierry is, despite his loopiness, a charming eccentric; his own determination to hype himself into a success supplies ""Exit Through The Gift Shop"" with humor and interest.

1378512,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B003ZXNCH2,Tom Birkenstock,"[3, 4]","Exit Through the Gift Shop opens with a montage of street artists putting their work on display in a number of precarious locations--along the sides of skyscrapers, across street signs, and over ads for beauty products.  Where the artwork is located, whether elevated to improbable heights or splayed across feckless city ads, becomes just as integral to the overall effect of the art as what is pasted or spraypainted by the artists themselves.  In other words, street art might be the first time in the visual art world where the canvass is just as important as what is displayed on it.  It's a suitable beginning to a film that asks us to question what we see in art and in what ways our reactions to artwork are bound up in how it is presented to us.Exit Through the Gift Shop centers on Thierry Guetta, a French ex-pat living in Los Angeles, and how he descends into the shadowy world of street artists.  Ever since Thierry had received his first camcorder he found himself self-documenting all aspects of his life.  We learn that most of Thierry's early documenting efforts were mostly of the mundane moments of everyday life, and it wasn't until he made a trip back home to France where he encountered his street artist cousin, Invader, that his videolog started to shape itself into some sort of purpose.  After watching his cousin work, Thierry becomes intrigued by the underground art movement that seems to be hiding in plain site on city signs and skyscrapers.  He begins documenting and obsessively following any and all street and graffiti artists he can find, collecting them like baseball cards (or, Pokemon cards for the kids out there).  He even manages to strike up a friendship with America's most ubiquitous street artist, Shepard Fairey, who is mostly famous for his Andre the Giant and They Live mash up, ""Obey,"" as well as his inescapable red and blue Obama profile.In order to find acceptance among the usually reticent group of underground artists, Thierry claims that he is making a documentary.  This sets up a symbiotic relationship between Thierry and the artists he shadows: he needs a subject for his camera and, because of the short lifespan of their artwork, they need documentation.  This leads Thierry to eventually meet the most elusive street artist, Britain's Banksy.  Like most of the street artists featured in the film, Banksy's work is of a distinctly political bent, and perhaps the most memorable moment of the film occurs when Banksy brings an inflatable simulacrum of a Guantanamo prisoner to Disney World.  The presence of a chained and hooded American prisoner in the midst of the most meticulously controlled place on earth naturally erupts into chaos.Eventually Banksy encourages Thierry to start making his own artwork, perhaps merely as a means to get rid of him and his pesky camera.  Convinced that art is nothing more than a form of brainwashing, Thierry dubs himself Mr. Brainwash.  After briefly trying his hand at pasting a signature icon around L.A., Mr. Brainwash quickly decides that what he really needs is a gala exhibition.  After recruiting an army of starving artists, Thierry refits an abandoned office building into his own personal art gallery and through the magic of delegation constructs a surprising number of exhibits in a matter of weeks.  And yet despite his relative lack of experience in the art world and his dubious artistic achievements, Mr. Brainwash's show becomes a massive success.  Lines for his show wrap around the block, and his artwork sells for thousands of dollars each.  All of this and no one at the exhibit is quite capable or articulating why Mr. Brainwash is the genius they seem to think he is.The central question of the Gift Shop is, how do we value art?  For much of the film this question is on the level of expression.  What does it mean for Banksy to place an image of human depravity, a Guantanamo inmate, in the middle of a make believe world tailor made to help its guests forget about the troubles of the outside?  But by the end of the film that question of value becomes monetary.  We see Thierry walking through his gallery naming a price for his artwork almost at random.  The value of art shifts from a question of interpretation to a question of monetary worth.It's this shift in how art is valued that has some people claiming that the film illustrates why artistic value is meaningless.  I disagree with this supposed message of the film.  Clearly from the reactions to Thierry's work by Banksy and Fairey, we are not supposed to take his artistic merit seriously.  In fact, most of Thierry's work looks like bargain bin Andy Warhol.  However, Thierry vaults over his lack of talent by bolstering his project with copious amounts of hype.  Those who visit his gallery are not questioning the artwork itself, but rather its potential cultural and monetary capital.

1378515,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003ZXNCH2,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The first question in my mind is not whether 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' is a hoax, an elaborately staged mockumentary about a French expatriate living in L.A., Thierry Guetta, an amateur filmmaker turned street artist turned Wahol-like pop artist. No, my question is whether the film's creator, 'Banksy', the so-called legendary street artist, is actually a real person. Actually I had never heard of him before this film but then again I don't live in the UK. There's an elaborate biography of him on Wikipedia but who knows whether any of that is true. I've also found articles about him dating back to 2005 but then again, who knows if those articles are fakes also? I'd be more inclined to believe this is the work of prankster Sacha Baron Cohen, famous for his Ali G, Borat and Bruno parodies. If you take a look at the Wikipedia biography, so much of it seems like one joke after another. For example, there's an illustration (supposedly by Banksy) of a naked man on the wall of a sexual health clinic. But here's the kicker--they say that the 'city council' (wherever that may be), ""allowed it to remain"". There's also a footnote that claims that the source of that information is UK/Magazine/Faces of the Week from BBC news from 15 September 2006. [...] Retrieved 12 April 2010. If all the footnotes we find in the Wikipedia article are made up, that's one hell of an elaborate hoax!!!As for Thierry Guetta himself, is he actually a Frenchman in L.A., who owned a vintage clothing store and who from an early age began videotaping every aspect of his life? I've met a guy who videotapes incessantly and has a collection of videotapes that rival what we see in 'The Gift Shop'. So I know there are people like that. It's possible that the creators here found Guetta, who in fact had a large collection of videotapes that he had shot prior to the creation of 'The Gift Shop', and he agreed to be in on the spoof. Whether at a certain point in his life, he hooked up with his cousin, the graffiti artist in the film, 'Space Invader', who introduced him to other street artists, remains to be seen. I suspect all that footage, including the supposed long association with the real graffiti artist, Shepard Fairey (responsible for the Obama 'Hope' poster) is fake.The entire way in which Thierry Guetta finally hooks up with the elusive Banksy seems like one big joke (we see Thierry racing over to meet Banksy and he comments how he just has no idea why he wasn't stopped for speeding!). The whole bit about how Banksy and Thierry plant the Guantanamo Bay Detainee doll at Disneyland and how Disney security questioned Thierry for four hours and then let him go, is so absurd that one cannot believe it actually happened. Even more absurd is the idea that suddenly Thierry channels his hidden 'street artist', stops his videotaping and becomes a street artist himself.Finally, there's the scenario of Thierry morphing into an Andy Warhol type artist and organizing his own art exhibition in Los Angeles. Did it actually happen? Again, the pranksters could have actually gone to great lengths to make the exhibition a success by arranging interviews with the local media and promoting it through street art. Or they could have made it look like it was a success through clever editing. Who knows? There's also a claim that subsequently Thierry designed an album cover for a Madonna greatest hits album. Did that actually happen or is that also part of the hoax? Or was Madonna actually taken in by Banksy pranksters? One thing I'm convinced of--Thierry did not actually create the album (if in fact it actually exists). As it was made clear during the film, the pop art was actually created by people who were hired by either Thierry or Banksy pranksters.As a mockumentary, 'Exit through the gift shop' may be compared to the iconic 'Spinal Tap'--what 'Tap' did for rock music, 'Gift' has now done for street art. The best one can say for this clever parody, is that it's fun. The worst one can say, is that it doesn't mean that much in the grand scheme of things. I'm more on the side of 'if it's clever and fun', then it's definitely worthwhile seeing.",4,"Is this a hoax, or not a hoax?
