I agree with reviewers about the US version --not good.  Trying to get the episodes in order and in the correct season requires going to the Canadian amazon and purchasing from there.  Just make sure you get the phase 4 studio DVDs not the CBS dvds.  The CBS dvds are poorer in quality and episodes are mixed up because of they way they were aired in the States.  In addition, starting with season three, my dvds froze and the transition time (where the commercials were edited out) was quite long. The Canadian versions are more expensive but are definitely worth it.  I'm sending my US versions back because of the freezing problem, some wouldn't load to play at all and my season four package was broken. Amazon is good about refunds though so that is a plus.  Can't wait to get season 5!!Also, there are no subtitles on the Canadian version but the US version has subtitles for season 3 and 4.",3,Series is great but DVDs leave much to be desired,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,991,"['love', 'show', 'was', 'sad', 'ended', 'Trying', 'get', 'DVDs', 'been', 'trying', 'experience', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'US', 'version', 'not', 'good', 'Trying', 'get', 'episodes', 'order', 'correct', 'season', 'going', 'Canadian', 'amazon', 'purchasing', 'there', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'phase', '4', 'studio', 'DVDs', 'not', 'CBS', 'dvds', 'CBS', 'dvds', 'are', 'poorer', 'quality', 'episodes', 'are', 'mixed', 'up', 'way', 'were', 'aired', 'States', 'addition', 'starting', 'season', 'three', 'dvds', 'froze', 'transition', 'time', 'where', 'commercials', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'was', 'quite', 'long', 'Canadian', 'versions', 'are', 'more', 'expensive', 'are', 'definitely', ""'m"", 'sending', 'US', 'versions', 'back', 'freezing', 'problem', 'would', ""n't"", 'load', 'play', 'season', 'four', 'package', 'was', 'broken', 'Amazon', 'good', 'refunds', 'so', 'plus', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'season', '5', 'Also', 'are', 'subtitles', 'Canadian', 'version', 'US', 'version', 'subtitles', 'season', '3', '4']",N/A

1426198,AM1C02CE4WGPC,B004QXJZYE,"W. Corse ""OldOneEye""","[2, 2]","The quality of these DVD's is excellent, both video and sound, and some nice special features are also included.  Several reviewers have mentioned that the ""seasons"" as packaged are ""incomplete"".  Is that true?  Yes and no.These DVD sets are produced by the CBS network's ""Home Video"" division, so the ""seasons"" here match CBS's broadcast schedule, not CTV's original production schedule.  Each season's box lists the episodes on the inside covers with short summaries of each story and the ""Original Air Date"" which refers to CBS's original broadcast date in the USA, not CTV's original broadcast dates in Canada.There are 62 episodes produced over the show's first four seasons:  13 each in Seasons 1 and 3, and 18 each in Seasons 2 and 4. The ""Season 1"" set actually contains all 13 episodes produced for that season, but the ""Season 2"" set only contains 9 episodes, perhaps because CBS actually broadcast the final 4 episodes from the first season at the beginning of their ""Season 2"" here.  However, the ""Season 3"" set contains the remaining 9 episodes from the actual Season 2 -- slightly out of order, but they're all there -- plus the first 7 episodes from the show's actual 3rd season, ending with ""Acceptable Risk.""  That leaves 6 episodes that should be found in their ""Season 4"" set (which I don't have yet) plus the 18 remaining episodes filmed for CTV's Season 4 (including ""A Day in the Life"", the unforgettable ""Valentine's Day"" episode that introduced Raf) , only some of which CBS broadcast before ION took over here in the U.S.  I'd appreciate having anyone who owns the ""Season 4"" CBS set might be willing to post an episode list.This is one of the best TV shows to be produced in the past 20 years:  a great cast with solid stories based on strong moral principles, and even some thinly-veiled criticisms of the Canadian government (""Jumping at Shadows"") every now and then. The fifth and final season is being filmed as I write this, slated to premier on CTV in October or November.  No word yet on when ION will get these last 13 episodes of our favorite show.",4,Seasons based on CBS Broadcast schedule,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2083,"['quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'video', 'sound', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'seasons', 'packaged', 'are', 'incomplete', 'true', 'Yes', 'no.These', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'produced', 'CBS', 'network', 'Home', 'Video', 'division', 'seasons', 'here', 'match', 'CBS', 'broadcast', 'schedule', 'not', 'CTV', 'original', 'production', 'schedule', 'season', 'box', 'episodes', 'inside', 'covers', 'short', 'summaries', 'story', 'Original', 'Air', 'Date', 'CBS', 'original', 'broadcast', 'date', 'USA', 'not', 'CTV', 'original', 'broadcast', 'dates', 'Canada.There', 'are', '62', 'episodes', 'produced', 'show', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', '13', 'Seasons', '1', '3', '18', 'Seasons', '2', '4', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'actually', '13', 'episodes', 'produced', 'season', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'only', '9', 'episodes', 'perhaps', 'CBS', 'actually', 'broadcast', 'final', '4', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'beginning', 'Season', '2', 'here', 'However', 'Season', '3', 'set', 'remaining', '9', 'episodes', 'actual', 'Season', '2', 'slightly', 'order', ""'re"", 'there', 'first', '7', 'episodes', 'show', 'actual', '3rd', 'season', 'ending', 'Acceptable', 'Risk', '6', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'found', 'Season', '4', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'yet', '18', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'filmed', 'CTV', 'Season', '4', 'including', 'Day', 'Life', 'unforgettable', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'episode', 'introduced', 'Raf', 'only', 'CBS', 'broadcast', 'ION', 'took', 'over', 'here', 'U.S', ""'d"", 'appreciate', 'having', 'anyone', 'who', 'Season', '4', 'CBS', 'set', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'post', 'episode', 'list.This', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'be', 'produced', 'past', '20', 'years', 'great', 'cast', 'solid', 'stories', 'based', 'strong', 'moral', 'principles', 'even', 'thinly-veiled', 'criticisms', 'Canadian', 'government', 'Jumping', 'Shadows', 'now', 'then', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'being', 'filmed', 'write', 'slated', 'premier', 'CTV', 'October', 'November', 'No', 'word', 'yet', 'when', 'ION', 'will', 'get', 'last', '13', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'show']",N/A
