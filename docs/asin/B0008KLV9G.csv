First, Steve McQueen went against his screen image at the time and was superb in the part. He displayed a breezy charm of which I hadn't before thought he was capable. Second, the film was presented in a classic ""feel-good"" tradition which went against the increasing cynicism of that Counter-Culture/Viet Nam war era. The visual look of ""The Reivers"" wonderfully captures our idea of the period in which it takes place. It has a Huckleberry Finn shading to it, although it takes place half a century after that book's era.

William Faulkner's book may be in more depth, but the screenplay and direction make up for it in many ways. You truly feel you are with them at the beginning of the 20th Century. This is one of Steve McQueen's finest performances. McQueen plays a relative that talks the Patriarch's grandson into ""borrowing the car"" to take a trip to Memphis. This is a far different road trip movie than those today. This will appeal to most the family because it has a warmth of spirit and adventure. The DVD is clear and sharp. I recommend this to any one that enjoys movies based on books about a way of life in another time. The music, costumes, sets, and scenery are top class.

An easy, kick-back movie to enjoy about a boy growing up in slower times in the early 1900's in the South. It touches on a wide variety of human traits, from foibles such as discrimination and deceit to good qualities like respect and forgiveness. The stable scene about quitting is a terrific lesson for all of us and especially for youngsters.

899344,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0008KLV9G,David Baldwin,"[4, 4]","I've never read William Faulkner's source novel for this film but I'm sure he would be receptive to it.  Steve McQueen is the ostensible star here as Boon, a ne'er do-well hired hand.  McQueen gives a light-hearted performance here but he also graciously acquiesces the spotlight to the rest of the film's cast.  McQueen intuitively knows that this film is essentially about the coming-of-age of an 11 year old boy, Lucius McCaslin,(Mitch Vogel) in Jim Crow South circa 1905.  The film starts out bucolic, showing the everyday goings on of a small Mississippi town where everyone knows their place under the firm but fair hand of ""Boss McCaslin(Will Geer).  While the boss is away at a family funeral, Boon hatches a plan to take a road trip with Lucius to Memphis in the boss' prize automobile.  Stowing away in the back seat is Boon's partner-in-crime, Ned(Rupert Crosse).  Boon's plan is to give Lucius the ""education"" he would not receive at home.  What Lucius does witness is prostitution, random violence, and institutional racism.  As entertaining a film this is these underpinings add a certain wistfulness to the proceedings.  It's a heavy burden for a young actor to carry but Vogel is up to the challenge.  One of the most powerful images in the film is his admission at the end of the film to his grandfather the guilt he feels for his transgressions.  Aside from the aforementioned actors, who are all superb, good work is contributed here by Sharon Farrell as a prostitute with misgivings about her profession and Clifton James as a racist lawman.

I remember this being such a grand adventure on its theatrical release, now its more of a moderately paced nostalgic curio, but good wholesome family entertainment nonetheless.Steve McQueen plays Boon Hogganbeck, an adopted stray that was taken in by the local Big Daddy played by the inimitable Will Geer known simply as ""Boss."" Boon is assigned to watch over the Boss' grandson Lucius, but Boon has been around the block a few times, and his testosterone goes into warp drive when the Boss has a spanking new Winton Flyer delivered on the inbound train.While Boon is ardently watching over his new toy, another ""family"" member Ned who just happens to be a descendant of slaves AND Boss McCanlis' own grandaddy, takes off in the Winton Flyer causing general mayhem and destruction all over town before accidentally bringing this new horseless wagon to a stop. as punishment, Boss and the family leave town for a funeral, and consign 11 year old Lucius to the care of Boon, who has the Memphis city limits on his mind. Once safely out of town, Boon and Lucius concoct a story that is told to all the local family members assuring their safe gettaway, then off they go only to find later that lunatic Ned has stowed away in the back seat, setting the stage for a raucous adventure that had been largely forgotten over the past 30 years.A terrific supporting cast with Michael Constantine as the owner of uh ""The House"", and Sharon Farrell as the...er object of Boon's affection. This movie is a delight for the family, and any serious DVD collector as the original brilliance of the sets and Mississippi Delta scenery has been fully restored with this beautiful widescreen transfer, and the 5.1 audio remastering is much better than the original release.

Steve McQueen is on the DVD cover with an old time car. That was all I knew.THE REIVERS is a change of pace for super star Steve McQueen who was at the height of his career when he filmed the REIVERS. He stars as Boon Hoggenbeck, a farm hand in Mississippi who takes a shining to his boss's new fangled car in the early 1900's. The boss just happens to be called BOSS an irascible old soul played by Will Geer. While BOSS is away Boon decides to take the car and his two cousins to the wild town of Memphis. His cousin Lucius is a well-behaved and innocent 11 year old and they are joined by their African-American cousin. (There is a great-grandparent in common.  They leave the peaceful innocence of their small town for a taste of the real world.Boon's destination is a ""house of ill-repute"" where his special lady works. The story has a very odd combination of people and situations yet there is an endearing charm to this story that is part drama and part slapstick as our trio gets into various trouble.Mitch Vogel was a child actor of the late 60's and 70's that led to a stint on TV's BONANZA. It is amazing to see what a wonderful actor he was. His ability to cry and show emotion and he totally steals the movie. I've read that Steve McQueen was insecure and needed to be the ""star"" but yet he lets Vogel shine in this film that turns out to be a heartwarming coming of age story of a young boy's first experience with the outside world. There are several beautiful scenes of Vogel interacting with Boon's girl and with kindly, elderly African-American Uncle Possum. These are real people interacting with genuine affection and respect. All color and social barriers are lifted for a while. Unfortunately, not everyone is squeaky clean and we glimpses of the ugly side of racism.Lucius learns about the real world and becomes a man at an early age. He tells his first lies yet he is keenly aware of his mistakes and his heart is never hardened. There is an absolutely beautiful and moving scene between Boss and Lucius that has to be one of the most lovely and heartwarming interaction between an adult and child I have ever seen on screen.This is the firt film where I have seen Steve McQueen actually sing--not lip singing as in BABY THE RAIN MUST FALL. Singing is not one of his talents, but McQueen throws his heart into it and its all pure joy. It seems like McQueen is actually loving every minute of this film.

The time is 1905, and 11-year old Lucius (Mitch Vogel) lives with his rich grandfather in a sleepy Mississippi town.  His wild and no-account pals, Boon (Steve McQueen) and Ned (Rupert Crosse), talk him into a wild adventure involving his grandfather's shiny, new automobile, some shady ladies, and a horse race.As a Steve McQueen fan, I expected to love this movie, but, although he's charming as always, he seems more of a secondary character here.  The story focuses on Mitch Vogel's character and he's a good, but not great child actor; his eyes are expressive and thoughtful, but he sounds like he's reading his lines. Will Geer (who plays the grandfather) and Sharon Farrell have the best scenes.  The story was clearly meant to be a rollicking good time but it didn't make me smile.  It's big on nostalgia and family values but this is definitely not a child-friendly movie.I liked the period recreation, sets, and costumes, but the story just missed the mark for me; it didn't hold my interest with McQueen playing a rather helpless fool.

William Faulkner wasn't known for his lightness of heart, but this precious memoir shows love, spirit and excitement that sets this film aside. I won't blab away the plot, but Steve McQueen, at the height of his career, is having a ball in a fine performance. Sharon Farrell is so lovely; where did her career go? Mitch Vogel, as young Lucius, gives one of the best kid performances ever; I hate bad kid-actors. Where did his career go? And the most auspicious debut performance came from Oscar-nominated Rupert Crosse, knowing everything, wanting to be included, causing the most trouble, and, ultimately, saving the day. Best in the film! And where did his career go? There's also the great Juano Hernandez, and a really great performance by a horse. And it's always good to see Ruth White, the most reliable character actress since Jane Darwell. Non-obtrusive narration by Burgess Meredith is a plus. The odds seem insurmountable, but they all emerge victorious and young Lucius has life-affirming experiences; shocking, painful and ultimately exciting. And memorable.

Director Mark Rydell's, (On Golden Pond), 106 minute classic comedy/ drama, which was nominated for two Oscars, is set in turn of the twentieth century rural Mississippi. It is based on a novel by William Faulkner, Nobel-Prize-winning twentieth century Southern American writer and screenwriter, who also had a hand in writing the screenplay.  In this charming coming of age film, an old man, voiced by Burgess Meredith, narrates a tale of his youth.As a naive 11 year old, Lucius McCaslin (Mitch Vogel) had an unlikely friend in Boone Hoggenbeck, (Steve McQueen), his family's ne'er-do-well handyman, and confirmed philanderer. Boone, and his mixed-race best friend, Ned McCaslin, (Rupert Crosse, in his final theatrical film), who is cousin to Lucius, drag Lucius along as they take advantage of the brief absence from town of Lucius's grandfather, known as Boss to one and all, who is traveling to a family funeral by train.  They `borrow' the snazzy new car Boss (played by Will Geer, enjoying the role of his life) had just bought, and head for the neighboring big city of Memphis, Tennessee, where Lucius enjoys all sorts of adventures and gets a head start on growing up.McQueen, a great star of the 1960s and `70s, who left us much too soon, was, for certain, always the essence of cool.  He was also a very skilled driver, whom people loved to watch as he did his thing, without stuntmen, seeBullitt,The Great Escape,Le Mans.  He does some driving here too, of course, but only in the brand-new, bright yellow, 18-horsepower Winton Flyer.  According to the Internet Movie Database, ""The Winton Flyer was not a real automobile. It was created from scratch for this movie by Kenneth Howard, aka Von Dutch. The car was designed to resemble a typical vehicle from 1904, but built to withstand the rigors of filming. Steve McQueen called the car `the real star of the picture', and took possession of it after filming ended. It remained in his collection until his death in 1980. It can be seen in the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.""Among the supporting players, Ruth White, who also died shortly after making the film, turns in strong work as Miss Reba, a brothel madam, as does Michael Constantine as Mr. Binford, its owner. Further according to IMDb, ""On the packaging for the 1993 VHS release of the movie, the music credit is given to Lalo Schifrin. John Williams wrote the score for the film and received an Oscar nomination for his efforts.""Oh yes, and that title, ""The Reivers.""Apparently an old-fashioned local word for thieves.  Mind you, before recently seeing this movie again, I'd not seen it for many years, possibly since its theatrical release.  But I remember very clearly going to see it with my father - my mother believed that it wouldn't be politically correct enough for her.  A funny point of view in that one of the points the picture makes is the bullying and exploitation of the weak by the powerful.  But my father, a man of great charm and charisma himself, who had a secret sentimental streak a mile wide, which I'm afraid I inherited from him, was in tears at several points of the picture.

899362,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B0008KLV9G,T O'Brien,"[0, 0]","Based on a William Faulkner novel, The Reivers is a big departure from the typical Steve McQueen movie and maybe that's why it's not hugely well-known, but don't let that scare you away from a good old-fashioned movie.  In 1905 in Jefferson, Missouri, 11-year old Lucius McCaslin is starting to grow up and see the world differently.  When a distant relative of the family dies, Lucius' parents travel to go to the funeral leaving their son behind.  Joining up with his friend Boon, a family friend who works as the family handyman, and Ned, a black man who has blood relations to the family, Lucius and Co. ""borrow"" his dad's new car and take it up the road to visit Memphis.  Along the way, young Lucius begins to see things even more differently as he's exposed to new things, thanks in great part to the sticky situations Boon and Ned get him into.  The plot drifts along through the movie, taking its time and introducing characters along the way.  It's a good movie, pure and simple, and there's a good message at the end of it.  Not your typical McQueen movie by a long shot, but that doesn't mean it's not a very good movie.In a part different from just about any other role he played, Steve McQueen plays Boon Hogganbeck, a family handyman who just enjoys living and doing what he likes to do.  McQueen didn't do many comedic roles, and this isn't straight comedy, but he's good here in a physical role that brings more than a few shares of laughs.  Mitch Vogel plays Lucius, the 11-year old friend of Boon's who truly begins to grow up on the little road trip and finding out who he really is.  It's a very good part for Vogel who disappointingly didn't go on to bigger and better roles.  Rupert Crosse is very good as well as Ned, a black man working for the McCaslin family who can trace his family bloodlines back to Lucius' grandfather.  Boon and Ned grew up together which gives McQueen and Crosse plenty of humorous moments throughout.  Sharon Farrell stars as Miss Corie, Boon's longtime love working at a local whorehouse.  Lucius takes an instant liking to her, almost like a big sister, and starts getting her thinking about changing her life around.  The excellent supporting cast includes lots of small cameos including Will Geer, Ruth White, Michael Constantine, Dub Taylor, Clifton James, and Juano Hernandez.  The four main leads all give good performances, but the supporting cast helps make the movie even stronger overall, including Burgess Meredith as Lucius as an adult, narrating the story and looking back on the adventure.The DVD is pretty slim in the special features department, as in none, so don't expect even a trailer or still gallery.  Fortunately, the widescreen transfer is a good one which is how this movie deserves to be seen. So don't be scared that this isn't a well-known Steve McQueen movie if you're curious as to watch it or not.  Don't expect the loner role that McQueen perfected, it is definitely a change of pace for the actor, but that's what makes it worthwhile.
