Clendenin,"[4, 4]","Pick up most any hit record beginning in the late 1940s, especially any recording done with Atlantic Records, and you will likely see that one Tom Dowd was the producer or recording engineer. In this loving tribute to Dowd, who died October 27, 2002 before the film was finished, those inside the guild honor the memory of one whom they universally acknowledge was a legendary genius and wonderful human being. In his younger years Dowd was a physics student at Columbia, and even worked on the atom bomb project (he was present at the Bikini Atoll tests), but his mother was an opera singer and perhaps he was destined for music. Dowd was a master technical innovator, musical aesthete, coach, father figure, and psychologist. He himself narrates most of the film, but we are also treated to original concert footage (Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, etc.) and retrospective interviews with a number of the stars whose sounds he perfected, including Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, and Greg Allman. The five minutes or so when Dowd sits at a console and walks us through the thirty-year-old master copy of ""Layla,"" starting with only the guitars and then adding the various parts until they pulse with that incredibly evocative sound that defined an era, interspersed with poignant reflections by Clapton, are worth the entire film. One disappoint in this otherwise fascinating glimpse of the history of music recording since the late 1940s is that we learn nothing at all personal about Dowd, and nothing at all about any weaknesses, failures, misjudgments, and the like, that would have made this entirely likable person even more richly human.",5,music maker's magic,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1640,"['Pick', 'up', 'most', 'hit', 'record', 'beginning', 'late', '1940s', 'especially', 'recording', 'done', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'will', 'likely', 'see', 'one', 'Tom', 'Dowd', 'was', 'producer', 'recording', 'engineer', 'loving', 'tribute', 'Dowd', 'who', 'died', 'October', '27', '2002', 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'guild', 'honor', 'memory', 'one', 'whom', 'universally', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'legendary', 'genius', 'wonderful', 'human', 'being', 'younger', 'years', 'Dowd', 'was', 'physics', 'student', 'Columbia', 'even', 'worked', 'atom', 'bomb', 'project', 'was', 'present', 'Bikini', 'Atoll', 'tests', 'mother', 'was', 'opera', 'singer', 'perhaps', 'was', 'destined', 'music', 'Dowd', 'was', 'master', 'technical', 'innovator', 'musical', 'aesthete', 'coach', 'father', 'figure', 'psychologist', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'original', 'concert', 'footage', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'etc', 'retrospective', 'interviews', 'number', 'stars', 'perfected', 'including', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Greg', 'Allman', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'Dowd', 'console', 'walks', 'thirty-year-old', 'master', 'copy', 'Layla', 'starting', 'only', 'guitars', 'then', 'adding', 'various', 'parts', 'pulse', 'incredibly', 'evocative', 'sound', 'defined', 'era', 'interspersed', 'poignant', 'reflections', 'Clapton', 'are', 'entire', 'film', 'One', 'disappoint', 'otherwise', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'history', 'music', 'recording', 'late', '1940s', 'learn', 'nothing', 'personal', 'Dowd', 'nothing', 'weaknesses', 'failures', 'misjudgments', 'like', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'entirely', 'likable', 'person', 'even', 'more', 'richly', 'human']",N/A
790809,A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00011ZBOS,hyperbolium,"[3, 7]","Tom Dowd (1925-2002) was best known to top-flight jazz, soul and rock musicians, and detail-oriented music fans who read through all of an album's liner notes. Dowd's credits as engineer or producer can be found on back covers and in CD booklets of seminal recordings by Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, Joe Turner, LaVern Baker, The Clovers, The Drifters, The Coasters, Bobby Darin, John Coltrane, MJQ, Ornette Coleman, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Machito, Roland Kirk, George Shearing, Charlie Mingus, Cream, Eric Clapton, Buffalo Springfield, Sonny & Cher, The Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd, to name just a very few.Dowd was one of the critical elements behind Atlantic's ascendancy in the `50s and `60s, and helped Stax find their audio groove. He was both an engineer and a producer, but more importantly he was a studio catalyst whose musical sensibility and golden ears led musicians to their best work, which he then captured on tape. Fellow producer Phil Ramone calls Dowd a ""coach,"" and his multiple roles as engineer, producer and musical confidant are echoed by the likes of Eric Clapton and Lynyrd Skynyrd's Billy Powell. It was Dowd who suggested the unusual downbeat that marks Cream's ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" it was Dowd who captured the energy of the Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East, and it was Dowd who first captured on tape everything Otis Redding had to offer, resulting in the seminal albumOtis Blue.Dowd's career spanned the early days of direct-to-disc recording, in which the balance of musicians was engineered live, through mono and half-track stereo (the latter of which Dowd was one of the first to use for LP production), through overdubbing on multi-track tape, to the unlimited tracks, automation and editing possibilities of today's digital studios. His biggest step forward was the introduction of an eight-track recorder at Atlantic, which revolutionized the way pop music was recorded, and in turn the music itself. The ability to record first and mix later freed engineers to focus on sound capture, and the ability to lay down individual tracks at different times divorced recording from the aesthetic of a live band.This documentary is filled with the music of Dowd's productions and features interviews with Dowd, Ahmet Ertegun, Jerry Wexler, Ray Charles, Mike Stoller, Phil Ramone, Eric Clapton, members of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd, and others. There's superb archival photos and film footage, including snippets of Dowd working in the studio and control room and performance footage of Booker T & The MGs, Otis Redding and more. There's a wonderful shot of the Baldwin piano on which Jim Gordon played ""Layla,"" and a recitation of the instrument's other guests, including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Gregg Allman, Billy Powell, and Dr. John.There's a lot of great material here, but like the sequence in which Dowd fiddles with the individual tracks of ""Layla,"" the film doesn't gel into a coherent statement. The staged studio recreations feel like a cheat, and the super congenial tone, though apparently representative of Dowd's temperament, turns this into more of a tribute than a documentary This film is worth seeing for the archival footage and newly struck interviews, but while it provides context for Dowd's  work, it's not nearly as moving as his actual music. DVD extras include three deleted scenes, additional interview clips, a photo gallery and a ""making of"" showing the set-up for filming the recording studio recreations. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

However, Dowd's impact on the industry affected millions of fans of Eric Clapton, The Allman Brothers, John Coltrane, Aretha Franklin, Tito Puente, Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Ornette Coleman, Thelonious Monk, and Phil Ramone. All of those artists appear in this documentary.Dowd also recorded a host of others, from perky Eileen Barton's hit If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake, for National Records in 1950, to Charlie Mingus, to assisting Abba in 1979, to Meat Loaf [!!] in 1983, to the Bee Gees in 1990, to the Allman Brothers Band. The discography on the documentary's website, [...] is 99 screens long, in other words, huge.In February 2002, Dowd received a Grammy for his services to the recording industry. Eric Clapton said that Dowd had encouraged him to realize ""what my skills were.""Dowd built the first control console to use sliders (linear faders) instead of knobs. He popularized to eight-track recorder invented by Les Paul.This documentary was supposed to fix the problem of Dowd's relative obscurity.However, the director and editor, who had never directed or edited a feature-length documentary before, may not have been experienced enough to bring such a complex and wonderful story to the screen. The time and place seem to shift out from under the viewer, as the film moves from archive footage, to re-creations, to contemporary interviews. Despite his seven years dedication to the project, Mark Moorman has put together a pleasant 90 minutes that do not, unfortunately, do justice to the subject.An article in the Miami Herald, published just before this documentary was due to be shown at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival said the film ""was supposed to be finished last week and at festival headquarters in Park City, Utah. But Moormann [sic] is still scrambling to complete the final mixing, putting in 16-hour days at Cineworks, a Miami production facility.""""That's part of making movies,"" he says of the last-minute rush. ""We've got to have it done by Wednesday.""Moorman had worked hard on the film for seven years. He had paid for a lot of it himself, shuttling back and forth between the film and his regular gig as a cinematographer. The State of Florida gave him a puny $5,000 grant, and that was it.Early in the process, Dowd handed Moorman a manuscript. It was Dowd's autobiography. In an interview with hybridmagazine.com, shortly after the documentary was shown at South by Southwest, Moorman said, ""I was just amazed that one person could have been a participant in the making of so much history.""Maybe Moorman bit off more than he could chew. He told the interviewer for hybridmagazine.com, ""I'd go on the Internet or go to the library and get books and I'd find out who Ahmet Ertegun was, and where he came from. And I did a lot of research on each individual person before I went to interview them.""Asked by Roxanne Bogucka of hybridmagazine.com about the use of re-creations, a dubious documentary technique which fell out of favor after it was used in the ""March of Time"" documentaries during World War II, Moorman explained, ""That was about keeping the audience involved, you know. I mean the content could potentially be rather dry in nature - technical stuff like, you know, knobs and two-track, four-track.""""I mean it all seemed to be a little bit boring. It could potentially be boring, so I was like, well, 'let's spice this up and let's get these guys in town,' these jazz guys, and I used their music. It sounded like it could have been 1940s, but it was modern and cool. So I got the guys who did it and brought them in the studio, we shot it black-and-white, and had an art director come in and make the studio kind of look like 1948. And it was just about keeping the audience interested.""One key to what is missing in this documentary comes up in the hybridmagazine.com interview. Asked about Dowd's directorial genius, Moorman replies, ""I didn't really have conversations with him about directing, but it is certainly something that has been brought up before, in that directors actually could get a really, in terms of what they could watch this film and really get some good feedback on how to direct, because Tom wasn't so much forcing his style on other people, he was getting the most out of the musicians and the artists he was working with.""Those conversations never had, might have been quite an addition to the film.Everyone who worked on this documentary had the very best of intentions. Dowd's wonderful disposition -- he is always smiling -- comes through. It is a Valentine of a film to Dowd, for Dowd, about Dowd.It is not a bad documentary. It is well worth watching. The music is GREAT! Just be prepared, after it's over, to want more, a lot more.",3,Bringing Fame to an Obscure Industry Legend,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,5212,"['When', 'Tom', 'Dowd', 'died', '2002', 'adopted',

790816,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00011ZBOS,Robert Moore,"[15, 15]","I grew up seeing the name ""Tom Dowd"" on a host of the albums I owned, from Led Zeppelin to Otis Redding to Aretha Franklin to Cream to the Allman Brothers to Derek and the Dominoes.  Precisely who he was and what role he played wasn't clear to me, but I learned that odds were any release from Atlantic Records was going to have his name on it.  This splendid documentary puts a face to the name and explains precisely who he was and what he accomplished.  The list of people he worked with is even more impressive than I had already known, and extends to the Coasters, the Drifters, John Coltrane, Ray Charles (who makes a prominent appearance in the film), Tito Puente, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Rod Stewart, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Booker T. & the MGs.  That, of course, is an absolutely stunning array of talent.What the documentary does a great job of is telling us both who Tom Dowd is and why he was such a crucial figure in the history of popular music in the past.  The narrative is nonlinear, so that in the opening images in the film it isn't at all clear why the atomic test at the Bikini Atoll was shown (you could tell it was the Bikini test because a vast number of ships, from both the allies and the Axis powers, were involved).  We learn later in the movie that Dowd was originally studying to be a physicist at Columbia University and was throughout WW II involved in the Manhattan Project, unlike many on the project actually working in Manhattan.  Dowd explains that he abandoned the study of physics because he had been working on cutting edge issues in the field, but after the war physics departments were actually behind the times.  Instead of regressing in his studies, he followed his other great love, music.  The film tells how he became involved as a sound engineer, eventually becoming the sound engineer and a producer at the fledgling Atlantic Records, where he pioneered recording techniques that went behind the single microphone set up that had been standard before then.  A nod is paid towards recording pioneer and virtuoso guitarist Les Paul, who in his own studio created the first eight track recording techniques.  Among the other innovations that Dowd brought about were the replacement of knobs with the slide wires that are now standard.  Throughout two things are clear:  Dowd's technical mastery and his tremendous musicianship.One of the joys of the documentary are the remarkable figures that are interviewed and help in telling the story.  These include people like Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler, Eric Clapton, several members of the Allman Brothers, and many others.  My favorite moment was defintely when Ray Charles, who of course was blind, was being asked about Dowd, unaware that Dowd was standing off to the side.  When he reveals to Charles that he is there Ray reacts with joyous outrage and it is great to see the affection the two have for each other.My only beef with the movie is a personal peeve I have, and that is the tendency of the filmmakers to do ""reenactments"" of scenes from the past.  This is a technique I consistently detest in documentaries.  Others might not be bothered by it, but it bugs the heck out of me and I cringed whenever that happened.I think fans of music ought to see this not merely to learn more about one of the seminal figures in popular music of the past several decades, but to learn more about how the music we hear on albums is actually created.  Often, the musicians need producers to help at crucial moments.  A great example of this comes when Dowd recounts doing a recording session with Cream.  They had a song that wasn't quite coming together, when Dowd suggested to drummer Ginger Baker that he employ a drum pattern that was much like the tom toms one hears used by Indians in Westerns.  The pattern worked and the result was one of Cream's greatest hits, ""Sunshine of Your Love.""  Sadly, Dowd did not live to see this film released, dying in 2002 shortly after filming was completed.  The film serves, therefore, as a memorial.",5,A great documentary that puts a face to a familiar name,1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,4100,"['grew', 'up', 'seeing', 'name', 'Tom', 'Dowd', 'host', 'albums', 'owned', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'Cream', 'Allman', 'Brothers', 'Derek', 'Dominoes', 'Precisely', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'role', 'played', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'learned', 'odds', 'were', 'release', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'name', 'splendid', 'documentary', 'face', 'name', 'precisely', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'accomplished', 'list', 'people', 'worked', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'had', 'already', 'known', 'Coasters', 'Drifters', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'who', 'prominent', 'appearance', 'film', 'Tito', 'Puente', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'Charles', 'Mingus', 'Thelonious', 'Monk', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Lynyrd', 'Skynyrd', 'Booker', 'T.', 'MGs', 'course', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'array', 'talent.What', 'documentary', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'who', 'Tom', 'Dowd', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'crucial', 'figure', 'history', 'popular', 'music', 'past', 'narrative', 'nonlinear', 'opening', 'images', 'film', ""n't"", 'clear', 'why', 'atomic', 'test', 'Bikini', 'Atoll', 'was', 'shown', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'Bikini', 'test', 'vast', 'number', 'ships', 'allies', 'Axis', 'powers', 'were', 'involved', 'learn', 'later', 'movie', 'Dowd', 'was', 'originally', 'studying', 'be', 'physicist', 'Columbia', 'University', 'was', 'WW', 'II', 'involved', 'Manhattan', 'Project', 'many', 'project', 'actually', 'working', 'Manhattan', 'Dowd', 'abandoned', 'study', 'physics', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'cutting', 'edge', 'issues', 'field', 'war', 'physics', 'departments', 'were', 'actually', 'times', 'Instead', 'regressing', 'studies', 'followed', 'other', 'great', 'love', 'music', 'film', 'how', 'became', 'involved', 'sound', 'engineer', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'sound', 'engineer', 'producer', 'fledgling', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'where', 'pioneered', 'recording', 'techniques', 'went', 'single', 'microphone', 'set', 'up', 'had', 'been', 'standard', 'then', 'nod', 'paid', 'towards', 'recording', 'pioneer', 'virtuoso', 'guitarist', 'Les', 'Paul', 'who', 'own', 'studio', 'created', 'first', 'eight', 'track', 'recording', 'techniques', 'other', 'innovations', 'Dowd', 'brought', 'about', 'were', 'replacement', 'knobs', 'slide', 'are', 'now', 'standard', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'clear', 'Dowd', 'technical', 'mastery', 'tremendous', 'musicianship.One', 'joys', 'documentary', 'are', 'remarkable', 'figures', 'are', 'interviewed', 'help', 'telling', 'story', 'include', 'people', 'Ahmet', 'Ertegun', 'founder', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'Atlantic', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Wexler', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'several', 'members', 'Allman', 'Brothers', 'many', 'others', 'favorite', 'moment', 'was', 'defintely', 'when', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'who', 'course', 'was', 'blind', 'was', 'being', 'asked', 'Dowd', 'unaware', 'Dowd', 'was', 'standing', 'off', 'side', 'When', 'Charles', 'there', 'Ray', 'joyous', 'outrage', 'great', 'see', 'affection', 'two', 'have', 'other.My', 'only', 'beef', 'movie', 'personal', 'peeve', 'have', 'tendency', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'reenactments', 'scenes', 'past', 'technique', 'consistently', 'detest', 'documentaries', 'Others', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'heck', 'cringed', 'whenever', 'happened.I', 'think', 'fans', 'music', 'ought', 'see', 'not', 'merely', 'learn', 'more', 'one', 'seminal', 'figures', 'popular', 'music', 'past', 'several', 'decades', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'music', 'hear', 'albums', 'actually', 'created', 'Often', 'musicians', 'need', 'producers', 'help', 'crucial', 'moments', 'great', 'example', 'when', 'Dowd', 'doing', 'recording', 'session', 'Cream', 'had', 'song', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'coming', 'together', 'when', 'Dowd', 'suggested', 'drummer', 'Ginger', 'Baker', 'drum', 'pattern', 'was', 'much', 'tom', 'one', 'hears', 'used', 'Indians', 'Westerns', 'pattern', 'worked', 'result', 'was', 'one', 'Cream', 'greatest', 'hits', 'Sunshine', 'Your', 'Love', 'Sadly', 'Dowd', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'film', 'released', 'dying', '2002', 'shortly', 'filming', 'was', 'completed', 'film', 'serves', 'therefore', 'memorial']",N/A
