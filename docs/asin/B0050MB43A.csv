1435287,A1WQ0CN47LVKLF,B0050MB43A,BillEvansFan,"[53, 57]","I have only had time to watch two of the movies, Holiday Affair, and It Happened on Fifth Avenue, but they were both very entertaining.  In Holiday Affair a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum, fresh out of the service, loses his job to protect a young, beautiful war widow from getting in trouble and losing hers.  Janet Leigh is a struggling single mom working as a secret comparison shopper who buys a very expensive Lionel train for her store, takes it home where it is seen by her small son, and returns it the next day.  Obviously the son thinks the train is for him, Mitchum keeps popping up in the mom's life, meets the son, finds out that the boy is expecting the train for Christmas, and buys it for him even though he is out of work and has little money.  The rest is a Christmas romance with obvious outcomes.  Cornell Wilde makes a nice appearance as Leigh's nice, but rather boring boyfriend.  The film is a little dated now, but still a wonderful Christmas romance and seeing a young Robert Mitchum again is a treat.It Happened on Fifth Avenue is a screwball comedy with a charming hobo who lives the winter in closed mansions while the owners have gone south.  He meets a war veteran, Don DeFore (the neighbor on Ozzie and Harriet in the 50's) and takes him in without explaining that the house is not his.  Eventually Gale Storm, the owner's real daughter, shows up and she hides her identity, joining the little group.  Others get involved as the little party grows, and then the real owner, Charlie Ruggles, shows up.  He, too, hides his true identity at his daughter's insistence, and the fun increases.  I had never seen this movie somehow, and found it delightful.  I will watch it every Christmas from now on, and maybe a few times in between.  A real treat.  Very warm, family film.If the other two movies are even a little bit entertaining, this will be a five start package!",4,Great bargain for holiday film nostalgia,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1903,"['have', 'only', 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'two', 'movies', 'Holiday', 'Affair', 'Happened', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'were', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Holiday', 'Affair', 'very', 'young', 'handsome', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'fresh', 'service', 'job', 'protect', 'young', 'beautiful', 'war', 'widow', 'getting', 'trouble', 'losing', 'hers', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'struggling', 'single', 'mom', 'working', 'secret', 'comparison', 'shopper', 'who', 'very', 'expensive', 'Lionel', 'train', 'store', 'home', 'where', 'seen', 'small', 'son', 'next', 'day', 'Obviously', 'son', 'train', 'Mitchum', 'popping', 'up', 'mom', 'life', 'son', 'out', 'boy', 'expecting', 'train', 'Christmas', 'even', 'work', 'little', 'money', 'rest', 'Christmas', 'romance', 'obvious', 'outcomes', 'Cornell', 'Wilde', 'nice', 'appearance', 'Leigh', 'nice', 'rather', 'boring', 'boyfriend', 'film', 'little', 'dated', 'now', 'still', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'romance', 'seeing', 'young', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'again', 'treat.It', 'Happened', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'charming', 'hobo', 'who', 'winter', 'closed', 'mansions', 'owners', 'have', 'gone', 'south', 'war', 'veteran', 'Don', 'DeFore', 'neighbor', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', '50', 'explaining', 'house', 'not', 'Eventually', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'owner', 'real', 'daughter', 'up', 'identity', 'joining', 'little', 'group', 'Others', 'get', 'involved', 'little', 'party', 'grows', 'then', 'real', 'owner', 'Charlie', 'Ruggles', 'up', 'too', 'true', 'identity', 'daughter', 'insistence', 'fun', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'somehow', 'found', 'delightful', 'will', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'now', 'maybe', 'few', 'times', 'real', 'treat', 'Very', 'warm', 'family', 'film.If', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'entertaining', 'will', 'be', 'five', 'start', 'package']",4 Film Favorites: Classic Holiday Volume 2 (All Mine to Give / Blossoms in the Dust / Holiday Affair / It Happened on 5th Avenue)

This Xmas season (2013), she made a point of learning when it would be broadcast and caught it again.This Fall, I stumbled upon an airing of ""Holiday Affair"" on TCM. I had never even heard of this movie - loved it, especially the work of Gordon Gebert, who plays Timmy. It's a slice-of-life comedy with a realistic bent. Janet Leigh is stunning and Robert Mitchum makes a successful stretch playing a very sympathetic character. Wendell Corey plays the odd man out, and there's even an appearance by Henry Morgan as a police desk officer who has to decide whether or not to hold Mitchum's character in the slammer on Xmas Day (it has something to do with an orphan squirrel and a neck tie...) This is a real winner of a film - realistic without feeling the need to go overboard in any direction to make its honest effects felt.Anyway, I decided to look for DVDs of both movies to add to our Xmas collection, so I was floored when I found both films included in this 4-DVD set, and at a very attractive price (under $10).

1435309,A38HH2OJ5T4JZO,B0050MB43A,mixed-berry,"[1, 4]","Well this is just another attempt by Warner Bros to force folks into buying movies they don't want. I purchased this collection just for Holiday Affair as the original dvd is now outrageously priced. Warner owns all the old RKO and MGM libraries so I was stuck. I love Holiday Affair, a film that should be a Christmas classic but never will. It was the first film I ever saw that starred Ribert Mitchum and I spent the next year watching almost his entire filmography because of it. Disappointed there's no trailer, it seems to have gone missing. But the quality of the audio/video on this release is very good. My biggest complaint is that the other 3 films are not holiday fare, simply films that happen to have Christmas occur in the timeline of the plot. The worst offender is All Mine To Give, the saga of a Scottish family emigrating to the western United States and all the drama that ensues when you have a gaggle of kids. Depressing, drawn out, unremarkeable. It Happened on 5th Avenue sounds Christmas-y enough but is really about greed and the problems of post-war soldiers in a prosperous America. I really enjoy Don Defore as a character actor but had he not been in this film I doubt I could have lasted 10 minutes with it. I almost fell asleep during what is supposed to be a wacky comedy. Oh but it's not. Now, Blossoms in The Dust is quite a good film. Definitely underrated as I had never heard of it. However, when a film opens with patriotic music over the creadits it's not a Christmas film. Greer Garson gives a striking performance as a woman who devotes her entire life to orphans and adoption reform. A very touching ending as well. But again, how is this a Christmas flick or one that I would watch during the holidays??? Basically Warner Bros is trying to package films together so a fan of one is forced to buy the others. A great idea is for Warner Bros to create packages of films that are lesser known, underrated gems, and market them that way. Not under the guise of holiday viewing. Five stars all the way for Holiday Affair, Four stars for Blossoms in the Dust, and 1 star for the package Warner Bros is forcing us to buy.",3,Not a holiday collection,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,2158,"['Well', 'just', 'attempt', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'force', 'folks', 'buying', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'purchased', 'collection', 'just', 'Holiday', 'Affair', 'original', 'dvd', 'now', 'outrageously', 'priced', 'Warner', 'old', 'RKO', 'MGM', 'libraries', 'so', 'was', 'stuck', 'love', 'Holiday', 'Affair', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'never', 'will', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'starred', 'Ribert', 'Mitchum', 'spent', 'next', 'year', 'watching', 'almost', 'entire', 'filmography', 'Disappointed', 'trailer', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'quality', 'audio/video', 'release', 'very', 'good', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'other', '3', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'holiday', 'fare', 'simply', 'films', 'happen', 'have', 'Christmas', 'timeline', 'plot', 'worst', 'offender', 'Mine', 'Give', 'saga', 'Scottish', 'family', 'emigrating', 'western', 'United', 'States', 'drama', 'when', 'have', 'gaggle', 'kids', 'Depressing', 'drawn', 'out', 'unremarkeable', 'Happened', '5th', 'Avenue', 'Christmas-y', 'enough', 'really', 'greed', 'problems', 'post-war', 'soldiers', 'prosperous', 'America', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Don', 'Defore', 'character', 'actor', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'film', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', '10', 'minutes', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'Oh', 'not', 'Now', 'Blossoms', 'Dust', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'Definitely', 'underrated', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'However', 'when', 'film', 'patriotic', 'music', 'creadits', 'not', 'Christmas', 'film', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'striking', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'entire', 'life', 'orphans', 'adoption', 'reform', 'very', 'touching', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'how', 'Christmas', 'flick', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'holidays', 'Basically', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'trying', 'package', 'films', 'together', 'fan', 'one', 'forced', 'buy', 'others', 'great', 'idea', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'create', 'packages', 'films', 'are', 'lesser', 'known', 'underrated', 'gems', 'market', 'way', 'Not', 'guise', 'holiday', 'viewing', 'Five', 'stars', 'way', 'Holiday', 'Affair', 'Four', 'stars', 'Blossoms', 'Dust', '1', 'star', 'package', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'forcing', 'buy']",4 Film Favorites: Classic Holiday Volume 2 (All Mine to Give / Blossoms in the Dust / Holiday Affair / It Happened on 5th Avenue)
