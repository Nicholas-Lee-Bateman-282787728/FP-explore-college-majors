The star of the football team rapes a student and the student is made to be the villain. Tiffani Amber-Thiessen, all grown-up from ""Save By the Bell"" plays a student trying to elevate her popularity by hanging out with the ""cool"" crowd only to be an outcast becasue she refused to allow her attacker get away with a crime. Her girlfriends are unsupportive of her because they are too caught up in this ""hunk"" who is nothing more than a senseless jerk.The principal, a female and mature woman, seems to turn a blind eye to this. She is part of the problem as to why our education system is failing. The lack of academics and student conduct and too much emphasis on the school winning a team doesn't make an upstanding school. She at first isn't willing to take drastic action until a lawyer comes in and lets her know what the law is and says. That is when she starts to panic and gathers her senses.This is a movie not only for the audience to watch, but a tool for educators who think they can sweep up problems like this under the rug.",5,Sad Story of High School Sports,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,1126,"['High', 'school', 'sports', 'be', 'small', 'town', 'urban', 'area', 'take', 'front', 'seat', 'academics', 'star', 'football', 'team', 'student', 'student', 'made', 'be', 'villain', 'Tiffani', 'Amber-Thiessen', 'grown-up', 'Save', 'Bell', 'student', 'trying', 'elevate', 'popularity', 'hanging', 'out', 'cool', 'only', 'be', 'outcast', 'becasue', 'refused', 'allow', 'attacker', 'get', 'away', 'crime', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'unsupportive', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'hunk', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'senseless', 'jerk.The', 'principal', 'female', 'mature', 'woman', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'part', 'problem', 'why', 'education', 'system', 'failing', 'lack', 'academics', 'student', 'conduct', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'school', 'winning', 'team', ""n't"", 'make', 'upstanding', 'school', 'first', ""n't"", 'willing', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'lawyer', 'know', 'what', 'law', 'when', 'panic', 'gathers', 'senses.This', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'audience', 'watch', 'tool', 'educators', 'who', 'think', 'can', 'sweep', 'up', 'problems', 'rug']",She Fought Alone: True Stories Collection
831761,AJV7350LTB7VV,B0002EJ7KS,"Erica ""trueluv82""","[13, 16]",This movie is so gooooodddd!  I taped it off the lifetime network one day after seeing it months before.  Tiffani plays a great role as a couragious and determined teenager who wants to see the people who hurt her get punished.  Not only does she end up going against the whole town but she becomes outcasted and hurt by people she considered to be her friends.  Brian Austin Green's character is awesome as far as dealing with peer pressure and in the end just going with what he feels.  I cried in this movie and I laughed...it belongs on every girls movie shelf!
