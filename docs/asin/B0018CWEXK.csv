Grey's gets its groove back in a year that re-integrates the brilliant comedic writing and satisfying (yet not over-the-top) dramatic storylines that drew us to this show during the first two seasons.The departure of Addison Montgomery at the end of season three was particularly saddening as her character added so much to the series. However, the new characters in season four introduce some fascinating unchartered territory for Shonda Rhimes to deal with. Erica Hahn, played by Brooke Smith, adds an interesting dynamic to the season as she replaces Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Her presence threatens Cristina Yang's ego and even has one characters questioning their sexuality. Meredith Grey's sister, Lexie (played by Chyler Leigh), also arrives at Seattle Grace and becomes a series regular in season four. Her presence lays out a potentially interesting story arch for Meredith, as she becomes the first member of her family who admires her and loves her unconditionally. For the first time, Meredith is forced to seek professional assistance in working out her personal issues- the scenes that she shares with her therapist provide some of the most entertaining material of the season.New relationships are built, old ones crumble, and the staff at Seattle Grace is faced with challenges that deeply affect their lives in a season that reminds us of why we started watching Grey's in the first place!",5,Much Improved Season After Lack-Luster Season 3,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,1521,"['Season', 'Four', 'up', 'quality', 'where', 'show', 'dropped', 'off', 'third', 'season', 'Grey', 'groove', 'back', 'year', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'writing', 'satisfying', 'yet', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'dramatic', 'storylines', 'drew', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.The', 'departure', 'Addison', 'Montgomery', 'end', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'particularly', 'saddening', 'character', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'However', 'new', 'characters', 'season', 'four', 'introduce', 'fascinating', 'unchartered', 'territory', 'Shonda', 'Rhimes', 'deal', 'Erica', 'Hahn', 'played', 'Brooke', 'Smith', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'season', 'Burke', 'Seattle', 'Grace', 'Head', 'Cardiothoracic', 'Surgery', 'presence', 'Cristina', 'Yang', 'ego', 'even', 'one', 'characters', 'questioning', 'sexuality', 'Meredith', 'Grey', 'sister', 'Lexie', 'played', 'Chyler', 'Leigh', 'also', 'Seattle', 'Grace', 'series', 'regular', 'season', 'four', 'presence', 'out', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'story', 'arch', 'Meredith', 'first', 'member', 'family', 'who', 'unconditionally', 'first', 'time', 'Meredith', 'forced', 'seek', 'professional', 'assistance', 'working', 'out', 'personal', 'issues-', 'scenes', 'shares', 'therapist', 'most', 'entertaining', 'material', 'season.New', 'relationships', 'are', 'built', 'old', 'ones', 'crumble', 'staff', 'Seattle', 'Grace', 'faced', 'challenges', 'deeply', 'affect', 'lives', 'season', 'why', 'started', 'watching', 'Grey', 'first', 'place']",N/A

I didn't think the show would suffer quite as much without the Burke-Yang romance, but it has. I was hoping someone in Hollywood would make amends and bring the Burke character back........oh well! The fourth season is too chick flickish. I understand playing to your audience, but it's a medical drama too. The show has fallen into a drama strickly about women's issues, which are non-ending, complicated and sometimes too much. McSteamy is up to his old tricks, but here's the thing. If he's slept with the entire nursing staff, how come none of them are pregnant? If they're trying depict an iota of realism, someone would've (in his case, a whole lot of someone's) gotten pregnant by now. He's a good-looking doctor. Don't they keep their sperm in some kind of special bank or something?And what's with the broken speech pattern of the Dr. Bailey character? It's as if everything she's involved with is so profound that she has to ponder some grandiose answer before she speaks. And one more complaint before I get off my soap box. If the show is based in Seattle, how come we don't see more Asians or billionaires in the show? The show hasn't lost it's fizzle but the days of staying up, watching too many episodes in one night are over.

Espinosa ""The Onlooker""","[7, 9]","Portraying the twists and turns, fates and fortunes of life is what ""Grey's Anatomy"" all about, and with this fourth season this was no different. Some highlights:- Christina still hasn't coped with the loss of Burke. Her obssession with perfectionism at work is a clear sign of that. Additionally, she has to deal with the tough temperament of Dr. Hahn, Burke's substitute, who just neglects Christina's existence.- Derek develops a romantic relationship with one of the nurses at the hospital, but he clearly is still in love with Meredith, to the point they seem to get back together in the season finale after a very tough surgery that unites them under the same cause.- The marriage between George and Callie turns out to be a failure, as well as the relationship between George and Izzie, who both initially thought they had real feelings for each other.- Miranda's also with emotional issues regarding her marriage, once her devotion to work seems to be bigger than her family life.- Meredith starts therapy in order to work out her insecurities toward things, especially her shaky relationship with Derek.These were just a few of them. There's also the relationship between Alex and Rebecca, Lexie and Meredith, Callie and Hahn and Richard and Adelle that would take lines and lines to describe. Once again, this season was just about relationships. Medical cases, as always, are just in the background.Some people complain they don't know where this show is going to. In fact, it is hard to predict with so many things happening in so different ways. What makes a TV show great is the unpredictability factor. Life is just that way: unpredictable. Things don't work out as planned, sometimes we make choices just to regret later, we do strange things and decisions in moments of weakness. When it comes to emotional issues, there is no logic involved, and expecting this show to be predictable would just ruin the magic it creates.

George and Callie split, Izzie and George made a huge mistake (in my opinion) in trying to make things work out. Meredith feared commitment and Derek wanted to commit. And in the aftermath of Meredith's near death experience, she finally broke down. And then there is Burktina (Cristina and Burke)...which never happened. Like I said, everything that could go wrong did. Season 3 was about breaking the characters, exploring them and making all the mistakes. Season 4 is about mending and fixing those mistakes.This season started slowly, painfully slow I shall say. The characters seemed stuck, all of them. And try as they might, they were unable and unwilling to change. Then, it happened, slowly, but surely, they started to evolve. They started to look beyond themselves and their problems and they started to grow and mature.The first half of the season (pre-Writer's Strike) was slow and all consuming within itself; it refused to be bothered with the world around it. The first half of the season brought in a lot of change, but none of the characters were equipped or willing to deal with it. Cristina refused to confront her non-wedding, Meredith was still reeling from her near-death experience and her inability to commit with Derek. Nevermind the fact that she has to deal with a new sister! Izzie and George had to deal with a new relationship and a failed one. Alex had himself and Ava to deal with. We also saw some new characters and some characters leave. All in all the first half of the season was horrible, stale, and unable to foster change.And then the strike happened, and the creative juices must have been at their peak because what we saw in those 5 last episodes was pure brilliance. The characters finally exploded into full blooded beings in our TVs, they were finally in route to who they are supposed to become and they are finally a testament to what Grey's Anatomy is supposed to be: great, emotional and captivating.I mark the beginning of the change with the arrival of Addison, she came in waltzing in her Zen zone and her unwillingness to get stressed out and reminded everyone of who they are supposed to be and what they are supposed to be doing, all the meanwhile getting stressed herself. The show then became magnificent; my blas&eacute; viewing of the show went out the window and FINALLY I became engaged in it once more. The second half of the season was so good that I made every other crappy episode worth it. It even made season 3 worth it because we finally got to see our characters evolve. Thus, whereas Season 3 was the breaking apart of everything, this Season 4 was the mending and evolution of Grey's Anatomy.",5,A season of evolution,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2752,"['Inseason', '3', 'Grey', 'Anatomyeverything', 'fell', 'apart', 'Everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'did', 'George', 'Callie', 'split', 'Izzie', 'George', 'made', 'huge', 'mistake', 'opinion', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'Meredith', 'feared', 'commitment', 'Derek', 'wanted', 'commit', 'aftermath', 'Meredith', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'then', 'Burktina', 'Cristina', 'Burke', 'never', 'happened', 'said', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'did', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'breaking', 'characters', 'exploring', 'making', 'mistakes', 'Season', '4', 'mending', 'fixing', 'mistakes.This', 'season', 'started', 'slowly', 'painfully', 'slow', 'shall', 'say', 'characters', 'seemed', 'stuck', 'try', 'might', 'were', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'change', 'Then', 'happened', 'slowly', 'surely', 'started', 'evolve', 'started', 'look', 'problems', 'started', 'grow', 'mature.The', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'pre-Writer', 'Strike', 'was', 'slow', 'consuming', 'refused', 'be', 'bothered', 'world', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'brought', 'lot', 'change', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'equipped', 'willing', 'deal', 'Cristina', 'refused', 'confront', 'non-wedding', 'Meredith', 'was', 'still', 'reeling', 'near-death', 'experience', 'inability', 'commit', 'Derek', 'Nevermind', 'fact', 'deal', 'new', 'sister', 'Izzie', 'George', 'had', 'deal', 'new', 'relationship', 'failed', 'one', 'Alex', 'had', 'Ava', 'deal', 'also', 'saw', 'new', 'characters', 'characters', 'leave', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'was', 'horrible', 'stale', 'unable', 'foster', 'change.And', 'then', 'strike', 'happened', 'creative', 'juices', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'peak', 'what', 'saw', '5', 'last', 'episodes', 'was', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'characters', 'finally', 'exploded', 'full', 'blooded', 'beings', 'TVs', 'were', 'finally', 'route', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'become', 'are', 'finally', 'testament', 'what', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'emotional', 'captivating.I', 'mark', 'beginning', 'change', 'arrival', 'Addison', 'came', 'waltzing', 'Zen', 'zone', 'unwillingness', 'get', 'stressed', 'out', 'reminded', 'everyone', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'meanwhile', 'getting', 'stressed', 'show', 'then', 'became', 'magnificent', 'blas', 'eacute', 'viewing', 'show', 'went', 'out', 'window', 'FINALLY', 'became', 'engaged', 'once', 'more', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'made', 'other', 'crappy', 'episode', 'even', 'made', 'season', '3', 'worth', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'characters', 'evolve', 'Thus', 'whereas', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'breaking', 'apart', 'everything', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'mending', 'evolution', 'Grey', 'Anatomy']",N/A

Season 2, in my opinion, was even better than season 1, but then season three started to drag. Then came season 4. As much as I loved Greys, I stopped watching it after the first few episodes. I've read many fans say here that the show quality got better after the strike, and I did watch the season finale and was happy that the show seemed to be better. But will I watch season 5? No. I'm sorry, but Greys has gotten so melodramatic, and the characters so unlikable that I don't really care what happens to them anymore. My favorite characters, George and Izzie, became almost as selfish and self-absorbed as Meredith, which is truly sad. The other factor was the odd hookups. I knew the writers were desperate when I saw they were trying to put George and Izzie together, and after that relationship started I stopped watching the show. When a friend told me  that Callie had randomly turned into a lesbian I couldn't believe it. Come on! This show was always soapy and over-the-top, but the writing quality was always so strong that those factors didn't matter to me.

The first few episodes were great even though the deer thing was little far-fetched, but ""Haunt Me Everyday"" was an amazing episode and probably my favorite of the season though the finale was great too, definitely season 2 finale status.  As for the bad parts, it nearly wasn't exciting as the rest of the seasons, I was bored for basically episode six before the last two episodes.  The storylines this season were horrible, seriously!  Callie being all weak and sucking at her job because George left was ridiculous, shes a strong women and I didn't really see her behaving that way.  And then she suddenly became a lezbian, which is so dumb.  Callie obviously has no reason to be on the show if shes not with George.  Write her off already(Hahn too, shes just the same).  And once again Mark is just a decoy for Derek, he has no point being on the show either, which is dissapointing because I really liked him too at first. And don't get me started on Lexie!  She is just there to follow Meredith around and be annoying, but I loved that George kissed her in the finale, I see definite potential there but I sort of feel a brother and sister connection. Though, there were some good storylines too.  First, im so glad we got to see Alex's emotional side because i've been waiting forever for this to come, he's not so bad.  Im glad Izzie and Alex got together but Im really mad the way they wrote Ava off because I liked her too.  Did she really have to be crazy?  Really?  Can't someone have a happy ending?  And on that note, im glad that Meredith and Derek finally got together.  Also, I don't know how often I have to say this but the new hookups are so tiring!
