This is just a really LAME movie. *SPOILER ALERT* OK, this woman is buried alive and it's been 24 hours, probably more than that before she is uncovered. All science points to the near-certainty that she is dead by then. When she's found, she is not only not gasping for air, she PLAYS dead for a few seconds and then magically SPRINGS out of the box and knocks Houdini silly with her flashlight. HAHAHAHA! And I thought HE was supposed to be Houdini! * END SPOILER ALERT* And that was great how a dozen cops were staked out at the graveyard, and when Houdini escapes, no one is around to cut him off and arrest him--they just let him go. And then the world's greatest cop played by Tierney takes off after him in a high-speed chase without wearing her seat belt--brilliant--I hope they gave her a ticket, despite the fact that she got instant karma by hitting her head on the steering wheel, allowing Houdini to walk away. And how about those effective interrogation techniques employed by the police force? ""You won't talk, oh, OK, I'm sorry to have bothered you.""--that's what they must have said. How about punching the crap out of him like in other movies? A woman's life is at stake here, for crying out loud!And what was with the rough sex crap? That had nothing to do with the main story. They clumsily attempted to somehow tie that into the story when Houdini and Madeline were talking ""privately"", but it just didn't make much sense. And a dumb ending...OK, Madeline saved the day, but now she's back to moping around feeling sorry for herself for being a sex addict outside her marriage, and that's it.

That's a peculiar pleasure, and not the least, for the movie lover to discover a little pearl  amidst the hollywoodian dinosaurs. So surprise, surprise ! Firstly, The  jacket announced a special widescreen copy ; Nada ! just a pan &amp; scan  version, the movie killer by excellence as any movie buff knows it. Then a  look at iMDB told me that OXYGEN was a TV-movie, but, in the user section,  a reviewer was certifying that OXYGEN had been shown in two theaters ! What  a salad ! (french expression).Let's go back to Richard Shepard's movie  which star Maura Tierney and Adrien Brody. Miss Tierney plays the character  of a woman detective of the NYPD, married to her chief, and with a slight  booze problem. On the other hand, Adrien Brody is a charming young man  whose principal activity is to bury alive the women of wealthy men in order  to obtain some money while the poor victims are suffocating. Well, that's a  story !And that's not the end of it ! Just imagine that Adrien Brody is  also a fan of Harry Houdini, the famous magician of the beginning of the  XXth century and likes to play with the nerves of the cops by escaping from  the most unusual places. You also are going to appreciate the manner  Richard Shepard,with subtlety, plays with one of the most common of  cinematographic themes : vampires.In short, OXYGEN is a very good  surprise with excellent actors, it's a nervous little thriller with enough  beef to please the most blas&eacute;s movie lovers.A commentary and the usual  trailers and filmographies.

473115,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,630568040X,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[33, 34]","It's been a long time since I've seriously blind bought a DVD or video.  I normally go the rental way.  But as I was passing through ... I stumbled upon this interesting film. It was called OXYGEN.  I later discovered it was made for Showtime Television, as an original movie.  I can see why, it's a potentially taught thriller, that's half realized.Maura Tierney (Scotland PA) stars as Madeline Foster, a New York City Cop with a few humiliating secrets.  Adrien Brody, (The Pianist) is Harry, a psychopath who has buried a women (Laila Robins, True Crime) alive in an elaborate extortion plot.  When Harry refuses to talk to anyone but Foster, these two lives are caught in a dangerous cat and mouse game, and a women's life is at stake.For what it's worth this is a well thought out thriller here.  The elements are there to create a taught and fairly compelling cat and mouse game.  But as the pieces fall into place, you realize its foundation is a house of cards and in the end everything is a little forced.I think the biggest problem is that Brody's character knows too much.  He puts two and two together far faster than even the audience does.  For instance, he notices cigarette burns on Foster's arm.  Instantly he jumps to a conclusion, that while true, takes a leap far to big for it's own good.Tierney's character doesn't fare much better.  The screenplay by Writer/Director Richard Shepard (The Linguini Incident) is too vague about her.  Creating tension that goes nowhere.  She's fighting demons of course, but does she do it for Alcohol?  To give into some crazy fetish?  Since the movie only makes a feeble attempt to sort out her problems, it falls flat. Every explanation comes from Harry's mouth a man she's never met before and I don't think he's that bright.But on a positive note, Tierney and Brody are excellent in their roles. Even if I didn't buy the premise, those two actors are just so damn watchable.  Tierney is like the girl next door with edge, the camera loves her, and she's so good at everything I've ever seen her do.  I like how her performance transcends the material.  She brings it all up a notch, something that a lesser actress would struggle with.  Her performance reveals a woman who is struggling, even if the struggles are a little trite and silly.Furthermore, Brody makes a great psycho.  I liked everything about his character.  I love how there is never a moment that he feels cornered.  He runs the show at every minute.  Like Harry Houdini (in which the story makes frequent reference too), Brody's character is an escape artist, with a sarcastic edge.  In a better film this kind of character could win him an Oscar.  Hmm.... I wonder if they ever did Hannibal Lecter: The Early Years, if they would consider hiring Brody?  He's that good here.OXYGEN is a half realized but watchable film.  It wears its flaws on its sleeve.  But it also has two really great performances in it.  So do I recommend you see it?  If you're nit-picky like me, than you probably won't like it.  If you can give a movie its due despite it's many flaws, than yes.*** out of 5",3,"Tierney and Brody are Great, The Movie is Just Okay!!",1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,3108,"['been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seriously', 'blind', 'bought', 'DVD', 'video', 'normally', 'go', 'rental', 'way', 'was', 'passing', 'stumbled', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'OXYGEN', 'later', 'discovered', 'was', 'made', 'Showtime', 'Television', 'original', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'potentially', 'taught', 'thriller', 'half', 'realized.Maura', 'Tierney', 'Scotland', 'PA', 'Madeline', 'Foster', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Cop', 'few', 'humiliating', 'secrets', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Pianist', 'Harry', 'psychopath', 'who', 'buried', 'women', 'Laila', 'Robins', 'True', 'Crime', 'alive', 'elaborate', 'extortion', 'plot', 'When', 'Harry', 'talk', 'anyone', 'Foster', 'two', 'lives', 'are', 'caught', 'dangerous', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'women', 'life', 'stake.For', 'what', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'thriller', 'here', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'create', 'taught', 'fairly', 'compelling', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'pieces', 'fall', 'place', 'realize', 'foundation', 'house', 'cards', 'end', 'everything', 'little', 'forced.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Brody', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'far', 'faster', 'even', 'audience', 'instance', 'cigarette', 'burns', 'Foster', 'arm', 'Instantly', 'conclusion', 'true', 'leap', 'far', 'big', 'own', 'good.Tierney', 'character', ""n't"", 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'screenplay', 'Writer/Director', 'Richard', 'Shepard', 'Linguini', 'Incident', 'too', 'vague', 'Creating', 'tension', 'nowhere', 'fighting', 'demons', 'course', 'do', 'Alcohol', 'give', 'crazy', 'fetish', 'movie', 'only', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'sort', 'out', 'problems', 'flat', 'explanation', 'Harry', 'mouth', 'man', 'never', 'met', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bright.But', 'positive', 'note', 'Tierney', 'Brody', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'premise', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'watchable', 'Tierney', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'edge', 'camera', 'so', 'good', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'how', 'performance', 'material', 'up', 'notch', 'something', 'lesser', 'actress', 'would', 'struggle', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'struggling', 'even', 'struggles', 'are', 'little', 'trite', 'silly.Furthermore', 'Brody', 'great', 'psycho', 'liked', 'everything', 'character', 'love', 'how', 'never', 'moment', 'cornered', 'show', 'minute', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'story', 'frequent', 'reference', 'too', 'Brody', 'character', 'escape', 'artist', 'sarcastic', 'edge', 'better', 'film', 'kind', 'character', 'could', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Hmm', 'wonder', 'ever', 'did', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Early', 'Years', 'would', 'consider', 'hiring', 'Brody', 'good', 'here.OXYGEN', 'half', 'realized', 'watchable', 'film', 'flaws', 'sleeve', 'also', 'two', 'really', 'great', 'performances', 'So', 'do', 'recommend', 'see', ""'re"", 'nit-picky', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'due', 'many', 'flaws', 'yes', '***', '5']",N/A

For me this was an unexpected, totally engrossing and tense surprise. Brody, in an atypical role, plays a psychopath who kidnaps a wealthy art dealer's wife, buries her alive, and demands one million dollars ransom to disclose her location. Tierney plays and alcoholic and masochistic cop called in to the case. If you are looking for an action film filled with chases and gun play, then this is not for you. MINOR SPOILER ALERT: With the exception of one car chase, this is a psychological cat-and-mouse game, both before and especially after Brody is captured, as time (and oxygen) runs out for the kidnap victim. Writer-director Richard Shepherd paces the film extremely well - there is always the underlying uneasy feeling that this is something more than just a kidnapping. Brody is terrific, as he underplays his role to great effect - his performance has taken a page from Anthony Hopkins' performance in Silence Of The Lambs. Tierney is fine as she wrestles with her demons, ones that are exposed in her one-on-one sessions with Brody. There is also fine support from Terry Kinney as Tierney's captain and husband, who has to deal with demons of his own.

Whether this kind of nepotism is realistic is not important, as their relationship is very human and very real.Tierney makes the mistake of facing Brody in the interrogation room, where he manages to take the upper hand in picking away at her weaknesses.Laila Robins as the burial victim offers a strong, gutwrenching performance as a woman pleading for her life, yet remaining as strong as the situation allows.There's measured suspense in wondering if Brody will ever tell anyone where Robins is; he's a master of smart-talk, cool control and out and out disgusting.  An Oscar nomination would have been appropriate, had the movie had a better release.A tense, disturbing little thriller with an unusual ending.",5,TAKE A DEEP BREATH,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,1240,"['OXYGEN', 'subtly', 'breathtaking', 'thriller', 'cinematic', 'tension', 'performances', 'very', 'idea', 'horrible', 'act', 'psychotic', 'perpetrates', 'remorse', 'conscience.Adrien', 'Brody', 'pre', 'PIANIST', 'dynamic', 'controlled', 'skin-crawling', 'performance', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'buried', 'alive', 'asking', 'million', 'dollars', 'tell', 'where', 'buried', 'her.Maura', 'Giveney', 'superb', 'alcoholic', 'detective', 'who', 'married', 'boss', 'Terry', 'Kinney', 'kind', 'nepotism', 'realistic', 'not', 'important', 'relationship', 'very', 'human', 'very', 'real.Tierney', 'mistake', 'facing', 'Brody', 'interrogation', 'room', 'where', 'take', 'upper', 'hand', 'picking', 'away', 'weaknesses.Laila', 'Robins', 'burial', 'victim', 'strong', 'gutwrenching', 'performance', 'woman', 'pleading', 'life', 'yet', 'remaining', 'as', 'strong', 'situation', 'measured', 'suspense', 'wondering', 'Brody', 'will', 'ever', 'tell', 'anyone', 'where', 'Robins', 'master', 'smart-talk', 'cool', 'control', 'out', 'disgusting', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate', 'had', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'release.A', 'tense', 'disturbing', 'little', 'thriller', 'unusual', 'ending']",N/A

Welcome to it.This has a fine premise to it, I must say. A sociopath (Adrien Brody) kidnaps the claustrophobic wife of a millionaire and buries her in a box with about a day's worth of oxygen. A husband-and-wife cop team (Terry Kinney, Maura Tierney) have about that much time to figure out where she's buried.Brody was the only thing worth watching in Summer of Sam. Tierney does well in almost everything. Same with James Naughton, who plays the millionaire, and Paul Calderon as Tierney's on-again off-again partner.But this is bad. Bad, bad, bad. Despite wonderful sociopathy by Brody&#8212;once again the only decent thing about the flick (that's starting to become a refrain with me)&#8212;a number of subplots are started and never finished, no suspense is ever built up, the relationship between Tierney and her onscreen husband is just silly, the cliched battles between the cops and the bottle are trotted out with absolutely nothing new. All in all it's a jumbled, silly, unwatchable mess that should have been left on the cutting room floor.

473130,ABLBRUT8DALNN,630568040X,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","I'm often asked why I waste my time watching independant films. It's true, that many of them are a complete waste of time, but what I really enjoy about them is that it gives people the freedom to do what they want, without Hollywood turning it into something it's not, and occasionally, I find a movie like Oxygen. This film was just your ordinary story of the police fighting against the clock and an insane criminal, who gets off on messing with them. It had a few twists here and there, but in general it was a very basic story, however what I did focus my attention on was the cast. Being that it's an independent film, two performers who I really enjoy watching, got to step away from their usual roles and try something different. Maura Tierney is usually cast as the emotionless girl with a troubled past, but in Oxygen, she's this crazy, self-loathing, tough as nails cop, who wears her emotions on her sleeve. She's opposed by Adrien Brody who usually plays the sweet, good-looking, exotic stranger, but not this time. In this film, Brody is a deranged psychopath who will do anything and everything to get what he wants. The dynamic and chemistry were both fantastic and I loved seeing two actors, that I know very well, step away from their usual roles and work on something different. If I hadn't seen both stars in a ton of things prior to this, I may not have been as entertained by this film, as the story is common, and very little is unpredictable, however the performances were tremendous and Tiereny and Brody compliment each other perfectly.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1562,"[""'m"", 'often', 'asked', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'independant', 'films', 'true', 'many', 'are', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'what', 'really', 'enjoy', 'people', 'freedom', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'Hollywood', 'turning', 'something', 'not', 'occasionally', 'find', 'movie', 'Oxygen', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'story', 'police', 'fighting', 'clock', 'insane', 'criminal', 'who', 'off', 'messing', 'had', 'few', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'general', 'was', 'very', 'basic', 'story', 'however', 'what', 'did', 'focus', 'attention', 'was', 'cast', 'Being', 'independent', 'film', 'two', 'performers', 'who', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'got', 'step', 'away', 'usual', 'roles', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'usually', 'cast', 'emotionless', 'girl', 'troubled', 'past', 'Oxygen', 'crazy', 'self-loathing', 'tough', 'nails', 'cop', 'who', 'emotions', 'sleeve', 'opposed', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'who', 'usually', 'sweet', 'good-looking', 'exotic', 'stranger', 'not', 'time', 'film', 'Brody', 'deranged', 'psychopath', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'everything', 'get', 'what', 'dynamic', 'chemistry', 'were', 'fantastic', 'loved', 'seeing', 'two', 'actors', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'step', 'away', 'usual', 'roles', 'work', 'something', 'different', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stars', 'ton', 'things', 'prior', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'entertained', 'film', 'story', 'common', 'very', 'little', 'unpredictable', 'however', 'performances', 'were', 'tremendous', 'Tiereny', 'Brody', 'compliment', 'other', 'perfectly']",N/A
