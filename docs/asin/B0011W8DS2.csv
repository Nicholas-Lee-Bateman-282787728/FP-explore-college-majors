1133347,A2X1OCV002VU1Q,B0011W8DS2,Dsire,"[0, 0]","Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a hauntingly comedic film!  A work project brings Siddharth and his wife Avni to India.  The couple go straight to Siddharth's ancestral mansion, unbeknownst to the family, who tell them that they cannot stay there for the simple reason it was haunted.  Siddharth and Avni considers them superstitious.  Curious about the mansion and the locked quarters, Avni  gains access with the consent of her husband  and inadvertently, unleashes a series of strange and deathly happenings!  Siddharth suspecting his childhood friend of a psychological problem , contacts a Psychologist friend, Aditya (Akshay Kumar) for help.  Siddharth's messages go unanswered.  In the meantime the family has contacted another well known Psychologist.  Aditya dramatically and unexpectedly arrives creating disturbances in the house.  Was he the ghost?  Siddharth vouches for Aditya's humanness.  He employs unusual techniques in his investigations, diverts some near fatal incidents, chases after a singing voice and the sound of anklets jingling at night.  What Aditya suspects is confirmed when he, Siddharth and a bridegroom to be, sees who is singing and dancing one night.  Siddharth is devastated.  The film then transports you back in time to a scene of two court dancers, exquisitely executing a classical Indian dance, in the presence of dignitaries.  The Prince enters as the dance is in progress.  Reincarnation or d&eacute;j&agrave; vu?  What follows is a horrifying memory of the past, but the Psychiatrists have concocted  a somewhat terrifying scene that could solve the problem and give rest to the disturbed soul.  Akshay Kumar is his usual comic self as one of the capable Psychologists, the Hindustani way!  I also loved watching Vidya Balan who I think is a great actress!  I really enjoyed watching this movie more so after buying the DVD and saw parts that were cut when watching it on TV.

1133348,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0011W8DS2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 8]","It begins with Siddharth returning home to India on a visit, and accompanied by his newlywed wife, Avni. Siddharth, descended from local royalty, intends to occupy the long-deserted ancestral manor, even though his rustic relatives deeply fear that it's haunted. But Siddharth and Avni are a modern couple and brush away the warnings as superstitious nonsense. There's a door in the manor which has been kept sealed off, the locals believing that two restless spirits are imprisoned behind it. A curious Avni opens the door, and, immediately, spooky stuff starts to happen.But, despite the mounting paranormal assaults, Siddharth and Avni continue to be skeptical and dismissive of the rural legends. Siddharth proposes a theory which blames all the weird events on a mentally unbalanced culprit. He attempts to get in contact with an old friend, a renowned psychiatrist. Which is where Akshay Kumar comes in, halfway thru the film. He plays the unconventional Dr. Aditya Shrivastav, and right away enlivens the movie screen. And, believe me, at this stage, it needed enlivening.Sometimes, you flip a coin when you watch a Bollywood film. Most of these pictures tend to make for lengthy viewing, and, sometimes, with two and a half hours to fill, you get copious fat with the lean. BHOOL BHULAIYAA, like most of Bollywood cinema, spans several genres. It's a supernatural thriller, only with the thrills mostly absent. It explores the film's psychological underpinnings, and has some fair success at it. And, because the filmmakers somehow thought this would be seamlessly appropriate, BHOOL BHYLAIYAA is also a slapstick comedy. Check that, it tries to be a slapstick comedy. Me, I winced a lot.And, really, when Akshay's character was explaining his theory to his highly educated audience, did he really need the visual aid of a Wikipedia fact sheet on the computer? *Cough**cheesy**Cough*The ""scares"" are cheap and toothless, predicated on time-honored horror cliches. The sudden discordant noises. The menacing shadows scurrying along the wall. Fleeting and murky reflections glimpsed out of the corner of the eye. Stuff crashing to the floor or flying across the room. The film does salvage itself near the end, and I do like how the psychiatrist manages to bring clarity and effect a resolution, even if the resolution is a bit unsettling. However, the constant, jarring shifts to silly comedy undermine what possibly could've been a more atmospheric horror-suspense flick. And, surprisingly, for a Bollywood venture, the movie falls down on the romantic arcs. I was underwhelmed by the chemistry between Vidya Balan (Avni) and Shiney Ajuja (Siddharth), while Akshay and Amisha Patel barely share the camera.But the cast is okay, with the lovely Vidya Balan and Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar turning in the performances worth mentioning. I thought that the songs (Oh, yes, this is Bollywood, so there are songs!) were bland, excepting the track at the end, ""Hare Krishna Hare Ram,"" which had a hip hop flavoring. This dvd also comes with a ""Making of BHOOL BHULAIYAA"" featurette, which is 21 minutes long and partly in English. BHOOL BHULAIYAA, released in 2007, made a lot of money in India's box offices, and, really, I can only attribute that to Akshay Kumar's star power. Sporadically funny, hardly frightening, and ploddingly paced, this film is just about bearable. I didn't mind watching it, and the last half hour is pretty good stuff. But I probably won't see this again.
