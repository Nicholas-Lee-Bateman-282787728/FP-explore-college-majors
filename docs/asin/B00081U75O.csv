There were many new guest stars and their characters seemed rather unreal, creating an atmosphere that did not work so well.  If you can forgive the drop in quality of the stories you might even like this set, but if you don't want to spoil your fine memories of season one and two, you may want to bypass it. Or perhaps out of curiosity you will want to know what happened to the Marshalls after Rick was transported back into our world and Uncle Jack arrived to care for Will and Holly in the Land of the Lost.  My rating of four stars might be a bit too generous (I would have given this set 3.8 stars if that were allowed).  This DVD set is just as good as the other two in its picture and sound quality, which might make up for some of what the episodes lack.

898124,A22XHZ3MFP6MSV,B00081U75O,Cranky Reviewer,"[72, 77]","The third season of Land of the Lost sadly shows signs that the creators didn't really care any more.  The expensive new sets look fantastic, but don't expect any of the thought-provoking or intriguing stories (or big-name writers!) of the first two seasons.  In fact, the writers apparently didn't pay much attention to the previous seasons, as there are some serious discrepancies.  There is also a tendency to rehash plot points, and some Gilligans-Islandism in the form of mysterious one-shot guest stars who appear and depart.The extras for the Season 3  are sparse as well.  The only commentary is one by the actor who played Uncle Jack, and it mainly consists of his talking about how great the show was.High Point--The addition of a Cro-Magnon man, Malak, as an alternate villain.  Malak is a God-wannabee. The Marshalls have to save the Sleestack from him--interesting twist, and it could have gone in very cool directions with less lazy scripting.Low Points--The Marshalls choose to move into the temple in the lost City, basically on the front porch of the Sleestack.  Smart move.Uncle Jack replaced Rick Marshall, and is not as likeable a character.  It might have worked better if they had made him a different sort of person, rather than dumping him right in Daddy's shoes. He even wears the same khaki clothes...Cha-ka switches to full pidgin English, and forgets his grammar so far as to regularly refer to himself as 'a Pakuni' instead of a Paku.Holly is somehow still wearing the same jeans and shirt she was lost in, in spite of the fact that she's a foot taller and developing a bosom. Months/years of running from dinosaurs and climbing rocks seems to have not worn any holes in the knees or made any stains on the shirt.  I bet a lot of parents wish they could buy their kids an outfit like that...The Sleestack leader is able to talk...but he is apparently not the intelligent Salatch of Season 1, but just a talking Sleestack as ignorant as the others.  The Sleestack (including Enik) refer to themselves as 'Sleestack' rather than Altrusians as in Season 2.  (They call Enik an Altrusian occasionally, though.)  Enik pretty much becomes the errand boy of the Sleestack, and starts channeling Spock in his commentary on what is 'logical' all the time. Every other episode involves the Sleestack going to the library of skulls to ask how to get rid of the Marshalls. I guess too many people said the library was cool!Apparently having exhausted their store of science-fiction ideas, fantasy elements are added.  These include a fire-breathing dino, a two-headed dino, a unicorn, Medusa, the Flying Dutchman, etc.  The Marshalls accept this all without so much as a ""What the heck?""And, the kiss of death--Will gets a cheesy-looking home-made banjo and starts singing bad 70's-style tunes with full orchestral accompaniment.  Whenever a main character starts singing at the end of the program (or worse, starts a rock band) you can bet that series is on it's last season.Goodbye, Land of the Lost!

898125,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B00081U75O,drebbles,"[2, 4]","As the third season of ""Land of the Lost"" opens, an earthquake strikes just as Rick Marshall opens a time doorway. Before his children, Will and Holly, can reach him, he falls through and the doorway closes. Will and Holly aren't alone for long as they find their Uncle Jack has landed in the Land of the Lost while looking for them. They soon discover the earthquake has destroyed the cave they were living in and take refuge in a temple, along with Chaka, the only Pakuni to survive the earthquake. The Marshalls have to deal with their old nemesis the Sleestaks, fight off dinosaurs including Torchy, a fire breathing dinosaur, and various other threats, all while trying to reach home.The third and last season of ""Land of the Lost"" was very disappointing. The loss of Spencer Milligan as Rick Marshall was a shame, although Ron Harper did a good job as Uncle Jack. But the show was sloppy overall. Gone were such creative characters like the Zarn from season two. Instead, the writers threw in a series of unbelievable visitors to the Land of the Lost: Medusa, the Abominable Snowman, and the Flying Dutchman to name just a few. These visitors seem to have no problem escaping from the Land of the Lost, although the Marshalls have been looking for a way to get out for years. Holly even gets a pet unicorn and bakes a cake in one episode - where'd she get the ingredients? Chaka is now a regular character and can speak perfect English, with no explanation why. Most of the episodes focused on the Sleestaks blaming anything and everything on the Marshalls and saying they must be destroyed. Wesley Eure sang at the end of a few episodes, seemingly backed by a full orchestra.Also disappointing is the lack of extras. Outside of some stuff with Ron Harper there aren't any extras. It would have been fun to hear Wesley Eure's and Kathy Coleman's thoughts on the third season as their commentary on some of the episodes was one of the highlights of the DVDs from the first and second seasons.There are a couple of good episodes from the third season, notably ""Timestop"" and ""Scarab"", but most of Season Three of ""Land of the Lost"" is a disappointment.",2,Very Disappointing,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,2156,"['third', 'season', 'Land', 'Lost', 'earthquake', 'strikes', 'just', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'time', 'doorway', 'children', 'Will', 'Holly', 'can', 'reach', 'doorway', 'Will', 'Holly', 'are', ""n't"", 'alone', 'long', 'find', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'landed', 'Land', 'Lost', 'looking', 'soon', 'discover', 'earthquake', 'destroyed', 'cave', 'were', 'living', 'take', 'refuge', 'temple', 'Chaka', 'only', 'Pakuni', 'survive', 'earthquake', 'Marshalls', 'have', 'deal', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Sleestaks', 'fight', 'off', 'dinosaurs', 'including', 'Torchy', 'fire', 'breathing', 'dinosaur', 'various', 'other', 'threats', 'trying', 'reach', 'home.The', 'third', 'last', 'season', 'Land', 'Lost', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'loss', 'Spencer', 'Milligan', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'was', 'shame', 'Ron', 'Harper', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'show', 'was', 'sloppy', 'overall', 'Gone', 'were', 'such', 'creative', 'characters', 'Zarn', 'season', 'two', 'Instead', 'writers', 'threw', 'series', 'unbelievable', 'visitors', 'Land', 'Lost', 'Medusa', 'Abominable', 'Snowman', 'Flying', 'Dutchman', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'visitors', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'escaping', 'Land', 'Lost', 'Marshalls', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'way', 'get', 'out', 'years', 'Holly', 'even', 'pet', 'unicorn', 'cake', 'one', 'episode', 'where', ""'d"", 'get', 'ingredients', 'Chaka', 'now', 'regular', 'character', 'can', 'speak', 'perfect', 'English', 'explanation', 'why', 'Most', 'episodes', 'focused', 'Sleestaks', 'blaming', 'anything', 'everything', 'Marshalls', 'saying', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'Wesley', 'Eure', 'sang', 'end', 'few', 'episodes', 'seemingly', 'backed', 'full', 'orchestra.Also', 'disappointing', 'lack', 'extras', 'stuff', 'Ron', 'Harper', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'hear', 'Wesley', 'Eure', 'Kathy', 'Coleman', 'thoughts', 'third', 'season', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'DVDs', 'first', 'second', 'seasons.There', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'notably', 'Timestop', 'Scarab', 'most', 'Season', 'Three', 'Land', 'Lost', 'disappointment']",N/A

The fact is that Season 3 of Land of the Lost is alot of fun and my two young boys (ages 6 and 9) and me, their dad, really enjoyed it.  If you ask your kids what they love most about the Land of the Lost they will run down a whole host of things like Sleestacks, Dinosaurs, Chaka, Will & Holly, Pylons, etc. etc.  The character Rick Marshall will be very low on the list if he makes the list at all.  Given that actor Spencer Milligan chose to leave the show the producers wisely built season 3 around the kids and Chaka who are at the top of the target audience's list.  Their adult guardian is now Uncle Jack who was played straight by a great actor.  The Star Trek writing staff that knocked so many season 1 and 2 episodes out of the park are MIA but the season 3 writing crew have alot of fun crafting stories that you and your kids will really enjoy as it includes guests like Medusa, the Flying Dutchman, and a fire breathing dinosaur!  My 9 year old openly mocked me when I tried to out-nerd him by criticizing these new plot points before we ordered season 3 when he countered: ""You don't like a fire breathing dragon? OK!  You don't like the Flying Dutchman?  OK""  Schooled by a 9 year old.As a long time James Bond fan I was particularly happy to see the actor who played Jaws show up often in season 3.I'm not sure of the break downs but season 1 had a formula like 1/4 episodes for sleestacks, 1/4 episodes for ""guests"" to the LotLost, etc.  Season 3 may have ramped up the ""guest"" quotient but thats all good as you still get a healthy dose of Sleestacks too.I will concede that there is one episode where Enik says the word ""Illogical"" over and over and over and I thought I was going to punch something if he didn't stop.  That episode must have been written by an intern or something.  But in hindsight one could put the kids to bed and use that one episode for a fairly hilarious drinking game!  Every time Enik says ""Illogical"" then drink!  One would be pretty drunk after those 22 minutes. Haha.Note that if the Marshalls are speaking pidgeon-Pakuni in season 2 then it makes sense that Chaka is speaking pigeon-English in season 3.  We really enjoyed the references to previous seasons like when Will scolded Chaka for throwing his fishing pole into the water (back in a previous season) and Chaka counters: ""But that best part!!"".  Hilarious.Yes Season 3 breaks the first 2 seasons continuity somewhat and doesn't square with the last episode of Season 1 which can be seen as the Series finale.  But this is Saturday morning kids fair so maybe this was some alternate universe Marshall family like the one stuck in the cave wall in the previous season!  Whatever the reason I'm glad they produced another season and it was great to see the kids having such a fun run on such a fun show.All in all a fun season to cap the series and as a previous reviewer said ""it's canon"".  If you're a collector then I recommend the Rhino DVD releases for the quality and awesomeness of the bonus content.

898135,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B00081U75O,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 2]","I cannot even hope to match the great essays written by others on Land of the Lost Season Three, but perhaps I might mention some items that may have been glossed over.First, Season Three begins with a POOR lead in song. Gone was the FUN theme song of seasons one and two. Add to this that the T Rex, Alice, or is it an Alicesaurus, CROWS almost like a rooster. Someone cut the dinosaur's growl and so it starts off sounding like a rooster. Oh, and can anyone say ""shakey camera"" which was suppossed to pass for an earthquake??? And finally, the song is so poor ""looking for a way to escape, scape, scape, scape? Come one, a teenager could have made up a better song.All of the above foreshadows what would be the LAST and horrendously BAD season of Land of the Lost. Gone was the very cool cave. In was the temple home, and as someone said ""on the porch"" of the Sleestacks. How stupid. And what was to keep the T Rex or Alisaourus from simply pushing the stone door over??? Oh, and that small fire outside was suppossed to be a deterant to the Sleestacks??? Come ON.Ok, and as someone else mentioned, the SET of this third season is probably a lot better in places, but WHY must the Marshalls pass everyday in front of Lu Lu at the lagoon??? Do they need to pass by that every DAY???? There are some cool looking BIG TREES though in the third season. And Torchy the dinosaur was pretty cool as was the character Malik.Now, for the special guests. First, they were hardly special. Mostly they were simply STUPID. The Abominable Snowman and that other creature from the ""high country"" must have been cousins. Those costumes were ridiculous, and those stories were AWFUL. The indian and US Cavalry story was also very bad. And HOW BAD was ""Corny"" the Unicorn?????? They used a pony and added a very visible horn on a shroud. We could see the shroud on the pony's head. Come On. Then there was the Medusa character. Another Medusa?????? The character in the balloon. How bad that episode was. I think the Flying Dutchman was actually one of the better episodes. Then there was the riduclous repairman episode.Season Three was simply bad, bad, bad. Fans of the show LOVED the Marshalls. Uncle Jack was not a bad character at all. I won't say he was not likeable, it's just that he didn't try to be a father figure for Holly and Will. And finally, did anyone else notice that the Sleestack got SMALLER in the final season. Oh, and some of the sleestack were a little chubby as well. And Enik and the sleestacks just became a JOKE to the Marshalls. Gone was the respect for sleestacks. Gone was a fear of the sleestacks. But still somehow the Marshalls were always being captured or corned by those inept sleestacks. And yes, Will Marshall singing to a gourd guitar. It even sounded like his voice, but obviously the music was preprepared. And the tunes were so, so, so GAY. I'm sorry to use that word, but the tunes were beyond embarrassing. And Wesley Eure, always the true professional, never seemed to care how ridiculous or infantile his role in the show became.Yes, Land of the Lost died in a most embarrassing way in Season Three. I have Season three in the new 2009 Complete Series form, and I'm a little embarrassed to own it. Even in the weaker shows of seasons one and two I could still watch each episode with some sort of childish fascination. And then came season THREE which RUBBED OUR NOSES INTO THE REALITY THAT THIS WAS A SHOW CREATED FOR CHILDREN. The first two seasons treated those children with RESPECT and DIGNITY. The final season made fools of the actors and the fans. I guess this is why I do not remember every having seen any of these episodes. I don't think the third season was aired in my area, or I simply stopped watching the show.

898136,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00081U75O,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[36, 39]","Before buying all 3 seasons on DVD, I read the reviews thoroughly. One of the reasons I became an Amazon reviewer is due to the fantastic warnings against bad items and encouraging words of recommendations for others from reliable reviewers... but I did not follow my own advice on heeding the words of wisdom from so many reviewers that gave this season such a poor review.These shows are AWFUL! Rick Marshall is gone and we don't know why Spencer Milligan left the show. To explain his absence, a new horrendous theme song is introduced - written by Wayne Osmond of the famed Osmond family... the song explains how during yet another earth quake, another time shift occurs - Rick is playing with the crystals in one of the pylons when the earthquake hits and he is sucked into a time doorway. Instead of chasing after him so they can at least be in the same time period as dear old dad, Will and Holly just stare and scream for their father.The earthquake has destroyed their home in the cave and as they look for new shelter, they find Cha-Ka all alone - all the other Pakuni are gone - missing, and it would appear Cha-Ka is the last of his species. Conveniently, another familiar father figure falls from the sky - ""Uncle Jack"" Marshall went looking for his missing brother and niece and nephew and conveniently did so at the same time the earthquake hit and found himself also in the Land of the Lost. Uncle Jack (Ron Harper of ""The Planet of the Apes"" TV series fame) wears the same outfit as his brother and has similar survivalists skills.The three family members and Cha-Ka move in together - into a temple in the lost city... new animals are introduced which look like they were put together by Stevie Wonder. There's Lu-Lu- the 2-headed water dragon that has these forked tongues that stick out about 6 feet and then there's Torchy - a dinosaur that breathes fire for no particular reason. He doesn't use it just for defense - but just because he can. In nature, we can observe creatures such as the bombadier beetle which can create chemical explosions, but only when defending itself.The Sleestak now fiddle with their arms and flap their jaws for no reason. Not only does Enik talk, there is now a ""head Sleestak"" who also talks - and they are all just a bunch of losers. Enik is no longer just mysterious - he's a jerk... and then there are these horrendous plot lines that are like re-hashed Star Trek episodes - no originality, just cheese.The only thing I did enjoy seeing was the tremendous improvement in acting ability with these actors, especially Kathy Coleman. She was good before, but she is so believable, even with these ridiculous stories, she should have been given other big roles on the small screen and large screen.  She was analgous to the Tina Majorino of the 90s and the Dakota Fanning of today in stellar child acting. I also appreciated how brother and sister were no longer showing themselves as competitors, but overtly showed their love and concern for one another in these episodes.The commentary and interview with Ron Harper is eye-rolling. He praises this season as the best and the direction as stellar. Did Ron do mushrooms during the filming of these shows? It was the 70s after all. Actually, he struck me as being more nostalgic and star-struck than honest about his appraisal of the shows. In at least 2 episodes where Will Marshall sings his home-spun ballads with a home-made mandolin or whatever instrument that is, and Uncle Jack looks so annoyed and disgusted - you can almost read his thought bubble, ""My agent said I would be the big star in this show. How in the hell do I get out of this contract?""The only thing, and I do mean the only thing, that would have saved this DVD set from being so awful was if every episode had a commentary track from Kathy Coleman and Wesley Eure - because you know they would be laughing their butts off at these plots. My theory is that they probably did do comment tracks, but were so inflammatory against the director of the 3rd season that Rhino cut them to prevent being sued.These are still labeled as Krofft productions, but the life in these shows are long gone. Were it not for Kathy Coleman's acting, the entire set would lose yet another star and basically be toilet worthy. Land of the Lost was awesome because of the stellar sci-fi writing, and the lackluster plot lines of the 3rd season are why the show falls on its face.  It's no wonderr that the season was cut short and this was the end - by the 2nd episode, most of the fans that were old enough, probably drank themselves into oblvion, drowning their sorrows in booze or other substances. I only vaguely remembered these shows - I think because I must have blocked them from my memory to protect the purity of the first two seasons. I cannot get over how awful these shows are, whether or not they are compared to the previous 2 seaons... even without comparisons, they do not stand up on their own.

New dinosaurs appear: a fire-breather and a two-headed fork-tongued terror. The kids discover their Uncle Jack is now trapped with them. Sounds like a promising season?Could have been but, unfortunately, wasn't. Stay away from season three. Uncle Jack wasn't very likeable and the quality of the stories (other than maybe Aftershock) was far below the writing in seasons one and two.For the Land of the Lost movie, please have Uncle Jack get crushed by a boulder during the earthquake sequence.

Only one episode was written by a returning writer.This seems to have completely changed the tone of the show. Seasons one and two are science fiction, season three seems to bear more resemblance to Gilligan's Island or Lost in Space.The approach seems to be to throw in whatever fantastic characters the writers could think of, regardless of how stupid or out of place.The third season features Medusa, a Caveman, The Flying Dutchman, The Abominable Snowman, a fire-breathing dinosaur, a two headed dinosaur and a beetle whose bite makes you evil!Logic, continuity and characterization all go out the window. Sleestak and Chaka talk, Enik does stupid things in the name of 'logic'. The only thing better in this season is the acting.The only reason to watch this season is if you want to see all the the episodes for completeness.
