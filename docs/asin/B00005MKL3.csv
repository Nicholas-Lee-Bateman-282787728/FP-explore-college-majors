""Avalanche"" features half-hearted performances, poor lighting and sound, minimal plot, ... ""special effects"" and some of the choppiest editing known to mankind.  In fact, the only thing this dud is good for is a couple of unintentionally hysterical moments.  The plot involves a newly built resort in Durango, Colorado.  The owner is warned that he is in danger of triggering an avalanche because he is cutting down a lot of trees on a hillside.  Characters are grossly underdeveloped and the film really goes nowhere.  I advise you to stay clear of this one unless you are a Roger Corman fan.",1,Typical Roger Corman fare.,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,677,"['Roger', 'Corman', 'name', 'attached', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'Avalanche', 'half-hearted', 'performances', 'poor', 'lighting', 'sound', 'minimal', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'choppiest', 'editing', 'known', 'mankind', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'dud', 'good', 'couple', 'unintentionally', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'plot', 'newly', 'built', 'resort', 'Durango', 'Colorado', 'owner', 'warned', 'danger', 'triggering', 'avalanche', 'cutting', 'down', 'lot', 'trees', 'hillside', 'Characters', 'are', 'grossly', 'underdeveloped', 'film', 'really', 'nowhere', 'advise', 'stay', 'clear', 'one', 'are', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'fan']",N/A

665801,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00005MKL3,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","The camera work was immediately off-putting and not a little distracting.  There were an overabundance of medium and close-up shots that made everything seem tight and confining.  Couple that with poor lighting (half the time one actor or another was unlit....in the same shot!), and the result is the sense that no one knew what they were doing, including the editor who sharply cut every sequence so abruptly it felt like they were pressed for time.  This was especially odd since they took all the time in the world to eventually get to the point, the avalanche.  If you like your Styrofoam on the chunky side this movie is for you.As for the actors: poor Rock Hudson came across as frantic, Mia Farrow seemed more capricious than usual, they should have let Rick Moses sing, and Jeanette Nolan did what she was best known for....BIG performances.  Only Robert Forester came across as genuine, which made him seem out of place from the rest of the hams.Best scene, trying to calm a hysterical woman with a glass of milk.Otherwise, this only serves as a primer on how NOT to make a disaster movie.",2,Sparks will fly!,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,1099,"['camera', 'work', 'was', 'immediately', 'off-putting', 'not', 'little', 'distracting', 'were', 'overabundance', 'medium', 'close-up', 'shots', 'made', 'everything', 'seem', 'tight', 'confining', 'Couple', 'poor', 'lighting', 'time', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'unlit', '.in', 'same', 'shot', 'result', 'sense', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'including', 'editor', 'who', 'sharply', 'cut', 'sequence', 'so', 'abruptly', 'felt', 'were', 'pressed', 'time', 'was', 'especially', 'odd', 'took', 'time', 'world', 'eventually', 'get', 'point', 'avalanche', 'like', 'Styrofoam', 'chunky', 'side', 'movie', 'you.As', 'actors', 'poor', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'came', 'frantic', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'seemed', 'more', 'capricious', 'usual', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'Rick', 'Moses', 'sing', 'Jeanette', 'Nolan', 'did', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'known', '.BIG', 'performances', 'Only', 'Robert', 'Forester', 'came', 'genuine', 'made', 'seem', 'place', 'rest', 'hams.Best', 'scene', 'trying', 'calm', 'hysterical', 'woman', 'glass', 'milk.Otherwise', 'only', 'primer', 'how', 'NOT', 'make', 'disaster', 'movie']",N/A
