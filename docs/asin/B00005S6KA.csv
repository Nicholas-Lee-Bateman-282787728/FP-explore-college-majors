Other than that, Daria has nothing to do with B&BH;, other than the background that the Morgendorfer family moved from Highland to Lawndale early in Daria's high school years. She retains the same dry wit and droll personality (as though everything going on around her is somehow surreal) as she had in B&BH; - its just better developed here.Both DVDs give a couple of bonus episodes from the MTV show. I wish they included more, or better yet, that the whole series could be marketed.

681121,A2XWU6Y8PF8L17,B00005S6KA,"CreepyT ""CreepyTendencies""","[47, 47]","I used to follow this show when I was in high school, and have since mourned the loss of the cable television with which to view the reruns.  My craving for cynical humor having piqued, and there being few other outlets with which to quell this craving, I was compelled to buy the two available Daria DVD's.This DVD plays out like one long (just over an hour) episode.  Is it Fall Yet? tells a story of summer hiatus from the mundane pit otherwise known as school.  However, is the summer break really much of a break from prosaic servitude?  Quinn is getting help from a tutor in hopes of raising her college entrance exam scores, Kevin and Brittney are attempting to survive as pool lifeguards, Jane is attending an artists colony that might not be all it's cracked up to be, and Daria's mother signs her up for a stint at the OK-to-Cry Corral as a counselor.  Furthermore, Daria is attempting to make sense of her relationship with Tom, her best friend Jane's ex-boyfriend (which is a conundrum in itself).  However, all will wade through their various forays into humdrum subjugation and surface having learned valuable life-lessons.In addition to the film, two bonus episodes are included.  Fire!  and Dye Dye My Darling both take place before the movie.  In Fire!, Daria's father accidentally sets fire to their home, causing the Morgendorfers to temporarily move into a hotel while repairs are made.  This is where the sparks begin to fly between Daria and Jane with regards to Tom.  In Dye Dye My Darling, Daria is forced to help Jane recognize the tiger within by streaking her hair.  When the dye job is somewhat less-than-successful, Jane views it as Daria's way of trying to break up Jane and Tom's relationship.The repartee between Daria and Jane, the sardonic humor the two exchange between one another, is absolutely smirk-inducing.  I love the dialogue in this show.  Though Quinn's friends, in addition to Kevin and Brittney, can be horribly wretched to listen to at times, one cannot deny the fact that similar personas did exist in high school, and continue to persist in the world today, if not quite to the same extreme.  Some episodes are of course better than others, but even after five years the show never got old, and I have yet to grow out of it.Anyone who is familiar with, and can appreciate, the cast of characters and all of their idiosyncrasies will find this a welcome addition to their DVD collection.  However, that does not mean that one needs to be acquainted with the series in order to appreciate the film.  As far as I know, there is no word yet on forthcoming releases of the five seasons on DVD, so I suppose fans will have to appease themselves with the two released short films and their accompanying bonus episodes for now.",5,"Dry, sardonic wit at its best!",1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,2769,"['used', 'follow', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'mourned', 'loss', 'cable', 'television', 'view', 'reruns', 'craving', 'cynical', 'humor', 'having', 'piqued', 'there', 'being', 'few', 'other', 'outlets', 'quell', 'craving', 'was', 'compelled', 'buy', 'two', 'available', 'Daria', ""DVD's.This"", 'DVD', 'out', 'one', 'long', 'just', 'hour', 'episode', 'Fall', 'Yet', 'story', 'summer', 'hiatus', 'mundane', 'pit', 'otherwise', 'known', 'school', 'However', 'summer', 'break', 'really', 'much', 'break', 'prosaic', 'servitude', 'Quinn', 'getting', 'help', 'tutor', 'hopes', 'raising', 'college', 'entrance', 'exam', 'scores', 'Kevin', 'Brittney', 'are', 'attempting', 'survive', 'pool', 'lifeguards', 'Jane', 'attending', 'artists', 'colony', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Daria', 'mother', 'signs', 'up', 'stint', 'OK-to-Cry', 'Corral', 'counselor', 'Furthermore', 'Daria', 'attempting', 'make', 'sense', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'best', 'friend', 'Jane', 'ex-boyfriend', 'conundrum', 'However', 'will', 'wade', 'various', 'forays', 'humdrum', 'subjugation', 'surface', 'having', 'learned', 'valuable', 'life-lessons.In', 'addition', 'film', 'two', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'Fire', 'Dye', 'Dye', 'My', 'Darling', 'take', 'place', 'movie', 'Fire', 'Daria', 'father', 'accidentally', 'fire', 'home', 'causing', 'Morgendorfers', 'temporarily', 'move', 'hotel', 'repairs', 'are', 'made', 'where', 'sparks', 'begin', 'fly', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'regards', 'Tom', 'Dye', 'Dye', 'My', 'Darling', 'Daria', 'forced', 'help', 'Jane', 'recognize', 'tiger', 'streaking', 'hair', 'When', 'dye', 'job', 'somewhat', 'less-than-successful', 'Jane', 'Daria', 'way', 'trying', 'break', 'up', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'relationship.The', 'repartee', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'two', 'exchange', 'one', 'absolutely', 'smirk-inducing', 'love', 'dialogue', 'show', 'Quinn', 'friends', 'addition', 'Kevin', 'Brittney', 'can', 'be', 'horribly', 'wretched', 'listen', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'fact', 'similar', 'personas', 'did', 'exist', 'high', 'school', 'continue', 'persist', 'world', 'today', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'extreme', 'episodes', 'are', 'course', 'better', 'others', 'even', 'five', 'years', 'show', 'never', 'got', 'old', 'have', 'yet', 'grow', 'it.Anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'can', 'appreciate', 'cast', 'characters', 'idiosyncrasies', 'will', 'find', 'welcome', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'However', 'not', 'mean', 'one', 'be', 'acquainted', 'series', 'order', 'appreciate', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'word', 'yet', 'forthcoming', 'releases', 'five', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'suppose', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'appease', 'two', 'released', 'short', 'films', 'accompanying', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'now']",N/A

Her mother doesn't want her sitting around all summer vacation (again, ""like last time"") so she signs her up to work at a camp with Timothy the principal and Anthony the teacher with the strange eye. LOLShe is a councelor at the camp. Timothy never lets anyone go outside and makes them stay in to do crafts. Timothy is later disappoionted when they all like ""Uncle Anthony"" better than him.Daria becomes close with a boy who hates summer like she does. He later thinks that Timothy told her to talk to him and gets mad at her. You'll have to see the movie to find out how that works out :)Of course it contains everyone's fav characters like Brittany & Kevin, and of course the famous Fashion club with Quinn, Sandy, Stacey, & Tiffany.Quinn is being tutored over the summer, and the rest of the club decides to too. That doesn't work out well though, LOLQuinn ends up being the only one of them still being tutored, There is more controversy with this, but I don't wanna give too much more away :).THE DVD also contains two bonus episodes that aired right before the movie was on TV. I recommend watching the two episodes IN ORDER before watching the movie. Just to refresh your memory.And of course in THE MOVIE Jane Lane is still upset with Daria over the whole Tom thing (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you should DEFINATELY watch the episodes first!

I knew OF her, I knew she existed in the same universe as Beavis & Butthead - and now I know also the same universe as King Of The Hill. I haven't watched the former, and I've seen random episodes of the latter.Along with Welcome To The Dollhouse, Daria falls into the ""makes-me-want-to-slit-my-wrists"" category. I was thoroughly depressed after watching Welcome To The Dollhouse, and was slightly less depressed after watching Daria. All the school stuff freaks me out a bit. I try to cover it up, but it really upsets me, and it's not good. Then I started seeing myself in Daria, as most people probably will. There's something about Daria that makes her similar to most people, or most people can identify with some aspect of her personality.High school affects different people in different ways. For me, it wasn't a good period of my life. I'm still haunted by it, despite being out of school for a few years now. And the night after watching this, I came across a high school photo that I hadn't ripped up yet. (That bad? Yeah.) It's now well hidden. Unlike Daria, I didn't have a ultra cool best friend, I wasn't that sarcastic, or deadpan, and I didn't have a sister. Boo.Daria, with its cast of unknown voices (they'd all be well known if it was remade), and kooky characters, is totally different from everything else I'd ever seen. In a good way, it was a overlong TV episode, but didn't feel cut into three different episodes, unlike some TV shows-turned-movies, and the time simply flew by watching it. In a bad way, it will remind people of people from high school, or stuff in general from that period of your lives. For me, it turned out to be one of the most depressing things I've watched, but I did find myself enjoying it tremendously, and even smiling at some points.I don't think it would be a TV show I could ever get into (possibly?), but if you see it for cheap, I would definitely pick it up.

681128,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B00005S6KA,Wendy C. Rigney,"[0, 0]","Right there, the opening line on the back of this DVD, tells you ""Daria"" does not break from her snark just because she is not subjected to the daily annoyances and humiliation at Lawndale High. Nope. But that does not preclude her brand of cynicism from being shared elsewhere! This happens when her mother, Helen, deciding that Daria will not sit around all Summer, has ""volunteered"" Daria's dubious services at a summer camp for sensitive kids. Along for the ""fun"" is overly-emo English teacher Mr. O'Neill and sanity-hanging-by-a-thread history teacher, Mr. DeMartino. This leads to restless campers stuck indoors while Mr. O'Neill wants to do his usual self esteem schtick, last seen in detail in the first episode Esteemsters. Thankfully for them, ""Uncle Anthony"", as Mr. DeMartino is dubbed by the kids, takes matters into his own hands via a homage to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and liberates himself and the kids to have some fun. And all is great - except for Daria and an alienated boy named Link, who hates the world...much like Daria sometimes does. Daria tries - in her way - to reach out, without success. Or so she thinks. This leads her to question opening herself up to other people.Of course, it may be just as well that Daria has that time at camp, as her relationship with best friend, Jane Lane, has hit a rather rough patch. This, naturally, is due to preceding events in the 4th season, when Jane's boyfriend, Tom Sloane, found himself attracted to Daria - and acted on it with a kiss. The matter got even murkier when Daria must have decided she liked it, since she, too, kissed Tom back. Of course, despite the point that the relationship between Jane and Tom had been in a downward spiral before this, Jane was understandably hurt and betrayed. So, while Daria was at camp, Jane made her own plans.Jane ends up at a sort of avant garde art retreat/art colony, where she seems to go from the frying pan with Daria/Tom into the fire when she meets a fellow artist named Allison, voiced by punk rocker chick Bif Naked, leading Jane to question her sexual identity and realizing that some people are out for themselves. Of note, one of the instructors/artists is voiced by Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters fame.Speaking of guest voices, Carson Daly also lends his vocal cords as David. David has the unenviable task of playing tutor to the girls of the Fashion Club, to raise their dismal PSAT scores, with disastrous results...until he gets to Quinn. Quinn ends up surprising even herself when she begins to take her studies seriously. Of course, Quinn being Quinn, she also develops a somewhat surprising crush on her tutor. Surprising because, unlike those that Quinn likes to tease, he is not conventionally ""cute"" by her criteria. Ironically, his reaction to Quinn's budding affection only helps her growth and shows that Quinn may be just a tad more like her sister than she thought, i.e. not totally without insight and depth - and by the end of the movie, leads to better understanding between Daria and Quinn, with their mother using Daria's own words of advice to her sister as a tool to give dating Tom a serious try, and not dismiss him due to Daria's prejudice about his family.As if that weren't enough, we also see the very hapless Kevin and Brittany playing lifeguards at a local neighborhood pool with expectedly horrible results, Mack driving an ice cream truck to repay a loan from his father, Jodie swamped with ""volunteer"" work (her parents push her to do so) in a soup kitchen and helping various local officials, and Kevin and Brittany eventually ending up in Mack's place, delighting the kids. Watch the DVD to find out why.Add in Trent taking matters into his own hands and helping Jane and Daria to reconcile while his band ""Mystik Spiral"" has a gig, and the movie has the requisite ""All's Well That Ends Well"" scenario, complete with Jane encouraging Daria to give Tom a chance, leading Tom and Daria to a close moment at the end with the decision to date.Heck, even Helen and Jake have a little fun!There is also bonus material, the two prior episodes before IIFY, ""Fire!"" and ""Dye! Dye! My Darling"", bringing viewers up to speed with pertinent events that dominate the film. Of note, however, the music in these episodes has sadly been altered, either with generic music or downright silence. But it is still worth watching.Also, unlike the other DVD of ""Is It College Yet?"" which was inexplicably edited, ""Is It Fall Yet?"" is the broadcast version from August 2000.If you love ""Daria"", buy this! Or...wait for the Complete Set due out on May 11th: Both movies will be included, as well.",5,To quote the DVD: It's Summertime and the Living Is Hell!,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,4640,"['Right', 'there', 'opening', 'line', 'back', 'DVD', 'Daria', 'not', 'break', 'snark', 'just', 'not', 'subjected', 'daily', 'annoyances', 'humiliation', 'Lawndale', 'High', 'Nope', 'not', 'preclude', 'brand', 'cynicism', 'being', 'shared', 'elsewhere', 'when', 'mother', 'Helen', 'deciding', 'Daria', 'will', 'not', 'sit', 'Summer', 'volunteered', 'Daria', 'dubious', 'services', 'summer', 'camp', 'sensitive', 'kids', 'fun', 'overly-emo', 'English', 'teacher', 'Mr.', ""O'Neill"", 'sanity-hanging-by-a-thread', 'history', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'DeMartino', 'restless', 'campers', 'stuck', 'indoors', 'Mr.', ""O'Neill"", 'do', 'usual', 'self', 'esteem', 'schtick', 'last', 'seen', 'detail', 'first', 'episode', 'Esteemsters', 'Thankfully', 'Uncle', 'Anthony', 'Mr.', 'DeMartino', 'dubbed', 'kids', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'homage', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'kids', 'have', 'fun', 'great', 'Daria', 'alienated', 'boy', 'named', 'Link', 'who', 'world', 'much', 'Daria', 'sometimes', 'Daria', 'way', 'reach', 'out', 'success', 'so', 'question', 'opening', 'other', 'people.Of', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Daria', 'time', 'camp', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend', 'Jane', 'Lane', 'hit', 'rather', 'rough', 'patch', 'naturally', 'due', 'preceding', 'events', '4th', 'season', 'when', 'Jane', 'boyfriend', 'Tom', 'Sloane', 'found', 'attracted', 'Daria', 'acted', 'kiss', 'matter', 'got', 'even', 'murkier', 'when', 'Daria', 'must', 'have', 'decided', 'liked', 'too', 'kissed', 'Tom', 'back', 'course', 'point', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'had', 'been', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Jane', 'was', 'understandably', 'hurt', 'betrayed', 'So', 'Daria', 'was', 'camp', 'Jane', 'made', 'own', 'plans.Jane', 'up', 'sort', 'avant', 'garde', 'art', 'retreat/art', 'colony', 'where', 'go', 'frying', 'pan', 'Daria/Tom', 'fire', 'when', 'fellow', 'artist', 'named', 'Allison', 'voiced', 'punk', 'rocker', 'chick', 'Bif', 'Naked', 'leading', 'Jane', 'question', 'sexual', 'identity', 'realizing', 'people', 'are', 'out', 'note', 'one', 'instructors/artists', 'voiced', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'Foo', 'Fighters', 'fame.Speaking', 'guest', 'voices', 'Carson', 'Daly', 'also', 'vocal', 'cords', 'David', 'David', 'unenviable', 'task', 'playing', 'tutor', 'girls', 'Fashion', 'Club', 'raise', 'dismal', 'PSAT', 'scores', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Quinn', 'Quinn', 'up', 'surprising', 'even', 'when', 'take', 'studies', 'seriously', 'course', 'Quinn', 'being', 'Quinn', 'also', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'crush', 'tutor', 'Surprising', 'Quinn', 'tease', 'not', 'conventionally', 'cute', 'criteria', 'Ironically', 'reaction', 'Quinn', 'budding', 'affection', 'only', 'growth', 'Quinn', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'sister', 'thought', 'i.e', 'not', 'totally', 'insight', 'depth', 'end', 'movie', 'better', 'understanding', 'Daria', 'Quinn', 'mother', 'using', 'Daria', 'own', 'words', 'advice', 'sister', 'tool', 'give', 'dating', 'Tom', 'serious', 'try', 'not', 'dismiss', 'due', 'Daria', 'prejudice', 'family.As', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'also', 'see', 'very', 'hapless', 'Kevin', 'Brittany', 'playing', 'lifeguards', 'local', 'neighborhood', 'pool', 'expectedly', 'horrible', 'results', 'Mack', 'driving', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'repay', 'loan', 'father', 'Jodie', 'swamped', 'volunteer', 'work', 'parents', 'push', 'do', 'so', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'helping', 'various', 'local', 'officials', 'Kevin', 'Brittany', 'eventually', 'ending', 'up', 'Mack', 'place', 'delighting', 'kids', 'Watch', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'why.Add', 'Trent', 'taking', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'helping', 'Jane', 'Daria', 'reconcile', 'band', 'Mystik', 'Spiral', 'gig', 'movie', 'requisite', 'Well', 'That', 'Well', 'scenario', 'complete', 'Jane', 'encouraging', 'Daria', 'give', 'Tom', 'chance', 'leading', 'Tom', 'Daria', 'close', 'moment', 'end', 'decision', 'date.Heck', 'even', 'Helen', 'Jake', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'also', 'bonus', 'material', 'two', 'prior', 'episodes', 'IIFY', 'Fire', 'Dye', 'Dye', 'Darling', 'bringing', 'viewers', 'up', 'speed', 'pertinent', 'events', 'dominate', 'film', 'note', 'however', 'music', 'episodes', 'sadly', 'been', 'altered', 'either', 'generic', 'music', 'downright', 'silence', 'still', 'worth', 'watching.Also', 'other', 'DVD', 'College', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'edited', 'Fall', 'Yet', 'broadcast', 'version', 'August', '2000.If', 'love', 'Daria', 'buy', 'wait', 'Complete', 'Set', 'due', 'May', '11th', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'as', 'well']",N/A
681129,A1MVLTJ0KUNCIU,B00005S6KA,"Yvonne P. Joseph ""Yvonne Joseph""","[3, 3]","I saw the preview of this cartoon on Netflix. Seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach (minus Daria, who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions), I knew I had to buy this. And I love it!""Is It Fall Yet?"" deals with the main characters' experiences during Summer vacation. The highlight: ""The Tom Thing"" -as Trent Lane, Jane's musician brother, nicely puts it.  Daria and Tom have fallen in love, and are dating.  Tom and Jane have broken up.  This situation dents the friendship of Daria and Jane.The two bonus episodes on the dvd (""Fire"" and ""Dye! Dye, My Darling!"")  show how ""The Tom Thing"" happened.  It's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes FIRST as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of Daria, Jane and Tom that is carried over into the movie.Adding to Daria's anguish, her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `OK-to-Cry Corral' summer camp.  Working with her are her teachers, dorky Mr. O'Neill and Anthony DeMartino (with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he's very irritated).The other `Daria' characters have their own situations.  Lovelorn Jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that's out of Lawndale.  Dim-witted lovers Kevin and Brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool.  They only have eyes for each other... and I won't go further than that.  Watch the movie, and see for yourselves!  Daria's spoiled brat sister Quinn and her `Fashion Club' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their PSAT exams.  (How I remember my high school days!  I was a Junior when I took my PSAT exam - and passed it!)  Lead `Fashion Club' member Sandi (with the deep voice) reminds me so much of Khan from Mike Judge's ""King of the Hill"" series.  Like Khan, Sandi is often sullen-expressioned, and complains a lot!Mack and Jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues'.  Mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor, in a truck, and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream.  His girlfriend Jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office, and is up to her neck in work.  The pair doesn't have time to date.I love the opening 'beach' number with the `Daria' cast frolicking on the beach... and with Daria not participating, of course. It is reminiscent of the ""Beach Blanket"" 1960's movies with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Jane, too, is seen isolated on another part of the beach, painting. Her isolation gives proof of her rift with Daria.  The song ""Turn the Sun Down"", sung by the female band Splendora (who provide the theme song for `Daria'), is playfully catchy! Splendora sounds like the female version of the Beach Boys. The 'beach' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk, with the frolickers still dancing...followed, in a dissolve, by the ""Daria"" logo in a similar 'dusk' color, with the film's title; and Splendora's melodic singing as the song concludes. This is a nice effect.Another nice effect is in the dvd's Main Menu, with a scene taken from the opening of the `Daria' t.v. series.  A somber Daria is at the movies.  Her fellow moviegoers, surrounding her, are laughing at the scenes from the opening `Beach' segment. ""Turn the Sun Down"" is played in the background.At the film's end, there are `Outtakes', which are cute and amusing involving the `Daria' cast.  There are a few gross outtakes also included.""Is It Fall Yet?"" got me interested in the ""Daria"" t.v. series.  To admit, Daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on Beavis and Butt-Head"".  I purchased her ""Daria Diaries"" and ""Daria Databases"" books to help me get to know the Lawndale characters.  I'm presently reading her `Diaries'.  And I, too, hope that the complete ""Daria"" series gets released on dvd in the very near future.But treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at Lawndale with ""Is It Fall Yet?""  And savor Daria's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes.  A little girl in the film asks camp counselor Daria ""Do you ever smile??""The answer is Yes!  And this movie is sure to make you smile.  It's a gem in the ""Daria"" series!",5,"""Turn the Sun Down"": Teen summer fun cartoon with Daria.",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,4247,"['saw', 'preview', 'cartoon', 'Netflix', 'Seeing', 'teen', 'characters', 'dancing', 'having', 'fun', 'beach', 'Daria', 'who', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'interruptions', 'knew', 'had', 'buy', 'love', 'Fall', 'Yet', 'main', 'characters', 'experiences', 'Summer', 'vacation', 'highlight', 'Tom', 'Thing', '-as', 'Trent', 'Lane', 'Jane', 'musician', 'brother', 'nicely', 'Daria', 'Tom', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'are', 'dating', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'situation', 'friendship', 'Daria', 'Jane.The', 'two', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'dvd', 'Fire', 'Dye', 'Dye', 'My', 'Darling', 'show', 'how', 'Tom', 'Thing', 'happened', 'recommended', 'watch', 'two', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'FIRST', 'lead', 'up', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'love', 'triangle', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'carried', 'movie.Adding', 'Daria', 'anguish', 'mother', 'be', 'camp', 'counselor', 'OK-to-Cry', 'Corral', 'summer', 'camp', 'Working', 'are', 'teachers', 'Mr.', ""O'Neill"", 'Anthony', 'DeMartino', 'trademark', 'bloodshot', 'eyeball', 'when', 'very', 'irritated', 'other', 'Daria', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'situations', 'Lovelorn', 'Jane', 'bohemian', 'artist', 'retreat', 'Lawndale', 'Dim-witted', 'lovers', 'Kevin', 'Brittany', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'work', 'lifeguards', 'local', 'pool', 'only', 'have', 'eyes', 'other', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'Watch', 'movie', 'see', 'yourselves', 'Daria', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'sister', 'Quinn', 'Fashion', 'Club', 'gal', 'pals', 'get', 'tutored', 'due', 'low', 'scores', 'PSAT', 'exams', 'How', 'remember', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'was', 'Junior', 'when', 'took', 'PSAT', 'exam', 'passed', 'Lead', 'Fashion', 'Club', 'member', 'Sandi', 'deep', 'voice', 'so', 'much', 'Khan', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'King', 'Hill', 'series', 'Khan', 'Sandi', 'often', 'sullen-expressioned', 'lot', 'Mack', 'Jodie', 'also', 'have', 'share', 'summertime', 'blues', 'Mack', 'job', 'ice-cream', 'vendor', 'truck', 'put', 'up', 'bratty', 'kids', 'who', 'aggravate', 'buy', 'ice', 'cream', 'girlfriend', 'Jodie', 'share', 'difficulties', 'office', 'up', 'neck', 'work', 'pair', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'date.I', 'love', 'opening', ""'beach"", 'number', 'Daria', 'cast', 'frolicking', 'beach', 'Daria', 'not', 'participating', 'course', 'reminiscent', 'Beach', 'Blanket', '1960', 'movies', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'Jane', 'too', 'seen', 'isolated', 'part', 'beach', 'painting', 'isolation', 'proof', 'rift', 'Daria', 'song', 'Turn', 'Sun', 'Down', 'sung', 'female', 'band', 'Splendora', 'who', 'provide', 'theme', 'song', 'Daria', 'playfully', 'catchy', 'Splendora', 'female', 'version', 'Beach', 'Boys', ""'beach"", 'segment', 'concludes', 'sun', 'going', 'down', 'beach', 'dusk', 'frolickers', 'still', 'dancing', 'followed', 'dissolve', 'Daria', 'logo', 'similar', ""'dusk"", 'color', 'film', 'title', 'Splendora', 'melodic', 'singing', 'song', 'nice', 'effect.Another', 'nice', 'effect', 'dvd', 'Main', 'Menu', 'scene', 'taken', 'opening', 'Daria', 't.v', 'series', 'somber', 'Daria', 'movies', 'fellow', 'moviegoers', 'surrounding', 'are', 'laughing', 'scenes', 'opening', 'Beach', 'segment', 'Turn', 'Sun', 'Down', 'played', 'background.At', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'Outtakes', 'are', 'cute', 'amusing', 'involving', 'Daria', 'cast', 'are', 'few', 'gross', 'outtakes', 'also', 'included', 'Fall', 'Yet', 'got', 'interested', 'Daria', 't.v', 'series', 'admit', 'Daria', 'much', 'nicer', 'own', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'Beavis', 'Butt-Head', 'purchased', 'Daria', 'Diaries', 'Daria', 'Databases', 'books', 'help', 'get', 'know', 'Lawndale', 'characters', ""'m"", 'presently', 'reading', 'Diaries', 'too', 'hope', 'complete', 'Daria', 'series', 'released', 'dvd', 'very', 'future.But', 'treat', 'interesting', 'summer', 'experiences', 'as', 'well', 'summer', 'fun', 'Lawndale', 'Fall', 'Yet', 'savor', 'Daria', 'sweet', 'smile', 'near-conclusion', 'opening', 'sequence', 'two', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'little', 'girl', 'film', 'camp', 'counselor', 'Daria', 'Do', 'ever', 'smile', 'answer', 'Yes', 'movie', 'sure', 'make', 'smile', 'gem', 'Daria', 'series']",N/A
