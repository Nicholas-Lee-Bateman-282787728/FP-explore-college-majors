Jackson, a blue haired punk rock loving hipster is so cool he throws people out of the record store he works at for listening to Madonna.  Oh yeah, and he rolls around on his skate board while working and putting up cds---oooohh...he's just so cool!  This uneven story centers around Jackson trying to find love or discover if he is capable of love.  It starts when he wakes up from an orgy of mingled male and female bodies and continues as he has desire for his newly arrived cousin, Jed, and captures the attention (God know's why) of a preppy looking customer at the record shop.  There is also Sam, his boss and best friend who also loves him.

778300,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B0000DD75T,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","It seems an injustice to me that the reviews on Amazon WWW sites overall rate ""Luster"" (on DVD in Canada and in the U. S. of A. as T.L.A. Releasing TLAD-054) so low. I found it wonderfully original, the characters believable, not mere gay stereotypes. Best of all, the acting is incredibly good, by any kind of standard (whether major studio, independent, or gay activist). There is a marvellous sincerity and realism to the characters, whose movements, facial expressions, and delivery of their lines are astonishingly (and gratifyingly) natural. The persons in the film about whom Everett Lewis, the director, cares most deeply he also depicts sympathetically, but also, frequently, with wry but gently affectionate humour, which manifests itself pervasively but somewhat unobtrusively in their situations, motions, actions, and dialogue more often than in overt jokes; this humour seems lost, alas, on many viewers of Lewis` movie. Other characters are such outright caricatures (the rock musician, the fatuous book-signing author, various customers of the record store, some others), and very amusing ones at that; complaining perversely that suchlike are not ""realistic"" is irrelevant to Lewis` obvious purpose to parody them more roughly. Most small budget gay films (and Lewis produced this movie, too, on limited means), by contrast to ""Luster"", end up having the aura merely of gay television ""sitcoms"".The two characters who appear naked, often full frontally (genitalia and all), the most frequently in this film, are the cousins, Jed (B. Wyatt) and Jackson (Justin Herwick); each is good-looking in his own unusual and individually appealing way and both act without any kind of evident self-conscious nervousness or embarassment when they are being filmed ""in the buff""; this is so, too, of the role of the S&M-loving; Billy Jonah Blechman), who also is nude quite often (but whose genitals never quite are in view, as Wyatt`s and Herwick`s are so vividly). The ending of the film where Jackson (Herwick) strips naked outdoors and fervently offers himself, leanly lanky body as well as soul, to Derek (played by Sean Thivodeau), who had been trying so hard to convince Jackson to accept him as lover, is wonderfully evocative and emotionally forceful, yet delicately nuanced for all of Jackson`s (Herwick`s) sun-drenched nakedness of that moment. Despite so much  nudity in the film, it is by no means merely gratuitous and certainly not pornographic. All of the cast are world-class actors, however little-known most of them are in the wider world of cinema.The smallness of the movie`s budget does not, either, result in cramped sets (which are foresworn here for use instead of location filming) or in any inadequate use of the real-life outdoors scenery, cityscapes, store and bar settings, and so forth for which the director, Everett Lewis, opts. There really is no sense of restriction; the artistry and cleverness of camera technic conveys a large scale, not cramped space (even, usually, in the various bathroom settings). Camera work maximised with what the director and crews had at their disposal to work.The more attentive and even favourable reviews have described the film and its story fairly well, but, alas, the praise in the Amazon WWW reviews which this film merits is in short supply.

But long after I sent the movie back, I was thinking about it and so I rented it again.If you can overlook a few flaws in the form of narrated ""poetry,"" unnecessary and unsubstantiated plot twists, and a grisly, amateurish sound track, there is some substance here to appreciate.The actors are decent, the story is decent, and the main character physically and mentally wrestles with his feelings of affection and love for others.  He states that he feels like he is in love with about 20 people a day, and that is the majority of the basis for this film and its examination of love in its various forms.Most notably, this film takes place in a world that is mostly, if not totally gay, and the sexuality of the characters is never an issue. This leaves lots of room for the twenty-something angst of confusing feelings and the search for the ""true"" or real love (apart from simply lust.)This is certainly an independent film with some rough edges, but it's edgy to a fault and daring and generally successful as it follows one man's path as he searches for love (mostly while it's all around him.)",4,"A Little Uneven, But Sorta Charming",1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,1221,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'disappointed', 'loopy', 'story', 'irritating', 'poetry', 'interspersed', 'dialog', 'long', 'sent', 'movie', 'back', 'was', 'thinking', 'so', 'rented', 'can', 'overlook', 'few', 'flaws', 'form', 'narrated', 'poetry', 'unnecessary', 'unsubstantiated', 'plot', 'twists', 'grisly', 'amateurish', 'sound', 'track', 'substance', 'here', 'appreciate.The', 'actors', 'are', 'decent', 'story', 'decent', 'main', 'character', 'physically', 'mentally', 'wrestles', 'feelings', 'affection', 'love', 'others', 'love', '20', 'people', 'day', 'majority', 'basis', 'film', 'examination', 'love', 'various', 'forms.Most', 'notably', 'film', 'place', 'world', 'mostly', 'not', 'totally', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'characters', 'never', 'issue', 'lots', 'room', 'twenty-something', 'angst', 'confusing', 'feelings', 'search', 'true', 'real', 'love', 'apart', 'simply', 'lust', 'certainly', 'independent', 'film', 'rough', 'edges', 'edgy', 'fault', 'daring', 'generally', 'successful', 'one', 'man', 'path', 'love', 'mostly']",N/A

""Luster"" was the last of the bunch and thank we waited.  I had no expectations of this film and, indeed the acting overall was quite good, but that's the reason for the first star.I found this film horribly confusing, slow and mediocre.  Jackson, our protagonist, works in a independent record store selling all sorts of weird and wonderful music as well as the mainstream stuff and he tools around the aisles on a skateboard and yells at customers of whose music taste he doesn't approve.He's woken up at an orgy, and decided he's in love with Billy, a participant, and tracks him down.  Unfortunatly, Billy is basically the sex toy/slave of a musician and doesn't want anything to do with Jackson.Enter Derek, a straight-laced gay guy who fell for Jackson at first sight and tells him so, but whom Jackson find too ""boring.""Then add in a cousin from Iowa, Jed, who's tortured by Billy and handcuffed in the shower.  Jackson asks his boss and best friend Sam if it's incest to have sex with your male cousin (duh!).Of course, Jackson and Derek end up together, but not after Sam dies, presumably from suicide, because he ""cares"" too much about Jackson.The trouble with this film really is that everything that I wanted to see happened off camera or in the dark.  The film would have been grittier and harsher and more realistic if we'd *seen* the sex, the ""lust"", instead of just hearing noises.I got sick of the ""poetry"" after the first ten minutes, which seemed to me to be kind of drunken philosophy rather than poetry.And yet, I had to see this film out.

778306,A224BKBLXVA859,B0000DD75T,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","The movie is fairly determined to capture the queer punk scene in Los Angeles at the time - hence the blue hair, the quirky characters and of course the music. And it seems like every other character has to explore some other aspect of the eclectic art scene whether it's Alyssa's (Pamela Gidley) photography, or Jackson's poetry and song-writing or Sonny Spike being a douche. Okay, maybe not so much the last point.But with the number of characters involved and the interconnecting story lines, the movie does get rather dizzying at times. The writer / director behind it got a tad too ambitious I feel given all that he wanted to accomplish, or perhaps he just didn't have the directing skills to execute his visions clearly. And as tricky as it was to keep track of everyone, but at the same you can't help but feel some of the stories weren't even all that essential to the core story.And yeah, I don't quite get the need to have Billy (Jonah Blechman) become a major BSDM freak or why Jackson has to profess love at first sight for him either. But that's just the way the story goes.The movie features a lot of nudity (including male frontal nudity - this is a gay movie after all), but a lot of it isn't all that sexual in nature. Plus in comparison, Jed is probably the hottest guy unless you like twinky Jackson, so don't expect too many sexual thrills throughout the movie.On the whole, Luster is a quirky adventure into a rather niche sub-culture of the LGBT scene - that being queer punk. That in itself does not make the movie good or bad, but the lack of clearer vision on the part of the director (less is more after all) hampered the movie's focus and its ability to tell a good story.",2,It Helps To Be High To Enjoy This Movie,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1701,"['movie', 'fairly', 'determined', 'capture', 'queer', 'punk', 'scene', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'hence', 'blue', 'hair', 'quirky', 'characters', 'course', 'music', 'other', 'character', 'explore', 'other', 'aspect', 'eclectic', 'art', 'scene', 'Alyssa', 'Pamela', 'Gidley', 'photography', 'Jackson', 'poetry', 'song-writing', 'Sonny', 'Spike', 'being', 'douche', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'last', 'point.But', 'number', 'characters', 'involved', 'interconnecting', 'story', 'lines', 'movie', 'get', 'rather', 'dizzying', 'times', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'got', 'tad', 'too', 'ambitious', 'feel', 'given', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'perhaps', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'directing', 'skills', 'execute', 'visions', 'clearly', 'as', 'tricky', 'was', 'keep', 'track', 'everyone', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'essential', 'core', 'story.And', 'yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'need', 'have', 'Billy', 'Jonah', 'Blechman', 'become', 'major', 'BSDM', 'freak', 'why', 'Jackson', 'profess', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'just', 'way', 'story', 'goes.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'nudity', 'including', 'male', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'gay', 'movie', 'lot', ""n't"", 'sexual', 'nature', 'comparison', 'Jed', 'probably', 'hottest', 'guy', 'like', 'twinky', 'Jackson', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'sexual', 'thrills', 'movie.On', 'whole', 'Luster', 'quirky', 'adventure', 'rather', 'niche', 'sub-culture', 'LGBT', 'scene', 'being', 'queer', 'punk', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'lack', 'clearer', 'vision', 'part', 'director', 'less', 'more', 'hampered', 'movie', 'focus', 'ability', 'tell', 'good', 'story']",N/A

From the opening scene, we know just where this film is going, each turn foreshadowed without being ominous or heavy-handed.  So we empathize with the characters as they stumble forward, having the advantage of knowing where they are heading which gives this movie a kind of warm predictable feeling despite the many seemingly insatiable appetites.

What a huge disappointment. The film is completely self-aware and self-conscious in trying to be hip and cool and cutting edge. For a film released in 2000, it is none of the above. It took me a while to realize I wasn't watching a film set in an 80's punk-lite scene. The acting was mediocre, the script was purposely vague (was that trying to be atmospheric, moody, or avante garde?), the cinematography was trying too hard to be gritty. And poor Willie Garson. How embarassing for him in a cliched role he walked through. I can't recommend enough that you avoid this movie. I watched the whole thing looking for signs of &quot;fun&quot; &quot;refreshing&quot; &quot;sexy&quot;. It was really kind of sad and pathetic, with characters who were so full of themselves, I couldn't care less about the bad things that happened to them. It was just plain dirty, and not in the good way. I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. It's not that I didn't understand the film. I understood it too well. Maybe if it really was organic and earthy and real instead of trying hard to be those things, it might have worked. As it is, it may seem cool to people with limited perspectives. But if you're looking for something new or with an edge, this isn't it. In its attempt to be something original, it just became a bad version of more of the same, with bad haircuts.",1,"You can keep pulling this review, & I'll keep re-posting it",1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,1484,"['ordered', 'dvd', 'reading', 'editorial', 'comments', 'as', 'well', 'customer', 'reviews', 'Also', 'was', 'recommended', 'Amazon', 'What', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'film', 'completely', 'self-aware', 'self-conscious', 'trying', 'be', 'hip', 'cool', 'cutting', 'edge', 'film', 'released', '2000', 'none', 'above', 'took', 'while', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'watching', 'film', 'set', '80', 'punk-lite', 'scene', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'script', 'was', 'purposely', 'vague', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'atmospheric', 'moody', 'avante', 'garde', 'cinematography', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'gritty', 'poor', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'How', 'embarassing', 'cliched', 'role', 'walked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough', 'avoid', 'movie', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'looking', 'signs', 'quot', 'fun', 'quot', 'quot', 'refreshing', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'really', 'kind', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'full', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'dirty', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'felt', 'needed', 'shower', 'afterwards', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'film', 'understood', 'too', 'well', 'Maybe', 'really', 'was', 'organic', 'earthy', 'real', 'instead', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'may', 'seem', 'cool', 'people', 'limited', 'perspectives', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'edge', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'be', 'something', 'original', 'just', 'became', 'bad', 'version', 'more', 'same', 'bad', 'haircuts']",N/A
