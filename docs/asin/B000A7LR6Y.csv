923377,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B000A7LR6Y,Bitcetc,"[3, 6]","Two topics of conversation arise immediately from this movie festival darling: the facts that Frankie Wilde is not an actual person, while Pete Tong (Cockney for ""gone wrong"") is real; and the brilliant performance of Paul Kaye as that ""giant among geniuses"", DJ Frankie Wilde. Kaye gives a very, very good performance. Director Michael Dowse has shot a good little movie on digital, with real artistic feel.It's a small movie, and will stay a small movie, is my bet. I don't think it's going to catch on as some kind of general audience ""sleeper"" hit, except among those who find the DJ club scene wildly entertaining; the movie is too raw and too audience-specific. It certainly makes a mountain of the ""mockumentary"" film, although instead of a ""molehill"", there's a ""coke badger hill"", the largest amount of cocaine I've ever seen depicted for one individual's use in a film.The first part of the film is an amazing portrait of someone functioning on some animal level, out of his head on drugs, alcohol, the music club scene, and fast-lane living, without benefit of connection to his rational brain. It wasn't, for me, a pretty picture of that scene, although set in beautiful Ibiza, Spain. Wilde is wildly successful, but toxed to the max. Too much hard living and hard music, plus a congenital predisposition, render him deaf.However, if only as a set up for one of the funniest politically incorrect one-liners in film, every bit of that first half was worth it.The second half of the movie, which has been described by other critics who liked the hardness of the first half as ""too soft"", was the far more contemplative part of the movie. Freddie rages and rebels against his deafness, retreats into despair, then cleans up, hoists himself up and off to a speech therapist, and begins to listen for some resonance in his life. The tabloid reports contrasted with scenes of his life as he makes his comeback are hilarious.I hope that a soundtrack will be released in the US, despite initial reports to the contrary. (If you liked this movie, I highly recommend ""Rory O'Shea Was Here"", alternatively titled ""Inside I'm Dancing"", a better movie, soon out on DVD.) Overall, I liked ""It's All Gone"", but wasn't ""blown away"". Much of our preview audience was pretty enthusiastic afterward.

923378,A2SQHMJ5SR992U,B000A7LR6Y,Brian,"[6, 6]","There isn't too much left to say about this movie that hasn't already been written in previous reviews.  Having any type of involvement in the electronic dance music (edm) scene will help you understand the basis of the film but it is not a prerequisite for grasping the main idea.  The movies starts by actually mocking the status of superstar dj's in the edm/club/rave scene.  The main character is extremely arrogant and egotistical, but that doesn't change the fact that he is one of the most amazing dj's the world has ever scene.  When he loses his hearing, you really start to empathize with the character, who by the way is played brilliantly by Paul Kaye.  I found myself asking:  Could I do my job if I lost the main things I needed to do it?  Could I even move on with my life enough to get to that point?  Could anyone?  Frankie is a character that you will probably dislike at the beginning of the film, but at the end you will be cheering for him.  The mockumentary really seems like a true story, especially with the brief interviews of some of the world's most famous dj's such as Paul Van Dyke, Tiesto, and Carl Cox saying how great the man's dj'ing is.  This is supposed to be a comedy, but it is a rather tragic one at that.  There are parts you will laugh at, and parts that will make you want to cry.  At the end of the movie though, your perspective on humanity will be altered, and that's what makes for truly great art.",5,A surprisingly brilliant and inspirational film,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,1443,"[""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'left', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'written', 'previous', 'reviews', 'Having', 'type', 'involvement', 'electronic', 'dance', 'music', 'edm', 'scene', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'basis', 'film', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'grasping', 'main', 'idea', 'movies', 'starts', 'actually', 'mocking', 'status', 'superstar', 'dj', 'edm/club/rave', 'scene', 'main', 'character', 'extremely', 'arrogant', 'egotistical', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'dj', 'world', 'ever', 'scene', 'When', 'hearing', 'really', 'start', 'empathize', 'character', 'who', 'way', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Paul', 'Kaye', 'found', 'asking', 'Could', 'do', 'job', 'lost', 'main', 'things', 'needed', 'do', 'Could', 'even', 'move', 'life', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'Could', 'anyone', 'Frankie', 'character', 'will', 'probably', 'dislike', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'cheering', 'mockumentary', 'really', 'true', 'story', 'especially', 'brief', 'interviews', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'dj', 'such', 'Paul', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Tiesto', 'Carl', 'Cox', 'saying', 'how', 'great', 'man', ""dj'ing"", 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'rather', 'tragic', 'one', 'are', 'parts', 'will', 'laugh', 'parts', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'cry', 'end', 'movie', 'perspective', 'humanity', 'will', 'be', 'altered', 'what', 'truly', 'great', 'art']",It's All Gone Pete Tong

923381,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000A7LR6Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[21, 21]","It's All Gone Pete Tong is really a rather extraordinary motion picture that has all the earmarks of a cult indie sensation.  I guess we should cover a couple of things right off the bat, however.  Who is Pete Tong, you ask?  Well, he's a DJ, and he is in this movie - but only for a few moments.  You see, this movie isn't about Pete Tong at all.  It is actually about Frankie Wilde, a wildly successful DJ (and I mean DJ as in music-mixing genius and not ""and that was the latest hit from so-and-so, and it's 52 degrees here at 5:00 on a busy traffic day"" radio voice) who overcame the tragedy of deafness to make a huge and mysterious comeback.  These movie fellows do a great job of making this mockumentary appear to be a real-life biopic, but Frankie Wilde and his incredible story are purely fictional.  That fact doesn't really change anything, though, as this is still an inspirational film that will surely captivate you.It's an oddly powerful story built around a less than likeable fellow who eventually wins you over with his intense suffering and his courageous efforts to finally put his life back on track.  In his prime, Frankie Wilde is a celebrity who lives every bit of the high life - drowning his liver in alcohol, snorting bagful after bagful of cocaine, entertaining many a lady, and generally doing everything in a disconnected, vainglorious fashion.  The movie pulls no punches in showing us Frankie at his most disgusting.  Once he begins to lose his hearing, however, you can't help but feel sorry for him.  He covers it up for as long as he possibly can, but - obviously - a man in his profession can't cover up such a devastating truth forever.  Once he learns that he is indeed going completely deaf, his life hits rock bottom.  He basically loses everything, including his wife and son along with his career.  It's not a pretty sight at all, and he eventually holes himself up in his own pitifully constructed rubber room for months on end, basically surviving on drugs alone.  His cocaine addiction is presented in a most forcible way - the monkey on his back is actually a disgusting large badger in a fairy tale outfit that isn't above smacking Frankie around when he threatens to cut back on the snorting.  It sounds ridiculous, but the imagery works frighteningly well.In time, Frankie decides to accept his disability and try to reenter the world; he gives up the drugs (but not the booze), finds someone to teach him the art of lip-reading, and eventually rediscovers his music.  In essence, he develops the ability to feel and see music all around him and to channel it all into some righteous grooves that fuel the most improbable of comebacks.This movie isn't just about Frankie's amazing story, however.  It also seems to have something to say about the music industry and the callousness of greedy managers and promoters who care about nothing apart from the money their stars generate for them.  Frankie was a star, but no one stuck around to help him through a tragedy that almost and probably should have resulted in his death.  The ending of the film, which doesn't follow the path you would normally expect, strongly but quietly reinforces this critique of the shallowness of success.The scenes of Frankie's emotional breakdown truly are dark and disturbing, and there is much in the film as a whole to justify its R rating.  The film also has its funny moments, but this is a true dark comedy.  I have to say that Paul Kaye is spectacular in the role of Frankie, lending a vitality and brute strength to an unforgettable character who will disgust you, amuse you, and eventually inspire you.  I don't know how else to say it: It's All Gone Pete Tong is just a uniquely extraordinary film.",5,"A mesmerizing, uniquely fantastic film",1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,3738,"['Gone', 'Pete', 'Tong', 'really', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'motion', 'picture', 'earmarks', 'cult', 'indie', 'sensation', 'guess', 'should', 'cover', 'couple', 'things', 'right', 'bat', 'however', 'Who', 'Pete', 'Tong', 'ask', 'Well', 'DJ', 'movie', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'Pete', 'Tong', 'actually', 'Frankie', 'Wilde', 'wildly', 'successful', 'DJ', 'mean', 'DJ', 'music-mixing', 'genius', 'not', 'was', 'latest', 'hit', 'so-and-so', '52', 'degrees', 'here', '5:00', 'busy', 'traffic', 'day', 'radio', 'voice', 'who', 'overcame', 'tragedy', 'deafness', 'make', 'huge', 'mysterious', 'comeback', 'movie', 'fellows', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'mockumentary', 'appear', 'be', 'real-life', 'biopic', 'Frankie', 'Wilde', 'incredible', 'story', 'are', 'purely', 'fictional', 'fact', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'anything', 'though', 'still', 'inspirational', 'film', 'will', 'surely', 'captivate', 'you.It', 'oddly', 'powerful', 'story', 'built', 'less', 'likeable', 'fellow', 'who', 'eventually', 'intense', 'suffering', 'courageous', 'efforts', 'finally', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'prime', 'Frankie', 'Wilde', 'celebrity', 'who', 'bit', 'high', 'life', 'drowning', 'liver', 'alcohol', 'snorting', 'bagful', 'bagful', 'cocaine', 'entertaining', 'many', 'lady', 'generally', 'doing', 'everything', 'disconnected', 'vainglorious', 'fashion', 'movie', 'punches', 'showing', 'Frankie', 'most', 'disgusting', 'Once', 'lose', 'hearing', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'up', 'as', 'long', 'possibly', 'can', 'obviously', 'man', 'profession', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'up', 'such', 'devastating', 'truth', 'forever', 'Once', 'indeed', 'going', 'completely', 'deaf', 'life', 'rock', 'bottom', 'basically', 'everything', 'including', 'wife', 'son', 'career', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'eventually', 'up', 'own', 'pitifully', 'constructed', 'rubber', 'room', 'months', 'end', 'basically', 'surviving', 'drugs', 'alone', 'cocaine', 'addiction', 'presented', 'most', 'forcible', 'way', 'monkey', 'back', 'actually', 'disgusting', 'large', 'badger', 'fairy', 'tale', 'outfit', ""n't"", 'smacking', 'Frankie', 'when', 'cut', 'back', 'snorting', 'ridiculous', 'imagery', 'frighteningly', 'well.In', 'time', 'Frankie', 'accept', 'disability', 'try', 'reenter', 'world', 'up', 'drugs', 'not', 'booze', 'someone', 'teach', 'art', 'lip-reading', 'eventually', 'rediscovers', 'music', 'essence', 'ability', 'feel', 'see', 'music', 'channel', 'righteous', 'grooves', 'fuel', 'most', 'improbable', 'comebacks.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'Frankie', 'amazing', 'story', 'however', 'also', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'music', 'industry', 'callousness', 'greedy', 'managers', 'promoters', 'who', 'care', 'nothing', 'apart', 'money', 'stars', 'generate', 'Frankie', 'was', 'star', 'one', 'stuck', 'help', 'tragedy', 'almost', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'death', 'ending', 'film', ""n't"", 'follow', 'path', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'strongly', 'quietly', 'critique', 'shallowness', 'success.The', 'scenes', 'Frankie', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'truly', 'are', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'much', 'film', 'whole', 'justify', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'also', 'funny', 'moments', 'true', 'dark', 'comedy', 'have', 'say', 'Paul', 'Kaye', 'spectacular', 'role', 'Frankie', 'lending', 'vitality', 'brute', 'strength', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'disgust', 'eventually', 'inspire', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'say', 'Gone', 'Pete', 'Tong', 'just', 'uniquely', 'extraordinary', 'film']",It's All Gone Pete Tong

Star Paul Kaye gives a sometimes irritating (but never boring) performance as the lead character. Movie plays like an oddball cross between the 1974 rise-and-fall-of-a-rock-star-film ""Stardust"" (or perhaps an episode of VH-1's ""Behind The Music"") and ""Children Of A Lesser God"". If you can make it past the first 45 minutes (which consists mostly of gross and repetitive scenes of excessive substance abuse accompanied by unintelligible zonked-out proclamations by our runny-nosed leading man) you may be intrigued by the 180 degree turn in the film's tone, as it suddenly becomes an almost sweet tale of unconditional love and redemption. In the hands of a more accomplished director, I suspect this transition would have been handled in a more subtle fashion (if you forgive my analogy, what we get stuck with is equivalent to a bad segue). The most ironic thing about ""Pete Tong"" is that it is so beautifully photographed (in wildly saturated primary colors)-in stark contrast to its largely ugly and dark subject matter.

923386,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000A7LR6Y,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","It's All Gone Pete Tong certainly is an unusual title for a movie; and that's certainly one of the reasons I chose to watch and review this film. We get a mock biopic of a young DJ on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye) is a DJ who lives for the club scene where he is a prominent, wildly successful DJ--and surrounds himself with friends who only like him when things are going his way. Yep, he gets married to a model who works with him in one of his music videos and they adopt a son; but his happiness and the wild ride of fame only lasts so long.Things change radically for Frankie when he goes deaf after too much loud music in night clubs and a wild lifestyle that his doctor tells him didn't exactly help, either. Frankie's so-called friends rapidly abandon him; even his wife supermodel wife Sonja (Kate Magowan) and their son leave him for one of Frankie's friends! The record companies and the discos soon abandon him also because, after all, when you're deaf you just might not stay on top of the heap as a hot, hot, hot DJ.Frankie slips into total despair and fantasizes about being chased by a bear in a apron when he is on one of his countless drug trips; and it is only when he thinks to learn to read lips does the possibility of making a comeback seem real to Frankie. With the help of a woman who works at a lip reading school for the deaf (Penelope, played by Beatriz Batarda), Frankie regains his ability to be a top notch, in demand DJ once more.Questions remain, though--will Frankie want this lifestyle back? What happens to him and Penelope--or will Sonja come back to him once again now that can make tons of money? No plot spoilers here, folks--but there's an ending that I admit did make me smile.To its credit, the movie uses real life DJs and people in the business to make the pretend biopic as realistic as possible. However, although this film purports to be a comedy, I just didn't laugh that much when I saw it. It's not really all that funny except for a few chuckles here and there; and the disability issue Frankie copes with detracts from any true comedy that they may have tried to produce.There are a few extras but the best is the ""making of"" featurette.Overall, It's All Gone Pete Tong is a movie you can watch when nothing better is on TV. No, it's certainly NOT the worst flick I've ever seen; but it just didn't strike me as being that funny. The acting is just OK and the cinematography was average.

923388,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B000A7LR6Y,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 0]","The cover markets this film as a mockumentary.  While I've enjoyed films that use the format, I've grown tired of it over the years - with filmakers insistent on making a work of fiction seem not only plausible, but real.  The fun of this film is that it blends the format with some fun scenes of comedy and drama.The first of act of the film shows Frankie Wilde's fall from stardom.  He is a popular DJ who has succumbed to all the pitfalls of fame: sex, drugs and overall excess.  These would be the signs of any star's downfall.  Frankie falls a bit further though once he loses his hearing.  While some if it is shown, we can only guess how bad it got when we see a long haired Frankie in a filth filled room filling himself full of drugs.  Interspersed we see talking heads being interviewed about Wilde's rise and fall.  There's also a giant bear that occaisonally comes and tries to attack Frankie.  The image of the bear stands for something, but I'll let the viewer figure that out.The drug and depressed filled first act meanders a little bit, with familiar fall from fame montages.  But whatever's lacking there is totally made up for in the film's harrowing second act.  Frankie befriends a deaf girl and tries to somehow find a way for his life to be filled with music.  Sounds pretentious?  This film makes it so believable that you can't help but cheer on Frankie during his plight.  What I really loved was the remarkable shift in tone from the first part of the film.  Frankie sinks deep.  That the filmakers are able to recover our protagonist with such vigor is amazing.Besides a great story, the film also boasts a great soundtrack, from the dance music of the many DJs featured in the film, to the Beach Boys' classic Good Vibrations, music plays a prominent role and is something of a character unto itself. It's also so much more as Frankie Wilde tries to get it back.  The filmakers use images or slight sounds to depict the music at times.  Don't be surprised if it ends up stealing a scene.",4,It makes you wanna dance,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,2016,"['cover', 'markets', 'film', 'mockumentary', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'films', 'use', 'format', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'tired', 'years', 'filmakers', 'insistent', 'making', 'work', 'fiction', 'seem', 'not', 'only', 'plausible', 'real', 'fun', 'film', 'format', 'fun', 'scenes', 'comedy', 'drama.The', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'Frankie', 'Wilde', 'fall', 'stardom', 'popular', 'DJ', 'who', 'succumbed', 'pitfalls', 'fame', 'sex', 'drugs', 'overall', 'excess', 'would', 'be', 'signs', 'star', 'downfall', 'Frankie', 'bit', 'further', 'though', 'once', 'hearing', 'shown', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'how', 'bad', 'got', 'when', 'see', 'long', 'haired', 'Frankie', 'filth', 'filled', 'room', 'filling', 'full', 'drugs', 'Interspersed', 'see', 'talking', 'heads', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Wilde', 'rise', 'fall', 'also', 'giant', 'bear', 'occaisonally', 'tries', 'attack', 'Frankie', 'image', 'bear', 'something', ""'ll"", 'let', 'viewer', 'figure', 'out.The', 'drug', 'depressed', 'filled', 'first', 'act', 'meanders', 'little', 'bit', 'familiar', 'fall', 'fame', 'montages', 'lacking', 'totally', 'made', 'up', 'film', 'harrowing', 'second', 'act', 'Frankie', 'deaf', 'girl', 'tries', 'somehow', 'find', 'way', 'life', 'be', 'filled', 'music', 'pretentious', 'film', 'so', 'believable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'Frankie', 'plight', 'What', 'really', 'loved', 'was', 'remarkable', 'shift', 'tone', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Frankie', 'deep', 'filmakers', 'are', 'able', 'recover', 'protagonist', 'such', 'vigor', 'great', 'story', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'dance', 'music', 'many', 'DJs', 'featured', 'film', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'classic', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'music', 'prominent', 'role', 'something', 'character', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Frankie', 'Wilde', 'get', 'back', 'filmakers', 'use', 'images', 'slight', 'sounds', 'depict', 'music', 'times', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'up', 'stealing', 'scene']",It's All Gone Pete Tong
923389,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000A7LR6Y,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","I was actually able to find DVD of this movie in my local library.  It is a story about DJ who at the peak of his successful career turns deaf.  Typical things happen shortly thereafter:  his wife leaves him, his friends bail out, drug dealers swarm to feed him coke in his moments of personal weakness, the music industry executives do their best to write him off and move on to the next DJ guy.  While the documentary style of the movie was boring for the first half of the movie, the second half is the best.  It is filled with comedic moments about what is means to be deaf and adjust to the new environment by a person who was not born with such disability.  But the end is all too predictable and sappy as our main character Framkie Wilde falls in love with a deaf girl, they have a child together and after ovecoming his disability in the most unusual and unique way they both elope in the world of ordinary, anonymous people.  This is not a traditional ""ovecoming - the - life -of - hardships"" kind of movie, it is raw and sincere.  But as I said it's main weakness is that it is produced as a form of documentary, which sort of makes it boring.  It is almost like listening thru narations thru a half of the movie.  The actor portraying Frankie Wilde was great.

923390,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B000A7LR6Y,Reticuli,"[0, 0]","""It's all gone Pete Tong"" is a derogatory statement meant to criticize electronica and modern dance music.  Here it's used as a double meaning for someone also encountering a frightening, nightmarish disability that directly affects his craft (add the comma).  It falls somewhat short in representing real club/EDM culture and the tranced quality of ""the moment"" in a big venue.  It never quite draws you into the intoxicating vibe that removes the perception of time, leaving just the combined mood of the audience and the sound system.  At 90 minutes or so it's perhaps too short, with club scenes that were shot with too much light and limited music selections until the credits.  Oddly enough, Blade and Code 46 have more ""truthful"" club sequences... uh, sans the vampire frenzy, of course.While the film is clearly not directed by someone who cares much about the music, the skill/knowledge set, or the culture, particularly with the ridiculous, over-the-top club sequences, heads bopping in the car like an SNL skit, awful generic music made into a music video early on, and the very simplistic & continuity-problems-riddled mixing scenes... I found it hilarious, touching, and beautifully photographed.  This in spite of its flaws.  As a mockumentary it pulls it off well enough, in no small part due to a fantastic cast and sharp dialog.  I'll admit the Austrian's lyrics were embarrassingly representative of much of the lesser music out there.  Paul Kaye's agent and the record label exec have equally remarkable comic timing to him.

923391,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000A7LR6Y,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[8, 11]","""It's all gone Pete Tong"" is Cockney rhyming slang for ""It's all gone wrong,"" named after British DJ Pete Tong (who appears in the film and is a producer). This mockumentary by Canadian Michael Dowse (Fubar) follows the rise, fall, and resurrection of Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye), a resident Ibiza god of the turntables who has the club crowd drooling at his feet. Frankie is losing his hearing due to a combination of drugs, working the clubs, and a congenital hearing defect, and instead of heeding his doctor's advice, he drowns in more booze, more coke, and self-destructive behaviour. In a studio blowout, he loses the rest of his hearing and becomes a drug-addled hermit. Finally kicking the drug habit and pulling himself together after two failed suicide attempts, Frankie seeks out a lip reading teacher and discovers how to beat mix using vibrations.As many have noted, this is a film that walks a very narrow line between humour and mock-seriousness in the style of ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" with the prerequisite talking-head interviews with real-life DJ celebs, including Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Pete Tong, Sarah Main, and more. The problem is, ""Pete Tong"" can't decide if it's a mockumentary biopic, rave epic, or love story, and loses its cohesion along the way. Much of it is played up for shock value, with excessive amounts of projectile vomiting, graphic sex, drug use and filthy language. The Coke Badger wasn't funny at all: a six-foot stuffed badger wearing a dirty apron, complete with dangling white snot, chases Frankie to snort more coke.Where ""Pete Tong"" does shine is in its soundtrack (available as ASIN: B00097HDOU) and its club scenes, shot inside the legendary Ibiza palaces of Cream, Amnesia, and Manumission during actual theme nights at full capacity of 10,000. The ""interviews"" with ethnic tourists (Spanish transvestite, Polish flower seller, German guys) and on-location photography of restaurants, villas, and clubs really lend the film an authentic feel. The behind-the-scenes making of, which clocks in at almost an hour, details the grueling shoot that almost didn't happen: no money, no line producer, no extras, no cars, no water, etc. Another nice extra are the featurettes that were originally available on several websites to promote the film. These don't tie directly into the story, but serve to flesh out the characters.This is NOT for sensitive viewers, but when all is said and done, I'm glad I finally had the chance to see Frankie in action after waiting since the film's release last April. Fans of rave, house, techno, and Ibiza veterans will have fun with this.",4,"A monumental orgy of drugs, drink, sex and music.

This docu-biopic chronicles the heydays, fastlane lifestyle, and self-destructive times of Frankie Wilde, and to reinventing and reviving his passion and ability as a deaf DJ.

When he became almost totally deaf at the top of his career, he started to lose a grip of himself, and behaved like a madman at one of his gigs in a club. He was told by the doctor that he was not to expose his ear to anymore loud noise or he would go deaf completely. When he insisted on producing a new album with the assist of hearing aid, an accident occurred and rendered him totally deaf.
