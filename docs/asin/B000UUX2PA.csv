Once or twice at a gym or while at a friend's house.I enjoyed it, but never felt comfortable, so I decided to try again and picked this up.It is a great addition to my workouts.  The intructor provides a detailed lesson on how to use the ball which helped me get used to using it, and there are many routines to target parts of your body that I can do now.There are also some more advanced routines that I look forward to doing more, but there are enough easier routines to keep me going for awhile still.",5,Nice Addition to Workouts,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,574,"['use', 'various', 'workouts', 'home', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'tried', 'ball', 'muc', 'Once', 'twice', 'gym', 'while', 'friend', 'house.I', 'enjoyed', 'never', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'decided', 'try', 'again', 'picked', 'up.It', 'great', 'addition', 'workouts', 'intructor', 'detailed', 'lesson', 'how', 'use', 'ball', 'helped', 'get', 'used', 'using', 'are', 'many', 'routines', 'target', 'parts', 'body', 'can', 'do', 'now.There', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'advanced', 'routines', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'more', 'are', 'enough', 'easier', 'routines', 'keep', 'going', 'awhile', 'still']",Core Ball For Beginners & Beyond: Over 10 Routines

I feel loose and relaxed afterward. I have noticed that my core is strengthen up a bit from doing this for a couple months. It is not my only work-out.It is a pleasant video. I think the more segments you add, the more you'll get out of it.My mother uses this one too, she cannot take the stress of a high-impact workout. It is easy on the the joins and limbs. You do need to learn to balance, so don't rush yourslef.If you're a cardio nut - this is not for you.I will definately keep this one and keep using it.

Karen starts off with a detailed lesson about the Core Ball, how to use it and the moves, and I go back and watch this lesson from time to time.There are then a series of routines of various exercises of time and areas to work on.  Some were a bit more challenging than others, but everything I was able to pick up on things as I went along.The last section is more challenging routines with a different instructor who I also like, but the routines are still a bit past where I am now but should be fun to work with from what I have seen so far.",5,Great Beginning Core Ball Workouts,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,734,"['have', 'been', 'using', 'DVD', 'Karen', 'awhile', 'have', 'been', 'enjoying', 'wanted', 'learn', 'Core', 'Ball', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'before.This', 'DVD', 'been', 'very', 'helpful', 'meeting', 'goal', 'Karen', 'detailed', 'lesson', 'Core', 'Ball', 'how', 'use', 'moves', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'lesson', 'time', 'are', 'then', 'series', 'routines', 'various', 'exercises', 'time', 'areas', 'work', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'others', 'everything', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'things', 'went', 'last', 'section', 'more', 'challenging', 'routines', 'different', 'instructor', 'who', 'also', 'like', 'routines', 'are', 'still', 'bit', 'where', 'am', 'now', 'should', 'be', 'fun', 'work', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far']",Core Ball For Beginners & Beyond: Over 10 Routines

The beginner section of this video is a challange but most are doable. I found the instructor to be helpful yet slow enough for a true beginer to learn.  Instructor encourages you to try, but to know your limits. Most of the excercises are the same as the ones I was doing during my Physical Therapy.
