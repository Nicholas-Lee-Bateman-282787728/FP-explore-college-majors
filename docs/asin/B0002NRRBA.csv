841469,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0002NRRBA,A. Estes,"[1, 1]","Hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, Godsmack came almost out of nowhere with their success in the late 90's. They didn't fit in with the nu-metal genre, nor did they sport a recycled, ready for radio, grunge-lite sound. Just a decent, every-man's hard-rock band. With their debut album, many labelled the band simple and redundant, but as time went on, they honed their craft, grew as a group and became one of the more inconic bands of the modern-rock scene, with each album exceeding the platinum mark and countless sold-out shows to boot. ""Changes,"" the band's third live DVD, truly captures that side of the band. Captured on their 2004 tour, ""Changes"" delivers not only a crystal clear, full length concert, but a slew of interviews and behind the stage antics.Godsmack are hardly a thinking man's band, but it must be said that the behind-the-scenes stuff truly lends some insight into the workings of the group. Each member has a unique background and perspective, and it isn't just frontman Sully Erna who gets all the attention. Like any band's home video, there are parts that drag and some interviews aren't really all that interesting, but for the most part, ""Changes"" delivers considerable bang for your buck. Suffice it to say, when Godsmack aquired Shannon Larkin on drums in 2003, things got more interesting. So it's great to have his influence on the band captured early on here, and to be honest, he emerges as the most interesting and intriguing member of the band. The now infamous ""Batalla De Los Tambores"" (or ""Battle Of The Drums"") definitely kicks things up a notch in the concert portion of the DVD, something which, thankfully, they continue to include in their live show to this day. Bassist Robbie Merrill and guitarist Tony Rombola, who usually stand in Sully's shadow, also open up quite a bit, which is nice. As for the concert portion, it's a bit brief considering they were working with three albums of material, but all the hits can be found and they perform them all nearly flawless. The picture and sound quality are gorgeous, and of all the DVD's the band has put together, this remains their best and most professional. Hardcore fans will appreciate getting as up close and personal with the band as you get, while all others will see a side of Godsmack they never saw before, and truly appreciate them for what they are: A really great rock band.",4,Not So Faceless Anymore.,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,2386,"['Hailing', 'Boston', 'Massachusetts', 'Godsmack', 'came', 'almost', 'nowhere', 'success', 'late', '90', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'nu-metal', 'genre', 'did', 'sport', 'recycled', 'ready', 'radio', 'grunge-lite', 'sound', 'Just', 'decent', 'every-man', 'hard-rock', 'band', 'debut', 'album', 'many', 'labelled', 'band', 'simple', 'redundant', 'time', 'went', 'honed', 'craft', 'grew', 'group', 'became', 'one', 'more', 'inconic', 'bands', 'modern-rock', 'scene', 'album', 'exceeding', 'platinum', 'mark', 'countless', 'sold-out', 'shows', 'boot', 'Changes', 'band', 'third', 'live', 'DVD', 'truly', 'side', 'band', 'Captured', '2004', 'tour', 'Changes', 'delivers', 'not', 'only', 'crystal', 'clear', 'full', 'length', 'concert', 'slew', 'interviews', 'stage', 'antics.Godsmack', 'are', 'hardly', 'thinking', 'man', 'band', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'truly', 'insight', 'workings', 'group', 'member', 'unique', 'background', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'just', 'frontman', 'Sully', 'Erna', 'who', 'attention', 'band', 'home', 'video', 'are', 'parts', 'drag', 'interviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'interesting', 'most', 'part', 'Changes', 'delivers', 'considerable', 'bang', 'buck', 'Suffice', 'say', 'when', 'Godsmack', 'aquired', 'Shannon', 'Larkin', 'drums', '2003', 'things', 'got', 'more', 'interesting', 'great', 'have', 'influence', 'band', 'captured', 'early', 'here', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'member', 'band', 'now', 'infamous', 'Batalla', 'De', 'Los', 'Tambores', 'Battle', 'Drums', 'definitely', 'things', 'up', 'notch', 'concert', 'portion', 'DVD', 'something', 'thankfully', 'continue', 'include', 'live', 'show', 'day', 'Bassist', 'Robbie', 'Merrill', 'guitarist', 'Tony', 'Rombola', 'who', 'usually', 'stand', 'Sully', 'shadow', 'also', 'open', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'nice', 'concert', 'portion', 'bit', 'brief', 'considering', 'were', 'working', 'three', 'albums', 'material', 'hits', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'perform', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'DVD', 'band', 'put', 'together', 'best', 'most', 'professional', 'Hardcore', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'getting', 'close', 'personal', 'band', 'get', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'side', 'Godsmack', 'never', 'saw', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'rock', 'band']",N/A

I saw this disc at a trade show demo. I bought it because of the excellent drumwork track between Shannon and Sully. That particular track is a very good surround sound demo disc. After watching and listening to the track, I decided to watch the entire album. It's a very good album. I was impressed with how talented and grounded they were. These guys are ""rocks stars"" in their job but I was impressed with how focused they are. These are regular extremely talented individuals making a living to provide for their families.

I like to somewhat relive the experience of going to see the band live. Most of the time, the bands don't record the actual concert you went to, but they are always similar shows if they record a DVD at a place scheduled for the same tour. In this case, I was able to see this tour back a bunch of years ago and then to see this show they recorded in PA, I was able to relive it again!If you are a rock fan or a Godsmack fan, you NEED this DVD. It's exceptional. It gives you an inside look at life as a rockstar and life on the road. It's not all fun and games. There is a lot of work that goes into it. But then again, you are living your dream. You get to see exactly what goes into a tour, all the people that are needed to make a large rock tour work, and the heart and soul that go into it.

841476,A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,B0002NRRBA,Gunther Haagendazs,"[2, 2]","There is no way to say this other then this DVD absolutely rocked.  The past Godsmack DVD's were plagued with problems but this one is just perfect.  The sound quality is amazing, simply put.  The only flaw I found was that when you play the movie, Voodoo and Whatever (which Amazon forgot to list here) are interrupted with interviews. Why they did that still puzzles me, but you can watch those two songs in their entirety when you select them in the Individual song menu which basically eliminates the interview or backstage segments.  If you like the band at all you will be amazed as you watch them play, it's a solid and perfect performance.  Once you open the DVD package you are greeted with a letter from Shannon Larkin telling you the usual stuff on how much the band appreciates the fans and what its like to work in a band but what came across as shocking was that they were almost unable to film this concert for some reason.Something that may puzzle people is that it's listed as being PG, this is not true as they swear their heads off on this DVD, but not too excessively but enough that its definitely not PG.  As I stated before the sound quality and video quality are excellent and if you're a drummer (like myself), Batalla de los Tambores is worth the price of this thing in itself.  At first I wasn't too sure about Shannon being a good replacement for Tommy Stewart but this show proves that he's even better, as watching his style of playing is captivating in itself.

I've never taken in a live show, but I have a couple of their studio CD's and think a number of their songs are excellent.  That being said, I did not expect them to be a great live act.  I didn't have faith that Sully could pull off his songs live.  Boy, what a fool I was!!!Sully and the band put on an absolutely flawless show.  The entire band really rocks and Sully's vocals are tight.  I wouldn't call it a spectacle to see, but it doesn't need to be.  There are some lasers, lights, and pyro (oh, and moving drum/percussion sets - a definite highlight).  But the set is really all about the music.  And the performances really blew me away.I have great respect for each of the band members having now seen them perform and having gotten to know them a little through the quality interviews included.  Godsmack is just a great rock band that believe in the power of their art and entertainment.  It certainly moved me.And I must call attention to the drummer, Shannon.  Other reviewers have praised him as well, but I have to say he is the most exciting drummer I have ever seen.  He is an absolute wildman on the drums.  His skill is great I am sure, but the amazing thing is the visual spectacle.  He just wails on the drums.  During the interviews mention is made of the muppet Animal, and the analogy is perfect.  The drum battle between Sully and Shannon truly is awesome.  I can't imagine any music fan not being pumped up after that one.  Shannon goes off throughout.  Check him out on Bad Religion, etc.This DVD really heightened my knowledge of the band.  I have a whole new respect for them.  If you are a huge fan already, I am not saying anything you do not already know.  But if you're like me and are really just a casual fan, let me encourage you, you cannot go wrong with this DVD.

841481,A302E62YONTR4H,B0002NRRBA,M. Barrows,"[2, 2]","I agree with most of the other reviewers on this title, but there is one thing that is annoying about it. You do have the capability of watching just the performances without the documentary footage, however, the performances have a gap after each song. This is because they have set the menu up where all of the songs are one chapter with the individual songs being titles within that chapter. This means that you lose the feeling of a live show somewhat because each song ends and then your player will have about a 2-3 second break as it jumps to the next song. This would not be such a big deal except that some of the songs go right into each other and it really detracts from the flow of the show. They really should go back in and re-edit the footage where it flows seamlessly as it does on the Godsmack-Live DVD. With that said, the footage and sound quality are great overall and I would have probably given it 5 stars if not for the annoying editing of the performances.",4,A good DVD with one flaw,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,980,"['agree', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'title', 'one', 'thing', 'annoying', 'do', 'have', 'capability', 'watching', 'just', 'performances', 'documentary', 'footage', 'however', 'performances', 'have', 'gap', 'song', 'have', 'set', 'menu', 'up', 'where', 'songs', 'are', 'one', 'chapter', 'individual', 'songs', 'being', 'titles', 'chapter', 'lose', 'feeling', 'live', 'show', 'somewhat', 'song', 'then', 'player', 'will', 'have', '2-3', 'second', 'break', 'next', 'song', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'songs', 'go', 'right', 'other', 'really', 'flow', 'show', 'really', 'should', 'go', 'back', 're-edit', 'footage', 'where', 'seamlessly', 'Godsmack-Live', 'DVD', 'said', 'footage', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'great', 'overall', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'annoying', 'editing', 'performances']",N/A

The picture quality was great, the camera work was excellent, sound was good... Should be an enjoyable watch for either a die-hard fan or someone just learning about the band.
