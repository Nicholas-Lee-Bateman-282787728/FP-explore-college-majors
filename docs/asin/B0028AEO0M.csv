I have never seen her in anything where she did not render a terrific performance.  She has always been sexy without being movie star glamorous too which has served her really well as an actress as she has moved into older age herself.  No one is sighing over her as a lost great beauty.This is one of her very best roles, as the detective in charge of mostly male cops who do not want a female in charge.  That bias ebbs away as each series progresses because she solves her cases and results count.  She solves murder cases, often very similar to the ones that her male counterparts solve in the British mysteries.One aspect of this series that I really like is often the guest star criminal is someone who plays especially well as a foil for a female supervising detective.Like virtually every other detectives we watch in the UK mystery series, her personal life is a complete mess too.  She drifts in and out of relationships but it is obvious that she will end up just like her male colleagues in the other series, alone. She is as vulnerable in her personal life as she is Morse-like in her detecting life.  I do think if you are going to compare her to a male detective, Morse may be the closest although she is not as educated as he is.I thought these were based on novels but they are not.  They were written for television by a woman, LaPlante. I wanted to read the novels after finishing the series and discovered there were no novels.This could make an especially splendid christmas gift for someone.",5,Helen Mirren Nails A+ Mystery Series,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,1581,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'early', '1970s', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'render', 'terrific', 'performance', 'always', 'been', 'sexy', 'being', 'movie', 'star', 'glamorous', 'too', 'served', 'really', 'well', 'actress', 'moved', 'older', 'age', 'one', 'sighing', 'over', 'lost', 'great', 'beauty.This', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'roles', 'detective', 'charge', 'mostly', 'male', 'cops', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'female', 'charge', 'bias', 'ebbs', 'away', 'series', 'cases', 'results', 'count', 'murder', 'cases', 'often', 'very', 'similar', 'ones', 'male', 'counterparts', 'solve', 'British', 'mysteries.One', 'aspect', 'series', 'really', 'often', 'guest', 'star', 'criminal', 'someone', 'who', 'especially', 'well', 'foil', 'female', 'supervising', 'detective.Like', 'virtually', 'other', 'detectives', 'watch', 'UK', 'mystery', 'series', 'personal', 'life', 'complete', 'mess', 'too', 'relationships', 'obvious', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'male', 'colleagues', 'other', 'series', 'alone', 'as', 'vulnerable', 'personal', 'life', 'Morse-like', 'detecting', 'life', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'compare', 'male', 'detective', 'Morse', 'may', 'be', 'closest', 'not', 'as', 'educated', 'thought', 'were', 'based', 'novels', 'are', 'not', 'were', 'written', 'television', 'woman', 'LaPlante', 'wanted', 'read', 'novels', 'finishing', 'series', 'discovered', 'were', 'novels.This', 'could', 'make', 'especially', 'splendid', 'christmas', 'gift', 'someone']",N/A

But it is not the usual one where everyone in the squad gets along. This series is a BBC production, so some of the words may differ from American English, but you will get the drift.Jane Tennyson is the only female detective in the squad - the rest is the old boys school.  In the first episode, a prostitute is found dead in a ""bed sit"", which is basically her place she takes her ""johns"".  When the detective on the case dies of a heart attack, she asks the Chief Inspector to take the case.The dead detectives best friend not only speaks behind her back but in front of her - he is only a sergeant in rank and that would never happen with a man.So she is fighting the office politics, problems at home with her boyfriend and his needs and trying to solve the crime in time to establish herself as a ""good cop"".I have seen all of the series - she has weaknesses as do all of us. She has sex with some of her upper level detectives, but lets them know it is just sex and wants to make sure they won't tell anyone in the office.  She is constantly watched by the papers as she is on highly visible cases and has be caught in some very tenuous positions.I highly recommend the series.

Recently, I found out it was out on DVD, and there were 7 or so episodes in all. WOW, I was not disappointed with any of them.I have never seen a British crime drama series that was this gritty - well at least in comparison to what I have seen from Britain before this. I mean, this is not like Agatha Christie and genteel murders in country estates. There are child molesters, vicious drug dealers, serial killers and stuff like that.Helen Mirren plays the main character, Jane Tennyson. She is great in this role, and she usually is in anything she plays in what I have seen. If you have not seen her in ""The Queen"", you should after watching this series.The writers do not make her into any kind of saint or perfect detective by any means. She makes moral mistakes and is not always dead on when solving the cases - well, by the end she gets it right. But, they let you wonder for a while sometimes. Adds to the experience in a very good way.The earlier episodes have a large subplot on how female detectives got a hard time in the London police which might seem a little odd today to many viewers, but I guess it was seen as more of a problem then. It does add an element of tension to the episodes where present which makes for a more interesting show in any case.The series is very British, so you might have to pay close attention to figure things out now and then, but it is not that hard.

A bargain compared to individual segments. If you are just finding Prime Suspect, you WILL want all 7 years. 9 stories. Not just tales of cops and murder, but in-your-fact realistic cop activity, which was done with so much realistic detail, it was the show to change British (and world) crime shows forever. It is the gritty type of show that all mystery film and TV now try to duplicate. Police drama was changed forever by Helen Mirren and her role as Jane Tennison.Be aware, the cases may not always end to your satisfaction--just like real life crimes and punishment. But you will be on the edge of your seat while you watch. 6 stories last over 3 hours each. The other 3 are about 1 1/2 hours long. Each is compelling viewing, ruthless in the detail, definitely not for children and the squeamish, blatantly course visually and in dialogue, but oh, so realistic.Helen Mirren makes the show as Tennison. Obsessed, work-driven, feminist attitude, course, in-your-face drive, compellingly believable, more man-like rather than the occasional romantic which does exist, she's a drinker, and she almost never smiles.Subtitles for series 1-6. CC for 7. Even subtitles on the bonus features. Stars in every segment, and plenty of them. A list too long to post.1-Brutal murders, & DCI Tennison gets promoted to head of the murder investigation team after the present leader dies. She takes on a botched investigation, a slippery suspect, a home-front relationship, and proves to have more than what it takes, even being a woman, to male surprise. Loads of blood, mutliated bodies, bare chests (including star Zoe Wanamaker), graphic scenes and language. It's unrated-but be warned. Introduces the woman-at-the-head cop and makes you glad you own ""THE COMPLETE COLLECTION.""2-DCI Tennison gains her staff's acceptance but all is not as conciliatory with the murder investigation of a black corpse found in a black neighborhood. London's citizens and police force have some race issues. Then there's Jane's hot new ""sleep-with.""3-A murder turned arson to cover the death, becomes DCI Tennisson's first case in her new job after a transfer. The department tries to steer her away from the murder case. Is there a department connection? And her love life is messier than the arson victim. A good mystery involving disgusting crimes.4-three 90 min. stories: A--Supt. Tennison exits a hospital after receiving a voluntary procedure and must face an abducted baby case. B--A club manager is killed in his own home, and defiled. Suspects are caught, but the why is yet unanswered. C--Tennison finds home life better than work-evidenced by a naked bath with her beau. New murder cases suggest past cop errors in crime cases.5-DS Tennison's 1st crime investigation is a drug related murder that moves into another level of heinous crime. And Jane finds a different married copper colleague to sleep with. Tossed in is a police leak (Brits must love bad cops.)6-A tortured and murdered female body leads an investigation through Bosnian illegals. There is a prime suspect but no convicting evidence. Will the truth be known prior to another murder? (Bonus: 23 min ""behind the scenes of this segment with subtitles)7-Tennison is 60, a month from retirement, drinking heavy, her father dying of cancer, and determined to find the killer of a teenager. It will be Jane's last case. A very emotional, suspenseful, final 3 hours. (Bonus: 50 min series behind the scenes, with subtitles, filmographies & photos.)Started in 1991 and ending in 2007, every series was a hit, and done with perfection. A female cop show will never be this good again. But be warned, for language, and gritty gruesome graphic content.

Completely unlike anything in the American cop show format, the first thing you'll notice is that these are all 1-hour-40-minute movie length features as opposed to the American format of 42-44 minutes.  With only two of these features in each series broadcast a week apart as a part 1 / part 2, this must have been more like an annual event on British televison as opposed to a ""season"" on American TV.  And what an event it must have been... wonderful story development with some really gritty subject matters, and Helen is marvelously brilliant in what could have been a very stereo-typed role.  She plays it with a flawed humanity that is totally engrossing and even a little uncomfortable at times.  There are also some fine performances by her fellow actors, particularly a couple of the ""suspects"".  Very emotional and gripping.  One other big difference from American cop shows... for the most part the officers are not armed and there was very little gunplay.  This was at times a refreshing change and other times it was like ""are you crazy going into that situatuion without a gun?!!""  Just shows you what we Americans are conditioned to.Series 4 was the only one expanded to three parts (wish all them had been three), and there was a gap of seven years between Series 5 & 6, and three years between 6 and 7, the final one.

Mirren plays her role very well and she actually gets 16 years older herself so the aging is quite credible. The series was produced by ITV and is if anything more edgy than the typical BBC drama. The content is very au courant. Mirren is struggling against a very macho and old-boys police force in addition to fighting crime; but she has thick skin and doesn't take any abuse. A lot of topical issues of the 90s are included in the series (black policemen, female policemen, gay policemen, pedophilia, poor healthcare, East-European mafia.) If you lived in the UK during these years it feels a bit like time travel. These topics are all dealt with in a fairly nuanced way - ie they don't detract from the story. There is no real preaching in the series, but off course the focus on the underbelly of British society is a bit of a political statement. No clear left or right wing propaganda. The minorities are often criminals in the series. It is a riveting script and good actors. Naturally, things are exaggerated but that is too be expected.

Much has been written about the video transfer which was recut for this release. This was no top and tail job, the in frame material is much wider than the original 1.33 release with only a minor amount missing from top and bottom and it looks so much better. The transfer is brilliant and once one compares with the original there should be no argument. Yes there some odd bits here and there that have serious source related faults but they are not frequent and one rapidly ignores them. One program is still in 1.33 as the original material has been lost but it looks surprisingly good nevertheless.This is just so much better than the old DVDs and you should not hesitate.

1255726,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B0028AEO0M,Lola's Mom,"[3, 5]","Meet Jane Tennison, a woman detective not afraid to step on toes, take names, and rise to the top despite blatant sexism she faces everyday.Mystery one: Upon learning another DCI has died of a heart attack, Jane steps in and requests his case, that of a dead ""prostitute"", two actually. She's spent years on the back-burner because the district prefers a man in charge. In this episode we see the kind of men she has to work with...and they're awful. They even try to hinder her investigation by withholding evidence and files. They call her awful names, criticize everything she does. As her career takes off finally, though, it becomes apparent Jane must learn to juggle this time-demanding career with her personal life and we see some strife between her beau and her. Phone calls at all hours. Rescheduling appointments. He feels ignored and that nothing is more important than her and her career...what about his??I found some of the police procedure a bit confusing, but it's a different country, different rules, and it's the nineties. I also would have preferred that they have more than one suspect. For me, when watching a crime show, part of the fun is figuring out wohdunit, so it disappointed me in this aspect.I honestly didn't think they were going to get the guy...this one surprised me. And I appreciate how this woman came to earn the others' respect and even better, that another woman helped solve the case!I also appreciate how not everyone is...well, perfect looking. Matter of fact, nobody is. It's obvious British television is not as shallow as American. Men had hairy backs, funny noses, women were average-sized. It makes it more real.Mystery two: Probably my favorite. A body is uncovered under some slabs in a garden. The case takes place in the middle of a race riot of sorts. The Afro-Caribbean community feels they are getting the short end of the stick and racism is truly rampant in Jane's precinct. There's also a brief work-romance that may not end well. Police procedure is questioned and some people get in trouble. The bad thing about being in charge is you're the one to blame when those beneath you do something stupid. This was intense and emotional and I appreciated the racism theme. Sadly, it exists and sweeping it under the rug doesn't mean it's not there. Great lessons.Mystery three, I did not like. It was rather vulgar. I imagine that when it first aired in the nineties, it was considered scandalous. I wondered at times if they bent over backwards whilst filming this one, trying to come up with ways to shock us. It has a lot of child prostitution, men in drag, corrupt police force members, and involved a burned body. What I didn't like most of all though was how incompetent Helen came across in the beginning. I figure she was trying to get her bearings in a new place but she also tried too hard to put the men in their place and sorta embarrassed herself.Mystery four is just really intense. I actually cried during one part. This is a favorite too. It involves...gosh, a crying baby who then goes missing, a pedophile who swears he's fixed, a man struggling with having been abused in his own past, and how...well, sometimes detectives can ruin lives. Just so intense in so many spots. They really outdid themselves with this episode. Mystery five while not a favorite was good as well. Some people should not be mothers...that's all I'm going to say about the case. But I liked that this featured another woman detective. The two got off to a rough start but it worked out in the end. Mystery six brings back Marlow. Did he do it? Was she wrong? Is there a copycat? And once again, we see Jane struggling to have a personal relationship... There is even talk of resigning.Series 5: This one is in two parts. It's gang and drug-related and appears there just may be a leak in the force. I find it interesting that almost every mystery reveals at least one corrupt person in high standing within the ranks. There's this kid named Street and he seems to get away with everything...he's way too powerful and it looks like it's up to Jane to take him down a few pegs. There won't be a happy ending in this one. Too many people have been hurt... At the heart of this though is how drugs and addiction can totally destroy a family.Jane is also a tad distracted by her new affair with her married boss. To be honest, I'm not sure why they have her having affairs at all. They mystery and crime and the investigations are enough to keep us on our toes. Though this one is not totally irrelevant, such as the one with the doctor was.I swear, I thought Jane was going to die in this one, even though common sense tells me that if if there's a season 6, obviously she lives...it was just that INTENSE. I'm using that word a lot for this TV show.Series 6: I especially appreciate this one because it delves into war crimes. She treads a fine line as she disobeys direct orders to charge a man she knows is guilty but her gov't is protecting. I have a lot of respect for this side of Jane. She does what she knows is right. This ""mystery"" involves dead, tortured girls, political refugees, whistle-blowing, stolen identity, political corruptness--lots of that in these.Series 7: Jane seems to be falling in this, into a bad slump of alcoholism and self-destruction. The case involves a missing and later dead girl. Who killed her and why? The suspect list has two main players and the end result was a surprise. This particular series also shows us more of Jane's personal life, her relationship with her family, her drinking. I'm a tad sad the show ended this way. I'd have preferred to see Jane go out on a ball of glory, kicking butt as she retires, not drowning in drink, but then again, what I've appreciated about this series is it's real life. It doesn't always paint a pretty picture, because life--especially that of detective who witnesses horrid things all day--is not a pretty picture.",4,Every Episode is INTENSE,1383782400,"11 7,

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[7, 7]","Jane Tennison, played by Oscar-winner Helen Mirren, may be a hard drinker and somewhat sexually promiscuous, but she is also tenacious, driven and one of Britain's top cops.  Unlike many of her colleagues,  she is not afraid to buck the system in order to bring a guilty party to justice.  Indeed, she might even be considered to be a distant cousin to Brenda Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) of THE CLOSER.Tennison is the central character of the acclaimed, award-winning British  television series, Prime Suspect, which has now been released in its entirety onto DVD in a 9-disc boxed set by Acorn Media.  The collection includes nine stories, six of them consisting of two episodes.  Each episode runs approximately 100-105 minutes.  A bonus disc contains well over one hour of ""behind the scenes"" documentaries.PRIME SUSPECT avoids car chases and gunfights.  Yet, it is one of the most involving and exciting police dramas that I've ever seen.  The writing has a depth that is virtually never found in a Hollywood product and the production has a semi-documentary atmosphere that is also seldom seen on these shores.The story lines are varied: the tracking down a serial killer, a years-old case that could spark a race riot and still another that has to do with the disappearance of a child.PRIME SUSPECT is television at its best.

Tennison, played by the very talented Helen Mirran, is a woman that could be a role model for many. Not only does she battle her way to the top of the British Metropolitan Police, she deals with some terrifying crime scenes and a few of her own secrets. Time and time again, she overcomes her own demons and the brutal sexism she faces on a daily basis.The series starts off with Tennison getting a big promotion and finds herself in the middle of a botched investigation. After she straightens things out, she gets most of her staff's approval, but that doesn't mean it's going to be an easy ride. The show takes you through baby abductions, bad cops, and some really gruesome murder scenes. Later in the series, you get to see some more personal aspects of Tennison's life. Her father loses his battle with cancer and this seems to be a catalyst for her drinking. All in all, a realistic look at British crime that leaves you on the edge of your seat through every episode.If you watch one season, you'll want to watch them all.

Oscar winner Helen Mirren is Detective Jane Tennison.  Obsessed and profoundly flawed, we follow her through the ranks of England's Metropolitan Police as she solves gritty, ghastly crimes while battling personal demons and inter office prejudice and pointed sexism.Much more than a gripping murder mystery, Mirren's Tennison is one of the truly great character creations of our time.  Universally praised, the series received more than 20 significant international awards.It's so rare when a TV series finds the right mix of on-screen actors and behind-the-scene talent to create not only gripping murder mysteries but also indelible characters that ring true in the real world that we recognize.  The who-dunits work as crackling stand alone dramas but when seen as a whole they are amped to another level as we watch a tough but insecure woman attempt to prove herself in a literally bloody, cut-throat man's world.Created by crime writer Lynda La Plante, the series features some of Britain's biggest stars including Ralph Fiennes, Tom Wilkinson, David Thewlis, Frank Finlay and many others.  If you missed the original broadcasts in the US on ""Masterpiece Theatre"" and ""Mystery!"" in the early 90s, you can see it as a massive linear novel.  Mirren's Tennison hunts serial killers and investigates police corruption and is moved around as she steps on toes and battles alcohol.  The seventh series comes to a fitting close: Jane Tennison makes a big mistake in the murder case she in which she is involved, deals with her approaching retirement and realizes her father is dying.What I most like about this incredible show is that Tennison's personal life falls apart as she rises higher in her career. She smokes, drinks, sleeps around and reflects the male culture in which she competes - and survives.  The stories pull no punches and contain graphic content and coarse language. It doesn't get much better than this.  Nine mysteries on nine discs.  Almost 25 hours, plus bonus material.",5,A LIFE LIVED ON THE SMALL SCREEN!
