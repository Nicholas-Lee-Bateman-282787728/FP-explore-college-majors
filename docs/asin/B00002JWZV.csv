515087,A3J3Y7OPDDYKH2,B00002JWZV,"Alane M. Downes ""downfall4""","[9, 9]","I watched this movie for the second time (I think) last night with my husband and daughter. The R rating is somewhat extreme for this movie. Aside from Kris Kristofferson's characters rampant swearing, this movie could easily be rated PG-13 and then only for frank discussions about sex between the father and daughter. It could actually be considered a good ""coming-of-age"" movie for liberal-minded families, though even those who consider themselves liberal might disagree with the father's philosophy on life and his advice for his fifteen-year-old daughter.  Of course, if you view the story and follow the plot, you might feel that he was compelled to be deliberate and forthright with her. Unlike many fathers, he takes the time to interact with his daughter and have heart-to-heart talks.  This father also takes the time to cultivate his relationship with his wife.  Bill and Marcella obviously have a very passionate relationship, but alcohol use is very prevalent as well. In any case, the movie is intriguing. I especially enjoyed the young seven-year-old Channe played by a beautiful young girl (I don't know her name). The scene in the treehouse with the young French actor is realistic enough to be disturbing and frightening.  Channe's transition into adolescence (now portrayed by LeeLee Sobieski) is very believable.  Her relationship with Francis, also an American, is so frustrating because both characters are so realistic.  You feel the anguish that Channe experiences having a friend whom most young people would shun, and over time, Channe would choose to shun as well.  Francis is one of those people whom you want to like because he's interesting to be around, but unfortunately, he's also so self-deprecating and self-absorbed and whiny that you can't help but dislike him at the same time.  This relationship between Channe and the effeminate, opera-loving Francis might be enough to turn off many viewers.Channe's adopted brother Billy remains an intriguing enigma throughout the movie and certainly his character could have been fleshed out more.  What we gather is that he's sensitive and kind to Channe, but never seems to make friends.  In France, we never see him even interact at school, or even grow into adolescence at home. If this is an autobiographical movie, then one could at times only wonder if Channe and her brother lead isolated lives within the family.  There are moments of connectedness within her family that do dispel this, however.  When Billy arrives with his family in the United States, he seems unhappy and out of place right from the start.  There is the slightest hint that he might be quietly gay, and therefore somewhat repulsed by Francis' blatant personality.  We experience a moment of unrequited connection between him and Channe's American boyfriend.One could find so much to explore within this movie- the interracial relationship between Candida (their Spanish or Portuguese maid who, by the way, has a lovely, siren-like singing voice) and her black boyfriend, Candida's fear of commitment and total devotion to Channe, devotion that leaves her lacking the ability to create her own life.  Barbra Hershey's portrayal of Marcella, a fun-loving wife and mother with no apparent career aspirations,who turns to alcohol to soften life in Paris as an American in the 60's where it's obvious she and her husband and friends often felt out of place.  What's disquieting is that she experiences the same feeling of being an outcast initially when they move back to the United States.Well worth viewing, though some like my husband might watch the movie and ultimately comment ""What's the point?"" (and rightfully so, since everyone is entitled to their own opinion). This is not entertainment for entertainment's sake.  It is an exploration of relationships.",4,"strong characters, somewhat sleepy story",1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,3817,"['watched', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'think', 'last', 'night', 'husband', 'daughter', 'R', 'rating', 'somewhat', 'extreme', 'movie', 'Aside', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'characters', 'rampant', 'swearing', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'then', 'only', 'frank', 'discussions', 'sex', 'father', 'daughter', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'liberal-minded', 'families', 'though', 'even', 'who', 'consider', 'liberal', 'might', 'disagree', 'father', 'philosophy', 'life', 'advice', 'fifteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'course', 'view', 'story', 'follow', 'plot', 'might', 'feel', 'was', 'compelled', 'be', 'deliberate', 'forthright', 'many', 'fathers', 'time', 'interact', 'daughter', 'have', 'heart-to-heart', 'talks', 'father', 'also', 'time', 'cultivate', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Bill', 'Marcella', 'obviously', 'have', 'very', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'alcohol', 'use', 'very', 'prevalent', 'well', 'case', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'seven-year-old', 'Channe', 'played', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'scene', 'treehouse', 'young', 'French', 'actor', 'realistic', 'enough', 'be', 'disturbing', 'frightening', 'Channe', 'transition', 'adolescence', 'now', 'portrayed', 'LeeLee', 'Sobieski', 'very', 'believable', 'relationship', 'Francis', 'also', 'American', 'so', 'frustrating', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'feel', 'anguish', 'Channe', 'having', 'friend', 'whom', 'most', 'young', 'people', 'would', 'shun', 'time', 'Channe', 'would', 'choose', 'shun', 'as', 'well', 'Francis', 'one', 'people', 'whom', 'want', 'like', 'interesting', 'be', 'around', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'so', 'self-deprecating', 'self-absorbed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'dislike', 'same', 'time', 'relationship', 'Channe', 'effeminate', 'opera-loving', 'Francis', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'turn', 'off', 'many', 'viewers.Channe', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Billy', 'intriguing', 'enigma', 'movie', 'certainly', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'What', 'gather', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'Channe', 'never', 'make', 'friends', 'France', 'never', 'see', 'even', 'interact', 'school', 'even', 'grow', 'adolescence', 'home', 'autobiographical', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'could', 'times', 'only', 'wonder', 'Channe', 'brother', 'lead', 'isolated', 'lives', 'family', 'are', 'moments', 'connectedness', 'family', 'do', 'dispel', 'however', 'When', 'Billy', 'family', 'United', 'States', 'unhappy', 'place', 'right', 'start', 'slightest', 'hint', 'might', 'be', 'quietly', 'gay', 'therefore', 'somewhat', 'repulsed', 'Francis', 'blatant', 'personality', 'experience', 'moment', 'unrequited', 'connection', 'Channe', 'American', 'boyfriend.One', 'could', 'find', 'so', 'much', 'explore', 'movie-', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'Candida', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'maid', 'who', 'way', 'lovely', 'siren-like', 'singing', 'voice', 'black', 'boyfriend', 'Candida', 'fear', 'commitment', 'total', 'devotion', 'Channe', 'devotion', 'lacking', 'ability', 'create', 'own', 'life', 'Barbra', 'Hershey', 'portrayal', 'Marcella', 'fun-loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'apparent', 'career', 'aspirations', 'who', 'alcohol', 'soften', 'life', 'Paris', 'American', '60', 'where', 'obvious', 'husband', 'friends', 'often', 'felt', 'place', 'What', 'disquieting', 'same', 'feeling', 'being', 'outcast', 'initially', 'when', 'move', 'back', 'United', 'States.Well', 'viewing', 'husband', 'might', 'watch', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'comment', 'What', 'point', 'rightfully', 'so', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinion', 'not', 'entertainment', 'entertainment', 'sake', 'exploration', 'relationships']",N/A

It isn't a great movie, but I ended up watching it every time it came on cable and I enjoy the hell out of it, but I'm not sure why.I think it has to do with the charm of Leelee Sobieski, who I had never seen before.  She is a lovely young woman, and she does a very good job here.  Also, I loved the work of James Jones, the writer (From Here to Eternity; The Thin Red Line etc), and I found this glimpse of his life and family interesting.  The adopted French boy, his flamboyant wife, an expatriate's life in Paris of the 60's, their attitudes and dynamics.  It isn't BIG drama, but it rang true and I bought into it.  And, finally their adjustment to American life after returning from France.  The entire cast was fine, and the diverse anecdotes (the treehouse, her gay friend, the adopted boy, the French maid etc.) interesting.Mostly, I think it was Leelee Sobieski and the interplay between her and Kris Kristofferson.  Rarely do the movies show the great love that can exist by daughters for their fathers (To Kill a Mockingbird being the most notable).  Well, this movie shows this most touchingly.  Obviously, James Jones' daughter loved her father, and although the other relationships in the film are interesting and well done, this is the heart of the movie.",4,Daddy's Girl,985737600,"03 28, 2001",2001,1398,"['Ever', 'movie', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'pinning', 'down', 'exactly', 'why', 'how', 'feel', 'A', 'Soldier', 'Daughter', 'Never', 'Cries', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'time', 'came', 'cable', 'enjoy', 'hell', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why.I', 'think', 'do', 'charm', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'Also', 'loved', 'work', 'James', 'Jones', 'writer', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'etc', 'found', 'glimpse', 'life', 'family', 'interesting', 'adopted', 'French', 'boy', 'flamboyant', 'wife', 'expatriate', 'life', 'Paris', '60', 'attitudes', 'dynamics', ""n't"", 'BIG', 'drama', 'true', 'bought', 'finally', 'adjustment', 'American', 'life', 'returning', 'France', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'fine', 'diverse', 'treehouse', 'gay', 'friend', 'adopted', 'boy', 'French', 'maid', 'etc', 'interesting.Mostly', 'think', 'was', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'interplay', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'Rarely', 'do', 'movies', 'show', 'great', 'love', 'can', 'exist', 'daughters', 'fathers', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'being', 'most', 'notable', 'Well', 'movie', 'most', 'touchingly', 'Obviously', 'James', 'Jones', 'daughter', 'loved', 'father', 'other', 'relationships', 'film', 'are', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'heart', 'movie']",N/A

515092,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00002JWZV,Linda Linguvic,"[18, 18]","Based on the autobiographical novel written by Kaylie Jones, daughter of James Jones who wrote ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Thin Red Line"", this is a unique family story.  Kris Kristofferson is cast as the successful writer and Barbara Hershey as his wife.  When the film opens they are living in Paris, and adopt a young French boy who is just a bit younger than their daughter Channe, then 7.  Her parents drink a lot and live a rather flamboyant lifestyle but there is no doubt they love their children.  As Channe matures, we share her ups and downs of growing up as an American in Paris.  Leelee Sobieski, then only 14 years old, plays the role of Channe in her teenaged years.  She develops a friendship with a boy her age named Francis Fortescue played by Anthony Roth Constanzo, whose colorful personality seem to indicate he will eventually turn out gay. When her father's heart trouble surfaces the family returns to the United States.  It's culture shock for Channe and her brother, another interesting chapter in their lives.Produced by Ismail Merchant and directed by James Ivory, the  entire production is outstanding.  The settings come alive as we experience Paris in the 1960s and America in the early 1970s.  And the camera doesn't miss a chance to zero in on the emotional ties between the people, including a housekeeper who turns down a marriage offer in order to stay with the family.  Perhaps the strongest scenes, however, exist between the father and the daughter as they discuss love and life.  Every actor does such a good job that I forgot they were acting and became totally absorbed in the video which avoids the trap of being too melodramatic or maudlin.  It's just a wonderful absorbing story with interesting characters and lots of family love.

The movie trods along for over two hours (but less than three, thank  goodness) and depicts some classic family &quot;issues&quot;, such as  adoption, relocation, dating, sex and death (just to name a few.)  Solutions to these perennial challenges are presented in a straightforward  way, as if to say, &quot;If your family encounters this problem, resolve it  in this manner...&quot; but in contrast to the many similar made-for-TV  series of the same flavor, the solutions wouldn't sit too well with the  Christian right.  I'd go so far as to view this movie as a condensed and  highly liberalized version of, say, Little House on the Prairie or The  Waltons - A model family facing and overcoming the trials and tribulations  of everyday life, but using up-to-date, liberal values.Unfortunately I  consider the film as a whole little more than a recipe job, much like it's  TV models.  It borders dangerously close to the soap opera genre, saved  only by the fact that the characters are somewhat likeable, if not  particularly challenging or original.  Beneath the pleasant shimmer of the  intellectually enlightened, socially privileged and cosmopolitan,  semi-fictitious family portrayed, the movie has surprisingly little  substance.The plot consists of mundane events, and watching the movie  was sort of like spying on an ordinary family as they went about their  hum-drum daily lives.  Difficulties are encountered, but everything seems  to &quot;work out in the end.&quot;  I'm sure the author would like you to  believe that this is due to the high-minded principles of the main  characters, but I suspect it has more to do with careful editing.  There is  never really any hint of real despair, injustice or irreparable injury-  everything works out much too happily.  The real world just isn't that  tidy.The one exception to all this upper-class neatness is a French  teenage boy (companion to Leelee's character) who does manage to radiate a  little color and flambouyance.  Combining a little poverty, some hysterical  personality traits, a musical predisposition, and a blatant effeminisism,  he stands out as maybe the one memorable element in the whole movie.  But  just at the moment when his relationship with Leelee (perhaps the only  interesting relationship in the movie) reaches an important crisis, our  heroine, after a brief moment of distress, mysteriously forgets all about  him and he drops out of the picture entirely.  Perhaps the kid's abrupt and  utterly heartless dismissal best demonstrates the films inability to deal  maturely and honestly with any topic of real complexity.I can't  recommend this movie except to those who enjoy the pleasant spectacle  created by attractive characters as they behave with touching magnanimity  in a priviledged social setting.

515096,A33SFSEVHL5SHK,B00002JWZV,Pileated,"[1, 1]","This film is well-acted, understated, and interesting as an insight into an unusual family's life in 1960s France and 1970s America.  It is not an action movie and it is not plot-driven, but it dwells rather upon the relationships that develop over the course of the early life of a young woman whose father is a war veteran and writer in the style of Kurt Vonnegut (Kristofferson even looks like him) and with whom she shares a unique and rich connection.I'm not sure why those who review this film so negatively would even think to view such a film, since they apparently think that every movie should provide the unambiguous beginning-middle-end of a typical made for TV movie, complete with a satisfying resolution for every two-dimensional character and every predictable plot line.  Life isn't like that for the most part and neither is this film.  When one reaches a certain age life begins to take on the shape of a rich collection of images, scenes, expressions, and feelings---not so much a story arc.

515097,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B00002JWZV,"prisrob ""pris,""","[1, 1]","Kaylie Jones has written a recent biography, ""Lies My Mother Never Told Me' that was spectacular. Her biography of her parents and her mother in particular, tell a different story of her childhood and her life with alcoholic parents.  However, this film does justice to her father, James Jones, known as Bill Willis in this film and played by Kris Kristofferson. Her mother played by Barbara Hershey, gives a complete performance as a mother who drinks too much. However, this is not discussed nor is it supposed in this film.'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries' the title of the film and book by Kaylie Jones, was taken from a conversation that Kaylie had with her father.  He was a glorious man that kept the family together. Kaylie and her father talked together all the time. He was her best friend in one sense. He advised her and was always right, it seemed. Her relationship with her mother is not revealed in this film. They seemed to have a simplistic mother/daughter relationship which was far from the truth. The film opens in Paris, where the family was living, while James Joyce nee Willis was writing and working. Every night the parents would host a party and Kaylie as Channe in this film, would hide in a chair until she fell asleep. The adopted brother is not revealed well. He just simply appears when in reality this was discussed with the family- a little boy that had no home. The James family accepted him wholeheartedly as does the Willis family.  He had some difficulty in school because he was bored, and that is revealed very well. Hidden in a closet because he would not do what the teacher asked.  How barbaric is that. But, you must remember that this occurred in the 1960's.The family moved to the United States when the first signs of heart failure started to show in Bill Willis. He was admitted to the hospital several times, and he eventually died. But, the relationship that Bill Willis had with his children was extraordinary. As you can tell in the film, when he died, he family fell apart. He was this family's world and this film conveys that feeling well.  Kris Kristofferson plays the role with humility and love.  His love for his wife and his children is very apparent. He understands that the family revolves around his life, the writing life, and he tried very hard to give them a life that was full and rewarding.This is a film about family, not a dysfunctional family, but one that has love and laughter and the center is held together by the father. Some of this film is true, and some of it is fictional. All in all the film is well told.
