1504111,A1PWVRF3RIM6MD,B005UZNC9Q,J. Callahan,"[11, 11]","I've been waiting for years to see this, as a fan of obscure genre films.  The message is ham-fisted (as withSilent RunningandSoylent Green), the look is very 1970, and some odd soundtrack choices were made, but it's a bleak film about the collapse of civilization.  It can be viewed as exploitation, except that I find the story's premise completely plausible, and the violence gives depth to the plot and characters. With the notable exception of the scene with the biker gang, ""No Blade of Grass"" is closer in spirit to ""The Road"" rather than ""The Road Warrior.""I've read that this is part of a ""survival"" trilogy in director Cornel Wilde's work, the other films beingThe Naked Prey (The Criterion Collection)andBeach Red.  In a technical sense, ""No Blade of Grass"" isn't the same quality as ""The Naked Prey,""  but Cornel Wilde is certainly a film maker with a strong message who can deliver it in a brisk plot.  Cast members Lynn Frederick and Nigel Davenport would reunite in 1974 for another serious (and also underrated) science-fiction film,Phase IV.The DVD itself has no chapter stops or extras, but the presentation is letter boxed and the source print is good.

1504112,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B005UZNC9Q,Joe Smart,"[6, 11]","This is one of those movies that sounds great on paper--then you finally get the chance to watch it and see that it was forgotten for a reason.  The story concerns a virus that wipes out all grain causing mass starvation and anarchy throughout the world.  It follows one family (including lovely Lynn Frederick from Vampire Circus) as they attempt to get out of the city to the safety of a family member's farm.  The film is certainly dark and angry and makes some strong points about the way some blithely over-consume while others starve and about the dangers of turning a blind eye to pollution going on all around us (although this was made in the days before the creation of the EPA and modern environmental laws).  It also paints a bleak picture of what humanity will resort to in order to survive and suggests that maybe we don't deserve to.  The problem is that director Cornel Wilde doesn't have the filmmaking chops to pull off what he is attempting.  The direction is clunky, particularly during the scenes involving violence which tend to be more sloppy than exciting.  To give just one example, early in the film the family is forced to kill two police officers to get through a road block and escape the city.  The violence is supposed to have an emotional impact--one of the characters vomits immediately afterwards.  But the scene is staged so poorly that it comes off more ridiculous than disturbing--and the stiff upper lip style observed by most of the actors is completely the opposite of what is needed to make the scene effective.  Imagine The Road Warrior made by a stodgy World War 2 era filmmaker and you will get a pretty good idea of what No Blade of Grass is like and exactly what's wrong with it.  It's a shame that a lot of these rare Warner Archive titles aren't available for rental or streaming because many of them definitely aren't worth watching more than once.",2,Forgotten for a reason,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1897,"['one', 'movies', 'great', 'paper', 'then', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'see', 'was', 'forgotten', 'reason', 'story', 'virus', 'out', 'grain', 'causing', 'mass', 'starvation', 'anarchy', 'world', 'one', 'family', 'including', 'lovely', 'Lynn', 'Frederick', 'Vampire', 'Circus', 'attempt', 'get', 'city', 'safety', 'family', 'member', 'farm', 'film', 'certainly', 'dark', 'angry', 'strong', 'points', 'way', 'blithely', 'over-consume', 'others', 'starve', 'dangers', 'turning', 'blind', 'eye', 'pollution', 'going', 'was', 'made', 'days', 'creation', 'EPA', 'modern', 'environmental', 'laws', 'also', 'bleak', 'picture', 'what', 'humanity', 'will', 'resort', 'order', 'survive', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'problem', 'director', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', ""n't"", 'have', 'filmmaking', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'attempting', 'direction', 'clunky', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'involving', 'violence', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'sloppy', 'exciting', 'give', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'early', 'film', 'family', 'forced', 'kill', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'get', 'road', 'block', 'escape', 'city', 'violence', 'supposed', 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'one', 'characters', 'vomits', 'immediately', 'afterwards', 'scene', 'staged', 'so', 'poorly', 'off', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'disturbing', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'style', 'observed', 'most', 'actors', 'completely', 'opposite', 'what', 'needed', 'make', 'scene', 'effective', 'Imagine', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'made', 'stodgy', 'World', 'War', '2', 'era', 'filmmaker', 'will', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'No', 'Blade', 'Grass', 'exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'shame', 'lot', 'rare', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'titles', 'are', ""n't"", 'available', 'rental', 'streaming', 'many', 'definitely', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",No Blade of Grass

1504114,AYMZTWBG0V53W,B005UZNC9Q,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[2, 2]","Cornell Wilde's &#34;No Blade of Grass&#34; is a supposed adaptation of the Samuel Youd novel (which I have not read, yet) about a post-apocalyptic world in which grass is dead, and everything else that is living soon starts following the lead of the earth's green...this is a dark, impressionistic, somewhat bizarre movie. It has some nostalgic value to it, but the back cover of the DVD makes it sound like the picture will show a real bloodbath, when, in fact, the violent scenes are rather tame here. Wilde uses a &#34;flash forward&#34; style of cutting that seems to telegraph the tragedies that lie ahead, but this England-based thriller is more dense, dialogue-driven, and steadily paced than I thought it would be simply from observing the cover of the DVD. Wilde's other films that fit credibly into this trilogy of terror (the others being &#34;The Naked Prey&#34; and &#34;Beach Red&#34;) are more action-driven than this title--there is plenty of gunplay and intense scenes, but they are rather light by our modern standards, and may not shock and revolt in the same way that they once did. However, you do get to see a live baby pulled from the bleeding and syrupy-looking &#34;area&#34; of a female on the operating table, and that right there is still pretty shocking to witness! Eeeck!The Warner Archive DVD is distressingly bare-bones (again, sheesh), whereas an audio commentary would have made this a knockout (as the picture transfer is actually very good). I wonder what Youd (and the producers) thought about the finished film, but really a commentary track done by a British film historian would have been as valuable. It is perhaps wise that Wilde started to hang out behind the camera rather than in front of it (in his later career), as he further began to get out of his own way in his creative endeavors. Yet I think what the problem is here is that the script is too lax, and the genre out of Wilde's ultimate intellectual control. Nonetheless, its analysis of human nature is (sadly) spot on, and the ethics of the movie are far less preachy and obvious than the old &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes. So, again, not an essential, but a pretty good finish to a very Wilde trilogy.
