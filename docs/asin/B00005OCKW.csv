672439,A2X25C107CSLOR,B00005OCKW,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[1, 18]","This Australian film directed by Carl Schultz was much heralded when it was first released, but viewing it now, one can't think why. Based on the novel by Sumner Locke Elliott and adapted by Michael Jenkins, this tale of two sisters over the custody of another dead sister's child, reads as soap opera with melodramatic flourishes and an awful sugary music score by Ray Cook. It's hard to admire DOP John Seale, particularly in the way he first presents the second sister bathed in light, and the child POV's shots, when the large picture is less than successful.There is a certain Charles Dickensien element with one sister wealthy and the other poor, though you can guess which one demonstrates more maternal instinct. Not only is the rich one made neurotically afraid of thunder, she's also known as &quot;the virgin queen&quot;. We aren't given any explaination for her greater wealth, though naturally she gets better lighting and wardrobe.It's to Wendy Hughes' credit that she manages to maintain some dignity, given the obstacles Schultz puts in her way. However, as the poor sister, Robyn Nevin isn't so lucky, which is practically a crime given Nevin's legendary status as a stage performer. Nevin actually had a triumph in a TVM of Locke Elliott's Water Under the Bridge. That story was a large scale exercise in irony, something which is only suggested here in the fate of Hughes. The only actor that is alowed to invest some truth and feeling is John Hargreaves as the errant father of the child, unfortunately a minor role.What is one to think of Schultz when he labours over schoolyard humiliations of the child, played with an adult knowingness by Nicholas Gledhill, has Hughes project her female frustrations onto the child, and has Gledhill lead a party gathering of children in a mock parade of Hughes' cries of anguish? It's all pretty icky stuff and a compliment to no one concerned.",1,a promise is a very sacred thing,1003536000,"10 20, 2001",2001,1903,"['Australian', 'film', 'directed', 'Carl', 'Schultz', 'was', 'much', 'heralded', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'viewing', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'why', 'Based', 'novel', 'Sumner', 'Locke', 'Elliott', 'adapted', 'Michael', 'Jenkins', 'tale', 'two', 'sisters', 'custody', 'dead', 'sister', 'child', 'soap', 'opera', 'melodramatic', 'flourishes', 'awful', 'sugary', 'music', 'score', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'hard', 'admire', 'DOP', 'John', 'Seale', 'particularly', 'way', 'first', 'second', 'sister', 'bathed', 'light', 'child', 'POV', 'shots', 'when', 'large', 'picture', 'less', 'certain', 'Charles', 'Dickensien', 'element', 'one', 'sister', 'wealthy', 'other', 'poor', 'can', 'guess', 'one', 'more', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'Not', 'only', 'rich', 'one', 'made', 'neurotically', 'afraid', 'thunder', 'also', 'known', 'quot', 'virgin', 'queen', 'quot', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'explaination', 'greater', 'wealth', 'naturally', 'better', 'lighting', 'wardrobe.It', 'Wendy', 'Hughes', 'credit', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'given', 'obstacles', 'Schultz', 'way', 'However', 'poor', 'sister', 'Robyn', 'Nevin', ""n't"", 'so', 'lucky', 'practically', 'crime', 'given', 'Nevin', 'legendary', 'status', 'stage', 'performer', 'Nevin', 'actually', 'had', 'triumph', 'TVM', 'Locke', 'Elliott', 'Water', 'Bridge', 'story', 'was', 'large', 'scale', 'exercise', 'irony', 'something', 'only', 'suggested', 'here', 'fate', 'Hughes', 'only', 'actor', 'alowed', 'invest', 'truth', 'feeling', 'John', 'Hargreaves', 'errant', 'father', 'child', 'unfortunately', 'minor', 'role.What', 'one', 'think', 'Schultz', 'when', 'over', 'schoolyard', 'humiliations', 'child', 'played', 'adult', 'knowingness', 'Nicholas', 'Gledhill', 'Hughes', 'project', 'female', 'frustrations', 'child', 'Gledhill', 'lead', 'party', 'gathering', 'children', 'mock', 'parade', 'Hughes', 'cries', 'anguish', 'pretty', 'icky', 'stuff', 'compliment', 'one', 'concerned']","Careful, He Might Hear You"

Briley,"[0, 0]","I have loved this film since it debuted in the 80s and worried about finding it on DVD now that my video would no longer play on my new machine.  Thankfully, I found it, at an exorbitant cost, I might add, but it is worth it to have it back in my collection.  I use it in my writing classes a lot to demonstrate how one can depict aspects of one's childhood, which is something &#34;Careful, He Might Hear You&#34; does so well.  It's one of those stories the Australians do so well on film and certainly leaves a lasting impression.",5,"Careful, he might grow on you",1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,533,"['have', 'loved', 'film', 'debuted', '80s', 'worried', 'finding', 'DVD', 'now', 'video', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'play', 'new', 'machine', 'Thankfully', 'found', 'exorbitant', 'cost', 'might', 'add', 'worth', 'have', 'back', 'collection', 'use', 'writing', 'lot', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'depict', 'aspects', 'one', 'childhood', 'something', '34', 'Careful', 'Might', 'Hear', '34', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'stories', 'Australians', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'certainly', 'lasting', 'impression']","Careful, He Might Hear You"
672441,AXVKMYWNIHK7W,B00005OCKW,"Terri ""3kids-at-home""","[5, 7]","I must say, I have read many reviews on this website about this movie, yet no one has talked about the movie itself, but just about the music and bits and pieces of the movie are being torn apart by most viewers. I saw this movie when it first came out. It's a good story. It's about two sisters trying to get custody of their 7 year old nephew. One sister is single, and in love with the boy's father, and thinks by raising him, she'll win the father's heart. The other sister truely loves the boy along with her husband, they have raised him so far. This sister, who loves the boy, is middle-low class and has medical problems which the rich sister tries to use against her in court. When the rich sister wins custody of the boy, she finds that the boy doesn't like her, and wants to go back to the other sister. It's a real battle, with the rich sister not even considering what the poor little boy wants, which is to live with his other aunt. It's a sad movie, really, if you have kids, it makes you think about what your kids might go through if you don't have a will in tact. Anyway, when all is said and done, dear old dad doesn't want custody of little P.S., and the rich sister drowns in a accident, so P.S. gets to live with who he wanted to begin with! Long time coming you must say. It's a good movie, if you like foreign films. My kids don't like accents, so I have a hard time getting them to watch this movie. I myself liked it and recommend watching it. This movie is set in the 1930's Australia. The acting is wonderful, and the all around story is great. It sure gets me stressed out when poor little P.S tries to explain to the judge that he wants to live with his Aunt Lila. When the judge asks him why, he says Lila told him to say that, but what he meant was Lila told him to tell the judge the truth and tell him who he wants to really live with, but when he says ""Lila told me to say that"", the judge thinks Lila is putting words in his mouth. Which was not the case. Lila truely loves P.S. and has raised him since his mother died.",5,"careful, he might hear you",1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,2056,"['must', 'say', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'website', 'movie', 'yet', 'one', 'talked', 'movie', 'just', 'music', 'bits', 'pieces', 'movie', 'are', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'most', 'viewers', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'good', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'trying', 'get', 'custody', '7', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'One', 'sister', 'single', 'love', 'boy', 'father', 'thinks', 'raising', ""'ll"", 'win', 'father', 'heart', 'other', 'sister', 'truely', 'boy', 'husband', 'have', 'raised', 'so', 'far', 'sister', 'who', 'boy', 'middle-low', 'class', 'medical', 'problems', 'rich', 'sister', 'tries', 'use', 'court', 'When', 'rich', 'sister', 'custody', 'boy', 'boy', ""n't"", 'like', 'go', 'back', 'other', 'sister', 'real', 'battle', 'rich', 'sister', 'not', 'even', 'considering', 'what', 'poor', 'little', 'boy', 'live', 'other', 'aunt', 'sad', 'movie', 'really', 'have', 'kids', 'think', 'what', 'kids', 'might', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'will', 'tact', 'Anyway', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', ""n't"", 'want', 'custody', 'little', 'P.S.', 'rich', 'sister', 'drowns', 'accident', 'so', 'P.S', 'live', 'who', 'wanted', 'begin', 'Long', 'time', 'coming', 'must', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'foreign', 'films', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'accents', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'watch', 'movie', 'liked', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'set', '1930', 'Australia', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'story', 'great', 'sure', 'stressed', 'out', 'when', 'poor', 'little', 'P.S', 'tries', 'explain', 'judge', 'live', 'Aunt', 'Lila', 'When', 'judge', 'why', 'Lila', 'told', 'say', 'what', 'meant', 'was', 'Lila', 'told', 'tell', 'judge', 'truth', 'tell', 'who', 'really', 'live', 'when', 'Lila', 'told', 'say', 'judge', 'Lila', 'putting', 'words', 'mouth', 'Which', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Lila', 'truely', 'P.S', 'raised', 'mother', 'died']","Careful, He Might Hear You"
