They both cross paths and eventually fall in love, and Morgan decides he has to leave because love and commitment scares him that much. Does this even sound remotely interesting to you?If it doesn't, you're right. This movie was made for video and it isn't even worth that. I advise everyone to watch something else. (By the way, has anyone else noticed that Shannon Elizabeth has put a ""no-nudity"" clause in recent contracts - and she hasn't worked since?)",1,1-1/2 stars -- Movies don't get much wacker than this,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,535,"['Morgan', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'dish', 'washer', 'Anne', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'stripper', 'cross', 'paths', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Morgan', 'leave', 'love', 'commitment', 'scares', 'that', 'much', 'even', 'sound', 'remotely', 'interesting', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'video', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'advise', 'everyone', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'way', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'put', 'no-nudity', 'clause', 'recent', 'contracts', ""n't"", 'worked']",N/A
190966,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,1573629383,D. Mok,"[9, 12]","American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth finally gets the substantial role she  deserves -- and though Dish Dogs does take advantage of her marvellous  physical beauty and figure, it also gives Elizabeth the opportunity to show  the comic timing and screen presence previously only hinted at.  Elizabeth  gives the film its best moments, easily:  When Antoinette throws Morgan  (Sean Astin) out of her house after they'd just slept together, and the  final parking-lot confrontation.  Her rapid-fire delivery and slapstick  instincts (and good writing in the scene) make this the gem of the  movie.Astin's character isn't that much different from what he's been  playing for the past half decade or so, and the male characters' endless  philosophical banter gets tiring.  But the sight gags and jokes (the  dishwasher gag, the aforementioned &quot;heads or tails&quot; scene, the  cut from the strip bar to the wedding) work very well, and Dish Dogs also  benefits from the same attribute that made American Pie good, an  old-fashioned sweetness.  Underneath the stripbar setting and the strange  yet intriguing shadowy cinematography lies a basic boy-meets-girl movie  whose only real fault is occasional corniness, and thanks to some unusually  smart and self-assertive love interests for our heroes (Antoinette carries  a gun and isn't afraid to use it), Dish Dogs is an enjoyable movie.",4,Good vehicle for a bright new comic actress.,968544000,"09 10, 2000",2000,1382,"['American', 'Pie', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'finally', 'substantial', 'role', 'Dish', 'Dogs', 'take', 'advantage', 'marvellous', 'physical', 'beauty', 'figure', 'also', 'Elizabeth', 'opportunity', 'show', 'comic', 'timing', 'screen', 'presence', 'previously', 'only', 'hinted', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'easily', 'When', 'Antoinette', 'Morgan', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'house', ""'d"", 'just', 'slept', 'together', 'final', 'parking-lot', 'confrontation', 'rapid-fire', 'delivery', 'slapstick', 'instincts', 'good', 'writing', 'scene', 'make', 'gem', 'movie.Astin', 'character', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'different', 'what', 'been', 'playing', 'past', 'half', 'decade', 'so', 'male', 'characters', 'endless', 'philosophical', 'banter', 'tiring', 'sight', 'gags', 'jokes', 'dishwasher', 'gag', 'aforementioned', 'quot', 'heads', 'tails', 'quot', 'scene', 'cut', 'strip', 'bar', 'wedding', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Dish', 'Dogs', 'also', 'benefits', 'same', 'attribute', 'made', 'American', 'Pie', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'sweetness', 'stripbar', 'setting', 'strange', 'yet', 'intriguing', 'shadowy', 'cinematography', 'basic', 'boy-meets-girl', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'fault', 'occasional', 'corniness', 'thanks', 'unusually', 'smart', 'self-assertive', 'love', 'interests', 'heroes', 'Antoinette', 'gun', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'use', 'Dish', 'Dogs', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",N/A

Matthew Lillard was nothing but annoying, and Sean Astin to me was almost as annoying as he was in Rudy. Brian Dennehy, and Richard Moll were about the only other things that kept this film afloat.
