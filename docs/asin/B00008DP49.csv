So I tamed myself and got the cartoon. I was prepared that there wouldn't be much of Scooby and Shaggy. They run time for the cartoon is 1 hour 6 minutes 31 seconds. Only 14 minutes of the cartoon are dedicated to Scooby and Shaggy. But the point is, it doesn't matter. Yes it confused me at first, but I got used to it after the first 10 minutes. They play the royal food tasters and they will tell two stories in this cartoon which will take the rest of the time. I liked the first story and found the second one quite funny. Although, I didn't like much the drawings. It looked as if a little of a time was spent on drawing. Overall I liked the stories, and I don't consider the time wasted. But the fans of the cartoon will probably find a lot of negative things about the cartoon.

740392,ADLN37B0153N,B00008DP49,Silmarwen,"[0, 0]","I am kind of surprised that this movie was entitled ""Scooby-Doo"" as Scooby (Don Messick) and Shaggy (Casey Kasem) are only in the movie for a few brief moments. Scooby & Shaggy are hired to be the new food tasters for a snotty young Caliph, but they eat all of his food so they have to hide in the harem and pretend to be women. Of course, the Caliph picks Shaggy to be his new bride (his glasses are broken), so Shaggy tells him some stories to stall him and persuade him not to marry him. Scooby tells the Caliph the story of Aladdin/Ala-Din featuring Yogi Bear as the genie and the Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor featuring Magilla Gorilla. Both of them are cute stories that have lots of funny moments and grand adventures - even a little romance! - but neither one of them are Scooby stories.I did not like this movie nearly as much as the newer Scooby-Doo movies, but I still gave it 3 stars because the children I watched it with really enjoyed it. It was fast-paced, full of action and changing characters so their attention did not flag. I found the quality was not as high as what I expected from a DVD as the movie looked quite pixilated. The kids did not notice this at all and thought everything was great.The story of Aladdin is turned into Ala-Din as a woman finds the genie's lamp and rescues the prince from the evil vizier. Yogi (Greg Burson) & Boo-Boo (Don Messick) were very cute genies and I enjoyed watching them try and persuade everyone who got the lamp to wish for food. The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor was pretty funny. Magilla Gorilla (Allan Melvin) thinks he is going on a luxury cruise ship, but he really ends up sailing with Sinbad (Allan Melvin) by mistake. Sinbad cons Magilla into going on a scavenger hunt for all of the treasures he wants to find. It was pretty funny to see what the characters got up to, but the story is fairly simplistic - and well known - for adults. If you have young children who like watching animated feature-length films, then they will enjoy this. If you are Scooby-Doo fan, you do not need to watch this as he is only in the movie for about 10 - 15 minutes tops.",3,"Cute Cartoons, But They Have Nothing to Do with Scooby Doo!",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2130,"['am', 'kind', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'entitled', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Scooby', 'Don', 'Messick', 'Shaggy', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'are', 'only', 'movie', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'are', 'hired', 'be', 'new', 'food', 'tasters', 'snotty', 'young', 'Caliph', 'eat', 'food', 'have', 'hide', 'harem', 'pretend', 'be', 'women', 'course', 'Caliph', 'Shaggy', 'be', 'new', 'bride', 'glasses', 'are', 'broken', 'so', 'Shaggy', 'stories', 'stall', 'persuade', 'not', 'marry', 'Scooby', 'Caliph', 'story', 'Aladdin/Ala-Din', 'featuring', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'genie', 'Adventures', 'Sinbad', 'Sailor', 'featuring', 'Magilla', 'Gorilla', 'are', 'cute', 'stories', 'have', 'lots', 'funny', 'moments', 'grand', 'adventures', 'even', 'little', 'romance', 'one', 'are', 'Scooby', 'stories.I', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'newer', 'Scooby-Doo', 'movies', 'still', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'children', 'watched', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'full', 'action', 'changing', 'characters', 'so', 'attention', 'did', 'not', 'flag', 'found', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'what', 'expected', 'DVD', 'movie', 'looked', 'quite', 'pixilated', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'thought', 'everything', 'was', 'great.The', 'story', 'Aladdin', 'turned', 'Ala-Din', 'woman', 'genie', 'lamp', 'prince', 'evil', 'vizier', 'Yogi', 'Greg', 'Burson', 'Boo-Boo', 'Don', 'Messick', 'were', 'very', 'cute', 'genies', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'try', 'persuade', 'everyone', 'who', 'got', 'lamp', 'wish', 'food', 'Adventures', 'Sinbad', 'Sailor', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Magilla', 'Gorilla', 'Allan', 'Melvin', 'going', 'luxury', 'cruise', 'ship', 'really', 'up', 'sailing', 'Sinbad', 'Allan', 'Melvin', 'mistake', 'Sinbad', 'cons', 'Magilla', 'going', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'treasures', 'find', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'got', 'up', 'story', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'well', 'known', 'adults', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'watching', 'animated', 'feature-length', 'films', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'Scooby-Doo', 'fan', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'watch', 'only', 'movie', 'about', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'tops']",Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights

740394,A3GFUGVR7QPJPK,B00008DP49,wile_e2005,"[1, 1]","OK, so I've always liked Scooby-Doo since I was young, so I rented the VHS tape when I first saw it at Blockbuster almost 10 years ago, wondering what this movie was like. I was expecting it to be more like the fun (if cheesy) 1987-1988 Hanna-Barbera Superstar TV movies (there were a few Scooby-Doo ones as well, such as ""Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf""), but unfortunately, this movie is not up to par with those or the earlier Hanna-Barbera productions.With that said, this entire movie is pretty much unrecognizable as a Hanna-Barbera cartoon, even if it has Scooby, Shaggy, Yogi Bear and Magilla Gorilla! During the nineties, Hanna-Barbera was trying to catch up with the competition (mainly from Warner Bros. and Disney), and began making shows and movies that barely resembled their own distinctive output (""Swat Kats,"" ""Once Upon a Forest"" and ""The Halloween Tree"" especially come to mind.) Instead, this movie looked and sounded more like it was ripping off ""Animaniacs,"" and a bit of Disney as well.Scooby and Shaggy only appear for 15 minutes out of the film's 70-minute running time, and it's in ""bridging"" segments of stories Shaggy is telling to a geeky Mandark-esque caliph. Shaggy doesn't narrate the two long stories of ""Aliyah-Din"" and Sinbad the Sailor, so it's like it goes into a total different cartoon altogether! These two segments are rather long, and drag out, they're not funny, and the Sinbad/Magilla segment has a bad habit of repeating the same running gags over and over (and this was before ""The Fairly Odd Parents"" was created!) Scooby and Shaggy are a tad out of character, seeming even more cowardly than they originally were, and Yogi constantly keeps begging for food every few minutes (he wasn't ALWAYS doing this in the classic years), and Magilla Gorilla has been drastically dumbed down.The music is also out of place. Much of it sounds very similar to the energetic and fun music scores from ""Animaniacs"" (same composer and some of the same musicians), and has those Carl Stalling vibes ala the great Looney Tunes shorts of the 1930s to the 1950s. But Hanna-Barbera usually did not resort to that kind of music style. If you look at their older stuff, the music just simply plays along in the background, underscoring the action, yet still helping move the story along. In this, the music keeps stopping and starting, it has to keep moving with each double take or eye blink, and as a result it sounds awkward hearing it under Scooby or Magilla instead of Babs Bunny or Yakko Warner.Some of the voice talent is pretty good, but it's too bad they were wasted on this movie. This was the final time Don Messick voiced Scooby-Doo, and here it sounds a tad weak compared to the 1980s cartoons. Alan Melvin also reprises his original role of Magilla Gorilla, and many other familiar cartoon voice actors are heard, including Brian Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche, Charles Adler, John Kassir, Tony Jay and Kath Soucie.The sound effects are also often misplaced. For one thing, it doesn't use as many of Hanna-Barbera's famous sound effects, and when it does, they're either sped-up or in bad sound quality. Other times, it usually uses Treg Brown's classic Looney Tunes sound effects, along with the other usual generic sounds nearly every other cartoon produced in 1994 was using, and half the time they are not being used correctly!The animation is also surprisingly sloppy for 1994 standards. I know Hanna-Barbera's animation usually isn't so great, but here it's just plain bad. The characters look really flat and wonky (even Shaggy and Scooby are drawn quite off-model), the backgrounds are overstylized, the colors are bright and occasionally gaudy, and there are a lot of crude computerized pan-and-zoom effects throughout the movie that actually cause it to blur for a second! You'd think if they could spend all that money for the orchestra music, they could spend more money on animation by shipping it to a decent Japanese company like TMS instead of the cheaper animators at Wang Film Productions in Taiwan.So, in short, if it weren't for the ""What a Cartoon Show"" premiering the following year, this movie could have meant the end of the line for Hanna-Barbera. No more Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. No more Iwao Takamoto. No more Hoyt Curtin and the rest of the crew. Even sadder, this was the final Scooby-Doo -related cartoon Hanna-Barbera produced, as Warner Bros. Animation had taken over by 1998 beginning with their excellent ""Zombie Island"" movie. Even if you are a hard-core Scooby-Doo fan, I recommend skipping this one.",1,"""It's time for A-rabi-an Nights!
