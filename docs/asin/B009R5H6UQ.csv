1601466,A2HA61ZOMWDOUI,B009R5H6UQ,Christine,"[1, 1]","I am an avid 'FRIENDS' fan. I slaughter opponents in trivia games regarding the show. Which made me curious to see 'EPISODES' since Matt was one of the stars. I also think British humor is hysterical. ('FAWLTY TOWERS', 'MONTY PYTHON', & 'THE FULL MONTY' just to name a few.) The writing is exemplary. The characters well developed and play off each other brilliantly. I originally rented it on Netflix and watched the entire First Season TWICE in 36 hours. The last Episode I actually watched 5 times. It made me laugh out loud each and every time. The comedic timing between Matt LeBlanc and Stephen Mangan when they are (WARNING**** ENDING SPOILER ALERT****) fighting at the end was unbelievably funny on Season 1.I was waiting anxiously for Season 2.  When it came out I remember something weird about purchasing it (that was several months ago).  But I ended buying seasons 1 & 2 together, because it was less expensive than purchasing Season 2 alone?????However you purchase Season 2, it is well worth it.  I personally think I liked Season 1 better, but not by much.

Matt Le Blanc is a super funny jerk in this, and the whole cast is funny. I have seen several people say season two was weak, but I disagree.

1601469,A3VQLTB724O77W,B009R5H6UQ,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[8, 9]","We are in the Golden Age of television, with great shows of all kinds--Horror, Political intrigue, Action, Romance, and yes, Comedy.  The extended story arcs of shows now allow all kinds of developments of character that were impossible in the old episodic formats that network shows followed so rigidly in the past.  And so, ironically, with Episodes.  The first season moves like a particularly funny Greek tragedy right into the final show; the second does likewise although a little less effectively.  The writing, by  David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik, is superb--a fantastic mix of hilarity and pathos, really smart humor and crudeness, all with powerful plot lines and terrific characterizations.  Although Matt LaBlanc gets top billing, the show is really about Stephen Mangan as Sean Lincoln and Tamsin Greig as his wife Beverly, and these two actors have superb comic timing.  Tamsin is the queen of the aside delivered after a beat, and Sean can deliver even a single word with brilliant comedic inflection--as, in the second season he enunciates the word 'date' like it's physically painful to say.  LeBlanc, far from my favorite character in Friends, proves he can act--he's not just the friendly but clueless Joey here--although he is indeed that--but also at times caring, pathetic, remorseful, sarcastic and more...especially horny.  Although 'subtly nuanced' might be inappropriate, it's a much richer, more complex and realistic character than Joey.  The ensemble is full of brilliant supporting actors, too.  Many have written of John Pankow's brilliant turn as Merc Lapidus, the viciously evil TV producer, but my favorite is Kathleen Rose Perkins as Carol Rance, his executive assistant, who makes every line drip with heartfelt insincerity.  And I have to mention Joseph May as Andy Button, whose silent departure after being fired is one of the great moments of physical comedy.  Episodes is brilliant through and through, and although the second season isn't quite as strong as the first, it is definitely worth your time.  Most highly recommended.",5,Brilliant writing and acting!,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2069,"['are', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'great', 'shows', 'kinds', 'Horror', 'Political', 'intrigue', 'Action', 'Romance', 'yes', 'Comedy', 'extended', 'story', 'arcs', 'shows', 'now', 'allow', 'kinds', 'developments', 'character', 'were', 'impossible', 'old', 'episodic', 'formats', 'network', 'shows', 'followed', 'so', 'rigidly', 'past', 'so', 'ironically', 'Episodes', 'first', 'season', 'moves', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'right', 'final', 'show', 'second', 'likewise', 'little', 'less', 'effectively', 'writing', 'David', 'Crane', 'Jeffrey', 'Klarik', 'superb', 'fantastic', 'mix', 'hilarity', 'pathos', 'really', 'smart', 'humor', 'crudeness', 'powerful', 'plot', 'lines', 'terrific', 'characterizations', 'Matt', 'LaBlanc', 'top', 'billing', 'show', 'really', 'Stephen', 'Mangan', 'Sean', 'Lincoln', 'Tamsin', 'Greig', 'wife', 'Beverly', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'superb', 'comic', 'timing', 'Tamsin', 'queen', 'aside', 'delivered', 'beat', 'Sean', 'can', 'deliver', 'even', 'single', 'word', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'inflection', 'second', 'season', 'word', ""'date"", 'physically', 'painful', 'say', 'LeBlanc', 'far', 'favorite', 'character', 'Friends', 'can', 'act', 'not', 'just', 'friendly', 'clueless', 'Joey', 'here', 'indeed', 'also', 'times', 'caring', 'pathetic', 'remorseful', 'sarcastic', 'more', 'especially', 'horny', ""'subtly"", 'nuanced', 'might', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'much', 'richer', 'more', 'complex', 'realistic', 'character', 'Joey', 'ensemble', 'full', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'actors', 'too', 'Many', 'have', 'written', 'John', 'Pankow', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Merc', 'Lapidus', 'viciously', 'evil', 'TV', 'producer', 'favorite', 'Kathleen', 'Rose', 'Perkins', 'Carol', 'Rance', 'executive', 'assistant', 'who', 'line', 'drip', 'heartfelt', 'insincerity', 'have', 'mention', 'Joseph', 'May', 'Andy', 'Button', 'silent', 'departure', 'being', 'fired', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Episodes', 'brilliant', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time', 'Most', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1601470,A380H0RPMMOG3E,B009R5H6UQ,"E. Von Ray ""adventurer""","[4, 4]","I was shocked at the quality of this series. It is exceptional. And while I loved Matt Leblanc on Friends, I was not prepared to see him as a more fully developed actor. Ok, he is supposed to play himself but while we always knew he could deftly play comedic scenes, we also get to see him in nice dramatic moments. As good as he was in Friends, he is even better in Episodes.And he is not always likeable, although through it all, I found myself liking him even though he does many questionable things.The rest of the cast is stellar, not a weak one in the bunch. Credit goes to the cast but also to the writing. It's a clever mix of British and American humor.The only downside? Once you finish the last episode of season two, you will be wanting more, a lot more.One caveat? Lots of very adult language. Doesn't bother me at all but people should be aware that this is not Friends-like at all. It is very adult, very different.How good is Episodes? If I had to rank an all-time favorite comedy series, I would include Episodes. I don't know where yet but it would be up there.
