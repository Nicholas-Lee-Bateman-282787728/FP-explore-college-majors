Well my friend, you apparently do not know your films very well. The first Child's Play was released by MGM. All the sequels (Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3, and Bride of Chucky) were released by Universal Pictures. Since MGM and UNIVERSAL are rival motion picture companies, there is no way in hell the first film would be included int his box set. So quite complaining!

This set of movies is probably the most terrible series you can buy.  It starts at number 2 and closes the series but they left out the only one worthy of about 3 stars.  Ever since the first it went downhill from a mediocre horror movie right into the slums of just ghastly horrible movies.
