SO SUE ME!"" that's all you can say. it's a little hard to prove this isn't commercial junk. especially since Joey ""the fat one"" Fatone gives such a hammy, Wayne Newtonish, Vegas type, performance as Wolfie Howser.despite acting too old for his age, ""the fat one"" is still funny and appealing. and the rest of the cast is fun. Lanie Kazan is good enough to eat as the hippie, liberal grandma of little red. and there is a hilarious turn by three little girls who play a gang called the ""3 Ashleys"" who play like a hybrid of 'Hello kitty' and the 'Avenue 13 Gang'.sure the film is a little kooky. what can you say about a production that is warped enough to let Debi Mazar do her own singing? Mazar is a terrific actress but she aint no singer. the result is predictably ear piercing.everything about this adorable little musical is a cutie and very ""G"" rated despite a ridiculous ""PG"" (obviously to appeal to older kiddies). the only problem is that Red Riding Hood's love interest is not age appropriate. he's around 17 or 18 and she's 13. an age difference that would make any protective father of a girl cringe.this film was directed by Randal Kleiser. one of Hollywood's better directors. when the material is not up to par, Kleiser always comes through. he's just great.james(the'Alice' fan)",5,"This Is Just One Of Those Movies Where You Just Have To Say, ""I Really Like This, So Sue Me"".",1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,1317,"['i', 'really', 'liked', 'SO', 'SUE', 'ME', 'can', 'say', 'little', 'hard', 'prove', ""n't"", 'commercial', 'junk', 'especially', 'Joey', 'fat', 'one', 'Fatone', 'hammy', 'Wayne', 'Newtonish', 'Vegas', 'type', 'performance', 'Wolfie', 'Howser.despite', 'acting', 'too', 'old', 'age', 'fat', 'one', 'still', 'funny', 'appealing', 'rest', 'cast', 'fun', 'Lanie', 'Kazan', 'good', 'enough', 'eat', 'hippie', 'liberal', 'grandma', 'little', 'red', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'play', 'gang', 'called', '3', 'Ashleys', 'who', 'play', 'hybrid', ""'Hello"", 'kitty', '13', ""Gang'.sure"", 'film', 'little', 'kooky', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'production', 'warped', 'enough', 'let', 'Debi', 'Mazar', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'Mazar', 'terrific', 'actress', 'singer', 'result', 'predictably', 'ear', 'piercing.everything', 'adorable', 'little', 'musical', 'cutie', 'very', 'G', 'rated', 'ridiculous', 'PG', 'obviously', 'appeal', 'older', 'kiddies', 'only', 'problem', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'age', 'appropriate', 'around', '17', '18', '13.', 'age', 'difference', 'would', 'make', 'protective', 'father', 'girl', 'cringe.this', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Randal', 'Kleiser', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'better', 'directors', 'when', 'material', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'Kleiser', 'always', 'just', 'great.james', ""the'Alice"", 'fan']",Red Riding Hood

980051,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000EXDS4S,Monty Moonlight,"[7, 10]","In the real world, a young girl named Claire is preparing to sneak out for the night and meet friends when her babysitting grandmother holds things up by reading a story to her and her little brother. With some mysterious, grandmotherly magic, the pages of Grandma's book are altered to fit the tastes of her young audience. As she reads the story of ""Red Riding Hood,"" we meet a family that parallels their own. Claire imagines herself as Red, a spirited young girl who lives in a lighthouse and is being stalked by a bloodthirsty werewolf as she disobeys her mother and takes a shortcut to her grandmother's house. Red and her kooky, New Age grandmother share the same freedom loving spirit. There's also a fairytale stereotype huntsman whom Red quickly crushes on and is a bit out of place in this otherwise modernized Red Riding Hood tale.It's painful for me to write a 2 star review for a Red Riding Hood film. I personally adore the story, especially when the werewolf aspect is employed. However, this film, while not without a few good points, is more than a little painful to watch all too often. To go by the DVD cover, you might be expecting something really magical and spectacular, and, at times, the visuals do seem to have that look. A large amount of computer effects are employed, especially with the backgrounds and musical numbers. It works for the background stuff. If only they hadn't gotten so wacky with the musical numbers! Some of the cheesy visuals make the numbers in ""The Worst Witch"" look good. The songs themselves are a mixed bag, but mostly not that great. The cast is all over the place, as is the writing. I suppose one of the biggest stars here is Lainie Kazan as the grandmother, though I also found her to be one of the more annoying aspects of the film. In the ""real-world"" stuff, she comes off as a female Ernest Borgnine from ""Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders,"" and in the story she's just irritating. Surprisingly, the kids are pretty good actors. Sam Oz Stone is pretty decent as Red's little brother (and Claire's too), and Morgan Thompson is probably the best thing about this 2 (or 2 and a half) star movie in the role of Red/Claire. She's got ""the look"" and the voice to really take her places on stage and in the movies, so hopefully we'll be seeing more of her in the future. Joey Fatone is also one of the better aspects of the film, clearly having a ball as the werewolf who probably makes this movie too scary for the audience that will appreciate it the most, 4-year-olds.On top of all this, the DVD has no extra features beyond English and Spanish subtitles. The film is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen and continues to be way overpriced at the time of this review.",2,"A Bit Too Over the Top, Even for Me",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,2718,"['real', 'world', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Claire', 'preparing', 'sneak', 'out', 'night', 'meet', 'friends', 'when', 'babysitting', 'grandmother', 'things', 'up', 'reading', 'story', 'little', 'brother', 'mysterious', 'grandmotherly', 'magic', 'pages', 'Grandma', 'book', 'are', 'altered', 'fit', 'tastes', 'young', 'audience', 'story', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'meet', 'family', 'own', 'Claire', 'Red', 'spirited', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'lighthouse', 'being', 'stalked', 'bloodthirsty', 'werewolf', 'mother', 'shortcut', 'grandmother', 'house', 'Red', 'kooky', 'New', 'Age', 'grandmother', 'share', 'same', 'freedom', 'loving', 'spirit', 'also', 'fairytale', 'stereotype', 'huntsman', 'whom', 'Red', 'quickly', 'bit', 'place', 'otherwise', 'modernized', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'tale.It', 'painful', 'write', '2', 'star', 'review', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'film', 'personally', 'adore', 'story', 'especially', 'when', 'werewolf', 'aspect', 'employed', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'more', 'little', 'painful', 'watch', 'too', 'often', 'go', 'DVD', 'cover', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'something', 'really', 'magical', 'spectacular', 'times', 'visuals', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'look', 'large', 'amount', 'computer', 'effects', 'are', 'employed', 'especially', 'backgrounds', 'musical', 'numbers', 'background', 'stuff', 'only', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'so', 'wacky', 'musical', 'numbers', 'cheesy', 'visuals', 'make', 'numbers', 'Worst', 'Witch', 'look', 'good', 'songs', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'mostly', 'not', 'great', 'cast', 'place', 'writing', 'suppose', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'here', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'grandmother', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'aspects', 'film', 'real-world', 'stuff', 'off', 'female', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Merlin', 'Shop', 'Mystical', 'Wonders', 'story', 'just', 'irritating', 'Surprisingly', 'kids', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'Sam', 'Oz', 'Stone', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Red', 'little', 'brother', 'Claire', 'too', 'Morgan', 'Thompson', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', '2', '2', 'half', 'star', 'movie', 'role', 'Red/Claire', 'got', 'look', 'voice', 'really', 'take', 'places', 'stage', 'movies', 'so', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'future', 'Joey', 'Fatone', 'also', 'one', 'better', 'aspects', 'film', 'clearly', 'having', 'ball', 'werewolf', 'who', 'probably', 'movie', 'too', 'scary', 'audience', 'will', 'appreciate', 'most', '4-year-olds.On', 'top', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'film', 'presented', '1.78:1', 'widescreen', 'be', 'way', 'overpriced', 'time', 'review']",Red Riding Hood
980052,A3N61N91YEIZ47,B000EXDS4S,"Valerie Matteson ""Bookaholic""","[22, 23]","My almost four year old granddaughter picked this film as she already knew the story of Little Red Riding Hood from her mom and dad.  I was a little concerned it might be too scary as it is PG but I should have realized that she was able to handle it very well.The wolf is a werewolf.  Lainie Kazan is the grandmother and is reading the story to her grandchildren.  Lainie is wonderful in this!!  If you are over 50 you may remember her singing on the Mike Douglas Show or on Ed Sullivan.While the wolf swallows people whole, it is done by special effects that make it look cartoonish thus not scaring even my granddaughter!  She really loved the whole film and was very enthusiastically telling her aunt, one of my other daughters, how good it was!!If you have a mature preschooler who understands pretend and cartoon violence, they will enjoy this as the singing and fun stuff are hilarious.  There is a precarious situation for the two kids in the film but even that is broken by humor and turning out not to be as dangerous as it looks.
