Will & Grace was always a great show from the beginning and pure magic from seasons 1 - 3. But when season 4 started with Woody Harrelson as Grace's love interest the chemistry and magic between all the lead characters seemed to disappear over night. Will & Grace never really had the FUNNY CRAZY lines but they worked well with what they were given. Instead all the good lines were given to Jack & Karen. Pretty much in my opinion for the shows 8 year run it's always secretly been called the Jack & Karen show. Anyways at this point since Will & Grace weren't even given any decent lines, the below average lines that were given they had to turn humorous which just came off really desperate and made the 2 characters even more annoying then they originally were. With season 5 Grace gets married and well....the show just doesn't have any element to keep you tuning in each week. Every episode of this season is almost a pain to watch. You try and look forward to the next laugh and all you get are bad jokes with bad a delivery from the actors and a lot of empty spaces in-between when waiting for the next joke. Every episode you could already tell this show was on its last legs. It wasn't about making people laugh anymore. It was more about learning a life lesson at the end of each episode. When a show starts to become learning about Life Lessons that's when it becomes like the Family Matters sitcom and SLOW torture. I was in shock that this show went on for 8 years. When the show 1st started and after an amazing season 3 I always thought this show would last longer then the over rated Friends sitcom. But after season 4 it was time to hang up the hat and call it a day. Despite that my review maybe coming off negative i do like all of the 4 main actors and this is Will & Grace so i rated it with a 4 star even though i wanted it to be 3 1/2. But because its Will & Grace i still give it a chance.",4,WOW!!! ....and that's NOT a GOOD THING!!!,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2005,"['did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'magic', 'disappear', 'start', 'season', '4', ""'ll"", 'really', 'FEEL', 'IT', 'NOW', 'Will', 'Grace', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'show', 'beginning', 'pure', 'magic', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'when', 'season', '4', 'started', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Grace', 'love', 'interest', 'chemistry', 'magic', 'lead', 'characters', 'seemed', 'disappear', 'over', 'night', 'Will', 'Grace', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'FUNNY', 'CRAZY', 'lines', 'worked', 'well', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'Instead', 'good', 'lines', 'were', 'given', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'Pretty', 'much', 'opinion', 'shows', '8', 'year', 'run', 'always', 'secretly', 'been', 'called', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'show', 'point', 'Will', 'Grace', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'given', 'decent', 'lines', 'below', 'average', 'lines', 'were', 'given', 'had', 'turn', 'humorous', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'really', 'desperate', 'made', '2', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'then', 'originally', 'were', 'season', '5', 'Grace', 'married', 'well', '.the', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'element', 'keep', 'tuning', 'week', 'episode', 'season', 'almost', 'pain', 'watch', 'try', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'laugh', 'get', 'are', 'bad', 'jokes', 'bad', 'delivery', 'actors', 'lot', 'empty', 'spaces', 'in-between', 'when', 'waiting', 'next', 'joke', 'episode', 'could', 'already', 'tell', 'show', 'was', 'last', 'legs', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'people', 'anymore', 'was', 'more', 'learning', 'life', 'lesson', 'end', 'episode', 'When', 'show', 'become', 'learning', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'when', 'Family', 'Matters', 'sitcom', 'SLOW', 'torture', 'was', 'shock', 'show', 'went', '8', 'years', 'When', 'show', '1st', 'started', 'amazing', 'season', '3', 'always', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'last', 'longer', 'then', 'over', 'rated', 'Friends', 'sitcom', 'season', '4', 'was', 'time', 'hang', 'up', 'hat', 'call', 'day', 'review', 'maybe', 'coming', 'off', 'negative', 'i', 'do', '4', 'main', 'actors', 'Will', 'Grace', 'i', 'rated', '4', 'star', 'even', 'i', 'wanted', 'be', '3', '1/2', 'Will', 'Grace', 'i', 'still', 'give', 'chance']",Will & Grace - Season Five

Season Five of the series was a bit patchy and you can start to see the foundation of what made this show great start to crack. There are some brilliant episodes here so this is not a season to miss. Unfortunately, the characters started to become parodies of themselves towards the end of the season. I loved this show and it saddened me to see its painful decline. Will got insufferably neurotic. Grace had no energy and seemed disinterested. Karen became a shrill buffoon and Jack became constantly hammy. The worst part of this was that they all lost the spark that made their relationships so fun and genuine.Thankfully, the episodes in this season didn't suffer from those ills. The writing still seemed fresh and the characters were still engaging.

I was watching the episode where they mention Debbie Harry and then her scene wasn't even in it!  Then I watched the season finale and it didn't have the scene with Karen and Rosario on the Russian freighter.  Unbelievable!  Then I found out that season 6 is the same way and they didn't even have a recap of the last episode.  Why do I pay almost 40 bucks for something I can watch on regular TV?  The bloopers are hilarious, but $40 for 10 minutes worth of laughs?  Crazy!  It's one thing to release a crappy guilty pleasure like Mama's Family cut up, but when you release a high quality, wonderful, brilliant show like Will & Grace and don't even have the whole episode, it is just ridiculous!  Sorry for all the exclamtion points, but I am just beside myself.  I suppose they won't have both versions of the 2 live episodes either.  One shot for the east and one for the west coast.

998370,ADVRSHBI35H97,B000G1R3A8,"James Donovan ""movie lover""","[11, 14]","Season 5 was the beginning of the end for Will and Grace. This is where it really became obvious that the show was going downhill (and never recovered). This is chiefly due to two things: bad scripts and too many guest stars. To put it quite simply, the show just wasn't that funny anymore. Amusing yes, but far too often I was simply chuckling when I should've been gasping for air after having laughed so hard. But I didn't. It was kind of sad, really. The whole plot about Will and Grace trying to have a child was abandoned after three episodes, but not before they had the mother of all spats that quite simply was too real to be funny or enjoyable. And then it got worse. The addition of Harry Connick Jr. as Grace's boyfriend and eventual husband may have sounded good on paper, but on screen was simply disastrous. Connick Jr. is in fact a very capable and likable actor, but he was completely lost and not very funny. It's not really his fault. The writers didn't know what to do with him, and once they discovered that, kept him off the show as much as possible (a wise choice). Likewise the character of Elliot only appeared once (another pointless character). The whole season wasn't a total loss, as there were some gems scattered in there, but clearly the magic was gone. And the proliferation of ""guest stars"" was too gimmicky and distracting and again not funny, particularly Madonna, in a painful appearance as Karen's roommate!Now as for the DVD, as a few people have noted, the episodes on the set are not the original broadcast episodes, but ones trimmed for syndication. Those who don't watch the show religiously probably won't notice, but for the rest of us, this is inexusable. Most episodes have been trimmed by a minute or two, but some have been hacked, as they were originally either an hour long or one of NBC's ""Supersized Episodes."" In any event, it's an insult to the fans who now have to wait a full year between releases. The whole point of having these episodes on DVD is to have the entire, uncut shows, and to have these shortened ones instead is a disservice to the fans and is just plain lazy. But, unfortunately, unless enough people complain or refuse to purchase these truncated sets, this is as good as it's going to get.",3,"So So Season,  Bad DVD Release",1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,2264,"['Season', '5', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'Will', 'Grace', 'where', 'really', 'became', 'obvious', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'downhill', 'never', 'recovered', 'chiefly', 'due', 'two', 'things', 'bad', 'scripts', 'too', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'put', 'quite', 'simply', 'show', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'anymore', 'Amusing', 'yes', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'was', 'simply', 'chuckling', 'when', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'gasping', 'air', 'having', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'kind', 'sad', 'really', 'whole', 'plot', 'Will', 'Grace', 'trying', 'have', 'child', 'was', 'abandoned', 'three', 'episodes', 'not', 'had', 'mother', 'spats', 'quite', 'simply', 'was', 'too', 'real', 'be', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'then', 'got', 'worse', 'addition', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Grace', 'boyfriend', 'eventual', 'husband', 'may', 'have', 'sounded', 'good', 'paper', 'screen', 'was', 'simply', 'disastrous', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'fact', 'very', 'capable', 'likable', 'actor', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'really', 'fault', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'discovered', 'kept', 'off', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'wise', 'choice', 'Likewise', 'character', 'Elliot', 'only', 'appeared', 'once', 'pointless', 'character', 'whole', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'were', 'gems', 'scattered', 'there', 'clearly', 'magic', 'was', 'gone', 'proliferation', 'guest', 'stars', 'was', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'distracting', 'again', 'not', 'funny', 'particularly', 'Madonna', 'painful', 'appearance', 'Karen', 'roommate', 'Now', 'DVD', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'noted', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'not', 'original', 'broadcast', 'episodes', 'ones', 'trimmed', 'syndication', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'rest', 'inexusable', 'Most', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'minute', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'hacked', 'were', 'originally', 'hour', 'long', 'one', 'NBC', 'Supersized', 'Episodes', 'event', 'insult', 'fans', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'wait', 'full', 'year', 'releases', 'whole', 'point', 'having', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'have', 'entire', 'uncut', 'shows', 'have', 'shortened', 'ones', 'instead', 'disservice', 'fans', 'just', 'plain', 'lazy', 'unfortunately', 'enough', 'people', 'complain', 'refuse', 'purchase', 'truncated', 'sets', 'as', 'good', 'going', 'get']",Will & Grace - Season Five

It's choc full of guest stars (Kevin Bacon, Gene Wilder, Katie Couric, Elton John, Andy Garcia, Rosanna Arquette, Dan Futerman, Minnie Driver, Demi Moore, Madonna, Nicollette Sheridan and last but not least because he was amazing - Harry Connick Jr.).  Harry Connick Jr did such an amazing job as Leo - Grace's future husband.  He was funnier than I thought and really bought something extra to the show.The main focus of this season is when Grace meets Leo and their blosoming relationship that eventually leads them to marriage (the wedding was the best two episodes of the season).  Madonna actually also did a good guest spot in mid season.This dvd is an absolute must for all Will and Grace fans, and even if you aren't a big fan of this outstanding series, you'll still get some laughs out of it, because I think it'd be impossible to watch it and not find it funny.

998375,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B000G1R3A8,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[1, 7]","I'm a Huge fan of Will & Grace. I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. That said this season was about 50/50, and for a show that's previous seasons were 90/10 that doesn't say much. This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married. They chose Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest Leo. This decision threw the show completely off the course, and in my eyes changed what the show was about. Two friends.....It became more about Grace getting married, being a newlywed, and trying to deal with a husband that wasn't around quite so much. Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always. Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUS.The one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series. Mainly the season finale which features Karen, Will, Grace, and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea. Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard, someone might be cheating, and two characters end up in bed together. By far one of the funniest episodes EVER!Good show, and just a ok season.....Still worth the buy!",3,The season the show offically lost its steam.,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,1256,"[""'m"", 'Huge', 'fan', 'Will', 'Grace', 'think', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'said', 'season', 'was', 'about', '50/50', 'show', 'previous', 'seasons', 'were', '90/10', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'season', 'reason', 'shows', 'creators', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'Grace', 'get', 'married', 'chose', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'love', 'interest', 'Leo', 'decision', 'threw', 'show', 'completely', 'course', 'eyes', 'changed', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'about', 'Two', 'friends', '..It', 'became', 'more', 'Grace', 'getting', 'married', 'being', 'newlywed', 'trying', 'deal', 'husband', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'Karen', 'Jack', 'remain', 'hilarious', 'always', 'Jack', 'career', 'being', 'struggleing', 'actor', 'Karen', 'divorces', 'Stan', 'discovering', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'who', 'was', 'suprisingly', 'HILARIOUS.The', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'season', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'series', 'Mainly', 'season', 'finale', 'Karen', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Jack', 'putting', 'Stan', 'rest', 'sea', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'too', 'much', 'two', 'characters', 'go', 'overboard', 'someone', 'might', 'be', 'cheating', 'two', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'far', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'EVER', 'Good', 'show', 'just', 'ok', 'season', '..Still', 'buy']",Will & Grace - Season Five

WILL & GRACE has one of the slowest release schedules so you;'d think there would be plenty of time for adding bonus features (and assembling clips from this season's episodes into three-minute montages is nobody's idea of a bonus). Where are the commentaries by the entire cast? Its just cheap. Now, we find out that the episodes are syndicated versions with minutes trimmed from each episode? Who in their right mind wants to collect edited episodes (especially when the show is playing four times a day on TV in that same edited format). People who buy season TV sets are collectors and want COMPLETE episodes. There's no excuse for foisting episodes that were edited to make room for more commercials after it went into syndication.

998378,AAP2RANG3TTSM,B000G1R3A8,"Rodney Bogardus ""piscean dream""","[23, 24]","As Will & Grace fans, we've been slighted time and time again with regard to DVD releases, whether from lack of special features, from slow release schedules, or from problems with actual DVDs. It was bad enough that Lion's Gate botched the releases for seasons 2 and 3, but now they've done all of us W&G; fans a tremendous injustice by giving us syndicated versions of episodes of our beloved, recently-departed show.That's right, the six episodes from season 5 that are what NBC liked to call ""super size"" episodes (Boardroom and a Parked Place: 40-min, Women and Children First: 40-min, Dolls and Dolls: 40-min, May Divorce Be With You: 35-min, 23: 40-min, 24: 45-min) appear on this DVD set as the syndicated, or ""cut"", versions! When a normal-length episode is cut for syndication, it's not fantastic, but it's also not of too much consequence because not a lot of footage is removed; however, when an episode is extended to begin with and it is cut for syndication and crammed into a 22-minute timeframe, that is disastrous not only because several minutes of footage are removed, but also it runs the risk of the episode being non-sensical because too much footage is removed.With as slow of a release schedule as Lion's Gate has resorted to  since the season 3 DVD set, one would think that that would give them the time to ensure quality DVD releases. That seemed to be the case, as the season 4 DVD set was perfect, but Lion's Gate is back to business as usual: inferior DVD season sets. This time though, they are doing us a sincere three-fold disservice by:1) giving us syndicated versions of episodes on DVD,2) not labeling the DVDs as containing syndicated versions,3) charging us the same price as the other season DVD sets for an inferior product.Like a previous reviewer suggested, it's time to start the boycott. Lion's Gate has to realize that we're not happy about this release, nor are we willing to tolerate any more syndicated episodes on DVD!
