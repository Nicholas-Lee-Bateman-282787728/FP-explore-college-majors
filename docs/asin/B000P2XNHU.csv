1068404,A3JWVMLYSYQOSJ,B000P2XNHU,"AlwaysLearning ""Happy2Be""","[1, 1]","I enjoyed this DVD.  I was unfamiliar with the Yin Yoga philsophy and this was a clear introduction to both the philosophy and poses for me.  In a calm, low-pitched voice, Jennifer Kries explains the benefits of each pose while 2 assistants demonstrate the pose.  She also explains the parts of the body each pose is focused on according to Chinese medicine.  I enjoyed the soothing guitar music which was never intrusive and enhanced the mood of relaxation and emotional release.  Even though Jennifer continually reinforces to begin where you are, I would have liked to have one of the assistants demonstrate the use of props or beginning positions for those who are really inflexible.",5,Combines understanding with the poses.,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,687,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'philsophy', 'was', 'clear', 'introduction', 'philosophy', 'poses', 'calm', 'low-pitched', 'voice', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'benefits', 'pose', '2', 'assistants', 'demonstrate', 'pose', 'also', 'parts', 'body', 'pose', 'focused', 'according', 'Chinese', 'medicine', 'enjoyed', 'soothing', 'guitar', 'music', 'was', 'never', 'intrusive', 'enhanced', 'mood', 'relaxation', 'emotional', 'release', 'Even', 'Jennifer', 'continually', 'begin', 'where', 'are', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'one', 'assistants', 'demonstrate', 'use', 'props', 'beginning', 'positions', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'inflexible']",N/A
1068405,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000P2XNHU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[54, 54]","NOTE.  The yoga sequences on this DVD contain footage which  has previously appeared on Jennifer Kries' Hot Body Cool Mind series DVDs.In this DVD, instructor Jennifer Kries presents Yin Yoga, a style of yoga in which the postures are held at length, usually up to 10-15 minutes.  However, Jennifer and her two background exercises do NOT hold the postures for the recommended length; instead, they hold each pose for approximately 10 breaths, with Jennifer encouraging you to hold the poses longer on your own.  In her Introduction to this DVD, Jennifer calls Yin Yoga the ""un-workout,"" noting that it is cooling, calming, and restoring; she also refers to the practice as ""needle-less acupuncture.""  All postures are performed entirely on the floor.The Main Menu offers the following selections:  Introduction, Workouts (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), Yin Yoga and Meridian Theory Interview, Credits, and About Jennifer.  The three workouts contain very similar postures and footage, but additional poses are added as the difficultly level increases.  However, the workouts would more appropriately be called ""Short, Medium, Long,"" as it is mainly the length rather than the difficultly level which increases; furthermore, Jennifer has her background exercisers display various levels of difficulty in all three workouts.  Throughout each practice, Jennifer talks about the meridian pairs addressed by each posture, noting some of the benefits/effects that you might experience.The Beginner workout is about 20 minutes long and includes butterfly, full seated forward bend, child's pose (Jennifer recommends performing this pose between all of the postures but only shows it only the one time), dragonfly (wide-leg seated forward bend), thread the needle, reclined twist (aka revolved stomach pose), savasana (relaxation), and final meditation. The Intermediate practice comes in around 23 minutes and includes full forward bend, child's pose, saddle (similar to 1-leg reclined hero), choice of shoelace (bull seat or the legs from cow-face pose) or ankle to knee (double pigeon), pigeon, quarter dog, reclined twist, and relaxation/final meditation.  Finally, the Advanced workout is 33 minutes long; the postures include include butterfly, a choice of seal (similar to cobra) or saddle, seated forward bend, dragon, a choice of shoelace or eye of the needle or ankle to knee, pigeon, wide-legged child's pose, dragonfly, quarter dog, reclined twist, dead bug, cross-legged seated forward bend with crossed arms, and relaxation/final meditation.In the Yin Yoga and Meridian Theory Interview, Jennifer interviews a friend of hers who is a shiatsu practitioner.  The interview begins with an explanation of ""yin"" and continues with talking about Chinese element theory and how this impacts emotions.  The conversation then moves into a discussion of exactly how the ""Makko-Ho's"" (exercises to address meridian pairs) target various meridians in the body.  At this point, Jennifer calls upon a male and female dancer to demonstrate some of the Yin yoga postures while she and her friend point out the affected areas of the body.  This segment is 9 minutes long.Overall, I really liked the Yin sequences on this DVD; I find the soothing effects of Yin Yoga to be a nice alternative to my usual hatha yoga practice.  However, the one thing I didn't like is that Jennifer does not allow enough time in each pose.  In order to do the Yin practices the way she recommends (ie, holding each posture 10-15 minutes), you would need to pause the DVD and keep track of the elapsed time on your own, which I find to be awkward.  Still, this is a very good introduction to Yin Yoga which provides a nice variety of options for all levels of yoga practitioners.",4,Nice introduction to Yin Yoga,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,3752,"['NOTE', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'contain', 'footage', 'previously', 'appeared', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'Hot', 'Body', 'Cool', 'Mind', 'series', 'DVDs.In', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'style', 'yoga', 'postures', 'are', 'held', 'length', 'usually', '10-15', 'minutes', 'However', 'Jennifer', 'two', 'background', 'exercises', 'do', 'NOT', 'hold', 'postures', 'recommended', 'length', 'instead', 'hold', 'pose', 'approximately', '10', 'breaths', 'Jennifer', 'encouraging', 'hold', 'poses', 'longer', 'own', 'Introduction', 'DVD', 'Jennifer', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'un-workout', 'noting', 'cooling', 'calming', 'restoring', 'also', 'practice', 'needle-less', 'acupuncture', 'postures', 'are', 'performed', 'entirely', 'floor.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'following', 'selections', 'Introduction', 'Workouts', 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'Meridian', 'Theory', 'Interview', 'Credits', 'Jennifer', 'three', 'workouts', 'contain', 'very', 'similar', 'postures', 'footage', 'additional', 'poses', 'are', 'added', 'difficultly', 'level', 'increases', 'However', 'workouts', 'would', 'more', 'appropriately', 'be', 'called', 'Short', 'Medium', 'Long', 'mainly', 'length', 'rather', 'difficultly', 'level', 'furthermore', 'Jennifer', 'background', 'exercisers', 'display', 'various', 'levels', 'difficulty', 'three', 'workouts', 'practice', 'Jennifer', 'meridian', 'pairs', 'addressed', 'posture', 'noting', 'benefits/effects', 'might', 'experience.The', 'Beginner', 'workout', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'butterfly', 'full', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'child', 'pose', 'Jennifer', 'performing', 'pose', 'postures', 'only', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'dragonfly', 'wide-leg', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'thread', 'needle', 'reclined', 'twist', 'aka', 'revolved', 'stomach', 'pose', 'savasana', 'relaxation', 'final', 'meditation', 'Intermediate', 'practice', '23', 'minutes', 'full', 'forward', 'bend', 'child', 'pose', 'saddle', 'similar', '1-leg', 'reclined', 'hero', 'choice', 'shoelace', 'bull', 'seat', 'legs', 'cow-face', 'pose', 'ankle', 'knee', 'double', 'pigeon', 'pigeon', 'quarter', 'dog', 'reclined', 'twist', 'relaxation/final', 'meditation', 'Finally', 'Advanced', 'workout', '33', 'minutes', 'long', 'postures', 'include', 'include', 'butterfly', 'choice', 'seal', 'similar', 'cobra', 'saddle', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'dragon', 'choice', 'shoelace', 'eye', 'needle', 'ankle', 'knee', 'pigeon', 'wide-legged', 'child', 'pose', 'dragonfly', 'quarter', 'dog', 'reclined', 'twist', 'dead', 'bug', 'cross-legged', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'crossed', 'arms', 'relaxation/final', 'meditation.In', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'Meridian', 'Theory', 'Interview', 'Jennifer', 'friend', 'hers', 'who', 'shiatsu', 'practitioner', 'interview', 'explanation', 'yin', 'talking', 'Chinese', 'element', 'theory', 'how', 'emotions', 'conversation', 'then', 'discussion', 'exactly', 'how', 'Makko-Ho', 'address', 'meridian', 'pairs', 'target', 'various', 'meridians', 'body', 'point', 'Jennifer', 'male', 'female', 'dancer', 'demonstrate', 'Yin', 'yoga', 'postures', 'friend', 'point', 'out', 'affected', 'areas', 'body', 'segment', '9', 'minutes', 'long.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'Yin', 'sequences', 'DVD', 'find', 'soothing', 'effects', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'be', 'nice', 'alternative', 'usual', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'practice', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jennifer', 'not', 'allow', 'enough', 'time', 'pose', 'order', 'do', 'Yin', 'practices', 'way', 'ie', 'holding', 'posture', '10-15', 'minutes', 'would', 'need', 'pause', 'DVD', 'keep', 'track', 'elapsed', 'time', 'own', 'find', 'be', 'awkward', 'Still', 'very', 'good', 'introduction', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'nice', 'variety', 'options', 'levels', 'yoga', 'practitioners']",N/A

She tells you the stretches you have to do and why, but then says ""and you should do this for 5 minutes"" but then shows you the next exercise. So basically, I feel like I either have to write the exercises down and then do them myself or I have to hit the pause button after she shows an exercise and set a timer for 3 or 5 minutes and then look at the next one (either is inconvenient if you think you are going to do a workout).

1068410,A2OWR5G2OAQF7C,B000P2XNHU,Sincerely Yours,"[10, 10]","I am a kundalini yogi and have used Ravi Singh and Ana Brett dvds for my personal use and my health has really benefited.  I got this dvd for the holidays and this yoga really compliments with my personal yoga discipline - it is great for days when you have your period (for women) and when you want a gentle relaxation at the end of a very hectic day.  mind you I am loving this dvd so much I am also doing this in the morning.  I have noticed health benefits within one week of using the dvd.  I highly recommend this form of restorative yoga for those who wants to balance their life.  We all spend too much time racing around and then spend more energy going to the gym ... there needs to be a balance and as much as sitting to read or watch telly is relaxing - this is not the same!the tape covers both theories and practice,  The practice is split into three levels from beginner to advance.  Each has its own poses and variation and I would say there is little difference with the exception of some more advance variations in the advance piece.  Note that you should sit in the pose for at least 5 minutes, this dvd covers it in 10 breathes, which is great for newbies, but I just had the remote to pause that allowed me the amount of time to sit in the pose... this morning doing the advance level (33 minutes on the DVD) with numerous pauses, it took me over 90 minutes and the time just flew by!  I could have been quite happy to sit longer in some of the poses!",5,"Wow, something so simple but the returns are limitless",1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1472,"['am', 'kundalini', 'yogi', 'have', 'used', 'Ravi', 'Singh', 'Ana', 'Brett', 'dvds', 'personal', 'use', 'health', 'really', 'benefited', 'got', 'dvd', 'holidays', 'yoga', 'really', 'personal', 'yoga', 'discipline', 'great', 'days', 'when', 'have', 'period', 'women', 'when', 'want', 'gentle', 'relaxation', 'end', 'very', 'hectic', 'day', 'am', 'loving', 'dvd', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'also', 'doing', 'morning', 'have', 'noticed', 'health', 'benefits', 'one', 'week', 'using', 'dvd', 'highly', 'recommend', 'form', 'restorative', 'yoga', 'who', 'balance', 'life', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'racing', 'around', 'then', 'spend', 'more', 'energy', 'going', 'gym', 'there', 'be', 'balance', 'as', 'much', 'sitting', 'read', 'watch', 'telly', 'relaxing', 'not', 'same', 'tape', 'theories', 'practice', 'practice', 'split', 'three', 'levels', 'beginner', 'advance', 'own', 'poses', 'variation', 'would', 'say', 'little', 'difference', 'exception', 'more', 'advance', 'variations', 'advance', 'piece', 'Note', 'should', 'sit', 'pose', 'least', '5', 'minutes', 'dvd', '10', 'breathes', 'great', 'newbies', 'just', 'had', 'remote', 'pause', 'allowed', 'amount', 'time', 'sit', 'pose', 'morning', 'doing', 'advance', 'level', '33', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'pauses', 'took', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'happy', 'sit', 'longer', 'poses']",N/A

Jennifer gives great info about meridians & how the poses help the body which I wish ALL dvds did, even as an alternate narration choice.For all she teaches, she could have spoke more slowly and made the poses actually last the 5-10 min they should be. Even to save money, she could have only said how to do the pose while she was there, then had an alternate workout choice w/her narration spoken more calmly while only having the backup students hold the pose.As another said, Jennifer still comes off as arrogant but I think it's more that she is an overachiever or a perfectionist. Her energy in these dvds don't induce calm or positiveness it should, especially for yoga, though I am grateful she has brought the mind/body workout with such great production quality to mainstream.
