1528090,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B0078TLRTY,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[1, 1]","Well, that was completely unoriginal and predictable from start to finish.Sigh.Once again, a group of college kids are going out of town in order to research an upcoming paper, and once again the subject of that paper is the truth behind some local legend or other in which many people were slaughtered, and once again the legend turns out to be less legend and more fact and once again they're warned off by the locals and once again they don't listen and once again everyone dies and once again they all make the same stupid mistakes like splitting up and having the killer down and out then leaving without making darn sure he's dead as a doornail and once again he comes back to finish what he started and once again the college kids freak out, reacting as if they hadn't expected him to get back up, after all they hit him over the head with a shovel, surely that should do the trick, right?  And once again, and once again, and once again.Don't young filmmakers get tired of making the same movie over and over?  God knows I get tired of seeing it.  The only reason I keep watching them is because hope springs eternal and I'm just waiting for that one movie that changes things, that tells me yes there is still life left in this genre, and here's what else we can do with it.So far, I'm still waiting.This time it's writer/director Eric England who obviously loves the horror genre, but also obviously doesn't have an original bone in his body--hopefully I'm wrong about that and MADISON COUNTY is just a case of working out the kinks.  It is his third movie, though, so maybe not.The stars actually aren't bad, and try to do the best with the material they were given.  Colley Bailey (DONNER PASS) as James, the one with the paper to write, delivers a decent ""good guy"" performance, even if I felt his character was actually a little too good to be true.  Matt Mercer (ALIEN ENCOUNTER) and Ace Marrero (""General Hospital"") as Will and Kyle (the nerd and the dumb hothead) bring nothing new to their roles, but they also don't make a mess of them either, while the token two girls to three guys, Joanna Sotomura (""Emma Approved"") and Natalie Scheetz (""Siberia"") as Brooke and Jenna are both pretty but, ultimately, useless when it comes to advancing what little plot there is or even providing any real tension.  Jenna's showdown with the killer, Damien, had one single grizzly moment, but was otherwise a waste of time.  Here's a hint: if you have the killer's ax in your hand and he is unarmed, you take him the heck out.  That means a chop to the skull, the neck, even the chest.  His arm isn't going to insure you make it out of there alive.Honestly, the characters here are so dumb it's as if they're living in a world that has never seen a slasher movie.  I'm not saying I would survive in a similar situation, but there are certain obviously dumb moves that you just don't make.  Don't split up, don't offer to traipse off through the unfamiliar woods alone because ""it'll be faster"", don't drop the weapon and run toward the sound of screams, don't drop the weapon because the killer appears to be unconscious, and if the creepy townsfolk keep telling you there's nothing to see here, don't run back into the diner after watching one of your friends getting slaughtered in the woods and expect to get help.  This isn't just horror movie 101, it's Life 101, man.  This is basic stuff that shouldn't take a college education to figure out.  And if these idiots are the kind of brain trusts our American colleges are turning out, there's a LOT of parents out there who need to demand a refund on that tuition.On the bright side, while the plot to MADISON COUNTY is entirely dumb and predictable, it's not a bad looking movie.  The quality of the film is good, the production quality seems high enough--considering imdb says the budget for this was only $70,000.  The killer was plenty creepy--if, again, not exactly original--and the cast actually looked like they could, in fact, be of college age, which is a welcome change.MADISON COUNTY wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't particularly good.  It simply was.  I can find movies just like it without even trying.  And unfortunately that's just not good enough, and  this movie contains not one single thing to make it stand out from the crowd of countless movies with the exact same plot.  If you've never seen a movie where a paper-writing college student goes in search of a backwoods killer legend, this is as good a place to start as any, but if you've already seen one, then you've probably already seen this one as well.",3,Madison County,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,4590,"['Well', 'was', 'completely', 'unoriginal', 'predictable', 'start', 'finish.Sigh.Once', 'again', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'town', 'order', 'research', 'upcoming', 'paper', 'once', 'again', 'subject', 'paper', 'truth', 'local', 'legend', 'other', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'once', 'again', 'legend', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'legend', 'more', 'fact', 'once', 'again', ""'re"", 'warned', 'off', 'locals', 'once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'once', 'again', 'everyone', 'dies', 'once', 'again', 'make', 'same', 'stupid', 'mistakes', 'splitting', 'up', 'having', 'killer', 'down', 'then', 'leaving', 'making', 'darn', 'sure', 'dead', 'doornail', 'once', 'again', 'back', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'once', 'again', 'college', 'kids', 'freak', 'out', 'reacting', 'had', ""n't"", 'expected', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'hit', 'head', 'shovel', 'surely', 'should', 'do', 'trick', 'right', 'once', 'again', 'once', 'again', 'once', 'again.Do', ""n't"", 'young', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'tired', 'making', 'same', 'movie', 'God', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'only', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'hope', 'springs', 'eternal', ""'m"", 'just', 'waiting', 'one', 'movie', 'things', 'yes', 'still', 'life', 'left', 'genre', 'here', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'it.So', 'far', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting.This', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Eric', 'England', 'who', 'obviously', 'horror', 'genre', 'also', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'original', 'bone', 'body', 'hopefully', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'MADISON', 'COUNTY', 'just', 'case', 'working', 'out', 'kinks', 'third', 'movie', 'though', 'maybe', 'not.The', 'stars', 'actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'try', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'Colley', 'Bailey', 'DONNER', 'PASS', 'James', 'one', 'paper', 'write', 'decent', 'good', 'guy', 'performance', 'even', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Matt', 'Mercer', 'ALIEN', 'ENCOUNTER', 'Ace', 'Marrero', 'General', 'Hospital', 'Will', 'Kyle', 'nerd', 'dumb', 'hothead', 'bring', 'nothing', 'new', 'roles', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mess', 'token', 'two', 'girls', 'three', 'guys', 'Joanna', 'Sotomura', 'Emma', 'Approved', 'Natalie', 'Scheetz', 'Siberia', 'Brooke', 'Jenna', 'are', 'pretty', 'ultimately', 'useless', 'when', 'advancing', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'even', 'providing', 'real', 'tension', 'Jenna', 'showdown', 'killer', 'Damien', 'had', 'one', 'single', 'grizzly', 'moment', 'was', 'otherwise', 'waste', 'time', 'Here', 'hint', 'have', 'killer', 'ax', 'hand', 'unarmed', 'take', 'heck', 'out', 'chop', 'skull', 'neck', 'even', 'chest', 'arm', ""n't"", 'going', 'insure', 'make', 'alive.Honestly', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'dumb', ""'re"", 'living', 'world', 'never', 'seen', 'slasher', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'would', 'survive', 'similar', 'situation', 'are', 'certain', 'obviously', 'dumb', 'moves', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'Do', ""n't"", 'split', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'traipse', 'off', 'unfamiliar', 'woods', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'be', 'faster', 'do', ""n't"", 'drop', 'weapon', 'run', 'sound', 'screams', 'do', ""n't"", 'drop', 'weapon', 'killer', 'be', 'unconscious', 'creepy', 'townsfolk', 'keep', 'telling', 'nothing', 'see', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'back', 'diner', 'watching', 'one', 'friends', 'getting', 'slaughtered', 'woods', 'expect', 'get', 'help', ""n't"", 'just', 'horror', 'movie', '101', 'Life', '101', 'man', 'basic', 'stuff', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'college', 'education', 'figure', 'out', 'idiots', 'are', 'kind', 'brain', 'trusts', 'American', 'colleges', 'are', 'turning', 'out', 'LOT', 'parents', 'who', 'need', 'demand', 'refund', 'bright', 'side', 'plot', 'MADISON', 'COUNTY', 'entirely', 'dumb', 'predictable', 'not', 'bad', 'looking', 'movie', 'quality', 'film', 'good', 'production', 'quality', 'high', 'enough', 'considering', 'imdb', 'budget', 'was', 'only', '70,000', 'killer', 'was', 'plenty', 'creepy', 'again', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'cast', 'actually', 'looked', 'could', 'fact', 'be', 'college', 'age', 'welcome', 'change.MADISON', 'COUNTY', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'simply', 'was', 'can', 'find', 'movies', 'just', 'even', 'trying', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'thing', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'countless', 'movies', 'exact', 'same', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'where', 'paper-writing', 'college', 'student', 'search', 'backwoods', 'killer', 'legend', 'as', 'good', 'place', 'start', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'one', 'then', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'already', 'seen', 'one', 'as', 'well']",Madison County
1528091,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0078TLRTY,blackaciddevil,"[1, 2]","I'm all for low-budget films. If you've read my reviews, you'd know I watch and purchase my share of them. For the most part, each one that I've bought has been worth the price I've paid. I don't know what to say about Madison County, though.Madison County tells the story of a group of college kids who go to a small mountain town to interview a man about several grisly murders that happen there. Yet, when they get there, the man is nowhere to be found. The townsfolk act like they haven't seen the man in years, saying that the killer never existed and the murders never happened at all. When the kids start digging deeper for answers, they get alot more than they bargained for.I won't lie to you. Madison County is a fun, competent slasher film. It held my interest til the very end(which is more than what I can say about some low-budget affairs I've seen).  However, Madison County isn't without some glaring flaws. First and foremost; It's, basically, your typical slasher film. There's nothing original about it. It does very little(if anything) to distinguish itself from other movies of this ilk. Second, the storyline is a tired one that's been used time and again. Why can't they come up with a better reason to go to Madison County? Third and last, it's abit too tame for my tastes. I would've loved to see some imaginative kills, you know? Course, I will say this for Director Eric England, he does know how to create atmosphere and tension in his films. It's pretty evident in this film. I think he has the potential to become a much better horror film director, to be honest.As I said before, though, Madison County is a fun, competent slasher film even though it's your typical slasher film.

1528092,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0078TLRTY,Carl Manes,"[2, 2]","James and his friends set out to interview an author who claims that the people of Madison County have been hiding a serial killer in their midst, but unfortunately for them, it's true! Director Eric England has unwittingly unlocked the secret to destroying suspense in his new film MADISON COUNTY. Moody atmosphere and creeping terror need not apply in this boring, generic Slasher. Instead, the kills are committed by a villain who literally walks up and stabs his victims in broad daylight, a villain who doesn't even give the audience the slightest bit of satisfaction by ripping off a few heads or tearing out his victims' throats. MADISON COUNTY is completely uninventive in every way, and England makes no attempt to hide the numerous genre influences that helped to shape the film. Horror fans will easily pick out the direct visual and audio references to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, MOTEL HELL, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and many more. As if things were not bad enough, MADISON COUNTY is nauseating to watch thanks to the constantly-shaking camera.

1528095,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0078TLRTY,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","Have you ever seen a movie where the production stills were more impressive than the movie itself? ""Madison County"" is a lot like that except it's not a complete waste of time either. The horror begins with a scene of a young girl in her underwear waking up in the back of a moving pickup truck. She jumps out, cries for help, and gets hit in the back of the head by the truck driver. Then we're introduced to James (Colley Bailey) and his friends taking a trip to ""Madison County"" to interview an author. James has been exchanging letters with David Randall, the author. The book is about a serial killer named Damien Yule who has killed over thirty people over a few decades, but nobody in ""Madison County"" has ever said a word about it. James wants to get the people's perspective for a thesis paper even when all signs point to him and his friends just packing up and heading back home.I fully expected ""Madison County"" to be your typical B-grade horror movie. The concept art on the DVD box did look kind of promising. A guy in a pig mask killing college kids doesn't sound so bad. A bit ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-ish, but that's never a bad thing. The acting is much better than the movie lets on though. Nearly all of the college students have natural sounding dialogue and the townsfolk from ""Madison County"" are fairly creepy as they should be. It's really only ruined by the old woman at the diner named Erma (Adrienne Harrell). It's as if she starts off decent enough, but has the Nicolas Cage effect and begins to get more and more over the top the more screen time she has.There's actually quite a bit of build up before any sort of killing takes place. There's drama amongst James and his friends, but they spend a lot of time searching for David Randall as Erma tells them he moved away long ago and that Damien Yule doesn't exist. The acting is the only real surprise here though other than the attempt at some character development and slow build to any sort of blood being seen. Everything else is pretty stereotypical. The pig faced Damien Yule takes several pages out of Leatherface's book minus the chainsaw. Every one of the college kids is a walking cliche; James is the brave one, his buddy Will (Matt Mercer) is the nerd, Brooke (Joanna Sotomura) is the really feminine girl who doesn't do anything but cry, her friend Jenna (Natalie Scheetz) is the tomboy who actually puts up a fight, and Brooke's brother Kyle (Ace Marrero) is the brooding tough guy.It's as if everything the movie did have going for it is thrown out the window once Damien Yule shows up. Then it's basically just your below par serial killer horror movie. Leading up to that point though is kind of fun. Pay particular attention to movement in the background. There's always something going on back there. The ending is really bizarre, too. It obviously has to leave enough room for a sequel. All horror movies do that, but this leaves things open while wrapping up another character's storyline and ending with this really awkward shot of Damien Yule done with music video-like editing.""Madison County"" shows potential early on. Its cast is surprisingly decent and their acting is a few steps higher than you're probably expecting. There's this constant ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Wrong Turn"" kind of vibe the entire time. I'd even say there's a little bit of ""Wolf Creek"" in there, as well. But things go downhill fast; characters become more and more overused and familiar to what you've seen in the past, dialogue gets more ridiculous, and events unfold in unsatisfying ways. It leaves several unanswered questions up in the air.

It starts out innocently enough when five teens decide to drive to ""Madison County"" in order to interview a resident who could give them some ""skinny"" into a local serial killer.  The teens played their roles adequately, in fact, better than most of the movies of this genre.  It's when they finally get to Madison County that everything goes awry.  There are similarities of both ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Wolf Creek"" in this movie; however, it just doesn't rise to their levels.The first problem I had was with the killer.  He just shows up wearing a pig's head and starts murdering people.  The lame attempt at any back-story on him just amounts to words--you are never given any REAL facts about him.  When did he start murdering these people?  Why?  What was his motivation?  And then there's the teens.  The group of five early on seem to have more than one functioning brain cell between them--they even DECLINE using the ""old back road, which will save them 30 minutes on their trip.""  And, just when you think they might be okay, they all turn into screaming, gutless, confused, AND--ALWAYS ALONE--victims.And then the movie just ends.  I guess they've left it open for a sequel, but it won't be one that I'll be interested in watching.  Again, the script (or lack thereof) did in this movie.

Madison County follows a group of young college students as they travel to Madison County to interview the author of a book; that book tells of 33 grisly murders committed by local psychopath Damien. Madison County is a decent slasher flick.Madison County's story really isn't anything special; it has your typical slasher clich&eacute;s and characters. The characters also continue to follow the traditional horror format, as in, they continue to make bad decisions; somehow, every single character ends up foolishly splitting up in an area that may have a serial killer and immediately after they were threatened at knife point at the diner. However, Damien's character/costume design is creepy and unique. Damien runs around in a pig head, and his scenes are thrilling and intense; and his kills are brutal and violent, with mostly stabbings occurring. Damien has the potential of becoming a horror icon with a little more effort. Unfortunately, Damien's screen time is mostly limited to the second half of the film. With this, the film sends a Wrong Turn/Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe to the audience, which is good. The music was good, and the acting was decent (for an independent horror film, at least). The ending was little unfulfilling (I'm guessing this was purposely done for potential sequels), yet chilling.Madison County, is a decent slasher flick; it suffers from flaws a lot of modern horror films suffer from, but the sinister villain helps the film a bit. I recommend streaming or renting before purchasing, unless your a big fan of slashers.Madison County has strong violence and gore, and some nudity.

Thankfully it wasn't nearly that bad, but it wasn't very good either.It's the same sort of story we've all seen a million times in various other horror films. College kids drive to some town for some reason or another - for the purposes of this movie its to interview a man about his book which is on a local serial killer - and they end up getting involved with a family of killers. I needed MORE. Something ""special"" for this movie to stick out, and the killers costume wasn't enough - a guy in overalls with a pigs head for a mask.The characters were alright, not a huge background story to them other then one of the girls and her brother.

The past couple weeks the reviews have been easier to find and they have been very mixed so my excitement went down just a little so I decided to rent it before I buy. I must say the movie was enjoyable, the film looked great and didn't have that low budget look to it which bothers me when it comes to some of these movies. The acting was good, the killer looked great, the atmosphere was cool, I like that it took place in the day time. I just really wish there was more of the killer and more gore, I would love to see a Madison County 2 with a higher budget. The movie didn't invent anything new but not all movies have to do that to be enjoyable, give me a cool looking killer with good gore and kill scenes with descent acting and im all in.I look forward to seeing what Eric England does next, Madison County might have to be added to my horror movie collection at some point, give me a 2nd one with a higher budget, its definitely possible with the way this one ended.",4,"Not bad, dont believe the hate",1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,1095,"['heard', 'movie', 'while', 'ago', 'one', 'horror', 'go', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'ever', 'past', 'couple', 'weeks', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'find', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'mixed', 'excitement', 'went', 'down', 'just', 'little', 'decided', 'rent', 'buy', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'looked', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'low', 'budget', 'look', 'when', 'movies', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'killer', 'looked', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'cool', 'like', 'took', 'place', 'day', 'time', 'just', 'really', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'killer', 'more', 'gore', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Madison', 'County', '2', 'higher', 'budget', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'invent', 'anything', 'new', 'not', 'movies', 'have', 'do', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'give', 'cool', 'looking', 'killer', 'good', 'gore', 'kill', 'scenes', 'descent', 'acting', 'im', 'in.I', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'Eric', 'England', 'next', 'Madison', 'County', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'added', 'horror', 'movie', 'collection', 'point', 'give', '2nd', 'one', 'higher', 'budget', 'definitely', 'possible', 'way', 'one', 'ended']",Madison County

1528110,AH0PI2S3O1YDP,B0078TLRTY,MonsterZeroNJ,"[3, 5]","Madison County's biggest fault as a horror film is not what it does but, what it doesn't do. And that is deviate at all from the backwoods horror sub-genre formula. The movie follows the clich&eacute;' blueprint of getting five attractive twenty-somethings to a secluded rural area where they can be placed in proximity with the trademarked deranged locals. In this case they are going to research a book about a serial killer who may, or may not exist in secluded rustic Madison County. Director/writer Eric England seems to have seen enough of these films to put one together competently on a technical level. There is some nice production value for a flick reportedly made for around $70,000. The visuals are fine and creepy and he does create some nice atmosphere and some tension. His cast of young attractive characters are likable enough and there is some blood once things get going. But, England follows the formula so closely that there aren't many surprises. You know the locals are suspicious and strange for a reason and that there really is no question as to whether the killer really exists. His leads while likable are not overly interesting. The locals are generic creepy hillbillies and the villains are never given enough screen time to build their characters and thus aren't that frightening. They never rise above the clich&eacute;' evil redneck stereotype and we just can't generate enough interest in them to care or be afraid. Even the pig masked killer, Damien Ewell, that is the main nut job, is very ho hum even when on the attack. It's as if England thought a pig mask was enough to create character and menace. And, as far as these films go, Madison County is bit too tame. In this case a little over the top would have been welcome as nothing grabs us, shocks us or horrifies us. There is blood but, it is basically some routine stabbings and ax wounds. And since we've waited till the last act to get to the good stuff, we feel a bit cheated by what little we get and how soon it's over. (With credits County is barely over 80 minutes.) If you are going to present a classic scenario like this, shake things up a bit (ex. Cabin In The Woods). Or at the very least, throw all the classic elements at us with a bit of good old fashioned ferocity. For a horror flick, Madison County is far too laid back. No, I don't think Eric England is a bad filmmaker, he can create tension and atmosphere and I've seen far worse then his Madison County but, he needs to learn that innovation is far more effective then imitation when it comes to the horror movies he obviously enjoys. And if you can't innovate, throw some blood and carnage in our faces to keep us awake. Madison County is still a mildly enjoyable horror but, I think England has the potential to deliver much more.",3,"Well done but, routine and familiar backwoods horror",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2798,"['Madison', 'County', 'biggest', 'fault', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'do', 'deviate', 'backwoods', 'horror', 'sub-genre', 'formula', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'blueprint', 'getting', 'five', 'attractive', 'twenty-somethings', 'secluded', 'rural', 'area', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'proximity', 'trademarked', 'deranged', 'locals', 'case', 'are', 'going', 'research', 'book', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'exist', 'secluded', 'rustic', 'Madison', 'County', 'Director/writer', 'Eric', 'England', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'films', 'put', 'one', 'together', 'competently', 'technical', 'level', 'nice', 'production', 'value', 'flick', 'reportedly', 'made', '70,000', 'visuals', 'are', 'fine', 'creepy', 'create', 'nice', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'cast', 'young', 'attractive', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'enough', 'blood', 'once', 'things', 'get', 'going', 'England', 'formula', 'so', 'closely', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'surprises', 'know', 'locals', 'are', 'suspicious', 'strange', 'reason', 'really', 'question', 'killer', 'really', 'leads', 'likable', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'interesting', 'locals', 'are', 'generic', 'creepy', 'hillbillies', 'villains', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'build', 'characters', 'thus', 'are', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'never', 'rise', 'clich', 'eacute', 'evil', 'redneck', 'stereotype', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'generate', 'enough', 'interest', 'care', 'be', 'afraid', 'Even', 'pig', 'masked', 'killer', 'Damien', 'Ewell', 'main', 'nut', 'job', 'very', 'ho', 'hum', 'even', 'when', 'attack', 'England', 'thought', 'pig', 'mask', 'was', 'enough', 'create', 'character', 'menace', 'as', 'far', 'films', 'go', 'Madison', 'County', 'bit', 'too', 'tame', 'case', 'little', 'top', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'nothing', 'grabs', 'horrifies', 'blood', 'basically', 'routine', 'stabbings', 'ax', 'wounds', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'last', 'act', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'feel', 'bit', 'cheated', 'what', 'little', 'get', 'how', 'soon', 'over', 'credits', 'County', 'barely', '80', 'minutes', 'are', 'going', 'present', 'classic', 'scenario', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'ex', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'very', 'least', 'throw', 'classic', 'elements', 'bit', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'ferocity', 'horror', 'flick', 'Madison', 'County', 'far', 'too', 'laid', 'back', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Eric', 'England', 'bad', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'create', 'tension', 'atmosphere', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'then', 'Madison', 'County', 'learn', 'innovation', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'then', 'imitation', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'innovate', 'throw', 'blood', 'carnage', 'keep', 'awake', 'Madison', 'County', 'still', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'horror', 'think', 'England', 'potential', 'deliver', 'much', 'more']",Madison County

Her girlfriend Jenna (Natalie Scheetz) tags along because she likes James. Brook's unlikeable brother Kyle (Ace Marrero) crashes the group because he doesn't like Will with his sister.I think the opening pretty much gives you a fairly predictable plot. The movie has killing with the occasional blood squirt and close-up. It shakes the camera around to create excitement. The story ends without full closure, unless you read between the lines and even then it doesn't explain everything. It lines itself up for a sequel. The film needed some humor in the beginning and maybe create a running joke or some irony with the killing. It lacked good dialouge and Kyle was the only character that was built and that was only because he was a d-bag. Might work as a slasher rental.
