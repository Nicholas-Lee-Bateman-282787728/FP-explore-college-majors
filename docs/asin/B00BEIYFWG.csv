1626324,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B00BEIYFWG,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[1, 2]","If there's one good thing to say about Snitch, it's that it's much better than whoever is responsible for its advertising campaign seems to want me to believe.  The poster features The Rock staring coldly past the camera, a flaming semi-truck careening through traffic behind him.  ""INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS"" reads the tagline, in a font all but ripped from the cover of Call of Duty: Black Ops.  Needless to say, expectations were not high.But despite the cynical, lowest common denominator advertising, Snitch turns out to be a surprisingly competent - if at times uneven - crime thriller.  Perhaps more surprisingly is that despite  Dwayne Johnson's B-list acting resume, he puts in solid performance, effectively tying the frequently unfocused film together.  His character, John Matthews, unexpectedly finds his son charged with distribution of narcotics, and threatened with prison under mandatory minimum laws.  The law, it seems, has no room for mercy where drugs are concerned, and Matthew's son faces no fewer than ten years in prison.  His only alternative is to help rat out other drug dealers, and being a victim of this himself, he refuses.Matthew's struggle to keep his son from being incarcerated eventually lands him in the office of opportunistic DA Joanne Keeghan, played by Susan Sarandon.  He offers to help aid a bust in exchange for the release of his son, and the film begins in earnest.  In order to get his upper-class, white-collar self into the criminal underworld, Matthews enlists the assistance of Daniel James, an employee at Matthews' construction company twice convicted of distribution of narcotics.  Despite James' desire to live within the law for the sake of his family, he reluctantly agrees at Matthews' promise of a heavy sum of money.  Jon Bernthal gives a great performance as James here, capturing the quiet desperation of a man only one step removed from destroying his life, but struggling to keep his family afloat.Were Snitch a less ambitious film, this might have worked.  But the movie has an agenda, and the more it tries to stick to it, the more muddled its plot, and indeed, its morals become.  The explicit goal of the film, much like the 1999 episode of CBS's Frontline it was based on, is to provide something of an expose into the failures of the war on drugs.  While this is a premise I can get behind, one anecdotal account is far from enough to prove the system is broken.  Furthermore, while Snitch displays the government as opportunistic, with a blatant disregard for the lives of the young children it is destroying in the ongoing drug war, our hero Matthews is no better.  His exploitation of James' less than clean past is not only hypocritical, but an insulting violation of employee privacy from the man we are supposed to be rooting for.Beyond that, the film never clearly establishes the tone it wants to have.  Early on, it is the dramatization of true events that it claims to be, but as its running time progresses, it devolves into an unbelievable action film.  The final 20 minutes are comically removed from reality, as Matthews takes matters into his own hands in an attempt to escape the mess he is in, culminating in an over-the-top chase sequence.  Fun?  Yes.  Believable?  Hardly.While Johnson's performance is more or less effective, the film struggles to find Matthews an identity, instead relying on the age old Hollywood trope of ""Dad works too much"".  I honestly don't know at this point if Hollywood actually knows of any other reason that a father and son can be estranged besides the fact that Pops spends too much time at the office. This weighs the film down with emotional baggage it doesn't need, when the situation Matthews' son is in ought to be enough motive for Matthews on its own.Snitch proves to be an effective vehicle for The Rock to stretch his acting skills, but it's far to schizophrenic to be a strong film.  Were it a straight documentary, or a straight action film, it may have turned out to be something more impressive, but as it currently stands, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  Despite some of its more off-putting elements, though, I still found it enjoyable.  If you're looking for a solid recommendation in the movie doldrums of February, you could certainly do worse.",3,"Entertaining, but problematic",1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,4296,"['one', 'good', 'thing', 'say', 'Snitch', 'much', 'better', 'whoever', 'responsible', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'want', 'believe', 'poster', 'Rock', 'staring', 'coldly', 'camera', 'flaming', 'semi-truck', 'careening', 'traffic', 'INSPIRED', 'BY', 'TRUE', 'EVENTS', 'tagline', 'font', 'ripped', 'cover', 'Call', 'Duty', 'Black', 'Ops', 'Needless', 'say', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'high.But', 'cynical', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'advertising', 'Snitch', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'competent', 'times', 'uneven', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'B-list', 'acting', 'resume', 'solid', 'performance', 'effectively', 'tying', 'frequently', 'unfocused', 'film', 'together', 'character', 'John', 'Matthews', 'unexpectedly', 'son', 'charged', 'distribution', 'narcotics', 'threatened', 'prison', 'mandatory', 'minimum', 'laws', 'law', 'room', 'mercy', 'where', 'drugs', 'are', 'concerned', 'Matthew', 'son', 'fewer', 'ten', 'years', 'prison', 'only', 'alternative', 'help', 'rat', 'out', 'other', 'drug', 'dealers', 'being', 'victim', 'refuses.Matthew', 'struggle', 'keep', 'son', 'being', 'incarcerated', 'eventually', 'office', 'opportunistic', 'DA', 'Joanne', 'Keeghan', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'help', 'aid', 'bust', 'exchange', 'release', 'son', 'film', 'earnest', 'order', 'get', 'upper-class', 'white-collar', 'self', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'Matthews', 'assistance', 'Daniel', 'James', 'employee', 'Matthews', 'construction', 'company', 'twice', 'convicted', 'distribution', 'narcotics', 'James', 'desire', 'live', 'law', 'sake', 'family', 'reluctantly', 'Matthews', 'promise', 'heavy', 'sum', 'money', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'great', 'performance', 'James', 'here', 'capturing', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'man', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'removed', 'destroying', 'life', 'struggling', 'keep', 'family', 'afloat.Were', 'Snitch', 'less', 'ambitious', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'movie', 'agenda', 'more', 'stick', 'more', 'muddled', 'plot', 'indeed', 'morals', 'become', 'explicit', 'goal', 'film', 'much', '1999', 'episode', 'CBS', 'Frontline', 'was', 'based', 'provide', 'something', 'expose', 'failures', 'war', 'drugs', 'premise', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'anecdotal', 'account', 'far', 'enough', 'prove', 'system', 'broken', 'Furthermore', 'Snitch', 'government', 'opportunistic', 'blatant', 'disregard', 'lives', 'young', 'children', 'destroying', 'ongoing', 'drug', 'war', 'hero', 'Matthews', 'better', 'exploitation', 'James', 'less', 'clean', 'past', 'not', 'only', 'hypocritical', 'insulting', 'violation', 'employee', 'privacy', 'man', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'rooting', 'for.Beyond', 'film', 'never', 'clearly', 'tone', 'have', 'Early', 'dramatization', 'true', 'events', 'be', 'running', 'time', 'unbelievable', 'action', 'film', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'comically', 'removed', 'reality', 'Matthews', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'attempt', 'escape', 'mess', 'culminating', 'over-the-top', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Fun', 'Yes', 'Believable', 'Hardly.While', 'Johnson', 'performance', 'more', 'less', 'effective', 'film', 'find', 'Matthews', 'identity', 'instead', 'relying', 'age', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'trope', 'Dad', 'too', 'much', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'point', 'Hollywood', 'actually', 'other', 'reason', 'father', 'son', 'can', 'be', 'estranged', 'fact', 'Pops', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'office', 'film', 'down', 'emotional', 'baggage', ""n't"", 'need', 'when', 'situation', 'Matthews', 'son', 'ought', 'be', 'enough', 'motive', 'Matthews', 'own.Snitch', 'be', 'effective', 'vehicle', 'Rock', 'stretch', 'acting', 'skills', 'far', 'schizophrenic', 'be', 'strong', 'film', 'Were', 'straight', 'documentary', 'straight', 'action', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'impressive', 'currently', 'whole', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'more', 'off-putting', 'elements', 'still', 'found', 'enjoyable', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'recommendation', 'movie', 'doldrums', 'February', 'could', 'certainly', 'do', 'worse']",N/A

It is good, but it is good in a true life sort of way and not so much as an action thriller.  There is action, but it comes later in the movie.  The key stressed idea is the laws against first time offenders are unfair.  A young man is thrown in prison after he is set up and framed for a drug deal by his friend and the police.  Since he doesn't know anyone to snitch on to get off he is destined to serve out a ten year sentence.  His friend got off by trapping him in a deal he didn't even want to do, for distribution even when he never used the drug or sold it to others.  Johnson plays his dad as a large business contractor with Semi trucks.  He gets the DA to allow him to ""Snitch"" on the drug cartel by getting into their transporting operation.  Sad to think this is where our legal system has gone to try and look good to the public.  If they are hurting for busts this bad it is time we reform the laws and have them focus on other crimes.

Most of his movies are bubble-gum or unrealistic action flicks. This one, however, was a gritty drama based on true events. The fact that Jon Bernthal (Shane from the best show on TV - The Walking Dead) also had a major part in this movie made it even better.Snitch is the story of an eighteen-year old named Jason who allows a friend to send him drugs in the mail. Unbeknownst to Jason, his friend has set him up and made a deal with the DEA to frame him and reduce his own sentence. Jason's father, John Matthews (played by Dwayne) can't stand seeing his sheltered son locked away for what he calls a &#34;stupid and nave mistake.&#34; So, he does what any father with a lick of commons sense would do -- he helps the DEA go after a member of the drug cartel in order to free his son.Jon Bernal (who plays Daniel, an ex-con who works for John Matthews), is unwittingly involved in Matthews' plan when he introduces him to a powerful player in the drug trade. I won't give away the ending, but needless to say, they both get caught up in the seedy world of the cartel.

The legendary Joe Namath gave it a go.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was a renowned body-builder before he started terminating.  Heck, even Michael Jordan gave the silver screen a try, pairing his talents with Bugs Bunny and his friends in SPACE JAM.  But Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson appears to have some staying power, as well as a willingness to try something different.  He attached himself to THE MUMMY franchise in the beginning, and he's even dabbled in big screen comedy by way of Walt Disney.  In SNITCH, he's an older, wiser father figure who'll stop at nothing to see that his son gets a fair shake.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)John Matthews (played by the reliable Dwayne Johnson) is living the dream: he's managed to turn his former day job as a long-haul trucker into an impressive construction/shipping business.  However, when his son gets caught up inadvertently in a DEA drug sting, he'll risk his family, his livelihood, and his life in order to set things right by cooperating with a powerful state's attorney (Susan Sarandon in a curious short role, almost a cameo) in order to take down a powerful drug cartel.Unfortunately, the premise sounds more exciting that SNITCH ever adds up to, but that isn't for the `want' of trying.  The script - written by Justin Haythe (a relative newcomer) and director Ric Roman Waugh (a relative newcomer to directing, as his background on IMDB appears primarily to be stuntwork) - never eclipsed a solid `After School Special' feel with Daddy Dearest willing to `go the distance' for his son rightly accused but perhaps wrongly prosecuted.  It feels very much like it was all crafted to be a star vehicle for Johnson; if that's the case, they should've given it more teeth.On the silver screen, Johnson has always been an admirable property.  He's blessed with a `big guy' swagger that's equal parts machismo and lovable.  It isn't hard to see him in this role.  He plays the father figure with great ease - no doubt his athletic background has given him ample exposure to kids - and he even attacks much of the story's greater conflicts (grappling with the complexities of a flawed legal system, managing to juggle one failed marriage alongside his new wife and child, etc.); if so many secondary characters didn't appear to be `just showing up' for their paychecks, maybe this smart little film would've had a bigger pay-off.  As it is, Susan Sarandon tries to chew screen in a legal role that mostly escapes her, and TV's stalwart Melinda Kanakarades glides from one distraught scene to the next.Still, I'll give props here to Johnson.  With his track record at the box office, it'd be easy for him to coast in one flick after another that simply applied the same formula, then rinsed, then spun, then repeated.  Instead, he continues to search out one property after another that's a bit different than the last; it'll no doubt make him a better thespian in the long run.SNITCH is produced by Summit Entertainment, Exclusive Media Group, Participant Media, Imagenation Abu Dhabi FZ, Front Street Productions, and Spitfire Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled through Summit Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the picture looks and sounds remarkable; director Waugh's stunt background clearly adds much to the action finish, but much of the rest of the picture feels a bit routine.  As for the special features, there's a respectable handful on the disc: an audio commentary from the writer(s)/director, a making-of short, some deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.RECOMMENDED.  SNITCH doesn't really keep any secrets.  It ain't awful; it's an admirable attempt to give the always charismatic Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson something a bit different to do, which means it may not please his established fans nor woo many new ones to his career.  Unfortunately, SNITCH never rises much above the `After School Special' quality of the storytelling with some predictable developments and performances.  `The Rock' deserved better, but he brought his A game to this B script.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Summit Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of SNITCH by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,'After School Special' Quality Keeps SNITCH From Divulging Any Big Secrets,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,4683,"['years', 'many', 'athletes', 'have', 'tried',

After striking a deal with the DEA, Matthews (undercover) partners with one of his employees, Daniel (Jon Bernthal), an ex-convict with connections to the drug world.  Barry Pepper, Michael Kenneth Williams, Nadine Velazquez, Benjamin Bratt, and Susan Sarandon round out this star-filled cast.Now keep in mind, Dwayne Johnson has been one of my favorite athletes since the first time he won the Intercontinental championship - so I'm pretty biased here.

Without question, this is by far the best acting performance from Johnson to date.  He's certainly no Kevin Costner, but he's getting better and better with each passing role.  For once, it's nice to see Johnson go a whole movie without getting into a overpowering physical confrontation of any kind - meaning it's nice to see a film where he isn't giving bad guys ""the rock bottom.""  In this film, he's actually given a chance to show off his dramatic side, as opposed to the constant wave of brute force.  There's never been any doubt that Johnson is filled with charisma, but if you add this less than disarming dramatic side to his resume, it creates even more possibilities for his future roles.Part of what makes Dwayne Johnson so successful in this role is the cast he has around him.  Most notably, Barry Pepper continues to excell in the majority of his roles - with this role being no exception.  He brings a seriousness to the reality of the situation in this role, a trait that is relatively lacking from Johnson's character.  And, who doesn't want Susan Sarandon as a cast-mate?  Her effortless intuitions take a seemingly boring character and turns her into one of the key components of the plot.  It makes absolute sense for her to play a prosecutor running for Congress - and though her character is a bit ""catty,"" she'd still take in a boatload of votes.This script essentially sends a watered-down message to viewers that if one of your family members does enough for the government, the government instantly let someone out of jail.  Obviously, the ""deal"" wouldn't apply to all crimes, but the underlying principal is the same - that being the government is somehow flexible just because your loved one is in prison.  While that premise is indeed comical at times, it still makes for interesting entertainment.  On paper, the premise of this film seems a bit tacky (even if it was a true story), but the acting execution is clearly the driving force behind the success of this picture.  Drug cartels are no stranger to film storylines, but this one stands out - not because of its story - but because of the emotionally-driven devotion to family and thematic message regarding what one father will do for his son.In the end, this movie had my attention simply because The Rock was in the staring role.  It's a complete bonus to get a fast-paced, entertaining film with a well-rounded cast on top of him in the staring role.  In any event, you will absolutely - without question - get your money's worth out of this film.  Two hours will seem like 20 minutes.

Facing an unjust prison sentence for a first time offender courtesy of mandatory minimum sentence laws, Jason has nothing to offer for leniency in good conscience. Desperately, John convinces the DEA and the opportunistic DA Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) to let him go undercover to help make arrests big enough to free his son in return. With the unwitting help of an ex-con employee Daniel (John Bernthal in a superb performance), John enters the narcotics underworld where every move could be his last in an operation that will demand all his resources, wits and courage to survive.Ric Roman Waugh wrote (with Justin Haythe) and directed this tightly woven tale and has managed to make a focal point of the problems of divorced families (Melina Kanakaredes is the ex-wife and Nadine Velazquez the current wife) in the care of their offspring. Dwayne Johnson finally has a role that defines his talent and he is supported with a terrific cast (in addition to the actors mentioned above) of Michael K. Williams as the head of the US side cartel, Benjamin Brat as the head of the Mexican cartel, Barry Pepper JD Pardo, David Harbour, Lela Loren and Harold Perrineau. Yes, there is the requisite car chases and violence, but there is also a study of father/son relationship healing that is equally powerful. The film is much better than expected.

1626393,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B00BEIYFWG,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[2, 4]","I saw this film during an early screening last year. Gotta say it was good. This movie isn't really typical of the other Rock movies like ""Fast Five"" or ""The Rundown"". There's less emphasis on blow up action, and more emphasis on drama (though there is action).The Rock's acting muscle is on full display though you got the feeling he has physically holding himself back in laying the smackdown (pun intended) to the villains in the movie.Allegedly based on a true story the plot concerns John Matthews who goes undercover for the DEA who has (depending on your viewpoint) set up his son to take the fall in a drug deal. The Dea or more specifically the state attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon)offers Matthews a deal that will get his son's sentence relieved if John can take down a major drug cartel, so John does with any good Dad will do and takes the offer.The Rock really does a good job of convincing us about his character. I mean everybody knows he's a wrecking machine, but here he downplays all of his physical attributes and is pretty convincing as an average joe who is really concerned about keeping his family together.Throughout the movie, he does actually does get beat up pretty well in order for the drug dealers and drug cartel to fall for his act.The movie is pretty well acted on all fronts, and the emphasis is definitely more on the drama than anything else and it does succeed at that level.Benjamin Bratt plays Juan Carlos 'El Topo' Pintera who of the people in the cartel. Jon Bernthal (Shane from ""Walking Dead"") is very good in the movie too as the former runner who has been trying to stay straight, but now reluctantly gets called back to do another dirty deal putting his life at risk.With that said, you can guess how the movie will turn out, but it's a very entertaining movie.

And I don't say this just because his past movies have never received much acclaim (critical or popular), or even because he's my all-time favorite wrestler. I have never seen any of his solo movies, but I can tell from watching him in ""Fast Five"" that he is usually on-screen to show off his muscles and general persona of awesomeness. However, with Snitch, he is given the chance to play a character that is actually deep and emotional, much like the script. Sure, the movie has plenty of action. Of course the script is full of cops, drug cartels, and chase scenes. But this is not one of those stupid Redbox 'thrillers' starring someone who is way past their prime and just needs to retire. The Rock is at the top of his game here. He wowed me with his emotional intensity, as well as being able to hold his own alongside such phenomenal talent as Jon Bernthal, Susan Sarandon, Barry Pepper, and yes, Benjamin Bratt. But when talent like that is in some of those humdrum thrillers, they usually only have a cameo role because the star is the true attraction. Not so here. Each one of the supporting cast has a fleshed out role. We get to know them and enjoy their character's presence onscreen. This allows us to have the privilege of naming Snitch as a good Sarandon vehicle, a very good Pepper vehicle, a pretty good Bratt vehicle, and an absolutely excellent effort from Bernthal. I know that action films and comedies usually get looked over at the Academy Awards, but if my opinion mattered at all during the Oscar season, I would definitely nominate the Rock for Best Actor and Bernthal for Best Supporting Actor.

It seems that every action flick these days pivots around drugs: drug cartels, drug deals, drug deals gone bad, or drug addictions. To me, this is terra incognita, an unknown land, although I am certainly aware of the violence and devastation drugs have caused!This time we have a father who volunteers to go undercover for the DEA as he desperately tries to rescue his son from prison where he landed after he was set up in a drug deal. (When Dwayne Johnson, formerly ""The Rock,"" does a film, it usually promotes family values. One reviewer made the astute observation that while Johnson still isn't an actor, he IS a movie star.)We see:* Dwayne Johnson (""Fast Five"") is the father, completely out of his depth dealing with bad guys (he owns a construction company). The first thing that happens, he gets his behind whupped!* Rafi Gavron (""Celeste & Jesse Forever"") is the son trying to be a loyal friend despite his chum's betrayal...but prison's no picnic!* Jon Bernthal (""Rampart"") is an employee who has a prison record but is determined to go straight.* Melina Kanakaredes (lots of TV) is the distraught mother, frantic to get her son out of jail.* Barry Pepper (""Broken City"") is a DEA agent, smart, experienced ...and worried about an innocent schmuck being used by special interest groups.* Susan Sarandon (""Cloud Atlas"") is a District Attorney running for higher office. THAT is HER sole focus!* Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar in ""The Wire"") is once again, a thug, a ringleader, a killer and an all-around bad guy.In a movie like this, directed by Ric Roman Waugh (""Felon"") we can expect spectacular vehicular mayhem and brutal gunfights, but surprisingly clean language and unrealistically sparkling white teeth.

It is these laws that the kid got wrapped up in and got 20+ years in hardcore prison.  They take every opportunity to bring it back to the forefront and make you notice it again.

I greatly appreciate all the feedback and helpful votes that I have received since doing my reviews on Amazon.com. It is the main reason I continue doing reviews. Last, I want to start a new rating system. As many of you know, my rating system is usually based on 1-5 stars. I have come to a conclusion that on some movies, I will continue to use this rating set up; while on movies such as this one, I will begin using a rating system on a scale of 1-10. So lets talk about the movie Snitch.Snitch stars Dwayne Johnson as John Matthews. I think it is safe to say that Dwayne Johnson can hold his own as an action movie star (as evidenced with the 2010 film Faster).  Now I think personally, the day pigs fly is when Dwayne Johnson will be nominated for a serious movie award like a Golden Globe. But I gotta say, he did some REALLY good acting in this movie; i mean SERIOUSLY good acting in this movie. As a matter of fact, as a whole, the acting by everyone in this movie was good. Benjamin Bratt stars as the primary bad guy Juan Pintera. We also have Barry Pepper as Agent Cooper, Michael Kenneth Williams as Malik (good actor), Jon Bernthal as Daniel, and Rafi Gavron as Jason. The main and supporting cast were really great in film.Now be mindful, Snitch is a MOVIE that is based on real events, but as a movie, it does pose a serious question: If Jason was your son, how far would you go, what would you do? This story really digs deep into the concept of putting his own life at risk to save his son, and for the movie as a whole, it works.I have once again been astonished at the movies I have come to enjoy recently as of late. Snitch is a movie I really have a great deal of respect for. Is it the best movie I will ever see? Probably not.

1626423,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEIYFWG,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.From an outsider's point of view it's very easy to label Snitch as just your average run-of-the-mill crime thriller. There's car chases, firefights, and some pretty intense moments, but Snitch is more than that. It's a tale that outlines the harsh reality of America's judicial system. How first time, non-violent drug offenders are still looked at as major criminals and are denied bail. It's an interesting take on this concept and one I wasn't fully expecting. However, this unpredictability is what really drew me in as the movie progressed and I found myself itching to see what would happen next.You follow the story of John Matthews (Dwayne Johnson), the owner of a construction company who recently found out that his son Jason (Rafi Gavron) is being charged with distribution of narcotics. Although his relationship with his son is a rocky one, he knows his son well enough and doesn't doubt his innocence. Unfortunately, U.S. Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) informs him that there's nothing he or she can do to decrease his son's sentence. As a final act of desperation, John tries to personally go under cover which doesn't end well. This forces Joanna to agree to shorten Jason's sentence if John takes down a high-ranking drug dealer known as Malik (Michael K. Williams).While the story being told is an intriguing one, Snitch suffers from some bad pacing and an anticlimactic ending. You see, John wouldn't have been able to meet Malik if it was't for an employee, and ex-con, by the name of Daniel James (Jon Bernthal). While I did love Daniel as a character and I thought his story was interesting, the inclusion of his personal life always seemed to bring the movie to a screeching halt. The transition between John and Daniel was never as smooth as it should have been and while Daniel's story may have added some relatability for some viewers, it was a little generic and unnecessary. A simple introduction and a brief overview of his history would have sufficed.As far as the ending goes, I just found it to be unsatisfying. Part of this is due to the terrible pacing in the film's final 15-20 minutes, but how they arrived at the scenario didn't help either. The only word I can use to describe it is rushed. It's almost as if they realized that they were closing in on that two hour mark and decided they needed to wrap it up as quick as possible. As I already mentioned, the film's pacing up to this point was never perfect, but I truly believe that if they had cut out some of Daniel's side story they could have allowed themselves some breathing room for the ending. Part of me feels like they tried to cram too much stuff into one little package and it wound up hurting the final product.Now this is a very rare occurrence, but I actually wasn't too fond of the casting in Snitch. With the exception of Johnson, Bernthal, Sarandon, and Williams, I found that majority of the cast was very... average. Barry Pepper, who plays Agent Cooper, was alright, but his performance wasn't terribly memorable. Then you had Benjamin Bratt, Melina Kanakaredes, and Nadine Velazquez who were all just there. They didn't leave a lasting impression and their presence never felt important. Rafi Gavron wasn't too bad, but he didn't get enough screen time to make much of a difference. Out of the entire cast Johnson and Bernthal stood out the most and they were great in the scenes that they were in together.Finally, the score, composed by Antonio Pinto, was very well done. While most crime thrillers have these over-the-top compositions that are loud and, occasionally, obnoxious, Pinto's compositions provided a somber eeriness which seemed to fit perfectly with the tone of the film. There were a few rough spots where a piece felt slightly unfitting for its accompanied scene, but nothing that ruined the experience or detracted from the score's beauty. I was honestly really surprised at how much I enjoyed it and I look forward to listening to it as a standalone score.Overall Score: 7.25/10 - Snitch is one of those crime thrillers that tries to go beyond the accepted norm of the genre. Unfortunately, it tries to take on too much at once which ultimately leaves the ending feeling both rushed and unsatisfying. Still, it's an enjoyable film from start to finish and the social commentary was a nice touch. I would recommend giving it a shot if you had your eye on it when it was in theaters.",4,"7.25/10 - Good story, poor pacing",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,4470,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.From', 'outsider', 'point', 'view', 'very', 'easy', 'label', 'Snitch', 'just', 'average', 'run-of-the-mill', 'crime', 'thriller', 'car', 'chases', 'firefights', 'pretty', 'intense', 'moments', 'Snitch', 'more', 'tale', 'harsh', 'reality', 'America', 'judicial', 'system', 'How', 'first', 'time', 'non-violent', 'drug', 'offenders', 'are', 'still', 'looked', 'major', 'criminals', 'are', 'denied', 'bail', 'interesting', 'take', 'concept', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'expecting', 'However', 'unpredictability', 'what', 'really', 'drew', 'movie', 'progressed', 'found', 'itching', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next.You', 'follow', 'story', 'John', 'Matthews', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'owner', 'construction', 'company', 'who', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'son', 'Jason', 'Rafi', 'Gavron', 'being', 'charged', 'distribution', 'narcotics', 'relationship', 'son', 'rocky', 'one', 'son', 'well', 'enough', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'innocence', 'Unfortunately', 'U.S.', 'Attorney', 'Joanne', 'Keeghan', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'decrease', 'son', 'sentence', 'final', 'act', 'desperation', 'John', 'personally', 'go', 'cover', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'Joanna', 'agree', 'shorten', 'Jason', 'sentence', 'John', 'down', 'high-ranking', 'drug', 'dealer', 'known', 'Malik', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'intriguing', 'one', 'Snitch', 'suffers', 'bad', 'pacing', 'anticlimactic', 'ending', 'see', 'John', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'meet', 'Malik', 'employee', 'ex-con', 'name', 'Daniel', 'James', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'did', 'love', 'Daniel', 'character', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'inclusion', 'personal', 'life', 'always', 'seemed', 'bring', 'movie', 'screeching', 'halt', 'transition', 'John', 'Daniel', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'smooth', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Daniel', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'added', 'relatability', 'viewers', 'was', 'little', 'generic', 'unnecessary', 'simple', 'introduction', 'brief', 'overview', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed.As', 'far', 'ending', 'just', 'found', 'be', 'unsatisfying', 'Part', 'due', 'terrible', 'pacing', 'film', 'final', '15-20', 'minutes', 'how', 'arrived', 'scenario', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'only', 'word', 'can', 'use', 'describe', 'rushed', 'almost', 'realized', 'were', 'closing', 'two', 'hour', 'mark', 'decided', 'needed', 'wrap', 'up', 'as', 'quick', 'possible', 'already', 'mentioned', 'film', 'pacing', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'never', 'perfect', 'truly', 'believe', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'Daniel', 'side', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'allowed', 'breathing', 'room', 'ending', 'Part', 'feels', 'tried', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'stuff', 'one', 'little', 'package', 'wound', 'up', 'hurting', 'final', 'product.Now', 'very', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'fond', 'casting', 'Snitch', 'exception', 'Johnson', 'Bernthal', 'Sarandon', 'Williams', 'found', 'majority', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'average', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'who', 'Agent', 'Cooper', 'was', 'alright', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'memorable', 'Then', 'had', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Melina', 'Kanakaredes', 'Nadine', 'Velazquez', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'presence', 'never', 'felt', 'important', 'Rafi', 'Gavron', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'entire', 'cast', 'Johnson', 'Bernthal', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'were', 'great', 'scenes', 'were', 'together.Finally', 'score', 'composed', 'Antonio', 'Pinto', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'have', 'over-the-top', 'compositions', 'are', 'loud', 'occasionally', 'obnoxious', 'Pinto', 'compositions', 'provided', 'somber', 'eeriness', 'seemed', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'film', 'were', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'where', 'piece', 'felt', 'slightly', 'unfitting', 'accompanied', 'scene', 'nothing', 'ruined', 'experience', 'detracted', 'score', 'beauty', 'was', 'honestly', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'look', 'forward', 'listening', 'standalone', 'score.Overall', 'Score', '7.25/10', 'Snitch', 'one', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'go', 'accepted', 'norm', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'once', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'feeling', 'rushed', 'unsatisfying', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'shot', 'had', 'eye', 'when', 'was', 'theaters']",N/A

The problem with this movie is the plot holes that give premise to the story itself, including the numerous actions taken by both the father and the ex-con he partners up with that realistically would not have happened.  Both the actions taken by the U.S. Attorney and DEA seem to be have been written without any consultation on what goes on in reality as both their actions would not have gone about in the way that it did in the movie.  One of the glaring things they got wrong was US Attorney's are appointed and not elected like they portrayed in the movie and judges have discretion to go below mandatory minimums.  I understand the message concerning election year politics playing a role in drug enforcement, but really..get the basic facts accurate.

I doubt that anyone would say less than anything but when push comes to shove would you? That's the question faced by John Matthews (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) in SNITCH.John's son Jason has lived with his mother ever since the divorce of his parents. When a friend insists on shipping him a box full of Ecstasy to hold for him the DEA breaks down the door and arrests him for possession with intent to sell. Mandatory drug laws (yes this is based not only on a true story but real laws now in effect) require that unless he co-operates by implicating someone else in the drug trade he could face up to 10 years in jail. Unfortunately the only person Jason knew was his friend who it turns out was caught before he could ship the drugs and set Jason up using this trade deal.When John goes to DA Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) and asks for mercy she explains that there is nothing she can do, the laws are set in stone. Unless Jason helps catch someone else he will serve the full term. When John offers to take his place, to find a way to help them catch dealers she turns him away. Refusing to let his son set in prison for a good portion of his life, John sets out to find a dealer on his own. The result is his being beaten and nearly shot.Keeghan decides to take John up on his offer but only if he can get her a major player. John owns a construction company and looking through the applications of his employees he finds that Daniel James (Jon Bernthal) did time for distribution. He asks him to do nothing more than introduce him to a major dealer and is turned down. The need for money supercedes Daniel's decision to become straight and he sets John up with Malik.An initial run for drugs gets the attention of the cartel supplying Malik and they decide to use John themselves. When the DEA agent in charge (Barry Pepper) decides to bypass arresting Malik on the chance he can catch the cartel's main man in the states, John is left between the two warring factions of the DEA and the cartel with little thought to his safety or the release of his son. It is now up to John to find a solution that will handle all players involved in this situation and get him what he needs to have his son free.Dwayne Johnson has come a long way from his early films that relied solely on his action and physical skills. Slowly he's been developing acting chops that might never qualify him for an Oscar nomination but will elevate him from little more than a muscle bound action star. In truth this film is more about acting than action with almost zero fisticuffs for Johnson with the action not beginning until the last half hour of the film. It doesn't disappoint though as the story itself is engrossing and quite frightening to consider if you have children.The rest of the cast complements Johnson in the lead with Sarandon's portrayal of a DA seeking political gain at all costs making her someone to root for and detest at the same time. The best surprise of all is Bernthal who proves that the work he did on THE WALKING DEAD wasn't all he is capable of doing. As another father under different circumstances but caring for his son as well, his character is more sympathetic than the good guys.The craftsmanship behind the camera is as qualified as that seen in front. The photography is well managed with cameras catching all the action and rarely (if ever) resorting to bouncing hand held shots or close ups during the few action scenes. Director Ric Roman Waugh, who directed the well made but little seen film FELON, does a great job here and shows promise.All in all this was a good movie that deserves more attention than it received in theaters. That could have been because it was marketed as an action packed slam bang film when in truth it's a solid drama.

While this film is billed as an action film it does have more development than his usual films and he carries it off well.It's apparently inspired by true events, although I have no idea how closely it relates to those vents, but the film tells the story of a man who's son gets arrested for a open and shut drugs trafficking case. In an effort to free his son he makes a deal with the DA to exchange hi sentence for bigger fish. Naturally things get out of hand and that's where the action element of the film comes in.It's more of a thriller than all out action and unusually you don't get to see any hand to hand action that he's so good at. He plays the businessman in over his head well, but the film isn't carried by him alone, the rest of the cast are all excellent in portraying the range of characters on both sides of the drugs business.The downside is that while it's a solid film, it's not particularly original and there's no real surprises along the way.

Well, maybe, but I doubt those events included a well-staged car chase including a giant Kenworth semi, shotguns and blazing automatic weapons.  The basis of the film is an honest political point of how nave, young drug offenders can get years in the federal slammer.In this case, we're talking about 18 year old Jason (Rafi Gavron) the estranged son of John (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and his ex, Sylvie (Melina Kanakaredes).  John is remarried with a young daughter and is a successful owner of a construction company.  Jason is arrested for accepting a package containing a large quantity of Ecstasy to help out a friend.  Because of the quantity he faces a mandatory sentence of 35 years unless he can lead prosecutors and the DEA to bigger fish.  The problem is that he doesn't know anyone other than the friend who already ratted him out.So daddy steps in and convinces the prosecutor and wannabe politician Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) that he will infiltrate the local kingpin dealer's gang and get the deal for his kid.  She agrees but the imminent arrest is stopped when the head of the Mexican cartel (Benjamin Bratt) can be captured in the near future.While this is a fairly formulaic film of this type, we do get a different side of Johnson.  Gone are the usual head beating action scenes.  In fact in an early attempt to score some drugs in the hood, he gets his own butt beat pretty bad.  In another film, he would have had them for lunch.  Barry Pepper turns in a nice below-the-radar performance as the undercover DEA leader and Jon Bernthal proves there is life after TV's ""The Walking Dead,"" as a helpful ex-con and employee of John's.The Lionsgate/Summit Blu ray comes in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is shot digitally and everything looks very good.  Excellent contrast even with night scenes.  With only a couple exceptions the film looks sharp and well defined.  The audio is stellar with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 lossless mix.  There is one scene when John and Daniel (Bernthal) go get their first shipment from the cartel in El Paso.  When a rival gang attempts a hijacking a massive shoot out occurs as John maneuvers his 18-wheeler around and through whatever is in his path.  Bullets are flying everywhere and like John and Daniel, you feel like your in the middle.  Nice use of the subs and with the excellent musical score.  Extras include a commentary track with director Ric Roman Waugh and editor Jonathan Chibnall, a 50 minute ""making of"" doc, some deleted scenes and a trailer.

He learns that his son (who he doesn&#8217;t have the best relationship with) has been arrested for drug trafficking.  The son could go free if he tells on his friend, but he opts not to do that, despite the fact that he was set up.  The son still refuses to snitch although he knows the amount of time he would have to spend in jail under the mandatory minimum sentence laws.  Distraught over this, John goes to the DEA and the DA to convince them to let him go undercover to bust a drug cartel in exchange for minimizing and eliminating his son&#8217;s sentence.The thing I appreciate about Dwayne&#8217;s role in this movie is that he&#8217;s playing a common man.  He&#8217;s not a crook or a cop; he&#8217;s just a common man who&#8217;s worked hard for what he&#8217;s got, and he just wants to find a way to help his son.  In addition, when he&#8217;s decides to go undercover, he does display common traits&#8212;slight anxiety and a little bit of awkwardness that was relatable if you are a civilian indulging in different works.  He didn&#8217;t try and be this big super hero.In a sense, Snitch goes a bit deeper than a father&#8217;s dedication to rescue his son.  It even goes beyond the typical action movie.

My first gripe is that 90% of the movie is filmed without lighting. The scenes are so dark you will pop an eye vessel trying to make out what is on the screen.About 95% of the movie is filmed with hand held cameras. So, when you get your popcorn, Milk Duds and soda pop, get some sea-sickness pills too. I know movie-makers claim that using the hand held is supposed to give the movie a more ""realistic"" feel. I agree, if your reality is that you live on a ship in choppy seas.If the dark scenes didn't give you a massive headache, the camera work will.The acting and story progression is very much second rate. Little suspense, very little drama, and almost no action until the very end. If you are choosing between watching this and some other new release, watch the other one. Dwayne Johnson fans will be somewhat disappointed with the lackluster entertainment that this movie delivers.IMBD.COM gives it a 6.6....that is kind of high on MY scale.

(USA | United Arab Emirates). The UAE is a strong democratic Arab state, and they are GREAT people!

1626496,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00BEIYFWG,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Snitch"" is that rare action movie that dares to dabble in moral complexities. Dwayne Johnson plays the owner of a construction company whose semi-estranged, college-bound, 18-year-old son Jason (Rafi Gavron) is arrested for the possession and possible selling of drugs.  The catch is that the boy's sentence could be reduced if he agrees to set up someone else in a sting. When Jason refuses to be turned into a ""snitch"" just to protect his own hide, his dad decides to take matters into his own hands by recruiting one of his employees (the excellent Jon Berthnal from ""The Walking Dead""), who's on probation for narcotics trafficking and trying to turn his life around, to be an unwitting pawn in a scheme to finger a dangerous local drug dealer (Michael Kenneth Williams) .An interesting story is enhanced by taut direction (by Ric Roman Waugh), excellent cinematography and editing, and a highly effective musical score by Antonio Pinto. Beyond the aforementioned actors, there is excellent work by Susan Sarandon as a federal prosecutor who's over-zealousness and political calculation often lead her to act recklessly with little regard for others` safety, and Benjamin Bratt as a cartel kingpin.Inspired by ""true events,"" the Waugh/Justin Haythe screenplay is more concerned with character and conflict than with car chases and conventional action sequences, as a whole host of good or at least potentially good people are forced to compromise their integrity in order to game the system and achieve their goals. For John Matthews (Johnson), the goal is obviously to save his son from a hard stint in prison, while for Daniel James (Berthnal), the goal is a bit less clear-cut, which, in many ways, makes him an even more intriguing character than John.To get a sense of just how good a movie ""Snitch"" is, compare it to another recent action film that deals with a similar father-and-son theme, the foolish ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" with Bruce Willis all but leveling Moscow in an attempt to rescue his imprisoned boy.  John, on the other hand, remains an everyman character rather than a superhero - and that makes all the difference in the world.By keeping it small-scale and restrained, ""Snitch"" succeeds where so many other action movies have failed.",4,An action movie done right,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,2262,"['Snitch', 'rare', 'action', 'movie', 'dabble', 'moral', 'complexities', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'owner', 'construction', 'company', 'semi-estranged', 'college-bound', '18-year-old', 'son', 'Jason', 'Rafi', 'Gavron', 'arrested', 'possession', 'possible', 'selling', 'drugs', 'catch', 'boy', 'sentence', 'could', 'be', 'reduced', 'set', 'up', 'someone', 'else', 'sting', 'When', 'Jason', 'be', 'turned', 'snitch', 'just', 'protect', 'own', 'hide', 'dad', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'recruiting', 'one', 'employees', 'excellent', 'Jon', 'Berthnal', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'who', 'probation', 'narcotics', 'trafficking', 'trying', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'be', 'unwitting', 'pawn', 'scheme', 'finger', 'dangerous', 'local', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Michael', 'Kenneth', 'Williams', '.An', 'interesting', 'story', 'enhanced', 'taut', 'direction', 'Ric', 'Roman', 'Waugh', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'highly', 'effective', 'musical', 'score', 'Antonio', 'Pinto', 'aforementioned', 'actors', 'excellent', 'work', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'over-zealousness', 'political', 'calculation', 'often', 'lead', 'act', 'recklessly', 'little', 'regard', 'others', 'safety', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'cartel', 'kingpin.Inspired', 'true', 'events', 'Waugh/Justin', 'Haythe', 'screenplay', 'more', 'concerned', 'character', 'conflict', 'car', 'chases', 'conventional', 'action', 'sequences', 'whole', 'host', 'good', 'least', 'potentially', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'compromise', 'integrity', 'order', 'game', 'system', 'achieve', 'goals', 'John', 'Matthews', 'Johnson', 'goal', 'obviously', 'save', 'son', 'hard', 'stint', 'prison', 'Daniel', 'James', 'Berthnal', 'goal', 'bit', 'less', 'clear-cut', 'many', 'ways', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'character', 'John.To', 'get', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'Snitch', 'compare', 'recent', 'action', 'film', 'deals', 'similar', 'father-and-son', 'theme', 'foolish', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'leveling', 'Moscow', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'imprisoned', 'boy', 'John', 'other', 'hand', 'everyman', 'character', 'rather', 'superhero', 'difference', 'world.By', 'keeping', 'small-scale', 'restrained', 'Snitch', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'failed']",N/A

1626510,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B00BEIYFWG,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[24, 30]","Dwayne Johnsonian's new film Snitch is not nearly the generic action-thriller that I was expecting based on the generic trailers that seem so desperate to make you believe it is so. Snitch is surprising in a lot of ways, for one thing it is actually more thoughtful and has ideas and a point of view on current affairs regarding our legal system, it is more powerful than you might suspect and it is an exciting change of pace for a wrestler who wants to be an actor.Not to make it sound so trivial, this is to be fair Johnson's best work, as of yet. Though he isn't a fully capable dramatic actor, as of now, he is a lot better than you probably have a right to expected and here he gets to flex a different set of muscle than he usually does.Johnson plays John Matthews, a trucking company owner, who's estranged son, Jason (Rai Gavron) finds himself in trouble with the law, and I mean serious kind of trouble, like ten years behind bars kinda trouble. It seems that Jason foolishly agreed to intercept a package of Ecstasy for his best pal, under the mandatory sentencing laws he faces a decade behind bars just for doing so. Jason can't really turn snitch, he doesn't have the stomach for it and besides, he doesn't actually know any drug dealers.So John strikes a deal with a hard ass federal prosecutor (Susan Sarandon), that if he helps to sneer a bigger fish drug dealer that his son's sentence will be greatly reduced. But as stated in the great film noir Detour, fate is just waiting to stick it's foot out and trip you. So, John finds himself in one bad situation to one worst situation eventually leading him into the trusted inner circle of a cartel boss called ""El Topo"" (Benjamin Bratt) .Johnson may not be ascending to the first rank of acting talents, but he does manage an admirable job. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger for example, he has always had difficulty with playing ordinary-type guys, I always thought that was because he is so far from being an ordinary man that it lacks credibility, what it really was is that he lacked the skill to make it credible. Johnson isn't much more of an ordinary guy-type, but he manages to make us believe him because he succeeds in playing the role well.Unexpectedly Johnson is never better than when he's sharing screen time with talented old pros like Oscar winner Susan Sarandan and the underappreciated character actor Barry Pepper. I suspect these fine thespians are able to bring out the best in the big lug, who actually doesn't seem like a big lug at all in this one.The real acting high spot however is courtesy of the relatively unknown Jon Bernthal, who plays John's employee who he has help him with his introduction into the drug underworld. Bernthal is a strong and engaging actor, he is able to fully bring his character to empathetic life and I'm going to look forward to seeing him in future roles.Directed by former movie stuntman Ric Roman Waugh who relies, perhaps a little too much on the largely unappealing shaky cam for his action scenes. However, he seems to know his way around a tight dramatic script, which he co-authored. Waugh has directed before, particularly a movie titled Felon starring Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorff,  which I have not seen, but have heard good things regarding it and given his work here, I think he will be a director to keep an eye on.We are told up front that Snitch was inspired by a true story, just how much of it resembles reality is very little, I suspect. The story is preposterous, but it works as a very entertaining thriller with a well-written script from director Waugh and co-writer  Justin Haythe (Revaluation Road).For an actioner, the violence is surprisingly and pleasantly kept to a minimum in most instances helping to give the story a tad more room to breathe and thus credibility. Of course, Snitch has the obligatory car chase and it all comes down to a high speed pursuit and shoot out. However, this movie is more interested in character and ideas than habitual violence, in action movie terms it is more Copland than Demolition Man.Recently, a lot of action stars have appeared in tiresome and effete movies, but Johnson has found his way into one of the better ones. Efficiently made, well told with strong performances. As far as action flicks go, this is some thing special and of late, that's become all too rare.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,brains and brawn,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,4390,"['Dwayne', 'Johnsonian', 'new', 'film', 'Snitch', 'not', 'nearly', 'generic', 'action-thriller', 'was', 'expecting', 'based', 'generic', 'trailers', 'seem', 'so', 'desperate', 'make', 'believe', 'so', 'Snitch', 'surprising', 'lot', 'ways', 'one', 'thing', 'actually', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'ideas', 'point', 'view', 'current', 'affairs', 'regarding', 'legal', 'system', 'more', 'powerful', 'might', 'suspect', 'exciting', 'change', 'pace', 'wrestler', 'who', 'be', 'actor.Not', 'make', 'sound', 'so', 'trivial', 'be', 'fair', 'Johnson', 'best', 'work', 'yet', ""n't"", 'fully', 'capable', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'now', 'lot', 'better', 'probably', 'have', 'right', 'expected', 'here', 'flex', 'different', 'set', 'muscle', 'usually', 'does.Johnson', 'plays', 'John', 'Matthews', 'trucking', 'company', 'owner', 'who', 'estranged', 'son', 'Jason', 'Rai', 'Gavron', 'trouble', 'law', 'mean', 'serious', 'kind', 'trouble', 'ten', 'years', 'bars', 'kinda', 'trouble', 'Jason', 'foolishly', 'agreed', 'intercept', 'package', 'Ecstasy', 'best', 'pal', 'mandatory', 'sentencing', 'laws', 'decade', 'bars', 'just', 'doing', 'so', 'Jason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'turn', 'snitch', ""n't"", 'have', 'stomach', 'besides', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'drug', 'dealers.So', 'John', 'deal', 'hard', 'ass', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'sneer', 'bigger', 'fish', 'drug', 'dealer', 'son', 'sentence', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'stated', 'great', 'film', 'noir', 'Detour', 'fate', 'just', 'waiting', 'stick', 'foot', 'out', 'trip', 'So', 'John', 'one', 'bad', 'situation', 'one', 'worst', 'situation', 'eventually', 'leading', 'trusted', 'inner', 'circle', 'cartel', 'boss', 'called', 'El', 'Topo', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', '.Johnson', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ascending', 'first', 'rank', 'acting', 'talents', 'manage', 'admirable', 'job', 'Take', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'example', 'always', 'had', 'difficulty', 'playing', 'ordinary-type', 'guys', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'being', 'ordinary', 'man', 'credibility', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'lacked', 'skill', 'make', 'credible', 'Johnson', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'ordinary', 'guy-type', 'make', 'believe', 'playing', 'role', 'well.Unexpectedly', 'Johnson', 'never', 'better', 'when', 'sharing', 'screen', 'time', 'talented', 'old', 'pros', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Susan', 'Sarandan', 'underappreciated', 'character', 'actor', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'suspect', 'fine', 'thespians', 'are', 'able', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'big', 'lug', 'who', 'actually', ""n't"", 'seem', 'big', 'lug', 'one.The', 'real', 'acting', 'high', 'spot', 'however', 'courtesy', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'who', 'John', 'employee', 'who', 'help', 'introduction', 'drug', 'underworld', 'Bernthal', 'strong', 'engaging', 'actor', 'able', 'fully', 'bring', 'character', 'empathetic', 'life', ""'m"", 'going', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'future', 'roles.Directed', 'former', 'movie', 'stuntman', 'Ric', 'Roman', 'Waugh', 'who', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'largely', 'unappealing', 'shaky', 'cam', 'action', 'scenes', 'However', 'know', 'way', 'tight', 'dramatic', 'script', 'co-authored', 'Waugh', 'directed', 'particularly', 'movie', 'titled', 'Felon', 'starring', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'have', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'regarding', 'given', 'work', 'here', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'director', 'keep', 'eye', 'on.We', 'are', 'told', 'up', 'front', 'Snitch', 'was', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'reality', 'very', 'little', 'suspect', 'story', 'preposterous', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'well-written', 'script', 'director', 'Waugh', 'co-writer', 'Justin', 'Haythe', 'Revaluation', 'Road', '.For', 'actioner', 'violence', 'surprisingly', 'pleasantly', 'kept', 'minimum', 'most', 'instances', 'helping', 'give', 'story', 'tad', 'more', 'room', 'breathe', 'thus', 'credibility', 'course', 'Snitch', 'obligatory', 'car', 'chase', 'down', 'high', 'speed', 'pursuit', 'shoot', 'out', 'However', 'movie', 'more', 'interested', 'character', 'ideas', 'habitual', 'violence', 'action', 'movie', 'terms', 'more', 'Copland', 'Demolition', 'Man.Recently', 'lot', 'action', 'stars', 'have', 'appeared', 'tiresome', 'effete', 'movies', 'Johnson', 'found', 'way', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'Efficiently', 'made', 'well', 'told', 'strong', 'performances', 'As', 'far', 'action', 'flicks', 'go', 'thing', 'special', 'late', 'become', 'too', 'rare.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A

1626520,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B00BEIYFWG,The Jaundiced Eye,"[1, 2]","Other reviewers have thoroughly explained the entire plot, so I will simply focus on what makes this movie so much better than most people will expect. First, any movie starring ""The Rock"" is generally expected to fall into the old cliche of ""big, strong, former Special Forces father kicks and blasts the hell out of the mean old drug cartel to rescue his child"".....but that expectation is completely incorrect in this case. Instead, Dwayne Johnson (his real name being far more appropriate in this context), accurately and realistically portrays an ""average"" father, with no special physical attributes, who desperately tries to gain leniency for his way-over-sentenced son. He (very convincingly) displays fear and uncertainty, makes all sorts of mistakes, and in general behaves exactly like you or I would if we found ourselves stuck in an awful situation. At no time does he reveal even a momentary glimpse of his traditional ""superhero"" persona, and for that reason, this movie rises way beyond cliche into the realm of highly effective, realistic action drama.Second, the entire cast is superb, ranging from Michael K. Williams (Omar in The Wire) to John Bernthal, Barry Pepper, Benjamin Bratt, and Susan Sarandon (as the self-promoting federal prosecutor). These fine actors were given roles befitting their exceptional acting skills, and they each made the most of it. The result is a very strong, convincing production that never loses your attention or your respect.Third, there are some unconventional ""twists"" (see if you agree after you have watched the movie): John Bernthal's part is so complex and compelling that he actually rises to ""co-hero"" status with Dwayne Johnson, which you would never see in a traditional ""action"" flick, where all supporting actors simply serve to glorify the star. Susan Sarandon's character is, in my opinion, a villain equal to the drug cartel itself, since she selfishly puts an innocent man in a lethal situation simply to further her career. The drug cartel functions ruthlessly to further their own interests, as does she. That she is running for Congress, and will, no doubt win, sheds some unflattering light on what (some) people will do to succeed in politics.Bottom Line: This movie is definitely worth your time and money, and you can tell from the overall excellent reviews that I am not alone in this sentiment.

One of them sends him drugs through the mail, which he was half-heatedly opposed. Jason gets busted as did his friend who turned witness against Jason, claiming he was going to help sell the drugs. Jason is faced with a mandatory 10 year sentence, along with all the other innocent people in prison unless he snitches on everyone he ever smoked a doobie with.Jason refuses and would rather get beat up in prison. Dad (Dwayne Johnson) however has a different idea. He cuts an unorthodox deal the federal prosecutor (Susan Sarandon) that would give Jason a get of of jail free card, if he delivered them a felony conviction. Dad employs the help of an ex-con (Jon Bernthal)in his construction firm to make the contact. As Dwayne gets deeper and further up the food chain, the federal prosecutor wants more.Clearly Dwayne is in way over his head. We really don't feel the peril as much as we should because it is Dwayne Johnson who we have seen out run, out gun, and beat up armies of evil men.The acting was decent, even from the support cast. The plot and dialouge needed some help. The film attempts to show that mandatory sentencing laws are unfair and judges should have more leeway in sentencing, but it doesn't inundate you with the theme so as to interfere with the film.A good semi-family film for Rock fans. One you might want your teen to see. This is another story based on true events. This one is more believable as it doesn't include aliens, ghosts or zombies.

In fact, Jason is not a drug dealer, but one of his friends &#8220;snitched&#8221; on Jason to reduce his sentence.A successful construction company owner, John uses his connections and resources to catch a drug dealer, so that an ambitious local US Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) would reduce his own son&#8217;s sentence.&#8220;Snitch&#8221; opens with an interesting premise, with an almost documentary-like feel of photography, but starts losing its momentum in the mid-section, where the film follows the generic conventions of crime drama. &#8220;Snitch&#8221; has one so-so shoot-out scene and one great car chase sequence, but is not exactly an action movie.
