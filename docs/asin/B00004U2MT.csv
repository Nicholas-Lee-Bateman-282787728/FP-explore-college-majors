I'd say the basic outline was done well enough along with enough curious detail to fill in parts of the picture, but as ever NOVA can be annoyingly general and incomplete in areas. I thought too much time was frittered on Vikings in North America. So what? Not much is known and nothing came of their effort so why dwell there?

551647,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B00004U2MT,JAG 2.0,"[17, 18]","This DVD is a well made production in the tradition of Nova. Generally well done, with a great deal of archeological fact to counter centuries of ""bad press"" in regards to a brave, industrious and adventurous people.This documentary covers Viking history, alluding to the population pressures that drove these people to ""go a viking"". Covers their conquests and exploration to their west as well as their forays to the east into what is now Russia.This is a very good introduction to the ""viking age"", but - imho - does not go as far as I would like to show not only what they did but also who they were. Given the length of television documentaries, this is somewhat understandable, but I would have liked to have seen them explore more of Norse culture, their art, manufacturing techniques (ship building was covered well, though), the role of women in society, etc.This is a very good primer on the influence these people had on the late dark age/early medieval period and I reccomend it to those interested on the subject. I would hope that it would whet appetites for further reading on the subject.",4,"Well made documentary.
