Fiebiger,"[11, 17]","I wish the DVD producers would get organized and list the episodes by the date they originally aired, the secret word for each episode, and the names of the first two guests, on both the DVD covers and on Amazon and other sales web sites, so collectors of ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes can figure out which ones they have, and which ones they still need to buy,Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.From the fragmented descriptions from other reviewers of this volume, it sounds like this is another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.Dan FiebigerPortland, Oregon",1,A RE-HASH OF OTHER DVDs,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1243,"['wish', 'DVD', 'producers', 'would', 'get', 'organized', 'list', 'episodes', 'date', 'originally', 'aired', 'secret', 'word', 'episode', 'names', 'first', 'two', 'guests', 'DVD', 'covers', 'Amazon', 'other', 'sales', 'sites', 'collectors', 'YOU', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'episodes', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'ones', 'have', 'ones', 'still', 'need', 'buy', 'Far', 'too', 'many', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'DVDs', 'are', 'just', 're-hashes', 'same', 'episodes', 'have', 'appeared', 'other', 'DVDs', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'repackaged', 'different', 'artwork', 'names', 'covers', 'leaving', 'out', 'episodes', 'cash', 'interest', 'YOU', 'BET', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'episodes', 'splitting', 'multiple', 'volumes', 'larger', 'compilations.Several', 'hundred', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'aired', 'period', 'almost', '14', 'years', 'frustrating', 'find', 'same', 'relatively', 'few', 'episodes', 'cropping', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'almost', 'DVD', 'fragmented', 'descriptions', 'other', 'reviewers', 'volume', 'one', 're-hash', 'collections', 'thus', ""n't"", 'worth', 'effort', 'buy.Until', 're-released', 'above-mentioned', 'specifics', 'episodes', 'contained', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'book.Dan', 'FiebigerPortland', 'Oregon']",Groucho Marx - You Bet Your Life

And it also contains vintage commercials that are worth the price of admission. See rare Desoto commercials with Groucho and even some commercials with Harpo and Chico.

812472,A35UFX298D16I9,B0001OGUYU,Tad Ulrich,"[40, 40]","There's some classic Groucho on this DVD. If you've never seen or heard Groucho before, this is a great place to start.This DVD is released by Echo Bridge entertainment and published by Platinum DVD. The cover incorrectly states there are 12 classic shows over 4 hours. Actually there are 14 shows and 6 hours of entertainment. The picture quality is quite good for the most part and includes all those DeSoto commercials. They are an interesting novelty at first but it wasn't long before I found myself fast forwarding through them.This DVD contains one of You Bet Your Life's most side splittingly hilarious episodes, the one featuring Albert Hall, the printer's devil from Kansas. It's included in Scene section 5. Groucho's ability to maintain control of often awkward situations was truly remarkable.There are not a lot of extras included in this package, but what is here is classic Groucho and is more than enough to warrant the price of admission.
