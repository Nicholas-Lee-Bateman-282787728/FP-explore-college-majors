1379694,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B0040Y7ELU,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","Obviously that wasn't his most grievous sin, but it had its consequences, especially for Jewish composers and musicians of Germany and Austria. ""Modernism"" and particularly atonal/twelve-tonal music were anathema to the Nazis, who regarded Sch&ouml;nberg, Mahler and others as agents of International Jewry in conspiracy against Teutonic purity and heroism. Performances of such works were prohibited as ""entartete Musik"" and precious scores, manuscripts, editions were destroyed. The purpose of all art, according to Nazi ideology, was to foster patriotic/nationalistic sentiments; all else was decadence.Alexander Zemlinsky (1871-1942) was ""Jewish"" by way of a family choice. His father's family was staunchly catholic, but his mother was a Bosnian of Jewish and Muslim heritage. The whole family converted to Judaism before Alexander was born. The young Zemlinsky studied composition with Anton Bruckner and received enthusiastic encouragement from Johannes Brahms. His early career was moderately successful. In the 1890s, Zemlinsky actually taught counterpoint to Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg; in fact, he was Sch&ouml;nberg's only formal instructor in composition. In 1900 Zemlinsky fell in love with Alma Schindler but their engagement was thwarted under pressure from her family. Ms Schindler went on to marry another Jewish composer and to become the ""celebrated"" Alma Mahler. Zemlinsky's conducting career continued to prosper; he worked in Berlin under Otto Klemperer. In 1933, however, he wisely fled Germany to Vienna, and in 1938, he escaped to the USA. Unlike Sch&ouml;nberg, he attracted little success or support in America, where he died in 1942. His legacy of music has only recently begun to attract attention. His one-act opera ""Der Zwerg"" - The Dwarf - was composed in 1919-1921, long before the rise of Nazism. It's based on a story by Oscar Wilde with a libretto by Georg Klaren, but it's genuinely German, a Grimm Brothers M&auml;rchen, in affect. Nothing in its music per se is especially modernist or designed to offend against Romantic Heldenwhoop aesthetics; in fact the influence of Wagner is more obvious than any ""contamination"" from Sch&ouml;nberg. It's a solid piece of music theater with well-wrought emotional impact, and its dramatic strengths are fully realized in this ornate staging by the Los Angeles Opera, conducted by James Conlon. The sets and costumes are modeled after the famous painting by Velazquez of a Spanish ""Infanta"" surrounded by her attendants, including a dwarf. The role of the Dwarf in the opera is sung with great conviction and vocal flair by Rodrick Dixon. It would be hyperbole to assert, on the basis of this crafty but modest one-act opera, that Zemlinsky was a major composer on the order of Janacek or Bartok, but his music is well worth hearing. Ironically, the Nazi suppression of it has become a stimulus to its current revival.The history of Viktor Ullman (1898-1944) is more appalling. Ullmann was born in Silesia, a portion of the Habsburg Empire. His Jewish father had converted to Catholicism, pursued a career in the Austrian military, and been ennobled for service during World War I. Viktor also served in the Austrian army in Italy in WWI. After the war, he studied with Sch&ouml;nberg and then with Zemlinsky. His career was based in Prague; after the Nazis seized the Czech city, Ullmann was committed to Teresienstadt, the ""showcase"" concentration camp where Jewish intellectuals were permitted some cultural activities, including even opera. ""Der zebrochene Krug"" - The Broken Jug - was composed in 1941, just before Ullmann's sentencing to Teresienstadt. It's also a M&auml;rchen - a German folk tale - in affect. Indeed, the libretto is Ullmann's own reworking of a play by Heinrich von Kleist. Only the composer's Jewish identity could have offended Hitler's henchmen. The music is as resonantly committed to German Romanticism as von Weber's Freisch&uuml;tz! Ullmann composed with fervor at Teresienstadt, at least 23 significant works, including another opera and song cycles with texts by the great German poets Rilke and H&ouml;lderlin. Many of Ullman's pre-Teresienstadt compositions were suppressed and eradicated by the Nazis, but much of his work at the Camp has survived in well-hidden holographs. On October 16, 1944 he was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where on October 18, 1944 he was murdered in the gas chambers.The Broken Jug is  not grand opera. The libretto is witty, a depiction of small-town venality and abuse of power. It's really an ""interlude"" in the structural manner of Pergolesi and other early 18th C composers, who inserted 'comic' scenes between the acts of the opera seria.  I'd be delighted to see it performed today, between the acts of Wagner's Siegfried or Tannh&auml;user, as a measure of historical justice.Both of these small operas are staged and sung with particular panache. Conductor James Conlon writes: ""Full recognition of their works and genius still awaits Alexander Zemlinsky and Viktor Ullmann, more than sixty-five years after their deaths. Their works are powerful,vibrant, life-affirming and tragic in turn. Their lives and personal histories were tragic, but their music transcends it all.""",5,Hitler Had Lousy Taste in Music!,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,5224,"['Obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'most',

1379697,A2NS79048TBDPF,B0040Y7ELU,"Paul Pelkonen ""Superconductor""","[4, 4]","This DVD from the Los Angeles Opera presents a compelling double bill by two composers whose voices were silenced by the so-called cultural policies of the Third Reich. Viktor Ullmann's Der zerbrichene Krug (""The Broken Jug"") leads off, a frothy 40-minute comedy about judicial corruption. It is paired here with Der Zwerg, a tragic one-act opera by Alexander von Zemlinksy.L.A. Opera music director James Conlon staged these works as the first installemtn in Recovered Voices, an admirable initiative to explore and perform the stage works of composers whose works were declared ""Entartete"", or ""decadent"" by the Nazis. (This DVD is the first recording of the Ullmann opera.) Krug was completed in 1942, just before the composer was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. (Ullmann's most famous opera, Der Kaiser von Atlantis was written there in the year before the composer's death.)This work gives listeners the chance to hear Ullmann at his most melodic and inventive, writing for a full orchestra instead of the tiny forces used for Kaiser. The orchestration is rich, the melodies memorable, and the comedy compelling. If history had been different, this work would be a repertory piece, at least earning its keep as a light curtain-raiser.Der Zwerg is based on The Infanta's Birthday by Oscar Wilde, and retells the story of a Spanish princess who is given a hunchbacked dwarf as a present for her 18th birthday. The dwarf falls in love with the princess, only to have his heart broken. The work had deep meaning for Zemlinsky, and reflects the composer's insecurities through a poetic mirror.Part of the reason for the work's obscurity is the title role: a demanding tenor part. Playing a  hunchbacked dwarf takes the same acting  chops as the title role in Rigoletto. Add a voice designed to sing in a heroic tenor--the fach is about the same as Wagner's Lohengrin--and you'll get an idea of the demands. Roderick Dixon handles the high tessitura with skill and a golden tone, although he pushes in the final scene. His acting brings forth the naivet&eacute; and pathetique characteristics, which undermine the noble core of the nameless dwarf. This is a major performance.He is aptly paired with Mary Dunleavy as the cold-hearted Infanta, a spoiled brat who does not understand that her ""birthday present"" is a human being who has fallen in love with her. Her shimmering soprano skates above the orchestra, reaching heights that recall the best vocal writing of Richard Strauss. Susan B. Anthony is also impressive in the role of Ghita, a compassionate maid who is taken aback at the Princess' cruel treatment of the dwarf. And James Johnson doubles in this opera as Don Estoban, the court chamberlain.",4,"Reposted from Superconductor: ""Recovered Voices, Heard Again""",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,2724,"['DVD', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Opera', 'compelling', 'double', 'bill', 'two', 'composers', 'voices', 'were', 'silenced', 'so-called', 'cultural', 'policies', 'Third', 'Reich', 'Viktor', 'Ullmann', 'Der', 'zerbrichene', 'Krug', 'Broken', 'Jug', 'off', 'frothy', '40-minute', 'comedy', 'judicial', 'corruption', 'paired', 'here', 'Der', 'Zwerg', 'tragic', 'one-act', 'opera', 'Alexander', 'von', 'Zemlinksy.L.A', 'Opera', 'music', 'director', 'James', 'Conlon', 'staged', 'works', 'first', 'installemtn', 'Recovered', 'Voices', 'admirable', 'initiative', 'explore', 'perform', 'stage', 'composers', 'works', 'were', 'declared', 'Entartete', 'decadent', 'Nazis', 'DVD', 'first', 'recording', 'Ullmann', 'opera', 'Krug', 'was', 'completed', '1942', 'just', 'composer', 'was', 'deported', 'Theresienstadt', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Ullmann', 'most', 'famous', 'opera', 'Der', 'Kaiser', 'von', 'Atlantis', 'was', 'written', 'there', 'year', 'composer', 'death', 'work', 'chance', 'hear', 'Ullmann', 'most', 'melodic', 'inventive', 'writing', 'full', 'orchestra', 'instead', 'tiny', 'forces', 'used', 'Kaiser', 'orchestration', 'rich', 'melodies', 'memorable', 'comedy', 'compelling', 'history', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'repertory', 'piece', 'least', 'earning', 'keep', 'light', 'curtain-raiser.Der', 'Zwerg', 'based', 'Infanta', 'Birthday', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'story', 'Spanish', 'princess', 'who', 'given', 'hunchbacked', 'dwarf', 'present', '18th', 'birthday', 'dwarf', 'love', 'princess', 'only', 'have', 'heart', 'broken', 'work', 'had', 'deep', 'meaning', 'Zemlinsky', 'composer', 'insecurities', 'poetic', 'mirror.Part', 'reason', 'work', 'obscurity', 'title', 'role', 'demanding', 'tenor', 'part', 'Playing', 'hunchbacked', 'dwarf', 'same', 'acting', 'chops', 'title', 'role', 'Rigoletto', 'Add', 'voice', 'designed', 'sing', 'heroic', 'tenor', 'fach', 'same', 'Wagner', 'Lohengrin', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'demands', 'Roderick', 'Dixon', 'high', 'tessitura', 'skill', 'golden', 'tone', 'final', 'scene', 'acting', 'brings', 'forth', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'pathetique', 'characteristics', 'undermine', 'noble', 'core', 'nameless', 'dwarf', 'major', 'performance.He', 'aptly', 'paired', 'Mary', 'Dunleavy', 'cold-hearted', 'Infanta', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'not', 'understand', 'birthday', 'present', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'shimmering', 'soprano', 'skates', 'orchestra', 'reaching', 'heights', 'recall', 'best', 'vocal', 'writing', 'Richard', 'Strauss', 'Susan', 'B.', 'Anthony', 'also', 'impressive', 'role', 'Ghita', 'compassionate', 'maid', 'who', 'taken', 'aback', 'Princess', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'dwarf', 'James', 'Johnson', 'opera', 'Don', 'Estoban', 'court', 'chamberlain']",N/A
1379698,A33V67WXEYAVEA,B0040Y7ELU,Stefan Westerhoff,"[25, 25]","I saw Alexander Zemlinsky's The Dwarf years ago on stage and I think it is a wonderful opera - very effective and touching.  It is good to see that it's finally out on DVD.  It is paired here with a short opera by Viktor Ullmann, The Broken Jug, after the play by Kleist.  Kudos to James Conlon and the LA Opera for staging and recording these two operas.  They are very different and have nothing in common, but somehow they work well together and make for an interesting evening of 20th century opera. (For those who now fear the worst, let me add that both operas are tonal, and you will even hear some melodies!)Although The Dwarf was first performed about 20 years prior to The Broken Jug, it sounds more modern.  It's lush music, with some exotic elements thrown in.  Zemlinsky really deserves to be performed more often, but thanks to conductors like Conlon, it looks like we are getting there.The real surprise for me was The Broken Jug. Although the Zemlinsky is the more substantial piece, this little comedy is really well-written.  The music is a lot of fun, it is quirky and fits the comedy.  It reminds me of a modernized Lortzing, which might actually be the idea... It is very fast-paced, and the whole thing is over before you know it.  The opera is only about 40 minutes long, and time flies by.Both productions are completely traditional.  There are some nice touches, for example an extensive shadow play during the overture to the Ullmann opera which summarizes what happens before the opera starts.  No big names among the singers, but all of them are up to the task.The sound and picture quality (Arthaus) is disappointing compared to the standard that other labels like Opus Arte have set.  The picture is not very crisp and rather dark at times, and the sound seems far away, so one has to play with the settings a bit to get it right.  There are no extras on the DVD whatsoever, but there is a little booklet with a good essay by Conlon.

Mahler, the greatest influence on his music, was director of the Vienna Court opera at that period. Zemlinsky reached his peak during the first world war. Zemlinsky in his life time  was known as a conductor more then a composer.He taught  Schoenberg and became his brother in law.  Alma Schindler had an affair with him and left, taking up with Mahler, then married him.Zemlinsky never recovered from the ending of this relationship with Alma. Der Zwerg might sum up himself,a very short, unattractive man,who wrote the Zwerg-the Dwarf, based upon Oscar Wildes story, to come to terms with his own inner demons.He was considered too modern for the conservatives and too old fashioned for the  avant-guards serialism. He fled the Nazi's in 1934 and Vienna in 1938. He lived out his life alone in the United States and virtually forgotten, dying in 1942. Zemlinsky's best known work is his Lyric Symphony op 18, with poems written by Tagore, translated into German in 1914. A beautiful work. I am a fan of his.Victor Ullmann served as Kapellmeister under Zemlinsky in Prague in the 1920's. He had also studied with Schoenberg.Both rejected Serial music and were looking for a new music. Ullmann wrote three operas in the Terezin Concentration camp. He wrote the Broken Jug before entering Terezin in September 1942. This is about a comic depiction of a judge in a small town.Ullmann died in Auschwitz in October of 1944. The Nazi's destroyed the lives of so many artists. Will it happen again somewhere?Could the computer be used by a regime to control its people. This performance under Conlon is good.All round good performances by the singers.Der Zwerg is my prime interest. This is a traditional rendition. The dwarf is an orphan, ugly and deformed, given to the infanta,the daughter of Philip the second of Spain,as a present.  She is spoilt, but shallow and  living a sheltered existence. All the mirrors have been covered so he cannot see himself. The dwarf is gentle, loving and artistic.He is a court singer. The infanta and the dwarf play together and in her shallow way, tells him she loves him.This is the first person who has said this to him and he believes it,because she has given him a white rose.She tells him he is different from her, and orders her maid to show him a mirror, she refuses.Eventually, the dwarf sees his reflection and refuses to believe it.The Infanta tells him she will play with him as one does with an animal. Broken hearted he dies clinging to the rose. I have told the story of this opera in this review, because it is unknown and revived by the Los Angeles opera.This lyrical opera is conducted passionately by James Conlon,Rodrick Dixon gives a stunningly believable performance as the dwarf, supported by Mary Dunleavy, who is a believable Infanta, and Chita her maid, Susan Anthony,is good in the supporting role.The action takes place in the court of Phillip the second and the dress is of the period.The singing performances are stunning. Well done, L.A opera in bringing alive what should become a classic short opera. I wept at the end of the performance. I still cannot get the opera out of my mind. For I have seen short people and children begging in the streets in India.
