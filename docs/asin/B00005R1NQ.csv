677358,AK7IZMI209AIR,B00005R1NQ,ESP,"[0, 0]","As soon as the head of the family has died (apparently of unnatural causes), he starts talking in this echoey voice, very concerned with finding his killer.  This continues off and on throughout the rest of the movie, with him talking from beyond the grave to his daughter Rosy and sometimes to the air itself it seems.  The way this is carried out is laughable, almost worthy of MST3K-level ridicule.The rest of the plot can be described as ""As The Fulci Turns"", since it's nothing more than a glorified soap opera whodunnit with slimy family members of all sorts, each with a credible motive for commiting the murder.  Calling this a horror film is a bit of a stretch.  If it wasn't for the gore and nudity this could be a very bad TV movie (just listen for the dance music in the background during the lengthy funeral scene!).  While the autopsy scene is convincing enough, the child's torso and the corpse's decay are not realistic at all (the former because it looks so fake and the latter because as far as I know a corpse doesn't decay down to mere bones in the span of a few days).  And then there is the soft focus style this film was shot with.  It works in the context of the dream sequences but it's also used outside of those so there is no consistency to the effect.  It can certainly be hard on the eyes at times.I don't understand the relatively high status this film has received in the Fulci canon.  In all honesty it's a chore to sit through with very little payoff.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the generous amounts of topless female nudity.  This can often make sitting through a truly awful film somewhat more bearable.  Since there are way better Fulci films out there than this one, Voices From Beyond is more of an insult to his legacy and reputation than anything else.",2,Tepid soap opera plot sinks this 90-minute time waster,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1832,"['As', 'soon', 'head', 'family', 'died', 'apparently', 'unnatural', 'causes', 'talking', 'echoey', 'voice', 'very', 'concerned', 'finding', 'killer', 'off', 'rest', 'movie', 'talking', 'grave', 'daughter', 'Rosy', 'sometimes', 'air', 'way', 'carried', 'out', 'laughable', 'almost', 'worthy', 'MST3K-level', 'ridicule.The', 'rest', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'Fulci', 'Turns', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'soap', 'opera', 'whodunnit', 'slimy', 'family', 'members', 'sorts', 'credible', 'motive', 'commiting', 'murder', 'Calling', 'horror', 'film', 'bit', 'stretch', 'was', ""n't"", 'gore', 'nudity', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'TV', 'movie', 'just', 'listen', 'dance', 'music', 'background', 'lengthy', 'funeral', 'scene', 'autopsy', 'scene', 'convincing', 'enough', 'child', 'torso', 'corpse', 'decay', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'former', 'so', 'fake', 'latter', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'corpse', ""n't"", 'decay', 'down', 'mere', 'bones', 'span', 'few', 'days', 'then', 'soft', 'focus', 'style', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'context', 'dream', 'sequences', 'also', 'used', 'consistency', 'effect', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'hard', 'eyes', 'times.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'relatively', 'high', 'status', 'film', 'received', 'Fulci', 'canon', 'honesty', 'chore', 'sit', 'very', 'little', 'payoff', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'generous', 'amounts', 'topless', 'female', 'nudity', 'can', 'often', 'make', 'sitting', 'truly', 'awful', 'film', 'somewhat', 'more', 'bearable', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'Fulci', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'From', 'Beyond', 'more', 'insult', 'legacy', 'reputation', 'anything', 'else']",Voices From Beyond

Casual viewers of Fulci's films may not care for it much, if you are expecting lots of the latter. This is one of Fulci's last films, only to be followed by Door to Silence (1992). You've probably read the reviews about what the movie contains and don't contain, or at least are about to read it, so i won't go into details.But for myself, I thought it was a very good movie. It had a good dialogue, decent acting, and a great ending. I highly recommend it to the legion of Italian Horror buffs out there, to add it to your collection. One more thing to another reviewer named HENRY HUECK who is writing some of the reviews for this and other movies. I don't know how old you are, but please man, please, LEARN HOW TO FRIGGIN SPELL AND WORD THINGS CORRECTLY, WILL YA? Do you have spell check, or someone else to do your writing?

677364,A2Q5K1G3S8RLWX,B00005R1NQ,"Lunar Strain ""Thrash, don't mind if I do""","[3, 4]","I like Fulci films of the 70's and early 80's (basically through Manhattan Baby) but for some reason from his dismal fantasy epic Conquest in 1985 on his films are, for the most part, bad. Voices From Beyond isn't necessarily bad but it is very passable.This film, much like Fulci's TV Movie House of Clocks, really acts like an Italian Twilight Zone episode stretched out to feature length done Fulci style. Here we get a very rich family whose father dies a mysterious death. The father talks to himself (even though he's dead) throughout most of the film trying to figure out his murderer. His favorite daughter (who's the same actress from the film House of Clocks...and a fine looker I might add) visits for the funeral and her dead father communicates to her that he's been murdered and wants her to find the killer.The story (written by Fulci) is a tired weak formula and overall this really feels like a TV made film. I'm most certain if it was made for TV as it does have nudity but it does have the same feel as house of Clocks. Also like many of Fulci's later works this movie was filmed with soft lenses giving the film a white hue, or a hazy look. I hate this soft lense look that dominated Italian cinema in the late 80's and early 90's as it cheapens the look of the film. Perhaps Fulci thought it gave his films ""dreamy"" or ""surreal"" look but it just gets old. Unless you are a die-hard Fulci fanatic, I would think twice about paying the high price. Though Image Entertainment does a good job at mastering this little seen film they failed to deliver any special features what-so-ever. I personally just found the film to be kind of blah and it lacks the grander look and appeal of his early films that even the weaker Manhattan Baby contained.On a side note, horror fans might find it of interest that Fulci thanks Clive Barker in the end credits.",3,Another passable later Fulci release,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,1865,"['like', 'Fulci', 'films', '70', 'early', '80', 'basically', 'Manhattan', 'Baby', 'reason', 'dismal', 'fantasy', 'epic', 'Conquest', '1985', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'bad', 'Voices', 'Beyond', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'very', 'passable.This', 'film', 'much', 'Fulci', 'TV', 'Movie', 'House', 'Clocks', 'really', 'Italian', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'stretched', 'out', 'feature', 'length', 'done', 'Fulci', 'style', 'Here', 'get', 'very', 'rich', 'family', 'father', 'mysterious', 'death', 'father', 'talks', 'even', 'dead', 'most', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'murderer', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'who', 'same', 'actress', 'film', 'House', 'Clocks', 'fine', 'looker', 'might', 'add', 'visits', 'funeral', 'dead', 'father', 'communicates', 'been', 'murdered', 'find', 'killer.The', 'story', 'written', 'Fulci', 'tired', 'weak', 'formula', 'overall', 'really', 'TV', 'made', 'film', ""'m"", 'most', 'certain', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'have', 'nudity', 'have', 'same', 'feel', 'house', 'Clocks', 'Also', 'many', 'Fulci', 'later', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'soft', 'lenses', 'giving', 'film', 'white', 'hue', 'hazy', 'look', 'hate', 'soft', 'lense', 'look', 'dominated', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'look', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'Fulci', 'thought', 'gave', 'films', 'dreamy', 'surreal', 'look', 'just', 'old', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Fulci', 'fanatic', 'would', 'think', 'twice', 'paying', 'high', 'price', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'good', 'job', 'mastering', 'little', 'seen', 'film', 'failed', 'deliver', 'special', 'features', 'what-so-ever', 'personally', 'just', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'kind', 'blah', 'grander', 'look', 'appeal', 'early', 'films', 'even', 'weaker', 'Manhattan', 'Baby', 'contained.On', 'side', 'note', 'horror', 'fans', 'might', 'find', 'interest', 'Fulci', 'thanks', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'end', 'credits']",Voices From Beyond
