This really does stick out as being an outstanding made for TV movie.  Few catch my attention these days like this one did.  The plot is about a psychologist radio talk show host who attracts the attention of the murderer of one of her callers she had given advice to. He forms a plot to get into her life to destroy her after believing she influenced his wife to try and break free causing her to get into fatal accident.  William Moses proves himself an impressive outstanding and seasoned actor. Keep your eyes on Moses, this guy is really convincingly psycho.  He's been around since the early 80's and has the evil lover revenge thing down to the tee.  As for Alexandra Paul the psychologist, she was just as good as all the other women in the case.  They were all excellent in this film. Excellent screenplay.",5,One of the Best Made For TV Dramas I've Seen in a While,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,892,"['true', 'acting', 'casting', 'was', 'superb', 'outstanding', 'production', 'really', 'stick', 'out', 'being', 'outstanding', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Few', 'catch', 'attention', 'days', 'one', 'did', 'plot', 'psychologist', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'who', 'attention', 'murderer', 'one', 'callers', 'had', 'given', 'advice', 'plot', 'get', 'life', 'destroy', 'believing', 'influenced', 'wife', 'try', 'break', 'free', 'causing', 'get', 'fatal', 'accident', 'William', 'Moses', 'impressive', 'outstanding', 'seasoned', 'actor', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'Moses', 'guy', 'really', 'convincingly', 'psycho', 'been', 'early', '80', 'evil', 'lover', 'revenge', 'thing', 'down', 'tee', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'psychologist', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'women', 'case', 'were', 'excellent', 'film', 'Excellent', 'screenplay']",A Lover's Revenge
