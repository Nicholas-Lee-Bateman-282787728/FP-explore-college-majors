It was a small disappointment though as the animation as well as the english dub seemed just a bit less than season 1.The story is continued in the same style as season 1 and nothing in season 2 damages the tale (tail? Harhar!), it is a bit more subdued as the writers resist the temptation to have Holo solve all of Lawrence's problems (though she would if he asked). Holo, though still devoted to Lawrence seems preoccupied with things in her past and worried that she will become the cause of grief to Lawrence though it's not exactly clear why. The writer seems to be pacing the story by the seasons with a winter snow and gray background ending the collection. It left me anxious about the future, feeling slightly cheated that it ended where it did and hoping that FUNI will release a season 3 more quickly than they did 2!

You are left feeling like there will be a season 3 to continue the journey because wolf has not arrived at her final destination.  The same voice actors are in this series and that makes it doubly good.  What is so enjoyable about this series is the journey and the towns that the main characters find themselves in.  The people are always different because the towns and items that are to be traded are different.  I do give it 5 stars because of the formation of the relationship and friendship that happens between Spice and Wolf and the complications of relationships with 2 people with their own agenda to reach.,5,Spice and Wolf:  Season Two,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,715,"['What', 'great', 'series', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'season', '2', 'arrive', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'season', '3', 'continue', 'journey', 'wolf', 'not', 'arrived', 'final', 'destination', 'same', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'series', 'doubly', 'good', 'What', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'journey', 'towns', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'different', 'towns', 'items', 'are', 'be', 'traded', 'are', 'different', 'do', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'formation', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'Spice', 'Wolf', 'complications', 'relationships', '2', 'people', 'own', 'agenda', 'reach']",N/A

(I'm in to stocks, so I found the pyrite episodes amusing--just as I did the currency devaluation from the first season.) This season gets much deeper into the relationship between Holo and Lawrence, and does leave one wanting more. However, there will not likely be a third season (as of the date of this review), but this season closes at a point that doesn't leave one feeling disappointed. There are many cuts from the first season and the ""gratuitus"" fan service references are a joke (can ""Barbie doll"" images be considered fan service--has anyone seen Sekirei?)--anyway, it's not like it was random and just thrown in for lack of any substance in the storyline.

1436044,A3EC362UEY0PEA,B0050UEVJQ,Evan R. Cassity,"[62, 64]","It is fantastic that Funimation has decided to release the second season of the brilliantly calm Spice and Wolf. Coupled with their re-issue of the first season on blu-ray, the two sets will look beautiful both next to each other on your shelf and on your television.The story continues as Holo and Lawrence make their way towards Yoitsu, Holo's homeland. Where the first season focused on the budding, flirty relationship between Holo and Lawrence, this season finally admits it outright. It does not, however, forget the economics and intelligence that made it such a charming series.The first season had intriguing plots about different currencies and the principles of economics applied on a large scale. This season continues that, to a degree, but the episodic nature of the first season is not maintained. The story of season two is more cohesive throughout. Without spoiling anything, the relationship between Holo and Lawrence takes the forefront, while Holo's continuing education and intuition regarding the laws of economics is also portrayed. Indeed, though Lawrence is the alleged expert in the field, Holo's scheming and discretion is what saves the day on more than one occasion. Imagine the suspense of a battle anime, like Naruto or Bleach or Hajime no Ippo, only the battleground is the world of money, coercion and intrigue.The dubbing Funimation employed for the first season was very well done, and as always the set will include the original Japanese dub for those who enjoy subtitles. The recent development of anime on Blu-ray will ensure that the series looks as good as it possibly can as you watch, and while this series is not the most beautiful anime around, it is certainly not poorly drawn. Watching it, you will have wonderful characters with whom you can connect, plots that will allow you to think through the deals and economics, and the satisfaction of having watched an anime truly different from others you have seen.Will there be a third season? There are many who hope so. The light-novels, off of which this anime is based, are being released by Yen Press. So if you cannot wait to continue the adventures of Holo and Lawrence, opportunities will be open to you. If the episodic format of the first season turned you off to the series, this season should draw you back. There are only two main storylines throughout, with a few small side plots. Watch the relationship between two very believable (yet fantastic) characters develop naturally, and with all the charm in the world, as they navigate themselves through an inventive medieval world.",5,Still nothing to dislike.,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2586,"['fantastic', 'Funimation', 'decided', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'brilliantly', 'calm', 'Spice', 'Wolf', 'Coupled', 're-issue', 'first', 'season', 'blu-ray', 'two', 'sets', 'will', 'look', 'beautiful', 'next', 'other', 'shelf', 'television.The', 'story', 'Holo', 'Lawrence', 'make', 'way', 'Yoitsu', 'Holo', 'homeland', 'Where', 'first', 'season', 'focused', 'budding', 'flirty', 'relationship', 'Holo', 'Lawrence', 'season', 'finally', 'outright', 'not', 'however', 'forget', 'economics', 'intelligence', 'made', 'charming', 'series.The', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'intriguing', 'plots', 'different', 'currencies', 'principles', 'economics', 'applied', 'large', 'scale', 'season', 'degree', 'episodic', 'nature', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'maintained', 'story', 'season', 'two', 'more', 'cohesive', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'relationship', 'Holo', 'Lawrence', 'forefront', 'Holo', 'continuing', 'education', 'intuition', 'regarding', 'laws', 'economics', 'also', 'portrayed', 'Indeed', 'Lawrence', 'alleged', 'expert', 'field', 'Holo', 'scheming', 'discretion', 'what', 'day', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Imagine', 'suspense', 'battle', 'anime', 'Naruto', 'Bleach', 'Hajime', 'Ippo', 'only', 'battleground', 'world', 'money', 'coercion', 'intrigue.The', 'dubbing', 'Funimation', 'employed', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'always', 'set', 'will', 'include', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'who', 'enjoy', 'subtitles', 'recent', 'development', 'anime', 'Blu-ray', 'will', 'ensure', 'series', 'as', 'good', 'possibly', 'can', 'watch', 'series', 'not', 'most', 'beautiful', 'anime', 'certainly', 'not', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'Watching', 'will', 'have', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'whom', 'can', 'connect', 'plots', 'will', 'allow', 'think', 'deals', 'economics', 'satisfaction', 'having', 'watched', 'anime', 'truly', 'different', 'others', 'have', 'seen.Will', 'be', 'third', 'season', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'hope', 'so', 'light-novels', 'anime', 'based', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'Yen', 'Press', 'So', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'continue', 'adventures', 'Holo', 'Lawrence', 'opportunities', 'will', 'be', 'open', 'episodic', 'format', 'first', 'season', 'turned', 'off', 'series', 'season', 'should', 'draw', 'back', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'main', 'storylines', 'few', 'small', 'side', 'plots', 'Watch', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'believable', 'yet', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'develop', 'naturally', 'charm', 'world', 'navigate', 'inventive', 'medieval', 'world']",N/A

Lawrence is a traveling merchant who happens across a wolf diety. They begin to travel as partners after he promises to take Holo, the wolf diety, back to her birthplace in the north. They encounter many trials such as the inquisition and thieves taking them for their money. All these trials strengthen their bond and they eventually fall for each other. I cant think of a single bad thing about this anime. The art is beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing the voice actors are top notch, and the overall atmosphere of the show is great. It's nice to escape to another world with this dynamic duo. Spice and Wolf is a very unique anime. I really love it. You probably will too.Season 2 is just more of the same Spice and Wolf, but that's why people love it. It's a one of a kind anime. The drama gets a little more intense in this series as Lawrence and Holo become closer. The ending is very open. It may very well end with this season, but then again you never know.

1436047,A18V7ZARN71YNV,B0050UEVJQ,Michael,"[4, 4]","*First, a quick observation on the cost and why I am a loyal pre-order buyer now*  I pre-ordered this set----and I'm glad I did----its crazy how anime prices can fluctuate!  It started out at a $60 pre-release, then dropped to the high $30 range when I got mine, and now its back up to above $60?  All in a short time of less then 2 months...crazy....Makes me glad I always pre-order!Anyways, this series (2nd season or 1st) isn't for everyone.  It's different in its own way.  In that fact people who think outside the anime box should be the ones to review this, not who they just had review it, this soloman guy.  I've never seen an anime like this before, and now I'm glad I did.  It's not easy to describe, but it is a great watch if you have the mental capacity to enjoy an anime that tells a story at its own pace.  And my god, for goodness sake--if a wolf-girl shows up, naturally she's going to be naked---so why did this guy have an issue with that?  sheesh...It was craftfully done and in good taste.  Some anime has some strange concepts---I'll never understand the whole panty shots----sadly, not even Bleach has escaped that---I've just came across a scene in bleach where the soul reapers are on wako mundo and one of the bounts is obsessed with seeing this one girl's panties.  So seriously, the nudity done in this spice and wolf show is artfully done and not for shock factor.  What a prude this guy must be.  He probably even bathes in a swim suit.As for the second season, I feel that anyone who has seen the first will enjoy it.  This is a story, not a battle anime that will have wars and giant magical explosions and huge swords etc etc.  This second series continues to tell a enjoyable story and I'll try and inform more people about this anime.

The viewer gets to go come along on their shared journey and see their relationship grow deeper as they get to know each other. This show has the right amount of drama, comedy, and slightly tense situations to keep someone interested and coming back.
