1192285,A32VHSK5LPVJKE,B001FT4PF6,Bice,"[0, 0]","Back when Duckman originally ran, I was always thrilled when I could find an episode on TV (it seemed like it never aired at the same time two weeks in a row), and I used to watch re-runs whenever I could find them, but I knew there were a lot of episodes that I had missed.  So it's really good to have this DVD set of the complete series.As others have pointed out, the ""Four Season Pack"" is just the seasons 1&2 set and the seasons 3&4 set held together with some shrink wrap, but somehow that fits in perfectly with the Duckman universe - it's like Duckman himself half-assedly put the thing together.  Some reviews have mentioned that the music was changed or dropped due to rights issues - I didn't really notice any glaring problems, although some of the episodes sounded a little ""off"" - you could tell that the soundtrack had been redone.  On the plus side, the Frank Zappa music that I remembered popping up a lot (especially in the first season) is still there.  As is the awesome theme song.Whenever I hear Jason Alexander, I don't think of Sinfield - he'll always be Duckman to me.  His delivery of the title character's frequent rants and off-handedly offensive comments was perfect.Duckman was not just one of the best animated shows I've ever seen, it's one of the best comedies, period.  Every episode has at least one or two bits that will literally make you laugh out loud, and sometimes the good stuff is so rapid-fire that you have to rewind and watch it again in order to get everything, which is why watching it on DVD is nice.  It's also good to see the entire series in sequence so as to pick up on the running jokes and inside references.  I'm kind of glad though that the show ended when it did - it seemed to have run its course.  By the end of the series, they were really reaching for plots, and started falling back on the old sitcom ""fixes"" of transplanting the characters to other locations, doing parodies of famous movies, doing musical episodes, etc.  Not that the later episodes were bad, but they definitely moved further and further from the basic premise of the show during that last season.But even if you've never seen the show, these DVDs are well worth picking up if you're a fan of animated comedies - just keep in mind that the show was mostly intended for an adult audience.",5,"You put your down down and thrust your pelvis, huh!",1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,2321,"['Back', 'when', 'Duckman', 'originally', 'ran', 'was', 'always', 'thrilled', 'when', 'could', 'find', 'episode', 'TV', 'seemed', 'never', 'aired', 'same', 'time', 'two', 'weeks', 'row', 'used', 'watch', 're-runs', 'whenever', 'could', 'find', 'knew', 'were', 'lot', 'episodes', 'had', 'missed', 'really', 'good', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'complete', 'series.As', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Four', 'Season', 'Pack', 'just', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'set', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'set', 'held', 'together', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'somehow', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'Duckman', 'universe', 'Duckman', 'half-assedly', 'put', 'thing', 'together', 'reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'music', 'was', 'changed', 'dropped', 'due', 'rights', 'issues', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'glaring', 'problems', 'episodes', 'sounded', 'little', 'could', 'tell', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'been', 'redone', 'plus', 'side', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'music', 'remembered', 'popping', 'up', 'lot', 'especially', 'first', 'season', 'still', 'there', 'awesome', 'theme', 'song.Whenever', 'hear', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Sinfield', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'Duckman', 'delivery', 'title', 'character', 'frequent', 'rants', 'off-handedly', 'offensive', 'comments', 'was', 'perfect.Duckman', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'period', 'episode', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'bits', 'will', 'literally', 'make', 'loud', 'sometimes', 'good', 'stuff', 'so', 'rapid-fire', 'have', 'rewind', 'watch', 'again', 'order', 'get', 'everything', 'why', 'watching', 'DVD', 'nice', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'sequence', 'so', 'pick', 'up', 'running', 'jokes', 'inside', 'references', ""'m"", 'kind', 'glad', 'show', 'ended', 'when', 'did', 'seemed', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'end', 'series', 'were', 'really', 'reaching', 'plots', 'started', 'falling', 'back', 'old', 'sitcom', 'fixes', 'transplanting', 'characters', 'other', 'locations', 'doing', 'parodies', 'famous', 'movies', 'doing', 'musical', 'episodes', 'etc', 'Not', 'later', 'episodes', 'were', 'bad', 'definitely', 'moved', 'further', 'further', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'last', 'season.But', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'DVDs', 'are', 'well', 'picking', 'up', ""'re"", 'fan', 'animated', 'comedies', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'show', 'was', 'mostly', 'intended', 'adult', 'audience']",Duckman: The Complete Series

The episode &#34;America The Beautiful&#34; was so poignant that it alone was worth the cost of the set.  It is witty and insightful and I love it.  Such a pity that these can't go on forever.  Watching the last episode was a downer knowing that there would be no more.
