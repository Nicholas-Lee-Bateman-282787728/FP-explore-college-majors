1608384,AD1E5FS892L2E,B00AF4OSW2,"Brandon Blankenburg ""Author""","[2, 2]","This review contains spoilers. However, if you are at all interested in this movie then you may be thankful to have read them.I'm a horror nut, like quite a few SyFy originals, and adore the killer plant theme. Unfortunately, this is not ""one for eco-horror fans!"" This is more of a religious/political semi-thriller than anything else. The movie started out great, then it's as if the budget for digital effects ran out. It soon turns into a religious talky bore without the destruction. I was enjoying the movie until the tendrils came to Reno. They approach the city then instead of seeing any destruction the audience is shown a satellite image and the government officials say Reno is being devastated. The tease was like a punch in the gut. I then figured maybe the scenes of destruction would be saved for the climax. Nope. The tendrils reach Sacramento, the image shakes a bit while people run, then that's it.The movie was shot well. The acting wasn't bad. The special effects were typical of a SyFy original. The beginning had plenty of action. All the pieces were in place for a good (for a SyFy original) movie. That is why it turned out to be such a monumental disappointment. How something like this could end up as a great looking blu-ray (the image is nice and vibrant hovering around 25-30 Mbps) while Arachnoquake and Piranhaconda remain MIA in the US is a crime against horror fans.Note: if you pick this up and think you can just sell it on Amazon if you don't like it, think again. Amazon has classified this as a restricted item. This is probably because they know the $20+ price they're asking is insane and no one would bite if sellers offered it for less.",2,So Much Potential,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,1680,"['review', 'spoilers', 'However', 'are', 'interested', 'movie', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'thankful', 'have', 'read', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'horror', 'nut', 'quite', 'few', 'SyFy', 'originals', 'killer', 'plant', 'theme', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'one', 'eco-horror', 'fans', 'more', 'religious/political', 'semi-thriller', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'then', 'budget', 'digital', 'effects', 'ran', 'out', 'soon', 'religious', 'talky', 'bore', 'destruction', 'was', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'tendrils', 'came', 'Reno', 'approach', 'city', 'then', 'instead', 'seeing', 'destruction', 'audience', 'shown', 'satellite', 'image', 'government', 'officials', 'say', 'Reno', 'being', 'devastated', 'tease', 'was', 'punch', 'gut', 'then', 'figured', 'maybe', 'scenes', 'destruction', 'would', 'be', 'saved', 'climax', 'Nope', 'tendrils', 'reach', 'Sacramento', 'image', 'bit', 'people', 'run', 'then', 'it.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'well', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'typical', 'SyFy', 'original', 'beginning', 'had', 'plenty', 'action', 'pieces', 'were', 'place', 'good', 'SyFy', 'original', 'movie', 'why', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'monumental', 'disappointment', 'How', 'something', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'great', 'looking', 'blu-ray', 'image', 'nice', 'vibrant', 'hovering', '25-30', 'Mbps', 'Arachnoquake', 'Piranhaconda', 'remain', 'MIA', 'US', 'crime', 'horror', 'fans.Note', 'pick', 'up', 'think', 'can', 'just', 'sell', 'Amazon', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'again', 'Amazon', 'classified', 'restricted', 'item', 'probably', 'know', '20+', 'price', ""'re"", 'asking', 'insane', 'one', 'would', 'bite', 'sellers', 'offered', 'less']",Seeds of Destruction

But let me say this that If you are looking for a movie that has lots of destruction then this movie isn't for you. There is hardly any violence any fighting not much more then that. The seeds really don't do much of any destruction except for damaging cars and tearing up the roads but that's it. I was expecting these seeds to kill more people and I expected to see more gore, there wasn't much of any gore at all. I hope that they don't make another film because I wouldn't buy it. The sounds were pretty good and the casting was ok. The picture quality was very good. The only thing that was good was the very beginning after that the film goes downhill.
