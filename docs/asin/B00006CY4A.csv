712324,AMUNDUVA1VUB9,B00006CY4A,Phil Rosenbach,"[3, 6]","This review is not meant to criticize the phenomenal series, but to draw attention to lack of quality in the DVD release.  The first season of Farscape on DVD established a quality of excellence that has yet to be matched by the second season.  There is a definant lack of the highly informative, as well as entertaining commentaries thus far in the second season.  Character backstories as well as alien encounters have been diminished from actual interviews to mere reading material with no additional insight.  And this particular set claims to have &quot;deleted scenes.&quot;  Season 2 had previously deleted scenes available on an extras menu, but this release does not indicate that on either disc.  If they were reincorporated back into the program, a &quot;commentary would be helpful to let us know what's new to us since the original US airing as was done in season 1.I cannot help but to wonder that since this fine program has such a great US fan base, why are we just recently getting season 2 while season 3 is already in Australia?  I know that the show is filmed there, but is that any reason to make us wait?  And I can't help but to wonder if their DVD's contain even more footage and informtion that is not supplied to us.I think that the notion of setting four or five episodes per set is supposed to make up for that which is lacking from the season 1 releases.  I am grateful that my affection for this program has not been diluted by those that market it for public sales.  And although I will miss the future episodes that will never be aired, thanks to the myoptic suits in charge of not allowing this incredible vision to continue, I will not mourn the loss that the vision of what fans have been forced to accept as a definative release of a now, not-so &quot;commercial product&quot; in this consumers' eyes, has suffered from a multitude of selfish corporate wrongdoings.",3,The Cows Have Not Come Home,1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,1901,"['review', 'not', 'meant', 'criticize', 'phenomenal', 'series', 'draw', 'attention', 'lack', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'Farscape', 'DVD', 'established', 'quality', 'excellence', 'yet', 'be', 'matched', 'second', 'season', 'definant', 'lack', 'highly', 'informative', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'commentaries', 'thus', 'far', 'second', 'season', 'Character', 'backstories', 'as', 'well', 'alien', 'encounters', 'have', 'been', 'diminished', 'actual', 'interviews', 'mere', 'reading', 'material', 'additional', 'insight', 'particular', 'set', 'claims', 'have', 'quot', 'deleted', 'scenes.', 'quot', 'Season', '2', 'had', 'previously', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'available', 'extras', 'menu', 'release', 'not', 'indicate', 'disc', 'were', 'reincorporated', 'back', 'program', 'quot', 'commentary', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'new', 'original', 'US', 'airing', 'as', 'was', 'done', 'season', '1.I', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'fine', 'program', 'great', 'US', 'fan', 'base', 'why', 'are', 'just', 'recently', 'getting', 'season', '2', 'season', '3', 'already', 'Australia', 'know', 'show', 'filmed', 'there', 'reason', 'make', 'wait', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'DVD', 'contain', 'even', 'more', 'footage', 'informtion', 'not', 'supplied', 'us.I', 'think', 'notion', 'setting', 'four', 'five', 'episodes', 'set', 'supposed', 'make', 'up', 'lacking', 'season', '1', 'releases', 'am', 'grateful', 'affection', 'program', 'not', 'been', 'diluted', 'market', 'public', 'sales', 'will', 'miss', 'future', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'aired', 'thanks', 'myoptic', 'suits', 'charge', 'not', 'allowing', 'incredible', 'vision', 'continue', 'will', 'not', 'mourn', 'loss', 'vision', 'what', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'accept', 'definative', 'release', 'now', 'not-so', 'quot', 'commercial', 'product', 'quot', 'consumers', 'eyes', 'suffered', 'multitude', 'selfish', 'corporate', 'wrongdoings']",Farscape: Season 2 - Volume 3
712325,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B00006CY4A,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[49, 49]","This is the set I've been waiting for since ADV started releasing the ""Farscape"" episodes on DVD! This set contains the brilliant fairy-tale trilogy, ""Look at the Princess,"" which was the pinnacle of ""Farscape"" greatness up to that point. Also included are the great comedic episode, ""Out of Their Minds,"" and the dramatic ""My Three Crichtons."" In terms of quality, this is the best out of the second season sets so far, since every episode is a gem.""Out of Their Minds"" takes an old sci-fi chestnut (the main characters all switch bodies), and completely turns it on its head in typical ""Farscape"" fashion. This episode is fun, fun, fun in the same vein as ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" (although not as dark) and ""Through the Looking Glass"" (although not quite as wack-a-do). A true classic.""My Three Crichtons"" takes another classic sci-fi cliche, in that John is split into three versions of himself. The twist, though, is that one is at the bottom of the evolutionary scale, a caveman early-man prototype, the second is the regular human him, and the third is a John Crichton of the future, further evolved than the average human, with a large skull, to hold his much-bigger brain. This episode, despite its jokey title, is a dark, involving hour.And then the crown jewel of the set...The entire ""Look at the Princess"" trilogy, composed of Part 1, ""A Kiss is But a Kiss,"" Part 2, ""I Do, I Think,"" and Part 3, ""The Maltese Crichton."" This trilogy pushed the show in ways it had never been pushed before. It managed to (finally) give the John-and-Aeryn-shippers some real great romance between the two, expand on the Scarran mythology and the Scorpius character, deal with the politics of the Farscape universe, develop every character, while at the same time crafting a great, exciting, adventurous story that's loaded with almost unbearably suspenseful cliffhangers and freewheeling ""Farscape"" ingenuity.And, as I've said before, the second season keeps getting better and better...The next set also includes 4 great episodes, not a weak one in the bunch--""Beware of Dog,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again (one of the best, certainly one of the weirdest episodes in the show's history), ""The Locket,"" and ""The Ugly Truth.""

Farscape brings everything to the table with great drama, character development, humor, action, and impressive effects.  Anyone who enjoys science fiction cannot help but appreciate the quality of this series.Recently Sci-Fi channel cancelled this stellar show.

712327,A302HEZ30DAKOU,B00006CY4A,Saska Albright,"[11, 12]","What better reason to fight for a season five of Farscape than a shining example of what can be accomplished when David Kemper (writer) and Tony Tilse (director) put their minds and pens to a three-parter that is part fairy tale, part spy movie, and all engrossing?  The Look At The Princess trilogy is every bit movie-quality - in production, scripting, acting AND length.  ADV has redeemed themselves in my eyes (for extras that really lack oomph) by releasing all three of these episodes together, plus two more, in what would otherwise be a four-episode set.  Having snagged LATP on my TiVo during a marathon on the Sci-Fi channel, I can say with authority that these are meant to be watched all together, commercial-free, the way they are packaged in this set.  I can't wait.The other two episodes also deserve accolades - both challenging acting tasks for the series' stars.  Ben Browder gets a real workout playing three evolutionary versions of himself in &quot;My Three Crichtons&quot;, which helps demonstrate to his alien companions that humans really *have* come a long way.  It also carries a strong message about the redeeming qualities of humanity that manages to be poignant without being heavy-handed.&quot;Out of Their Minds&quot; is a riot for those familiar with the show, and really showcases not only how talented each actor is in his or her own right, but also how well they know one another and their characters - because they all get a chance to play each other (or in some cases, play WITH each other - er, themselves - er, you just have to watch).Fans of Farscape won't be able to live without this volume in the Season Two series.  Those new to the show will miss some of the finer points of these episodes, but will be treated to a good two hours of beautifully executed plot in LATP that stands on its own without any other series backstory.  In my opinion, this is the don't-miss Farscape DVD among those yet released.",5,Five (not four!) outstanding episodes in this set!,1034294400,"10 11, 2002",2002,1949,"['What', 'better', 'reason', 'fight', 'season', 'five', 'Farscape', 'shining', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'when', 'David', 'Kemper', 'writer', 'Tony', 'Tilse', 'director', 'put', 'minds', 'pens', 'three-parter', 'part', 'fairy', 'tale', 'part', 'spy', 'movie', 'engrossing', 'Look', 'Princess', 'trilogy', 'bit', 'movie-quality', 'production', 'scripting', 'acting', 'AND', 'length', 'ADV', 'redeemed', 'eyes', 'extras', 'really', 'lack', 'oomph', 'releasing', 'three', 'episodes', 'together', 'two', 'more', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'four-episode', 'set', 'Having', 'snagged', 'LATP', 'TiVo', 'marathon', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'can', 'say', 'authority', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'together', 'commercial-free', 'way', 'are', 'packaged', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait.The', 'other', 'two', 'episodes', 'also', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'challenging', 'acting', 'tasks', 'series', 'stars', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'real', 'workout', 'playing', 'three', 'evolutionary', 'versions', 'quot', 'My', 'Three', 'Crichtons', 'quot', 'demonstrate', 'alien', 'companions', 'humans', 'really', '*have*', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'also', 'strong', 'message', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'humanity', 'be', 'poignant', 'being', 'heavy-handed.', 'quot', 'Out', 'Their', 'Minds', 'quot', 'riot', 'familiar', 'show', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'talented', 'actor', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'how', 'well', 'know', 'one', 'characters', 'get', 'chance', 'play', 'other', 'cases', 'play', 'WITH', 'other', 'er', 'er', 'just', 'have', 'watch', '.Fans', 'Farscape', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'live', 'volume', 'Season', 'Two', 'series', 'new', 'show', 'will', 'miss', 'finer', 'points', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'good', 'two', 'hours', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'plot', 'LATP', 'own', 'other', 'series', 'backstory', 'opinion', ""don't-miss"", 'Farscape', 'DVD', 'yet', 'released']",Farscape: Season 2 - Volume 3
