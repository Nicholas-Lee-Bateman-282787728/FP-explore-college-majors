I hoped the film would include some actual footage of Philip K. Dick along with some in-depth analysis of the strange claims that obsessed Dick in the final years of his life.  Instead the DVD resembles an A&E;  or History Channel show with interspersed interviews from writers Paul Williams and Robert Anton Wilson, one member of a Gnostic organization, and some friends and fans of Philip K. Dick.  (Not surprisingly the only conclusion made was that Philip K. Dick's death was a tragic loss.)I personally get a better sense of Philip K. Dick from his novels than from this DVD.  I realize this film was a labor of love and the creators could only utilize what was available however the poor audio on Dick's recordings was a disappointment.With such a fascinating subject, this film should have offered more.",4,Mainly for the newcomers,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,935,"['Gospel', 'According', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'newcomers', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', ""n't"", 'seem', 'offer', 'much', 'fanatics', 'hoped', 'film', 'would', 'include', 'actual', 'footage', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'strange', 'claims', 'obsessed', 'Dick', 'final', 'years', 'life', 'Instead', 'DVD', 'A', 'E', 'History', 'Channel', 'show', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'writers', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'Robert', 'Anton', 'Wilson', 'one', 'member', 'Gnostic', 'organization', 'friends', 'fans', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'only', 'conclusion', 'made', 'was', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'death', 'was', 'tragic', 'loss', 'personally', 'get', 'better', 'sense', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'novels', 'DVD', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'creators', 'could', 'only', 'utilize', 'what', 'was', 'available', 'however', 'poor', 'audio', 'Dick', 'recordings', 'was', 'disappointment.With', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'offered', 'more']",The Gospel According to Philip K.

574902,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000059TOO,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","This film was a major disappointment. Philip K. Dick was a brilliant science fiction writer, and this does not in any way do him justice. Nor does it concentrate on anything that could be considered his ""Gospel."" It's just a group of people who knew him sitting around talking about him. Not even together, with exchanges of ideas, but with an off-camera interviewer. Of the group, the only one I'd ever heard of before (met, actually, when I lived in San Francisco) was Robert Anton Wilson. He's an appropriate one to talk about PKD, because both of them were enormously creative and totally crazy. It takes a kind of madness to write really good science fiction.The other very annoying feature is a padding out of the length of the video by a cartoon of a manual typewriter, someone who is presumably Phil typing, and all the details: pick up a piece of paper, fit it into the typewriter, roll the paper up, push the lever that advances the carriage to a new line, click a bunch of keys, pull the paper out of the typewriter and show what is typed on it. This is done for the opening credits, and for each of the ""chapter"" headings, and in my opinion, only serves to test the viewer's patience.In addition to Robert Anton Wilson, there is Paul Williams, who wrote an interview of PKD in Rolling Stone in 1975; Jason Koonick, who runs philipkdick.com; D. Scott Apel, author of PKD: The Dream Connection; Miriam Lloyd, who is described as a ""close friend"" of PKD; Ray Nelson, author of ""They Live""; Jay Kinney, publisher of Gnosis Magazine; Duncan Watson, webmaster of pkdslepthere.com or perhaps it is philipkdickslepthere.comThere is very, very little about his books, and only a little other than these talking heads. There is an interview with the librarian responsible for his manuscripts on file at one of the U. California libraries, and a short visit to the Marin County courthouse, which was used in one of the films made from one of his books.I watched it all the way to the end mostly to see if they ever really said anything worthwhile. They did get into some of PKD's later life, when he was doing a lot of drugs and having some pretty bizarre psychedelic experiences, and I suppose that was meant to be the ""Gospel"" part. As a skeptic, I was having trouble with the sound of ""I halfway believe it was real"" in these friends who watched the man's mind deteriorate.They never even mentioned ""The Man in the High Castle,"" which I consider to be his best work.",1,Disappointing,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2470,"['film', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'was', 'brilliant', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'not', 'way', 'do', 'justice', 'concentrate', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'Gospel', 'just', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'sitting', 'talking', 'Not', 'even', 'together', 'exchanges', 'ideas', 'off-camera', 'interviewer', 'group', 'only', 'one', ""'d"", 'ever', 'heard', 'before', 'met', 'actually', 'when', 'lived', 'San', 'Francisco', 'was', 'Robert', 'Anton', 'Wilson', 'appropriate', 'one', 'talk', 'PKD', 'were', 'enormously', 'creative', 'totally', 'crazy', 'kind', 'madness', 'write', 'really', 'good', 'science', 'fiction.The', 'other', 'very', 'annoying', 'feature', 'padding', 'length', 'video', 'cartoon', 'manual', 'typewriter', 'someone', 'who', 'presumably', 'Phil', 'typing', 'details', 'pick', 'up', 'piece', 'paper', 'fit', 'typewriter', 'roll', 'paper', 'up', 'lever', 'carriage', 'new', 'line', 'click', 'bunch', 'keys', 'pull', 'paper', 'typewriter', 'show', 'what', 'typed', 'done', 'opening', 'credits', 'chapter', 'headings', 'opinion', 'only', 'test', 'viewer', 'patience.In', 'addition', 'Robert', 'Anton', 'Wilson', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'who', 'wrote', 'interview', 'PKD', 'Rolling', 'Stone', '1975', 'Jason', 'Koonick', 'who', 'philipkdick.com', 'D.', 'Scott', 'Apel', 'author', 'PKD', 'Dream', 'Connection', 'Miriam', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'described', 'close', 'friend', 'PKD', 'Ray', 'Nelson', 'author', 'Live', 'Jay', 'Kinney', 'publisher', 'Gnosis', 'Magazine', 'Duncan', 'Watson', 'webmaster', 'pkdslepthere.com', 'perhaps', 'philipkdickslepthere.comThere', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'books', 'only', 'little', 'other', 'talking', 'heads', 'interview', 'librarian', 'responsible', 'manuscripts', 'file', 'one', 'U.', 'California', 'libraries', 'short', 'visit', 'Marin', 'County', 'courthouse', 'was', 'used', 'one', 'films', 'made', 'one', 'books.I', 'watched', 'way', 'end', 'mostly', 'see', 'ever', 'really', 'said', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'did', 'get', 'PKD', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'doing', 'lot', 'drugs', 'having', 'pretty', 'bizarre', 'psychedelic', 'experiences', 'suppose', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'Gospel', 'part', 'skeptic', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'sound', 'halfway', 'believe', 'was', 'real', 'friends', 'who', 'watched', 'man', 'mind', 'deteriorate.They', 'never', 'even', 'mentioned', 'Man', 'High', 'Castle', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'work']",The Gospel According to Philip K.

574905,A1MWAQCQ1G3CL3,B000059TOO,Dorion Sagan,"[6, 7]","This is a very fun and informative documentary for aficionados of Philip Kindred Dick whose writings directly inspired such science fiction film classics as Total Recall (based on the short story ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale""), Minority Report (based on the story ""Minority Report""), and Blade Runner (loosely based on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep""). Nonetheless, Dick made only a little bit of  money near the end of his life time before he died of massive heart attack in his early fifties. He had been married several times, may have been abused as a child, and seemingly experienced benzedrine- and sodium pentothal-potentiated schizophrenia that was also a form of mysticism as well as an inducement to his multiply interpretable science fiction plots. On February 3, 1974 he had an extremely realistic 24-hour hallucination that he raced to explain throughout the remaining years of his life with such questionable concepts as alien contact and the stopping of time. (A Google search should reveal the 52-point Appendix to VALIS which gives an overview of this bizarre cosmology.) Thus, as the filmmakers correctly realized, Dick&#65533;s life is theoretically of as much epistemological and science fiction interest as the plots he derived from it. This will disappoint you if you want to see a state-of-the art science fiction movie, but it is quite fascinating if you are just looking to get closer to the wellspring of Dick&#65533;s incredible productivity/creativity. The documentary features interviews with individuals such as Paul Williams, the Rolling Stone journalist who published an interview with him (whose audio tapes have been cleverly used to dub a tasteful cartoon rendition of Dick speaking to us from beyond the grave at his typewriter) and  Robert Anton Wilson, author of The Illuminatus Trilogy and a cult figure in his own right (he is a trip). There are also cool extras on the DVD such as a ""Dicktionary"" of explanations of some of his overarching concepts&#65533;e.g., the ""zebra""&#65533;an alien intelligence that disguises itself among ordinary objects, ""kipple""&#65533;a kind of spatial counterpart to entropy manifesting (again, as ordinary objects, see his novel Ubik), VALIS (Vast Active Living Intelligence System; considered by some his greatest novel), and the ""black iron prison"" (a Gnostic concept of Earth and our life here as a kind of spiritual holding tank).",4,Fun Glimpse into World of P.

574907,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B000059TOO,John Morgan,"[11, 11]","It's difficult to imagine for whom this film was intended. Focusing as it does exclusively on the last decade of Philip K. Dick's life, and with virtually no discussion of his fiction, it would be incomprehensible to a newcomer. But since it contains nothing that hasn't been widely known about PKD's life for many years, longtime fans will find most of it boring. But besides this, the entire film is hindered by amateurish production values. As many have already pointed out, the film is padded by repetetive, crude animations which serve no real purpose, and features an electronic soundtrack that sounds like it was lifted from a PBS special, circa 1985. While watching it, I finally lost all hope of improvement during the sequence when the librarian at California State University (where many of PKD's manuscripts are kept) painstakingly explains the procedures for checking out materials from Special Collections. (And then, ironically, not a single page of any of PKD's manuscripts is displayed in the film.) The people who are interviewed (with the exception of the librarian) all have something interesting to say, but due to the filmmakers' total lack of editing skills, the film is painfully slow to watch. And most of the audio clips of PKD himself speaking were from the cassette issued fifteen years earlier by the PKD Society and widely available. I actually felt the deleted scenes section of the DVD contained more interesting material than anything that was left in the film, such as Ray Nelson discussing PKD's friendship with Bishop Pike. One wonders what led the filmmakers to conclude that watching their little animation of PKD at a typewriter for the sixth time made for better cinema than this material.

""The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick"" is, at best, the first step.  And while I appreciate the effort put into making this film, as well as the astute contributions by interviewees, this is a seriously flawed production, and does, indeed, seem like a college project hamstrung by a commensurate lack of funding.For instance, as the director was unable to use any actual video of PKD, he hit upon the idea of using a cartoon version of PKD to segue from one ""segment"" to the next, but also to provide the ""medium"" to present a garbled, and at times, indiscernible PKD speaking in an interview, without, however, the benefit of subtitles.  As Elvis Mitchell noted in his review of the movie for the NY Times, the ""animated version of Dick behind the typewriter, which suggests a low budget version of the Cryptkeeper...underscores the minimal amount of money the filmmakers had (reportedly about $10,000) to finish the project, which was shot on videotape and feels even more cheaply done than an episode of ""Biography"" on A&E.;"" (3/2/2001)To note that mind-numbing repetitions of the same minimalist animation overlaid with an abysmally god-awful techno(?) soundtrack that no one in their right mind should be subjected to would be to belabor the obvious. Suffice it to say that before long I was muting the music, and then fast-forwarding through the un-animated animated segments to locate the next interesting ""human"" moment.Insofar as the dvd bonus features package goes, forget about it.  The dvd simply recycles the comments already presented in the film.  So there is nothing new except for the interview with the director and the definitions of a half dozen key terms in the late oeuvre. Big deal.Given the fact that some half dozen of PKD's stories have been made into movies (with more reputedly on the way), its high time for a full scale documentary.  This ""Gospel"" may be a first attempt, but PKD deserves more and better.  Seriously.[As a side note: back in the day, when it lived up to its name, The Learning Channel aired a wonderful series (co-executive produced by Walter Cronkite and Goeffrey C.

We see a few famous writers, such as Robert Anton Wilson and Paul Williams, who are interviewed to tell their story. We also see an animated PKD typing messages and speaking (sounds like old bits of audio strung together) which are interesting. PKD tells some funny stories when he ""speaks"". Some references to 2-3-74, the Dark Haired Girl and other major events in this man's fascinating life are included.It's not an exhaustive look at PKD nor is it without problems. Production values are somewhat amateurish. The audio portions where PKD is speaking could have been clearer. The animation should be quicker or cut better. Also, some editing could have cleaned up pacing issues throughout the documentary. There is one interviewee featured who talks about his website (which seems to have been closed years ago). Overall, a light but incomplete intro into the world of PKD. Die-hard fans won't get enough here but it is worth a watch despite its flaws.

It would have been easier - and less risky - to present a `chronological portrait' of Philip K. Dick and his work, but since such a task would prove especially difficult in an 80-minute documentary, the people behind `Gospel' wisely chose to emphasize a specific period (mainly from the 70s to his death in 1982) and thematic line (the 1971 break-in; the 2-3-74 visions) and went along with it. As a whole, the various interviewees offer insights of uneven interest (the most notable contributions being arguably made by R. Nelson, D. Scott Apel, J. Kinney and P. Williams), and some anecdotes seem out of place, needlessly extending the film's running time while providing little in the way of intellectual substance. There's no doubt that it could have digged deeper - Dick's work is certainly complex enough to warrant a more meticulous treatment - and the best way to introduce oneself to Dick's world and ideas has always been and still is to read his books. But the fact that the filmmakers made visible efforts to examine the most troubling period of Dick's life, all the while putting him and his work back on the map, should be commended.",3,An uneven but passable documentary,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,1243,"['documentary', 'received', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'criticisms', 'warranted', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'less', 'risky', 'present', 'chronological', 'portrait', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'work', 'task', 'would', 'prove', 'especially', 'difficult', '80-minute', 'documentary', 'people', 'Gospel', 'wisely', 'chose', 'emphasize', 'specific', 'period', 'mainly', '70s', 'death', '1982', 'thematic', 'line', '1971', 'break-in', '2-3-74', 'visions', 'went', 'whole', 'various', 'interviewees', 'offer', 'insights', 'uneven', 'interest', 'most', 'notable', 'contributions', 'being', 'arguably', 'made', 'R.', 'Nelson', 'D.', 'Scott', 'Apel', 'J.', 'Kinney', 'P.', 'Williams', 'anecdotes', 'seem', 'place', 'needlessly', 'extending', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'providing', 'little', 'way', 'intellectual', 'substance', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'digged', 'deeper', 'Dick', 'work', 'certainly', 'complex', 'enough', 'warrant', 'more', 'meticulous', 'treatment', 'best', 'way', 'introduce', 'Dick', 'world', 'ideas', 'always', 'been', 'still', 'read', 'books', 'fact', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'visible', 'efforts', 'examine', 'most', 'troubling', 'period', 'Dick', 'life', 'while', 'putting', 'work', 'back', 'map', 'should', 'be', 'commended']",The Gospel According to Philip K.

It ain't gonna happen.  If one is not exposed to Phil's work at an innocent enough age then it will not become the life-changing, life-enhancing, life-affirming experience it could and should be.  This doesn't imply any lack of greatness.  Just that a certain greatness can't be apprehended after a level of cynicism has set in.

574913,AMNJJ9VAQEA86,B000059TOO,Spunk Monkey,"[9, 9]","Dick really deserves some first class documentaries exploring his remarkable life and personality- and this one just doesn't cut the mustard.If you love Philip Dick, you already know these stories (which, the ones they get to, are very shallowly explored), and if you are unfamiliar with Dick, this, I can safely guess, will not make you very interested in looking deeper. The interviews are not very revealing, the audio clips out of context and thematically meaningless, his works are not explored, there was no access to persons, pictures, video footage that make documentaries worthwhile. There are animated clips that are annoying and last too long.This film is not totally without redeeming qualities, just not enough to warrent a purchase; unless, of course, you would like to see extended footage of the librarian talking on and on about the Dick archives.If you would like to get a deep look into Dick, I would recommend the intriguing book ""Only Apparently Real"" by Paul Williams. Once, Philip Dick had his house broken into and a filing cabinet/safe blown up. This book, which is a series of interviews, has Dick, in his own words, unspool theory after theory after theory about whom may have done it and why: the police, The CIA, drug dealers, Black Panthers, and even at one point, himself. It shows how his mind functioned, like a megacomputer on acid and amphetamines, staring straight into the void. Also recommended is ""Divine Invasions"" by Lawrence Sutin, a more traditional bio but very well written. Then there is ""I am alive and you are dead"" by Emmanuel Carrere which I have not read yet but is supposed to be very good.We can respect the efforts and the intent of the filmakers, but the results just left me cold.",2,Weak,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1736,"['Dick', 'really', 'first', 'class', 'documentaries', 'exploring', 'remarkable', 'life', 'personality-', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'mustard.If', 'love', 'Philip', 'Dick', 'already', 'know', 'stories', 'ones', 'get', 'are', 'very', 'shallowly', 'explored', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Dick', 'can', 'safely', 'guess', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'very', 'interested', 'looking', 'deeper', 'interviews', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'revealing', 'audio', 'clips', 'context', 'thematically', 'meaningless', 'works', 'are', 'not', 'explored', 'was', 'access', 'persons', 'pictures', 'video', 'footage', 'make', 'documentaries', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'animated', 'clips', 'are', 'annoying', 'last', 'too', 'long.This', 'film', 'not', 'totally', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'warrent', 'purchase', 'course', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'extended', 'footage', 'librarian', 'talking', 'Dick', 'archives.If', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'deep', 'look', 'Dick', 'would', 'recommend', 'intriguing', 'book', 'Only', 'Apparently', 'Real', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'Once', 'Philip', 'Dick', 'had', 'house', 'broken', 'filing', 'cabinet/safe', 'blown', 'up', 'book', 'series', 'interviews', 'Dick', 'own', 'words', 'unspool', 'theory', 'theory', 'theory', 'whom', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'why', 'police', 'CIA', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'how', 'mind', 'functioned', 'megacomputer', 'acid', 'amphetamines', 'staring', 'straight', 'void', 'Also', 'recommended', 'Divine', 'Invasions', 'Lawrence', 'Sutin', 'more', 'traditional', 'bio', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'Then', 'am', 'alive', 'are', 'dead', 'Emmanuel', 'Carrere', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'yet', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'good.We', 'can', 'respect', 'efforts', 'intent', 'filmakers', 'results', 'just', 'left', 'cold']",The Gospel According to Philip K.
