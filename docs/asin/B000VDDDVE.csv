1100697,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B000VDDDVE,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[202, 209]","The Young Indiana Jones adventures come to DVD. Agreed I wish it was cheaper but then consider you are dealing with Paramount that charges over $100 per season for any of the Star Trek series. Considering that each episode is an hour and a half movie in itself and this does not seem quite so unreasonable. Furthermore it includes alot of extras whether you want them or not. I grant you I would like to see a 7 disk edition of just the episodes for a substancial savings.  Personally I'm just thrilled to finally see them come to DVD. I am sure if you're patient you can probably get a package deal once all the volumes are released. The first 12-disc set includes seven feature-length episodes as well as 38 in-depth companion documentaries, an historical overview, an interactive game and an interactive timeline. The series was shot in 35 countries and showed key figures in the coming of age of the modern world. The interviews include celebrities like Gen. Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Gloria Steinem, Martin Scorsese, Barbara Boxer, James Earl Jones, Hal David, and Deepak Chopra.This volume includes the episodes (I have described the first story on each disc, they each include a second story):My First Adventure - Indy and T.E. Lawrence solve a murder mystery in Egypt.Passion For Life - Indy goes on safari in Kenya with Teddy Roosevelt.The Perils of Cupid - Indy falls in love with the daughter of Duke Franz Ferdinand in Vienna, Austria.Travels with Father - Indy joins up with Leo Tolstoy after an argument with his father while visiting Russia.Journey of Radiance - Indy visits the Holy City Benares in the Far East and meets Jiddu Krishnamurti.Spring Break Adventure - Indy meets Thomas Edison and tries to avoid German spies.Love's Sweet Song - Indy ends up in Ireland right before the Easter Rebellion mixed up with the resistance and he meets Winston Churchill.The second volume is to be released December 2007 and the third volume in the Spring of 2008. If you shop around I think you will find Amazon has the best Pre-order price so far. The suggested retail being advertised several places is over $100. So I'm ordering mine here and now. This set is great family entertainment. It may not always have as much excitement and comedy as the Jone's movies, but it makes up for it in other ways including good drama, history, and locations. I highly recomend this set.Addendum:Pro: This set is like seven feature length movies revolving around two stories on each disc. The documentaries created by George Lucas are quite good so please don't rate it based on the price. The whole family will enjoy this set and the movies alone are easily worth $11.50 each. I received my set and viewed the first disc. The first disc was sharp and clear and the first episode and the four documentaries on it were all quite entertaining. I'm looking forward to watching the other 11 discs.Con: Does not include the scenes of old Indiana Jones. In fact the overall editing is poor. You will notice episodes ending abruptly or jumping to an older Jones, then a younger Jones. The other con is the box is the standard Paramount cheap folding carboard with plastic disc inserts stuck in a flimsy cover like all the Star Trek sets. I would have preferred seven slim plastic DVD cases for the discs put in a firm cardboard cover. Sometimes the greed of Paramount really shows. I don't mind paying the high price for quality. The series is worth the price, I just don't think Paramount should have packaged such a great series in such a cheap box.If you don't already have this series on some format you may want this set as it may be years before they become available with the cut scenes put back it. If on the other hand you have the original televised series, forget this set and figure a way to get yours transferred to DVD.",4,Young Indy Returns,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,3827,"['Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'come', 'DVD', 'Agreed', 'wish', 'was', 'cheaper', 'then', 'consider', 'are', 'dealing', 'Paramount', '100', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'Considering', 'episode', 'hour', 'half', 'movie', 'not', 'seem', 'quite', 'so', 'unreasonable', 'alot', 'extras', 'want', 'not', 'grant', 'would', 'like', 'see', '7', 'disk', 'edition', 'just', 'episodes', 'substancial', 'savings', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'just', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'see', 'come', 'DVD', 'am', 'sure', ""'re"", 'patient', 'can', 'probably', 'get', 'package', 'deal', 'once', 'volumes', 'are', 'released', 'first', '12-disc', 'set', 'seven', 'feature-length', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', '38', 'in-depth', 'companion', 'documentaries', 'historical', 'overview', 'interactive', 'game', 'interactive', 'timeline', 'series', 'was', 'shot', '35', 'countries', 'showed', 'key', 'figures', 'coming', 'age', 'modern', 'world', 'interviews', 'include', 'celebrities', 'Gen.', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'Gloria', 'Steinem', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Barbara', 'Boxer', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Hal', 'David', 'Deepak', 'Chopra.This', 'volume', 'episodes', 'have', 'described', 'first', 'story', 'disc', 'include', 'second', 'story', 'First', 'Adventure', 'Indy', 'T.E', 'Lawrence', 'solve', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Egypt.Passion', 'Life', 'Indy', 'safari', 'Kenya', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt.The', 'Perils', 'Cupid', 'Indy', 'love', 'daughter', 'Duke', 'Franz', 'Ferdinand', 'Vienna', 'Austria.Travels', 'Father', 'Indy', 'up', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'argument', 'father', 'visiting', 'Russia.Journey', 'Radiance', 'Indy', 'Holy', 'City', 'Benares', 'Far', 'East', 'meets', 'Jiddu', 'Krishnamurti.Spring', 'Break', 'Adventure', 'Indy', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'tries', 'avoid', 'German', 'spies.Love', 'Sweet', 'Song', 'Indy', 'up', 'Ireland', 'right', 'Easter', 'Rebellion', 'mixed', 'up', 'resistance', 'Winston', 'Churchill.The', 'second', 'volume', 'be', 'released', 'December', '2007', 'third', 'volume', 'Spring', '2008', 'shop', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'Amazon', 'best', 'Pre-order', 'price', 'so', 'far', 'suggested', 'retail', 'being', 'advertised', 'several', 'places', '100', ""'m"", 'ordering', 'mine', 'here', 'now', 'set', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'excitement', 'comedy', 'Jone', 'movies', 'up', 'other', 'ways', 'including', 'good', 'drama', 'history', 'locations', 'highly', 'recomend', 'set.Addendum', 'Pro', 'set', 'seven', 'feature', 'length', 'movies', 'revolving', 'around', 'two', 'stories', 'disc', 'documentaries', 'created', 'George', 'Lucas', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'so', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'rate', 'based', 'price', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'set', 'movies', 'alone', 'are', 'easily', 'worth', '11.50', 'received', 'set', 'viewed', 'first', 'disc', 'first', 'disc', 'was', 'sharp', 'clear', 'first', 'episode', 'four', 'documentaries', 'were', 'quite', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'other', '11', 'discs.Con', 'not', 'include', 'scenes', 'old', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fact', 'overall', 'editing', 'poor', 'will', 'notice', 'episodes', 'ending', 'abruptly', 'jumping', 'older', 'Jones', 'then', 'younger', 'Jones', 'other', 'con', 'box', 'standard', 'Paramount', 'cheap', 'folding', 'carboard', 'plastic', 'disc', 'inserts', 'stuck', 'flimsy', 'cover', 'Star', 'Trek', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'seven', 'slim', 'plastic', 'DVD', 'cases', 'discs', 'put', 'firm', 'cardboard', 'cover', 'greed', 'Paramount', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', 'high', 'price', 'quality', 'series', 'price', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Paramount', 'should', 'have', 'packaged', 'great', 'series', 'such', 'cheap', 'box.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'series', 'format', 'may', 'want', 'set', 'may', 'be', 'years', 'become', 'available', 'cut', 'scenes', 'put', 'back', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'original', 'televised', 'series', 'forget', 'set', 'figure', 'way', 'get', 'yours', 'transferred', 'DVD']","The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years"
1100698,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000VDDDVE,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[3, 3]","Whether you will think this set an astoundingly good value for money and time spent depends on no small degree to how much of a fan you are of the whole Indiana Jones concept, how much you liked the original broadcast incarnation, and how much you are into The History Channel documentary features. There are a number of aspects to consider, in purchasing this set and the subsequent two volumes - first, that no expense was spared in production, and it all shows. The series was shot on location, around the world, and if nothing else redeems ones faith in the ability of an American television series to ""do"" another era than the present with absolute fidelity to detail. This set presents the series events in chronological order - unlike the original series as broadcast, which hopped from adventure to adventure, from one year to a decade later with no particular logic. I rather prefer the straight chronological sequence but your mileage may vary. What will probably dismay fans of the series is that the framing device and poignant character of ""Old Indy"" is entirely absent, and that each episode in this set is actually a pair of episodes roughly cobbled together. Sometimes there is a bit of a theme or location in common, and sometimes not; which  results in jarring shifts of place and story at about the mid-point of each, as the schoolboy-aged Indiana Jones travels with his renowned professor father around the world at the very dawn of the 20th century. Of course, he meets up with fascinating and important people, every step of the way with a frequency which defies logic - but this is a television show! It is supposed to be entertaining, imagining the circumstances under in which a bright eight-year old boy can manage to meet everyone from Sigmund Freud to Norman Rockwell and take away some interesting lesson or insight.The extras, which take up nearly half the 12 disc set are more extensive than practically any other TV series set which I have reviewed and consist mostly short documentaries about the events and people encountered in the various episodes. If one is a History Channel addict, this is almost like getting two sets in one. A straight-up fan of the series may consider the documentaries, the interactive time line and game a little more gilding of the lily than is strictly necessary. But this series will be a godsend to parents attempting to painlessly interest children in historical events and interesting people - and anyway, Indiana Jones is a little more appealing  to kids and a lot little easier going than ""Lanny Budd""",3,Easier going than Lanny Budd,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,2570,"['Whether', 'will', 'think', 'set', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'time', 'spent', 'depends', 'small', 'degree', 'how', 'much', 'fan', 'are', 'whole', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'concept', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'original', 'broadcast', 'incarnation', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'features', 'are', 'number', 'aspects', 'consider', 'purchasing', 'set', 'subsequent', 'two', 'volumes', 'first', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'production', 'shows', 'series', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'world', 'nothing', 'else', 'ones', 'faith', 'ability', 'American', 'television', 'series', 'do', 'era', 'present', 'absolute', 'fidelity', 'detail', 'set', 'series', 'events', 'chronological', 'order', 'original', 'series', 'broadcast', 'hopped', 'adventure', 'adventure', 'one', 'year', 'decade', 'later', 'particular', 'logic', 'rather', 'prefer', 'straight', 'chronological', 'sequence', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'What', 'will', 'probably', 'dismay', 'fans', 'series', 'framing', 'device', 'poignant', 'character', 'Old', 'Indy', 'entirely', 'absent', 'episode', 'set', 'actually', 'pair', 'episodes', 'roughly', 'cobbled', 'together', 'Sometimes', 'bit', 'theme', 'location', 'common', 'sometimes', 'not', 'results', 'jarring', 'shifts', 'place', 'story', 'mid-point', 'schoolboy-aged', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'travels', 'renowned', 'professor', 'father', 'world', 'very', 'dawn', '20th', 'century', 'course', 'up', 'fascinating', 'important', 'people', 'step', 'way', 'frequency', 'logic', 'television', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'entertaining', 'imagining', 'circumstances', 'bright', 'eight-year', 'old', 'boy', 'can', 'manage', 'meet', 'everyone', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'take', 'away', 'interesting', 'lesson', 'insight.The', 'extras', 'take', 'up', 'nearly', '12', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'more', 'extensive', 'practically', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'set', 'have', 'reviewed', 'consist', 'mostly', 'short', 'documentaries', 'events', 'people', 'encountered', 'various', 'episodes', 'one', 'History', 'Channel', 'addict', 'almost', 'getting', 'two', 'sets', 'one', 'straight-up', 'fan', 'series', 'may', 'consider', 'documentaries', 'interactive', 'time', 'line', 'game', 'little', 'more', 'gilding', 'lily', 'strictly', 'necessary', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'godsend', 'parents', 'attempting', 'painlessly', 'interest', 'children', 'historical', 'events', 'interesting', 'people', 'anyway', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'little', 'more', 'appealing', 'kids', 'lot', 'little', 'easier', 'going', 'Lanny', 'Budd']","The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years"

1100705,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B000VDDDVE,Dave Cordes,"[11, 17]","I haven't watched these in over 15 years but I have every episode recorded on VHS.  Lucas has tinkered with these almost as badly as he did with the Star Wars Special Editions.  They are not at all as I had remembered.  Old Indy George Hall no longer bookends the series regaling us with tales of his cosmopolitan youth from the museum.  Now they are narrated by the kid Indy (who doesn't even sound like Corey Carrier) and the episode titles which I always thought were really exciting with Laurence Rosenthal's adventurous theme music have been sadly removed and the episodes re-edited into feature length installments like the tele-films that were aired on The Family Channel after ABC cancelled the series and the remaining unaired episodes were cobbled together and shown on cable.Watching these again I am amazed I even used to watch this show.  Indy meets every famous and important person in twentieth century history.  Give me a break.  The odds of Indy meeting all of these significant historical figures throughout his life is so improbable that odds are he has a better chance of finding the Holy Grail, hmmm...  The stories come off mostly contrived and corny.  It just makes me realize that some things are better left to the imagination.  Watching Indy grow up into the Man With The Hat from Raiders feels like I'm watching little Annie and the Pod Race on Tatooine.  Oy veh.I'll give Lucas credit for utilizing exotic locations around the world to deliver breathtaking cinematography courtesy of Director of Photography David Tattersall and attempting to deliver some kind of thinly disguised history lesson to young people.  The DVD has an exhausting supplement of documentaries and interactive learning modules which probably explains the ridiculous cost for these overpriced DVD sets (all 3 volumes will set you back somewhere in the ballpark of about $300). I should have skipped the first volume and waited for Vol. 2 to get to the World War I episodes with Sean Patrick Flanery and Ronny Coutteure as Remy which were the best and most dramatically memorable of the entire series.  I also remember Harrison Ford guest starring in the ""Mystery of the Blues"" which was pretty much a let down seeing a then 50-something bearded Harrison Ford being chased in a beat-up old '57 Ford pickup truck like he was reprising his role as Bob Falfa from American Graffiti and playing the blues on his saxophone.

1100710,A1PJ2G9K7VNOQX,B000VDDDVE,Frank &#34;the man&#34;,"[0, 0]","I only saw a few episodes (loaded with commercials)of the young Indy series when it was originally broadcast on TV and I have to confess that I was not a fan of Sean Patrick Flannery.  While he bears a striking resemblance to a younger Harrison Ford, he seemed to lack Ford's adventure dynamic....However, Flannery DOES look more academic and is more plausible as a wannabe archaelogist.  Ford, on the other hand, had more of the bounty hunter of Star Wars in his veins than the knowledge of the Fall of the Roman Empire.  However, I really warmed up to Flannery in Vol.1.I recently purchased all 3 sets from Amazon and have worked my way through Vols. 1 and 2 including all of the excellent documentaries and I have to give George Lucas, Flannery, and young Corey Carrier full marks for this series of movies. Both Carrier and Flannery were rookie actors and you can see as the episodes move on that they get better at their roles.  What I really like about Flannery is that he portrays an avid listener and an acceptance of the world as it presents itself; and underneath, you sense he is genuinely a nice guy.  He doesn't try to add Bogart angst and looks in place in the early 20th century settings.  Carrier is amazing.  Again, a kid you know is a genuine nice kid and shows all the wonder of learning you would expect from a young person with budding academic interest.  The main support actors are excellent too.  Margaret Tyzack as Miss Seymour develops real affection for young Indy and is a pleasure to watch and Lloyd Owen, too, has remarkable resemblance to Indy's father....his role as an Edwardian father is played to perfection.  Ruth de Sosa was, however, the biggest surprise.  Although she is not as prominent as the other two in many of the episodes, she exudes warmth and elegance and gives a fine performance as a woman swept off her feet by the notorious phlianderer, Giacomo Puccini.  We are also introduced to Remy Couterre, who figures heavily in Vol.2....he is a perfect counterpoint to young Indy.As far as the extremely unlikely possibility that Indy would meet (to name a few): Lawrence of Arabia, Degas, Picasso, Tolstoy, Sean O'Casey, Teddy Roosevelt, George Patton and Pancho Villa, ...well it is the vehicle created as the ""rason d'etre"" of each new story and we have to be content with that.  But, each new adventure begins ingeniously....There is a lot of humour, adventure, love, spills, and what sets and locations George Lucas takes us to.....It is a visual delight and I have to say I found each episode very compelling to watch.Which leads me to my final, and most important, point.  Along with the movie episodes are about 30 or so 25min. documentaries.  These were a pleasant surprise for two reasons:  first, they were excellent and secondly, many were on people or topics in history that we never see in documentaries.  For example, the 2 documentaries on the Suffragette movements in Britain and the US were excellent.  I had no idea the suffragette movement in the US was based on a constitutional issue and closely related to emancipation.  There was one very illuminating documentary on Edward Statlemeyer, the author who created The Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, and Nancy Drew.  And a great little documentary on the ""Theophists"" and Krishnamurti.  These are not household names.  Each of these complements the characters or a movement in a particular movie.The 3 best movies concern Indy (Flannery) falling into Pancho Villa's hands and his junket with a cantankerous junket with Tolstoy (played by the great British actor, Michael Gough).  For young Corey Carrier, my favourite episode is with T.E.Lawrence and a dig in Egypt.  I have to add the 2 episodes where Ruth de Sosa shines (Puccini and China)as well.  Obviously some historical background was thoroughly studied in these episodes and some perceptive historical wit given to us:  The best lines come from a Mexican peasant when Indy asks why he is unhappy about Pancho Villa's efforts at ""liberating him"".  The peasant proceeds to say that the common denominator among Emperor Maxmilian, Benito Jaurez, Villa, and few others is......""They were all going to free me but .....they all stole my chickens.""This set was unbelievably good value and I thoroughly enjoyed it.....Crack the whip and follow your dreams!!",4,INDY TAKES ON THE WORLD!!,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,4314,"['only', 'saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'loaded', 'commercials', 'young', 'Indy', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'have', 'confess', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'younger', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'seemed', 'lack', 'Ford', 'adventure', 'dynamic', '.However', 'Flannery', 'DOES', 'look', 'more', 'academic', 'more', 'plausible', 'wannabe', 'archaelogist', 'Ford', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'more', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Star', 'Wars', 'veins', 'knowledge', 'Fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'However', 'really', 'warmed', 'up', 'Flannery', 'Vol.1.I', 'recently', 'purchased', '3', 'sets', 'Amazon', 'have', 'worked', 'way', 'Vols', '1', '2', 'including', 'excellent', 'documentaries', 'have', 'give', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Flannery', 'young', 'Corey', 'Carrier', 'full', 'marks', 'series', 'movies', 'Carrier', 'Flannery', 'were', 'rookie', 'actors', 'can', 'see', 'episodes', 'move', 'get', 'better', 'roles', 'What', 'really', 'Flannery', 'avid', 'listener', 'acceptance', 'world', 'underneath', 'sense', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', ""n't"", 'try', 'add', 'Bogart', 'angst', 'place', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'settings', 'Carrier', 'amazing', 'Again', 'kid', 'know', 'genuine', 'nice', 'kid', 'wonder', 'learning', 'would', 'expect', 'young', 'person', 'budding', 'academic', 'interest', 'main', 'support', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'too', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack', 'Miss', 'Seymour', 'real', 'affection', 'young', 'Indy', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'too', 'remarkable', 'resemblance', 'Indy', 'father', '.his', 'role', 'Edwardian', 'father', 'played', 'perfection', 'Ruth', 'Sosa', 'was', 'however', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'not', 'as', 'prominent', 'other', 'two', 'many', 'episodes', 'warmth', 'elegance', 'fine', 'performance', 'woman', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'notorious', 'phlianderer', 'Giacomo', 'Puccini', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Remy', 'Couterre', 'who', 'heavily', 'Vol.2', '.he', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'young', 'Indy.As', 'far', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'possibility', 'Indy', 'would', 'meet', 'name', 'few', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Degas', 'Picasso', 'Tolstoy', 'Sean', ""O'Casey"", 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'George', 'Patton', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'well', 'vehicle', 'created', 'rason', ""d'etre"", 'new', 'story', 'have', 'be', 'content', 'new', 'adventure', 'ingeniously', 'lot', 'humour', 'adventure', 'love', 'spills', 'what', 'sets', 'locations', 'George', 'Lucas', '..It', 'visual', 'delight', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'episode', 'very', 'compelling', 'watch.Which', 'leads', 'final', 'most', 'important', 'point', 'movie', 'episodes', 'are', '30', 'so', '25min', 'documentaries', 'were', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'were', 'excellent', 'secondly', 'many', 'were', 'people', 'topics', 'history', 'never', 'see', 'documentaries', 'example', '2', 'documentaries', 'Suffragette', 'movements', 'Britain', 'US', 'were', 'excellent', 'had', 'idea', 'suffragette', 'movement', 'US', 'was', 'based', 'constitutional', 'issue', 'closely', 'related', 'emancipation', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'illuminating', 'documentary', 'Edward', 'Statlemeyer', 'author', 'who', 'created', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Tom', 'Swift', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'great', 'little', 'documentary', 'Theophists', 'Krishnamurti', 'are', 'not', 'household', 'names', 'complements', 'characters', 'movement', 'particular', 'movie.The', '3', 'best', 'movies', 'concern', 'Indy', 'Flannery', 'falling', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'hands', 'junket', 'cantankerous', 'junket', 'Tolstoy', 'played', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Gough', 'young', 'Corey', 'Carrier', 'favourite', 'episode', 'T.E.Lawrence', 'dig', 'Egypt', 'have', 'add', '2', 'episodes', 'where', 'Ruth', 'Sosa', 'shines', 'Puccini', 'China', 'as', 'well', 'Obviously', 'historical', 'background', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'studied', 'episodes', 'perceptive', 'historical', 'wit', 'given', 'best', 'lines', 'come', 'Mexican', 'peasant', 'when', 'Indy', 'why', 'unhappy', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'efforts', 'liberating', 'peasant', 'proceeds', 'say', 'common', 'denominator', 'Emperor', 'Maxmilian', 'Benito', 'Jaurez', 'Villa', 'few', 'others', 'were', 'going', 'free', '..they', 'stole', 'chickens', 'set', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'value', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'whip', 'follow', 'dreams']","The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years"

New footage was shot in 1996 to be incorporated with the newly re-edited and re-titled ""chapters"" to better help it chronologically and provide smooth transitions. The newly shot Tangiers, 1908 was joined with Egypt, 1908 from the Curse of the Jackal to form My First Adventure, and Morocco, 1917 was joined with Northern Italy, 1918 (now re-dated as 1917) to form Tales of Innocence. Also included in the home video release were four unaired episodes made for the ABC network, Florence, May 1908, Prague, 1917, Transylvania, 1918, and Palestine, 1917.The 93-year-old Indy bookends for the original series were removed, as well as Sean Patrick Flanery's bookend for Travels With Father. However, the Harrison Ford bookend, set in '50s, from The Mystery of The Blues was not cut.[5]However George Lucas needs to start putting version numbers on his films so we can tell them apart.I feel that this is a inferior version of this series. I will not buy any more of the volumes until they release the TV versions.On top of that I hate Paramount DVD cases.  I have to remove a disk to get to another. That really bites, and causes accidental scratches.  Some of the Star Trek movies have theses cases.Paramount when will you ever learn.Also:I would not mind paying the high prices if this set contained the TV versions.",2,I think what we are seeing here is the VHS versions,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,1703,"['think', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'VHS', 'versions', 'Not', 'TV', 'copy', 'wikipedia', 'what', 'found', '[', 'edit', ']', 'Home', 'video', 're-editsThe', 'revised', 'updated', 'edition', 'book', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Creative', 'Impulse', 'Charles', 'Champlin', 'how', 'Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Chronicles', 'series', 'would', 'be', 're-edited', 'new', 'structure', 'twenty-two', 'Chapter', 'TV', 'films', '1999', 'VHS', 'release', 'New', 'footage', 'was', 'shot', '1996', 'be', 'incorporated', 'newly', 're-edited', 're-titled', 'chapters', 'better', 'help', 'chronologically', 'provide', 'smooth', 'transitions', 'newly', 'shot', 'Tangiers', '1908', 'was', 'joined', 'Egypt', '1908', 'Curse', 'Jackal', 'form', 'My', 'First', 'Adventure', 'Morocco', '1917', 'was', 'joined', 'Northern', 'Italy', '1918', 'now', 're-dated', '1917', 'form', 'Tales', 'Innocence', 'Also', 'included', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'were', 'four', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'made', 'ABC', 'network', 'Florence', 'May', '1908', 'Prague', '1917', 'Transylvania', '1918', 'Palestine', '1917.The', '93-year-old', 'Indy', 'bookends', 'original', 'series', 'were', 'removed', 'as', 'well', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'bookend', 'Travels', 'Father', 'However', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'bookend', 'set', ""'50s"", 'Mystery', 'Blues', 'was', 'not', 'cut', '5', ']', 'However', 'George', 'Lucas', 'start', 'putting', 'version', 'numbers', 'films', 'can', 'tell', 'apart.I', 'feel', 'inferior', 'version', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'more', 'volumes', 'release', 'TV', 'versions.On', 'top', 'hate', 'Paramount', 'DVD', 'cases', 'have', 'remove', 'disk', 'get', 'really', 'accidental', 'scratches', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'have', 'theses', 'cases.Paramount', 'when', 'will', 'ever', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'paying', 'high', 'prices', 'set', 'contained', 'TV', 'versions']","The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years"

As stated the set has mostly the 10 year old Indy adventures for the most part you only get two episodes of the older Indy after he leaves the U.S. and starts his adventures.  I also like how the sets give such a detail information on what started the first world war and the events during and after it ended.

HE HAD TO KNOW that the fans wanted these shows uncut, as originally broadcast. But because of his own vain obsessive compulsions and his never-ending lust for his fans' hard earned bucks, he's decided to release this monstrosity. Of course, when he sees the sales peak and then decline for these, he'll put out an expensive dvd set of the original episodes.

With the first seven feature-length episodes of the critically acclaimed show, this box set also contains a whopping 38 companion documentaries, historical overviews, and an interactive game and timeline.Lucasfilm's documentary unit, headed by CBS news veteran David Schneider, created the 38 all-new companion featurettes specifically for this DVD release. With insights from scholars and historians, the documentaries perfectly complement all of the adventures of young Indy. Martin Scorsese, James Earl Jones, Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Gloria Steinem and many more offer their opinions and commentary to this definitive collection.Shot in 35 countries and employing the talents of the industry's most distinguished filmmakers, the series won 11 Emmy Awards and 26 nominations during its two-year run. Sean Patrick Flanery stars as a teenage Indy, and Corey Carrier stars as the nine-year-old Jones. Guest stars include Christopher Lee, Vanessa Redgrave, Anne Heche, Elizabeth Hurley, Catherine Zeta Jones, Daniel Craig and more. Directors such as Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer), Nicholas Roeg (The Man Who Fell to Earth) and Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) worked on the series, as well as writers Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) and Jon Hensleigh (Die Hard With a Vengeance).Volume 2 was announced for a December 18th release and Volume 3 in Spring 2008. Paramount also mentioned that the complete series will be released shortly thereafter, which will be unfortunate for those who can't wait.During Indy's extensive travels and high-stakes adventures, he meets many great historical figures and the screenwriters found a way to include much of the same adventure from the movies into the show, as well as to educate about such notable historical events.""My First Adventure"" takes Indy into Egypt and around North Africa, aided by the legendary T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia). ""Passion for Life"" sees Indy hanging out with Teddy Roosevelt and then Norman Rockwell, Pablo Picasso and Edgar Degas. In ""Perils of Cupid"" Indy falls for the daughter of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and must consult Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.""Travels With Father"" sees our favorite adventurer running away from home and traveling with the novelist Leo Tolstoy while ""Journey of Radiance"" finds Indy learning about faith with Jiddu Krishnamurti. In ""Spring Break Adventure"" young Jones and his girlfriend visit the Thomas Edison laboratory, and later he is swept up in the Mexican Revolution after being kidnapped by Pancho Villa. ""Loves Sweet Song"" finds Indy mixed up in several love affairs, ending in an explosive Zeppelin raid and dinner with Winston Churchill.While most of these episodes contain quite a bit of educational elements, they make certain to entertain above all else.

1100743,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000VDDDVE,Tim Janson,"[13, 14]","Brother can you spare a week or two? That's about how long it's going to take you to get through this massive 12 disc boxed set, the first of three volumes showcasing the adventures of Young Indiana Jones. This show, originally broadcast on ABC from 1992 - 1993, and then later on the USA network, was one of the most ambitious television shows in history. Indiana Jones creator, George Lucas served as the series' Executive Producer and also wrote the bulk of the episodes. This was also one of the most expensive shows to produce as it was shot on location all around the world. The series is also one of the more complicated in terms of its chronology and production.First, episodes featured two different Young Indy's...there was Corey Carrier who played the character at approximately nine or ten years old, and then Sean Patrick Flanery who played Indy in his older teens and early 20's. Complicating matters was that the show was not presented chronologically. One week may be the younger Indy and the next, the older Indy. Now here's where it really gets interesting...a number of hour long episodes were pieced together to make a feature length film such as Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal in which the first half of the film feature Corey Carrier and the second half continues the story (Chronologically 8 years later) with the older Indy. HOWEVER, the DVD set is not piecing them together in the same way. The DVD set is presenting seven feature-length episode (two TV episodes) but doing it in more of a timeline/geographic order. (I told you it was complicated). They also renamed these episodes. Thus, the first Episode titled ""My First Adventure"" finds 9 year old Indy on the trail of a stolen Egyptian artifact but in the second half, he is now in Morocco being kidnapped by slavers and noticeably a bit older by a year or so.Indy's father is played by George Hall who sounds remarkably like Sean Connery. Henry Sr. has been asked to speak all over the world and takes his wife and young son with him on his journeys. Thus begins a life of adventure and archaeology! Throughout the series, Young Indy would frequently meet famous historical figures. In the opening episode, he meets British officer T.E. Lawrence (Of Lawrence of Arabia fame) as well as archaeologist Howard Carter, still several years away from finding King Tut's tomb. The Second episode, ""Passion for Life"" pairs original episodes ""British East Africa"" and ""Paris"" into the full length feature as Indy first meets President Teddy Roosevelt for a safari in Africa, and then a youthful Norman Rockwell in Paris.Once the emphasis shifts to the older, Sean Patrick Flanery Indy, the adventures and danger truly begin to ramp up as we can see the young man that will become the character of the feature Hollywood films and I was very impressed with Flanery's performance throughout the series. ""Spring Break Adventure"" features the teenaged Indy contending with German spies out to steal an invention of Thomas Edison, while the second half concludes the Curse of the Jackal storyline from the very first Young Indy episode in Egypt.The DVD set features a whopping 38 historical documentaries that are pertinent to the episodes they are paired with. For example, the My First Adventure episode features a 30 minute documentary on Howard Carter and the discovery of King Tut's tomb. The ""Spring Break adventure presents documentaries on Thomas Edison, Pancho Villa, General John Pershing, and more. What's truly wonderful about this set is that these documentaries would be a great addition to a middle school or even high school history class making this boxed set entertaining and educational. The subjects on the documentaries run the gamut from history to culture to social issues and philosophy. In fact, The History Channel acquired television rights to all 94 (from all three volumes of the DVD historical documentaries. The airing of the documentaries is meant to bring in ratings for the history channel and serve as marketing for the DVD release and the theatrical release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The History Channel and History International began airing the series every Saturday morning at 7AM/8C on The History Channel, and every Sunday morning at 8AM ET/PT on History International.
