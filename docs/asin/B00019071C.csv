In season 1, we meet most of the characters who will be important over the course of the show and get to know them. We also start to get some of the first bits and pieces of what will end up being longer story arcs. Aside from all of that though, there are a number of plain good stories that can pretty much stand on their own. Probably the only controversial aspect of the first season is the change of commanders that took place at the end. While the latter Sheridan ended up being a great character in his own right, most fans were probably disappointed that the Sinclair character, who was so good in the first season, did not come back except as a reference and a guest in a couple later episodes.

796347,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00019071C,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 3]","So, Babylon 5 narrowly avoided cancellation by the skin of its teeth in 1997 and was rescued by cable network TNT, who had purchased the repeat rights to the entire series and also agreed to finance the spin-off, Crusade. Whilst this decision initially pleased fans, it did concern those who had noted that J. Michael Straczynski had ended a lot of storylines in Season 4 to give better closure to the show if it had been cancelled. What was there left to tell?The year is now 2262. The Shadows and Vorlons have departed from the Galaxy, and the corrupt government of President Clarke on Earth has been pulled down. The other worlds have united under the banner of the Interplanetary Alliance, but much work remains to be done to cement the worlds into a cohesive force. The new Alliance faces internal and external challenges as the now-masterless former servants of the Shadows hunger for vengeance.Season 5 of Babylon 5 is its weakest and most problematic. The set-up for the season is good, but it has the feel of being the start of a whole new spin-off show, rather than the closing chapter of a story that's taken five years to tell. To suddenly go from stories of dramatic confrontation between former friends forced into being enemies, or stories of betrayal and consequences, to knockabout stand-alones about comedians visiting the station or a day in the life of two maintenance workers is rather jarring. The return of the stand-alone episodes after two years of very few stand-alones is unexpected and doesn't work very well, mainly as those stand-alones are merely repeating ground covered elsewhere, such as the Hyach/Hyach-do story which is a retread of the Centauri/Xon story covered much more briefly in Season 1. The season also suffers from the absence of several characters who left at the end of Season 4, most notably Claudia Christian as Commander Ivanova. Her replacement, Tracy Scoggins as Captain Lochley, gives it her all but comes off badly compared to her predecessor.The dominant arc plot of the first half of Season 5 is also interminable. A colony of telepaths opposed to Psi Corps is established on the station, led by the supposedly charismatic Byron ('supposedly' because we are only ever told this about him, but never see it for ourselves). Their storyline pointlessly rams home points about the Psi Corps that were established much more effectively and succinctly in Season 1's Mind War or Season 2's A Race Through Dark Places. The Psi Corps are an amoral, cruel, bullying lot of racial supremacists. We get it. Move on. A rare high-point in this first batch of episodes is Day of the Dead, written by Sandman creator Neil Gaiman, which is emotionally raw and gives Tracy Scoggins her best showcase in the series. However, an ill-advised subplot featuring celebrity magicians Penn and Teller misfires.Things pick up in the second half of the season, as the focus switches back to the Centauri. Centauri ships are secretly attacking trade vessels belonging to the other races, but Londo is being kept out of the loop. As the Alliance gathers evidence implicating the Centauri, Londo realises something is very badly wrong on Centauri Prime, the Narn realise they have an opportunity to repay the Centauri for what they did to their homeworld, and a severe lapse in Mr. Garibaldi's judgement results in thousands of civilian deaths. This is B5 as we know and love it, with characters making bad calls and others paying the price in blood, with dubious morality and pragmatism overcoming ideology along the way. It's a nicely-handled arc, culminating in the superb Fall of Centauri Prime, which saves the final season from being a total waste of time. Unfortunately, this episode is followed by a rather tediously long denouement in which characters spend a lot of time saying goodbye to one another as they are assigned to new posts and B5's importance dwindles as the Interstellar Alliance's HQ is transferred to Minbar.The series finale, Sleeping in Light, is an elegant and well-written episode which gives the show a real sense of closure, and is a fitting conclusion to this epic, huge saga.Season 5 of Babylon 5 (***) has many missteps that threaten to render the series unwatchable, but it recovers for a late-season burst of quality reminiscent of seasons 2 or 3 before reaching a satisfying conclusion.",3,B5's weakest season.,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,4348,"['So', 'Babylon', '5', 'narrowly', 'avoided', 'cancellation',

Following on the heels of hit series such as Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5 is unrivaled by any of its peers in its application of special effects. The brainchild of J. Michael Straczynski (writer for such shows as Murder She Wrote and Walker, Texas Ranger), the hour-long sci-fi drama series breaks new ground by deploying a five-season storyline that follows the outline of a traditional novel. As such, Babylon 5 is more like a mini-series that lasts five years instead of the usual three to five nights. And also unlike its predecessors, the series showcases original advanced technologies, believable alien characters (who speak alien and not English), and boasts of superb costume and makeup. Premiering in mid-season 1994, Babylon 5 established a solid audience and continues to inspire new generations of fans via syndicated reruns on cable...Babylon 5 follows the daily events that transpire on Babylon 5, a five-mile long space station from the year 2258. Built by the Earth Alliance, Babylon 5 orbits a lone planet in interplanetary (neutral) space. The setting for an Earthling military post and a transportation hub for businessmen and general travelers, the space station's primary purpose is to provide a safe haven for the airing of differences between the alien races. Similar in function to the United Nations, Babylon 5 is tasked with preserving the peace between the five primary space-traveling civilizations - the Earth Alliance, the Mimbari Federation, the Centauri Republic, the Narn Regime, and the Vorlon Empire. Headed by Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare), and later by Capt. John J. Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner), Babylon 5 is home to almost 300,000 humans and their alien counterparts. With so many confined to such a small area, the space station is ripe for internal struggle, racial conflict, regular cast members' personal problems, and showdowns between various political interests. It's this intricate and diverse storyboard, coupled with amazing visual effects, that makes Babylon 5 one of the most successful sci-fi TV shows in recent memory...The Babylon 5 (Season 5) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""No Compromises"" in which Sheridan is replaced when Capt. Elizabeth Lochley takes command of Babylon 5 and Byron petitions for her asylum to the sanctuary of Babylon 5. Meanwhile, a conspiracy evolves to assassin Capt. Sheridan at his presidential inauguration... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""In the Kingdom of the Blind"" in which Byron lobbies to create a home world for telepaths, and ""Sleeping in Light"" in which Sheridan invites his closest friends to gather around him as he bids farewell to his waning life force (the series finale)...Below is a list of episodes included on the Babylon 5 (Season 5) DVD:Episode 89 (No

So we start season 5 with a slimmer cast, a new storyline regarding the telepaths, that most agree was quite weak and some new actors that are not as charismatic as the ones left behind, giving an overall feeling of anticlimax to the show, at least during the first half of the season.However the show picks up midway with a great storyline regarding Londo and the legacy of the shadows on Centauri Prime. This is a great great piece of dramatic story writing that I enjoyed immensely.The show ultimately ends with the masterpiece episode ""Sleeping in Light"" that had me and my boyfriend crying so much we had to pause the DVD several times to catch our breath. This is such a melancholic and moving and profound episode, that ends the story beautifully and brilliantly. It is one of the best episodes of B5 and one of the best ends to a show I have ever seen. It is worth buying the fifth season for this episode alone.In conclusion, I would like to say that the B5 series is a masterpiece sci-fi series and such a fabulous novel for television.

796355,AHEDL40TI0KB5,B00019071C,C. Hoekstra,"[7, 7]","The fifth and final season of Babylon 5 managed to do what very few television series ever manage; it ended where it wanted to end and with an episode amongst the most potent in the entire series, not to mention television history. While just about the entire last quarter of this season is about saying goodbye as all the characters we've come to know and love through the preceding five years as they move off towards their own fate, the final episode with Sheriden's death is the most moving all of them.The technical aspects of this season are naturally the best of the five. While season 4 contained space battles that still manage to spank pretty much everything out there, in this season everything looks its best. The detail paid by the graphic artists to all the ships and stations is outstanding and indicative of the mind set that went into all aspects of creating Babylon 5. (ie, to do amazing things with almost nothing.)Story wise, season five is darker than those before it. The consequences of their choices come back to haunt characters like Mollari and Garibaldi. Here, Babylon 5 reminds us that it is not a show that wraps up such things quickly and easily, and that we have to live with whatever we've done. It's a shame that season 4 had to be so compressed, because the whole arc about the first stages of the telepath wars that results in this series is not Babylon 5's greatest moment. On the plus side, it gives the excuse to use Walter Koenig's fascinatingly evil character of Bester just as much as they did in the previous season (4 episodes, ep 6, 10, 11, 13). Considering his strength in this role, it's a true shame he's not been able to break away from the Chekov character and find roles in other works.But, for every good thing there must be a bad. While Bester is back in full use, we are sorely lacking for Ivanova. It's a true shame she was unable to return. Tracy Scoggins does an admirable job as Capt. Lochley, but she just wasn't around long enough for us to really get to know her well enough.The extras on the DVD are what fans have come to expect of the set. All of them are quite fascinating. The easter egg this time is a small featurette on the fate of Marcus Cole, whether he was left for dead or frozen in hopes of revival. It even incorporates fan opinions on the issue. Though if anyone has paid really close attention (and has a large enough TV) they'll be able to see the final outcome during the credits of the final episode. Beyond Babylon is probably the most interesting segment of the featurettes this time, as it details Joe's vision of the universe and the fans that supported it through its run.Unlike the previous season, the cast commentary is great. While dominated by Boxleitner and Scoggins, everyone gets their fare share at voicing an opinion. Like the ones from previous seasons, it's extremely funny and will leave you wishing they had put more of them into other episodes. It also makes you realize just how perfect everything worked behind the scenes (with the exception of the managers at WB, but they were always problems for this series). Joe's two segments are interesting as always, and the one he gives during the final episode is very revealing as he talks about his own direction of the end of his series.Ultimately, Babylon 5 endured and conquered its opposition. It lasted for the five years that Joe had originally planned and, according to him, ~95% of everything he wanted to do with it made it to the screen. And unlike a majority of television, the story of Babylon 5 truly ended, though the characters and their world would go on. While not the best of the series, it was an excellent ending.",5,"Finished what it wanted to, but still ended too soon.",1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,3680,"['fifth', 'final', 'season', 'Babylon', '5', 'managed', 'do', 'what', 'very', 'few', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'manage', 'ended', 'where', 'wanted', 'end', 'episode', 'most', 'potent', 'entire', 'series', 'not', 'mention', 'television', 'history', 'just', 'entire', 'last', 'quarter', 'season', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'preceding', 'five', 'years', 'move', 'towards', 'own', 'fate', 'final', 'episode', 'Sheriden', 'death', 'most', 'moving', 'them.The', 'technical', 'aspects', 'season', 'are', 'naturally', 'best', 'five', 'season', '4', 'contained', 'space', 'battles', 'still', 'manage', 'spank', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'there', 'season', 'everything', 'best', 'detail', 'paid', 'graphic', 'artists', 'ships', 'stations', 'outstanding', 'indicative', 'mind', 'set', 'went', 'aspects', 'creating', 'Babylon', '5', 'ie', 'do', 'amazing', 'things', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Story', 'wise', 'season', 'five', 'darker', 'consequences', 'choices', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'characters', 'Mollari', 'Garibaldi', 'Here', 'Babylon', '5', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'such', 'things', 'quickly', 'easily', 'have', 'live', ""'ve"", 'done', 'shame', 'season', '4', 'had', 'be', 'so', 'compressed', 'whole', 'arc', 'first', 'stages', 'telepath', 'wars', 'results', 'series', 'not', 'Babylon', '5', 'greatest', 'moment', 'plus', 'side', 'excuse', 'use', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'fascinatingly', 'evil', 'character', 'Bester', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'previous', 'season', '4', 'episodes', 'ep', '6', '10', '11', '13', 'Considering', 'strength', 'role', 'true', 'shame', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'break', 'away', 'Chekov', 'character', 'find', 'roles', 'other', 'works.But', 'good', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'bad', 'Bester', 'back', 'full', 'use', 'are', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'Ivanova', 'true', 'shame', 'was', 'unable', 'return', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'admirable', 'job', 'Capt', 'Lochley', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'well', 'enough.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'what', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'set', 'are', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'easter', 'egg', 'time', 'small', 'featurette', 'fate', 'Marcus', 'Cole', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'frozen', 'hopes', 'revival', 'even', 'fan', 'opinions', 'issue', 'anyone', 'paid', 'really', 'close', 'attention', 'large', 'enough', 'TV', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'final', 'outcome', 'credits', 'final', 'episode', 'Beyond', 'Babylon', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'segment', 'featurettes', 'time', 'details', 'Joe', 'vision', 'universe', 'fans', 'supported', 'run.Unlike', 'previous', 'season', 'cast', 'commentary', 'great', 'dominated', 'Boxleitner', 'Scoggins', 'everyone', 'fare', 'share', 'voicing', 'opinion', 'ones', 'previous', 'seasons', 'extremely', 'funny', 'will', 'leave', 'wishing', 'had', 'put', 'more', 'other', 'episodes', 'also', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'perfect', 'everything', 'worked', 'scenes', 'exception', 'managers', 'WB', 'were', 'always', 'problems', 'series', 'Joe', 'two', 'segments', 'are', 'interesting', 'always', 'one', 'final', 'episode', 'very', 'revealing', 'own', 'direction', 'end', 'series.Ultimately', 'Babylon', '5', 'endured', 'conquered', 'opposition', 'lasted', 'five', 'years', 'Joe', 'had', 'originally', 'planned', 'according', '~95', '%', 'everything', 'wanted', 'do', 'made', 'screen', 'majority', 'television', 'story', 'Babylon', '5', 'truly', 'ended', 'characters', 'world', 'would', 'go', 'not', 'best', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'ending']",N/A

I watched the first season of B5 when I was 14, and never got around to seeing the rest until after finishing my post-graduate work recently. With time on my hands, i've watched the 5 seasons over the past 3 months, and am very glad that I did. To use the cliche; they just don't make em like this any more. The storyline is diverse, complex, has satisfying space-action sequences, and enormous character depth. I was initially put off by the very slow starting of season 5, but was enthralled by the concluding storylines.

If my title doesn't quite make sense to you yet, maybe it will after finishing my review...Watching Babylon 5 was great--what an excellent show. From Season 1 to Season 4, every season had been an improvement on the one before it; a carefully crafted piece of science-fiction, where everything had its place, leading up to a mind-blowing climax.Unfortunately for Season 5, the mind-blowing climax came during Season 4.Yes, almost everything (save the telepath situation) that the show had introduced and systematically built up was satisfactorily resolved somewhere in the fourth season. Further, the final episode of the fourth season shows us what takes place in the future, looking back on Babylon 5. It has the feel of finality about it. After watching Season 4, it *feels* as though the show has come to a conclusion, and so.......one watches Season 5 out of well-deserved love for the show, but there's no real sense of urgency left. The bad guys have been defeated, and we know exactly what the future holds in store for our characters (it's been shown to us in that finale for Season 4 and various other flashbacks). The drama of Babylon 5 has ebbed away, and so you watch it for the sense of closure. Indeed, the fifth season is like one, drawn-out denouement.It's kind of like the fourth quarter of a blow-out SuperBowl: the game's outcome has been established--you know who's going to win, so there's no drama there--but you can't not watch, because it's the *SuperBowl*; you have to watch it.Maybe it would've been best for the show to have gone out on the high-note of the end of Season 4. These episodes are by no means bad, but they do not have the vibrancy or the drama of the seasons which preceeded them, and they also suffer from the lack of many of the regulars we've come to love (Ivanova and Marcus are gone; Lennier, Vir and Londo make irregular appearances) and they suffer even more from the unwanted addition of the new captain.In all, three stars.",3,Like the Fourth Quarter of a Blow-out SuperBowl,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,2127,"[""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'title', 'review', 'will', 'resonate', 'everyone', 'was', 'searching', 'analogy', 'would', 'fit', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'title', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'sense', 'yet', 'maybe', 'will', 'finishing', 'review', 'Watching', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'great', 'what', 'excellent', 'show', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '4', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'improvement', 'one', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'piece', 'science-fiction', 'where', 'everything', 'had', 'place', 'leading', 'up', 'mind-blowing', 'climax.Unfortunately', 'Season', '5', 'mind-blowing', 'climax', 'came', 'Season', '4.Yes', 'almost', 'everything', 'save', 'telepath', 'situation', 'show', 'had', 'introduced', 'systematically', 'built', 'up', 'was', 'satisfactorily', 'resolved', 'somewhere', 'fourth', 'season', 'Further', 'final', 'episode', 'fourth', 'season', 'place', 'future', 'looking', 'back', 'Babylon', '5', 'feel', 'finality', 'watching', 'Season', '4', '*feels*', 'show', 'come', 'conclusion', 'so', '.one', 'watches', 'Season', '5', 'well-deserved', 'love', 'show', 'real', 'sense', 'urgency', 'left', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'defeated', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'future', 'store', 'characters', 'been', 'shown', 'finale', 'Season', '4', 'various', 'other', 'flashbacks', 'drama', 'Babylon', '5', 'ebbed', 'away', 'so', 'watch', 'sense', 'closure', 'Indeed', 'fifth', 'season', 'one', 'drawn-out', 'denouement.It', 'kind', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'blow-out', 'SuperBowl', 'game', 'outcome', 'been', 'established', 'know', 'who', 'going', 'win', 'drama', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'not', 'watch', '*SuperBowl*', 'have', 'watch', 'it.Maybe', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'high-note', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'are', 'means', 'bad', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'vibrancy', 'drama', 'seasons', 'preceeded', 'also', 'suffer', 'lack', 'many', 'regulars', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'Ivanova', 'Marcus', 'are', 'gone', 'Lennier', 'Vir', 'Londo', 'make', 'irregular', 'appearances', 'suffer', 'even', 'more', 'unwanted', 'addition', 'new', 'captain.In', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

Better than most television, and infinitely better than most science fiction series.The pacing is a little different because the series creator was prepared to end the series at the conclusion of the fourth season.  However, Babylon 5 got renewed for a fifth season, allowing the series to take off in a different, unexpected direction.The season starts off incredibly strong with ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"", an episode shot with Season 5 but broadcast during season 4.  This unusual effort looks back on the B5 story 1 year, 100 years, 500 years, 1000 years, and 1,000,000 years in the future. We find that even the victors in war pay a price.The cast isn't as engaged in fighting their fictional war, but what they do this season is take off in different directions.  Londo and G'Kar find peace, Lennier finds a purpose, and Garibaldi is revealed as the truly tragic character of the series.  Claudia Christian is missed, but Tracy Scoggins does a fine job as Commander Lochley.Later we are given some arc- and non-arc treats. I'm partial to ""Day of the Dead"", an episode which revisits dead characters as part of an alien ceremony.

We know that Londo Mollari is ultimately damned, but watching him hand over his soul is wrenching anyway.  Lita Alexander -- watch out for her special Vorlon touch.

796366,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B00019071C,Eric J. Anderson,"[6, 10]","Babylon 5 had four 4-star seasons, but the fourth season concluded a bit abruptly. Much was compressed into the final episodes to finish the main story arc, just in case the series wasn't renewed for the planned fifth year. That was sub-optimal, but the writers pulled it off. When the series was resurrected on cable for the last year, there was a bit of a vacuum in terms of a story to tell.The logical progression would have been to concentrate on the looming war between humans and telepaths (a war telegraphed in season four when ex-Security Chief Garibaldi was mind-screwed by telepath Bester, and planted in the top levels of a mega-corporation secretly developing a biological weapon specifically designed to kill telepaths). The fifth season was a perfect opportunity for this war to finally come to fruition, though admittedly it might have been difficult to tell this story from Babylon 5, being as the action probably would have occurred mostly on earth. Nevertheless, I feel this would have been a better option than the modest plot developments season five was wasted on.In the first eight episodes or so, instead of a war between telepaths and normal humans, we got a conflict between Psi-Corps telepaths and non-Psi-Corps telepaths, occurring on Babylon 5 itself. Then Garibaldi finds he has been blocked from taking his revenge on Bester, and falls back into the whiskey bottle again. The other major plot theme in season five is the mysterious attacks on Alliance vessels, attacks which are eventually discovered to be coming from Centauri ships. Yet we learn more as time progresses -- not all is as it seems. The Centauri are falling victim to covert influences, and Londo himself eventually succumbs. A new captain of Babylon 5 is brought in by Sheridan, so that Sheridan can devote his time to the alliance. The new captain is given little of substance to do, however.All these plot arcs and sub-plots are quite an anticlimax compared to the galaxy-changing conflicts in season four. The writing suffers and even the actors are perhaps not up to their usual standards because of it. The special effects are better than ever, but this is a minor triumph, as it is in the service of substandard Babylon 5 stories. All dressed up and nowhere to go is the motto of Babylon 5 season five.Many have praised the final episode, Remain in Light, as if it justifies the mediocrity of the rest of the fifth season. Honestly, I found the series finale in the same mode. It was slow, and positively dreary. Yes, I felt a lump in my throat at the end, too. If you have followed Sheridan through the previous four seasons, how could you not be moved when his number finally comes up? Still, it all plays a bit like a wake for a man who isn't quite dead yet.Also, I don't think I will spoil anything by saying that as John Sheridan passes from this life to ""beyond the rim,"" his beloved Babylon 5 is being demolished because it is a ""menace to interstellar navigation."" Huh? How is a Babylon 5 turned into tiny pieces of space junk orbiting the planet LESS of a menace to navigation?! It's just stupid. They should have crashed the station, as a whole, into the planet, to remove the obstacle. That kind of inattention to detail is emblematic of the problems of season five.Fans will want to see these shows. They certainly aren't BAD. I cannot believe they will have the same replay value for me as the first 88 episodes from seasons 1-4. I rate those seasons four stars, because they had their imperfections (there is a lot of ""grade inflation"" in the ratings at amazon.com). Yet, they represent perhaps the most consistent and endearing episodic science fiction TV ever made. In season five, the show was coasting on its laurels. Lateral drift.

This Season like the first three like a fine wine was thankfully given time to breathe and although overall was not as strong as the third season, was especially toward the end and very worthy way to end what is one of the best tv sci-fi series of all time.  The last episode was a tear-jerker and extremely moving with fine acting performances especially from Mira Furlan.While there is no faulting the content of the fifth season overall, I do have an issue with the picture and sound quality which is poor although admittedly a lot better than for seasons 1 & 2. Even when watching this on a Blu-ray player that upscales to 1080p the improvement is slight and many imperfections like dirt, specks, white and black spots, some clear frames and many soft/blurred ones are obvious plus the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option doesn't quite make the most of the property as the sound is still pretty much coming from the front speakers.I hear that Warner may be releasing the entire series on blu-ray soon and if so I do hope they don't stinge on this and take the full time and expense to make the many, many improvements that are needed to bring this close to what one could describe as blu-ray reference quality. I thought Star Trek TOS blu-ray did an admirable job in their recent release and if that kind of blu-ray quality can be done on a 40-year old master surely we can expect a whole lot better from a much, much younger master!I wait with great anticipation to see what Warner has in store for a hopefully sci-fi blu-ray set to set the standard for the rest to follow.",4,And So It Ends ....

Its not the storyline that I have a problem with it is the characterization of two of the new arrivals Byron and Lockley.  Byron is idiotic and self pitying, Lockley is like John Shedian without the sense of humor like the Starfleet Captain Janeway unless she is lecturing someone she isn't happy.  JMS brought her on in an effort to appeal to the Ivonova vote but the tactic does not work.The episodes themselves are fine and the season does recover a great deal towards the end especially the final sacrifice of Londo in ""The Fall of Centauri Prime"" but the first half of the season is so ponderous as to be almost un-watchable.

796373,A1STH8DSV1KSXU,B00019071C,Graham Pilato,"[2, 4]","Okay, so that's a pretty pretentious review title.  But the color brown DOES rule the soul of this season, and the art direction as well. What's left of the grand plan of Babylon 5 is engraved in auburn and a path of lovely long telepath locks.It's a year of beautiful CG and great music, epic finales, and epics extended.  Dominant hues were an earthy brown of spirtual decay and rejuventation, fertile and decadent at once, an elongated dunking in chocolate mousse of gilded swollen lions,  a golden diminishing into bronze, and then a sallow grey as the new villain aliens plan and wait, creepily, behind the scenes.This is a worthy season at the end, but frustrated, surely, by the lack of wit and momentum in its first half, coupled with some seriously unsympathetic telepaths that only occasionally got my honest interest.Burn 'em, yeah.The 5th Season - ""Wheel of Fire"" - the Denouement. The first half averages 6 out of 10 and the second half averages 8 out of 10.Because a long-term fan should be the only type of person watching the last five episodes - and that's what I was when I saw them - I suppose I believe my opinions are appropriately biased and sentimental regarding these episodes.  I imagine that if those episodes were the first I had ever seen of the series, my ratings would average much lower.There is a whole lot in the last episodes here, like in the experience of anyone reading the last few pages of a novel, that should not be seen by anyone unawares, regardless of what may interest one there to read the rest of the novel they might have missed in the process of finding it.  These several episodes are simply about closure and are very exclusively themed and toned to the viewer who has seen everything prior.The entire season, really, plays with about the kind of finaletime tone that one is liable only to find in the very last episode of any other series, generally.  Generally, enjoy the end.  Enjoy Londo and G'Kar again.  This season is really mostly for them once the station telepaths arc is resolved.Wisely, JMS set up much potential for Crusade and B5 novels here. There was a mastermind at work here, folks, no question, but also there was preparation to continue on with so, so much. And this is why I can accept even so much left vague and trailing off into the future.  The series here was B5 and not an extended history of wars.  Let those lost conflicts be in future histories.  These five years are good.Surely, in the end, JMS did end his series well, but I have a great doubt about the final necessity of such obsession with the trivia of the pretty psychics and the station captain's marriages.  Heaven forbid a soap opera in space may emerge where there once was an incredible epic, but occasionally, especially early on and then at the end of this season, that does threaten to happen.The year was far less important to anyone who had watched the whole series thus far than they were led to believe it would be by what came before.  Of course, it was worthy and it was occasionally utterly brilliant. However, I think it also appeared far more planned to perfection, far less spontaneously, cracklingly brilliant than what came before.I think the big genius man blew his wad on the fourth season and here he smoked his cigarettes and drove home.But what a night. And what a deep, dark and dreamily brown-ish drive.",4,"Brown Rules the Soul, and the Remaining Ideas Decline",1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,3369,"['Okay', 'pretty', 'pretentious', 'review', 'title', 'color', 'brown', 'DOES', 'rule', 'soul', 'season', 'art', 'direction', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'left', 'grand', 'plan', 'Babylon', '5', 'engraved', 'auburn', 'path', 'lovely', 'long', 'telepath', 'locks.It', 'year', 'beautiful', 'CG', 'great', 'music', 'epic', 'finales', 'epics', 'extended', 'Dominant', 'hues', 'were', 'earthy', 'brown', 'spirtual', 'decay', 'rejuventation', 'fertile', 'decadent', 'once', 'elongated', 'dunking', 'chocolate', 'mousse', 'gilded', 'swollen', 'lions', 'golden', 'diminishing', 'bronze', 'then', 'sallow', 'grey', 'new', 'villain', 'aliens', 'plan', 'wait', 'creepily', 'scenes.This', 'worthy', 'season', 'end', 'frustrated', 'surely', 'lack', 'wit', 'momentum', 'first', 'half', 'coupled', 'seriously', 'unsympathetic', 'telepaths', 'only', 'occasionally', 'got', 'honest', 'interest.Burn', 'yeah.The', '5th', 'Season', 'Wheel', 'Fire', 'Denouement', 'first', 'half', 'averages', '6', '10', 'second', 'half', 'averages', '8', '10.Because', 'long-term', 'fan', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'type', 'person', 'watching', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'suppose', 'believe', 'opinions', 'are', 'appropriately', 'biased', 'sentimental', 'regarding', 'episodes', 'imagine', 'episodes', 'were', 'first', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'ratings', 'would', 'average', 'much', 'lower.There', 'whole', 'lot', 'last', 'episodes', 'here', 'experience', 'anyone', 'reading', 'last', 'few', 'pages', 'novel', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'unawares', 'regardless', 'what', 'may', 'interest', 'one', 'there', 'read', 'rest', 'novel', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'process', 'finding', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'simply', 'closure', 'are', 'very', 'exclusively', 'themed', 'toned', 'viewer', 'who', 'seen', 'everything', 'prior.The', 'entire', 'season', 'really', 'plays', 'kind', 'finaletime', 'tone', 'one', 'liable', 'only', 'find', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'other', 'series', 'generally', 'Generally', 'end', 'Enjoy', 'Londo', ""G'Kar"", 'again', 'season', 'really', 'mostly', 'once', 'station', 'telepaths', 'arc', 'resolved.Wisely', 'JMS', 'set', 'up', 'much', 'potential', 'Crusade', 'B5', 'novels', 'here', 'was', 'mastermind', 'work', 'here', 'folks', 'question', 'also', 'was', 'preparation', 'continue', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'can', 'accept', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'vague', 'trailing', 'off', 'future', 'series', 'here', 'was', 'B5', 'not', 'extended', 'history', 'wars', 'Let', 'lost', 'conflicts', 'be', 'future', 'histories', 'five', 'years', 'are', 'good.Surely', 'end', 'JMS', 'did', 'end', 'series', 'well', 'have', 'great', 'doubt', 'final', 'necessity', 'such', 'obsession', 'trivia', 'pretty', 'psychics', 'station', 'captain', 'marriages', 'Heaven', 'forbid', 'soap', 'opera', 'space', 'may', 'emerge', 'where', 'once', 'was', 'incredible', 'epic', 'occasionally', 'especially', 'early', 'then', 'end', 'season', 'threaten', 'happen.The', 'year', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'course', 'was', 'worthy', 'was', 'occasionally', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'However', 'think', 'also', 'appeared', 'far', 'more', 'planned', 'perfection', 'far', 'less', 'spontaneously', 'cracklingly', 'brilliant', 'what', 'came', 'before.I', 'think', 'big', 'genius', 'man', 'blew', 'wad', 'fourth', 'season', 'here', 'smoked', 'cigarettes', 'drove', 'home.But', 'what', 'night', 'what', 'deep', 'dark', 'dreamily', 'brown-ish', 'drive']",N/A

The season starts out by introducing the new Babylon 5 Captain, Elizabeth Lockley, an Earth Force Captain who faught for Clark's regime during the civil war, creating an interesting dynamic between herself, Sheridan, Dellen, and Garibaldi.  We are also introduced to the machinations of the Inter Stellar Alliance.Much of what Sheridan feared in Season Four comes to fruition with the legacy of the Vorlons and Shadows causing the paramount issues through out the year, and his Grandfather's quote, ""The duration is longer than the war,"" is explained through action, consequence, and chance.Much of the drama involved with the telepath crisis is sucked dry due to Ivannava's absence, with Lyta evoling to capture and express much of the emotional struggles.  It is her story sallied with the character of Byron where the show fails to capture the force that was prevelent throughout the previous two and a half seasons, but fear not, their story dominates for a mere four episodes, and with other story lines developing the grand finally along the way, these episdes are not a complete loss.After the telepath struggle, we get into what I consider to be JMS's best work, with Londo and G'kar's relationship developing from hatred to wry friendship.  It is here where we see Straczynski pull the carpet out from under us as he uses the entire previous four season of emotions he evoked from us to show us that we are responsible for what we do, for good or ill.

796382,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00019071C,John Kwok,"[5, 9]","J. Michael Straczynski's apt title for the fifth and final season of ""Babylon 5"", ""The Wheel of Fire"" is a suitable summary of what transpires. In the aftermath of the Shadow War and the successful rebellion against EarthGov's President Clark, John Sheridan is elected President of the Interstellar Alliance. However, all is not peace and tranquility, as he must soon contend with a telepath crisis on Babylon 5 involving the followers of ex-Psi Cop Byron (Robin Atkin Downes), and tensions between the Alliance and the Centauri Republic.Here's a list of the episodes:1. No Compromises (Captain Elizabeth Lochley arrives as B5's new commander and Sheridan is approached by Byron to create a telepath colony on the station.)2. The Very Long Night of Londo Mollari (Londo comes to terms with his mortality after suffering a nearly fatal heart attack. Lennier arrives at a momentuous decision which will have tragic consequences towards the end of the season.)3. The Paragon of Animals (Garibaldi seeks Byron's assistance in creating an Interstellar Alliance intelligence unit comprised of telepaths.)4. A View from the Gallery (Maintenance workers offer a unique perspective on living and working aboard B5 as the station is attacked by mysterious aliens.)5. Learning Curve (Delenn is reunited with an old friend, a Minbari ranger, while his students stop a racketeer's attempt to seize control of Downbelow's Brown Sector.)6. Strange Relations (Londo avoids an assassination attempt, and G'Kar becomes his bodyguard.)7. Secrets of the Soul (Franklin discovers a deadly secret about an Interstellar Alliance race, while Downbelow objects to the presence of Byron's telepath colony.)8. Day of the Dead (Neil Gaiman penned this script about a Brakiri religious festival, in which Lennier, Garibaldi and Lochley must come to grips with their worst fears. Comedic duo Penn and Teller portray the interstellar comedic sensation Rebo and Zooty.)9. In the Kingdom of the Blind (Byron tries to blackmail the Interstellar Alliance into giving his telepath colony a world of its own.)10. A Tragedy of Telepaths (Lochley finally seeks Sheridan's permission to have Bester and his Psi Cops remove Byron's colony.)11. Phoenix Rising (The telepath crisis is finally resolved, but not until after several deaths, and a final decision made by Byron.)12. The Ragged Edge (G'Kar returns to Babylon 5, and to his dismay, discovers that his book was published, transforming him into a prophet hailed by countless fellow Narn. Garibaldi seeks out a possible human witness of a Raider attack, and stumbles accidentally on evidence implicating the Centauri Republic in thses attacks.)13. The Corps is Mother, the Corps is Father (Bester's ""humanity"" is revealed as he trains two young Psi Cop apprentices in apprehending a dangerous rogue telepath who has fled to Bester's ""favorite"" place, Babylon 5.)14. Meditations on the Abyss (With Delenn's blessing, Lennier joins a White Star to uncover evidence pointing to Centauri involvement in the Raider attacks against Alliance shipping. Meanwhile Londo is officially appointed Prime Minister of the Centauri Republic, and he appoints Vir as his successor as ambassador to Babylon 5.)15. Darkness Ascending (Lennier risks losing his life in uncovering key evidence proving Centauri involvement in the Raider attacks against shipping. Lyta seeks a homeworld for the telepaths, offering a Faustian bargain with G'Kar.)16. And All My Dreams, Torn Asunder (The Interstellar Alliance receives proof of Centauri involvement in the attacks against Alliance shipping, and authorizes a blockade of Centauri space.)17. Movements of Fire and Shadow (Sheridan orders the White Star fleet to intervene in an unauthorized attack on Centauri Prime by some Alliance (Drazi and Narn) warships.)18. The Fall of Centauri Prime (Sheridan arrives too late to stop the attack. Meanwhile the Drakh reveal themselves to Londo and obtain his obediance by threatening the Centauri homeworld with total annihilation. He is crowned Emperor soon after the Regent's death.)19. The Wheel of Fire (EarthGov issues a warrant for Lyta's arrest. She is seized and held in B5's brig. Meanwhile G'Kar must contend with his religious followers.)20. Objects in Motion (Garibaldi is warned that an assassin has arrived on Babylon 5, intending to kill him and his fiance, Lise Edgars. G'Kar joins in the plot organized by Sheridan to foil the assassination attempt.)21. Objects at Rest (Sheridan and Delenn bid farewell to Babylon 5, bound for the new Alliance capitol, the city of Tuzenor on Minbar. En route Lennier makes a terrible, almost tragic, mistake. Dr. Franklin departs Babylon 5 for his new duties as head of EarthForce's medical department back at EarthDome, Geneva, Switzerland.)22. Sleeping in Light (Written and filmed at the end of Season Four, when there was a strong possibility that Babylon 5 would not be renewed for a fifth season, this episode is a fitting conclusion to the series. It is set twenty years after the events chronicled in Season Four, when Sheridan asks his friends to visit him for the last time in his home on Minbar, knowing that his time - extended by Lorien on Z'Ha'Dum - is almost up. Series creator J. Michael Straczynski plays a B5 technician towards the end of the episode.)Warner Brothers has done a fine job in digital remastering of these episodes. As before, it is replete with interviews with cast members and J. Michael Straczynski's comments of several key episodes.",5,"Excellent, but not the best B5: ""The Wheel of Fire""",1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,5501,"['J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'apt', 'title',

Michael Straczynski had a detailed plan for a story that would unfold over five years.  Unfortunately, during the fourth season, it was extremely doubtful that the fifth season would be made.  The PTEN network, which was distributing the show, was collapsing, and there were no other takers.As a result, Straczynski packed more story into season four (in case the series was cancelled), and when the last-minute intervention of TNT saved the show, there wasn't quite enough plot left over.  In addition, TNT insisted on cutting production time by two days per episode, which means that both cast and crew had to make do with fewer rehearsals, less time to shoot and edit.  It's not suprising that so many episodes have a flat, almost colorless feel to them.The real disaster, of course, was the loss of lead actress Claudia Christian.  While her replacement, Tracy Scoggins, surprised me, there's no time left to fully develop a new character, and Scoggins doesn't have the chance to grow into the role.  Even so, Christian's character was such an integral part of the series that her absence is palpable.In spite of these flaws, there are some good episodes, as Londo becomes Emperor (a mixed blessing, to be sure), and the saga of Centauri Prime comes to a close.  This plot line contains the only real drama in Season 5, which is more of a an epilogue than a continuation of the series.As a die-hard fan, I enjoyed Season 5 anyway, but it's true that the series could easily have ended with Season 4.",3,A Weak Ending,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1595,"['Babylon', '5', 'was', 'always', 'intended', 'run', 'five', 'seasons', 'more', 'less', 'Series', 'creator', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'had', 'detailed', 'plan', 'story', 'would', 'unfold', 'five', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'extremely', 'doubtful', 'fifth', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'PTEN', 'network', 'was', 'distributing', 'show', 'was', 'collapsing', 'were', 'other', 'takers.As', 'result', 'Straczynski', 'packed', 'more', 'story', 'season', 'four', 'case', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'when', 'last-minute', 'intervention', 'TNT', 'saved', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'plot', 'left', 'over', 'addition', 'TNT', 'insisted', 'cutting', 'production', 'time', 'two', 'days', 'episode', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'fewer', 'rehearsals', 'less', 'time', 'shoot', 'edit', 'not', 'suprising', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'flat', 'almost', 'colorless', 'feel', 'them.The', 'real', 'disaster', 'course', 'was', 'loss', 'lead', 'actress', 'Claudia', 'Christian', 'replacement', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'surprised', 'time', 'left', 'fully', 'develop', 'new', 'character', 'Scoggins', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'grow', 'role', 'Even', 'so', 'Christian', 'character', 'was', 'such', 'integral', 'part', 'series', 'absence', 'palpable.In', 'spite', 'flaws', 'are', 'good', 'episodes', 'Londo', 'Emperor', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'be', 'sure', 'saga', 'Centauri', 'Prime', 'close', 'plot', 'line', 'only', 'real', 'drama', 'Season', '5', 'more', 'epilogue', 'continuation', 'series.As', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '5', 'anyway', 'true', 'series', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'ended', 'Season', '4']",N/A
796387,A16X61RLY1YJL7,B00019071C,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[6, 6]","Can mere words do justice to the phenomenon that was Babylon 5, the show that critics said wouldn't make it past its pilot episode and then they said it wouldn't make past season after season?  Critics obviously don't always get it right do they?  Simply stated, Babylon 5 was an incredible series, the memory of which lingers on today and well into the future.No television series since the original Star Trek had created such an outpouring of support like Babylon 5 has.  The reasons are simple; a five year/chapter arc on an amazing epical story stirred the imagination from the very first episode of the first season to the last episode of the last season; incredibly intelligent dialogue that was both entertaining and humorous at times; a larger than life character in Captain John Sheridan; shocking CGI graphics that were a credit to the shows producers considering when the series was made and ultimately the care and attention to detail that the shows creator and main writer, J. Michael Straczynski put into every episode.The one and only true disappointment of the fifth season was Claudia Christian's decision to not return as Ivanova!  It's rather strange that in Sci-Fi shows there seems to be a point when major actresses who are integral to the show like to leave before the party is over.While the fifth season, &quot;The Wheel of Fire&quot; didn't quite always have the epic style of the fourth season which was a difficult season to follow up considering how amazing it was, it does have its own flavor of intrigue that fans of the series came to love.As much as J. Michael Straczynski and the shows producers are to be commended for the creation of this wonderful series, the actors who made it possible deserve as much credit and acclaim as well!  Without the incredible performances given by the following actors, Babylon 5 might've been &quot;just another&quot; space opera: Bruce Boxleitner, Jerry Doyle, Mira Furlan, Richard Biggs, Bill Mumy, Tracy Scoggins, Stephen Furst, Jeff Conaway, Patricia Tallman, Peter Jurasik and Andreas Katsulas.Highlights of the fifth and final season:-Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) takes over as commander of Babylon 5.-The new Interstellar Alliance struggles in its early days but ultimately proves worthy of its goals.-Londo Mollari sees his prophetic dreams come true as he ascends from Prime Minister to Emperor but he must pay the terrible price that his dreams foresaw.-Every member race of the Alliance endures mysterious attacks on its civilian cargo transports...-Garibaldi faces one of his worst fears as an old problem renews itself.-The pending war between telepaths and mundanes sees its early stages.-G'Kar becomes a religious icon-The &quot;Fall of Centauri Prime.&quot;-&quot;Sleeping in Light&quot;- An incredibly poignant and wonderfully well portrayed final episode.  Oddly enough, due to fears that the show would end at the end of the fourth season, this episode was filmed at that time but put on the backburner when the fifth season was approved.Overall, I highly recommend not only this season but the first four seasons and the pilot episodes which are on DVD and any future releases of Babylon 5 on DVD.  Few shows have ever kindled the imagination and fed the fires of Science Fiction fans such as this series has!  {ssintrepid}Episode List:Season/Chapter 5 - The Wheel of Fire-No Compromises-The Very Long Night of Londo Mollari-The Paragon of Animals-A View from the Gallery-Learning Curve-Strange Relations-Secrets of the Soul-Day of the Dead-In the Kingdom of the Blind-A Tragedy of Telepaths-Phoenix Rising-The Ragged Edge-The Corps is Mother, The Corps is Father-Meditations on the Abyss-Darkness Ascending-And all my Dreams, Torn Asunder-Movements of Fire and Shadow - Commentary by Bruce Boxleitner, Peter Jurasik, Patricia Tallman and Tracy Scoggins-The Fall of Centauri Prime - Commentary by J.

Though things should be quieting down now, more trouble is brewing and threatening galactic peace...Bruce Boxleitner, Mira Furlan, Jerry Doyle, Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.Regarding this season's developments, I must admit that I did not shed a tear seeing Ivanova go and I did find Lochley to be an acceptable replacement, if not an improvement.Nevertheless, there were some unfortunate instances; Vir is just not himself after losing all that weight, and there are times when Lyta Alexander and Lennier evolve into characters that are not as likable as they once were.Furthermore, Byron and his cult of rogue telepaths were ever annoying to the point that the Psi Corps became indeed ""Mother"" and ""Father"" as Al Bester put it so often.Nevertheless, that is all so minor and insignificant compared to:1) The OUTSTANDING plot and subplots,2) The GREAT, overall, character development,3) The last episode, which leaves you breathless and gasping for air, and4) The wonderful feeling of being ADDICTED to the show and wanting more!Babylon 5 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!",5,Babylon 5 Stars!,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,1905,"['Season', 'V', 'Babylon', '5', 'brings', 'screen', 'ongoing', 'adventures', 'parallel', 'stories', 'prominent', 'people', 'major', 'space', 'station', 'neutral', 'space.The', 'year', '2262', 'Babylon', '5', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'Epsilon', '3', 'become', 'temporary', 'home', 'representatives', 'newly', 'established', 'Alliance', 'permanent', 'headquarters', 'are', 'construction', 'planet', 'Minbar', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'quieting', 'down', 'now', 'more', 'trouble', 'brewing', 'threatening', 'galactic', 'peace', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Mira', 'Furlan', 'Jerry', 'Doyle', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', 'Peter', 'Jurasik', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'actors', 'exceptions', 'give', '100', '%', 'really', 'chemistry', 'AMAZING', 'Very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'series', 'doubt', 'guaranteed', 'provide', 'hours', 'entertainment.Regarding', 'season', 'developments', 'must', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'shed', 'tear', 'seeing', 'Ivanova', 'go', 'did', 'find', 'Lochley', 'be', 'acceptable', 'replacement', 'not', 'improvement.Nevertheless', 'were', 'unfortunate', 'instances', 'Vir', 'just', 'not', 'losing', 'weight', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Lyta', 'Alexander', 'Lennier', 'evolve', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'likable', 'once', 'were.Furthermore', 'Byron', 'cult', 'rogue', 'telepaths', 'were', 'ever', 'annoying', 'point', 'Psi', 'Corps', 'became', 'indeed', 'Mother', 'Father', 'Al', 'Bester', 'put', 'so', 'often.Nevertheless', 'so', 'minor', 'insignificant', 'compared', 'to:1', 'OUTSTANDING', 'plot', 'subplots,2', 'GREAT', 'overall', 'character', 'development,3', 'last', 'episode', 'breathless', 'gasping', 'air', 'and4', 'wonderful', 'feeling', 'being', 'ADDICTED', 'show', 'wanting', 'more', 'Babylon', '5', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'already']",N/A

All the important issues were resolved at the end of season four and the only conflicts left are things that are tacked on.&#34;**********SPOILERS**********The Drakh?  They could have been left out entirely and we wouldn't have missed them.  The telepath thing seems like it was written in his sleep.  They want their own homeworld (there are maybe fifty of them- a home WORLD?). In order to force the issue they follow several ambassadors and threaten to reveal their secrets.  The captain says that, despite the fact that the ambassadors are angry enough to spit, there is nothing she can charge them with.  I don't know.  Blackmail, conspiracy, espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to engage in terrorism, theft of intellectual property, stalking, and, I don't know, ACTUALLY BEING FREAKING ROGUE TELEPATHS whom the Corps considers their PROPERTY!  That storyline was stupid.  And at the end when the violent telepaths refused to rejoin the corps and fired on the guards they were quite happy to stand next to Byron and be blown to hell. And Lyta, she wanted to be compensated for everything but whinged and bitched every time someone asked her to do something.  Michael's substance abuse was never a problem after he had his little episode but I thought it was more realistic how they dealt with Garibaldi's alcoholism.My biggest problem with series five is the lack of Ivanova.  I always though she was the best character and the series loses a lot of sparkle without her. I think that she would have made the telepaths' situation more sympathetic although I can't imagine her with Byron.  She probably would have told him to get a haircut and get a job. I would have liked to see that.I continued to watch because I liked the rest of the series, but it could be better.",3,Lost momentum,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1885,"['loved', 'whole', 'Babylon', '5', 'series', 'first', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'seem', 'mostly', 'filler', 'important', 'issues', 'were', 'resolved', 'end', 'season', 'four', 'only', 'conflicts', 'left', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'tacked', '34', 'Drakh', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'telepath', 'thing', 'was', 'written', 'sleep', 'want', 'own', 'homeworld', 'are', 'maybe', 'fifty', 'them-', 'home', 'WORLD', 'order', 'force', 'issue', 'follow', 'several', 'ambassadors', 'threaten', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'captain', 'fact', 'ambassadors', 'are', 'angry', 'enough', 'spit', 'nothing', 'can', 'charge', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Blackmail', 'conspiracy', 'espionage', 'conspiracy', 'commit', 'espionage', 'conspiracy', 'engage', 'terrorism', 'theft', 'intellectual', 'property', 'stalking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ACTUALLY', 'BEING', 'FREAKING', 'ROGUE', 'TELEPATHS', 'whom', 'Corps', 'considers', 'PROPERTY', 'storyline', 'was', 'stupid', 'end', 'when', 'violent', 'telepaths', 'refused', 'rejoin', 'corps', 'fired', 'guards', 'were', 'quite', 'happy', 'stand', 'next', 'Byron', 'be', 'blown', 'hell', 'Lyta', 'wanted', 'be', 'compensated', 'everything', 'whinged', 'bitched', 'time', 'someone', 'asked', 'do', 'something', 'Michael', 'substance', 'abuse', 'was', 'never', 'problem', 'had', 'little', 'episode', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'how', 'dealt', 'Garibaldi', 'alcoholism.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'series', 'five', 'lack', 'Ivanova', 'always', 'was', 'best', 'character', 'series', 'lot', 'sparkle', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'telepaths', 'situation', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Byron', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'get', 'haircut', 'get', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'that.I', 'continued', 'watch', 'liked', 'rest', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'better']",N/A

So maybe you're leaning toward that ""New and Used From..."" button at the top of the page.I'm not telling you not to do it.  I don't regret doing it myself, 'cause I got a pretty good deal, on a per-episode basis.  However, there's not much information to be had on these Asian editions here on Amazon.  So, as a public service, I offer the following information on the Asian editions that Amazon partners/retailers/whatever are peddling.It's an 8-disc set, and the packaging is horrible.  The transfer looks good (as good as the US editions of the first four seasons I have), and the special features are present.  I'm reasonably sure they're the same features found on the US releases, too.  Subtitles, are available in 5 languages.  Near as I can tell, other than the packaging and the number of discs, it's exactly the same as the US edition.  I had been afraid that these wouldn't be more than MPEGs burned onto DVDs, but the content is quite solid.  Good deal.  My only gripe about the content is the fact that the last few episodes are missing their opening and ending credits.  Normally, not a big deal, but... they cut off the ending credits of ""Sleeping in Light!""  Whose idea was that?  Bummer.  But maybe I got a defective disc.I cannot say enough bad things about the way it's packaged.  It's basically a candy box with 8 cellophane sleeves floating loose inside it.  The cover has the right information, with a fair amount of english text, but the print quality is mediocre.  Looks pretty lame on my shelf sandwiched between the US sets of the first four seasons and the movie collection.  The discs themselves look to be actually decently-manufactured; they're not DVD-Rs with stick-on labels.  If you keep them in something more substantial than cellophane, they should be fine for a long time.  Me, I cut up a CaseLogic page and it works perfectly, and I feel a lot better about my minimal investment.The episodes themselves... well, I don't know that I have much to add to the body of reviews already present.  They haven't really declined in quality at all; just a little different feel.  Adding Tracy Scoggins to the cast was pretty bad.  The pacing is funky, due to the almost-cancellation in the fourth season.  Sadly, making excuses (even if it's a very good excuse) doesn't improve the pacing.  Oh, well.  Still worth watching, and I (obviously) think it's worth owning.",4,A note on the Asian editions,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,2538,"[""'re"", 'were', 'disappointed', 'fifth', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'four', 'So', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'leaning', 'New', 'Used', 'button', 'top', 'page.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', 'not', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'doing', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', 'per-episode', 'basis', 'However', 'not', 'much', 'information', 'be', 'had', 'Asian', 'editions', 'here', 'Amazon', 'So', 'public', 'service', 'offer', 'following', 'information', 'Asian', 'editions', 'Amazon', 'partners/retailers/whatever', 'are', 'peddling.It', '8-disc', 'set', 'packaging', 'horrible', 'transfer', 'good', 'as', 'good', 'US', 'editions', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'present', ""'m"", 'reasonably', 'sure', ""'re"", 'same', 'features', 'found', 'US', 'releases', 'too', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', '5', 'languages', 'can', 'tell', 'other', 'packaging', 'number', 'discs', 'exactly', 'same', 'US', 'edition', 'had', 'been', 'afraid', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'MPEGs', 'burned', 'DVDs', 'content', 'quite', 'solid', 'Good', 'deal', 'only', 'gripe', 'content', 'fact', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'missing', 'opening', 'ending', 'credits', 'Normally', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'cut', 'off', 'ending', 'credits', 'Sleeping', 'Light', 'Whose', 'idea', 'was', 'Bummer', 'maybe', 'got', 'defective', 'disc.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'bad', 'things', 'way', 'packaged', 'basically', 'candy', 'box', '8', 'cellophane', 'sleeves', 'floating', 'loose', 'cover', 'right', 'information', 'fair', 'amount', 'english', 'text', 'print', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'Looks', 'pretty', 'shelf', 'sandwiched', 'US', 'sets', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'movie', 'collection', 'discs', 'look', 'be', 'actually', 'decently-manufactured', ""'re"", 'not', 'DVD-Rs', 'stick-on', 'labels', 'keep', 'something', 'more', 'substantial', 'cellophane', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'long', 'time', 'Me', 'cut', 'up', 'CaseLogic', 'page', 'perfectly', 'feel', 'lot', 'better', 'minimal', 'investment.The', 'episodes', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'much', 'add', 'body', 'reviews', 'already', 'present', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'declined', 'quality', 'just', 'little', 'different', 'feel', 'Adding', 'Tracy', 'cast', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'pacing', 'funky', 'due', 'almost-cancellation', 'fourth', 'season', 'Sadly', 'making', 'excuses', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'excuse', ""n't"", 'improve', 'pacing', 'Oh', 'well', 'Still', 'worth', 'watching', 'obviously', 'think', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A
796394,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00019071C,Mark Baker,"[4, 4]","Always intended as a five-year story arc, only a last minute save from TNT brought us this final chapter.As 2262 begins, things are looking up for our characters.  The Alliance has been formed and Sheridan is taking office as its first President.  The station itself is getting a new captain as Elizabeth Lochley steps in for Ivanova who has left to captain a ship.  But things soon take a dark turn.  Sheridan agrees to let a colony of rogue telepaths live on the station.  Their interactions with Lyta Alexander change her profoundly.  Some mysterious force is attacking members of the Alliance.  And Londo and G'Kar try to solve the mystery of the royal court back on Centauri Prime.This season is not as strong as the seasons preceding it.  Because this was a last minute save, all plot lines had been wrapped up in season 4, and it takes a few episodes to get the ball fully rolling forward again.  Personally, I loved Ivanova, so I miss her absence in this season as well.  While watching this set, I realized why else this season isn't a favorite.  It's much darker.  We see Londo's final fate, Garibaldi hits the bottle again, and Lennier makes some poor choices.  My final complaint is the endings left open involving Lennier and Sheridan and Delenn's unborn son.  While this season may be dark, it is still powerful and moving drama that pulls you in and doesn't let you get.  Especially if you've spent the four previous years with the characters.  Fans can't help but watch this to get the next chapter in these character's lives.And this doesn't even touch the final episode.  Filmed as part of season four, it's set 19 years in the future and does include Ivanova.  If that episode doesn't move you, nothing will.If you've bought the previous season sets, you know exactly what to expect here.  The episodes are presented in widescreen with some grain and dust in the picture.  The full surround audio makes an impressive display of the soundtrack.  Extras include the intro to the season on disc one, three commentary tracks, documentaries on the digital effects and fans and other merchandise related to the show and personnel and data files and the season gag reel.  This set features three scenes from ""Sleeping in Light"" that hit the cutting room floor, a first for any of the sets.

At one point it seemed there very well might not have been a fifth season, so the story arc was condensed and nicely presented intact by the end of season four. Personally, I didn't care for much of the Psi Corps issues in season five - but that's just my personal view.  Like B5 fans everywhere, I still get so blurry eyed during ""Sleeping in the Light"" I barely SEE most of that episode. I think more than in other episodes, the music by Christopher Franke complimented the drama in Sleeping in the Light.

There are times during the series when you think...hmmm they should have rethought that, if anything some parts of S5 will seem like a rushed afair, and perhaps given more time and thought it could have been better!!!And to make things worse thanks to a dispute with the management Claudia Christian who played Commander Susan Ivoniva was fired (she does appear on the final ever episode, but that was actually recorded during season 4 shooting) and the replacement was Tracy Scoggins who would play Captain Lochley. This was nothing new for B5 they changed their commander from Commander Sinclair to Sheridan as early as season 2!!!But like Sheridan, Lochley needed time for its audience to warm too!!!!In some ways B5's S5 is similar to S1 a slow build up, but at the end it's brilliant, especially the Centauri-Alliance war episodes, this was like having the old B5 back!!!Also Garabaldi's return to alcolism was a great story arc, and his, but again this happens at the end of the season!!!On a negative, the telepath story, bad move, although this explains the telepath war, I just didn't like Byron the so called good guy martyr and I was actually happy when he died, though again Lyta Alexsandra's move to craziness is kinda good, you kinda saw it happening at the end of season 4!!!!Some notes I made on B5!!!1. Sad/happy ending- The ending is amazing, B5 is blown up, Sheridan dies, no one sure about their future, but I think this really is a great outtake on life, we live, do something good or bad, but then we die, I've never known a Sci-fi or any TV programme to deal with this subject in such as way!!!2. More unrequited love- Lyta and Zack- though Lyta shows no interest to be honest, she sadly goes for Byron, ohhh, why you silly girl why???3. Londo & 'kar- This is most tragic, as Londo seems to be at a kind of redemption with G'Kar his life is taken from him forever by the Drakq keeper, he isn't dead but he'd might as well be!!!4. Vir- I can finally see the making of an emperor, nothing I had ever seen in the previous 4 seasons!!!5. Lennier- Another excellent character- it seems his obsession with being Delenn's special one, and his jelousy of her affections, or I'd say preferance over him could get him killed!!!6. Sheridan & Delenn- It seems that Sheridan has become the job, though he tries to be a family man, the things that happen around him make this nearly impossible, luckly for him though his wife does the sam job!!!7. Garibaldi & Lochley- These two's bickering's was one of the highlights of season 5 in my opinion!!!!8. Hell, you've got the other 4 seasons, season 5 has its moments (especially near the end) and is worth buying just for that I think!!!",3,A dissapointing end to the greatest sci tv series ever!!!!,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,3449,"['brilliant', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'season', '5', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'anti', 'climax', 'well', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'show', 'seemed', 'be', 'heading', 'cancelation', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'decided', 'merge', 'elements', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'together', 'were', 'merged', 'one', 'season', 'explaining', 'seasons', 'rapid', 'pace.This', 'actually', 'made', 'season', '4', 'excellent', 'season', 'personal', 'favourite', 'face', 'pace', 'everything', 'happened', 'was', 'never', 'boring', 'moment', 'last', 'minute', 'WB', 'decided', 'give', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'great', 'news', 'damage', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'was', 'now', 'back', 'drawing', 'board', 'start', 'again', 'whole', 'rethink', 'needed', 'script', 'quick', 'are', 'times', 'series', 'when', 'think', 'hmmm', 'should', 'have', 'rethought', 'anything', 'parts', 'S5', 'will', 'seem', 'rushed', 'afair', 'perhaps', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'thanks', 'dispute', 'management', 'Claudia', 'Christian', 'who', 'played', 'Commander', 'Susan', 'Ivoniva', 'was', 'fired', 'appear', 'final', 'ever', 'episode', 'was', 'actually', 'recorded', 'season', '4', 'shooting', 'replacement', 'was', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Captain', 'Lochley', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'B5', 'changed', 'commander', 'Commander', 'Sinclair', 'Sheridan', 'as', 'early', 'season', '2', 'Sheridan', 'Lochley', 'needed', 'time', 'audience', 'warm', 'too', 'ways', 'B5', 'S5', 'similar', 'S1', 'slow', 'build', 'up', 'end', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'Centauri-Alliance', 'war', 'episodes', 'was', 'having', 'old', 'B5', 'back', 'Also', 'Garabaldi', 'return', 'alcolism', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'arc', 'again', 'end', 'season', 'negative', 'telepath', 'story', 'bad', 'move', 'telepath', 'war', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Byron', 'so', 'called', 'good', 'guy', 'martyr', 'was', 'actually', 'happy', 'when', 'died', 'though', 'again', 'Lyta', 'Alexsandra', 'move', 'craziness', 'kinda', 'good', 'kinda', 'saw', 'happening', 'end', 'season', '4', 'notes', 'made', 'B5', '1', 'Sad/happy', 'ending-', 'ending', 'amazing', 'B5', 'blown', 'up', 'Sheridan', 'one', 'sure', 'future', 'think', 'really', 'great', 'outtake', 'life', 'live', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'bad', 'then', 'die', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'Sci-fi', 'TV', 'programme', 'deal', 'subject', 'such', 'way', '2', 'More', 'unrequited', 'love-', 'Lyta', 'Zack-', 'Lyta', 'interest', 'be', 'honest', 'sadly', 'Byron', 'ohhh', 'why', 'silly', 'girl', 'why', '3', 'Londo', ""'kar-"", 'most', 'tragic', 'Londo', 'be', 'kind', 'redemption', ""G'Kar"", 'life', 'taken', 'forever', 'Drakq', 'keeper', ""n't"", 'dead', ""'d"", 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', '4', 'Vir-', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'making', 'emperor', 'nothing', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'previous', '4', 'seasons', '5', 'Lennier-', 'excellent', 'character-', 'obsession', 'being', 'Delenn', 'special', 'one', 'jelousy', 'affections', ""'d"", 'say', 'preferance', 'could', 'get', 'killed', '6', 'Sheridan', 'Delenn-', 'Sheridan', 'become', 'job', 'be', 'family', 'man', 'things', 'happen', 'make', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'luckly', 'wife', 'sam', 'job', '7', 'Garibaldi', 'Lochley-', 'two', 'bickering', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'season', '5', 'opinion', '8', 'Hell', ""'ve"", 'got', 'other', '4', 'seasons', 'season', '5', 'moments', 'especially', 'end', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'think']",N/A

The main storylines were great and actually most of them preceded from the first season all the way to the final season showing a grand view ability to keep the story concept intact from start to finish.  All the cast were great with Michael O'Hare as Commander Sinclair,  Jerry Doyle as security chief Michael Garibaldi,  Richard Biggs(R.I.P.) as station doctor Stephen Franklin,  Claudia Christian as Commander Susan Ivanova,  Bruce Boxleitner as the Commander John Sheridan of B5 in season 2,  Peter Jurasik as Londo Mollari the Centauri ambassador,  Stephen Furst as Londo's Centauri attache,  Andreas Katsulas(R.I.P.) as Narn ambassador G'Kar,  Mira Fulan as the Minbari ambassador Delen ,  and Bill Mummy as Delen's Minbari attache Lennier.  The series though not as widely known at the time as Star Trek grew throughout the years to become a renown sci-fi classic that actually has surpassed most of the star trek series franchise now.  The last season shows us the growth of the interstellar alliance as well as a dark conspiracy in the shadows that grows from the choices that a few of the characters have made through the series that now comes back to haunt them,  and finally we see the destines of the characters later on down the road as they come together again to pay homage to one of their own in a final farewell.

796407,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00019071C,Robert Moore,"[1, 3]","The final season of BABYLON 5 is an odd one.  Until the end of the season, when the events focus on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime, much of the action is focused on an arc concerning renegade telepaths.  The story never really takes off and never becomes particularly compelling, and it does really result in anything definitive in the way that the conclusions of the Shadow Wars and the Civil War against President Clark and his minions changed the landscape of the show.  I enjoyed Lyta Alexander as a character, but I hated to see her involved in such a relatively dull storyline.For the most part, the first two-thirds of the final season was pretty lackluster, with the one glittering exception being the marvelous standalone episode by guest writer Neil Gaiman, ""Day of the Dead.""  I appreciate the amazing achievement of J. Michael Straczynski in writing virtually ever episode of the show.  Only David E. Kelly can claim to top him in prolificacy of writing (while Straczynski wrote nearly all of B5, Kelly wrote the majority of a half dozen major series, surely an accomplishment that will never be equaled again).  Personally, however, I think B5 lost something in having Straczynski write nearly everything.  I personally believe that B5 lacked a little in diversity and in scope of vision other series like BUFFY or BSG.  And part of the reason is that the main writers on both of those shows -- Joss Whedon and Ron Moore respectively -- took a different approach from Straczynski.  They broke the main storylines and wrote key episodes themselves, but for the most part they served more as executive story editors, hiring a staff of some of the best writers in the business to flesh out their story ideas and then polishing the scripts as they were being prepared for production.  There is no question that B5 is from first to last the product of the imagination of J. Michael Straczynski, but I think it is less rich than if others had been involved in the writing process.  The wonderful Neil Gaiman episode is a brilliant illustration of that.  Also, the show over time showed some of Straczynski's vices as well as virtues.  He is, for instance, pretty weak at comedy, though he does recognize the value of comic sequences.  He also tends to be an incredibly verbose writer.  Given the choice of saying or showing, he'll choose saying every time.  On the other hand, I really enjoyed his ability to visualize storylines over long periods of time.  He is an incredibly patient writer, willing to throw out a detail that won't really get dealt with for a couple of years.  B5 would have been impossible without J. Michael Straczynski.  I just think he would have been a richer show if he had brought in other writers to help out and broaden the texture of the show.As I mentioned, the long telepath arc never really caught fire like the President Clark or Shadows arcs did.  Furthermore, some of the main characters on the show seemed to play a lessened role in the first part of Season 5.  Bruce Boxleitner had considerably less screen time, as did Mira Furlan.  Claudia Christian unfortunately left the show after Season Four and her absence was palpable.  Steven Furst also played a much smaller role, though he contributed more off-screen by directing some episodes.  I liked Tracy Scoggins a lot as Captain Lochley.  I knew her primarily from Season One of THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK, where she played the office sexpot (and got booted off the show by network prudes who felt she was too sexy for it to be the family show they envisioned it should be) and was surprised that she could be convincing in a role that didn't depend on her being sexy.The last third of the season was, however, a thing of beauty.  These episodes were dramatic, exciting, thrilling, and basically everything B5 could be at its best.  Londo ends the series as one of the most tragic characters in the history of TV, as he has finally come to realize what matters and what doesn't, but is put into an utterly impossible position.  The last couple of episodes are devoted to goodbyes.  Various characters leave B5 for the last time as nearly everyone we've known on the show leaves the station for new adventures elsewhere.  The series finale is one of the most emotionally satisfying ends to a series ever.  Knowing that the twenty year extension on his life is about to expire, Sheridan assembles all his friends from B5 for a final goodbye, and then leaves without telling them.  On the way he stops at B5, on the very day it is about to be decommissioned and destroyed.  The last person we see on B5 is a technician who is played by J. Michael Straczynski, who literally turns the lights out.  A few seconds later we see a series of explosions ripple from one end of the station to another, as Babylon 5 the station comes to an end only a few minutes before BABYLON 5 the series.  The series ends on a grand slam home run.  (BTW, the destruction of B5 shows how far the CGI on the show came during its five-year run -- in the first seasons the CGI was clumsy, ugly, and frankly just not very impressive, but by the end of the series new software packages had come out to produce some truly lovely shots.)I've always been honest to anyone I've talked to about this show that I've had a love-hate relationship with B5.  It did so many things right but also so many things wrong.  Dramatically it was slower to get off the ground than any series I know, but in the end delivered some of the better, more compelling storylines that I've seen.  I detested the appalling hair of Londo as well as his improbable accent, but came to like the grand tragedy connected to his character.  In the end, the good definitely outweighed the bad.  I'm also immensely grateful that the network was patient enough with the show to let it develop all its main stories to the very end.  Just think how horrid it would have been had B5 been cancelled after Season 3.  In the end it got to go out on its own terms.  All series should be so lucky.",4,B5 after five years manages to go gently into that good night,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,6034,"['final', 'season', 'BABYLON', '5', 'odd', 'one', 'end', 'season',

JMS must be very proud and happy and same with us the fans that we all brought it this far.  In this season we get to enduldge in more of the Babylon 5 universe and set a closer to the story along with the mysteries of more stories.There are pleanty of what my friends and I call &quot;stand alones&quot;.  Season 4 was connected episode by episode on war battles, some of the political action some fans love more over character stories.  The Stand Alones are epeisodes that alost anyone can watch without needing an overwhelming amount of background knowledge.  They are alost like long short films that tell a story.  Some good examples are Day of The Dead and The Corps Is Mother, The Corps Is Father.  The other beautiful side to this season is the characters in their final stages from the story of the Babylon 5 station.  By the end of season 4, the characters have all gone through hell and some good times together that they each come to another level of who they are.  Sheridan arrives at the wise level Sinclair had come to himself and the same with G'kar.If you plan on getting into Babylon 5 and go through the seasons and have come here, you just may be completely satisfied with the whole of the story.  If you love the characters and their accomplishments in the universe, this season will be a comfortable pleasing treat.  If all that mattered to you were the battles of epic proportions and people shouting out phrases such as &quot;Alright hit them with everything we've got!  Give them hell!&quot; then you 'expected excitement' will not be satisfied.  By the way someone wrote saying that Year 5 was too much of a soap operah probably said that because their were no big wars and has forgotten episodes of the past such as The Parliament of Dreams, Believers, Soul Mates, Gropos, Confessions and Lamentations, Passing Through The Gethsemane, Ship Of Tears, Z'ha'dum, scenes of Sheridan &amp; Delenn, and scenes of Garibaldi &amp; Lise all have romantic elements just to name a few.  Babylon 5 is both about the great battles and wars but also equally important is the people and their lives in those times.I have watched Babylon 5 since season 1 ever since it has aired and I got em all.

796413,A30X7VQZILMFZT,B00019071C,Sertorius,"[11, 12]","I think that I would have rated it at 3 stars, except that the finale, Sleeping in Light is perfect both as an individual episode and as the epilogue for this whole gigantic, epic, series.  The sense at the beginning of this season though was a lack of balance and focus.  The abrupt resurrection of the series from its premature demise in Season 4, threw off much of the series' established dynamic, and like the fledging alliance, left the series on tottering feet.  So they lurched and stumbled about for most of the season, only occasionally hitting the confident stride (okay I am pushing the metaphor a bit much), of previous seasons.In particular the Londo and G'Kar arc continues to delight as they enter into a new stage in their love - hate (okay... mainly hate - hate, with a bit of ambivalence and some lothario bonding)relationship, that results in G'Kar acting as Londo's bodyguard on Centauri Prime.  It is wonderful how these two characters have grown since we were first introduced to them.The telepath subplot that extended threough the first half of the season had some intriguing moments, but was ultimately poorly executed, acted and resolved (with exception of Koenig's Alfred Bester character who is always wonderfully malicious and entertaining).  The same could be said for Garribaldi's decline this season, which offered intriguing possibilities, but really didn't deliver.  Also Captain Lochley, Ivonova's replacement, just was not as entertaining as her prickly, irascible and frankly paranoid predecessor.As a final note the element that I missed most in Season 5 was the relationship between Sheridan and Delenn.  In previous seasons these characters came to life in each others presence, with a palpable chemistry.  I supposed that given the demands the characters were facing within the season a cooling of their passion is to be expected, but made them far less compelling to watch.

It was done on a modest budget, then cancelled and revived before it reached this season (much like the original &#34;Star Trek&#34; series), due to the demand of fans.This is not a series that fades away or tapers off at the end. This final season nicely completes an underlying story that took 5 full seasons to tell. I love the show.The repackaging is due to the original packing being poor. This package of 5 discs is better but very delicate at the same time. I had to return a couple of the seasons and buy them again simply because the inner plastic disc holders had been shattered to one extent or another in the mail.

Babylon 5 is an absolutely amazing epic sci-fi show - I would definitely put it in the top 5 tv shows of all time, and probably at #1. Definitely better than any Star Trek series, and every other sci-fi show I've seen (Battlestar Galactica, etc). It has a five-year arc, though most of the episodes are perfectly understandable & enjoyable on their own. The show deals with a lot of great themes of issue - its primary focus is on the effects & aftermath of war, but it also touches on various issues of morality, spirituality, & the lik. The acting is top-of-the-line. The actors playing G'Kar & Londo are particularly awe-inspiring in their roles. That said, there is no doubt that this season is the weakest of the series (though its still worth it). Part of that is due to the departure to one of the primary characters (contract issues!).As for the this particular release, it is definitely worth it. The features are much the same as the other seasons - a few commentaries which are worth watching, and a documentary or two that are very cool. The quality of the video & audio are as good as they can be (this is before HD). You may want to check the WB store though - I got a much better price there for most of the seasons.For anybody who wants more info about the show or episodes, you should Google the Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 - just be careful, as the episode guide (naturally) contains spoilers. It does have some useful things for someone new to the series though, especially a recommended order in which to watch the various movies along with the show itself.",5,Possibly the best show ever & a good release,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1780,"['First', 'off', 'most', 'people', 'looking', 'are', 'probably', 'already', 'familiar', 'show', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quick', 'review', 'first', 'feel', 'familiar', 'next', 'paragraph', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'actual', 'DVD', 'Babylon', '5', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'epic', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'would', 'definitely', 'put', 'top', '5', 'tv', 'shows', 'time', 'probably', '1', 'Definitely', 'better', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'etc', 'five-year', 'arc', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'show', 'lot', 'great', 'themes', 'issue', 'primary', 'focus', 'effects', 'aftermath', 'war', 'also', 'various', 'issues', 'morality', 'spirituality', 'lik', 'acting', 'top-of-the-line', 'actors', 'playing', ""G'Kar"", 'Londo', 'are', 'particularly', 'awe-inspiring', 'roles', 'said', 'doubt', 'season', 'weakest', 'series', 'still', 'Part', 'due', 'departure', 'one', 'primary', 'characters', 'contract', 'issues', '.As', 'particular', 'release', 'definitely', 'worth', 'features', 'are', 'much', 'same', 'other', 'seasons', 'few', 'commentaries', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'documentary', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'cool', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'HD', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'WB', 'store', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'price', 'there', 'most', 'seasons.For', 'anybody', 'who', 'more', 'info', 'show', 'episodes', 'should', 'Google', 'Lurker', 'Guide', 'Babylon', '5', 'just', 'be', 'careful', 'episode', 'guide', 'naturally', 'spoilers', 'have', 'useful', 'things', 'someone', 'new', 'series', 'especially', 'recommended', 'order', 'watch', 'various', 'movies', 'show']",N/A

But then came season 5 which feels like two different shows: both lousy and great.  SEASON 5 FIRST HALF (LOUSY): Boring.Not interesting. The first half equals season 1 in poor story quality.  Strange.  And yet...  SEASON 5 SECOND HALF (GREAT): The Shadows are gone, but their allys are still here, and the new Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5) steps in to stop the fighting.  The second half equals seasons 2/3/4 in brilliance, character development, and pathos.  A great ending to a great series.And then we have... THE GRAND FINALE TO THE NOVEL FOR TV: Set 20 years in the future, this single episode will bring tears to your eyes, because it shows the death of the hero: President Sheridan.  As series creator J.Michael Straczynski wrote:""The sad truth is that we die.  That is not a happy ending, not a sad ending, simply a fact. The question is what we accomplish during the days and months and years preceding; do we leave the world a better place or a worse place?  If we have left the world around us a better place, as these characters did, then it's a happy ending.  - - - - -  Ultimately, for me, the end of B5 is neither a sad ending nor a happy ending; I'd say it was a graceful ending, a dignified ending, an ending that said individuals can effect profound change, if they are willing to put their own lives and happiness on the line; not happy, not sad, but a testament to the idea that you have used your time here well.""
