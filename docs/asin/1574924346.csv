191182,A12YVS06GZEFZE,1574924346,Barbara Farr Kelley,"[20, 23]","Little Jena Malone was superb in her role as Ellen Foster.  I've seen the movie twice on the television, and will soon be adding this video to my home library.It opens up where she claims she lays in bed and thinks up  ways to kill her daddy.  He is such a mean person, especially when he's  drunk.  Ellen's mother is very sick, but he insists she have a clean house  and supper cooked by the time he gets home from work.  Ellen does the best  she can to help her mother, whom she loves dearly, so her dad won't be so  mad.  But it doesn't matter, the poor woman works so hard that she dies and  leaves Ellen alone with nowhere to go.  Sometimes her dad goes off for days  at a time and leaves the little girl by herself.Ellen's grandmother  doesn't want her because the grandmother hated the daddy and thought Ellen  would be like him.  Same with Ellen's aunt.  And Ellen's girl cousin was a  jealous little girl and a mama's girl.  She did everything she could to get  Ellen in trouble until Ellen finally ran away to find her own  family.This movie ended good, just the way I would have ended it, with  Ellen finding a home.  But don't take my word for it.  Get the video Ellen  Foster and see for yourself what a wonderful movie it is.",5,Jena Malone spectacular!,960076800,"06 4, 2000",2000,1239,"['Little', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'was', 'superb', 'role', 'Ellen', 'Foster', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'television', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'adding', 'video', 'home', 'library.It', 'up', 'where', 'bed', 'up', 'ways', 'kill', 'daddy', 'such', 'mean', 'person', 'especially', 'when', 'drunk', 'Ellen', 'mother', 'very', 'sick', 'have', 'clean', 'house', 'supper', 'cooked', 'time', 'home', 'work', 'Ellen', 'best', 'can', 'help', 'mother', 'whom', 'dearly', 'dad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'mad', ""n't"", 'matter', 'poor', 'woman', 'so', 'hard', 'Ellen', 'alone', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Sometimes', 'dad', 'days', 'time', 'little', 'girl', 'herself.Ellen', 'grandmother', ""n't"", 'want', 'grandmother', 'hated', 'daddy', 'thought', 'Ellen', 'would', 'be', 'Same', 'Ellen', 'aunt', 'Ellen', 'girl', 'cousin', 'was', 'jealous', 'little', 'girl', 'mama', 'girl', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'Ellen', 'trouble', 'Ellen', 'finally', 'ran', 'away', 'find', 'own', 'family.This', 'movie', 'ended', 'good', 'just', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'Ellen', 'finding', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'Get', 'video', 'Ellen', 'Foster', 'see', 'what', 'wonderful', 'movie']",N/A

And the Southern accents were authentic.  They even captured the different accents according to class lines.  They didn't just have northern accents with an occasional drawn out I as is so often done in movies.  But they had the real and authentic accents.  The movie does feature some stereotypes as far as the kind families are the African-American one and the ex-flower child New England one.  But it was realistic in its portrayal of the society Grandmother who rejects her own Grandaughter simply because she resents her drunken white trash father so much.  Even though from the outset it is clear that young Ellen is a responsible and respectable little girl.  Through a series of events, Ellen becomes completely orphaned and after bouncing around with blood family members who don't care for her, she ends up with a foster family that treats her well.

191184,ARZNQMEBQTYBX,1574924346,Electra83,"[3, 3]","I found a copy of this VHS for 50 cents, and so I bought it because I rememembered watching a little of it on TV a long time ago. The book was good, and I remembered that Jena's acting was really good as well.That being said, the movie was obviously a Hallmark one, complete with a musical picture montage in the beginning. I did like the scene in the beginning where Ellen is watching her father with an evil look in her eye. For a second, I thought that there wasn't going to be a voice-over, and that the whole story would be conveyed through action. No such luck. A few seconds later, there was the dreaded voice-over, in all its glory.While the book was about the protagonist's search for a home, it was also about her inner journey. The movie, on the otherhand, only focused on the surface conflicts and never developed Ellen into anything more than an eternally grateful little child who had righteous anger against those who wronged her and could be quite feisty at times. There was no personal growth for her, like there was in the book. The movie ended when her quest for a home was complete. The ending annoyed me because it kind of trivialized the book's ending, but I understood that it would have been hard to make the story more about Starletta in the end when she wasn't in the movie all that much. There's only so much you can fit into any movie.Anyway, I still say this movie is worth watching for Jena Malone's acting. It did have a lot of heart to it. And if it makes people more aware of the plight of abused children, then that's a good thing.",3,Worth Seeing For Jena Malone,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1565,"['found', 'copy', 'VHS', '50', 'cents', 'so', 'bought', 'rememembered', 'watching', 'little', 'TV', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'book', 'was', 'good', 'remembered', 'Jena', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'well.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'Hallmark', 'one', 'complete', 'musical', 'picture', 'montage', 'beginning', 'did', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'Ellen', 'watching', 'father', 'evil', 'look', 'eye', 'second', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'voice-over', 'whole', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'conveyed', 'action', 'such', 'luck', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'was', 'dreaded', 'voice-over', 'glory.While', 'book', 'was', 'protagonist', 'search', 'home', 'was', 'also', 'inner', 'journey', 'movie', 'otherhand', 'only', 'focused', 'surface', 'conflicts', 'never', 'developed', 'Ellen', 'anything', 'more', 'eternally', 'grateful', 'little', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'righteous', 'anger', 'who', 'wronged', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'feisty', 'times', 'was', 'personal', 'growth', 'was', 'book', 'movie', 'ended', 'when', 'quest', 'home', 'was', 'complete', 'ending', 'annoyed', 'kind', 'trivialized', 'book', 'ending', 'understood', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'Starletta', 'end', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'that', 'much', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'fit', 'movie.Anyway', 'still', 'say', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'acting', 'did', 'have', 'lot', 'heart', 'people', 'more', 'aware', 'plight', 'abused', 'children', 'then', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

191187,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,1574924346,Paul Sayles,"[17, 17]","Ellen Foster is the story of a young girl desperately seeking to find a real family.  Her real family is an abusive, drunken father and a mother in chronic ill-health.  Ellen is, by default, the woman of the house and takes care of two parents.  She meets disapproval from her grandmother becuase her mother married against her mother's wishes and grandmother has never forgiven her - at one point she offers the mom the chance to return to the family mansion but without her daughter.  &quot;Trash begats trash&quot; is a powerful statement for a grandmother to make about her granddaughter.Mom eventually dies, dad deteriorates and eventually ends up in jail.  As her family disappears, Ellen is given protection by one of her school teachers.  There the affection from the adults to Ellen is immediate and enduring.  But it doesn't last as Ellen goes to live with her grandmother, on court order.Life with grandmother is brutal, in it's own way.  Ellen is clothed but trreated more as hired help than a granddaughter.  She eats in the dining room with gradnmother on sunday afternoon.  The rest of the time she eats with the servants.  She works for her room and board.  But it doesn't last forever as grandmother has a stroke and ultimately dies, miserable to the end towards Ellen.Then it's off to an aunt with a child of her own and it doesn't get any better.  The friction between the girls is palpable, although Ellen is not the instigator.In the meantime, Ellen has seen a woman with several girls in church.  These children vary in age from late teens to a baby.  They also vary in race.  Ellen is interested in this family and learns they are the &quot;Foster&quot; family.  Ellen even rides her bike past the house but is a little confused when there is another name on the mail box.  Ellen is also exploring other families.  Her best friend in school is a black girl and Ellen gets along well with her family.  Ellen gets a reality check when she asks about her staying with the family permanently.  The father tells her that white people wouldn't like it if a white girl lived with a black family.  Ellen says that it's ok now, we have integration - a truthful and innocent statement.  She is aadvised that it won't work.  Back to the Foster family.A blow-up in the aunt's home with the daughter sees Ellen on the move again.  This time, it is christmas day and she is wearing her best dress and walking to the Foster home.  There she offers the mother her savings so that she can stay there until high school is over.  The whole scene at the kitchen table is tremendously powerful and moving.  Eventually Ellen gets her family but the scars of her earlier &quot;real&quot; family are still there.This is a story that ultimately has a fairly happy ending but the trials of this girl within her own family group is discouraging not to say tragic.  She meets people along the way who see what is happening and want to help, but the legal system gets in the way.  It is a film, while set in the South of a few decades ago, is just as valid to the here and now.  It should be a must see for everyone.  Tears and anger are evenly mixed. It is a memorable film with excellent performances from all the cast.
