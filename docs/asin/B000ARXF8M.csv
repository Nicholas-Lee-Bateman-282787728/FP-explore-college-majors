932375,A30J4XGVPPLYB3,B000ARXF8M,D. James,"[11, 12]","This mid-90's, one-woman sketch comedy was very funny and original. Ullman's characters were a riot and very likeable while the format is a five-minute monologue from each one with no real interaction with any other characters. Ning Nong Nang, the Vietnamese donut-store owner delivers hers at the end of a long day in the kitchen with her bare feet resting in the next days' donut batter! The crude but sincere Aussie stunt-woman is a treat as is the even more vulgar Middle-Eastern taxi driver.",4,You've been away for such a long time now...,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,496,"['mid-90', 'one-woman', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'original', 'Ullman', 'characters', 'were', 'riot', 'very', 'likeable', 'format', 'five-minute', 'monologue', 'one', 'real', 'interaction', 'other', 'characters', 'Ning', 'Nong', 'Nang', 'Vietnamese', 'donut-store', 'owner', 'delivers', 'hers', 'end', 'long', 'day', 'kitchen', 'bare', 'feet', 'resting', 'next', 'days', 'donut', 'batter', 'crude', 'sincere', 'Aussie', 'stunt-woman', 'treat', 'even', 'more', 'vulgar', 'Middle-Eastern', 'taxi', 'driver']",N/A

Her chameleon-like transformations are unbelievable and she is always very, very funny.  This is an excellent set of episodes that you can watch over and over again.  Her best trait though, is the humanity in her comedy.  Ullman creates charaters and worlds that make you laugh and make you cry at the same time.
