49801,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0783222653,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Here Come the Nelsons, 1952 filmThe story starts with a boy on a bicycle delivering newspapers. There is an elm tree in front of the Nelson house. A cowboy outfit for school? ""Oh, yeah."" ""What do you mean?"" A neighbor enters with some children who have toy pistols. Ozzie works in the office of an advertising agency. They have a new product to sell. Ozzie quotes his college song ""on the banks of the old Raritan"". A young lady visits Ozzie, she is the sister of an old college friend. Hillsdale is celebrating its centennial. Two men arrive in town; they are criminals. Festivals attract visitors. An astrologer makes a prediction about Ozzie to Harriet. The boys watch a TV show about espionage (a form of conditioning). The neighbor uses a push mower. A neighborhood couple has split up. [A sign of the times.] There is a conversation between Ozzie and Harriet about a house guest. A problem in communication?Harriet arrives to meet Barbara. [Note the white gloves on women.] Milkmen delivered bottles to homes and took away empties. Would Ozzie ride a wild horse? ""That's unusual."" Charlie Jones shows up (a friend of Al Brown) to ask for a room. [Notice the slimness of adults then.] There is a conversation over dinner. Charlie brought some comic books for the boys. [The ""ten-cent plague"".] Will Ozzie prove something? [Remember when traveling carnivals provided entertainment for small towns?] That foundation manufacturer (corsets and girdles) has arrived in town! Ozzie needs a good idea to sell foundations. Barbara shows her riding skills. [Obviously a double.] A rodeo shows off the working skills of cowboys. Ozzie tries to ride ""Dynamite"", a wild horse, but is pitched off. Is Ozzie in deep trouble now? David and Rickie snoop around. Those two crooks want to steal the money from the carnival.They kidnap Rickie for protection! [Kidnapping then was punishable by the death penalty.] The Deputy Sheriff orders roadblocks. But those men will use a boat to cross the river. Can they catch them by riding horses along an old road? We learn about the true facts about Charlie and who he represents. [Note the ignition switch on that car.] An improvised road block stops the crooks and they are caught. [Believable?] Ozzie is a hero and the publicity saves his job! He also gets a bonus and two weeks vacation too.The value of this average movie comedy is its portrayal of life in the early 1950s (as seen by Hollywood). ""Ozzie and Harriet"" was a popular radio show in the 1940s and a television show in the 1950s. Ozzie Nelson had a band, Harriet Hilliard was his featured singer. A broadcast show meant no touring. It is interesting for what is not there: fears of fallout or nuclear war, a recession, or the other changes from that era. They live in a small town, not a big city or a housing tract. Those tracts were designed to eliminate small businesses and require an automobile for local shopping or travel to work. Motor vehicles led to a dependence on imported oil, and a foreign policy of neo-colonialism. Note the sense of community in this story. There are no political rivalries or tax problems. Public schools were not under attack by big corporations.",3,Small Town Life,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,3177,"['Here', 'Come', 'Nelsons', '1952', 'filmThe', 'story', 'boy', 'bicycle', 'delivering', 'newspapers', 'elm', 'tree', 'front', 'Nelson', 'house', 'cowboy', 'outfit', 'school', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'neighbor', 'enters', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'toy', 'pistols', 'Ozzie', 'office', 'advertising', 'agency', 'have', 'new', 'product', 'sell', 'Ozzie', 'college', 'song', 'banks', 'old', 'Raritan', 'young', 'lady', 'visits', 'Ozzie', 'sister', 'old', 'college', 'friend', 'Hillsdale', 'celebrating', 'centennial', 'Two', 'men', 'arrive', 'town', 'are', 'criminals', 'Festivals', 'attract', 'visitors', 'astrologer', 'prediction', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'boys', 'watch', 'TV', 'show', 'espionage', 'form', 'conditioning', 'neighbor', 'push', 'mower', 'neighborhood', 'couple', 'split', 'up', '[', 'sign', 'times', ']', 'conversation', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'house', 'guest', 'problem', 'communication', 'Harriet', 'meet', 'Barbara', 'Note', 'white', 'gloves', 'women', ']', 'Milkmen', 'delivered', 'bottles', 'homes', 'took', 'away', 'empties', 'Would', 'Ozzie', 'ride', 'wild', 'horse', 'unusual', 'Charlie', 'Jones', 'up', 'friend', 'Al', 'Brown', 'ask', 'room', '[', 'Notice', 'slimness', 'adults', 'then', ']', 'conversation', 'dinner', 'Charlie', 'brought', 'comic', 'books', 'boys', '[', 'ten-cent', 'plague', ']', 'Will', 'Ozzie', 'prove', 'something', '[', 'Remember', 'when', 'traveling', 'carnivals', 'provided', 'entertainment', 'small', 'towns', ']', 'foundation', 'manufacturer', 'corsets', 'girdles', 'arrived', 'town', 'Ozzie', 'good', 'idea', 'sell', 'foundations', 'Barbara', 'riding', 'skills', '[', 'Obviously', 'double', ']', 'rodeo', 'working', 'skills', 'cowboys', 'Ozzie', 'ride', 'Dynamite', 'wild', 'horse', 'pitched', 'off', 'Ozzie', 'deep', 'trouble', 'now', 'David', 'Rickie', 'snoop', 'around', 'two', 'crooks', 'want', 'steal', 'money', 'carnival.They', 'kidnap', 'Rickie', 'protection', '[', 'Kidnapping', 'then', 'was', 'punishable', 'death', 'penalty', ']', 'Deputy', 'Sheriff', 'orders', 'roadblocks', 'men', 'will', 'use', 'boat', 'cross', 'river', 'Can', 'catch', 'riding', 'horses', 'old', 'road', 'learn', 'true', 'facts', 'Charlie', 'who', '[', 'Note', 'ignition', 'switch', 'car', ']', 'improvised', 'road', 'block', 'crooks', 'are', 'caught', '[', 'Believable', ']', 'Ozzie', 'hero', 'publicity', 'job', 'also', 'bonus', 'two', 'weeks', 'vacation', 'value', 'average', 'movie', 'comedy', 'portrayal', 'life', 'early', '1950s', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'was', 'popular', 'radio', 'show', '1940s', 'television', 'show', '1950s', 'Ozzie', 'Nelson', 'had', 'band', 'Harriet', 'Hilliard', 'was', 'featured', 'singer', 'broadcast', 'show', 'meant', 'touring', 'interesting', 'what', 'not', 'there', 'fears', 'fallout', 'nuclear', 'war', 'recession', 'other', 'changes', 'era', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'not', 'big', 'city', 'housing', 'tract', 'tracts', 'were', 'designed', 'eliminate', 'small', 'businesses', 'require', 'automobile', 'local', 'shopping', 'travel', 'work', 'Motor', 'vehicles', 'led', 'dependence', 'imported', 'oil', 'foreign', 'policy', 'neo-colonialism', 'Note', 'sense', 'community', 'story', 'are', 'political', 'rivalries', 'tax', 'problems', 'Public', 'schools', 'were', 'not', 'attack', 'big', 'corporations']",N/A

49803,A10IXPDL5AXRUN,0783222653,"Harry Keaton ""Buddy in Texas""","[2, 2]","This is one of my favorite old movies.  Ozzie Nelson wanted to make the movie to see if people would accept the Nelson's in a TV series.  The four Nelson's had been appearing on their own radio program for a few years and hoped to move to television.  The movie doesn't have a heavy plot, but much more action than their TV series, which ran for a record 14 years.I especially enjoyed seeing David and Ricky, when they were children.  The movie was made in 1952 when Ricky was 12 years old.  I notice in the movie,,,they refer to Ricky as being only 10.  Guess Ozzie thought the television series would last longer if the boys appeared to be two years younger than their actual ages.Sad to realize that the Nelson's are no longer with us.  In fact, only one of the adult actors, who appeared in this movie is living. On February 24, 2012, Barbara Lawrence celebrated her 84th birthday.  I think you will enjoy the movie, if you are old enough to remember the Nelson's TV series.",5,Entertaining 1952 Nelson Movie.,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,978,"['one', 'favorite', 'old', 'movies', 'Ozzie', 'Nelson', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'see', 'people', 'would', 'accept', 'Nelson', 'TV', 'series', 'four', 'Nelson', 'had', 'been', 'appearing', 'own', 'radio', 'program', 'few', 'years', 'hoped', 'move', 'television', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'heavy', 'plot', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'TV', 'series', 'ran', 'record', '14', 'years.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'David', 'Ricky', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1952', 'when', 'Ricky', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'notice', 'movie', 'refer', 'Ricky', 'being', 'only', '10', 'Guess', 'Ozzie', 'thought', 'television', 'series', 'would', 'last', 'longer', 'boys', 'appeared', 'be', 'two', 'years', 'younger', 'actual', 'ages.Sad', 'realize', 'Nelson', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'adult', 'actors', 'who', 'appeared', 'movie', 'living', 'February', '24', '2012', 'Barbara', 'Lawrence', 'celebrated', '84th', 'birthday', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Nelson', 'TV', 'series']",N/A
