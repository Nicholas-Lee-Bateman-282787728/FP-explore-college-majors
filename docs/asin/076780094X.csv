If you're a  fan of Mamet or stark, dialogue-driven films, and your sensibilities aren't  too delicate and easy to upset, you will probably find this film  captivating. Others will find it horridly offensive, although that is  partially the point. Some may just find it dull and meaningless. But who  cares about them? They are dumb. : ) It isn't a feel-good film, certainly  not a film to watch with a date, but if you're patient, level-headed,  imaginative, a fan of the aforementioned Mamet-esque style, and not easily  offended, you will probably love it.

4614,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,076780094X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 15]","Corporate America can be a very cruel place.  The constant attention towards competition, survival of the fittest, and determination towards top performance can easily drive the sanest employee into an early stage of insanity.  Thus, due to these pressures, employees are constantly found in a heated battle for the top spot or the illusive management position.  Many will step directly onto your abdomen to ensure a promotion or pay increase.  Even those friends that have helped you grow or develop over the past few years will think nothing of the steps to topple your next advancement.  This form of random competition in Corporate America is very rare to capture, much less on film, but famed director Neil LaBute did a bit of the impossible.  LaBute took the pressures of competition in Corporate America and camouflaged them using some stereotypes linked to ""men"" in the workplace.  While some will argue that LaBute is doing nothing but exploiting male sexism/egoism and only built a stronger ""glass ceiling"" for women, I saw this completely different.  Much like others, In the Company of Men initially enraged me due to the harsh treatment and depiction of women in the workplace, but then it occurred to me, that isn't what LaBute wants to show.  As I watched this film a second time, I saw the real reason that LaBute created this picture.  He wanted, and successfully accomplished, to show that you have to be smart both in your personal and business life if you want to succeed in this demolishing corporate world.LaBute's approach to this ingenious subject reminded me of how Soderbergh used ""sex"" to debunk his story in sex, lies, and videotape.  From the opening scene, we think we know what this movie is going to be about.  We think we understand that this is just going to be another ""dark"" comedy about how cruel the corporate world can be to women, but wildly LaBute (like Soderbergh) will pull the hypothetical wool over your eyes if you are not careful.  Sure, he opens up huge controversial issues like the subjugation of women, the power of ""men"" in the workplace, and how one nearly looses their soul to push further ahead, but when LaBute finally delivers that final moment to us, we forget these issues and see the truth behind this film.  This is not a movie about sexism (while it is used quite often to hide the real truth), but instead the power of manipulation, the power of emotion, and the ability to use your friends to reach the top.  This is the ultimate betrayal film.  After watching this film, I read some reviews that discussed how viewers hated LaBute for doing what he did to Christine, and that made me a bit angry.  I too was disturbed by Eckhart's performance, but by being upset about what happened to Christine, you miss the truth behind this film.  When I finished watching this movie, I was more upset with LaBute for what he did to Howard (Matt Malloy) than with Christine.How did this dramatic change occur?  How could a viewer feel more sympathy for Howard than with the weeping Christine?  LaBute has this amazing ability to cast believable actors that mold themselves well within their roles.  Matt Malloy plays the perfect ying to Aaron Eckhart's yang.  The two could not be closer to polar opposites, but the chemistry between them keeps us connected and glued to the screen.  Their relationship reminded me of every Hollywood movie where the popular jock is great friends with the insecure geek.  Malloy and Eckhart's relationship reminded me of the frat boy who happens to be a friend with the computer nerd.  There is no initial understanding of why these two are friends or why they have anything in common.  Sure, they went to the same college, but does that constitute life-long friendship?  I believe from the beginning of this film, and possibly further into the pre-text, Eckhart has Malloy on a plan.  We don't see the plan initially, but when it comes into light at the end, it hits us deep within our gut, giving us more pain than the Christine incident.  How did LaBute set this up so well?  Again, I state, Malloy and Eckhart.  These two were methodical, malicious, and very close to perfection with their characters.  We believed them.  They sold us on themselves, which needed to happen for LaBute to make his point.  Stacy Edwards is decent, but honestly LaBute could have had anyone in that role and we would have bought it.  Why?  Again, Malloy and Eckhart.LaBute did not just give us impassioned characters with devoted actors, but he also gave us an amazing story.  He used the power of language to give us our opening, plot, downfall, climax, and twisty ending.  It is not often in Hollywood that you see this technique used.  It takes a combination of both a great (and engrossing) story with sublime characters.  We already know that we had the characters, but what about the story made it worth watching over and over and over again.  Having seen American Psycho several times, I felt like LaBute had read Bret Easton Ellis' novel over and over.  He embodied the spirit and insanity of corporate America nearly as well as American Psycho director Mary Harron did.  The pacing was tight, the six weeks seemed to fly by because we were glued to the results.  LaBute kept us glued to the screen by shocking us with sexist remarks, macho thinking, and corporate taboos.  Then, when he thought that we were not paying attention, he gave us the ending of a lifetime.  The writing for this film was quick, powerful, and thought provoking, which nearly symbolizes this film.  LaBute should have won an Oscar for this powerful and intelligent piece of cinema.Overall, I thought this film was vile, belittling, and grotesquely unsettling ... which is why I cannot wait to add it to my collection.  LaBute proves to us once again why he is a master behind the camera as well as a commander with his pen.  Aaron Eckhart should have been awarded an Oscar for his role, because I do not believe anyone could have played it better.  The chemistry between the characters felt fresh and original.  The story kept our minds moving quickly and desiring more.  I wanted to witness more opening events before the film what happened to these characters afterwards.  This is not your typical ""dark"" comedy, but instead something completely off on its own.  I read a comment that stated that Eckhart's Chad is the epitome of a villain, and I could not agree more.  Neil LaBute has given us his first in a very long line of challenging, yet beautiful, cinema.Grade:  ***** out of *****",5,"Life is for the taking, is it not?",1142726400,"03 19,

4615,A2YM9ILTAX0782,076780094X,"Birt Acres ""Cinemaniac""","[2, 2]","SPOILERS:  ""In the Company of Men"" (1997) is an unflinching depiction of masculinity at its worst, featuring one of the evilest male villains of all time--all the more amazing because he never shoots a gun, throws a punch, or even yells.  Neil LaBute, the director and writer, called the movie ""a simple story,"" explaining, ""Boy meets girl, boys crush girl, boys giggle.""  Two businessmen, in their early thirties and both recently jilted, find themselves angry at womankind.  They travel on a seven-week assignment to a new town and collude to avenge their wounded hearts.  They decide to find a woman, somewhat of a wallflower, and woo her.  When she becomes emotionally involved, they will then yank the rug out from under her and let her crash to earth.  From then on, no matter how badly mistreated they are by women, they will know that they have this one ""success"" to look back on and laugh.  They find a beautiful but deaf secretary in the new office.  Both men begin to date her.  Not used to so much attention, she is swept away.  One of the men is fairly decent, Howard, and he begins to actually fall in love with her.  The other, Chad, is heartless, and she falls for him.  Howard, angry at her affection for Chad, tells her of their collusion.  She confronts Chad and he confesses while laughing in her face.  Explains on reviewer, ""LaBute's characters are so lost to themselves, so separated from their souls, that they can't feel anything; they hurt people in order to feel something.""The film is intensely brutal for the male viewer precisely because 1) we know men likes this or 2) we are men like this.  In fact, I would venture to say, although most men are not like Chad, we have at times expressed emotions just as base and mean as his.  Truly the power of this film lies in Neil LaBute's powerfully realistic dialogue.  The film does not hold back, and some of the dialogue, in which the two men laugh about the woman's ""retard speech,"" is as discomfiting as any scene of violence in ""A Clockwork Orange.""  LaBute proves that dialogue can be as powerful as any other aspect of the cinema, perhaps even more so.  This is a film you must see--and afterwards pray for forgiveness for your mistreatment of women.  LaBute, thankfully, leaves a small out in his film for men.  Chad appears too have homosexual inclinations.  In one instance, he uses his power in the office to get a man to show him his genitals (the only scene which I felt was unrealistic) and in another scene he glances down at a man using the urinal.  The insinuation, I think, is that the film is not so much about the evils of men (such would be an unfair exaggeration) but about the evils of powerful men.",4,Tough to Watch,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,2696,"['SPOILERS', 'Company', 'Men', '1997', 'unflinching', 'depiction', 'masculinity', 'worst', 'featuring', 'one', 'evilest', 'male', 'villains', 'time', 'more', 'amazing', 'never', 'shoots', 'gun', 'punch', 'even', 'yells', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'director', 'writer', 'called', 'movie', 'simple', 'story', 'explaining', 'Boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'crush', 'girl', 'giggle', 'Two', 'businessmen', 'early', 'thirties', 'recently', 'jilted', 'find', 'angry', 'womankind', 'travel', 'seven-week', 'assignment', 'new', 'town', 'collude', 'avenge', 'wounded', 'hearts', 'decide', 'find', 'woman', 'somewhat', 'wallflower', 'woo', 'When', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'will', 'then', 'yank', 'rug', 'let', 'crash', 'earth', 'then', 'matter', 'how', 'badly', 'mistreated', 'are', 'women', 'will', 'know', 'have', 'one', 'success', 'look', 'back', 'laugh', 'find', 'beautiful', 'deaf', 'secretary', 'new', 'office', 'men', 'begin', 'date', 'Not', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'swept', 'away', 'One', 'men', 'fairly', 'decent', 'Howard', 'actually', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'Chad', 'heartless', 'Howard', 'angry', 'affection', 'Chad', 'collusion', 'Chad', 'laughing', 'face', 'Explains', 'reviewer', 'LaBute', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'lost', 'so', 'separated', 'souls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'hurt', 'people', 'order', 'feel', 'something', 'film', 'intensely', 'brutal', 'male', 'viewer', 'precisely', '1', 'know', 'men', '2', 'are', 'men', 'fact', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'most', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'Chad', 'have', 'times', 'expressed', 'emotions', 'just', 'base', 'mean', 'Truly', 'power', 'film', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'powerfully', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'film', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'dialogue', 'two', 'men', 'woman', 'retard', 'speech', 'as', 'discomfiting', 'scene', 'violence', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'LaBute', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'powerful', 'other', 'aspect', 'cinema', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'afterwards', 'pray', 'forgiveness', 'mistreatment', 'women', 'LaBute', 'thankfully', 'small', 'out', 'film', 'men', 'Chad', 'too', 'have', 'homosexual', 'inclinations', 'one', 'instance', 'power', 'office', 'get', 'man', 'show', 'genitals', 'only', 'scene', 'felt', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'scene', 'down', 'man', 'using', 'urinal', 'insinuation', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'evils', 'men', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'exaggeration', 'evils', 'powerful', 'men']",N/A
4616,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,076780094X,Carol Toscano,"[16, 18]","This film is so frightening because one can imagine these things actually happening.  I needed to watch the film twice before I got it all.  Basically, two corporate men decide to date a wallflower for six weeks and then dump her, breaking her heart in the most cruel way, essentially getting revenge on all of womankind for past wrongs.  In this case, the wallflower is a deaf girl who is a typist in a very bleak corporate office the two men are sent to work in for six weeks.  This film is so cleverly written that there were moments (the first time I watched it) when I felt that Chad (the handsome one) was actually falling for this poor girl but at the end, and then on the second viewing, I realized that he was just planting the idea that he might really have feelings for this girl in his co-worker's mind in order to manipulate him (that would be Howard - the less handsome one).  Making Howard believe that he might really have feelings for this deaf woman only made her more desirable (to Howard) - male competition in play.  I also felt that he was trying to undermine Howard's authority as his boss because of his jealousy - needing to sabotage that aspect as well.  Though some elements of the film are cliche (the girl falls for the good-looking one of course, then the nerdy one has a breakdown), these things, again, actually happen in real life (I know a lot of women who would choose a macho handsome guy over a sensitive nerdy guy just on looks alone - the same as a man picking a beautiful woman with a so-so personality over an average-looking woman who is really smart).  Though most viewers feel really bad for this woman, she actually played her own game by dating both men simultaneously even after telling Chad that she loved him.  She reasons that after not dating for a long time, she liked the attention - it made her feel attractive again.  Some people feel bad for Howard but really, he wasn't in love with this girl either though he may have thought so - it was just beating Chad (and being on the rebound) that drove his competitive side to move forward so aggressively.  I mean, after dating her for a few weeks, he gives her a used engagement ring and then freaks out telling her that it was all a game when she rejects him.  If he really loved and wanted her, he would have tried to protect her from the truth (instead, he uses it as a weapon against her almost as if he is punishing her for the way his former fiance treated him.  It seemed to me that he was subconsciouly getting revenge on his former fiance through this woman - that she had in essence become the fiance that rejected him and so the game actually did what it set out to do).  Theories like ""what goes around comes around"" don't apply here and the most disturbing thing about this movie is the reality that what goes around doesn't always come around especially in Chad's case - that he lies, plots, schemes and destroys with no repercussions.  In the end, he goes home to his beautiful apartment, his beautiful girlfriend, his great job and everything is as it ever was.  And sadly, that's real life.",4,Frightening and disturbing,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,3108,"['film', 'so', 'frightening', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'things', 'actually', 'happening', 'needed', 'watch', 'film', 'twice', 'got', 'Basically', 'two', 'corporate', 'men', 'decide', 'date', 'wallflower', 'six', 'weeks', 'then', 'dump', 'breaking', 'heart', 'most', 'cruel', 'way', 'essentially', 'getting', 'revenge', 'womankind', 'past', 'wrongs', 'case', 'wallflower', 'deaf', 'girl', 'who', 'typist', 'very', 'bleak', 'corporate', 'office', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'sent', 'work', 'six', 'weeks', 'film', 'so', 'cleverly', 'written', 'were', 'moments', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'when', 'felt', 'Chad', 'handsome', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'falling', 'poor', 'girl', 'end', 'then', 'second', 'viewing', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'planting', 'idea', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'feelings', 'girl', 'co-worker', 'mind', 'order', 'manipulate', 'would', 'be', 'Howard', 'less', 'handsome', 'one', 'Making', 'Howard', 'believe', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'feelings', 'deaf', 'woman', 'only', 'made', 'more', 'desirable', 'Howard', 'male', 'competition', 'play', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'undermine', 'Howard', 'authority', 'boss', 'jealousy', 'needing', 'sabotage', 'aspect', 'as', 'well', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'cliche', 'girl', 'good-looking', 'one', 'course', 'then', 'nerdy', 'one', 'breakdown', 'things', 'again', 'actually', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'know', 'lot', 'women', 'who', 'would', 'choose', 'macho', 'handsome', 'guy', 'sensitive', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'just', 'looks', 'alone', 'same', 'man', 'picking', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'so-so', 'personality', 'average-looking', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'smart', 'most', 'viewers', 'feel', 'really', 'bad', 'woman', 'actually', 'played', 'own', 'game', 'dating', 'men', 'simultaneously', 'even', 'telling', 'Chad', 'loved', 'reasons', 'not', 'dating', 'long', 'time', 'liked', 'attention', 'made', 'feel', 'attractive', 'again', 'people', 'feel', 'bad', 'Howard', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'girl', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'so', 'was', 'just', 'beating', 'Chad', 'being', 'rebound', 'drove', 'competitive', 'side', 'move', 'forward', 'so', 'aggressively', 'mean', 'dating', 'few', 'weeks', 'used', 'engagement', 'ring', 'then', 'out', 'telling', 'was', 'game', 'when', 'really', 'loved', 'wanted', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'protect', 'truth', 'instead', 'weapon', 'almost', 'punishing', 'way', 'former', 'fiance', 'treated', 'seemed', 'was', 'subconsciouly', 'getting', 'revenge', 'former', 'fiance', 'woman', 'had', 'essence', 'become', 'fiance', 'rejected', 'so', 'game', 'actually', 'did', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'Theories', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'here', 'most', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'movie', 'reality', 'what', 'around', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'around', 'especially', 'Chad', 'case', 'plots', 'schemes', 'destroys', 'repercussions', 'end', 'home', 'beautiful', 'apartment', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'great', 'job', 'everything', 'ever', 'was', 'sadly', 'real', 'life']",N/A

In the Company of Men tells the story of a few such gentlemen, and does so in what is supposed to be a realistic way, but I have a hard time believing that the characters here are acting realistically.A pair of men go on a six-week business stint out of town, working on an anonymous project for an anonymous large company. Chad (Aaron Eckhart) encourages Howard (Matt Malloy) to play a ""game"" with him while they are on this business trip. He proposes that they find a vulnerable girl and each begin dating her and treating her kindly, then at the end of the six weeks, pull the rug out from underneath her and bask in her agony. The purpose here being that in the future, when either of the two of them feels mistreated by a woman, they can look back on this and tell themselves at least it's not as bad as that. Howard isn't overly enthusiastic about the idea, but goes along with anyway.The pawn ends up being a secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards), who also happens to be deaf. Chad takes her out first, then Howard does the same. Things start to get complicated when Christine starts to develop feelings for Chad, but Howard starts to develop true feelings for Christine, and isn't sure he wants to be involved in this game anymore. Meanwhile, everything is going according to plan for Chad, and he is loving it.I think one of the points that this movie is trying to convey is that the most ruthless, heartless, sadistic individuals are able to succeed in business because they don't care who they step over while they're on their way up. Chad certainly fits that bill; he is absolutely despicable, almost to the point where he is a caricature, and it ultimately makes his character difficult to believe. There is virtually no way to sympathize with his character and that's because he's one-dimensional: he's a jerk and we should loathe him, and we do.The whole game just doesn't seem like it would ever happen. Why would a man like Howard go along with it? He seems much too smart and compassionate to agree to this heartless plan. When watching the film, though, I put aside my disbelief of the premise and found it to be pretty good. I liked the way director Neil LaBute allowed for long takes and really let the actors do their thing, and they did a very good job, especially Matt Malloy.

He bonds with men by appealing to their prejudices.  He tells sexist jokes: ""What's the difference between a golf ball and a G-spot?"" Answer: ""I can spend twenty minutes looking for a golf ball.""  He likes to get close to people to use and exploit them.  But he goes further than that.  He likes to hurt them.  Why?  ""Because I can,"" he says.In other words, Chad's a sociopath who specializes in humiliating people.  He gets a black worker to expose himself.  He says he needs to see if he really has the stuff to be recommended for a promotion.  He tells him, the guy who wins is the guy who has ""the nastiest sack of venom.""  In case the guy doesn't know he's been humiliated, as he pulls up his pants, Chad tells him to get him a cup of coffee, black.Christine (Stacy Edwards) is a pretty girl in her twenties, a lightning fast typist in the secretarial pool.

Chad spots her and decides she is perfect for this little game of broken hearts he wants to play with Howard (Matt Malloy), his slightly nerdy friend, co-worker and sometime boss.

With an obviously limited budget, this first-time feature from writer/director Neil LaBute really turns its characters inside out with a visceral potency that could not have been attempted by the major studios. The plot focuses on two middle management types, Chad and Howard, who are on a six-week project in the company's Midwest branch office. On the surface, Chad is a smooth-talking braggadocio who after breaking up with his girlfriend, claims to be fed up with the neediness of women. But underneath is a dark sociopath who is unfathomably cruel to anyone in his path. Watch the scene where he makes a black co-worker pull down his pants to prove he has the ""balls"" for a higher profile assignment.Having just been dumped by his fianc&eacute;e, Howard seems like the more benign of the two and looks toward the cynical Chad for guidance at the office and with women. However, his insecurities reveal an innately pathetic figure who wants to be able to exert power over someone defenseless. Realizing their mutual bitterness toward women, the two decide to make a disreputable pact to romance the same woman during their business trip only to dump her at the end. Enter Christine, a pretty office secretary who happens to be deaf. You can figure out the rest, but the way LaBute relentlessly reveals the characters' weaknesses, including Christine's, is piercingly honest to the point of painful. Even the twist at the end is well-justified, as LaBute's perceptive script makes the situation hauntingly cathartic.In his first important role, Aaron Eckhardt, with his square jaw and cocksure manner, is superb as Chad, and it took him several years (probably until his heart-of-gold Hell's Angel in ""Erin Brockovich"") to recover from this impermeable persona. In fact, he tweaks it as the unapologetic tobacco lobbyist in this year's ""Thank You for Smoking"". As Howard, Matt Malloy certainly makes a most convincing dweeb, while Stacy Edwards (who is not deaf) elicits the right emotions with Christine, obviously the only sympathetic role in the movie. The DVD has two commentary tracks - the first with LaBute, Eckhardt and the crew, and the second with the three principals and again with Eckhardt. Both are quite insightful with the latter particularly entertaining for the contrast between the actors and the characters they play.

Furious and frightened by the idea that there are really people in the world like Chad, the main character embodied perfectly by actor Aaron Eckhart. Chad is the consummate pretender. He concocts devious schemes against his friend, colleague, and immediate superior, Howard. Howard blindly trusts Chad while Chad entreats Howard to join him in a game of ruining someone's life. Chad confesses to Howard that his wife has left him, and Howard commiserates that his fianc&eacute;e recently left him as well. In their women-hating phase, Chad suggests that they should, together, begin pursuing the most wallflowerish, unpopular woman they can find (they are going to a city they do not live in for a business trip) and both of them eagerly pursue her. Eventually they meet a deaf office typist, played well by Stacy Edwards, and they both pursue her fervently. Howard is rather nerdish and is uncomfortable with the whole arrangement. Eventually Howard truly falls in love with her. She falls in love with Chad.

4628,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,076780094X,Genevieve Hayes,"[3, 3]","Two alpha-male business men on a business trip, Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy), set out to destroy a deaf woman, Christine (Stacy Edwards), by getting her to fall in love with them and then dumping her, in order to get revenge on women in general.""In the Company of Men"" is possibly one of the most mean-spirited and misanthropic movies that I have ever seen (I say misanthropic rather than misogynistic, since, although many of the characters in the film are misogynists, the one major female character in this film, Christine, is presented as a nice person who does not deserve to be tormented by the likes of Chad, while the male characters are presented as being complete jerks). As a result, it is not a film to be enjoyed (although I did laugh, in spite of myself, at a number of places throughout the film), but it is a fascinating and totally believable study of the cruelty that human beings are capable of. It is made all the more effective and frightening by the fact that this cruelty is executed in a bloodless (and legal) manner. If Chad and Howard were torturing people in a manner like the killer in the ""Saw"" movies, I could tell myself that none of this is real and that most people aren't capable of such actions, but when the weapons of torture are words rather than knives, the idea of people like this existing in the real world becomes all the more plausible. Worse still is the fact that, even while ""torturing"" Christine, Chad still manages to come across as being charming and attractive, which is how he can succeed in the first place.This movie was the film debut of playwright Neil LaBute. Although the script of this film was written as an original screenplay, LaBute's stage background is clearly evident in it, and the film has a very stagy feel to it. This is the main thing I didn't like about this movie. On the other hand, Aaron Eckhart, in his first cinematic starring role, is absolutely brilliant as a conscienceless sociopath. It is Eckhart who makes this film, and from this movie, it is easy to see why he went on to bigger and better things. See this film along with ""Thank You For Smoking"" and marvel at the brilliance of Eckhart.",4,One of the Most Mean-Spirited and Misanthropic Movies Ever Made,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,2189,"['Two', 'alpha-male', 'business', 'men', 'business', 'trip', 'Chad', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Howard', 'Matt', 'Malloy', 'set', 'out', 'destroy', 'deaf', 'woman', 'Christine', 'Stacy', 'Edwards', 'getting', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'dumping', 'order', 'get', 'revenge', 'women', 'general', 'Company', 'Men', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'mean-spirited', 'misanthropic', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'say', 'misanthropic', 'rather', 'misogynistic', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'misogynists', 'one', 'major', 'female', 'character', 'film', 'Christine', 'presented', 'nice', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'tormented', 'likes', 'Chad', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'being', 'complete', 'jerks', 'result', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'did', 'laugh', 'spite', 'number', 'places', 'film', 'fascinating', 'totally', 'believable', 'study', 'cruelty', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'capable', 'made', 'more', 'effective', 'frightening', 'fact', 'cruelty', 'executed', 'bloodless', 'legal', 'manner', 'Chad', 'Howard', 'were', 'torturing', 'people', 'manner', 'killer', 'Saw', 'movies', 'could', 'tell', 'none', 'real', 'most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'capable', 'such', 'actions', 'when', 'weapons', 'torture', 'are', 'words', 'rather', 'knives', 'idea', 'people', 'existing', 'real', 'world', 'more', 'plausible', 'Worse', 'still', 'fact', 'even', 'torturing', 'Christine', 'Chad', 'still', 'come', 'being', 'charming', 'attractive', 'how', 'can', 'succeed', 'first', 'place.This', 'movie', 'was', 'film', 'debut', 'playwright', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'script', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'original', 'screenplay', 'LaBute', 'stage', 'background', 'clearly', 'evident', 'film', 'very', 'stagy', 'feel', 'main', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'first', 'cinematic', 'starring', 'role', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'conscienceless', 'sociopath', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'film', 'movie', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'went', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'See', 'film', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'marvel', 'brilliance', 'Eckhart']",N/A

It seems LaBute just wanted to show how nasty he could be.  Believe me, I am not an overly sensitive, politically correct leftie or anything.  I am a deep admirer of Catherine Breillat and Ingmar Bergman, and their films are not very happy.  I do not accept the self indulgence which is on display here.  This film reminds me of another piece of garbage film called Very Bad Things.  Some critics and moviegoers liked that film because they thought it was just a very dark comedy.  It wasn't.  It was a sadistic, smarmy film that reveled in its cruelty without any intelligence behind it.  This film really doesn't feel misogynistic to me.  The humiliation of the woman isn't really why I dislike the film so much.  It's the attitude towards the audience.  It just feels like LaBute just killed something, and is forcing you to watch it over and over again, and he keeps saying ""that's the way the world is baby!  Hahahaha!"".  There's a ridiculous scene (which Roger Ebert thought was brilliant for some demented reason) where Aaron Eckhart forces a black employee to drop his pants.  There's no point to the scene, and it doesn't even fit in with the rest of the film, just in terms of the narrative.  A lot of people compared this film to a Kubrick film, and it is deeply insulting to Kubrick (and to fans of his, of which I include myself).  Kubrick's films were injected with an artistry and intelligence that this film sorely lacks.  LaBute's next film, Your Friends and Neighbors, was a bit better, but that too had a ""shocking"" scene in which Jason Patric talked about gleefully raping a man.

Using his persuasive skills to get his boss, Howard (Matt Malloy) to go along in this exercise of cruelty, Chad plays the game to the max.  Along the way the audience gets the feel for the impersonable, alien corporate environment and good old boy atmosphere so recognizable in the U.S.  Chad is portrayed instinctively by young actor Aaron Eckhart, who has traveled with LaBute through this and all subsequent films, sometimes in minor character roles.  Eckhart and LaBute obviously have their pacing and teamwork together - Eckhart portrays Chad effortlessly!LaBute should be congratulated for not allowing &quot;the happy ending&quot;, instead twisting his conclusion to find yet another villainous side of Chad.The DVD is dark, with few special features, and since almost all of the film takes place indoors (an early LaBute signature), the darkness of the tale is heightened by the appearance of the film.  Striking out as a writer/director with a &quot;different voice&quot; (ala John Sayles) LaBute made his mark with &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; - and it is a fascinating study for serious film watchers.",4,Not for everyone...,1048550400,"03 25, 2003",2003,1718,"['reason', 'quot', 'Company', 'Men', 'quot', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'film', 'first', 'writer-director', 'Neil', 'Labute', 'won', 'award', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'reason', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'rather', 'LaBute', 'what', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'willing', 'achieve', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'art', 'not', 'everybody', 'supposed', 'understand', 'like', 'what', 'are', 'saying.LaBute', 'captures', 'self-absorption', 'resulting', 'cruelty', 'EVERY', 'alpha', 'male', 'raised', 'fraternal', 'corporate', 'environment', 'ever', 'subscribed', 'roled', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'Chad', 'Using', 'persuasive', 'skills', 'get', 'boss', 'Howard', 'Matt', 'Malloy', 'go', 'along', 'exercise', 'cruelty', 'Chad', 'game', 'max', 'way', 'audience', 'feel', 'impersonable', 'alien', 'corporate', 'environment', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'recognizable', 'U.S.', 'Chad', 'portrayed', 'instinctively', 'young', 'actor', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'traveled', 'LaBute', 'subsequent', 'films', 'sometimes', 'minor', 'character', 'roles', 'Eckhart', 'LaBute', 'obviously', 'have', 'pacing', 'teamwork', 'together', 'Eckhart', 'Chad', 'effortlessly', 'LaBute', 'should', 'be', 'congratulated', 'not', 'allowing', 'quot', 'happy', 'ending', 'quot', 'instead', 'twisting', 'conclusion', 'find', 'yet', 'villainous', 'side', 'Chad.The', 'DVD', 'dark', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'almost', 'film', 'place', 'indoors', 'early', 'LaBute', 'signature', 'darkness', 'tale', 'heightened', 'appearance', 'film', 'Striking', 'out', 'writer/director', 'quot', 'different', 'voice', 'quot', 'John', 'Sayles', 'LaBute', 'made', 'mark', 'quot', 'Company', 'Men', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'study', 'serious', 'film', 'watchers']",N/A
4638,A17UL6RVPNK5IS,076780094X,Luke D Jasenosky,"[10, 12]","In the Company of Men is a strikingly original and intelligent film.  As others have commented, the set design is thin, and the cinematography stark and, at times, a little bland, but these factors only provide a less  obtrusive background for the real forces present on screen - dazzling  peformances and a biting, at times hilarious, and at times heartbreaking,  script.  Eckhart's performance is sensational. He portrays a truly evil man  of a frightening variety - he is not an idealogue, nor does he even care  about committing cruel acts in the presence of an audience.  He inflicts  cruelty for very personal satisfaction. In fact, Eckhart is so good that  you begin to question the real motives behind is behavior, and this  ambiguity makes his final act with his victim even more troubling.  Stacy  Edwards is excellent as the victim, and, unlike a reviewer below, I found  her both beautiful and strong.  She is treated abhorrently, and the scene  where she realizes the truth is searing, but she is a surivor, and a  redemptive figure.  Her treatment by Eckhart is all the more foreign  because she is a wonderful, attractive person whose disability, which  induces the practical joke in the first place, seems irrelevant, and even a  source of unique strength by the film's end.  Matt Malloy does well as the  dupe - a man who has a few shreds of decency left under a coat of  acceptance-seeking-at-any-cost fibers.  He loses something that he can  never recover in exchange for a few scraps of false manhood.  The torture  he feels by the film's end is achingly immediate, yet it is impossible to  sympathize with or even pity him. This movie makes you think, and, if you  watch it with others, debate.  It is multi-layered, and, although not a  thriller in the traditional sense, has more than enough emotional twists.

For those of you guys who are interested in watching/buying it, may I suggest that you do not watch it on a romantic &quot;movie night out.&quot;  This show will evaporate any romantic mood you may have.  Trust me on this one.  It can turn your girlfriend into a misandrist.  For the ladies, if you want to watch it, please prepare yourself and keep an open mind...As most reviewers already said, this is one heck of a disturbing movie.  The premise is that 2 men (Chad and Howard) are out to &quot;play&quot; a woman, make her fall in love, and then rip her heart out, figuratively speaking.  Since it isn't a Hollywood stylized movie, don't expect a happy and cozy ending.  Some of the scenes are quite provocative yet realistic.  I can see it happening in ordinary day-to-day living.  You're more likely to see a scene in this movie than a scene in than cutesy &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding.&quot;  Because this is a dark comedy, most people will not be comfortable with it.  It isn't something we expect to see, since it conflicts a lot with our own moral ethics.The technicalities of the movie is quite poor, and I'm going to have to deduct 1 star for that.  Video and sound quality is really awful, poorer than the average Indie movie.  There are very few sound effects, hardly any musical, and the voice recordings have static.  Video quality is grainy and low in saturation, it really look like playing from a VCR (even though I'm watching the DVD version).Here's more extraneous info: my take on the moral of this story is that if you are a guy, don't be a jerk like Chad.  But also, don't be a wishy-washy weakling like Howard; stand your ground, and don't get pushed around.  Both characters have their strengths and weakness.  But I think both end up being the losers, even though the movie victimizes Howard more since he is the &quot;nice guy.&quot;  I thought Howard would have more of a backbone, but I am disappointed that in the end, he never really stood up for himself.",4,Meat and gristle and hatred,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2118,"['usually', 'do', 'not', 'review', 'movies', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'profound', 'left', 'pondering', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'watching/buying', 'may', 'suggest', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'romantic', 'quot', 'movie', 'night', 'out.', 'quot', 'show', 'will', 'evaporate', 'romantic', 'mood', 'may', 'have', 'Trust', 'one', 'can', 'turn', 'girlfriend', 'misandrist', 'ladies', 'want', 'watch', 'please', 'prepare', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'most', 'reviewers', 'already', 'said', 'one', 'heck', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'premise', '2', 'men', 'Chad', 'Howard', 'are', 'quot', 'quot', 'woman', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'rip', 'heart', 'figuratively', 'speaking', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'stylized', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happy', 'cozy', 'ending', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'provocative', 'yet', 'realistic', 'can', 'see', 'happening', 'ordinary', 'day-to-day', 'living', ""'re"", 'more', 'likely', 'see', 'scene', 'movie', 'scene', 'cutesy', 'quot', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding.', 'quot', 'dark', 'comedy', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'comfortable', ""n't"", 'something', 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'own', 'moral', 'ethics.The', 'technicalities', 'movie', 'quite', 'poor', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'deduct', '1', 'star', 'Video', 'sound', 'quality', 'really', 'awful', 'poorer', 'average', 'Indie', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'sound', 'effects', 'hardly', 'musical', 'voice', 'recordings', 'have', 'static', 'Video', 'quality', 'grainy', 'low', 'saturation', 'really', 'look', 'playing', 'VCR', 'even', ""'m"", 'watching', 'DVD', 'version', 'more', 'extraneous', 'info', 'take', 'moral', 'story', 'are', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'jerk', 'Chad', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'wishy-washy', 'weakling', 'Howard', 'stand', 'ground', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'pushed', 'characters', 'have', 'strengths', 'weakness', 'think', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'losers', 'even', 'movie', 'Howard', 'more', 'quot', 'guy.', 'quot', 'thought', 'Howard', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'backbone', 'am', 'disappointed', 'end', 'never', 'really', 'stood', 'up']",N/A

This movie is about more than misogyny. And, it's great to watch just for Eckhart's performance alone. BOTTOM LINE: It's not cheezy, there's no fancy music to sway you to one side or the other.

For the other, more vitriolic way, look no further than Neil LaBute's fascinating study, &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;.LaBute creates a white-shirted world of angry white men, &quot;unfairly&quot; jettisoned to open the new corporate offices in another city.  Marketing exec Chad is angry that his 'Nuts and Gum' power is waning, and concocts a scheme to salvage some shred of dignity before being dragged out to pasture.  He convinces his boss and friend, a pushover named Howard, to doubleteam wine-and-dine a hopeless and handicapped woman, only to drop her like a sack of potatoes once their six-week sojourn is up.  Her pain will become their entertainment.  A more misogynistic setup you'll never find.Matt Malloy as Howard begins as a fine middle-management flunky.  This is his first project in power, and Malloy portrays his anxiety and uneasiness quite effectively in the beginning.  Unfortunately, his work becomes embarrassing later on, when he has to shed the corporate veneer and wear his heart on his sleeve.  The character is written well (blandly sincere in the best sense) but Malloy isn't up to the challenge of the film's climax.  Stacey Edwards as Christine is believable as a terminally shy office temp.  Her deaf voice (which is skewered mercilessly by her antagonists) is authentic, and so is her vulnerability.  There's a scene near the end where she is confronted by the horrors of her situation, and it's just heartbreaking.But neither of these two leading performances registers on the memory, due to Aaron Eckhart's ball-of-fire turn as Chad.  Chad is as toxic as a Troma film.  He has balls the size of watermelons.  And he's as fake as the Hitler diaries.  Eckhart imbues these qualities (for lack of a better world) with intense glee.  Witness him finally pull the curtain back to skewer Christine.  You can almost see the venom dripping from his lips as he metaphorically tears her flesh apart.  It's a riveting, charismatic, and important performance that dominates the whole movie.LaBute wears two hats here.  The first, as screenwriter, is nearly note-perfect.  He does wonders with the banality of office dialogue, sprinkling it with nonsense titles and terms and then popping in a crude joke to lighten things up.  He's at his best when writing for Chad, whether it's venting speeches or insincere pillow talk.  This is no holds barred, straight from the id, guy talk.  And even though it appears exaggerated, LaBute gets the tone just right.  The other hat he wears is that of director.  And even though he's hampered by a miniscule budget, he manages at least one stylistic choice that works beautifully.  Most of the movie is composed of long takes, with the camera positioned a good distance from the action, rarely moving.  This gives the film a voyeuristic, almost documentary feel.  When the actors are on, and the scene is working, the audience feels privy to a world they wouldn't otherwise be invited into.  It's very effective given the subject matter.This is a fascinating snapshot of late-'90's disaffection.  LaBute never panders to optimism, right down to the shocking twist ending.  He gives you a gloriously even (and most of the time vicariously fun) take on a subject many will find uncomfortable, but most should be confronted with.",4,A Dynamic LaBute and Eckhart Doubleteam,991785600,"06 6, 2001",2001,3701,"['Remember', 'episode', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'where', 'Homer', 'can', 'cupboard', 'labeled', ""'Nuts"", 'Gum', 'Together', 'Last', 'handful', 'chomping', 'quot', ""'m"", 'white', 'male', 'age', '18', '49', 'quot', 'quot', 'Everyone', 'matter', 'how', 'dumb', 'suggestions', 'are.', 'quot', 'Well', 'light-hearted', 'ironic', 'way', 'wielding', 'satirical', 'sword', 'white', 'man', 'burden', 'other', 'more', 'vitriolic', 'way', 'look', 'further', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'fascinating', 'study', 'quot', 'Company', 'Men', 'quot', 'white-shirted', 'world', 'angry', 'white', 'men', 'quot', 'unfairly', 'quot', 'jettisoned', 'open', 'new', 'corporate', 'offices', 'city', 'Marketing', 'exec', 'Chad', 'angry', ""'Nuts"", 'Gum', 'power', 'waning', 'scheme', 'salvage', 'shred', 'dignity', 'being', 'dragged', 'out', 'pasture', 'boss', 'friend', 'pushover', 'named', 'Howard', 'doubleteam', 'wine-and-dine', 'hopeless', 'handicapped', 'woman', 'only', 'drop', 'sack', 'potatoes', 'once', 'six-week', 'sojourn', 'up', 'pain', 'will', 'become', 'entertainment', 'more', 'misogynistic', 'setup', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find.Matt', 'Malloy', 'Howard', 'fine', 'middle-management', 'flunky', 'first', 'project', 'power', 'Malloy', 'anxiety', 'uneasiness', 'quite', 'effectively', 'beginning', 'Unfortunately', 'work', 'becomes', 'embarrassing', 'later', 'when', 'shed', 'corporate', 'veneer', 'wear', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'character', 'written', 'well', 'blandly', 'sincere', 'best', 'sense', 'Malloy', ""n't"", 'up', 'challenge', 'film', 'climax', 'Stacey', 'Edwards', 'Christine', 'believable', 'terminally', 'shy', 'office', 'temp', 'deaf', 'voice', 'skewered', 'mercilessly', 'antagonists', 'authentic', 'so', 'vulnerability', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'confronted', 'horrors', 'situation', 'just', 'heartbreaking.But', 'two', 'leading', 'performances', 'registers', 'memory', 'due', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'ball-of-fire', 'turn', 'Chad', 'Chad', 'as', 'toxic', 'Troma', 'film', 'size', 'watermelons', 'as', 'fake', 'Hitler', 'diaries', 'Eckhart', 'qualities', 'lack', 'better', 'world', 'intense', 'glee', 'Witness', 'finally', 'pull', 'curtain', 'back', 'skewer', 'Christine', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'venom', 'dripping', 'lips', 'metaphorically', 'flesh', 'apart', 'riveting', 'charismatic', 'important', 'performance', 'whole', 'movie.LaBute', 'wears', 'two', 'hats', 'here', 'first', 'screenwriter', 'nearly', 'note-perfect', 'wonders', 'banality', 'office', 'dialogue', 'sprinkling', 'nonsense', 'titles', 'terms', 'then', 'popping', 'crude', 'joke', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'best', 'when', 'writing', 'Chad', 'venting', 'speeches', 'insincere', 'pillow', 'talk', 'barred', 'straight', 'id', 'guy', 'talk', 'even', 'exaggerated', 'LaBute', 'tone', 'just', 'right', 'other', 'hat', 'director', 'even', 'hampered', 'miniscule', 'budget', 'least', 'one', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'beautifully', 'Most', 'movie', 'composed', 'long', 'camera', 'positioned', 'good', 'distance', 'action', 'rarely', 'moving', 'film', 'voyeuristic', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'When', 'actors', 'are', 'scene', 'working', 'audience', 'feels', 'privy', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'be', 'invited', 'very', 'effective', 'given', 'subject', 'matter.This', 'fascinating', 'snapshot', ""late-'90"", 'disaffection', 'LaBute', 'never', 'optimism', 'right', 'down', 'shocking', 'twist', 'ending', 'gloriously', 'even', 'most', 'time', 'vicariously', 'fun', 'take', 'subject', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'uncomfortable', 'most', 'should', 'be', 'confronted']",N/A

People change to acomodate themselves for a woman or man they love (""The Shape of Things""), and people (successful people) sometimes hurt others for the perverse sheer of it.  Power is to make people do things that they wouldn't do voluntarily, but do it anyway.  To convince them that what they must do is even their idea is absolute power, and this is what the film is about (and many other things).  Chad is a bad man, but the system which acomodates him is no better: it is in fact the source of the possibility of evil, if not the direct producer.  The deaf girl goes out at the same time with a hunk and with a boss, and doesn't have a problem with it.  She later explain what made her to be bad, but forgets to add why between the two she choosed the bad guy (Chad probably hinted things to see her blindly comply).Doing bad to others because you can or because somebody did something to you: relevant to our times, be it in Israel (wink wink) or in the USA.  I only wish LaBute to prescribe something after his descriptions of social hell.  Or at least explore the causes and different levels of consequences of horrible acts.  But he doesn't.  He presents us with the essence of the social evil and let us reflect ourselves on it.  And that was in 1997.Now, in 2005, the situation is not better.  If neo-conservative economics (an oxymoron, btw), false feminism (in a ""Sex on the City"" style) and the fall of middle and middle-low class man are allowed to continue, we will have only ourselves to blame for the results.  ""In the Company of Men"" is only a hint of what is hovering over us.  Lets get cover.P.S.: There is only one thing that bothers me about the film: the tendency to give expected punchlines, as when Chad is telling his co-workers how he despises one sales rep or another.  Is unnecesary and adds a layer of ""independent-film"" fashionable cynism that this film doesn't need.

Originally, description of the movie was about two men on the business trip playing a crude, scheming seduction game on a vulnerable, deaf woman.  Now that I have seen the film, it is so much more that what a short blip about the film weants you to believe.  This film is about perfidity of seduction as much as it is about false friensdhips, corporate coldbloded fight for power, getting ahead of other people by any means possible and overall fakeness between people's relationships no matter how much we think we know them.  Many of the scenes from the film are filmed in places most people familar with business trips will consider drab: airports, cheap restaurants, generic hotel rooms.  There is also corporate office setup that adds to the bleakness of its characters and the story plot.  Although the story itself is horrific from every possible perspective, I loved performance by Aaron Eckhart who plays charismatic Chad that finds his release in demeaning, hurting and toying with other people, their loves, careers and emotions.  Chad is so emotionally empty that the only thrill he can feel is in creating his schemes that destroy everyone around him.  On the surface likeable, Chad character is a reminder that things in life are never what they seem to be.  If you like A. Eckhart is this film, I recommend you also check his talent is two other films "" Thank you for smoking"" and ""Conversations with Other Women"".  He is very talented actor, very versatile and in my humble opinion underrated.  Let's hope we see more of him in the future. Director Neil LaButte did a fine work with this film.

4653,A1J2931UBBJPXM,076780094X,Reviewer,"[4, 6]","A film that reads like an essay on how to get ahead by laying waste to everyone and everything in one's path, while giving no quarter and taking no prisoners, ""In The Company Of Men,"" written and directed by Neil LaBute, is a starkly brutal movie that examines the darkest side of the human condition and the depths of evil to which an individual is capable of descending without knowing remorse.  Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are business associates, ten years out of university (they attended the same school), and are about to embark on a six week special assignment in another city for their company.  As they wait to board their plane, Howard reveals to Chad that his girlfriend has just dumped him; aboard the plane, Chad shares with Howard that his girlfriend has just dumped him as well, in a quite insensitive manner, at that.  No warning, no note, just one day- gone- end of story.  Chad muses to Howard that things seem to be getting out of hand; women have the upper hand in relationships, and even worse, seemingly in the workplace, too (not to mention the competition from the younger guys coming up and already snapping at their heels, career wise).  ""You can't even tell a joke in the workplace anymore,"" he tells him.  And it's time to do something about it.  Toward that end, Chad hatches a scheme through which they can get back on top and ""regain their dignity.""  And for the rest of their lives, no matter how bad their relationships go or what ""they"" do to them at work, they'll always have this one thing, something that's worse than anything anyone will ever have done to them.  At first Howard isn't sure, because it's so ""out there,""  but Chad sells him on the idea, and they go to work.  Their plan is to do it over the next six weeks, then it's over and they're on their way home.  Back on top.  Forever.  So begins what can only be called a study in abject cruelty and humiliation and, moreover, of a sick mind that in many ways is more telling than anything gleaned from movies such as ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" or ""The Cell.""  What's so unsettling is the fact that Chad is so ""normal;"" the young, clean-cut, charismatic all-American role model type, and to discover that such a person is capable of such unconscionable behavior is enough to awaken the paranoia in even the most jaded observer.  The mere concept of Chad's scheme is so despicable even to contemplate, that to see it actually played out becomes almost unbearable at times to keep watching.  But you can't help yourself; LaBute's deft handling of his own material makes it so engrossing that you simply can't look away.  He takes you right down the path to where he wants you, and knows exactly which buttons to push along the way to keep you there.  Even against your own will.  Aaron Eckhart gives a remarkable, almost chilling, performance as Chad; to be able to create such a loathsome character, someone who can evoke such utter contempt, bespeaks his ability as an actor.  This is a guy you will not soon forget, and  may make you think twice about more than a few casual acquaintances and co-workers, while wondering if things or people are ever actually as they seem.  That Chad is someone with whom you can so readily identify (at least on the surface), makes this brush with him all the more disquieting.  To have to acknowledge his perverse power over others is even more so.  As ultimately one of the pawns in Chad's game, Matt Malloy gives a good performance as Howard, but it's a character for whom it is hard to muster much sympathy.  The most notable performance in the film, however, is turned in by Stacy Edwards (Christine).  It's a tough part, and she plays it to perfection with just the right touches of strength and vulnerability that gain her the empathy of the audience while making her an entirely sympathetic and memorable character.  A hard-hitting drama punctuated with a driving score (that is especially effective during the transitions of the passing weeks), ""In The Company Of Men"" will get your adrenaline pumping and make your blood boil at the same time.  It's a sad commentary on society, but a wake-up call with a moral just the same.  It's a case of acquainting oneself with ugliness, that one may then recognize and appreciate true beauty.  Be forewarned, this is a movie that will get under your skin; but at the same time, it's going to make you know you're alive.  You may not like it, but you're definitely going to feel it.",4,Powerful Film From Neil LaBute,972086400,"10 21, 2000",2000,4482,"['film', 'essay', 'how', 'get', 'ahead', 'laying', 'waste', 'everyone', 'everything', 'one', 'path', 'giving', 'quarter', 'taking', 'prisoners', 'Company', 'Men', 'written', 'directed', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'starkly', 'brutal', 'movie', 'darkest', 'side', 'human', 'condition', 'depths', 'evil', 'individual', 'capable', 'descending', 'knowing', 'remorse', 'Chad', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Howard', 'Matt', 'Malloy', 'are', 'business', 'associates', 'ten', 'years', 'university', 'attended', 'same', 'school', 'are', 'embark', 'six', 'week', 'special', 'assignment', 'city', 'company', 'wait', 'board', 'plane', 'Howard', 'Chad', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'dumped', 'plane', 'Chad', 'shares', 'Howard', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'dumped', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'insensitive', 'manner', 'warning', 'note', 'just', 'one', 'day-', 'gone-', 'end', 'story', 'Chad', 'Howard', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'hand', 'women', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'relationships', 'even', 'worse', 'seemingly', 'workplace', 'too', 'not', 'mention', 'competition', 'younger', 'guys', 'coming', 'up', 'already', 'snapping', 'heels', 'career', 'wise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'joke', 'workplace', 'anymore', 'time', 'do', 'something', 'Toward', 'end', 'Chad', 'scheme', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'top', 'regain', 'dignity', 'rest', 'lives', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'relationships', 'go', 'what', 'do', 'work', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'something', 'worse', 'anything', 'anyone', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'done', 'first', 'Howard', ""n't"", 'sure', 'so', 'there', 'Chad', 'idea', 'go', 'work', 'plan', 'do', 'next', 'six', 'weeks', 'then', ""'re"", 'way', 'home', 'Back', 'top', 'Forever', 'So', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'study', 'abject', 'cruelty', 'humiliation', 'moreover', 'sick', 'mind', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'telling', 'anything', 'gleaned', 'movies', 'such', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Cell', 'What', 'so', 'unsettling', 'fact', 'Chad', 'so', 'normal', 'young', 'clean-cut', 'charismatic', 'all-American', 'role', 'model', 'type', 'discover', 'person', 'capable', 'such', 'unconscionable', 'behavior', 'enough', 'awaken', 'paranoia', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'observer', 'mere', 'concept', 'Chad', 'scheme', 'so', 'despicable', 'even', 'contemplate', 'see', 'actually', 'played', 'out', 'becomes', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'times', 'keep', 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'LaBute', 'deft', 'handling', 'own', 'material', 'so', 'engrossing', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'right', 'down', 'path', 'where', 'exactly', 'buttons', 'push', 'along', 'way', 'keep', 'there', 'Even', 'own', 'will', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'remarkable', 'almost', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Chad', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'such', 'loathsome', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'evoke', 'such', 'utter', 'contempt', 'bespeaks', 'ability', 'actor', 'guy', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'may', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'more', 'few', 'casual', 'acquaintances', 'co-workers', 'wondering', 'things', 'people', 'are', 'ever', 'actually', 'seem', 'Chad', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'so', 'readily', 'identify', 'least', 'surface', 'brush', 'more', 'disquieting', 'have', 'acknowledge', 'perverse', 'power', 'others', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'ultimately', 'one', 'pawns', 'Chad', 'game', 'Matt', 'Malloy', 'good', 'performance', 'Howard', 'character', 'whom', 'hard', 'muster', 'much', 'sympathy', 'most', 'notable', 'performance', 'film', 'however', 'turned', 'Stacy', 'Edwards', 'Christine', 'tough', 'part', 'perfection', 'just', 'right', 'touches', 'strength', 'vulnerability', 'empathy', 'audience', 'making', 'entirely', 'sympathetic', 'memorable', 'character', 'hard-hitting', 'drama', 'punctuated', 'driving', 'score', 'especially', 'effective', 'transitions', 'passing', 'weeks', 'Company', 'Men', 'will', 'get', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'make', 'blood', 'boil', 'same', 'time', 'sad', 'commentary', 'society', 'wake-up', 'call', 'moral', 'just', 'same', 'case', 'acquainting', 'ugliness', 'one', 'may', 'then', 'recognize', 'appreciate', 'true', 'beauty', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'skin', 'same', 'time', 'going', 'make', 'know', ""'re"", 'alive', 'may', 'not', 'like', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'going', 'feel']",N/A

MCCOSKER,"[5, 14]","This is a terrific little independent film, filled with fascinating dialogue, fine acting (though a stronger actor than Matt Malloy would've helped bring ""Howard"" more to life), and revealing cinematography.  The story goes where it needs to, without regard to Hollywood convention.  No happy ending here.  In the big studio version, Billy Crystal would play Chad; Tom Hanks, Howard; and Meg Ryan, Christine.  Chad would get his rightful comeuppance, and Howard and Christine would joyously unite in the end.Many reviews say this movie is about corporate greed, or male competition/anger, or whatnot.  Sure, it has to do with those things, but ultimately those are sideshows.  What many don't realize, but what's central to this quintessential story of the 1990s is that it's really an allegory about Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and their stormy relationship with American people.Chad, of course, is Clinton stripped down to an everyman mid-level executive; Howard is nothing more than Clinton's unwitting rival, Gingrich; and Christine, and Chad's live-in girlfriend, are nothing less than the voters, at once wooed, seduced, betrayed, and wounded by their erstwhile suitors.  Howard, recently selected to head an important project just as Gingrich had recently become House Speaker, is in over his head-and heart-amid shark-infested waters.  And who better to eat him alive than the honcho shark himself, Chad/Bill?  Eager to please, confused about principles, lacking killer instincts, drunk on imagined power, and unable to discipline his emotions, Howard/Newt hasn't a chance against his ruthlessly conniving assassin.  Meanwhile, Chad/Bill shamelessly wins over and destroys, yes, his Christine/Hillary/Gennifer/Monica/Juanita and, indeed, the entire company culture/American public, making them adore him for his alpha-male charms all the while he exploits and abuses them.Writer-director Neil LaBute has fashioned a political allegory of the highest order:  One so subtle it scarcely intrudes into the intrinsic drama, yet powerful enough to define the politics of the '90s better than a whole bookshelf of political tomes.

One thing it is not, not even remotely, is a comedy.  Anyone honestly considering it as such would be someone I'd frankly hope never to have to meet.  It is far too dark and unfunny for that.  I have to say, though, that I wasn't as appalled over the subject matter as most people seem to be, and that fact in itself makes me far more uneasy than the movie itself: the fact that I have known so many Chads (of both sexes, in fact) in my life, especially my corporate life, that I took the movie's version for cynical granted while watching it.  The movie certainly offers a depressing chunk of introspective on human nature in the workplace, if nothing else.The story and script are decent, and the characters and acting are quite good, but there's not much in the way of redemption or insight or enjoyment to make it as worthwhile an exercise as most reviews would lead you to believe.  Nonetheless, it's interesting viewing, even if you'll only want to watch it once.I do have to add a note about the technical quality of this DVD: it is indeed atrocious.

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[3, 3]","Sociopaths are generally believed to be totally selfish, lacking in empathy with other people and believe themselves to be above the law.  Not surprisingly 75% of men in prison can be classified this way.  However what if the sociopath has above average intelligence, good looks, health, opportunities and charisma?  He may find a way to operate within the bounds of society and become very successful in the business or political world not caring how his behavior may effect others.  Chad, the main character in the film IN THE COMPANY OF MEN seems to meet the definition of sociopath.  We first meet him and  nerdy co-worker Howard in an airport lounge bemoaning their bad luck in having to leave ""civilization"" (company headquarters) to spend six weeks getting a never named project started in a small unnamed city (the movie was filmed in Ft. Wayne, Indiana).  Howard who is actually higher in the company than Chad has recently been deserted by a fiance and Chad ""tells"" Howard he is also bitter over the recent sudden move out of his girlfriend.  Chad who resembles a popular thirty year old fraternity boy comes up with a plan to both pass their six weeks in the boonies and get some revenge on womankind.  They will both romance a ""wallflower"" type girl and then devastate her when she finds it was all an elaborate practical joke.  They find Christine an attractive typist in their office who has a speech impediment because of her deafness and the cruel plan is set in motion.  The movie is very well acted by the three principal actors and sadly seems realistic despite the dark plot and permeating cruelty that sometimes makes it difficult to watch.  A final twist is revealed near the end of the film and the closing shot of Howard and Christine is very haunting.
