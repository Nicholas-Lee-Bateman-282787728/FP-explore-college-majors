Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess.

366671,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6303257828,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[52, 53]","Richard Harris is brilliant as Abraham, strong as well as tender, and with the ability to convey emotion so  perfectly in his voice that it's a performance that can be enjoyed by just listening to it.It covers Genesis 11:27 through Chapter 22:17, and stays fairly close to the scripture,though there are a few omissions, and some additions to fill out the film; I especially like Abraham teaching Ishmael and Isaac, in separate scenes, the principles of the sacrificial rite. Christians will appreciate that Isaac was one of the ""types"" that run through the Old Testament pointing to Jesus.Among the other changes/additions are the shifting of the meeting with Melchizedek (Ch. 14), to after God makes a covenant with Abraham to give him the land of the ""ites"" in Ch. 15 (Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, etc );  Lot offering himself as well as his daughters to the people of Sodom as a substitute for his guests, and also in this film Lot is the one that suggests he separate his family and flocks from Abraham's, instead of the other way around.Abraham was 75 when he started his immense journey of faith, and there are scenes where he talks and listens to God that are wonderful.This would not be a good film for children however, as it is not a colorful film, with the sets and costumes all in earth tones, and there are many animals that suffer a bad fate, either from the famine that takes place in the early part of the film, or the sacrifices.The cast is splendid, with Barbara Hershey excellent as the beautiful Sarah, as is Carolina Rosi, who makes a stunning Hagar. John Gottfried plays Abraham's faithful steward Eliezar, and two venerable international actors have smaller roles, Vittorio Gassman as Terah, and Maximillian Schell as Pharaoh.Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, it has lovely cinematography by Raffaele Mertes, score by Marco Frisina, and is a way above average TV production...and for Richard Harris fans, a performance not to be missed.",5,"""and you shall be the father of many nations""",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,1961,"['Richard', 'Harris', 'brilliant', 'Abraham', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'tender', 'ability', 'convey', 'emotion', 'so', 'perfectly', 'voice', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'listening', 'it.It', 'covers', 'Genesis', '11:27', 'Chapter', '22:17', 'fairly', 'close', 'scripture', 'are', 'few', 'omissions', 'additions', 'fill', 'out', 'film', 'especially', 'Abraham', 'teaching', 'Ishmael', 'Isaac', 'separate', 'scenes', 'principles', 'sacrificial', 'rite', 'Christians', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Isaac', 'was', 'one', 'types', 'run', 'Old', 'Testament', 'pointing', 'Jesus.Among', 'other', 'changes/additions', 'are', 'shifting', 'meeting', 'Melchizedek', 'Ch', '14', 'God', 'covenant', 'Abraham', 'give', 'land', 'ites', 'Ch', '15', 'Hittites', 'Perizzites', 'Jebusites', 'etc', 'Lot', 'offering', 'as', 'well', 'daughters', 'people', 'Sodom', 'substitute', 'guests', 'also', 'film', 'Lot', 'one', 'separate', 'family', 'flocks', 'Abraham', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'around.Abraham', 'was', '75', 'when', 'started', 'immense', 'journey', 'faith', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'God', 'are', 'wonderful.This', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'children', 'however', 'not', 'colorful', 'film', 'sets', 'costumes', 'earth', 'tones', 'are', 'many', 'animals', 'suffer', 'bad', 'fate', 'either', 'famine', 'place', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'sacrifices.The', 'cast', 'splendid', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'excellent', 'beautiful', 'Sarah', 'Carolina', 'Rosi', 'who', 'stunning', 'Hagar', 'John', 'Gottfried', 'Abraham', 'faithful', 'steward', 'Eliezar', 'two', 'venerable', 'international', 'actors', 'have', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Vittorio', 'Gassman', 'Terah', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'Pharaoh.Filmed', 'Quarzazate', 'Morocco', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'Raffaele', 'Mertes', 'score', 'Marco', 'Frisina', 'way', 'average', 'TV', 'production', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'fans', 'performance', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Abraham VHS

Richard Harris does an amazing job as Abraham, and brings him to life as I've never seen before on screen. I felt he made him human and gave him a personality, something lacking when you go to church sometimes. I also felt that the others in the movie helped to give this movie life and made it very interesting. Not only is the acting in this movie top notch, but the actual setting was very inspiration too. It really brought you into the time that Abraham would have lived.I have to say that this movie is pretty good when it comes to Scripture too. It doesn't just go over the main parts of the story, it has the less often told parts too.

It skips to Jacob I think.This story was more accurate than what I had pictured in my head as I read the scriptures. They got some of the points that I have always overlooked.Richard Harris was a good choice to play Abraham. This portrayal made me wonder just how much Abraham really confided in Sarah, as much as they showed here? The 'battle' between Sarah and Hagar was cut short here. It would have been impractical to do it any other way. I also hadn't realized that Hagar came on the scene after they were sent from Egypt.

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[7, 8]","If you are considering this DVD, know that it is part of a BIBLE COLLECTION BOX SET of 6 DVDs, at less than half of the price of buying them one by one, (featuring ABRAHAM, JACOB, JOSEPH, MOSES, SAMSON & DELILAH, and DAVID), the Box Set is currently under $50, while separately they sell for at least $15 each. The Box Set is definitely the way to buy if you are building a Bible DVD collection!In ABRAHAM, Richard Harris is perfectly cast! He looks like the classical image of Abraham, and his acting carries the whole film effortlessly, brilliantly.Barbara Hershey almost redeems herself as Sarah, after having played Magdalene in the awfully foolish THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST film.This movie covers most of the Bible writings about Abraham, in the book of Genesis.  They show pretty much all of the major points. I like that they show Abraham's father, Terah, as well as Lot and his wife and daughters. Eliezer, Abraham's right-hand man, is also shown.They cover Abram leaving the land of his father's. They have God speaking to Abram, sometimes the viewer can hear God, sometimes not. They show the trip to Egypt, and lying about Abram's wife/sister.  They actually are pretty in-depth, beyond scripture, up to this point.They have Lot moving to Sodom, getting kidnapped, and Abram rallying his men to rescue everybody. They show Melchizedek, the High Priest of God, but don't show Abram doing the first tithe in the Bible.The scenes with Sarai and Hagar are all good. Actually, it is interesting how they show that Sarai is a midwife for helping to deliver babies for their people, which could be Scriptural, when Sarai says Hagar will deliver Abram's son on Sarai's  knees, I think. At least a lot of these scenes are so close to Scripture that you have to look them up to verify them, or not! I like that! It makes you learn and remember more about Scripture, in a fun way, by watching a movie as a supplement to regular Bible reading.They cover the destruction of Sodom, and don't avoid the homosexual aspect, but only show it briefly.The movie pretty much ends after the sacrifice of Isaac scene.This is probably one of the best of the 9 movies made by LUBE Productions, in the 1990's. THE BIBLE COLLECTION BOX SET  has 6 of them, which are all 3 hours long, except for JACOB at 90 minutes.

366679,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,6303257828,Chris Luallen,"[3, 4]","This film offers a serious, respectful and well made treatment of the Bible's story of Abraham. It starts with Abraham being told by God that he should seek out a new land where ""I will make you into a great nation"". The movie ends with the scene of Abraham offering his son, Issac, as a sacrifice to God. It was shot on location in the Middle East, features some fine acting from Richard Harris and Barbara Hershey and possesses a reasonably high degree of historical accuracy.However, viewers should keep in mind that many scenes included in this film do not come from the Bible itself. But are instead fictitious stories made up by the filmakers. The chronology of biblical events is also switched around and certain details are changed. For example, in the movie Eliezer from Damacus is given an expanded role as a man Abraham discovers dying of thirst in the desert while trying to escape from slavery. Eliezer then becomes Abraham's closest friend and confidant.  However, in the the Bible Eliezer receives only a passing mention - as a household servant who Abraham is worried will inherit his estate if he dies childless. I could offer many more examples where the movie differs from the biblical account.To some extent this is understandable because the Bible's story of Abraham is quite short, with the first hour of the movie drawn from only a single page of biblical text. However, I would have preferred that the film have shortened it's length from over 3 hours to 2 hours or less in order to follow the biblical story more closely. I am not saying this because I am a biblical literalist. Actually, my interest in religon is more intellectual than faith based. However, I do believe in preserving the integrity of this important, ancient text which countless people throughout world history have believed to be sacred.This is still a movie worth watching.

In contrast, it seems like the goal in ""Abraham"" was to stretch 10 bible verses into an entire hour...and the stories they made up were slow and boring anyway!The Bible is exciting enough all by itself (e.g. Joseph). Perhaps, the producers have learned this lesson, since ""Joseph"" is more recent.I have to admit, I was so excited about this series after seeing ""Joseph"" that I was ready to buy the entire collection. Now, when even eight and ten year olds are annoyed by so many ""made up"" parts, I will act more slowly.For example, their impression was so bad that my older son was saying, ""they'd better not leave out the sacrifice of Isaac part."" Fortunately, they didn't leave it out!I was particularly disappointed in the portrayal of God's covenant with Abraham. The Bible gives a rich description of the formal ceremony that took place. This was completely omitted; and the producers do not have the lame excuse that it had to be cut for the sake of time...they clearly preferred their 'made up stories' to the actual Bible stories.In summary, we rate the first half the movie ""1"" and the last half of the movie ""3-4"" so we gave it a ""2.""",2,"Too much liberty with the facts, especially the first hour",1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1614,"['sons', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'mom', 'went', 'bed', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'are', 'really', 'disappointed', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'totally', 'made', 'up', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'Joseph', 'same', 'producers', 'were', 'so', 'impressed', 'were', 'looking', 'forward', 'one.What', 'impressed', 'Joseph', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'words', 'youngest', 'son', 'stuff', 'movie', 'actually', 'Bible', 'contrast', 'goal', 'Abraham', 'was', 'stretch', '10', 'bible', 'verses', 'entire', 'hour', 'stories', 'made', 'up', 'were', 'slow', 'boring', 'anyway', 'Bible', 'exciting', 'enough', 'e.g', 'Joseph', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'have', 'learned', 'lesson', 'Joseph', 'more', 'recent.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'series', 'seeing', 'Joseph', 'was', 'ready', 'buy', 'entire', 'collection', 'Now', 'when', 'even', 'eight', 'ten', 'year', 'olds', 'are', 'annoyed', 'so', 'many', 'made', 'up', 'parts', 'will', 'act', 'more', 'slowly.For', 'example', 'impression', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'older', 'son', 'was', 'saying', ""'d"", 'better', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'sacrifice', 'Isaac', 'part', 'Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'portrayal', 'God', 'covenant', 'Abraham', 'Bible', 'rich', 'description', 'formal', 'ceremony', 'took', 'place', 'was', 'completely', 'omitted', 'producers', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'lame', 'excuse', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'sake', 'time', 'clearly', 'preferred', ""'made"", 'up', 'stories', 'actual', 'Bible', 'stories.In', 'summary', 'rate', 'first', 'movie', '1', 'last', 'half', 'movie', '3-4', 'gave', '2']",Abraham VHS

Murphy,"[4, 9]","This is one of our favorite films, because it brings out the message of trust and hope and faithfulness of father Abraham (and his imperfectness at times).  This film does pretty well with the actual Biblical account, and it's rather inspiring spiritually because of it.  Pretty rock solid, actually.  We would like to say BUY this one, without question it's worth it, but do to the exception below we cannot!The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will ever approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

Maximilian Schell plays a engagingly corrupt and hedonistic Pharoah.Takes us from Abram being command by G-D to leave the land of his birth, his journey to Canaan, his encounter with Mamre at Hebron and his purchase of that region, his journey to Egypt where the Pharaoh tries to take Sarah as a wife, believing her to be Abram's sister, Abrams' role in the war of the four and five kings to rescue his nephew Lot, where Abram takes the role of a general, the destruction of Sodom, the birth of Abraham's sons. And the expulsion of Hagar and Ishmmael by Abram at Sarah's urging. Brilliantly captured was the rivalry between Sara and Hagar after Hagar becomes pregnant with Ishmael. Excellent depiction of Melchizedek King of Jerusalem's meeting with Abram.If fault can be found with this movie it is the fact that since the writers are aware of the Midrash they could have focused on Abram's discovery of the true G-D as child, and that he was considerably younger than portrayed when he smashed his father's idols. Also towards the end of the movie Ishmael is not shown as the 'wild ass of a man; who ruthlessly persecuted Isaac that he was, and Sarah's urging to send Ishmael away seems less justifiable when the movie portrays Ishmael as such a nice, clean cut boy.

366697,A20CR4907G7CTS,6303257828,Jeff Marzano,"[7, 30]","If life was anywhere near as dreary and depressing back then as this movie depicts people really didn't have much to live for.  Their main goal in life was getting enough food and water for themselves and their livestock.  People at that time weren't much more than cave men or basically animals themselves.  Throughout the movie Abraham looks like he hasn't washed his hair in weeks and he appears to be constantly dying of thirst.  He looks to be about 200 years old when the movie starts so I don't know how old he's supposed to be at the end.The only humorous event in the entire movie was when God tells Sarah she will have a child when she was about 90 years old.  She laughed which is what the name 'Isaac' means.Abraham believed in a single God while other around him believed in many gods.  This has been a source of conflict from the beginning and caused the eventual destruction of Atlantis.A very frightening event in Abe's life was when Sarah was kidnapped to become a sexual slave of the evil Egyptian pharoah.  It's impossible to know what a person like this would have been capable of doing to a female who refused to submit to their will.  (Barbara was in that nice movie called 'The Entity'.)  God sent a fever on the entire Egyptian population so that the evil pharoah would return Sarah and let the Hebrews go away.  God sending diseases and death on people is nothing to fool around with.There are many similarities between the lives of Abraham and Moses.  Both had problems with the Egyptians who represent the belief in many gods which included injustice and oppression of others.  The Egyptians at that time represented the mysterious occult world.The pharoahs claimed to be reincarnations of gods.  Abraham and Moses were reincarnations of God also in a way.  That may be why the voice of God in this movie sounds similar to Abraham's own voice.  Like Moses Abraham talked to God in a direct way.In a movie like this it's necessary to try to read between the lines about what really happened since it's based on the bible which has gone through many translations and undoubtedly contains errors about specific details.It's difficult to even put the events in Abe's life into perspective compared to modern society.  He didn't have any kids so his wife tells him to have a child with the slave girl that came with them from Egypt.  This was an apparent mistake on Abe's part since God did eventually give him and Sarah a child.  This serves as some type of lesson I think in that even though a mistake was made things worked out ok.  According to the closing remarks in the movie both of Abe's sons were present when he was buried.Abraham undoubtedly loved Sarah intensely since they stayed together for their entire lives even though they didn't have any children which was probably a major stigma back then.Movies like this are a good review of the bible in case you don't want to go back and read the bible again as I didn't but you want to review the information.  According to some other reviewers this movie stays pretty close to the scriptures.  God must have known people would make a movie about Abraham because there are quite a few important events in his life which gives the movie producers a lot of info to work with.Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern DiscoveriesEdgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever KnownEdgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of MosesThe Atlantis Dialogue: Plato's Original Story of the Lost City, Continent, Empire, Civilization",4,Good Review Of Biblical Events,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,3617,"['life', 'was', 'anywhere', 'near', 'dreary', 'depressing', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'people', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'live', 'main', 'goal', 'life', 'was', 'getting', 'enough', 'food', 'water', 'livestock', 'People', 'time', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'cave', 'men', 'basically', 'animals', 'movie', 'Abraham', ""n't"", 'washed', 'hair', 'weeks', 'be', 'constantly', 'dying', 'thirst', 'be', '200', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'old', 'supposed', 'be', 'end.The', 'only', 'humorous', 'event', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'God', 'Sarah', 'will', 'have', 'child', 'when', 'was', 'about', '90', 'years', 'old', 'laughed', 'what', 'name', ""'Isaac"", 'means.Abraham', 'believed', 'single', 'God', 'other', 'believed', 'many', 'gods', 'been', 'source', 'conflict', 'beginning', 'caused', 'eventual', 'destruction', 'Atlantis.A', 'very', 'frightening', 'event', 'Abe', 'life', 'was', 'when', 'Sarah', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'become', 'sexual', 'slave', 'evil', 'Egyptian', 'pharoah', 'impossible', 'know', 'what', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'capable', 'doing', 'female', 'who', 'refused', 'submit', 'will', 'Barbara', 'was', 'nice', 'movie', 'called', ""'The"", 'Entity', 'God', 'sent', 'fever', 'entire', 'Egyptian', 'population', 'evil', 'pharoah', 'would', 'return', 'Sarah', 'let', 'Hebrews', 'go', 'away', 'God', 'sending', 'diseases', 'death', 'people', 'nothing', 'fool', 'are', 'many', 'similarities', 'lives', 'Abraham', 'Moses', 'had', 'problems', 'Egyptians', 'who', 'represent', 'belief', 'many', 'gods', 'included', 'injustice', 'oppression', 'others', 'Egyptians', 'time', 'represented', 'mysterious', 'occult', 'world.The', 'pharoahs', 'claimed', 'be', 'reincarnations', 'gods', 'Abraham', 'Moses', 'were', 'reincarnations', 'God', 'also', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'voice', 'God', 'movie', 'similar', 'Abraham', 'own', 'voice', 'Moses', 'Abraham', 'talked', 'God', 'direct', 'way.In', 'movie', 'necessary', 'try', 'read', 'lines', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'based', 'bible', 'gone', 'many', 'translations', 'undoubtedly', 'errors', 'specific', 'details.It', 'difficult', 'even', 'put', 'events', 'Abe', 'life', 'perspective', 'compared', 'modern', 'society', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'wife', 'have', 'child', 'slave', 'girl', 'came', 'Egypt', 'was', 'apparent', 'mistake', 'Abe', 'part', 'God', 'did', 'eventually', 'give', 'Sarah', 'child', 'type', 'lesson', 'think', 'even', 'mistake', 'was', 'made', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'ok', 'According', 'closing', 'remarks', 'movie', 'Abe', 'sons', 'were', 'present', 'when', 'was', 'buried.Abraham', 'undoubtedly', 'loved', 'Sarah', 'intensely', 'stayed', 'together', 'entire', 'lives', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'was', 'probably', 'major', 'stigma', 'back', 'are', 'good', 'review', 'bible', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'bible', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'review', 'information', 'According', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'scriptures', 'God', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'Abraham', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'important', 'events', 'life', 'movie', 'producers', 'lot', 'info', 'work', 'with.Edgar', 'Cayce', 'Atlantis', 'Lemuria', 'Lost', 'Civilizations', 'Light', 'Modern', 'DiscoveriesEdgar', 'Cayce', 'Egypt', 'Psychic', 'Revelations', 'Most', 'Fascinating', 'Civilization', 'Ever', 'KnownEdgar', 'Cayce', 'Story', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Birth', 'Souls', 'Death', 'MosesThe', 'Atlantis', 'Dialogue', 'Plato', 'Original', 'Story', 'Lost', 'City', 'Continent', 'Empire', 'Civilization']",Abraham VHS
366698,A3EAI032S3EBBK,6303257828,"Jerry Parks ""USAToday All-American Teacher; N...","[128, 132]","As previously mentioned in reviews of other films of this genre, I teach  ancient civilizations to middle schoolers. For this reason, I am always looking for good films of the Biblical era, and this is certainly one of the best!Richard Harris portrays old Abraham as the fallible human being that he surely was. Barbara Hershey (Sarah) is equal to the challenge of becoming a woman who, even in her advanced years, maintains a beauty which can entice a Pharaoh of Egypt.The research production crew of Abraham certainly did their homework. As an ancient Sumerian, Abraham was part of a thriving and wealthy culture, which invented everything from schools, to surgery, to a codified law system. They were even the formulators of astrology, which the film skillfully sites as Abraham draws the signs of the zodiac in the sand for Isaac to learn. Probably an offensive moment to Biblical purists, but nevertheless--realistic and accurate.The Mesopotamian custom of producing a son through the wife's handmaid is handled with accuracy and tact. Relevant in light of today's Arab/Israeli conflict is the fact that this custom produced the Arab race extant today, while the children of Sarah's son Isaac became the Hebrews.Another piece of excellent background the film delivers, is the covenant-making ceremony in the presence of the king's 'Divine Right' to rule. The scene in Haran is exceptionally well done--right down to the Sumerian's penchant for bargaining.The animal sacrifice is handled with welcome reserve. So too, is the custom of midwifery, and how grief-stricken Sarah must've felt if she-childless, indeed did deliver so many children.If there is any complaint with the film, one might be the portrayal of Isaac as a young teen when he was being prepared as a sacrifice by his father.

It set a high standard for excellence in terms of presenting a dramatic story and in terms of presenting material from the bible. Most often, when one of these aspects succeeds, the other fails. In this case, both are done well.The story is of the patriarch, Abraham. He is called by God to leave his home and settle in a new area. He is promised that he will become the father of many nations. Throughout his sojourn, there are times when his faith or that of his followers falters. At these times, they will do things other than what they are commanded by God and generally have problems result from it. In the end, the promise is made good even though both Abraham and his wife are well past the age where these promises would seem realistic. God keeps promises.The other impressive thing about this presentation is the way it works in a host of details from the biblical story that are rarely dealt with. Since the story of Abraham is not one of the most popular for depiction, this may not be apparent to some but I noticed details which seldom make it into sermons or Sunday School presentations.The whole, though, is greater than the sum of the parts.

Barbara Hershey is equally good as Sarah - you really feel for both of them when they extremely reluctantly accept that Abraham's going to have to sleep with Hagar if they're ever going to have children in a time when fertility clinics were thousands of years away.  When Hagar demands some dignity as Ishmael's mother as well as a human being, you understand why this Sarah feels threatened and while not innately malicious does what she feels she has to do to protect Issac.Abraham's relationship with Lot also plays out nicely.  When God almost casually mentions His intention to destroy Sodom the look of horror on Abraham's face reminds you that this is very personal - he's about to bargain for the life of the nephew who was so close to him before they had to go their separate ways.And of course, it just gets worse before it gets better as Abraham is tested by having to send Ishmael out into the desert with Hagar, for all he knows to his death - and finally by being asked by God to personally kill Issac...Wonderful performances and beautiful scenery make this one a keeper.

Sometimes Abraham looks like he is in a trance where he hears God's voice.Some of the best scenes were:  God and the 2 angels appearing to Abraham and announcing to Sarah that she will bear Isaac; the angel of the Lord ministering to Hagar on her escape to Egypt, and the closing scene of Abraham's ""sacrifice"" of Isaac and God's intervention and covenant promises.That aside, I was really moved by this film.  It was great to see how God stood by His covenant to Abraham, how He appeared and spoke to Abraham on various occasions, and how He helped Abraham through his trials in Egypt, his problem with Hagar, and affirmed His promises to Abraham after he passes the test in Mount Moriah.  The biblical story of Abraham really came alive for me. I think this adaptation, along with ""Joseph"", are the best in the Turner Bible series.  Your faith in God will grow as a result of watching this film.  Highly recommended!",5,Excellent adaptation from the Bible,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,1500,"['one', 'favorites', 'Turner', 'series', 'Bible', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'outstanding', 'Abraham', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'marvelous', 'job', 'Sarah', 'depiction', 'most', 'part', 'accurate', 'Bible', 'are', 'depictions', 'were', 'interesting', 'interpretations', 'and/or', 'different', 'biblical', 'account', 'Abraham', 'audible', 'voice', 'God', 'own', 'voice', 'sin', 'Sodomites', 'Lot', 'connected', 'inhospitality', 'rather', 'sexual', 'immorality', 'afflictions', 'God', 'gave', 'Pharaoh', 'account', 'Sarah', 'was', 'abbreviated', 'one', 'instance', 'Sometimes', 'Abraham', 'trance', 'where', 'God', 'voice.Some', 'best', 'scenes', 'were', 'God', '2', 'angels', 'appearing', 'Abraham', 'announcing', 'Sarah', 'will', 'bear', 'Isaac', 'angel', 'Lord', 'ministering', 'Hagar', 'escape', 'Egypt', 'closing', 'scene', 'Abraham', 'sacrifice', 'Isaac', 'God', 'intervention', 'covenant', 'aside', 'was', 'really', 'moved', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'God', 'stood', 'covenant', 'Abraham', 'how', 'appeared', 'spoke', 'Abraham', 'various', 'occasions', 'how', 'helped', 'Abraham', 'trials', 'Egypt', 'problem', 'Hagar', 'affirmed', 'promises', 'Abraham', 'test', 'Mount', 'Moriah', 'biblical', 'story', 'Abraham', 'really', 'came', 'alive', 'think', 'adaptation', 'Joseph', 'are', 'best', 'Turner', 'Bible', 'series', 'faith', 'God', 'will', 'grow', 'result', 'watching', 'film', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Abraham VHS
366714,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,6303257828,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[5, 5]","Joseph Sargent, director of countless TV episodes and movies of everything from `Star Trek' and `Gunsmoke' to the movie `Jaws: The Revenge', does an admirable job of telling the story of Abraham here over 3 hours.  It certainly has an authentic feel to it, but critically it scores plaudits for portraying Abraham in such a human, down to earth and easy to understand way.Richard Harris heads a starry cast, making us really believe in the reality of a man who became the father of nations.  All the key moments are shown, through from deciding to leave Haran for Egypt, through to the births of his sons Ishmael and Isaac, and the final altar scene with Isaac.  This is an apt place to end, for the underlying theme shown is that of sacrifice and loving God above all.  When sacrificing, Isaac is reminded by his father to `pick the lamb you love the most, for in this way you are showing God you put him before all'.  It is this underlying understanding of the seemingly old fashioned concept of burnt sacrifice that is all too relevant to us today.For a TV movie, the production values are not bad, and mostly on location - the only let down moment being the destruction of Sodom which is only glimpsed and what we do glimpse is poorly done.However, the restrained way in which the other key events are shown are very realistic, and the cast all add significant gravitas to proceedings.  Other key performers are Maximillian Schell as the Pharaoh - surprisingly effective, and Barbara Hershey as Sara, Abrahams wife.Recommended not just for those already familiar with the story, but as a good summary for those discovering the story for the first time.",4,Authentic portrayal of life of Abraham,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1656,"['Joseph', 'Sargent', 'director', 'countless', 'TV', 'episodes', 'movies', 'everything', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Gunsmoke', 'movie', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'admirable', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'Abraham', 'here', '3', 'hours', 'certainly', 'authentic', 'feel', 'critically', 'plaudits', 'portraying', 'Abraham', 'such', 'human', 'down', 'earth', 'easy', 'understand', 'way.Richard', 'Harris', 'starry', 'cast', 'making', 'really', 'believe', 'reality', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'father', 'nations', 'key', 'moments', 'are', 'shown', 'deciding', 'leave', 'Haran', 'Egypt', 'births', 'sons', 'Ishmael', 'Isaac', 'final', 'altar', 'scene', 'Isaac', 'apt', 'place', 'end', 'underlying', 'theme', 'shown', 'sacrifice', 'loving', 'God', 'When', 'sacrificing', 'Isaac', 'reminded', 'father', 'pick', 'lamb', 'love', 'most', 'way', 'are', 'showing', 'God', 'put', 'underlying', 'understanding', 'seemingly', 'old', 'fashioned', 'concept', 'burnt', 'sacrifice', 'too', 'relevant', 'today.For', 'TV', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'mostly', 'location', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'moment', 'being', 'destruction', 'Sodom', 'only', 'glimpsed', 'what', 'do', 'poorly', 'done.However', 'restrained', 'way', 'other', 'key', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'cast', 'add', 'significant', 'gravitas', 'proceedings', 'Other', 'key', 'performers', 'are', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'Pharaoh', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Sara', 'Abrahams', 'wife.Recommended', 'not', 'just', 'already', 'familiar', 'story', 'good', 'summary', 'discovering', 'story', 'first', 'time']",Abraham VHS

366727,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,6303257828,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This inaugural miniseries in the TNT Bible Collection is probably the best film you will find on the Abraham story from the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew and Christian Bible. Richard Harris is really good as Abraham, the &#34;father of many&#34; who is the spiritual ancestor of Jews and Christians and Muslims. Barbara Hershey is sympathetic as his wife Sarah and Maximilian Schell and Gottfried John (&#34;GoldenEye&#34;) lend good supporting work. Unfortunately, long stretches of the film are dull and depict the story in a pedestrian way, with too many leisurely scenes of desert life that lend the film an uneven pacing. The screenplay doesn't offer an entirely linear interpretation of the relevant chapters in Genesis, offering historical context that is sometimes helpful and sometimes unnecessary. Scenes like God speaking to Abraham are done very well, but other divine manifestations like the visit of the angels to Abraham and destruction of Sodom are done in a hokey special effects fashion, giving us the most obvious literal interpretation rather than the truly creative renderings done in some other films of this series. Nevertheless, the film's leads are compelling and it offers a highly authentic depiction of ancient shepherd life, giving us impressively detailed recreations of animal sacrifice and covenant rituals. Indeed, sacrifice is at the heart of this story, with several animal sacrifices leading up to the beautiful climax of the sacrifice of Isaac. This final scene of Abraham's sacrifice, beginning with God asking him to give up what he loves most, is deeply moving and worth the price of purchase alone. Even if one doesn't watch this entire film regularly, it contains excellent individual scenes, and the final sacrifice scene is worth showing in a class or Bible study to capture the essence of Abraham's story. Like all films in the TNT Bible Series, this film is an international co-production marked by authentic Morocco locations and lush filmmaking. Unlike many hokey low-budget religious films, the films in this series are products of first class filmmaking craftsmanship, and they are always believable even when they are a bit dull or fall short of the big-budget spectacle of classic Hollywood Bible Epics.
