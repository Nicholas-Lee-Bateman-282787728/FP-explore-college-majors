187650,A73FVR5VRSO89,1572525398,Abhijoy Gandhi,"[3, 6]","THE AVIATOR'S WIFE - Eric Rohmer / France 1981 (3.5 STARS)15 December 2003: It is always difficult to get overtly excited about an Eric Rohmer film or make any relative comparisons with conviction - Eric Rohmer's works are almost like Jazz music, delicate in their appeal and full of irony, yet not given to the charts.  The Aviator's Wife, the 1st in Rohmer's series of Comedies & Proverbs is subtle like poetry by full of the irony of urban existence. Set in his hometown Paris (as most of his films are), this is a film about a young woman's insecurity about growing old lonely, and a young man's obsession with the slightly older woman.  Artfully made with a color palette that seems to reflect the hues of the lives of the characters, the film is talkative yet reflective and insecure with a certain confidence.* Mise-en-scene: The character's motivations are developed with painstaking detail in an attempt to build characters that we may grow to either love or loath, but irrespective respect as real people. I was drawn to the  young man's character in particular and to his singularly obsessive personality even though he was gentle and carefree at first sight.* The older woman was so typically stereo cast as idiosyncratic, intense and detached in a manner only the French can be.  In the final scene one feel for the boy when he discovers that the young girl he meets on the bus has been feeding him all along, but before we have time to react, Rohmer makes a comic joke of the situation by spinning the movie into a loop so that we end up almost where we started, except that we've got a different man that the protagonist is trailing this time around.* The Cinematography, is bland, almost dogma like (way before the birth of Dogma- this is 1981), and there is almost no emphasis at technique beyond functionality.  Yet sound is used to haunting effect, with ambient sound playing a potent character.  Whether this was because of poor on location sound or whether this has been used as a stylistic element to enhance the narrative is however difficult to tell.",4,Great eg. of psychologically subjective storytelling,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,2074,"['AVIATOR', 'WIFE', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', '/', 'France', '1981', '3.5', 'STARS', '15', 'December', '2003', 'always', 'difficult', 'get', 'overtly', 'excited', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'film', 'make', 'relative', 'comparisons', 'conviction', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'works', 'are', 'almost', 'Jazz', 'music', 'delicate', 'appeal', 'full', 'irony', 'yet', 'not', 'given', 'charts', 'Aviator', 'Wife', '1st', 'Rohmer', 'series', 'Comedies', 'Proverbs', 'subtle', 'poetry', 'full', 'irony', 'urban', 'existence', 'Set', 'hometown', 'Paris', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'insecurity', 'growing', 'old', 'lonely', 'young', 'man', 'obsession', 'slightly', 'older', 'woman', 'Artfully', 'made', 'color', 'palette', 'reflect', 'hues', 'lives', 'characters', 'film', 'talkative', 'yet', 'reflective', 'insecure', 'certain', 'confidence', '*', 'Mise-en-scene', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'developed', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'attempt', 'build', 'characters', 'may', 'grow', 'love', 'loath', 'irrespective', 'respect', 'real', 'people', 'was', 'drawn', 'young', 'man', 'character', 'particular', 'singularly', 'obsessive', 'personality', 'even', 'was', 'gentle', 'carefree', 'first', 'sight', '*', 'older', 'woman', 'was', 'so', 'typically', 'stereo', 'cast', 'idiosyncratic', 'intense', 'detached', 'manner', 'only', 'French', 'can', 'be', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'feel', 'boy', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'bus', 'been', 'feeding', 'along', 'have', 'time', 'react', 'Rohmer', 'comic', 'joke', 'situation', 'spinning', 'movie', 'loop', 'so', 'end', 'up', 'almost', 'where', 'started', ""'ve"", 'got', 'different', 'man', 'protagonist', 'trailing', 'time', 'around', '*', 'Cinematography', 'bland', 'almost', 'dogma', 'way', 'birth', 'Dogma-', '1981', 'almost', 'emphasis', 'technique', 'functionality', 'sound', 'used', 'haunting', 'effect', 'ambient', 'sound', 'playing', 'potent', 'character', 'was', 'poor', 'location', 'sound', 'been', 'used', 'stylistic', 'element', 'enhance', 'narrative', 'however', 'difficult', 'tell']",N/A

It was the first Rohmer film I saw, and it's not among his best, but is a very good introduction to his work (I think he has proven a much better director when he has tried to put his idiosyncratic take on historical subjects, such as in Perceval, Triple Agent and The Lady and the Duke). In this film, Philippe Marlaud (a young actor who unfortunately died a few months after this film was released in a freak accident) is jealous that his somewhat older girlfriend (Marie Riviere, a Rohmer regular) has been meeting against her previous flame, the titular aviator. (The aviator's wife, incidentally, does not appear in the film except in a photograph). He has catch the aviator coming out of Riviere's apartment, so he sets himself to discreetly follow him. For that endeavor, he accidentally enlists a very quirky high school student (Anne Laure Meury). The heart of the film occurs when they follow the aviator and a blond woman they believe is his wife. As it would later turn out, things are not what they appear. You can enjoy this movie for its dialogue, and for the performances, but it is also true that there is a certain question of what was Rohmer's point in this movie (which happens in a lot in his movies).

It is sweetly sad and humorous and knowing about the ways of men and women in love.It is not about the Aviator, nor his wife.  In the opening the Aviator dumps his younger mistress because his wife is pregnant and the mistress in turn spurns another younger man she's been seeing.  This young man, Francois, happens to see the Aviator with his &quot;love&quot; and later, by chance, takes the opportunity to follow him.  While tailing the Aviator who is with another woman, Francois meets a younger woman who helps him and in turn draws out the reason for his following the couple and ultimately his upset and confusion over the situation.The humor and the irony in the movie is that both women, the mistress and the younger student, try to tell Francois the truth about women and love...but he will not hear it.  Francois is so convinced of his own understanding of things (wrongly), that he cannot see the bright hope in front of him (the student) and the lost cause he is obsessing over (the mistress).

In fact, we'll just admire that lucky woman on a photography during a few seconds in Eric Rohmer's first movie of the  &quot;comedies and proverbs&quot; serie. But she really has, in the  Rohmer's way of thinking, the main role of the movie. She gets pregnant,  forcing her husband, a pilot, to make a choice between her and his 25 years  old mistress, Anne, the main character of the movie, played by Marie  Rivi&egrave;re who has been present now in 6 Eric Rohmer's movies.Christian's  decision is an emotional shock for Anne who is loved by Franois, a  night-shift employee. The action of THE AVIATOR'S WIFE, if one may call  &quot;action&quot; the discussions between characters composing a Rohmer's  movie, starts here. And lasts one day. At the end of the day, one character  will be emotionally wounded for life. And it won't be the aviator's  wife.If you love psychological movies with dialogs extremely well  written and everyday life characters, then THE AVIATOR'S WIFE is  definitively the movie for you.

187655,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572525398,Dennis Littrell,"[11, 12]","In this bittersweet tale of disconnections and possibilities perhaps we have the essence of the art of Eric Rohmer.  If you have only one Rohmer film to see, perhaps you ought to make it this one because it is so very, very French, so interestingly talkative (one of Rohmer's trademarks) and so very, very Rohmer.The Aviator's wife, incidentally does not appear except in a photograph, but that is all to the point.  Everything is a bit off stage in this intriguing drama: love especially is a bit off stage.  And yet how all the participants yearn.Marie Riviere stars as Anne who is in love with the aviator.  We catch her just as she learns that he no longer wants her.  He tells her that his wife is pregnant and so he must return to her.  Meanwhile, she is being pestered by Francois (Philippe Marlaud) who is in love with her.  However he is a little too young and ""clinging.""  Truly she is not interested.  It is a disconnection as far as she is concerned.The heart of the film occurs when Francois is following the aviator and the blond woman.  Francois is obsessive and jealous.  He follows because...it isn't clear and he really doesn't know why except that this is the man that Anne loves.  As it happens while he is following them he runs into a pretty fifteen-year-old (Lucie, played fetchingly by Anne-Laure Meury) who imagines that he is following her.  She turns it into a game, and again we have a disconnection.  She is fun and cute and full of life, but he cannot really see her because he pines for Anne.  Meanwhile Anne of course is pining for the aviator.Rohmer's intriguing little joke is about the aviator's wife.  Who is she and what is she like?  We can only imagine.  And this is right.  The woman imagines what the other woman is like, but never really knows unless she meets her.Maire Riviere is only passably pretty, but she has gorgeous limbs and beautiful skin and a hypnotic way about her, which Rohmer accentuates in the next to the last scene in her apartment with Francois.  We follow the talk between the two, of disconnection and off center possibilities, of friends and lovers with whom things are tantalizingly not exactly right and yet not tragically wrong.  As we follow this talk we see that Anne's heart is breaking or has broken--and all the while we see her skin as Francois does.  She wants to be touched, but not by him.  And then she allows him to touch her, but only in comforting gestures, redirecting his hands away from amorous intent.  And then she goes out with a man in whom she really has no interest.Such is life, one might say.  Rohmer certainly thinks so.One thing I love about Rohmer's films is that you cannot predict where they will go.  Another thing is his incredible attention to authentic detail about how people talk and how they feel without cliche and without any compromise with reality--Rohmer's reality of course, which I find is very much like the reality that I have experienced.See this for Eric Rohmer whose entre into the world of cinema is substantial, original, and wonderfully evocative of what it is like to live in the modern world with an emphasis on personal relationships and love.",4,Rohmer knows relationships,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,3166,"['bittersweet', 'tale', 'disconnections', 'possibilities', 'perhaps', 'have', 'essence', 'art', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'Rohmer', 'film', 'see', 'perhaps', 'ought', 'make', 'one', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'French', 'so', 'interestingly', 'talkative', 'one', 'Rohmer', 'trademarks', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'Rohmer.The', 'Aviator', 'wife', 'incidentally', 'not', 'appear', 'photograph', 'point', 'Everything', 'bit', 'off', 'stage', 'intriguing', 'drama', 'love', 'especially', 'bit', 'off', 'stage', 'yet', 'how', 'participants', 'yearn.Marie', 'Riviere', 'stars', 'Anne', 'who', 'love', 'aviator', 'catch', 'just', 'no', 'longer', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'so', 'must', 'return', 'Meanwhile', 'being', 'pestered', 'Francois', 'Philippe', 'Marlaud', 'who', 'love', 'However', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'clinging', 'Truly', 'not', 'interested', 'disconnection', 'as', 'far', 'concerned.The', 'heart', 'film', 'when', 'Francois', 'following', 'aviator', 'blond', 'woman', 'Francois', 'obsessive', 'jealous', ""n't"", 'clear', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'man', 'Anne', 'following', 'pretty', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Lucie', 'played', 'fetchingly', 'Anne-Laure', 'Meury', 'who', 'following', 'game', 'again', 'have', 'disconnection', 'fun', 'cute', 'full', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'see', 'Anne', 'Meanwhile', 'Anne', 'course', 'pining', 'aviator.Rohmer', 'intriguing', 'little', 'joke', 'aviator', 'wife', 'Who', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'right', 'woman', 'what', 'other', 'woman', 'never', 'really', 'her.Maire', 'Riviere', 'only', 'passably', 'pretty', 'gorgeous', 'limbs', 'beautiful', 'skin', 'hypnotic', 'way', 'Rohmer', 'next', 'last', 'scene', 'apartment', 'Francois', 'follow', 'talk', 'two', 'disconnection', 'center', 'possibilities', 'friends', 'lovers', 'whom', 'things', 'are', 'tantalizingly', 'not', 'exactly', 'right', 'yet', 'not', 'tragically', 'wrong', 'follow', 'talk', 'see', 'Anne', 'heart', 'breaking', 'broken', 'while', 'see', 'skin', 'Francois', 'be', 'touched', 'not', 'then', 'touch', 'only', 'comforting', 'gestures', 'redirecting', 'hands', 'away', 'amorous', 'intent', 'then', 'out', 'man', 'whom', 'really', 'interest.Such', 'life', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'Rohmer', 'certainly', 'so.One', 'thing', 'love', 'Rohmer', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'predict', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'thing', 'incredible', 'attention', 'authentic', 'detail', 'how', 'people', 'talk', 'how', 'feel', 'cliche', 'compromise', 'reality', 'Rohmer', 'reality', 'course', 'find', 'very', 'much', 'reality', 'have', 'experienced.See', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'entre', 'world', 'cinema', 'substantial', 'original', 'wonderfully', 'evocative', 'what', 'live', 'modern', 'world', 'emphasis', 'personal', 'relationships', 'love']",N/A

If you watch closely, you may come away wondering if the pilot is even married.We should also dispel a couple of other notions in the various reviews.  It is a French &quot;talkie.&quot;  I happen to like them.  It's not completely accurate to say it is about an obsession with an older woman.  There is obvious consideration of the younger one at a certain point.  It's certainly inaccurate to say the younger one represents the real possibility if one watches all the way to the end, past the aborted letter drop.  And by the way, look at that guy closely.  He is not a stranger.Anne does not agree with Lucie entirely that &quot;women decide.&quot;  It can't be said that these two women are educating Francois.  It can't be said that he loses either of them, actually.  Although, everyone who thinks they just must talk things through at the earliest opportunity would do well to see how he makes his life more difficult than it need be with this strategy.I think the movie really is about Anne, the pilot's girlfriend, whose picture appears on the cover.  She is the one who is despondent and ready to give up on relationships because she finds no one's feelings true and faithful.  And there is one further intriguing argument for this view.Eric Rohmer is noted for making cycles of movies... the comedies and proverbs, the four seasons, etc.  In each cycle, the movies are not related per se, not like a series.  But would it surprise anyone if this plotter of cycles hid a series among his cycles?  If he did so blatantly, it would be uncharacteristic of the always enigmatic Rohmer.  But what if he simply used the same actress, with a different character name, yet to represent the same character at different stages of life?Marie Riviere (Anne in this movie) appears to be just such a character.  As Delphine in &quot;Summer&quot; does she not begin where Anne leaves off, disenchanted with all relationships?  Finally healed by the magical Green Ray, she re-incarnates as Isabel in &quot;Autumn's Tale,&quot; as the master matchmaker peddling her happiness to others, even training an apprentiss of sorts.

Two young men at different times slip notes early morning under a young woman's door,one,Christian, to say he has to end their relationship as his wife is pregnant and is coming to live in Paris(the pilot and his wife of the title),the other,20 year old Francois,who is so much in love with her(Anne) he has arranged for a plumber to fix her leaky faucet.His nightshift means they rarely spend time together. Serious law student Philippe Marlaud fears the worst when he spots his girlfriend Marie Riviere leaving her apartment in the company of her ex, handsome pilot Mathieu Carriere. Intent on discovering the truth, Marlaud becomes an amateur sleuth, trailing the man around Paris.The titular wife only exists as a glimpse on a picture.However Francois trails the pilot and a blonde woman he takes to be his wife.In an episode that seems to have dropped out of Celine and Julie Go Boating, he meets up with a pert schoolgirl, Lucie,(Anne-Laure Meury)and she tags along or attaches herself to him, attracted but bemused by his actions,who offers to help in his ludicrous detection.She is a 15 year old schoolgirl taking a day off school.The improvisation of this amateurish private detective team is full of zany joy,bringing energy into the film.They find out Christian goes to visit a lawyer. Meury's sprightly self confidence engages the audience, contrasting with the heavily obsessed and jealous-natured Francois.The younger(Lucie) and the older woman(Anne) act like a balance of forces on Francois.Rohmer depicts the real pain and confusion and wasted attempts at happiness underlying the complicated intrigues of the characters.There is a huge gulf between fantasy and reality,feelings and words.Anne is an independent working girl 5 years older than the sensitive Francois. After Lucie departs, Francois visits a stress-inflicted Anne, it seems they reconcile and Francois figures out who the blonde is.Riviere plays a difficult role and dominates the screen during her expository declaration of self-reliance in her own small space. When the night falls, Anne is out for an exhausting date and Francois accidentally finds Lucie kiss another boy, so he sends a postcard to her and put a closure to their stalking adventure, the story ends.Outdoorsequences are shot in the Buttes Chaumant Park and the rainy streets of Paris with all the attendant natural street sounds coming through. The end has a song about Paris, sung by Arielle Dombasle, and is truly wonderful.",4,The impossibility of thinking about nothing,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,2594,"['Aviator', 'Wife', 'marked', 'beginning', 'new', 'series', 'Rohmer', 'films', 'be', 'entitled', 'Comedies', 'Proverbs', 'Two', 'young', 'men', 'different', 'times', 'slip', 'notes', 'early', 'morning', 'young', 'woman', 'door', 'one', 'Christian', 'say', 'end', 'relationship', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'coming', 'live', 'Paris', 'pilot', 'wife', 'title', 'other,20', 'year', 'old', 'Francois', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Anne', 'arranged', 'plumber', 'fix', 'leaky', 'faucet.His', 'nightshift', 'rarely', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'Serious', 'law', 'student', 'Philippe', 'Marlaud', 'worst', 'when', 'spots', 'girlfriend', 'Marie', 'Riviere', 'leaving', 'apartment', 'company', 'ex', 'handsome', 'pilot', 'Mathieu', 'Carriere', 'Intent', 'discovering', 'truth', 'Marlaud', 'amateur', 'sleuth', 'trailing', 'man', 'Paris.The', 'titular', 'wife', 'only', 'glimpse', 'picture.However', 'Francois', 'pilot', 'blonde', 'woman', 'be', 'wife.In', 'episode', 'have', 'dropped', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Go', 'Boating', 'up', 'pert', 'schoolgirl', 'Lucie', 'Anne-Laure', 'Meury', 'along', 'attracted', 'bemused', 'actions', 'who', 'help', 'ludicrous', 'detection.She', '15', 'year', 'old', 'schoolgirl', 'taking', 'day', 'school.The', 'improvisation', 'amateurish', 'private', 'detective', 'team', 'full', 'zany', 'joy', 'bringing', 'energy', 'film.They', 'find', 'out', 'Christian', 'visit', 'lawyer', 'Meury', 'sprightly', 'self', 'confidence', 'audience', 'contrasting', 'heavily', 'obsessed', 'jealous-natured', 'Francois.The', 'younger', 'Lucie', 'older', 'woman', 'Anne', 'act', 'balance', 'forces', 'Francois.Rohmer', 'real', 'pain', 'confusion', 'wasted', 'attempts', 'happiness', 'underlying', 'complicated', 'intrigues', 'characters.There', 'huge', 'gulf', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'feelings', 'words.Anne', 'independent', 'working', 'girl', '5', 'years', 'older', 'sensitive', 'Francois', 'Lucie', 'departs', 'Francois', 'stress-inflicted', 'Anne', 'reconcile', 'Francois', 'figures', 'out', 'who', 'blonde', 'is.Riviere', 'difficult', 'role', 'screen', 'expository', 'declaration', 'self-reliance', 'own', 'small', 'space', 'When', 'night', 'Anne', 'out', 'exhausting', 'date', 'Francois', 'accidentally', 'Lucie', 'kiss', 'boy', 'postcard', 'put', 'closure', 'stalking', 'adventure', 'story', 'ends.Outdoorsequences', 'are', 'shot', 'Buttes', 'Chaumant', 'Park', 'rainy', 'streets', 'Paris', 'attendant', 'natural', 'street', 'sounds', 'coming', 'end', 'song', 'Paris', 'sung', 'Arielle', 'Dombasle', 'truly', 'wonderful']",N/A
