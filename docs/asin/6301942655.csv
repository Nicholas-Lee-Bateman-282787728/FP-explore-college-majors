The most infamous may be director Dick Powell'sTHE CONQUERER(1956), in which 6' 4"" Duke portrays Genghis Khan, a Mongol warrior that was probably a full foot shorter vertically. Stupendous miscasting opposite Susan Hayward in Oriental eye makeup. This bomb is currently rated 3.3 (out of a possible 10) at IMDb.BIG JIM MCLAIN (1952) is another possible candidate for the Lingering Stink award. It was Wayne's first self-produced movie and it is winciningly bad at times. He's a HUAC invesigator looking for Commies in Hawaii. Duke does find some and also lands a wife, the now nearly-obscure Nancy Olson, who's best remembered as the script girl inSUNSET BLVD(1950) that catches William Holden's eye, thus making Gloria Swanson jealous.Duke Wayne was an unabashed flagwaver who gladly testified for the House Un-American Activities Committee on the Red Menace in Hollywood. Meanwhile Miss Olson was equally pro-Democrat, so the two were often arguing politics on the set. (BTW, she hated this film's script. Very prescient, in hindsight.)So when Wayne's not smashing evenly-tanned island Commies, he's wooing Nancy to the tune of ""The Hawaiian Wedding Song,"" later made famous by Andy Williams. Incidental music is provided by William Lava, composer of Disney's ""Zorro"" theme, also the title song to TV'sF TROOP!Duke's red-bustin' cohort here is James Arness, a man who towers over him and is dimensionally larger in every way. Gordon Jones, then playing Mike the Cop on theAbbott & Costello Showhas a great comic restaurant confrontation with Wayne, a scene obviously ""stolen,"" as other diners stop eating to watch the fun and laugh. These little moments, like Duke's amusing interactions with Veda Ann Borg, the brassy bleach-blonde big-mouthed GF of Jones, or a scene with Hans Conried as a coo-coo inventor, almost make ""Big Jim McLain"" a must-see, but too many times the story veers into lectures on the evils of Communism.So this is a product of its times, and since Wayne's new film company was footing the bill, it's heavily imbued with his politics.However, even with a 5.1 IMDb rating, Duke's fans still may want to see it.Available inTHE JOHN WAYNE FILM COLLECTION, a six-disc set of a half-dozen of his lesser-known pictures.It's a WARNER product, so transfer quality is fine. Each DVD includes a couple of short film extras.",3,Big Duke McWayne: card-carrying American!,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,2427,"['John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'other', 'actor', 'had', 'clunkers', 'too', 'most', 'infamous', 'may', 'be', 'director', 'Dick', ""Powell'sTHE"", 'CONQUERER', '1956', '6', '4', 'Duke', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Mongol', 'warrior', 'was', 'probably', 'full', 'foot', 'shorter', 'vertically', 'Stupendous', 'miscasting', 'opposite', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Oriental', 'eye', 'makeup', 'bomb', 'currently', 'rated', '3.3', 'possible', '10', 'IMDb.BIG', 'JIM', 'MCLAIN', '1952', 'possible', 'candidate', 'Lingering', 'Stink', 'award', 'was', 'Wayne', 'first', 'self-produced', 'movie', 'winciningly', 'bad', 'times', 'HUAC', 'invesigator', 'looking', 'Commies', 'Hawaii', 'Duke', 'find', 'also', 'wife', 'now', 'nearly-obscure', 'Nancy', 'Olson', 'who', 'best', 'remembered', 'script', 'girl', 'inSUNSET', 'BLVD', '1950', 'William', 'Holden', 'eye', 'thus', 'making', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'jealous.Duke', 'Wayne', 'was', 'unabashed', 'flagwaver', 'who', 'gladly', 'testified', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'Red', 'Menace', 'Hollywood', 'Meanwhile', 'Miss', 'Olson', 'was', 'equally', 'pro-Democrat', 'two', 'were', 'often', 'arguing', 'politics', 'set', 'BTW', 'hated', 'film', 'script', 'Very', 'prescient', 'hindsight', 'So', 'when', 'Wayne', 'not', 'smashing', 'evenly-tanned', 'island', 'Commies', 'wooing', 'Nancy', 'tune', 'Hawaiian', 'Wedding', 'Song', 'later', 'made', 'famous', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Incidental', 'music', 'provided', 'William', 'Lava', 'composer', 'Disney', 'Zorro', 'theme', 'also', 'title', 'song', ""TV'sF"", 'TROOP', 'Duke', 'red-bustin', 'cohort', 'here', 'James', 'Arness', 'man', 'who', 'dimensionally', 'larger', 'way', 'Gordon', 'Jones', 'then', 'playing', 'Mike', 'Cop', 'theAbbott', 'Costello', 'Showhas', 'great', 'comic', 'restaurant', 'confrontation', 'Wayne', 'scene', 'obviously', 'stolen', 'other', 'diners', 'stop', 'eating', 'watch', 'fun', 'laugh', 'little', 'moments', 'Duke', 'amusing', 'interactions', 'Veda', 'Ann', 'Borg', 'brassy', 'bleach-blonde', 'big-mouthed', 'GF', 'Jones', 'scene', 'Hans', 'Conried', 'coo-coo', 'inventor', 'almost', 'make', 'Big', 'Jim', 'McLain', 'must-see', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'veers', 'lectures', 'evils', 'Communism.So', 'product', 'times', 'Wayne', 'new', 'film', 'company', 'was', 'footing', 'bill', 'heavily', 'imbued', 'politics.However', 'even', '5.1', 'IMDb', 'rating', 'Duke', 'fans', 'still', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'it.Available', 'inTHE', 'JOHN', 'WAYNE', 'FILM', 'COLLECTION', 'six-disc', 'set', 'half-dozen', 'lesser-known', 'pictures.It', 'WARNER', 'product', 'so', 'transfer', 'quality', 'fine', 'DVD', 'couple', 'short', 'film', 'extras']",N/A

I don't have a whole lot of patience for unnecessary subtlety, but this film's treatment of Cold War threats has all the nuance of a sledgehammer.  ""Ludicrous"" is the word that comes immediately to mind on those rare occasions ""Big Jim"" enters the conversation.  Indeed, I always crack up when, at the end, the voice of Dan'l Webster inquires, ""Neighbor, how stands the Union now?"", and The Duke answers (indicating grinning and waving Marines), ""There stands the Union, Mr. Webster.  There stands our Union, sir.""  I of course realize that 59 years ago was a less cynical (and better) time than this.  Still, it's hard to believe that even 1952 eyes didn't roll at this exceptionally bombastic and self-satisfied claptrap.

I prefer to think of it as another John Wayne movie: part history lesson, part propaganda, part travelogue, part romance, all fun.  Even the opening credits are a hoot, each blown away by the storm raging behind them.  A clear signal that this wasn't supposed to be taken so seriously, after all, the piece was riddled with humor (I especially liked the Dragnet type narration and approach).  To those who have gotten a bit prickly about the subject matter, think of this as a period piece that bespeaks of an age and an attitude prevalent during that time.  It's a bit late in the day to be offended by the Un-American Activities Committee (it was, after all, abolished in 1975).Watch the movie for what it is: a faux police procedural.  Does it work as such or not?  I found it mildly interesting, the characters colorful (Hans Conried as nutcase, Batman's butler the bad guy).  There were tips to collect, people to question (most with ulterior motives), Nancy Olson to woo, a jealous boyfriend to fend off, and a free-for-all fistfight.

Gus's review is the funniest I have read here on Amazon.Numerous Facts now show that Senator McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee were CORRECT. In fact, it is not even arguable now.  I do not understand how people can be so detached from what has been going on in the past several years.Gus calls Pinko's and Communists,  ""a few courageous souls ...."", now that is funny .....if it were not for the fact these traitors wanted to chain and shackle us all to an international Nazi-type government.  While Gus and other Liberals would have gotten medals for their subversive activities (probably the benedict arnold medal) in overthrowing the USA;  I probably would have been shot for defending our country and the conservative principles for which it still stands.  Notice how Gus (and others like him) DESPISES any thing even remotely connected to McCarthy.  It is scary somewhat. But nothing hurts more than the truth.  Plus, McCarthy did a ""slam-dunk"" on ending the communist threat here in the USA. Only to be followed through (to its total demise) by another great patriot Ronald Reagan.Gus says, ""...the entire thing hinges upon the unbalanced fears of McCarthyists...""  Yeah, right, keep flogging that DEAD HORSE !!!If it were not for Ole Joe, I probably would not be here right now.Actually, this is a great movie: very good acting, very patriotic, good script.

Wayne makes sends shivers done your spine.  You do not see love for the USA like that anymore.

273742,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301942655,T O'Brien,"[7, 10]","Big Jim McLain is an interesting movie that is a result of the times it was made in, and that has to be considered when watching it.  John Wayne is Jim McLain, an agent for the Un-American Committee searching for communists living in the United States.  McLain, along with his partner Mal Baxter, are sent to Hawaii to find out who the Communist party leader there is as well as the ten secret party cells hiding out in the islands.  Also, McLain falls in love with a woman he meets during the course of his investigation.  This is a movie that is hard to explain; it needs to be seen to understand why.  It was made in 1952, which is evident throughout.  It might as well be a propaganda movie because of the stances taken, but don't get me wrong, that's why I'm recommending it.  Big Jim McLain is entertaining, campy fun that is sometimes unintentionally funny.  As well, the movie was filmed in Hawaii which looks gorgeous.  So for a very entertaining look at a different time in American culture, check out Big Jim McLain.In the title role, John Wayne plays government agent Jim McLain, a driven, dedicated man who stops at nothing in pursuit of his job.  But at the same time, he's frustrated that the people he's trying to get to are protected by the US government and Constitution.  Nancy Olson plays Nancy Vallon, a secretary who falls in love with McLain during his investigation and eventually get engaged.  Their relationship provide some of the movie's lighter moments and surprisingly works pretty well.  In one of his first bigger roles, James Arness plays Mal Baxter, McLain's partner who is as driven as Jim to stop communism because what happened to him fighting in Korea as a Marine.  Much of the rest of the cast is an ensemble who McLain and Baxter come across while searching for the Communist party members in Hawaii.  One that stands out is Veda Ann Borg as Madge, a woman who has involvement with the Communists and takes a liking to McLain.The recently released DVD, in conjunction with the Duke's 100th birthday, features a good-looking standard presentation in B & W, two Warner Bros. cartoons ""So You Want to Enjoy Life"" and ""The Super Snooper"", and a theatrical trailer.  So for an entertaining movie, if somewhat dated, but remember the time it was made, check out Big Jim McLain.  It's a different sort of movie for the Duke, but don't let that scare you.
