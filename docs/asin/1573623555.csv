On paper, this film's premise seems exciting, daring even, but on film Kicking and Screaming is simply another post-college drag. At an hour an a half this movies seems a semester long - as long as it takes the protagonist to realize he can't skip in time - whether backward or forward.

It always makes me laugh but it also succeeds in making the viewer experience sincere empathy and sympathy for its characters.  Anyone who went to college in the nineties can relate to these individuals at some level.  Furthermore, just in case you're wondering, its not a Whit Stillman film but many of the same actors are used such as Chris Eigeman.  Here we have a group of friends who have to be dragged kicking and screaming into adulthood.

189327,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,1573623555,Cubist,"[8, 10]","The early to mid-1990s was a great time for American independent cinema with the likes of Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, Whit Stillman, Noah Baumbach and many others gaining prominence through film festivals and home video. Like the aforementioned filmmakers, Baumbach's films are dialogue-heavy and character-driven, focusing on overeducated, unemployed Generation Xers trying to figure out what to do with their lives. Kicking and Screaming is about a group of friends who have just graduated from college and refuse to leave because they are still trying to figure out what to do next.Chris Eigeman and Carlos Jacott play well off each other with excellent comic timing as evident in the opening scene at a post-graduation party where Otis says or does something stupid and Max just gives him a withering glare that is priceless. Obviously, Baumbach also thought they worked well together as he teamed them up again in his next film Mr. Jealousy. Kicking and Screaming features a lot of laugh-out-loud one-liners (""There's food in the beer."") and funny conversations with Eigeman and Jacott delivering the bulk of them.While Kicking and Screaming is made up of a series of vignettes there is one subplot that runs throughout and that's the relationship between Grover and Jane. Even though they break-up as the film begins we see how they met and became a couple through a series of flashbacks. There is genuine warmth and affection on display in the flashbacks between the couple with nice chemistry between D'Abo and Hamilton that makes the movie a lament for their failed relationship.There is an interview with Noah Baumbach done in 2006. He talks about the genesis of the screenplay - based on experiences of him and his friends post-college living at home. Baumbach touches upon how this film got financed and the experience of making it.Also included are conversations between Baumbach and Chris Eigeman, Josh Hamilton and Carlos Jacott recorded in 2006. Baumbach had seen Eigeman in Barcelona and wanted him for the role of Max but figured he'd be too busy but, according to Eigeman, he was ""shockingly available.""""Conrad and Butler in `Conrad and Butler Take a Vacation'"" is a short film that stars Jacott and John Lehr from Kicking and Screaming as two Abbott and Costello types. Baumbach originally had hoped this would take off as a sitcom, a comedy album, etc. but it never happened and so this remains a curious oddity in the director's filmography.There are three deleted scenes with text introductions by Baumbach.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",4,"""There's food in the beer.""",1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,2573,"['early', 'mid-1990s', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'American', 'independent', 'cinema', 'likes', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Whit', 'Stillman', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'many', 'others', 'gaining', 'prominence', 'film', 'festivals', 'home', 'video', 'aforementioned', 'filmmakers', 'Baumbach', 'films', 'are', 'dialogue-heavy', 'character-driven', 'focusing', 'overeducated', 'unemployed', 'Generation', 'Xers', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'lives', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'refuse', 'leave', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'Eigeman', 'Carlos', 'Jacott', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'excellent', 'comic', 'timing', 'evident', 'opening', 'scene', 'post-graduation', 'party', 'where', 'Otis', 'something', 'stupid', 'Max', 'just', 'withering', 'glare', 'priceless', 'Obviously', 'Baumbach', 'also', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'teamed', 'up', 'again', 'next', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Jealousy', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'lot', 'laugh-out-loud', 'one-liners', 'food', 'beer', 'funny', 'conversations', 'Eigeman', 'Jacott', 'delivering', 'bulk', 'them.While', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'made', 'series', 'vignettes', 'one', 'subplot', 'relationship', 'Grover', 'Jane', 'Even', 'break-up', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'met', 'became', 'couple', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'affection', 'display', 'flashbacks', 'couple', 'nice', 'chemistry', ""D'Abo"", 'Hamilton', 'movie', 'lament', 'failed', 'relationship.There', 'interview', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'done', '2006', 'genesis', 'screenplay', 'based', 'experiences', 'friends', 'post-college', 'living', 'home', 'Baumbach', 'how', 'film', 'got', 'financed', 'experience', 'making', 'it.Also', 'included', 'are', 'conversations', 'Baumbach', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'Carlos', 'Jacott', 'recorded', '2006', 'Baumbach', 'had', 'seen', 'Eigeman', 'Barcelona', 'wanted', 'role', 'Max', 'figured', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'according', 'Eigeman', 'was', 'shockingly', 'available', 'Conrad', 'Butler', 'Conrad', 'Butler', 'Take', 'Vacation', 'short', 'film', 'Jacott', 'John', 'Lehr', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'two', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'types', 'Baumbach', 'originally', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'take', 'off', 'sitcom', 'comedy', 'album', 'etc', 'never', 'happened', 'so', 'curious', 'oddity', 'director', 'filmography.There', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'text', 'introductions', 'Baumbach.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
189328,APVNDUMOTRJ78,1573623555,E. Drake,"[2, 2]","I had never seen this movie prior to buying it. Therefore, as someone who did no ""grow up with this"" movie, I would like to note why I did go into this movie. First, I am a huge fan of Baumbach's two most recent films. Second, I am a sucker for any DVD stamped with the Criterion Collection. Third, its a Criterion movie under $20, nearly impossible for those Criterion fans who know.As for my thoughts, the movie is a wonderful snapshot of the lives of a group of people who have just finished college. I am confident, that many of you out there will have at least one friend who is or was similar to one of the characters in the film. This is a movie about the ""what the heck do we do next"" phase of our college careers. It depicts the general exhaustion after college as well as the fear.  It also openly admits what many of us want or wanted to admit at one point in time, that we really don't want to do anything or care to do anything (for that matter) after college.  The movie more or less ends on the next stage in one's college career, where that indifference to almost everything, slowly forms into an actual care for something. And so we finally begin...adulthood.A note to fellow reviewers, don't forget that this is a movie about a specific class/group of people going to a specific college, Vassar. Vassar is extremely expensive, extremely selective and is listed in the top 20 for admission rankings in the US. Apart from these facts, it is rather obvious, that the characters in this movie are privileged. As many are keen to write in their reviews, the characters are pretentious. Yes they are, but most important to note, is that the movie knows this, and it seems, so do the characters.I did not find the dialog to be as quotable as many have written, however I did enjoy a number of the conversations which only Baumbach can make feel so incredibly fragile, extremely warm and of course -human.For a slightly similar movie on more Young American East Coast Elite, I suggestMetropolitan - Criterion Collection",4,Baumbach's First  Great,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,2029,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'prior', 'buying', 'Therefore', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'why', 'did', 'go', 'movie', 'First', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Baumbach', 'two', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'Second', 'am', 'sucker', 'DVD', 'stamped', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Third', 'Criterion', 'movie', '20', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'Criterion', 'fans', 'who', 'know.As', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'snapshot', 'lives', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'college', 'am', 'confident', 'many', 'there', 'will', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'similar', 'one', 'characters', 'film', 'movie', 'what', 'heck', 'do', 'do', 'next', 'phase', 'college', 'careers', 'general', 'exhaustion', 'college', 'as', 'well', 'fear', 'also', 'openly', 'what', 'many', 'want', 'wanted', 'admit', 'one', 'point', 'time', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'anything', 'care', 'do', 'anything', 'matter', 'college', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'ends', 'next', 'stage', 'one', 'college', 'career', 'where', 'indifference', 'almost', 'everything', 'slowly', 'actual', 'care', 'something', 'so', 'finally', 'begin', 'adulthood.A', 'note', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'movie', 'specific', 'class/group', 'people', 'going', 'specific', 'college', 'Vassar', 'Vassar', 'extremely', 'expensive', 'extremely', 'selective', 'listed', 'top', '20', 'admission', 'rankings', 'US', 'Apart', 'facts', 'rather', 'obvious', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'privileged', 'many', 'are', 'keen', 'write', 'reviews', 'characters', 'are', 'pretentious', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'note', 'movie', 'so', 'do', 'characters.I', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'dialog', 'be', 'as', 'quotable', 'many', 'have', 'written', 'however', 'did', 'enjoy', 'number', 'conversations', 'only', 'Baumbach', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'so', 'incredibly', 'fragile', 'extremely', 'warm', 'course', '-human.For', 'slightly', 'similar', 'movie', 'more', 'Young', 'American', 'East', 'Coast', 'Elite', 'suggestMetropolitan', 'Criterion', 'Collection']",N/A

Great performances, great writing.  I particularly like the scene with Chris Eigeman in the bar, saying, &quot;Look at these [bleeping] people.&quot;  And the ending is a masterstroke.  Heartbreaking, but perhaps that's the point: youth will go and in the end the best you may have is a wonderful, nostalgic memory.They tried to make a film addressing post-graduate angst when I was in college.  It was called &quot;St. Elmo's Fire&quot; and it was truly one of the worst things ever put on screen.  Max, look at Demi Moore, Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez and ponder how such dark forces could gather together and create such a pretentious, self indulgent mess of a movie and get people to see it.  There were actually a couple of people I went to school with that took that movie quite seriously; formed dialogues over it, etc.  The way to handle them was to nod as if you took them seriously and get them to continue to embarrass themselves.The point is, while the theme or idea may not be anything new, what matters is the writing, the performances and the presentation.  &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; is honest and human while &quot;St. Elmo's&quot; was (at that time) star-studded, cynical and pandering and ultimately very stupid.I recommend people buy a copy of &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot;.

Eigerman realized that his fellow actor Carlos Jacot (as fellow housemate Otis) was stealing the film, and was glad about it: kind of emphasizes how much of a group effort this is, rather like 12 Angry Men or somethingGrover is the main character, we get more insight into his life than the others, but the others do hold their own. Little bits slip out: Otis's brother with the mail fraud, himself caught looking at porn by his mom (he defers grad school rather than move to a different time zone); Max is completely bored and continuing his life as before. Chet has a kid and seems to be content with his life as it happens now, as he sees himself as a student. PerpetualThe girls seem more focused than the guys, at least they're doing things (studying, working)Originally titled Fifth Year (one of the dvd bonus features has the script for the film being touched on) this is a heartbreaking portrait of a stalled break out plan. The film begins with a graduation.. and thats it! No action after that, save to go on to the old bars (""Hitting the Penguin!"")Poor Skippy makes enough money from the summer job so he can take classes (Grover and Max spot him on campus, but he can't talk, gotta run!)Grover is still wounded by his ex, whos seemed to have left him for Prague..This is a very subtle film, and repays several viewings. Elliot Gould (Grovers divorced dad) comments to his son: ""Why aren't you with her?"" and Grover has no reply.Little things like that you may not pick up on first viewing, and really rub the salt into the wound..Basically, you know the characters, and heaven help you if you're a college grad whos in the same boat (jobless, out of money, totally screwed - with the best job behind them is driving a milk truck!)This film really cuts deep if you're of a similar age, or experience, because the characters are really true to lifeAs I said, its an ensemble case.That being said though, Otis has some great lines!Maybe Fifth Year would've been a more apt titleSoundtrack includes tunes by Nick Drake (Time of no reply) & Freedy Johnston (Bad reputation). Spot the director Baumbach as the fellow asking Skippy as hes moving in to his dorm whether he'd do his mother or a cowPainful beyond belief. And one of the best films ever made. If you can connect to it, you'll watch it time and again.

Koehler,"[6, 7]","During one particularly illuminating sequence of Kicking and Screaming, Grover (Josh Hamilton) has to watch as his short story is critiqued in class. ""It's beautifully written,"" says someone who will shortly become very close to him. ""However, I've noticed that characters in Grover's stories spend all their time discussing the least important things, like what to have for dinner or the best-looking model in the Victoria's Secret catalog. I see nothing wrong with dealing with the important subject matter.""Many people level the same accusation against this gem of Gen-X ennui, so easy to underestimate with all the throwaway conversation about Traci Austin, Bud Bowl II, and movies starring monkeys. It's a little picture, little meaning it has a small budget and no one gets cancer or anything. ""I'm a little guy,"" says Otis (Carlos Jacott as one of the film's more memorable characters). ""I can't do all the things the big guys do."" A friend offers a small measure of comfort: ""What are you talking about, you're like a monster, you're huge."" Don't underestimate yourself, Otis, for however ""little"" it may be, Kicking and Screaming is really about the biggest things there are: our dreams in a lonely, chaotic world where we think we know God, only to find He's not so much dead as just not answering the phone.At the center of the picture are four college friends for whom graduation is a form of birth trauma; they stare into the real world abyss that awaits (and the abyss most certainly stares back). Grover's girlfriend Jane (Olivia d'Abo) has ruined his post-commencement plans by joining a writing program in Prague. ""How will that work if you're living with me in Brooklyn?"" he asks. ""It will be the same, except I'll be in Prague."" Otis is moving to Milwaukee, where he'll continue his education and live with his mother. Skippy (Jason Wiles) has no concrete plans other than to read all the great short novels. Chris Eigeman, playing the curmudgeon intellectual he has made an indie film career out of (see: all of Whit Stillman's pictures), says it best: ""Eight hours ago, I was Max Belmont, English major, college senior. Now, I am Max Belmont who does nothing. All of my accomplishments are in the past."" Yes, school has prepared them for nothing, but now they have a thousand ways of expressing it.Taking a cue from perpetual student Chet (Eric Stoltz as the kind of individual who paraphrases himself), they collectively decide to ""postpone that get-started year"" by renting a house on campus and continuing to live life much as they had before graduation (but without the grades). The rhythms of college are quickly reinstituted as Otis and Chet start a book club, Max eats at the cafeteria, Skippy audits classes, and Grover hits the campus bars with an eye for ""freshman betties"" whose sexual congress he hopes will cleanse him of any unresolved feelings about Jane. They all meet where Chet tends bar to rationalize life's absurdities and prove their intellectual worth with trivia.Writer/director Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) instills in each of his characters juvenile affectations consistent with a desire to climb back in the womb (most notably Otis and his pajama tops worn as formalwear). It's worth reminding that they all have childish, even pet-like names (Grover has the added bonus of the phonetic ""grow"" in it); despite superficially ""mature"" traits like blazer-wearing, cigarette-smoking, and scotch-drinking, they're unable or unwilling to take care of themselves outside the collegiate cocoon. The world does not run by the rules they know, if it has any rules at all - even their games of trivia have become so contextually incestuous that they are entertaining only to themselves.The crux of everything is Grover's deteriorating relationship with Jane, juxtaposed as it is with its genesis. When they make that first connection, it's strange for Grover to think they'd gone four years on the same campus without meeting, ""catching the same colds and being bit by the same mosquitoes."" We like to think of love being a uniquely spiritual entity, a product of fate - that there is a special someone we have to be with. Grover is so grasping for design in his solipsistic existence that he interprets divinity in something as mundane as a flight attendant fidgeting with a model airplane. But as he soon finds out, perhaps these things are instead a product of chance, controlled by circumstance and nothing else; that there is no meaning in things other than the meanings we give them. The love we feel doesn't necessarily last forever; a deigned future does not exist, no matter how entitled to it we may feel. All that we can be sure of is the moment of now.How do you make God laugh? begins Chet's favorite joke. Make a plan.Interesting footnote: Olivia d'Abo (Jane) is probably known to most as Karen Arnold from the hit television show The Wonder Years. She is also jarringly British, if you've ever heard her give an interview. One of her first motion picture performances was in the Bo Derek film Bolero, where she controversially appeared nude. D'Abo herself claims she was born in 1971, which would have made her thirteen at the time of that picture's release.",5,graduation as reliving birth trauma,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,5221,"['one',

189333,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,1573623555,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 12]","Having recently reviewed ""The Squid and the Whale,"" Noah Baumbach's brilliant and literate divorce comedy (what I contend is 2005's Best Screenplay), I decided to take another look at his first picture, ""Kicking And Screaming.""  ""Kicking and Screaming"" is a 1995 comedy targeting recent college graduates and their hesitation about setting foot in the real world.  Representing an age demographic similar to mine, ""Kicking"" is an eminently quotable (but not entirely believable) gem of a screenplay delivered with great conviction by a talented and attractive cast.Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.  While I realize many people see this as a spot-on portrait of a generation in flux, I found much of ""Kicking"" only marginally realistic.  (Don't get excited yet, this is a good review.)  I clearly identified with how close this group of kids had become.  The cadence of their speech, the way they understand one another, the sharing of ritualistic games and jokes--this is all handled superbly.  To paraphrase some remarks of peripheral characters throughout the film--these guys all sound the same, what are they--in love?  Having developed the same type of symbiotic relationships within my college ""group,"" I found this quite amusing.  However, I do find the film slightly disingenous about life after graduation.  The characters of ""Kicking"" remain at school, don't work (except one as a clerk in a video store) and are left to their own devices for a year with little explanation.  Seems to me that within a group of kids this smart, at least one character would have pursued (or been forced to) accept a job or some responsibility.That point mentioned, ""Kicking and Screaming"" is a highly entertaining and funny examination of post-graduate ennui.  Baumbach's screenplay boasts lots of memorable dialogue, lots of cleverness you might find yourself ""borrowing.""  Without this script, many of these characters might have come across as insufferable.  Nice work by the leads--Josh Hamilton, Chris Eigeman and Carlos Jacott--further draw you into this offbeat tale.  Indie favorites Parker Posey and Eric Stoltz (as a philosopher bartender/perennial student) are also noteworthy.There isn't much more I can say.  ""Kicking and Screaming"" is beloved in the lexicon of this type of film.  But while it is enjoyable (I've seen it many time through the years), I don't think it is quite the ""classic"" some make it out to be.  Clever and fun, if you identify with the characters in ""Kicking""--it's a hoot.  If you don't, however, they may just annoy you as spoiled self-involved brats.  But as I am a self-proclaimed brat, I embraced this movie because ""I like a bartender that drinks.""

Too bad, even if she's disliked(?) as a person I think she was great in this film, as well as many other roles.  There's a lot of layering to this film if you look for it (past the central characters in any shot, for example).

I was searching for his second feature, Mr. Jealousy (incidently on order), when I saw that Criterion had released a new edition of his cult favorite Kicking and Screaming. It's a film I saw when it was originally released and immediately identified with. I think it is a common rite of passage for liberal arts majors to spend sometime after graduation spinning their wheels as they try to decide what to do with their lives, which is basically what this film is about. The details of these four characters who are in arrested development mirrors that of my post graduate roommates and myself. I think it is the start of a process in which your naive illusions of life are lost or shattered.As it should be I suppose, Baumbach is my contemporary, born in 1969, and directing his first movie before I even got my MA. My friends and I had a similarly rented an old house near the university with, I swear, the same books on the shelf (As I Lay Dying, Conrad, etc...).

I'd like to think that we were as witty as these characters were (previous lines excepted)-there are a lot of great lines, which is one of the reason this has become a cult classic I suppose, and I think that's true of The Squid and the Whale too. Consider these: ""I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday."" / ""Oh, I have been to Prague."" / If Plato is a a fine red wine , then Aristotle is a dry martini."" / ""I like a bartender who drinks"". It also stars some of my favorite indie actors like Chris Eigeman (a Whit Stilman regular who was in Metropolitan, Barcelona, and The Last Days of Disco), the lovely Parker Posey (Ryan Adams's current squeeze and indie film queen-what hasn't she been in from Hal Hartley movies to Richard Linklater films), and the always reliable Eric Stoltz. The leads Josh Hamilton and Olivia D'Abo were well cast and had good chemistry as well. In fact D'Abo's Jane, who wore a retainer, reminded me of a college friend Jennifer, who had braces, a similar hairstyle, and was equally smart enough to end up as a college history professor. I also see the seeds for The Squid and the Whale in the messy divorce of Grover's (Josh Hamilton) parents, of which the father was played by Elliott Gould.",5,Post Modern post College Comedy,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,2486,"['been', 'lot', 'talk', 'recently', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'given', 'praise', 'received', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'was', 'searching', 'second', 'feature', 'Mr.', 'Jealousy', 'incidently', 'order', 'when', 'saw', 'Criterion', 'had', 'released', 'new', 'edition', 'cult', 'favorite', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'film', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'immediately', 'identified', 'think', 'common', 'rite', 'passage', 'liberal', 'arts', 'majors', 'spend', 'sometime', 'graduation', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'try', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'lives', 'basically', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'details', 'four', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'arrested', 'development', 'mirrors', 'post', 'graduate', 'roommates', 'think', 'start', 'process', 'naive', 'illusions', 'life', 'are', 'lost', 'shattered.As', 'should', 'be', 'suppose', 'Baumbach', 'contemporary', 'born', '1969', 'directing', 'first', 'movie', 'even', 'got', 'MA', 'friends', 'had', 'similarly', 'rented', 'old', 'house', 'university', 'swear', 'same', 'books', 'shelf', 'Lay', 'Dying', 'Conrad', 'etc', 'Furthermore', 'had', 'same', 'ridiculous', 'conversations', 'consider', 'Who', 'would', 'rather', 'do', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'Lucy', 'Who', 'would', 'rather', 'do', 'Sally', 'Jesse', 'Raphael', 'Oprah', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'were', 'as', 'witty', 'characters', 'were', 'previous', 'lines', 'excepted', 'are', 'lot', 'great', 'lines', 'one', 'reason', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'suppose', 'think', 'true', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'too', 'Consider', ""'m"", 'nostalgic', 'conversations', 'had', 'yesterday', 'Oh', 'have', 'been', 'Prague', '/', 'Plato', 'fine', 'red', 'wine', 'then', 'Aristotle', 'dry', 'martini', 'like', 'bartender', 'who', 'also', 'favorite', 'indie', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', 'Whit', 'Stilman', 'regular', 'who', 'was', 'Metropolitan', 'Barcelona', 'Last', 'Days', 'Disco', 'lovely', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Ryan', 'Adams', 'current', 'squeeze', 'indie', 'film', 'queen-what', ""n't"", 'been', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'movies', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'films', 'always', 'reliable', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'leads', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'Olivia', ""D'Abo"", 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'as', 'well', 'fact', ""D'Abo"", 'Jane', 'who', 'wore', 'retainer', 'reminded', 'college', 'friend', 'Jennifer', 'who', 'had', 'braces', 'similar', 'hairstyle', 'was', 'equally', 'smart', 'enough', 'end', 'up', 'college', 'history', 'professor', 'also', 'see', 'seeds', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'messy', 'divorce', 'Grover', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'parents', 'father', 'was', 'played', 'Elliott', 'Gould']",N/A

189346,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,1573623555,Seamus,"[4, 6]","I applaud the effort of Noah Baumbach for making this movie.  On the surface, it might look like ""just another college film"" about a group of recent college grads who are trying to find direction in life, but this movie has more in common with classic indie films than it does ""St. Elmo's Fire.""The basic plot is that a group of 4 college buddies have just finished school and they're all going no place fast.  You have Max, the cynical one, who is verbally abusive to his friends.  Otis is the neurotic one who can barely dress himself.  Skippy is the long-haired guy who just wants to stay in school.  And Grover is the main character, a young writer who's girlfriend leaves for Prague, ruining all his plans for post-graduation.In the first part of the movie you see a bunch of recent grads who are afraid to go out into the world, and something rings true about each of the characters.  At times, they'll probably remind you of yourself or your old friends.Still, I don't think it deserves all the credit that some people give it.  In the end there is not much realism to the movie.  The characters here just don't talk like real people.  They don't dress like real people.  You have a cast of characters in their early 20s who all talk like they're reading a script.  It's hard to care about any one in the film because you never learn about them.",4,"I applaud the effort, but",1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,1352,"['applaud', 'effort', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'making', 'movie', 'surface', 'might', 'look', 'just', 'college', 'film', 'group', 'recent', 'college', 'grads', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'direction', 'life', 'movie', 'more', 'common', 'classic', 'indie', 'films', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'basic', 'plot', 'group', '4', 'college', 'buddies', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'school', ""'re"", 'going', 'place', 'fast', 'have', 'Max', 'cynical', 'one', 'who', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'friends', 'Otis', 'neurotic', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'dress', 'Skippy', 'long-haired', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'stay', 'school', 'Grover', 'main', 'character', 'young', 'writer', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'Prague', 'ruining', 'plans', 'post-graduation.In', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'see', 'bunch', 'recent', 'grads', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'something', 'rings', 'true', 'characters', 'times', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'remind', 'old', 'friends.Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'credit', 'people', 'give', 'end', 'not', 'much', 'realism', 'movie', 'characters', 'here', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'real', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'dress', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'cast', 'characters', 'early', '20s', 'who', 'talk', ""'re"", 'reading', 'script', 'hard', 'care', 'one', 'film', 'never', 'learn']",N/A

I had films like Miller's Crossing,  Goodfellas, Bottle Rocket, Big Lebowski and Jackie Brown but this film also  had to be there. I have taken a little flack for it from a few people I  know, but this film is just such a favorite of mine. The first time I saw  it was on video when it first came out and I watched it three times. I have  since seen it many, many more times and enjoy it more and more with each  viewing. It has become one of those touchstones for me an my close friends.  It is just so well written and performed by all involved. Otis(Carlos  Jacott) is one of my favorite film characters(along with Owen Wilson's  Dignan, Walter Matthau's Henry Graham, Jack Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, Robert De  Niro's Rupert Pupkin and Kurt Russell's Jack Burton). I have found so few  films that can hold up to repeat viewings the way this does. It has a few  amateurish things about it, but when it's funny and engaging-it's dead on  perfect. It is so much better than so many other twentysomething slacker  type indie films-there's this film and then all the rest. Watch it, show  your friends, quote it-it's remarkable.
