The movie was ok, not great, but I think perhaps the writers had a slightly better game plan in mind originally and unfortunately a few things were cut -- uh, for timing and pacing -- to get the film's running length back into more traditional Disney time frames (somewhere around the 90 minute mark is typical for family movies).  As is, the film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes which tends to be a long time to get young ones to sit tight and watch a complete movie.Give credit to Disney for including a ton of extras and bonus materials on the disc.  While I'd personally prefer disc prices to remain around the $20 and under mark, I do appreciate added value where I can get it, and Disney typically delivers the extras on their releases (with a few exceptions).4 stars for family viewing.  2 stars for older and less patient viewers who'd be better off looking elsewhere for their entertainment.  Go in with the right spirit and attitude and enjoy the film.  Do take the time to check out the deleted scenes.  A few of them really do help make the movie better. :-)",4,"Contrived, but still enjoyable...

I cannot say it was a total waste, even if I gave is a D (it was a high D) and will never feel the need to watch this again.  It could have been worse (in fact, I really thought it was going to be).For the whole `fun for the whole family' vibe, this has it in spades.  There is nothing objectionable here (at least not anything overly) and I'm happy about that.  I believe that there should be more family friendly films out there.  My issue comes from the fact that all too often family friendly means generic, predictable and clich&eacute;d; which as I just mentioned this film is.  There isn't one gag here that feels fresh (every fall, spill or scream has been played to death in just about every other family friendly film) and there isn't one aspect of the storyline that is remotely clever.Man-boy football star Joe Kingman is in love with himself.  He gets a knock at the door to reveal he has a daughter he didn't know about.  He suddenly has to grow up and take care of her only to realize that she is the best thing that has ever happened to her.Insert tears.That's all she wrote, which is really sad since Dwayne Johnson is surprisingly capable of doing much more.  He's that actor who shouldn't be an actor but is remarkably well at being an actor; you know, the completely baffling `who would have guessed it' kind of guy.  He has so much likable charm and comedic timing, and he oozes chemistry with whoever shares the screen with him.  I can't believe I'm saying this about `The Rock', but really, this guy can act and should be given much better roles.He's no Vin Diesel, he's actually talented.If it weren't for Dwayne's handling of the material I probably would have turned the film off.  I actually did once, and then I read a review that said I should keep watching, so I turned it back on.  The thing is, I don't see a point to this film.  I just said this very same thing when reviewing `Fools Gold', the only difference being that this movie at least has some charming performances (even if that Madison Pettis girl is beyond annoying and obnoxious) and Roselyn Sanchez is STUNNING, much better looking than the combined mediocrity that is Kate Hudson and Matthew `abs' McConaughey.  Still, there is no reason to have made or to really watch this movie, since it's been done to death a million times before this one.That is all she wrote.It's a likable yet forgettable yarn that is only justified by Roselyn's leotards and that boastful smile `The Rock' flashes with enough likable infectiousness to make his character simply adorable.",2,If only it could have sported a little originality...,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,2668,"['Ok', 'generic', 'predictable', 'completely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'was', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'even', 'gave', 'D', 'was', 'high', 'D', 'will', 'never', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'again', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'fact', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'whole', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'vibe', 'spades', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'here', 'least', 'not', 'anything', 'overly', ""'m"", 'happy', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'My', 'issue', 'fact', 'too', 'often', 'family', 'friendly', 'generic', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'just', 'mentioned', 'film', ""n't"", 'one', 'gag', 'here', 'feels', 'fresh', 'fall', 'spill', 'scream', 'been', 'played', 'death', 'just', 'other', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', ""n't"", 'one', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'remotely', 'clever.Man-boy', 'football', 'star', 'Joe', 'Kingman', 'love', 'knock', 'door', 'reveal', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'suddenly', 'grow', 'up', 'take', 'care', 'only', 'realize', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'her.Insert', 'tears.That', 'wrote', 'really', 'sad', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'surprisingly', 'capable', 'doing', 'much', 'more', 'actor', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'actor', 'remarkably', 'well', 'being', 'actor', 'know', 'completely', 'baffling', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'kind', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'likable', 'charm', 'comedic', 'timing', 'chemistry', 'whoever', 'shares', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Rock', 'really', 'guy', 'can', 'act', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'much', 'better', 'roles.He', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'actually', 'talented.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'Dwayne', 'handling', 'material', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'film', 'actually', 'did', 'once', 'then', 'read', 'review', 'said', 'should', 'keep', 'watching', 'turned', 'back', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'film', 'just', 'said', 'very', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'reviewing', 'Fools', 'Gold', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'movie', 'least', 'charming', 'performances', 'even', 'Madison', 'Pettis', 'girl', 'annoying', 'obnoxious', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'STUNNING', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'combined', 'mediocrity', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Matthew', 'abs', 'McConaughey', 'Still', 'reason', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'watch', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'million', 'times', 'one.That', 'wrote.It', 'likable', 'yet', 'forgettable', 'yarn', 'only', 'justified', 'Roselyn', 'leotards', 'boastful', 'smile', 'Rock', 'flashes', 'enough', 'likable', 'infectiousness', 'make', 'character', 'simply', 'adorable']",N/A

Likewise, Roselyn Sanchez does a tremendous job in her role as ballet-instructor Monique Vasquez. Her real-life dance-training is showcased in a poignant performance with Johnson and the children (this is one of the more enchanting scenes in the film ... it is guaranteed maintain your attention).Disney does a spectacular service to dancers and athletes alike. Quick-cuts between the football field and the ballet studio illustrate the rigors and grace of both. It shows how the two are not entirely dissimilar. This moment is well-crafted! And, yes, I know this has become a somewhat hackneyed trope, but a child will not view it as such.Now, the character of Peyton Kelly (played by nine-year-old Madison Pettis) may prove a little jarring. While Pettis' acting is respectable, the writing for her character feels a little ""off."" While her ""sassiness"" can occasionally translate as amusing, it can too often seem acrid (such as when she launches into the ""tone-deaf"" bit after the potentially ""tear-jerking"" ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" serenade). This becomes softer as the film progresses (or the audience simply becomes acclimated to her impudence) and it is certainly not jolting enough to prohibit viewing.Most of the critical reviewers have panned this work (and I really do mean ""most""). Yes, it is painfully formulaic (you can predict the entire film in the first fifteen minutes ... but what do you expect from a Disney film). Yes, the writing for Pettis' character is insulting (not all children are jaded and rude). Yes, portraying football players as ""dumb"" (especially in the case of Hayes MacArthur's character, Kyle Cooper) is both trite and unfair. Yes, it is another film with an Elvis soundtrack (we all saw ""Lilo and Stitch""). And, yes, that Disney cannot manage to create a film without references to ""bodily functions"" is disappointing. BUT, ""The Game Plan"" does have moments of great tenderness: this is especially evident in Morris Chestnut's character of Travis Sanders. Sanders is both an athlete and a family-man. Throughout the film, he remains a strong example of a man who is both a gifted player and a devoted dad. (And, yes, maybe that's trite too, but it is also a much needed reminder).While critics may not recommend this work, I believe that both parents and children will find it worthy of their time. One is hesitant to use such a word, but here it is ... the film is ... cute.

1119784,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000YGGNLK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","This isn't a new premise, of course, the one about men (or women) whose lives are upended when they're unexpectedly saddled with a kid. Off the top of my head, I'd seen this particular plot in films likeThe Bad News Bears,Three Men and a Baby,Big Daddy,Raising Helen (Widescreen Edition),A Simple Twist of Fate,Six Pack, andBaby Boom. When done right, it's a pretty rewarding premise. Disney's newest family picture, THE GAME PLAN, does it right.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Joe Kingman, a tough-as-nails but self-absorbed NFL superstar quarterback and the sporting toast of Boston. All is gravy-breezy for Joe as he relishes his bachelor lifestyle, the riches, and fame. But then his world is rocked by the out-of-the-blue arrival of Peyton (Madison Pettis), an 8-year-old daughter he never knew he had. With the decision made to have Peyton temporarily stay with him but with lucrative endorsements enticingly on the horizon, Joe's hardnosed agent Stella (Kyra Sedgwick) urges him to keep the news of his fatherhood a secret for now.This results in the sophisticated-for-a-durn-kid Peyton extorting ballet classes out of Joe. The ballet teacher is played by lovely actress Roselyn Sanchez, who doesn't recognize Joe and talks him into not only participating in ballet class but also being part of an upcoming play, in which he'll play a tree. With his team the Boston Rebels hard charging towards a championship season, Joe finds himself juggling fatherhood with his gridiron profession and straying from his erstwhile carefree lifestyle. How will it turn out? (hint: this is a Disney film).Yessir, THE GAME PLAN trots out a predictable story. But it's a lot of fun, and that trumps all the cliches. The Rock in a cute movie? Absolutely true. I just got back from a special screening of this film and it proved to be the perfect solution to a rain-plagued Saturday night. This is the Rock's first collaboration with Disney and it's a touchdown (feel free to groan). And, what's more, he's got another Disney film in the works (WITCH MOUNTAIN, reteaming him with THE GAME PLAN director Andy Fickman).The Rock is the featured star but he gets capable assists from a willing supporting cast boasting the likes of Kyra Sedgwick, Morris Chestnut, and Roselyn Sanchez. Madison Pettis is a natural talent and shines as the very smart, classical music-inclined Peyton, deftly handling her wealth of lines and managing to avoid the child actor landmine of being coy and sickeningly cute.But, make no mistake, it's Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's natural charisma which makes it all work. Whether he belongs with a serious script is yet undetermined, although he did very well in GRIDIRON GANG. But it's in the comedy or comedy-action films that he's speedily reached a comfort level. To me, a key is that, while he seems to take his cinematic career seriously, he's not averse to poking fun at his image, much in the mold of Arnold inKindergarten CopandTwins. This trait is never more in the spotlight than in this film as he suffers the ignominy of having his daughter dress up his dog Spike in a tutu and even poisoning him with a cookie (""Thinammon? I'm allergic to thinammon!""). One of the funniest moments in the film, by the way, happens during the allergy sequence as Joe attempts to press on with his television spot promos (""Boston Rebels - expewience tha heat!"").Too, the Rock takes advantage of Joe's quirky combination of fastidiousness and machismo to mine laughter from the audience. On one hand, he listens to Elvis and is a neat freak (he doesn't like fingerprints on his fridge). On the other hand, God help you if you don't use napkins and coasters in his crib. And to further punctuate his cluelessness with the state of fatherhood, he relates to Peyton in terms of football playcalling and acts much like a baby himself. The Rock is a natural at all this, handling the comedy elements with ease and dexterity. His athleticism and sheer physical presence are always assets, but, coming in particularly handy for this film is his football background - he was a defensive tackle on the 1991 NCAA football champs, the Miami Hurricanes. For his acting craft, he did suffer a ruptured Achilles tendon (a fairly common sports injury) during the filming of this picture. How's that for method acting?The Rock has moved past the flavor of the month and firmly into the category of a leading action star who's here to stay. I'm not exactly sure how his next project'll work out (I did like the original ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN), but I hear that SHAZAM! is around the corner. But all that's in the future. For now, THE GAME PLAN is here and I expect it'll carve hefty inroads into the box office receipts. So, yes, definitely, go check this one out. You probably won't see the Rock lisp again in cinema.",5,"""Welcome to the magical world of ponies...""",1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,4805,"[""n't"", 'new', 'premise', 'course', 'one', 'men', 'women', 'lives', 'are', 'upended', 'when', ""'re"", 'unexpectedly', 'saddled', 'kid', 'top', 'head', ""'d"", 'seen', 'particular', 'plot', 'films', 'likeThe', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Raising', 'Helen', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'A', 'Simple', 'Twist', 'Fate', 'Six', 'Pack', 'andBaby', 'Boom', 'When', 'done', 'right', 'pretty', 'rewarding', 'premise', 'Disney', 'newest', 'family', 'picture', 'GAME', 'PLAN', 'right.Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'Joe', 'Kingman', 'tough-as-nails', 'self-absorbed', 'NFL', 'superstar', 'quarterback', 'sporting', 'toast', 'Boston', 'gravy-breezy', 'Joe', 'bachelor', 'lifestyle', 'riches', 'fame', 'then', 'world', 'rocked', 'out-of-the-blue', 'arrival', 'Peyton', 'Madison', 'Pettis', '8-year-old', 'daughter', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'decision', 'made', 'have', 'Peyton', 'temporarily', 'stay', 'lucrative', 'endorsements', 'enticingly', 'horizon', 'Joe', 'hardnosed', 'agent', 'Stella', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'keep', 'news', 'fatherhood', 'secret', 'now.This', 'results', 'sophisticated-for-a-durn-kid', 'Peyton', 'extorting', 'ballet', 'Joe', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'played', 'lovely', 'actress', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'who', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Joe', 'talks', 'not', 'only', 'participating', 'ballet', 'class', 'also', 'being', 'part', 'upcoming', 'play', ""'ll"", 'play', 'tree', 'team', 'Boston', 'Rebels', 'hard', 'charging', 'towards', 'championship', 'season', 'Joe', 'juggling', 'fatherhood', 'gridiron', 'profession', 'straying', 'erstwhile', 'carefree', 'lifestyle', 'How', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'hint', 'Disney', 'film', '.Yessir', 'GAME', 'PLAN', 'out', 'predictable', 'story', 'lot', 'fun', 'trumps', 'cliches', 'Rock', 'cute', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'true', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'special', 'screening', 'film', 'proved', 'be', 'perfect', 'solution', 'rain-plagued', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Rock', 'first', 'collaboration', 'Disney', 'touchdown', 'feel', 'free', 'groan', 'what', 'more', 'got', 'Disney', 'film', 'works', 'WITCH', 'MOUNTAIN', 'reteaming', 'THE', 'GAME', 'PLAN', 'director', 'Andy', 'Fickman', '.The', 'Rock', 'featured', 'star', 'capable', 'assists', 'willing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'boasting', 'likes', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'Madison', 'Pettis', 'natural', 'talent', 'shines', 'very', 'smart', 'classical', 'music-inclined', 'Peyton', 'deftly', 'handling', 'wealth', 'lines', 'managing', 'avoid', 'child', 'actor', 'landmine', 'being', 'coy', 'sickeningly', 'cute.But', 'make', 'mistake', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'natural', 'charisma', 'work', 'serious', 'script', 'yet', 'undetermined', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'GRIDIRON', 'GANG', 'comedy', 'comedy-action', 'films', 'speedily', 'reached', 'comfort', 'level', 'key', 'take', 'cinematic', 'career', 'seriously', 'not', 'averse', 'poking', 'fun', 'image', 'much', 'mold', 'Arnold', 'inKindergarten', 'CopandTwins', 'trait', 'never', 'more', 'spotlight', 'film', 'ignominy', 'having', 'daughter', 'dress', 'dog', 'Spike', 'tutu', 'even', 'poisoning', 'cookie', 'Thinammon', ""'m"", 'allergic', 'thinammon', 'One', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'way', 'allergy', 'sequence', 'Joe', 'press', 'television', 'spot', 'promos', 'Boston', 'Rebels', 'expewience', 'tha', 'heat', '.Too', 'Rock', 'advantage', 'Joe', 'quirky', 'combination', 'fastidiousness', 'machismo', 'mine', 'laughter', 'audience', 'one', 'hand', 'Elvis', 'neat', 'freak', ""n't"", 'like', 'fingerprints', 'fridge', 'other', 'hand', 'God', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'napkins', 'coasters', 'crib', 'further', 'punctuate', 'cluelessness', 'state', 'fatherhood', 'Peyton', 'terms', 'football', 'playcalling', 'much', 'baby', 'Rock', 'natural', 'handling', 'comedy', 'elements', 'ease', 'dexterity', 'athleticism', 'sheer', 'physical', 'presence', 'are', 'always', 'assets', 'coming', 'particularly', 'handy', 'film', 'football', 'background', 'was', 'defensive', 'tackle', '1991', 'NCAA', 'football', 'champs', 'Miami', 'Hurricanes', 'acting', 'craft', 'did', 'suffer', 'ruptured', 'Achilles', 'tendon', 'fairly', 'common', 'sports', 'injury', 'filming', 'picture', 'How', 'method', 'acting', 'Rock', 'moved', 'flavor', 'month', 'firmly', 'category', 'leading', 'action', 'star', 'who', 'here', 'stay', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'how', 'next', 'project', ""'ll"", 'work', 'out', 'did', 'original', 'ESCAPE', 'TO', 'WITCH', 'MOUNTAIN', 'hear', 'SHAZAM', 'corner', 'future', 'now', 'GAME', 'PLAN', 'here', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'carve', 'hefty', 'inroads', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'So', 'yes', 'definitely', 'go', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'Rock', 'lisp', 'again', 'cinema']",N/A

For the most part, I find myself unimpressed by Disney's various live-action family comedies, I think that Disney produces excellent drama's safe for the whole family, but for some reason their comedies always fall short. It seems to me, that those responsible for bringing Disney's comedies to the big screen simply don't put forth the amount of effort needed to elevate the story above being average or below, therefore leaving me generally feeling cold to the end result. Well, with the release of ""The Game Plan"", for once Disney surprised me, and actually produced a live-action family comedy that was full of genuinely funny moments, solid acting, a little bit of drama, and even some sports action mixed together to form a thoroughly entertaining movie that everyone can enjoy.""The Game Plan"" focuses on superstar quarterback Joe Kingman (Dwayne Johnson) who is preparing to lead his team through the final games of the playoffs and hopefully to the championship game. Everything is going perfectly for Joe, a self-obsessed man who cares only for himself and doesn't even think twice to ridicule other teammates who have other concerns besides football, such as family, finances, and day-to-day life. However, that is all about to change when Joe receives an unexpected surprise in the form of an 8-year-old daughter he never even knew he had. Now, with the championship game fast approaching, Joe's world is being turned upside down, though not in a completely bad way. In fact, what at first seemed like an inconvenience is becoming the best blessing Joe has ever received as his newly found daughter begins to open his heart to more than just himself, and allows Joe to see that there is a world outside of football, and that sometimes there are more important things to worry about than the next game.I'm very pleased with the way ""The Game Plan"" broke Disney's normal convention of family comedies, that are generally so formulaic and by-the-book, thanks to the writers, Nichole Millard and Kathryn Price (both first time feature film writers), along with director Andy Fickman (""She's the Man""), actually attempting to include originality and genuine laughs without relying on the usual slapstick that is so cheap and, by this point in the studio's longevity, extremely overused. Sure, the story has its moments of predictability, and you can easily see how the movie's going to end long before you reach that point, but the journey the film takes you on contains enough surprises and little twists along the way that you don't mind the fact that you already know the outcome. It was these surprising moments that elevated ""The Game Plan"" well above the majority of Disney's live-action comedy crop, actually getting it a little bit closer to achieving the quality of their acclaimed sports-themed drama's, such as, ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Glory Road"". Of course, the numerous bits of football action didn't hurt either, and I was surprised that the story approached the football scenes in a more realistic way rather than the slapstick way I had expected, which would have been to try to get in some cheap sight gags while out on the field. Even the locker room scenes, though a tad clich&eacute;d in places, weren't filled with the ridiculousness that I had expected from Disney over the years. Clearly, those in charge of this movie knew the typical pitfalls that most of these films succumb to, and were wise enough to avoid them at all costs.Former wrestler turned actor Dwayne Johnson (formerly known as The Rock) brings his character of Joe Kingman to ridiculously narcissistic life, imbuing him with an arrogance that is not completely off-putting due to his equal amount of charm and charisma that allows the audience to still root for him despite his shortcomings. When his daughter, played by newcomer Madison Pettis, who turns out to be a very talented young actress; Johnson handles the change in Joe's character in a very natural way. At first he approaches this newfound responsibility with the same careless manner that he handles most matters in his personal life; however, the more time he spends with this child the softer he becomes, until he eventually develops a deeply genuine love for his daughter, along with a willingness to do whatever it takes to remain in her life, even if it costs him the big game or jeopardizes his future successes on and off the field. Kyra Sedgwick is perfect as Joe's scheming agent who desperately wants an endorsement deal with a fast-food chain that she knows is worthless, and will stop at nothing in her efforts to push this newest obstacle in the form of Joe's new daughter out of the way before any more damage is done to his career, at least from her perspective. Leading the rest of the supporting cast, which consisted mostly of Joe's football team, is actor Morris Chestnut who represents the only man on the team who appears to have a family and children to call his own. He is the brunt of most of Joe's jokes early on in the film, but eventually becomes a close friend and adviser to Joe in all things child related. Lastly, actress Roselyn Sanchez (""The Boat Trip"") shows up about halfway through the movie as a ballet instructor that teaches the class Joe's daughter attends, she brings a hint of romance to the proceedings and serves as the eventual love interest for Joe as she helps his daughter reach the father trapped inside this self-absorbed jock's body.""The Game Plan"" is in no way the perfect film, it's as predictable as most family or romantic comedies tend to be, but the story contains enough surprises throughout that I didn't even mind knowing exactly how the movie was going to end before it really ever began. Featuring solid acting, genuine laughs, a heartwarming story, and even some football action, when mixed together these elements make ""The Game Plan"" a winner of a family comedy in my book.""The Game Plan"" is rated PG.",4,Sometimes Life Doesn't Go According to Plan...,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,6122,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Disney', 'newest', 'family', 'comedy', 'Game',

He was also a part of the Miami Hurricanes football team.  He combines the giant ego of ""The Rock"" in WWE and his football skills to create Joe Kingman, a pro football player who's got everything but a championship ring.  He even has something that he doesn't know he has--a daughter.  On top of his game, his ego crashes hard when young Peyton (Madison Pettis) shows up at his front door.  Never having any sort of responsibilities before, Kingman tries to juggle his football career, his high profile lifestyle and his new daughter.  All the while his agent, a devilishly funny Kyra Sedgwick, tries to figure out if little Peyton is the real deal, or just another opportunist trying to get her hands on a piece of the Kingman pie.  Will Kingman get his priorities straight, or will he succumb to the fast and easy lifestyle his lived for so long?Rosalyn Sanchez heads up a solid supporting cast of actors and actresses who you may not be familiar with (excepting Morris Chesnut, playing a solid father-figure teammate).  The story is generic and highly unoriginal, but the solid performances of the entire cast and the wholesome, family-geared direction make this story more than worthy of four stars.  Everybody, even the quasi-villain Sedgwick, is likeable.  Johnson shows his singing chops that wrestling fans will already be familiar with.  He also has that million-dollar smile that lights up the screen.  Young Pettis steals most of her scenes, even though she could be accused of boosting the sugar content a bit too much at times.  Johnson's teammates are also enjoyable to watch on the screen.  Their chemistry with Johnson, each other and with young Pettis is great.If you long for the days of sugary Disney live-action family features such as the original ""Herbie"" films and ""The Apple Dumpling Gang,"" ""The Game Plan"" is a welcome treat.  It's a rare family comedy that the entire family will enjoy.

1119800,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000YGGNLK,Olukayode Balogun,"[1, 1]","After weeks of spending my vacation vegging out in front of the TV interrupted only by eating, sleeping and shopping for clothes and CDs with money I don't really have, I finally made it to the movie theatre today (Thanks, Derek!). I have at least two other movies currently showing here in the US on my 'must see before I fly home next week' list and this one's first of the pack.Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is Joe Kingman, a professional football player for the Boston Rebels. He's living the dream; young, (well, relatively), rich and with a high rise apartment filled with every man gadget imaginable, not to mention plenty of pictures of himself and a lot of homage to Elvis. Oh, and then there's Spike, his hideously ugly but immediately loveable bulldog.Then one fine day out of the clear blue sky, his past catches up with him in the guise of an eight-year old daughter he didn't know he had, who literally comes knocking on his door. The movie takes off from there and we get to see Kingman grapple with the new idea of being a father, while at the same time saying goodbye to his days as a carefree bachelor. His daughter seems much more prepared than he does, not to mention much more skilled in dealing with the situation. In getting to know his daughter, in many ways, Kingman gets to know himself.I obviously can't give anything away but I will say this: there weren't enough laughs for me to feel able to label this a good comedy; rather, I'd say it was a well-meaning and wholesome feelgood family smilefest, with a few good laughs thrown in here and there. There were some jokes the adults seemed to get that seemed to go over the head of the kids in the audience and then there were others the kids got instant laughs from that escaped me completely. (For example, I didn't know what 'to be bedazzled' meant until today but all the kids seemed to). I considered asking my sister if I could take my nieces to go see it but I doubt she would've let me. My elder niece is eleven years old but PG still makes her mother nervous.As it was, there was no profanity nor where there any crude jokes but I thought that maybe there was just a leeeeeetle bit too much naked male flesh on display (though that could be the puritanical gay man in me talking). There were some subliminal life messages in the movie though, I felt, but I'll leave those to individual viewers to discern.Johnson gives a somewhat credible performance and also noteworthy are Kyra Sedgwick as the stereotypical it's-all-about-the-money football agent, the ever gorgeous Roselyn Sanchez as little girl's ballet teacher, the ever watchable Paige Turco as her guardian auntie and Hayes MacArthur as the more-brawn-than-brains member of the football team. I was also really happy to see Brian White and Morris Chestnut play two of the other teammates. Chestnut seems headed for the big time at last and deservedly so. That man has been working very hard rather underrated, for a very long time.But most of all, for me this movie was about the cute-as-a-button Madison Pettis, who plays Kingman's daughter Peyton.

1119814,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000YGGNLK,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[48, 50]","Having grown rather tired of this fall's onslaught of violent R-rated films, this movie is a welcome change and it's better than you might think.Of course, there is nothing original about this film.  We have another action actor who wants to prove he is something more than that.  We've experienced this when Arnold went fromThe Terminatorto being aKindergarten Cop, when Clint Eastwood quit beingDirty Harryto becomeEvery Which Way but Loose, and Vin Diesel gave up beingThe Fast and the Furiousto beingThe Pacifier.  Now Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wants us to forget his action hero status for a more family friendly guy in ""The Game Plan"" by Disney.This film has all the traditional ""fish out of water"" cliches you can imagine and silly humor that is a staple in all Disney live action films; however, most are forgivable here.  The ""fish out of water"" element is handled well-enough although very predictable.  As the characters grow, it is also quite touching.  I thought the humor was of the ""hit and miss"" variety.  Miss: child lost in bubble bath.  Hit: allergy to cinnamon.  I have to say though in all fairness that the hits are hysterical and overshadow the misses (as annoying as they are).The plot is relatively simple in that a self-obsessed football hero is suddenly saddled with a child he never knew he had; however, and I won't spoil it, there are some very interesting twists to this set up that are not as predictable as most of the other elements in this film.  Most character in this film are stereotypes that don't development and, quite frankly, don't need to.  It's The Rock's character that needs to grow and he does and does so in a surprisingly believable manner.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has been a better actor than he's been given credit for being.  I feel much the same way about Vin Diesel.  Both of these current action stars have proven themselves in a number of films and with both now having ventured into family comedy, they are growing as actors.  The Rock in this film is really quite a surprise in that we learn that not only can he hold a tune nicely, he does a pleasing take on Elvis's ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"", but he is also an accomplished enough actor to cry on cue.  Yup, you read that right!  It is not a digital effect; he actually cries on cue without a break or cutaway in the take to add fake tears.  I was rather impressed with that.I was also impressed with the surprising comic performance turned in by Kyra Sedgwick (TV's ""The Closer, and A.K.A. Mrs. Kevin Bacon).  She isn't over-the-top evil like Glenn Close in101 Dalmatians & 102 Dalmatians, but she is malicious and has a gift for delivering quick one-liners.  She is completely enjoyable in her evil little role here.This light fare is a surprisingly better film than I expected and it's #1 opening at the box-office suggests that I'm not alone in that evaluation.  Take a break from the sex and violence currently splattering in our multiplex and go enjoy a film with your whole family that might move you more than you might expect it to.",4,A solid plan for family entertainment.,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,3054,"['Having', 'grown', 'rather', 'tired', 'fall', 'onslaught', 'violent', 'R-rated', 'films', 'movie', 'welcome', 'change', 'better', 'might', 'think.Of', 'course', 'nothing', 'original', 'film', 'have', 'action', 'actor', 'who', 'prove', 'something', 'more', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'when', 'Arnold', 'went', 'fromThe', 'Terminatorto', 'being', 'aKindergarten', 'Cop', 'when', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'quit', 'beingDirty', 'Harryto', 'becomeEvery', 'Which', 'Way', 'Loose', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'gave', 'up', 'beingThe', 'Fast', 'Furiousto', 'beingThe', 'Pacifier', 'Now', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'forget', 'action', 'hero', 'status', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'guy', 'Game', 'Plan', 'Disney.This', 'film', 'traditional', 'fish', 'water', 'cliches', 'can', 'imagine', 'silly', 'humor', 'staple', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'however', 'most', 'are', 'forgivable', 'here', 'fish', 'water', 'element', 'handled', 'well-enough', 'very', 'predictable', 'characters', 'grow', 'also', 'quite', 'touching', 'thought', 'humor', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'variety', 'Miss', 'child', 'lost', 'bubble', 'bath', 'Hit', 'allergy', 'cinnamon', 'have', 'say', 'fairness', 'hits', 'are', 'hysterical', 'misses', 'as', 'annoying', 'are', '.The', 'plot', 'relatively', 'simple', 'self-obsessed', 'football', 'hero', 'suddenly', 'saddled', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'twists', 'set', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'predictable', 'most', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'Most', 'character', 'film', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'do', ""n't"", 'development', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Rock', 'character', 'grow', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'believable', 'manner.Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'been', 'better', 'actor', 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'being', 'feel', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'current', 'action', 'stars', 'have', 'proven', 'number', 'films', 'now', 'having', 'ventured', 'family', 'comedy', 'are', 'growing', 'actors', 'Rock', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'surprise', 'learn', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'hold', 'tune', 'nicely', 'pleasing', 'take', 'Elvis', 'Are', 'Lonesome', 'Tonight', 'also', 'accomplished', 'enough', 'actor', 'cry', 'cue', 'Yup', 'read', 'right', 'not', 'digital', 'effect', 'actually', 'cue', 'break', 'cutaway', 'take', 'add', 'fake', 'tears', 'was', 'rather', 'impressed', 'that.I', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'surprising', 'comic', 'performance', 'turned', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'TV', 'Closer', 'A.K.A', 'Mrs.', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', ""n't"", 'over-the-top', 'evil', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'in101', 'Dalmatians', '102', 'Dalmatians', 'malicious', 'gift', 'delivering', 'quick', 'one-liners', 'completely', 'enjoyable', 'evil', 'little', 'role', 'here.This', 'light', 'fare', 'surprisingly', 'better', 'film', 'expected', '1', 'opening', 'box-office', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'evaluation', 'Take', 'break', 'sex', 'violence', 'currently', 'splattering', 'multiplex', 'go', 'enjoy', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'might', 'move', 'more', 'might', 'expect']",N/A
