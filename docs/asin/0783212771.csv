It does, but not until many more people are killed, all following the threatening voice, giving a riddle.Roger, trying to discover why this is happening, is framed for the murder and is on the run, hiding from the police in wacked-up costumes.

45405,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0783212771,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","Since George Lucas had enough money from his Star Wars empire not to care what critics would say, he wrote and produced this affectionate nod to old time radio. It is a whacky slapstick farce with charm, moving faster than a speeding bullet. It is dopey and dumb, sweet and innocent, cornball and old-fashioned, just as it was meant to be. The jarring breakneck speed of it had critics thinking it should have been a riot, and it was received by and large like a slap in the face.If you can get past the machine gun speed and accept it on the level that George Lucas intended, there is a sweet wonderful film here, however. It all takes place during radio's heyday on the night WBN attempts to go national and become the fourth major radio network. There is a beautiful 1930's retro look which almost gets lost in the crazy and corny atmosphere of this film. The radio station itself is teriffic, as are the period details in Lucas' loving homage to all that was great about this forgotten medium.The main crux of the story is the relationship of Roger (Brian Benben) and Penny ( Mary Stuart Masterson). She practically runs the station and he's one of the writers. She thinks he was messing around with their sexy star Claudette (Anita Morris) and wants a divorce. He wasn't, of course, and has to talk her out of it since he loves her.As she is sending WBN's page, Billy (Michael Scott Campbell), back and forth to the writer's room to get her stories page by page, a phantom voice keeps interrupting the broadcast with riddles. Some very real murders behind the mike bring Lt. Cross (Michael Lerner) to the station, where everything points to Ben, the bodies piling up fast.Lucas allows us to see the makings of old radio as Roger tries to clear himself and find the culprit. Christopher Lloyd is on hand as the frantic sound effects man and Corbin Bernsen is the radio announcer. Robert Klein, Peter MacNicol, and Harvey Korman are part of the writing team, but it is Leighann Lord as the cleaning lady, Morgan, who comes up with all the last second ideas for the show.The murders occur in ways often used in old time radio and that is part of its charm. Lucas had this filmed in a fast and furious fashion, as if the movie itself was an old radio show. None of it is to be taken seriously as it is only entertainment, there to make us smile. It was a time in entertainment when even murder had a sort of a screwy innocence about it. So does this film.Considered a huge failure upon its release, this film has slowly garnered a following in recent years. If you can get past the pace and the dopey slapstick antics, you'll find a lot of charm here, and an innocence in entertainment we'll never see again.",5,An Affectionate and Misunderstood Wave to Radio,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,2709,"['George', 'Lucas', 'had', 'enough', 'money', 'Star', 'Wars', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'critics', 'would', 'say', 'wrote', 'produced', 'affectionate', 'nod', 'old', 'time', 'radio', 'whacky', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'charm', 'moving', 'faster', 'speeding', 'bullet', 'dopey', 'dumb', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'cornball', 'old-fashioned', 'just', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'jarring', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'had', 'critics', 'thinking', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'riot', 'was', 'received', 'large', 'slap', 'face.If', 'can', 'get', 'machine', 'gun', 'speed', 'accept', 'level', 'George', 'Lucas', 'intended', 'sweet', 'wonderful', 'film', 'here', 'however', 'place', 'radio', 'heyday', 'night', 'WBN', 'attempts', 'go', 'national', 'become', 'fourth', 'major', 'radio', 'network', 'beautiful', '1930', 'retro', 'look', 'almost', 'lost', 'crazy', 'corny', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'radio', 'station', 'teriffic', 'are', 'period', 'details', 'Lucas', 'loving', 'homage', 'was', 'great', 'forgotten', 'medium.The', 'main', 'crux', 'story', 'relationship', 'Roger', 'Brian', 'Benben', 'Penny', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'practically', 'station', 'one', 'writers', 'was', 'messing', 'around', 'sexy', 'star', 'Claudette', 'Anita', 'Morris', 'divorce', 'was', ""n't"", 'course', 'talk', 'her.As', 'sending', 'WBN', 'page', 'Billy', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Campbell', 'back', 'forth', 'writer', 'room', 'get', 'stories', 'page', 'page', 'phantom', 'voice', 'keeps', 'interrupting', 'broadcast', 'riddles', 'very', 'real', 'murders', 'mike', 'bring', 'Lt.', 'Cross', 'Michael', 'Lerner', 'station', 'where', 'everything', 'points', 'Ben', 'bodies', 'piling', 'up', 'fast.Lucas', 'see', 'makings', 'old', 'radio', 'Roger', 'clear', 'find', 'culprit', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'hand', 'frantic', 'sound', 'effects', 'man', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'radio', 'announcer', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'Peter', 'MacNicol', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'are', 'part', 'writing', 'team', 'Leighann', 'Lord', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'Morgan', 'who', 'up', 'last', 'second', 'ideas', 'show.The', 'murders', 'occur', 'ways', 'often', 'used', 'old', 'time', 'radio', 'part', 'charm', 'Lucas', 'had', 'filmed', 'fast', 'furious', 'fashion', 'movie', 'was', 'old', 'radio', 'show', 'None', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'only', 'entertainment', 'make', 'smile', 'was', 'time', 'entertainment', 'when', 'even', 'murder', 'had', 'sort', 'screwy', 'innocence', 'So', 'film.Considered', 'huge', 'failure', 'release', 'film', 'slowly', 'garnered', 'following', 'recent', 'years', 'can', 'get', 'pace', 'dopey', 'slapstick', 'antics', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'charm', 'here', 'innocence', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'again']",N/A

It's a screwball comedy that is nonstop entertainment from start to finish.  The story, interestingly, was written by George Lucas, who you can usually count on for a good yarn.  The script itself was written by frequent Lucas collaborators, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, who are responsible for 'American Graffiti' and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', among others (one of which is the acquired taste: 'Howard the Duck').Mary Stuart Masterson and Brian Benben are the leads (although this is really an ensemble film) as the separated and constantly bickering couple, both working at a radio station in the '30s where a series of bizarre murders take place during the opening night broadcast.  It's a multilayered story that doesn't really give the viewer anytime to rest.  Not many actors can handle this kind of rapid fire and comedic dialogue mixed with physical comedy, but Masterson and Benben are naturals and it shows.  The supporting cast includes a bevy of fantastic actors playing assorted off-the-wall characters.  Check out this list: Ned Beatty, Jeffrey Tambor, Michael McKean, Christopher Lloyd, Bobcat Goldthwait, Stephen Tobolowsky, Larry Miller, Peter MacNicol, and Michael Lerner just to name some of the many.  It amazes me how the filmmakers can harness all of these crazy characters and the insane script into a cohesive movie.  Well, they do it quite well in this film.'Radioland Murders' is a nice mix of Marx brothers' craziness, frequent slapstick, murder mystery, and maybe even a little bit of love story thrown in for good measure.

45412,AYMZTWBG0V53W,0783212771,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[0, 0]","1994 was a strange year for cinema, in that a lot of nostalgia was in the air and not everyone entertaining the Cineplex was capable of breathing (&#34;The Shadow&#34;, with Alec Baldwin, has long been a favorite of mine, but it got the silent treatment from audiences, who were either cultural amnesiacs or just plain dismissive because they were too busy holding their noses up high in the air). I was happy to be alive at that point in cinema history, because it seemed like Universal studios was going to be leading the way back to common sense in entertainment offerings by calling upon the wisdom and techniques of 1940s-era moviemaking. Unfortunately, &#34;Radioland Murders&#34; is a movie for nostalgic folks (like myself) more than it is for casual audiences. Lucas obviously had fun while putting together the scraps to make up this story, but sometimes the results feel forced and labored (not a good thing for a fun, happy-go-lucky tribute to the mindset of Howard Hawks). I think it's neat that some reviewers on this site have noticed that the movie tries hard to outwit the audience by staying lightning fast quick ahead of it, but, for me personally, it all doesn't add up to that much fun or amusement. I think of a perfect entertainment treat from back in the 1940s (&#34;The Ghost Breakers&#34; with Bob Hope comes to mind as an example of a wonderful script that blended genres successfully so that getting bored was less easy to do while watching it) and compare it to this homage and I find myself wanting more. Nonetheless, I think it pays tribute to a more innocent age quite well, and I can't give it a poor grade as a result of my fondness for what this movie was/is trying to do. In time, historians may come to appreciate it more. Yes, I am one of those slowly paced critics who likes to watch movies that are more &#34;boring&#34; to the general populace and less concerned with entertainment and spectacle in the end.

The only reason I watched it was because, despite the pans I've read of the film over the years, I couldn't really believe it was THAT bad, given that cast.  Well, it is.  Not only is it bad, it's depressing how bad it is.  Even George Burns is unfunny, for God's sake!  The film is ostensibly about a series of murders that take place during a marathon coast-to-coast radio broadcast (and one of the acts is a Fred and Ginger dance routine, which of course is PERFECT for radio).  Abbott and Costello did this fifty years earlier, a thousand times better.  EVERY gag falls flat, torpedoed by unbelievably inept staging, timing and filming.  Anyone watching it for the mystery angle will have no difficulty guessing the identity of the killer, either.  The only thing really to recommend is a funny performance by Michael McKean...and he has only ONE line; the rest is pantomime.  Brian Benben, normally a highly resourceful actor, desperately tries to replicate the kind of 1930s breezy, bumbling leading man performance that Cary Grant could do comatose.  He gets an A (well, maybe a B) for effort, but that's all it ultimately amounts to: effort and desperation.

My love of Old Time Radio probably spurs this on because the movie is set there with love by George Lucas and his people.I'm too young to have been around for OTR (as it's referred to these days), but I learned to love it all the same.  THE SHADOW, THE LONE RANGER, THE GREEN HORNET and dozens of other shows that later became movies and television series came out of those years.I still listen to episodes in my car and get carried away by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in BOLD VENTURE.  There's just something magical about radio because you have to create so much of the world and the characters in your mind.That's the way it is with this movie.  It's got the rapid-fire dialogue and insane pacing of a radio show.  There's no spare meat on the story, and throw-away lines are used over and over again to tie the events together.  Even old jokes that are groaners materialize on the sets and it's marvelous to see them carried out again.The conceit of the story is that a series of murders are committed on the opening night of a brand-new radio station, WBN, in 1939.  A husband and wife whose relationship is struggling because of a possible infidelity is caught in the crossfire.Brian Benben plays Roger, the head writer for the studio, and delivers a great performance.  His walk, his mannerism, his wild-eyed stares, and even his delivery were rooted in Groucho Marx's insane, quick-witted characters.  I've seen him in other things, but I'm still amazed at how well he pulls the role off.Mary Stuart Masterson play Penny, the girl Friday that the studio desperately needs to keep everything moving smoothly.  Not that it does.  But watching Penny desperately trying to keep the ship from sinking while dealing with Roger and the murders is a treat.The other characters run the gamut.  Ned Betty plays the studio owner who runs the place like a military commander.  Corbin Bernsen plays the smarmy announcer.  Christopher Lloyd portrays an intense, over-the-top sound man that's a sheer joy to watch.  Michael Lerner delivers and outstanding hardboiled Hollywood cop.  Michael McKean is a hilarious band director.The film didn't do all that well at the box office, but I love it because it plays homage to OTR and because I love movies that have dialogue instead of just being pieces glued together with the latest Top 40.  Maybe the dialogue isn't all that original or especially funny to someone not in the mood or who hasn't developed a taste for it, but for those of use that have, it's a perfect gem of a film.Topping off the film, the music is great, running the gamut of the big band era, and sounds fantastic.  If you're in the mood for a no-brainer, something that's a delightfully thin mix of comedy, mystery, and thriller, RADIOLAND MURDERS will provide a couple hours' entertainment.",5,Great Slapstick Comedy Set in the Old Radio Days!,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2943,"['RADIOLAND', 'MURDERS', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'put', 'when', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hard', 'week', 'want', 'go', 'brain-dead', 'something', 'familiar', 'love', 'Old', 'Time', 'Radio', 'probably', 'movie', 'set', 'love', 'George', 'Lucas', 'people.I', ""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'have', 'been', 'OTR', 'referred', 'days', 'learned', 'love', 'same', 'SHADOW', 'THE', 'LONE', 'RANGER', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'HORNET', 'dozens', 'other', 'shows', 'later', 'became', 'movies', 'television', 'series', 'came', 'years.I', 'still', 'listen', 'episodes', 'car', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'BOLD', 'VENTURE', 'just', 'something', 'magical', 'radio', 'have', 'create', 'so', 'much', 'world', 'characters', 'mind.That', 'way', 'movie', 'got', 'rapid-fire', 'dialogue', 'insane', 'pacing', 'radio', 'show', 'spare', 'meat', 'story', 'throw-away', 'lines', 'are', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'tie', 'events', 'together', 'Even', 'old', 'jokes', 'are', 'groaners', 'materialize', 'sets', 'marvelous', 'see', 'carried', 'again.The', 'conceit', 'story', 'series', 'murders', 'are', 'committed', 'opening', 'night', 'brand-new', 'radio', 'station', 'WBN', '1939', 'husband', 'wife', 'relationship', 'struggling', 'possible', 'infidelity', 'caught', 'crossfire.Brian', 'Benben', 'Roger', 'head', 'writer', 'studio', 'great', 'performance', 'walk', 'mannerism', 'wild-eyed', 'stares', 'even', 'delivery', 'were', 'rooted', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'insane', 'quick-witted', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'things', ""'m"", 'still', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'role', 'off.Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'play', 'Penny', 'girl', 'Friday', 'studio', 'desperately', 'keep', 'everything', 'moving', 'smoothly', 'Not', 'watching', 'Penny', 'desperately', 'trying', 'keep', 'ship', 'sinking', 'dealing', 'Roger', 'murders', 'treat.The', 'other', 'characters', 'run', 'gamut', 'Ned', 'Betty', 'studio', 'owner', 'who', 'place', 'military', 'commander', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'smarmy', 'announcer', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'intense', 'over-the-top', 'sound', 'man', 'sheer', 'joy', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Lerner', 'delivers', 'outstanding', 'hardboiled', 'Hollywood', 'cop', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'hilarious', 'band', 'director.The', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'love', 'homage', 'OTR', 'love', 'movies', 'have', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'pieces', 'glued', 'together', 'latest', 'Top', '40', 'Maybe', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'original', 'especially', 'funny', 'someone', 'not', 'mood', 'who', ""n't"", 'developed', 'taste', 'use', 'have', 'perfect', 'gem', 'film.Topping', 'off', 'film', 'music', 'great', 'running', 'gamut', 'big', 'band', 'era', 'fantastic', ""'re"", 'mood', 'no-brainer', 'something', 'delightfully', 'thin', 'mix', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'RADIOLAND', 'MURDERS', 'will', 'provide', 'couple', 'hours', 'entertainment']",N/A

Unfortunately, the end result is a mess.Growing up I used to enjoy listening to recordings of classic radio shows, but this film fails to capture any of the magic from those big broadcasts. I've never seen so many people strain so hard to be diversely entertaining and come up with such humdrum results. It's as if ""Bean"" director Mel Smith was aiming a gun at everyone in the cast saying, ""Act wacky, or else!""For me, what makes screwball comedy work is an illusion of spontaneity, and no matter how chaotic ""Radioland Murders"" got, I always had the feeling the material had been left out on the counter for several days, with the heat on.  The film also makes it hard to care when hardly any time is invested in character development -- instead, from the outset the audience is thrown into the blender along with the rest of the talented cast, and screenplay.There's a terrific Barbara Stanwyck movie from 1943 called ""The Lady of Burlesque"" that accomplishes much of what ""Radioland Murders"" attempts story wise, only in a 30's burlesque setting.

However, what you shouldn't ignore is the marvelous inside look at what life during the Golden Age of Radio was like for everyone involved with the medium.The premise is that in 1939 WBN, a Chicago-based radio 'superstation,' is attempting to launch a national network to compete with NBC, CBS, Dumont and Mutual. (Note:  one thing that makes me as a fan of old-time radio grit his teeth is the movie's constant reference to launching a 'fourth' network when in fact there were already four - five, if you count NBC Blue and NBC Red (later ABC) as two separate networks.  It's a glaring mistake and one that could have been fixed with one lousy line of dialogue!) During the inaugural network broadcast, a series of murders of important players in the enterprise takes place within the walls of the station.  Suspicion falls on the head of the station's writing team, who is about to be divorced by his wife, the station's assistant manager. He has to figure out who the murderer is and solve the case, while simultaneously staying out of the hands of the cops AND continuing to write half a dozen different radio scripts.As I said, a thin plot.  However, what makes this movie worth watching is the look behind the radio broadcasts of the period.  The attention paid to authenticity is remarkable, not least because of the homages to many Golden Age radio entertainers.  Among those honored are Orson Welles (The Shadow), Gene Autry (The Singing Cowboy), Spike Jones and his City Slickers (the interpretation of Kacheturian's ""Sabre Dance"" done on tuned bottles is right up Spike's alley), Cab Calloway and Glenn Miller.  There are also performances by two actual radio stars of the period, Rosemary Clooney and George Burns.However, for my money the show is stolen by Christopher Lloyd as Zoltan, the sound-effects genius who creates the settings in the mind's eye of the listeners. Using the actual techniques that were used in live radio, you get to see how it was done back in the day and just how effective a total pro who must produce dozens of effects per show could be, back before the days when any effect you wanted could be found on a record or in the computer and you had to get it right the first time, in real time.  It will give you a whole new appreciation of the radio sound effects' spiritual descendants, the Foley Artists of the movies.Bottom line:  Don't watch this because you like murder mysteries.  Watch it because you are a fan of old-time radio and want to see what it must have been like to be present in the studio for a live broadcast, and you'll enjoy yourself hugely.",4,Return Now to Those Glorious Days of Yesteryear,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,2715,"['As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'can', 'ignore', 'plot', 'Radioland', 'Murders', 'thinner', 'sheet', 'tissue', 'paper', 'However', 'what', 'should', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'marvelous', 'inside', 'look', 'what', 'life', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Radio', 'was', 'everyone', 'involved', 'medium.The', 'premise', '1939', 'WBN', 'Chicago-based', 'radio', ""'superstation"", 'attempting', 'launch', 'national', 'network', 'compete', 'NBC', 'CBS', 'Dumont', 'Mutual', 'Note', 'one', 'thing', 'fan', 'old-time', 'radio', 'grit', 'teeth', 'movie', 'constant', 'reference', 'launching', ""'fourth"", 'network', 'when', 'fact', 'were', 'already', 'four', 'five', 'count', 'NBC', 'Blue', 'NBC', 'Red', 'later', 'ABC', 'two', 'separate', 'networks', 'glaring', 'mistake', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'one', 'lousy', 'line', 'dialogue', 'inaugural', 'network', 'broadcast', 'series', 'murders', 'important', 'players', 'enterprise', 'place', 'walls', 'station', 'Suspicion', 'head', 'station', 'writing', 'team', 'who', 'be', 'divorced', 'wife', 'station', 'assistant', 'manager', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'murderer', 'solve', 'case', 'simultaneously', 'staying', 'hands', 'cops', 'continuing', 'write', 'dozen', 'different', 'radio', 'scripts.As', 'said', 'thin', 'plot', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'look', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'period', 'attention', 'paid', 'authenticity', 'remarkable', 'not', 'least', 'homages', 'many', 'Golden', 'Age', 'radio', 'entertainers', 'honored', 'are', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Shadow', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'Singing', 'Cowboy', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'City', 'Slickers', 'interpretation', 'Kacheturian', 'Sabre', 'Dance', 'done', 'tuned', 'bottles', 'right', 'Spike', 'alley', 'Cab', 'Calloway', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'are', 'also', 'performances', 'two', 'actual', 'radio', 'stars', 'period', 'Rosemary', 'Clooney', 'George', 'Burns.However', 'money', 'show', 'stolen', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Zoltan', 'sound-effects', 'genius', 'who', 'settings', 'mind', 'eye', 'listeners', 'Using', 'actual', 'techniques', 'were', 'used', 'live', 'radio', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'back', 'day', 'just', 'how', 'effective', 'total', 'pro', 'who', 'must', 'produce', 'dozens', 'effects', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'effect', 'wanted', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'record', 'computer', 'had', 'get', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'real', 'time', 'will', 'give', 'whole', 'new', 'appreciation', 'radio', 'sound', 'effects', 'spiritual', 'descendants', 'Foley', 'Artists', 'movies.Bottom', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'Watch', 'are', 'fan', 'old-time', 'radio', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'be', 'present', 'studio', 'live', 'broadcast', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'hugely']",N/A

So naturally things go awry.

I could figure out that the radio station WBN in Chicago was supposed to be WGN-just like the TV series WKRP in Cincinatti is supposed to be WKRC in Cincinatti!There were plenty of pretty chorus girls and fast moving slapstick humor and action. You had to be alert to catch all the jokes! As I was doing a personal study of the prophet Ezekiel at the time the weird line inserted into a radio play dialog-""Die, you infidel Dog, die!-The Curse of Nebuchadnezzar be upon you!"" really cracked me up since the prophecy of Ezekiel was set in ancient Babylon when Nebuchadnezzar was emperor. There is, of course, no such curse!In real life I heard on a history TV show that the man who invented TV in the 30's had it patented; and yet no one bought his patent; but the corporations waited until the patent expired and waited after WWII and then took the invention from the man for free. This is a real danger of producing intellectual property!

I read ""Girl Singer:an autobiography"" and got the conveniently packaged ""Songs from the Girl Singer: a musical  autobiography ""CD set. Like Girranimals, the similarly titled pieces have the same picture on the front so that the purchaser will know that they go together.  I heartily recommend both.I also recommend this madcap musical murder mystery movie that manages to pay homage to Radio Days Gone By while keeping audiences of all eras entertained.  It's the 1939 opening night live extravagnaze broadcast of  the fictional WBN in Chicago, a 4th national network.  Who's killing the participants?  What played in Peoria?  Meanwhile, ""the Show must go on"" and the viewer is treated to a mature Rosemary Clooney, (maybe as a metaphor to her own life, Rosemary sings a heart-rendingly beautiful ""That Old Feeling"" while pandemonium rages off-stage,) George Burns (Gracie had long since left the building by the time this movie was filmed) and others.  Christopher Lloyd as the Sound Effects guy and his noise are a real hoot, as are the ""Bubbly"" live and drop dead commercials and Corbin Bernsen as the smarmy (think his later role as LA Law-yer Arnie Becker) announcer.Radioland Murders works on many levels.
