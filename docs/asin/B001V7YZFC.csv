1243335,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001V7YZFC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 5]","This series scores  primarily because of the domestic drama between the two police leads.  They have decided to live together.  Having two police people work their jobs while trying to also be domestic partners is chancy at best.  As one might expect, he has got the better end of the deal as she is the one who constantly make concessions.  I frankly wished at several points that she would just throw him out. This is the beginning of what will be the best of this show and it really hits its stride with the next season, season four, where the domestic drama is stepped up.Good but more usual in crime shows are two men as two potential pedophiles and murderers.  Although it begins to seem more and more like one is the murderer whereas one is just an almost insane abettor. A 15 year old girl is killed by one or both of them and they must be brought in. They are tried together and the battle is on to prove which is the murderer.There is a very disturbing scene with maggots being thrown on the woman police inspector by the insane one, which some viewers might find so upsetting that they will be sorry they tuned in at all.  This scene is played over and over so if you are one of those viewers, I advise you to skip this.",4,4.5 to 5 as Domestic Police Drama Takes Over,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,1231,"['series', 'primarily', 'domestic', 'drama', 'two', 'police', 'leads', 'have', 'decided', 'live', 'together', 'Having', 'two', 'police', 'people', 'work', 'jobs', 'trying', 'also', 'be', 'domestic', 'partners', 'chancy', 'best', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'got', 'better', 'end', 'deal', 'one', 'who', 'constantly', 'make', 'concessions', 'frankly', 'wished', 'several', 'points', 'would', 'just', 'throw', 'out', 'beginning', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'really', 'stride', 'next', 'season', 'season', 'four', 'where', 'domestic', 'drama', 'stepped', 'up.Good', 'more', 'usual', 'crime', 'shows', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'two', 'potential', 'pedophiles', 'murderers', 'seem', 'more', 'more', 'one', 'murderer', 'one', 'just', 'almost', 'insane', 'abettor', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'killed', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'brought', 'are', 'tried', 'together', 'battle', 'prove', 'murderer.There', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'maggots', 'being', 'thrown', 'woman', 'police', 'inspector', 'insane', 'one', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'so', 'upsetting', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'tuned', 'scene', 'played', 'so', 'are', 'one', 'viewers', 'advise', 'skip']","TRIAL & RETRIBUTION, SET 3"

I found the split-screen format distracting at first, but I've gotten used to it. Well-acted and well-written.One of the episodes in Set 3 features an American criminal profiler, and the actor who plays the part sounds like an American. (Sometimes in British series, there are problems with this.) However, there are a few minor errors in the script. For example, no American would use the expression ""bin bag."" He would say ""trash bag."" He also would refer to newspaper ""clippings,"" not ""cuttings.""",4,Good Series,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,581,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'episodes', 'order', 'think', 'superior', 'series', 'found', 'split-screen', 'format', 'distracting', 'first', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'Well-acted', 'well-written.One', 'episodes', 'Set', '3', 'features', 'American', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'actor', 'who', 'part', 'American', 'Sometimes', 'British', 'series', 'are', 'problems', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'errors', 'script', 'example', 'American', 'would', 'use', 'expression', 'bin', 'bag', 'would', 'say', 'trash', 'bag', 'also', 'would', 'refer', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'not', 'cuttings']","TRIAL & RETRIBUTION, SET 3"

1243340,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B001V7YZFC,"prisrob ""pris,""","[3, 3]","By now, if you have viewed the first 4 episodes, you are aware of DCS Mike Walker and his colleague and, now lover, DCI, Pat North.  It is inexplicable to me how they have maintained their relationship. But, then again, it seems to be unraveling.The quality of this series remains very high. The cases are all original, however, one or two seem to be representative of real life crimes, shown elsewhere.  The acting is superb,  the police procedurals very realistic, and the courtroom scenes are usually spell binding.  The actors are well known, and I can guess that the high quality of the writing and the filming attracts well known stars.We now know that DCS Michael Walker is a murderer, thief and philanderer. But, this seems to be an attraction to some. Exit, DCI, Pat North, and enter, DCI, Roisin Connor.  I was sad to see North leave, and it took me awhile to warm up to the hardened Connor.However, Connor is a much better match for Walker, she is able to put him in his place quite easily. She is superb as an investigator, and like all other DCI's, she is a tough taskmaster. She is beautiful, but understands she needs to work twice as hard as men to achieve her status. Her hard boiled attitude is a method of controlling her emotions. What she faces day to day on her job is mind boggling.  We are privy to the gore and the messiness of the cases, the dead and their families. That is what makes this series, a terrific one.Highly recommended.
