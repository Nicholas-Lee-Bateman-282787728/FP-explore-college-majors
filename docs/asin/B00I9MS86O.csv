The show is perfect but the Blue-ray stinks with security, it takes an incredible amount of time to get to watch this show actually so much time to start that I thought this was damaged, and for security reason it does not remember where you were from the last time, so you have to wait to start the show at every beginning.  Very bad form.

I don't watch too much TV, but I do believe this is the most interesting television character I've ever seen. In the first episode, Walt learns that he has terminal lung cancer. Therefore, he must - no, he decides to - cook crystal meth and leave behind a large sum of money for his family. So while being a meth cook is illegal and perhaps immoral, Walt's ultimate intentions are good... at least that's his point of view.Make no mistake, Mr. White is a bad guy - if you saw him in real life or read about him in the paper, you would absolutely say he should go to prison (or worse) without hesitating. But through the medium of television and the 50+ hour journey we've taken with the character, there are still moments where the audience can identify and sympathize with him. Despite all the despicable actions he has done and all the deception of those around him, I often still find myself rooting for Walt. I think this is due to the intelligent writing on the show as well as the amazing performance given by Bryan Cranston. I'm confident you will find this character as interesting as I do.There are two main types of narratives in TV. There's the plot-driven shows, where things move fast and there are mysteries to be solved - a lot of the enjoyment rides on the twists and turns in the story. Then there's the character-driven shows, that move more slowly - the characters are more realistic and well-rounded. &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; is a perfect example of how to simultaneously execute both types of storytelling - the interests of both plot and character coexist peacefully. The pacing is just right. There are many plot twists and surprises, but none of them render the show unrealistic. And above all, you care about the characters and find them fascinating. This series also plays with tension and conflict in a way that is rarely achieved in TV or film.If you think of yourself as a &#34;movie person&#34; more than a TV person, then this is your show. The production value rivals that of your average Hollywood feature film. The fact that the directors achieve this with only a fraction of the budget of a Hollywood movie makes the accomplishment all the more impressive. In particular, I would like to single out the cinematography of the show - the camera work on display is near perfect, especially the time-lapse and POV shots.Now at first glance, the story of a dying man with cancer, cooking meth, and depictions of drug use may sound unappealing and even offensive to some people on it's surface. But I'm confident that once you see the show you will understand how much more there is to the story and the characters, and drugs are never glorified. &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; is the type of show that my mother would hate on paper... but then she gives it a chance and winds up getting hooked!So if you've never seen the show, hopefully I convinced you to give it a chance. And if you're already fan of the show, now's the perfect time to watch it again - I've seen each episode a minimum of 3 times. I hope I shared what I think makes &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; special.",5,"Why You Should Watch ""Breaking Bad"" - Plus List of Blu-Ray Special Features",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,6855,"['34',

But buyers of the DVD complete series be aware that there are NO  ENGLISH  SUBTITLES.  So why am I griping about the lack of English subtitles?  Because beginning in the third year of the series much of the dialog is whispered and is VERY difficult to discern.  This is doubly true with regards to the Skylar character.  My review is for the DVD set  NOT  the Blu-Ray set.  I am told the Blu-Ray has English subtitles.This is a ten star series but the oversight of not having English subtitles devalues the production significantly.  If I had to do it over I would cough up the extra $35 and get the Blu-Ray set.  Buyer beware!UPDATE:  One reader inquired if I had turned the Subtitle function on which reminded me to include the following in my review above.  English is listed as one of the languages available for subtitles along with Spanish and French.  I activated it all to no avail.Therefore, if any reader has this DVD set and IS ABLE to use the English subtitle function please let me know so that I have a legitimate reason to return this set as being defective.

There were times when I watched 10 episodes, back-to-back. The picture quality on the DVD is excellent, I doubt that the Blu-ray would be that much better. Occasionally, the soundtrack is a little hard to decipher, even through my high end stereo system.

1693837,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00I9MS86O,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","A warning up front, this will contain some spoilerish material from the series, but no major giveaways.If you have never seen the series, but have heard about how good it is (as was the case for me when I bought the set) or had seen an episode or so during its original run on TV, but never really got into it, believe the hype.  The show is that good.  Whether you will consider it to be the best drama ever, is something that is totally subjective.  I do think the consensus, that it is certainly one of the best cable dramatic series in recent years, is correct.  Personally I think it can even hold its own when a discussion of some of the best television shows ever is had.It really is a show about the evolution of a criminal.  The basics of the story is that a high school science teacher, Walter White, played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston finds out he has cancer and ends up cooking crystal meth with a former student (played by Aaron Paul) of his.  He turns out to be so good at it, that he gets deeper and deeper into the criminal world.  It is really a show about his transition from a good guy who wants to make money for his family before he dies who finds out he is in over his head, to a truly despicable bad guy with very little in the way of redeeming qualities by the end of the show.  Throughout the series he has to balance his criminal life against his family life, which includes a DEA agent brother-in-law who unknowingly ends up hunting Walter.Cranston does a wonderful job of playing this evolving character, and with even all the bad that he has done by the end of the series manages to show a sliver of a decent human being in Walter.  One of the other core themes of the series was the relationship between Walter and Jesse.  It was a love-hate relationship from Jesse's perspective, and one that could swing from caring to complete use and manipulation from Walter's.  That I think, above all else, made the show work as well as it did.  That said all the other actors from Dean Norris, to Anna Gunn to Bob Odenkirk (who played the great smarmy lawyer Saul) were great.  The writing was also top notch.Each season was anywhere from about 8 to 13 episodes long.  There was always a main story that got tied up by the end, but every season usually also ended on a cliffhanger that would work into the next season.  With the shorter seasons they could get in and out of the stories quickly without letting things get too drawn out.As for the blu ray set itself, the show looks and sounds great as far as A/V quality goes.  Every disc has bonus features on them which range from ""Inside Breaking Bad"" featurettes on each episode which are the writers, directors and actors thoughts on each show, and making of features for most of the episodes, to video podcasts which were sit down roundtable discussions of many episodes with various writers, actors, directors  and producers.  There are also commentary tracks on many episodes as well as deleted and/or extended scenes on many episode.  Each season also has a gag reel, and there are several uncensored and/or extended episodes.  There is also a stand alone bonus disc that is exclusive to this set that has even more material on it (mostly making of a and behind the scenes material from the final season).  All in all, many hours of material beyond just the episodes themselves.  If you watch no other special feature, the alternate ending to the series is great, and very un-breaking bad like.The show may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you are thinking about getting the DVD or Blu Ray complete set I would say maybe stream the first couple episodes and if you love them, consider getting the set.  It is definitely not a happy show, and has a lot of morally gray characters.  In fact really the only character that stays likable all the way through is Walt Junior, the teenage son of the White family.  It is very suspenseful, very violent yet has some very very dark comedy (especially in the earlier seasons).  Main characters do get killed off from time to time, and there really is no happy ending.  But the journey the show takes you through (and you really do have to watch from beginning to end because the storytelling is not always linear)  is quite a ride.",5,The evolution of one of the great TV criminals,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,4256,"['warning', 'up', 'front', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilerish', 'material', 'series', 'major', 'giveaways.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'have', 'heard', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'case', 'when', 'bought', 'set', 'had', 'seen', 'episode', 'so', 'original', 'run', 'TV', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'believe', 'hype', 'show', 'good', 'will', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'drama', 'ever', 'something', 'totally', 'subjective', 'do', 'think', 'consensus', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'cable', 'dramatic', 'series', 'recent', 'years', 'correct', 'Personally', 'think', 'can', 'even', 'hold', 'own', 'when', 'discussion', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'ever', 'had.It', 'really', 'show', 'evolution', 'criminal', 'basics', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'Walter', 'White', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'out', 'cancer', 'up', 'cooking', 'crystal', 'meth', 'former', 'student', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'criminal', 'world', 'really', 'show', 'transition', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'make', 'money', 'family', 'who', 'out', 'head', 'truly', 'despicable', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'end', 'show', 'series', 'balance', 'criminal', 'life', 'family', 'life', 'DEA', 'agent', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'unknowingly', 'up', 'hunting', 'Walter.Cranston', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'evolving', 'character', 'even', 'bad', 'done', 'end', 'series', 'show', 'sliver', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'Walter', 'One', 'other', 'core', 'themes', 'series', 'was', 'relationship', 'Walter', 'Jesse', 'was', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Jesse', 'perspective', 'one', 'could', 'swing', 'caring', 'complete', 'use', 'manipulation', 'Walter', 'think', 'else', 'made', 'show', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'said', 'other', 'actors', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'who', 'played', 'great', 'smarmy', 'lawyer', 'Saul', 'were', 'great', 'writing', 'was', 'also', 'top', 'notch.Each', 'season', 'was', 'anywhere', 'about', '8', '13', 'episodes', 'long', 'was', 'always', 'main', 'story', 'got', 'tied', 'up', 'end', 'season', 'usually', 'also', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'would', 'work', 'next', 'season', 'shorter', 'seasons', 'could', 'get', 'stories', 'quickly', 'letting', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'drawn', 'out.As', 'blu', 'ray', 'set', 'show', 'great', 'as', 'far', 'A/V', 'quality', 'Every', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'range', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'episode', 'are', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'thoughts', 'show', 'making', 'features', 'most', 'episodes', 'video', 'podcasts', 'were', 'sit', 'down', 'roundtable', 'discussions', 'many', 'episodes', 'various', 'writers', 'actors', 'directors', 'producers', 'are', 'also', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'many', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'and/or', 'extended', 'scenes', 'many', 'episode', 'season', 'also', 'gag', 'reel', 'are', 'several', 'uncensored', 'and/or', 'extended', 'episodes', 'also', 'stand', 'alone', 'disc', 'exclusive', 'set', 'even', 'more', 'material', 'mostly', 'making', 'scenes', 'material', 'final', 'season', 'many', 'hours', 'material', 'just', 'episodes', 'watch', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'alternate', 'ending', 'series', 'great', 'very', 'un-breaking', 'bad', 'like.The', 'show', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'are', 'thinking', 'getting', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'complete', 'set', 'would', 'say', 'maybe', 'stream', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'love', 'consider', 'getting', 'set', 'definitely', 'not', 'happy', 'show', 'lot', 'morally', 'gray', 'characters', 'fact', 'really', 'only', 'character', 'likable', 'way', 'Walt', 'Junior', 'teenage', 'son', 'White', 'family', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'very', 'violent', 'yet', 'very', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'especially', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Main', 'characters', 'do', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'time', 'time', 'there', 'really', 'happy', 'ending', 'journey', 'show', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'storytelling', 'not', 'always', 'linear', 'quite', 'ride']",N/A

1693840,A2IK776FY6MEMG,B00I9MS86O,Skipjacks,"[0, 0]","This series is absolutely captivating. You can tell from the beginning that every detail is well thought out in advance and nothing in any scene is there by chance.Everything has some deeper meaning.It's not only a good story, but it's fun to explore the deeper meaning behind the details. The details in the setting, the story, the costumes, the props, etc.Colors play a huge role in the entire series, where the colors characters wear correspond to each person's emotional/moral state at that time. For example the more ethical/repentant Walter White is in an episode, the more green he wears. The more dark/selfish he is the more black he wears.The acting is superb. Each character really brings home his or her character. Aaron Paul (Jessie Pinkman) was so good the writers included him in the entire series, despite his character originally being schedule to drop out after season 1.If you are looking for something to binge watch, Breaking Bad is a great way to go. As soon as you complete an episode you want more, just like Walter's blue meth customers!Thank you for reading this review, and have an A-1 day!",5,What's my name?
