1057160,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000NJISJ8,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[1, 1]","""Still Number#1"" as Bill Cosby was so proud of noting during this time period this was the first season where their were serious changes in the works for the Huxtables. One of the most important things to note that's easy to notice actually is that during this time,all of the kids in this family were growing up. Lisa Bonet is out of the cast and maybe no one noticed but that rather smug picture frame ""gag"" during this seasons theme song kind of gives the impression that she won't be entirely missed by at least one cast member. Either way Denise not being present to a huge extent during this season changed some of the dynamics. First off we start off with the fact that the the newly married Sondra and Elvin (Geoffrey Owens officially joined the cast this season) surprise the Huxtable parents when they decide to blow off graduate school to open up a wilderness store. This seperates Sondra from her usual characterization of being the ""most like her parents"" on the education front and builds on some of her earlier advocasy of Denise ""taking some time to live life"" after high school. An ongoing plot point this season finds the couple involved in living in a slummy apartment and that provides some mildly funny moments. But overall this sets the tone for season. There are a lot of episodes in this season that look to take on serious issues. The relationship between Theo and Cockroach in downplayed as Theo himself is now in a basically adult body but as another reviewer pointed out ""not quite funny as a man"" yet.That is until Cockroach appruptly disappears,all over a haircut disagreement with Cosby so the story goes and Theo is left with a new group of friends one of whom is played by a young Adam Sandler as Smitty. This is all after the great episode ""Dance Mania"" as Theo and Cockroach become temporary rivals over an appearance on a Soul Train-like TV show. The character of Theo also faces an issue of one of cancer with another of his friends later on in the season. Rudy's growing pains are even more obvious.In one episode she weeps to ""It's Not Easy Being Green"",lamenting her awkward transitional stage to cute kid to preteen and there were signs the transition wasn't easy for her. She's lost in a mall too and then is reciting a story about her perceptions of war in the funny and also touching episode ""Once Upon A Time"". This makes for a season that doesn't always have the warm heartedness and laughs of earlier reasons but is more about a group of young people confronting the joys and pains of time and aging.",4,The Cosby Show Enters Middle Age,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,2547,"['Still', 'Number', '1', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'was', 'so', 'proud', 'noting', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'were', 'serious', 'changes', 'works', 'Huxtables', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'note', 'easy', 'notice', 'actually', 'time', 'kids', 'family', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'cast', 'maybe', 'one', 'noticed', 'rather', 'smug', 'picture', 'frame', 'gag', 'seasons', 'theme', 'song', 'kind', 'impression', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'entirely', 'missed', 'least', 'one', 'cast', 'member', 'way', 'Denise', 'not', 'being', 'present', 'huge', 'extent', 'season', 'changed', 'dynamics', 'First', 'start', 'fact', 'newly', 'married', 'Sondra', 'Elvin', 'Geoffrey', 'Owens', 'officially', 'joined', 'cast', 'season', 'surprise', 'Huxtable', 'parents', 'when', 'decide', 'blow', 'off', 'graduate', 'school', 'open', 'up', 'wilderness', 'store', 'Sondra', 'usual', 'characterization', 'being', 'most', 'parents', 'education', 'front', 'builds', 'earlier', 'advocasy', 'Denise', 'taking', 'time', 'live', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'point', 'season', 'couple', 'involved', 'living', 'slummy', 'apartment', 'mildly', 'funny', 'moments', 'overall', 'tone', 'season', 'are', 'lot', 'episodes', 'season', 'take', 'serious', 'issues', 'relationship', 'Theo', 'Cockroach', 'downplayed', 'Theo', 'now', 'basically', 'adult', 'body', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'not', 'quite', 'funny', 'man', 'yet.That', 'Cockroach', 'appruptly', 'haircut', 'disagreement', 'Cosby', 'story', 'Theo', 'left', 'new', 'group', 'friends', 'one', 'whom', 'played', 'young', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Smitty', 'great', 'episode', 'Dance', 'Mania', 'Theo', 'Cockroach', 'become', 'temporary', 'rivals', 'appearance', 'Soul', 'Train-like', 'TV', 'show', 'character', 'Theo', 'also', 'issue', 'one', 'cancer', 'friends', 'later', 'season', 'Rudy', 'growing', 'pains', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'obvious.In', 'one', 'episode', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Being', 'Green', 'lamenting', 'awkward', 'transitional', 'stage', 'cute', 'kid', 'preteen', 'were', 'signs', 'transition', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'lost', 'mall', 'too', 'then', 'reciting', 'story', 'perceptions', 'war', 'funny', 'also', 'touching', 'episode', 'Once', 'Time', 'season', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'warm', 'heartedness', 'laughs', 'earlier', 'reasons', 'more', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'confronting', 'joys', 'pains', 'time', 'aging']",The Cosby Show: Season 4
1057161,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000NJISJ8,andy8047,"[2, 4]","Fans of NBC's The Cosby Show will be able to double their viewing pleasure since this item will be released along with the Season 3 set on June 5. For this season,it's goodbye Lisa Bonet and hello Geoffrey Owens. In this season which premiered on September 24,1987,Owens,who made several recurring guest appearances during seasons 2 and 3,is inaugurated as a regular into the cast. Elvin Tibidaux(Owens) and Sondra Huxtable(Sabrina LeBeauf) are now husband and wife and in the season premiere,they return to Brooklyn from their honeymoon only to meet Sondra's disappointed parents when they learn that she and Elvin dropped out of Princeton University and decided to discontinue studying medicine. Clair(Phylicia Rashad) demanded every cent of the tuition money back($8,000 estimate)! Cliff(Bill Cosby) even bought a stethescope as a welcome home gift for Elvin. In the opening montage,the cast,including Owens and minus Bonet,are elegantly dressed and are dancing again,this time to a new theme with vocals by Bobby McFerrin*. Cosby is seen holding a black-and-white photo of ""dead"" Bonet. Malcolm Jamal Warner,who was quite rhythmic in the season 2 and 3 opening montages,only shuffles one of his feet after looking at his wrist watch. Owens comes along and kisses LeBeauf's hand. Tempest Bledsoe at first appears aggravated but proceeds to gradually shuffle her body. Keshia Knight Pulliam is brought to the camera lens by Cosby,then she flashes her toothy grin. Here's what else we'll see this season:Elvin's and Sondra's new apartment,despite a few flaws,Rudy(KKP) studying the violin without choice,Clair finding magazines filled with half-naked women in them in Theo's(MJW) possession and Theo,ready to attend his high school senior prom but doesn't(along with a few buddies,one of them being portrayed by Adam Sandler). Bonet moved on to continue playing her character Denise on the spinoff A DIFFERENT WORLD which premiered along with this season. But she recurred the character during this season and the next. *Bobby McFerrin rose to fame with his #1 self-penned hit DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY in 1988.

1057162,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B000NJISJ8,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[3, 4]","Season four's box set is identical to season three's, with the same unfortunate disappointments. Each disc is place in its separate slim case, and yet again no bonus material. But of course the main reason to buy this set is for the episodes and it is nice to have season four out on DVD. You can definitely tell the Huxtable kids are growing up, so the episode plots started to change gradually. There were a few big changes to the show in season four. Elvin and Sondra are married, but unfortunately Lisa Bonet (Denise) is not in season four because she was working on another show called ""A Different World"" which follows her experiences at Hillman College. But other than that, this season is fantastic and it was a great excitement when I first received it. I really enjoyed the episode ""Once Upon a Time"", it was a unique episode to the series because it pretty much takes place in Rudy's fantasy. But there are many great episodes from season four since there are no episode descriptions available for season four, I'll list them below.Call of the Wild - Airdate: 9/24/1987 - The newlywed Sondra and Elvin return from their honeymoon with shocking news for Cliff and Clair; they want to abandon their dreams of being a lawyer and doctor and open a wilderness store.Theogate - Airdate: 10/1/1987 - Theo and Cockroach come home unusually late from a track meet.It Ain't Easy Being Green - Airdate: 10/8/1987 - Rudy wants to wear summer clothes in fall to a party but Clair won't let her.Cliff's Mistake - Airdate: 10/15/1987 - While setting up the house as a haunted house for Halloween, Cliff discovers he's lost a power drill that his neighbor loaned to him.Shakespeare - Airdate: 10/22/1987 - Theo must read Julius Caesar for school, but complains that it is boring.That's Not What I Said - Airdate: 10/29/1987 - Cliff and Clair have an argument after Theo gets detained by police for riding in a car with an unlicensed driver.Autumn Gifts - Airdate: 11/5/1987 - Rudy goes to an older widowed lady's house each afternoon to have tea and play cards, but notices that she refuses to take her daily medication for diabetes. She tells Cliff, who devises a plan to try to convince her that she needs to take her medication.Looking Back (Part One) - Airdate: 11/12/1987 - Sondra and Elvin have their first marital fight, and Elvin comes to the Huxtable house for comfort and support. Clair shares about the difficulties in their house as flashbacks are shown.Looking Back (Part Two) - Airdate: 11/12/1987 - Flashbacks are shown while history is shared with Elvin.Where's Rudy - Airdate: 11/19/1987 - Theo and Vanessa lose track of Rudy in a mall while Clair enters a squash exhibition.Dance Mania - Airdate: 12/3/1987 - Theo and Cockroach have tickets to appear on television on the dance show ""Dance Mania"", but are told that only one of them can enter the studio during the filming because of fire laws. Theo miscalculates by offering to let Cockroach go in (thinking he'll refuse) and gets angry when Cockroach takes him up on the offer.The Locker Room - Airdate: 12/10/1987 - Theo and his classmates brag about their dates with girls in the locker room, but Theo's mood changes when one of the guys goes out with Vanessa and brags about it the next day.The Show Must Go On - Airdate: 12/17/1987 - Vaudeville is shown to Rudy and her friends, who are unimpressed.Bookworm - Airdate: 1/7/1988 - Clair drags Cliff to her book club meeting, but he's the lone male there. Much to Clair's surprise, Cliff knows quite a bit about the book in question! Meanwhile, the kids attempt a sleepover at Sondra and Elvin's run-down studio apartment, but are overwhelmed by the noise and lack of utilities.Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star - Airdate: 1/14/1988 - Rudy has to play the violin in music class at school, but gets jealous because she thinks her classmates' instruments are more fun.The Visit - Airdate: 1/21/1988 - Theo visits a friend in the hospital who has cancer.The Drum Major - Airdate: 2/4/1988 - Vanessa tries out for the drum major at school.Waterworks - Airdate: 2/11/1988 - Clair tries to stop Cliff from fixing a leaky pipe by hiring a team of professionals.Once Upon a Time - Airdate: 2/18/1988 - Rudy writes a fairy tale, and the colorful story is acted out in her fantasy.Petanque - Airdate: 2/25/1988 - Cliff and a friend play Petanque.Trust Me - Airdate: 3/3/1988 - A friend of Clair's is having marital problems.Home for the Weekend - Airdate: 3/17/1988 - Denise comes home from college, but seems to have more time for her friends than for her family.The Prom - Airdate: 3/24/1988 - Theo and his friends go to great lengths to impress their dates for the senior prom but fail disastrously.Gone Fishin' - Airdate: 4/29/1988 - When the Huxtable men go fishing, Theo catches the dead body of a gangster that the police have been chasing, and soon attracts attention from the news media. This success goes to his head, while Rudy and Kenny find a nest of baby birds, but the mother bird is missing. The two stories eventually cross in a surprising-and rather humiliating-lesson for Theo.Season four's DVD release is similar to season three's and has the same disappointments but it's still highly recommended.",4,The Cosby Show Season Four,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,5220,"['Season', 'four', 'box', 'set', 'identical', 'season', 'three', 'same', 'unfortunate', 'disappointments', 'disc',

1057167,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B000NJISJ8,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[6, 6]","In retrospect, this is one of the more interesting seasons.  When the show begins, we notice one person missing from the original cast, Lisa Bonet.  (She only appears in picture form during the title sequence.)  Where has she gone?  Off to the west coast set of A Different World for the popular spin-off's first season.  Dear Lisa would only appear as a guest star on two new episodes, ""Shakespere"" and ""Home for the Weekend.""  (That doesn't include the fantastic slection of previous footage illuded to in the 2-part ""Looking Back"" collage.)Instead of seeing Lisa, we witness the introduction of Geoffrey Owens to the regular cast, portraying Elvin Tibbadeaux, who is now married to the oldest Huxtable child, Sondra.  They've decided not to pursue their previous career interests and devote themselves to running their own wilderness supply store.  This venture presents a recurring topic throughout this season, as well as the first season of A Different World.Meanwhile, the Huxtable ship keeps sailing with Theo completing his turbulent high school career, Vanessa's boyfriend list expanding, Rudy wanting to wear the wrong clothes and Cliff losing his memory.  Among the celebrity guest stars are Christopher Plummer, Adam Sandler (as a recurring character) and Wallice Shaun (also recurring).

1057174,A3EI013D39PC1T,B000NJISJ8,"M. Hummel ""mh1957""","[9, 14]","Season 4 is where the Cosby Show ""jumps the shark"" and loses its focus.  A show where the dad was determined to maintain his authority (along with his wife) in order to teach the kids turns into a bad version of The Brady Bunch.The character of Rudy, so cute in Season 1, and a little cute in Season 2, is more annoying (in a bratty, precocious sort of way) than anything else in Season 4.  Denise is gone (spun off to Different World, but also out of the cast because actress Lisa Bonet had lost favor with Cosby himself, and rightly so); Theo has finally grown out of his cracked voice funniness and is not yet funny as a man; the underused and underappreciated subtlety of Vanessa has been replaced by a misguided attempt at glamorizing her character; and extremely funny Elvin with the passable Sondra are consistently underused.One example says it all for me:  In ""Home for the Weekend,"" Denise basically stiffs her family to hang out and party all night long with friends.  Instead of the parents pulling rank as they always do and teaching Denise that she still owes her family loyalty and time, they do a sitcom prank of ignoring her, then avoid any confrontation at all by giving in.  The writing is thin this time around, perhaps because several of the creative staff were either shifted to or doubling up on Different World.  There's not nearly enough of Cliff and Claire as a couple, always a great feature.  And Cliff and his father need to be in more episodes together.Formula plots the show did well before are full of missed opportunities.  And the show seems to let Theo show off his body inappropriately in one episode (what on earth is he doing in a towel (no pants!) with two older women in ""Water Works""?  And why doesn't Cliff come down harder on him for it?  The firm and benign teaching we counted on from Cliff and Claire is replaced by silly sitcom banter.I don't remember later seasons all that well, but I hope they found their way back to the things that made the show great--the parenting, Cliff and Claire, the extended family, and Vanessa and Theo being funny, but maybe those two hit the child actor wall this year and didn't get it back.  Rudy is beyond saving by Season 4--why is she so relentlessly bratty?  Vanessa and Theo are my favorite kids, and while Theo tries to show some range in Season 4, it doesn't always work.  Plus, just give me more Cosby doing his shtick!Also, two episodes given over to guest stars just don't work--one with Bill Irwin (an entire show set in a broken down vaudeville revue) and one called ""Drum Major.""  What were they thinking?I do recall there's more with Elvin and Sondra later, and Elvin is just plain funny, so let's look out for those in the future.  Shows with kids as stars are hard to keep fresh when the kids change and lose their cuteness, and that's what seems to be happening here.  Too bad--but Seasons 1 and 2 are still great fun, along with most of Season 3 (although the absence of Claire for one-third of the episodes due to Phylicia Rashad's maternity situation really hurt Season 3).As for the lack of extras, that's been a consistent failing of the DVDs of this show, and it's probably not going to change.  Why there were no commentaries from the cast at any point in this DVD series, and zero participation from Dr. Cosby or Ms. Rashad would be interesting to learn, but I'm guessing it's cheapness on the distribution end, something which has plagued many other DVD sets of quality shows.",2,"Uh-Oh, the Kids Aren't So Funny Any More",1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,3483,"['Season', '4', 'where', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'shark', 'focus', 'show', 'where', 'dad', 'was', 'determined', 'maintain', 'authority', 'wife', 'order', 'teach', 'kids', 'bad', 'version', 'Brady', 'Bunch.The', 'character', 'Rudy', 'so', 'cute', 'Season', '1', 'little', 'cute', 'Season', '2', 'more', 'annoying', 'bratty', 'precocious', 'sort', 'way', 'anything', 'else', 'Season', '4', 'Denise', 'gone', 'spun', 'off', 'Different', 'World', 'also', 'cast', 'actress', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'had', 'lost', 'favor', 'Cosby', 'rightly', 'so', 'Theo', 'finally', 'grown', 'cracked', 'voice', 'funniness', 'not', 'yet', 'funny', 'man', 'underused', 'underappreciated', 'subtlety', 'Vanessa', 'been', 'replaced', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'glamorizing', 'character', 'extremely', 'funny', 'Elvin', 'passable', 'Sondra', 'are', 'consistently', 'underused.One', 'example', 'Home', 'Weekend', 'Denise', 'basically', 'stiffs', 'family', 'hang', 'out', 'party', 'night', 'long', 'friends', 'Instead', 'parents', 'pulling', 'rank', 'always', 'do', 'teaching', 'Denise', 'still', 'family', 'loyalty', 'time', 'do', 'sitcom', 'prank', 'ignoring', 'then', 'confrontation', 'giving', 'writing', 'time', 'around', 'perhaps', 'several', 'creative', 'staff', 'were', 'either', 'shifted', 'doubling', 'up', 'Different', 'World', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'Cliff', 'Claire', 'couple', 'always', 'great', 'feature', 'Cliff', 'father', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'episodes', 'together.Formula', 'show', 'did', 'well', 'before', 'are', 'full', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'show', 'let', 'Theo', 'show', 'off', 'body', 'inappropriately', 'one', 'episode', 'what', 'earth', 'doing', 'towel', 'pants', 'two', 'older', 'women', 'Water', 'Works', 'why', ""n't"", 'Cliff', 'come', 'down', 'harder', 'firm', 'benign', 'teaching', 'counted', 'Cliff', 'Claire', 'replaced', 'silly', 'sitcom', 'banter.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'later', 'seasons', 'well', 'hope', 'found', 'way', 'back', 'things', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'parenting', 'Cliff', 'Claire', 'extended', 'family', 'Vanessa', 'Theo', 'being', 'funny', 'maybe', 'two', 'hit', 'child', 'actor', 'wall', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'Rudy', 'saving', 'Season', '4', 'why', 'so', 'relentlessly', 'bratty', 'Vanessa', 'Theo', 'are', 'favorite', 'kids', 'Theo', 'show', 'range', 'Season', '4', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'just', 'give', 'more', 'Cosby', 'doing', 'shtick', 'Also', 'two', 'episodes', 'given', 'guest', 'stars', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'one', 'Bill', 'Irwin', 'entire', 'show', 'set', 'broken', 'down', 'vaudeville', 'revue', 'one', 'called', 'Drum', 'Major', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'do', 'recall', 'more', 'Elvin', 'Sondra', 'later', 'Elvin', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'let', 'look', 'out', 'future', 'kids', 'stars', 'are', 'hard', 'keep', 'fresh', 'when', 'kids', 'change', 'lose', 'cuteness', 'what', 'be', 'happening', 'here', 'Too', 'bad', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'fun', 'most', 'Season', '3', 'absence', 'Claire', 'one-third', 'episodes', 'due', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'maternity', 'situation', 'really', 'hurt', 'Season', '3', '.As', 'lack', 'extras', 'been', 'consistent', 'failing', 'DVDs', 'show', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'Why', 'were', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'point', 'DVD', 'series', 'zero', 'participation', 'Dr.', 'Cosby', 'Ms.', 'Rashad', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'learn', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'cheapness', 'distribution', 'end', 'something', 'plagued', 'many', 'other', 'DVD', 'sets', 'quality', 'shows']",The Cosby Show: Season 4

On this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised to see what I believe is the ONLY episode of the Cosby Show that I'd never seen, and how fitting of it to be about a book club. ""Bookworm"" was my favorite episode on the entire DVD, and I rewatched it so I could laugh at Cosby's secret at the book club meeting, especially when he rolled his eyes after giving a page number. Classic! However, I was dead tired and bored to tears with the ""Shakespeare"" episode. I don't know why the writers thought enacting scenes from ""Shakespeare"" would make a good episode. I couldn't stand reading the stuff in high school and college (and I did understand it), so I definitely didn't want to see it on a show that I did enjoy. I thought ""The Locker Room"" was an interesting episode because it didn't end the way I expected it to, but it was extremely true to reality.  This was a pretty good season. I liked the ones when Rudy was older much better, and this season makes me wish ""A Different World: Season 2"" would resurface, so I can buy it.

The fourth season of The Cosby Show starred Bill Cosby as Dr. Cliff Huxtable, Phylicia Rashad as Clair Huxtable, Sabrina LeBeauf as Sondra Huxtable-Tibideaux, Geoffrey Owens as Elvin Tibideaux, Malcolm-Jamal Warner as Theo Huxtable, Tempestt Bledsoe as Vanessa Huxtable, and Keshia Knight Pulliam as Rudy Huxtable. Season 4 continued to focus on doctor Cliff Huxtable and his attorney wife, Clair, raising their five children in Brooklyn, New York. The children consisted of the now-married, college graudate Sondra, married to the nerdy Elvin Tibideaux, the now-mature 17 year-old girl-crazy Theo, who enters his final year of high school, 14 year-old, boy crazy Vanessa, who enters her first year of high school, and silly, fun-loving 8 year-old Rudy. In season four, the Huxtables dealt with Sondra and Elvin dropping out of graduate school and opening a wilderness store, Rudy getting lost in a mall, Theo tries to cope with his friend being diagnosed with cancer, and Vanessa is the victim of sexism. Recurring characters this season include Denise Huxtable (played by Lisa Bonet), Cliff and Clair's second daughter who is off at college, Russell and Anna Huxtable (played by Earle Hyman and Clarice Taylor), Cliff's parents, Walter ""Cockroach"" Bradley (played by Carl Payne), Theo's mischievous scheming partner, Justine Phillips (played by Michelle Thomas), Theo's crush, Peter (played by Peter Costa), the Huxtable's neighbor and Rudy's shy and quiet friend, famous for running out of the house in times of trouble, and Kenny aka ""Bud,"" Rudy's loud and chaunvinistic ""boy"" friend. Season two was placed at #1 in the summer of 1985 in the Nielsen Ratings, marking the beginnings of the series five-year streak as the number one show in America. Season three was placed at #1 in the summer of 1987 and season four was #1 in the summer of 1988. On June 5, 2007, First Look Studios released The Cosby Show Season 3 and The Cosby Show Season 4 on DVD. This is my review of Season 4. The show itself this season is a step down from the previous season due to lack of Denise, but extra emphasis on Sondra and Elvin makes up for it. There are more guest stars this season, including Adam Sandler, Angela Bassett and Lisa Bonet. First Look have decided not to put any bonus features into this set. The set is really cheap-looking when it comes to the packaging. The first two seasons had a Digipak cardboard foldout design. Seasons three and four use three slim cases, one for each disc. Season four has brown cases and the discs all look the same. They have the same image as the front cover art: Cliff standing in a white background with a brown bar at the top saying Season 4. Disc 1 contains episodes 1-7. Disc 2 contains episodes 8-15. Disc 3 contains episodes 16-23. The menus are nice. The menus are brown and play the season four theme song (a tap dance theme). You can't play all of the episodes at once like the first two seasons. You have to play them individually. There are 24 episodes this season (""Looking Back"" is a 2-part episode and it is seen in its original one-episode format).
