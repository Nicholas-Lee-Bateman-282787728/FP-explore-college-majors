The moves do take a number of tries to learn, but once learned, it's a blast. The workout goes by really fast. Note: As part of the ""blast-off"" series, this DVD is shorter in length than some of his other DVDs. Also, I can't fast forward on my copy, which I think is because this was converted from VHS. Even despite these drawbacks, it's my very favorite of the Richard Simmons. Especially for Disco lovers. btw-- the young woman in the purple top and black shorts is so energetic and pretty -- I like to watch her during the workout.",5,This one has really grown on me,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,666,"['have', '10', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'DVDs', 'always', 'seem', 'return', 'one', 'exercise', 'most', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'moves', 'do', 'take', 'number', 'tries', 'learn', 'once', 'learned', 'blast', 'workout', 'really', 'fast', 'Note', 'part', 'blast-off', 'series', 'DVD', 'shorter', 'length', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fast', 'forward', 'copy', 'think', 'was', 'converted', 'VHS', 'Even', 'drawbacks', 'very', 'favorite', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'Especially', 'Disco', 'lovers', 'btw', 'young', 'woman', 'purple', 'top', 'black', 'shorts', 'so', 'energetic', 'pretty', 'like', 'watch', 'workout']",N/A
722484,A11I30TC4BNKT6,B00006RCQF,B. Quark,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this tape because it has invigorating music to which every muscle in the body is exercised. Richard Simmons leads you step by step, alternating different levels and speeds of exercise. There are ample cooling down periods, so that overexercise is prevented.  The exercises shown can be done in 5, 10, or 15 minute intervals. There is even a condition check so that you know when to stop. Recommended to everyone who would like to lose weight, tone, or just keep in shape while having fun dancing.",5,Richard Simmons VHS Can Help You Lose Weight with Fun-filled Dancing,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,513,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'tape', 'invigorating', 'music', 'muscle', 'body', 'exercised', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'step', 'step', 'alternating', 'different', 'levels', 'speeds', 'exercise', 'are', 'ample', 'cooling', 'down', 'periods', 'overexercise', 'prevented', 'exercises', 'shown', 'can', 'be', 'done', '5', '10', '15', 'minute', 'intervals', 'even', 'condition', 'check', 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'Recommended', 'everyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'lose', 'weight', 'tone', 'just', 'keep', 'shape', 'having', 'fun', 'dancing']",N/A

The one thing that I like about Disco Sweat is that, although it can be fast, the routines are a bit longer.  Blast Off changes very quickly.  It's alot of fun though and it is definitely challenging.

If you easily follow quick and frequent changes, you'll do better than I did.  But I could not keep up with the quick pace and complex workout on this tape.

722488,A13700AF4X40YG,B00006RCQF,Loves Books in MD,"[19, 19]","Not to contradict the prior reviewer, but after fumbling through the typical first run-through of any new exercise video, I found this one fairly easy to follow.As with all the other Richard Simmons videos I've done, this one is fun, set to contagious great music that makes you want to move, the exercisers all appear to be having a genuinely good time and Richard Simmons is his usual energetic, motivational and funny self.  In typical fashion, Richard uses names for the moves that are both descriptive and make me laugh - one sequence in particular from this one is a scream - ""dance"" (as if you're being lead in a tango), ""hug"" (arms wrapped around yourself) and ""hair"" (arm bent at elbow and moved from front of head to back) - who else but Richard Simmons?The 40 minutes is comprised of a warm up/workout/cool down that runs about 30 minutes, followed by a toning portion using wrist weights that lasts about 10 minutes.  The moves are easy to do and can be performed at whatever amount of intensity or energy that fits your level of fitness - you can turn it up or down to meet your needs.After years of being an inconsistent exerciser, I decided to give it one more try and started using a Richard Simmons tape (Sweat & Tone, which I highly recommend for toning) and got hooked.  For the first time in my life, I actually look forward to exercising, have lost weight (am dieting too), and feel so much better and more energetic!  I'm in the process of buying every Simmons video/DVD I can get.  In all honesty, I never took him seriously until I did one of his tapes and my only regret is that I didn't wise up sooner.",5,Fun and Easy to Follow,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,1628,"['Not', 'contradict', 'prior', 'reviewer', 'fumbling', 'typical', 'first', 'run-through', 'new', 'exercise', 'video', 'found', 'one', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow.As', 'other', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'done', 'one', 'fun', 'set', 'contagious', 'great', 'music', 'want', 'move', 'exercisers', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'genuinely', 'good', 'time', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'usual', 'energetic', 'motivational', 'funny', 'self', 'typical', 'fashion', 'Richard', 'names', 'moves', 'are', 'descriptive', 'make', 'one', 'sequence', 'particular', 'one', 'scream', 'dance', ""'re"", 'being', 'lead', 'tango', 'hug', 'arms', 'wrapped', 'hair', 'arm', 'bent', 'elbow', 'moved', 'front', 'head', 'back', 'who', 'else', 'Richard', 'Simmons', '40', 'minutes', 'comprised', 'warm', 'up/workout/cool', 'down', '30', 'minutes', 'followed', 'toning', 'portion', 'using', 'wrist', 'weights', '10', 'minutes', 'moves', 'are', 'easy', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'performed', 'amount', 'intensity', 'energy', 'level', 'fitness', 'can', 'turn', 'up', 'down', 'meet', 'needs.After', 'years', 'being', 'inconsistent', 'exerciser', 'decided', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'try', 'started', 'using', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'tape', 'Sweat', 'Tone', 'highly', 'recommend', 'toning', 'got', 'hooked', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'actually', 'look', 'forward', 'exercising', 'have', 'lost', 'weight', 'am', 'dieting', 'too', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'energetic', ""'m"", 'process', 'buying', 'Simmons', 'can', 'get', 'honesty', 'never', 'took', 'seriously', 'did', 'one', 'tapes', 'only', 'regret', 'did', ""n't"", 'wise', 'up', 'sooner']",N/A

Not that you're not supposed to sweat in the video, but it was just kind of gross - especially one of the men in there with hairy pits.
