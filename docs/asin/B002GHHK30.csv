1267505,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B002GHHK30,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","I am surprised to admit that I, for the most part, highly enjoyed this film. In short, a group of college kids decide to investigate rumors of a strange community within a disconnected (from the real world) farm community, only to find the rumors are very true.  While the essential premise has been repeated at nauseam in many other movies, this one was executed pretty well, well enough to certainly justify a rental. The scenes leading up to the actual on-screen action (necessitated by the horror elements) do a great job of building tension and setting an ominous mood.  The actual action-horror scenes are very good too; they slowly introduce and reveal the monster characters with a strong visual impact and do not overdo it.  Far too many mutant/monster movies grossly overdo the monster to the point of annoying absurdity, not so here.  My primary complaint is the awful Indian guy.  The cast is primarily 4 college kids, 3 of which mesh well together and have generally good on-screen chemistry.  Not so for the Indian kid.  His acting skills are on par with that of a rock, and he certainly breathes the same level of life into his character, a completely boring, empty, flat guy whose jokes and pitiful attempts at acting like a cool american kid are shamelessly artificial.  That notwithstanding, the movie overcomes this awful casting decision and provides a highly enjoyable movie that does not overdo the gore.",3,Surprisingly Enjoyable,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,1426,"['am', 'surprised', 'admit', 'most', 'part', 'highly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'short', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'decide', 'investigate', 'rumors', 'strange', 'community', 'disconnected', 'real', 'world', 'farm', 'community', 'only', 'find', 'rumors', 'are', 'very', 'true', 'essential', 'premise', 'been', 'repeated', 'nauseam', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'executed', 'pretty', 'well', 'well', 'enough', 'certainly', 'justify', 'rental', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'actual', 'on-screen', 'action', 'necessitated', 'horror', 'elements', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'tension', 'setting', 'ominous', 'mood', 'actual', 'action-horror', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'slowly', 'introduce', 'reveal', 'monster', 'characters', 'strong', 'visual', 'impact', 'do', 'not', 'overdo', 'Far', 'too', 'many', 'mutant/monster', 'movies', 'grossly', 'monster', 'point', 'annoying', 'absurdity', 'not', 'so', 'here', 'My', 'primary', 'complaint', 'awful', 'Indian', 'guy', 'cast', 'primarily', '4', 'college', 'kids', '3', 'mesh', 'well', 'together', 'have', 'generally', 'good', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Not', 'so', 'Indian', 'kid', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'par', 'rock', 'certainly', 'same', 'level', 'life', 'character', 'completely', 'boring', 'empty', 'flat', 'guy', 'jokes', 'pitiful', 'attempts', 'acting', 'cool', 'american', 'kid', 'are', 'shamelessly', 'artificial', 'notwithstanding', 'movie', 'awful', 'casting', 'decision', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'overdo', 'gore']",N/A

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Albino Farm is exactly the reason horror movies aren't as fun to watch today as they used to be- these days -more often than not- it's always about a group of teens driving to some deserted location in the hopes of finding out about a legend, only to get attacked and horrified in some way after a thorough investigation.This movie has flaws out the wazoo.  For one thing the first half of the film is devoted NOT to building a dramatic, suspenseful theme, but teens walking or driving around doing virtually nothing constructive.  Case in point, these teens drive through the town, see a person scooping a dead animal off the streets before running off to the woods.  Seems enticing, but... that's the last interesting thing that happens for a while.Instead the teens realize they have a flat tire and need to visit a nearby garage for a tire change.  The guy at the tire shop?  You may have guessed it- he has a spooky voice and looks scruffy and somewhat scary but... he's the one filling in the teens with information about the farm they're seeking.  Predictable direction and execution.  Later, the teens meet a crazy religious guy that utters nonsense and makes the teens somewhat annoyed and frightened once again (and for anyone who's seen more than 50 horror movies, stumbling upon a weirdo is one of the most predictable cliches ever) and when they arrive in town they come upon a child who's never as creepy as you're hoping for (sorry but it's true) and an old lady who's reluctant to speak about the actual Albino Farm when confronted.When the teens finally make the trip to the farm and discover the disfigured people are all too real, it never improves even though the overlong, dreaded wait you have to sit through for 40 minutes most certainly *should* lead to something that qualifies as an improvement.  So you have a pointless first half of a film and... a pointless second half making for a pointless movie overall.The actual albino people are never terrifying.  In fact they're never even utilized in a terrifying way because it's all about quirky camera movements making it clear that an attack is happening (due to the teens screaming for their lives) but never showing you anything.  I'm not even sure if these monsters are albino- they're definitely generic and boring though.If my words aren't clear enough, trust me, it's a VERY cliched film.I was hoping the twist would be every single teen dies and the bad guys win but... nope. I was also hoping -being a WWE fan- that Chris Jericho would save the day in some way.  Instead, he stars as a laidback party-type that does nothing but sits around and acts like a bum by criticizing the insistent teens who are eager to visit the farm.

Powers ""show maniac""","[4, 6]","I knew nothing about this movie but I saw it in Blockbuster and on the cover someone is holding a grappling hook, and I thought, Hmmm, maybe this could be interesting. So I went in with low expectations and it didn't even meet those.For starters, I think the ""Wrong Turn"" well has been dipped into once too often. It would appear every time anyone in America ventures into a wooded area they are going to be set-on by a pack of mutant, redneck cannibals. Well I guess this time they stirred the well-water some and made them Albino,  mutant redneck cannibals.There is a legend that deep in the Ozarks is an Albino Farm. That's it. Are they farmers? What do they do? Do they slop the cows and milk the pigs?Two college-age couples decide to investigate. These four share a quarter each of the same brain. Close to their destination they begin to meet up with an odd assortment of country folk including a character who flicks lit cigarettes at them and a albino, mutant, redneck dwarf who scrapes up roadkill for lunch.They get to a weirdly under-populated town(budget problems I would guess) and the couples split up and try to find directions to the farm.  One couple approach a stretch limousine(?) and the driver and his front seat passenger are Siamese twins.  The backseat passenger is the cigarette flicker with his long, red greasy hair, red-circled eyelids and teeth with insect parts on them.  Ciggie says he knows the way to the farm and tells the couple to hop in and they do.  (See what I mean about a quarter of a brain each)The rest of the movie involves the shenanigans with the albinos but the movie by then is so dark it would appear Stevie Wonder was the cameraman and he forgot to take the cover off the lens. One survivor manages to escape and she ends up at a revival tent meeting. She thinks she's safe but the congregation are the townfolk and they turn out to be deformed, crazed, bible thumpers-even the siamese twins and bug teeth are there, led by an albino, Billy Graham type preacher.Avoid this at all costs, it sounds like fun but even the sound was edited in a cement mixer.

1267515,A1M0YAZ6JV488Z,B002GHHK30,"Tom's Reviews ""Tom Hunter""","[0, 2]","First off - this is definitely not a four star movie (as one person rated it), unless you are measuring it against other c-horror (straight to video, no budget, community college actor films). It is a solid two star c-horror flick, however, as it is of higher quality all around than most in its class. On a positive note, the creature/albinos makeup was quite good. And the male lead plays the role of a complete and utter jerk to perfection - you will spend half the movie wishing someone would just punch him in the face...repeatedly. I won't spoil anything here, but his fate in the movie was perhaps my favorite moment. One major problem was the male co-star who is of Indian descent. Normally, that's not something that has any impact on the film in a negative way (Harold and Kumar are a good example). However, this guy's accent is so bad, you will feel like you are watching Apu from The Simpsons every five minutes - his accent is almost identical. That makes the character a major distraction, thus impeding the overall flow of the movie. I can't recommend this one, but you could definitely do worse if you enjoy c-horror. A quote I found on another site sums this one up best: ""This is a prime example of a good concept combining with mid-range acting talents and fair film work to make a horrible movie.""",2,Apu Comes to C-Horror!,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,1318,"['First', 'off', 'definitely', 'not', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'one', 'person', 'rated', 'are', 'measuring', 'other', 'c-horror', 'straight', 'video', 'budget', 'community', 'college', 'actor', 'films', 'solid', 'two', 'star', 'c-horror', 'flick', 'however', 'higher', 'quality', 'most', 'class', 'positive', 'note', 'creature/albinos', 'makeup', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'male', 'lead', 'role', 'complete', 'utter', 'jerk', 'perfection', 'will', 'spend', 'movie', 'wishing', 'someone', 'would', 'just', 'punch', 'face', 'repeatedly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'here', 'fate', 'movie', 'was', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'moment', 'One', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'male', 'co-star', 'who', 'Indian', 'descent', 'Normally', 'not', 'something', 'impact', 'film', 'negative', 'way', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'are', 'good', 'example', 'However', 'guy', 'accent', 'so', 'bad', 'will', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'Apu', 'Simpsons', 'five', 'minutes', 'accent', 'almost', 'identical', 'character', 'major', 'distraction', 'thus', 'impeding', 'overall', 'flow', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'one', 'could', 'definitely', 'do', 'worse', 'enjoy', 'c-horror', 'quote', 'found', 'site', 'sums', 'one', 'up', 'best', 'prime', 'example', 'good', 'concept', 'combining', 'mid-range', 'acting', 'talents', 'fair', 'film', 'work', 'make', 'horrible', 'movie']",N/A

The plot was the usual, group of young adults (meddling kids), a local legend and curiosity.  I really liked this movie.  After seeing so much crap this was a nice change.  The budget is not huge but it is not hand-held camera quality, I hate that crap.  The action was there, the plot was common but good and the acting wasn't too bad for mostly unknowns.  The movie did a good job creating that eerie feeling.  I thought it had some spook to it and it kept my attention.  I'd say for the right price give it a try and I think you'll enjoy it.",3,3+ stars for this surprisingly good movie.,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,636,"['went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'bored', 'death', 'honestly', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'much', 'plot', 'was', 'usual', 'group', 'young', 'adults', 'meddling', 'kids', 'local', 'legend', 'curiosity', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'seeing', 'so', 'much', 'crap', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'budget', 'not', 'huge', 'not', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'quality', 'hate', 'crap', 'action', 'was', 'there', 'plot', 'was', 'common', 'good', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'thought', 'had', 'spook', 'kept', 'attention', ""'d"", 'say', 'right', 'price', 'give', 'try', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",N/A
