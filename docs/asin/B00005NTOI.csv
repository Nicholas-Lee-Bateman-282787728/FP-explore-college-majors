Not as thorough, long or epic as ken Burns' Baseball from 1994, L&T; of H.G. is a wonderful vision of a player who's legacy is fast fading from the era still associated with DiMaggio, Gehrig and Ruth. His ascension to baseball immortality is partly due to his being the first great Jewish ball player. Besides Sandy Koufax, Greenberg can easily be considered the greatest Jewish player ever. He was the winner of two MVP's and two Championships with the Tigers in 1935 and 1945. Greenberg lead the Tigers to their first series appearance in 25 years in 1934, which they lost to St. Louis. He also lead them to a series in 1940, losing to Cincinnati. He served in WWII for three years and returned in 1945 to hit a home run in his first game, and lead the Tigers to a World Series victory. As it goes, his Tigers beat the Cubs in both of his Worls Series victories.According to the doc, Greenberg was one of the first ballplayers to enlist and consequently return from the war.What works about the film is the relaxed nature of Greenberg, seen in archived interviews (he died in 1986 at 75) and the interviews with fellow players and people who grew up idolizing him. Greenberg seems to have taken his success in amazing stride, assuming a responsibility he may or may not have wanted for Jewish Americans. No doubt his success as a player, like Jackie Robinson, who came into the league during Greenberg's last year, provided cushion for the horrors both experienced from fans and fellow players alike.Edited with these interviews is excellent footage of games and newsreels, which together illuminate the times and by extension Greenberg's impact.The film concludes with information on Greenberg's post career, including an ownership and management interest in the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. His time with the Indians saw the largest accumulation of black players yet in MLB history, a championship (their last as of June 2008) in 1948 and a pennant in 1954.This will play terrifically in a school for kids from elementary through high school, as part of history, sports and cultural studies.Highly recommended.",5,"Greenberg, #5, 1st baseman, Detroit Tigers",1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,2206,"['Life', 'Times', 'Hank', 'Greenberg', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'baseball', 'documentary', 'ever', 'Not', 'thorough', 'long', 'epic', 'ken', 'Burns', 'Baseball', '1994', 'L', 'T', 'H.G', 'wonderful', 'vision', 'player', 'who', 'legacy', 'fast', 'fading', 'era', 'still', 'associated', 'DiMaggio', 'Gehrig', 'Ruth', 'ascension', 'baseball', 'immortality', 'partly', 'due', 'being', 'first', 'great', 'Jewish', 'ball', 'player', 'Sandy', 'Koufax', 'Greenberg', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'greatest', 'Jewish', 'player', 'ever', 'was', 'winner', 'two', 'MVP', 'two', 'Championships', 'Tigers', '1935', '1945', 'Greenberg', 'lead', 'Tigers', 'first', 'series', 'appearance', '25', 'years', '1934', 'lost', 'St.', 'Louis', 'also', 'lead', 'series', '1940', 'losing', 'Cincinnati', 'served', 'WWII', 'three', 'years', 'returned', '1945', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'first', 'game', 'lead', 'Tigers', 'World', 'Series', 'victory', 'Tigers', 'beat', 'Cubs', 'Worls', 'Series', 'victories.According', 'doc', 'Greenberg', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'ballplayers', 'enlist', 'consequently', 'return', 'film', 'relaxed', 'nature', 'Greenberg', 'seen', 'archived', 'interviews', 'died', '1986', '75', 'interviews', 'fellow', 'players', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'idolizing', 'Greenberg', 'have', 'taken', 'success', 'amazing', 'stride', 'assuming', 'responsibility', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'wanted', 'Jewish', 'Americans', 'doubt', 'success', 'player', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'who', 'came', 'league', 'Greenberg', 'last', 'year', 'provided', 'cushion', 'horrors', 'experienced', 'fans', 'fellow', 'players', 'alike.Edited', 'interviews', 'excellent', 'footage', 'games', 'newsreels', 'together', 'illuminate', 'times', 'extension', 'Greenberg', 'impact.The', 'film', 'information', 'Greenberg', 'post', 'career', 'including', 'ownership', 'management', 'interest', 'Cleveland', 'Indians', 'Chicago', 'White', 'Sox', 'time', 'Indians', 'saw', 'largest', 'accumulation', 'black', 'players', 'yet', 'MLB', 'history', 'championship', 'last', 'June', '2008', '1948', 'pennant', '1954.This', 'will', 'play', 'terrifically', 'school', 'kids', 'elementary', 'high', 'school', 'part', 'history', 'sports', 'cultural', 'studies.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

A lot of the material here deals with how big an idol Hank was to all the Jews in Amercia back then. I found that interesting, but I watched it simply because I love baseball, especially the ""old days"" and am thrilled to see footage of any Major League baseball games and stars from the first half of the 20th century. If there is a human-interest behind the diamond heroics, all the better!Greenberg was a likable guy and I enjoyed seeing him talk here and there from an interview he did in the early '80s, talking about his career. He isn't a braggart, but he's not that modest, either. He knew he was very good.He didn't make excuses either when he didn't accomplish he wanted, like hitting 60 homers one season. Sadly, some of the commentators on this DVD like attorney Alan Dershowitz are not so unbiased.I enjoyed not only seeing Greenberg smash the ball but witnessing some of his famous and not-so-famous teammates in footage, too, and also interviewed in their older age - guys like Charlie Gehringer, a great second baseman on Hank's winning teams in Detroit.I especially liked what Greenberg said near the end of this long documentary, something I wish more athletes of today would say (and believe): ""I""ve tried to pattern my life on the fact that I'm out there in the limelight, so to speak, and that there are a lot of kids out there.

I of course had heard his name mentioned as 'one of the greats' and I had heard that he was one of the first openly Jewish ballplayers to play baseball, but I really knew very little about his life story. As with many great documentaries, after watching Life and Times of Hank Greenberg I now feel like I really know the whole Hank Greenberg story, and it is a pretty amazing story.Greenberg played at a time where there simply weren't openly Jewish ballplayers. And while Hank wasn't a deeply religious person, he didn't (like some) conceal the fact he was Jewish. Hank Greenberg is known both for standing up in the face of bigotry as well as being an amazing ballplayer. Playing for the Detroit Tigers for the majority of his career, Hank Greenberg was the first player in the American League to receive the MVP award twice. In 1938 he came amazingly close to breaking Babe Ruth's single season home run record 23 years before it was broken by Roger Marris.Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a loving tribute to a man who didn't let bigotry get in the way of his love for baseball and never stopped giving it his all. The documentary was produced over the course of 12 years and features interviews with Hank (who is no longer living), as well as many of the ball players and children of the people he played with. Watching a movie like Life and Times of Hank Greenberg really gives you a glimpse into what makes baseball America's pasttime and something that has the ability to create legends.

He was an icon -- the pride and joy of the Jewish Americans in the 1930s and 40s amidst rampant anti-Semitism. As the first prominent Jewish player in the Major League Baseball, Greenberg not only established himself as one of the best sluggers in baseball history, but he also gave the Jewish Americans something to cheer about. He also paved a path for other baseball pioneers like Jackie Robinson as he quietly fought discrimination by letting his stats speak for themselves.This movie isn't your typical boring documentary either. It shows a nice balance of Greenberg's baseball achievements and personal life (though I wish they focused a bit more on the baseball part) with a good mixture of old baseball footage, interviews with fans, family, friends and Greenberg himself, as well as clips from classic baseball movies such as The Pride of the Yankees.

Like many, he lost his prime years fighting those jerks in the Pacific.  No telling how good his career number would have been if he could have been back in the states poking at the pill.  Even with that handicap he still played in three World Series and won 2 MVP awards.  This move does a pretty good job of documenting his life, but it seems to define him too much by his religion.  Greenberg wasn't even a religious person, but the film continues to go back to the subject.  I'm sure that he found discrimination along the way, but when you see the actual footage of him interviewed in 1983, you get the impression that he would be very uncomfortable with his life being told through that lens.  He seems too no nonsense for that.  It's interesting when he collides with rookie Jackie Robinson in 1947, and offers him encouragement.  It's really a poetic moment in baseball history.The movie is good enough that it seems too short.

670540,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005NTOI,Robert Moore,"[4, 4]","This film doesn't back even a quarter inch from being a documentary of a great Jewish ballplayer.  The opening theme song is ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" in Yiddish.  It sets the tone for the whole film in perfect fashion.One of my professors in grad school explained to me how he changed his name as a grad student in the 1930s in order to ""pass"" as what we would now call WASP in order to escape the ""Jew quotas"" placed against the hiring of too many Jewish professors.  Today we forget just how anti-Semitic much of the United States was before World War II and beyond.  As this documentary points out, this was especially true in Detroit, where America's premiere industrial anti-Semite, Henry Ford, held sway.  The film mentions but does not expand upon Ford's anti-Semitic activity, which included paying for the printing and distribution of the wretched forgery ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" one of the most racist rags ever penned.  This provides the social and historical background for this marvelous documentary history of the great Hank Greenberg, the first professional baseball star to openly embrace his ethnic background.  He thus served as the Jackie Robinson of the Jews in the thirties.  But there was a slight difference.  Though African-Americans were discriminated against and subjugated to terrible racial injustice, there was a sense in which they were undeniably American.  Jews, however, at the time enjoyed an almost outsider status, not really Americans, more in the nature of displaced Europeans.  Greenberg, however, was not just a Jewish sports star, but a star in the great American game of baseball.  His Jewish identity is central to the film, from the recounting of his earlier years to the shocking film footage of Nazi rallies in New York in the late 1930s to Greenberg's being drafted (and reenlisted) for military service in World War II.  And as commentator Alan Dershowitz points out, he was the anti-thesis of what Hitler said it was possible for a Jew to be.  He was the living proof of the lies of Hitler.One of the many jokes in AIRPLANE! is when someone asks for some light reading, and is given a slender pamphlet entitled GREAT JEWISH SPORTS STARS.  Greenberg is one of the great athletes to give the lie to such a conception.  He would reign as the great Jewish baseball player until the emergence of Sandy Koufax twenty years later.  What is striking about both players is that they were both handsome, eloquent, and great gentlemen.  Both men were great heroes to Jews across America, but interestingly neither was especially religious.As a baseball fan, I really enjoyed a lot of the baseball lore that comes through in the film.  For instance, I knew that Greenberg and Gehringer were a great twosome in the infield, but I was unaware that one season the infield knocked in more runs than any infield in baseball history.  Or that a new and controversial glove that the poor fielding Greenberg debuted one season would be finally approved by the league and eventually lead to the modern first baseman's glove.  Or that Greenberg was the first $100,000 player.  Most of all, perhaps, is all the great game footage.  Most baseball fans know Greenberg by sight in a photo, but few of us would recognize him from the way he swings his bat.  But now perhaps I would.  There is also the fantastic segment in which Greenberg in film from the 1980s explains how the Tigers were able in late 1940 to steal the signs of the other team by placing a minor league coach in the stands with binoculars, and signaling by which hand he held them what pitch was coming.Although in many ways Greenberg enjoyed a relatively short career, shortened by injuries and by military service in what would be the peak years for most power hitters (the peak for most home run hitters comes between the ages of 30 and 35, the very years Greenberg was in the military), he enjoyed by any standard a remarkable career.  Because of the war years he lost any chance at 500 career homers, but he led the Tigers to several remarkable seasons, with four pennant winners and two world championships, all to go with his two MVP awards.A bit of trivia partially revealed in the film.  In the 1935 World Series umpire George Moriarty stopped the game to order the Cubs to stop making anti-Semitic remarks directed at Greenberg.  The film then briefly interviews actor Michael Moriarty, the umpire's grandson, who himself starred in one of the great baseball films ever made, BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY, starring Moriarty and a very, very young Robert DeNiro.",5,A solid homage to a trailblazing ballplayer,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,4574,"['film', ""n't"", 'back', 'even', 'quarter', 'inch', 'being', 'documentary', 'great', 'Jewish', 'ballplayer', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ballgame', 'Yiddish', 'tone', 'whole', 'film', 'perfect', 'fashion.One', 'professors', 'grad', 'school', 'explained', 'how', 'changed', 'name', 'grad', 'student', '1930s', 'order', 'pass', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'WASP', 'order', 'escape', 'Jew', 'quotas', 'placed', 'hiring', 'too', 'many', 'Jewish', 'professors', 'Today', 'forget', 'just', 'how', 'anti-Semitic', 'much', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'documentary', 'out', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'Detroit', 'where', 'America', 'premiere', 'industrial', 'anti-Semite', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'held', 'sway', 'film', 'mentions', 'not', 'expand', 'Ford', 'anti-Semitic', 'activity', 'included', 'paying', 'printing', 'distribution', 'wretched', 'forgery', 'Protocols', 'Elders', 'Zion', 'one', 'most', 'racist', 'rags', 'ever', 'penned', 'social', 'historical', 'background', 'marvelous', 'documentary', 'history', 'great', 'Hank', 'Greenberg', 'first', 'professional', 'baseball', 'star', 'openly', 'embrace', 'ethnic', 'background', 'thus', 'served', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Jews', 'thirties', 'was', 'slight', 'difference', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'discriminated', 'subjugated', 'terrible', 'racial', 'injustice', 'was', 'sense', 'were', 'undeniably', 'American', 'Jews', 'however', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'almost', 'outsider', 'status', 'not', 'really', 'Americans', 'more', 'nature', 'displaced', 'Europeans', 'Greenberg', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'Jewish', 'sports', 'star', 'star', 'great', 'American', 'game', 'baseball', 'Jewish', 'identity', 'central', 'film', 'recounting', 'earlier', 'years', 'shocking', 'film', 'footage', 'Nazi', 'rallies', 'New', 'York', 'late', '1930s', 'Greenberg', 'being', 'drafted', 'reenlisted', 'military', 'service', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'commentator', 'Alan', 'Dershowitz', 'out', 'was', 'anti-thesis', 'what', 'Hitler', 'said', 'was', 'possible', 'Jew', 'be', 'was', 'living', 'proof', 'lies', 'Hitler.One', 'many', 'jokes', 'AIRPLANE', 'when', 'someone', 'light', 'reading', 'given', 'slender', 'pamphlet', 'entitled', 'GREAT', 'JEWISH', 'SPORTS', 'STARS', 'Greenberg', 'one', 'great', 'athletes', 'give', 'lie', 'conception', 'would', 'reign', 'great', 'Jewish', 'baseball', 'player', 'emergence', 'Sandy', 'Koufax', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'What', 'striking', 'players', 'were', 'handsome', 'eloquent', 'great', 'gentlemen', 'men', 'were', 'great', 'heroes', 'Jews', 'America', 'interestingly', 'was', 'especially', 'baseball', 'fan', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'baseball', 'lore', 'film', 'instance', 'knew', 'Greenberg', 'Gehringer', 'were', 'great', 'twosome', 'infield', 'was', 'unaware', 'one', 'season', 'infield', 'knocked', 'more', 'runs', 'infield', 'baseball', 'history', 'new', 'controversial', 'glove', 'poor', 'fielding', 'Greenberg', 'debuted', 'one', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'finally', 'approved', 'league', 'eventually', 'lead', 'modern', 'first', 'baseman', 'glove', 'Greenberg', 'was', 'first', '100,000', 'player', 'Most', 'perhaps', 'great', 'game', 'footage', 'Most', 'baseball', 'fans', 'know', 'Greenberg', 'sight', 'photo', 'few', 'would', 'recognize', 'way', 'swings', 'bat', 'now', 'perhaps', 'would', 'also', 'fantastic', 'segment', 'Greenberg', 'film', '1980s', 'how', 'Tigers', 'were', 'able', 'late', '1940', 'steal', 'signs', 'other', 'team', 'placing', 'minor', 'league', 'coach', 'stands', 'binoculars', 'signaling', 'hand', 'held', 'what', 'pitch', 'was', 'coming.Although', 'many', 'ways', 'Greenberg', 'enjoyed', 'relatively', 'short', 'career', 'shortened', 'injuries', 'military', 'service', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'peak', 'years', 'most', 'power', 'hitters', 'peak', 'most', 'home', 'run', 'hitters', 'ages', '30', '35', 'very', 'years', 'Greenberg', 'was', 'military', 'enjoyed', 'standard', 'remarkable', 'career', 'war', 'years', 'lost', 'chance', '500', 'career', 'homers', 'led', 'Tigers', 'several', 'remarkable', 'seasons', 'four', 'pennant', 'winners', 'two', 'world', 'championships', 'go', 'two', 'MVP', 'awards.A', 'bit', 'trivia', 'partially', 'revealed', 'film', '1935', 'World', 'Series', 'umpire', 'George', 'Moriarty', 'stopped', 'game', 'order', 'Cubs', 'stop', 'making', 'anti-Semitic', 'remarks', 'directed', 'Greenberg', 'film', 'then', 'briefly', 'interviews', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'umpire', 'grandson', 'who', 'starred', 'one', 'great', 'baseball', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'BANG', 'THE', 'DRUM', 'SLOWLY', 'starring', 'Moriarty', 'very', 'very', 'young', 'Robert', 'DeNiro']",N/A
