566005,A2GAUG7MPGJQ1B,B000053VBW,"Jeffrey R. Young ""Jeff""","[2, 2]","The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie.  If you were expecting serious crime drama then you're looking in the wrong place.  This is definitely not Black Knight Rises, but if your willing to sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero, a great looking techno-whiz of a car and some fast-paced action you ARE in the right place.One quick warning for parents out there, this movie is rated ""R"" for good reason.  Since some of the action is from the mind of Roger Corman it can get a little gruesome and sexy at points in this movie so don't let the comic book roots fool you, this is not for the kiddies.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that this 15 year old flic stood up as well as it did.  Not great, not awful, just okay.",3,Better Than Expected - Fun Action,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,827,"['character', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'born', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'certainly', 'movie', 'were', 'expecting', 'serious', 'crime', 'drama', 'then', ""'re"", 'looking', 'wrong', 'place', 'definitely', 'not', 'Black', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'willing', 'sit', 'back', 'grab', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'action', 'including', 'great', 'looking', 'super', 'hero', 'great', 'looking', 'techno-whiz', 'car', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'ARE', 'right', 'place.One', 'quick', 'warning', 'parents', 'there', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'good', 'reason', 'action', 'mind', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'gruesome', 'sexy', 'points', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'fool', 'not', 'kiddies.Overall', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', '15', 'year', 'old', 'flic', 'stood', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Not', 'great', 'not', 'awful', 'just', 'okay']",N/A

Although her partner has been recast, almost all of the faces from the first movie have returned, including Garret Morris as Argyle.The film opens with Darcy tracking down the Gangster Prankster (sort of a cross between the Joker and Two-Face) and then busting him as Black Scorpion.  Meanwhile a woman scientist has come up with a way to neutralize earthquakes and aftershocks.  Unfortunately the Mayor enjoys the federal relief funds that quakes bring in so he sabotages her machine.  The result is that it amplifies the quake and the scientist takes on the identity of Aftershock.  It is up to Black Scorpion to make the streets safe again.While not quite up to the level of the first film (the fight scenes are almost comical) it was still a fun film and I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the first Black Scorpion film.  I definitely recommend these films to those who like the comic book film genre, although this is not intended for kids (ther is nudity and violence).",4,Return of Black Scorpion,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1226,"['When', 'saw', 'was', 'movie', 'called', 'Black', 'Scorpion', '2', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'watch', 'right', 'away', 'wife', 'had', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie.Joan', 'Severance', 'Darcy', 'Walker', 'policewoman', 'day', 'crime', 'fighter', 'night', 'partner', 'been', 'recast', 'almost', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'returned', 'including', 'Garret', 'Morris', 'Argyle.The', 'film', 'Darcy', 'tracking', 'down', 'Gangster', 'Prankster', 'sort', 'cross', 'Joker', 'Two-Face', 'then', 'busting', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'Meanwhile', 'woman', 'scientist', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'neutralize', 'earthquakes', 'aftershocks', 'Unfortunately', 'Mayor', 'federal', 'relief', 'funds', 'quakes', 'bring', 'so', 'machine', 'result', 'quake', 'scientist', 'identity', 'Aftershock', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'make', 'streets', 'safe', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'first', 'film', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'comical', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'first', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'film', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'films', 'who', 'like', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'genre', 'not', 'intended', 'kids', 'ther', 'nudity', 'violence']",N/A
