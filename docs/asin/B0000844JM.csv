If you have small kids who aren't yet spoiled by Computer Generated Overkill, I think they'll be entranced. And any grownups who still have a bit of innocence left I think will be, too.The dancers from the Royal Ballet are all costumed as the characters. The female creatures all are plump and wear pastel gowns with the waist around the bust and white dust bonnets on their heads. The male creatures all are chubby and wear frock coats, knickers and knee socks. The dancers also wear full head masks to look like the squirrels and pigs and mice and ducks. I couldn't spot an eye port anywhere. The characters are all there (and spare me the sophisticated smirks): Mrs. Tigglewinkle, Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, Jemima Puddleduck, Pigling Bland, The Cunning Fox, Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the others.The music is first-rate, with plenty of waltzes and melody. The choreography is oustanding, funny and true to the characters. And the production values are excellent. This is an example of what professionals can accomplish when they're at the top of their game.The DVD transfer is very good. And for once I wish there were extras. It would have been fascinating to learn about the development of the look of the piece and the costumes and head masks. It also would have been good to hear from some of the dancers of what it took to dance their roles in those costumes.",5,A Ballet for Kids...and for Discerning Adults,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,1477,"['Two', 'words', 'filming', 'ballet', 'Frederick', 'Ashton', 'stories', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Clever', 'charming', 'have', 'small', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'yet', 'spoiled', 'Computer', 'Generated', 'Overkill', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entranced', 'grownups', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'bit', 'innocence', 'left', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'too.The', 'dancers', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'are', 'costumed', 'characters', 'female', 'creatures', 'are', 'plump', 'wear', 'pastel', 'gowns', 'waist', 'bust', 'white', 'dust', 'bonnets', 'heads', 'male', 'are', 'chubby', 'wear', 'frock', 'coats', 'knickers', 'knee', 'socks', 'dancers', 'also', 'wear', 'full', 'head', 'masks', 'look', 'squirrels', 'pigs', 'mice', 'ducks', 'could', ""n't"", 'spot', 'eye', 'port', 'anywhere', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'spare', 'sophisticated', 'smirks', 'Mrs.', 'Tigglewinkle', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Squirrel', 'Nutkin', 'Jemima', 'Puddleduck', 'Pigling', 'Bland', 'Cunning', 'Fox', 'Mrs.', 'Tittlemouse', 'others.The', 'music', 'first-rate', 'plenty', 'waltzes', 'melody', 'choreography', 'oustanding', 'funny', 'true', 'characters', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'example', 'what', 'professionals', 'can', 'accomplish', 'when', ""'re"", 'top', 'game.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'once', 'wish', 'were', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'learn', 'development', 'look', 'piece', 'costumes', 'head', 'masks', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'hear', 'dancers', 'what', 'took', 'dance', 'roles', 'costumes']",N/A

Levin,"[15, 15]","Why this particular motion picture?* If you would like your young children to become acquainted with a cultural event, that was designed for young children and adults of all ages.* If you enjoyed the popular ballet "" The Nutcracker"", usually performed during Christmas holidays, then you would also be entranced with this ballet, ""The Tales of Beatrix Potter.""************************************Beatrix Potter: Was probably, the most popular writer and illustrator of children's books. Peter Rabbit, was a main character in a series of her children's books. Her Tales of Peter Rabbit, was first introduced in 1902.  Peter and all the other animal characters in her stories, are depicted in human clothes. The Tales of Peter Rabbit books, have sold more than 150 million+ copies in 35 languages and still continues to do so.Ballet: (A theatrical representation of a story performed to music and by dance.)In 1970,the most prestigious ballet company in Great Britain, The Royal Ballet, under the direction of Sir Frederick Ashton, who was probably the greatest British choreographer of the 20th century. Sir Frederick Ashton, choreographed and created with his selected ballet dancers, a motion picture, depicting some of the marvelous characters of the ""Tales of Peter Rabbit."" His prestigious ballet dancers were dressed and made up to look just like the actual animal characters that were depicted in Beatrix Potter's ""Tales Of Peter Rabbit"". The great Sir Frederick Ashton, then age 67, also appeared in the motion picture, as one of the ""Peter Rabbit"" story characters. His performance evidently signifies his endorsement of this motion picture. The film was nominated for two British Academy Film Awards.This 1970 outstanding motion picture is called, ""The Tales of Beatrix Potter,"" with a magnificent original musical score, specially composed for this momentous motion picture. The distinguishing original music score presented no hesitation in acquiring the prestigious Royal Opera House Orchestra, to provide the musical accompaniment to this motion picture.There were two factors that at first limited the attendance to this masterpiece motion picture.First, it was considered a children's movie, secondly, it's was a ballet.This is a VERY special movie, that very young people will be fascinated with, especially the costumed characters. If you desired your youngster to discover and become knowledgeable of theatrical performances of excellence, then this unique motion picture, will give any intelligent and impressionable child, the desire to appreciate future such performances of excellence.Not surprisingly, many adults, who have seen this unique motion picture, are equally fascinated with the outstanding original musical score as well as the incredible marvelous transformation of the dancers in the most realistic animal likeness in their make-up.Those that do have an interest in ballet, will be amazed of the almost impossible ballet techniques that were accomplished while in those most realistic and cumbersome of customs and makeup(masks).There are no hidden messages in this motion picture, in fact, there is not a single word spoken in this motion picture. It is just a delightful visual experience to see and hear. Most, that have seen this visual and musical experience, are left with the most pleasurable of memories. It is only 90 minutes long.Many who have seen this masterpiece, will keep this DVD forever, so that you can have it available for future generations of your family, it is timeless.One very unusual comment, regarding a member of their family, who was affected with Alzheimer, found that their afflicted loved one, truly enjoyed viewing this motion picture.

For those toddlers and young children who know the stories by Beatrix Potter, the ballet offers a full-body experience of the geography of the fiction.

The entire film itself seems to have been made yesterday--not almost 40 years ago!  The sets are fantastic--especially the lilly pads of Jeremy Fisher.What I like is that the penchant Potter had for creating the fear of being eaten (it is in almost all of her stories) is muted a great deal in these dances.  What comes across most clearly to the child is the dance itself, and that is, I would say, as it should be.I am myself more interested in watching ballet after watching this.

However, they are on other releases of the same ballet.....The Tales of Beatrix Potter (with Dancers of The Royal Ballet).....for instance, has many reviews.Reviewer Rubel is correct when he says the ballet is lovely and beautiful, and there are many other superlatives which could be used to describe it. It is wonderful for both children and adults, but one learns by reading other reviews, that young children may be a bit frightened by some of the characters, unless they are supervised by a caring adult. Also, children who do not know the animal characters, will probably not enjoy, or even sit through the entire ballet. They need to know the characters, and they need to know what a ballet is. It's a BALLET and NOT a cartoon, to begin with, accompanied by some very good music arranged and conducted by John Lanchbery. I thought I heard some themes of Adolphe Adams from ""Giselle"", and perhaps a theme of Massenet heard in the ballet ""Manon"". Yes, good music, and also beautiful photography of English countryside. By the way, my version is in the l6:9 widescreen format. The sound is monaural, however, it is good quality Dolby Digital.I'm not very familiar with the names of many of Royal Ballet's dancers, but Fredrick Ashton is the Choreographer, and dances the part of the hedgehog Mrs. Tiggywinkle. Lesley Collier, and Michael Coleman, the stars of ""La Fille Mal Gardee"" (fabulous).....Herold - La Fille Mal Gardee / Collier, Coleman, Shaw, Grant, Ashton, Royal Ballet.....have roles in this ballet. Lesley Collier plays the part of Hunca Munca, but I don't know which character that is. Michael Coleman is especially good as the leapfrog Jeremy Fisher, but all of the dancing by members of the Royal Ballet is superb. The beauty of the ballerina's feet is especially brought out in this ballet, because in their costumes, the feet are all that show.P.S. I went back and read the names of dancers in La Fille Mal Gardee, and found several names also featured in this ballet. Also, Hunca Munca seems to be the sweetheart of the little mouse Tom Thumb. Very adorable pair.Even though you may not have children at home, this is a great ballet for adults to own.",5,A common man's point of view.,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,2253,"['Actually', 'not', 'just', 'second', 'review', 'ballet', 'are', 'several', 'However', 'are', 'other', 'releases', 'same', 'ballet', '..The', 'Tales', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Dancers', 'Royal', 'Ballet', '..for', 'instance', 'many', 'reviews.Reviewer', 'Rubel', 'correct', 'when', 'ballet', 'lovely', 'beautiful', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'superlatives', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'wonderful', 'children', 'adults', 'one', 'learns', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'frightened', 'characters', 'are', 'supervised', 'caring', 'adult', 'Also', 'children', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'animal', 'characters', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'even', 'sit', 'entire', 'ballet', 'need', 'know', 'characters', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'ballet', 'BALLET', 'NOT', 'cartoon', 'begin', 'accompanied', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'arranged', 'conducted', 'John', 'Lanchbery', 'thought', 'heard', 'themes', 'Adolphe', 'Adams', 'Giselle', 'perhaps', 'theme', 'Massenet', 'heard', 'ballet', 'Manon', 'Yes', 'good', 'music', 'also', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'English', 'countryside', 'way', 'version', 'l6:9', 'widescreen', 'format', 'sound', 'monaural', 'however', 'good', 'quality', 'Dolby', 'Digital.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'names', 'many', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'dancers', 'Fredrick', 'Ashton', 'Choreographer', 'part', 'hedgehog', 'Mrs.', 'Tiggywinkle', 'Lesley', 'Collier', 'Michael', 'Coleman', 'stars', 'La', 'Fille', 'Mal', 'Gardee', 'fabulous', '..Herold', 'La', 'Fille', 'Mal', 'Gardee', '/', 'Collier', 'Coleman', 'Shaw', 'Grant', 'Ashton', 'Royal', 'Ballet', '..have', 'roles', 'ballet', 'Lesley', 'Collier', 'part', 'Hunca', 'Munca', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'character', 'Michael', 'Coleman', 'especially', 'good', 'leapfrog', 'Jeremy', 'Fisher', 'dancing', 'members', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'superb', 'beauty', 'ballerina', 'feet', 'especially', 'brought', 'out', 'ballet', 'costumes', 'feet', 'are', 'show.P.S', 'went', 'back', 'read', 'names', 'dancers', 'La', 'Fille', 'Mal', 'Gardee', 'found', 'several', 'names', 'also', 'featured', 'ballet', 'Also', 'Hunca', 'Munca', 'be', 'sweetheart', 'little', 'mouse', 'Tom', 'Thumb', 'Very', 'adorable', 'pair.Even', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'children', 'home', 'great', 'ballet', 'adults', 'own']",N/A

The dancing is a miracle since the characters caper in costumes that fully realize the animals of Beatrix Potter.  To see the cat dance with a tail and full skirt is amazing since her vision is obscured by the big cat mask.  An excellent film for young kids who will be enchanted by these animal personalities. Each dance is like a little book so you can start and stop the film if you have a short attention span kid.I was disappointed in the quality of the video.  The color in the theater was outstanding.  In this video version there are scenes so dark that you cannot see the dancing.  Some of the country side is murky also.  I am watching on a computer so that may be my problem.  If you are in the same techno boat rent the film anyway.  There are enough great dance sequences that are visible to make watching this worthwhile.",4,Great Nutcracker alternative,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,958,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'back', 'day', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'music', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'dancing', 'miracle', 'characters', 'caper', 'costumes', 'fully', 'realize', 'animals', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'see', 'cat', 'dance', 'tail', 'full', 'skirt', 'amazing', 'vision', 'obscured', 'big', 'cat', 'mask', 'excellent', 'film', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'enchanted', 'animal', 'personalities', 'dance', 'little', 'book', 'can', 'start', 'stop', 'film', 'have', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'kid.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'video', 'color', 'theater', 'was', 'outstanding', 'video', 'version', 'are', 'scenes', 'so', 'dark', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'dancing', 'country', 'side', 'murky', 'also', 'am', 'watching', 'computer', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'are', 'same', 'techno', 'boat', 'rent', 'film', 'anyway', 'are', 'enough', 'great', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', 'visible', 'make', 'watching', 'worthwhile']",N/A
