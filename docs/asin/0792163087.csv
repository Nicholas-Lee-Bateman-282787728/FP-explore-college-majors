130785,A38F6UBQJI9QG1,0792163087,,"[7, 8]","Genre: Foreign (English language) DramaGenre Grade: A+Final Grade: A-This film is about an extremely poor Irish family, namely the oldest son of the family and his childhood story and dreams of traveling to America. His father can't get a job and when he does he ""drinks his pay"" and comes home in a drunken stupor. Their mother (played honorably by Emily Watson) has to deal with losing three children. The movie is powerful and has much to say about poverty as well as offering some good lessons in pride. I am surprised this film was not nominated for Oscars (except for it's great music by John Williams), but it was up against incredible competition so it got pushed aside. This movie has some really funny moments that reminded me of Life is Beautiful and also some very heartbreaking moments that reminded me of Schindler's List.

130789,AGEIT17HENDIS,0792163087,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","This review has been used to to comment on the book ""Angela's Ashes"". Many of the points made here aplly to the film. Read the book AND watch the movie.Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"" is probably the easiest review that I have had to write since I have been doing such reviews in this space. Why? Frank McCourt's book of childhood memoirs is my story. No, not in the details of his life's story, or mine. But rather in how being Irish, being poor and being uprooted affects your childhood, and later. And those traumas, for good or evil, cross generational lines. McCourt, we are told as his story unfolds, was born in America of immigrants of the Diaspora after Irish independence who, for one reason or another, returned to the old country in defeat in the 1930's. As McCourt notes right at the beginning, that fact in itself provides a rather ironic twist if one is familiar with Irish history (at least until very recently). He is, in any case, thus a child of the Great Depression and World War II, the generation of my parents, as it was refracted through Ireland during that period. I, on the other hand, am a child of the 1960's, the ""Generation of `68"" here in America born of the dreaded Irish Catholic-English Protestant combination- and raised in an Irish Catholic enclave. Nevertheless the pages of this memoir are filled to the brim with the results of the emotional (and sometimes physical scars) of being ""shanty"" Irish in this world that hit home to this reader.That said, we did not share the terrible effect that ""the drink"" had on creating his dysfunctional family with his father's, Malachy McCourt, crazed need for the alcohol cure to drown his sorrows and his bitterness and the fact that his great moment in life was his bit for ""the cause"" (of Irish independence). A familiar story in the Irish community here and in the old country but my father seldom drank, although he too was constantly out of work and shared with Frank's father that same bitterness about his fate.  He was uneducated, lacking in skills and prospects and as a ""hillbilly"" Protestant Southerner from coal country down in Kentucky. Thus, an `outsider' like Frank's father. That is the commonality that caught my eye (and sometimes my throat) as I read of Frank's youthful trials, tribulations and adventures. McCourt's ability to tap into that ""mystical"" something is what makes this a fine read, whether you are Irish or not.Throughout the book McCourt's woe begotten but fatally prideful father is constantly referred to in the Irishtown working class poor ghetto of Limerick (and elsewhere, as well, but the heart of the story is told from there) as having an odd manner. This reflects a certain clannishness among those from the North of Ireland (Dare I say it, then area then known as Ulster) and a sneaking suspicion amount that crowd of some alien (meaning English Protestant) heritage. As the book progresses that odd trait is transferred (by heredity?) to Frank in his various wanderings, enterprise and desires. What joins us together then is that odd manner that gets repeatedly invoked throughout the book. Frank survived to tell the tale. As did I. But in both cases it appears to have been a near thing.There is more that unites us. The shame culture, not an exclusive Irish Catholic property but very strong nevertheless, drilled in by the clannishness, the closeness of neighbors, the Catholic religion and by the bloody outsiders- usually but not always Protestants of some sort (as least for blame purposes- you know, the eight hundred years of British tyranny although very real to be sure).  All driven by not having nearly enough of this world's goods.  Every time I read a passage about the lack of food, the quality of the food, the conditions of the various tenements that the McCourt family lived in, the lack of adequate and clean clothing I cringed at the thoughts from my own childhood. Or the various times when the family was seriously down and out and his mother, the beloved Angela of the title, had to beg charity of one form or another from some institution that existed mainly to berate the poor. I can remember own my mother's plaintive cry when my brothers and I misbehaved that the next step was the county poor farm. Ouch!And how about the false pride and skewed order of priorities? Frank's father was a flat out drunk and was totally irresponsible. From a child's perspective, however, he is still your dad and must be given the respect accordingly, especially against the viciousness of the outside world. But life's disappointments for the father also get reflected in the expectations for the son. The dreams are smaller. Here, the horizons are pretty small when a governmental job with its security just above the ""dole"" is the touchstone of respectability. Sean O'Casey was able to make enduring plays from the slums of Dublin out of this material. And Frank McCourt enduring literature. Thanks, brother.Note: The movie version of ""Angela's Ashes"" pretty fairly reflects the intentions of Frank McCourt in his childhood memoirs and follows the book accordingly, without the usual dramatic embellishments of that medium. The story line is so strong it needs no such ""touch-ups"". Particularly compelling is the very visual sense of utter poverty down at the base of Irish society in Frank McCourt's childhood.",5,"A Bit Of The Odd Manner, On the Screen",1239408000,"04 11,

My favorite film of his remains &quot;Sid and Nancy.&quot;  His film of survival as child Frank McCourt in a bare bones poverty-stricken family in Ireland can be bleak.  McCourt makes it out of Ireland and to America by film's end, a true story, but getting there is a gray, rain-sodden event.  I will single out one actor though who is absolutely superb.  That is Robert Carlyle as Frank's father and his portrayal of his losing battle with alcohol and unemployment despite wanting to be a loving father and family man.  I wanted to hate him for his weaknesses and how they hurt his family but Carlyle actually had me pitying his character too.  The last one sees of him in the movie was a really peak moment that is impossible to forget.  I can see him now walking away from Frank in the rain.  I'd seen Carlyle in movies before but he pulled out all of the stops on this one.  I've been trying to discover the wonderfulness of Emily Watson that all filmmakers tell me is there in her acting ability.  Her appeal continues to elude me, however, despite seeing at least six films with her in the lead. The young actors who play Frank are splendid.

I read the book and I saw the film and the film is actually easier to take in some ways than the book.  Both are pretty grim, there's no getting around that.  Frank McCourt's childhood was a difficult affair.The film and the book  are works of art.  The job of the artist is to shake us up, to make us see  what we did not see before. The Ireland that Frank McCourt experienced was  poor, dirty, downtrodden and very Catholic. Although I am not Irish, I grew  up Catholic, and his depiction of the RC clergy was right-on.  I can  remember at the age of eight having a nun scream so hard she grew red in  the face. I was terrified.Well, read &quot;Irish Immigrants and  Exiles&quot; if you think Mr. McCourt is exaggerating.The film  faithfully follows the book and I thought the film was more  &quot;hopeful&quot; than the book. The child actors who play Frank at three  different ages are wonderful. Mr. Mccourt said that he thought the film was  a wonderful film that exactly captured his family. Guess we have to trust  his judgement.Whether you want to be subjected to this misery is another  matter. The story reminds me of the films Carlo Ponti made about Italy  after the War.

He wanted to succeed in painting a picture so drab and weary that you're likely to leave the theater feeling guilty that you have no holes in your pockets and wonder bread in the cubbard.  He does succeed, he's made a fine picture, but he's made it for himself and not us.  It's about a grown up boy from Limerick coming to terms with the past, it's really him behind the camera releasing the pain as if it were an Exodus from Egypt.  Angela's Ashes is therapy for him.  It's angry, and I think that's fine, because he just about convinces us that he has the right to make this kind of movie even if we don't.  It goes to supersede the kind of realism that the Italians were talking about.  Fellini wrote and directed about childhood poverty, but not this kind of poverty, he wanted us to identify with the universal human spirit whereas McCourt doesn't think we have the right to.  He says that even if you're poor in America you're not this poor, and if you are you can still tell your father you love him without being laughed at.  There are some emotional payoffs in the movie: his aunt's unexpected kindness, his first sexual experience, his luck in finding passage to America.  But the movie isn't about those scenes, the script and direction don't treat them with the same kind of meticulous care.  They dance on the brink of being superfluous, they make the film uneven; those scenes don't belong in the kind of movie he really needed to make.  The contrast isn't strong enough, but it's a good film, and I hope you see it, just like I hope McCourt is able to find some closure.  After all, that's who you're really rooting for, the man who wrote the book, the voice over that assume his identity; You're just not too sure about the characters on the screen.  Receiving a film is a completely subjective.

130818,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0792163087,"""flickjunkie""","[22, 22]","The trouble with making a movie out of a Pulitzer Prize winning book is that no matter how good and true to the book it is, it will usually be a disappointment.  This has a lot to do with the difference between reading a  story and seeing one.  When one reads a book, it is usually done over time,  perhaps a week or two.  The words stir the imagination and the scenes  described become images, usually more illusory than real.  There is plenty  of time for this process to work.  A film, in contrast, is viewed over a  period of about two hours, where the viewer is perceiving rather than  imagining.  The portrayals are well defined and no matter how creative the  director, it is very difficult to create scenes that equal those of readers  who have previously conjured fantastic images in their heads.I believe  this is the reason this film was such a disappointment to so many viewers  who had read the book.  Thankfully, I saw the film first, so I had no  preconceived notions.  With that fresh perspective, I must say that it was  outstanding.It the story is taken from the memoirs of Frank McCourt, who  recounted his childhood in Ireland in the 1930's and 1940's.  It is a  poignant and compelling story of a poor family struggling to survive.  The  images are powerful depictions of the indignity of indigence in a world  where hunger and disease were common and people went almost as frequently  to the cemetery as to the market.Alan Parker brings us a starkly  realistic view of McCourt's Ireland.  He scoured Ireland to find a ghetto  that brought forth the images described in the book, but after an  exhaustive search, he decided to build the lane from scratch using  McCourt's photographs.  Upon visiting the set, McCourt said it was  chillingly accurate and he couldn't believe he wasn't back home.  Parker  desaturated the color to give the film a very stark look, consistent with  the squalor he was trying to portray.  Paradoxically, the loss of color  intensity intensified the power of the images.  Though I'm not a big fan of  this technique (I like rich and vibrant color), in this case it was the  perfect choice.The film suffers a bit from excessive length, undoubtedly  because there was so much to cover.  However, when Parker bombards the  viewer with disturbingly hopeless imagery for well over two hours, it  becomes tedious.  This is another advantage of reading a book.  You can  more easily put it down and come back to it.  Parker sometimes overdoes  certain ideas that he could have condensed.  We could have done without  half a dozen vomiting scenes and all the chamber pot activity.  One or two  such scenes would have gotten the message across.The cast was  consistently excellent.  Parker saw over 15,000 child actors before casting  the three boys who played Frank at various ages.  All three were wonderful,  but my favorite was Michael Legge, the oldest Frank.  He was the most  hopeful person in the film, giving him character and determination, without  losing his idealistic innocence.Emily Watson is a great dramatic actress  and rose to the occasion to endow Angela with superhuman strength, courage  and persistence in the face of crushing hardship and sorrow.  Robert  Carlyle was also terrific as Frank's father.  He made the character a  lovable man with fatal flaws.  Despite his heinously irresponsible behavior  squandering money on drink as his family starved, his charming nature and  effusive affection for the children evoked as much love from us as  disgust.This is a brilliant production.  Though many who read the book  were disappointed, I must point out that Frank McCourt, who wrote the book,  was unabashed in praising it for its realism in capturing his impressions  and feelings of the times.  I rated it a 9/10.  Other than a bit of  overkill, this is superb filmmaking, giving us an affecting look at the  human face of poverty.",5,Affecting look at the human face of poverty,964224000,"07 22, 2000",2000,3899,"['trouble', 'making', 'movie', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'book', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'true', 'book', 'will', 'usually', 'be', 'disappointment', 'lot', 'do', 'difference', 'reading', 'story', 'seeing', 'one', 'When', 'one', 'book', 'usually', 'done', 'time', 'perhaps', 'week', 'two', 'words', 'stir', 'imagination', 'scenes', 'described', 'become', 'images', 'usually', 'more', 'illusory', 'real', 'plenty', 'time', 'process', 'work', 'film', 'contrast', 'viewed', 'period', 'two', 'hours', 'where', 'viewer', 'perceiving', 'rather', 'imagining', 'portrayals', 'are', 'well', 'defined', 'matter', 'how', 'creative', 'director', 'very', 'difficult', 'create', 'scenes', 'equal', 'readers', 'who', 'have', 'previously', 'conjured', 'fantastic', 'images', 'heads.I', 'believe', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'disappointment', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'Thankfully', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'outstanding.It', 'story', 'taken', 'memoirs', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'who', 'recounted', 'childhood', 'Ireland', '1930', '1940', 'poignant', 'compelling', 'story', 'poor', 'family', 'struggling', 'survive', 'images', 'are', 'powerful', 'depictions', 'indignity', 'indigence', 'world', 'where', 'hunger', 'disease', 'were', 'common', 'people', 'went', 'almost', 'frequently', 'cemetery', 'market.Alan', 'Parker', 'starkly', 'realistic', 'view', 'McCourt', 'Ireland', 'scoured', 'Ireland', 'find', 'ghetto', 'brought', 'forth', 'images', 'described', 'book', 'exhaustive', 'search', 'decided', 'build', 'lane', 'scratch', 'using', 'McCourt', 'photographs', 'visiting', 'set', 'McCourt', 'said', 'was', 'chillingly', 'accurate', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', ""n't"", 'back', 'home', 'Parker', 'desaturated', 'color', 'give', 'film', 'very', 'stark', 'look', 'consistent', 'squalor', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'Paradoxically', 'loss', 'color', 'intensity', 'intensified', 'power', 'images', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'technique', 'like', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'color', 'case', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice.The', 'film', 'suffers', 'bit', 'excessive', 'length', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'cover', 'However', 'when', 'Parker', 'viewer', 'disturbingly', 'hopeless', 'imagery', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'tedious', 'advantage', 'reading', 'book', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'put', 'down', 'come', 'back', 'Parker', 'sometimes', 'certain', 'ideas', 'could', 'have', 'condensed', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'dozen', 'vomiting', 'scenes', 'chamber', 'pot', 'activity', 'One', 'two', 'such', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'message', 'across.The', 'cast', 'was', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'Parker', 'saw', '15,000', 'child', 'actors', 'casting', 'three', 'boys', 'who', 'played', 'Frank', 'various', 'ages', 'three', 'were', 'wonderful', 'favorite', 'was', 'Michael', 'Legge', 'oldest', 'Frank', 'was', 'most', 'hopeful', 'person', 'film', 'giving', 'character', 'determination', 'losing', 'idealistic', 'innocence.Emily', 'Watson', 'great', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'rose', 'occasion', 'endow', 'Angela', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'courage', 'persistence', 'face', 'crushing', 'hardship', 'sorrow', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'was', 'also', 'terrific', 'Frank', 'father', 'made', 'character', 'lovable', 'man', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'heinously', 'irresponsible', 'behavior', 'squandering', 'money', 'drink', 'family', 'starved', 'charming', 'nature', 'effusive', 'affection', 'children', 'evoked', 'much', 'love', 'disgust.This', 'brilliant', 'production', 'many', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'were', 'disappointed', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'was', 'unabashed', 'praising', 'realism', 'capturing', 'impressions', 'feelings', 'times', 'rated', '9/10', 'Other', 'bit', 'overkill', 'superb', 'filmmaking', 'giving', 'affecting', 'look', 'human', 'face', 'poverty']",N/A

Michael,"[20, 39]","Frank McCourt announces the hate-filled theme of his malevolent Bildungsroman in his first paragraph: ""Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" I haven't read the book, but this movie is just one shovelful of muck after another thrown upon unrecognizable and unbelievable caricatures of the Catholic Church and the Irish people. Not content with slandering the Faith and the Fatherland, McCourt is a man of such baseness that he even puts his own dead parents at the front of his firing squad of degradation. Even if his father's alcoholism and his mother's prostitution were true, it takes a man of extremely vile character to tell the whole world about it. But that's what Frank McCourt is and that's what the real message of this movie is: utter materialism. Faith, patriotism, morality are things to be scorned, and if you can make a buck by spitting on your own parents, go for it. In that, he is an evangelist of the American Spirit and the New Ireland where shameless mercenaries conduct ""Angela's Ashes"" tours through Limerick, making a living by running down their own city and their own people.Thankfully, at least one man has written a counterpoint (Gerard Hannan's ""Ashes""Ashes (Pennance Trilogy, 1)), detailing a happy childhood in a quite different Limerick than the one McCourt describes. And some quite cursory internet searches will reveal that McCourt's book is a package of stinking lies; lies about the extent of Limerick's misery, lies about actual people- living and dead-, and lies about the extent of the poverty in his own overweight childhood in the elite boy scout troop of the city. When people confront him about this, the self-important McCourt mocks them as ""begrudgers"" and compares himself to James Joyce and John Synge. But what do facts matter when the lies you tell tickle the ears of the secular, leftist elite of media and university? Gerard Hannan could write like Shakespeare, but he would never get a major American book deal or an honorary degree from the University of Limerick.In America, White people used to put on things called ""minstrel shows"", where they would wear black makeup on their faces and mock Black people by  exaggerating their most demeaning stereotypes. Black people were rightfully offended and public sentiment eventually forced an end to the spectacle. With ""Angela's Ashes"", an Irishman wrote a derogatory book about his own people, which was turned into a movie where an English actress and a Scottish actor exaggerate the most demeaning stereotypes about the Irish. And warped Irish and Irish Americans put the book and movie on their shelves as some sort of point of pride.

130830,A9TG2NFA614S9,0792163087,John F. Rooney,"[2, 2]","Frank and Malachy McCourt as children were living in poverty with their parents in New York, such destitution that the family was forced to return to poverty-stricken Ireland in order to survive. They were one of the few Irish families that viewed the Statue of Liberty on their way out of the harbor instead of coming in.Their father was a good man with serious flaws. He was unable to find work, and whenever he got some extra money, he spent it on booze rather than on his family. He was not an abusive drunk, but a pernicious one nevertheless. The mother was strangely passive at times. They lived in gray, dreary Limerick where it seemed always to be raining, and a pool of water sat in the downstairs of their house. The two brothers somehow thrived despite the gloomy life. Seeing them running through puddles, splashing each other, remaining somehow buoyant, helps to save the movie. Frank's confessions to various priests are priceless humor.In many ways this is a grim, sad story, but bursts of humor, great acting, and occasional evidences of humanity and generosity save it from descending into a completely depressing movie. Frank's days at school with the Catholic brothers are fascinating. The teachers rail against the British who dominated Ireland for so long.It is a story of transcendence over poverty.

Sometimes they work quite well; indeed, there are great film translations of Michael Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient&quot; and Milan Kundera's &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;. But alas, they usually don't. When I heard that a film adaptation of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was being made, I feared that it would fail to convey the emotional power and Joycean prose of Frank McCourt's words. Alas, my worst fears were realized.Trying to remain faithful to the book, the film becomes a disjointed set of episodes linked by an unseen narrator who speaks of them in the past. This is a major error by Alan Parker and his co-writer. They should have set the narration in present tense, using Frank to quote directly from his book. The fine cinematography is muted in the pale blue light that hovers over virtually every scene of what is meant to be Limerick outdoors.Although Emily Watson does a good job portraying Angela McCourt, this film's best feature is its music; another excellent score composed by John Williams.Those who wish to remember the magical lyricism of Frank's prose should read &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; again.

Bernabo,"[1, 3]","It took a while for me to get interested in ""Angela's Ashes,"" and I was surprised to realize that the problem with the early part of Alan Parker's film was that the music was laying it on too thick. This is a surprise, of course, because the music is by John Williams. A narrator's voice tells us that there is nothing quite as bad as being raised in a poor Irish Catholic neighborhood and the music tries to nudge us in that direction. But seeing as how the words were enough to have me thinking of all the other cinematic examples of the lives of the poor in Ireland, the music was just a bother.The movie is based on Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize winning memoir and knowing that is important because despite everything that happens in this film--or, more properly, because of it--young Frank is going to make it back to America and become a success. The film begins with the irony of an Irish family on a ship passing the Statue of Liberty going east as the McCourt's leave New York City to return to Limmerick. Malachy McCourt (Robert Carlyle) will have no more luck there finding a job to support his wife, Angela (Emily Watson) and four boys, but at least there is a family that can provide some support and a dole that will pay 13 shillings a week (5 for the rent, the rest to feed the family). However, unemployment is not the only constant in the McCourt family. There are deaths and births, whipping from the teachers at the school and the drunken singing of Malachy, all of which become part of the cycle of Frank's life.""Angela's Ashes"" is a story about poignant poverty, where the humor of the situations tries to win out in the end. Clearly Frank loves both his parents despite the ""shame"" they bring upon the family, his mother because she will beg for the scraps from the priests' table and his father because he will drink away not only his wages but the money sent for a new baby. I have to admit to some disappointment that there is not a point where Frank turns on his father (the way he does on his mother at one point), because what limited value the man might have had does not make it to the screen. But then Frank never seems to connect the survival of his family to the shame his mother endures, both private and public.The movie covers three main stages in Frank's life and there are a trio of young actors who capture each stage and their respective crucibles. For Young Frank (Joe Breen) it is his first Holy Communion and the onslaught of confessions that it engenders. Middle Frank (Ciaran Owens) faces a serious illness that does not succeed in killing him but does force him to be humiliated by going back a grade. Then there is Older Frank (Michael Legge), who bears the grave responsibility for sending a young woman's soul to hell and is working as one of Satan's emissaries on Earth, writing threatening letters to those who are behind in their payments to the local moneylender.But for each crucible there is a corresponding minor miracle. My favorite is when Frank is ordered to write an essay on what would have happened if Jesus had been born in Limmerick, but the most significant one comes when for once in his life, a death becomes a blessing for Frank McCourt and every poor soul he knows in the lane. There are certainly moments of warm humor in this film, as there are moments of pathos, but somehow not quite as many as I would expect given the director and his source material. However, I am having an urge to track down my wife's copy of McCourt's book and am in ""litigious anticipation"" of reading it for myself and proving my grand suspicion that all of the limitations of the film version of ""Angela's Ashes"" are in the adaptation and not the original material.",4,Alan Parker adapts Frank McCourt's memoirs,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,3715,"['took', 'while', 'get', 'interested', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'was', 'surprised', 'realize', 'problem', 'early', 'part', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'film', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'laying', 'too', 'thick', 'surprise', 'course', 'music', 'John', 'Williams', 'A', 'narrator', 'voice', 'tells', 'nothing', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'being', 'raised', 'poor', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'neighborhood', 'music', 'nudge', 'direction', 'seeing', 'how', 'words', 'were', 'enough', 'have', 'thinking', 'other', 'cinematic', 'examples', 'lives', 'poor', 'Ireland', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'bother.The', 'movie', 'based', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'memoir', 'knowing', 'important', 'everything', 'film', 'more', 'properly', 'young', 'Frank', 'going', 'make', 'back', 'America', 'become', 'success', 'film', 'irony', 'Irish', 'family', 'ship', 'passing', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'going', 'east', 'McCourt', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'return', 'Limmerick', 'Malachy', 'McCourt', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'luck', 'there', 'finding', 'job', 'support', 'wife', 'Angela', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'four', 'boys', 'least', 'family', 'can', 'provide', 'support', 'dole', 'will', 'pay', '13', 'shillings', 'week', '5', 'rent', 'rest', 'feed', 'family', 'However', 'unemployment', 'not', 'only', 'constant', 'McCourt', 'family', 'are', 'deaths', 'births', 'whipping', 'teachers', 'school', 'drunken', 'singing', 'Malachy', 'become', 'part', 'cycle', 'Frank', 'life', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'story', 'poignant', 'poverty', 'where', 'humor', 'situations', 'tries', 'win', 'out', 'end', 'Clearly', 'Frank', 'parents', 'shame', 'bring', 'family', 'mother', 'will', 'beg', 'scraps', 'priests', 'table', 'father', 'will', 'drink', 'away', 'not', 'only', 'wages', 'money', 'sent', 'new', 'baby', 'have', 'admit', 'disappointment', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'Frank', 'father', 'way', 'mother', 'one', 'point', 'what', 'limited', 'value', 'man', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'not', 'make', 'screen', 'then', 'Frank', 'never', 'connect', 'survival', 'family', 'shame', 'mother', 'endures', 'private', 'public.The', 'movie', 'three', 'main', 'stages', 'Frank', 'life', 'are', 'trio', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'capture', 'stage', 'respective', 'crucibles', 'Young', 'Frank', 'Joe', 'Breen', 'first', 'Holy', 'Communion', 'onslaught', 'confessions', 'Middle', 'Frank', 'Ciaran', 'Owens', 'serious', 'illness', 'not', 'succeed', 'killing', 'force', 'be', 'humiliated', 'going', 'back', 'grade', 'Then', 'Older', 'Frank', 'Michael', 'Legge', 'who', 'grave', 'responsibility', 'sending', 'young', 'woman', 'soul', 'hell', 'working', 'one', 'Satan', 'emissaries', 'Earth', 'writing', 'threatening', 'letters', 'who', 'are', 'payments', 'local', 'moneylender.But', 'crucible', 'corresponding', 'minor', 'miracle', 'favorite', 'when', 'Frank', 'ordered', 'write', 'essay', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Jesus', 'had', 'been', 'born', 'Limmerick', 'most', 'significant', 'one', 'when', 'once', 'life', 'death', 'blessing', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'poor', 'soul', 'lane', 'are', 'certainly', 'moments', 'warm', 'humor', 'film', 'are', 'moments', 'pathos', 'somehow', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'director', 'source', 'material', 'However', 'am', 'having', 'urge', 'track', 'down', 'wife', 'copy', 'McCourt', 'book', 'am', 'litigious', 'anticipation', 'reading', 'proving', 'grand', 'suspicion', 'limitations', 'film', 'version', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'are', 'adaptation', 'not', 'original', 'material']",N/A

130848,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792163087,Matthew Horner,"[8, 9]","Angela's Ashes is based on Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir about growing up in the 1930s in a poverty stricken family in Limerick, Ireland. The movie tries valiantly to be faithful to the book, and even the author has been endlessly quoted as to how fine an adaptation it is. Yet something has been lost in transition, and sadly it is much of McCourt's dark and often rude humor, which is one of two elements that made the book so readable. The other element was his writing style, which is marvelous. I will return to the humor issue later.After falling to succeed in New York, the McCourt family was forced to return to Ireland in 1935. Frank notes that they may be the only Irish family in history who immigrated back to that [then] miserably poor nation with it's [still] warring Protestants and Catholics. Within three years, the family loses three children to disease. When they first move back, they live in one room. When they finally get a rundown two-story row house, its front door opens onto the communal outhouse. It rains a lot in Limerick, and water runs into the first floor most of the year. The family resorts to living upstairs.Dad [Robert Carlyse] has difficulty finding work, and the family lives on the dole [welfare]. The cards are stacked against Dad. He is a Protestant in a Catholic town, he is full of pride, and he drinks. On the rare occasions he finds work, he drinks the pay away and ends up getting fired. He is the primary reason the family is so poor. Carlyse plays him as an intelligent, affable but weak man. Much has been made about this character. How could any father and husband sit by and see his family suffer so much? Carlyse said in an interview that he finally decided to play Dad as what he must have been - an alcoholic. And if you view him this way, it all makes more sense. Remember, too, that his wife, Angela [Emily Watson], was from a culture where being married to a drunk was a life sentence. In her world, there were few options.Besides the family woes, Frank must suffer through a dreadful Irish catholic school system where merely looking at a teacher the wrong way brings a swift rap on the knuckles. While the McCourt's were exceptionally poor, Ireland had been for many years one of the poorest nations in the Western world. As a result, even charities were often run by people who had become dour and mean-spirited. This is a study in survival. Frank eventually went back to America and became a noted English teacher and author. It seems a miracle that he did so.The cast is fine. Of special note are the three young actors (Joe Breen, Cianan Owens, Michael Legge) who play Frank at different ages from six to sixteen. All do a good job, and the transitions from one Frank to the other are seamless. Watson and Carlyse are at their usual best and do well at acting as if the three 'Franks' are all one boy.There are two things the movie does that detract from it. As I mentioned earlier, humor was a key ingredient in the book. In the film, most of that is lost. Some of the dialog is still there, but, because the tone of the film is so relentlessly grim, a lot of the lines are lost. It would have been better to have started the movie a little bit further into the book. As it is, within 25 movie minutes, Angela McCourt sees three of her children die. By this time, most viewers are totally bummed out or else wondering if this is for real. The narration throughout the picture is good, but it would have been so much better if McCourt had been the narrator. After all, they are his word, and he has a wonderful speaking voice.",3,"Captures the hardships, misses the humor and spirit",1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3597,"['Angela', 'Ashes', 'based', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'best-selling', 'memoir', 'growing', 'up', '1930s', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'family', 'Limerick', 'Ireland', 'movie', 'valiantly', 'be', 'faithful', 'book', 'even', 'author', 'been', 'endlessly', 'quoted', 'how', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'something', 'been', 'lost', 'transition', 'sadly', 'much', 'McCourt', 'dark', 'often', 'rude', 'humor', 'one', 'two', 'elements', 'made', 'book', 'so', 'readable', 'other', 'element', 'was', 'writing', 'style', 'marvelous', 'will', 'return', 'humor', 'issue', 'later.After', 'falling', 'succeed', 'New', 'York', 'McCourt', 'family', 'was', 'forced', 'return', 'Ireland', '1935', 'Frank', 'notes', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'Irish', 'family', 'history', 'who', 'immigrated', 'back', '[', 'then', ']', 'miserably', 'poor', 'nation', '[', 'still', ']', 'warring', 'Protestants', 'Catholics', 'three', 'years', 'family', 'three', 'children', 'disease', 'When', 'first', 'move', 'back', 'live', 'one', 'room', 'When', 'finally', 'get', 'rundown', 'two-story', 'row', 'house', 'front', 'door', 'communal', 'outhouse', 'lot', 'Limerick', 'water', 'runs', 'first', 'floor', 'most', 'year', 'family', 'living', 'upstairs.Dad', '[', 'Robert', 'Carlyse', ']', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'work', 'family', 'dole', '[', 'welfare', ']', 'cards', 'are', 'stacked', 'Dad', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'town', 'full', 'pride', 'rare', 'occasions', 'work', 'pay', 'away', 'up', 'getting', 'fired', 'primary', 'reason', 'family', 'so', 'poor', 'Carlyse', 'intelligent', 'affable', 'weak', 'man', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'character', 'How', 'could', 'father', 'husband', 'sit', 'see', 'family', 'suffer', 'so', 'much', 'Carlyse', 'said', 'interview', 'finally', 'decided', 'play', 'Dad', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'alcoholic', 'view', 'way', 'more', 'sense', 'Remember', 'too', 'wife', 'Angela', '[', 'Emily', 'Watson', ']', 'was', 'culture', 'where', 'being', 'married', 'drunk', 'was', 'life', 'sentence', 'world', 'were', 'few', 'family', 'woes', 'Frank', 'must', 'suffer', 'dreadful', 'Irish', 'catholic', 'school', 'system', 'where', 'merely', 'looking', 'teacher', 'wrong', 'way', 'swift', 'rap', 'knuckles', 'McCourt', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'poor', 'Ireland', 'had', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'one', 'poorest', 'nations', 'Western', 'world', 'result', 'even', 'charities', 'were', 'often', 'run', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'dour', 'mean-spirited', 'study', 'survival', 'Frank', 'eventually', 'went', 'back', 'America', 'became', 'noted', 'English', 'teacher', 'author', 'miracle', 'did', 'so.The', 'cast', 'fine', 'special', 'note', 'are', 'three', 'young', 'actors', 'Joe', 'Breen', 'Cianan', 'Owens', 'Michael', 'Legge', 'who', 'play', 'Frank', 'different', 'ages', 'six', 'sixteen', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'transitions', 'one', 'Frank', 'other', 'are', 'seamless', 'Watson', 'Carlyse', 'are', 'usual', 'best', 'do', 'well', 'acting', 'three', ""'Franks"", 'are', 'one', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'detract', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'humor', 'was', 'key', 'ingredient', 'book', 'film', 'most', 'lost', 'dialog', 'still', 'there', 'tone', 'film', 'so', 'relentlessly', 'grim', 'lot', 'lines', 'are', 'lost', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'started', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'further', 'book', '25', 'movie', 'minutes', 'Angela', 'McCourt', 'three', 'children', 'die', 'time', 'most', 'viewers', 'are', 'totally', 'bummed', 'out', 'else', 'wondering', 'real', 'narration', 'picture', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'McCourt', 'had', 'been', 'narrator', 'are', 'word', 'wonderful', 'speaking', 'voice']",N/A

Starting with the audion CD, I was enthralled in listening to Frank McCourt's own voice (almost as if he was telling his whole childhood story just to me). I actually was so disappointed when the book ended (because it had me so captivated), I couldn't wait to see the movie. So, I bought it. Now, the strengths of the movie are that you get to see some beautifulm and tragic, areas of  where the McCourts came from. The acting was pretty good. The bad part for me was that it seemed so depressing. It was raining constantly (which I know it does frequently in Ireland, but not every day and all the time. Even the audio CD talked of days with sunshine. I think the creator/director of the movie was trying awfully hard to make the McCourt's childhood similar to people living in some kind of an abusive/prison type setting. The audio CD had me laughing out loud at some of the most tragic parts of his life, as Frank inserted his phenominal sense of humor into everything. I didn't seem to get that same feel from the movie. Many scenes that were discussed in the book were either left out or glossed over in the movie all together. After hearing the CD, I felt enlightened, enchanted, craving to hear more of his life (so, I bought 'TIS last week). The movie just wanted to make me cry and get on my knees to thank God I wasn't raised in that area of Ireland during the 1940's. I recommend it only if you have read/are going to read the real book behind this.

Both of these actors bring a realism to this movie that is missing in many other movies with less than credible actors (like Cameron Diaz and Leonardo Di Caprio in Gangs of New York for instance). The Irish kids (their numerous children through the years) are also excellent and being Irish themselves also make it a pleasure to watch. No fake accents in this movie.But, that is a minor consideration, casting, accents etc... the story itself is excellent. Adapted from a Pulitzer Prize winner and with Frank McCourt's 'blessing' on it as well, this film kept me glued for the two plus hours it runs for. Even though it was sad seeing the poverty that McCourt grew up in, it makes you realize that there are many factors that keep people in poverty, part of it is a 'fault' of the economic system and part of it, the poor themselves. One cannot help but feel anger towards a father who decides to spend the children's money to 'help the Guinness family' or  has a pint on top of his dead child's casket while his children wait to bury their brother. There are so many sad moments in this film, that it's hard to keep track of them or remember them all. But through all those moments when you feel that they have reached the bottom of the heap (e.g. when they got evicted with no place to stay) something happens and they manage to pull through it to see another day. This is a movie of the power of the human spirit to endure and come out of those trials and tribulations stronger.There are those moments in the film where there is some comic relief and most of these moments centre around the misunderstanding perpetuated by the petty prejudices of being Irish catholic. For instance when the McCourt's grandmother blames the texture of his hair on the fact that he's a protestant from the north, or when McCourt throws up after his first communion there is the grandmother's concern about what they should do since he spewed out God (completely non-biblical concept I might add).The ONLY thing that might be disappointing is the ending, it didn't feel complete but apart from that I don't think I can praise this movie enough, very excellently done and a perfect 6 out of 5. This is definitely one of those movies I am going to own and not rent and it gives me some faith in the Pulitzer people choice of winners.

Seeing it at such an early age had a profound effect on my outlook on life. Recently re-watching it as a 21-year old was like reliving an old dream. I couldn't believe I was having the same thoughts and feelings as I did so many years before. I'm not familiar with the book, but watching this film is like an endurance run for your emotions. There are so many devastating moments that by the end, you'd think you'd be numb to it, but there always seems to be another heart-wrenching moment around the corner. Some of the images in this movie have stuck with me for life.Angela's Ashes put my life into perspective at an early age. I was emotionally invested in the characters, and through their struggles I learned a lot about life. All I could think was how lucky I was that all my family members are alive and we have a roof over our heads. Its easy to take those things for granted, and this movie does a good job of making you appreciate them a whole lot more.The production value of Angela's Ashes is top-notch. The film does an extraordinary job of taking the viewer on a journey back in time to Limerick, Ireland in the early 40's. It was a time of great hardship, especially for Frank McCourt's family, who suffer greatly throughout the film. I personally love the imagery of old Ireland with its rustic stone structures and foggy weather. The settings are accurate and well-detailed, contributing greatly to the overall realism of the film. The tone of the film is very dark, gray, and mundane, and that dark tone is reflected in the bleak color palette. There are very few vibrant colors to be found, only gray, black and the occasional green. It truly succeeds in painting a bleak portrait of the McCourts life.The actors in the film are mostly very good. Of course when dealing with child actors you always have to consider the fact that they're, well, children. So there's only so much they can do in a heavily dramatic film like this that requires some serious acting chops to pull off. I think the child actors do a good job in their roles, especially the little kid who plays Frank in the beginning. Like I said earlier, I really identified with his character as a kid, so that makes a good performance in my book.For some reason this film slipped under the radar both critically and commercially. It was overshadowed by the book and as a result has been mostly forgotten it seems.

130866,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792163087,Reviewer,"[19, 27]","For anyone who read the novel by Frank McCourt, ""Angela's Ashes"" would've been one of the most anticipated movies of the year.  The book, which is terrific, takes  you on an emotional roller coaster ride without cessation;  there are passages so gripping it becomes almost unbearable at times.  The  movie, however, directed by Alan Parker and starring Robert Carlyle and  Emily Watson, unfortunately doesn't come close to capturing the  desperation, hopelessness and pathos of the book.  McCourt's  autobiographical account of growing up in extreme poverty in Limerick,  Ireland, is a gut-wrenching experience; that he even survived his childhood  under such conditions as he recounts is a minor miracle in itself.  His  father, Malachy McCourt Sr., (played by Carlyle in the movie), wasn't a bad  man, in an evil sense; he was just no good.  He loved his family, but was  too weak, prideful and irresponsible to even begin to look after them at  all.  Though reasonably intelligent, apparently, he was nevertheless lazy  to the point of slothfulness, couldn't keep a job even if he lucked into  one, and most of the time didn't bother looking.  He never had money to  keep bread on the table, but somehow always managed to have enough for  tobacco and for a ""pint"" at one of the local pubs.  Carlyle, a fine actor  (great in ""The Full Monty""), never seems to get to the core of this  admittedly complex character; the ability to mine the depths of what really  made Malachy tick somehow eludes him.  His performance is passable, but  it's all on the surface.  Emily Watson fares little better with her  Angela.  A Gifted actress (Breaking the Waves"" and ""Hilary and Jackie""),  she handles what she is given to work with aptly enough, but there is so  much more that simply goes untapped.  She, too, never really seems to get  to the soul of Angela, whose whole life was nothing less than tragic.  And  with such rich source material from which to draw, it's puzzling as to how  this movie failed to deliver the emotional impact promised by the story.  That Parker chose to use the same voice as the novel to tell it is one  reason, possibly.  The matter-of-fact, stoic narrative that worked to great  advantage in the novel simply doesn't translate well to film, at least not  in this case.  Here, it merely falls flat; somehow it gives an ambivalence  to the proceedings that keeps the young McCourt, his family and their  circumstances, at arms length throughout.  Visually, the movie is stunning,  though; the cinematography successfully captures the bleakness of Limerick  and the surrounding countryside. Parker, however, fails to blend it all in  sufficiently enough with the actual story to make it effective.  Using the  same approach for visual content as he does for the emotional, he succeeds  only in presenting an image without enticement.  He asks his audience to  bring more to this than they can, given what they are being offered; it  simply isn't enough.  Still, it in no way diminishes the artistic merit of  the photography, which is, in fact, the high mark of this whole endeavor.  The young McCourt is portrayed in three successive stages of his youth by  Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge; all able performances.  The  supporting cast includes Ronnie Masterson (Grandma Sheehan Keating),  Pauline McLynn (Aunt Aggie Keating), Liam Carney (Uncle Pa Keating) and  Eanna MacLiam (Uncle Pat Keating).  For those who haven't read the novel,  ""Angela's Ashes"" will provide some touching moments, though nothing  particularly memorable.  This should have been a ten-hanky movie; instead,  it leaves the tear ducts dry and the heart just a little empty.  This is an  unfulfilling rendering of McCourt's acclaimed account of his childhood and,  on a larger scale, the failure of society and of the Church to truly  minister to all it's members.  The humor, which is laced throughout the  novel, is lost here as well, which is nothing less than negligence on the  part of the filmmakers, because they have excluded what was undoubtedly one  of young McCourt's basic tools of survival.  In the end, then, this film,  which should have been remarkable, was one of the biggest disappointments  of the year.

130867,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0792163087,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 11]","Angela's Ashes (Alan Parker, 1999)Good lord, this movie is long.There are some decent performances here. Robert Carlyle's surprisingly minor role as the scion of Clan McCourt stands out, but then we should be used to Carlyle turning in above average performances now. And Joe Breen, as the youngest of the three Franks we see, turns in an excellent debut performance. This is a kid from whom we should be hearing more in the future.But two and a half hours? And this just for part one? Oh, come now.Alan Parker has been in a somewhat steady decline for the past decade or so, and this overbearing, overdetailed mush is no step in the reverse direction. Parker, whose penchant for overly-detailed novel adaptations is becoming something of a standing joke (remember The Road to Wellville?), was allowed to run rampant with Frank McCourt's overly-long Pulitzer-winning memoir here. One wonders if Hollywood attempted to rein him in at all, and if they did, how long the original script ran. The mind quails.In case you've been in a cave since 1996, Angela's Ashes is the first part of Frank McCourt's sweeping autobiography, detailing the years between four, when his parents packed the kids up and they became, in McCourt's words, &quot;the only family moving BACK to Ireland,&quot; and eighteen, when Frank leaves Ireland once again for New York. (One idly wonders about the title, since Angela, Frank's mother, is alive throughout, and last I looked, one had to be dead to be cremated.) McCourt notes, in a somewhat understated manner, at the beginning that he &quot;had a miserable childhood.&quot; That kind of understatement, carried through this film, could have made it into a kind of grand ironic farce, or at the very least a sharp satire on Irish family life in poverty in a timeframe roughly akin to America's  great depression. But it's obvious that Parker is something of a zealot where this book is concerned. He's a true believer. And he's not going to let any possible different interpretations of the book get in the way of what he wants the viewer to see. And that is the unforgivable sin. Always.After that opening remark, there is nothing at all subtle about this movie. And there should have been. The racism which the family suffers at first slowly fades away, as is the gradual nature of all such things, only to be replaced by a different form of racism (instead of Yankees, they're now Nothernmen); that process alone could have been the basis for a well-executed two-and-a-half hour film, but instead, Parker presents it in a series of stop-motion scenes that, while advancing the plot, still seem as if they were placed in the film specifically to show the viewer that &quot;this is racism!&quot; We'd never have picked it up on our own, no sir!Angela's Ashes is the cinematic version of the Al Gore campaign. It talks to us as if we're five years old, never allows us to form our own opinions, and thinks it's in the right for it. **",2,Did I say long?,977788800,"12 26, 2000",2000,2960,"['Angela', 'Ashes', 'Alan', 'Parker', '1999', 'Good', 'lord', 'movie', 'are', 'decent', 'performances', 'here', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'surprisingly', 'minor', 'role', 'scion', 'Clan', 'McCourt', 'out', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'Carlyle', 'turning', 'above', 'average', 'performances', 'now', 'Joe', 'Breen', 'youngest', 'three', 'Franks', 'see', 'excellent', 'debut', 'performance', 'kid', 'whom', 'should', 'be', 'hearing', 'more', 'future.But', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'just', 'part', 'one', 'Oh', 'come', 'now.Alan', 'Parker', 'been', 'somewhat', 'steady', 'decline', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'overbearing', 'overdetailed', 'mush', 'step', 'reverse', 'direction', 'Parker', 'penchant', 'overly-detailed', 'novel', 'adaptations', 'becoming', 'something', 'standing', 'joke', 'remember', 'Road', 'Wellville', 'was', 'allowed', 'run', 'rampant', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'overly-long', 'Pulitzer-winning', 'memoir', 'here', 'One', 'Hollywood', 'attempted', 'rein', 'did', 'how', 'long', 'original', 'script', 'ran', 'mind', 'quails.In', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cave', '1996', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'first', 'part', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'sweeping', 'autobiography', 'detailing', 'years', 'four', 'when', 'parents', 'packed', 'kids', 'up', 'became', 'McCourt', 'words', 'quot', 'only', 'family', 'moving', 'BACK', 'Ireland', 'quot', 'eighteen', 'when', 'Frank', 'Ireland', 'once', 'again', 'New', 'York', 'One', 'idly', 'title', 'Angela', 'Frank', 'mother', 'alive', 'last', 'looked', 'one', 'had', 'be', 'dead', 'be', 'cremated', 'McCourt', 'notes', 'somewhat', 'understated', 'manner', 'beginning', 'quot', 'had', 'miserable', 'childhood.', 'quot', 'kind', 'understatement', 'carried', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'kind', 'grand', 'ironic', 'farce', 'very', 'least', 'sharp', 'satire', 'Irish', 'family', 'life', 'poverty', 'timeframe', 'roughly', 'akin', 'America', 'great', 'depression', 'obvious', 'Parker', 'something', 'zealot', 'where', 'book', 'concerned', 'true', 'believer', 'not', 'going', 'let', 'possible', 'different', 'interpretations', 'book', 'get', 'way', 'what', 'viewer', 'see', 'unforgivable', 'sin', 'Always.After', 'opening', 'remark', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'racism', 'family', 'suffers', 'first', 'slowly', 'away', 'gradual', 'nature', 'such', 'things', 'only', 'be', 'replaced', 'different', 'form', 'racism', 'instead', 'Yankees', ""'re"", 'now', 'Nothernmen', 'process', 'alone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'basis', 'well-executed', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'film', 'instead', 'Parker', 'series', 'stop-motion', 'scenes', 'advancing', 'plot', 'still', 'seem', 'were', 'placed', 'film', 'specifically', 'show', 'viewer', 'quot', 'racism', 'quot', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'own', 'sir', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'cinematic', 'version', 'Al', 'Gore', 'campaign', ""'re"", 'five', 'years', 'old', 'never', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'right', '**']",N/A
130868,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0792163087,Roland E. Zwick,"[11, 13]","In the very opening scene of Alan Parker's `Angela's Ashes,' we are informed by the narrator and main character, Frankie McCourt, in a phrase that turns out to be a masterpiece of understatement, that he had a  `miserable childhood' - but just how miserable we may not be quite  adequately prepared to see. Based on the author's Pulitzer Prize winning  autobiographical memoir, this compelling film plunges us directly into the  wretchedness and squalor of life in Depression-ridden Ireland, a setting  overflowing with disease, starvation, joblessness and despair. Indeed, by  the time the film has hit the 25-minute mark, we have already witnessed the  deaths of no fewer than three of Frankie's little siblings. The film, like  the novel on which it is based, never flinches from portraying the brutal  reality of the life the people of this dreary town must endure.Yet, the  film is also, at times, rich in humor and a sense of that unquenchable  optimism that somehow exists in even the most hopeless of circumstances.  Frankie, despite the harsh conditions of his life, remains a boy focused on  the good things that come his way, enduring even a loving but utterly  irresponsible ne'er-do-well father (beautifully played by `The Full Monty's  Robert Carlyle) with an indulgence and tolerance borne of filial devotion.  As Frankie grows from young boy, dutifully fulfilling the parental role for  his younger brothers, to a man verging on the edge of adulthood, he feeds  on his dreams of moving to America to start a new life full of hope and  promise. The people and situations he encounters on this road create a  stunning tapestry of life, teeming with bitterness and coldness it is true,  but also with occasional, albeit momentary, displays of warmth, kindness  and compassion - whether they be from a seemingly bitter aunt who, much to  his astonishment, buys Frankie a brand new set of clothes in which to start  his new job, a teacher who inspires him to see life beyond the  circumscribed limits of this dreary Irish town or a compassionate priest  who counsels Frankie in a moment of dark despair. These help to  counterbalance the deadening effects of his father's thoughtlessness and  drunkenness, the death of his first love by consumption, the often brutal  treatment he receives at the hands of both his teachers and fellow  classmates. And all the while there stands his mother, the anchor that  holds him firmly in place, a woman beaten down by poverty, the untimely  deaths of her children, the fecklessness of her otherwise loving husband -  yet a woman so full of the quality of stoic self-sacrifice that it is from  she that Frankie draws the strength he needs to move on in his  life.Emily Watson provides a luminous portrait of this woman,  triumphantly conveying the longsuffering reserve that helps shield her from  the ugliness and dreariness of her life and provides her with the strength  to carry on and build into her children a sense of moral rectitude. And the  three boys who portray Frankie at various stages of the drama are utterly  perfect in their wide-eyed naturalism, as they look upon a world often  incomprehensible in its drabness and cruelty.It seems to be becoming a  truism lately that, if you want to see the bleakest portrayal of life  imaginable, go to see a film set in Ireland. Nowhere does the sun shine  less frequently, nowhere do the drab colors of gray and brown so heavily  predominate, nowhere does poverty seem so all encompassing and inescapable.  The Ireland of `Angela's Ashes' is surely no exception. The filmmakers,  moreover, cast a scathing eye on the mindless superstition, bigotry and  hypocrisy to be found in much of the blindly pro-Southern Ireland,  anti-Protestant, anti-British, anti-Northern Ireland attitude perpetuated  by the Catholic Church there in the 1930's. Thus, in the depths of  McCourt's autobiographical story lies a diatribe with its roots planted  deep in political and social protest. Yet, because of our fascination with  the boy at the center of the narrative, these qualities filter through  subtly, never dominating the proceedings. `Angela's Ashes' is rather, from  beginning to end, a moving story about goodhearted, ordinary people  learning to cope with the immense hardships life throws their way. In the  long run, it certainly makes one happier with one's own lot in life.  `Angela's Ashes,' for those who can take its uncompromising view of  reality, is a richly rewarding experience.",4,moving drama,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,4494,"['very', 'opening', 'scene', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'are', 'informed', 'narrator', 'main', 'character', 'Frankie', 'McCourt', 'phrase', 'out', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'understatement', 'had', 'miserable', 'childhood', 'just', 'how', 'miserable', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'adequately', 'prepared', 'see', 'Based', 'author', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'autobiographical', 'memoir', 'compelling', 'film', 'plunges', 'directly', 'wretchedness', 'squalor', 'life', 'Depression-ridden', 'Ireland', 'setting', 'overflowing', 'disease', 'starvation', 'joblessness', 'despair', 'Indeed', 'time', 'film', 'hit', '25-minute', 'mark', 'have', 'already', 'witnessed', 'deaths', 'fewer', 'three', 'Frankie', 'little', 'siblings', 'film', 'novel', 'based', 'never', 'flinches', 'portraying', 'brutal', 'reality', 'life', 'people', 'dreary', 'town', 'must', 'endure.Yet', 'film', 'also', 'times', 'rich', 'humor', 'sense', 'unquenchable', 'optimism', 'somehow', 'even', 'most', 'hopeless', 'circumstances', 'Frankie', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'life', 'boy', 'focused', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'way', 'enduring', 'even', 'loving', 'utterly', 'irresponsible', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'father', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Full', 'Monty', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'indulgence', 'tolerance', 'borne', 'filial', 'devotion', 'Frankie', 'young', 'boy', 'dutifully', 'fulfilling', 'parental', 'role', 'younger', 'brothers', 'man', 'verging', 'edge', 'adulthood', 'dreams', 'moving', 'America', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'full', 'hope', 'promise', 'people', 'situations', 'road', 'create', 'stunning', 'tapestry', 'life', 'teeming', 'bitterness', 'coldness', 'true', 'also', 'occasional', 'albeit', 'momentary', 'displays', 'warmth', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'be', 'seemingly', 'bitter', 'aunt', 'who', 'much', 'astonishment', 'Frankie', 'brand', 'new', 'set', 'clothes', 'start', 'new', 'job', 'teacher', 'who', 'see', 'life', 'circumscribed', 'limits', 'dreary', 'Irish', 'town', 'compassionate', 'priest', 'who', 'Frankie', 'moment', 'dark', 'despair', 'help', 'counterbalance', 'deadening', 'effects', 'father', 'thoughtlessness', 'drunkenness', 'death', 'first', 'love', 'consumption', 'often', 'brutal', 'treatment', 'hands', 'teachers', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'while', 'mother', 'anchor', 'firmly', 'place', 'woman', 'beaten', 'down', 'poverty', 'untimely', 'deaths', 'children', 'fecklessness', 'otherwise', 'loving', 'husband', 'yet', 'woman', 'so', 'full', 'quality', 'stoic', 'self-sacrifice', 'Frankie', 'strength', 'move', 'life.Emily', 'Watson', 'luminous', 'portrait', 'woman', 'triumphantly', 'conveying', 'longsuffering', 'reserve', 'shield', 'ugliness', 'dreariness', 'life', 'strength', 'carry', 'build', 'children', 'sense', 'moral', 'rectitude', 'three', 'boys', 'who', 'portray', 'Frankie', 'various', 'stages', 'drama', 'are', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'wide-eyed', 'naturalism', 'look', 'world', 'often', 'incomprehensible', 'drabness', 'cruelty.It', 'be', 'becoming', 'truism', 'lately', 'want', 'see', 'bleakest', 'portrayal', 'life', 'imaginable', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'set', 'Ireland', 'Nowhere', 'sun', 'shine', 'less', 'frequently', 'nowhere', 'do', 'drab', 'colors', 'gray', 'brown', 'so', 'heavily', 'predominate', 'nowhere', 'poverty', 'seem', 'so', 'all', 'encompassing', 'inescapable', 'Ireland', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'surely', 'exception', 'filmmakers', 'moreover', 'cast', 'scathing', 'eye', 'mindless', 'superstition', 'bigotry', 'hypocrisy', 'be', 'found', 'much', 'blindly', 'pro-Southern', 'Ireland', 'anti-Protestant', 'anti-British', 'anti-Northern', 'Ireland', 'attitude', 'perpetuated', 'Catholic', 'Church', '1930', 'Thus', 'depths', 'McCourt', 'autobiographical', 'story', 'diatribe', 'roots', 'planted', 'deep', 'political', 'social', 'protest', 'fascination', 'boy', 'center', 'narrative', 'qualities', 'filter', 'subtly', 'never', 'dominating', 'proceedings', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'rather', 'beginning', 'end', 'moving', 'story', 'goodhearted', 'ordinary', 'people', 'learning', 'cope', 'immense', 'hardships', 'life', 'way', 'long', 'run', 'certainly', 'one', 'happier', 'one', 'own', 'lot', 'life', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'uncompromising', 'view', 'reality', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'experience']",N/A

Emily Watson turns in a  workmanlike performance as McCourt's dedicated and determined mother.  Robert Carlyle is outstanding as the alcoholic father, kind and loving but  with the skewed sense of priorities that can only result from alcoholism.  He plays this role to perfection.Those of you who are thinking about  renting this movie should be advised that although it is quite good and  well-acted, the viewing experience is not likely to be uplifting.  Although  this is not a motion picture about alcoholism per se, &quot;Angela's  Ashes&quot; is much like that sort of picture in that it is incredibly  depressing.  I found myself several times comparing it to &quot;Leaving Las  Vegas&quot;, another incredibly powerful yet quite depressing motion  picture.  It's so powerful that I find myself not wanting to relive the  experience, meaning it's unlikely I'll ever watch this film again.  This is  not a complaint but rather a testament to the power of this motion picture.  The only complaint that I could make is that the pacing is painfully slow,  as if to make the viewer suffer with the family.

Two brothers grow up with a mother who struggles and begs to keep her family alive and together. The predictably antisocial father squanders every bit of money he ever earns on truckloads of alcohol.We are shown slices of life in the coming-of-age up process, and how Frank finally gets the money to leave Ireland and come to America. The boys were no cherubs, but they survived without getting into too much trouble, and became literary lions in America. That's pretty much it.The acting is good, especially by the boy who plays the teenage version of Frank McCourt. The cinematography stretches and scampers to be oh-so-noir, and is thus overwrought with dark pigmented colors almost all of the time. Background music is run of the mill, one that you would typically expect from movies of this nature.What boggles me though is the touchy-feely title of the book/movie: Angela (the mother) does not die.

130879,A27A3AZA7L12N6,0792163087,Stephen M. Bauer,"[5, 7]","My wife and I rented the video of, Angela's Ashes. I had read the book and it's sequel, 'Tis, both by Frank McCourt. It's an autobiography, about growing up in the direst poverty in Brooklyn and Ireland.Although the book showed the bleakest of poverty, I thought it was wildly funny on the whole. The movie focused more on the sad aspects alone. The frequent black and white footage of the dark and gloomy rain soaked lanes of Irish cities cast a black mood over me. Living conditions were one step better than living in a dumpster. I can see where, to a nave viewer unfamiliar with the ways things were, the conditions might seem funny at first. They are so extreme; one couldn't possibly believe that people actually lived like that. It must be a joke! But millions of Irish grew up just like that and many died under the conditions, without ever growing up.The institutional church and all authority come out looking pretty bad. There are the priests and brothers who slam doors in their faces when they go to them for help. When Frank gets a job delivering telegrams, he finds out that at the houses of the Religious they don't give tips to poor boys that deliver telegrams.There's an overfed priest handing out leftover food from the rectory table to destitute women at the back door. Going before the government Dole board and the St. Vincent DePaul Society is a humiliating, dehumanizing experience. The school-teachers are mostly hostile and domineering. Corporal punishment is the norm.Priests rain down fire and brimstone from the pulpits. They threaten eternal damnation to the fires of hell for sins of sexual impurity, to boys who have had multiple brothers and sisters die of hunger and disease and who are so hungry they lick the grease off newspapers used to wrap food.Strangely, despite the harshness of the church, Frank prays, especially to Saint Francis of Assisi. A humane Franciscan priest hears his badly needed confession and gives him absolution.The role of Frank's father was played perfectly. He appears exactly as he does in the book. The author and director made a fair attempt to paint a three dimensional character. I feel like I understood him, from the outside, or from a distance as much as one can understand a man like that. As Frank says, he was like three different people. One was the man who told great children's stories and the man so proud to have fought with the IRA for Ireland and challenged his toddler sons to pledge to die for Ireland. There was the man who looked for work and could never find any. And then there was the man who went out and spent all his money on booze while his children starved, some to death. Others died to disease, aggravated by malnutrition.As much as the viewer may hate or despise the father, the bonds between father and son ultimately hold. At one point Frank's father goes to England for a good paying factory job. Months go by; he doesn't send a penny home. He spends it all in the pubs of England. He shows up in the lane on Christmas Eve. He doesn't have a penny for the family. He has a box of candy with him, one piece for each kid, for Christmas day. On Christmas day, the father suddenly leaves to return to England. As his father is walking out through the alleyways, Frank tries to secretly follow him. Frank says to himself, ""If I was in America, I could say I love you dad, I love you, but I was in Limerick and in Limerick they'd laugh at you if you said that. You're only allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win; otherwise, they'd think you're soft in the head.",4,"Growing up dirt poor, but full of life, in Ireland.",1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,3573,"['wife', 'rented', 'video', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'sequel', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'autobiography', 'growing', 'up', 'direst', 'poverty', 'Brooklyn', 'Ireland.Although', 'book', 'showed', 'bleakest', 'poverty', 'thought', 'was', 'wildly', 'funny', 'whole', 'movie', 'focused', 'more', 'sad', 'aspects', 'alone', 'frequent', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'rain', 'soaked', 'lanes', 'Irish', 'cities', 'cast', 'black', 'mood', 'Living', 'conditions', 'were', 'one', 'step', 'better', 'living', 'dumpster', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'nave', 'viewer', 'unfamiliar', 'ways', 'things', 'were', 'conditions', 'might', 'seem', 'funny', 'first', 'are', 'so', 'extreme', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'believe', 'people', 'actually', 'lived', 'must', 'be', 'joke', 'millions', 'Irish', 'grew', 'up', 'just', 'many', 'died', 'conditions', 'ever', 'growing', 'up.The', 'institutional', 'church', 'authority', 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'pretty', 'bad', 'are', 'priests', 'brothers', 'who', 'slam', 'doors', 'when', 'go', 'help', 'When', 'Frank', 'job', 'delivering', 'telegrams', 'out', 'houses', 'Religious', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'tips', 'poor', 'boys', 'deliver', 'overfed', 'priest', 'handing', 'out', 'leftover', 'food', 'rectory', 'table', 'destitute', 'women', 'back', 'door', 'Going', 'government', 'Dole', 'board', 'St.', 'Vincent', 'DePaul', 'Society', 'humiliating', 'dehumanizing', 'experience', 'school-teachers', 'are', 'mostly', 'hostile', 'domineering', 'Corporal', 'punishment', 'norm.Priests', 'rain', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'pulpits', 'threaten', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'fires', 'hell', 'sins', 'sexual', 'impurity', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'multiple', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'die', 'hunger', 'disease', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'hungry', 'lick', 'grease', 'newspapers', 'used', 'wrap', 'food.Strangely', 'harshness', 'church', 'Frank', 'especially', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'A', 'humane', 'Franciscan', 'priest', 'badly', 'needed', 'confession', 'absolution.The', 'role', 'Frank', 'father', 'was', 'played', 'perfectly', 'exactly', 'book', 'author', 'director', 'made', 'fair', 'attempt', 'paint', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'feel', 'understood', 'outside', 'distance', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'man', 'Frank', 'was', 'three', 'different', 'people', 'One', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'told', 'great', 'children', 'stories', 'man', 'so', 'proud', 'have', 'fought', 'IRA', 'Ireland', 'challenged', 'toddler', 'sons', 'pledge', 'die', 'Ireland', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'work', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'then', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'out', 'spent', 'money', 'booze', 'children', 'starved', 'death', 'Others', 'died', 'disease', 'aggravated', 'malnutrition.As', 'much', 'viewer', 'may', 'hate', 'despise', 'father', 'bonds', 'father', 'son', 'ultimately', 'hold', 'one', 'point', 'Frank', 'father', 'England', 'good', 'paying', 'factory', 'job', 'Months', 'go', ""n't"", 'send', 'penny', 'home', 'pubs', 'England', 'up', 'lane', 'Christmas', 'Eve', ""n't"", 'have', 'penny', 'family', 'box', 'candy', 'one', 'piece', 'kid', 'Christmas', 'day', 'Christmas', 'day', 'father', 'suddenly', 'return', 'England', 'father', 'walking', 'out', 'alleyways', 'Frank', 'secretly', 'follow', 'Frank', 'was', 'America', 'could', 'say', 'love', 'dad', 'love', 'was', 'Limerick', 'Limerick', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'said', ""'re"", 'only', 'allowed', 'say', 'love', 'God', 'babies', 'horses', 'win', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'think', ""'re"", 'soft', 'head']",N/A

No characters with any admirable qualities, endlessly wallowing in their own sense of despair.  Parents who can't be bothered to do something to provide their children with the bare essentials, but who can always find the money for booze or cigarettes.  The father, a low life, big mouthed, lazy good for nothing who drinks all the time, doesn't bother to provide for his family, but refuses to accept charity so that his children can eat.  A mother who would rather function as a prostitute to a filthy, degraded, disgusting relative than go out and do some work.  People talk in reviews here about this woman's great self-sacrifice, but I noticed that she never failed to have a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, though her kids were going hungry and having to walk through the overflow of a toilet just to get into their house.  I can't see any great self-sacrifice there - just laziness, lack of self-respect and self-indulgence.I can't see anything funny in this film, and certainly nothing noble in any of the characters.  Can't imagine what all the hoopla is about, or how anyone could consider such a tragic and infuriating situation, brought about by adults who refuse to be adults and take responsibility, funny in any way at all.",1,No redeeming social value ...,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1310,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hot', 'bothered', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'characters', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'endlessly', 'wallowing', 'own', 'sense', 'despair', 'Parents', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'do', 'something', 'provide', 'children', 'bare', 'essentials', 'who', 'can', 'always', 'find', 'money', 'booze', 'cigarettes', 'father', 'low', 'life', 'big', 'mouthed', 'lazy', 'good', 'nothing', 'who', 'time', ""n't"", 'bother', 'provide', 'family', 'accept', 'charity', 'children', 'can', 'eat', 'mother', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'function', 'prostitute', 'filthy', 'degraded', 'disgusting', 'relative', 'go', 'out', 'do', 'work', 'People', 'talk', 'reviews', 'here', 'woman', 'great', 'self-sacrifice', 'noticed', 'never', 'failed', 'have', 'cigarette', 'hanging', 'mouth', 'kids', 'were', 'going', 'hungry', 'having', 'walk', 'overflow', 'toilet', 'just', 'get', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'great', 'self-sacrifice', 'just', 'laziness', 'lack', 'self-respect', 'self-indulgence.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'funny', 'film', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'noble', 'characters', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'hoopla', 'about', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'consider', 'tragic', 'infuriating', 'situation', 'brought', 'adults', 'who', 'refuse', 'be', 'adults', 'take', 'responsibility', 'funny', 'way']",N/A

I think this is an extremely well-made movie, adapts the book wonderfully (though it doesn't cover the ashes part of the title)and one powerfully acted, designed, scored (wonderful John Williams score) and directed movie.  If I had two nitpicks it's that the three Franks don't look like they'd be the same person and the dead horse looks odd, but the latter is on screen for seconds and each one of the Franks are excellent in their own right.  There's no wishing any of the other Franks were still playing the role.  As soon as the years progress and we see a new Frank, the actor makes us forget the other two until the touching Eclipse scene.  What I found interesting this year is finding faces I recognize from Ballykissangel (the superb BBC series).  The entire movie may seem episodic but it goes full circle and I dare anyone to watch it without shedding a tear or two.  But back to the humor issue, this film balances the hearbreak and the humor fantastically.

Even more rare are films that are successful in such a venture. ANGELA'S ASHES is such a film. The film is an almost word for word adaptation of McCourt's beloved memoir and is full of all the novel's pathos and sympathy. The characters are real and the story is moving.The narration of the film both adds and detracts from the movie's impact. The novel was very depressing, but was also filled with a self-depreciating wit and humor that lightened the seriousness of the situations described. In the movie, almost all of the scenes that contain any humor are the ones that include the narration. At the same time, the narration often does distract the audience from the drama occurring on screen.The acting is superb and the story is touching. And even though I read the book and knew the outcome of McCourt's adventures, the movie left me in tears at the end.
