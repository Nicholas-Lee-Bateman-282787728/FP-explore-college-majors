Davis,"[0, 0]","If you're like me, the only reason you watched ""Night at the Museum:Battle of the Smithsonian"", was because you had such fond memories of the first movie. Night at the Museum 1 had an inventive storyline, larger than life characters and was easy to get into and love. The 2nd movie however, took a bit to get into. Some of the new characters aren't as memorable as the first lot of characters, however a few stand out. Amelia Earhart (played effectively by Amy Adams) is wonderful, and by far my favourite character from either movie (She has tons of moxie). The Albert Einstein bobble-heads are adorable, and I loved the Jersey Shore inspired Atlas statue.

1229084,A14N5L5T089VX3,B001PR0Y4O,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[58, 64]","Most sequels either fail miserably at trying to ""top"" the original (""Miss Congeniality 2"" springs to mind), or succeed beyond all expectations (""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" is a good example).""Night at the Museum 2, The Battle of the Smithsonian"" hits neither of these extremes: it has no pretensions about being a great film.  It seems the writers and producers just wanted to make a film that their audience would enjoy, and they succeeded.  Certainly, the original film was better and more original in many respects, and there is lots of continuity with the first film, as many of the characters have returned.  There are also some notable additions to the cast, such as Amy Adams - who is superb as Amelia Earhart (as many of my fellow reviewers here have noted).Yet, the scene stealer in the film though is not Ms. Adams, but Hank Azaria, who plays the Egyptian Pharaoh Kahmunrah: the evil and inept older brother of Ahkmenrah (the Pharaoh from the original film).  Azaria's Karloff-esque character is really well done.  One of the best scenes in the film is when Kahmunrah and Ben Stiller's character (Larry Daley) argue over the fate of Jedidiah (played by Owen Wilson).  I heard a rising tide of belly laughs all around me as this scene progressed: a salute to the old time vaudeville comedic dialog routines, played to near perfection by two excellent actors.  Laurel and Hardy would have been proud!Kudos to the Smithsonian for the unprecedented access and support they provided to the producers of this film.  I've visited the Washington Mall and Smithsonian Museums many times, and it was great to see them on the big screen, and great fun seeing the havoc and mayhem that special effects allowed the film's characters to inflict upon our national treasures.I like this film because it is honest with itself and its audience, and consistently delivers laughs and smiles.  Is it a great film?  No.  Is it funny?  Definitely.  Is it a great way to spend a couple of hours with your better half, or the kids?  Absolutely.  For that reason I'll give it Four Stars: enjoy!",4,"More of the Same?

In spite of all these little things, the movie ends up being fairly entertaining. It's a pretty decent mix of contemporary gags mixed with historical references. Some of the historical jokes might be even better than the original, but the storyline isn't quite as good. It almost seems as though they were inventing things to fill a sequel.

The original is Stiller's timeless comedic qualities at his best and to compare the first and second isn't quite fair.  We are looking at some great computer animation as well as the funny characters; new and old.  Azaria is hilarious and probably had the crew laughing like crazy in between takes. I sat in a packed theater and there was never a silent moment; always laughter on a scale of 1-10, it was consistent at 5 and raised the bar to 10 on many occasions. Stiller and his buddies aren't going to see Oscar's for this movie but it is a light hearted, funny movie with the old characters mix it up with the old.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I can't really explain why in complex detail, but something definitely felt off about the second Night at the Museum film called Battle of the Smithsonian.  Maybe I went in expecting something different, I don't know.I think the biggest problem is the choice of main characters.  Obviously we have Ben Stiller playing lead role, and of course Robin Williams makes another hysterical appearance, but nobody else really caught my attention.You had Amelia Earhart dominating WAY too much of the storyline.  I'm surprised the writers thought she was a strong enough character to become one of the main characters tagging along with Ben Stiller on one amazing journey.I felt some of the museum people and animals from the original should have been included more frequently, such as the monkey.  To the films credit though, it *does* include another hilarious monkey slapping scene with Ben's character and the monkey slapping each other silly.  Also the little miniature person portrayed by Owen Wilson is a fairly popular returning character.Besides that, most of the other creatures from the museum only make occasional appearances so we're basically treated to a whole new cast of wild creatures.  This is surprising to me.  Expect to see a LOT of soldiers taking up most of the storyline.There were also some really weird appearances by these singing floating statue angel Cupid-like creatures.  They were seen floating above a water fountain and singing love songs.  I enjoyed them, but mostly for their highly unusual demeanors.Abraham Lincoln's appearance was definitely unique to say the least.  Let's just say, he's HUGE!One really cool thing about the movie is the special effects.  It seriously looks really weird and believable seeing these extinct animals walking around like they're really there.  Fantastic special effects.All the action scenes felt like they weren't thought out very clearly, and felt severely rushed the way everything was crammed together.  It was really strange and made the film feel disjointed.

This time, Stiller (Larry Daley) is getting rich selling dumb products like a glow in the dark flashlight on infomercials. But he has a void inside. He really misses the museaum and all its exhibits that come to life. Daley is shocked to learn that many of the exhibits are being shipped to the Smithsonian archives. There's a bigger problem. The artifact that makes the exhibits come to life is going as well.This movie is really all about the action in the Smithsonian and the fun when the new exhibits come to life. Hank Azaria is great as an ancient pharoh that wants Daley to figure out a secret code that will unleash the power of the dead soldiers...wait, I didn't quite understand the plot. Let's just say sides form between the good (General Custer, Amelia Earhart, Abe Lincoln, Albert Einstien) and the bad (Ivan the Terrible, Napolean, Al Capone) and a battle ensues.Some of the good include the paintings that come to life and what happens when the tablet is brought to the air and space building. There is pure pandemonium as everything comes to life. For the bad, well, this movie is just mindless fun. The son is wasted and so is Ricky Gervais.

1229116,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001PR0Y4O,Caleb Williams,"[2, 4]","The first Night at the Museum movie was a film I really enjoyed as, for a film that would primarily be aimed at attracting a young audience, it contained some marvellous humour coupled with stunning CGI effects. Ben Stiller is an amazing comic actor and would only be complemented by the plethora of additional comic actors supporting him in the first movie. Legends such as Mickey Rooney, Dick Van Dyke and Robin Williams featured in the first movie and made it that much more pleasurable to watch. Alongside the legends, we had comic greats such as Steve Coogan and Stiller's long time acting partner, Owen Wilson. The lot combined created one amazingly enjoyable movie for the whole family. The sequel, however, was not so enjoyable.The story takes place 3 years after the original and former night guard of the New York, Museum of Natural History, Larry Daley has left his job and become a massive success as the CEO of his own company. He hasn't visited the Museum for a while and when he does finally pop by to say hello to the old gang, he finds out all his favourite exhibits are being moved to the national archives under the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. Larry realises where his real loyalties lie and travels to the Smithsonian to rescue his old friends, Octavius (Coogan) and Jedediah (Wilson). While there, the ancient Egyptian tablet brings to life all the exhibits within the Smithsonian archive releasing the evil Pharaoh, Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) who plans to use the tablet to open a gate to the underworld, releasing his army of minions.This sequel really seeks to up the ante in the case of magical exhibits being brought to life, including everything in the National Air and Space Museum and even Abraham Lincoln. When done well things such as that can really work, but I felt the bringing to life of the Abraham Lincoln of the Lincoln monument was a real stretch to increase the bizarre and ended up falling really flat. The inclusion of Hank Azaria who's primarily famous for his voicing in the Simpsons does actually work brilliantly as he becomes a marvellously eccentric evil. With his lisping ways and flamboyant clothing, you struggle to take him seriously, but he is a really funny presence that would not have been done better by any other actor.Coogan and Wilson are also magnificent parts within the film as would be expected and it was made even more delightful by the odd Partridge-esque display from Coogan's character. The character of Amelia Earheart played by Amy Adams sought only to impress as the distracting good looking female to carry the more chauvinistic viewers amongst us, as I really saw no other purpose for the character. Ben Stiller was fantastic as always and there was some excellent dialogue within that made it a very enjoyable watch.Both Night at the Museum movies are good in their own respect, but in all honesty, this was trying much too hard to fit more in than the original.

1229122,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001PR0Y4O,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 3]","You know something's wrong when you can spot the logistical issues in an escapist fantasy. Not only is ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" just as overblown as its predecessor from 2006, it's also weighed down by severe lapses in logic. Yes, I know that fantasies aren't concerned with logic, but still, there are some things that even suspension of disbelief can't gloss over. How, for example, do these magical museum exhibits know about the histories of the people and places they represent? They aren't the actual people. They're only interpretations made of wax and such. I just can't buy into the fact that a life sized sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) would know anything about the accomplishments of the real President of the United States. The same goes for Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck), General Custer (Bill Hader), Amelia Earheart (Amy Adams), Al Capone (Jon Bernthal), Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), and most importantly, Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria), who wants to steal a special Egyptian tablet and resurrect an army of the dead. How would a wax figure have access to an army, living or otherwise?The plot: Larry Daley, our hero from the first ""Night at the Museum"" (Ben Stiller), has given up his job as a night watchman for New York's Natural History Museum to become a famous inventor and TV personality. He then learns that the museum plans to pack up many of its magical exhibits and ship them to the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., where they're to be permanently stored in an underground archive. Worse yet, the magical Egyptian tablet that enabled them to come alive every night will remain in New York.One night, Larry gets an urgent phone call from the tiny cowboy figurine Jedediah (Owen Wilson). Apparently, the mischievous monkey that gave Larry so much trouble stole the tablet, so now, not only has everything in the Smithsonian come to life, but the Kahmunrah statue also wants to get his hands on the tablet. It's up to Larry to get to Washington and save his friends, and the world, from certain doom. When he arrives, the adventure-loving statue of Amelia Earheart takes it upon herself to be his sidekick. They spend the rest of the film going from one place to another, bumping into newer and more elaborate exhibits-come-to-life. They also get into discussions about living life to the fullest, which, of course, relates to Larry's dissatisfaction with his post-night guard career.I have to say, I enjoyed Amy Adams in this film. In spite of the fact that her performance is basically a vocal parody of 1930s colloquial speak, she does it so skillfully and with such sincerity that I'm willing to overlook the stereotypical overtones. I'm not compelled to be as forgiving in the case of Hank Azaria, who reduces the villain to mere comedy relief with long-winded passages of dialogue and a needlessly lispy British accent. His character gets so tedious in such a short period of time that I'm amazed the filmmakers didn't ask him to tone it down a bit. Owen Wilson's country/western accent was also a bit irritating, probably because it does nothing more than play into a preconceived notion of how cowboys actually spoke. He sounds not like a historical figure, but rather a spoof of a historical figure.Almost every other exhibit is just a shameless display of special effects and pop culture references. Darth Vader and Oscar the Grouch make appearances at a certain point, as does a walking, talking Lincoln Memorial statue. The Jonas Brothers lend their singing voices to a trio of marble cherubs that can't seem to shut up. Even George Forman makes a cameo appearance as a guest on Larry's infomercial for a glow-in-the-dark flashlight (don't even bother trying to analyze that one).In spite of all this, there is one genuinely clever scene. To escape a rampaging group of well-armed pharaoh guards, Larry and Amelia run into the famous World War II photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square on Victory Day.But on the whole, most of this film is a tired and overplayed series of verbal gags, most of which are dragged out to the point of monotony. Some of the gags are purely physical, and this definitely includes the scene of Larry and two monkeys slapping each other silly. It may be funny at first glance, but in as little as five or six seconds, it becomes stale and repetitive. Then there's the scene of Jedediah and his Roman General friend, Octavius (Steve Coogan), running in slow motion through a frantic mob; because they're so tiny, they can only attack everyone's feet, and even then, they do little more than minor damage. But the real problem this film suffers from is a lack of plausibility, and obviously, I'm not referring to museum exhibits coming to life; it's implausible to me that these magical exhibits could know anything about the historical figures they're based on. Both ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" and its predecessor conveniently chose to gloss over such things.",3,These Exhibits Are So Lifelike,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,4991,"['know',

The first one was an interesting idea, somewhat cheesy, but still original.  The same premise could have worked well for the second movie, but unfortunately, the sequel, ""Battle of the Smithsonian"", was aimless in its plot direction most of the time, and caricatured characters from history like Abraham Lincoln.  Theodore Roosevelt, played by Robin Williams, was a believable character from history in the first one.  I don't recall that any of them was believable enough in the sequel.  Amelia Earhart, a brash feminist, didn't take the main character (played by Ben Stiller) in a meaningful direction.  I recall there were a couple good visual parts, which were the hangar which he and Amelia Earhart use to escape, and where they get temporarily trapped inside the famous black and white photograph ""V-J Day in Times Square"" and lose a cell phone, which one of the WWII vets picks up and puzzles over.  Also, I don't remember specific instances of stupid dialogue, but I remember feeling like it was worse writing than the first movie.Forgive me for not getting more specific, but my general remembrance of the movie is of displeasure:  a) the story is rather aimless a lot of the time, b) there isn't a historical character who helps Ben Stiller grow and who has the level of believability Robin Williams' Theodore Roosevelt did, and c) the script is stupider than the first one.",1,A retrospective review of my experience seeing it in 2009,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1479,"['still', 'remember', 'well', 'seeing', '2009', 'theater', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'still', 'original', 'same', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'second', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'sequel', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian', 'was', 'aimless', 'plot', 'direction', 'most', 'time', 'caricatured', 'characters', 'history', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'believable', 'character', 'history', 'first', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'was', 'believable', 'enough', 'sequel', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'brash', 'feminist', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'meaningful', 'direction', 'recall', 'were', 'couple', 'good', 'visual', 'parts', 'were', 'hangar', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'use', 'escape', 'where', 'get', 'temporarily', 'trapped', 'famous', 'black', 'white', 'photograph', 'V-J', 'Day', 'Times', 'Square', 'lose', 'cell', 'phone', 'one', 'WWII', 'vets', 'up', 'puzzles', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'specific', 'instances', 'stupid', 'dialogue', 'remember', 'feeling', 'was', 'worse', 'writing', 'first', 'movie.Forgive', 'not', 'getting', 'more', 'specific', 'general', 'remembrance', 'movie', 'displeasure', 'story', 'rather', 'aimless', 'lot', 'time', 'b', ""n't"", 'historical', 'character', 'who', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'grow', 'who', 'level', 'believability', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'did', 'c', 'script', 'stupider', 'first', 'one']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

The museum has also undergone a few changes - namely most of the exhibits are being shipped into storage.

With some of the greatest comedians out there such as Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Hank Azaria, Robin Williams, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Steve Coogan, Jay Baruchel, Ricky Gervais and Ed Helms; how could you not be rolling on the floor with laughter?It's been three years since we left Stiller's character Larry Daley in the first film, as a night guard for the Museum of Natural History. Now he has moved on to much bigger things with his life, thanks to the success of his latest invention: the glow-in-the-dark flashlight.Things go sour when Larry learns all of his pals from the Museum are to be shipped off to Washington D.C., where they will be stored in the underground archives of the Smithsonian Institute. Larry simply can't allow that to happen, so he intervenes to save the day.The magical tablet from the first film that allows all the characters to come to life at night, is of course sent with them to the Smithsonian. Things get very interesting when all of the characters already housed there, come to life as well. They include Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams), Al Capone, Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon, Colonel Custard (Ed Helms) and a fictional one that was my absolute favorite: Kahmunrah, played hilariously by Hank Azaria.Kahmunrah is a nasty Egyptian tyrant who wants to take over the world by using the tablet to bring back his army of the dead. He gains the help of Al Capone, Napoleon and Ivan the Terrible to work as his henchmen. He forces Larry to be his errand boy, by holding Owen Wilson's character Jedediah, hostage.While I very much missed seeing Carla Cugino reprise her role as Larry's girlfriend Rebecca, he does at least have someone to share the screen with. Larry is joined by Amelia Earhart for the majority of the film as his loyal sidekick and Amy Adams is as enjoyable as ever.  She plays a somewhat cartoony version of the real-life queen of the sky, but it's a blast to watch. I'm just stuck wondering why there was no explanation as to what happened to Rebecca.We see some new things that we hadn't in the first film. Perhaps the most entertaining being some classic paintings coming to life. I don't know the names of them, but 9 out of ten people will surely recognize them. To escape trouble, Larry and Amelia actually jump into one of them; the famous black and white of a sailor kissing his gal in a crowded street. Stiller deliver's one of the funniest lines in the film when he is able to make a call on his cell, ""Wow, four bars in 1945."" We also enjoy seeing a huge animated Abe Lincoln come to life from the Lincoln memorial; generously voiced by Hank Azaria.Bill Hader is without a doubt the most underrated man to ever appear on Saturday Night Live, so I'll take a minute to give him some props. His impersonation of the very late Colonel Custard was hysterical. The film would have been better served with a few more scenes featuring this talented comedian.My two favorite moments in the film are those between Stiller and Jonah Hill who also plays a night guard, and Stiller and Hank Azaria. It's more than obvious they were given free reign from director Shawn Levy, to test the waters of improvisation, and the film is remarkable because of it.Having also directed the first film, as well as Cheaper by the Dozen, the remake of The Pink Panther and Big Fat Liar, Shawn Levy clearly knows comedy.

This is typical Hollywood lack of proper planning at it's worst.

Not even Robin Williams' Teddy Roosevelt portrayal (what should have been a high point) or the sorry portrayal of Amelia Earhart as a love interest was enough to save this disaster of a comedic joke of a movie unworthy of laughter.

And if they were going to do a film, it would be in a much bigger scale and trying to make the film better than the original and sure enough, this time around, the film worked with the Smithsonian.""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" went on to make over $412 million worldwide and now the film is available on Blu-ray via a 3-disc set which includes the Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" is featured in 1080p, Widescreen (2:35:1) and once again, Twentieth Century Fox delivers with vibrant and detailed picture quality.  You see the textures within the costumes, the metal lining of the pharaohs headdress, the detail of various settings and overall, a colorful film.  Even the prop/characters such as the Abraham Lincoln, the fossilized T-Rex, Teddy Roosevelt look very good.  There are scenes where the green screen effect wasn't too convincing (ie. Amelia and Larry on a plane outside of the museum) and almost looked a bit campy.  But you can't help but be hooked in by the awesome production of the film and watching this film in HD really brings out the beauty of the film.  So overall, picture quality for ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" is solid.As for the lossless audio of ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"", the film tends to be front channel heavy.  I actually was expecting the film to be quite immersive and there are some scenes (one with Amelia crashing into the museum with the plane or Abe Lincoln taking on the underworld soldiers) that sound quite awesome, but it was not filling up the soundscape that I was quite hoping for.  But for the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable, Silvestri's music also comes out quite nicely through the front channels as well.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Director Shawn Levy - Very informative, upbeat and detailed audio commentary by Shawn Levy.

But the film seems like a clutter of comedians and characters trying to get their time on the screen and director Shawn Levy tried to focus too much on these crazy antics of those characters than focus on the overlying storyline.If anything, the film is your classic cat and mouse game with the evil pharaoh trying to catch Larry and Amelia for the tablet.  It's a simple storyline that tries to include jokes and things that just come out of left field and just sputters downward.  Darth Vader and Sesame Street's Oscar the Grouch in a scene together?  Or an octopus trying to hug and kiss Larry?  The humor of some of the jokes just didn't fly well with me and felt some of the comedy was not funny at all.Granted, it was nice to see some of ""The Office"" (USA and UK) cast in the film, Hank Azaria showcasing his voice talent for the character of the Pharaoh and giving the character a comical spin and although short,  the improv scene with Stiller and Jonah Hill was fun.  I do admit that I felt my attention of the film was more for Amy Adam's Amelia Earhart character.  Adam's is a talented actress and seeing her act on screen was definitely one of the highlights of the film.And as for Ben Stiller, although he was in the film, I felt that his character was downgraded and most of the focus was on the surroundings rather than his character.  And I suppose it depends what one expects from this film.  Those wanting more props, special effects, gags and action...then this film is for you.Of course, ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"", like its predecessor,  is looked at as a family film.  A film where kids can be entranced by the surroundings of the museum and almost be taken to a fantasy world.  Seeing how my son enjoyed both films tremendously, I suppose the formula works especially since the film has achieved tremendous box office success worldwide.But in the end, I felt the film was mediocre at best but as a Blu-ray release was quite solid when it came to picture quality and definitely for the inclusion of so many special features.  And for children who loved the film,  the fact that the Blu-ray release  comes with the Blu-ray disc, a DVD and a digital copy of the film is pretty awesome.Overall, ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" may not be a great film but it does make for a good popcorn flick with awesome production and also has plenty of fun moments.  But as long as you are not looking for a serious plot or anything deep, then you'll definitely be entertained.  As for the Blu-ray release, it's a pretty solid release with 3-discs, awesome picture quality and a lot of special features.  So, I have no doubt in my mind that fans of the film will definitely enjoy this release.",4,"The sequel to ""Night at the Museum"" features more gags, higher production and action...but is it any

1229158,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B001PR0Y4O,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[1, 1]","In NatM2 Ben Stiller has gotten what he wished for, no not an Oscar, but a very successful inventor, yet even though he is very successful, he is not happy. Of course, he doesn't remember the old saying of 'Do what you love, and you'll love what you do,' so Ben makes a stop at the museum, for the first time in 2 years. When he arrives, he finds that the museum is being closed to replace all the exhibits with advanced video projections, and the old exhibits being shipped to the Smithsonian. Only one problem, the tablet that makes everything come to life is also going to the Smithsonian, which means that everything in the largest museum in the world is going to come to life. Well, that ain't good. Only problem is that Hank Azaria wants the tablet, and he's going to be his most intimidating to open up a portal to the dead using the tablet. Trust me, the story is just a thread to link all these history gags loosely together.While the old cast seems a bit tired and doing-it-for-the-money acting, the movie is helped by its new additions, namely the ever lovely Amy Adams as the bold Amelia Earhart & the ever funny Bill Hader as the wacky but cowardly General Custer. Both actors give a new life to characters that otherwise would have been like the rest of the movie, stale.The movie plays out in the old thinking of how a sequel is done. Instead of having a true reason to build on the old characters honoring the first film, the movie comes back just to come back, and only adds a change of scenery & new characters. But I must admit, while much of the humor is flat, I could not resist those Einstein bobbleheads!Sitting through NatM2 overall is not a bad watch, but neither is it a good one. Sure, the kids will latch onto humor in this movie, but you'll just be comparing it to the far better first movie. Rent it, and you might like it, just don't expect too much because it all just seems a bit too forced. But because of this movie, I love Amy Adams that much more...",3,Skirmish at the Smithsonian That Nobody Seems To Notice,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,1986,"['NatM2', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'gotten', 'what', 'wished', 'not', 'Oscar', 'very', 'successful', 'inventor', 'yet', 'even', 'very', 'successful', 'not', 'happy', 'course', ""n't"", 'remember', 'old', 'saying', 'what', 'love', ""'ll"", 'love', 'what', 'do', 'so', 'Ben', 'stop', 'museum', 'first', 'time', '2', 'years', 'When', 'museum', 'being', 'closed', 'replace', 'exhibits', 'advanced', 'video', 'projections', 'old', 'exhibits', 'being', 'shipped', 'Smithsonian', 'Only', 'one', 'problem', 'tablet', 'everything', 'come', 'life', 'also', 'going', 'Smithsonian', 'everything', 'largest', 'museum', 'world', 'going', 'come', 'life', 'Well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'good', 'Only', 'problem', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'tablet', 'going', 'be', 'most', 'intimidating', 'open', 'up', 'portal', 'dead', 'using', 'tablet', 'Trust', 'story', 'just', 'thread', 'link', 'history', 'gags', 'loosely', 'old', 'cast', 'bit', 'tired', 'doing-it-for-the-money', 'acting', 'movie', 'helped', 'new', 'additions', 'namely', 'ever', 'lovely', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'bold', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'ever', 'funny', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'wacky', 'cowardly', 'General', 'Custer', 'actors', 'give', 'new', 'life', 'characters', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rest', 'movie', 'stale.The', 'movie', 'out', 'old', 'thinking', 'how', 'sequel', 'done', 'Instead', 'having', 'true', 'reason', 'build', 'old', 'characters', 'honoring', 'first', 'film', 'movie', 'back', 'just', 'come', 'back', 'only', 'change', 'scenery', 'new', 'characters', 'must', 'admit', 'much', 'humor', 'flat', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'Einstein', 'Sitting', 'NatM2', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'watch', 'good', 'one', 'Sure', 'kids', 'will', 'latch', 'humor', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'comparing', 'far', 'better', 'first', 'movie', 'Rent', 'might', 'like', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'forced', 'movie', 'love', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'much', 'more']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

Ben Stiller is back as Larry Daley, who, in the first film took the job as the night guard of the museum and found out that the exhibits came to life. This film focuses more on Larry trying to save the exhibits from being taken over by the Smithsonian, with Hank Azaria playing Kahnunrah, an evil pharaoh. I was kind of glad to see that they dropped the whole subplot with Larry's relationship with the woman and kid in this one and just focused on the action within the museum, mainly because it just seemed like that was superficially thrown in to the first movie.Although the sequel seemed a little thrown together, I still rank it slightly higher than the first. Stiller's presence and humor are better timed in this film, and, being that there were characters (such as Octavius, Jedediah, Theodore Roosevelt) that we knew from the first one, it made the film gel a little more. There are also a few new characters added into this one, such as Napoleon, Al Capone, General Custer, and Amelia Earhart. Amelia Earhart emerges as someone who takes an interest in Larry, and helps him on his quest to save the exhibits.  Some of the jokes are repeated a little too often (Napoleon= short jokes, General Custer jokes), but the film itself has great effects (like the first) and comes together at the end. Clearly, though, this is set up for a third installment, and you feel that about half way through.  While it is hokey with cheesy dialogue at times, it's still a fairly fun and clean film, so the kids can watch this and enjoy it without hearing profanity.Being that this is fantasy and a kid's film I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece, so I was pleasantly surprised with the results.",4,"More of the same, but a little better than the first one",1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,1792,"['pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'back', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'who', 'first', 'film', 'took', 'job', 'night', 'guard', 'museum', 'found', 'out', 'exhibits', 'came', 'life', 'film', 'more', 'Larry', 'trying', 'save', 'exhibits', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'Smithsonian', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'playing', 'Kahnunrah', 'evil', 'pharaoh', 'was', 'kind', 'glad', 'see', 'dropped', 'whole', 'subplot', 'Larry', 'relationship', 'woman', 'kid', 'one', 'just', 'focused', 'action', 'museum', 'mainly', 'just', 'seemed', 'was', 'superficially', 'thrown', 'first', 'sequel', 'seemed', 'little', 'thrown', 'together', 'still', 'rank', 'slightly', 'higher', 'first', 'Stiller', 'presence', 'humor', 'are', 'better', 'timed', 'film', 'being', 'were', 'characters', 'such', 'Octavius', 'Jedediah', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'knew', 'first', 'one', 'made', 'film', 'gel', 'little', 'more', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'added', 'one', 'such', 'Napoleon', 'Al', 'Capone', 'General', 'Custer', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'someone', 'who', 'interest', 'Larry', 'quest', 'save', 'exhibits', 'jokes', 'are', 'repeated', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'Napoleon=', 'short', 'jokes', 'General', 'Custer', 'jokes', 'film', 'great', 'effects', 'first', 'together', 'end', 'Clearly', 'though', 'set', 'up', 'third', 'installment', 'feel', 'way', 'hokey', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'times', 'still', 'fairly', 'fun', 'clean', 'film', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'profanity.Being', 'fantasy', 'kid', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'results']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

Its so bad that they made a major goof at the end....he announces that it is 1 hr from sunrise, so they need to get on the prop plane and get from the Smithsonian in DC to New York city.  Trouble is, it would take 90-120 min by that kind of plane.  After arriving, they mention that Emilia has to get back to the Smithsonian prior to sunrise (another 90 min return).  There are times it seems they were looking for fillers to fill the time, it doesn't seem to be a smooth story.  One of the worst parts is when he meets the security guard at the Smithsonian - 5 minutes of utter boredom with a few dumb jokes put in.  I was yelling ""boring.""My other beef is the political correctness of this movie, but thats pretty common with Hollywood.  The people brought back new in this movie: Of the good guys/gals/, the female (Emilia) and minority (Tuskegee flyers) are all seen very positive, but the 2 whites - Abraham Lincoln and Gen George Custer are both negative.  Abraham Lincoln was made to look like a babbling idiot. The portrayal of Gen Custer was not only inaccurate but insulting. As another commentator on here wrote ""This fool was not the George Custer who won the Metal of Honor at First Manassas, nor the George Custer who defeated Jeb Stewart at Hannibal in the Battle of Gettysburg.""  Two of the three bad guys were Napoleon and Ivan the terrible, and again made to look stupid.  Can you imagine if they had made Emilia or the Tuskegee folks come back like that?  Of course not.On the only positive side, the CGI/graphics (I rented the Bluray version) are very good and the animals seem real, as well as having the paintings come to life (one wonders if they stole this from Harry PotterThis is a movie to rent, but i am not spending money to add to a collection.

Like the original, NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2 is great family entertainment - no bad language, no blood, no sex, and no real violence.  Just lots of fun, laughter, and a pleasant evening together.In NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2, night guard Larry Daley has moved on and is getting rich selling his wacky inventions on television infomercials.  But his heart isn't really in it; he isn't as happy as he thought would be. When Larry discovers that many of his beloved friends from the exhibits at the New York City Museum of Natural History are being shipped to permanent storage at the Smithsonian archives, he rushes to try to help them.  But when the Egyptian tablet that brings his friends to life is accidentally sent along to the Smithsonian, Larry has a whole new set of problems on his hands.  With every exhibit in the Smithsonian museums and the archives below coming to life, Larry must enlist the aid of a spunky Amelia Earhart, a vain and grandiose General George Custer, and a bouncy pack of Einstein bobble-heads to save the day, and make everything right.In NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2 is a laugh out loud funny movie, full of some very creative action sequences.  The museum exhibits still come to life, but this time they include famous paintings that you can jump into (reminiscent of Mary Poppins), pop art sculptures that chase you around, all manner of aircraft (from the Wright Brothers' first plane to a launching Apollo space craft), the gifts from the gift shop, and even a gigantic Abraham Lincoln from the Lincoln Memorial.  Hank Azaria as the evil pharaoh and Amy Adams as a perky, independent Amelia Earhart are delightful additions to the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2 cast, and Robin Williams is as charming as always Teddy Roosevelt.  The special effects are pretty cool, and the jokes and slapstick keep on coming.Is the story predictable?  Yes.  Did we care?  No!  NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN is a great family summer film.  It won't change your life, but it will help you forget your troubles for a few hours and have some fun with your loved ones.  The entire family will grin, giggle, and out-right guffaw, with several good, old fashioned belly-laughs thrown in.

I found the talent that dropped in to be fun and charming as well...but...the inclusion of a few of them in more than just a scene or two would have maybe made the movie even more fun.My husband thought that the plot line was less than compelling. I kind of agree with that one. The angst of a father-down-on-his-luck and desperate to keep his relationship with his son from the original is replaced by a ubersuccessful businessman who's forgotten the meaning of life and has left important people sitting on the sidelines. Turns out the museum friends are some of those important people and there have been some changes in the building and the whole situation is about to turn ugly.Overall, I liked the movie. Didn't love it. Probably won't buy it, but it was entertaining and family friendly. I appreciated the clever and creative fun, and the work that went into it. The actors seemed to have fun with it.

He's the head of a company and hawks his own products on late night TV infomercials.  In fact, he's just days away from signing a deal with Wal-Mart.But he isn't as happy as he used to be.  One night, he decides to visit his old friends at the Museum of Natural History, only to discover that they are about to be shipped to deep storage at the Smithsonian.  When he gets a late night cry for help from Jedediah (a credited Owen Wilson), he heads to DC to help.It seems the gold tablet that brought the exhibits to life has other powers.  The ancient Egyptian ruler Kah Mun Ra (Hank Azaria) knows this and wants to use it to take over the world.  He teams up with Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), Napoleon (Alan Chabat), and Al Capone (Jon Bernthal) to get the tablet and unleash the undead.  Only Larry can stop him, with the help of friends old and new including Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams).  Can he do it?While I enjoyed the first one when I first watched it, I will admit it had to grow on me.  Not so with this one.  I loved it right out of the gate.  The comedy is great, with so many little moments that made me laugh I suspect I will be watching it several times before I catch all the jokes.The plot is something completely new as well.  I couldn't help comparing it at times to The Mummy, even though this movie never forgets it is a family comedy.  Many of our friends from the first movie are reduced to smaller roles, but that helps keep the story fresh and entertaining on this go around.That's not to say anyone is missing.  The main original cast all come back and does fine with the parts they have.  The new cast perfectly fits into the franchise as well, making this feel like a brand new adventure with friends.Of course, the special effects are everywhere.

But for the most part, sequels tend to fall short. Fortunately such is not the case with NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: BATTLE FOR THE SMITHSONIAN.Ben Stiller returns as Larry Daley, the newly hired night watchman from the initial film. The movie starts with Larry no longer working there but now a successful businessman and pitch artist selling gadgets he creates on TV like a glow in the dark flashlight.A stop by the old museum on his way home one night leads Larry to discover that most of the pieces are about to be shipped out to the Smithsonian to make way for more up to date items. Having developed a little pull with the board, Larry tries to put a stop to it.Before this can happen he gets a call from Jebediah (Owen Wilson) the pint sized cowboy from the first film. It seems the Dexter, the troublesome monkey we met in part one, has stolen the Egyptian tablet that enables them all to come to life. Not only that but Pharaoh Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria), the diabolical brother of Ahkmenrah, plans on using the tablet to open the door to the Underworld and return with his warriors from the dead to take over the world.Larry hop, skips and jumps to D.C and the Smithsonian where he has a funny encounter with a guard there. This results in his heisting a security badge from the guard and walking through the buildings in an attempt to save his friends. But, as is expected, things don't quite go as planned.Before he can rescue them, Kahmunrah catches Larry who escapes with a little bit of help from Gen. George Armstrong Custer (Bill Hader) and Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams). Kahmunrah then teams up with a young Al Capone (John Bernthal), Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) and Napoleon (Alain Chabat). It seems to work as Kahmunrah captures Larry and then places Jebediah into an hourglass, sand pouring over him, giving Larry just that amount of time to decipher the tablet so that he can unlock the door to the Underworld.With the help of Amelia, Larry takes off through the Smithsonian in an attempt to solve the puzzle. Along the way they encounter paintings, statues and pieces come to life as they did at the Museum of Natural History in New York. It takes a visit to the National Air and Space Museum where he remembers seeing bobble heads of Einstein that Larry discovers the answer.A final showdown between Larry and his friends and Kahmunrah to see who will control not just the museum but the world ensues once the secret is unlocked. Figures from history around the world come to life in a battle royal, winner take all.The thing that makes both of these films so enjoyable is the way they bring history to life. It's not just about the museum or Larry, though his life is the centerpiece of each film, but about a past we rarely think about or expect our children to know about any longer. Perhaps these films will be a way to get them interested and delve into that knowledge on their own.Stiller turns in a great performance, never overbearing or demanding attention be paid only to him. He shares the screen willingly to the point where at one time I wondered if he was the center, only to realize he'd been there all along, just never demanding attention. A good actor knows how to share the screen and here, Stiller does an admirable job of that.The special effects are top of the line, equaling if not surpassing the first film. The art exhibit sequence where we see pictures on the wall come to life and statues we've known for years get up and walk is hilarious. And a certain picture in this area results in a funny joke you need to watch part of the credits for to see.This movie is the sort of movie the entire family can enjoy together. It doesn't dumb down to the adults and it isn't over the top for youngsters. It's a movie that entertains from start to finish. .",5,NOT A ONE NIGHT STAND,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,3907,"['Sequels', 'are', 'tough', 'sell', 'end', 'Sure', 'people', 'will', 'rush', 'see', 'based', 'love', 'first', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'sequels', 'tend', 'fall', 'short', 'Fortunately', 'such', 'not', 'case', 'NIGHT', 'AT', 'THE', 'MUSEUM', 'BATTLE', 'THE', 'SMITHSONIAN.Ben', 'Stiller', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'newly', 'hired', 'night', 'watchman', 'initial', 'film', 'movie', 'Larry', 'no', 'longer', 'working', 'there', 'now', 'successful', 'businessman', 'pitch', 'artist', 'selling', 'gadgets', 'TV', 'glow', 'dark', 'flashlight.A', 'stop', 'old', 'museum', 'way', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'Larry', 'discover', 'most', 'pieces', 'are', 'be', 'shipped', 'Smithsonian', 'make', 'way', 'more', 'up', 'date', 'items', 'Having', 'developed', 'little', 'pull', 'board', 'Larry', 'put', 'stop', 'it.Before', 'can', 'happen', 'call', 'Jebediah', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'pint', 'sized', 'cowboy', 'first', 'film', 'Dexter', 'troublesome', 'monkey', 'met', 'part', 'one', 'stolen', 'Egyptian', 'tablet', 'come', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'Pharaoh', 'Kahmunrah', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'diabolical', 'brother', 'Ahkmenrah', 'using', 'tablet', 'open', 'door', 'Underworld', 'return', 'warriors', 'dead', 'take', 'over', 'world.Larry', 'hop', 'skips', 'jumps', 'D.C', 'Smithsonian', 'where', 'funny', 'encounter', 'guard', 'there', 'results', 'heisting', 'security', 'badge', 'guard', 'walking', 'buildings', 'attempt', 'save', 'friends', 'expected', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'planned.Before', 'can', 'rescue', 'Kahmunrah', 'catches', 'Larry', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'help', 'Gen.', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Kahmunrah', 'then', 'up', 'young', 'Al', 'Capone', 'John', 'Bernthal', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Napoleon', 'Alain', 'Chabat', 'work', 'Kahmunrah', 'Larry', 'then', 'places', 'Jebediah', 'hourglass', 'sand', 'pouring', 'giving', 'Larry', 'just', 'amount', 'time', 'decipher', 'tablet', 'so', 'can', 'unlock', 'door', 'Underworld.With', 'help', 'Amelia', 'Larry', 'Smithsonian', 'attempt', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'way', 'encounter', 'paintings', 'statues', 'pieces', 'come', 'life', 'did', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'New', 'York', 'visit', 'National', 'Air', 'Space', 'Museum', 'where', 'seeing', 'bobble', 'heads', 'Einstein', 'Larry', 'answer.A', 'final', 'showdown', 'Larry', 'friends', 'Kahmunrah', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'control', 'not', 'just', 'museum', 'world', 'secret', 'unlocked', 'Figures', 'history', 'world', 'come', 'life', 'battle', 'royal', 'winner', 'take', 'all.The', 'thing', 'films', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'bring', 'history', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'museum', 'Larry', 'life', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'past', 'rarely', 'think', 'expect', 'children', 'know', 'longer', 'Perhaps', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'way', 'get', 'interested', 'delve', 'knowledge', 'own.Stiller', 'great', 'performance', 'never', 'overbearing', 'demanding', 'attention', 'be', 'paid', 'only', 'shares', 'screen', 'willingly', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'time', 'wondered', 'was', 'center', 'only', 'realize', ""'d"", 'been', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'just', 'never', 'demanding', 'attention', 'good', 'actor', 'how', 'share', 'screen', 'here', 'Stiller', 'admirable', 'job', 'that.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'line', 'equaling', 'not', 'surpassing', 'first', 'film', 'art', 'exhibit', 'sequence', 'where', 'see', 'pictures', 'wall', 'come', 'life', ""'ve"", 'known', 'years', 'get', 'up', 'walk', 'hilarious', 'certain', 'picture', 'area', 'results', 'funny', 'joke', 'need', 'watch', 'part', 'credits', 'see.This', 'movie', 'sort', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'down', 'adults', ""n't"", 'top', 'youngsters', 'movie', 'start', 'finish']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

1229228,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B001PR0Y4O,Marshall Lord,"[3, 3]","This review is based on having been to see the film in the cinema with my family.Although the film can stand on its own, it is a sequel to the original ""A Night at the Museum"" film (2006), which was very loosely based on the book by by Milan Trenc. There are a lot of little details which will be amusing or poignant to viewers who had seen the first film but will go completely over the heads of those who have not. I would advise anyone who is thinking of going to see this and hasn't watched the first film to rent or buy that one first.Both films are based on the idea of museums in which all the exhibits come to life at night. Where the first film was played occasionally for drama but mostly for laughs, this film is played for laughs from start to finish. It's no great work of art, but it aims to be funny and entertaining and often succeeds.As someone who liked the first film a lot, I didn't think this was quite up to the same standard, but my seven-year old twins really enjoyed it, while my wife and I coped by switching off our critical faculties, ignoring the holes in the plot, and just enjoying the humour.With the exceptions of Carla Gugino as Rebecca the receptionist, and of Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs as the outgoing night guards, almost all the star-studded cast of the first film get at least cameo roles in this one.Ben Stiller returns as the central character Larry Daley, Jake Cherry as his son Nick, and Ricky Gervais as Dr. McPhee, the Director of the New York museum of natural history.Robin Williams reprises his role as the statue of President Teddy Roosevelt, Patrick Gallagher as the statue of Attila The Hun, and Mizuo Peck as the statue of Sacajawea (the Indian guide who guided Lewis and Clark), while Rami Malek returns for a brief cameo of his role as Pharoah Ahkmenrah.Those who liked the previous film will probably be pleased to learn that, apart from Ben Stiller, the characters from that film who get the most significant parts in this one are the tiny Roman and cowboy leaders, Octavius and Jedediah, played by Steve Coogan and Owen Wilson. And this time Wilson gets the billing he should have had in the first film.New characters in this film include a very feisty statue of Amelia Earhart, played by Amy Adams, wearing a pair of form fitting trousers which will give dads a good reason to follow her scenes closely, especially when the camera angles are from behind.Also joining in the fun are Bill Hader as a statue of General George Armstrong Custer, and Hank Azaria who gets three roles: he plays the film's villain, Kahmunrah, who is the elder brother of Pharoah Akmenrah from the first film, Rodin's statue ""The Thinker,"" and President Abe Lincoln's statue from the Lincoln Memorial.Former World Heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman has a cameo role as himself.The sequel is set some two years after the original film. Larry Daley, who as an unsuccessful inventor took a job as Night Guard at the New York museum of Natural History, has finally managed to become successful and is now CEO of his own company. He occasionally returns to the museum to see his old friends. At the start of the film he comes back to find almost all of them being packed away in boxes. The board has decided to replace most of the exhibits with holographic projections and put the originals into storage in the federal archives underneath the Smithsonian Institute at Washington D.C.The gold plate of Akmenrah which causes everything in the museum to come to life at night was supposed to stay in New York: but a naughty monkey grabs it, and it is taken to Washington. Larry gets a phone call from which he realises that everything in the largest museum in the world is going to come to life. Worse, one of the exhibits in the Smithsonian is the mummy of the brother of Akmenrah, who knows what the plate can do, and is out for revenge, to conquer the world, etc ...As you would expect from a film with such a big name cast, there is some really good acting: Stiller does a good job of playing ""straight man"" to the absurd events around him, Steve Coogan and Owen Wilson are brilliant as the tiny heroes, and Hader is mostly entertainingly mad as Custer, though he is given a rather poignant serious scene towards the end of the film. Hank Azaria repeatedly cracked me up with all three of his roles, but especially by playing the Egyptian baddie with a lisping parody of an effete English aristocratic accent.But probably the best performance is by Amy Adams, who quite steals the show with the zestful way she brings to life the statue of Amelia Earhart, and would have been worth watching even without the daringly tight trousers.Quality of the humour varies enormously, some of it is pretty basic slapstick such as Ben Stiller getting slapped on the cheek by a pair of monkeys, but one or two moments and lines, which I had better not describe for fear of spoiling them, were absolute classics.Not everyone will like this film: it has taken something of a caning from the critics, and anyone who tries to take it seriously will end up picking it to pieces. However, most children aged between about six and twelve will probably love it, especially if they liked the previous film. Adults who can suspend disbelief, forget how ridiculous the whole thing is, and just enjoy the ride, should also be able to get some pleasure from it. I will buy the DVD for my children when it comes out.",4,Entertaining sequel as the Exhibits are moved to the Smithsonian,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,5443,"['review', 'based', 'having', 'been',

1229231,AG42CYU5P8NVQ,B001PR0Y4O,Mathew A. Shember,"[2, 6]","Larry Daley left the museum to start a company which sells gadgets in infomercials.  I did notice his inventions came from his time as a security guard.  A glowing flashlight, a key chain you can never loose, and the big dog toy.  He is about to get a major deal from Walmart when he gets a call from Jeddediah who tells him they are packing up the museum.  Larry visits but is too engrossed in his new business (i.e. constant cell phone and messaging) to get concerned about the denizens going into storage.Later on he gets a panicked call from Jeddediah who tells him the Capuchin stole the tablet and now Kahmunrah brother of Ahkmenrah wants the tablet.Larry sneaks into the museum and finds Kahmunrah has enlisted Napoleon, Ivan the Terrible and Al Capone to assist his takeover of the museum and then the world.What's Larry to do?I was not expecting much from this movie as the advertising hinted to me that many of the gags of the first film would return.  I was going to wait for the rental but my daughter announced she wanted to see it.My low expectations became a reality.  Most of the humor was not crafted well. You will see it panders to children.  My daughter loved the film but for me it just dragged on at times.  Enough for me to confess I found myself dozing a couple times.Things that I didn't like:  Larry getting slapped was a theme this time.  After all why get slapped by one monkey when you can have a three stooges routine with two.  Some of the gag routines just went on too long.  The scene with the other security guard in particular.  The tablet needed a translation and for some reason they couldn't find another Egyptian to do it.  The Smithsonian is almost a fortress.  The way Larry get's in would be practically impossible.  Nineteen buildings and no other guards are seen.  General Custer was supposed to be funny but I found him annoying.  Ivan, Napoleon, and Al could have been much better.  Did I mention some gags were too long?Things I liked: The background shots with the museum stuff coming to life were good!  I especially liked what they did with the art and photos.  Amy Adams did a great job as Amelia Earhart.  Hank Azaria was great as the lisping Kahmunrah.  The Horis guards were good but one scene pandered to children.  I liked the action at the Air Space Museum.Don't get me wrong.  It's not a horrible film.  There are a couple funny spots and there were good ideas in the film but why let that get in the way of pandering to children.I would give the film one star but I will have to give it two since my daughter liked the film.",2,Don't have high expectations.,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,2583,"['Larry', 'Daley', 'left', 'museum', 'start', 'company', 'gadgets', 'infomercials', 'did', 'notice', 'inventions', 'came', 'time', 'security', 'guard', 'glowing', 'flashlight', 'key', 'chain', 'can', 'never', 'loose', 'big', 'dog', 'toy', 'get', 'major', 'deal', 'Walmart', 'when', 'call', 'Jeddediah', 'who', 'are', 'packing', 'up', 'museum', 'Larry', 'visits', 'too', 'engrossed', 'new', 'business', 'i.e', 'constant', 'cell', 'phone', 'messaging', 'get', 'concerned', 'denizens', 'going', 'storage.Later', 'panicked', 'call', 'Jeddediah', 'who', 'Capuchin', 'stole', 'tablet', 'now', 'Kahmunrah', 'brother', 'Ahkmenrah', 'tablet.Larry', 'museum', 'Kahmunrah', 'enlisted', 'Napoleon', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'Al', 'Capone', 'assist', 'takeover', 'museum', 'then', 'world.What', 'Larry', 'do', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'advertising', 'hinted', 'many', 'gags', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'return', 'was', 'going', 'wait', 'rental', 'daughter', 'announced', 'wanted', 'see', 'it.My', 'low', 'expectations', 'became', 'reality', 'Most', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'crafted', 'well', 'will', 'see', 'children', 'daughter', 'loved', 'film', 'just', 'dragged', 'times', 'Enough', 'confess', 'found', 'dozing', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'Larry', 'getting', 'slapped', 'was', 'theme', 'time', 'why', 'get', 'slapped', 'one', 'monkey', 'when', 'can', 'have', 'three', 'stooges', 'routine', 'two', 'gag', 'routines', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'scene', 'other', 'security', 'guard', 'particular', 'tablet', 'needed', 'translation', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'Egyptian', 'do', 'Smithsonian', 'almost', 'fortress', 'way', 'Larry', 'get', 'would', 'be', 'practically', 'impossible', 'Nineteen', 'buildings', 'other', 'guards', 'are', 'seen', 'General', 'Custer', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'found', 'annoying', 'Ivan', 'Napoleon', 'Al', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Did', 'mention', 'gags', 'were', 'too', 'long', 'Things', 'liked', 'background', 'shots', 'museum', 'stuff', 'coming', 'life', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'liked', 'what', 'did', 'art', 'photos', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'was', 'great', 'lisping', 'Kahmunrah', 'Horis', 'guards', 'were', 'good', 'one', 'scene', 'pandered', 'children', 'liked', 'action', 'Air', 'Space', 'Museum.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'funny', 'spots', 'were', 'good', 'ideas', 'film', 'why', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'pandering', 'children.I', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'two', 'daughter', 'liked', 'film']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

Probably at least every five minutes I found myself laughing out loud to the antics by all the wonderful characters on the screen.Since we last left him, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) has become a well known inventor and has quit his job as night guard at the museum.  However, he finds himself visiting his old friends and misses them despite his fame and fortune.  He hasn't visited in a few months when he does and finds that all his favorite characters are being shipped to a storage beneath the Smithsonian museum.  Things should be ok, but that one sneaky monkey steals the magical tablet and brings the Smithsonian to life.Pharoah Kamunrah (Hank Azaria) wants the tablet for his own.  He is jealous it was given to his little brother and enlists the help of several notorious figures in history to help him get it from Larry who has come to help his friends.  He must find a way to save the other museum fixtures and rescue the golden tablet before it is too late.  Along to help him is pretty Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) who wants one last adventure.I think the choice of characters for this movie was done well.  I'm really not a big fan of Amy Adams, but since her character is so outrageous in this film anyway, it didn't really make a difference to me.  Ben Stiller was as funny as ever and I especially enjoyed Hank Azaria's role as the Pharaoh as well.  The rest of the cast returned as the same characters and it was nice to see that they were able to keep that consistency.  Amy Adams as Amelia manages to make quite  a pest of herself and yet still help Larry at the same time as they run around searching for answers.  She also develops a romantic interest in him which was pretty funny to see as he is real and she is well, not.While there wasn't a very exciting plot to this movie (lets face it, it takes place in one night and involves museum characters coming to life) it was a very adorable and funny movie.  I think for movies like this plot can take a back seat to the acting and just the general goofiness and fun the movie creates.  It provides a great outlet for not being very serious.  My one complaint was that the movie seemed awfully fast paced.  There was not a lot of time to slow down and get a sense of everything that was happening.The humor in this movie varied.  There was a lot of slap stick (the monkeys and their penchant for slapping), some parody (boy group singing stone angels anyone?), and just numerous instances where history was used to make fun of something or provide a base for a joke as they were now thrust into the regular modern world.  As noted before I was laughing out loud at least every five minutes and laughing internally throughout most of the movie.  I'm happy to say there were no groan moments either like when someone makes a really bad pun.I can't say much about the music in the movie.  I didn't really pay attention and it wasn't anything special to make me take notice.  The special effects on the other hand were outstanding.  I especially love how Larry and Amelia interacted with the paintings and some of the notable artwork coming to life.

1229252,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B001PR0Y4O,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[9, 12]","Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is no longer an out-of-work loser who needs to step up to the plate. This time around he's a highly successful CEO and workaholic who needs to slow down and focus on what really matters. That means he's got to accept that his true calling is not to invent new and mostly useless gadgets (like a glowing flashlight and a super-sized doggie bone) but to be an ordinary night guard in a far from ordinary museum.One thing that was even more evident in this film was that the basic strategy in bringing to life the various historical characters was to create someone who was recognizably similar to the original but somehow insecure or silly. A giant Abe Lincoln was easily the best looking new character in terms of special effects, but his mannerisms and personality were just silly and shallow; unlike with most of the major characters of the original the writers seemed to be making very little effort to draw upon some ""historical essence"" in the outline of the new folks. Hank Azaria nearly managed to add something with his odd but interesting turn as an incompetent evil Egyptian with a British accent and a lisp, but the real exception and the one element that felt truly fresh in this film was, of course, Amy Adams' characterization of Amelia Earhart. She brought a vitality and spontaneity to the role that was convincing and engaging, and she easily stole every scene she was in. The only unconvincing aspect of her performance was the fault of the writers: her strange romantic attraction for Ben Stiller's character, who only accomplished anything through luck (and a very small amount of pluck) and a cartoonish conviction that he could always manage things because none of it really mattered and things would all turn out right in the end. Her interest in Larry Daley is even more peculiar when it turns out her passion was really just the writer's vehicle for teaching him a valuable life's lesson (something about ""seizing the day"" and doing whatever makes you happy no matter what it will all amount to in the end).All the old characters are back, but there's a host of new ones drawn from the Smithsonian, where his old friends are shipped and he is called upon to save the day. As far as I can tell, all of the old characters, including Stiller, are ""slumming"" this time around. Rather than giving original and interesting performances, they seem like they are just trying to do enough to make it apparent they are the same folks the audience has come to love from last time. Owen Wilson, especially, looks like he hardly cares what's happening. The first film's chemistry between his cowboy and Steve Coogan's centurion has all but disappeared and for the most part Wilson seems resigned just to bury his head in the sand and wait until the movie's over. Sure there are a few new characters and situations, but most of them just seem bigger, not really better. The best moments this time around, and the ones my children enjoyed most, were basically variations on the best moments in the first film: this time Stiller is in a slap-fest with TWO rare monkeys!If you like silly cartoons - and who doesn't every now and then? - this one's not bad and not boring and holds a few minor surprises. Very young children won't be able to tell the difference between this and a truly original blockbuster summer family entertainment film. Well worth watching if you've got nothing better to do for a couple of hours.",3,"Entertaining and amusing, but doesn't feel as fresh as the first one",1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,3451,"['Larry', 'Daley', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'no', 'longer', 'out-of-work', 'loser', 'who', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'time', 'highly', 'successful', 'CEO', 'workaholic', 'who', 'slow', 'down', 'focus', 'really', 'matters', 'got', 'accept', 'true', 'calling', 'not', 'invent', 'new', 'mostly', 'useless', 'gadgets', 'glowing', 'flashlight', 'super-sized', 'doggie', 'bone', 'be', 'ordinary', 'night', 'guard', 'far', 'ordinary', 'museum.One', 'thing', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'evident', 'film', 'was', 'basic', 'strategy', 'bringing', 'life', 'various', 'historical', 'characters', 'was', 'create', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'recognizably', 'similar', 'original', 'somehow', 'insecure', 'silly', 'giant', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'looking', 'new', 'character', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'mannerisms', 'personality', 'were', 'just', 'silly', 'shallow', 'most', 'major', 'characters', 'original', 'writers', 'seemed', 'be', 'making', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'draw', 'historical', 'essence', 'outline', 'new', 'folks', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'nearly', 'managed', 'add', 'something', 'odd', 'interesting', 'turn', 'incompetent', 'evil', 'Egyptian', 'British', 'accent', 'lisp', 'real', 'exception', 'one', 'element', 'felt', 'truly', 'fresh', 'film', 'was', 'course', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'characterization', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'brought', 'vitality', 'spontaneity', 'role', 'was', 'convincing', 'engaging', 'easily', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'unconvincing', 'aspect', 'performance', 'was', 'fault', 'writers', 'strange', 'romantic', 'attraction', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'accomplished', 'anything', 'luck', 'very', 'small', 'amount', 'pluck', 'cartoonish', 'conviction', 'could', 'always', 'manage', 'things', 'none', 'really', 'mattered', 'things', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'end', 'interest', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'even', 'more', 'peculiar', 'when', 'out', 'passion', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'writer', 'vehicle', 'teaching', 'valuable', 'life', 'lesson', 'something', 'seizing', 'day', 'doing', 'happy', 'matter', 'what', 'will', 'amount', 'end', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'host', 'new', 'ones', 'drawn', 'Smithsonian', 'where', 'old', 'friends', 'are', 'shipped', 'called', 'save', 'day', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'old', 'characters', 'including', 'Stiller', 'are', 'slumming', 'time', 'around', 'Rather', 'giving', 'original', 'interesting', 'performances', 'seem', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'enough', 'make', 'apparent', 'are', 'same', 'audience', 'come', 'love', 'last', 'time', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'especially', 'hardly', 'what', 'happening', 'first', 'film', 'chemistry', 'cowboy', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'centurion', 'disappeared', 'most', 'part', 'Wilson', 'resigned', 'just', 'bury', 'head', 'sand', 'wait', 'movie', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'situations', 'most', 'just', 'seem', 'bigger', 'not', 'really', 'better', 'best', 'moments', 'time', 'ones', 'children', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'were', 'basically', 'variations', 'best', 'moments', 'first', 'film', 'time', 'Stiller', 'slap-fest', 'TWO', 'rare', 'monkeys', 'like', 'silly', 'cartoons', 'who', ""n't"", 'now', 'then', 'one', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'boring', 'few', 'minor', 'surprises', 'Very', 'young', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'difference', 'truly', 'original', 'blockbuster', 'summer', 'family', 'entertainment', 'film', 'Well', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'couple', 'hours']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

Doyle ""film buff""","[2, 3]","Before the credits are even over, one gets the impression that all of the sight gags from the original NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM are going to be transferred to The Smithsonian from The Museum of Natural History when the move is made, but fortunately, that's not true. There are some very clever touches to this sequel and the storyline varies considerably.The touches include such historical figures as Al Capone (only seen in B&W; although surrounded by color), Ivan the Terrible (nicely played by Christopher Guest), Amelia Earhart (crisply played for comic effect by Amy Adams but certainly not anyone's idea of the famous aviatrix), and George Armstrong Custer. All get the laughs intended, including Darth Vader who may or may not be historical but is certainly well known to fans of this sort of spoof.And last, but not least, is the astonishing job done to allow Abraham Lincoln to walk about freely after getting up from the Lincoln Memorial and interacting with others for the grand finale, still keeping his sculptured appearance intact, again thanks to Hank Azaria.The most imaginative sequence of all has the famous B&W; photo of a sailor kissing a girl in Times Square on VJ day, magically entered by our hero and his companion (Earhart) so that they become part of the celebrating crowd in that B&W; sequence. When Ben Stiller leaves behind his mobile phone the sailor retrieves it, wondering what it can possibly be. Clever bit.But mostly, it's a sketchy sort of plot that has all of the familiar goings on in the original film repeated in different ways by many of the original characters. And again, the zany antics all revolve around getting hold of that tablet. However, among the newer creations, Hank Azaria does a commendable job of bringing his ancient Pharoah to life. He's a man who wants to bring to life an ""Army of the Dead"" so that he can use the powerful tablet for his own selfish means. Azaria makes the right decision to play the character in Boris Karloff's voice, even down to the Karloff lisp. He's a standout in the supporting cast.Kids should love it. Once again, no expense has been spared to bring the Smithsonian and the other museum to life and this time there's a nice twist to the story with the Earhart character endearing herself to Stiller in time to give the ending a romantic feeling. One of the disappointing aspects--Ricky Gervais doesn't get to be as comically effective as he was in the first film. And let's face it--Amy Adams is badly miscast as Amelia Earhart.In many ways, not quite up to the original, but still provides a good measure of entertainment although there are times when almost too much seems to be going on.",4,A good measure of colorful entertainment not quite up to the original...,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,2672,"['credits', 'are', 'even', 'one', 'impression', 'sight', 'gags', 'original', 'NIGHT', 'AT', 'THE', 'MUSEUM', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'transferred', 'Smithsonian', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'when', 'move', 'made', 'fortunately', 'not', 'true', 'are', 'very', 'clever', 'touches', 'sequel', 'storyline', 'considerably.The', 'touches', 'include', 'such', 'historical', 'figures', 'Al', 'Capone', 'only', 'seen', 'B', 'W', 'surrounded', 'color', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'nicely', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'crisply', 'played', 'comic', 'effect', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'certainly', 'not', 'anyone', 'idea', 'famous', 'aviatrix', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'get', 'laughs', 'intended', 'including', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'historical', 'certainly', 'well', 'known', 'fans', 'sort', 'spoof.And', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'astonishing', 'job', 'done', 'allow', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'walk', 'freely', 'getting', 'up', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'interacting', 'others', 'grand', 'finale', 'still', 'keeping', 'sculptured', 'appearance', 'intact', 'again', 'thanks', 'Hank', 'Azaria.The', 'most', 'imaginative', 'sequence', 'famous', 'B', 'W', 'photo', 'sailor', 'kissing', 'girl', 'Times', 'Square', 'VJ', 'day', 'magically', 'entered', 'hero', 'companion', 'Earhart', 'so', 'become', 'part', 'celebrating', 'crowd', 'B', 'W', 'sequence', 'When', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'mobile', 'phone', 'sailor', 'wondering', 'what', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'Clever', 'bit.But', 'mostly', 'sketchy', 'sort', 'plot', 'familiar', 'goings', 'original', 'film', 'repeated', 'different', 'ways', 'many', 'original', 'characters', 'again', 'zany', 'antics', 'revolve', 'getting', 'hold', 'tablet', 'However', 'newer', 'creations', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'commendable', 'job', 'bringing', 'ancient', 'Pharoah', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'bring', 'life', 'Army', 'Dead', 'so', 'can', 'use', 'powerful', 'tablet', 'own', 'selfish', 'means', 'Azaria', 'right', 'decision', 'play', 'character', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'voice', 'even', 'down', 'Karloff', 'lisp', 'standout', 'supporting', 'cast.Kids', 'should', 'love', 'Once', 'again', 'expense', 'been', 'spared', 'bring', 'Smithsonian', 'other', 'museum', 'life', 'time', 'nice', 'twist', 'story', 'Earhart', 'character', 'endearing', 'Stiller', 'time', 'give', 'ending', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'One', 'disappointing', 'aspects', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', ""n't"", 'get', 'be', 'comically', 'effective', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'let', 'face', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'badly', 'miscast', 'Amelia', 'Earhart.In', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'quite', 'original', 'still', 'good', 'measure', 'entertainment', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'going']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

Well, since he can't no longer be remembered as a good guy, and we can't just quite put an American in uniform among the bad guys, let's just say that ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" is his last stand to make amends and do good in the end.Sounds stupid? It is. Unfortunately, that's the criteria behind the movie. To each character a label: spunky Amelia Earhart is a good gal because she was a woman who flew planes. The Tuskegee airmen are good guys because they were black (and flew planes). Einstein was smart, so he must know how to decipher an Egyptian riddle. Lincoln is a good guy because he has a big statue. Ivan the Terrible? bad guy, of course -why waste such a nickname! Napoleon must be ""despicable"" too, since he was a warmongering imperialist little runt. Actually, the same can be said of Teddy Roosevelt, only he belongs with the good guys. Why? Because!Yeah; I know. No harm done; mere brain candy entertainment. Yet, these movies are made to promote the museums depicted; for kids to flock to them and learn a thing or two. Why learn at all, mind you, if all you need to know you can pick up watching predictable movies made by guys contented with politically-correct platitudes, prejudice, urban legends, stereotypes ...along with their hard-earned fat Hollywood contracts? Hey! You liked Ben Stiller being slapped by a monkey in the first movie? Here he's slapped by TWO monkeys! Enjoy!***************************************************P.S.: What Abraham Lincoln meant with ""A house divided against itself cannot stand"" (a quotation from Christ, by the way), was not ""Divide And Conquer"" but ""Divided We Fall""; a rather different notion. Alas, that didn't deter the screenwriter.

Some things were as good as the predecessor, some were better, and some were worse.Many of the cast return, though some, like Robin Williams and Brad Garrett, insultingly get less screen time here.  Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs are nowhere to be seen, which is disappointing as I would have at least liked a cameo of these guys.  The previous love interest, played by Carla Gugino, is also gone.  In her place is Amy Adams, playing the brought-to-life version of Amelia Earhart.  While I am a certified life-long fan of Amy Adams and therefore have absolutely no problem with her appearance in this film, I would still like to know what happened to the girl from the last film...this isn't a James Bond thing...Ben Stiller couldn't pull that off.But Amy Adams isn't the only positive addition to the cast.  Also coming onto the screen is Bill Hader, turning out a very memorable and highly enjoyable performance as General George Armstrong Custer.  Our villain this time around is Hank Azaria, playing Kahmunrah, the evil mummified brother of Akhmenrah, the mummy from the first film.  He plots to summon an army from the underworld to conquer our world with the aide of the tablet, which is now a numbered dial pad as opposed to the sliding puzzle it was last time (Boo!)  How did this power of the tablet never come up before?  Why was the tablet's format changed?The cast was again quite good, even if some got short-changed on screen time.  I don't understand why the statue of Abraham Lincoln from the Lincoln Memorial needed to be in this as I saw no valid point to it.  I'm sure others already established in the film could have pulled off what he did.  It was just too out there for me.So this film's got its ups and downs.  Unfortunately, its downs slightly overshadow the ups and cost it that fifth star.  I will say that I liked this film's ending better though.  The first film's closing scenes were good, but I just liked these more...I'm fairly certain my obsessive fan worship has something to do with that.  As far as sequels go, this one's solid and worth watching if you liked the first one.

Kyle,"[0, 1]","In two years, Larry Daley (Stiller) has gone from a night guard at the Museum of Natural History to a wealthy inventor who's selling his products on informercials. He's about to make the deal of his life with Wal-Mart when his cell phone rings and it's Jedediah (Owen Wilson) calling to ask Larry's help.  It seems they're tearing down the museum exhibits and separating a crew who came to get along very well in their night-time adventures.  The Egyptian tablet which gave life to the exhibits will stay at the Museum of Natural History and this will be the last night for them to be together unless Larry can help.Larry vows to do what he can, but to no avail.  He discovers the tablet has gone to the Smithsonian thanks to a light-fingered capuchin monkey.  Imagine, the largest network of museums in the world with everything from prehistoric to aerospace exhibits and all of it coming to life at night.And that's just what happens.  Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) is a lisping Egyptian prince set on taking over the world with the use of the tablet's magic.  He enlists a trio of baddies as his lieutenants including Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon and Al Capone to help him.Thus, the comic battle is joined.  This is a battle only fans of slapstick and very young children can enjoy. We are talking a lot of slapping and hamming here.  But, the kids in the audience from 6-10 really did love the film and many of the adults got several good belly laughs out of the general silliness.

1229280,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001PR0Y4O,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","It's hard for me to grasp that the actors/comics who play Reno Sheriff's Department members Dangle & Junior are the same guys who wrote the 2 NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM movies. It's like telling me that Lenny Bruce wrote BAMBI. RENO is foul-mouthed, fast-paced, improv-heavy and most certainly not kid friendly. The MUSEUM movies are noisy but never untidy, by-the-numbers and family friendly.But that strangeness aside, it's also amazing to me that so much technical wizardry, hard work & exciting casting can produce so little in the way of actual entertainment. I remember the first film's premise sounded SO promising: a museum where at night everything comes to life. WOW! And there were many visual treats, such as the dinosaur skeleton trying to drink from the water fountain. But the story just amounted to nothing, and the human actors tried SO hard to be charming and witty (probably while acting in a room containing nothing but a green-screen), and mostly failed miserably. It was a big disappointment.I was not surprised to see the announcement of a sequel, but I was a bit saddened as well. Unless the approach to the movie were to differ radically, it would surely just be another big, loud waste of money. Yet with all these reservations in the back of my mind, I still went to the movie on a slow night where I was itching to get out of the house. And for the most part, the things that worked well in the first film were even better here. And sadly, the things that didn't work before were almost painfully worse.NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN reintroduces us to Ben Stiller, the hapless night watchman from the first film. He's now a successful entrepreneur and infomercial spokesperson...but he's lost touch with the ""guys"" at the museum where he once worked. He finds out that most of them are being put into storage at the Smithsonian, and this will also leave the ancient Egyptian stone that raised all these creatures in the first place in the hands of an evil Egyptian pharaoh. So feeling guilty, Stiller goes to Washington...intent on breaking into the Smithsonian and stopping the carnage.All of this is an excuse, of course, for many incongruous historical figures, creatures and artifacts to be brought to life, interact & fight, and for all to be set right with the world. And as in the prior movie, the individual little vignettes are frequently delightful. The vision of the Smithsonian's Air & Space Museum coming to life with pilots, astronauts, etc...all intent on restarting their flying machines, is delightfully executed. A gathering of Albert Einstein bobbleheads come to life...again, a neat idea convincingly executed. I REALLY enjoyed all the famous artwork that comes to life, but remains confined its frames. It's like the artwork on the walls of Hogwarts in the HARRY POTTER movies, but we recognize the famous paintings, so it's especially fun to see them behave. Rodin's The Thinker comes to life...but he mostly just thinks and never actually comes up with anything to say...I found this to be a rare moment of true wit.Yet all these elements never coalesce into a story we care about. The Egyptian Pharoah (Hank Azaria) comes to life, and begins to assemble a hodge-podge of historical bad guys to help him, such a Darth Vadar, Al Capone (seen only in black & white, because that's what his cut-out figure was) and Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest). His ""evil machinations"" don't feel the least bit threatening. The entire tone of the movie lets you know almost from the first moment that nothing truly bad will happen to any character we care about...so we don't really for a second think any one is in danger. This has the effect of making all the effort and skill feel like sound and fury signifying nothing.And again, many of the performances are bad. Robin Williams does his squinty-eyed ""thing"" again as Teddy Roosevelt, and he's unbearably cloying. Luke Wilson is 100% not funny for even the barest millisecond as a diminutive cowboy, and sadly, the wonderful Steve Coogan as the equally small emperor Octavius is nearly as ineffectual. And he has a scene in which he rides a poorly rendered CGI squirrel. Christopher Guest finds nothing to amuse in his Ivan the Terrible. Jonah Hill shows up in one scene as a security guard, and he and Stiller have a seriously tone-deaf scene in which they both behave like characters a 2nd grader might write. Speaking of star Ben Stiller, he looks bored to be in the film. Again, he probably spent a huge chunk of it reacting and talking to a big green screen...but actors can do that convincingly...he just didn't seem to care enough to try. Stiller has looked bored in a lot of his movies lately...it's a shame to see that.Let me try to wrap up on a more positive note. Hank Azaria works very hard to be amusing as the evil Pharoah, putting on a fey, Boris Karloff impersonation that is occasionally quite amusing. He's forced to simply stand around and say things in that voice just a bit too much, but that is not his fault, but the script's. Azaria is one of those actors who always makes interesting choices. Best of all is Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart. I have yet to see Adams give a poor performance...in fact, her work is so very winning and charming (see JUNEBUG, DOUBT, SUNSHINE CLEANING, ENCHANTED, MISS PETTIGREW...,etc.). Her Earhart character in a better movie could have been a classic. As it is, she's like a little Katherine Hepburn a la BRINGING UP BABY...game to try anything and probably smarter than anyone around her.In summary, the movie has many things to admire and many things to be dismayed at. When I put it all together, the film comes out to 3 stars, but I put it barely into my ""not recommended"" list. Having said that, if you DO see it, enjoy the CGI successes and Amy Adams. You may find your NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM was not a total waste.",3,"Great technical wizardry, but not much of a story",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,5877,"['hard', 'grasp', 'actors/comics', 'who',

1229282,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B001PR0Y4O,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Night at the Museum:Battle of the Smithsonian(released May/09)stars Ben Stiller as Larry Daley,Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart,Tess Owen Wilson as Jedediah,Hank Azaria as Kahmunrah,Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt and many others.This second entry is by far the weakest of the two films of this franchise so far.The film/story is really padded and edited poorly.The story finds Stiller,now a successful businessman and having marketed for great profits his inventions.He has had little or no time for visiting his old job at the museum.With an upcoming possible deal with Wal-Mart,he decides to take a stroll down memory lane and go back to the museum on some down time.It seems many of the exhibits now are being shipped to the Smithsonian in Washington,DC,for storage,as the exhibits now will be interactive instead of passive.Later that day Stiller receives a frantic call from one of the exhibits saying that the brother of the pharaoh in the Natural History Musuem,has come alive in storage in Washington,and wants to take over the world.Stiller rushes to Washington and infiltrates the storage areas down below the main halls.There he confronts brother Pharaoh who holds one of the exhibits captive,while Stiller and his new companion Amelia Earhart,must find the clue that unlocks the gold tablet.Stiller and Earhart travel through most of the exhibits and finally come upon bobble head Einsteins who tell him the answer.Brother Pharaoh has enlisted the help of Al Capone and Ivan the Terrible for his conquering plans.Stiller returns to the Pharaoh,and while the two argue over who gives  in first,Capone and his posse arrive with the answer themselves.The gate is opened and in walk minions from the Egyptian underworld.In the nick of time Lincoln(of the Lincoln statue)comes in and sends them packing.The Pharaoh and Stiller have a brief battle and while Earhart opens the gate door,Stiller pushes him through it and to oblivion.The captive exhibit is freed,who explains that it really wasn't them who needed Stiller,but the other way around.The film ends as the musueum has reopened due to a generous donation from an anonymous donour and an Earhart look alike comes strolling into the museum and Stiller and she strike up a convo.There are so many fillers in this film.The ending is terribly slow,as there is a long drawn out convo between Stiller and the curator and Stiller and the Earhart look a like.What the impetus was for Stiller ever going back to the museum in the first place is not clear to me,as he was in the midst of a big business deal,with plans high on his priority list.There is a recreation of the slapping monkey scene,and this time its with Dexter and Able,a like monkey who went into space.Both have their go at Stiller at the same time.But it is not funny this time around.There is also this side romantic plot of Stiller with Earhart,which really falls flat in the end.I also must say that just because one happens to have parents that are comedians,doesn't mean that that talent is naturally passed on to that off spring.If that was the case the children of such REAL comedy greats like Chaplin,Laurel,Keaton,Lloyd,et al would have had brilliant offspring as well.Stiller shows he still has a LONG way to go to develop his comedic skills and improve his range of emotion,when trying to truly emote and act.A true comedian,such as those mentioned,could play the most serious of dramatic roles as well as play the ""fool"".Stiller has strung along on his parents coat tails for far too long and needs to step up and own it or get the heck off the stage.Stiller has been good in roles more suited to his limited abilities like Mystery Men and Zoolander,but those kind of roles do not happen on a consistent enough basis.And for gosh sakes,could not the producers have at least got other actors who at least looked NEAR to the real Earhart and Al Capone?

The inclusion of Amy Adams in the cast adds a real spark, but all of the cast members are just great. There are obviously a lot of historical references in the movie which provide openings to discuss the real characters and events with your children so there's some educational value as well. It's also terrific to see all of the displays in the Smithsonian in such an animated setting, especially Air and Space which looks even better than I remember it. Having said all that, the best things about the movie are the clever dialogue and characterizations (including Hank Azaria as a reincarnated Egyptian pharoah who channels Boris Karloff). There's an unforgettable encounter between the Ben Stiller character and an overeager security guard at the Smithsonian that is absolutely hilarious, but that's just one of many such scenes in the movie.

Does the sequel measure up? Ehhhh mostly. For the most part this is a cookie-cutter sequel (the same principals applied on a larger scale, in this case America's largest museum). All of the original characters are back but for the most part they see little action (aside from Jedidiah and Octavius, both are hilarious and the 300ish battle sequence is side-splitting). Hank and Amy hit their parts perfectly (the lisping evil Pharaoh is a perfect villain) and Stiller brings back Larry Daley exactly as we remember him.Are there some drawbacks? Sure! For one because of the scale of this movie's setting so many characters are introduced while so few get any real development (much like the X-men films btw). This leads to a lot of activity on the screen without much really getting done. A whole lot of questions go compeltely unanswered (what ever happened to Stiller's original love interest? The Kitty Hawk flew for like 12 seconds, not across DC,lol), and Larry's son plays an unnecessarily small role.Still the best part of this movie in my opinion was that the majority of the humor was found in the dialogue and not in stupid slap-stick antics. You can clearly tell that while the writers made this movie for families they didn't want to leave the adults out.Overall this film was a whole lot of fun that finds its place as a respectable sequel.

Though it's written by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon of Reno 911 fame, don't expect such creatively crude humor, or for that matter, any laughs even remotely geared towards adults. It may inevitably make an obscene amount of the green stuff at the box office, but we're hoping for a long break before part three.Shortly after his phenomenal adventures in the Museum of Natural History, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is again called back into action to protect his re-animated exhibits from a brand new evil. When he receives a distress call from Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson), Larry infiltrates the Smithsonian to discover Egyptian pharaoh Kahmunrah's (Hank Azaria) plans to use the magical tablet to summon forth his army of the undead. With time quickly running out, the former museum night guard must rally together his old friends - and a few new ones, including Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) and General Custer (Bill Hader) - to stop the ancient menace.Without knowledge of the first film, Battle of the Smithsonian might leave viewers slightly bewildered. Fortunately, the reasoning behind bringing notorious historical characters to life in a family-friendly bloodless battle of wills doesn't need much explaining. What does need clarification is why a sequel was necessary. The entire show appears as little more than an excuse to pack tons of cameo roles into a pointless rehash. A centuries-old Egyptian pharaoh (with a lisp) wishes to unlock the gates to the underworld to unleash an army of the dead? It's a despairingly tired scenario that fails to parody as much as it flounders in its own lack of creativity. Even as an excuse to toss jokes into a cartoonish world, it only half succeeds.Since all of the humor falls flat, the dialogue is smothered with sarcasm, mocking the film's own inadequacies as an attempt to recoup laughs lost to extremely juvenile hoopla. Unfortunately the entire approach of the film is cheesy. Just when it couldn't possibly get any sillier, someone comes up with something positively ridiculous to do or say. It's a good thing Capone never bothers to use his machinegun, spears and swords never strike their targets, and no real peril ever finds its way into the numerous melees. It's like two very young kids arguing with one another for 105 minutes. The icing on the cake is a slap-fight between two capuchins and Stiller during the midst of the climactic final battle sequence - for no plot reason whatsoever, simply to make use of the payroll monkeys.- The Massie Twins",2,Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian Review from The Massie Twins,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2778,"['handful', 'clever', 'historical', 'references', 'thundering', 'action', 'score', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'list', 'cameos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mask', 'what', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian', 'truly', 'really', 'really', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'written', 'Robert', 'Ben', 'Garant', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'Reno', '911', 'fame', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'such', 'creatively', 'crude', 'humor', 'matter', 'laughs', 'even', 'remotely', 'geared', 'towards', 'adults', 'may', 'inevitably', 'make', 'obscene', 'amount', 'green', 'stuff', 'box', 'office', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'long', 'break', 'part', 'three.Shortly', 'phenomenal', 'adventures', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'again', 'called', 'back', 'action', 'protect', 're-animated', 'exhibits', 'brand', 'new', 'evil', 'When', 'distress', 'call', 'Jedediah', 'Smith', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Larry', 'Smithsonian', 'discover', 'Egyptian', 'pharaoh', 'Kahmunrah', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'use', 'magical', 'tablet', 'summon', 'forth', 'army', 'undead', 'time', 'quickly', 'running', 'out', 'former', 'museum', 'night', 'guard', 'must', 'rally', 'together', 'old', 'friends', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'including', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'General', 'Custer', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'stop', 'ancient', 'menace.Without', 'knowledge', 'first', 'film', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian', 'might', 'leave', 'viewers', 'slightly', 'bewildered', 'Fortunately', 'reasoning', 'bringing', 'notorious', 'historical', 'characters', 'life', 'family-friendly', 'bloodless', 'battle', 'wills', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'explaining', 'What', 'clarification', 'why', 'sequel', 'was', 'necessary', 'entire', 'show', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'excuse', 'pack', 'tons', 'cameo', 'roles', 'pointless', 'rehash', 'centuries-old', 'Egyptian', 'pharaoh', 'lisp', 'unlock', 'gates', 'underworld', 'unleash', 'army', 'dead', 'despairingly', 'tired', 'scenario', 'parody', 'as', 'much', 'own', 'lack', 'creativity', 'Even', 'excuse', 'toss', 'jokes', 'cartoonish', 'world', 'only', 'half', 'succeeds.Since', 'humor', 'flat', 'dialogue', 'smothered', 'sarcasm', 'mocking', 'film', 'own', 'inadequacies', 'attempt', 'recoup', 'lost', 'extremely', 'juvenile', 'hoopla', 'Unfortunately', 'entire', 'approach', 'film', 'cheesy', 'Just', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'get', 'sillier', 'someone', 'up', 'something', 'positively', 'ridiculous', 'do', 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'Capone', 'never', 'bothers', 'use', 'machinegun', 'spears', 'swords', 'never', 'strike', 'targets', 'real', 'peril', 'ever', 'way', 'numerous', 'melees', 'two', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'arguing', 'one', '105', 'minutes', 'icing', 'cake', 'slap-fight', 'two', 'capuchins', 'Stiller', 'midst', 'climactic', 'final', 'battle', 'sequence', 'plot', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'simply', 'make', 'use', 'payroll', 'monkeys.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

1229306,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001PR0Y4O,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 9]","""Night at the Museum - Battle for the Smithsonian"" is an example of 'sequel-it is'. Because the first film was a hit, the filmmakers have now made a sequel where everything is simply amped up. Unfortunately, this sort of takes away from what made the first film so unexpectedly good; ""Night at the Museum"" was kind of magical. As an adult, we could imagine wandering through an old Natural History museum and meeting all of the characters as they come to life. For the sequel, the Museum is bigger, there are more characters running around and everything is louder and faster. But definitely not better.Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) now owns a successful mail-order company, the type with products advertised in infomercials featuring George Forman. His most successful product? A large flashlight. Even though Larry is now a millionaire, he still visits the Museum of Natural History, reluctant to let his friends go. When he visits one night, he finds all of the exhibits being boxed in preparation for shipping to their new home, to make way for new holographic exhibits. Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) almost proudly announces that all of the dusty exhibits are being shipped off to the Federal Archives below the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. That night, as Larry is visiting with his son, he gets a call from Jedediah (Owen Wilson). The monkey grabbed the Egyptian Tablet and now the entire Smithsonian is running amok and Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria), an Egyptian King, is trying to get the tablet to open an Egyptian Gate to the Underworld. Larry speeds down to DC and quickly outwits a Smithsonian guard (Jonah Hill) gaining access to the archives. When the exhibits wake up, Kahmunrah recruits Napoleon and Al Capone, and their respective armies, to retrieve the tablet for him. Larry meets Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) and General Custer (Bill Hader) who help him battle the evil King.Directed by Shawn Levy (""Night at the Museum"", ""The Pink Panther"", ""Cheaper By The Dozen"") and co-written by Robert Ben Garant (""Reno 911!"" ""Balls of Fury"", ""Night at the Museum"") and Thomas Lenon (""Reno 911!"" ""Balls of Fury""), ""Night at the Museum 2"" is a case of a kid running wild in the candy store. The filmmakers were given more money (because it is a sequel) and they wanted to make a bigger film filled with more special effects. Unfortunately, in the process, they were unable to retain the magic of the first. One of the key reasons for this is the relationship between Larry and his son is pushed to the sidelines. When Larry has to jet to Washington, DC, his son stays at home in New York. They have a brief phone conversation, but Larry quickly loses reception as he enters the archives.Strangely, Robin Williams is also pushed to the sidelines, a bit. Teddy Roosevelt briefly explains the situation to Larry, but for some reason, they are not shipping his statue to Washington. He is staying behind. When Larry and Amelia are running around, they happen upon the Hall of Presidents and Williams provides the voice for a bust of Roosevelt, giving them some advice. Perhaps they figured Williams and Azaria in the same film would be too much.But when Larry arrives at the Smithsonian, he quickly hooks up with General Custer (Bill Hader, TV's ""Saturday Night Live""). Hader is good, revealing some insecurity the famous General may have had, but this is essentially a remix of the Teddy Roosevelt character. Why not just stick with him?There are two really good additions to the film. Hank Azaria plays Kahmunrah, the Egyptian King. Azaria is a gifted comedian and has a real talent with voices and impersonations; he plays many characters on ""The Simpsons"". In ""Museum"" he does a spot on impersonation of Boris Karloff capturing the great film actor's inflections, mannerisms, speech patterns. Why does he do this? Because Karloff famously played ""The Mummy"" in the early 30s. The Mummy was an Egyptian King who wanted to comeback from the dead and rule again. Kahmunrah is an Egyptian King who wants to come back from the dead and rule again. It's a natural leap.What I think is even more impressive about Azaria's performance is that 95% of the audience won't even know he is trying to emulate the film icon. But he almost appears to have brought Karloff back from the dead.Azaria also provides the voices for statues of Lincoln and The Thinker, both of which come alive when the tablet arrives at the Smithsonian.Amy Adams plays Amelia Earhart and she is a kick. She seems to be channeling the spirit of Rosalind Russell or Jean Arthur, firing her dialogue at Larry like she has just come in from a night dancing with Fred Astaire at the Trocadero before flying across the Atlantic. She has moxy and looks like a gal who can hold her own. It is a nice, fun performance.As Larry and all of the other characters begin chasing each other through the various museums of the Smithsonian, Larry quickly realizes the tablet has more power than he originally thought. Modern art installations come to life; paintings and photos become real and more. There is an amusing bit with one of the photos, but this new 'bit' just seems to be a little excessive, like the kids running amok in the candy store. We can do what with all of the extra money we have? Hooray. However, when they do this, they simply throw the magic and quaintness of the original out the window.And that is ultimately the problem with ""Night at the Museum - Battle for the Smithsonian""; it doesn't achieve the right balance between character and special effects, story and madcap chase, dialogue and volume.",2,Not Magical,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,5564,"['Night', 'Museum', 'Battle',

Also, like every other sequel that is actually unnecessary, everything in ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" should be bigger than before. It is not surprising that producers have changed the setting of the story, this time the Smithsonian Institute, the world's largest museum complex.After three years from the original Ben Stiller's Larry Daley, formerly a night guard of American Museum of Natural History, is now a successful businessman. When the tablet of Ahmunrah has been shipped to the Smithsonian Institute, however, Larry has to disguise himself as a guard and infiltrate the place.The rambling narrative is bad enough, but the real problem is the lazy direction (director is Shawn Levy, ""The Pink Panther"") and uninteresting characters. What could have been a very unique experience (considering the vast collections of the Smithsonian Institute), is reduced to a set of half-hearted jokes and romance involving Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams, totally wasted).The actors do their best and some of them are really funny. With the cast that includes Hank Azaria, Bill Hader, Ricky Gervais, Christopher Guest, Steve Coogan, Robin Williams and Owen Wilson, it is hard to make an absolutely unfunny movie.

1229312,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001PR0Y4O,Turfseer,"[4, 14]","Warning: This review may contain spoilers>>From the outset. I kept wondering how ordinary security guard schlub Ben Stiller could so easily become an infomercial king, hawking glow in the dark flashlights and earning gobs of money.  Then I realized that the screenwriters couldn't just have him start off as a security guard at the museum again because people don't want to see the same thing twice when they pay money for a sequel.  Nonetheless, the infomercial angle ends up being dropped like a hot potato and Stiller is back at the museum just like in the original.  This time he learns that his pals at the Museum of Natural History are being shipped off to the basement archives at the Smithsonian.  To make matters worse, they have to deal with some crazy Pharoah guy who needs to figure out a secret code that will unlock a door to ancient Egypt where all of his nasty minions are just waiting to get loose and wreak havoc upon an unsuspecting world.There are moments in `Battle for the Smithsonian' that feel like the script was dispensed with and the action was completely improvised.  Take the scene with Stiller trying to break into the basement at the Smithsonian, opposed by the security guard played by Jonah Hill.  The joke is that the security guard is a wuss and is easily dissuaded by the more persuasive Stiller.  And this is the problem for every character in the film.  They are all buffoons in one way or another and carry no moral weight.The antagonist is played by Hank Azaria who has a one note part as a lisping Pharoah, Kahmunrah.  He's joined by three villains from history: Napoleon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible and a young Al Capone.  The three allies of the Egyptian have virtually nothing to do throughout the film--Bonaparte at one point jumps on top of Stiller, Capone waves a machine gun and Ivan basically scowls.Stiller's allies fare no better.  Owen Wilson plays a miniature cowboy trapped inside an hourglass by Kahmunrah.  We're supposed to laugh as he is gradually submerged by the sand inside the hourglass pouring down on top of him.  Steve Coogan is Wilson's buddy, playing another `miniature', this time the famous Roman Emperor `Octavius'.  The Emperor's big moment is when he mistakes a squirrel for a giant creature and rides him back into the Smithsonian thinking he can take on Kahmunrah's army of bad guys.  No laughs there!  Bill Hader plays General Custer with an inferiority complex: he bemoans the fact that he'll always be remembered for his one bad moment at the Little Big Horn with all his other accomplishments ignored.  While Custer is a complete clown, the Indian Princess Sacajawea berates him not for his hatred of Native Americans but rather for his incompetence as a soldier.It takes a long time before Stiller's love interest, feminist icon Amelia Earhardt, played by Amy Adams, does what she does best: i.e. fly a plane.  But most of the time she's nothing more than the feeble love interest in the film--chasing Stiller around, acting a bit spunky and providing moral support.  Other wasted parts include Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt (in dual incarnations as Teddy on horseback and as a talking bust), a completely forgettable Attila the Hun and a bunch of grunting Neanderthals.The plot is quite disappointing.  After Kahmunrah finds out the `secret code' from a Bobblehead Albert Einstein and unleashes the forces of evil, they all  inexpicably run back into the portal after a giant Abraham Lincoln (roused from his sleep at the Lincoln Memorial) confronts them.  Lincoln is reduced to an awkward giant, more like Lurch  of the old Adams Family TV series than the great statesman of American history.`Battle' was written mainly for the special effects department to show their stuff.  There are a few clever visual effects when famous paintings come to life (most notable is when Stiller and Adams jump into the famous scene on VJ Day with the sailor and the nurse making out in Times Square).  Rodan's `Thinker' comes to life as a wise-talking Guido and there are three angel statues singing updated rap versions of r&b; classics.  All of this is nice to look at but it's simply not very funny.I have never been a big fan of Ben Stiller but here he outdoes himself in a role that relies mainly on slapstick humor.  There is nothing clever or witty about Battle for the Smithsonian.  It represents a further dumbing down of American comedy.  And the producers here should heed the old admonition--what goes around, comes around!  Hopefully Kahmunrah will be putting a new curse on them in the future--at the boxoffice, where it hurts!",1,The dumbing down of American Comedy,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,4612,"['Warning', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '>', '>', 'outset', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'ordinary', 'security', 'guard', 'schlub', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'become', 'infomercial', 'king', 'hawking', 'glow', 'dark', 'flashlights', 'earning', 'gobs', 'money', 'Then', 'realized', 'screenwriters', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'start', 'off', 'security', 'guard', 'museum', 'again', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'same', 'thing', 'twice', 'when', 'pay', 'money', 'sequel', 'Nonetheless', 'infomercial', 'angle', 'up', 'being', 'dropped', 'hot', 'potato', 'Stiller', 'back', 'museum', 'just', 'original', 'time', 'pals', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'are', 'being', 'shipped', 'basement', 'Smithsonian', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'have', 'deal', 'crazy', 'Pharoah', 'guy', 'who', 'figure', 'out', 'secret', 'code', 'will', 'unlock', 'door', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'where', 'nasty', 'minions', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'get', 'loose', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'unsuspecting', 'are', 'moments', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian', 'feel', 'script', 'was', 'dispensed', 'action', 'was', 'completely', 'improvised', 'Take', 'scene', 'Stiller', 'trying', 'break', 'basement', 'Smithsonian', 'opposed', 'security', 'guard', 'played', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'joke', 'security', 'guard', 'wuss', 'easily', 'dissuaded', 'more', 'persuasive', 'Stiller', 'problem', 'character', 'film', 'are', 'buffoons', 'one', 'way', 'carry', 'moral', 'weight.The', 'antagonist', 'played', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'who', 'one', 'note', 'part', 'lisping', 'Pharoah', 'Kahmunrah', 'joined', 'three', 'villains', 'history', 'Napoleon', 'Bonaparte', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'young', 'Al', 'Capone', 'three', 'allies', 'Egyptian', 'have', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'Bonaparte', 'one', 'point', 'jumps', 'top', 'Stiller', 'Capone', 'machine', 'gun', 'Ivan', 'basically', 'scowls.Stiller', 'allies', 'fare', 'better', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'miniature', 'cowboy', 'trapped', 'hourglass', 'Kahmunrah', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'laugh', 'gradually', 'submerged', 'sand', 'hourglass', 'pouring', 'down', 'top', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Wilson', 'buddy', 'playing', 'miniature', 'time', 'famous', 'Roman', 'Emperor', 'Octavius', 'Emperor', 'big', 'moment', 'when', 'squirrel', 'giant', 'creature', 'back', 'Smithsonian', 'thinking', 'can', 'take', 'Kahmunrah', 'army', 'bad', 'guys', 'laughs', 'there', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'General', 'Custer', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'bad', 'moment', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'other', 'accomplishments', 'ignored', 'Custer', 'complete', 'clown', 'Indian', 'Princess', 'Sacajawea', 'not', 'hatred', 'Native', 'Americans', 'rather', 'incompetence', 'soldier.It', 'long', 'time', 'Stiller', 'love', 'interest', 'feminist', 'icon', 'Amelia', 'Earhardt', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'what', 'best', 'i.e', 'fly', 'plane', 'most', 'time', 'nothing', 'more', 'feeble', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'chasing', 'Stiller', 'acting', 'bit', 'spunky', 'providing', 'moral', 'support', 'Other', 'wasted', 'parts', 'include', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'dual', 'incarnations', 'Teddy', 'horseback', 'talking', 'bust', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'bunch', 'grunting', 'Neanderthals.The', 'plot', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'Kahmunrah', 'out', 'secret', 'code', 'Bobblehead', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'forces', 'evil', 'inexpicably', 'run', 'back', 'portal', 'giant', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'roused', 'sleep', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'Lincoln', 'reduced', 'awkward', 'giant', 'more', 'Lurch', 'old', 'Adams', 'Family', 'TV', 'series', 'great', 'statesman', 'American', 'history.', 'Battle', 'was', 'written', 'mainly', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'show', 'stuff', 'are', 'few', 'clever', 'visual', 'effects', 'when', 'famous', 'paintings', 'come', 'life', 'most', 'notable', 'when', 'Stiller', 'Adams', 'jump', 'famous', 'scene', 'VJ', 'Day', 'sailor', 'nurse', 'making', 'out', 'Times', 'Square', 'Rodan', 'Thinker', 'life', 'wise-talking', 'Guido', 'are', 'three', 'statues', 'singing', 'updated', 'rap', 'versions', 'r', 'b', 'classics', 'nice', 'look', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'funny.I', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'here', 'role', 'mainly', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'nothing', 'clever', 'witty', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian', 'further', 'dumbing', 'down', 'American', 'comedy', 'producers', 'here', 'should', 'heed', 'old', 'admonition', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'Hopefully', 'Kahmunrah', 'will', 'be', 'putting', 'new', 'curse', 'future', 'boxoffice', 'where']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian
1229313,A3373I4II32NA1,B001PR0Y4O,Tyler,"[0, 0]","I bought both movies on Amazon. For the first one, there was a need for a replacement because my old copy of the DVD got all scratched up. But the second movie intrigued me, so I ordered that as well, and it came first. I just finished the movie last night and this is my version of how the movie hit me.Larry Daley no longer works for the museum as a night guard. He is now a major success with his own company and introducing the new glow-in-the-dark flashlight with the help of a former world-champion boxer, of course. But he tends to remember the museum displays that still come to life night after night due to the tablet of Akmenrah and comes to pay a visit to the museum, which turns out to be closed for renovation. The British-sounding director is surprised at his sudden appearance, and just before leaving Larry alone to wander the museum at night, informs him that most of the displays are being retired to the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. for a whole new, hip version of the museum that would attract more visitors.As the displays come to life, they pop out of their packing boxes, looking somewhat disgruntled with their situation. As Teddy Roosevelt, played by Robin Williams, informs Larry that he will actually be staying at the museum, the cowboy, Jedediah, played by Owen Wilson, is bitter by Larry's somewhat lack of visiting for the past few months, due to Larry's sudden rise to success all of a sudden. I also noticed that there was a lot less screaming from the horde of Mongols with Genghis Khan, and they seem pretty quiet during the entire movie for some reason.Shortly after their transfer to D.C., Larry miraculously gets a call on his phone by Jedidiah himself, who claims in a hurry that they're involved with some not-too-friendly types, and the call is soon cut off, with sounds of fighting in the background. Larry flies to D.C. and his son informs him on the phone that the Smithsonian is actually a series of many museums throughout the D.C. area and the archives are placed several levels underground, which is secure by many guards. In his eagerness to help his museum friends, Larry has a run-in with one guard in order to secretly swipe the guard's access ID badge, and then dons a guard outfit in the locker room to blend in with the surroundings.In the Archives, Larry discovers, just as the sun is going down, that his friends are trapped in a large metal container, surrounded by maybe a dozen Egyptian guards and a wicked ruler, the original pharaoh's brother who is jealous of his brother's rise to the throne. The bad guy demands the tablet of Akmenrah which has some combination to unlock his own army from the Underworld in order to take over the present world. Finding that the combination has changed, the wicked Egyptian places the small Jedediah in a sand timer and says Larry has one hour to find out the new combination, or his cowboy friend will be covered in the rising sand.Larry has encounters with two very odd characters of this movie, which obviously make the sequel a huge hit. The free-spirited Amelia Earhart, who has a small crush on Larry throughout the entire movie in their time together, and let's not forget Major-General George A. Custer of the 7th Cavalry. Custer has a few moments where he acts like a pompous ass with his insane ideas of attacking the enemy and his very vain look on himself, but he also fears that everyone will always know him for his 1876 failure at Little Big Horn for dying with more than 200 soldiers under attack by fierce Indian tribes, and wants to make a new reputation for his leadership in the never-will-be-known Battle of the Smithsonian.With time running out, and with Amelia Earhart at his side, Larry Daley seeks out the combination at the infamous Air and Space Museum while escaping the clutches of the Egyptian's cronies, which include Napoleon and a few French soldiers, and Ivan the Terrible. He has a very blood-chilling ride on the Wright Brother's first airplane and an encounter with the infamous African-American Tuskegee Airmen of WW2, not to mention a giant squid and the giant Abraham Lincoln statue from the Lincoln Memorial, followed by the Battle of the Smithsonian, which was action-packed. This movie sent chills of excitement through me the entire time and a few times, I even had to rewind the movie scenes to be like, ""Oh, I had to definitely see that again. Unreal!""A small note to those who placed low ratings on this movie. You do not have a life or a sense of the history that has happened before you were even born, and the actors who played those characters made a great and valiant effort to get inside the heads of those great people of the past. Both of these movies about history displays coming to life after nightfall gave me the sense that I should visit these museums someday to get a feel for more of this history. Sorry that you don't feel the same way, but I only gave this movie five stars because it clearly doesn't go up as high as ten.",5,Just as good as the first one!,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,4990,"['bought', 'movies', 'Amazon', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'need', 'replacement', 'old', 'copy', 'DVD', 'got', 'scratched', 'up', 'second', 'movie', 'intrigued', 'so', 'ordered', 'as', 'well', 'came', 'first', 'just', 'finished', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'version', 'how', 'movie', 'hit', 'me.Larry', 'Daley', 'no', 'longer', 'museum', 'night', 'guard', 'now', 'major', 'success', 'own', 'company', 'introducing', 'new', 'glow-in-the-dark', 'flashlight', 'help', 'former', 'world-champion', 'boxer', 'course', 'remember', 'museum', 'still', 'come', 'life', 'night', 'night', 'due', 'tablet', 'Akmenrah', 'pay', 'visit', 'museum', 'out', 'be', 'closed', 'renovation', 'British-sounding', 'director', 'surprised', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'just', 'leaving', 'Larry', 'alone', 'wander', 'museum', 'night', 'most', 'displays', 'are', 'being', 'retired', 'Smithsonian', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'whole', 'new', 'hip', 'version', 'museum', 'would', 'attract', 'more', 'displays', 'come', 'life', 'pop', 'packing', 'boxes', 'looking', 'somewhat', 'disgruntled', 'situation', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Larry', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'staying', 'museum', 'cowboy', 'Jedediah', 'played', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'bitter', 'Larry', 'somewhat', 'lack', 'visiting', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'due', 'Larry', 'sudden', 'rise', 'success', 'sudden', 'also', 'noticed', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'screaming', 'horde', 'Mongols', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'seem', 'pretty', 'quiet', 'entire', 'movie', 'reason.Shortly', 'transfer', 'D.C.', 'Larry', 'miraculously', 'call', 'phone', 'Jedidiah', 'who', 'hurry', ""'re"", 'involved', 'not-too-friendly', 'types', 'call', 'soon', 'cut', 'off', 'sounds', 'fighting', 'background', 'Larry', 'D.C.', 'son', 'phone', 'Smithsonian', 'actually', 'series', 'many', 'museums', 'D.C.', 'area', 'archives', 'are', 'placed', 'several', 'levels', 'secure', 'many', 'guards', 'eagerness', 'help', 'museum', 'friends', 'Larry', 'run-in', 'one', 'guard', 'order', 'secretly', 'swipe', 'guard', 'access', 'ID', 'badge', 'then', 'guard', 'outfit', 'locker', 'room', 'blend', 'surroundings.In', 'Archives', 'Larry', 'just', 'sun', 'going', 'down', 'friends', 'are', 'trapped', 'large', 'metal', 'container', 'surrounded', 'maybe', 'dozen', 'Egyptian', 'guards', 'wicked', 'ruler', 'original', 'pharaoh', 'brother', 'who', 'jealous', 'brother', 'rise', 'throne', 'bad', 'guy', 'tablet', 'Akmenrah', 'combination', 'unlock', 'own', 'army', 'Underworld', 'order', 'take', 'over', 'present', 'world', 'Finding', 'combination', 'changed', 'wicked', 'Egyptian', 'small', 'Jedediah', 'sand', 'timer', 'Larry', 'one', 'hour', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'combination', 'cowboy', 'friend', 'will', 'be', 'covered', 'rising', 'sand.Larry', 'encounters', 'two', 'very', 'odd', 'characters', 'movie', 'obviously', 'make', 'sequel', 'huge', 'hit', 'free-spirited', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'who', 'small', 'crush', 'Larry', 'entire', 'movie', 'time', 'together', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Major-General', 'George', 'A.', 'Custer', '7th', 'Cavalry', 'Custer', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'pompous', 'ass', 'insane', 'ideas', 'attacking', 'enemy', 'very', 'vain', 'look', 'also', 'everyone', 'will', 'always', 'know', '1876', 'failure', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'dying', 'more', '200', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'fierce', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'make', 'new', 'reputation', 'leadership', 'never-will-be-known', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian.With', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'side', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'out', 'combination', 'infamous', 'Air', 'Space', 'Museum', 'escaping', 'clutches', 'Egyptian', 'cronies', 'include', 'Napoleon', 'few', 'French', 'soldiers', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'very', 'blood-chilling', 'ride', 'Wright', 'Brother', 'first', 'airplane', 'encounter', 'infamous', 'African-American', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'WW2', 'not', 'mention', 'giant', 'squid', 'giant', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'statue', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'followed', 'Battle', 'Smithsonian', 'was', 'action-packed', 'movie', 'sent', 'chills', 'excitement', 'entire', 'time', 'few', 'times', 'even', 'had', 'rewind', 'movie', 'scenes', 'be', 'Oh', 'had', 'definitely', 'see', 'again', 'Unreal', 'A', 'small', 'note', 'who', 'placed', 'low', 'ratings', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'life', 'sense', 'history', 'happened', 'were', 'even', 'born', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'characters', 'made', 'great', 'valiant', 'effort', 'get', 'heads', 'great', 'people', 'past', 'movies', 'history', 'displays', 'coming', 'life', 'gave', 'sense', 'should', 'visit', 'museums', 'someday', 'get', 'feel', 'more', 'history', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'only', 'gave', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'go', 'up', 'as', 'high', 'ten']",Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian

The first Night in the Museum missed the mark with most adults but it was a terrific vehicle to introduce the fun of a museum to kids.  Also very funny, Smithsonian has more.  It actually teaches those same kids, now 3 years older, that there is real adventure to be found when they know the stories and the personalities of the exhibits in a museum.  There are dozens of teachable references to history and art that are presented with style and grace.  I know this might sound pedantic, but it is anything but.  There is real joy in these historical characters from Napoleon with the ""Napoleon complex"" to the Pharaoh with a speech impediment.  And all of them will pan out when Googled and will contribute to the education of any who are interested.  As a teacher and a parent, I like that.Ben Stiller turns in a lazy performance but you won't notice because Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart steals the picture as she usually does.  Hank Azaria is hilarious in several roles including the aforementioned Pharaoh as is Bill Hader as General Custer.  In fact the entire cast including several star cameos (including the voices of the Jonas Brothers) are caught having great fun in this wonderful fantasy.If you have kids you can take them and actually enjoy the film yourself.

Well, we [my husband, myself and preschooler] were driving by the dollar movies and saw this being featured, so we decided to give it a try.I have to say that my husband and I were underwhelmed by the movie - mainly because we had watched the first, and felt that the earlier movie was much funnier and more original in its premise. In this second installment, the novelty has worn off [at least for us], and we felt the dialogue was rather childish and unimaginative. The effects are above average [could have done without those annoying cupids], but it just doesn't measure up to the original.My preschooler on the other hand, devoured this movie! She loved the effects, the various characters, and kept asking me questions to do with the plot and characters throughout the movie. This by itself, made the movie a worthwhile watch. She actually sat still and watched it through, and even after the movie, kept asking questions about Abe Lincoln [the big white statue] etc. The language used was clean, and there weren't really any offensive content in the movie [one particular scene which I didn't like and found rather annoying really was the one where Ben Stiller's character indulges in the slapping back and forth with the monkeys which I had to emphasize to my preschooler was NOT desirable behavior].All in all, I think my 4.5 year-old got more enjoyment out of the movie than mom and dad did. I did notice that the children in the audience were more receptive to the jokes and engaged than the adults.
