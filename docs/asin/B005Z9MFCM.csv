1505713,A18D0R137EYS6C,B005Z9MFCM,Clinton Enlow,"[0, 0]","I have to admit that I'm a sucker for atmospheric settings which is why I was drawn into liking Texas Killing Fields even when the movie itself wasn't living up to the premise. It is by no means a great movie but bolstered by a decent cast giving it their all I'm not one to write it off as a misfire.The idea of the story is intriguing. In a small stretch of land through Houston to Galveston there have been a string of unsolved murders involving young women who's bodies are dumped in what has become known as The Killing Fields. This has been going on for the past thirty years adding up to about thirteen unsolved homicides. Thats an interesting story that unfortunately is muddled by a by the numbers script that takes every serial killer cliche it can and throws it in with a handfull of scenes based on true incidents.The script as its presented is a bit of a mess in the long run involving two cops played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Sam Worthington investigating the murder of a teenage girl. Morgan is a honest cop, a family man from New York with a dark past and penchant for religion while Worthington is the young hothead with an ex-wife who keeps stealing Morgan from his jurisdiction to investigate another murder which may be related to their killing. Or maybe not as the movie seems to drop this plot point after a pivotal scene involving two killers in a car. Theres also young Chloe Grace Moretz put into mortal danger and the daughter of a town floozie who has a nurturing relationship with Morgans policeman and soon of course finds herself in the sights of the killer.I can understand the idea of the split case issue but the way in which one construction of the plot is dropped is just jarring taken with a reveal of the killers thats left a little on the wanting side as far as motivations go. The film then unfortunately throws in little scenes involving a late night phone call from the killer or an early attack on a single mother which look good but don't really add anything to the question of why or how the killer is operating in the first place.The story is truthfully better when it sticks with the procedural aspects of the story following the two cops around as they interview suspects, search for clues and simply follow the threads of the mystery to solve it. The moments of character buildup are decent and well acted by the cast. Its always great to Jeffrey Dean Morgan utilized in more humanistic role outside of some of the jerk characters He's portrayed in film. Sam Worthington criticized for his blandness does create this sort of quarterback detective thats interesting to watch. Moretz continues to shine as rising starlet with the thankless role as victim, and in his few scenes Stephen Graham is excellent as a creepy live in boyfriend to Moretz's mom. All of it held up in an atmosphere thats undeniably gritty but picturesqe, reminiscent of films like Fargo or Blood Simple in making the setting just as much of a character.Director Ami Mann is if you haven't read it the daughter of Michael Mann and while her debut feature doesn't equal up to his work on similar films like Manhunter, it didn't feel to me like the drab subpar execution its been made out to be. With a little more focus on her next feature where story is concerned she could be a talent to watch.In all Texas Killing Fields is a flawed film thats worth a rental at bestThe Blu-Ray is a minimal affair at best. The image is good but nothing spectacular keeping the gritty view of the story's realistic ambitions with a good audio track to compliment it. The only extra is commentary with director Mann and the writer who give a good overview on the case but again is nothing I found totally mesmerizing. If you like the film there's nothing to really appreciate on the disc especially at a twenty dollar tag most retailers are offering the disc at.",3,Texas Killing Fields,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,3866,"['have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'atmospheric', 'settings', 'why', 'was', 'drawn', 'liking', 'Texas', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'even', 'when', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'living', 'up', 'premise', 'great', 'movie', 'bolstered', 'decent', 'cast', 'giving', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'write', 'off', 'misfire.The', 'idea', 'story', 'intriguing', 'small', 'stretch', 'land', 'Houston', 'Galveston', 'have', 'been', 'string', 'unsolved', 'murders', 'involving', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'bodies', 'are', 'dumped', 'what', 'become', 'known', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'been', 'going', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'adding', 'up', 'thirteen', 'unsolved', 'homicides', 'Thats', 'interesting', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'muddled', 'numbers', 'script', 'serial', 'killer', 'cliche', 'can', 'throws', 'handfull', 'scenes', 'based', 'true', 'incidents.The', 'script', 'presented', 'bit', 'mess', 'long', 'run', 'involving', 'two', 'cops', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'investigating', 'murder', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Morgan', 'honest', 'cop', 'family', 'man', 'New', 'York', 'dark', 'past', 'penchant', 'religion', 'Worthington', 'young', 'hothead', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'stealing', 'Morgan', 'jurisdiction', 'investigate', 'murder', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'killing', 'maybe', 'not', 'movie', 'drop', 'plot', 'point', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'involving', 'two', 'killers', 'car', 'also', 'young', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'put', 'mortal', 'danger', 'daughter', 'town', 'floozie', 'who', 'nurturing', 'relationship', 'Morgans', 'policeman', 'soon', 'course', 'finds', 'sights', 'killer.I', 'can', 'understand', 'idea', 'split', 'case', 'issue', 'way', 'one', 'construction', 'plot', 'dropped', 'just', 'jarring', 'taken', 'reveal', 'killers', 'thats', 'left', 'little', 'wanting', 'side', 'as', 'far', 'motivations', 'go', 'film', 'then', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'scenes', 'involving', 'late', 'night', 'phone', 'call', 'killer', 'early', 'attack', 'single', 'mother', 'look', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'question', 'why', 'how', 'killer', 'operating', 'first', 'place.The', 'story', 'truthfully', 'better', 'when', 'procedural', 'aspects', 'story', 'following', 'two', 'cops', 'interview', 'suspects', 'search', 'clues', 'simply', 'follow', 'threads', 'mystery', 'solve', 'moments', 'character', 'buildup', 'are', 'decent', 'well', 'acted', 'cast', 'always', 'great', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'utilized', 'more', 'humanistic', 'role', 'jerk', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'criticized', 'blandness', 'create', 'sort', 'quarterback', 'detective', 'thats', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Moretz', 'shine', 'rising', 'starlet', 'thankless', 'role', 'victim', 'few', 'scenes', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'excellent', 'creepy', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'Moretz', 'mom', 'held', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'thats', 'undeniably', 'gritty', 'picturesqe', 'reminiscent', 'films', 'Fargo', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'making', 'setting', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'character.Director', 'Ami', 'Mann', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'daughter', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'debut', 'feature', ""n't"", 'equal', 'up', 'work', 'similar', 'films', 'Manhunter', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'drab', 'subpar', 'execution', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'next', 'feature', 'where', 'story', 'concerned', 'could', 'be', 'talent', 'watch.In', 'Texas', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'flawed', 'film', 'thats', 'worth', 'rental', 'bestThe', 'Blu-Ray', 'minimal', 'affair', 'best', 'image', 'good', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'keeping', 'gritty', 'view', 'story', 'realistic', 'ambitions', 'good', 'audio', 'track', 'compliment', 'only', 'extra', 'commentary', 'director', 'Mann', 'writer', 'who', 'give', 'good', 'overview', 'case', 'again', 'nothing', 'found', 'totally', 'mesmerizing', 'like', 'film', 'nothing', 'really', 'appreciate', 'disc', 'especially', 'twenty', 'dollar', 'tag', 'most', 'retailers', 'are', 'offering', 'disc']",N/A

1505722,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005Z9MFCM,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","There is an area known as the ""killing fields"" in Texas, where 30 girls and young women have turned up dead since the 1970s. This stretch of land runs along I-45 between Houston and Galveston, Texas and is the bloodiest stretch of highway in America. Here are the basics on the murders that have haunted the area for decades. Just 50 miles long, over the past 38 years nearly 40 women and young girls have been murdered or vanished along this highway. Their bodies have been dumped in fields, parks and the many bodies of water in the area, usually in a sickening state. As of today, the killer is still on the loose. And detectives admit, they're no closer to catching him--although scientific advances could finally end the macabre dance of death. He first struck June 17, 1971. Colette Wilson, 13, had been dropped off from school band practice by the conductor at a bus stop. The young girl seemingly disappeared from the face of the earth. Five months later her nude body was discovered 40 miles away. She died of a single gunshot wound to the head and her flute was never located.The story is grim and unfortunately so is the film version written by Don Ferrarone, a federal agent who investigated the slaughters, who has said  `If you can just imagine having one of these little girls out here...one of these young girls out here...and there's no chance for them to be rescued, to be helped. And they're on they're own.' It was the haunting faces of the lost that inspired Ferrarone to write the screenplay for the film.The story for the film changes the names of everyone. Mike Souder (Sam Worthington), a homicide detective in a small Texan town, Texas City, and his partner, transplanted New York City cop Brian Heigh (Jefffrey Dean Stanton), track a sadistic serial killer dumping his victims' mutilated bodies in a nearby marsh locals called 'The Killing Fields'. Though the swampland crime scenes are outside their jurisdiction, Heigh is unable to turn his back on solving the gruesome murders. Despite his partner's warnings, he sets out to investigate the crimes. Before long, the killer changes the game and begins hunting the detectives, teasing them with possible clues at the crime scenes while always remaining one step ahead. When familiar local girl Anne (Chlo Grace Moretz) goes missing, the detectives find themselves racing against time to catch the killer and save the young girl's life.  That much of the plot is linear, but the sidebars of the local cop (Jessica Chastain, in a completely unnecessary tiny role) who happens to be the ex-wife of Souder, the stopover in a house of prostitution for young girls, the smarmy family of suspects, and other incidentals simply clot the plot and make the dark film (mood as well as lack of light) even more difficult to follow. Worthington and Morgan offer good performance with the poor script they are given, but in the end nothing is resolved and the director finds the need of adding a happy-wappy resolution which is completely out of place.

It has a sense of style and authenticity that completely drew me into the story.  Worthington and Morgan are excellent as two small town detectives trying to run down a killer who preys on young women.  I have seen some reviews which said Jessica Chastain's part was more or less superfluous to the story, but to me she is such a fine actress that she only adds to anything she appears in.  There are also those who said the direction was weak or uneven.  I felt just the opposite.  But one of the strongest points going for this story, in my opinion, are the actors cast as villains in the piece.  They are so realistically frightening in their parts they almost made my skin crawl.  And, another huge plus in this film is you have another chance to see a wonderful young actress who is just starting to come into her own and that is Chloe Grace Moretz.

1505727,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B005Z9MFCM,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[2, 4]","I'm going to start off my series of reviews for October with Texas Killing Fields. All in all I thought this was a solid. This movie didn't get a wide release which is kind of sad. Directed by Ami Canaan Mann the daughter of Michael Mann. It stars Sam Worthington as Detective Mike Sounder, Jeffery Dean Morgan as Detective Brian Heigh, Jessica Chastin as Dective Pam Stall & Chloe Grace Mortez as Anne Slinger, The story is 3 Dectives Brian Heigh, Mike Sounder & Pam Stall are looking for this killer who dumps his victims bodies in the fields in the country. They are looking for this missing girl Kristen & then you have this sub plot going on with Dective Heigh & this girl named Anne that he looks out for they imply that Anne's Mother's Boyfriend is some kind of sicko. I mean you can draw your own conculsions. The 1 fault that I have with this movie with this guy that drives this Green Pontiac this plot point goes no where. 1 night you have these 2 men attack a single Mom. Detective Heigh hurries to that woman's house as the 2 men are escaping they hit Detective Heigh in the head with a shovel. Detective Heigh becomes obssed with the case. The lady & her daughter are fine. Heigh & Sounder get a call & it's the sounds of this woman being killed. Detective Heigh has this guy track the call & it's coming from a cell & it's located in The Killing Fields. Detective Heigh gets a call from Detective Pam Stall they found the body of that girl they were looking for. Detective Sounder is mad cause The Killing Fields isn't their beat. Detective's Heigh & Stall got a call about this hand in a deep freezer at this bar. It matches with hand that is in an evidence photo. Detective Heigh notices a ring that's missing they go into the bar Detective Heigh asks these 2 rednecks about the ring. 1 of the hicks says "" So this is the gratitude we get for giving you guys a hand?"" A fight breaks out Heigh starts punching this guy & won't stop. Detective Sounder arrives & has to pull him off. Deteive Heigh finds the ring on that hick he had been wearing as a necklace. Outside you have this scene that love this local sheriff is talking to Detective Sounder about when he used to come over to the same bar with his dad & he had to drive his father & his friends home cause they were so drunk. Detective Sounder's response ""Next time you don't answer my partners questions I will take your peace officers licence & I'm going to shove it up your a  s  s."" He finishes up by saying say hi to Nancy for me. The next day you Anne taken off at this gas station. Detective Heigh heads off to The Killing Fields. He tries to get ahold of Sounder who is after these 2 guys in a Green Pontiac. It's a sub plot that could've been cut out. Detective Sounder meets  up with Heigh they use Sounder's Dog to find Anne who is still alive. He has Detective Sounder get her to an ambulance. Detective Heigh goes to find the killer during the night he gets in a scuffle with The Boyfriend of Anne's Mom & he is shot in the back by Eugene Anne's Brother. Detective Sounder gets a call by the killers that his partner is dead. That guy who is helping Detective Heigh track where the phone calls are coming from helps Detective Sounder find the location of where that call came from Sounder know who it was. Sounder calls them & starts messing with them. He wants to talk with Ms Slinger. He tells her why don't you ask your boyfriend & your son what happend. Eugene tells his mom what happend. She loses it stabs her boyfriend & Eugene shoots him. He shoots Eugene in return. She stabs him again but he shoots her dead. Detective Sounder comes up on what happend. Then you have Detective Heigh who is still alive. Then you go to months later Anne now lives with Detective Heigh& his family. That's pretty much the movie. Other than that sub plot with that guy in The Green Pontiac it's a solid movie I thought. Is it anything new no. But you have really good directing by Ami Caanan Mann. A very good score by Dickon Hinchliffe. Jeffery Dean Morganwas very good. Sam Worthington did a good job. Jessica Chastin did fine. Chloe Grace Moretz was very good.

Characters popped up out of nowhere and they were spoken about like you were supposed to know what was going on with them. Same with the victims.The descriptions of the movie made it seem like a cat and mouse game between cops and a serial killer and it really just wasn't ""cat and mouse"". I was thinking it would be something along the lines ofSevenbut not even close.Had this been a cut and dry cat and mouse chase with cops vs. serial killer it would have been a decent movie. But all the bouncing around and not making much sense made this brutal to watch even with the decent acting and budget.

1505730,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B005Z9MFCM,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 3]","*-I decided to watch this movie as I am a big fan of Jessica Chastain, who emerged last year in three quite prominent movies: The Help, The Debt and Tree of Life.Even though she gained an Academy Award nomination for The Help, in my opinion the movie that showcased her best wasThe Debt, and though she did not get top billing, she was the lead actress.Some of the movies in which she stars have taken a long time to go on release if at all. Wilde Salome, based on Oscar Wilde's play, her first movie directed by Al Pacino has yet to make an appearance.Something about TKF lifts it above the ordinary, and makes it authentic. Perhaps, because it's based on a true story of a string of unsolved murders in Texas, where the bodies are occasionally found out in the oil fields, among large expanses and marshes where a body might never be found.At the beginning the body of a young girl aged 15 is found, She looks like a girl played by Chloe Moretz, who has a bad home life. She is not the victim though, and we wonder as the movie progresses and the bodies accumulate if she will become a future victim. As we get to know the character it stirs our empathy. We sense the frustration of the detectives, who are taunted by the perpetrators.The movie has the feel of a police procedural such as Law and Order SVU, yet has it's own distinct slow moving vibe. Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, are the detective partners, and Jessica has a more supporting role as a detective in a neighbouring jurisdiction who used to be married to Sam Worthington's character.The murders happen over a wide area and a long period of time and jurisdictional lines get blurred. The scenes are well put together and the movie is stylish, and several of the scenes are quite tense and gripping.I think you will like it, and I hope this was helpful.Another movie I recommend starring Jessica Chastain isJolenebased on the story by EL Doctorow, but it's not for children.

So it's not often that these sorts of films offer us little in the way of surprises when the theme is chosen. Such is the case with TEXAS KILLING FIELDS.Brian Heigh (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is the relocated police detective in question. Having moved to Texas several years earlier he is teamed up with local hot shot Mike Souder (Sam Worthington). The pair are asked to be involved by the local sheriff (and Mike's ex-wife) when it seems a serial killer is on the lose.The area in question is a matter of debate as far as jurisdiction is concerned. But killers never seem to worry about jurisdiction, they just find a place to dump a body and carry on. This seems to be the case as the bodies keep appearing and police keep investigating.Even though it isn't in Heigh's area, he continues to look into the gruesome murders which weigh heavy on his mind.Mike has a different attitude. He advises Brian to ignore the murders and concentrate on problems in their own back yard. But when the killer sees Brian taking notice he takes the murders to the police, leaving them clues and taunting them so that they'll stay on the case.While all of this is going on a young girl in the area becomes a problem as well. Her mother dumps her outside while she ""entertains"" some of the local fellas. Brian and Mike both show some concern for the young girl and take her home giving her mother a warning. But if she did that where would the movie go?The cat and mouse game back and forth between the killer, the police and the young girl is slow moving at best. The terrain is boring beyond belief to look at. And the mystery isn't all that complex that we can't figure out who's behind it all with little exertion.All of the main actors involved in this film deserve better material and fortunately they have been getting it. This may not be the worst movie ever made but it's not one that most people would seek out and rightly so. There are far more interesting and entertaining films and mysteries that offer clues in with better methods. If the shelves at the local video store are bare, then perhaps this movie would be worth checking out.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[12, 14]","Loosely inspired by actual events, TEXAS KILLING FIELDS starts off rather slowly, but evolves into an engrossing crime drama with some excellent, shocking action sequences.  Its major problem is that it presents viewers with more questions than it ultimately answers.Apparently, over many decades, there has been a series of unsolved murders on a large piece of swampland, located between Houston, Texas and the Gulf Coast.  The killings remain unsolved, in part, because police departments in different jurisdictions, for whatever reasons, did not share information.  [I gleaned this data from the Internet, because it is not made clear in the movie.]In this fictional screenplay, written by Donald F. Ferrarone and directed by Ami Canaan Mann (director Michael Mann's daughter), small town Texas cops Sam Worthington, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jessica Chastain are after a serial killer who is murdering young women and dumping their bodies in the swampland.  Unlike with the real life homicides, they do solve their case, but there are a couple of intriguing, quite surprising ""red herrings"" along the way.The performances in TEXAS KILLING FIELDS are first-rate, even if some of the character's motivations are not apparent in the script. What the film really lacks is some backstory, particularly for the detective played by Morgan, as well as a scene in which everything is put into context.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains audio commentary by Mann and Ferrarone.

In what I think is Jeffrey Dean Morgan's best performance, the film revolves around 2 detectives working in Texas City, Texas an oil town near the Gulf coast.  Brian (Morgan) is a New York transplant working with a younger local (Sam Worthington) investigating a series of murders of young women.  The trail leads to a couple no-good creeps who are involved in child prostitution among other things.  Most of the murders are believed to have been committed in a remote swampy area called the Texas Killing Fields.In that the case leads outside the city limits, a county investigator is also part of the team.  She is Pam (Jessica Chastain) who is also Mike's (Worthington) ex-wife.  Chloe Moretz is also along for the ride as the neglected teen daughter of another set of no-good crack-heads.  When she goes missing the drama intensifies leading to an unexpected but satisfactory conclusion.  Written by Don Ferrarone, the film is nothing special and certainly breaks no new ground, but is enjoyable if you like mysteries and police procedurals.  There are a few incoherent scene changes and I had a hard time understanding Worthington's mumbling attempt at a Texas accent, but otherwise worth a look.The Blu ray is a 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is very good, consistent with what Blu ray has to offer.  The Dolby TruHD 7.1 soundtrack is fine as well, but nothing special.

It opens out at a crime scene where a girl's body has been found the two homicide detectives turn up to secure the crime scene. Brian Heigh played by Jeffery Dean Morgan (`Watchmen') he prays over her, his partner is less close to god and decidedly the bad cop of the pairing. He is Mike Souther (Sam Worthington), he is divorced from Detective Pam Stall (Jessica Chastain) who works in the adjoining jurisdiction and seems to rely quite heavily on their support. Only she has a corpse too, and then they find that strangled phone calls are being made from the bayou area; a place known as the Killing Fields.As the suspects mount so does the body count. The personal riffs in all of the players lives often get in the way and there are so many ambiguous characters that you are kept guessing for a time. We also have child drug addicts, pimps and some trailer trash low life that all add to the mix. There are moments that are truly scary and not a single performance is in the foothills of bad. Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a magnificent job of the Catholic racked with guilt trying to do good in a very bad world and finally cracking in an absolutely convincing way.The music sounded very Tindersticks and actually is in the form of erstwhile member Dickon Hinchliffe, and as expected is bloody marvellous and gets the atmosphere smack on. The framing of shots is superb and the pace is perfectly timed to keep the tension up without giving you the vapours. This was supposed to be directed by Slumdog tedium maker Danny Boyle, but he dropped out saying it was too dark to ever be made. Well his loss is our gain as Michael Mann who produced this got his daughter to do the project Ami Canaan Mann, and I think she has shown that genius can be in your genes.This did not make a killing at the box office but has had wide distribution so I am hopeful that it will get the attention I feel it rightly deserves, this is a smouldering movie with just about all the right ingredients to become a classic, not a typical Hollywood film but it is all the better for it, if you are an indie film or even World cinema fan I think this would be right up your bayou - just brilliant.",5,Smouldering Tale of Murder and intrigue in the Bayous of Texas.,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,2323,"['truly', 'brilliant', 'film', 'based', 'loosely', 'case', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'picked', 'up', 'I-45', 'dumped', 'oil', 'field', 'League', 'City', 'Texas', 'out', 'crime', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'body', 'been', 'found', 'two', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'turn', 'up', 'secure', 'crime', 'scene', 'Brian', 'Heigh', 'played', 'Jeffery', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Watchmen', 'partner', 'less', 'close', 'god', 'decidedly', 'bad', 'cop', 'pairing', 'Mike', 'Souther', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'divorced', 'Detective', 'Pam', 'Stall', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'adjoining', 'jurisdiction', 'rely', 'quite', 'heavily', 'support', 'Only', 'corpse', 'too', 'then', 'find', 'strangled', 'phone', 'calls', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'bayou', 'area', 'place', 'known', 'Killing', 'Fields.As', 'suspects', 'mount', 'so', 'body', 'count', 'personal', 'riffs', 'players', 'lives', 'often', 'get', 'way', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ambiguous', 'characters', 'are', 'kept', 'guessing', 'time', 'also', 'have', 'child', 'drug', 'addicts', 'pimps', 'trailer', 'trash', 'low', 'life', 'add', 'mix', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'truly', 'scary', 'not', 'single', 'performance', 'foothills', 'bad', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'magnificent', 'job', 'Catholic', 'racked', 'guilt', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'very', 'bad', 'world', 'finally', 'cracking', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'way.The', 'music', 'sounded', 'very', 'Tindersticks', 'actually', 'form', 'erstwhile', 'member', 'Dickon', 'Hinchliffe', 'expected', 'bloody', 'marvellous', 'atmosphere', 'smack', 'framing', 'shots', 'superb', 'pace', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'keep', 'tension', 'up', 'giving', 'vapours', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'directed', 'Slumdog', 'tedium', 'maker', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'dropped', 'out', 'saying', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'Well', 'loss', 'gain', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'who', 'produced', 'got', 'daughter', 'do', 'project', 'Ami', 'Canaan', 'Mann', 'think', 'shown', 'genius', 'can', 'be', 'genes.This', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'killing', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'wide', 'distribution', 'am', 'hopeful', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'feel', 'rightly', 'smouldering', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'ingredients', 'become', 'classic', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'better', 'are', 'indie', 'film', 'even', 'World', 'cinema', 'fan', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'bayou', 'just', 'brilliant']",N/A

Detectives Heigh (Morgan) and Souder (Worthington) are investigating a series of murders. A number of women are showing up in the marsh known as the Killing Fields which is outside their jurisdiction. The killer begins to lead the detectives on the wrong track with false clues. When a young local girl goes missing time is running out. This is a movie that started off strong and gradually slowed down until the ending. To me the biggest problem with movies like this are that although they are good and worth watching they play out like a TV show episode like a CSI or NYPD Blue or Southland. Those shows work because they are 45 minutes long. When you take a 45 min show and stretch it out an hour forty-five it loses the tenseness that it needs. Although it doesn't sound like it this is a good movie but should have been a TV show. Overall, fans of recent movies like ""Small Town Murder Songs"" or ""River Murders"" will really like this. Others like me will think it's just OK. I give it a B-.",3,A very OK movie that would work better as an episode of NYPD blue or CSI. Worth a watch though due to cast.

1505749,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005Z9MFCM,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","Two police detectives played by Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan investigate a series of murders (victims are young women) around the oil fields of Texas City, area known by the locals as ""Killing Field."" The movie's interesting cast includes Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Annabeth Gish, Sheryl Lee and Chlo Grace Moretz.A major problem about the film is that the plot itself is not as interesting as the names of the cast. The subject matter (""inspired"" by the true events, the film says) is intriguing, but the storyline is disjointed. I thought at first the incoherent narrative is intentional on the part of director Ami Canaan Mann, and each piece eventually would fall into place as the bigger picture emerges. But that didn't happen.I also thought that the film's story was more about the psychological aspect of those who were desperately tracking down the elusive criminal, like William Petersen's detective in ""Manhunter,"" directed by Michael Mann, father of Ami Canaan Mann. But I was mistaken as stock characters are unappealing, even the one played by Chlo Grace Moretz.About halfway through the film I started to think the film was going nowhere. As the story heads towards the end, ""Texas Killing Field"" starts using clich&eacute; storytelling devices, which might have worked with better direction. The photography is dark and spooky, the only thing I liked about the film.",2,So Slow and Disjointed,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1398,"['Two', 'police', 'detectives', 'played', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'investigate', 'series', 'murders', 'victims', 'are', 'young', 'women', 'oil', 'fields', 'Texas', 'City', 'area', 'known', 'locals', 'Killing', 'Field', 'movie', 'interesting', 'cast', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz.A', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'plot', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'names', 'cast', 'subject', 'matter', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'film', 'intriguing', 'storyline', 'disjointed', 'thought', 'first', 'incoherent', 'narrative', 'intentional', 'part', 'director', 'Ami', 'Canaan', 'Mann', 'piece', 'eventually', 'would', 'fall', 'place', 'bigger', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.I', 'also', 'thought', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'who', 'were', 'desperately', 'tracking', 'down', 'elusive', 'criminal', 'William', 'Petersen', 'detective', 'Manhunter', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'father', 'Ami', 'Canaan', 'Mann', 'was', 'mistaken', 'stock', 'characters', 'are', 'unappealing', 'even', 'one', 'played', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz.About', 'halfway', 'film', 'started', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'nowhere', 'story', 'heads', 'end', 'Texas', 'Killing', 'Field', 'using', 'clich', 'eacute', 'storytelling', 'devices', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'direction', 'photography', 'dark', 'spooky', 'only', 'thing', 'liked', 'film']",N/A
