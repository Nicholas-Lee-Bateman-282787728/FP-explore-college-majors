1459213,AZLWT5TG37FKM,B005FQ2HBO,Blacklace 50,"[0, 0]","Stylish throwback to a time when Michael Mann's work dominated several media. The series starts out with incredible visual and plotting impact, but becomes less and less interesting as the major crimes unit leaves Chicago -- where most of them really did grow up and get their professional starts -- and sinks into the mire of Vegas. Still, it's a cinematographic gem and a walking style show. Loved the performances of Dennis Farina, Bill Smitrovich, John Santucci, Anthony Denison, Darlanne Fleugel, Stephen Lang,  -- many of whom worked multiple times with Mann. The sets are marvelous and the stable of 50's and 60's automobiles unsurpassed.

The picture seems dark and the original was dark on my tapes as well. That's why they have brightness controls on the TV's. I compared the soundtracks on disc one episodes to the same on the tapes. They seem to be the same. Disc two on the other hand wanders off to 60's style music, but not the original used in the show. I feel sure it will be the same through out. I can't seem to get past disc 2 right now. Personally I'm ready for 3, but someone always comes and gets wrapped up in it and wants to see the beginning. I have seen disc 1 and 2 now 3 times. It was over Thanksgiving when family and friends dropped by unexpectedly when I was trying to watch it. For those that have never seen the show but are familiar with the late 50's and early 60's loved the cars and pre police restrictions on handling criminals. The pilot consists of Torella saying, ""I'm a cop, I make $10,000 a year and the highest paid guy out here. I have $3.12 in my pocket. If you want, I'll take up a collection. You want a million dollars, it will take some time.""  They didn't really care or know the music was different. I know it's different, but on the other hand, I'm watching the show and enjoying the shows content and not paying much attention to the background music. It has the 60's beat and fits in. If I want to hear those songs, I can pull out my old 45's and put em on my turntable and enjoys my 50's again. You do know what 45's and the term turntable are?  Don't you?For $20, it still beats most of the current hum drum cop shows and boring commercial interruptions, pop ups, and speedy credit runs, that plague TV of today. Personally, I would rather watch some of yesteryears shows than most of today's current runs. THIS channel and ME-TV are doing just that, except they are following the normal syndication procedures and cutting material to allow for commercials.In short, is it worth the $20.

I have no idea if Image Entertainment did any remastering, but the picture looks the SAME to my eyes as the original broadcast on NBC--in other words--it looks **FINE**--I have no complaints.  SEASON TWO: As other reviewers have mentioned, many of the Season Two episodes (unfortunately) have noticable digital artifacts--the picture definitely isn't as clear as the original broadcast, but it's good enough.  Also, it **APPEARS** that this DVD set features ALL(?)...or at least MOST of the ORIGINAL MUSIC--I viewed all of the episodes in this set and virtually every episode features 1960's music--PERFORMED BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS--there are no ""covers"" or replacement songs as far as I can determine (and I am by no  means an expert on either vintage music or the CRIME STORY series).  Also, this DVD edition features Chapter Stops--something that the previous versions released by Anchor Bay didn't have.  There is **ONE ERROR** though--the Season 2 episodes ""Byline"" (on disc #9) and ""The Hearings"" (on disc #8) are presented in REVERSE ORDER (view ""Byline"" FIRST and THEN view ""The Hearings"").  To sum up, CRIME STORY--THE 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION is a **HUGE** improvement over the Anchor Bay editions--and the price (currently $19.99) is a steal!

1459238,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005FQ2HBO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[105, 111]","5 Stars: Series2 Stars: PresentationIn 1986, Michael Mann (with creators Chuck Adamson and Gustave Reininger) brought a very unusual cop show to primetime network television.  A period piece set in 1963, ""Crime Story"" was an ambitious and lavishly produced spectacle about mobster era Chicago.  At its heart, it was a tale of an obsessive police lieutenant Mike Torello (Dennis Farina) and his dogged pursuit of rising crime lord Ray Luca (Anthony Denison).  Torello and his team tracked the ruthless criminal exploits of the ever more dangerous and influential Luca in one of TV's most satisfying games of cat and mouse.  While never a particular ratings blockbuster, the show maintained a small but faithful audience who followed the action to Las Vegas for a second season.  In my opinion, neither Farina or Denison would be so perfectly cast again--both really excelled.  The show itself was very impressive on the technical side (costumes, sets, props, cinematography, lighting) and really felt different than anything else on the air.  The show has probably received more respect as a cult legend in the years since as those who worked on it went on to different and more visible projects.  I firmly maintain that if the show had been created in today's marketplace, it would have found its home on HBO or AMC and been fostered with love.Previous DVD releases have been unkind to ""Crime Story,"" and there seems to be two major issues in question for this release.  First of all, as the 25 year anniversary edition, this set includes the 21 episodes of Season One (including the two hour pilot) and the 22 episodes of Season Two sold together for the first time.  For those unfamiliar with the show and a new generation who might appreciate it, this is an excellent way to check out a really special show.  For others who have purchased or viewed previous DVD incarnations, this release will not address all of your woes.MUSIC LICENSING:  One of the biggest criticisms of the previous DVD release is that it did not contain all of the original music.  This has been a recurrent problem as television programming has expanded on the DVD market.  Why?  It's expensive to pay for the music rights.  This has resulted in (1) higher priced releases that are largely intact, (2) popular shows altered (Northern Exposure was a huge controversy), or (3) notable shows being delayed or never being released (still waiting for China Beach).  This new release of ""Crime Story"" will NOT have the original soundtrack and, at this point, it is unlikely from a financial standpoint that anyone will ever attempt to rectify this situation.  The show is too much of a niche market to make such a move cost effective.  While purists may say that this renders the show worthless (and, indeed, it is a tragedy), I still think the show deserves a new audience.PRINT QUALITY:  I, like many, was extremely disappointed in the quality of the previous releases.  Season Two, especially, was terrible!  When I started to hear news of this planned version, I was curious about any upgrades.  Upon seeing a copy, I can't say that there is an appreciable difference in video quality.  A real shame and a missed opportunity.  This does not qualify as an upgrade worthy of a repurchase.  But it is still a chance for new viewers to see a show they might not otherwise have a chance of seeing.  Is it what I would want?  No!  But that doesn't make it worthless if this is the best anyone is ever going to do!  Once again, I think ""Crime Story"" is a special show.  It'll probably never get the glossy deluxe treatment it deserves (once again, not cost effective), but I'll settle for watchable!  This, unfortuantely, is barely there.  Warning, though, due to cancellation--the show missed the opportunity to have a tidy resolution, so you will be left hanging!To wrap up, I love ""Crime Story.""  I was as dismayed by previous releases as any other fan.  This bargain repackaging is affordable, yet ultimately disappointing to existing fans.  My primary goal is to help new viewers discover the program.  Even with issues, it is still a great show and has historical significance.  The guest stars alone are a veritable who's who of top Hollywood talent.  The supporting cast is rounded out with Stephen Lang, Billy Campbell, Ted Levine, and Joseph Wiseman.  Notable guest appearances include Julia Roberts, Pam Grier, Kevin Spacey, Debbie Harry, and Gary Sinise  among so many more.  But again, the primary draw has got to be the eternal struggle between a great Farina and a thrilling Denison.  A perfect pair in a show ahead of its time!

I guess some will feel that twenty bucks for both seasons is very reasonable and will overlook the flaws, but, being I already own the Anchor Bay release, I feel that I wasted good money.

It showed cops doing thins in gray areas instead of some black and white sense of right and wrong. Dennis Farina was great as the leader of the MCU and he had a great supporting cast including Bill Smitrovic and David Abrams. Antony Denison, Ted Levine, and John Santucci were great as the criminals. The crews efforts to make it look and sound like the 1960s paid off. This is not just a shoot-em-up it has action and drama, it show us some of what goes on in the characters lives, instead of just showing us what they do at work. The two problems with this are the music which is not the original music in the series, a small problem as the music wasn't really a part of the story, the big problem is the picture quality, which is the same as the videos I had of it in the 90s, you would think that they could do a better of job of digitizing it, looks like they just copied the video right to the DVD with no processing whatsoever, but, it is not so bad as to be unwatchable.
