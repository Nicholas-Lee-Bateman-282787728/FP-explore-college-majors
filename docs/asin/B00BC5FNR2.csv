1625323,A2ZYFPHEDPBYDW,B00BC5FNR2,Jobla,"[17, 17]","THE NAME OF THE GAME IS KILL (1968) is a film that has been difficult to view for decades.  After a nearly ten year gestation period from script to finished product, the film opened one day after Robert Kennedy was murdered.  As a result of that disastrous timing, the film sunk like a stone in most markets.  It finally appeared on local TV stations in the early 1970's under the arguably better alternate title THE FEMALE TRAP.  It has seldom been seen since.VCI now presents the American home video debut of this nearly forgotten, low-budget psychodrama.  Based on a real life family (!), the story follows a Hungarian refugee (played by Jack Lord right before HAWAII FIVE-O) who's adrift in a small Arizona town.  An attractive young woman (Susan Strasberg) picks him up on a highway and brings him home to meet her weird family, which includes her loopy mother and her two oddball sisters.  The siblings each have conflicting recollections of a dreadful event from their distant past.  Things become more sinister as each of the sisters makes advances toward the hapless drifter.The film is really a mood piece, a southwestern gothic if you will.  It is not a splatter film, although some blood is indeed spilled.  It's more of a mystery which unfolds RASHOMON-style, with the siblings dealing with their own overlapping recollections of the past.VCI's new DVD presents an anamorphic widescreen transfer from two 16MM prints, the most suitable film elements located after a search of several years.  Apparently, there are no satisfactory surviving 35MM materials.  The transfer is thusly a bit soft, but it's the best we're likely to see given the film's scarcity.The DVD is chock-full of entertaining supplements.  There is a 45 minute documentary about the film's checkered history, a three minute portrait of the rock band The Electric Prunes (who perform a song on the soundtrack), and a gallery of advertising materials such as behind-the-scenes stills, lobby cards, pressbook and poster art.  The original screenwriter has contributed an audio commentary track during which he describes much conflict among some of the film's principals.  There's also a 45 minute collection of exploitation trailer previews from producer Joe Solomon, who finally released THE NAME OF THE GAME IS KILL under his Fanfare distribution banner.It's always great fun to see these forgotten shockers surface on DVD, even with their inherent imperfections.  This disc has been a labor of love for the independent horror genre buffs who refused to allow this film to remain buried.  Given the array of publicity materials and insider stories on display, this has become one of my favorite DVD releases of the year.",5,US home video premiere of forgotten low-budget shocker,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2700,"['NAME', 'THE', 'GAME', 'IS', 'KILL', '1968', 'film', 'been', 'difficult', 'view', 'decades', 'nearly', 'ten', 'year', 'gestation', 'period', 'script', 'finished', 'product', 'film', 'opened', 'one', 'day', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'murdered', 'result', 'disastrous', 'timing', 'film', 'sunk', 'stone', 'most', 'markets', 'finally', 'appeared', 'local', 'TV', 'stations', 'early', '1970', 'arguably', 'better', 'alternate', 'title', 'THE', 'FEMALE', 'TRAP', 'seldom', 'been', 'seen', 'since.VCI', 'now', 'American', 'home', 'video', 'debut', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'low-budget', 'psychodrama', 'Based', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'story', 'Hungarian', 'refugee', 'played', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'right', 'HAWAII', 'FIVE-O', 'who', 'adrift', 'small', 'Arizona', 'town', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'Susan', 'Strasberg', 'up', 'highway', 'home', 'meet', 'weird', 'family', 'loopy', 'mother', 'two', 'oddball', 'sisters', 'siblings', 'have', 'conflicting', 'recollections', 'dreadful', 'event', 'distant', 'past', 'become', 'more', 'sinister', 'sisters', 'advances', 'hapless', 'drifter.The', 'film', 'really', 'mood', 'piece', 'southwestern', 'gothic', 'will', 'not', 'splatter', 'film', 'blood', 'indeed', 'spilled', 'more', 'mystery', 'RASHOMON-style', 'siblings', 'dealing', 'own', 'overlapping', 'recollections', 'past.VCI', 'new', 'DVD', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'two', '16MM', 'prints', 'most', 'suitable', 'film', 'elements', 'located', 'search', 'several', 'years', 'Apparently', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'surviving', '35MM', 'materials', 'transfer', 'thusly', 'bit', 'soft', 'best', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'given', 'film', 'scarcity.The', 'DVD', 'chock-full', 'entertaining', 'supplements', '45', 'minute', 'documentary', 'film', 'checkered', 'history', 'three', 'minute', 'portrait', 'rock', 'band', 'Electric', 'Prunes', 'who', 'perform', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'gallery', 'advertising', 'materials', 'such', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stills', 'lobby', 'cards', 'pressbook', 'poster', 'art', 'original', 'screenwriter', 'contributed', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'much', 'conflict', 'film', 'principals', 'also', '45', 'minute', 'collection', 'exploitation', 'trailer', 'previews', 'producer', 'Joe', 'Solomon', 'who', 'finally', 'released', 'THE', 'NAME', 'THE', 'GAME', 'IS', 'KILL', 'Fanfare', 'distribution', 'banner.It', 'always', 'great', 'fun', 'see', 'forgotten', 'shockers', 'surface', 'DVD', 'even', 'inherent', 'imperfections', 'disc', 'been', 'labor', 'love', 'independent', 'horror', 'genre', 'buffs', 'who', 'refused', 'allow', 'film', 'remain', 'buried', 'Given', 'array', 'publicity', 'materials', 'insider', 'stories', 'display', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'releases', 'year']","Name of the Game Is Kill, the"

1625325,AROVSENHMWEXO,B00BC5FNR2,orvuus,"[6, 6]","I bought this mainly because I think Tisha Sterling is one of the most alluring beauties from the seventies. This is a great role for her, and she does a dance that is an iconic perfomance in and of itself. That said, all of the other actors (and there aren't many of them!) are good, even the brief appearance of Mort Mills (Psycho -- the highway patrolman) is good, with perhaps a nod back to his earlier role.  Jack Lord, Susan Strasberg, and Collin Paxton make their roles memorable.  Best of all this was lensed by no less than Vilmos Zsigmond (Deliverance, Heaven's Gate, The Deerhunter) who might as well be a second director due to the quality of his cinematography. The movie itself is a bit confusing and in the end just ok -- I enjoyed the atmosphere, cinematography, and general wierdness a lot more. This DVD has abundant extras, including an amusing making of documentary (interviews with Zsigmond, Joe Dante, and the screenwriter, Gary Crutcher, as well as the lead vocalist for the Electric Prunes, James Lowe, and a short documentary on the Electric Prunes, who performed a song for the movie (where I also found out they have reformed and actually are looking good!).  VCI has done a great job on this with the presentation and extras (are you listening, Olive Films?).  This film was thought lost for many years and it is great that it is now available.
