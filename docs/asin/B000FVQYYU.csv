996916,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000FVQYYU,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","Most western animation for children is, to put it simply, really wretched. At best, it's tolerable.But a shining exception would be the tale of the Avatar of all four elements, and to restore the balance in the world. ""Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 1"" serves as a solid first season to this series, with its colourful world, vivid action and complex characters. It may be aimed at kids, but it's a solid enough series to be enjoyed by any age.South Pole Water Tribe siblings Katara and Sokka stumble across a glowing iceberg, with a young Airbender boy named Aang (and his flying bison) sealed inside. All Airbenders were killed long ago by the Fire Nation. You guessed it (and so does Katara): Aang is the Avatar who mysteriously vanished a century ago, and is the only hope against the Fire Nation. And, uh, he's a total goofball.Unfortunately, a Fire Nation prince named Zuko has been wandering the world in search of Aang, and agrees to let the Water Tribe alone if Aang surrenders. Of course, Katara and Sokka set out to rescue their friend, and since Katara isn't experienced enough in waterbending to teach Aang how to do it, they set out for the North Pole to find a waterbending master.Along the way, the three friends encounter hurricanes, woman warriors, a loopy old king who seems very familiar, Aang's ruined temple, a Spirit World Beast, a waterbending scroll, pirates, teenage rebels, two tribes locked in an eternal feud, a mysterious man in a blue mask, fortunetellers, a rogue Firebender, and an Air Temple turned into a steampunk palace.But through the journey, Aang is confronted by the vast changes from the last century, and they are constantly attacked by the desperate Zuko, and his arrogant rival General Zhao. And when they arrive at the icy citadel at the North Pole, Aang finds that saving his friends may be far more difficult than he expected...The highest compliment I can pay ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is that it's like a thoroughly solid action/fantasy anime, with lots of elemental fights. Though it starts off on a typical quest, it's graced with good writing, excellent animation, and a general look drawn from Asian and Inuit cultures.Though most of ""Book 1: Water"" is made up of one-episode stories, the writers nevertheless weave subplots through it. The world itself is a simple but well-realized one, with different civilizations clashing against the steampunky armored tanks and ships of the Fire Nation. Assassinations, captures, escapes and spiritual journeys are all interwoven into this story.That isn't to say that it's all grim and serious -- it's quite the opposite. Lots of amusing dialogue (""I'm too young to die!"" ""I'm not, but I still don't wanna!""), slapstick, and flashy fights involving eruptions of fire, swirling water and blasts of air. It all culminates in a brilliantly epic clash, which wraps up the season nicely while leaving the way open for Aang's next lessons.And they do a good job with the characters -- Aang is a kind and selfless kid, but still a kid. He has plenty of inner guilt and turmoil over his role as the Avatar and his past mistakes, but is still down-to-earth enough to tell an amazed fortune-teller, ""Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?"" Katara and Sokka make good companions -- a sensible, short-fused girl with waterbending powers, and her rather reckless, courageous brother.And though technically the antagonist, scarred teenager Zuko also is worthy of note -- as the series winds on, we see how desperate he is to regain his lost honor, and the horrible event that led to his exile. He's the exact opposite of the nasty, proud Zhao -- and his lovably pervy uncle Iroh makes for good comic relief (""I'm certain you bathe regularly""), but there are hints that he's much more than that.""Avatar The Last Airbender: The Complete Book 1"" has a few initial wobbles, but quickly blossoms into a brilliant little show.

996922,A1XV4F7WU0YPI3,B000FVQYYU,Eviliz,"[1, 1]","While it's under season 1, this review applies to the whole series.  I am, admittedly, not this show's target audience, but I had caught an episode now and again on Nickelodeon as it originally aired.  When I saw it on my Amazon Prime list, I decided to give it a go, watch it from the start, and see what all the to-do was about.  I did not stop until the last episode.  (To be fair, I fell asleep mid season 2, when I woke up 4 hours later, I restarted that episode and watched the series to the end.)This show is not just a good animated series, it is a good series.  It doesn't rush the story, taking its time to build to one of the more satisfying final battles I have ever seen.  The characters are so multi-dimensional.  Aang, our hero, is not the usual 'older than his years, smartass adult in a child's body' which most shows with a child protagonist have.  Katara is flawed as she is clever struggling in her search to define herself and stumbling along the way, Sokka manages to be both the comic relief AND have a personality beyond that, evolving in a very sensible, natural way.  Even characters who get just one episode are given believable and sensible reasons for how they react to things.  There are only two truly 'bad' bad guys in the whole series, and even that can be argued when histories and upbringing are considered.The series poses questions far more weighty than 'will the hero beat this week's bad guy'.  Questions like  ""What defines honor?"", ""What makes a person good (or bad)?"", ""How greatly does one's past influence the future?', and ""Is defeating evil even possible, and if so, is it wise?""  Most of these questions are asked by almost every major character in the series at least once, and in no character so deeply as Prince Zuko.  In season 1, he is the villain, in season 2, he is more an anti-hero, and by season 3 he has shifted yet again.  He has flaws that he keeps through every season.  He never changes who he is.  He will always be a hot-tempered, mercurial, easily-frustrated man who wants what he wants, even if he has trouble finding the right way to get it.It is visually beautiful, emotionally gripping, enjoyable, and both funny and full of feels, sometimes in the same episode (Tales of Ba Sing Se, I'm lookin' at you!).  The only issues I have with it center on certain romantic plots which, when you realize that one is only 12 years old...edge toward 'eww' territory.

Yes it is influenced by anime and eastern culture but that doesn't make it an anime. Anime are cartoons from Japan. However this is America's best attempt at emulating an anime. Most other American series that try to gain the anime audience think it is all about the style and the way the characters look. This couldn't be farther from truth. Most anime fans enjoy anime because of the complex characters and storylines.As an anime fan I was expecting to dislike this series like I did with other American attempts to copy an anime style. However I was pleasantly surprised to find that Avatar hooked me from the beginning. Now that I am up-to-date with the American releases I can honestly say that this is one of the best American TV series I have ever seen, animated or not. It has loveable and complex characters, a fantastic continous plot, great action sequences, and an interesting setting.

Each of the episode discs include four episodes and at least one special feature.Disc one has episodes 1-4 and a ""Behind-the-Scenes Kung Fu"" featurette.  This was interesting, and it showed what different kinds of martial arts were used to inspire the bending moves for each of the four elements.Disc two contains episodes 5-8, and contains ""The Making of Avatar - From Real Life to Animation"" featurette.  This featurette showed how the creators would demonstrate some of the actions they wanted the storyboard artists to draw for particular scenes.  It made for amusing viewing.Disc three contains episodes 9-12, as well as the ""Behind the Scenes - the Voices of Avatar"" featurette.  They talked to voice actors for Sokka, Zuko, and the one behind the animal sounds (the voice actor for Appa and Momo).  This was a decent featurette.Disc four includes episodes 13-16, as well as the ""Ask the Creators"" featurette and an original uncut animatic.  Overall, the ""Ask the Creators"" featurette was rather pointless.Disc five contains episodes 17-20, as well as audio commentary by the creators, cast and crew.  I was a little disapponted that the only special feature was audio commentaries.The bonus disc includes a Behind the Scenes with the Avatar Cast & Crew, the original unaired ""Avatar"" pilot episode with audio commentary, The Making of Avatar - Inside the Sound Studios, and The Making of Avatar - Inside the Korean Animation Studio.  The most interesting part of this disd was the original unaired pilot; however, the one drawback was that there was so much audio commentary going on that you could barely hear any dialogue in the episode (and there is not a way to view the pilot without the audio commentary).  The ""Inside the Korean Animation Studios"" portion was a bit of a tedious view, because of all the subtitles having to be used in it.Overall, though, I would recommend this set to fans of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender.""",4,All five discs of Book 1... and an exclusive bonus disc!,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,2047,"['DVD', 'set', 'five', 'individual', 'discs', 'released', 'Book', '1', 'as', 'well', 'exclusive', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'episode', 'discs', 'include', 'four', 'episodes', 'least', 'one', 'special', 'feature.Disc', 'one', 'episodes', '1-4', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'featurette', 'was', 'interesting', 'showed', 'what', 'different', 'kinds', 'martial', 'arts', 'were', 'used', 'inspire', 'bending', 'moves', 'four', 'elements.Disc', 'two', 'contains', '5-8', 'Making', 'Avatar', 'Real', 'Life', 'Animation', 'featurette', 'featurette', 'showed', 'how', 'creators', 'would', 'demonstrate', 'actions', 'wanted', 'storyboard', 'draw', 'particular', 'scenes', 'made', 'amusing', 'viewing.Disc', 'three', 'contains', '9-12', 'as', 'well', 'Scenes', 'Voices', 'Avatar', 'featurette', 'talked', 'voice', 'actors', 'Sokka', 'Zuko', 'one', 'animal', 'sounds', 'voice', 'actor', 'Appa', 'Momo', 'was', 'decent', 'featurette.Disc', 'four', 'episodes', '13-16', 'as', 'well', 'Ask', 'Creators', 'featurette', 'original', 'uncut', 'animatic', 'Overall', 'Ask', 'Creators', 'featurette', 'was', 'rather', 'pointless.Disc', 'five', 'contains', '17-20', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'commentary', 'creators', 'cast', 'crew', 'was', 'little', 'disapponted', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'was', 'audio', 'commentaries.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'Scenes', 'Avatar', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'original', 'unaired', 'Avatar', 'pilot', 'episode', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Making', 'Avatar', 'Sound', 'Studios', 'Making', 'Avatar', 'Korean', 'Animation', 'Studio', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'disd', 'was', 'original', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'however', 'one', 'drawback', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'audio', 'commentary', 'going', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'episode', 'not', 'way', 'view', 'pilot', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Korean', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'portion', 'was', 'bit', 'tedious', 'view', 'subtitles', 'having', 'be', 'used', 'it.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'fans', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender']",N/A

Here we have a 12 year old kid who must master all the &#34;bending&#34; elements in order to face the Fire Lord before the end of the summer when the comet returns - serious stuff, right?  Yet he and his two friends face their adversities with bravery and even lightheartedness.  One of his friends, the girl, Katara, is a water bender, so she, too, has magical powers, but her brother Sacha (spelled wrong - sorry!) is a mere mortal like the rest of us.

It also sports a rich cast of voice actors, vibrant colors, good quality animation, and has a well thought out plot line with a hint of teenage romance and humor to boot.  As the series progresses, the characters grow and provides a nice continuity and becomes very dramatic near the end.Fantasy cartoons like this work, as lot of innovation went into this show.  How the ""benders"" use their powers is also very interesting and worth seeing-including how the enemies fight.  Avatar The Last Airbender is targeted towards children, but the plot lines aren't dumbed down and it executes like a good book that can be enjoyed by adults as well.

Yes, there are overall themes of friendship, loyalty, good vs. evil, and teamwork that are pretty evident in any children's cartoon, but Avatar is a nice change in that it doesn't beat you over the head with those ideas (usually). The characters are diverse and well-developed - even the random extras, like Foaming Mouth Guy and Cabbage Man have their fans - and it's a perfect blend of action, humor, adventure, and (dare I say it) the beginnings of an epic romance.One warning though: make sure you have plenty of time when you start it.

A show that both kids and adults can enjoy, complete with tremendous voice acting, fantastic animation, good music, and awesome execution.Season One of Avatar begins with a war going on between nations who control different elements through techniques called 'bending'. There's the Fire Nation, which, under Fire Lord Ozai, is attempting to take over the rest of the world. The Avatar, the only one who can control all four elements, is supposed to stop power imbalances between the nations, but the war started 100 years ago and the Avatar hasn't been seen since. And with the airbenders already wiped out and the water tribes being composed of tiny populations, only the great Earth Kingdom remains intact.What makes this show great is a combination of character and plot. The characters aren't stereotypical. They act in predictable ways sometimes, but then there are episodes that really show their deeper sides (The Storm, The Fortune Teller, and The Blue Spirit are all examples of this.) The story focuses around the main characters Sokka, Katara, and Aang, the Avatar (returning to the world after being incased in an iceberg for 100 years.) There's also the Fire Nation's General Iroh, Price Zuko (a banished prince trying to regain his honor by capturing the Avatar) and Admiral Zhao. However out of these characters only Admiral Zhao seems truley evil. Zuko and Iroh however are in the gray.There's some fantastic fight scenes in this series. The Blue Spirit, Jet, and Bato of the Water Tribe are all episodes with incredible choreography. Animation is top notch. There was only one episode where it went down a little. And finally the Season Finale is really well done and filled with  mythology about the spirit world which the Avatar must learn to communicate, as well as he must learn to master the four elements to defeat the Fire Lord.As good as Season One is, it's inferior to Season 2.

To me the show just seemed soooo kiddie-looking. However, after doing some reseach and finding almost total critical praise and a huge fanbase encompessing boys girls, men and women, I thought I'd give it a try. Man, was I blown away. This is definitely a cartoon for the ages. While it is lighthearted, it also explores darker themes as the characters are slowly fleshed out. My wife and I, as well as my two daughters, were completely captivated. 5-stars without question.For the Collector's Edition, if you've already purchased the previously-released Book I collection, you DO NOT need this edition. I repeat, you DO NOT NEED this edition. Inside the fancy box is a DVD with a 20-minute documentary that explores the origins of this series with its creators. Not a bad documentary, but not worth throwing an extra $30 on the counter. Also included in the set is a small booklet that shows some earlier sketches as well as commentary from the two creators. Again, nice, but not worth a re-purchase. And last, the previously-released BOOK I collection is what you're actually getting inside this box. They just took the old edition (box and all), put it inside another box along with a documentary and booklet, stamped LIMITED COLLECTOR'S EDITION on the box, and then jacked the price up $10-$15 dollars.

996977,A2S24ARW626ZVU,B000FVQYYU,Stella Rosenfeld,"[23, 25]","Warner Brothers can take pride in ""Batman: the Animated Series"". Disney lays claim to the ""Gargoyles"" series. But ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" can be said as one of the most sophisticated animated shows that have ever been aired on Nickelodeon. Those that have been watching Nick for at least two decades will remember the fan-favorite Anime epic, ""The Mysterious Cities of Gold"". What MCOG was 20 years ago is what ""Avatar"" is today.Viewers may distinguish this show from a typical Anime that was created in Japan for Japanese viewers (and sometimes dubbed into English for American viewers). ""Avatar"" is NOT Anime--it was created by Nickelodeon and sent overseas to be animated in Korea. The show's general audience is pre-teen children but the stronger elements are drawn from a continuous epic storyline that stays consistent as well as very believable characters that the older viewers can relate to. From the magic of supernatural flight to the setting of an ancient land that blends Asian myth and folklore to the modernized battleships and tanks that adorn the power-driven Fire Nation (think Imperial Troopers from ""Star Wars"") the cultural awareness and depth to a children's cartoon is surprisingly well researched.The story begins in a world of coexisting nations based on the four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. The term ""bender"" refers to someone who can master a particular element of his or her culture e.g. firebenders, earthbenders, and so on. The Avatar is one chosen person in every generation who possesses the power to master all four elements. It is his or her duty to keep peace and balance in the world. When that person dies, the Avatar is reincarnated into the next life cycle of a different person.The mysterious disappearance of the Avatar, along with a 100-year war with the Fire Nation, has lead many to believe that hope is lost. But two children from the Southern Water Tribe, brave and loving Katara and her sarcastic but practical brother Sokka, discover the new Avatar frozen within an iceberg.  When Aang awakens from his hibernation he discovers that the Fire Nation annihilated all the other airbenders years ago, leaving him the only survivor of his kind. Though Aang is chronologically 112 years old, biologically he's 12.Aang is a good-natured boy and though he's slightly mischief, he willingly accepts his role as the Avatar and the tremendous responsibility he must undertake.  He's unselfish, loyal, and willing to do anything for his friends. Aang must study and master all four elements by the end of the summer or else the Fire Nation will be too powerful to stop and Armageddon will occur.Aang's primary adversary in the first season is Prince Zuko, an exiled member of the Fire Nation who has been given strict orders to capture the Avatar. While Zuko's hard driven obsessive nature makes him a hostile threat to Aang and his friends, his personal struggles depict him more as an anti-hero than a villain. Viewers discover that Zuko's distinguished facial scar was a sign of punishment from his father for refusing to fight him in a duel. He has been banished from his home and considered a disgrace to the entire Fire Nation for showing ""weakness"". Only by capturing the Avatar can his honor be restored. Despite his arrogance and short temper, Zuko is deeply loyal to those close to him such as his uncle, General Iroh.In contrast to his nephew, Iroh is a good-humored man who enjoys music, drinking tea, and playing Pai Sho. Iroh's carefree attitude barely masks his true identity as a shrewd strategist and master firebender. He considers Zuko like his own son and is constantly by his side, offering words of consolation and wisdom to the agitated prince.The show's plots often involve social issues that are relevant even today. There's nothing to tone down the grimness of life after Sokka and Katara constantly mention how the Fire Nation killed their mother. The show accepts death as a natural part of the life cycle; something I'd only see handled this well in a Miyazaki film until now. Despite this loss, the siblings are strong and courageous kids who stick with Aang throughout their adventures.Katara and Sokka aren't the only ones with challenges. Zuko suffers abuse and shame from his father, Aang must find a surrogate family after his own is destroyed, and Katara struggles with a sexist society that bars women from learning the art of waterbending. These obstacles are smaller ones that occur during first season although the larger challenge is to get Aang to the North Pole where he may find a waterbending master to teach him. Along the way they encounter various obstacles including hazardous weather, threatening armies, supernatural spirits, and the power-hungry Admiral Zhao who also wants the Avatar but with less noble intentions and methods than Zuko.As others have said, the price for this is a bit steep but it is certainly worth it. There are plenty of extras to watch on the making of Avatar. I found the origins of the bending styles very intriguing. After leading the viewers on a fascinating quest around the world, the season finale pits the ruthless Fire Nation against the Northern Water Tribe in a fight that can only rival that of the battles in ""The Lord of the Rings"". The choreography, all based on various forms of Chinese martial arts, is dazzling to watch while the excitement is heightened as the ruthless Zhao seeks to uproot the balance of life itself. There is little that can be expected as surprises turn around every corner. Can Aang protect the Water Tribe or will the balance be destroyed along with the Avatar for good? By the end of the first season, you'll be in tears, cheering with delight, hankering for more good storylines, or all of the above.Spoiler warning: Season two will turn certain events around as Aang and his friends get a new member of the team. Toph is a small feisty girl who, despite a particular handicap, is a master earthbender.  Zuko's menacing sister Azula brands him and his uncle as traitors so the former prince-turned-refugee is forced to go on a spiritual journey, seeking his own destiny and questioning his personal values. Though Azula and her cronies are a deadly threat, she's the least of Aang's problems and we discover that there are other scheming forces besides the Fire Nation. The tension and thrill only accelerate as the series progresses and as an avid viewer, I'm looking forward to every new episode.",5,Epic Well Researched Animated Nick Show,1162512000,"11 3,

Mahler,"[3, 4]","I've written a post or two about some of the DVD sets that came out for the show and figured I'd write something up for this particular set.  I am a huge fan of the Avatar series.  It is probably one of the few shows that is truely original for Nick studios and I'm glad to see that there is something more than just a talking sponge (I don't care.....Ren and Stimpy still rocks over Spongebob).It is a kid's show....but adults and anime fans will love this.  It is like taking the old Kung Fu movies and even a few modern films (like House of a 1000 Daggers and even Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), cult anime classics, Star Wars, and even a few of the Abbot and Costello buddy/buddy films and rolling them into a unique package.  The characters are amazing,....each with their own traits that you can follow.  They may be kids, but there is a certain level of wisdom and maturity about them,....even the character Sokka.  The fight sequences and choreography is wonderful.  It's like having the old kung fu movies without it being corny or too over the top.  The is a sense of depth to the storylines.....something of which you won't find on a lot of the shows on Nick where it is kid oriented.There are many good shows out there....and this one does stand out as one of those ""diamonds in the rough"".  I just hope that the other stories that are coming along (already saw the 2 mini movies and the new season premier where our travelers reach the city of Ba Sing Se) and so far I feel that the storylines will become a little more deeper and there will be some plot twists that even the most loyal fans will not expect.",5,A genuine gem,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,1622,"[""'ve"", 'written', 'post', 'two', 'DVD', 'sets', 'came', 'out', 'show', 'figured', ""'d"", 'write', 'something', 'up', 'particular', 'set', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Avatar', 'series', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'truely', 'original', 'Nick', 'studios', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'talking', 'sponge', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', '..Ren', 'Stimpy', 'still', 'Spongebob', '.It', 'kid', 'show', '.but', 'adults', 'anime', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'taking', 'old', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', 'even', 'few', 'modern', 'films', 'House', '1000', 'Daggers', 'even', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'cult', 'anime', 'classics', 'Star', 'Wars', 'even', 'few', 'Abbot', 'Costello', 'buddy/buddy', 'films', 'rolling', 'unique', 'package', 'characters', 'are', 'amazing', '.each', 'own', 'traits', 'can', 'follow', 'may', 'be', 'kids', 'certain', 'level', 'wisdom', 'maturity', '.even', 'character', 'Sokka', 'fight', 'sequences', 'choreography', 'wonderful', 'having', 'old', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'being', 'corny', 'too', 'top', 'sense', 'depth', 'storylines', '..something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'lot', 'shows', 'Nick', 'where', 'kid', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'shows', 'out', 'there', '.and', 'one', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'diamonds', 'rough', 'just', 'hope', 'other', 'stories', 'are', 'coming', 'along', 'already', 'saw', '2', 'mini', 'movies', 'new', 'season', 'premier', 'where', 'travelers', 'reach', 'city', 'Ba', 'Sing', 'Se', 'so', 'far', 'feel', 'storylines', 'will', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'deeper', 'will', 'be', 'plot', 'twists', 'even', 'most', 'loyal', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'expect']",N/A

I love that it's about people who want to do good and are doing their best, and grow from immaturity to power well-used.  I love that everyone has an opportunity to contribute good in this world - even the ones without special powers - and that the elderly are important and have needed wisdom.  I love its underlying sense of innocence.Season one isn't my favorite, but it's a great place to start.  Some of the plot twists are foreseeable, and the writers are still figuring out the characters and their world.

996982,A39UB5ADPED1YJ,B000FVQYYU,Timothy Agraw,"[2, 2]","Avatar tells the story of four nations: fire, water, earth, and air.  The Avatar is master of all four elements and is reincarnated through the generations in order to bring peace and balance to the world.  Aang, the newest Avatar, was trapped in an iceberg 100 years ago, and in those 100 years, things got a little screwy.  The Fire Nation became conquerers, the Air Nation died out, and the Water Triber and Earth Kindom are all that's preventing the Fire Nation from toatal domination.  But I'm sure by now you already knew that from reading other reviews.The genius behind Avatar is the fact that it really tells a story and is not just some meaningless babble of episodes like SpongeBob SquarePants or whatever it is.  Each episode can stand alone and be watched individually, but the viewer gets a richer experience from watching the entire thing through.  By the end of Book 1, I was recognizing characters from previous chapters and what they had done, as well as items and actions.  ""Uncle, for the last time, I'm not going to play the sungi horn.""  I actually know what a sungi horn is now.  Also Friday nights are music nights on the Zuko's ship.Top 10 reasons to buy:1. Plot2. Character Depth3. Excellent action sequences4. Comedy (throws in a joke here and there)5. Good animation (the first few episodes look a little sloppy comparitively)6. Excellent art7. Good writing8. Romance (a little here, a little there)9. Um... action sequences?10. Much less expensive overall than those individual DVD's.I'm not much of a bonus features guy, but there is an additional 6th DVD for those too.Incedentally, I move that we boycott individual DVDs and just make them have these Book collections.I admit the commercials in the beginning are extremely annoying, but are easily avioded simply by flipping through them as if they were chapters on a normal DVD.",5,The best of American writing with the best of Anime animation,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1861,"['Avatar', 'story', 'four', 'nations', 'fire', 'water', 'earth', 'air', 'Avatar', 'master', 'four', 'elements', 'reincarnated', 'generations', 'order', 'bring', 'peace', 'balance', 'world', 'Aang', 'newest', 'Avatar', 'was', 'trapped', 'iceberg', '100', 'years', 'ago', '100', 'years', 'things', 'got', 'little', 'screwy', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'became', 'conquerers', 'Air', 'Nation', 'died', 'out', 'Water', 'Triber', 'Earth', 'Kindom', 'are', 'preventing', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'toatal', 'domination', ""'m"", 'sure', 'now', 'already', 'knew', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews.The', 'genius', 'Avatar', 'fact', 'really', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'meaningless', 'babble', 'episodes', 'SpongeBob', 'SquarePants', 'whatever', 'episode', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'be', 'watched', 'individually', 'viewer', 'richer', 'experience', 'watching', 'entire', 'thing', 'end', 'Book', '1', 'was', 'recognizing', 'characters', 'previous', 'chapters', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'items', 'actions', 'Uncle', 'last', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'play', 'sungi', 'horn', 'actually', 'know', 'what', 'sungi', 'horn', 'now', 'Also', 'Friday', 'nights', 'are', 'music', 'nights', 'Zuko', 'ship.Top', '10', 'reasons', 'buy:1', 'Plot2', 'Character', 'Depth3', 'Excellent', 'action', 'sequences4', 'Comedy', 'throws', 'joke', 'here', 'there', '5', 'Good', 'animation', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'look', 'little', 'sloppy', 'comparitively', '6', 'Excellent', 'art7', 'Good', 'writing8', 'Romance', 'little', 'here', 'little', '9', 'Um', 'action', 'sequences', '10', 'Much', 'less', 'expensive', 'overall', 'individual', ""DVD's.I"", ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'bonus', 'guy', 'additional', '6th', 'DVD', 'too.Incedentally', 'move', 'boycott', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'just', 'make', 'have', 'Book', 'collections.I', 'admit', 'commercials', 'beginning', 'are', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'are', 'easily', 'avioded', 'simply', 'flipping', 'through', 'were', 'chapters', 'normal', 'DVD']",N/A
