Notice how smooth she appears and how graceful she is as she performs.  SMOOTH as fine chocolates and wine!  Sass' vocal range is well over the five octaves found on a 88-key piano!  What a fine singer Sarah (Sass) Lois Vaughan was.  Sass will always be my idol and mentor forever in spirit; she is well missed.

I have two copies on VHS and one on DVD.  If I have to fault this video, it is that the live performance clips are far too short, leaving you wanting more.  They offer nothing more than a tantalizing glimpse of Sarah Vaughan's musical genius.By far my most favourite excerpt is ""The Shadow of Your Smile"".  This live performance outdoes any other recording I have ever heard by another artist and even outdoes Sarah Vaughan's studio recording with Mercury Records.  I wish I could obtain the complete performance of this live rendition.It sounds trite I know, but this is a must have for any self-respecting Sarah Vaughan fan.",5,The Divine One - says it all,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,711,"['have', 'loved', 'video-biography', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'day', 'first', 'viewed', 'have', 'two', 'copies', 'VHS', 'one', 'DVD', 'have', 'fault', 'video', 'live', 'performance', 'clips', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'offer', 'nothing', 'more', 'tantalizing', 'glimpse', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'musical', 'genius.By', 'far', 'most', 'favourite', 'excerpt', 'Shadow', 'Your', 'Smile', 'live', 'performance', 'outdoes', 'other', 'recording', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'artist', 'even', 'outdoes', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'studio', 'recording', 'Mercury', 'Records', 'wish', 'could', 'obtain', 'complete', 'performance', 'live', 'rendition.It', 'trite', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'self-respecting', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'fan']",N/A

She told the story of how she met Sarah before a show and didn't realize it was her because everyone kept calling her &quot;Sassy&quot;.  After leaving that incredible performance I became even more curious about &quot;Sass&quot; and her legacy.I enjoyed this video tremendously. Like the previous reviews stated, it is filled with performances from her early years to later.  Other greats of jazz and close friends (Joe Williams, Billy Eckstein, fellow musicians, etc) speak candidly about her as a friend and artist. Her mother and daughter also give insight to her life (her self-image woes) as well as refreshing antecdotes (the apollo experience and her &quot;sailor's tongue&quot;)The performances are breathtaking.  Sarah Vaughan didn't just sing.  She SANG.  Her voice was an instrument and it is truly amazing to listen to her on songs like &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Misty&quot; and &quot;Send In the Clowns&quot; She had style, grace and a presence all her own.  Sarah Vaughan commanded attention and mesmorized audiences in every performance.I recommend this video for anyone who wants to learn about one of the greats of music.  Sarah Vaughan: The Divine One is a wonderous glimpse into the life of a jazz jewel, whose music still sparkles.Peace.

346561,A3K51Z8GYTWAEE,6302932874,"Danniray99 ""Danniray""","[0, 0]","This DVD of Sarah Vaughan provides a good overview of ""The Divine One's"" life and music.  To be honest, it does leave you wishing it were longer, but there are some impressive clips of her in concert (including some rare 70's footage of her brilliantly accompanying herself at the piano as a guest of Dick Cavett).  With a voice that approached operatic proportions, Sarah Vaughan lived with as much gusto as she sang.  It is also interesting to see how much Sarah Vaughan's life and music compares and contrasts with that of her contemporary, Ella Fitzgerald, who was the only other jazz singer of the same era who possessed as great a musical gift.  Amazingly, Vaughan ate copiously, drank, smoked, partied hard--activities that would normally kill a voice well before its time. Yet she STILL retained her magnificent instrument!  If anything, I swear she got better with age--I caught one the last performances before her death in New York City at the infamous Blue Note!This bio also features the requisite interviews with friends, musical peers and family (her mother and only child, her daughter Paris, are also notably featured). While ""The Divine One"" clearly leaves you wanting more, it is still a great collector's item--a bird's eye view of one of the two greatest jazz singers--the other of course being Ella Fitzgerald--of the 20th century.",4,Sassy. . . .,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,1353,"['DVD', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'good', 'overview', 'Divine', 'One', 'life', 'music', 'be', 'honest', 'leave', 'wishing', 'were', 'longer', 'are', 'impressive', 'clips', 'concert', 'including', 'rare', '70', 'footage', 'brilliantly', 'accompanying', 'piano', 'guest', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'voice', 'approached', 'operatic', 'proportions', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'lived', 'as', 'much', 'gusto', 'sang', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'life', 'music', 'compares', 'contrasts', 'contemporary', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'other', 'jazz', 'singer', 'same', 'era', 'who', 'possessed', 'great', 'musical', 'gift', 'Amazingly', 'Vaughan', 'ate', 'copiously', 'drank', 'smoked', 'partied', 'hard', 'activities', 'would', 'normally', 'kill', 'voice', 'well', 'time', 'STILL', 'retained', 'magnificent', 'instrument', 'anything', 'swear', 'got', 'better', 'age', 'caught', 'one', 'last', 'performances', 'death', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'infamous', 'Blue', 'Note', 'bio', 'also', 'requisite', 'interviews', 'friends', 'musical', 'peers', 'family', 'mother', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'Paris', 'are', 'also', 'notably', 'featured', 'Divine', 'One', 'clearly', 'wanting', 'more', 'still', 'great', 'collector', 'item', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'one', 'two', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'singers', 'other', 'course', 'being', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', '20th', 'century']",N/A

Davis,"[11, 14]","For me, after Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington comes Sarah Vaughan, and this testament to her life and career reveals the sassy power she wielded as a performer and as a human being.  Highlights include clips from  some of her  interviews (such as with Dick Cavett), and from some of her  live performances--we see her sing &quot;Misty,&quot; &quot;After You've  Gone,&quot; and &quot;Send in the Clowns.&quot;  More tracks from her  sprawling career, however, would have made this production more palpable.  At the end of the video, we still feel that there is much left unsaid and  untouched about this talented jazz performer.  From the sound clips we're  given, we don't have much of a sense of Vaughan's vocal range.  We need to  hear tracks from the &quot;Live From Mr. Kelly's&quot; album; from the  superb Copenhagen concert at the Tivoli Gardens in 1963; and from her  marvelous work with Count Basie and Ben Webster.  There are revealing  intimate moments with Vaughan's daughter, Paris (who, with bitterness, it  seems, shares with us about her mother's doubts and fears as a performer),  and with Vaughan's mother (who humorously unfolds the story of Vaughan's  winning the amateur contest at the Apollo Theatre as a teen); as well, we  learn the most from Vaughan's musical colleagues, Joe Williams and Roy  Haynes, among others (we learn that Sassy could swear like a sailor and  loved to drink).  This video construction of Vaughan's life, while good, is  not excellent.  We needed more of Sass's sass.  But overall, it is an  adequate introduction to a great jazz songstress.",4,LET'S START IT OFF CLASSY!

Brierly,"[4, 4]","Here's another installment of the ""Masters of American Music"" television series--this one devoted to the late singer Sarah Vaughn--newly remastered on DVD by Euroarts. The 56-minute documentary traces Vaughn's beginnings as a teenage singer, her auspicious debut at Harlem's Apollo Theater, her tenure in bands led by Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine, and her long and highly successful solo career. Lots of vintage concert footage, including rare performances from the 1950s, are interspersed with heartfelt, revealing interviews with Eckstine, drummer Roy Haynes, arranger Marty Paich, pianist George Gaffney, Vaughn's mother and daughter, and Sarah herself. It's a fast-moving and frequently fascinating document marred only by its brevity--it's far too short to do more than trace the outlines of her unparalleled career and striking personality.

346565,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,6302932874,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[0, 0]","I purchased my copy of this DVD as a part of a 5-DVD set titledMasters of American Music(which I highly recommend.)In the set this was one of two videos that I most enjoyed and from which I received the most information. In fact, I would place the informational content of this DVD on par withSassy: The Life Of Sarah Vaughan, which is high praise when a biopic favorably compares to a book.Among the highlights of the video are the commentaries from friends, family and associates. Making them all the more valuable is the fact that everyone was candid and did not gloss over her shortcomings (nor were those shortcomings dwelt upon either.) The narrative was also informative and delivered matter-of-factly, lending even more credibility to the biography.Among those providing first hand accounts were her daughter, Billy Eckstine (whose association goes back to the days when he discovered and groomed her), and a parade of musicians who had the pleasure of backing her. The latter group is the most telling because there has always been an invisible, but very tangible, divide between most musicians and vocalists. That divide did not exist for Sarah because she was a musician in her own right (accomplished organist and pianist), and she was well versed in music theory. However, that gained her not only the inclusion, but admiration of her fellow musicians is how she used her voice in the same manner as a physical instrument. To the credit of the producers, writers and film makers, this was not only included, but clearly articulated.Sarah was a private person who was also a contradiction - a rough, hard drinking and swearing character who exhibited the refinement of a classical diva on stage - that defied description. This movie managed to portray her is relatively broad strokes, in all of her complex splendor, while still maintaining boundaries of privacy and dignity. Most importantly, this video exposes who Sarah was and why she mattered to viewers who may have never given her much thought. And the tragedy is she was always eclipsed in the popular mind by Billie and Ella. Perhaps this video will rectify that.Even more about Sarah (however brief) is contained inJazz : A Film By Ken Burns, which I highly recommend. While there is some overlap between that set and this DVD, you are treated to some new information and also how The Divine One fit into the larger body of jazz.",5,Insightful and frank,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2401,"['purchased', 'copy', 'DVD', 'part', '5-DVD', 'set', 'titledMasters', 'American', 'Music', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'videos', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'received', 'most', 'information', 'fact', 'would', 'place', 'informational', 'content', 'DVD', 'par', 'withSassy', 'Life', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'high', 'praise', 'when', 'biopic', 'favorably', 'book.Among', 'highlights', 'video', 'are', 'commentaries', 'friends', 'family', 'associates', 'Making', 'more', 'valuable', 'fact', 'everyone', 'was', 'candid', 'did', 'not', 'gloss', 'shortcomings', 'were', 'shortcomings', 'dwelt', 'narrative', 'was', 'also', 'informative', 'delivered', 'matter-of-factly', 'lending', 'even', 'more', 'credibility', 'biography.Among', 'providing', 'first', 'hand', 'accounts', 'were', 'daughter', 'Billy', 'Eckstine', 'association', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'discovered', 'groomed', 'parade', 'musicians', 'who', 'had', 'pleasure', 'backing', 'latter', 'group', 'most', 'telling', 'always', 'been', 'invisible', 'very', 'tangible', 'divide', 'most', 'musicians', 'vocalists', 'divide', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Sarah', 'was', 'musician', 'own', 'right', 'accomplished', 'organist', 'pianist', 'was', 'well', 'versed', 'music', 'theory', 'However', 'gained', 'not', 'only', 'inclusion', 'admiration', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'how', 'used', 'voice', 'same', 'manner', 'physical', 'instrument', 'credit', 'producers', 'writers', 'film', 'makers', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'included', 'clearly', 'articulated.Sarah', 'was', 'private', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'contradiction', 'rough', 'hard', 'drinking', 'swearing', 'character', 'who', 'exhibited', 'refinement', 'classical', 'diva', 'stage', 'defied', 'description', 'movie', 'managed', 'portray', 'relatively', 'broad', 'strokes', 'complex', 'splendor', 'still', 'maintaining', 'boundaries', 'privacy', 'dignity', 'Most', 'importantly', 'video', 'who', 'Sarah', 'was', 'why', 'mattered', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'thought', 'tragedy', 'was', 'always', 'eclipsed', 'popular', 'mind', 'Billie', 'Ella', 'Perhaps', 'video', 'will', 'rectify', 'that.Even', 'more', 'Sarah', 'however', 'brief', 'contained', 'inJazz', 'Film', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'highly', 'recommend', 'overlap', 'set', 'DVD', 'are', 'treated', 'new', 'information', 'also', 'how', 'Divine', 'One', 'fit', 'larger', 'body', 'jazz']",N/A
