1166179,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001AK3S4E,Mark Turner,"[8, 9]","I've been stunned by the career of Wesley Snipes. Forget the whole IRS issue from this past year. It has nothing to do with his acting ability or star power. But for someone to rise from bit parts to starring roles and then suddenly find himself in direct to video films, one has to question...what happened? Especially when he turns in a decent movie like THE ART OF WAR II: BETRAYAL.Snipes returns as agent Neil Shaw, having gone underground at the end of the first film. Shaw receives word that his mentor and martial arts instructor, Mother, has passed away. At the funeral service, Shaw and the rest of those gathered meet the daughter no one knew Mother had.  Heather (Athena Karkanis) talks with Shaw, blaming him for Mother's death only to change her mind later.From there, Shaw goes to work as a consultant on a movie set where he has become friends with the star, Garrett (Lochlyn Munro). Invited to his boat, Shaw learns that Garrett is about to run for the Senate. It is then that he asks for Shaw's help with an apparent blackmailer. But as with all good spy/thriller films, nothing is what it seems.As Shaw begins to dig into the possibilities, he also comes into contact with a Senator Carlson (Rachel Hayward), running once more for office and under observation by Shaw's old nemesis, Becker (Eric Brecker). It seems that there is an assassination attempt in store for the Senator and Shaw is on the case, unofficially of course, searching for not only the killer but the person behind the sanction.Following up on leads, Shaw shows at a political cocktail party to question another Senator. Unfortunately for Shaw, the Senator has been murdered and he has been set up to take the fall. Downloading material from the Senator's computer, he escapes and heads out to get the help of a computer whiz kid friend to find out just what he's come across.The information provided puts Shaw back in harms way as well as his friends. While Shaw continues to search for the person who set him up for murder, Becker and his crew begin searching for Shaw through his friends beginning with Heather. On the lam with Heather in tow, Shaw cautiously puts together the pieces, linking the Senators to an arms developer named Sallas (Michael Phenicie). The question remains, who is behind Sallas?While the movie at first seems to wind around different roads in search of something to pull them together, in the end it all becomes clear. The leads that Shaw finds make sense and come closer together with each new clue. What appears to be at first confusing makes perfect sense by films end.Action is what Snipes career is all about since he starred in PASSENGER 57 and the BLADE films. And those looking for the typical Snipes action are in for a treat. The fight sequences seen here are not only well put together but filmed to advantage as well. The entire look of the film is top notch.It's been 8 years since Snipes played the character of Neil Shaw. His abilities have not dwindled in that time. This takes us back to the initial question I had. What happened to Snipes career? Why has he gone from top billing on the big screen to direct to DVD features that show he is as competent as always? Perhaps only those in power in Hollywood have the answer. In the meantime, we can still enjoy the product Snipes offers, delivering the goods with each outing.",4,TSU & SNIPES TOGETHER AGAIN,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,3357,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'stunned', 'career', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Forget', 'whole', 'IRS', 'issue', 'past', 'year', 'nothing', 'do', 'acting', 'ability', 'star', 'power', 'someone', 'rise', 'bit', 'parts', 'starring', 'roles', 'then', 'suddenly', 'find', 'direct', 'video', 'films', 'one', 'question', 'what', 'happened', 'Especially', 'when', 'decent', 'movie', 'THE', 'ART', 'OF', 'WAR', 'II', 'BETRAYAL.Snipes', 'agent', 'Neil', 'Shaw', 'having', 'gone', 'underground', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'Shaw', 'word', 'mentor', 'martial', 'arts', 'instructor', 'Mother', 'passed', 'away', 'funeral', 'service', 'Shaw', 'rest', 'gathered', 'meet', 'daughter', 'one', 'knew', 'Mother', 'had', 'Heather', 'Athena', 'Karkanis', 'talks', 'Shaw', 'blaming', 'Mother', 'death', 'only', 'change', 'mind', 'later.From', 'there', 'Shaw', 'work', 'consultant', 'movie', 'set', 'where', 'become', 'friends', 'star', 'Garrett', 'Lochlyn', 'Munro', 'Invited', 'boat', 'Shaw', 'Garrett', 'run', 'Senate', 'then', 'Shaw', 'help', 'apparent', 'blackmailer', 'good', 'spy/thriller', 'films', 'nothing', 'what', 'seems.As', 'Shaw', 'dig', 'possibilities', 'also', 'contact', 'Senator', 'Carlson', 'Rachel', 'Hayward', 'running', 'once', 'more', 'office', 'observation', 'Shaw', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Becker', 'Eric', 'Brecker', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'store', 'Senator', 'Shaw', 'case', 'unofficially', 'course', 'searching', 'not', 'only', 'killer', 'person', 'sanction.Following', 'up', 'leads', 'Shaw', 'political', 'cocktail', 'party', 'question', 'Senator', 'Unfortunately', 'Shaw', 'Senator', 'been', 'murdered', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'fall', 'Downloading', 'material', 'Senator', 'computer', 'out', 'get', 'help', 'computer', 'whiz', 'kid', 'friend', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'come', 'across.The', 'information', 'provided', 'Shaw', 'back', 'harms', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'Shaw', 'search', 'person', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'murder', 'Becker', 'crew', 'begin', 'searching', 'Shaw', 'friends', 'beginning', 'Heather', 'lam', 'Heather', 'tow', 'Shaw', 'cautiously', 'together', 'pieces', 'linking', 'Senators', 'arms', 'developer', 'named', 'Sallas', 'Michael', 'Phenicie', 'question', 'who', 'Sallas', 'movie', 'first', 'wind', 'around', 'different', 'roads', 'search', 'something', 'pull', 'together', 'end', 'clear', 'leads', 'Shaw', 'make', 'sense', 'come', 'closer', 'together', 'new', 'clue', 'What', 'be', 'first', 'confusing', 'perfect', 'sense', 'films', 'end.Action', 'what', 'Snipes', 'career', 'starred', 'PASSENGER', '57', 'BLADE', 'films', 'looking', 'typical', 'Snipes', 'action', 'are', 'treat', 'fight', 'sequences', 'seen', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'filmed', 'advantage', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'look', 'film', 'top', 'notch.It', 'been', '8', 'years', 'Snipes', 'played', 'character', 'Neil', 'Shaw', 'abilities', 'have', 'not', 'dwindled', 'time', 'back', 'initial', 'question', 'had', 'What', 'happened', 'Snipes', 'career', 'Why', 'gone', 'top', 'billing', 'big', 'screen', 'direct', 'DVD', 'features', 'show', 'as', 'competent', 'always', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'power', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'answer', 'meantime', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'product', 'Snipes', 'delivering', 'goods', 'outing']",The Art of War II:Betrayal
1166180,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B001AK3S4E,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","Wesley Snipes has always been a main-eventer in my book regardless of his ranking in Hollywood, so it's nice that even in the middle of his DTV doldrums he's been able to produce a respectable action movie like this. I've never seen the originalArt of Warbut the sequel here seems to stand well enough on its own. The movie's insistence on a plotline that may or may not intrigue eventually keeps it from a higher rating, but compared to the other fare that Snipes appeared in during this part of his career, it's decidedly superior.The story: upon being called out retirement at the death of his sensei, agent Neil Shaw (Snipes) finds himself in the midst of a plot to assassinate several government officials with himself framed for one of them.The movie's directed byThe Thirteenth Floor's Josef Rusnak, and while he couldn't keep a handful of minor DTV-isms out of the studio's final cut of the movie (e.g. flashbacks, unnecessary slow motion), its overall quality is superior, making it appear like more than a low-budget production more often than not. The film's too full of its own story, however: writerJason Bourquehas penned some noteworthy stuff, but he devoted too much time here to characters walking/sitting around and talking about who did what and why; these lengthy exchanges should definitely have been briefer. It gets boring to the point that I didn't even remember the names of supporting characters played by Lochlyn Munro (White Chicks) and Athena Karkanis (Saw IV) until I looked them up for this review.I doubt that Wesley Snipes will ever top his martial arts offerings from theBlademovies, but he does pretty good here - at least better than the majority of his other stuff I've seen. Four fight scenes are of generally decent quality, occasionally peaking as downright satisfying for their length and technical quality. They're still mucked about with post-production editing and occasional close-ups, but - miracle of miracles - the DVD features alternative cuts of most of the fights (even one exchange that I don't really consider a fight), the majority of which improve upon the ones that made it into the movie. There's a bit of gunfighting, including a scene with an explosive missile gun, but when the movie isn't focusing on being a thriller, its action is almost entirely karate-based.It's noteworthy that this is virtually the only film from this stage of Snipes' career that received any kind of official critical acclaim (a Leo Award nomination for the musical score), but I think that for most folks this one will fail to stand out in the video market. Nevertheless, fans of the man who've drifted from him following his general departure from Hollywood ought to take notice. I think that Wesley can do better, even on the DTV market, but this one's a pretty good standard to work off of.

The star, a popular action movie performer, is also contemplating a run at political office. This coincides with the death of Shaw's martial arts instructor, whose death also reveals a long-estranged daughter.The film goes on from there, and while the martial arts action is very well done, that's the only acceptable thing about the movie.
