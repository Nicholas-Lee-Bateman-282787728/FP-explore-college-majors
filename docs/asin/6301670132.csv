Then I lend it to them and and they are simply speechless! Sayonara is a film that made such a strong impression on me the first time I saw it some 15 years ago, that I never forgot it and till this day I can recall the dialogue, scenery, and characters like it was yesterday. This film has always been a favorite of mine. I have a soft spot for a well made epic love story and the plot of a G.I. in a foregin land falling for a mysterious and beautiful woman. Then the realization of both  characters knowing that their love may not be possible and may cause nothing but anguish and harm is simply amazing and heart felt! This film is up there with the &quot;Love Is A Many Splendored Thing&quot; (AND THAT MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!) as a total tear jerker. The scene where brando must follow Japanese custom and remove his shoes in his lovers house for the first time is just an all around exhale of human emotion. I cry till this day and can't wait to cry over the film in a more clearer transfer of the characters facial expressions of their emotions on screen-a CLASSIC!",5,An under seen masterpiece!,994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,1196,"['When', 'mention', 'film', 'Sayaonara', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'flick', 'first', 'thing', 'say', 'quot', 'never', 'heard', 'quot', 'Then', 'lend', 'are', 'simply', 'speechless', 'Sayonara', 'film', 'made', 'strong', 'impression', 'first', 'time', 'saw', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'forgot', 'till', 'day', 'can', 'recall', 'dialogue', 'scenery', 'characters', 'was', 'yesterday', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'well', 'made', 'epic', 'love', 'story', 'plot', 'G.I', 'foregin', 'land', 'falling', 'mysterious', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Then', 'realization', 'characters', 'knowing', 'love', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'may', 'cause', 'nothing', 'anguish', 'harm', 'simply', 'amazing', 'heart', 'felt', 'film', 'there', 'quot', 'Love', 'A', 'Many', 'Splendored', 'Thing', 'quot', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'AMAZING', 'total', 'tear', 'jerker', 'scene', 'where', 'brando', 'must', 'follow', 'Japanese', 'custom', 'remove', 'shoes', 'lovers', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'exhale', 'human', 'emotion', 'cry', 'till', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'cry', 'film', 'more', 'clearer', 'transfer', 'characters', 'facial', 'expressions', 'emotions', 'screen-a', 'CLASSIC']",N/A
261483,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301670132,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","It really isn't worth denying that Marlon Brando was one of the greatest actors of, not just his generation but really ANY generation.  He just had such natural flow to his rugged progression of character.  He understood who to disappear into a role and `become' whoever he was portraying.  Even his lesser works were still monumental achievements when compared to other actors of the time.`Sayonara' is one of those lesser works by him, but like I said, this is still no small feat.The film as a whole discusses the racial prejudice that dwelled in Japan during the Korean War.  Brando plays a fighter pilot promised to a general's daughter who happens to meet and fall for a Japanese entertainer.  His buddy, a fellow pilot, also falls for a Japanese woman and actually marries her, which causes immense trouble for him and his wife.  Trouble follows Brando's character, Gruver, as he builds his relationship with the beautiful Hana-Ogi.  He's hesitant and yet he is discover something about himself he wasn't aware of before; happiness.As a romantic drama, `Sayonara' doesn't always work.  Brando and especially Hana-Ogi are very good (she deserved that Oscar nomination, not Miyoshi Umeki) but their `star crossed lovers' build up doesn't always have the impact desired.  More attention is shifted towards the sub-plot concerning Gruver's friend Joe and his Japanese bride.  Those are the moments where the film actually takes root in something strong.  The way with which racism and political controversy is handled is very well, especially for a film of the 50's.  It is daring, but in a more conservative and commercial way.  Some balk at that, possibly considering the treatment soft, but I actually admire the way that it can be sewn in a way that is impactful yet palatable way.  Joe and Katsumi's final scene is devastatingly sincere.The film's finale does feel a little forced or faked or not really in tone with the film as a whole.  I just didn't buy it nor did I respond to it like they obviously wanted me to.  That said, there is a lot to admire here.  The sets and costumes are beautiful, the acting is really good on almost all fronts and the detail in certain areas is poignant, even today.",4,A diamond in the rough...,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,2210,"['really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'denying', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'not', 'just', 'generation', 'really', 'ANY', 'generation', 'just', 'had', 'such', 'natural', 'flow', 'rugged', 'progression', 'character', 'understood', 'who', 'disappear', 'role', 'become', 'was', 'portraying', 'Even', 'lesser', 'works', 'were', 'still', 'monumental', 'achievements', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'actors', 'time.', 'Sayonara', 'one', 'lesser', 'works', 'said', 'still', 'small', 'feat.The', 'film', 'whole', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'dwelled', 'Japan', 'Korean', 'War', 'Brando', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'promised', 'general', 'daughter', 'who', 'meet', 'fall', 'Japanese', 'entertainer', 'buddy', 'fellow', 'pilot', 'also', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'actually', 'immense', 'trouble', 'wife', 'Trouble', 'Brando', 'character', 'Gruver', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'Hana-Ogi', 'hesitant', 'yet', 'discover', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'before', 'happiness.As', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Sayonara', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'Brando', 'especially', 'Hana-Ogi', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'not', 'Miyoshi', 'Umeki', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'build', 'up', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'impact', 'desired', 'More', 'attention', 'shifted', 'sub-plot', 'concerning', 'Gruver', 'friend', 'Joe', 'Japanese', 'bride', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'actually', 'root', 'something', 'strong', 'way', 'racism', 'political', 'controversy', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'film', '50', 'daring', 'more', 'conservative', 'commercial', 'way', 'balk', 'possibly', 'considering', 'treatment', 'soft', 'actually', 'admire', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'sewn', 'way', 'impactful', 'yet', 'palatable', 'way', 'Joe', 'Katsumi', 'final', 'scene', 'devastatingly', 'sincere.The', 'film', 'finale', 'feel', 'little', 'forced', 'faked', 'not', 'really', 'tone', 'film', 'whole', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'did', 'respond', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'said', 'lot', 'admire', 'here', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'almost', 'fronts', 'detail', 'certain', 'areas', 'poignant', 'even', 'today']",N/A
261484,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301670132,Austin Somlo,"[0, 4]","Viewed: 7/13Rate: 57/13: It feels weird watching Sayonara and trying to get used to the idea that Americans and Japanese are forbidden from having an interracial relationship. And then, it gets more weird to see the Japanese females being dressed up as dolls for the Americans, so they will give bath rituals, cook elegant dinners, and perform many traditional routines for honor and duty. That's why I never got into Sayonara. I find the film flat, boring, and long to watch. As a matter of fact, I almost believed in the armed services' stance on the interracial marriage because the Americans appear undeserving of the relationship. On the other hand, Marlon Brando is great playing Ace Gruver as far as his mannerisms go; it is not among his brilliant works. Miiko Taka is beautiful as Hana-ogi but is no actress. I don't see what makes Red Buttons or Miyoshi Umeki's performance special nor do I see the need for the inexplicable casting of Ricardo Montalban, a Mexican, as a Japanese. I am sure the casting director could have found anybody from Japan. Ironically, the film is about overcoming racial inequality although the producers have decided on a Mexican to play as a Japanese. In fact, they've asked Audrey Hepburn to play as Han-ogi, but she turned it down because she found the idea too incomprehensible. All in all, Sayonara received a lot of questionable praise; it was just a flat, soap-operatic film about antiquated laws.",3,Flat Sayonara.,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1441,"['Viewed', '7/13Rate', '57/13', 'weird', 'watching', 'Sayonara', 'trying', 'get', 'used', 'idea', 'Americans', 'Japanese', 'are', 'forbidden', 'having', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'then', 'more', 'weird', 'see', 'Japanese', 'females', 'being', 'dressed', 'up', 'dolls', 'Americans', 'will', 'give', 'bath', 'rituals', 'cook', 'elegant', 'dinners', 'perform', 'many', 'traditional', 'routines', 'honor', 'duty', 'why', 'never', 'got', 'Sayonara', 'find', 'film', 'flat', 'boring', 'long', 'watch', 'matter', 'fact', 'almost', 'believed', 'armed', 'services', 'stance', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'Americans', 'appear', 'undeserving', 'relationship', 'other', 'hand', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'great', 'playing', 'Ace', 'Gruver', 'as', 'far', 'mannerisms', 'go', 'not', 'brilliant', 'Miiko', 'Taka', 'beautiful', 'Hana-ogi', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Miyoshi', 'Umeki', 'performance', 'special', 'do', 'see', 'need', 'inexplicable', 'casting', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'Mexican', 'Japanese', 'am', 'sure', 'casting', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'anybody', 'Japan', 'Ironically', 'film', 'overcoming', 'racial', 'inequality', 'producers', 'have', 'decided', 'Mexican', 'play', 'Japanese', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'asked', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'play', 'Han-ogi', 'turned', 'down', 'found', 'idea', 'too', 'incomprehensible', 'Sayonara', 'received', 'lot', 'questionable', 'praise', 'was', 'just', 'flat', 'soap-operatic', 'film', 'antiquated', 'laws']",N/A

There are no lose ends; yet there is flexibility to speculate what each decision means to the people evolved. For some it is a straightforward love story, for others conflict. Yet it is the conflict that leads to growth and understanding.The actors match the characters perfectly and even though they are major actors they do not overwhelm the characters that they play. For some reason I forget that James Garner is in this movie yet he is the pivot point and catalyst for many scenes as Captain Mike Bailey.The scenery was intriguing. First there was the countryside that appeared timeless yet the theaters were both ancient and modern (for the time period of the movie). I spent an R. &R.; in Japan in 1968 (more time in the country then at the Ginza) and had a hard time leaving my self.There is always a residual of the attitudes that were taking place during the Korean War period.

This romantic drama certainly has its flaws.  It is too long and Brando's southern accent is terrible.  A non-Asian (Ricardo Montalban) with artificially slanted eyes is unfortunately cast as a Japanese in an important role, the plot developments are too reminiscent of soap opera, and the women are stereotypes.On the other hand, there is much to commend it as well.  Its critical stance on white racism toward Asians represents an important evolution in Hollywood's attitude toward non-whites.

261494,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6301670132,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[45, 46]","When I was a teenager, James Michner was publishing his early books, &quot;Fires of Spring&quot; &quot;Tales from the South Pacific&quot; &quot;Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; &quot;Sayonara&quot; &quot;Until They Sail&quot; and &quot;Hawaii.&quot;  I saved my allowance and bought all these books, and though I've traveled extensively and moved many times, I've hung onto them. They affected my life more than anything else I've read, and they point to the fact that the issues so often seen as &quot;arising&quot; in the 1960s (racism, sexism, pacifism) were really issues in the 1950s.Sayonara stars Marlon Brando as Major Lloyd Gruber, a U.S. Air Force field officer stationed in Japan, who is destined to follow in his father's footsteps and become one of the &quot;joint chiefs&quot; if he plays his cards right. Toward that end, his father does not want him to do anything to jeopardize his career--especially the unthinkable--marry &quot;indigeous personnel&quot; as the Japanese were called in U.S. occupied Japan. Lloyd is to marry a young woman who is the daughter of a fellow senior officer. I won't tell you how the story develops but just say the book and the film are different.James Michener was in the Navy and he married a Japanese woman.  He went on to teach English in Texas and put together a handsome collection of Japanese prints when they were inexpensive. Michener never forgot his WWII experiences and he captured them in his books. In the fifties, military personnel began to marry War Brides as they were called. By the 1960s when I was a Marine officer's wife, many of my fellow wives were from foreign countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. I did not understand why the U.S. had race problems since the military was so well integrated--at least in base housing.One of the most touching sights I recall from those days was the Japanese wives leaving the PX theater in tears after the showing of Sayonara, which was playing in military theaters 20 years after it opened. This is a beautiful film, and shows a Japan that is still recovering from the aftermath of war, but nevertheless beautiful.  It is difficult to understand how the people who created the tea ceremony could also have produced such fierce warriors.

Every one of his tics and affectations are on display; the shambling slouch, the beetle browed grimace, the inexplicable adoption of a disfiguring and ludicrous accent (southern this time).  All of which rendered him totally unbelievable as a spit and polish West Point graduate.  What was he thinking?  Why did the director let him get away with it?Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki carry the acting honors in this one, and James Garner too, who made me wish he had been given the leading role instead.What I appreciate most about this moive, however, was the way it endeavored to introduce Western audiences to the different forms of Japanese theatre.  For that, I will even forgive it the rather alarming sight of Ricardo Montelban as a Japanese Kabuki actor.

He is devastating as an Air Force pilot during the Korean War who falls in love with a Japanese woman.  This movie was made in 1957 which explains the discrimination and narrow-mindedness of American occupied Japan, following World War II. The only fault I can find is that the interracial couple are both hero-worshipped and admired by their countrymen; both are famous; he is a war hero and she is a beautiful Japanese entertainer. It follows that it's OK for them to get together. Reminds me of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" where the interracial couple are picture perfect; she is white; a lovely, wealthy, society lass; and he is black; a handsome, lettered, & successful black man. Expect the same from Sayonara. Red Buttons is excellent as a poor private in love with a common but adorable Japanese woman. Prepare yourself for a tearful ending.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[4, 4]","IN A NUTSHELL: WHAT IS THE ""RIGHT THING""?After the plot slowly and gracefully illustrated its theme, I started imagining how easily resolved this race/love issue was going to be. However, I was wrong. The thickening of the plot, delivered through the plight of Red Buttons [Joe Kelly] and his wife Miyoshi Umeki [Katsumi] after their inter-racial marriage, only served to foreshadow what was in the cards for Gruver and Hana-ogi. This double whammy of dramatic romantic issues served to clarify that the pitfalls of racial bigotry in daily life, and the extraordinary romances that had evolved despite them, were nearly equally powerful forces. One, love and caring, brings people together whereas the other, hate and antagonism, tears them apart.After the toll that ""everyday life"" eventually took on ""the Kelly's"", things looked rather grim for Gruver and Hana-ogi. Gruver's family standing (his dad was a 4 star General) and personal achievements (he was a famous fighter pilot ""Ace"") were actually held against him. Hana-ogi, too, has unfair family obligations and baggage which actually turn the couple's physical survival into a long shot. In the end, it all came down to the two protagonists, Marlon Brando as Major Lloyd Gruver and Miiko Taka as Hana-ogi, sorting out and prioritizing exactly what doing the right thing entailed for them. When they decided, Gruver simply said ""SAYONARA"" to reporters after the couple announced their plans.ABOUT THE FILM: MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, ""SAYONARA"" IS A HEAVYWEIGHTThis is a sneaky, dramatic powerhouse that uses Brando's terrible southern accent to have us think that this is not going to be a heavyweight film, as if his accent belies a light or cavalier approach to this film -- nothing could be further from the truth. Red Buttons won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award as did his on-screen wife, Miyoshi Umeki. The film was, in fact, nominated for 10 Oscars, including ""Best Actor"" for Brando, ""Best Director"" for Joshua Logan, ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" for Paul Osborn  and ""Best Picture"" to name just a few.BOTTOM LINE: ONE OF THE VERY BEST FILMS THAT I DIDN'T SEE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASEDThis was one of those films that I don't recall seeing in the theatres, but I can't imagine why I would have missed it.

Sayonara won four Academy Awards, including acting honors for co-stars Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki.The film's screenplay was adapted by Paul Osborn from the novel by James Michener, and was produced by William Goetz and directed by Joshua Logan. Unlike most 1950s romantic dramas, Sayonara deals squarely with racism and prejudice.[1] The supporting cast also features Patricia Owens, James Garner, Martha Scott, Ricardo Montalban, and Miiko Taka.PLOT:Major Lloyd &#34;Ace&#34; Gruver (Marlon Brando), the son of a U.S. Army general, is stationed at Itami Air Force Base near Kobe, Japan. He falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka), who is a performer for a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through his enlisted crew chief, Airman Joe Kelly (Red Buttons).Joe is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki), in spite of the disapproval of the United States military, which will not recognize the marriage. The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding.Joe suffers further prejudice at the hands of a particularly nasty colonel, pulling extra duty and all the less attractive assignments. When he and many others who are married to Japanese are ordered back to the States, Joe realizes that he will not be able to take Katsumi, who is now pregnant.Finding no other way to be together, Joe and Katsumi commit double suicide. This strengthens Ace's resolve to marry Hana-ogi. When a Stars and Stripes reporter asks him what will he say to the &#34;big brass&#34; as well as to the Japanese, neither of which will be particularly happy, Ace says, &#34;Tell 'em we said, 'Sayonara.'&#34;CAST:Marlon Brando - Maj.

Mark WebsterReiko Kuba - FumikoSoo Yong - TerukoRicardo Montalban - NakamuraProduction:Brando adopted a nondescript Southern accent for Gruver, despite the objections of director Logan, who did not think a Southern accent was appropriate for a general's son who was educated at West Point. Logan later admitted to the author and journalist Truman Capote about Brando, &#34;I&#8217;ve never worked with such an exciting, inventive actor. So pliable. He takes direction beautifully, and yet he always has something to add. He&#8217;s made up this Southern accent for the part; I never would have thought of it myself, but, well, it&#8217;s exactly right &#8212; it&#8217;s perfection.&#8221;[2] Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n, born in Mexico to Spanish immigrants, plays a Japanese character.Critical Reception:Sayonara has received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and cinematography, in addition to the acting ability of its cast. It won four Academy Awards, including acting honors for co-stars Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.2/10.Legacy:Alongside the less successful Japanese War Bride and The Teahouse of the August Moon, Sayonara was argued by some scholars to have increased racial tolerance in the United States by openly discussing interracial marriages.[4] Other scholars have argued that the movie is one in a long list stereotyping Asian American women as &#34;lotus blossom, geisha girl, china doll, or Suzie Wong&#34; by presenting Asian women as &#34;passive, sexually compliant and easy to seduce&#34; or as downright prostitutes.which is horribly wrong !!!! and ignorant.Awards:Sayonara won multiple Academy Awards for[6][7]Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Red Buttons)Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Miyoshi Umeki)Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Ted Haworth & Robert Priestley)Best Sound (George Groves)It was also nominated forBest Actor in a Leading Role (Marlon Brando)Best Cinematography (Ellsworth Fredericks)Best Director (Joshua Logan)Best Film Editing (Arthur P.

261506,A3BO21YK08SSV8,6301670132,John M Walker,"[43, 44]","I was seven years old when this movie came out in 1957, but I had never heard of it until one day recently I accidentally caught the end of it on FLIX. I have since watched it over and over -- something I rarely do with any film. Others I have asked also had never heard of it.This film is undeserving of such obscurity; it's a wonderful movie that just captivates me. But there's one scene in this film that is a high example of the filmmaker's art. This scene, in its perfection, is the most powerfully romantic movie scene I have ever beheld. Even after watching it many times, it still leaves me shaking! Wow! This scene transcends story telling with film; it is literature.It evokes something from Madame Bovary (Gustave Flaubert), or Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy). That is to say, the scene portrays something vital about the human experience. At least it does for me; but then, I admit I'm a sucker for stories of love between American men and Asian women.The scene to which I refer is when Lloyd Gruver (Marlon Brando) encounters Hana-ogi in Joe Kelly's (Red Buttons) house. It begins when he opens the sliding door and sees her kneeling, erect, serene, and dignified, waiting for him to arrive. If not on the first watching, then on the second, fourth, or eleventh watching, one will become aware that the lighting, the sound, the furnishings of the room, her hair, her kimonos, her makeup (especially her painted lips) are all perfect. What an ambiance! What a setting for a man and a woman to fall in love!Gruver is immediately struck by her presence; this is plain to see. Nevertheless, he recovers his usual demeanor and proceeds to try to make small talk, his mind and body regarding this lovely creature with respect and admiration, but also lust. She just sits there, regarding him without moving, without even blinking, betraying no thoughts or emotions. His discomfort rises.Then, when it is time and not before, she begins to speak. She speaks word of deep humanity, compassion, wisdom, and sincerity. The power of her words is greatly enhanced by the quiet dignity with which she speaks them. Gruver is dumbfounded, and Brando plays this role very well. You can see on his face (Flaubert or Tolstoy would have painted the picture with words) that his life, unexpectedly, has just been bifurcated. There is now the life before this encounter, and what will come after. He can never again be the same man -- he can never again regard women the same; Hana-ogi is a new paradigm. He never looked for such a thing before, because he never imagined such a woman or such a feeling could exist.Some people continue to insist such love themes are racist. That is absurd. It is the antithesis of racism. This is the profoundest love flourishing in spite of different races and cultures, and the inevitable perils incumbent with this relationship in this place at this time. This is love between a man and a woman, as unfettered by affectations and expectations as love can be. This is the raw, real thing, and this film tells this tale, exquisitely done.",5,"Watch it for this one scene, if nothing else.",1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,3062,"['was', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1957', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'one', 'day', 'recently', 'accidentally', 'caught', 'end', 'FLIX', 'have', 'watched', 'over', 'something', 'rarely', 'do', 'film', 'Others', 'have', 'asked', 'also', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'it.This', 'film', 'undeserving', 'such', 'obscurity', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'high', 'example', 'filmmaker', 'art', 'scene', 'perfection', 'most', 'powerfully', 'romantic', 'movie', 'scene', 'have', 'ever', 'beheld', 'Even', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'shaking', 'Wow', 'scene', 'story', 'telling', 'film', 'literature.It', 'evokes', 'something', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'Gustave', 'Flaubert', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'say', 'scene', 'something', 'vital', 'human', 'experience', 'least', 'then', 'admit', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'stories', 'love', 'American', 'men', 'Asian', 'women.The', 'scene', 'refer', 'when', 'Lloyd', 'Gruver', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Hana-ogi', 'Joe', 'Kelly', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'house', 'when', 'sliding', 'door', 'kneeling', 'erect', 'serene', 'dignified', 'waiting', 'arrive', 'not', 'first', 'watching', 'then', 'second', 'fourth', 'eleventh', 'watching', 'one', 'will', 'become', 'aware', 'lighting', 'sound', 'furnishings', 'room', 'hair', 'kimonos', 'makeup', 'especially', 'painted', 'lips', 'are', 'perfect', 'What', 'ambiance', 'What', 'setting', 'man', 'woman', 'fall', 'love', 'Gruver', 'immediately', 'struck', 'presence', 'plain', 'see', 'Nevertheless', 'usual', 'demeanor', 'proceeds', 'try', 'make', 'small', 'talk', 'mind', 'body', 'regarding', 'lovely', 'creature', 'respect', 'admiration', 'also', 'lust', 'just', 'sits', 'there', 'regarding', 'moving', 'even', 'blinking', 'betraying', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'discomfort', 'rises.Then', 'when', 'time', 'not', 'before', 'speak', 'word', 'deep', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'wisdom', 'sincerity', 'power', 'words', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'Gruver', 'dumbfounded', 'Brando', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'Flaubert', 'Tolstoy', 'would', 'have', 'painted', 'picture', 'words', 'life', 'unexpectedly', 'just', 'been', 'bifurcated', 'now', 'life', 'encounter', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'can', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'same', 'man', 'can', 'never', 'again', 'regard', 'women', 'same', 'Hana-ogi', 'new', 'paradigm', 'never', 'looked', 'such', 'thing', 'before', 'never', 'imagined', 'such', 'woman', 'feeling', 'could', 'exist.Some', 'people', 'continue', 'insist', 'such', 'themes', 'are', 'racist', 'absurd', 'antithesis', 'racism', 'profoundest', 'love', 'flourishing', 'spite', 'different', 'races', 'cultures', 'inevitable', 'perils', 'incumbent', 'relationship', 'place', 'time', 'love', 'man', 'woman', 'unfettered', 'affectations', 'expectations', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'raw', 'real', 'thing', 'film', 'tale', 'exquisitely', 'done']",N/A

261512,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6301670132,K. Boullosa,"[4, 4]","""Sayonara"" could have been an overly sentimentalized mix of predictable lectures on the evils of prejudice and the legacy of war, but its very fine performances, attractive stars, generally well-written script, and lush production save it from these traps and offer up a deeply romantic and affecting film experience.  There are a few nits to pick here, notably the casting of Ricardo Montalban as a legendary Japanese NOH actor, and a couple of overly cardboard-evil military bureaucrats, but these don't too adversely affect the overall high quality of the film.Based on yet another of James Michener's ""exotic location travelogue"" novels, Sayonara examines interracial love between members of formerly warring countries (Japan and the United States), in the post-WWII, post-Korean conflict era (the film was released in 1957).  Marlon Brando, in a wonderful performance (I beg to differ on this point from the many reviews below), plays Major Lloyd ""Ace"" Gruver, a career Air Force man from a distinguished military family.  Already heavily honored for his work in WWII and the Korean conflict, Ace travels to Japan for some R&R.;  His good friend and colleague, Airman Joe Kelly (Red Buttons, who won a Best Supporting Oscar for this role), has already put down roots there after meeting and falling deeply in love with a gentle young Japanese girl named Katsumi (exquisitely played by Miyoshi Umeki).  Kelly, something of a blunt-speaking rebel who doesn't come from the class and money that Ace comes from, wants to marry Katsumi and settle down in Japan, and is running into heavy opposition from Air Force brass.Ace, as Kelly's superior officer, feels obligated to support the military's position here, and does his best to dissuade Kelly from marriage to a Japanese girl.  Ace fails, but he both likes and respects Kelly, and when he sees Kelly is determined to go through with the marriage, Ace agrees to serve as his best man - after Kelly finally manages to jump through all the hoops the military and the government throw up to prevent such marriages from occurring (and those hoops are a matter of historical record).  After Ace meets the lovely Katsumi at the dismally brusque little civil service, and comes to dinner at Kelly and Katsumi's little home by the canal, Kelly's brimming happiness dissolves Ace's remaining doubts about the marriage.Ace himself has been engaged for years to the patrician Eileen Webster (Patricia Owens, who ended up in another classic as the wife of the ill-fated scientist in the original, ""The Fly""), daughter of Lt. Gen. Mark Webster, and, therefore, from a family very much like Ace's own.  Hearing of Ace's stay in Tokyo, Eileen's father has brought over his wife and daughter so Eileen and Ace can spend some time together.  They appear to be ideally suited to each other, but Eileen, who is a refreshingly strongly written female character for the 1950s, is not too happy at Ace's tame acceptance of their long engagement, and his lack of urgency about getting married - from these she senses something is missing in their relationship on Ace's side.  Ace brushes off her doubts, reminding her that as members of a somewhat privileged class, they have duties and responsibilities to fulfill before they can suit themselves, and with this Eileen has to be satisfied.Kelly and Katsumi begin showing Ace around post-war Tokyo, and one evening Ace sees the performance of one of Japan's best-known stage personalities, Hana-ogi, star of the prestigious Matsubayashi School; the school trains girls in singing, dancing, and acting for the stage, and they are strictly prohibited from dating and socializing outside the school (let alone with members of the American military).  The Matsubayashi girls are sort of theatrical vestal virgins, dedicated first to the life of the stage, and then to teaching the next generation, and, after the manner of the unattainable, exert a particular pull on the imaginations of the men in the US military occupying Japan.For Ace, it is love at first sight.  Throwing caution to the winds and ignoring everything he knows about the barriers to such a relationship, Ace begins to pursue the frosty, off-limits Hana-ogi (nicely played by Miiko Taka, who, similar to actor James Shigeta, was actually an American-born ""nisei"" from Hawaii who had to learn the Japanese accent for the role).  Hana-ogi has a passing friendship with Kelly's wife, Katsumi.  To the amazement of all, Ace's dogged pursuit, and the whispers of Katsumi to her friend that the American is neither a boor nor a bigot, eventually melt the coldly unattainable Hana-ogi, and the besotted Ace soon finds himself in exactly the position for which he once lectured Kelly.It isn't long before word of Ace's affair with Hana-Ogi gets out, and because of Ace's family history and higher rank, it generates even greater horror in the military than did Kelly's affair with Katsumi.  Eileen is humiliated and devastated as she realizes that she was right: Ace's feelings for her lacked a basic passionate gestalt, something that the Japanese performer has aroused in him without effort.  Her family is furious and mortified, and Ace goes from being the Fair-Haired Boy of the Air Force to its outcast.From this point on, the film follows the difficult course of the two parallel Japanese/American relationships, for Kelly suddenly finds himself once again struggling with bureaucratic interference: despite the seeming finality of his marriage to Katsumi, he is still a career Air Force man, and is recalled home by the military - without his wife.  His despair at the prospect of separation precipitates the film's most moving segment.  Kelly's and Katsumi's fate also serves as the tie-break in Ace's conflict between his duty and his heart, and sets up the conclusion of the film.The film is explicit about the brutal lengths to which the American military and government went during the occupation to stop G.I.s who wished to marry Japanese women from doing so; nor does it shy away from exposing the cultural prejudices held by the Japanese (all Westerners are barbarians), and some of the less attractive aspects of traditional Japanese culture: Hana-ogi got into the Matsubayashi school because her poverty-stricken parents sold her, presumably as a future courtesan, but the people who bought her saw her special quality and instead sent her to the school.  Thus, Hana-ogi is also bound by duties and obligations and personal debt that she cannot violate without incurring dishonor.The performances, starting with Brando's very sympathetic and nuanced portrait of Ace Gruver, are note-perfect - and that includes Brando's southern accent, which did not strike this reviewer as either ""over the top"" or out of place - the south produced many distinguished military families.  Red Buttons richly earned his Best Supporting Oscar as the passionately devoted Kelly, and James Garner adds his own unique quality in a supporting role as a Marine also trying to navigate a relationship with a Matsubayashi dancer. Ricardo Montalban gives a remarkably dignified performace as Nakamura, considering the absurdity of his casting in the role, and Patricia Owens gives the unfortunate Eileen depth and character. Miyoshi Umeki and Miiko Taka are convincing and affecting as Katsumi and Hana-ogi (considering that they, too, are inhabiting something of a stereotyped, idealized image of Asian women).  Joshua Logan, who was also Michener's collaborator on the film version of ""South Pacific"", did a superb job bringing the locations and story to life, and Franz Waxman composed the evocative score.  The cinematography is beautiful.This is not the deepest film about interracial prejudice and military stupidity that has ever been made: it is a bit too ""picturesque"" for that.  But it is a thoroughly satisfying and beautifully made one.  Thus, despite its length (two and a half hours), and at least one highly questionable casting issue, its powerful story, moving performances, and potent atmosphere have the uncanny ability to hook and keep the viewer emotionally engaged throughout.

261518,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,6301670132,Nicholas Stix,"[7, 10]","4 1/2 starsShakespeare's rule - ""happy ending, comedy; unhappy ending, tragedy"" - does not apply to Sayonara. It is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.Set in Japan in 1951, towards the end of the U.S. occupation, and during the Korean War, Sayonara tells of American men thousands of miles away from home, and the forbidden Japanese women they meet, and fall in love with.At the time, servicemen were forbidden from fraternizing with Japanese women, but like the song says, ""If you can't be/With the one you love/Well, then, love the one you're with."" And in all fairness, many a G.I. met the love of his life while in uniform on foreign soil.The story sets up a parallel between two rigidly hierarchical, intolerant societies: The U.S. Army and Japan.Marlon Brando plays Maj. Lloyd ""Ace"" Gruver, the reigning ace and golden boy of the Army Air Force. ""Ace"" is the son of a four-star general, and destined himself for general officer status, as long as he plays by the rules. Gruver is an amiably racist Southerner whose world is about to be turned upside down. (One glaring historical error in Sayonara, is its making Gruver a flier in the Army Air Force. The Army Air Force ceased to exist in 1947, when it became the fully independent branch, the U.S. Air Force. The error may have been deliberate, since a brand, spanking new service branch could not be depicted as bound to tradition.)Gruver is confronted with racial conflict through one of his men, Airman Joe ""Red"" Kelly (played by carrot-topped Jew, Red Buttons). Red asks Gruver, his C.O., to witness his marriage. Gruver does not seek to hide his racism, and as per Army regulations, seeks to talk Kelly out of the union. He emphasizes that Kelly will not be able to take his wife stateside with him, should he be assigned to return home. Kelly says he will never leave the woman he loves, and demands and receives an apology from the officer. This scene is designed to set up the conflict to come, and to show Gruver's profound decency, and the loyalty he feels to his men. In Japan, Gruver witnesses the wedding, and even kisses the bride.Japan is a traditional society and Gruver, the product of Army tradition, is himself locked in a semi-arranged marriage to a three-star general's daughter, a wonderful, intelligent, beautiful young woman (""Eileen Webster,"" played by Patricia Owens). But is he really in love with her?Gruver becomes smitten with Japan's most famous musical actress, ""Hana-ogi"" (Miiko Taka), and pursues her. Meanwhile, his fianc&eacute; becomes attracted to the country's greatest kabuki actor (""Nakamura,"" played by Ricardo Montalban, an Hispanic; imagine the reaction by Asian ethnic hustlers to such casting today!).Meanwhile, a racist colonel decides to make the lives of soldiers who have fallen in love with Japanese girls a living hell.Sayonara was up for a heap of Oscars, but only won two. It lost out on most of the awards, because it was up against The Bridge on the River Kwai, another movie about the collision of Japan and the West, which happened to be one of the greatest movies ever made. The two Oscars Sayonara did win, went to Red Buttons and Miyeshi Umeki (as Red Kelly's Japanese bride, ""Katsumi""), as Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. As moving as these two performers were, I'm not sure Buttons deserved the award over Sessue Hayakawa's performance as Col. Saito in Kwai. However, without giving away too much, the circumstances of Buttons and Umeki's performances won them their Oscars, just as much as their performances did.Sayonara is filled out by a congenial performance by a young James Garner, as Marine Corps ""Capt. Mike Bailey,"" who befriends Gruver, and workmanlike performances by Martha Scott and Kent Smith as Gruver's prospective mother-in-law and her spineless husband, and Douglass Watson as the racist colonel, respectively. While modestly effective in her more intimate scenes, Miiko Taka performs with much more self-assurance in her musical stage numbers.In 1957, Marlon Brando was on top of the world. Having not yet suffered the egotistical meltdown that would make him both personally and professionally unreliable for the rest of his career (see Apocalypse Now, etc.), at the time he could play anything but Shakespeare.There is clearly a liberal message here: We can triumph over racism, if we can reach through to the core decency of people who were raised in a racist culture. And I believe that Sayonara went too easy on the Japanese, who at their best were as racist as we were, at our worst.Either you will feel bullied by Sayonara's underlying liberal pieties, or it will break your heart. It broke mine.P.S. The barebones DVD contains only the 1957 theatrical trailer.Originally published on November 29, 2003, in The Critical Critic.",5,"Happy Ending, Tragedy",1074211200,"01 16, 2004",2004,4813,"['4',

Marlon Brando....skillfully underplayed role. When I first saw the movie as a kid, I wasn't sure if he would be a sympathetic character or not. He's wonderful. Ricardo Montalban...one of the most under-rated actors ever. I remember reading a long time ago that when he danced on the Kabuki stage, the audience was not aware that it was Mr. Montalban performing ontage. Although one does wonder why a Japanese actor (like James Shigeta) was not given the role, I loved him in this. Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki...this is where the 5 hankies come in. I'm not sure if Japanese people thought her character was a stereotype or not...I will only say that I enjoyed her portrayal. She was so obviously in love with her 'Joe'.

261520,A1VQIL2SJTRYRM,6301670132,Oskar,"[6, 8]","I rated this with 4 stars only because the acting seemed stilted and dated.  Never-the-less this film is definately worth seeing (the book, the ending in particular since the film does not go that far, is more so worth reading).  Just because the film and the setting are dated in a particular time does not reduce the significance of the issues.  Have we changed our attitudes since then?

261522,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,6301670132,Paul Sayles,"[6, 6]","Sayonara is a story that was bold in the 1950s but to those of us living in the 21st century, it may seem old and outdated.  Some of it may be a little casual - the lack of serious Japanese male actors, but the central theme of the story is still important.  Marlon Brando, Red Buttons and James Garner are Americans, assigned to Japan after combat in Korea, with interests in Japanese women.  Brando has an American fiancee whom it is apparent he is ambivilent about marrying - he seems to have been engaged for a very long time.  Garner, as a Marine aviator, has a Japanese lady friend who is a professional dancer and Buttons his fiance that he wants to marry - regardless of the rules that make it difficult if not impossible to have a successful marriage.Brando coming to Japan from Korea needs a break.  He is starting to be troubled by what he is doing.  He remarks to Buttons that  one of his most recent aerial victories was over a man with a face.  Appparently his previous victories were done at a long enough range that it didn't become so personal.  This time it was different and is staying with him.I think it it the story of Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki that is the most pivotal part of the story.  They have the courage to get married and face the future as a couple.  Brando's ambivilance to his fiancee finally causes him to walk away from her and hook up with Garner in the officer's club bar.  They had become acquainted when Garner attempted to bring his Japanese guest into the officer's club and was refused permission to do so.  Through Garner, Brando becomes interested in another famous professional dancer, Miiko Taka, and he begins a quest to meet her.  He asks Buttons and Umeki to introduce him to Hana Ogi and the initial attempt is less than successful.  Hana Ogi says she doesn't talk to Americans because during the war her brother and father were killed by the Americans.  Brando is astonished by this thinking as he says he didn't kill them (guilt by association) and then Garner adds a telling and resonating comment ""yes you did, we all did"".  Garner's role understands that in the eyes of Japanese all Americans participated in the leveling of Japanese cities and the starvation of the people through submarine warfare.  It didn't matter if the servicemen they saw were in Europe during the war or were even to young to have fought there but were doing their two years service obligation (draft).  At their first meeting she is stiff but soon becomes comfortable in Brando's presence.Buttons has become the center of a campaign to transfer enlisted men who have married Japanese women and gets orders to return to the US.  Brando, one of the few people he respects, tries to get the orders changed without success.  Even the pregnancy of Button's wife has no effect on the decision.  Faced with a life of seperation, suicide is their answer.  This is after Umeki has the idea of having her eyelids slashed so that after the surgery they look like an AMerican woman.  It is sad and frustrating to think that in the real world it was done as the flyer described that Umeki had in her hands.  The musical accompaniment to Brando finding their bodies is extremely moving in this scene and is something I have remembered since I first saw this movie over forty years ago.  Brando's performance as the grief stricken friend is superb - you can almost feel his pain and then anger as his ex-future father-in-law general tells him that the law is being changed and soon men like Buttons can bring Japanese wives to the US.  It is a little late for Buttons and his wife though.After the deaths of thier friends, Hana Ogi is moved to Tokyo by her company (afterall no matter how popular she is with the public, she is still an employee) Brando follows and it is there that they decide to face the offical displeasure of both countries and marry although it is extremely difficult for Hana Ogi to make the decision to turn her back on age old customs and traditions.  Hana Ogi's description of how she came to be a dancer is chilling.  I think she sees the difficult future much more clearly than Brando's character. yet they both are willing to take the risk.There is another relationship that isn't discussed and that is the role of Eileen Webster (Brando's fiancee) and the kabuki dancer Nakamura.  She has dinner with him, both with and without Brando and the topic of Brando's relationship with a famous Japanese dancer is discussed and in Nakamura's case discounted.  Yet when Brando makes the announcement to the Webster family that he wants to marry a Japanese woman, Eileen walks out.  Her mother asks her to stay and talk and Eileen responds that the only person she wants to talk to is Japanese - Nakamura.  This could have been a much more intriguing situation.  It was relatively common for American men to date and marry Japanese women.  What would the reaction have been to the developing relationship between a Japanese man and an American woman?  I think that has more societal impact for the late 1950s than an American man and Japanese woman.Throughout the film the entire cast is extremely effective, from Buttons' enthusiasm over his future wife to Garner's anger at not being able to take a Japanese guest into the Officer's club.  It all feels quite real.  Look at the small details as Brando is waiting for Taka as she passes over a bridge every day to her performance.  He makes an impression on her inspite of her resistance.  This is a look at Japanese culture as well as the US military culture.  Ricardo Montalban as a kabuki actor is exceptional - he deserved an academy award nomination as well as Buttons.  James Garner is also exceptional as the Marine Corps aviator who is at first antagonistic to Brando but later introduces him to Japan outside of the officer's club.  His performance is very under rated and deserves much greater praise.The musical score of the movie is outstanding and has a very positive impact on the film scenes.  Without this score I'm not sure how well the film would have been.Oddly enough, some of the same themes from this film are resonating in my personal life as I am living in Japan.  Some of the same issues that are raised in the film were ones that my wife to be had after I asked her to marry me.  The issue of children especially resonated and still does from time to time.  Her concern about what the child will be and all I can say is that it will be ours.  I showed Rumi the last few minutes of the film and it had a powerful impression on her.  It also showed her that her questions and concerns were not unique - that they have been discussed and argued over for decades.It is a movie that does not end happily - maybe it ends hopefully is a better summary, as Brando and Taka take on the officials of Japan and the US.  You think it will work but you don't know for sure.Another point to think about is that in the 40s and 50s - a number of states had laws that forbid bi-racial marriages.  A friend of my father's in the Navy had orders to a state where such a law was in operation and had to leave his Japanese wife and bi-racial son in Japan while he was doing his assignment in the US.  The best the Navy could do was to give him as short an assignment as possible in the US and then hopen to get him back to Japan close to it - Guam, Korea, The Philippines or Vietnam.  If Brando could take his Japanese wife back to the US - would he run afoul of state laws forbidding bi-racial marriages since many bases of the US military were located in the states where these laws were on the books - if not enfource.This is a must see film for anyone interested in the military of the 1950s and the impact on Japan of the US and vice versa.",5,An exceptional movie of postwar

261523,A37B3O457INKEA,6301670132,Peter Kenney,"[4, 5]","SAYONARA is a love story. Actually the movie gives us three separate love stories but focuses mainly on just two of them. Major Lloyd Gruver (Marlon Brando) is a West Point graduate who is the son of a general and is engaged to a daughter of another general. Gruver falls in love with Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka), the leading dancer of a prestigious Japanese girl review. Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) is an airman in Gruver's outfit who is in love with Katsumi (Myoshi Umeki), another Japanese girl. Marine Captain Mike Bailey (James Garner) and one of the minor dancers in the troupe make up a third couple.As the story unfolds Gruver and Hana-ogi have to come to grips with their own prejudices while each has to combat the expectations thrust upon them by society because of their respective positions. Both are heavily bound by custom and tradition. On the other hand, Airman Kelly and Katsumi, who are unwavering in their love for each other and their determination to stay together at all costs, have to battle a mountain of red tape and an insensitive bureaucracy. This proves to be no small task. Captain Bailey and his girl friend seem to succeed in taking the whole situation in stride without putting too much pressure on each other.The movie is filled with contrasts. Besides the many differences between the two cultures, there is the sharp differentiation between the lives of military officers and enlisted men. The differences in style between Major Gruver and the more relaxed Captain Bailey are obvious.After earning a reputation as a comedian, Red Buttons was surprisingly convincing in his portrayal of the tragic Kelly. Myoshi Umeki and Miiko Taka both gave strong performances in their Hollywood debuts. Marlon Brando and James Garner did about as well as expected. Ricardo Montalban played a Kabuki dancer. Although he has long been considered a fine actor, surely one of the many fine Japanese actors available at that time would have been a better choice for this role.Both Red Buttons and Myoshi Umeki received Academy Awards as best supporting actor and best supporting actress.

This one, of course, deals with marriages between US GIs and Japanese girls during early 1950s occupied Japan.

This is the backdrop for this sensitive and well-made film.Brando plays the role of an American hot-shot jet pilot who is temporarily transferred from the Korean battle front to occupied Japan.  He and a close friend both meet and fall in love with splendid Japanese ladies, and therein lies a touching and tragic storyline.  No spoilers here.What is it about Brando that caused him to repeatedly be cast in roles that required him to assume awful accents of one kind or another?  (Mutiny on the Bounty, The Young Lions, and this one.)  Brando utterly fails to pull off the Southern accent of his role, and they would have done better to dispense with it altogether.  This is why I deprive this one of the fifth star--the accent really, really degrades the film.

Culbertson ""sjculb3""","[10, 10]","Sayonara follows Air Force officer Lloyd (Marlon Brando) who is conveniently transferred from Korea to Kobe, Japan in hopes that he will wed a Generals daughter. Being unsure of his feelings on marriage, Lloyd soon becomes attracted to a famous dancer named Hana Ogi (Miko Tanaka) who has issues of her own. The other sub plot in the film involves Lloyds friend Kelly (Red Buttons) who faces prejudice and bullying from his commanding officer for marrying his frowned upon Japanese wife Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki). Both Buttons and Umeki won best supporting actor and actress Oscars for this film.Yes the film, despite being a love story, spends a lot of time exploring racism against the Japanese. As some reviewers have pointed out, the Japanese were also very racist. That fact is only touched on in one scene where Mr. Nakamura (the only real Japanese man shown in the film and played interestingly enough by a very young Ricado Montalban) mentions that some of his own countrymen are not too terribly enthusiastic about international relationships. Granted, in a film which tries to juggle the beauty of Japan, racism and a love story, there is hardly time to explore the Japanese view point. One does wonder how Red Buttons wife's parents reacted to their daughter Katsumi marrying an American? Had Marlon Brando's love interest Hana Ogi's family lived surely they would not have been pleased with her giving up her famous career to marry a foreigner. Sadly none of these things are examined and may have been a flaw in a film trying to combat such a serious issue.Mika Tanaka who portrays Brando's girlfriend was actually an American born into a wealthy Japanese family from Washington State. That's why her command of English is so good. Her character of Hana Ogi is a famous dancer in the Matsubayashi Girls dancing troupe. She explains to Brando in one heartfelt scene that she owes her life to the troupe and that her responsibility is to grow old and become a teacher for future dancers.  There were no actual ""Matsubayashi Girls"" but the film invents the troupe as a serious, harshly governed, traditional group of girls who ironically perform Las Vegas style shows.Such dancers doing modern style dances for American G.I.'s were no doubt plentiful in post war Japan. However these girls came from a much less structured and governed group unlike the film would have you believe. In other words, the Geisha didn't go running off and put on tap shoes. The film's credits list the Matsubayahi girls as played by the Shochiku Comany dancers. Shochiku is still a well known movie company today but their days of promoting dancers, if in fact they ever did, are long since gone. I have reason to suspect that they were created just for this film.The film is shot in Itami City,Kyoto,  Kobe, Osaka, Ise and Tokyo. One of my favorite scenes is Marlon Brando on the beach in Ise, admiring the ""wedding rocks"" while James Garner waits behind him in a jeep.........a good 100 km away in Arashiyama!Most modern Japanese have never heard of the film Sayonara. The small group of Japanese adults that I know who did watch this film to were surprised and embarrassed by the level of servitude that Katsumi gave to Red Buttons. They also laughed at the fact that most of the Japanese women in the film adopted a very flat accent which was very typical of old T.V. dramas at the time.Like many movies of their time shot in Japan, Americans are portrayed with the ""how could anyone not love us""? attitude.The original 1957 movie program (Japanese) does mention that there was another ending to the film or rather, the ending was left out. In Japan, it seems, the last 5 minutes of the film wasn't shown in Japan. Weather it was cut, or another scene was shot later for American audiences, the program doesn't say. If there are other versions, they weren't shown in Japan.One final note, which is probably THE SADDEST of all concerns Miyoshi Umeki who won a best supporting actress for this film.  She started her career as a singer and changed her name briefly to Nancy Umeki before being hired for Sayonara.  After winning the Oscar, she moved to the U.S.  and did many bit parts in movies and t.v. Most people might remember her in the U.S. playing Mrs. Livingston opposite Bill Bixby in the short lived T.V. drama ""The Courtship of Eddies Father"". Despite being the first Asian and the first Japanese to win an Oscar, she is virtually unknown in Japan. One would think that in Japan they would celebrate such an honored person but sadly the old generation barely remembers her and the new one has never heard of her. Oscar shows in Japan, at lest the last 10 years that I have watched, have never mentioned her. Miyoshi died in August of 2007 and there was very little about her death in Japan.",5,"Sayonara, some questions answered.",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,4790,"['Sayonara', 'Air', 'Force', 'officer',

But I can assure you, having lived in Japan during the years the film was made and released, that this is exactly what it looked like then. From the military scenes, the big city, religious shrines and parks, to the seedy canal village.What's hard to believe of course, besides Brando's accent, is the almost magical ability of a boorish, and not so subtly chauvinistic character like Ace Gruver to, within a few days, bridge the immense cultural and societal gap between the ""Ugly American"" and the cloistered superstar Hana-Ogi, and in the first date get a commitment of eternal love from her! Still, the ethereal beauty and personality that Miiko Taka brings to the role makes this improbable love story just as believable as any star-crossed classic. It's a wonder that Taka didn't get nominated too.One of my yardsticks for how classic a film really is relies on how impressed I was with it as a kid, and 50 years later finding out how good it still is, even after I now understand what it's really about, and how movies are really made.Despite it's few silly drawbacks though, this is definitely a minimum two-hanky date flick for couples at any level of involvement.",4,A Two-Hanky Classic!,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,1306,"['have', 'been', 'comments', 'reviews', 'net', 'picture-postcard', 'look', 'film', 'being', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'can', 'assure', 'having', 'lived', 'Japan', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'released', 'exactly', 'what', 'looked', 'then', 'military', 'scenes', 'big', 'city', 'religious', 'shrines', 'parks', 'seedy', 'canal', 'village.What', 'hard', 'believe', 'course', 'Brando', 'accent', 'almost', 'magical', 'ability', 'boorish', 'not', 'so', 'subtly', 'chauvinistic', 'character', 'Ace', 'Gruver', 'few', 'days', 'bridge', 'immense', 'cultural', 'societal', 'gap', 'Ugly', 'American', 'cloistered', 'superstar', 'Hana-Ogi', 'first', 'date', 'get', 'commitment', 'eternal', 'love', 'Still', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'personality', 'Miiko', 'Taka', 'role', 'improbable', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'as', 'believable', 'star-crossed', 'classic', 'wonder', 'Taka', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'too.One', 'yardsticks', 'how', 'classic', 'film', 'really', 'relies', 'how', 'impressed', 'was', 'kid', '50', 'years', 'later', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'good', 'still', 'even', 'now', 'understand', 'what', 'really', 'about', 'how', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'made.Despite', 'few', 'silly', 'definitely', 'minimum', 'two-hanky', 'date', 'flick', 'couples', 'level', 'involvement']",N/A

Brando plays a Major in the Air Force stationed in Korea, who also happens to be the son of a big-shot General and is wooing the daughter (played by Patricia Owens) of a Lt. General.  When one of the men under his command (Red Buttons) declares his intentions of marrying a Japanese woman (Miyoshi Umeki), Brando tries to talk him out of it.  When Brando and Buttons are transferred to Japan, Brando re-ignites his relationship with his girlfriend who is living there with her family.  However, he also starts to realize that he's never explored what he actually wants in life - everything has been dictated by his family and social position.  He then surprises even himself when he is attracted to a mysterious Japanese dancer, played by Miiko Taka.""Sayonara"" is surprisingly effective, both as a romance and as an ""issues"" movie; it really stands up better than most ""issues"" movies of its time.  Most of the reason is because of the superb acting; Buttons and Umeki won Oscars for their supporting roles.  In addition, Brando gives an under-stated, sensitive performance in his Oscar-nominated role.  Fortunately, the outstanding acting allows the audience to believe Brando's transformation as well as the relationships that form, which is crucial for this film.  Director Joshua Logan also does great work here, especially as he's best known for rather over-heated, unsubtle movies such as ""Bus Stop"" and ""Picnic.""

Brando is at his worst here, clearly bored with the part he plays up the Southern stereotype to such a simple downhome clich&eacute; that he comes across more like Steve Martin as the Jerk doing Elvis rather than a successful West Point career officer, but a strong supporting cast - an understated Red Buttons (unjustly slated by Pauline Kael for some reason), James Garner and Kent Smith - take up the slack, and MGM/UA's DVD is such a stunningly beautiful transfer that it's easy to get sucked into it. Shame about the impromptu press conference ending and Ricardo Montalban's ah-so turn as the world's tallest Kabuki actor.",4,Superior soap opera,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,1181,"['Sayonara', 'problems', '50s', 'Scope', 'blockbuster', 'doorstop', 'novel', 'adaptations', 'Joshua', 'Logan', 'films', 'slow', 'pacing', 'not', 'least', 'still', 'taking', 'nearly', 'hour', 'lovers', 'meet', 'once', 'soap', 'operatics', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'support', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'daring', 'criticism', 'US', 'Army', 'racist', 'policies', 'rather', 'sole', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'hard', 'imagine', 'major', 'studio', 'today', 'making', 'mainstream', 'big-budget', 'picture', 'A-list', 'stars', 'say', 'American', 'troops', 'falling', 'nice', 'Islamic', 'girls', 'Brando', 'worst', 'here', 'clearly', 'bored', 'part', 'up', 'Southern', 'stereotype', 'simple', 'downhome', 'clich', 'eacute', 'more', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Jerk', 'doing', 'Elvis', 'rather', 'successful', 'West', 'Point', 'career', 'officer', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'understated', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'unjustly', 'slated', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'reason', 'James', 'Garner', 'Kent', 'Smith', 'take', 'up', 'slack', 'MGM/UA', 'DVD', 'such', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'easy', 'get', 'sucked', 'Shame', 'impromptu', 'press', 'conference', 'ending', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'ah-so', 'turn', 'world', 'tallest', 'Kabuki', 'actor']",N/A

It is always nice to see something of your own life on the screen, to see things that you can empathize with and maybe show to other people so that they can understand the difficulties, prejudice and deep cultural divides that one must overcome when dealing with international romance.  My partner and I both agree that ""Sayonara"" is one of the best, in that it respects both sides of relationship, without presenting one culture as ""normal"" and one as ""bizarre"", which is what most typically happens.  The racism and hatred of the mixed couples is shown by both the Japanese and the Americans, and there are heroes and villains on both sides as well.As many have noted, the primary romance between Marlon Brando and Miiko Taka is not the most touching.  That is your typical Hollywood fare, with the coolest guy hooking up with the prettiest girl, and living pretty much happily every after.  No, the true love story, the most realistic and moving, is the simple and pure affection between Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) and his wife Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki).  They are not the most beautiful or elegant couple, but the strength of their commitment to each other far exceeds the cultural and legal forces attempting to drive them apart.  Without giving away too much of the story, it is no wonder why these two won Oscars for their performances instead of the more famous lead actors.Along with that, ""Sayonara"" gives an accurate and educational tour of Japanese culture, including the main theatrical styles of kabuki, noh, bunraku and Takurazuka, and practices such as the tea ceremony.  The only bit that was a bit off the mark was the typical home life of the couples, which was probably true of the era but hardly reflects a modern Japanese woman.  However, my partner did get a big kick out of the scene where Katsumi washed Joe Kelly's back in the bathtub, as this is a traditional way for wives to show affections for their husband, and something she enjoys doing with me, so perhaps things haven't changed that much.",5,International love story,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,2126,"['Being', 'involved', 'American/Japanese', 'relationship', 'am', 'bit', 'sucker', 'kind', 'flick', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'own', 'life', 'screen', 'see', 'things', 'can', 'empathize', 'maybe', 'show', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'understand', 'difficulties', 'prejudice', 'deep', 'cultural', 'divides', 'one', 'must', 'overcome', 'when', 'dealing', 'international', 'romance', 'partner', 'agree', 'Sayonara', 'one', 'best', 'sides', 'relationship', 'presenting', 'one', 'culture', 'normal', 'one', 'bizarre', 'what', 'most', 'typically', 'racism', 'hatred', 'mixed', 'couples', 'shown', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'are', 'heroes', 'villains', 'sides', 'well.As', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'primary', 'romance', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Miiko', 'Taka', 'not', 'most', 'touching', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'coolest', 'guy', 'hooking', 'up', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'living', 'pretty', 'much', 'happily', 'No', 'true', 'love', 'story', 'most', 'realistic', 'moving', 'simple', 'pure', 'affection', 'Joe', 'Kelly', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'wife', 'Katsumi', 'Miyoshi', 'Umeki', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'couple', 'strength', 'commitment', 'other', 'far', 'cultural', 'legal', 'forces', 'attempting', 'drive', 'apart', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'wonder', 'why', 'two', 'won', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'instead', 'more', 'famous', 'lead', 'actors.Along', 'Sayonara', 'accurate', 'educational', 'tour', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'including', 'main', 'theatrical', 'styles', 'kabuki', 'noh', 'bunraku', 'Takurazuka', 'practices', 'such', 'tea', 'ceremony', 'only', 'bit', 'was', 'bit', 'mark', 'was', 'typical', 'home', 'life', 'couples', 'was', 'probably', 'true', 'era', 'hardly', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'However', 'partner', 'did', 'get', 'big', 'kick', 'scene', 'where', 'Katsumi', 'washed', 'Joe', 'Kelly', 'back', 'bathtub', 'traditional', 'way', 'wives', 'show', 'affections', 'husband', 'something', 'doing', 'so', 'perhaps', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'that', 'much']",N/A
