The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.

514714,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00002EQ0D,C. O. DeRiemer,"[43, 43]","In 1927 in Berlin, Harry Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen), a poor, talented musician, puts an ad in a paper asking that anyone interested in forming a singing group meet with him. Robert Biberti (Ben Becker) shows up, equally poor but brash, confident, full of drive. Soon there are five of them, plus the piano accompanist. They are all young, all talented singers, all unknown. Frommermann is the creative force, choosing the songs and creating the vocal arrangements. And of the six, three are Jews (including Frommermann), and three are gentile (including Biberti). By the end of 1927 they have become a huge success in Germany as The Comedian Harmonists. The perform in white tie and tails, sing complex harmonies, all sorts of songs, and use their voices to imitate instruments. In the next few years their success extends to Europe and the United States. Some say, even now, that they are one of the greatest vocal groups of the century. After Hitler comes to power they are quickly banned from singing any songs written by Jews. Even so, they believe their popularity will provide them protection. At the end of a successful tour in the United States they debate about returning to Germany, but decide to go back where their friends and families are. In 1934, the group is banned from performing in public, and the Nazis strongly hint that the Aryan members of the group should reform without the Jewish members. Eventually the Jews leave Germany and the Aryan members stay put. Both form new groups but without any particular success. Both groups disband in 1941.This movie works on many levels:--It's a clear-eyed view of the growing racist changes in German society after Hitler comes to power. It shows how people didn't want to see what was happening around them. A Jewish music shop owner who has racist slogans painted on her window blames it on kids.--It tells not only the story of The Comedian Harmonists, but the stories of the individual members. One Aryan who is married to a Jew divorces her as soon as he can and eventually marries the daughter of a wealthy Nazi. The Aryan girlfriend of a Jewish member of the group unhesitatingly converts to Judaism so they can marry in his faith. They eventually wind up in San Francisco in a happy marriage that lasted over fifty years. One Aryan member (Biberti) helped design rocket bombs during the war. One Jewish member (Frommermann) became a U.S. citizen, immediately joined the Army and spent the war years entertaining U.S. troops. One Jewish member after the war became a manufacturer of eye glass frames.--It resurrects the style and skill of The Comedian Harmonists, who in America have been long forgotten. Throughout the movie the group performs some of their best songs, with the actors expertly lip synching to superbly restored original recordings.There are many movies which show the impact of Nazism in the Thirties and Forties. I suppose the fate of a successful singing group, in that context, might not be considered worth too much attention. But this is an accomplished movie, with great acting. It is entertaining and enormously affecting. It's a movie well worth having.

Just about every musical has some hokey scene where musicians who have either just met for the first time or who have yet to gel suddenly click and produce music that, if not miraculous, is at least fit to be included on the soundtrack album.  It happens in Hollywood flicks and it happens here too.  After being rejected at their first audition, a struggling German vocal group in late '20s Berlin is just about to pack it in, when in a burst of inspiration they turn their pity party into an extraordinary vocal jam session (where their uncanny ability to imitate musical instruments is revealed) and the rest is, as they say, history: their ultimate success, a given.That much may seem like formula--and maybe some of the boy-girl aspects of storyline may seem like familiar territory as well (two friends and musical collaborators competing for the love of the same girl).  But the movie IS fact based, and presumably reasonably true to actual events.  Of course, when those events take place against the historical backdrop of the rise of Nazism and the first intimations of the Holocaust to come, then they take on an additional poignancy.  The inevitable squabbles and petty jealousies of musical partners will soon to be dwarfed by the sheer enormity of the historical events brewing all around them.  We know it: they don't (yet).  Therein lies much of the film's emotional power.Much has been made of the fact that half the group, who come to be billed as ""The Comedian Harmonists,"" was Jewish and that they nonetheless enjoyed considerable popularity in a society beginning to seethe over with anti-Semitism.  In fact, the film plotline has top Nazi officials numbering among its biggest fans.  The suggestion is that even the cruelest of hearts could be touched by music this bright, happy and fun. The tendency toward denial among German Jews (and other Germans!) is also hinted at.  Surely, these beloved artists would be spared  from the coming nightmare!  It can't happen ""hier""!The movie is somewhat evocative of other films involving struggling entertainers in the pre-Hitler era.  Like CABARET, it is a supremely entertaining musical with a political punch.  But it's not nearly as dark as that film, or as other films that tread similar terrain (Bergman's SERPENT'S EGG, Visconti's THE DAMNED).  Aside from their considerable musical talent, these characters are actually everyman types.  Oh sure, they party hard and get their start singing in a brothel.  But they all possess a certain innocence nonetheless.  This is not quite the demimonde: it's more a bunch of blokes getting together to make light, humorous, jazzy music while the world around them crumbles.They are indeed Comedians as well as Harmonists.  But, as they say, sometimes the line between comedy and tragedy is a fine one.",4,Ausgezeichnet!

I find movies such as ""Sophie's Choice"" and the ""Comedian Harmonists"" to be infinitely more effective in relaying the sadness and depressing realities of the Nazi fanaticism. Whereas ""Schindler's List"" is one numbing horror story after another, the smaller stories mentioned above have the ability to focus the viewers attention and admisration on a smaller range of characters and themes.Watching this film was simultaneously uplifting and depressing-the fine characters practicing their art while the politics trudge on. The last concert scene is one of the more heartrenching aspects of this film. Hitler's drones allowing one last go-around before the Jews are disbanded from the group forcefully. It's amazing how petty the politics were-ranging from music,literature and artwork. We all know the end result, but it's more interesting to me to see it's effects and roots from a different viewpoint.The music of course is the big draw here.

I was actually happy to read in the afterwards posted on the screen that he and his wife eventually divorced.  I can see why.  But that's just my opinion.As mentioned I did find the film overly long.  In sum, it's a valuable addition to the information we have of the trials of German citizens during the Hitler era.

He is a talented singer/arranger and his vision is to bring together an exceptional group of men to sing ""jazzed up"" and highly stylized versions of popular songs.  Harry is a perfectionist and the first third of the film shows him first cajoling and then badgering his singers to develop a musically unique and visually entertaining style.  He succeeds beyond even his ambitious dreams.  Soon the Comedian Harmonists are a feature act in demand not only in Germany, but internationally.Unfortunatley for the Harmonists, Hitler comes to power in 1933, just as the group is headed for true stardom.  Jews in Germany are beginning to feel the impact of the racial hatred that will end in the holocaust.  Of the six members of the Harmonists, three are jews and as the story progresses, first restrictions and then cancellations of their concerts prevent the group from finding an audience in Germany for their work.  They head to New York and find success there.  Harry would like to remain in America, but the rest of the band still believes there is a chance for some success in Germany, so they head home again.The Harmonists' error in judgment is typical of the mistake of many jews in Germany who thought they only needed to patiently wait for reason to return to their country. At the end of the film we see the Harmonists on stage in Munich performing to an audience that knows that something very special is being lost to them. The Harmonists disband and the jewish members escape to freedom.  The group left in Germany tries to reconstitute the band, as does the group that leaves, but they do not experience the success of the original members.If it were not for the music, which is truly first-rate, this story would be interesting, but not worth four stars.  Because the music is so much a part of the film, those viewers who enjoy vocal singing at its very best are sure to enjoy this unusual film.",4,Great music threaded into the story line.,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,2436,"['time', 'place', 'Germany', 'Hitler', 'coming', 'power', 'story', 'centers', 'genesis', 'Comedian', 'Harmonists', 'group', 'five', 'singers', 'piano', 'player', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'much', 'truth', 'value', 'do', 'know', 'Harmonists', 'were', 'real', 'group', 'music', 'was', 'much', 'appreciated', 'so', 'even', 'today', 'are', 'called', 'comedian', 'lighthearted', 'humorous', 'approach', 'music', 'sing.The', 'founder', 'group', 'jew', 'Harry', 'Frommermann', 'talented', 'singer/arranger', 'vision', 'bring', 'together', 'exceptional', 'group', 'men', 'sing', 'jazzed', 'up', 'highly', 'stylized', 'versions', 'popular', 'songs', 'Harry', 'perfectionist', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'first', 'cajoling', 'then', 'badgering', 'singers', 'develop', 'musically', 'unique', 'visually', 'entertaining', 'style', 'even', 'ambitious', 'dreams', 'Soon', 'Comedian', 'Harmonists', 'are', 'feature', 'act', 'demand', 'not', 'only', 'Germany', 'internationally.Unfortunatley', 'Harmonists', 'Hitler', 'power', '1933', 'just', 'group', 'headed', 'true', 'stardom', 'Jews', 'Germany', 'are', 'beginning', 'feel', 'impact', 'racial', 'hatred', 'will', 'end', 'holocaust', 'six', 'members', 'Harmonists', 'three', 'are', 'jews', 'story', 'first', 'restrictions', 'then', 'cancellations', 'concerts', 'prevent', 'group', 'finding', 'audience', 'Germany', 'work', 'head', 'New', 'York', 'find', 'success', 'there', 'Harry', 'would', 'like', 'remain', 'America', 'rest', 'band', 'still', 'chance', 'success', 'Germany', 'head', 'home', 'again.The', 'Harmonists', 'error', 'judgment', 'typical', 'mistake', 'many', 'jews', 'Germany', 'who', 'thought', 'only', 'needed', 'patiently', 'wait', 'reason', 'return', 'country', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'Harmonists', 'stage', 'Munich', 'performing', 'audience', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'being', 'lost', 'Harmonists', 'disband', 'jewish', 'members', 'escape', 'freedom', 'group', 'left', 'Germany', 'tries', 'reconstitute', 'band', 'group', 'do', 'not', 'experience', 'success', 'original', 'members.If', 'were', 'not', 'music', 'truly', 'first-rate', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'not', 'worth', 'four', 'stars', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'film', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'vocal', 'singing', 'very', 'best', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'unusual', 'film']",N/A
