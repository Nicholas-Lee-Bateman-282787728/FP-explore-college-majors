755253,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00009MGGI,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[3, 4]","This is the 1990s series (3 years x 4 episodes apiece) about a conniving politician, Francis Urquhart, who reaches the peak of British electoral politics and of course served as the inspiration for the more recent USA series starring Kevin Spacey, whose name was Americanized into ""Francis Underwood.""  Urquhart is a rock-solid Tory (Whip of the Conservative Party) who must struggle not only with his own party's infighting but the incursions of the opposition, the heritage of ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher, the consequences of his actions, and a new King with (to Urquhart) some unacceptably leftist ideas.  The quality of the acting is outstanding, especially Urquhart played by Ian Richardson.  Nudity and swearing are kept to a minimum until the final season.  Part of the fun lies in seeing how thinly-disguised versions of influential London newspapers like THE MIRROR and THE TELEGRAPH handle political scandal and the daily hurly of Parliament.  A remastering of the material makes the series available to North American audiences at a reasonble price.  Each season incudes one episode singled out for Commentary, which offers insight from the actors' point of view.  The only thing I regretted about this set was the largely irrelevant separate Features disc, which contains a short clip from a British chat show featuring the screenwriter, and an overlong documentary (1995) narrated by the late Tony Benn that examines the workings of Parliament from a physical point of view.

Watch as Francis Urquhart, party Whip, maneuvers his way into the Prime Ministership, using any means necessary including cleverly arranged scandals, media manipulation and seduction, and yes, even murder. But don't think Urquhart's wife is an innocent. She's his master plotter, the evil voice in his head. She's ambitious and drives her husband to succeed. The plots are complicated, their execution flawless, and Urquhart becomes Prime Minister. And all this is just Disk 1.On Disk 2, Urquhart, now Prime Minister, has a new foe, the new king who's intentions are better than his practicality or senses. Urquhart and his wife must use all their wiles, launch the most clever of scandals to put this king in his place. Or the English form of government may not survive. But now Urquhart has a new allie, a pretty bright young thing, whom again he is urged to bed by his scheming wife. But the plot begins to thicken as the girlfriend becomes suspicious how Urquhart gets the seemingly impossible advance knowledge he is exploiting.Disk 3 finds Urquhart standing longer in office than Margaret Thatcher, but is he about to crash? There's been another murder, and his girlfriend allies with his chief whip to investigate the murder Urguhart committed in the first disk. As his reign begins to unravel, his wife becomes concerned for her future and Urquhart's legacy.

755262,AMUTYOX234D90,B00009MGGI,Bill,"[44, 45]","This is an irresistible series, propelled forward by the exquisite winking-at-the-camera performance of Ian Richardson. Francis Urquhart provides a once-in-a-lifetime role for Richardson and he, exceptional actor that he is, makes the very most of it.In fact, he makes a truly evil character so attractive that you find yourself rooting for him against your better instincts. At least, that's true for the first episode, before the extent of his monstrous nature becomes apparent. One gets entirely caught up in the behind-the-scenes machinations of this man-who-would-be-prime-minister.The tone set by the first episode's shocking finish continues in ""To Play the King,"" a fine and exciting sequel. Francis Urquhart (his initials are used to comic effect in the drama's newspaper headlines) goes head-to-head with the King, obviously modeled on Prince Charles.The DVD for this installment has a bonus: An interview with writer Andrew Davies on the BBC. Judging by this segment, British talk show audiences aren't much higher on the IQ scale than their U.S. equivalents. Much of the audience is hostile to Davies -- who did extremely good work here (as he did on his more popular ""Pride and Prejudice"") -- because they entirely miss the show's ironic stance. It's great to have this extra feature, although a commentary track with Davies or Richardson (or both) would have been even better.Finally, the trilogy ends with ""The Final Cut."" The tone really shifts in this one, and I have to say it's the least successful installment. Richardson no longer seems to be enjoying himself as much, although perhaps it's just that he's portraying a much more tired Urquhart. The pace is slower, the suspense is a bit more contrived, and the new characters are less interesting. Still, it succeeds in bringing the series to a suitably dramatic close.If you're a fan of British drama or politics (or great acting, for that matter), don't hesitate.

I'm not one who finds politics compelling, but this series manages to draw you in to the ""games"" politicians love to play, in this case, with each other. There is absolutely nothing they won't do. They'll ruin marriages, set up the occasional ""necessary"" murder, and blackmail each other with explicit photos. Ian Richardson is at the heart of this drama as Francis Urquhart, the scheming British Prime Minister who loves to ""put a bit of stick about."" He's deliciously evil but throughout the series, I loathed his character. Really. He gets away with EVERYTHING. He's too smart and too clever and he's 100 steps in front of his enemies. Will his reign of terror ever end? That's really the kicker for this series: who has the guts to bring him down??? The writing for this series is brilliantly adapted by Andrew Davies who's talent also extends to other BBC productions like Vanity Fair, Pride and Prejudice, and Bleak House.

755279,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B00009MGGI,Chris Fung,"[31, 36]","This is without a doubt, one of the very best dramatic series I have ever seen.  Why on earth hasn't Masterpeice Theater replayed it?  Given what PBS has recently gone through with its governing board and accusations of ""liberal bias"", perhaps it's understandable that they don't want to be seen to be criticizing our political masters, but the point has already been made.  Why leave it up to mealy-mouthed special-effects fests like ""Retread of the Sith"", when works like this do so with so much more poise and precision?The House of Cards series combines superlative acting skills with pointed commentary on power, ambition and politics.  Three great scripts (I disagree with those who say Part 3 was weaker than the others, but more on this below), and superb directing and acting make this the highlight of my summer viewing for sure.  For US viewers, this series is as excellent as the Sopranos, and Homicide and for similar reasons (interesting characters, wonderful actors and compelling plot lines).*General spoiler alert*This series is many things to many people, but it is to my mind, first and foremost a Shakespearean drama.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies makes this quite clear in his discussions of the series.  To that end, the most important thing in the series is our villain and his arc from charming, ruthless monster to cornered animal.How sad that Ian Richardson hasn't been given the chance to display his incredible acting talents to a wider audience.  His portrayl of the caiman-like Conservative politician Francis Urquhart  captured the simultaneously mesmerizing and sheer evil quality of Urquhart beautifully (Richardson won a BAFTA in 1991 for House of Cards and was nominated again in 1993 for To Play the King, and again in 1996 for The Final Cut). Richardson's training in theater (he was with the Royal Shakespeare Company for 15 years) stand him in excellent stead here, but the most compelling pieces of acting he does are often expressed with no more than a glance at the camera, or a lifted eyebrow or corner of the mouth.  The man's a genius in my humble opinion.House of Cards has had an interesting effect on political behavior in the UK in particular. The non-denial denial ""You might say that... I couldn't possibly comment"" that was one of Urquhart's favorite catchphrases has become established usage among British public figures, including then-Prime Minister John Major.  It's also been acronymized for use in cyberspace as YMSTICPC.As a number of other people have pointed out, this series strongly evokes specific Shakespearean works, notably MacBeth, and Richard III.  There are however, echoes of other tragedies as well, particularly King Lear (Urquhart's soliloquy on being ""a father of daughters"" for one, and the use of the ""sharper than a serpent's tooth"" quotation) and Titus Andronicus (F.U.'s ease with violence, and the black humor throughout the series) particularly in Part 3 (The Final Cut).  I suppose if one wanted to play the ""match the series with the play"" game, Part 1 would be analogous to the first half of MacBeth, Part 2 to Richard  (up to the Battle of Bosworth), and Part 3 would be Lear with Act V of Richard thrown in for good measure.Thus the supposed ""weaknesses"" in F.U.'s behavior in Part 3: his tendency to surround himself with weaklings, his descent into open violence, and his inability to ""smell the mood"" of his colleagues can in fact be better understood as classic Shakespearean indicators of the ruler who has finally lost his edge through age, hubris or paranoia (or some combination of all 3).Much has been made of Mrs. Urquhart's similarity to Lady MacBeth, but she's really more like the homicidal Goneril in ""Lear"": None of Lady M's weak-kneed descent into madness for her.  In fact, the Tragedy of Francis Urquhart (apart from the mayhem he inflicts -indirectly depicted by the director for the most part, on the well-being of ordinary British people) might well be most clearly expressed in the treacherousness or self-servingness of those who surround him at the end.Some people believe that this series does not translate well for American audiences, my sense is that this is far from the case. Certainly some of the more subtle satire and the British cultural references might be lost, (such as the reference to the children's hand-puppet character Sooty - think Lamb Chop or Elmo as a stuffed bear) and it certainly helps to have a passing familiarity with British Parliamentary procedure (in particular the wonderful institution of ""Prime Minister's Question Time"").Nevertheless these are minor details in the overall scheme of things.  British politics has no monopoly on stupidity, manipulation or naked ambition.  Viewers in other countries will have no trouble recognizing their own domestic versions of F.U.,  some perhaps in their own workplaces.  Can we recognize this same behavior (admittedly with much less wit and sophistication) in some people in the current US administration? You might think that, you might very well think that, ... I couldn't possibly comment.",5,"""I am in blood, Stepp'd in so far...""",1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,5075,"['doubt', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'dramatic', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Why',

755280,ACJVGDN8G386P,B00009MGGI,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 1]","The public, be it in the United States, Europe or Britain, often see their political figures at press conferences or in front of large crowds offering endless platitudes through endless speeches. Occasionally, the public sees the interesting discourse which occurs during the Prime Ministers Questions in the British Parliament or the speeches made on the floor of the House or Senate in the United States. What the public doesn't see is the internal relationships between many of the key players, and how either great achievements or small missteps can either make or break promising careers. But most of all, we the public almost never hear the internal thoughts of political operatives.The BBC's &#34;House of Cards&#34; gives us something we probably will never be able to enjoy in real life: the actual thoughts of someone working within the most powerful circles in politics. Ian Richardson plays Francis Urquhart, the Whip of the British Conservative Party who has taken hold of Parliament and the seat of the Prime Minister after Margaret Thatcher. In politics, &#34;the Whip&#34; is typically an informal position in party politics designed to keep other party members in bounds. He is there for counsel but also for discipline. From the very first, Urquhart speaks directly to us, an unseen constituency who has been privileged to hear what a leading politician really thinks about his fellow colleagues and even his thoughts about the system itself. While outwardly, Urquhart supports all the members of his party, inwardly he tells us his thoughts about all the contenders to leadership, including how he views the present Prime Minister Henry Collingridge.Urquhart desires to influence the highest levels of his political party but seems uninterested in attaining the position of Prime Minister. As the Whip of his party, he must not only keep all elected party members in line but enact damage control if any member involves him or herself in behavior which could escalate into a scandal. To help, he allies himself with a young but precocious journalist, Mattie Storin, played brilliantly by Susannah Harker. The party Whip and the journalist form a strange but trust-worthy bond, a relationship almost like an uncle and niece. Urquhart believes by trusting someone in the press, he can at least have some influence on how the press handles the inner-workings and dealings in Parliament, be they success or failures.Most of the series involves the many behind-the-scenes shenanigans the public rarely sees, let alone knows about. While politicians always present a facade of cool confidence and determination, we see the men behind the curtains. Their weaknesses, doubts, and hypocrisies are laid bare as if we, the audience, have been allowed to sneak inside the corridors of power. For example, a party member is caught using party funds for a cocaine habit. The Whip decides to use political black-mail to acquire his full political support. In exchange he expunges his financial record but threatens exposure if the member/addict ever breaks out of line. Things begin to heat up when the journalist learns that private research reveals the Conversative Party is in trouble with the public and must decide if there will be an internal coup d'etat.A thoroughly compelling, excellently acted series which paved the way for the West Wing almost 10 years later. However, unlike &#34;the West Wing&#34;, the main players are revealed as being all-too human. The Prime Minister has his doubts in the face of dwindling public support which is fueled by the exposure of a scandal. And the Whip begins to realize, partly with the help of the young journalist, that he may be underrating his own leadership qualities.If there is anything we can glean from &#34;House of Cards&#34;, it is as the title suggests. Politics is a house of cards, a game of subtlety, delicacy and intense strategy. Players must make their moves slowly, with precision and deftness.

755281,A2CISZ4JLKQRJA,B00009MGGI,C. Richard,"[2, 3]","I watched the first season of the Netflix/American/Kevin Spacey version of this series and though it was great. Looking forward to watching the second season when released in a few weeks. Wasn't sure how the original/British version would be, but I like British TV, so I gave the first episode a try and was hooked. There are some similarities, but they both stand on their own as great programs if you ask me.The main character here, Francis Urquhart (called FU for short - the Brits have a good sense of humor there), gets passed over for promotion and decides to get revenge. Ruthless, period. But, he seems to have some sense of duty to the country at the same time - well, if you are a Labor supporter, you won't be pleased with what that means.I found myself rooting for him because he is so brilliant at manipulating everyone/everything around him. He commits a few murders along the way - very hands on there - but is bothered by them to some extent. Lots of twists and turns and the final ending in part 3 is a total surprise. Horrible,  but somehow the only way it could have ended &#34;well&#34; for FU.This was made a long time ago, and they did not imagine the royal succession quite as it turned out for real. For example, the Princess Diana character - they never call her by name, but you know it is her - is around to see here son made King. They &#34;dispose&#34; of his father quite quickly.The guy who plays FU is the same guy who plays the butler in BAPS, believe it or not.

The first episode was a bit slow, but by the second installment of House of Cards, I was completely hooked. I literally stayed up all night watching Francis Urquhart out-Machiavelli Machiavelli.The House of Cards Trilogy is not, as many seem to think, a critique of the Conservative Party. It is a critique of Machiavellian politics of any stripe. Over the course of the trilogy, the drama delivers a clear Macbeth-style warning against the dangers of unbridled ambition--and against those for whom the means is justified by the end. Ian Richardson's performance as Francis Urquhart, a man who will stop at nothing to gain power, is absolutely brilliant. Witty, sly, and supremely self-controlled, he utterly captures the screen and glues you to it. Together with his wife, Elizabeth, who is a perfect Lady Macbeth, they comprise the ideal villain--unscrupulous, cunning, manipulative, and without a shred of conscience. Almost. By the end of the trilogy, Urquhart's misdeeds have come back to haunt him, but it is too late. He is on a path that cannot be abandoned. ""I am steeped in blood so far,"" he says.

755300,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00009MGGI,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[12, 13]","House of Cards, a BBC production done at the time of Margaret Thatcher's downfall, is one of the best modern political intrigue/satires done. The cast, the story, and the exacting attention to detail make this a piece worth watching and re-watching, to see what details escaped notice the first time.The PlotAs the story opens, Thatcher has just resigned. There is a brief glimpse of an inner-party election for a new leader, and the moderate, middle candidate Henry Collingridge wins the post, and proceeds to barely win the next General Election. Almost immediately following this event, tempers begin to flare as Urqhart is denied the promotion he had sought, and is disgusted with Collingridge's 'politics as usual' stance.Francis Urqhart, Conservative Party whip and functionary, with the unwitting assistance of a junior political reporter Mattie Storin, and the manipulated support of party functionary Roger O'Neill, sets out to undo the Prime Minister, involving the PM in scandals that rock his fragile majority and ever-loosening grip on power. Ultimately, Urqhart's schemes against Collingridge bring the PM down, and the stage is set for another leadership election.Urqhart, at the urging of his wife Elizabeth, works toward the leadership and works toward solidifying the loyalties of his minions, who include the ruffian Tim Stamper, an associate whip in the Commons, and Benjamin Landless, a newspaper proprietor. However, it is in making Storin his bedroom partner and virtual worshipper that Urqhart has his strongest support; this support is not absolute, something he recognises. This relationship is done with the blessing, nay, with the urging, of his wife Elizabeth.Urqhart uses his inside knowledge to make short work of all but the top contenders for the job, and then casts his lot for the job at the last moment, splitting the ticket. Knocking one contender against another one final time, Urqhart carries the election. However, O'Neill is unstable and unsure of the propriety of his dealings in bringing down Collingridge, and Storin realises at the last moment that she has been a pawn in a master political chess game. O'Neill's cocaine problem leads to his demise, as Urqhart plants poison in his drugs and permits O'Neill's nature to do him in. Storin discovers this murder plot, and confronts Urqhart, who confesses, but then proceeds to throw Mattie Storin bodily from the roof of the House of Commons.But, there was a tape recorder running, setting the stage for the sequel...`To Play the King' is the sequel, in which Urqhart matches forces against the newly installed King, played by Michael Kitchen.  The King sees himself as the champion of the underdog and underclass Urqhart has abandoned, and it is a literal battle royale to the end.  Storin has been replaced by Sarah Harding, who finds Urqhart is more than a match for her minor turncoating as well.Finally, `The Final Cut' brings things full circle, as Urqhart beats Thatcher's record of unbroken days in office.  However, his lust for power drives him into reckless foreign affairs, and his wife comes into her own with scheming beyond measure.The CastIan Richardson is masterful as Urqhart, the scheming blackheart Chief Whip/Prime Minister. His voice, his subtle inflections and tones are perfect for the subtext in the words he speaks. His sidewise glances and knowing expressions to camera as the action plays out is worth far more than any words. He is a perfect snobbish, upper-class politico who considers political office as patrician right, and despises pretenders to the role.Diane Fletcher is superb as Elizabeth Urqhart, the equally manipulative wife. She is under utilised in this part of the trilogy, coming into her own as a character and an actress in later parts of the trilogy. One gets the strong sense of muted ambition and greed, but not amorality or power for power's sake from her, a distinction hard to play out on video. Fletcher succeeds beautifully.Susannah Harker plays Mattie Storin, the troubled, intelligent and inexperienced journalist who falls for Urqhart. Her psychological instability and intelligence are played beautifully. Harker can make quite a statement just with the movements of her eyes, making her a good counterpoint to Richardson.Miles Anderson plays the drug addict/party operative Roger O'Neill, doing a good job at playing the cad, the coward, and the fearful go-along with Urqhart's schemes. A rat trapped, O'Neill is at the breaking point, and Anderson plays this admirably.Perhaps the best secondary roles were performed by Alphonsia Emmanuel, who plays O'Neill's assistant and lover Penny Guy, and James Villiers, who plays Charles Collingridge, the deposed Prime Minister's troubled brother. Their roles shine brilliantly despite the relative lack of screen time.In the second series, Michael Kitchen as the King and Kitty Aldridge as Sarah Harding take primary roles, and Colin Jeavons as Stamper repeats his performance of the earlier episode, this time with much more panache.  In the third series, Isla Blair as Claire Carlsen and Paul Freeman make a good show, if not altogether convincing as the final opponents for Urqhart.One gets the impression that everyone in British politics is brilliant and troubled. Well, the truth would be about half that.The Play's the Thing...This production, in writing and execution, is full of Shakespearean nuances. There are indirect and direct references to Richard III, and Urqhart is a Machiavellian manipulator in the Duke of Gloucester's image, recast for modern dress and situation, complete with stage whispers and asides to audience. The depth of the characters, while still remaining caricatures, is fascinating. Perhaps the best-known line for a while was Urqhart's attempts to get information out to the journalist Storin without actually telling her, and being guilty (by the letter of the law) for leaks and disclosures. She would hint and speculate, at which Urqhart would reply, `You might very well think that. I of course couldn't possibly comment.'John Major used this response in one of his own question-time exchanges, a use that was appreciated by the Members on both sides of the House.ConclusionsFor those who know nothing of British politics, this is actually a fascinating way to learn. For those who take an interest in British politics, this provides an intriguing fictional tale that is, in many ways, so close to reality on so many levels as to be positively unnerving.Richardson rightly won BAFTA awards for his portrayal of Urqhart in each of the three installments, House of Cards and its sequels To Play the King and The Final Cut. These sequels were possibly only because of a BBC change to Dobbs' original manuscript, which had Urqhart rather than Storin falling from the rooftop garden of the House of Commons.A bonus for the

755301,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B00009MGGI,F. S. L'hoir,"[13, 14]","What if Shakespeare's Lord and Lady Macbeth had been temporally transported into twenty-first century Britain? They would certainly be reincarnated into the insidious Francis Urquhart and his formidable spouse Elizabeth. In their new personae, 'MacUrquhart' would still be haunted by guilty visions but would shed any qualms about committing murder in the interests of power, and 'Lady MacUrquhart' would waste no more time sleepwalking but sustain her role as the actual but invisible control over the man with titular authority.The ""House of Cards Trilogy,"" which includes ""To Play the King"" and ""Final Cut,"" not only portrays such a ghastly scenario, but also demonstrates the disastrous consequences for a post-modern Britain when such a pair first insinuates itself into a position of power and then seizes and maintains an unrelenting grip on that power, even if, in the final analysis, it has to provoke a bloody war to do so. Thanks to Andrew Davies' darkly comedic script, Ian Richardson's brilliant portrayal of Francis, and a splendid supporting cast, the viewer is locked in suspense and held in a state somewhere between laughing and cringing at the political shenanigans, too many of which resound with an uncomfortable ring of contemporary probability.The humor derives from Richardson as Francis, who ruptures the invisible barrier between illusion and reality by taking the audience into his confidence. In ""House of Cards"" he does this with such wry wit that viewers are drawn easily into his thrall, so much so that despite their better natures and common sense, they find themselves liking and identifying with this charming unapologetic scoundrel. Somewhere in the middle of ""To Play the King,"" however, they realize, to their increasing horror, that by sharing in his most intimate thoughts, they have actually become co-conspirators in the machinations of Urquhart, who in a literal blink of the eye transforms congeniality into the mesmerizing malevolence of a king cobra. By the time they have become absorbed in the plot of ""Final Cut,"" they are inextricably tied to Urquhart's fate, as on a runaway train. Thus the scenario becomes metaphorical for the public's unfortunate propensity to be seduced by plausible but unscrupulous politicians who draw them into situations that they might not realize are unsupportable until it is too late. The repeated use in ""To Play the King"" of Urquhart's initials, F.U., illustrates this proposition.The late Ian Richardson's ability to keep the audience enthralled in the destiny of this despicable rogue testifies to his incomparable subtlety as an actor, who will be sorely missed. The lynchpin of the tale, Richardson is amply supported by an ensemble cast, including Diane Fletcher as his horrific wife; Colin Jeavens as Tim Stamper, his `whip' who wields 'a bit of stick'; Nicholas Grace as Stamper's toadying successor, Geoffrey Booza-Pitt; and Nick Brimble as the sinister Corder. Among Urquhart's memorable victims are Michael Kitchen as the well-meaning king, Susanna Harker as the unstable Mattie Storrin, Kitty Aldrich as the altruistic Sarah, to name only a few. All characters in this cautionary tale are vulnerable to the enticements of power, even those who begin as honest idealists. When Corder informs the nobly motivated Tom Makepeace, who eventually succeeds Urquhart as leader of the party, that ""we""--meaning Corder, Elizabeth, and the rest--are ""right behind"" him, one understands the story's message that all politicians, even those with the best of motives, are liable to being corrupted absolutely by the acquisition of absolute power.",5,From the Bottom of the Deck!,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,3626,"['What', 'Shakespeare', 'Lord', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'had', 'been', 'temporally', 'transported', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Britain', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'reincarnated', 'insidious', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'formidable', 'spouse', 'Elizabeth', 'new', 'personae', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'haunted', 'guilty', 'visions', 'would', 'shed', 'qualms', 'committing', 'murder', 'interests', 'power', ""'Lady"", 'MacUrquhart', 'would', 'waste', 'more', 'time', 'sleepwalking', 'sustain', 'role', 'actual', 'invisible', 'control', 'man', 'titular', 'authority.The', 'House', 'Cards', 'Trilogy', 'Play', 'King', 'Final', 'Cut', 'not', 'only', 'ghastly', 'scenario', 'also', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'post-modern', 'Britain', 'when', 'pair', 'first', 'position', 'power', 'then', 'seizes', 'unrelenting', 'grip', 'power', 'even', 'final', 'analysis', 'provoke', 'bloody', 'war', 'do', 'so', 'Thanks', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'script', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Francis', 'splendid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'viewer', 'locked', 'suspense', 'held', 'state', 'somewhere', 'laughing', 'cringing', 'political', 'shenanigans', 'too', 'many', 'resound', 'uncomfortable', 'ring', 'contemporary', 'probability.The', 'humor', 'Richardson', 'Francis', 'who', 'invisible', 'barrier', 'illusion', 'reality', 'taking', 'audience', 'confidence', 'House', 'Cards', 'such', 'wry', 'wit', 'viewers', 'are', 'drawn', 'easily', 'thrall', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'natures', 'common', 'sense', 'find', 'liking', 'identifying', 'charming', 'unapologetic', 'scoundrel', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'Play', 'King', 'however', 'realize', 'increasing', 'horror', 'sharing', 'most', 'intimate', 'thoughts', 'have', 'actually', 'become', 'co-conspirators', 'machinations', 'Urquhart', 'who', 'literal', 'blink', 'eye', 'congeniality', 'mesmerizing', 'malevolence', 'king', 'cobra', 'time', 'have', 'become', 'absorbed', 'plot', 'Final', 'Cut', 'are', 'inextricably', 'tied', 'Urquhart', 'fate', 'runaway', 'train', 'Thus', 'scenario', 'metaphorical', 'public', 'unfortunate', 'propensity', 'be', 'seduced', 'plausible', 'unscrupulous', 'politicians', 'who', 'draw', 'situations', 'might', 'not', 'realize', 'are', 'unsupportable', 'too', 'late', 'repeated', 'use', 'Play', 'King', 'Urquhart', 'initials', 'F.U.', 'proposition.The', 'late', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'ability', 'keep', 'audience', 'enthralled', 'destiny', 'despicable', 'rogue', 'testifies', 'incomparable', 'subtlety', 'actor', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed', 'lynchpin', 'tale', 'Richardson', 'amply', 'supported', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Diane', 'Fletcher', 'horrific', 'wife', 'Colin', 'Jeavens', 'Tim', 'Stamper', 'whip', 'who', 'wields', 'bit', 'stick', 'Nicholas', 'Grace', 'Stamper', 'toadying', 'successor', 'Geoffrey', 'Booza-Pitt', 'Nick', 'Brimble', 'sinister', 'Corder', 'Urquhart', 'memorable', 'victims', 'are', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'well-meaning', 'king', 'Susanna', 'Harker', 'unstable', 'Mattie', 'Storrin', 'Kitty', 'Aldrich', 'altruistic', 'Sarah', 'name', 'only', 'few', 'characters', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'enticements', 'power', 'even', 'who', 'begin', 'honest', 'idealists', 'When', 'Corder', 'nobly', 'motivated', 'Tom', 'Makepeace', 'who', 'eventually', 'Urquhart', 'leader', 'party', 'meaning', 'Corder', 'Elizabeth', 'rest', 'are', 'right', 'behind', 'one', 'story', 'message', 'politicians', 'even', 'best', 'motives', 'are', 'liable', 'being', 'corrupted', 'absolutely', 'acquisition', 'absolute', 'power']",N/A

This series portray politicians and political operatives to be the conniving, heartless, and manipulative bastards that they are.  It's incredibly realistic, sarcastic, darkly hilarious, viscerally intelligent, and honest.  There isn't a false moment in the whole thing.  Francis Uckhart (F.U. as he is affectionately known) is a conservative MP who eventually becomes prime minister.  He does through different machinations, such as flattery, cunning, blackmail (mostly), and occasionally murder.  You don't really hate his character, because everyone else in the series is aiming for the same thing, and they are as nasty as he is.  He's certainly the most charming and interesting of all the characters here, and it's to Ian Richardson's credit for giving such a great performance that you kind of like F.U., even though he's really a vile bastard at heart.  But then, the world of politics is treated here like the morally ambiguous cesspool it is, instead of the idealized crap you get on The West Wing (one character, Stamper, even says it's like crawling through a tunnel of excrement).  How many times do you hear characters on The West Wing give a variation of the ""we don't get along.  But let's put our personal differences aside and do what's best for the country.""?  What a pile of crap.  Polticial operatives are some of the most unscrupulous and sadistic bastards on the planet.  If they are starry idealists, they quickly disappear.

The preceding and following interactions between the needs of governing, personal ambition, money, corporate influence and a tainted media all join in a hilarious and terrifying Danse Macabre. Presented with such dark and furious glee, the story lines, subplots, acting, casting and surgically-lit observations of character combine for moments of the blackest comedy and the most tragic drama. It's easy to understand why such a view of the political system would never have a U.S. equivalent: it comes way too close to the truth of things for Joe n' Jolene Voter.That's because the greed, divisive partisanship, set-in-stone ideology and hubris on display here is only barely fiction. From ""nothing like starting your own little war to see a lift in the polls"" to defining freedom in business terms, manipulating the press from both ends and shutting off assistance to the poor and needy, good ol' Francis Urquhart -- affectionately known as F.U. -- may seem strangely strange, yet oddly familiar.While it's imperative to pay attention to the day-to-day details of our own government's action and inaction, nothing is as effective in communicating the dismal and all too human antics of politicians as wrapping up all the specifics with a keenly observed, nuanced and entertaining summary of what makes these folks tick. Which is to say cap ""P"" power or, as F.U. puts it, ""The getting of it, and the holding on....""Regardless of the age, era or epoch, ""House of Cards"" nails it.

Politics is treacherous intercourse between any man and any other person, any woman and any other human with only one objective: to seize power, to retain power, to ""make history"" as if they could, not understanding that power is illusive and evasive, and history is not made by anything or anybody because history is and nothing else. What makes it is unknown of everybody. Big Ben here is only to dictate the time of the beginning of each episode, 9:22 a.m.The general idea is that a plain apparatchik of the conservative party manages to push aside the successor to Margaret Thatcher, the longest-serving peace time Prime Minister, who was too weak for the job, and he becomes nothing but the brute of the job who uses young women to get his inspiration, kills them as soon as they could become dangerous, and is in fact entirely manipulated by his own wife, a new Lady Macbeth who even manages to make him confront the new king and force him to abdicate.What's the best part of it is that it is thrilling to follow the actions of this apprentice sorcerer and to see how he manages any situation to his own advantage and yet is heading right into the wall because to succeed too long becomes dangerous for your own health in the British system where only the sovereign can last long because he or she is not supposed to play politics. It is thrilling because we know the only end can be his failure when the wall of success will become so hard that he will have to be eliminated for the simple survival of the political system.Yet you will learn only in the very last scene who the manipulator of it all is and what his or/and her intention is too. And it is true the series is intelligent enough and well enough done that you cannot know who that manipulator is though we see his/her black gloves at crucial moments but the episode systematically mislead you to believing it (he/she) is someone else.The series is also a very good criticism of British democracy based on the free press that is as free as a tornado in a narrow and deep gorge between two very high mountains. The press is in fact on a very short leash: make money with news and make the news if necessary to make money, like Citizen Kane used to say. Parliament is an amazing maze of corridors and staircases, a comfortable bar and a House of Commons with only one interesting session, Questions to the Prime Minister, every week or maybe more often. This Parliament is a farce in many ways, at best a circus for gladiators who have no right to kill one another but who can bruise their own and respective egos in all possible ways.It is so easy to make the public believe what you want them to believe when you can pull the strings that hold the press. And then you can always manage someone to get killed here and there, now and then, who is embarrassing or annoying the big masters.I am so glad I am not engulfed in such an ugly activity. And yet I am sorry everyday because of them because they terrorize my own life all the time with their own caprices and incompetence.

One can't help but compare the dueling Francis characters, here played by Ian Richardson.....and the hard part is trying to figure out who's better.  Ian Richardson is one of those classic British actors, full of arrogance and sleekness, condescending to a fault.  But he radiates intelligence and confidence such that you tend to fall on his side of things.House of Cards UK is the rise and....continued rise of Francis Urquhart MP, the Chief Whip in the first few (of 12) episodes, rising to power after some well timed machinations that make you wonder what took him so long to get around to it (Francis starts the series in his mid-50's).  The series is told in three parts of four episodes each.  The first details Francis as Chief Whip, his enemies not realizing that they've made a foe out of him, even after the fact by and large.  It's very political and backroom, and works all the better for both.  The second is Francis v. King (Charles, though the show scrupulously never names him), and one has to wonder if John Major watched this set of episodes (shown in 1993) and went &#34;Hmmmm&#34;.  It's politician v. royal, and again it's difficult to know who to root for.  The third is the final gasp of power, where many characters act in self righteous ways simply because they can, and some artful twists at the end liven things up.It's hard to comment on the acting, besides Richardson, because so few of the performers are anything but weak foils against him.  The devil does get the best tunes of course, but in this show he gets pretty much all of them.  You have to wonder if the teleplay was written specifically for Richardson and to be a vehicle for him (all the shows are based on a series of novels by Michael Dobbs).  Don't get me wrong, the now passed away actor ably dominated the screen, and justly won awards for it......but I'm knocking the star off simply because he was the only one I got to know well enough to care about.I tend to think that Americans will prefer &#34;our&#34; version of the show, and Kevin Spacey, while Brits will doubtlessly favor theirs.

I really enjoyed the original version, and found it much darker, funnier, and ultimately more provocative than the American re-birth.Ian Richardson is the devil incarnate as Francis Urquhart, chief whip for the ruling Conservatives.  The age of Thatcher has come to an end, and when FU (as he is affectionately known in the tabloid press and by his loyal subordinates) is slighted a cabinet position he mischievously and morbidly undertakes a campaign to undermine the new Prime Minister.  In his mischief, he is aided by a naive but ambitious young political reporter with a daddy complex as well as a press secretary with a cocaine problem.  The parallels to the Netflix version are immediate and obvious, and it's interesting to compare and contrast the two series.By season two, FU has ascended to the PM position, and he rules essentially a one-party state dictatorship that now and then offers a chance to the people to vote for the one party.  State surveillance is widespread, and everyone is spied upon, especially FU's main adversary -- the newly ascended king, who has issues with how FU, his cronies, and their ilk are getting rich at the expense of the British people.  He begins a tour of compassion, a word that makes FU both disgusted and contemptuous, but also a word that finally forces FU to act.  Season two is immensely watchable, but it is also macabre and outrageous -- and I suspect that David Fincher will choose to depart from the ""To Play the King"" storyline, and chart another course for his Netflix series.While season one and season two were both immensely watchable and compelling, season three is neither.  By now, FU is firmly in control, and we are tired of him killing people and creating all sorts of mischief and getting away from it.  Once a funny, irreverent, and mischievous villain is now just an old fart, and the stakes are not just low but irrelevant (honestly, who cares what happens in Cyprus?).  Whatever creative juices and animus Michael Dobbs had in creating the House of Cards series of books is now gone, and what's left a story that just needs to be ended.  And it finally does end, and it ends like it always does -- with FU getting his way, and escaping the justice that he deserves.The House of Cards is a relentless indictment of the British political system, created by a man disillusioned and disgusted by Thatcherism in the UK:  the greed, the oppression, and the brutality.  Of course, things have gotten only much much worse in the UK, and we can only wonder if the Americans with have the courage and the audacity to go as far as the original BBC series.",4,Provocative and Funny,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2822,"['most', 'recent', 'viewers', 'BBC', 'trilogy', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Netflix', 'series', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'what', 'future', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'version', 'found', 'much', 'darker', 'funnier', 'ultimately', 'more', 'provocative', 'American', 're-birth.Ian', 'Richardson', 'devil', 'incarnate', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'chief', 'whip', 'ruling', 'Conservatives', 'age', 'Thatcher', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'FU', 'affectionately', 'known', 'tabloid', 'press', 'loyal', 'subordinates', 'slighted', 'cabinet', 'position', 'mischievously', 'morbidly', 'campaign', 'undermine', 'new', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'mischief', 'aided', 'naive', 'ambitious', 'young', 'political', 'reporter', 'daddy', 'complex', 'as', 'well', 'press', 'secretary', 'cocaine', 'problem', 'parallels', 'Netflix', 'version', 'are', 'immediate', 'obvious', 'interesting', 'compare', 'contrast', 'two', 'series.By', 'season', 'two', 'FU', 'ascended', 'PM', 'position', 'rules', 'essentially', 'one-party', 'state', 'dictatorship', 'now', 'then', 'chance', 'people', 'vote', 'one', 'party', 'State', 'surveillance', 'widespread', 'everyone', 'spied', 'especially', 'FU', 'main', 'adversary', 'newly', 'ascended', 'king', 'who', 'issues', 'how', 'FU', 'cronies', 'ilk', 'are', 'getting', 'rich', 'expense', 'British', 'people', 'tour', 'compassion', 'word', 'FU', 'disgusted', 'contemptuous', 'also', 'word', 'finally', 'FU', 'act', 'Season', 'two', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'also', 'macabre', 'outrageous', 'suspect', 'David', 'Fincher', 'will', 'choose', 'depart', 'Play', 'King', 'storyline', 'chart', 'course', 'Netflix', 'series.While', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'were', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'compelling', 'season', 'three', 'now', 'FU', 'firmly', 'control', 'are', 'tired', 'killing', 'people', 'creating', 'sorts', 'mischief', 'getting', 'away', 'Once', 'funny', 'irreverent', 'mischievous', 'villain', 'now', 'just', 'old', 'fart', 'stakes', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'low', 'irrelevant', 'honestly', 'who', 'what', 'Cyprus', 'creative', 'juices', 'animus', 'Michael', 'Dobbs', 'had', 'creating', 'House', 'Cards', 'series', 'books', 'now', 'gone', 'what', 'left', 'story', 'just', 'be', 'ended', 'finally', 'end', 'always', 'FU', 'getting', 'way', 'escaping', 'justice', 'House', 'Cards', 'relentless', 'indictment', 'British', 'political', 'system', 'created', 'man', 'disillusioned', 'disgusted', 'Thatcherism', 'UK', 'greed', 'oppression', 'brutality', 'course', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'only', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'UK', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'Americans', 'have', 'courage', 'audacity', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'original', 'BBC', 'series']",N/A

At first FU seems to be giving us a friendly tour of the British governmental process with a sympathetic eye for the troubles of his PM, but then slowly but surely, he reveals the knives he proceeds to plunge into the backs of all his rivals.  He's charming but brutally direct as he takes step after step, including a couple of murders, towards 10 Downing Street.To Play The King is my favorite of the series.  FU has to deal with an idealistic young king who disapproves of his hardline conservative policies.  Even though we know FU will win in the end, we hope for his downfall while simultaneously cheering his audacity.  FU is as charming as ever, even when he's at his vilest and most murderous.The Final Cut is the weakest of the three because FU is more of a victim than a villain during most of it.  At the end we are sorry to see FU go even while we are relieved that his murderous ways are at last at an end.  And, most intriguingly, we see his successor, supposedly a reformer but possibly already taking on the FU mold. (Unfortunately no one seems to have considered carrying on the story by chronicling his successor's PMship.An interesting footnote to this series has to do with the books they were based upon.

The late and much missed Ian Richardson is superb as Urquhart, letting the audience in on his wicked plans as he wrecks lives and careers with not a smidgeon of remorse. Just as unscrupulous, though less obviously so until the end of the trilogy, is Urquhart's wife Elizabeth, such a wonderfully understated performance by Diane Fletcher that you will find yourself going back through the set to check that she really did say or do what you thought she did.It's rare that brilliant writing is matched by equally magnificent acting, but that's what you'll find in this set. The ensemble cast is top-rate, especially Michael Kitchen, of Foyle's War, doing an immediately identifiable impersonation of a certain Royal figure in 'To Play The King'.

755330,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00009MGGI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Like so many, I was caught up in recent months with Netflix's buzzy new drama ""House of Cards"" featuring a terrific Kevin Spacey.  Based on the incredible British series of the same name, it made we want to revisit this classic of political intrigue and cunning power plays.  The original series ""House of Cards"" was made in 1990 and is something I absolutely loved upon initial viewing.  So it was interesting to take a look back with this compilation after so many years AND after checking out the American interpretation.  Aside from making me feel old (1990, really?), this complex adult production makes you consider everything that is right with TV when we're not pandering to the lowest common denominator.  A show that rewards patience and intelligence, there is a reason this enduring drama is still so relevant (both in terms of its political candor and in its refusal to play it safe).  So I really encourage anyone who has not seen the original ""House of Cards"" to check it out, especially if you've fallen in love with the new one.  The wicked sense of humor underlying the entire series is one of its strongest selling points, it's merciless!This recent BBC 4-disc release has been remastered in its presentation.  Although I have not owned a prior version, I would say that this copy looks decent enough (if not spectacular).  It is, after all, a television production from the nineties.  It compiles the three miniseries releases that make up the entire ""House of Cards"" collection with some bonus features.Bonus: Audio Commentary, Tour of Parliament, and an Andrew Davies interview (he won an Emmy for the screenplay of this adaptation of Michael Dobbs' novels).House of Cards (1990):  These four episodes introduce a stellar (and award winning) Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart, the Conservative Party Chief Whip in Parliament.  Having played an integral part in keeping the administration intact, he is shocked when he is passed over for his expected promotion.  It is not something that he takes lightly, and the plotting begins.  A genius of manipulation and machination, he sets up his rivals to regain the upper hand.  His stealthy and unscrupulous maneuvering through the political arena will have an unaccountably high toll for anyone that crossed him.  And as he rises again, the house of cards will surely topple.To Play The King (1993):  In this second series of four episodes, Richardson is sitting squarely on the throne.  He is displeased, however, to still have to do someone else's bidding.  Michael Kitchen steps into a pivotal position as ""The King"" and much of the screenplay focuses on the constant power struggle between the two stubborn men.  In addition to the challenges posed by this more liberal monarch, Richardson is also contending with some unpleasant skeletons that want to pop right out of his closet!The Final Cut (1995):  The last four episodes revisit Richardson as he approaches the twilight of his political career.  He finds himself not only struggling to maintain his position, but to also leave a legacy befitting his station in life.  With scandals emerging on domestic soil, Richardson turns his attention to an international stage to help retain his hold on the party at any cost.

755337,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B00009MGGI,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 2]","At long last I have finally gotten the chance to sit down and watch the trilogy of miniseries's known simply as the House Of Cards trilogy. Based on the novel trilogy by UK author Michael Dobbs the three miniseries's (House Of Cards, To Play The King and The Final Cut) detail the rise and fall of Francis Urquhart, a politician of the UK's Conservative Party played by the late, great Ian Richardson. To help you the reader decide if you'd like to purchase this DVD box-set here are reviews of all three parts of the trilogy.House Of Cards:I'm a sucker for both British television and political thrillers in general. So having heard much about this miniseries, the first of a trilogy of miniseries's, I have been looking forward to seeing this for some time. Having seen it, I found that my expectations have not only been reached but surpassed as well. House Of Cards is one of the finest examples of the political thriller that you are likely to see anywhere.If there is any single element that makes this miniseries as much of a success as it is, it is lead character,  Francis Urquhart as played by actor Ian Richardson. Richardson plays Urquhart as a modern day (modern day being an alternate version of late 1980's or early 1990's UK) version of Shakespeare's Richard III. Urquhart is a  man who,as  the Chief Whip who feels unappreciated by the Prime Minister he helped to elect, sets out to bring down the Prime Minister, and then take the job of for himself. Like Richard III, Urquhart does this by laying out traps, rumors and blackmail while all the while delivering soliloquies to the audience relaying them to us the viewer. For all intents and purposes, Urquhart is a man we should hate as he does all of those things. Yet it is Richardson makes this work incredibly well and makes Urquhart a man who is ruthless yet immensely charming and likeable nonetheless. It is a compliment to Richardson and his skills that he can make it all work, especially the soliloquies, while being evil yet charming all at the same time.Backing Richardson is a fine supporting cast  as well. There's Diane Fletcher as Urquhart's wife who, like Lady Macbeth, pushed her husband and his plans along which makes her a character that is almost as fascinating as her husband. There's Susannah Harker as the young, attractive reporter Mattie Storin who begins using Urquhart as a source before they start going in a dangerous direction which leads to an incredible finale. There's Miles Anderson as Roger O'Neill and Alphonsia Emmanuel as his girlfriend Penny Guy who both end up snared by Urquhart's traps and end up victims of that. There's Colin Jeavons as Urquhart's protege Tim Stamper who has a marvelously sleazy feel to him. Last but not least there's David Lyon as the targeted Prime Minister Henry Collingridge and James Villiers as his brother Charles, who end's up being part of  Urquhart's plans. Theses are only a few of those amongst others in what is a fine cast backing a great leading man.House Of Cards is also blessed with fine production values as well. There's some fine production design by Ken Ledsham who creates the worlds ranging from the Houses of Parliament, 10 Downing Street, press rooms and beyond. There's the cinematography of Jim Fyans and Ian Punter which brings a fine sense of atmosphere and shadows to the world of the miniseries. There's also the music by Jim Parker, especially with the main title and end title pieces which serve as a perfect start and closing to the four episodes of the miniseries. All of this, under the direction of Paul Seed, makes for some fine production values to the miniseries.Last but not least is the script. Andrew Davies adapts Michael Dobbs novel into a fine political thriller about the effect of power on one man and how far he will go to gain power. There is a definite Richard III vibe running throughout the entire miniseries as Urquhart decides to seize power and begins to lay plans to do so. As a consequence, the plot can get fairly complex at time with Urquhart playing numerous plans at once which will require the viewer to pay just a bit more then perhaps they usually would. Also, Davies knows how to write fine dialogue especially for Urquhart including the famous line ""You may think that, but I couldn't possibly comment."" The script never fails to deliver right up to the shocking finale.House Of Cards is a fine example of what the political thriller can be. From the performance of Ian Richardson as Urquhart, the performances of the supporting cast, good production values and a fantastic script as well. It is a complex story with a complex protagonist that takes a look at power and its ability to corrupt and how far one will go to achieve it and is a fine one at that.5/5To Play The King:Francis Urquhart has risen through the ranks of Britain's Conservative Party and its political ranks to become Prime Minister. Now a new King is being crowned who stands opposed to everything Urquhart stands for. What happens when a liberally minded King and a conservative Prime Minister meet head to head in a battle for control of the UK's political life? That is the question that lies at the heart of To Play The King, the second miniseries in the House Of Cards trilogy.Like its predecessor, if  there is any single element that makes this miniseries as much of a success as it is, it is lead character,  Francis Urquhart as played by actor Ian Richardson. Richardson plays Urquhart as a modern day (modern day being an alternate version of early 1990's UK) version of Shakespeare's Richard III as much as he did originally. Urquhart might be at the top, but he's determined to stay there at whatever cost as he tries first to use and then do battle with the King. Yet we begin to see the human side of this man as he haunted by the events at the end of House Of Cards and must face the possibility of treason by those closest to him. Once again, Richardson makes all this work incredibly well and makes Urquhart a man who is ruthless yet immensely charming and likeable nonetheless. It is a compliment to Richardson and his skills that he can make it all work, especially the soliloquies, while being evil yet charming all at the same time.Opposing Urquhart is the new King played by actor Michael Kitchen. Kitchen's King is a  likeable, charming liberally minded monarch who wants to use his place in the nation to help improve his country. When any and all of his ideas are tossed aside, the king is forced into a head to head confrontation with the Prime Minister. Kitchen plays the King as a man of principle who is really a simple man. In fact it his the King hopes that right equals might in taking on Urquhart that makes him a perfect antagonist and a worthy opponent indeed.Backing both Richardson and Kitchen is once again a fine supporting cast. Returning from House Of Cards are Diane Fletcher as Urquhart's wife plus  Colin Jeavons as Tim Stamper, who finds himself increasingly compromised and frustrated by Urquhart, who both give strong performances. Kitty Aldridge joins the cast as Sarah Harding who becomes a communications aide to Urquhart and while she gives a good performance, the relationship between her and Urquhart pushed believability in my mind. There's also Nicholas Farrell and Rowena King as the King's aides David Mycroft and Chloe Carmichael, respectively, who both find themselves having the help the King do battle and face becoming causalities themselves. There's also Nick Brimble as security man Corder and Bernice Stegers as the estranged Princess Charlotte who leave quite an impression with their brief appearances. Not forgetting Susannah Harker as Mattie Storin who, while only appearing in sound and film clips from House Of Cards, still looms large over the events that unfold. Like its predecessor, this miniseries is blessed by a fine cast backing its two leading men.There's the production values as well. Many of those who worked on House Of Cards returned to this miniseries and their work is just as good here. Once again there's fine production design by Ken Ledsham who creates the worlds ranging from 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and beyond. There's also the cinematography of Jim Fyans and Ian Punter which once again brings a fine sense of atmosphere to the world of the miniseries. Last but not least here is once again the music by Jim Parker, especially with the main title and end title pieces which serve as a perfect start and closing to the four episodes of the miniseries. All of this, once again under the direction of Paul Seed, helps to make the miniseries stand up against its predecessor well indeed.Which brings us to the script. Once again  Andrew Davies adapts Michael Dobbs novel into a script that is less a political thriller then a political parable if not satire at times. Davies looks at what happens when the two opposing mind sets of a liberally minded King and a conservative Prime Minister meet head to head. The result is a battle of wits as the two men attempt through their various lieutenants to help their cause come out on top. It is a story about the modern process of media control and how that can clash with both the idealistic and the cynical alike. It is also a story that looks at how power effects those who hold it as Urquhart is haunted by the events at the end of House Of Cards and must face the possibility of treason by two of those closest to him. There's also a fair bit of satire as well covering the scandals of the royal family in the early 1990's and the media's reactions to them as well. The result is a script that isn't quite as gripping as House Of Cards but more thought provoking.To Play The King is a fine successor to House Of Cards. From the performances of Richardson and Kitchen in the lead roles, a fine supporting cast,  good production values and a well written script as well. While it is not the thriller the original was and is somewhat less gripping as a result, To Play The King works as something else instead. It is a parable about what happens when the liberally minded and the conservatively minded face each other head on. The result is thought provoking indeed.5/5The Final Cut:Having risen through the ranks of the United Kingdom's Conservative Party in House Of Cards and having consolidated power in To Play The King, Francis Urquhart (played once again by Ian Richardson) is on the verge of becoming the longest serving Prime Minister. Yet the pieces are slowly moving against him for last game of power politics. The stage is set for The Final Cut, the final miniseries in the House Of Cards trilogy.Like its two predecessors, the miniseries's success lies in its lead character Francis Urquhart as played by actor Ian Richardson. Urquhart, who has served as Prime Minister for approximately a decade, is making plans for his eventual retirement while seeking a fitting legacy. Yet the skeletons of the past aren't quite as quite as dead and buried as he might think though as things slowly come out to threaten his very political existence. Richardson continues to play Urquhart as a modern day (modern day being an alternate version of mid to late 1990's UK) version of Shakespeare's Richard III but there's a more human element in this last act as well. Here's a man whose played numerous power games and finds himself risking more and more in one final play for power and, in this case, a fine legacy as well. In a way this may well be Richardson's finest performance in the role of Urquhart.There's also another major player who deserves mention. Diane Fletcher, who had largely been on the sidelines in the two previous miniseries, gets her biggest role in the trilogy as Urquhart's wife Elizabeth and this is as much her series as it is Richardson. Her she is revealed to be just as cunning and manipulative as her husband as she helps to set up the Urquhart Trust and watches her husbands final power plays with increasing worry. Also of interest is Elizabeth's hinted at relationship with security man Corder which brings a new dimension to this series, especially in regards to the ending. All of this gives Fletcher a chance to show off her skills and makes The Final Cut as much hers and his.Which brings us to the supporting cast which is a bit mixed. On the plus side are Paul Freeman as Tom Makepeace, the Conservative party politician who grows increasingly wary of and eventually becomes the one who may finally be able to bring Urquhart down. There's also Isla Blair as Claire Carlsen who rises within Urquhart's ranks while being involved with one of the PM rival's. Last but not least is Nick Brimble as Corder who gets a large role in the proceedings and the aforementioned relationship with Urquahrt's wife as well. On the downside are Nickolas Grace who gives a sleazy and annoying performance as Geoffrey Booza Pitt and Joseph Long as the rather bumbling and  ineffective Cyprus President. The supporting cast overall is a mixed bunch which dampens the success of The Final Cut somewhat.The production values hold up well for the most parts. Once again there's fine production design by Ken Ledsham who creates the worlds ranging from 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and beyond though somehow there seems a very low budget feel to the scenes set in Cyprus. There's also the cinematography of Ian Punter which once again brings a fine sense of atmosphere to the world of the miniseries. Last but not least here is once again the music by Jim Parker, especially with the main title and end title pieces which serve as a perfect start and closing to the four episodes of the miniseries. Sadly what seems to be lacking is the direction of Mike Vardy who makes this final part seem to be both very sleazy (including unnecessary nudity especially considering the lack of it earlier in the trilogy) and snail paced throughout. The result is, like the supporting cast, something that dampens the success of this final part.Last but not least is the script.  Once again Andrew Davies adapts Michael Dobbs (who is uncredited as the novel's author due to creative conflicts with the makers of the series) novel into a script which takes a look at a seasoned politician and his last grasps at power. Urquhart seems obsessed at times with the shadow of predecessor Margret Thatcher (who appears to have died just before the beginning of the series) and him staying as Prime Minister longer then she was and securing a fitting legacy to his tenure. Yet there are ghosts of the past that begin to haunt Urquhart more and more. Here we learn more of Urquhart's past including his army tenure in Cyprus and how it now threatens to bring him down. There's the machinations of those in his government as well including Makepeace who prepares to challenge him for power as well. Together the script offers us a look at the fall of one government, the effect of that on the man in charge of it and the rise of its successor. That's not the say that this is a perfect script though as there are some decidedly sleazy and improbable aspects to the story as well, including the rather unsatisfactory ending which seems a rather convoluted way to end the trilogy of miniseries's. Maybe those are the faults of the novel rather then the script but there is something not quite right with this final part of the House Of Cards trilogy.The Final Cut proves to be the last, if unsatisfactory, part of the House Of Cards trilogy. While there's fine performances from Richardson and Fletcher plus much of the supporting cast the issues with other members of the supporting cast, some low budget feels, direction and script issues weigh this part down significantly. The result is a good but overall unsatisfactory conclusion which seems rather a shame.3.5/5Overall it's a fine set of miniseries's. There's three fine performances from Ian Richardson which alone make this set of stories the success that they are. Though the final part of the trilogy is rather unsatisfactory the first two parts are highly successful and highly entertaining. It's also a remarkable look at the rise and fall of one ambitious man and his government. If you are a fan of either political thrillers, British television or both look no further then the House Of Cards trilogy.",5,The Rise And Fall Of Francis Urquhart,1263427200,"01 14,

It's a stunning, if not wildly exaggerated, insight into British party politics and the party machine.  It's too long a series - 3 discs & out of memory 12 episodes - to go into any critical review detail here but what I can say is that there isn't a single wasted moment in this highly entertaining series.  It may be too subtle for some American audiences, but most will find it enthralling. Ian Richardson is perfect as Francis Urquhart (F.U) the British Prime Minister for most of the series and gives the role a Machiavellian soul that Spacey (U.S version recently released) cannot seem to find. Richardson is mischievous, highly intelligent, supremely wicked and almost entirely one or even two steps ahead of his rivals throughout. He also likes to 'put the stick about' roughing up his colleagues as he shapes the political landscape of Britain. Above all, which I cannot derive from the American series, you understand that F.U genuinely believes that what he does is for the good of the 'empire' and you cannot help but to be somewhat sympathetic towards his cause(s) - which is what makes for the best of villains - you love 'em & hate 'em simultaneously. better by far than the latest version but perhaps a trifle dated and with less production value (though for this series imperceptible).

755339,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B00009MGGI,M. Dog,"[148, 151]","The Brits may no longer rule the world, but they sure produce some of the best television the medium has seen. In any discussions of the best projects or series in television history, this trilogy will have a place.The series opens with Conservative Party Whip, Francis Urquhart, fondly holding a portrait of Margaret Thatcher, remarking that all things, no matter how good, must come to an end. This perfectly sets the time and tone of what is to follow. Urquhart must maneuver and control the political scene in the power vacuum left by the exit of the Iron Lady.This production strives for Shakespearean proportions, and hits the bull's eye. The main character, Urquhart, played by Ian Richardson, is a crafty blend of Macbeth and King Richard. Like Macbeth, Urquhart has a power hungry wife gently messaging his shoulders and whispering pretty treacheries in his ear; and like Richard, Urquhart takes the viewer into his confidence, revealing his black plans with wicked joy. This technique of Urquhart speaking directly to you, the viewer, is a tremendous stroke. Like with King Richard, you will find yourself somehow cheering for this cold, angular blade of a man, as he slices through well-meaning fools and bumbling bullies alike (or, as Urquhart says, &quot;put a bit of stick about&quot;).A great production throughout, with wonderful writing and acting.

755345,A2887J6P8VPB5H,B00009MGGI,Nichomachus,"[140, 157]","Me watching this took on the manner of a voracious animal consuming its prey. The entire trilogy is beautifully done, magnificiently produced, and the acting is simply incomparable.The HOUSE OF CARDS, the first season, is quite clearly the best. The wit, the plot, the sheer malignancy of it is just pure delight. I worked briefly at the House of Commons, and I thought the presentation of Parliament and Westminster politics was brilliant. I don't think there is anything equal to the cynicism on display here, as France Urquhart (Ian Richardson) cheerfully outmaneuvers and destroys his political opponents (his colleagues within his party). The mockery of the British political system is right on. Richardson has these asides to the audience that work perfectly, and heighten the hilarity. It's what something like WAG THE DOG wishes it could be for American politics, but unfortunately American audiences don't always have the political sophistication to enjoy this level of satire. *****TO PLAY THE KING has Urquhart as Prime Minister (known appropriately by the initials FU), master of his domain. The arc in this series focuses on the place of the monarchy in the constitutional system, with many asides on homosexuality in politics, manipulation of the press, exploitation of disaters, and the staging of politically convenient terrorist attacks. Not as good as the first season by any measure, however, Urquhart's systematic destruction of the King (a brilliant Michael Kitchen) masterfully communicates some of the political tensions built into Britain's constitution. This season generated a lot of controversy with the British public, many of whom thought it was intentionally and excessively disrespectful to the monarchy (see the DVD extras). All in all, the writing doesn't have the same degree of biting and wit, although Richardson's performance is still on the money. ****THE FINAL CUT is the unforunate third season, and takes on the character of Shakespeare's RICHARD III, but makes it tedious. Richardson's vicious asides to the audience are almost totally absent, which relieves him of his charm. It's not nearly as funny or interesting, and seems to meander along until its excessive and fairly overwrought ending.

755347,A3AXOMCVUM6BDD,B00009MGGI,Peter DePalma,"[20, 24]","The three TV movies are full of great performances (from a great cast) and sinister intrigue.  Sex, deception, murder, and all sorts of villainy littered throughout the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and even Number 10.  Why not?  The movies wouldn't be any fun if these films dealt out sins in small portions.  As over the top as it is, it works and it's great to watch!""House of Cards"" started as a single book, which became a very different miniseries.  The intro with Francis Urquhart looking at a photo of Thatcher was apparently broadcast around the time she was voted out of office... a strange and eerie coincidence.  I consider the TV version better than the book, however I did see it before I read it.  Urquhart's sinister and devious charm help make the viewer admire him (in a strange way)... yet he's ruthless and cunning, and you love to hate him.  Wait for the end... it yanked me up from my seat.It's a who-dun-it where you know who did it all along.  The main character, Francis Urquhart, takes the audience into his confidence... you sometimes feel a little guilty knowing what's going on.  If you get confused while watching Urquhart talk with various characters, just wait until they are off screen... F.U. will probably fill you in on what he *really* thinks.  Take notes on who dies, how they die, and who does it... a grim game to play while watching the three miniseries.""To Play the King"" might be more of the same from the previous book and TV movie (both are worth reading and viewing)... but, you can't really get enough of Urquhart.  Plus, you get a slightly stronger impression that Elizabeth Urquhart has more to do with the life and politics of her husband.  She's often referred to as the Lady MacBeth of this series (and not without reason).  No more are the street shots of rats and sewers found in this series (a great theme in ""House of Cards""), but now we see even more private lives and intrigue than before.This is a battle of wills: our boy F.U. against the newly crowned idealistic King of England.  The King cares, he feels the pain of the country, he even seems to be sincerely motivated... but he's acting against the rules of conduct.  You know who will come out on top, but to watch to see the other characters work in and out of their side of the war between Urquhart and the King.  The royals, the advisors, the press, and public relations crew... they've all got a stake, and they're all pretty dirty.""The Final Cut"" seems to have a lot crammed into it.  The book is better... and again it's a bit different than the TV movie.  That is not to say that the TV movie isn't worth viewing.  Fans of Indiana Jones might recognize Tom Makepiece... the actor who portrays him (Paul Freeman) also played Belloc in ""Raiders""... he also played Prof. Moriarty in ""Without a Clue"".Urquhart is getting old.  His time is coming, but what about life after Number 10 for Francis and Elizabeth?  For that matter, what about life after Number 10 at Number 10?  Who can replace Urquhart?  Francis might have enough cunning and will to beat the record of Margaret Thatcher's rule, but his past might catch up with him.Is it hard for Americans to follow British politics?  Not really... it is very enjoyable, dark, and even funny.Some viewers might think this is a wicked commentary on conservative politics... you might think that.  I'm sure plenty of folks would even say that.  The author of the books (Michael Dobbs) worked for Thatcher.  Maybe he's throwing stones at the Tories, or even any conservative politician.  Yet, neither side of the political isle is safe.  He's just spinning a great political yarn.Not everyone in politics has the makings of F.U., but it's fun to think so.Sir Ian Richardson's performance is truly fantastic... he's a genius.  Susannah Harker is no slouch either.  Diane Fletcher may not be seen or heard that often, but her character is as good as omnipresent.Look up the cast on IMDB... they are so many good performances I can't name them all.  You've probably seen them on various British TV series and films.  After all, there's a running joke among my friends that says there's only about 35 actors working for the BBC, so they all end up in the same shows. ;)",4,"Brilliant?

If anything, they were better than before although I already knew what would happen.  Ian Richardson's performance as Urquhart is nothing short of brilliant and his asides are often so dryly clever that I would find myself using the rewind function on the player to catch them again.  To get an idea of this tone, try to imagine somehow a cross between Brideshead Revisited and Yes, Minister.Somewhat surprisingly, the ideological and social issues providing the setting for the series, particularly in To Play the King, are handled more or less subtlely and maturely.  It is hard to imagine a Hollywood production approaching Urquhart's upper class attitudes so well that they provide a point of amusement, rather than burlesque.  From my limited knowledge of British politics, the governmental and party affairs are dead on point, although this shouldn't be terribly surprising from a program produced in England for a UK audience.  Still, this was remarkably refreshing when compared with the dreck routinely produced in the US by the Oliver Stones and Tim Robbins that are about as close to reality as is Star Wars or Harry Potter.Another remarkable aspect of House of Cards and Play the King is their apparent roman a clef nature.  I was shocked repeatedly with how close the screenplay came in its references to -- and depictions of -- actual persons, particularly present and former members of the royal family.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[8, 10]","First, an important note: Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of a particular title - including prior releases and non NTSC versions - together so it is important, when reading reviews here, to see the date of the review (often best to sort by date of review) and the particular version (DVD, BD and even VHS!). That said, on to my review.Though released on DVD years ago, BBC Home video remastered the series (actually three separate four part stories) for this newest release on DVD and BD. (I can't speak for the BD as I got the DVD, but the image is sharp and the bonuses are the same.). With all the other reviews of the previous releases already here on Amazon (120 so far!), I will not go into the details of the show - except to say that I really liked the first and second seasons better than the third - though Ian Richardson is brilliant in all three. Let me concentrate on the ""new material"".The 2013 release comes with 4 DVDs. Each of the first three contains the four episodes of that  season plus a ""commentary track"" for Episode ONE. I have not listened to all three ""commentaries"" yet but I did listen to the one for Season One (""House of Cards"". This includes a new ""group commentary"" featuring Richardson, Screenwriter Andrew Davies and the series Producer"". It covers the full First Season and so there are spoiler alerts and I recommend that you do not hear the commentary until you have watch the rest of Disc One. But the info provided really fleshes out some of the story. The fourth DVD is marked ""Bonus Features"" and includes two programs. First is an excerpt from a British TV talk show about the controversy caused by Season 2 ""Two Play the King"". This lasts 8 minutes. The other ""bonus"" is a 51-minute film ""Westminster: Behind Closed Doors"" made for the BBC in 1995, giving a backstage tour of Westminster Abbey. I found this interesting though it doesn't really relate to the drama series.As you probably already know, the original ""House of Cards"" was produced in 1990 so you will note two things: 1) This was before the advent of Digital TVs and so the image aspect is the standard one (4:3) and not wide screen.2) Because PCs were in their infancy, you will note no cell phones and the monitors in the newspaper's newsrooms are monochrome CRT displays (remember those?).I was not aware of this BBC Series until this release (I missed it when it aired on PBS) so I'm glad I found it now.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Review of Remastered DVD (2013) - Nice Bonuses!,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,2519,"['First', 'important', 'note', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'particular', 'title', 'including', 'prior', 'releases', 'non', 'NTSC', 'versions', 'together', 'important', 'when', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'see', 'date', 'review', 'often', 'best', 'sort', 'date', 'review', 'particular', 'version', 'DVD', 'BD', 'even', 'VHS', 'said', 'review.Though', 'released', 'DVD', 'years', 'ago', 'BBC', 'Home', 'video', 'remastered', 'series', 'actually', 'three', 'separate', 'four', 'part', 'stories', 'newest', 'release', 'DVD', 'BD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'BD', 'got', 'DVD', 'image', 'sharp', 'bonuses', 'are', 'same.', 'other', 'reviews', 'previous', 'releases', 'already', 'here', 'Amazon', '120', 'so', 'far', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'details', 'show', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'better', 'third', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'brilliant', 'three', 'Let', 'concentrate', 'new', 'material', '.The', '2013', 'release', '4', 'DVDs', 'first', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'season', 'commentary', 'track', 'Episode', 'ONE', 'have', 'not', 'listened', 'three', 'commentaries', 'yet', 'did', 'listen', 'one', 'Season', 'One', 'House', 'Cards', 'new', 'group', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'Richardson', 'Screenwriter', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'series', 'Producer', 'full', 'First', 'Season', 'so', 'are', 'spoiler', 'alerts', 'recommend', 'do', 'not', 'hear', 'commentary', 'have', 'watch', 'rest', 'Disc', 'One', 'info', 'provided', 'really', 'fleshes', 'out', 'story', 'fourth', 'DVD', 'marked', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'two', 'programs', 'First', 'excerpt', 'British', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'controversy', 'caused', 'Season', '2', 'Two', 'Play', 'King', '8', 'minutes', 'other', 'bonus', '51-minute', 'film', 'Westminster', 'Closed', 'Doors', 'made', 'BBC', '1995', 'giving', 'backstage', 'tour', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'found', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'really', 'relate', 'drama', 'series.As', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'original', 'House', 'Cards', 'was', 'produced', '1990', 'will', 'note', 'two', 'things', '1', 'was', 'advent', 'Digital', 'TVs', 'so', 'image', 'aspect', 'standard', 'one', '4:3', 'not', 'wide', 'screen.2', 'PCs', 'were', 'infancy', 'will', 'note', 'cell', 'phones', 'monitors', 'newspaper', 'newsrooms', 'are', 'monochrome', 'CRT', 'displays', 'remember', '.I', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'BBC', 'Series', 'release', 'missed', 'when', 'aired', 'PBS', ""'m"", 'glad', 'found', 'now.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Thanks to streaming video and DVD rentals, I can almost always find plenty of movies and TV shows to watch at home, without buying DVDs. Including the entire House of Cards trilogy. I enjoyed it hugely back in the day when it was broadcast on PBS over, I think, three seasons. I watched it again on VHS tape (remember that?) a few years after the final season aired, and found it as enjoyable as before.And recently I have at least twice watched the entire trilogy via streaming video. I'd expected to hit the FF key a lot, because after all, this series was made a few decades ago, I've seen it before, and how much could I possibly enjoy it one more time?The answer: hugely. I rarely pushed the FF key, I found myself savoring the whole trilogy again as if I were seeing it for the first time. There's a lot to it: a brilliant script, wonderful production values, good direction, and a fab-u-lous cast.

755372,A1PHVLYS6T4YW5,B00009MGGI,T. Berner,"[6, 20]","The BBC was given a decent budget, a large staff of screenwriters from a country that respects the written word and the theatrical profession, a fine troupe of actors and a rich literary tradition from which they can draw. How then can they make a story of political intrigue, seduction and murder so damn boring?The rise of Francis Urquhart from Majority Whip to longest serving Prime Minister styles itself, perhaps too earnestly, on William Shakespeare's Richard III with a soupcon of MacBeth thrown in, but they have only managed to produce a damp squib of a production despite some fine actors.Because the BBC is busy rebranding itself from the world's most respected and objective news source to a more attractive role as the Chief Bootlick of the Labour Party, it is a given that Francis Urquhart (or &#34;FU&#34; as the writers so drolly have the newspapers call him) is a Tory, But why then are his opponents such dunderheads? FU is supposed to outshine and outsmart everyone with his wit and strategy, but it is all rather trite. He easily outclasses his opponents because they are portrayed as extraordinarily stupid.Even though FU always has the thinnest of margins in the House of Commons, the Labour Party barely makes an appearance. FU's opponents in his own party and the King are straw men set up to be knocked down. The actor portraying a Prince Charles sort of monarch has managed the amazing feat of making the King even less charismatic and duller than Prince Charles himself. The reason for this lack of real conflict in the rise of FU is because if you are a writer and are not particularly bright, but you have to show your protagonist get the better of his enemies, you have to portray his enemies this way in order to make your hero (or anti-hero in this case) appear brighter than average. If you yourself are not brighter than average, you can't create worthy opponents for your character: it is beyond your skill.Worst of all is that two thirds into the series, FU has managed to be on top of the world: he has gained reelection, murdered off his  enemies and forced the king to abdicate. You are set up for a rousing finale of Oliver Cromwell redux. Instead, the series then fast forwards to the end of his thirteenth year in office. Little has changed in Britain except for the reinstitution of National Service. The PM continues to hang on with fragile minorities. Then, his wife and chief henchman arrange his assassination, she, so that she can enjoy the fruits of a corrupt deal, he, so that he can perform the same hitman role for FU's successor.If one really wants to see television drama with a Shakespearean edge to it watch Breaking Bad. It does not attempt to mimic Old William the way House of Cards does, but in capturing the soul of Shakespearean drama (right down to its Hamlet-like ending) with a vocabulary and a mise-en-scene all its own, it honors the Shakespearean theatrical tradition in a rich and gripping fashion that the people behind House of Cards could never achieve.",1,How Does the BBC Manage it?,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,3025,"['BBC', 'was', 'given', 'decent', 'budget', 'large', 'staff', 'screenwriters', 'country', 'written', 'word', 'theatrical', 'profession', 'fine', 'troupe', 'actors', 'rich', 'literary', 'tradition', 'can', 'draw', 'How', 'then', 'can', 'make', 'story', 'political', 'intrigue', 'seduction', 'murder', 'so', 'damn', 'boring', 'rise', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'Majority', 'Whip', 'longest', 'serving', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'perhaps', 'too', 'earnestly', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Richard', 'III', 'soupcon', 'MacBeth', 'thrown', 'have', 'only', 'managed', 'produce', 'damp', 'squib', 'production', 'fine', 'BBC', 'busy', 'rebranding', 'world', 'most', 'respected', 'objective', 'news', 'source', 'more', 'attractive', 'role', 'Chief', 'Bootlick', 'Labour', 'Party', 'given', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', '34', 'FU', '34', 'writers', 'so', 'drolly', 'have', 'newspapers', 'call', 'Tory', 'why', 'then', 'are', 'opponents', 'such', 'dunderheads', 'FU', 'supposed', 'outshine', 'outsmart', 'everyone', 'wit', 'strategy', 'rather', 'trite', 'easily', 'opponents', 'are', 'portrayed', 'extraordinarily', 'stupid.Even', 'FU', 'always', 'thinnest', 'margins', 'House', 'Commons', 'Labour', 'Party', 'barely', 'appearance', 'FU', 'opponents', 'own', 'party', 'King', 'are', 'straw', 'men', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'knocked', 'down', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'sort', 'monarch', 'managed', 'amazing', 'feat', 'making', 'King', 'even', 'less', 'charismatic', 'duller', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'reason', 'lack', 'real', 'conflict', 'rise', 'FU', 'are', 'writer', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'bright', 'have', 'show', 'protagonist', 'get', 'better', 'enemies', 'have', 'portray', 'enemies', 'way', 'order', 'make', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'case', 'appear', 'brighter', 'average', 'are', 'not', 'brighter', 'average', 'ca', ""n't"", 'create', 'worthy', 'opponents', 'character', 'skill.Worst', 'two', 'thirds', 'series', 'FU', 'managed', 'be', 'top', 'world', 'gained', 'reelection', 'murdered', 'off', 'enemies', 'forced', 'king', 'abdicate', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'rousing', 'finale', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'redux', 'Instead', 'series', 'then', 'fast', 'forwards', 'end', 'thirteenth', 'year', 'office', 'Little', 'changed', 'Britain', 'reinstitution', 'National', 'Service', 'PM', 'hang', 'fragile', 'minorities', 'Then', 'wife', 'chief', 'henchman', 'arrange', 'assassination', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fruits', 'corrupt', 'deal', 'so', 'can', 'perform', 'same', 'hitman', 'role', 'FU', 'successor.If', 'one', 'really', 'see', 'television', 'drama', 'Shakespearean', 'edge', 'watch', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'not', 'attempt', 'mimic', 'Old', 'William', 'way', 'House', 'Cards', 'capturing', 'soul', 'Shakespearean', 'drama', 'right', 'down', 'Hamlet-like', 'ending', 'vocabulary', 'mise-en-scene', 'own', 'Shakespearean', 'theatrical', 'tradition', 'rich', 'gripping', 'fashion', 'people', 'House', 'Cards', 'could', 'never', 'achieve']",N/A

Sir Ian Richardson is ideally cast and the supporting actors are without exception ideally cast.Especially conniving and sly and arrogant is Urquharts wife who, in effect, is replaying the role of Lady Macbeth that she did in the film by Roman Polanski.  She is the true power behind the throne and has even more balls and a treacherous nature than her husband - but is this not always so.This set is a joy to watch and althought some of the parliamentary procedures may be baffling and arcane to many Americans - but not we Canadians, since we also have a parliamentary and constitutional monarchy - the machinations and backroom backstabbing is breathtaking in its savagery and complete lack of moral fibre and conscience.

Hutter ""v_rh""","[6, 12]","As someone who was mesmerized by this trilogy when it appeared on Masterpiece Theater, I was surprised that the DVD was needlessly made into an ""R"" rated version.  Frontal nudity (women), back nudity (men) and simulated sexual intercourse on the DVD version in no way enhanced the triology.  I found myself embarrassed for the superb actor, Sir Ian Richardson, having to simulate explicit sex with actresses the age of his grandchildren.  Do directors really think the audience cannot imagine sexual affairs without having to see simulated intercourse or simulated oral sex between the actors in the movie?  To me it's bait and switch--you view a production on T.V. and are not told that what you are buying on DVD is not the same but has added content which you had not wished to see.

This is a brilliant, funny, compelling series.All I can add is to say that American audiences can too appreciate the sophistication of this drama, which seems in doubt for some of the other reviewers.
