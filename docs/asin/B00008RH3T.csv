747045,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00008RH3T,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","The story of Medea and Jason is very old, dating from the bronze age.  It is most memorably told in 431 by Greek playwright Euripides, who made several changes in the earlier stories to create a work that has unexpectedly feminist overtones.  Cast off by her husband and without rights or law or society on her side, Medea is driven to kill her two sons in order to exact revenge on her faithfuless husband.  In the process, the playright asks us to consider how her misdeeds may be triggered by inequity--something that many ancients who saw the play found even more horrifying than Medea's crimes.Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889-1968) is considered one of the greatest and most influential directors in 20th Century cinema.  He is best known for the 1928 THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and the 1932 VAMPYR--both silent films, although the later was filmed in the sound era.  His work is notable for its dreamlike quality.  At some point in his career, Dreyer contemplated a film of Medea and went so far as to write a treatment and screenplay.  In 1988 Lars von Trier, working from Dreyer's script and filming in Dreyer's style, brought it to the screen as a television film.Let the film critics and historians say what they like, but I have always found Dreyer's films visually beautiful but so interminable that I'd really rather watch paint dry.  Lars von Trier captures both qualities perfectly.  The film is visually arresting, but both dialogue and story have been scrapped to emphasize the way the thing looks, and the result is beautiful and incredibly slow--and the slowness reads as intentionally annoying.  The film is just over an hour and fifteen minutes, but even so it feels as long as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  Others think the film is quite fine, and I say let us leave it to them.GFT",2,Beautiful but Interminable,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,1789,"['story', 'Medea', 'Jason', 'very', 'old', 'dating', 'bronze', 'age', 'most', 'memorably', 'told', '431', 'Greek', 'playwright', 'Euripides', 'who', 'made', 'several', 'changes', 'earlier', 'stories', 'create', 'work', 'unexpectedly', 'feminist', 'overtones', 'Cast', 'husband', 'rights', 'law', 'society', 'side', 'Medea', 'driven', 'kill', 'two', 'sons', 'order', 'exact', 'revenge', 'faithfuless', 'husband', 'process', 'playright', 'consider', 'how', 'misdeeds', 'may', 'be', 'triggered', 'inequity', 'something', 'many', 'ancients', 'who', 'saw', 'play', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'horrifying', 'Medea', 'crimes.Carl', 'Theodor', 'Dreyer', '1889-1968', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'influential', 'directors', '20th', 'Century', 'cinema', 'best', 'known', '1928', 'THE', 'PASSION', 'OF', 'JOAN', 'OF', 'ARC', '1932', 'VAMPYR', 'silent', 'films', 'later', 'was', 'filmed', 'sound', 'era', 'work', 'notable', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'point', 'career', 'Dreyer', 'contemplated', 'film', 'Medea', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'write', 'treatment', 'screenplay', '1988', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'working', 'Dreyer', 'script', 'filming', 'Dreyer', 'style', 'brought', 'screen', 'television', 'film', 'critics', 'historians', 'say', 'what', 'like', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Dreyer', 'films', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'so', 'interminable', ""'d"", 'really', 'rather', 'watch', 'paint', 'dry', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'qualities', 'perfectly', 'film', 'visually', 'arresting', 'dialogue', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'scrapped', 'emphasize', 'way', 'thing', 'result', 'beautiful', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'slowness', 'intentionally', 'annoying', 'film', 'just', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'even', 'as', 'long', 'THE', 'ENGLISH', 'PATIENT', 'Others', 'think', 'film', 'quite', 'fine', 'say', 'let', 'leave', 'them.GFT']",Medea

I thought the transfer was poor on the Facets edition of Heimat, but this makes the US Facets Heimat look hi-def by comparison. This dvd is pixelated, grainy & just barely this side of unwatchable. This transfer makes many of the dollar store dvd's look good by comparison. I can't believe Facets has the gall to charge $30 for this. This review & the 1 star rating is for this dvd, Not for the film. The transfer is so bad that I can't judge or enjoy the film.Edit 1/13/12: I posted the following in the comments section also, but since Facets is only partially to blame for the horrific video quality, I am also adding it to the original review.I just got a copy of the PAL edition. For whatever reason (see the comments for one person's opinion as to why), this film was shot in HORRIBLE quality. To me it's bad beyond art, but for each his own.As bad as the PAL edition is, the Facets is worse. The Facets has pixelization in the dark segments that is 100% missing in the PAL, & also has less detail than the PAL. I'm not totally certain if the lack of detail is due to an attempt to smooth out some of the grain by Facets, or if the 2 dvd's are a couple analog generations apart (i.e. the PAL being a direct film transfer & the Facets being perhaps a copy of a copy).But to be perfectly honest, both versions do have almost unwatchable picture quality.My interest in this is due to being a huge fan of Carl TH Dreyer. While he may have enjoyed the acting (I haven't watched the extras on the PAL disc yet; one of which is supposed to discuss how closely Von Trier did or did not follow Dreyer's script), but I strongly believe Dreyer would be as disgusted with the production values of this film as I am.One final comment: The PAL edition has 2 ""bonus features"". One of the 2 features compares 2 scenes; as written by Dreyer & as filmed by Von Trier with no editorial comment. I obviously have no way of knowing how representative the 2 scenes in question are due to the lack of editorial comment; but the 2 scenes as filmed bare absolutely NO resemblance to what Dreyer wrote.What I am suggesting is that there is a strong possibility that this film has next to nothing to do with Dreyer other than Von Trier using his name & reputation.",1,AWFUL Picture Quality,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,2266,"['Stay', 'away', 'Facets', 'thought', 'transfer', 'was', 'poor', 'Facets', 'edition', 'Heimat', 'US', 'Facets', 'Heimat', 'look', 'hi-def', 'comparison', 'dvd', 'pixelated', 'grainy', 'just', 'barely', 'side', 'unwatchable', 'transfer', 'many', 'dollar', 'store', 'dvd', 'look', 'good', 'comparison', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Facets', 'gall', 'charge', '30', 'review', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'dvd', 'Not', 'film', 'transfer', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'enjoy', 'film.Edit', '1/13/12', 'posted', 'following', 'comments', 'section', 'also', 'Facets', 'only', 'partially', 'blame', 'horrific', 'video', 'quality', 'am', 'also', 'adding', 'original', 'review.I', 'just', 'got', 'copy', 'PAL', 'edition', 'reason', 'see', 'comments', 'one', 'person', 'opinion', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'HORRIBLE', 'quality', 'bad', 'art', 'own.As', 'bad', 'PAL', 'edition', 'Facets', 'worse', 'Facets', 'pixelization', 'dark', 'segments', '100', '%', 'missing', 'PAL', 'also', 'less', 'detail', 'PAL', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'certain', 'lack', 'detail', 'due', 'attempt', 'smooth', 'out', 'grain', 'Facets', '2', 'dvd', 'are', 'couple', 'analog', 'generations', 'apart', 'i.e', 'PAL', 'being', 'direct', 'film', 'transfer', 'Facets', 'being', 'perhaps', 'copy', 'copy', '.But', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'versions', 'do', 'have', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'picture', 'quality.My', 'interest', 'due', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Carl', 'TH', 'Dreyer', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'extras', 'PAL', 'disc', 'yet', 'one', 'supposed', 'discuss', 'how', 'closely', 'Von', 'Trier', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'Dreyer', 'script', 'strongly', 'believe', 'Dreyer', 'would', 'be', 'disgusted', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'am.One', 'final', 'comment', 'PAL', 'edition', '2', 'bonus', 'features', 'One', '2', 'features', '2', 'scenes', 'written', 'Dreyer', 'filmed', 'Von', 'Trier', 'editorial', 'comment', 'obviously', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'how', 'representative', '2', 'scenes', 'question', 'are', 'due', 'lack', 'editorial', 'comment', '2', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'bare', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'resemblance', 'what', 'Dreyer', 'wrote.What', 'am', 'suggesting', 'strong', 'possibility', 'film', 'next', 'nothing', 'do', 'Dreyer', 'other', 'Von', 'Trier', 'using', 'name', 'reputation']",Medea

747049,A12OTDIWIG841L,B00008RH3T,Leslie Thompson,"[18, 23]","...Wordlessly submissive in body and deed? What rights have women?"" --MedeaPeople seem disappointed with the transfer to DVD, but it didn't bother me too much. It's an old video, so I wouldn't expect it to be perfect. All things technical need not be perfect at all times.This story was one of my favorites in college, so I was naturally interested in the film versions.  I prefer this adaptation to the one with Maria Callas. The atmosphere is more suitable in von Trier's work, with the mist, wind, barren land, gray seas. It also reflects Medea's mood, I think. Such bleak imagery for her depressed state.However, I found it interesting that birds were chirping on the sunny day that Medea hung her children (I think she stabbed them in the book). I also found it somewhat unrealistic when the older son told her that he knew what was going to happen, and when he put the noose around his own neck.Not much dialogue, but that's okay, because it didn't need much (if you know the story).Great lines by Medea, as one would expect:  ""I'd rather bleed behind a shield than bearing a man's children.""  With this review's title quotation, it is clear that Medea feels her oppression as a female in a patriarchal society. She would rather be a soldier than a mother - more active, aggressive. Alas, she ""was but his prey."" She left her country and family for Jason, helped him find the fleece, but he ends up betraying her.Medea is obviously a feminist of her time, noting how society discriminates against her, knowing that pride is good fortune for Jason, but bad fortune for her. That's still true in today's society. Aggressive, arrogant women are looked down upon much more than are aggressive, arrogant men. It's the ""bitch"" character flaw vs. the ""normal (strong!)"" male personality. And her powers and intelligence (again, also happens today) are underestimated until the end.There is a beautiful scene involving a horse that was cut by the poisoned crown. It appears to go crazy, breaking free from its ties and frantically running out to the beach towards the sea, until it finally collapses, seizing until it is still. That horse did some good acting, or maybe they really stabbed it or something.Something that bothered me about Medea's appearance - that hideous skull cap. I wanted to see her hair, I've always pictured Medea with wild long hair. She let it out one time, at the end of the movie. Perhaps the cap represented her bondage to Jason, and taking it off signaled her release? That's probably a stretch, but it's what came to mind when I saw it.I've never felt sorry for Jason. He brought it on himself. Did he deserve to have his children, new wife and father in law murdered?  Perhaps not, but it is Medea's last hurrah and her right as a scorned woman. Men tried to diminish her power, but she outsmarted them all by pretending that she had been wrong, apologizing to Jason, acting proper, submissive, meek (non-threatening).The sad thing is, Jason seems like the kind of man who would do that all over again if given the chance. He is too self-centered to see what how his actions will affect those who have grown to trust and love him.  Moral of the story: obey the ""Do not commit adultery"" commandment, or someone might break the ""Do not murder"" commandment.""There is no greater sorrow than love."" --Medea",4,"""Why must women bear so much?...",1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,3330,"['Wordlessly', 'submissive', 'body', 'deed', 'What', 'rights', 'have', 'women', 'MedeaPeople', 'seem', 'disappointed', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'old', 'video', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'perfect', 'things', 'technical', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'times.This', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'college', 'was', 'naturally', 'interested', 'film', 'versions', 'prefer', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Maria', 'Callas', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'suitable', 'von', 'Trier', 'work', 'mist', 'wind', 'barren', 'land', 'gray', 'seas', 'also', 'Medea', 'mood', 'think', 'Such', 'bleak', 'imagery', 'depressed', 'state.However', 'found', 'interesting', 'birds', 'were', 'chirping', 'sunny', 'day', 'Medea', 'hung', 'children', 'think', 'stabbed', 'book', 'also', 'found', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'when', 'older', 'son', 'told', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'put', 'noose', 'own', 'neck.Not', 'much', 'dialogue', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'know', 'story', '.Great', 'lines', 'Medea', 'one', 'would', 'expect', ""'d"", 'rather', 'bleed', 'shield', 'bearing', 'man', 'children', 'review', 'title', 'quotation', 'clear', 'Medea', 'oppression', 'female', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'soldier', 'mother', 'more', 'active', 'aggressive', 'Alas', 'was', 'prey', 'left', 'country', 'family', 'Jason', 'helped', 'find', 'fleece', 'up', 'betraying', 'her.Medea', 'obviously', 'feminist', 'time', 'noting', 'how', 'society', 'knowing', 'pride', 'good', 'fortune', 'Jason', 'bad', 'fortune', 'still', 'true', 'today', 'society', 'Aggressive', 'arrogant', 'women', 'are', 'looked', 'upon', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'aggressive', 'arrogant', 'men', 'bitch', 'character', 'flaw', 'normal', 'strong', 'male', 'personality', 'powers', 'intelligence', 'again', 'also', 'today', 'are', 'underestimated', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'involving', 'horse', 'was', 'cut', 'poisoned', 'crown', 'go', 'crazy', 'breaking', 'free', 'ties', 'frantically', 'running', 'out', 'beach', 'sea', 'finally', 'seizing', 'still', 'horse', 'did', 'good', 'acting', 'maybe', 'really', 'stabbed', 'something.Something', 'bothered', 'Medea', 'appearance', 'hideous', 'skull', 'cap', 'wanted', 'see', 'hair', ""'ve"", 'always', 'pictured', 'Medea', 'wild', 'long', 'hair', 'let', 'out', 'one', 'time', 'end', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'cap', 'represented', 'bondage', 'Jason', 'taking', 'off', 'signaled', 'release', 'probably', 'stretch', 'what', 'came', 'mind', 'when', 'saw', 'it.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Jason', 'brought', 'Did', 'deserve', 'have', 'children', 'new', 'wife', 'father', 'law', 'murdered', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'Medea', 'last', 'hurrah', 'right', 'scorned', 'woman', 'Men', 'tried', 'diminish', 'power', 'outsmarted', 'pretending', 'had', 'been', 'wrong', 'apologizing', 'Jason', 'acting', 'proper', 'submissive', 'meek', 'non-threatening', '.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'Jason', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'given', 'chance', 'too', 'self-centered', 'see', 'what', 'how', 'actions', 'will', 'affect', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'trust', 'love', 'Moral', 'story', 'obey', 'Do', 'not', 'commit', 'adultery', 'commandment', 'someone', 'might', 'break', 'Do', 'not', 'murder', 'commandment', 'greater', 'sorrow', 'love', 'Medea']",Medea

So if you can visually get around the deteriorated look of the film I found everything pretty compelling, from the acting, the unadorned sets (Which really feel like 437 BC) and the naturalism of the film itself. Not to mention that the Medea myth/play is a classic worthy of retelling and this movie seems to get to the heart of Medea's blood-curdling motivations. Also, I've seen most of Lars Von Triers films - his scripts are not very sympathetic to humanity and women especially. But this film seems wholly non judgemental of the character - a rarity for his movies.

747052,AKI1CK229BDUC,B00008RH3T,PsyRC,"[3, 3]","Many big-time spoilers included here.It's very clear that Lars von Trier has a penchant for digging his nails into the festering wounds of the human psyche, which is almost invariably grist for the psychopathological mill. An asset of this film is that, in disarming the legend of Medea of its fantastic/mythical qualities, and thus ""reducing"" it to a story about a rejected woman who seeks revenge for the slight committed against her, it resonate a lot more with everyday experience, allowing it to shape itself according to our notion of reality. This can be terrifying, especially with the subject matter at hand. Some authors have argues that there is an infanticidal urge in all mothers, whether conscious or not (usually the latter). Those who act on it are usually portrayed as demonic and/or insane. This is a massive denial of the murderous tendencies present in all living creatures, a denial which seems necessary since it allows people to have some semblance of control over their minds and actions. But, given the right circumstances, the illusion is shattered, and a new balance needs to be reached. In the case of Medea, her narcissistic wound is too great to bear, yet the perpetrator cannot be attacked directly (for whatever reason). Her sexuality is rejected, thus she proceeds to destroy any evidence of his. She murders his bride-to-be as well as some of her family members. The epitome of her acts is the killing of her 2 children, which happens in a very matter-of-fact manner. The ""intruder complex"" can be felt in the mind of the eldest son, who gladly assists in killing the younger brother, pulling him down as he hangs helplessly from the tree. He thus fulfills his own unconscious wish of destroying his uterine rival. Her ""psychogenic sterility"" is accomplished, and she can depart.
