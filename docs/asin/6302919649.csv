This film is about that.If you are new to Kurosawa films, you might include viewing the excellent Commentary on this wonderful classic.  Criterion  has been consistent with producing  some excellent informative commentary.  But view it after you have seen the movie.  Then, will you get a great insight into the complete work on this film, the setting with such attention to detail, the framing in shots, the story, the colorful characters, etc.Ikuru (To Live), a lengthy 50's film, is dramatic, sad, humorous and rewarding.  An aging man, Watanabe, is dying of stomach cancer and believes that now he needs to live his life with some meaning.  He has been at the same bureaucratic job for over 25 years, a widower, and he has missed landmark periods in his son's life, hence the distance with his son and son's wife.In his search for meaning, he encounters a writer who thinks he needs to party and live!  The writer takes him on a journey of drinking, women, nightclubs, etc.  These scenes are magnificent, the cultures in different overcrowded clubs, But Watanabe is clearly uncomfortable in these surroundings.While he was out of work, a young female colleague comes to his house for a signature from him.  He gradually spends some time with her, to the chagrin and disapproval of his family and he discovers she has LIFE in her.  This is not an intimate love affair, but from her, he derives an inspiration he becomes passionate about and returns to work to devote his last days on a memorable mission.

Salama,"[5, 24]","This 1952 film by Akira Kurosawa, about a civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer, and trying to do something socially meaningful in the last months of his life to redeem his boring and uneventful life, has become a bit overrated. Some people had even called this film a masterpiece. The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer. Realistic movies were not Kurosawa's forte.

345583,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302919649,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Soaked in the tragedy of loss yet uplifting in the promise of self-empowerment; `Ikiru' (which translates `To Live') is one of the most powerfully moving films ever made.  With a deep-set sadness that permeates each scene, `Ikiru' knows the message it is trying to portray, and director Akira Kurosawa understands how best to relay the message to the audience.  We are drawn in to this man's world, feeling his every ache and pain, and we adopt his resolve just as he does.The film tells a rather simplistic story.  An elderly man named Kanji Watanabe finds out that he is going to die of stomach cancer.  Up until this point in his life he has lived like a shell of a man, working to provide for his son and his daughter-in-law.  Thirty-years of faithful service to the city office has gotten him nothing to show for it but a life that feels less than fulfilled.  His son resents him, his co-workers take him for granted and he is left with shattered memories of a wife lost in death and a family that regards him as useless.But the point is that he is rather useless.Given a sharp prod in the form of a death sentence, Watanabe attempts to escape this drowning feeling by splurging his savings on a young co-worker who makes him feel alive, for a time.  But, as he soon finds out, simply spending time with someone young and vibrant will not make you young and vibrant.  Watanabe needs something to believe in, to push him and make him feel accomplished.`Ikiru' is a beautifully poignant life lesson for us all.  It's very important that we learn to live our lives to the full while we have the chance.  As the saying goes, `you only live once' and whether or not we think it's for the best, restricting ourselves of happiness is detrimental to our life as well as those around us.  The one point I'm left with more than any other is the hurt Watanabe's actions have had on his relationship with his son.  His son regards him as worthless, and in the beginning my sympathies were solely with Watanabe, thinking that he was been cast aside by his own flesh and blood, but as the film continued and Watanabe himself came face to face with his own mistakes I began to realize that he caused the rift himself.My heart breaks for him, but he is not innocent in the matter.As the film ends one is left with a bitter-sweet aftertaste.  You are thrilled that Watanabe finally got his chance to `live' but you are also left wishing that he had realized this a long time ago, when he had a chance to mend differences and gain a true happiness.Kurosawa's masterpiece is essential viewing for any cinephile like myself.  It's strength lies in the way the story is told, and Kurosawa knew how to tell this story perfectly.  The length shouldn't be an issue, especially once Watanabe gets his second wind about an hour into the film.  The happiness he expresses while out to dinner for the first time with the young woman who has ignited his fire is one of the single most rewarding moments in my movie viewing history!",5,Lessons learned too late are still lessons learned...,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,3007,"['Soaked', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'yet', 'uplifting', 'promise', 'self-empowerment', 'Ikiru', 'Live', 'one', 'most', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'deep-set', 'sadness', 'scene', 'Ikiru', 'message', 'trying', 'portray', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'how', 'best', 'relay', 'message', 'audience', 'are', 'drawn', 'man', 'world', 'feeling', 'ache', 'pain', 'adopt', 'resolve', 'just', 'film', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'story', 'elderly', 'man', 'named', 'Kanji', 'Watanabe', 'out', 'going', 'die', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'Up', 'point', 'life', 'lived', 'shell', 'man', 'working', 'provide', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'Thirty-years', 'faithful', 'service', 'city', 'office', 'gotten', 'nothing', 'show', 'life', 'less', 'fulfilled', 'son', 'co-workers', 'take', 'granted', 'left', 'shattered', 'memories', 'wife', 'lost', 'death', 'family', 'useless.But', 'point', 'rather', 'useless.Given', 'sharp', 'prod', 'form', 'death', 'sentence', 'Watanabe', 'escape', 'drowning', 'feeling', 'splurging', 'savings', 'young', 'co-worker', 'who', 'feel', 'alive', 'time', 'soon', 'out', 'simply', 'spending', 'time', 'someone', 'young', 'vibrant', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'young', 'vibrant', 'Watanabe', 'something', 'believe', 'push', 'make', 'feel', 'accomplished.', 'Ikiru', 'beautifully', 'poignant', 'life', 'lesson', 'very', 'important', 'learn', 'live', 'lives', 'full', 'have', 'chance', 'saying', 'only', 'live', 'once', 'not', 'think', 'best', 'restricting', 'ourselves', 'happiness', 'detrimental', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'point', ""'m"", 'left', 'more', 'other', 'hurt', 'Watanabe', 'actions', 'have', 'had', 'relationship', 'son', 'son', 'worthless', 'beginning', 'sympathies', 'were', 'solely', 'Watanabe', 'thinking', 'was', 'been', 'cast', 'aside', 'own', 'flesh', 'blood', 'film', 'continued', 'Watanabe', 'came', 'face', 'face', 'own', 'mistakes', 'began', 'realize', 'caused', 'rift', 'himself.My', 'heart', 'breaks', 'not', 'innocent', 'matter.As', 'film', 'one', 'left', 'bitter-sweet', 'aftertaste', 'are', 'thrilled', 'Watanabe', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'live', 'are', 'also', 'left', 'wishing', 'had', 'realized', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'mend', 'differences', 'gain', 'true', 'happiness.Kurosawa', 'masterpiece', 'essential', 'viewing', 'cinephile', 'strength', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'Kurosawa', 'knew', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'perfectly', 'length', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'issue', 'especially', 'once', 'Watanabe', 'second', 'wind', 'hour', 'film', 'happiness', 'out', 'dinner', 'first', 'time', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'ignited', 'fire', 'one', 'single', 'most', 'rewarding', 'moments', 'movie', 'viewing', 'history']",N/A
345584,A1VDRK69F22YMN,6302919649,Anticlimacus,"[8, 53]","This review continues my recent assault on particular cinematic themes that annoy me incessantly, and therefore require a therapeutic purging via an extensive (and scathing) IMDb review. The topic in question here is Akira Kurosawa - hereafter referred to as the ""lesser"" Kurosawa, primarily because when one hears the name Kurosawa one should immediately think of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who is superior in almost every respect to this ""lesser"" Kurosawa, a director artificially propped up on an undeserving pedestal by a group of disillusioned followers. Sure, he had one solid film in Seven Samurai (1954), but every time I see his other movies I wonder how the hell anyone could think that this guy was a great director. It befuddles me, even though I am a huge fan of other directors from the same time period.My primary problem with the ""lesser"" Kurosawa is his indisputable ability of getting the absolute worst out of his actors and actresses. In Ran (1985) Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Lord Hidetora) contributes a series of embarrassingly overacted moments during any and all scenes where strong emotion is required. In Hidden Fortress (1958) Misa Uehara (Princess Yuki) gives one of the worst performances of the 1950s. Even Toshiro Mifune had a truly ineptly performance in Rashomon (1950). In Dreams (1991) almost everyone stinks the place out. Ikiru (1952) continues the track record for this ""lesser"" Kurosawa, because Takashi Shimura (who plays Kanji Watanabe) is quite simply horrible in this film. He basically has three modes of facial expression:1. Wimpering Crybaby Mode. 2. Sad Puppy Dog Mode. 3. Hallucinogenic Mode.I'll leave it to the viewer to identify the specific instances where each of these modes are employed by Shimura, but I simply cannot help but comment on #2 above. During Sad Puppy Dog phases, Shimura's face lengthens and his eyes bug-out to make even fruit-flies jealous. Basically, he looks like a 3-year-old after being scolded, not a person of sufficient maturity enduring pain or suffering. He doesn't react to situations like any grown man would. In fact, the Watanabe character is so devoid of basic humanity that he comes off as a stand-in for Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I'm not kidding when I say that Shimura's facial expressions make Ikiru both unintentionally hilarious and infuriating. I literally wanted to strike him with a blunt object or stick needles in his eyes just so he'd stop staring pathetically at me through my television screen.This whole situation ruins the entire film. The crux is that even a mediocre director should have prevented this by instructing Shimura appropriately. This ""lesser"" Kurosawa was apparently incapable of understanding the concept of ""overacting"", so he let Shimura ham it up for 140 minutes. You can almost hear this ""lesser"" Kurosawa behind the camera:""You're a puppy dog, Takashi. You're a puppy dog. Show me those puppy dog eyes!""It's no wonder why George Lucas found ""inspiration"" from the ""lesser"" Kurosawa's works, since Lucas practically perfected the ""art"" of getting the absolute worst out of his actors, regardless of how good they perform when not under the ""influence"" of good ole George.Like many of the other works by this director, Ikiru is about an hour too long. Watching Watanabe go clubbing for 60 minutes was totally unnecessary. The very thin premise was stretched out for so long that I was reminded of Peter Jackson, who needed 600 minutes to tell one of the most basic, formulaic stories in the history of cinema. The ""lesser"" Kurosawa could have trimmed the first half, but in all honesty it would have only made this agonizing cinematic experience shorter, not better. Since the lead protagonist had the reason and intellect of a 3-year-old, there wasn't much in the way of potential development, and what little occurs comes from out of nowhere. The entire maturity of Watanabe is expressed in a segment spanning a few measly minutes, when he goes to work with zeal and runs out the front door to help the people. Kurosawa - in his infinite stupidity - then chooses to cut the sequence off completely, only to then shoot ahead half a year in time to show a bunch of politicians reminiscing about Watanabe's tasks for 45 minutes. There is simply no way that the viewer can relate to the revelatory happiness of the main character through the third-person conversations of characters that had a combined screen time of only a few minutes previously. It's a total miscalculation on the part of the director who takes the cheap way out with an abhorrently overrated ""swing"" scene in the snow. Yes, the scene is pretty, but it simply cannot substitute for a lack of character development that essentially occupies 5 total minutes out of a 140-minute film. And no, I refuse to count 30 minutes of puppy dog glances as character development.The mediocrity of this much-loved ""lesser"" Kurosawa is even more evident in the fact that other, greatly superior dramatic directors like Yasujiro Ozu were making fantastic films like Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1953) - films that make Ikiru (1952) look like amateur hour at best, because they have everything lacking in this film - great acting, storyline, and character development with believable, realistic performances. It's a travesty that exceptional directors like Ozu must live in the shadows of a lesser director that was lucky enough to be admired by a few tasteless Californian bloodsuckers.It's almost humorous that the ""lesser"" Kurosawa came out with Ikiru in the time period in-between Ozu's films mentioned above. We can safely call this a crap sandwich.",2,"Just Another Reason Why The ""Lesser"" Kurosawa Is Easily the Most Overrated Director of All Time",1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,5630,"['review', 'recent',

345585,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,6302919649,Barry C. Chow,"[151, 154]","This is a humble film with the soul of an angel. It isn't about a life so much as it is about the act of living. This film, in its quiet way, asks us to ponder what makes life meaningful. And it argues that our pursuit of life's quantity is misplaced, because it leads to neglect of life's quality.It tells the story of a dying man's last days. Kanji Watanabe is a lifelong cog in a vast bureaucratic machine who has wasted his entire life shuffling papers. He is played by Takashi Shimura in one of the finest understated performances ever committed to film. Shot in black and white, it is melancholic, bleak and subdued. Likely, Kurosawa chose to film in black and white to reflect the starkness of the protagonist's last days; the way the world looks through dying eyes; and it works.It is the mark of Kurosawa's genius how the story and the character sneak up on us. At first, Mr. Watanabe seems an uninspiring study, hardly worthy of our sympathy. A small meek fragile man, he almost stoops under the weight of his own life. He learns of his illness in a well-known opening scene that combines pathos with cruel irony, and before we know it, we start to care about this little man who life treads so callously underfoot. What at first looks like lack of courage reveals itself to be lack of motivation. What we take to be a spineless career of dull conformity turns out to be a sacrifice made for the sake of an unappreciative son. This film has layers and subtlety and visual poetry presented with understatement, finesse and restraint: a wonderful combination that shows the deepest respect for the intelligence of the audience.The moral turning point in the story is reached when Mr Watanabe determines to accomplish one worthwhile achievement before his life ends. We don't realize how involved we have become in this little man's life until we find ourselves mentally urging him onward to overcome every bureaucratic obstacle he encounters. Not so long ago, with the prospect of a long life still stretched out before him, he was one of the very bureaucrats whose job it was to obstruct and confound just such aspirations. Now, with barely months to live, he makes it his duty to champion them. This turn of events is one of the most touching acts of redemption in all of cinema. By making amends for an unworthy past, an ordinary everyman finds life's meaning in his very last act of living.I have watched hundreds of films since Ikiru, but there are scenes from this film that have burned themselves into my heart and are as clear today as the moment I first saw them. This occurs not because the director achieved an especially vivid special effect, but because of how deeply we come to care for our little hero. The famous scene at the end is one of the most dignified and gracious artistic statements ever filmed, yet it is a scene of wounding simplicity: a perfect epitaph to a cinematic elegy.Kurosawa was one of the greatest of all filmmakers and this was his best and most personal film. It's a crime that his work is known only among the literati of the film world, and not to a wider audience. I cannot promise you that you will like this film, because it is paced with a measured and quiet deliberation that is utterly foreign to those raised on a western diet of car crashes, yammering idiots and pixie dust. You need patience, introspection and empathy to appreciate this gentle masterpiece, but if you are the kind of person who is moved by pity, tenderness, humility and grace, then I envy you your first viewing of this ode to the human spirit.",5,A Film For All Seasons,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,3571,"['humble', 'film', 'soul', 'angel', ""n't"", 'life', 'so', 'much', 'act', 'living', 'film', 'quiet', 'way', 'ponder', 'what', 'life', 'meaningful', 'pursuit', 'life', 'quantity', 'misplaced', 'neglect', 'life', 'quality.It', 'story', 'dying', 'man', 'last', 'days', 'Kanji', 'Watanabe', 'lifelong', 'cog', 'vast', 'bureaucratic', 'machine', 'who', 'wasted', 'entire', 'life', 'shuffling', 'papers', 'played', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'one', 'finest', 'understated', 'performances', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Shot', 'black', 'white', 'melancholic', 'bleak', 'subdued', 'Likely', 'Kurosawa', 'chose', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'reflect', 'starkness', 'protagonist', 'last', 'days', 'way', 'world', 'dying', 'eyes', 'mark', 'Kurosawa', 'genius', 'how', 'story', 'character', 'sneak', 'up', 'first', 'Mr.', 'Watanabe', 'uninspiring', 'study', 'hardly', 'worthy', 'sympathy', 'small', 'meek', 'fragile', 'man', 'almost', 'weight', 'own', 'life', 'illness', 'well-known', 'opening', 'scene', 'pathos', 'cruel', 'irony', 'know', 'start', 'care', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'treads', 'so', 'callously', 'underfoot', 'What', 'first', 'looks', 'lack', 'courage', 'reveals', 'be', 'lack', 'motivation', 'What', 'take', 'be', 'spineless', 'career', 'dull', 'conformity', 'out', 'be', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'sake', 'unappreciative', 'son', 'film', 'layers', 'subtlety', 'visual', 'poetry', 'presented', 'understatement', 'finesse', 'restraint', 'wonderful', 'combination', 'deepest', 'respect', 'intelligence', 'audience.The', 'moral', 'turning', 'point', 'story', 'reached', 'when', 'Mr', 'Watanabe', 'accomplish', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'achievement', 'life', 'ends', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'involved', 'have', 'become', 'little', 'man', 'life', 'find', 'mentally', 'urging', 'onward', 'overcome', 'bureaucratic', 'obstacle', 'Not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'prospect', 'long', 'life', 'still', 'stretched', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'bureaucrats', 'job', 'was', 'obstruct', 'confound', 'just', 'such', 'aspirations', 'Now', 'barely', 'months', 'live', 'duty', 'champion', 'turn', 'events', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'acts', 'redemption', 'cinema', 'making', 'amends', 'unworthy', 'past', 'ordinary', 'everyman', 'life', 'meaning', 'very', 'last', 'act', 'living.I', 'have', 'watched', 'hundreds', 'films', 'Ikiru', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'have', 'burned', 'heart', 'are', 'clear', 'today', 'moment', 'first', 'saw', 'not', 'director', 'achieved', 'especially', 'vivid', 'special', 'effect', 'how', 'deeply', 'come', 'care', 'little', 'hero', 'famous', 'scene', 'end', 'one', 'most', 'dignified', 'gracious', 'artistic', 'statements', 'ever', 'filmed', 'scene', 'wounding', 'simplicity', 'perfect', 'epitaph', 'cinematic', 'elegy.Kurosawa', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'best', 'most', 'personal', 'film', 'crime', 'work', 'known', 'only', 'literati', 'film', 'world', 'not', 'wider', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'promise', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'paced', 'measured', 'quiet', 'deliberation', 'utterly', 'foreign', 'raised', 'western', 'diet', 'car', 'crashes', 'yammering', 'idiots', 'pixie', 'dust', 'need', 'patience', 'introspection', 'empathy', 'appreciate', 'gentle', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'moved', 'pity', 'tenderness', 'humility', 'grace', 'then', 'envy', 'first', 'viewing', 'ode', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

An old man, 25 years a do-nothing, paper-pushing bureaucrat, discovers he's dying of cancer. Suddenly he realizes he's lived an empty life and wants to finally do something for himself. He flounders at first looking for a way and then decides to help get a park built by tenaciously fighting through all the red tape necessary to get the job completed.Most of the movie is concerned with the old man's ""false search"" for happiness - getting drunk, trying to befriend his young secretary. But then he hits upon his scheme for doing something worthwhile. And here, I think, Kurosawa blunders: he jumps the clock ahead five months to the man's death and tells the old man's story regarding the park in flashbacks as fellow workers and local politicians reminisce at his funeral. It breaks the flow of the movie badly and also changes its focus - we now get an attack on the bureaucracy. For the most part, however, the movie is very moving and the final word almost on the despair of a life not lived.

Doctors give him  only six months to live.For the first time in his thirty-years, our  hero decides to seek out how to live since he hasn't done it before. So he  gambles, gets drunk, goes out with women and dances but finds that life  empty. He tries to speak with his son who tunes him out. He runs after his  young co-worker whose youth and vibrance motivates but even she hasn't the  answers.The answer he seeks is meaning for a life that hasn't been  lived. It took the spector of death to force him to finally decide how to  live the few remaining breathes that he has left. Takashi Shimura does an  outstanding job in playing our lead character. His quest is our quest as we  live meaningless lives. The people he encounters, the situations he finds  himself in and his final awakening  is a wake up call for all of us.

Buy it now.Oh, you're one of those people who needs to reasoned with, huh? Okay.When people think of Kurosawa, they think of his period films - Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Ran. Those are all fantastic. Some Kurosawa films are better than others, but none of them are bad. But people forget that a large part of his career was taken up with (then) contemporary fare. What makes Ikiru special?The comibnation of craft and content. The movie is exceptionally made. The lighting, the compositions, and the editing all do what they are meant to: come together to advance and develop the story. They do so in a way that is definitely stylish, but unlike so many modern filmmakers, they style serves the story, not the other way around. Kurosawa's camera complements, comments upon, and enhances what it captures. As a study of black and white cinematography, it is pricelessly. Some would criticize its long run time and deliberate pace, common criticisms of Kurosawa. But any story worth telling is worth telling in its own time, and the pacing is dead on for the content.What is that content? Perennial Kurosawa collaborator Takashi Shimura (Seven Samurai) stars as Kanji Watanabe, a slug-like department head in the Tokyo city bureaucracy. He's unloved by his minions, unappreciated by his family, and unnoticed by life. The film deals with his gradual transformation upon learning that he has terminal cancer. Though often grueling, it's ultimately a triumphant movie, and not in that false, schmaltzy and sentimental way that most contemporary movies deliver.The protagonist achieves his transfiguration, but he does it silently and anoymously, and at the end, few even understand what he's done. Just like real life.Although Japanese, and presenting a fascinating glimpse into that culture, it is also universal (Kurosawa was often criticized in his homeland for not being Japanese enough, whatever the hell that means). If you are at all interested in the history of film, or what goes into good filmmaking, or even if you just love a good story well told, you should look into this movie.

Han ""churl""","[15, 17]","I should start by saying that I think Ikiru is the best movie I've ever seen, but I'll try to address some of the negatives.The story of Ikiru is that of a bureaucrat who upon learning he has stomach cancer begins a desperate search for meaning in his life. He tries family, liquor, and women, but eventually finds purpose in a cesspool that troubles a local community, and their attempts to have a playground built on the site.The story is absolutely compelling, and the intricate subtleties of Kurosawa's direction make this film very powerful, especially in the second half of the film, where Watanabe's (the protagonist) coworkers discuss his final few months at his wake. The acting is superb. Takashi Shimura gives a performance that is stand out.Ikiru is not a universally liked movie, for several reasons. The movie is black and white and has subtitles. The cuts and scene changes have a very old-fashioned feel to them (quite rightly... it's old. But this gives a lot of people trouble). The pacing of this movie is deliberate, and by that I mean slow. It is not quick or action-packed. It moves subtlely.While most all the reviews rave about it, I'd caution that this movie will not beat you over the head with its brilliance. It is a gentle story with subtle nuances, and often, the meaning is conveyed more in facial expressions and quiet moments than in anything said or done.That being said, I thought the transfer of this movie to DVD was terrible. It is my understanding that this was the best that could be done, which is a shame. Many feel this to be Kurosawa's best work, and to know that this terrible transfer is the best it can ever get, that's sad. Specifically, the vertical lines noted in previous reviews are definitely there, and definitely problematic. There is poor contrast, and it is often difficult to see the actors defined well at all.The bonus material on this DVD is so so. The commentary is certainly interesting, but the documentaries didn't thrill me too much. The main sell of this DVD is the movie itself.If this movie sounds like something you can sit through, you should watch it. It's a great movie. I really do think it's the best movie I've ever seen. But it's not for everyone. If you've already seen it and want to own it, this DVD set is fine, but it comes with the caveat that the quality of the transfer is not impressive.",5,"Excellent movie, but terrible transfer",1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,2373,"['should', 'start', 'saying', 'think', 'Ikiru', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'try', 'address', 'negatives.The', 'story', 'Ikiru', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'learning', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'desperate', 'search', 'meaning', 'life', 'family', 'liquor', 'women', 'eventually', 'purpose', 'cesspool', 'local', 'community', 'attempts', 'have', 'playground', 'built', 'site.The', 'story', 'absolutely', 'compelling', 'intricate', 'subtleties', 'Kurosawa', 'direction', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'where', 'Watanabe', 'protagonist', 'coworkers', 'discuss', 'final', 'few', 'months', 'wake', 'acting', 'superb', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'performance', 'stand', 'out.Ikiru', 'not', 'universally', 'liked', 'movie', 'several', 'reasons', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'subtitles', 'cuts', 'scene', 'changes', 'have', 'very', 'old-fashioned', 'feel', 'quite', 'rightly', 'old', 'lot', 'people', 'trouble', 'pacing', 'movie', 'deliberate', 'mean', 'slow', 'not', 'quick', 'action-packed', 'subtlely.While', 'most', 'reviews', 'rave', ""'d"", 'caution', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'beat', 'head', 'brilliance', 'gentle', 'story', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'often', 'meaning', 'conveyed', 'more', 'facial', 'expressions', 'quiet', 'moments', 'anything', 'said', 'done.That', 'being', 'said', 'thought', 'transfer', 'movie', 'DVD', 'was', 'terrible', 'understanding', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'shame', 'Many', 'feel', 'be', 'Kurosawa', 'best', 'work', 'know', 'terrible', 'transfer', 'best', 'can', 'ever', 'get', 'sad', 'Specifically', 'vertical', 'lines', 'noted', 'previous', 'reviews', 'are', 'definitely', 'there', 'definitely', 'problematic', 'poor', 'contrast', 'often', 'difficult', 'see', 'actors', 'defined', 'well', 'all.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'so', 'so', 'commentary', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'documentaries', 'did', ""n't"", 'thrill', 'too', 'much', 'main', 'sell', 'DVD', 'movie', 'itself.If', 'movie', 'something', 'can', 'sit', 'should', 'watch', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'want', 'own', 'DVD', 'set', 'fine', 'caveat', 'quality', 'transfer', 'not', 'impressive']",N/A
345592,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,6302919649,Chris Fung,"[24, 25]","I agree with all the other reviews which have discussed ""Ikiru"" in terms of its message for the individual: live your life with meaning and purpose, take pleasure in helping others, cherish and nurture children.  However, there is one other aspect that I'd like to highlight: Kurosawa's thoughts on the individual and society.As the commentary by Stephen Prince makes clear, one of the main points behind Kurosawa's work was a head-on critique of Japanese society in the immediate post-war era.Although this period laid the foundation for Japan's economic recovery, Kurosawa is not alone in pointing out that the drive for economic prosperity was accomplished at huge human and spiritual cost.  This idea is also one of the prime motivators behind the work of other Japanese artists from humanists like Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away"", ""Princess Mononoke"") to the lunatic right as exemplified by Mishima.Kurosawa uses Watanabe Kenji as a foil to expose the hypocrisy and selfishness of a society that values materialism and order above humanity and mindfulness.  On the one hand, as most of the other reviewers have pointed out,  Kurosawa condemns the way the bureaucratic small-mindedness of government stifles any real concern for the well-being of ordinary people. On the other, Watanabe's son and daughter-in-law embody the new age's impatience with its elders and their inability to see beyond their own concerns even when the people around them are clearly in crisis.A number of people have complained about the length of the second half of the movie, but (as Prince's commentary again makes clear), the flashbacks are important to establish a stronger  sense of Watanabe's co-workers as characters both to illustrate their gradual understanding of the meaning of Watanabe's life but also to highlight their inability to really follow his example.  Kurosawa's view of society is pretty cynical when you come right down to it. Even though many of his works are celebrations of individual creativity and spirit, he is also forthright about the forces arrayed against it: small-mindedness, fear of making mistakes, greed and the herd mentality.  It's no wonder that he has often been accused of being ""un-Japanese"".One can also see this thread in Kurosawa's later movies including his period pieces such as ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Kagemusha"":  in both of these films, the ordinary folks and the high and mighty are also found wanting as groups.  While there may be individuals of principle, they will not prevail in the end.

345595,A256F7E787F5SG,6302919649,Christopher Nieman,"[11, 12]","I think IKIRU is probably Akira Kurosawa's most overlooked masterpiece, especially since it was followed by SEVEN SAMURAI in 1954. IKIRU is a work of unparalleled maturity, where Kurosawa takes the time to tell a story in a completely unapologetic and deliberate way. This will confront you in a way no other film will, reaching the deep-seated fears we all have about our deaths. It is overwhelmingly sad, and yet it is inspiring and heartfelt. IKIRU is Akira Kurosawa's most deeply moving, most human, and most timeless film.The film opens with the realization that Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) has cancer and will die in a matter of months. Upon discovering his fate, Watanabe realizes that despite raising a son and working dutifully at his job for almost 25 years, he has never truly lived, and has not really made his mark on the world. And so Watanabe begins a personal journey that will become his legacy. Along the way, he will experience things he's never experienced, enjoy things he's never enjoyed, and do things thought to be impossible. In a sense, the story unfolds like a dark Frank Capra film.Perhaps one of life's most monumental crises is to suddenly look back and realize there are still many things we haven't done, and to know that we haven't enough time to do them all. Some of us reach a time in life when we question the direction our lives have taken, and this film boldly explores that difficult subject. IKIRU (meaning ""to live"") deserves its rightful place among Akira Kurosawa's numerous classics. The power of its story shows us that no matter when we reach that point of self-questioning, it needn't be too late to seek out an unreachable dream and fulfill it, if we are determined.",5,Kurosawa's most timeless classic,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,1713,"['think', 'IKIRU', 'probably', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'most', 'overlooked', 'masterpiece', 'especially', 'was', 'followed', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI', '1954', 'IKIRU', 'work', 'unparalleled', 'maturity', 'where', 'Kurosawa', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'completely', 'unapologetic', 'deliberate', 'way', 'will', 'confront', 'way', 'other', 'film', 'will', 'reaching', 'deep-seated', 'fears', 'have', 'deaths', 'overwhelmingly', 'sad', 'yet', 'inspiring', 'heartfelt', 'IKIRU', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'most', 'deeply', 'moving', 'most', 'human', 'most', 'timeless', 'film.The', 'film', 'realization', 'Watanabe', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'cancer', 'will', 'die', 'matter', 'months', 'discovering', 'fate', 'Watanabe', 'raising', 'son', 'working', 'dutifully', 'job', 'almost', '25', 'years', 'never', 'truly', 'lived', 'not', 'really', 'made', 'mark', 'world', 'so', 'Watanabe', 'personal', 'journey', 'will', 'become', 'legacy', 'way', 'will', 'experience', 'things', 'never', 'experienced', 'enjoy', 'things', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'do', 'things', 'thought', 'be', 'impossible', 'sense', 'story', 'unfolds', 'dark', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'one', 'life', 'most', 'monumental', 'crises', 'suddenly', 'look', 'back', 'realize', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'do', 'reach', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'question', 'direction', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'boldly', 'difficult', 'subject', 'IKIRU', 'meaning', 'live', 'rightful', 'place', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'numerous', 'classics', 'power', 'story', 'shows', 'matter', 'when', 'reach', 'point', 'self-questioning', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'late', 'seek', 'out', 'unreachable', 'dream', 'fulfill', 'are', 'determined']",N/A
345596,A16DMCKV9RMQGI,6302919649,"Continental Op ""philmarlowe39""","[6, 6]","&quot;Ikiru&quot;--roughly translated--means &quot;to live&quot; and concerns the existentialist struggles of one elderly man who is diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and his eventual discovery of what the meaning of life truly is.Kurosawa veteran Takashi Shimura (&quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;) plays Kanji Watanabe, a miserly career bureaucrat who has risen to the rank of bureau chief of the Department of Public Affairs, although his only career accomplishment is having never missed a day in 30 years at his boring, meaningless job.  His relationship with his co-workers is practically non-existent, and one of them even gives him the nickname &quot;The Mummy.&quot;Watanabe's personal life isn't much better.  His wife and mother of his son died many years ago and he never remarried.  Furthermore, he is estranged from his son and daughter-in-law, as they--ignorant of his grave medical condition--only seem concerned with how much money he will leave them as an inheritance when he eventually dies.When given the death sentence by a local physician, Watanabe--understandably devastated--skips out on work and decides to indulge in the pleasures of the flesh that he had missed out on for so many years.  He blows 50,000 yen in one night of drinking and carousing, and later seeks the platonic affection of a young ex-co-worker.  Unsatisfied with these pursuits, he later becomes inspired to dedicate his live to improving the lives of others, as he bites the hand that feeds him by ceaselessly and tirelessly fights the entrenched, mind-numbing local bureaucracy to get a public park built for an impoverished neighborhood.The film's greatest strengths lay in Shimura's tender performance and its powerful message that life is too short and precious to waste away doing nothing and that one person--with enough will and dedication--can make a positive difference in a seemingly uncaring world.  Watanabe only beings to live after he learns that he is about to die.  Where he used to sleepwalk through life, shuffling papers, Watanabe now takes the time to appreciate life's simple pleasures such as the beauty of a sunset, or playing on a swingset on a snowy night.&quot;Ikiru&quot; is a call to action that is more moving and powerful than similar Hollywood fare such as &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; because it does not concern a group of spotty-faced kids with their whole lives ahead of them, but an old man who deeply regrets wasting his own life.  It commands the audience to take action to make a difference in the world, and sums up Plato's ethos &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living.&quot;The film is also innovative in that its last 45 minutes occur at Watanabe's funeral, as drunken bureaucrats--in a moment of clarity--bemoan the drudgery of their own lives, mournfully recalling Watanabe's tireless efforts to build the park through flashbacks.It should be noted that &quot;Ikiru&quot; is quite different from the samurai epics that director Akira Kurosawa is so famous for.  For the viewer looking for the thrilling epic battle scenes of medieval Japan, they should try &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, or &quot;Ran.&quot;  Also, unlike those films, &quot;Ikiru&quot; is devoid of the shouting and yelling that seems to predominate Kurosawa's work.  Perhaps because &quot;Ikiru&quot; is set in then-present day Japan (1952), the characters talk like everyday human beings, as opposed to dramatic ancient warriors.The film's biggest flaw would be its length.  It clocks in at 143 minutes (that's 2 hours and 23 minutes if you're counting), and anyone raised on a diet of MTV and Jerry Bruckheimer will find the pacing to be a trial.  While Kurosawa's editor could have cut some scenes out, the film's simple message is powerful and surprisingly uplifting considering that you spend 105 minutes watching a dying man, and the next 38 minutes at his funeral.&quot;Ikiru&quot; is a simple, quiet, powerful film that will cause you to examine or re-examine your own life, and show you that the greatest tragedy in life isn't dying, but not living.",4,Carpe Diem,1084060800,"05 9, 2004",2004,4119,"['quot', 'Ikiru', 'quot', 'roughly', 'translated', 'quot', 'live', 'quot', 'existentialist', 'one', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'eventual', 'discovery', 'what', 'meaning', 'life', 'truly', 'is.Kurosawa', 'veteran', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'quot', 'Rashomon', 'quot', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'Kanji', 'Watanabe', 'miserly', 'career', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'risen', 'rank', 'bureau', 'chief', 'Department', 'Public', 'Affairs', 'only', 'career', 'accomplishment', 'having', 'never', 'missed', 'day', '30', 'years', 'boring', 'meaningless', 'job', 'relationship', 'co-workers', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'one', 'even', 'nickname', 'quot', 'Mummy.', 'quot', 'Watanabe', 'personal', 'life', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'wife', 'mother', 'son', 'died', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'remarried', 'Furthermore', 'estranged', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'ignorant', 'grave', 'medical', 'condition', 'only', 'seem', 'concerned', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'will', 'leave', 'inheritance', 'when', 'eventually', 'dies.When', 'given', 'death', 'sentence', 'local', 'physician', 'Watanabe', 'understandably', 'devastated', 'skips', 'out', 'work', 'decides', 'indulge', 'pleasures', 'flesh', 'had', 'missed', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'years', '50,000', 'yen', 'one', 'night', 'drinking', 'carousing', 'later', 'platonic', 'affection', 'young', 'ex-co-worker', 'Unsatisfied', 'pursuits', 'later', 'inspired', 'dedicate', 'live', 'improving', 'lives', 'others', 'hand', 'ceaselessly', 'tirelessly', 'entrenched', 'mind-numbing', 'local', 'bureaucracy', 'get', 'public', 'park', 'built', 'impoverished', 'neighborhood.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'lay', 'Shimura', 'tender', 'performance', 'powerful', 'message', 'life', 'too', 'short', 'precious', 'waste', 'away', 'doing', 'nothing', 'one', 'person', 'enough', 'will', 'dedication', 'can', 'make', 'positive', 'difference', 'seemingly', 'uncaring', 'world', 'Watanabe', 'only', 'live', 'die', 'Where', 'used', 'sleepwalk', 'life', 'shuffling', 'papers', 'Watanabe', 'now', 'time', 'appreciate', 'life', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'such', 'beauty', 'sunset', 'playing', 'swingset', 'snowy', 'night.', 'quot', 'Ikiru', 'quot', 'call', 'action', 'more', 'moving', 'powerful', 'similar', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'such', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'quot', 'not', 'concern', 'group', 'spotty-faced', 'kids', 'whole', 'lives', 'ahead', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'regrets', 'wasting', 'own', 'life', 'audience', 'take', 'action', 'make', 'difference', 'world', 'sums', 'up', 'Plato', 'ethos', 'quot', 'unexamined', 'life', 'not', 'worth', 'living.', 'quot', 'film', 'also', 'innovative', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'occur', 'Watanabe', 'funeral', 'drunken', 'bureaucrats', 'moment', 'clarity', 'bemoan', 'drudgery', 'own', 'lives', 'mournfully', 'recalling', 'Watanabe', 'tireless', 'efforts', 'build', 'park', 'flashbacks.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'quot', 'Ikiru', 'quot', 'quite', 'different', 'samurai', 'epics', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'so', 'famous', 'viewer', 'looking', 'thrilling', 'epic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'medieval', 'Japan', 'should', 'try', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yojimbo', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ran.', 'quot', 'Also', 'films', 'quot', 'Ikiru', 'quot', 'devoid', 'shouting', 'yelling', 'predominate', 'Kurosawa', 'work', 'Perhaps', 'quot', 'Ikiru', 'quot', 'set', 'then-present', 'day', 'Japan', '1952', 'characters', 'talk', 'everyday', 'human', 'beings', 'opposed', 'dramatic', 'ancient', 'warriors.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'would', 'be', 'length', '143', 'minutes', '2', 'hours', '23', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'counting', 'anyone', 'raised', 'diet', 'MTV', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'will', 'find', 'pacing', 'be', 'trial', 'Kurosawa', 'editor', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'scenes', 'out', 'film', 'simple', 'message', 'powerful', 'surprisingly', 'uplifting', 'considering', 'spend', '105', 'minutes', 'watching', 'dying', 'man', 'next', '38', 'minutes', 'funeral.', 'quot', 'Ikiru', 'quot', 'simple', 'quiet', 'powerful', 'film', 'will', 'cause', 'examine', 're-examine', 'own', 'life', 'show', 'greatest', 'tragedy', 'life', ""n't"", 'dying', 'not', 'living']",N/A
345597,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6302919649,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","Ikiru (To Live), by Akira Kurosawa, is sort of a `lost' film. No, it was never really lost, but it is unlike the archetypal Kurosawa film Western audiences think of him making, and thereby lost in his canon. It is not some historical epic filled with honor, samurais, and swordplay. It is more in line with the genre of retrospective life films in the vein of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, in that we drop in the on the life of an ordinary man- in this case lifelong low level Tokyo city bureaucrat office head Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a few months before his death by stomach cancer, and witness how this `living mummy', as his co-workers chide him (one of the nicer things they say about him), reclaims meaning in a life long since blanched of it. Unlike Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate, or Isak Borg, a renowned Academic, Watanabe is the sort of man most people would ignore.His devotion to his work life only accentuates his forgetability, for he seems somehow pleased with himself and his existence (or maybe just narcotized), merely rubber stamping projects here and there, or assisting his underlings in giving grieving citizens the bureaucratic runaround. Yet, as soon as we, and he, get confirmation of his cancer (although his doctors, in Japanese tradition deny it, and Kurosawa deftly skewers this absurd tradition in a hilarious scene where another stomach patient- played by Atsushi Watanabe- tells Watanabe exactly what horrors to expect from the doctors and the disease, and is right) something within Watanabe shifts. A mere month shy of setting the all time record for perfect attendance, he skips out of work for a few days. The non-news of his impending demise has shattered all his desires for conformity.... This is a great film, and Shimura (a veteran of the Godzilla films I loved in my youth, as well a Kurosawa regular film player) gives a great performance. The way he imposes his will on the gangsters, bureaucrats, and politicians to get the park built shows smart subversion at its best, and possibly enough to make up for the years of living death between his wife's death and his graves-edge rebirth. Like Rashomon, which preceded it in the Kurosawa canon, Ikiru deals with perspective, but not the perspective of many on one event, but the perspective of many on many things: life, a man, a park, accomplishment. It is, in that way, something like Rashomon 2. It is one of the many reasons this is such a great film. Another is that while the first two thirds of the film, while Watanabe lives, is great, there have been Hollywood films that come close to it- in construction and true sentiment. But, no Hollywood film has ever done what the last third of this film does, craft a stage play that can basically stand alone as an existential debate on life and art, purposiveness and meaning. This daring and depth is what soars Ikiru past lesser films. Even Citizen Kane, as great and influential a film as that is, was not as daring narratively, as this film, for the themes of the film, while profound, are not really original. It's all how the film presents these issues, starting with the film's first shot of an X-Ray of Watanabe's stomach cancer. Despite all that is to occur, Kurosawa never lets us forget that all of what occurs is due to a few cells in a man's stomach that forgot how to behave. Without the cancer, Watanabe remains a mummy for years more, and the slum children have no park to relieve, however briefly, their misery.Yet, even more profound than the philosophy of the film, is its realism. By the end of the film, we see that Watanabe's co-workers truly are bureaucratic scum. They talk the talk at his wake, but refuse to walk Watanabe's walk. Watanabe's victory is small, and temporal. Likely, the gangsters will find another way to corrupt that area, and with Watanabe gone there is no one left in his office who will care. Kurosawa has shown us victory, but acknowledges it may be Pyrrhic, at best. It is also the greatest artistic indictment of bureaucracies ever made, and not just of Post-War Japan's problems, nor even Japan's for the three tenets of Japanese bureaucracy- be punctual, never take off, and do nothing, are universal, even if only codified in Japan. We see this most eloquently in the scenes of Watanabe skipping work, for the office work comes to a halt and the mountain of paperwork continues to bloat.Some believe that the famed Tolstoy story, The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, is the basis for this film, since both involve petty bureaucrats who die, but Ikiru is the far greater work of art, for it about life, not merely its waste. Ilyich cannot cope with life, while Watanabe, however, acts upon his demise's coming, but why he does, is a bit of a mystery. We can only assume his motives, for Kurosawa keeps much of his motivation a secret, as Watanabe spends quite some time `offstage', even when alive. Perhaps the only flaw in the film is in the subtitling, with white subtitles almost blanched out in some of the shots, but that's not anything Kurosawa had control over. That which he did shows mastery, something he never seems to have lost.",5,Masterpiece,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,5179,"['Ikiru', 'Live', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'sort', 'lost', 'film', 'No', 'was',

I'm sure that the vast majority of those who have contributed reviews here, and more broadly, those who have seen this film, would agree with my assessment: Hands down, Ikiru. Ikiru is not a ""fun"" film to watch (although some scenes seem so antiquated and, well, funky, as to be hilarious). The film is not ""entertaining"".  As life often does, the film moves at a belabored pace. The situations are prosaic, predictable, protracted - often painful, and painfully slow.  The characters are almost universally unattractive, often downright ugly, on the outside, on the inside. I found the film, for the longest time, somewhat irritating in its presentation. The low budget simplicity grates. The seamy, threadbare side of life gets tiresome to watch.  And the acting - enough ham to fill the pots for a many a Sunday dinner. But, in the end, surprisingly almost, everything works.The unforgettable last frame . . . even more than the noted swing scene, is, as it should be, the real climax of what turns out to be a most profoundly moving tale. . .

He withdraws money from his savings and decides to experience life before death overtakes him.Initially he finds a mentor, played by Seiji Miyaguchi (Kyuzo in Seven Samurai), who leads him on a tour of night spots: drinking, dancing and whoring, playing pachinko. He finds no satisfaction, however, and soon chances to meet a young woman from his office who seeks him out because she needs his hanko (seal) to make her resignation from the government job official. She complains of the boredom and meaninglessness of the work and confesses that she has bestowed nicknames on all the officials of the department. His nickname: ""The Mummy.""Watanabe spends some time with the young woman, buying her stockings and trying to emulate her carefree approach to life. She has taken a rather boring and meaningless job, but professes to enjoy it. Meanwhile, Watanabe's son and daughter-in-law, crassly concerned only with the old man's savings and his retirement allowance, are appalled by the change that has come over him.Soon the relationship, like his fling with the mizu shobai world, proves unrewarding. Watanabe returns to his job after two weeks absence. His co-workers are surprised to see him, and even more surprised when he ignores established convention and takes an aggressive role in promoting the development of a park for which citizens have pleaded, meeting only with excuses and delays from government officials. Watanabe refuses to shunt this request to another department in the endless bureaucratic shuffle that is characteristic of Japanese officialdom.Almost half the movie takes place following Watanabe's death. At a mourning ceremony, a group of citizens come to protest the lack of recognition given to Watanabe for the park (the Deputy Mayor has taken credit in a public speech). Watanabe's co-workers get drunk and some of them speak their minds: Watanabe was the real creator of the park, for which the Deputy Mayor and others have taken credit. Conformity, and peer pressure, are nowhere more evident than in these scenes. The few courageous admirers of Watanabe stand out like the proverbial ""nail that sticks up."" Citizens come to pay their respects, to the discomfort of the bureaucrats, most of whom are still slaves of convention. Even Watanabe's son cannot face the magnitude of his father's heroic actions.Takashi Shimura gives an eloquent performance as Watanabe. There are moving scenes of the park, children playing, and Watanabe swinging, alone in the dark with snow falling, on the night of his death (which took place, appropriately, at the spot he had created and left behind for the people he served.)

Wilcock ""journal-ist""","[0, 0]","As a big fan of Kurosawa and the Criterion Collection, I couldn't wait to recieve this DVD in the mail.Human life can be lost before a person dies, Kurosawa's film shows, and it is difficult for anyone to remain truly alive with all of life's challenges and setbacks. Like a thin thread, life's inspiration is easy to lose. But what happens when a man loses that thread for decades and discovers it again only months before dying?The answer to this question is both heart-warming and heart-breaking. But ultimately this film will burn brightly in the viewer's mind.Two years after becoming world famous for Rashomon, Kurosawa released this thematic sequal - a meditation on truth and meaning in the modern world. While Rashomon became a cinematic landmark, I think this film blows rashomon away. It, along with Ozu's Tokyo Story, are the most moving films I've ever seen.What makes Kurosawa so great here? It is the centrality of the movie's meaning. We all die and we all struggle to find truth. Watanabe, a placid and unquestioning bureaucrat, glimpses the truth about his life when he finds that he has only months to live. He immediately sets out to live his life to the fullest - eventually granting the dearest wish of the citizens that the other bureaucrats would just rather ignore.But like the man who emerges into the sunlight from the cave in Plato's allegory - none of the other cave dwellers understand his actions.In fact, it's worse, the grandstanding officials claim credit Watanabe's inspired actions, despite having stood in his way.But ultimately the truth saves Watanabe before he dies. This is masterful filmaking - more on par with Kurosawa's heroes Dostoyevsky and Shakespeare than his cinematic peers. It is a must purchase for his fans and, I think, a story that will move the viewer towards greater compassion and consciousness of life passing by.Perhaps it's no wonder Criterion chose this fim to include two feature documentaries on Kurosawa on a second disc.

Pawl ""Dani""","[14, 14]","Though Akira Kurosawa is perhaps best-known for his samurai films (YOJIMBO, SEVEN SAMURAI, as a couple of examples), IKIRU takes a detour from that theme and, for me, was one of the finest films he made.  Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a public servant and has worked for the government for thirty years.  His days consist of pushing papers around on his desk and adding a stamp of approval to a slew of documents.  When he learns that he will soon succumb to untreatable stomach cancer, every aspect of his mundane existence is turned on its head.  For so many years, this man has lived ""off to the side"" in his life and he doesn't have the time to do that anymore.  His newly found attitude, that comes with the realization of his irreversible fate, leads to a multitude of life changes that those around him aren't sure what to make of.  Ultimately, Watanabe's new approach to the world and what his part is on the earth manages to touch everyone around him (for good or worse).  This film co-stars Shinichi Himori and Haruo Tanaka.IKIRU shows a beautifully poignant side of Kurosawa, as a storyteller.  We see a man in Watanabe that we probably all have encountered at some point (maybe that man even exists within us!).  This individual has spent so many years as a cog in the wheel of life that he has put aside his emotions and true feelings just to get by without starting trouble.  The beautiful cinematography in this story particularly well-showcases Watanabe's physical deterioration in the face of his illness.  His eyes speak volumes about his physical pain, and yet he finds new-found strength to cling on to life in the wake of his last breaths in this world.  This feeling of urgency is contrasted by moments of newly realized joy and gratitude.  There are so many haunting moments, whether we are watching Watanabe interact with his white collar colleagues or breaking loose for a night on the town with a vagabond he encounters at a bar, the night that the two men really go out for a night on the town.  This is a beautifully made film and really is timeless.  I have a hard time believing that this was made in 1952 because it could have been released just yesterday.  It is truly a fine depiction of the human condition and the fragility of the life with which we have been given.",5,what would you do if you had six months to live?,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,2301,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'perhaps', 'best-known', 'samurai', 'films', 'YOJIMBO', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI', 'couple', 'examples', 'IKIRU', 'detour', 'theme', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'made', 'Watanabe', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'public', 'servant', 'worked', 'government', 'thirty', 'years', 'days', 'consist', 'pushing', 'papers', 'desk', 'adding', 'stamp', 'approval', 'slew', 'documents', 'When', 'will', 'soon', 'succumb', 'untreatable', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'aspect', 'mundane', 'existence', 'turned', 'head', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'man', 'lived', 'side', 'life', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'do', 'anymore', 'newly', 'found', 'attitude', 'realization', 'irreversible', 'fate', 'multitude', 'life', 'changes', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Ultimately', 'Watanabe', 'new', 'approach', 'world', 'what', 'part', 'earth', 'touch', 'everyone', 'good', 'worse', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Shinichi', 'Himori', 'Haruo', 'Tanaka.IKIRU', 'beautifully', 'poignant', 'side', 'Kurosawa', 'storyteller', 'see', 'man', 'Watanabe', 'probably', 'have', 'encountered', 'point', 'maybe', 'man', 'even', 'individual', 'spent', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'cog', 'wheel', 'life', 'put', 'aside', 'emotions', 'true', 'feelings', 'just', 'get', 'starting', 'trouble', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'story', 'particularly', 'well-showcases', 'Watanabe', 'physical', 'deterioration', 'face', 'illness', 'eyes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'physical', 'pain', 'yet', 'new-found', 'strength', 'cling', 'life', 'wake', 'last', 'breaths', 'world', 'feeling', 'urgency', 'contrasted', 'moments', 'newly', 'realized', 'joy', 'gratitude', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'haunting', 'moments', 'are', 'watching', 'Watanabe', 'interact', 'white', 'collar', 'colleagues', 'breaking', 'loose', 'night', 'town', 'vagabond', 'bar', 'night', 'two', 'men', 'really', 'go', 'out', 'night', 'town', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'really', 'timeless', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'was', 'made', '1952', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'just', 'yesterday', 'truly', 'fine', 'depiction', 'human', 'condition', 'fragility', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'given']",N/A
345605,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302919649,Ed Uyeshima,"[13, 13]","I wonder if it's a coincidence that Yasujiro Ozu's 1953 ""Tokyo Story"" and this 1952 masterwork from Akira Kurosawa were released just months apart in Japan, as both deal with the disappointments between parents and children in similarly penetrating ways. It's likely that post-WWII Japan, especially after the Allied occupation ended in 1951, saw an overall deterioration of the family unit as Western influences took hold of the socioeconomic structure.  This one goes even further in adding local government bureaucracy as a key factor in diminishing the self-worth of those who sacrificed their lives in meaningless jobs. A particularly effective sequence early in the film involves the local bureau's reaction to a proposal to build a park with each department representative claiming that its hands are tied and passing the buck to another department in ceaseless red tape.The focus here is on Kanji Watanabe, a stamp-wielding chief of affairs who routinely halts civic project proposals that come across his desk, which is covered with stacks of unread documents. At his job for thirty years, Watanabe earns the nickname of ""The Mummy"" for his catatonic manner, but when he learns he has stomach cancer and has six months to live, he takes stock of all he has left undone. Saddled with a son and daughter-in-law who hypocritically feel burdened by him (even though they live in his house), Watanabe embarks on an obsessive journey to find redemption. It takes him from Tokyo's seedy nightlife - some of the more vibrantly surreal scenes are contained here - through an oddly erratic and strictly platonic relationship with a young female colleague named Toyo, whose spirit inspires him to do something right before he dies. The last hour of the lengthy film suddenly becomes a flashback from Watanabe's wake, which retraces his monomaniacal effort to support a group of housewives to build a children's playground where a toxic cesspool exists. The switch in perspective is initially jarring, but it gradually makes sense as it is meant to show the effect of Watanabe's good deeds on others and questions whether they will have a lasting effect on them. As it turns out, the cancer liberates Watanabe from the futile life he led and makes him a greater man than anyone could have imagined with the park as his undeniable legacy.Truth be told, Kurosawa is not as subtle as Ozu when treading such sensitive subject matter, for instance, Kurosawa films actual flashback scenes to understand Watanabe's evolving relationship with his son, whereas Ozu would merely imply the distance between them. However, Kurosawa builds the appropriate gravitas as the story unfolds in a sometimes glacial manner. Takashi Shimura, a Kurosawa regular who would gain greater renown as the leader of ""The Seven Samurai"" two years later, is deeply affecting as Watanabe. With his frozen cow-eyes and slumping posture, he captures the discomforting nature of this hapless man who finds his purpose just before it's too late. He achieves a brutal poignancy with his nightclub-set singing of his theme song, ""Life Is Brief"", his lips hardly moving and his eyes cast in a downward stare toward oblivion. The last shot of him on the swing, magically framed by a jungle gym in a light snowfall as he sings his theme, is an utterly transcendent moment. I am on the fence about Miki Odagiri's performance as Toyo - on one hand, she fully embodies the free, uninhibited spirit of her downscale character, and yet, she can go overboard with her ebullience during key moments. I also feel the nightlife sequences go on a little too long as they appear to provide simply an opportunity for an indulgent novelist, played by Yunosuke Ito, to go on about the joys of the road not taken.Minor flaws aside, this is a moving film that encompasses the importance of bringing purpose to one's life even if you have little time left in this world.

345606,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,6302919649,Ernest Jagger,"[244, 246]","There are many wonderful reviews on this site about why the film ""Ikiru"" is so great. And many are beautifully written. I have seen many films in my life, yet ""Ikiru"" stands head and shoulders above any I have ever seen. For me, the film is not only the greatest Japanese film ever, but the greatest film of all-time. One of the reviewers [BARRY C. CHOW] gave a very good and poignant review of this film. And I hope he is wrong that the film will not appeal ""to those raised on a western diet of car crashes, yammering idiots and pixie dust."" However, maybe in time, when these viewers have grown older, wiser, and have experienced life, then these viewers will come to appreciate the pure genius of this Kurosawa classic.I know that writing that this is the greatest film of all-time is a bold statement. So let me clarify it a bit more: It is my favorite film of all-time. I have seen countless films, but none have had the impact that this film has had on me. Ikiru (To Live) is not a film about dying: but how we live our lives. And in this short life of ours how we live our life matters. Are we kind to our neighbors? Do we care for our children? And just as important: Do we spend enough quality time with them? This is a quiet and simple film. The main protagonist Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) has gone through his life as another cog in the bureaucratic office where he works.Maybe at one time in his life he had dreams of better things; yet with time he grows accustomed to his job; and is no longer alive with the passion of what makes life enjoyable. Yes, one can belong to a  bureaucratic machine; but one can also make a difference, as we the viewer are about to find out. Moreover, we can also live a life outside of our jobs. We can all make a difference no matter what our life's work entails. However, events in Watanabe's life are about to take a different turn. A turn for the worse, and yet, also a redeeming turn for the better. When Watanabe is diagnosed with an incurable illness, he sets about to give some meaning to a life wasted as a lifetime bureaucrat. For our humble protagonist realizes that his life must have a meaning. Watanabe realizes that through all the wasted years since his wifes death he has not accomplished anything worthwhile. Alienated from his son, he sets about to correct in what little time he has remaining to make some sort of contribution to society.And this contribution comes in the way of a childrens park. Akira Kurosawa does not insult his viewers with a grand design of a holy crusader about to change the world. No, for Mr. Watanabe, the simple desire to build a childrens park is all that he seeks. Simple and yet all so poignant. We the viewer follow Mr. Watanabe as he meets the very bureaucratic headaches that he himself was once a part of, but no longer. We have sympathy for Mr. Watanabe as goes about trying to cut through all the red tape in order to see the park built before he dies. No longer the obstructionist bureaucrat, he now comes face to face with the very obstacles others have faced when he was once the obstructionist.This is Watanabe's attempt to make amends for his own past. This is not only Kurosawa's greatest film, but the greatest film ever. There are no shoot-outs, explosions or car chases. This film is a simple reminder to those of us who are willing to take the time to see what Kurosawa is attempting to show us: That life is short. And that what we do with our lives matters. How many of us, like the protagonist Kanji Watanabe are alive, but have not lived life? Do we put off visting our loved ones? Are we just going through the motions of life? Or are we living a life of quality?And yes, our dear protagonist Mr. Watanabe does succeed in the end at making a contribution, no matter how small. And Takashi Shimura's character does succeed in giving some meaning to his short life and existence--his way of contributing, no matter how small, to those in his community. I first watched this film in 1977, and I never tire of viewing it again and again. There is not a scene in the film that I cannot recall. This is a heartfelt film, and Takashi Shimura [His greatest role] plays his part in the film with such outstanding humility, that we the viewer come to empathize with him. I have never forgotten the part where he sings, both in the drinking establishment, and at the end of the film; swinging in the now finished children's playground: So haunting, and yet so beautiful. This film puts what's really important in life into perspective. Life is too short, make the best of it. And more importantly, live your life as if each day were the last. There are not enough stars to give this great classic.

345607,A2BPDFR58H9575,6302919649,Galina,"[17, 17]","There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" (To Live), 1952 is one of them. The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny ""Ikiru"" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life; something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.Two years before he played the tough lead in ""Seven Samurai"", Takashi Shimara gave even finer performance in a very different role as a government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe who seemed to lead a life of quiet desperation at his job and at home. Then, he learns that he has terminal cancer and faced with the fact of death, he first tries to take from life as much as possible and spends the half of his savings on gambling, drinking and women. It leads him nowhere and gradually he determines to achieve one good thing before he dies, and settles on converting a junkyard into a playground for children. Rather than make a feel good movie with co-workers helping Kanji Watanabe in his quest and his family around him at his last moment, Kurosawa portrays him as a lonely crusader - no one can understand why this park is so important to him. The answer is very simple - he does not have time and he wants to live to see the park open. His family and co-workers don't even know how ill he is what makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant. His words, ""I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that""; the look at his face when asked by a mafia member if he did not care for his life - the film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.For me, watching ""Ikiru"" was as close to earth shattering experience as it goes. I think it is one of very few films that could really change one's life. I could not help comparing it to ""Cries and Whispers"" - how devastated I was by the theme of inevitable death, how ugly it is, and how helpless we all are while facing it. ""Ikiru"" is about a dying man, too but how hopeful and life affirming it is. The film did not tell or teach me something I had not known before but it confirmed once more that it is never too late to do something even if you have only few months to live.",5,"""I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that""",1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,2379,"['are', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'go', 'great', 'belong', 'league', 'own', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Ikiru', 'Live', '1952', 'one', 'film', 'rare', 'humanity', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'often', 'funny', 'Ikiru', 'story', 'dying', 'man', 'last', 'crusade', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'triumph', 'best', 'thing', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'life', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'film', 'reveals', 'absurdity', 'life', 'ability', 'man', 'find', 'meaning', 'selfless', 'action.Two', 'years', 'played', 'tough', 'lead', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Takashi', 'Shimara', 'gave', 'even', 'finer', 'performance', 'very', 'different', 'role', 'government', 'bureaucrat', 'Kanji', 'Watanabe', 'who', 'seemed', 'lead', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'job', 'home', 'Then', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'faced', 'fact', 'death', 'first', 'take', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'half', 'savings', 'gambling', 'drinking', 'women', 'nowhere', 'gradually', 'achieve', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'settles', 'converting', 'junkyard', 'playground', 'children', 'Rather', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'co-workers', 'helping', 'Kanji', 'Watanabe', 'quest', 'family', 'last', 'moment', 'Kurosawa', 'lonely', 'crusader', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'park', 'so', 'important', 'answer', 'very', 'simple', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'live', 'see', 'park', 'open', 'family', 'co-workers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'ill', 'what', 'scenes', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'words', 'am', 'not', 'angry', 'anyone', 'have', 'time', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'asked', 'mafia', 'member', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'life', 'film', 'many', 'quiet', 'compelling', 'moments', 'these.For', 'watching', 'Ikiru', 'was', 'close', 'earth', 'shattering', 'experience', 'think', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'could', 'really', 'change', 'one', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'comparing', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'how', 'devastated', 'was', 'theme', 'inevitable', 'death', 'how', 'ugly', 'how', 'helpless', 'are', 'facing', 'Ikiru', 'dying', 'man', 'too', 'how', 'hopeful', 'life', 'affirming', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'tell', 'teach', 'something', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'confirmed', 'once', 'more', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'do', 'something', 'even', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'live']",N/A

Kurosawa's retelling of Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich is beautiful on every level. No other filmmaker has or had the talent to frame every shot perfectly, while keeping his subject matter deeply human. Kurosawa knew humanity, its quirks, weaknesses, regrets, follies, and most importantly, the heights to which it can soar. Ikiru tells the story of a many who does what proves to be nearly impossible in the lives of most. Upon learning he is to die of stomach cancer, he changes his life. He learns to Live. But as with any tale of enlightenment, of those who gain an inner clarity about themselves, and who live their lives guided by that clarity, in truth and goodness, the majority do not understand. Boris Mouravieff call it the Law of Exception. Like drops jumping from the stream, only a few on the surface ever leave the inexorable pull of dictates of culture. The ones that remain cannot fathom those who have become free.

It may not be of the grandeur as say ""Ran"" or ""Seven Samurai"" with battle scenes and action but this is still a powerful film with subtle meaning behind it.Ikiru is the Japanese word for to live and that is something that the main character, Kenji Watanabe played by Takashi Shimura, has not done for the last thirty years of his life. Watanabe is a bureaucrat who holds the title of section chief of public affairs. His main job is pushing a papers after stamping them from one stack to another stack. He has done this for 30 years without missing a day of work and even though in reality he finds his work boring. He sacrificed his life to take care of his son but never became close to his son because of being wrapped up in his job. Watanabe ends up living a life of going through the motions.Then one day with a visit to the doctors office he finds that he is dying of stomach cancer and has no more then six months to live. Suddenly Watanabe is faced with his mortality and with a life that has no purpose or real meaning to it. He wants one chance to do something that has meaning to it and give him a purpose to live what time he has left. Of course he starts out looking for that meaning in the wrong places. He spends his days and nights going to nightclubs, drinking, dancing and meeting women but these don't bring meaning to his life just a temporary relief from thinking about his cancer. In the meantime words of his actions are getting back to his family who know nothing about his cancer or impending death. They think it is some kind of midlife crisis he is going through. It all comes to a head when one day he comes home with a young girl the family thinks Watanabe is having an affair with. In fact the young girl is a coworker of Watanabe who needs him to approve her resignation papers so she can leave. She ran into Watanabe on the street as he was walking home and invited her in while he signed her papers. Again the family knows nothing of this and it leads to a confrontation between Watanabe and his son. Still Watanabe says nothing of his condition as he continues to find a purpose for his life.Then that purpose comes to him. At the beginning of the film there is a scene about a group of mothers trying to get a cesspool cleaned up in their neighborhood and get a park for their children built in its place. You see bureaucracy at its best as they are sent from one department to the next trying to get someone to build a park for them only to be told they don't handle that and go to this department instead until they end up right back to where they started, at the public affairs department. Watanabe remembers these mothers and it strikes him what he can do to bring that purpose to his life.What takes place from that point is interesting in the art of story telling. We are suddenly informed by the narrator of the movie that Watanabe has died. From that point on we are told in a series of flashbacks what Watanabe had to do to finally get the park built. It is no spoiler alert to tell you that park does get built. As you watch the film you know it is going to happen. Once Watanabe finds his purpose in having that park built there is no doubt it WILL happen. But how it will happen is where the story lies. What Watanabe has to endure in fighting through all the red tape bureaucracy puts up along the way is what the film becomes about.All the way around this is an outstanding movie. Beautifully directed and filmed as well as co-written by Kurosawa this truly is one of the greatest movies ever made. This film is different then most of his other films in that they usually are period pieces dealing with ancient Japan. ""Ikiru"" on the other hand is a contemporary film, well at least it was when it was made back in 1952. But the thing with this story is it is timeless. ""Ikiru"" could have been made 60 years later then it was and it would still be relevant today. It is a film about how mankind lives their life as well as how they depart it and bring meaning to it. This is certainly a movie dealing with a heavy subject but is not depressing. There are moments here and there that are lighthearted and can bring a smile and maybe even a laugh. The main purpose to this film is to get the viewer to look at life. To understand that for all of us there will come a point where our life will end but that we should never stop living in spite of that and to try and find a purpose, no matter how great or small, to our lives to give it meaning.Of course while praising Kurosawa for his excellent work in making this film there is one other person who deserves praise as well for making this movie outstanding. There is no doubt that ""Ikiru"" is Takashi Shimura's masterpiece as an actor. His performance as Watanabe may well be the greatest performance any actor have ever given in cinema history. It is certainly a memorable one. Shimura takes on the roll of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. When he walks it is with his shoulders kind of hunched over almost as if he will collapse if he takes one more step. His facial expressions tell the story of a man with no life in him. In fact there are moments in ""Ikiru"" where Shimura can say more with a look then the spoken word. Shimura gives us a performance that makes you feel sympathy for Watanabe. You don't feel that at first. At first Watanabe is just another bureaucrat who pushes papers around with no expression. Once however he faces the news of his cancer the expressionless man fades away. He still keeps his feelings away from the rest of the world but once the viewer gets to see inside this man and the turmoil he is going through you develop that sympathy for him and find you care deeply for him and what will happen next. This is one powerful performance in a very subtle way.If you love action movies this might not be something you would want to watch. I love action movies as much as the next person but I love movies like ""Ikiru"" as much if not more. I love a good movie that makes you look inward. That challenges your thoughts and beliefs and shows the complexities of life. Movies like ""Ikiru"" show that the spoken word can provide more action then a dozen shoot 'em up explosive scenes from the best action movie could ever show. I would hope that anyone who thinks this might not be the movie for them would give ""Ikiru"" a try. You might be surprised just how much you will find yourself involved in watching an excellent film like this. Yes the pace of ""Ikiru"" is kind of slow. That is how Kurosawa made it so the viewer can take in everything that is going on in the story. Don't let that fact or the fact this is a foreign film with subtitles or the fact this is a black and white film or the fact there are no shoot 'em up scenes stop you from seeing ""Ikiru"". The message in this film is important for all to see.",5,To Live!,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,7497,"['truly', 'great', 'film', 'directors', 'have', 'one', 'film', 'made', 'career', 'considered',

345613,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6302919649,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","IKIRU has at its center the profound subject of the human condition approaching death, the invidual's fear of non-existence & the meaning of life. Intense subjects to be sure, but under Akira Kurosawa's masterful direction, the one man's experience of this most human of human conditions is simply told with dignity & a light touch. In many ways the plot of IKIRU parallels with that of one of my favorite Japanese film, CHERRY BLOSSOMS. An elderly man approaches the end of life, with little comfort to find in his past, particularly after his wife has died. A young woman befriends the man (in the story of CHERRY BLOSSOMS the girl is a Butoh dancer, in that of IKIRU she is a girl who works in the civil service off under the man.)On another level, IKIRU presents a scathing satire on the subject of bureaucracy & its stifling effects on creativity & the human spirit. The film opens with a group of women trying to get a cesspool filled in. They are sent from one city department to another in a vain campaign for someone to listen to them & take them seriously. Ikiru's planning division does the same, but it is at this junction department head Ikiru learns that he is dying of stomach cancer & has only a few months to live.In a sort of Dickenseque turn, Ikiru is taken in hand by an artist who takes him on an unrewarding tour of Tokyo's nightlife of jazz, swing & American trappings. The next day Ikiru misses work(for the first time) & nobody can figure out what's going on with him. That same day he connects with his rather zany office girl who informs him that she's quit out of boredom.The girl takes him on another excursion & Ikiru spends a small fortune on her and the night's entertainment. This causes a rift with his son who thinks the worst (i.e. that a scheming woman is going to deplete father's savings). This is another direct parallel with CHERRY BLOSSOMS.The relationship between the girl & Ikiru is complex and begins to unwind & deteriorate (unlike CHERRY BLOSSOMS.) They go separate ways. Nonetheless a spiritual process has been quietly ignited in him. His new quest in life mirrors back to the beginning of the movie with the women agitating to have the cess pool filled in. Ikiru takes it even further & becomes an unpretentious 1 man action committee.The remaining half hour follows his journey in this new sphere--and even beyond. There is a priceless scene at his wake, where his co-workers, superiors & inferiors have assembled for a parting comedic shot at bureaucracy. It's perfect.As is the entire film.Cherry BlossomsThe Hidden Fortress - Criterion CollectionKagemusha: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]Rashomon - Criterion Collection",5,A Great Story of Dignity Simply Told,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,2676,"['IKIRU', 'center', 'profound', 'subject', 'human', 'condition', 'approaching', 'death', 'invidual', 'fear', 'non-existence', 'meaning', 'life', 'Intense', 'subjects', 'be', 'sure', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'masterful', 'direction', 'one', 'man', 'experience', 'most', 'human', 'human', 'conditions', 'simply', 'told', 'dignity', 'light', 'touch', 'many', 'ways', 'plot', 'IKIRU', 'parallels', 'one', 'favorite', 'Japanese', 'film', 'CHERRY', 'BLOSSOMS', 'elderly', 'man', 'end', 'life', 'little', 'comfort', 'find', 'past', 'particularly', 'wife', 'died', 'young', 'woman', 'man', 'story', 'CHERRY', 'BLOSSOMS', 'girl', 'Butoh', 'dancer', 'IKIRU', 'girl', 'who', 'civil', 'service', 'man', 'level', 'IKIRU', 'scathing', 'satire', 'subject', 'bureaucracy', 'stifling', 'effects', 'creativity', 'human', 'spirit', 'film', 'group', 'women', 'trying', 'get', 'cesspool', 'filled', 'are', 'sent', 'one', 'city', 'department', 'vain', 'campaign', 'someone', 'listen', 'take', 'seriously', 'Ikiru', 'planning', 'division', 'same', 'junction', 'department', 'head', 'Ikiru', 'dying', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'live.In', 'sort', 'Dickenseque', 'turn', 'Ikiru', 'taken', 'hand', 'artist', 'who', 'unrewarding', 'tour', 'Tokyo', 'nightlife', 'jazz', 'swing', 'American', 'trappings', 'next', 'day', 'Ikiru', 'work', 'first', 'time', 'nobody', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'same', 'day', 'rather', 'zany', 'office', 'girl', 'who', 'quit', 'boredom.The', 'girl', 'excursion', 'Ikiru', 'small', 'fortune', 'night', 'entertainment', 'rift', 'son', 'who', 'worst', 'i.e', 'scheming', 'woman', 'going', 'deplete', 'father', 'savings', 'direct', 'parallel', 'CHERRY', 'BLOSSOMS.The', 'relationship', 'girl', 'Ikiru', 'complex', 'unwind', 'deteriorate', 'CHERRY', 'BLOSSOMS', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'spiritual', 'process', 'been', 'quietly', 'ignited', 'new', 'quest', 'life', 'mirrors', 'back', 'beginning', 'movie', 'women', 'agitating', 'have', 'cess', 'pool', 'filled', 'Ikiru', 'even', 'further', 'unpretentious', '1', 'man', 'action', 'remaining', 'half', 'hour', 'journey', 'new', 'sphere', 'even', 'priceless', 'scene', 'wake', 'where', 'co-workers', 'superiors', 'inferiors', 'have', 'assembled', 'parting', 'comedic', 'shot', 'bureaucracy', 'perfect.As', 'entire', 'film.Cherry', 'BlossomsThe', 'Hidden', 'Fortress', 'Criterion', 'CollectionKagemusha', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Rashomon', 'Criterion', 'Collection']",N/A

Last year's ""Sekai no Chushin de, Ai o Sakebu"" (Crying Out Love, At the Center of the World) - the pitch: high-school sweetheart dies of leukemia, very slowly indeed - was a monster domestic hit, while the more recent, no less weepy ""Ima, Ai ni Yukimasu"" looks set to pull a similar trick. Neither film could be faulted for emotional punch - however manipulative - but the nagging doubt remained: why bother, when you've got ""Ikiru""? Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece (and, yes, there's a bulging lexicon to choose out of there, but nevermind) may be showing its age - dodgy print quality, iffy sound, etc. - but its potency remains undiminished. Put simply: in a just world, this would trump ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the Christmas TV slot every year.When a humble bureaucrat, nearing the end of his career, discovers that he has terminal cancer, he sets out to achieve something meaningful with what remains of his life. In any other film, that would probably mean finding a cure for AIDS or saving the local orphanage, but Kurosawa is far too subtle for that. His hero is a man of humble means and, accordingly, his final, lasting testament is far from awe-inspiring. The thing is, though, it still counts for something.Kurosawa's films positively resonate with humanity: even his most iconic samurai pictures never shied away from exposing us for the inconsistent, foible-ridden creatures we are. ""Ikiru"" is a far more small-scale affair than, say, ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Rashomon"", but in the end that's a strength rather than a weakness.

I've seen it over twenty times--since way back before DVD even existed--even though the movie is from way beck before I existed.It's full of common heros and common villans.  You will find yourself somewhere amongst the characters, feeling and thinking as they feel, and perhaps being reformed by what happens in the movie--which I wont give you even a hint about because that's one of the chief reasons I do not read movie reviews.Besides, if I told you the basic story line, you might think it sounds boring and not watch it; whereas if you do watch it, I am sure you will be deeply touched and perhaps overhaul at least some aspect of the way you ""Live"" as a result--which happens to be the meaning of the title ""Ikiru.""Note that I recommend you go with subtitles instead of voice over if you don't understand Japanese--as I didn't when I first saw this film, but have become fluent in since.

Usually I'm bouncing off the walls and watching a crazy action flick. I can certainly understand that this might not be a movie for everyone because it can be a little slow and quiet. So if slow and quiet isn't your style then you may not want to pick this up. This being a Kurosawa film it will definitely draw some attention and trust me it is worthy of his direction. Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a middle-aged man who has been living a dull meaningless life. He has worked the same job for years and has to come home to a son who just seems to be waiting for him to die. Kanji finds out that he has stomach cancer and is told that he has less than a year to live.This strikes something in his mind, that he needs to start living instead doing the same things everyday. Because of this disease Kanji tries to live life as if he were young and full of life. He even tries to drink his sorrows away while explaining his newfound sickness. Kanji meets a young girl who he admires because of her youth and joy. Because of her she inspires him to do something big before he dies. He sets his sights on building the community and fixes up old broken down playgrounds among other things. He does what he can and lives right down to his very last minute.Ikiru has good quality coming from all elements of a good film not just one thing. Even the old black and white picture adds some emotion to the film.  The story itself is timeless and is one that may appear to many people in their life. I think what really gives this film that extra something is the acting from Takashi Shimura who made this character very realistic. He had a look on his face for the entire film that showed pain and his age and fear of his future. His face looked as if death was sitting right next to him waiting for him to fold up and stop living before he even died. There was never a time where you forgot that he was this character. As I said earlier the films black and white picture added a lot to the films feeling it wanted to give you and when you watch it you'll understand.

345624,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,6302919649,Kenji Fujishima,"[17, 21]","I don't profess to be an expert on the films of acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, but I will say that, though I haven't seen a great many of his films, I've definitely admired the ones I have seen. Films like RASHOMON, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, and THRONE OF BLOOD show a director that not only has an acute visual sense---I have never seen equalled the unforgettable images of the moving trees and then Toshiro Mifune with all the arrows launched at him at the end of THRONE OF BLOOD---but also a human sensitivity that may be more flamboyant and theatrical in style than his Japanese counterpart Yasujiro Ozu, but is no less impressive. He is a true film artist, to be sure...but, though IKIRU is often called one of Kurosawa's most human film achievements, I personally would not quite put it in the same level as those aforementioned three.Not that it's not moving. The first half of the film actually made me shed quite a few tears, watching poor Kanji Watanabe first find out he has stomach cancer, and then try to actually have some fun with his life. His attempts to do so are quite touching, even though it does not always work out---esp. with the girl that eventually gets annoyed with him b/c he insists on hanging out with her so much. Finally, he decides to do something noble for the people he works for, and thus we get to the second half of the film: Mr. Watanabe's wake, in which colleagues reminisce about the noble act he accomplished for a town before he died. His act---he steps over bureaucratic lines and gets built a children's park in an area where there was only a dirty pool of water previously---slowly inspires the others to perhaps break out of their bureaucratic mold...and perhaps will inspire you too, in a different way.I dunno, though...I was inspired but only sometimes moved by this film. For me, I think Kurosawa's penchant for lack of subtlety and heavy-handed sentimentality sometimes mutes its power. Kurosawa, for example, is not content to simply allow us to visually observe how lifeless our hero truly is at the beginning: no, he must give us a voiceover that drums it into our head that &quot;this man has not truly lived.&quot; And then there is the scene in the bar in the middle of the film, in which Watanabe sings, with tears coming out of his eyes, a mushy song that expresses his feelings of hopelessness and despair. If nothing else, though, the second half of the film seems to expose this unfortunate tendency---a very long scene, intercut with flashbacks, set in Watanabe's wake in which his fellow workers first try to deny Watanabe's deep heroism, but then eventually resolve to be as noble as he was in his last months of life. It is certainly intriguing structurally, as we see the effects of his death on fellow workers and the townspeople Watanabe helped so greatly. And yet I think, could this scene not have been just as effective as simply an epilogue rather than the focus of the entire second part of the film? I'm sure Kurosawa could have made his point---he is showing how one man's heroism can deeply affect other people---without becoming as repetitious and even preachy as this portion of the film sometimes seemed.And yet, if IKIRU is a flawed film, at least its flaws always spring from an honest desire to lift up his audience in a way that SEVEN SAMURAI and THRONE OF BLOOD do not even try to do. It may be sentimental, but it is always honestly felt, and perhaps you might be much less resistant to Kurosawa's sentimental excesses than I occasionally was. As Watanabe, Takashi Shimura gives an unforgettable performance (esp. with that hauntingly raspy voice of his); and Kurosawa does create a final moving image of Watanabe swinging on the swing in the new park, singing that same song he sang at the bar, but in a different, perhaps more joyful manner.That image just goes to show you that Kurosawa was, above all else, a masterly visual artist in his films. If he had relied more on his sense of powerful imagery to make his point, IKIRU might have been a truly great film, instead of one that perhaps tries too hard to be deeply moving. And yet I would be lying if I said that I wasn't affected by the film. Perhaps some of you might not mind the occasional preachiness in this film and will find this a truly transcendant film experience. For me, it almost got there, but not quite. Still, IKIRU is a good film that deserves to be seen for its powerful message, if nothing else. Maybe it will really change your life.

It suceeds on so many levels. A truly moving film that doesn't go for cheap sentiment, but instead touches the soul. Every action, camera move, and edit is brilliantly utilized make the film like a virtual text book in the power of filmmaking. The birthday party, Watanabe's song, the look of the office, the night of pleasure, the wake, the swing, and Shimura's eyes all linger long after seeing the film. Cinema at its finest.Image: (1:33:1) I first saw Ikiru on a blurry video cassette, the DVD is a lot better, but unfortunately its is still in poor condition. Throughout most of the night scenes there is a distracting light flicker on the edge of the frame that penatrates the black. It covers a wide area and is hard to dismiss. There are also many cases of a severe vertical line that cuts through the middle of the frame for several minutes at a time. Some key scenes have this across Shimura's face. Criterion probably did their best, afterall they achieved beautiful sharpness and good contrast with their transfer. According to Donald Richie's Kurosawa book, the original negative of the film has been destroyed so we probably can't hope for a better print.Extras: The audio commentary by Prince is one of the best scholarly commentaries around. It is one of the few talks that has truly increased my appreciation for a film by a large degree. His commentary points out elements of Kurosawa's art and skill that are so subtle that even multiple viewings would miss. A must listen to commentary for anyone interested in film criticism and technique. The second disc has a rather dull documentary on the film even though it has recent interviews with contributors to the film. Kurosawa himself isn't really asked about the picture. The longer documentary provides some rare footage of Kurosawa on the set directing his later day films and some interviews with him. The footage is great to see, although this probably would make more sense with the Rhapsody in August DVD since the clips are from it. Unfortuanately the documentary is poorly made, although it has some good biographical stuff, and the narrator is really annoying. It doesn't provide much insight into Kurosawa's process although it tries.",4,DVD Review,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,2371,"['Minus', 'one', 'star', 'poor', 'condition', 'print', 'Ikiru', 'argueably', 'Kurosawa', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'one', 'true', 'classics', 'cinema', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'truly', 'moving', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'cheap', 'sentiment', 'instead', 'soul', 'action', 'camera', 'move', 'edit', 'brilliantly', 'utilized', 'make', 'film', 'virtual', 'text', 'book', 'power', 'filmmaking', 'birthday', 'party', 'Watanabe', 'song', 'look', 'office', 'night', 'pleasure', 'wake', 'swing', 'Shimura', 'eyes', 'linger', 'long', 'seeing', 'film', 'Cinema', 'finest.Image', '1:33:1', 'first', 'saw', 'Ikiru', 'blurry', 'video', 'cassette', 'DVD', 'lot', 'better', 'unfortunately', 'still', 'poor', 'condition', 'most', 'night', 'scenes', 'distracting', 'light', 'flicker', 'edge', 'frame', 'black', 'wide', 'area', 'hard', 'dismiss', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'cases', 'severe', 'vertical', 'line', 'middle', 'frame', 'several', 'minutes', 'time', 'key', 'scenes', 'have', 'Shimura', 'face', 'Criterion', 'probably', 'did', 'best', 'afterall', 'achieved', 'beautiful', 'sharpness', 'good', 'contrast', 'transfer', 'According', 'Donald', 'Richie', 'Kurosawa', 'book', 'original', 'negative', 'film', 'been', 'destroyed', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hope', 'better', 'print.Extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Prince', 'one', 'best', 'scholarly', 'commentaries', 'one', 'few', 'talks', 'truly', 'increased', 'appreciation', 'film', 'large', 'degree', 'commentary', 'points', 'out', 'elements', 'Kurosawa', 'art', 'skill', 'are', 'so', 'subtle', 'even', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'would', 'miss', 'must', 'listen', 'commentary', 'anyone', 'interested', 'film', 'criticism', 'technique', 'second', 'disc', 'rather', 'dull', 'documentary', 'film', 'even', 'recent', 'interviews', 'contributors', 'film', 'Kurosawa', ""n't"", 'really', 'asked', 'picture', 'longer', 'documentary', 'rare', 'footage', 'Kurosawa', 'set', 'directing', 'later', 'day', 'films', 'interviews', 'footage', 'great', 'see', 'probably', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'Rhapsody', 'August', 'DVD', 'clips', 'are', 'Unfortuanately', 'documentary', 'poorly', 'made', 'good', 'biographical', 'stuff', 'narrator', 'really', 'annoying', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'insight', 'Kurosawa', 'process']",N/A
345628,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,6302919649,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[2, 23]","This is an admirable movie with a useful lesson, that we should use our lives constructively to make this world better in whatever way we can.We are taken to a comic book world, a surreal world, where the city officials do absolutely nothing.  All they ever do is refer complaints to other departments.  Obviously, we are sometimes given the runaround in life, but the world we are shown here is an exaggeration, the Bizarro World.Some women would like to change an area of filth in their neighborhood into a park.  They get the runaround, to a dozen different departments.  Finally they get lucky and run into our hero, who runs the public affairs department.  Since he is dying of stomach cancer, he'd like to do something with his life and he's not afraid of standing up to the people in his Bizarro World who insist that nothing at all be done.In the end, guess what, the park gets built, thanks to our dying hero.  And the politicians and bigwigs all horn in on the credit, despite the fact that they were the naysayers.One of the lessons for us is to hate all politicians.  Thank you.  I didn't need to be told that.  I already do hate all politicians and big shots.  Thank you very much.  I already do consider all big shots in this world to be selfish scum.My main problem with this movie, and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5, is because it tastes like cod liver oil.  It is medicine.  It is not very enjoyable.  We just keep getting hammered either by our hero's suffering or by the evil of those in his Bizarro World.I worked in the management office of a housing project for about 6 years, long ago.  That's the kind of civil service job being ridiculed here, I suppose.  We did things.  We got people's windows fixed.  We got people's apartments heated.  The place I worked in was not like the caricature pictured in this movie.  I doubt if any place is.  It's just a convenient target.If Japan is really like the way it is portrayed in this movie, then there's no reason for it to be here.  It is a waste of space.  Obviously that is not the case, and what we are seeing in this movie is a comic book caricature of reality.But still, the lesson is well taken.  Do something with your life.  Live it as if you will die soon.  One day the jig will be up, and you will be back home in Heaven.  Hopefully.  So do something while you are here.I like the way the movie ends.  It is an artistic touch that I appreciate.  Our hero is seen looking down on the park that he caused to be built, and he sees lots of children playing in it.  That's fun to watch.  Then a mother calls her kids, demanding that they come home for dinner.  There's nothing sentimental about it, just hey kids - get over here!, basically.  It was a very nice way of getting the message across that the park is a beautiful thing for the neighborhood, without getting mushy about it.It was one of those early 1950s parks that had an area to climb on, and hard concrete under the climbing area, so if you fall you really break your head.  Very kid-friendly, no?  Really makes you want to get up there and start climbing.  Just like the park near my house when I was a kid.  I was never very interested in climbing fences, ya know?  It just seemed like a pretty risky thing to do.  It was a lot safer to jump down staircases.My favorite part of this movie is watching the young girl who works in our hero's department.  She's full of fun and energy, which this movie badly needs, like a desert needs a soft drink machine.Another thing I like about the movie is that our hero's son is a real piece of garbage.  Sometimes our sons do turn out to be selfish garbage.  It's nice to see that recognized in an intelligent movie like this one.",3,Medicine with a message,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,3721,"['admirable', 'movie', 'useful', 'lesson', 'should', 'use', 'lives', 'constructively', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'way', 'can.We', 'are', 'taken', 'comic', 'book', 'world', 'surreal', 'world', 'where', 'city', 'officials', 'do', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'ever', 'do', 'refer', 'complaints', 'other', 'departments', 'Obviously', 'are', 'sometimes', 'given', 'runaround', 'life', 'world', 'are', 'shown', 'here', 'exaggeration', 'Bizarro', 'World.Some', 'women', 'would', 'like', 'change', 'area', 'filth', 'neighborhood', 'park', 'get', 'runaround', 'dozen', 'different', 'departments', 'Finally', 'get', 'lucky', 'run', 'hero', 'who', 'public', 'affairs', 'department', 'dying', 'stomach', 'cancer', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'something', 'life', 'not', 'afraid', 'standing', 'up', 'people', 'Bizarro', 'World', 'who', 'insist', 'nothing', 'be', 'done.In', 'end', 'guess', 'what', 'park', 'built', 'thanks', 'dying', 'hero', 'politicians', 'bigwigs', 'horn', 'credit', 'fact', 'were', 'naysayers.One', 'lessons', 'hate', 'politicians', 'Thank', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'told', 'already', 'do', 'hate', 'politicians', 'big', 'shots', 'Thank', 'very', 'much', 'already', 'do', 'consider', 'big', 'shots', 'world', 'be', 'selfish', 'scum.My', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'reason', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'cod', 'liver', 'oil', 'medicine', 'not', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'hammered', 'hero', 'suffering', 'evil', 'Bizarro', 'World.I', 'worked', 'management', 'office', 'housing', 'project', '6', 'years', 'long', 'ago', 'kind', 'civil', 'service', 'job', 'being', 'ridiculed', 'here', 'suppose', 'did', 'things', 'got', 'people', 'windows', 'fixed', 'got', 'people', 'apartments', 'heated', 'place', 'worked', 'was', 'not', 'caricature', 'pictured', 'movie', 'doubt', 'place', 'just', 'convenient', 'target.If', 'Japan', 'really', 'way', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'then', 'reason', 'be', 'here', 'waste', 'space', 'Obviously', 'not', 'case', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'caricature', 'reality.But', 'still', 'lesson', 'well', 'taken', 'Do', 'something', 'life', 'Live', 'will', 'die', 'soon', 'One', 'day', 'jig', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'home', 'Heaven', 'Hopefully', 'So', 'do', 'something', 'are', 'here.I', 'way', 'movie', 'artistic', 'touch', 'appreciate', 'hero', 'seen', 'looking', 'down', 'park', 'caused', 'be', 'built', 'lots', 'children', 'playing', 'fun', 'watch', 'Then', 'mother', 'kids', 'demanding', 'come', 'home', 'dinner', 'nothing', 'sentimental', 'just', 'hey', 'kids', 'get', 'here', 'basically', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'way', 'getting', 'message', 'park', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'neighborhood', 'getting', 'mushy', 'it.It', 'was', 'one', 'early', '1950s', 'parks', 'had', 'area', 'climb', 'hard', 'concrete', 'climbing', 'area', 'so', 'fall', 'really', 'break', 'head', 'Very', 'kid-friendly', 'Really', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'there', 'start', 'climbing', 'Just', 'park', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'interested', 'climbing', 'fences', 'ya', 'know', 'just', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'risky', 'thing', 'do', 'was', 'lot', 'safer', 'jump', 'down', 'staircases.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'watching', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'hero', 'department', 'full', 'fun', 'energy', 'movie', 'badly', 'desert', 'soft', 'drink', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'hero', 'son', 'real', 'piece', 'garbage', 'Sometimes', 'sons', 'do', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'selfish', 'garbage', 'nice', 'see', 'recognized', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'one']",N/A

His department is the department of &quot;pass the buck&quot;, which would be bad enough, but all of his neighboring departments are also the department of pass the buck.When a group of mothers from a local neighborhood arrive to complain that sewage is backing up and causing sickness they are shuffled from one department to another, each one claiming that responsibility rests in some OTHER department.Our hero, played by Mr. Takashi Shimura, discovers at the same time that he has stomach cancer, and not long to live.  At first he feels pitifully sorry for himself, then begins to reflect that his life has been a slight one, scarcely casting a shadow upon his surrounding world.  A chance encounter with one of the young ladies from his department results in a friendship being struck up - he is attracted to her youthful vigor and enthusiasm, and she is intrigued that the older gentleman she has privately nicknamed &quot;The Mummy&quot; is actually a kind fellow.She begins to think it a little creepy that this older gent is showing so much interest in her - and as he feels his mortality approaching he is becoming more and more desperate to find human bonds.  We have been led to this point to have sympathy for the old dying bureaucrat, and it would have been very easy at that point to turn the story into something pitiful or maudlin.  Instead the story takes an absolutely sublimely inspired turn. Mr. Watanabe decides to actually &quot;do something&quot; and he applies himself totally to the problem of the neighborhood with the backed-up sewage.  He is a bureaucrat, not a politician, and as he's dying of cancer he finds himself fighting not only the various departments of pass-the-buck, but politician's personified by the Deputy Mayor, along with local mobsters.It is an absolutely uplifting experience to see both the path and result of Watanabe's struggles.This film is justifiably praised.

His son, his presumed reason for working the same boring job for the last thirty years, has married and, although still living with the father, has drawn away from him, such that conversation is minimal and awkward, to the extent that Kanji is unable to tell him about his terminal cancer. For the most part, Kanji's work as the chief at city hall fills his life, but does nothing to fulfill it-- the work itself is meaninglessly mired in bureaucracy such that nothing ever really gets done, and certainly nothing of significance. In fact, the work has killed his sense of determination and initiative; it's boring.So what does Kanji do? He skips work and tries to find meaning for his life, first in alcohol and all the partying that goes with it, and then in the company of a young lady who after one and half years at city hall is resigning her position because it's ""boring."" She represents perhaps the attitude he should have embraced at an earlier age. But neither the alcohol nor his attraction to this youthful spirit are able to replace the void of despair and regret inside him, residing along with the cancer. He wants desperately ""to live,"" but doesn't know how.Ikiru should rank as one of the most important films that examines the human life. Director Akira Kurosawa blends so many moments in this film that have remained with me, including the reflective scene in the bar where Kanji and a young writer (a young Kurosawa?) quietly talk to each other in close-up, the writer acknowledging the elder's plight, finding meaning in his despair: ""Man finds truth in misfortune.""Takashi Shimura (also in Kurosawa's Rashomon and The Seven Samurai) gives an incredible performance. It's not easy to convey regret through facial expression, but he does it so believably that you become overwhelmed by his pain.  The scene toward the end with him on the swing is one of those moments from the movies that you never forget.Don't rent this film, buy it. Keep it and watch it at least once a year. Maybe it won't make a difference, maybe it won't cause you or me to adopt Kanji's it's-never-too-late, deferential and fanatical perseverance in pushing through something of significance to better humanity, but at least it will keep reminding us to.",5,Powerful examination of life,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,2353,"['only', 'year', 'live', 'Kanji', 'Watanabe', 'life', 'discover', 'been', 'waste', 'time', 'son', 'presumed', 'reason', 'working', 'same', 'boring', 'job', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'married', 'still', 'living', 'father', 'drawn', 'away', 'such', 'conversation', 'minimal', 'awkward', 'extent', 'Kanji', 'unable', 'tell', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'most', 'part', 'Kanji', 'work', 'chief', 'city', 'hall', 'life', 'nothing', 'fulfill', 'work', 'meaninglessly', 'mired', 'bureaucracy', 'such', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'done', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'significance', 'fact', 'work', 'killed', 'sense', 'determination', 'initiative', 'boring.So', 'what', 'Kanji', 'do', 'work', 'tries', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'first', 'alcohol', 'partying', 'then', 'company', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'one', 'half', 'years', 'city', 'hall', 'resigning', 'position', 'boring', 'perhaps', 'attitude', 'should', 'have', 'embraced', 'earlier', 'age', 'alcohol', 'attraction', 'youthful', 'spirit', 'are', 'able', 'replace', 'void', 'despair', 'regret', 'residing', 'along', 'cancer', 'desperately', 'live', ""n't"", 'know', 'how.Ikiru', 'should', 'rank', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'examines', 'human', 'life', 'Director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'film', 'have', 'remained', 'including', 'reflective', 'scene', 'bar', 'where', 'Kanji', 'young', 'writer', 'young', 'Kurosawa', 'quietly', 'talk', 'other', 'close-up', 'writer', 'acknowledging', 'elder', 'plight', 'finding', 'meaning', 'despair', 'Man', 'truth', 'misfortune', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'also', 'Kurosawa', 'Rashomon', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'incredible', 'performance', 'not', 'easy', 'convey', 'regret', 'facial', 'expression', 'so', 'believably', 'become', 'overwhelmed', 'pain', 'scene', 'end', 'swing', 'one', 'moments', 'movies', 'never', 'forget.Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'film', 'buy', 'Keep', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cause', 'adopt', 'Kanji', ""it's-never-too-late"", 'deferential', 'fanatical', 'perseverance', 'pushing', 'something', 'significance', 'better', 'humanity', 'least', 'will', 'keep', 'reminding']",N/A

It however has an interesting narrative structure, very keenly observed nuance and boldness that combine to give it an originality that elevates it into a rewarding movie for it's great novelty value in presenting such a story into a film.The main character, is a department head of a council who finds out he is going to die from cancer and suffers an existential crisis. He doesn't really have a personality is what has become of him & this issue now suddenly has dawned on him, he tries in different ways to find one but he can't really do it and is abit like a worm - very strange main protagonist! The only personality he really has is as the department head, & when he realizes this, he puts all his effort into achieving one act of public service out of the city council which is riddled by a hierarchical claustrophobic bureaucracy all the way up to its top which even includes a type of mafia.This is ultimately an uplifting film although very unsentimental in some of the juxtapositions of it's wide cast of characters, & it has a tightly knit well played narrative of social commentaries. It is a film which is interesting in being an expression of view overall as much as anything else, and is a natural companion piece to Kurosawa's later film Red Beard in this regard as to being a philosophical position held i think.This is for the two disc dvd special edition which has two worthwhile documentaries covering the the film & the singular Kurosawa.",5,A Keenly Observed Tale of the Pitfalls Involving Bureaucracy as Democracy,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1608,"['rather', 'slow', 'moving', 'ways', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'bordering', 'polemic', 'take', 'post', 'WW2', 'democracy', 'Japan', 'told', 'city', 'council', 'level', 'however', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'structure', 'very', 'keenly', 'observed', 'nuance', 'boldness', 'combine', 'give', 'originality', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'great', 'novelty', 'value', 'presenting', 'such', 'story', 'film.The', 'main', 'character', 'department', 'head', 'council', 'who', 'out', 'going', 'die', 'cancer', 'suffers', 'existential', 'crisis', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'personality', 'what', 'become', 'issue', 'now', 'suddenly', 'dawned', 'different', 'ways', 'find', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'abit', 'worm', 'very', 'strange', 'main', 'protagonist', 'only', 'personality', 'really', 'department', 'head', 'when', 'effort', 'achieving', 'one', 'act', 'public', 'service', 'city', 'council', 'riddled', 'hierarchical', 'claustrophobic', 'bureaucracy', 'way', 'up', 'top', 'even', 'type', 'mafia.This', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'film', 'very', 'unsentimental', 'juxtapositions', 'wide', 'cast', 'characters', 'tightly', 'knit', 'well', 'played', 'narrative', 'social', 'commentaries', 'film', 'interesting', 'being', 'expression', 'view', 'overall', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'natural', 'companion', 'piece', 'Kurosawa', 'later', 'film', 'Red', 'Beard', 'regard', 'being', 'philosophical', 'position', 'held', 'i', 'think.This', 'two', 'disc', 'dvd', 'special', 'edition', 'two', 'worthwhile', 'documentaries', 'covering', 'film', 'singular', 'Kurosawa']",N/A

345637,A237RLQXTL55RG,6302919649,off the tropic,"[1, 1]","Ikiru is Kurasawa's masterpiece. Kurasawa's evocation of an ordinary man's meditation on life at its fullest precisely when he is facing death has never dimmed even after repeated viewings.Ikiru's quiet emotional impact reminds me of the thematic overtones of Ozu's Tokyo Story borne out of that unifying moral center of ordinary people coming together with extraordinary resolve after the death of an endearing character. Ikiru is a brooding tragedy that ultimately finds a way to allay the anxiety of confronting death with some measure of calm. Death has a starring role in this movie unlike Yasujuro Ozu's remarkable Tokyo Story where death is in the background, hidden through much of the story only to surface in the end in a much more indirect way with all its menacing force. Death is lying in the shadows,  only to surface as a sudden, unanticipated, brutal, event without warning, to create the human effect,  similar to the final masterful Kurosawa scene in Ikiru.In Ikiru death descends slowly, mercilessly, on Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) who, as a man consumed by routine and pinched down by the reams of paperwork in his work life as a petty bureaucrat, is ""dead"" to the world. When Watanabe learns of his diagnosis he awakens to life. He begins ""to live"" knowing suddenly that he has not lived at all. This good bureaucrat's life, once a source for all that is pleasant, sure, measured, controlled, and tranquil in that dead calm way, is suddenly called into question and quietly shunned with an urgency. A dusty, inconsequential life is resurrected again.The Ikiru narrative becomes an existential quest for life, its meaning, in face of its imminent loss. The film is a record of a life that is awakened, and newly sensitized to other human beings. The solipsistic bent of Watanabe's life now takes on an outward embrace of people he has routinely neglected. This generous and benevolent awakening revives connections with people to create a powerful emotional effect of sympathy among the people he encounters along the way.The reconciliatory emotions that come with this awakening is one of empathy and admiration. Watanabe's generosity fills the screen with subtle acts of giving. He decides to take a colleague out to a restaurant something this bureaucrat would never have done before. Kurasawa has a way of lighting up this scene with delight as he records the sheer happiness that this simple move brings to the both of them. These simple gestures accumulate in the course of the narrative and record the redemption of Watanabe. The cumulative effect of living for people brings that lit up satisfaction to a person who is used to his withdrawn, glum ways.That unforgettable final scene on the swing, with Watanabe idly rocking, back and forth, in a city park, with a light snow settling on his hat, his coat, his face, brings out the tranquility of his last days. He wears an expression that is still, almost frozen in the anticipation of his fate. When the camera dollies into his face we can dimly perceive a strange spark in those eyes even if the overall appearance still wears the look of a man burdened by the weight of his imminent death. This last scene of the film is among the very great moments of cinema, a scene that evokes mixed emotions. Watanabe seems to come across as a person who has found a way to live in those final months leading up to his death, and yet there is that look in his eyes in that final scene that this is no tranquil end. He is not ready to go out into the good night, and to borrow more of Dylan Thomas's words, we see a spark in Mr. Watanabe's  quiet, calm eyes that belie a rage against the dying of the light.The film ends with this muted victory, or exultant failure, of Watanabe's life. The assembled friends of a man without a family fills the room of the funeral chamber and eulogies attempt to mark the life of a man who has lived well. The obscure and inconsequential life that was once Watanabe's lot is dispelled in the formal speeches but the dreary room also conveys the feeling that Watanabe's life is redeemed in part, and much too late.There is a sense that death has brought Watanabe down just when he begins to discover the desire to live to his fullest. The twilight of his life gets the upper-hand and pushes him down as he begins to pick himself up. Kurasawa's meditation on death is thus an anxious and brooding one that puts him in the company of his European contemporary, Bergman, that consummate tragedian.",5,Ikiru,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,4494,"['Ikiru', 'Kurasawa', 'masterpiece', 'Kurasawa', 'evocation', 'ordinary', 'man', 'meditation', 'life', 'fullest', 'precisely', 'when', 'facing', 'death', 'never', 'dimmed', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewings.Ikiru', 'quiet', 'emotional', 'impact', 'thematic', 'overtones', 'Ozu', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'unifying', 'moral', 'center', 'ordinary', 'people', 'coming', 'together', 'extraordinary', 'resolve', 'death', 'endearing', 'character', 'Ikiru', 'brooding', 'tragedy', 'ultimately', 'way', 'allay', 'anxiety', 'confronting', 'death', 'measure', 'calm', 'Death', 'starring', 'role', 'movie', 'Yasujuro', 'Ozu', 'remarkable', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'where', 'death', 'background', 'hidden', 'much', 'story', 'only', 'surface', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'indirect', 'way', 'menacing', 'force', 'Death', 'lying', 'shadows', 'only', 'surface', 'sudden', 'unanticipated', 'brutal', 'event', 'warning', 'create', 'human', 'effect', 'similar', 'final', 'masterful', 'Kurosawa', 'scene', 'Ikiru.In', 'Ikiru', 'death', 'descends', 'slowly', 'mercilessly', 'Watanabe', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'who', 'man', 'consumed', 'routine', 'pinched', 'down', 'reams', 'paperwork', 'work', 'life', 'petty', 'bureaucrat', 'dead', 'world', 'When', 'Watanabe', 'diagnosis', 'life', 'live', 'knowing', 'suddenly', 'not', 'lived', 'good', 'bureaucrat', 'life', 'once', 'source', 'pleasant', 'sure', 'measured', 'controlled', 'tranquil', 'dead', 'calm', 'way', 'suddenly', 'called', 'question', 'quietly', 'shunned', 'urgency', 'dusty', 'inconsequential', 'life', 'resurrected', 'again.The', 'Ikiru', 'narrative', 'becomes', 'existential', 'quest', 'life', 'meaning', 'face', 'imminent', 'loss', 'film', 'record', 'life', 'awakened', 'newly', 'sensitized', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'solipsistic', 'bent', 'Watanabe', 'life', 'now', 'outward', 'embrace', 'people', 'routinely', 'neglected', 'generous', 'benevolent', 'awakening', 'revives', 'connections', 'people', 'create', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'effect', 'sympathy', 'people', 'way.The', 'reconciliatory', 'emotions', 'come', 'awakening', 'one', 'empathy', 'admiration', 'Watanabe', 'generosity', 'screen', 'subtle', 'acts', 'giving', 'take', 'colleague', 'restaurant', 'something', 'bureaucrat', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'done', 'before', 'Kurasawa', 'way', 'lighting', 'up', 'scene', 'delight', 'sheer', 'happiness', 'simple', 'move', 'brings', 'simple', 'gestures', 'accumulate', 'course', 'narrative', 'record', 'redemption', 'Watanabe', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'living', 'people', 'brings', 'lit', 'up', 'satisfaction', 'person', 'who', 'used', 'withdrawn', 'glum', 'ways.That', 'unforgettable', 'final', 'scene', 'swing', 'Watanabe', 'idly', 'rocking', 'back', 'forth', 'city', 'park', 'light', 'snow', 'settling', 'hat', 'coat', 'face', 'out', 'tranquility', 'last', 'days', 'expression', 'still', 'almost', 'frozen', 'anticipation', 'fate', 'When', 'camera', 'face', 'can', 'dimly', 'perceive', 'strange', 'spark', 'eyes', 'even', 'overall', 'appearance', 'still', 'look', 'man', 'burdened', 'weight', 'imminent', 'death', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'very', 'great', 'moments', 'cinema', 'scene', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'Watanabe', 'come', 'person', 'who', 'found', 'way', 'live', 'final', 'months', 'leading', 'up', 'death', 'yet', 'look', 'eyes', 'final', 'scene', 'tranquil', 'end', 'not', 'ready', 'go', 'out', 'good', 'night', 'borrow', 'more', 'Dylan', 'Thomas', 'words', 'see', 'spark', 'Mr.', 'Watanabe', 'quiet', 'calm', 'eyes', 'belie', 'rage', 'dying', 'light.The', 'film', 'muted', 'victory', 'exultant', 'failure', 'Watanabe', 'life', 'assembled', 'friends', 'man', 'family', 'room', 'funeral', 'chamber', 'eulogies', 'attempt', 'mark', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'well', 'obscure', 'inconsequential', 'life', 'was', 'once', 'Watanabe', 'lot', 'dispelled', 'formal', 'speeches', 'dreary', 'room', 'also', 'feeling', 'Watanabe', 'life', 'redeemed', 'part', 'much', 'too', 'late.There', 'sense', 'death', 'brought', 'Watanabe', 'down', 'just', 'when', 'discover', 'desire', 'live', 'fullest', 'twilight', 'life', 'upper-hand', 'down', 'pick', 'up', 'Kurasawa', 'meditation', 'death', 'thus', 'anxious', 'brooding', 'one', 'company', 'European', 'contemporary', 'Bergman', 'consummate', 'tragedian']",N/A

Hardly a melodrama or weepie, this very moving, thoughtful film takes a highly unusal narrative turn about two-thirds of the way, and Kurosawa explores both critical and celebratory views of the hero, Watabanbe's successful efforts to get the park bult.  The last third of the fim is informed by an unsentimental realism that goes far beyond much of the darkest cynicism of Hollywood film noir. But the final shot, which recalls an earlier beautiful shot of the film, holds out some hope that things will change even while aknowledging that there is little reason to hope that one man's efforts will change anything much.

345640,A2K3UTNW0783U6,6302919649,Phillip Kay,"[36, 40]","Akira Kurosawa made Rashomon in 1950, Ikiru in 1952 and The Seven Samurai in 1954. All these films have quite a complex structure. Yet Ikiru remains a very simple film, which says nothing original:  it's not what is shown, but how, that is important, as in Flaubert's story  ""A Simple Heart"". It will be appreciated best by those who've realised they're going to die (you'll know what I mean). Watching Ozu's Tokyo Story beforehand will prepare you for the subtle style. In Ikiru five themes are interwoven:1. Learning to accept deathAt the start of the film Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) learns he has stomach cancer and has six months to live. He has retreated into his work after his wife's early death and become devoted to routine. The camera shows us several shots in closeup of Shimura's face after he speaks to his doctor, and we see the anguish in his eyes. It's not fear he shows: it's horror, horror of what his life has become. The shock of his wife's death has caused him to stop living. The shock of his own coming death makes him realise he must start to live: only then will he be ready to die. There is a contrast in the documentary style depiction of the hospital scenes and Watanabe's office compared with the closeups of Shimura, hunched up with horrified realisation or showing eyes that are black pools of despair. This is the hardest thing to do in any art form: this is simplicity, and the effect is overwhelming, the acting superb.2. Placing value in your lifeWatanabe has not much expertise in how to live. His son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko) and daughter-in-law Kazue (Kyoko Seki) share his home but not much else. Watanabe cannot speak to them about his cancer. Cast out on his own resources, Watanabe  tells a complete stranger (Yunosuke Ito) what he could not tell his son. He asks his burning question, how can I live? The two drunken men go and sample what they imagine is life: drinking shops, reviews, dance halls, strip clubs. This is desperate living, another way of dying. Watanabe brings the whole thing to a halt when he requests a pianist to play an old song, and sings the words, about young girls who fall in love and how they should enjoy that love for life is short. Perhaps it was a favourite of he and his wife when they first met. The melody is haunting, and is Watanabe's theme at several key points in the film.  Later Watanabe sees Toyo (Miki Odagiri) one of his office colleagues. Watanabe is exhilarated by her joyous love of life, her enthusiasm, even her appetite. Perhaps she will teach him how to live. She teaches him he cannot live by proxy. Watanabe finally discovers fulfillment in doing good for others by using his position at work. Kurosawa opens out the sets progressively. We see the small rooms of Watanabe's house, then the cafe and dance hall scenes at night, then the streets and shops by day, then finally offices, streets and slums as Watanabe moves between the company of government heads of departments, yakuza trying to extort money from them, fellow bureaucrats, workmen and slum dwellers in his quest to have a children's park built. Giving meaning to your life is within everyone's scope, no matter how narrow that scope may be, and enlarges it. There is a touch of the moralist here, but we are liable to forget it as we watch Shimura, small, fragile, bowed over with pain, absolutely determined to make others respond. And they do.3. The dangers of griefHow did Watanabe become the man he is? In his bedroom is a photo of a young, attractive woman, his wife. In a flashback sequence we see her funeral, learn she died unexpectedly when her son was only five or six years old. The beautiful has vanished. This is a theme with haunting overtones in Japanese culture. That power, greatness, beauty is transient can teach us how to live more deeply. But Watanabe has given the dead woman his love and now he cannot stop grieving.  In Watanabe's bedroom the photo is next to his citation for exemplary attendance at work. In the funeral car Watanabe watches as the hearse draws further away from him: it's a distance he has tried to deny ever since.4. The entropy inherent in large structuresWatanabe started his bureaucratic life with ambitions to reform. His idealistic report is mouldering away in a bottom drawer. But he's working in a place where the only activity is the filling out of reports, not the achieving of change. It's a kind of tomb. Here no one will accept responsibility; anything unusual, such  as the request of a group of neighborhood mothers that a swamp be filled and made into a playground, is frantically passed on to another department. This is not merely satire. The government, of the country as of the local region, is behaving as Watanabe, withdrawing from living and substituting empty formalism in its place. It is no accident Watanabe is head of a department.  If we want to we can ask, is it my problem too? The moralist is much more in evidence here.5. The political response  we have to others' actionsThat Watanabe is not the entire subject of the film is made clear as his death occurs halfway through it.  We see the Buddhist wake. The guests at the wake at first give lip service to Watanabe's virtues, then the politicians among them compete for the credit of building the park. The workers in Watanabe's department discuss who will be the next head.  The group of petitioners are admitted to pay their respects. They say nothing; but they are grateful. In Japan it matters how the dead are thought of. Kurosawa shows that all the survivors, even the grief stricken, are motivated by personal considerations. He shows this to be natural and inevitable, while satirising more extreme manifestations of it. The mourners cannot give meaning to their life by praising Watanabe though; they will need to strive as hard as Watanabe had: most of them won't. There is a social dimension of our actions, as of our inactions. Kurosawa wants viewers of his film to be at that wake too, and reflect on what Watanabe's life and death meant.Watanabe dies in his playground. He sits on a swing, and sings his song of young girls who fall in love. It is snowing. Watanabe is happy, not because of the playground, not because of the song. He has found something vital. What makes Ikiru an important film is that viewers who watch it can understand just what he has found.",5,A simple story,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,6367,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'made', 'Rashomon',

345642,AKI1CK229BDUC,6302919649,PsyRC,"[1, 1]","My introduction to this movie occurred at a particularly poignant moment in my own life, so I believe it resonated deeper than I could have foreseen.  It is a message that bridges the gap between despair and hope.  The main character Watanabe, upon finding out he will be dying of stomach cancer (in a vague, clearly paternalistic way as far as the medical system is concerned), puts his life into perspective and struggles with how to proceed during his final days.  This struggle is seen very viscerally during the night club scene, when everyone around him is dancing with reckless abandon, ""living their lives"", as it was, yet they do so without direct recognition of their own mortality.  When the idea of death comes piercing through the night in the guise of the melancholic tune Watanabe sings, dancing stops and what is translated is how difficult it really is to enjoy life when its end becomes transparent.He is led through the maze of self-transformation, through the auspices of ""a good Mephistopheles who seeks no reward,"" and the ever-empowering feminine presence, the Anima (in Jungian terms).  He desperately seeks to adopt the persona of those who are not sentenced to a more imminent demise, turn them into an eternity-conferring selfobject.  But, alas, it is not to be, but rather than admit defeat and wither into the grave as a defeated wretch to the whims of time, he builds upon the energy instilled in him, and in a poignant moment new consciousness is born as a group of adolescents sing ""happy birthday"" just as he is descending the staircase.  The transcendence of his passing manifests through the retelling of his final days during his wake, he has managed to cheat death in remaining in the hearts and memories of the ones he left behind.  His ultimate demise represents his knowledge of inevitable annihilation and rebirth, the never-ending cycle that besieges all living creatures; he, in essence, ""fuses"" with nature and allows himself to be reintegrated into it.  The meaning of life is truly that it goes on, and you can in effect conquer death by understanding what lies behind life.

Each movie shows a man faced with a crisis who is forced to evaluate the meaning of his life.  I suspect that most of us have seen &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; in which the hero, George Bailey, discovers that his life has been far more meaningful than he ever realized.  &quot;Ikiru&quot; shows us an opposite discovery for its' hero, Kanji Wantanabe, a widower.  He is a mid-level bureaucrat who discovers that he has a terminal disease.  As he contemplates the meaning of it all, he remembers a joke he heard at the office in which the value of his work is mocked.  Has his life amounted to anything?  In a poingnant series of flashbacks to his earlier life, we see a number of scenes that tell us of the two relationships in his life.  We sense the sudden loss of his wife but it is the marvelously created scenes of his fading relationship with his son that touches us the deepest.  I'm not sure I've seen many more touching scenes that the one at the train station when his son goes off to war.  Thus his life has failed at relationships and at his professional career.  What can he do with the time he has left?  The answer comes from a young lady who works at his office and is wonderfully played by an actress who, I'm sorry to say, was not identified (in English) on the cast and credits.  Wantanabe realizes that he still has time to do something with his life and goes about trying to do just that.I won't say anymore about the plot because the beauty of the movie is watching things come together.  As a matter of fact, the way the director moves about in time allows us to piece the puzzle together retrospectively.  The funeral is where we learn of the success and the different, often self-centered, perspectives add to the impact of the message.  The ending is a reminder to us all that we can choose whether or not we, too, want to make a difference.  However, just saying so doesn't count.The director, Akira Kurosawa, has created another masterpiece of the human spirit.  The acting is very well done.  Takashi Shimura seemed to me, at times, to be too detached from his role.  However, I came to realize that he was acting the role of a man who was too detached from life itself.This is a film worth seeing.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[15, 15]","Ikiru (To Live) is a chilling depiction of the film's ""hero"", Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a civil servant, who works in the city office as the Chief clerk.  After receiving a medical examination, he discovers that he has gastric cancer in spite of the fact that the doctor informs him that it's merely a mild ulcer.  Watanabe seeks guidance on how to spend his entire life savings.  He promotes a novelist (Yunesuke Ito) to take him on a bar and club excursion in order to escape from headiness on his that was weighing on his mind.  Only after befriending a former employee (Miki Odagiri) who makes toy bunnies for children, he soon decides that he has to do something meaningful for the remaining part of his life - to approve plans to build a city park.This film is gripping in that it relates to the somewhat disillusionment and hope that many Japanese experienced after World War II.  The main theme of the film deals with full disclosure or in simple terms, the truth.  This assessment may be seen within the film as Watanabe keeps his knowledge of his illness to himself as a way to preserve his life.  As he proceeds from day to day, the unbearable ness takes a toll.  IRIKURU shows that despite social and cultural differences, individuals deal with unpleasant situations in the same way.Director Akiru Kurosawa was one of the most legendary directors in Japanese film history, and the accompanying screenplay by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni is the most relevant aspect of the film.  The cinematography is impeccable and reveals the emotions and actions of the actors.  The film is dark and ironic at times - Watanabe's somewhat groaning chant of an old twenties ballad, ""Fall in love, dear maiden..."" is quiet haunting, but Kurosawa manages to allude to the viewer that a little bit of humor in the midst of death offers a sense of realism to the conscience.No doubt, the film is a great achievement and should be viewed by film buffs or anyone interested in humanistic films without being too sentimental.

I had heard that this was Kurosawa's best, and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down.Luckily, that didn't happen.The narrator of the film reminded me of Criswell's narrations to Plan 9 from Outer Space. The film seemed to say too much and show too little. Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work, something clicked. The long duration of the shot and the narrator's continued breakdown of the man's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives, that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds, and that we are powerless to silence it.That floored me, and for the rest of the film, I remained awe-stricken by this humble yet miserable man. Takashi Shimura gives one of the greatest performances I've seen since Raging Bull. Here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world, but he's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt. The horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time.There are points at which the film seems to drag on, but never without purpose. When he dies, having finally given meaning to his existence, his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity, confusion, and finally admiration.

I'm not sure why this is, because the film begs praise; it is a work of absolute brilliance in every respect, perhaps Kurosawa's (if not the Japanese film industry's) single finest moment. But how to explain why? All I can do, all any of us can do, is lay it out for you. It takes Akira Kurosawa to make it come alive.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the chief clerk in a department on Tokyo City Hall. He has worked there for thirty years, and accomplished nothing of note. As the film opens, we are told that he has gastric cancer, and will soon be dead. Soon enough, Watanabe himself finds this out (more through the idle banter of another old man in the waiting room than his duplicitous doctor), and realizes that there has to be more to life than this. The rest of the film chronicles Watanabe's search to figure out how to live, and his quest's effect on those around him.The film would not be what it is without Takashi Shimura, who takes Kurosawa's script and turns a paper Watanabe into an amazing character, a man struggling to throw off the boundaries imposed upon him by job, culture, and family. Shimura's performance alone would be enough to make this an above-average film, but everyone here turns in fine performances. Kurosawa, of course, was a master director, and he shows it off here; the movie is paced slowly enough to let us get to know Watanabe and those around him, but it never drags. (Pretty amazing for a two and a half hour film about an existential crisis.)I do find it amusing that a number of reviews I've read recently have commented on the film's ""feel-good factor."" While it's there, and there's no doubt about that, I'm wondering how such an interpretation of the film fits in with the subtle, but devastating, final scene of the film. (Obviously, I can't say what happens without giving away the whole thing, but trust me on this.)

345648,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302919649,Robert Moore,"[6, 6]","IKIRU is one of the most emotionally engaging and powerful films I have ever seen.  Easily the most popular non-Anglo-European film director, Akira Kurosawa's contemporary films have never achieved the popularity of his historical ones.  Perhaps the built-in fan base of martial arts aficionados, or those looking for the inspirations of such films as STAR WARS, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS has made movie viewers more aware of films like THE HIDDEN FORTRESS, SEVEN SAMURAI, and YOJIMBO.  Whatever the cause, Kurosawa's films set in the twentieth century have not received as much attention as these others, which is unfortunate because films like STRAY DOG, HIGH AND LOW, and DRUNKEN ANGEL are among his finest works.  IKIRU is one of Kurosawa's most unique and moving films.IKIRU is perhaps Kurosawa's most intimate film, focusing on the inner life of a single character as he confronts his impending death. The first shot of the film is of an X-ray that shows that the central character of the film, Kanji Watanabe, portrayed magnificently by Kurosawa mainstay Takashi Shimura (the head samurai from SEVEN SAMURAI, the woodcutter from RASHOMON, and a host of other roles), is dying of cancer. A minor bureaucrat, during the course of the film he realizes how meaningless his life has been, and resolves to leave at least one good work behind. He single-mindedly focuses on getting a park for children built in the little time he has left, and the image of the soon-to-die Watanabe sitting in a swing in the park while it is snowing (winter being a sign of the end of his life but the snow a purifying symbol of the covering of past blemishes) he built for the children is one of the most powerful and beautiful in cinema. Only the most steely hearted won't find a tear welling up during that scene.There is a didactic message at the heart of IKIRU: we spend our lives asleep, doing things that do not truly matter and will leave no mark behind us when we leave. The question remains whether we, the living, will wake up like Watanabe, or whether we will go to our graves never really having lived. The irony in the film is that only when confronted with his own death.

With imminent death in his future, Watanabe resolves to figuring out how to spend his last days. The film is expertly plotted: During the first half we see Watanabe before his death, coping with his illness, dealing with his relationship to his son and daughter-in-law, his fascination with one of his young subordinates and his struggle to find his purpose in life. The final half of the picture takes place during Watanabe's wake, where his fellow bureaucrats and co-workers muse about Watanabe's final act of generosity.I've heard some people regard movies like 'High Noon', 'Rebecca', 'Gone with the Wind', 'Godfather I and II' and 'The Last Picture Show' as being  as perfect a movie as possible. In my humble opinion this is as perfect a movie as one can get. Of all of Kurosawa's achievements in film, this movie is his greatest because he approaches a big subject (life and it's meanings) and succeeds in every valued aspect of film making (story, music, visual, editing).The film never takes a cheap exit out of things. Characters never speak to directly inform the audience of the story's themes and motives. Instead the film is more subtle, we see that Watanabe is lonely (during the scene where he and the writer hit the town, Watanabe is in the middle of the dancing crowd but is somehow out of place) and misunderstood (the scene where Watanabe is about to reveal his disease to his son while his son and daughter-in-law just want him to  leave the room). Everything is implied but easily understood. And through it's simplicity the film achieves a complex portrait of the life of a dying man.What is life worth? What should a man aspire to and what can he truly achieve? What is the meaning of life? This film approaches those questions and, in some instances, answers them.Subtle and poignant, this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[10, 13]","Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" is a reflective and personal story that offers a fascinating contrast to the director's more epic works.  It is a timeless tale of the power of the individual to triumph over the mechanizations of an uncaring bureaucracy.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a government employee who has dutifully done his job for 30 years.  He is forced to reevaluate his life after being told he has only six more months to live.  Watanabe decides to live up his final days and hooks up with a novelist (Yunosuke Ito) who introduces him to the pleasures of Tokyo's nightlife, but the experience proves less than satisfying.  After an insightful talk with a young co-worker named Toyo Odagiri (Miki Odagiri), the dying man sets out to accomplish something meaningful with the time he has left.""Ikiru"" is notable for its exploration of social dynamics within a structured society but is more memorable for its exploration of Watanabe's humanity.  Shimura touchingly conveys the plight of Watanabe and effectively keeps him from transforming him into an overly-sentimental character.  Odagiri is also excellent in a crucial role and leaves one of the more lasting impressions amongst the female characters that have populated Kurosawa's works.

It is not a bootleg (though bootleg versions may also exist).THE SUBTITLES ON THE MEI AH VERSION ARE SO BAD THAT THE MOVIE IS NEARLY UNWATCHABLE. The English subtitles are a translation of the Chinese subtitles/translation of the original Japanese dialogue. This is evident because the Japanese characters bizarrely have Chinese names.

345656,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,6302919649,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[20, 21]","Imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months. What would you do? What would you decide mattered to you? What would you think you had accomplished? What would you consider left unaccomplished? What would you want your legacy to be?Those are the questions facing the centeral character in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (meaning ""To live""). The brilliant actor Takashi Shimura plays the role of Kanji Watanabe, a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little. One day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die. This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile. He tries to ""live it up"" with newfound friends and loose women, but this does not fulfill him. He cannot bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate; caught up in their own petty problems, they seem to have little time for the old man. Eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit, another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful. But even she cannot help this poor man who needs love, fulfillment, a sense of purpose. And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward. After he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who, while previously fighting him every step of the way, now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory, paying him much lip service while denying him true honor.Normally I don't give so detailed a plot description, but I've done so here for two reasons: 1) few people, particularly in America, have seen or even heard of this movie, and 2) I want to point out how universal the themes are, how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast. While watching Ikiru I kept thinking a good modern title might be, ""The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same."" Like so many Kurosawa films, this movie, though black and white and old, feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content. While much has been made of Kurosawa's concern with the Japanese conflict between collective and individual, the issues in Ikiru resonates with any culture, not just Japan's. These bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar. This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle. It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life. At the same time, it never feels pretentious or preachy.The story is complex, not in terms of plot twists, but in terms of its ""inner life."" Yet with a running time of two hours and 23 minutes, Ikiru moves very quickly, feeling faster than a typical 90-minute Hollywood film. This is probably because there is lots of ground to cover, and also because of the effortless acting. Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema. Though Shimura is not widely known in the west, he was one of Japan's major actors of the 1950s and 60s, and Kurosawa worked with him often. See him in Kurosawa's Seven Samuri, made just two years after this film, for a completely different performance, one of swagger and bravado.Other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker. She too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher, but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves. On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is ""The Mummy."" Rather than be offended, he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed.It's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this. Yet the film, or the third act of it, also reminded me of a very different motion picture--Citizen Kane, believe it or not. While stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common, both deal with a man, recently dead, who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially. They try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture, while we, as the omniscent audience, do. They misunderstand his actions, and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite. (Often with Kane the reverse is true.) The only difference is while Watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character, Kane is not. Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces.Ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or ""Mr. K,"" as he was called by many). Katayama was the head of Nissan Motor's West Coast division in North America in the 1960s and 70s. He was brought to the task when Nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence, especially in North America, which was then ruled by big, powerful Ford and GM cars. Though Katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death, he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in America, which he did through steady, unflagging determination. But he also went against the grain of Japanese business protocol, and encountered the wrath of his superiors in Tokyo. Ironically, the more successful he became, the more he was resented. (His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.) After establishing Nissan as a major player in America, Katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work. He died in obscurity, but today Mr. K is a revered figure at Nissan, and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago. Executives now dislocate their jaws praising him. It all sounds too familiar.The second DVD has two features, a 90 minute documentary from Kurosawa's own production company about his working methods, wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product; and a 40-minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews.  Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them.  There's also the film's trailer and a commentary track which I confess I haven't had time to listen to.  It's by Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa.Criterion once again is the standard to which all DVD makers should be aspiring. The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see. It's unfortunate that for many years Kurosawa's work was not better taken care of. Like Nissan's Mr. K, he was without honor in his own country, because he was considered ""too Western"" in his outlook. Like Mr. K, his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland. Fortunately, the work of this ""Mr. K"" is finally being preserved. Ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you've never seen a Japanese movie before, even if you've never heard of Akira Kurosawa, even if you ""hate"" foreign or black and white films, even if you think you have no interest in the subject. Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story. Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term ""timeless classic.""",5,A timeless masterpiece on universal themes,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,7532,"['Imagine', 'found', 'were', 'going', 'die',

Are you buried in work when you get to that job, work that largely amounts to nothing else than shuffling paper around to other departments (or - in our current computer age - answering, forwarding, or deleting endless streams of emails)? And with all this work, do you see little to nothing ever really done or accomplished?If so, you are a lot like Kanji Watanabe (played by Takashi Shimura), the main character of Kurosawa's sublime film Ikiru. Kanji is a mid-level government bureaucrat, and he's been having stomach pain and problems lately, just as he is finding his job (a job he has been at for 20+ years) increasingly hard to stomach. Kanji's wife is dead, and his son is not worthy of Kanji at all; his son and his wife are more interested in inheriting Kanji's money and house than they are in Kanji. Kanji isn't having a great time of things, and his stomach pain finally forces him to the doctor, where he is diagnosed with stomach cancer. He is given about 6 months left to live.Sounds really bleak, doesn't it? Sounds like you don't need to ruin your night by watching this, do you? Oh, but you do. This is merely the set-up to a movie that will touch your heart and soul, and it could make you view your life in a different, more positive way.Loosely based on Tolstoy's story ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"" and sharing some of that story's themes, Kurosawa's Ikiru (which means ""To Live"" in Japanese) has Kanji facing his approaching death and also facing the fact that his life up until now hasn't meant much at all. What will Kanji do with his final few months on earth? Will he forsake his job and bury himself in hedonism, spending all his money on parties and fun with his remaining time? Will he continue at his job just as he was, trying to do even less than he was before?It is through a relationship with Toyo (Miki Odagiri), an employee who hands Kanji her resignation at the government agency, where Kanji discovers what he will do with his remaining days.This movie is told in two discrete parts. The first part is told showing Kanji go about his days and is told from his perspective; the second part is told showing Kanji's life through the eyes of others. You slowly see the complete story of Kanji's life and what he has done as it is revealed by his friends, and that revelation has the power to lift your soul.Can you find meaning in the meaningless? Can you make a difference in the lives of others when going about your daily, mundane existence, even while being crippled by a terminal disease? And can you do it with your dignity and humanity intact?Yes, you can.Unless you work for Express Scripts. Even Kanji couldn't to that. :)Don't miss this movie, folks. It is one of the very best.

345661,A21X0EO0R0T6FT,6302919649,Vincent Poirier,"[1, 2]","Watanabe-san is a city bureaucrat, he is head of the section of public affairs. This means his staff shuffle papers that come through their section from other departments. They pile them up on Watanabe-san's in-tray from where he takes them, stamps them, and piles them up in his out-tray.His staff also attend to the public desk where city residents submit their requests. Having heard them, the public affairs staff are trained to expertly pass the buck to other departments, as are the staff of all the other departments.When a group of ladies comes to ask for a ditch to be filled, Watanabe hardly notices them getting shunted off to the sanitation department. He barely stop stamping his seal on forms to slurp a bowl of noodles. His lunch doesn't agree with him so he pops a stomach pill. He fails to show up to work the next day. We already know he has stomach cancer, but he doesn't yet.He takes his first sick day in nearly thirty years, goes to the hospital, and though the doctors won't admit it, he understands he has a terminal cancer with less than a year to live.In a daze, he doesn't go to the office for two weeks. He goes to a bar and tells his troubles to a random patron. They strike up a brief friendship and he tries to help Watanabe enjoy himself in sampling a little of the city's night life. Watanabe feels just as lost the next morning. He runs into a young female member of his staff, a carefree girl who has decided to quit the civil service because she finds it boring. He grasps at her company. To the world he looks like an old man doting on new love, but that's not it. He's reaching for a life line.He tries to tell his son about his cancer, but is rebuffed for his inapproriate conduct with the young girl. He turns to her one last time, and finally finds a purpose to his life.Five months later we are at his wake with his colleagues. He died suddenly the night before. He had been behaving strangely in his last months. He had been doing things. He had been pushing for things. (A cultural aside: in Japan the correct way to push is to wait until you are noticed.) His colleagues debate whether or not he knew he was dying. As they get more and more drunk, they conclude he did know and that he was able to do one good thing before dying. Dying had given him the will to live and to do.With Ikiru, director Akira Kurosawa tells us to seize the day, to live now because we might die tomorrow. The message is trite, but forgotten basic truths often are.The film isn't perfect though, or I should say the story isn't perfect. The acting is passionate, the structure is impecable and original, and Kurosawa keeps the cinematography simple, as befits a story about an ordinary man; this isn't a samurai epic. However, his social commentary is a little nave: Japanese bureaucrats aren't protagonists in a Kafkaesque nightmare, they are usually quite helpful and they did in fact lead Japan through its modernization in the late nineteenth century and in rebuilding the country from the ashes of World War II.I speak from personal experience when I say Japanese bureaucrats are helpful. I've once had a 450,000 yen tax bill corrected in 15 minutes, with an apology from the lady at the tax office. I did get a tiny bit of a bureaucratic run around because I'd gone to the national tax office rather than the city tax office, but once I got to the right desk, they fixed the problem instantly. Tax officers! I'll spare you other stories like this, but I have many. At worst they might indeed forget to live their own lives, but they are doing something.Another problem is that given Watanabe had lived through World War II, it's hard to believe his life was as uneventful as the film makes it out to have been. And given that Japan was still in ashes and being rebuilt, it's jarring to see the malaise depicted in Ikiru is one of living a meaningless unproductive life.Perhaps Kurosawa was obliquely criticizing the war effort? But no, I think that he and other artists simply did not see the point of pouring steel or making cars. Nor did the bureaucrats appreciate so many people wasting precious time and resources on making movies. The bureaucrats and the artists just didn't see the value of each other's endeavors. Kurosawa had to work with small budgets grudgingly spared from ""more important things"" so he disparaged these things, misunderstanding their importance as much as the ""serious minded"" bureaucrats misunderstood the artists and their existential angst.Vincent Poirier, TokyoNote: There are real problems with Japanese bureaucracy. When enforcing the law, Japanese bureaucrats and authorities can be incredibly cruel, but they will be actively cruel and harsh.
