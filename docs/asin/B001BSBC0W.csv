1173267,AOJVZCKXK55BC,B001BSBC0W,C. Allison,"[8, 8]","Let's be 100% clear about what this is: the 3 Super Bowl games in this set are simply the TV broadcasts of the games, as they were presented at the times (1983, 1988, 1992). No window dressing, no sugar-coating, no bells, and no whistles. While it would've been (very) nice to have included SOME highlights (or even brief mentions) of the playoff games to led up to each Super Bowl game, and definitely better to have the RADIO audio (Sonny, Sam, & Frank) versus the TV commentators, it's still a triumph to FINALLY have a copy of the Super Bowl games themselves, esp. for myself, not having a VCR back in 1983.I hope (against hope) NFL Films will see fit to go back and retrieve the radio commentary for these games (NFLF does include snippets of radio play-by-play in every other Redskins' DVD highlight set they sell).  This set is for WS fans, and I'd much rather hear the voices of my ""homer"" radio announcers than ""objective"" TV heads.
