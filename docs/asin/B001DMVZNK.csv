The power was fading on the batteries at the end of the show. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.This is the best show that ever was and to miss it should be a crime. do yourself and your kids a favore and buy this for them.

That's what I did.I first watched GFA when it aired in 1983 and I was glued to my little black-and-white TV for the entire 2 1/1 hours, and at the end I was sobbing, especially when the ""Goodbye"" spelled out in rocks was seen from the helicopter.  So I waited and watched for when it would come out on VHS, which it did eventually.  However, my VCR died and I was thinking about getting GFA for DVD.When I saw I could get the final season as well, I jumped at the chance.  It's a fitting build up to the final episode, and season 11 helps flesh out some of the supporting players.  Truly MASH had matured from the early days with Trapper John.  But I was a little disappointed that the laugh track was so evident--I didn't remember that from watching the series on reruns.  And really there are no stand out episodes, such as the one told entirely from the patient's point of view in an earlier season.But all in all a must-have for the serious MASH fan.",5,Such a deal!!,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,1070,"['Why', 'pay', '23.99', 'just', 'Good-bye', 'Farewell', 'Amen', 'when', 'can', 'pay', '16.49', 'get', 'entire', '11th', 'season', 'too', 'what', 'did.I', 'first', 'watched', 'GFA', 'when', 'aired', '1983', 'was', 'glued', 'little', 'black-and-white', 'TV', 'entire', '2', '1/1', 'hours', 'end', 'was', 'sobbing', 'especially', 'when', 'Goodbye', 'spelled', 'out', 'rocks', 'was', 'seen', 'helicopter', 'So', 'waited', 'watched', 'when', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'VHS', 'did', 'eventually', 'However', 'VCR', 'died', 'was', 'thinking', 'getting', 'GFA', 'DVD.When', 'saw', 'could', 'get', 'final', 'season', 'well', 'jumped', 'chance', 'fitting', 'build', 'final', 'episode', 'season', '11', 'flesh', 'out', 'supporting', 'players', 'Truly', 'MASH', 'had', 'matured', 'early', 'days', 'Trapper', 'John', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'laugh', 'track', 'was', 'so', 'evident', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'watching', 'series', 'reruns', 'really', 'are', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'such', 'one', 'told', 'entirely', 'patient', 'point', 'view', 'earlier', 'season.But', 'must-have', 'serious', 'MASH', 'fan']",M*A*S*H TV Season 11: Final Season

Some of the episodes while still enjoyable seem a little tedious. For example the season opener largley consisting of Nurse Kelly jealous of Hawkeye's affection and not much else or the episode about Winchester's snoring. Some of the stries seem to have less to do with the war itself and attempts to escape from it than things like somebody snoring or an ingrown toenail that really were sort of trivial but MASH was still way ahead of the rest and this seems a fitting end before something actually does Jump The Shark and becomes unwatchable and just a bad parody of itself.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[21, 21]","The first few episodes of Season 11 showed that it was definitely time for one of the most celebrated shows of television history to close shop: Episodes began to be written featuring characters who had previously only had lines like ""yes, Doctor"" or ""would you like bread with lunch, Major?""But a lot of thought plainly went into the final moments: it is worth the price of the entire package for only the final two episodes: In ""As Time Goes By"" Margaret decides to lead a group burying a time capsule commemorating their time at the 4077th.  When the boys in The Swamp offer to help she is resistant, knowing the general lack of seriousness from Hawkeye and B.J.  This episode does a good job combining the trademark of the show: M*A*S*H was able to be funnier than almost any show in history, while at the same time addressing serious issues in more depth than almost any other ""drama"".The finale ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"" remains the most watched television broadcast of all time - over 50 million households were tuned in, which represented more than 60% of the tvs in use, about 10 million more than the highest-rated Super Bowls.  I remember well watching the original broadcast with a large group - the 30 minute sit-com format was turned into a 2 1/2 hour broadcast, and we were riveted for every moment.  Originally, we were disconcerted - what was Hawkeye doing in the loony bin?  The episode unraveled at a leisurely pace and every major character received a well-deserved shining moment leading up to the climax where we discover why Hawkeye cracked up.

In this final Season we see a closer to everything in the 4077.
