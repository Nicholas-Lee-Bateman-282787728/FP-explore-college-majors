974451,A1CNDQIH0RRHS1,B000EMGIDC,Adrienne B.,"[0, 0]","I'm not sure if anyone can really expect anything other then awesomeness coming from adult swim. I have to say that The Venture Bros goes above and beyond any expectations I had about it. I saw my first episode at a friends house and was hooked ever since then. I went home and bought all the seasons right away.I have been told that apparently The Venture Bros is supposed to be a Johnny Quest type of spoof, but I cant personally say anything about it because Ive never sat through Johnny Quest. What I can say is that I loved every episode of this show. The main characters are a lot of fun and make it easy to laugh with (at?) them. The episodes are very random, but I think that is part of the charm of the show. And surprisingly there is actually a plot to be found inside the randomness. There are many characters in this show to fall in love with and they each bring their own uniqueness, personality, and dynamics. I especially love what the Dr. Girlfriend and The Monarch relationship brings to the table.And on a final note I just wanted to say that Brock Samson is one of the coolest cartoon characters ever created.",5,Hilarious,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,1128,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'can', 'really', 'expect', 'anything', 'other', 'then', 'coming', 'adult', 'swim', 'have', 'say', 'Venture', 'Bros', 'expectations', 'had', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'friends', 'house', 'was', 'hooked', 'ever', 'then', 'went', 'home', 'bought', 'seasons', 'right', 'away.I', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'apparently', 'Venture', 'Bros', 'supposed', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Quest', 'type', 'spoof', 'cant', 'personally', 'say', 'anything', 'Ive', 'never', 'sat', 'Johnny', 'Quest', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'loved', 'episode', 'show', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'make', 'easy', 'laugh', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'random', 'think', 'part', 'charm', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'actually', 'plot', 'be', 'found', 'randomness', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'show', 'fall', 'love', 'bring', 'own', 'uniqueness', 'personality', 'dynamics', 'especially', 'love', 'what', 'Dr', 'Girlfriend', 'Monarch', 'relationship', 'table.And', 'final', 'note', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'Brock', 'Samson', 'one', 'coolest', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'ever', 'created']",The Venture Bros.

974452,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000EMGIDC,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[164, 190]","The first thing I'm going to say is this: although this is a cartoon, it is most definitely not for kids!  The Venture Bros. deals with a lot of adult situations, and it can get very vulgar and graphic at times.  Having said that, this may be one of the best new cartoons I've seen in a long time.I was never really a big fan of Adult Swim; until I got to college, the only show on the block I had seen was Futurama, which debuted on FOX.  While I still don't like overall, it does have its gems, such as Cowboy Bebop (best anime ever!), Aqua Teen Hunger Force (when it was in its prime), and The Venture Bros.  The Venture Bros. is a show that most heavily parodies Johnny Quest, though it also draws from Star Wars, DC and Marvel Comics, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Kafka's The Metamorphosis.The plot is as follows; Dr. Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture is the son of Dr. Jonas Venture, one of history's greatest inventors and adventurers.  Jonas built up a successful science industry and led a team of heroes known as Team Venture.  Unfortunately, Rusty was never able to live up to his father's image.  He never completed college (thus the fact that he calls himself a doctor is called into question a couple times), and he is pretty incompetant at most everything he does.  Most of his inventions don't even work, and when they do, they always malfunction.  He is also a pill-popper who suffers from dreams involving his dead father and a weird flashback to his mother's womb.  However, he is a genius compared to his two sons.  Hank and Dean Venture redefine naive.  Even though they see themselves as cool and brave, they are anything but.  They get squeamish around violence and are easily scared, yet they are always clamoring to go on new adventures, in which something always inevitably goes wrong.  Fortunately, the three Venture men are protected by CIA agent Brock Sampson (voiced wonderfully by Patrick Warburton, who played David Puddy in Seinfeld and was The Tick in the live action series).  Brock is basically an unstoppable man-beast who defies the laws of physics and biology to keep Dr. Venture and his sons safe.  Other Venture allies include Dr. Byron Orpheus, a sorceror who tends to speak in an overly dramatic voice (even when warning others not to use a bathroom due to his choice to have Taco Bell for lunch) and his daughter Triana, who is kind of a goth/punk and is embarassed by her dad very often.  Dean has a crush on her, but she finds the Ventures pretty silly.  Dr. White and Master Billy Quizboy are two other allies who help out Dr. Venture from time to time.  Dr. White is an albino while Billy is a vertically challenged genius with an oversized head.On the villains side, Dr. Venture's archnemesis is The Monarch, a man who was raised by monarch butterflies after his parents died in an accident.  He too is incompetant (seems to be a running theme in this show); he doesn't really have any ""powers"" per se, besides his weak weapons he built into his suit, and his henchmen are morons.  The best twist though is that while The Monarch considers himself to be Dr. Venture's greatest nemesis, he has no reason to (Dr. Venture barely realizes that he exists).  In this sense, I like to attribute The Monarch to The Joker; in a sense one can't exist without the other, or at least, that's how things would be if Venture actually paid attention to what was going on around him.  The Monarch is dating Dr. Girlfriend, a woman who dresses like Jackie O. and probably has the deepest voice on the show.  The other main villains include Baron Werner Underbeit, a Dr. Doom-esque villan who blames Venture for a lab explosion that blew off his jaw, as well as Phantom Limb, a man whose arms and legs are invisible.Most of the episodes involve the family, Brock, and H.E.L.P.eR (the Venture's robot) going on some sort of misadventure, where Brock basically has to bail everyone out by the end.  That's not to say that the episodes are formulaic; each one is very unique and very hilarious.  For example, in one of them, Dr. Venture holds a yard sale in order to raise money, only to have a bunch of villains show up and create havoc.  In another, the family goes to a theme park run by a Walt Disney lookalike who tries to get Venture to clone him.  And in one of my favorite episodes, The Monarch is put on trial, and the opening scene is priceless (MECHA SHIVA!).A lot of the show's humor is derived from the sheer bizarrness of the situation; most of the adventures are beyond impractical, and knowing how limited the abilities of the Venture family are, one has to wonder why they don't just give up.  There is a good amount of parody, but the show doesn't overdo it (the way too many shows and movies are doing nowadays).  And there are some very dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.  As I said, this is not for kids.  It is somewhere between a PG-13 and an R in terms of rating (they can only go so far because its TV, but there are times when, if it hasn't crossed the line, it is walking it).  I think that at times, its even dirtier than Family Guy (and much funnier).The Venture Bros. is not for everyone; the humor is for a very select group, and there are some scenes that are extremely disturbing and disgusting.  However, it is a hilarious show that deserves a look.  You're only hurting yourself by not checking it out.",5,Cockpits!  Booby Traps!

When it first started airing I thought it was a waste of time because the commericals made it look retarded. But one night when I was watching [adult swim] I decided to give it a chance. Man, that could possibly have been the smartest decision in my life. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing on the TV screen. I thought to myself ""could someone have came up with something this great??Episode after Episode I was never dissappointed. Each episode has it's own originality that never makes it feel like you're watching the same thing twice. The jokes are never reused (Unlike Family Guy which uses the same jokes over and over) the characters are easily likeable and have their own personality about themselves. Whether it's Dr. Orpheous's over-dramatic tone or Monarch's schemeing to ruin Dr.Venture's life you will never want this show to end. It's kinda stupid how they're releasing the DVD on May 30th '06 when they already have it completed. (If you want proof look up ""The Mantis-Eye Experiment A Venture Bros. Fansite) No matter what you're looking for in a cartoon whether it's action, killing, blood, gore, comedy, adult situations, histerical-ass jokes, this show has every thing that you could ever want. The Venture Bros. is easily my favorite show by a long shot. Get your ass off of that Family Guy kick and check this show out. I bet after you do you'll look at shows like Family Guy and think ""Did used to think this was funny???"" trust me I know.

974459,A18LDSB4HZLE2G,B000EMGIDC,DrSpecter,"[2, 2]","Of all the Adult Swim shows I'm familiar with, this is the most satisfying. In some ways, Harvey Birdman is funnier. But it's mostly a collection of pop culture references and off-color gags.The Venture Brothers is an extremely edgy adult comedy. The characters are fleshed out to a greater degree than in most live action dramas. The level of caricature is on par with early Mad Magazine. The writing is similar to some of the more extreme post-underground comics put out by Fantagraphics. The cinematography and cutting are highly cinematic.The scene in the pilot where Brock mows down the henchmen in his car reminds me of something out of a Jack Hill Pam Grier vehicle or even a Russ Meyer movie! In fact, I think they should get Charles Napier to play his estranged father.In general, at it's best, TVB takes the Johnny Quest formula of a movie a week, and turns them in to 60s/70s drive-in movies. This, to me, is pure gold.Season two has gotten more hit and miss, with Brock going soft, too many animated pseudo-celebrity cameos, and many episodes degenerating to actionless soap operas. But even those episodes are pretty good. And some of my favorite episodes are from the second season. It's just more hit-and-miss.I commend Adult Swim in green lighting something as subtle, dark and edgy as TVB often is. The main sources of comedy tend to be themes like failure, insanity and death! Even if you don't get all of the references, it's a good show.

974461,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000EMGIDC,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","The Cartoon Network is known for its kooky Adult Swim programming, with everything from ""Robot Chicken"" to winged superhero lawyers.But few cartoon shows can match the level of comic brilliance of ""The Venture Brothers,"" which unabashedly spoofs ""Jonny Quest"" and other kiddie adventure fare. It's loaded down with hilarious writing, aspiring supervillains, adolescent humor and the most dysfunctional family ever to fly a superjet.It's about the adventures of Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, a has-been child genius who is still overshadowed by his adventurous dad's legacy. And he now has two dim teenage sons of his own, Dean and Hank (""Go Team VENTURE!""), as well as the nurturing robot H.E.L.P.eR. And finally there's his knife-wielding, lusty mullet-haired Swedish bodyguard Brock.In the first episode, the brothers are kidnapped by the Monarch, a second-rate villain who desperately wants to be Dr. Venture's nemesis. Meanwhile, Dr. Venture has had both kidneys stolen, and Brock is apparently dead -- but he won't let a little thing like that (or the chupacabras) keep him from rescuing Hank and Dean.In the episodes that follow, the Venture Brothers bravely (and stupidly) deal with the minions of the Monarch and steel-jawed Baron &Uuml;nderbheit, a crazed Walt Disneyesque mogul, their friendly neighbor necromancer, a broken space station, ghost pirates (both real and fake), testicular torsion, secret twins, yard sales, murderous robots, and a date gone wrong -- Dr. Venture ends up turning into a giant caterpillar.There's also two extra episodes: the pilot, where thw twins get lost in NYC while a ninja tries to steal Venture's latest invention. And then there's the Christmas special, in which the Monarch riddles the Venture compound with explosives -- and a nasty Christmas spirit crashes the Christmas party to punish the wicked.A series like ""Jonny Quest"" is just asking for a spoof, and ""Venture Brothers"" happily obliges. But in fact, it also mocks the Fantastic Four, Sean Connery, Christmas specials, and Germanic villains -- basically all unrealistic action-adventure. Where else can you find a villain's henchman arguing who would win in a ""crazy fantasy fight-fight between Anne Frank and Lizzie Borden""?It's full of adolescent gross-out humor (porta-potties), gory action (wrestling mummies and alligators), and the odd sex scene for Brock. But the genius is in the scripting, which is often crazy and unabashedly sarcastic: ""With every fiber of my being I stab at thee, as long as blood flows through this heart I will hunt you down. I will be the stuff of your children's nightmares!"" ""What's he doing now?"" ""He's making his dramatic exit.""Patrick Warburton and James Urbaniak are simply brilliant as the indestructible Brock and the embittered Venture, with Michael Sinterniklaas as the naive Dean, and Christopher McCulloch doing many roles, most prominently Hank and the whiny-voiced Monarch. And Steven Rattazzi gets a special mention as the melodramatic necromancer/single dad Dr. Orpheus.""The Venture Brothers"" have exactly the kind of adventures that kids dream of NOT having, but for the grown-ups, it's a hilarious animated comedy.

In fact, he's more adept at getting himself kidnapped, which is why he has Brock Samson, his blonde, rage-prone bodyguard.His kids, Dean and Hank (who I maintain is a spoof on Freddie from Scobby Doo), are more interested in irritating one another than anything their father wants, and the family is completed by H.E.L.P.E.R., a robot who never once lives up to his name.Aside from Brock, the Venture clan is pretty much a sad lot, which makes it difficult for The Monarch, Dr. Venture's arch-nemesis, to really hate him properly.""Here I am, in the belly of the beast, and I don't even care,"" the Monarch says when he sneaks into Venture's laboratory in one episode.

The Venture Brothers is probably my favorite of them all (The Brak Show was a riot also). I am in my 40's and so I can relate to all the jokes on the stuff I grew up on (Marvel, DC, Johnny Quest, Scooby Doo, etc). The formula started with SGCTC taking mundane kids 60's-70's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references (many homosexual), uber violence for violence's sake, profanity (beeped out but you know what they are saying), well you get my drift (think excrement jokes). It's Ted Turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi American of good vs. bad in cartoons, and screwing it all to hell. But despite the same formula over and over (SGCTC, Harvey Birdman AAL, The Brak Show, Robot Chicken, Aqua Team Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and probably some others I missed), I still watch and laugh, with The Venture Brothers being the best of them all. One thing that I really laugh about is that the teens and gen X'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from, they are just laughing at the situations and don't get the parody.

Take adult humor, throw in equal amounts of Scooby-Doo and Jonny Quest, then top it off with the voice of Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove and you've a recipe for success. The sheer number of one-liners in a single episode, which always manage to be packed with enough clich&eacute; and homoeroticism to sate any sense of humor, are astounding. I wouldn't call it the greatest cartoon out there for us old people. But it's right up there with some of the best. It walks a fine line between making you feel like a child on Saturday morning all over again and reminding you that you're old enough now to understand all the dirty jokes which once might have flown right over your head. And this balancing act can sometimes work against the show's appeal just as much as it can act to strengthen it. Still, despite the minor (and I do mean minor) flaws in the equation, this train has every intention of plowing right into your funny bone. I recommend you let it. You'll feel better for it.

Plus lots of TV and alternative music references from the '80s. I love cartoons (even at my age!) but rarely consider buying any for fear of tiring of them quickly. That has yet to happen with this and/or the second season of ""The Venture Brothers."" It's simply brilliant satire and great fun. The extras of the creators and cast dressed as some of the characters they to whom they give voice is fun (no sign of Patrick/Brock, unfortunately, anywhere except in the episodes themselves), the deleted ""scenes"" are just draft storyboard images and are thus not very interesting. The only negative I have to report concerns the episode commentaries (not every episode has a commentary, but you won't mind --trust me on this!). They suck. The guys (the creators) are obviously not into it, are bored, and are making the best of a chore-like situation. I have yet to make it through all the commentaries as I really don't find the guys' personal interchanges to be of any interest. Occasionally, one reminds the other they are supposed to be talking about the show, of which they do very, very little.

The 5th season is slated for 2013 release as I type this and I am certain that will be good, could be better if the producers see the downfall of season 3 and 4. But the first season is absolutely the best 'Venture' experience. Still makes me laugh, the episodes have the most atmosphere about them. They also have plenty of references to classics and the best humor.There is no familiarity at this point in the show during season 1 and even season 2 is still ok,the Venture family is dysfunctional to a point of mild believability. Later they go so dysfunctional it's schizophrenic, which that word sums up seasons 3 and 4. By then the show ran almost completely on inside jokes and references and a tangled web of various inter-character relationships that seem to go nowhere or serve no purpose. There was barely enough humor to keep the show going at that point.Gotta sum this up: If you caught any of the Venture episodes and at least laughed a little, get the first season. It's not too expensive and it's the best season and guaranteed kicks. From there decide if you like the show enough for Season 2, which is still pretty good.

974496,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,B000EMGIDC,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""","[1, 2]","It's summer, and like Anton La Vey once said, ""the living is sleazy"".  And since I am pale skinned, originally from the North and live in San Diego, that means a lot of time inside in my studio, feverish working on painting and maybe world domination because if I go outside for more than 10 minutes at a time, I will burst into flame.  Being in a midday prison, I tend to listen to music or watch DVDs while I create.I never left a review of this show when I first bought it, so I am doing it now, late in the game.  I first heard of this show via Foetus'  website.  I was excited and cautious that J. G. Thirlwell had signed on for a cartoon and thought it would probably be a dark film noir type thing, because I enjoy songs like Bedrock and the record Nail, overly violent and dark.  I was a little scared to see him jump into what I would call a mainstream project, because that tends to ruin a good thing a lot of the time.  The last thing the world needs is a watered down Foetus!I tried to watch it on Adult Swim when the first season came out.  I am not sure if it was my TV, cable or the way it was mixed, but on my TV, the music was loud and dominated everything.  Not that I minded, since I am a Foetus fan from way back.  It could be silent only for the music.  Being a freelance writer, I tend to want to hear words now and then so I withdrew after 2-3 episodes, hoping to catch up once the DVDs came out. Then I got involved in work and suddenly Season Two was in a bundle with it.  I picked them both up, hoping to catch up before the 3rd season.One of the first things I noticed other than the music, was the graphics, esp the titles.  It took me a while to realize these were done by Doc Hammer, well Eric Hammer, a man I admire for his oil paintings first and his gothic music, like the band Mors Syphilitica second.  I didn't really put two and two together, thinking that those Hammer kids tended to shun any and all publicity and wanted the work to stand out on its own.  But indeed, Lisa Hammer was there too.  It was like eating a great meal and just when you think it is over, out pops the perfect dessert.  It is the icing on the cake.  it's a nice metaphor of life in the womb to a horrible sexy death.So with this in mind, this should be my favorite TV show of all time.  It seems written, scored and contains product as if I put my likes into a machine and it spit out this.The DVD of the First Season was a bit disappointing to me, but it I was hoping it would be uncensored. The nudity and swearing is boxed and/or bleeped out.  The animation is better than anything I've seen on Adult Swim.  I hope the production assistants as well as the creators get credit for that.  I do have to point out though a couple of the episode drawings seen really thick lined compared to the rest and that is distracting when you are watching them all in a row.  The music is fantastic, since most of what Jim Foetus touches is gold. The writing goes from great a lot of the time, to fair, like sometimes the writer needed filler yet compared to the myriad of reality shows out there, the intelligence of the writing is a stand out.  Even in comparing it with Adult Swim in general, it's the best show I've seen on there.  I like the obscure references, never sure if it was made for college kids or people in their 30's like me.  I tend to think you'd have to be in your late 30's to get some of the jokes, but maybe there are kids out there that have more brain power than I give them credit for.  I like the references to ""the Bauhaus"" and the guy who first played them on the radio (I read a similar story about a DJ here who played Depeche Mode for the first time in the US, supposedly).  Any show that also offers a Lydia Lunch reference, ok, Foetus is doing the music, but still, she's there.  As is the more expected pop culture ones like Rocky Horror and Fame, as well as a ton of Super Hero cartoon references from the obvious Johnny Quest (used to be one of my favorites as a kid) to Scooby Doo to the Incredibles to the Thunderbirds.I like most of the characters.  Patrick Warburton is my favorite voice actor on the show and I also enjoy his work in Family Guy.  His character, Brock, reminds me of what Foetus type cartoon guy would be like. That and Molotov. Complete anger spurts and big action.  I tend to be drawn a bit more to the evil characters. The Monarch is a fabulous nemesis, even though the Venture's aren't sure why he is their nemesis.  I enjoyed the whole arthouse eating your twin dream in this season too.  I like that mystery added into the mix. And it did end with a decent cliffhanger.I like the fact Dr. Girlfriend has a male voice.  It's interesting to note most of the female characters seem to be strippers, hookers or love interests.  I've had this pointed out by female friends of mine.  But, I am a women who tends to have a lot more guy friends than girl friends and get knee deep in topics men seem to like a lot more than women, like horror movies and subcultural music, so I don't see the lack of female characters such a bad thing.My least favorite characters are the Venture Brothers themselves, ironic as that might be.  Yet they are growing on me.  I like the way they are always ushered off some place to not be in harm's way.  And I like that their dad has this shadow of his more famous father looming over him.  The cartoon has a lot of nice psychological humor, along with the references to 70's and 80's comics.  It isn't as quotable like Family Guy, but it does brings a smirk to me now and then. I just wonder sometimes if the only cartoons I like are the ones the satirize other ones.I'd be almost half pressed to go to Comic Con to ask a somewhat private question about Dr. Orpheus, since the whole shebang is in my backyard two weeks from now.  Alas, maybe next year.  I don't get all the bells and whistles of its super-commercialism, but friends tell me the panels are good.  It's just a lot of pay to see one panel. Too bad Weep isn't playing somewhere in SD that weekend.  I'd rather pay to see that.  I guess it's Made in Mexico instead for yours truly.I haven't gotten to the extras yet, so maybe I'll come back in a few years and finish this review.  Oh and one more thing, why does the Season One (as well as Season Three) have no credits whatsoever for the writers, actors and other people involved in this?  The DVD sets have such good artwork, I'd like to know who designed it, if not the name of the person, at least the company they work for.  Of course, I think the violent heavy artwork could give people who don't know of the show the wrong idea.  Which I like.  Nothing like misdirection.",5,You've got Foetus on Your Mors Syphilitica!,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,6680,"['summer', 'Anton', 'La', 'Vey', 'once', 'said', 'living', 'sleazy', 'am', 'pale',

But by the ghost pirate episode, i was hooked and aching with laughter. it is definitely worth buying and Amazon's price is good.I was never much of a  JOHNNY QUEST fan and spoofing it at this late date struck me as dubioius at first, but the characterization and humor are on a par with STRANGERS W/ CANDY: smart, irreverant and hilarious. The show is ultimately it's own entity with a sprawling sub-culture of bizarre villains and allies fleshing out the cast as the Season One progesses. The four  principlle characters are choice: The scientist dad in  is a horrible selfish nerd, his teenage sons are feckless wonders and their bodyguard Brock, (Race Bannon by way of Doc Savage) is so heroic he is a borderline psychotic. My favorite running joke is that the two title characters are utterly dead weight in pretty much every show, which doesn't dampen their clueless enthusiasm.  Come to think of it Johnny's main function was usually getting kidnapped and resuced.Buy this--its a keeper. It gets funnier the more you watch it and the extras are highly enjoyable.",5,Go Team Venture!,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1146,"['rented', 'first', 'have', 'admit', 'took', 'few', 'episodes', 'grow', 'ghost', 'pirate', 'episode', 'i', 'was', 'hooked', 'aching', 'laughter', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'price', 'good.I', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'JOHNNY', 'QUEST', 'fan', 'spoofing', 'late', 'date', 'struck', 'dubioius', 'first', 'characterization', 'humor', 'are', 'par', 'STRANGERS', 'W/', 'CANDY', 'smart', 'irreverant', 'hilarious', 'show', 'ultimately', 'own', 'entity', 'sprawling', 'sub-culture', 'bizarre', 'villains', 'allies', 'fleshing', 'out', 'cast', 'Season', 'One', 'four', 'principlle', 'characters', 'are', 'choice', 'scientist', 'dad', 'horrible', 'selfish', 'nerd', 'teenage', 'sons', 'are', 'feckless', 'wonders', 'bodyguard', 'Brock', 'Race', 'Bannon', 'way', 'Doc', 'Savage', 'so', 'heroic', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'favorite', 'running', 'joke', 'two', 'title', 'characters', 'are', 'utterly', 'dead', 'weight', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', ""n't"", 'dampen', 'clueless', 'enthusiasm', 'Come', 'think', 'Johnny', 'main', 'function', 'was', 'usually', 'getting', 'kidnapped', 'resuced.Buy', 'keeper', 'funnier', 'more', 'watch', 'extras', 'are', 'highly', 'enjoyable']",The Venture Bros.
