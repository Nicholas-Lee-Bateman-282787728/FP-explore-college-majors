I am a Preacher's kid so I guess that speaks for me. My favorite part was when Sonny moved back home with his Mother and he was having a shouting match with God but he was the only one shouting and the Mother's neighbor calls on the phone and ask her who was that man at her house yelling. The Mom explains to her neighbor why her Son was yelling then hangs up the phone while her neighbor is still talking and just smiles while laying in her bed. she was so happy to have her Son home even with the mess in his life she supported her son.

I'm not an old fashion old man or anything like that. I'm male I'm 22 years old. I bought this movies reading the great reviews about it not knowing what to expect. This movie tells the story of a ""pastor"" who gets drunk and beats people up and even commits murder. There is scenes about sex well kinda. hes also a liar by the way, at the end he goes to jail after running away from town for murdering a man. The only good thing about the movie is that the guy built a church but he wasn't really a man of God ( I'm not judging) Even Jesus said you'd know them by their fruit but where is the fruit when this guy is all about cursing?

58577,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783227426,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","If ever there was a movie that relied so much on a single performance to reach greatness it is this movie.  Seriously, `The Apostle' could have easily gone camp had Robert Duvall's performance been off key.  Well we can all praise Jesus (ha) that Robert Duvall invested his heart and soul into this amazingly spirited performance.  As Sonny he completely becomes absorbed into this man, into this role of his career and delivers a brilliantly controlled and emotionally fleshed out performance.  This is coming from someone who has never really cared for Duvall and felt he was an overrated actor.  It's funny because my best friend idolizes him and swears up and down he's the greatest actor ever and I just never saw it, until last night, and now I get it, or at least now I realize that when he's good he's pretty darn perfect.In `The Apostle' we meet Sonny, a charismatic somewhat obsessive Texas preacher who has all but driven his wife away due to his philandering ways.  We watch his life fall apart as his wife leaves him for another man, a youth minister, taking his children and eventually his church away from him.  In a fit of rage Sonny attacks his wife's lover with a baseball bat sending him into a coma and forcing Sonny to leave town.  Sonny winds up in Bayou Boutte, Louisiana, a small town that seems to soak up his eccentric style.  Claiming that the lord sent him, Sonny dons the persona of The Apostle E.F. and starts to build his church from the ground up, enlisting the help of a former minister in the area.  He begins to move forward with his life, corralling the community together for the lord's work, even going as far as to strike a relationship of sorts with a young woman in the town.  His past though cannot stay buried forever and as the condition of his wife's lover worsens the intensity to find and charge Sonny increases.The supporting players here are all at the very least decent, but no one is really given the limelight aside from Duvall.  Farrah Fawcett does a fine job as Sonny's ex-wife and Billy Bob Thornton does an excellent job as a local troublemaker out to destroy Sonny's newfound church but neither of them is given more than a passing glance of screen time.  June Carter Cash is deliciously effective as Sonny's ailing mother and she does more in her few minutes of time than the whole of the supporting cast put together.  I was not as impressed with Miranda Richardson as critics appeared to have been, I felt she was a bit too childish in her performance, but then again maybe that's what she was going for.  I didn't like it.  John Beasley does a fine job as Blackwell, the minister who gives Sonny a helping hand, and Rick Dial and Walton Goggins are both well used as townsfolk immediately drawn to Sonny.Really though, there is no actor here that deserves mention more than Robert Duvall.  His performance is downright perfection.  In fact, played any other way and this movie would have been a failure.  It would have been so easy for a film like this to become nothing more than a laugh riot, especially when you're subject matter is that of the bible thumping extremists, but Duvall is so serious, so devoted and so convincing that he manages to keep with the dramatic tones of the film and deliver to us a well constructed and effortlessly mesmerizing portrayal.  His performance won all kinds of critics awards and quite frankly should have won the Oscar.  `The Apostle' was truly a labor of love for the actor who also wrote, directed and even financed the film himself when no studio would greenlight it.  Sure he was reimbursed when the film took off but regardless, that shows devotion, and that devotion is what helped bring his performance to new life.Consider me a believer.",5,"Praise Jesus, Duvall delivers on every front one of the most intriguing character studies in recent years...",1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,3747,"['ever', 'was', 'movie', 'relied', 'so', 'much', 'single', 'performance', 'reach', 'greatness', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'Apostle', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'camp', 'had', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'performance', 'been', 'off', 'key', 'can', 'praise', 'Jesus', 'ha', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'invested', 'heart', 'soul', 'amazingly', 'spirited', 'performance', 'Sonny', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'man', 'role', 'career', 'brilliantly', 'controlled', 'emotionally', 'fleshed', 'out', 'performance', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'Duvall', 'felt', 'was', 'overrated', 'actor', 'funny', 'best', 'friend', 'up', 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'just', 'never', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'now', 'get', 'least', 'now', 'realize', 'when', 'good', 'pretty', 'darn', 'perfect.In', 'Apostle', 'meet', 'Sonny', 'charismatic', 'somewhat', 'obsessive', 'Texas', 'preacher', 'who', 'driven', 'wife', 'away', 'due', 'philandering', 'ways', 'watch', 'life', 'fall', 'apart', 'wife', 'man', 'youth', 'minister', 'taking', 'children', 'eventually', 'church', 'away', 'fit', 'rage', 'Sonny', 'wife', 'lover', 'baseball', 'bat', 'sending', 'coma', 'forcing', 'Sonny', 'leave', 'town', 'Sonny', 'up', 'Bayou', 'Boutte', 'Louisiana', 'small', 'town', 'soak', 'up', 'eccentric', 'style', 'Claiming', 'lord', 'sent', 'Sonny', 'persona', 'Apostle', 'E.F.', 'build', 'church', 'ground', 'up', 'enlisting', 'help', 'former', 'minister', 'area', 'move', 'forward', 'life', 'corralling', 'community', 'together', 'lord', 'work', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'strike', 'relationship', 'sorts', 'young', 'woman', 'town', 'past', 'though', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'buried', 'forever', 'condition', 'wife', 'lover', 'intensity', 'find', 'charge', 'Sonny', 'increases.The', 'supporting', 'players', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'least', 'decent', 'one', 'really', 'given', 'limelight', 'aside', 'Duvall', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'fine', 'job', 'Sonny', 'ex-wife', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'excellent', 'job', 'local', 'troublemaker', 'destroy', 'Sonny', 'newfound', 'church', 'given', 'more', 'passing', 'glance', 'screen', 'time', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'deliciously', 'effective', 'Sonny', 'ailing', 'mother', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'whole', 'supporting', 'cast', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'critics', 'appeared', 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'childish', 'performance', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'John', 'Beasley', 'fine', 'job', 'Blackwell', 'minister', 'who', 'Sonny', 'helping', 'hand', 'Rick', 'Dial', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'are', 'well', 'used', 'townsfolk', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'Sonny.Really', 'actor', 'here', 'mention', 'more', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'performance', 'downright', 'perfection', 'fact', 'played', 'other', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'failure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'film', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'laugh', 'riot', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'subject', 'matter', 'bible', 'thumping', 'extremists', 'Duvall', 'so', 'serious', 'so', 'devoted', 'so', 'convincing', 'keep', 'dramatic', 'tones', 'film', 'deliver', 'well', 'constructed', 'effortlessly', 'mesmerizing', 'portrayal', 'performance', 'won', 'kinds', 'critics', 'awards', 'quite', 'frankly', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Apostle', 'was', 'truly', 'labor', 'love', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'even', 'financed', 'film', 'when', 'studio', 'would', 'greenlight', 'Sure', 'was', 'reimbursed', 'when', 'film', 'took', 'off', 'regardless', 'devotion', 'devotion', 'what', 'helped', 'bring', 'performance', 'new', 'life.Consider', 'believer']",N/A

Not saying that some  of the things the character did were to be emulated. But Duvall saw that a  Christian is a real person that has to confront all the issues and baggage  that anyone else does.  He was able to master that perfectly in the  southern Pentecostal preacher.I figured when even Billy Graham said he  had seen this one twice-- that was a good enough recommendation for  me!Here in Portland, I saw The Apostle at one of the &quot;arts&quot;  theaters.  You have to understand that Portland is &quot;not&quot; your  typical bastion of conservatism or a Bible Belt area by any means.  The  audience was totally captivated.  The final scenes as Duvall is led away  found the entire theater absolutely silent.

Recently, I was encouraging someone to see it, and then I thought that I'd see it again myself. I think I loved it more than when I saw it the first time (if that's even possible). This is obviously Robert Duvall's ""baby"", as he poured so much of his time, money and energy into this compelling film. His acting is so superb, I'm inclined to wonder if he's ever been a pentecostal preacher at any point in his life. Seriously, though, the film takes a close look at the life of Sonny (a.k.a. the Apostle ""EF"") and all the issues he's faced with as a man of God. Indeed, he is a man of God, filled with unimagineable passion and zeal for God...but his life is troubled with his own fleshly weaknesses, and those of his wife, as well...Even in spite of all he deals with, all the dilemmas he must face, and all the places he must run to hide from the inevitable, what most impresses me about this movie is this man's honesty with God. He would yell at God, question God, but never did he hold back with God, and I think this is how he learned to develop the deep intimacy he shared with God...it was this intimacy that shaped his life, his love and passion...This is an excellent movie YOU MUST SEE...finally a Christian man is represented as a REAL person...not corny, not wimpy, but real, with real issues and real emotions, but living in relationship with a very REAL God that he turns to time and time again...This movie is not ""religious"" in the way you may be inclined to think, so don't shrink away from it if you don't consider yourself a ""religious"" person...enjoy the unfolding of his tale and the peeling away of his layers...I am amazed at the influence this man had in the lives of nearly everyone he met...however brief the encounter, he had real impact --- very impressive stuff.

Once you watch this one, you'll never forget it. I watched it about 5 years ago and it is still as clear as the day I watched it. As a conservative Christian, I do not subscribe at all to the pentecostal faith or their worship practices, but the portrayal of all these things in this movie is very realistic, regardless of how you view these matters.As a movie, this is a brilliant work; as for the acting, Duvall's performance defies description. A quick scan of the reviews here will give you the picture.This is undoubtedly one of those ""love it"" or ""hate it"" movies. As a movie, I loved it, but it probably has to be understood to be loved, otherwise it may completely miss you and you will find yourself scratching your head.I have read some of the reviews and found a little of what I was afraid I would find, i.e. those attempting to either evaluate this as a ""Christian"" movie, or those using it to disparage Christianity. This is misguided. There is no attempt at Biblical teaching in this movie nor any attempt at a political message. This movie is portraying a man and his journey.When the movie opens with the holiness service where they are all shouting and screaming Jesus' name, it nearly turned me off about the whole movie, and I am sure there were many who saw this and were tainted from that point on, I nearly was.  Again, however, this is probably a pretty realistic portrayal of the pentecostal holiness worship. In any event, this part is soon over and the movie really begins after that.I was born in the ""north"" and still have much family that are Yankees, and I know pretty much what they believe and how they think. I have also lived in the south most of my life, part of this time in the deep south, and I have seen firsthand the differences in cultural beliefs and attitude between the two parts of our country. I have also seen the religious differences between the 2 as well. And frankly, as others have said, you must have some understanding of the local setting, including this particular aspect of the pentecostal religion before you can fully appreciate this movie and Duvall's character. For what it depicts, this movie is as real and accurate as it gets. Again, however, the Pentecostal religion is just the setting, not the main plot.Duvall's performance is beyond words so I will not attempt to describe it, except to say that despite my comments about knowing the setting and understanding the culture in the movie, if you appreciate good movies and good performances, you shouldn't miss this.",5,As a movie....Brilliant.,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2671,"['most', 'movies', 'watch', 'say', 'myself', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'never', 'think', 'again', 'movie', 'Once', 'watch', 'one', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'watched', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'as', 'clear', 'day', 'watched', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'do', 'not', 'subscribe', 'pentecostal', 'faith', 'worship', 'practices', 'portrayal', 'things', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'regardless', 'how', 'view', 'matters.As', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'work', 'acting', 'Duvall', 'performance', 'defies', 'description', 'quick', 'scan', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'give', 'picture.This', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'love', 'hate', 'movies', 'movie', 'loved', 'probably', 'be', 'understood', 'be', 'loved', 'otherwise', 'may', 'completely', 'miss', 'will', 'find', 'scratching', 'head.I', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'found', 'little', 'what', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'find', 'i.e', 'attempting', 'evaluate', 'Christian', 'movie', 'using', 'disparage', 'Christianity', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'Biblical', 'teaching', 'movie', 'attempt', 'political', 'message', 'movie', 'portraying', 'man', 'journey.When', 'movie', 'holiness', 'service', 'where', 'are', 'shouting', 'screaming', 'Jesus', 'name', 'nearly', 'turned', 'off', 'whole', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'many', 'who', 'saw', 'were', 'tainted', 'point', 'nearly', 'was', 'Again', 'however', 'probably', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'pentecostal', 'holiness', 'worship', 'event', 'part', 'soon', 'movie', 'really', 'that.I', 'was', 'born', 'north', 'still', 'have', 'much', 'family', 'are', 'Yankees', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'believe', 'how', 'think', 'have', 'also', 'lived', 'south', 'most', 'life', 'part', 'time', 'deep', 'south', 'have', 'seen', 'firsthand', 'differences', 'cultural', 'beliefs', 'attitude', 'two', 'parts', 'country', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'religious', 'differences', '2', 'as', 'well', 'frankly', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'must', 'have', 'understanding', 'local', 'setting', 'including', 'particular', 'aspect', 'pentecostal', 'religion', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Duvall', 'character', 'what', 'movie', 'real', 'accurate', 'Again', 'however', 'Pentecostal', 'religion', 'just', 'setting', 'not', 'main', 'plot.Duvall', 'performance', 'words', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'attempt', 'describe', 'say', 'comments', 'knowing', 'setting', 'understanding', 'culture', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'good', 'movies', 'good', 'performances', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A
58583,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,0783227426,Buenoslibros.es,"[9, 9]","What a passion for Christ!As they say in ""The making of the Apostle"": Sometimes we didn't know if they were acting or it was real. I don't think there can be a more honest approach to the work of Christian evangelizers in American film history. Simply put, it's a great film, very emotional, very spiritual, and very human. Robert Duvall plays a Texas preacher whose wife cheats on him and fills for divorce. Then she even takes away his church from him (I didn't understand how that happened, though). The course of events sets him on a journey to meet his fate, which is no other than to continue giving out the Word in the holy name of Jesus.Duvall plays an honest and true Christian preacher, but at the same time a very real man, with his own flaws and temptations. Eliminating the darker side of this man from the story, I think, wouldn't have paid a better tribute to truth, not would it have made a better film. The important thing that comes up here is the honesty (the reality) of Christian worship. There is no mockery of Christians. There is no intention to evangelize either. This is not a Christian film; it is a film about Christians, true Christians, spirit filled followers of Christ.Even if non believers can't find anything here to move them closer to the Lord, at least they will have an insider's view of a Spirit filled church. So many people are put off by religion, but this is not about religion, as you see in liberal churches, this is the real Thing. All the characters are played superbly.

As it turns out. ""Sonny"" (Robert Duvall), winds up starting a rural church from scratch in a small town in Louisiana, and, what happens after that I won't say, but it's interestng.Duvall gives a tremendous acting performance in here, one of the best I've seen on film. He dominates the picture from start-to-finish. There are some good messages in here, too.By the why, I don't know ANY minister (or priest) who would do all the bad things you see in this movie,  including his wife and youth minister, but it makes for a good story, film-wise.  To those anti-church readers out there, I'm sorry but this is not the way it is, by any means.Yet, despite all that, this is not your typical anti-Christian film ,which is why no major studio would fund this movie. Duvall had to put his own money into this. Hollywood didn't want to back a film in which ""people being saved"" means a great deal. There even s a dramatic conversion scene with Billy Bob Thornton, of all people! Hey, with God all things are possible.The more I watch this movie, the more I appreciate the cinematography in here. I enjoyed the music, too. This is a strange film full of ""good"" and ""bad"" people and their actions and a movie, I suspect, people would either love or hate.

58588,A1NGQO4GRYYNC1,0783227426,"Dan E. Nicholas ""gotta have a book""","[1, 1]","Duvall's work, The Apostle, was an art vision love child of his for decades.  He first got the vision to write, produce, direct and star in this story from a church visit on a research trip to the south, to a little town and church in Hughes, Arkansas in the 60s.  The 1998 work, The Apostle (Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton) is similar to his 2011 Get Low, also a story which takes place in the south. He told Christianity Today in a interview in the summer of 2010 that The Apostle was a piece of Americana that Hollywood would never be able to tell without making fun of the Pentecostal and Holiness faith practice of the southern states.In my faith practice, preparation and contemplation of death--finishing well--is something you do from your Baptism forward.  Duvall gets this, states his faith in what he brings to both Felix Bush which he plays in Get Low, and Sonny, who he plays here in The Apostle, a flawed but passionate preacher on his road with God.  Both are well written and are neither feel good or feel bad flicks.  But they will get you thinking.  These are not films you soon put out of your mind.The old cliche from WWII is that no atheist can be found in a foxhole.  Duvall is now 82 years old and his foxhole is closing in no doubt.  Yet he has three film projects he's working on.  Got to love that.  Facing age, mortality, death; yet all full of life.  My kind of man. I've liked the heart and soul Duvall brings to his characters ever since he played Gus McCrae in Lonesome Dove, a role he says remains his career favorite.  He puts his faith in his work and yet does not look for a ""message"" to portray.I loved the part where he wakes the neighborhood praying angrily to God while living with his mom,estranged from his wife and kids.  And where his mom, played by June Carter Cash a few years before her death, takes a phone call from a perturbed neighbor, asking her son to pray more quietly.  Wonderful stuff.  I also loved a warm ecumenical moment I found dear in a place in The Apostle where Duvall's character looks at a Catholic priest up river, blessing a small flotilla of boats with holy water as they make their way down in a church ceremony.  In reference to the priest, Sonny is a bit amused at the shaking of holy water on the people, which he finds odd.  Yet he says out loud to himself as a prayer, ""You get it done your way.  I get it done mine.""  Several pithy lines like that make for a wonderful screen play and writing by Duvall, a man who obviously walks with God.Another favorite scene that says a lot about the writer/director/producer/main actor: when Sonny does a Protestant version of Last Rights for a dying man in a car accident by the side of the road.  Amazing, especially the part where he gently boots the cop away behind him while staying focused on finishing his pastoral prayer for the boy on the edge of eternity before his eyes.  And the cop seem to understand, boot and all.Finish well.  It's important.  Work toward this goal in the best humanity you can muster.  This seems to be what both these movies--The Apostle and Get Low--are saying without directly trying to saying anything; which I liked as much as the movie.I'll not soon forget this flick.  I didn't expect to like it as I'm not warm to the theology of the Pentecostal South.  But specific theology is not the point of these films.

Duvall's performance as Pentecostal preacher &quot;Sonny&quot; Dewey is unforced and subtle (unjustly denied Best Actor at the Oscars).  He refuses to condescend or stereotype.  Most of the extras were cast from the southern churches he studied; the result is an honesty and energy almost unheard of in portrayals of religion in film.

58595,A1OBM38R2NOIR7,0783227426,Doris Morgan,"[13, 15]","The Apostle (1997)Robert Duvall, well known for his charismatic character Gus in Lonesome Dove, both stars in and directs this film.  He plays the charismatic character of a minister named  Sonny, who later renames himself through the sacrament of baptism: The Apostle E.F.  The baptism through a rite of the church which should be attended by others is self-administered with only nature attending the event.  The baptism does not change all of Sonny's ways and neither does his name change. It does however allow him to follow and live out his calling to evangelize for a time as an apostle; one called by God to do a specific vocation in the church, or in this case outside the established church.  Like others in our society who have deluded themselves into the belief that by changing their name and geographical location they can escape justice for acts committed against the law and society.  But eventually when the past catches up with them, as it does with E.F., then justice prevails.A question that comes to mind is who pays or who is to blame?  Is society to blame?  Or are the constructs within society the culprit?  There are usually two sides, if not more to every action.  What Duvall accurately portrays in this film is that the double standard of the patriarchal system is still very much alive.  His charismatic style which attracts others to worship at church is also used in another way in his home.  His wife Jessie Dewey (Farrah Fawcett) knows his style of manipulation quite well as she refuses to pray with him when he asks, begs, and then orders her to.  She resists thus asserting her independence from him.  She is no longer a victim to and of his charm and charismatic ways.  Thus the stage is set for his later behavior; drunkenness and jealous action.  He tries to take by violence what he believes is his, by right of marriage; his wife and children.  The act that he commits causes him to go into hiding, by running and covering up his identity.  Yet his conscious gets to him, as he calls a friend several times to check on conditions at home.  During this time of self-imposed exile he has no contact with his former life except through calls he makes to a friend.  This friend informs him of two deaths; that of his former youth pastor and his (Sonny's) mother.  The self-imposed exile cut Sonny off from his mother, to whom he was deeply devoted.What caught my voyeur's eye is that Duvall successfully brought belief and faith to the film.  Faith and belief in something outside of one's self will sustain and nourish a person; whether it be a relationship with a friend or God.

Sonny proved this as his alter ego E.F. brought a caring sense of community to a depressed people, which helped them to restore and renew their own sense of worth, and relationship to God.

But I saw nothing in the film worthy of the truth in Christ.  What I saw was a representation of a gospel aimed at sensual gratification in the name of the Lord.  A gospel that avoided entirely any exploration of the spiritual message of the Bible!  Although I am not surprised really that people loved this movie, it does however sadden me greatly that so many actually see an ""honest"" representation of the gospel! Because all I saw was a slice of some of the very worst of Christendom!  Sensual gratification without confronting the truth which is that a person can not do ANYTHING to obtain the mercy of God except that a person might be humbled by God to plead for mercy and might be humbled to seek Him with a broken a heart and might by the sovereign will of God be granted wisdom and knowledge of the truth in the The Lord Jesus Christ according to the Bible ALONE and in it's entirety.  But that is not something given to showing in movies I think  Understanding that I really don't know why I bothered to watch it even...I don't know what I thought might come of it and it made me curious what on earth they could come up with so far as showing the viewers some interesting perspective.  All I saw was a bunch of deceived people encouraging themselves amongst themselves that they had things right and the profile of one more sinful man at a loss to make sense of his faith and Hypocrisy while seeming to force it on God as good enough as in ""this is what I believe Lord, it is right and thank you that it is right"" Is that humility?  Is it not only pride?  Can we have any confidence in our best thinking?  Or at the end end of day is not vanity?  But what do I know? Let God be true and every man a liar.  Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean NOT on thine own understanding.  Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.

I could never tell if Sonny was a genuinely God-touched person, or a gifted man making a place for himself in the world through preaching. No single incident in the story played it one way or another. He unquestionably had a gift in bringing people together, giving them purpose and redemption. But he also did some bad things, including (but not the worst), hiding the truth of what he'd done from his congregation. This piece was shown through the character of a young mechanic who overheard Sonny's story as he told it to another preacher, to fairly devastating effect. Every actor's portrayal was great, Duvall's most of all. It asks questions - what does it mean to be human, to suffer, to want, to hurt others, to be well, to be loved, to be in community?

I'm not sure that I have ever seen one in real life, but if they turn out to be anything like Robert Duvall's character Sonny in ""The Apostle,"" then I'd turn around and run faster than if it were a Southern Baptist. Duvall's performance as on over-the-top Texas preacher and self-baptised apostle of God is fantastic; the best scenes of the film are those in which he is given (or gives himself, I suppose) free reign to go Hallelujah-crazy, Thank You Jesus. However, taking out those great parts, there's not all that much left to the film to really make it all that good.When I think of Texas, I think of three things: President Bush, Lyle Lovett, and crazy preachers. This film's got two of the three, which ain't bad. (No, Lyle doesn't show up; he provides the exit music). Duvall runs a decent-sized parish but is driven out but some parishoners due to his questionable moral actions (his ""wandering eye""). You think ""Too bad for Sonny,"" then, Woops! ....From there, it's your classic redemption story. Sonny wants to be saved, and he succeeds. It's a riveting character study, although it's neither illuminating nor unpredictable. The supporting cast is a trifle curious, as the noteworthy performers (Farrah Fawcett, Miranda Richardson, and the auspisiously endearing Billy Bob Thornton) are all given lackluster roles. It's the unknowns who are the ones with performances worthy of sharing the stage with Duvall, specifically Walt Goggins as the Iscariot-esque Sam, and John Beasley as the former preacher of Sonny's new ministry.Maybe it's an unfair overstatement to say that the plot is useless, but I'm not so sure that Duvall wouldn't have been better off just filming himself preaching than trying to build a story around it.

Films that show the complexities of faith really scare Hollywood and the left, as they dismiss anyone of the Chrisitian faith as a right winger hater.  While many calling themselves Christians (preachers of the ilk of Falwell and James Dobson) embrace the ""god hates fags and abortions"" line (and ignore everything else in the gospel), they do so simply to attain political power more than anything else, and have no real desire to help their fellow man spiritually.

Duvall's character E.F., a supposed preacher, goes around the whole movie having to say 'Jesus' and 'God' in ever sentence, and constantly quoting from the bible, and then kills a man, abuses his wife, and other very non-Christian activities. After a while, it just becomes painful to watch, and E.F. just becomes a joke- I just started laughing at a lot of the movie and how ridiculous it became. I will say that at least this is probably one of the more realistic portrayals of a religious fanatic I've seen- the typical 'Do as I say, not as I do' type of Christian you see on the news every night.

I think it's mainly because The Apostle shows the bitter truth behind the men and women who serve God. This film is not apologetic or remotely reverent; it is brutally honest and actually, when considered closely, quite refreshing.Rovert Duvall, in a role that was destined for him, plays the part of a eccentric preacher who is running from his problems. His problems, and there are many, force him to leave his mega-church and flee from police. His actions - which I won't spoil - are shocking but somewhat justifiable.When out of town, the Apostle begins a multi-racial church in the deep south, cutting cross dividing lines while vigorously regaining his passion for the Lord. In it is in these moments, when he confronts his own lusts and fears, that the character of the Apostle shines through in honest, heart-bursting segments. He is a broken man, but still a man of God, just as many of the men and women of the Bible are. Bruised, battered, yet still willing. That's what I loved about this film. It is a true depiction of people who follow Jesus. We have misgivings, tempers, pride and lusts, yet, when it's all said and done, we can still move on.There is one segment, when a racist bigot - played handsomely by Billy Bob Thorton -threatens to tear down the mult-racial church. The scene ends with Thorton's exclusionary character on his knees in deep remorse and weeping for forgiveness. It's a beautiful thing to behold.This film is ruggedly honest and will make the pious and self-righteous crowd cringe with prudent dissaproval.

Unlike many movies that  revolve around religion or religious themes, this did not feel like one  that &quot;preaches&quot; to you, nor is it one that parodies or trashes  religion. That in and of itself is remarkable in movies today, and I give  Mr. Duvall enormous credit for achieving that in his writing and directing.  Quite simply, it was a movie where an actor - Duvall - literally mesmerized  you, and one that just sticks with you for a few days after watching it.  Mr. Duvall has the ability to play a role in such a way as to make you  truly believe that he is that person, whether it be the gung-ho leader of a  air cav unit, a country singer, or, in this case, a preacher. Not all  actors can pull it off as deftly or as superbly as he can. Mr. Duvall's  performance should have won him the Oscar. He was up against Jack Nicholson  (for &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;) that year, but after seeing that movie  and &quot;The Apostle&quot;, there is no question in my mind that the Oscar  voters got it wrong.

As the story progresses, we also see that a preacher is just as human as we all are, with our similar quirks, weaknesses, and temptations, along with - sometimes - astounding strengths.

However, I was very, very wrong.""The Apostle"" is one of the the best films I have seen. When I started watching it, I thought I might be disappointed. I was not. I have enjoyed the other films I have seen Robert Duvall in, but this was his best performance of all. He brilliantly captured the part of the the charismatic, Southern preacher. I have seen preachers like that in person, and there were times we felt were in church, or seeing them on television. We had to remember we were watching a movie.The thing about this film that appeals to me most is how Sonny is a man who really loves the Lord. However, he is not perfect, nor does he pretend to be. So many of we Christians can be so arrogant, thinking we are above everyone else, it is an annoying turn-off. He has cheated on his wife, and kills her lover by beating him with a baseball bat in a fit of anger. He is kicked out of his church. He even lashes out at God when his wife leaves him. It is a very realistic portrayal of a man who has deeply rooted issues, yet at the same time, he is still a Christian. It shows you do not have to be perfect to serve God, and to love Him. This movie does not belittle or disrespect Christianity. It makes it real and honest.After Sonny's attack on his wife's lover, he flees to a small town in Louisiana, where he decides to start his life over. He baptizes himself again, declares himself an apostle, and takes on the name ""The Apostle E.F."" He founds a new church, which starts off very small, then quickly grows into a larger, racially-diverse congregation. It is a close-knit group. Unfortunately, Sonny's ex-wife hears him on the radio, and contacts the local authorities. One night, after a touching, uplifting sermon, he is arrested for murder. He embraces some of the members, as they sing. He then walks out of the church, and surrenders to the police, relinquishing his jewelry to be sold for the benefit of the church. In prison, he is still preaching the gospel, and influencing the other inmates.The rest of the cast includes Farrah Fawcett, as Sonny's ex-wife Jessie, June Carter-Cash as Sonny's mother, John Beasley as Brother C. Charles Blackwell, the man he builds his new church with, and Billy Bob Thornton as a racist troublemaker who initially comes to the church to start trouble, but is converted by Sonny in the end.I have quite a few favorite movies.

With my first viewing, I wasn't able to give this film full attention, and this really is a film that demands ones attention, for its nuances of character and flavor. In other words, this is not a plot film - it is a film about character, local color, and a drama so 'under the surface' that if you're not careful, you'll miss it entirely. So this time, I watched with care and I loved every sweet minute. That's why I give it a 5, rather than a 2.Sonny, a traveling preacher based in Texas, hasn't been the greatest of husbands and hasn't the greatest of wives. Before you know it, he discover's that his wife is seeing someone else, and want's him gone. What happens next, I won't say, except to tell you that now, Sonny is running not only from his past but from the law as well. Starting anew in Bayou Boutte, Louisiana, we watch Sonny build a small new congregation from the ground up with pure determination and a drive that is made all the more intense by guilt. Sonny, now called &quot;The Apostle E.F.&quot; knows it is only a matter of time before his past and the law catch him, and he is intent on making every minute count. Has he succeeded?What makes this picture shine is not plot or action, but characters and flavor. Duvall is quite simply one of the best there is and he (as writer, director, and actor) brings out the true subtle beauty in the character, his spirit, and the music that is country preaching (we get quite a few extended sermons and even to a non-believer like me, they are riveting).What's more, Duvall went out of his way to cast mostly non-actors and becasue of that, the flavor of Bayou Boutte and the life of a country congregation really shines. Except for Duvall and Beasley, all of the preachers, even, are not only real preachers, but are giving real sermons.

He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers.Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful.  He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras.  Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times.  As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired.While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me:  Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former ""Angel"" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane.  June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting.  And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature.The term ""tour de force"" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable.  Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly ""the Apostle"" is.

I would prefer to have lived in Afghanistan under the Taliban than in the communities depicted herein. I say this to clarify that I came to this film with a great deal of disgust and hostility toward the subject matter.So it's to Duvall's credit that his presentation appealed to me in its honesty and complexity. &#34;Sonny&#34; is not an angel, but neither is he a psychotic religious fanatic as several other recent films and television shows have employed as a cheap villain. Through his many shortcomings, including murderous rage, Sonny is always, and sincerely, trying to do better, and trying to help those around him do better. Of course his faith is simplistic and absolutist - his personality requires simple and absolute rules to keep his rage under control. One can only imagine what he would have been like without the modifying influence of religion; probably a hitman or a mob enforcer.

58622,A2VMVTDYQDA6L8,0783227426,Laura Knight-Jadczyk,"[8, 35]","I don't think I've ever seen a clearer portrayal of the charismatic psychopath than Robert Duvall playing the part of Euliss ""Sonny"" Dewey.  Do not think that psychopaths are mad-dog killers - only very few are and they could be considered ""unsuccessful"" psychopaths.Some people think that psychopathy is the result of some attachment or bonding difficulty as an infant but psychopathy expert, Dr. Robert Hare, has turned the idea around.  After all his years digging into the background of psychopaths. He says:""In some children the very failure to bond is a symptom of psychopathy. It is likely that these children lack the capacity to bond readily, and that their lack of attachment is largely the result, not the cause, of psychopathy.""Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among UsIn other words: they are born that way and you can't fix them.The differences in how psychopathy manifests does have to do with family background, however.  How one is raised determines how the psychopath expresses himself in life.A psychopath who grows up in a stable family and has access to positive social and educational resources might become a white-collar criminal, or perhaps a somewhat shady entrepreneur, preacher, politician, lawyer, judge, or other professional. Another individual with the same traits, and a deprived background might become a common con-artist, a drifter, mercenary, or violent criminal.A psychopath born into a very religious background, having the early experiences with evangelism that are depicted in the movie, would very likely grow up to be exactly as Sonny is portrayed.The point is, social factors and parenting practices only shape the expression of the disorder, but have no effect on the individual's inability to feel empathy or to develop a conscience.All of these issues are depicted in this movie: Sonny is traveling most of the time and often cheats on his wife, but considers himself to be basically a ""good guy.""  His mother falls on the floor in a weak spell and he just walks out the door and says he'll see her in a few weeks. His barely controlled aggression against his wife when he discovers that she is cheating while he's on the road (also cheating, as he admits), and later when they discuss the break-up of their marriage, finally culminating in a violent break-out where he scares the bejeebies out of everybody by going berserk at a kid's softball game, inflicting a fatal injury on his wife's boyfriend, are all clues to the seething selfishness that drives Sonny.Sonny also exhibits what psychopaths DO have that is truly outstanding: an ability to give their undivided attention to something that interests them intensely right now or in terms of setting up a situation where they have power and authority over others.  Some clinicians have compared this to the concentration with which a predator stalks his prey.  This quality is abundantly evident in Sonny's drive to preach, to ""have a church,"" and the work he is willing to put into acquiring that status.The qualities of the psychopath are also on display in Sonny's talents as a preacher with a mastery of hypnotic techniques. Psychopaths are naturally interesting as all get out - even exciting! They exude a captivating energy that keeps their listeners on the edge of their seats (and they talk a LOT!). Even if some part of the normal person is shocked or repelled by what the psychopath says or does, they are like the mouse hypnotized by the torturing cat. Even if they have the chance to run away, they don't.  This is evident in the movie in Toosie's fascination for Sonny even though she is also repelled by him.Many Psychopaths ""make their living"" by using charm, deceit, and manipulation to gain the confidence of their victims. You see that clearly when Sonny travels to Bayou Boutte and tells an out and out lie to Rev. Blackwell that ""God sent me to fellowship with you.""  The viewer knows that he learned about Rev. Blackwell from his cousin whom Sonny met while on the run from his criminally violent behavior. In fact, this scene is the dead giveaway that we are watching a psychopath in action.  With all his praying, self-baptizing, Bible reading and thumping, and assorted other self-righteous activities, Sonny sits there and tells a bald-faced lie to another minister and ascribes it to God. (Well, he probably convinced him that it WAS God, that this was how God directed him, but that's really stretching it.)The fact is, many psychopaths can be found in white collar professions where they are aided in their evil by the fact that most people expect certain classes of people to be trustworthy because of their social or professional credentials. Preachers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, politicians, psychiatrists and psychologists, generally do not have to earn our trust because they have it by virtue of their positions. But the fact is: psychopaths are found in such lofty spheres also, and more often than most people suppose!At the same time, psychopaths are good imposters. They have absolutely no hesitation about forging and brazenly using impressive credentials to adopt professional roles that bring prestige and power. They pick professions in which the requisite skills are easy to fake, the jargon is easy to learn, and the credentials are unlikely to be thoroughly checked. Psychopaths find it extremely easy to pose as financial consultants, ministers, psychological counselors and psychologists. It may even be due to the fact that the science of psychology is infested with psychopaths that truly helpful research on psychopathy is never funded despite the fact that psychopaths cause more damage to society than any other psychological problem.  This film is an example of that very sort of damage.  Multiplied millions of U.S. citizens are subjected to this kind of hypnosis/evangelism which twists and warps their minds.Another clue to the reality of Sonny Dewey is that psychopaths make their way by conning people into doing things for them; obtaining money for them, prestige, power, or even standing up for them when others try to expose them. That's what they do and they do it very well as Sonny demonstrates with just about everyone he comes in contact with. What's more, the job is very easy because most people are gullible with an unshakable belief in the inherent goodness of man.Manipulation is the key to the psychopath's conquests. They will feign false emotions to create empathy, and many of them study the tricks that can be employed by the empathy technique. Psychopaths are often able to incite pity from people because they seem like ""lost souls"" as Guggenbuhl-Craig writes. So the pity factor is one reason why victims often fall for these ""poor"" people.One of the chief ways psychopaths prey on others is to make use of the normal person's need to find meaning or purpose in life. They will pose as preachers, grief counselors, or ""experts"" of various sorts that attract followings of people who are looking for answers. They are masters of recognizing ""hang-ups"" and self-doubts that most people have, and they will brazenly pander to them to gain a follower to use later.This is what Sonny was doing, and doing masterfully with the character played by Billy-Bob Thornton.It is that kind of mind that we are dealing with when we consider such as Euliss ""Sonny"" Dewey and his ilk, and the millions upon millions of people that follow them and become their armies of hate in the guise of ""brotherly love.""Definitely get this movie and watch it for the simple reason that you need to know about psychopaths, how they operate, and how to spot them and you need to teach it to your children.Besides, it is a darn good movie and VERY well done!  I grew up in the deep South and I KNOW people like that; heck, I have some in my family! The film characterizations are brilliant and nothing is exaggerated; it could almost be a documentary!I'd give it six stars if I could!",5,Psychopathy in Action,1178582400,"05 8,

58623,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0783227426,Linda Linguvic,"[9, 9]","Until now, my view of Pentecostal churches in the South has been rooted in films such as Elmer Gantry and newsreels of right-to-lifers demonstrating outside of abortion clinics. Southern preachers are always depicted as charlatans and narrow-minded bigots with an intelligence level way below that of human beings. This film breaks that pattern and explodes all those assumptions with startling authenticity. Robert Duval, in a truly magnificent performance, plays one of those preachers. Jesus and the Church are part of his life and, in the first scene, he stops his car at an highway accident and gives comfort to a seriously injured young man. Later, he and his mother sing hymns in the car and there is a loving domestic scene with his wife, played by Farrah Fawcett, and his two children. His marriage, however, is on the rocks, and he commits a passionate act of violence. Now he has to run.He runs then, and, when he gets into a slight accident and his car gets sunk in the river, he emerges with nothing but a small briefcase and the clothes on his back. All this time he is praying to Jesus and the praying is real. I could, myself, sense the man's torment and his struggles with himself. He meets an old crippled black man fishing in a river who gives him food and shelter and eventually he finds out that there is a small town in Louisiana in need of a preacher. He travels to the town and hooks up with an elderly black preacher to build a church. And build a church he does. He takes low paying jobs selling ice cream, working at a diner as a short order cook, working in a gas station to raise money. There is an old church building to rebuild and people in the town help paint and make repairs, and he goes on the local radio station and recruits rarishioners. Lately I read a long article about Pentecostal churches and how they are truly integrated in ways that churches in the South have not seen before. This is clearly demonstrated in the movie and the congregants who are not professional actors give a meaningful and honest picture of the way it really is.I understand now how much meaning the church has in these people's lives. It gives them hope and joy and a way to dance and sing and come together. Going to church is like going to a big party where a catharsis of emotion uplifts the spirit and refreshes the soul. When a town racist and bully comes to destroy the church with a bulldozer, in a complex scene in which good and evil are pitted against each other, good eventually wins out and the bully converts. Robert Duval sees himself as a sinner who can therefore help others because he understands the nature of sin. His mother is dying and he cannot go home. He still thinks of his wife and his children. But he tries to court Miranda Richardson, a member of the congregation, who is separated from her husband.

58625,A1CROFPEPYNIZK,0783227426,LKayH,"[21, 21]","A lot of people misunderstand this film because the title character is a mess, and they see it as a movie about Christian hypocrisy.  But I think there's a deeper point to it.  It is about a very flawed preacher, a man who cheats on his wife, who is violent, who blows it in a big way and then tries to reform himself.  But as soon as temptation comes, he's right back to his old ways again.Then very subtly, a pattern begins to emerge.  Through various circumstances, the man begins to recognize the consequences of his actions, and he begins to have a HEART change that accomplishes in him that reformation he was looking for.  He sees a woman he was trying to seduce in the context of her family -- a family that looks very much like his own -- and his response tells us that his womanizing days are over.  The first time he encounters an adversary, he beats the man into submission. The second time, he shows compassion, and the results are miraculous.  Gradually, the man is led to a place of true repentance, a point of willingness to accept responsibility for his actions, and then, finally, he finds himself in a place where God can REALLY use his gift of ministry.  It's subtle, just as God's work in real life is subtle, but those who know how God works will appreciate seeing this portrayal of the way he moves in the lives of men.The movie was written, funded and produced by Robert Duvall, who as far as I know is not a Christian. He places his story in a Southern-style Pentecostal/Holiness church, so there are a few controversial issues, such as the ongoing ministry of apostles.  But it's not trying to sell that particular theology so much as portray it in the context of the story.  The movie stars people like June Carter Cash, and many of the extras were real preachers and worshippers in churches across the South.My favorite scene is one where the man is pacing his bedroom in the middle of the night yelling at God because things aren't going the way he'd like.  There's a powerful intimacy in that moment, the guy isn't just folding his hands and saying an &quot;If it be thy will&quot; prayer that he doesn't really feel.  He's laying his heart out before God and confessing his anger. That is REAL prayer, the kind that changes lives, because when we stop hiding our hearts and open up to him, that's when he can really begin to work in us.As a Christian and a movie fan, I rate this movie five out of five.  Yes, there are some flaws, but the quality of the writing, the acting, and production are awesome for an independent film, and if the message is a little too subtle for some, well, God's message never does pound people over the head.",5,Grace At Work,1037145600,"11 13, 2002",2002,2669,"['lot', 'people', 'misunderstand', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'mess', 'see', 'movie', 'Christian', 'hypocrisy', 'think', 'deeper', 'point', 'very', 'flawed', 'preacher', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'who', 'violent', 'who', 'big', 'way', 'then', 'tries', 'reform', 'as', 'soon', 'temptation', 'right', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'again.Then', 'very', 'subtly', 'pattern', 'emerge', 'various', 'circumstances', 'man', 'recognize', 'consequences', 'actions', 'have', 'HEART', 'change', 'reformation', 'was', 'looking', 'woman', 'was', 'trying', 'seduce', 'context', 'family', 'family', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'response', 'womanizing', 'days', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'adversary', 'man', 'submission', 'second', 'time', 'compassion', 'results', 'are', 'miraculous', 'Gradually', 'man', 'led', 'place', 'true', 'repentance', 'point', 'willingness', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'then', 'finally', 'place', 'where', 'God', 'can', 'REALLY', 'use', 'gift', 'ministry', 'subtle', 'just', 'God', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'subtle', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'God', 'will', 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'portrayal', 'way', 'lives', 'men.The', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'funded', 'produced', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'not', 'Christian', 'story', 'Southern-style', 'Pentecostal/Holiness', 'church', 'are', 'few', 'controversial', 'issues', 'such', 'ongoing', 'ministry', 'apostles', 'not', 'trying', 'sell', 'particular', 'theology', 'so', 'much', 'portray', 'context', 'story', 'movie', 'people', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'many', 'extras', 'were', 'real', 'preachers', 'worshippers', 'churches', 'South.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'man', 'pacing', 'bedroom', 'middle', 'night', 'yelling', 'God', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'powerful', 'intimacy', 'moment', 'guy', ""n't"", 'just', 'folding', 'hands', 'saying', 'quot', 'be', 'thy', 'will', 'quot', 'prayer', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'laying', 'heart', 'out', 'God', 'confessing', 'anger', 'REAL', 'prayer', 'kind', 'lives', 'when', 'stop', 'hiding', 'hearts', 'open', 'up', 'when', 'can', 'really', 'begin', 'work', 'us.As', 'Christian', 'movie', 'fan', 'rate', 'movie', 'five', 'five', 'Yes', 'are', 'flaws', 'quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'production', 'are', 'awesome', 'independent', 'film', 'message', 'little', 'too', 'subtle', 'well', 'God', 'message', 'never', 'pound', 'people', 'head']",N/A

Finally, he struck a deal after agreeing to put up a fairly large percentage of the budget himself. I hope he got his money back. By current standards, it was not expensive to make.I do not know what drove Duvall to get ""The Apostle,"" which he also wrote, onto the screen. Whatever his reasons, I am glad he persisted.It does make sense that it was hard to finance. Morality tales have not been in vogue for a couple of decades. Tragedies have never been popular. By tragedy, I am referring to the classical definition, which, in simple terms, is a story about a powerful person who is undone by one fatal flaw. ""The Apostle"" fits this criteria.Perhaps the primary reason for its mediocre commercial success is that its main character is an evangelical Southern preacher. That such a person could be an intelligent being, who fully and honestly believes that its his calling to bring people to salvation, is beyond the experience of the vast majority of Americans.Yet the protagonist - Apostle E. F. - could be anyone who truly wants to be a good person, but is undone by a bad habit or obsession they cannot overcome. His being an evangelical preacher seems to me to be an obviously good choice to build the story around. In the process, it is an eye opener for people who categorize all singing, shouting, charismatic religious leaders as raving maniacs.Duvall hit the jackpot with his very first film. He played Bo Ridley in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Since then, he has had many choice roles, including ""The Godfather Trilogy"" and the TV miniseries, ""Lonesome Dove."" In ""The Apostle,"" as E. F., he pulls out all the stops and gives perhaps his finest performance.Even though Billy Bob Thornton has but two scenes, his performance is first rate. He is such a fine actor that one hardly recognizes him as the same man who starred in ""Sling Blade."" If any of you receive the cable channel BBC America, do not miss him in the British miniseries ""Edge of Darkness.""Farrah Fawcett, as E.F.'s wife, is given a rare opportunity to act. I've never understood why her talents have been largely wasted for years.June Carter Cash, wife of Johnny, portrays E.F.'s mother. To watch her, you'd think she'd been making movies for years.This is the seventh movie filmed around Lafayette, Louisiana. One of the most beautiful areas in The South, it is particularly well utilized here.The film's main failure is that it runs about twenty minutes too long. Actors who turn directors often make this mistake. Mel Gibson did it in ""Braveheart,"" while Kevin Costner has done it in all his movies. There are exceptions, of course, such as Clint Eastwood and Jodie Foster.I think the excessive length problem occurs less from ego problems than from the fact that actors have different training than directors do. Just as the greatest actors can tell us more with their body language than with their dialog, so can the greatest directors make each scene propel the plot along.This is the kind of film I hesitate to write a plot synopsis for. It could spoils things for the viewer. I can tell you that the story is mesmerizing and particularly believable.",4,"Intelligent, beautiful, a tad too long",1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3190,"['Robert', 'Duvall', 'spent', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'Apostle', 'made', 'Finally', 'struck', 'deal', 'agreeing', 'put', 'up', 'fairly', 'large', 'percentage', 'budget', 'hope', 'got', 'money', 'back', 'current', 'standards', 'was', 'not', 'expensive', 'make.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'drove', 'Duvall', 'get', 'Apostle', 'also', 'wrote', 'screen', 'reasons', 'am', 'glad', 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'hard', 'finance', 'Morality', 'tales', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'vogue', 'couple', 'decades', 'Tragedies', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'popular', 'tragedy', 'am', 'referring', 'classical', 'definition', 'simple', 'terms', 'story', 'powerful', 'person', 'who', 'undone', 'one', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Apostle', 'primary', 'reason', 'mediocre', 'commercial', 'success', 'main', 'character', 'evangelical', 'Southern', 'preacher', 'person', 'could', 'be', 'intelligent', 'being', 'who', 'fully', 'honestly', 'calling', 'bring', 'people', 'salvation', 'experience', 'vast', 'majority', 'Americans.Yet', 'protagonist', 'Apostle', 'E.', 'F.', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'undone', 'bad', 'habit', 'obsession', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'being', 'evangelical', 'preacher', 'be', 'obviously', 'good', 'choice', 'build', 'story', 'around', 'process', 'eye', 'opener', 'people', 'who', 'categorize', 'singing', 'shouting', 'charismatic', 'religious', 'leaders', 'raving', 'maniacs.Duvall', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'played', 'Bo', 'Ridley', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'then', 'had', 'many', 'choice', 'roles', 'including', 'Godfather', 'Trilogy', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Apostle', 'E.', 'F.', 'out', 'stops', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance.Even', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'two', 'scenes', 'performance', 'first', 'rate', 'such', 'fine', 'actor', 'one', 'hardly', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'starred', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'receive', 'cable', 'channel', 'BBC', 'America', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'British', 'miniseries', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'E.F.', 'wife', 'given', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'act', ""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'talents', 'have', 'been', 'largely', 'wasted', 'years.June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'wife', 'Johnny', 'E.F.', 'mother', 'watch', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'years.This', 'seventh', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Lafayette', 'Louisiana', 'One', 'most', 'beautiful', 'areas', 'South', 'particularly', 'well', 'utilized', 'here.The', 'film', 'main', 'failure', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'Actors', 'who', 'turn', 'directors', 'often', 'make', 'mistake', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'did', 'Braveheart', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'done', 'movies', 'are', 'exceptions', 'course', 'such', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Jodie', 'Foster.I', 'think', 'excessive', 'length', 'problem', 'less', 'ego', 'problems', 'fact', 'actors', 'have', 'different', 'training', 'directors', 'do', 'Just', 'greatest', 'actors', 'can', 'tell', 'more', 'body', 'language', 'dialog', 'so', 'can', 'greatest', 'directors', 'make', 'scene', 'propel', 'plot', 'along.This', 'kind', 'film', 'hesitate', 'write', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'could', 'spoils', 'things', 'viewer', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'mesmerizing', 'particularly', 'believable']",N/A

It's amazing on so many levels that when the long road to financing the film is revealed (Duvall made it on his own dime), you want to look toward Hollywood and ask ""What were you THINKING?"" He reveals that his award for ""Tender Mercies"" made him think that a window of opportunity might open. However, ""The Apostle"" was to remain in Duvall's ""theater of the mind"" for a few years longer.The casting is perfect. Walton ""Shane Vendrell"" Goggins (The Shield) really stands out as Sammy. Duvall discusses Sammy's ""born again"" scene, saying that Goggin's whole body was shaking as he knelt...it was as if he were actually witnessing a man being born again. Fans of The Shield and its DVD commentaries know that Goggins is the ultimate method actor, isolating himself prior to scenes being filmed, psyching himself up one thousand percent for the performance. He does not disappoint here. He tackles the role of a simple man with a good heart whose life is transformed after encountering a complex man with a stain on his soul (Apostle E.F.).John Beasley's performance as ""Reverend Blackwell"" provides a reason to watch the movie all by itself. Sometimes in life we feel that we've given it all, it's time to rest, and the best is behind us. Then we are called to bring about something bigger than we'd ever imagined. That's Reverend Blackwell's fate, and he plays against Apostle E.F. magnificently.Miranda Richardson as Toosie, the love interest...after Duvall's crime of passion, he attempts to rebuild his life, brick by brick. At one point he tells Toosie (who is separated from her husband) that all he needs is to hold someone who wants to be held. That's his agenda, not hers. She is there when the curtain comes down, but Apostle E.F. ultimately learns that redemption never comes before repentance.Farrah Fawcett manages the impossible...viewers can sympathize with her marriage to a complex, troubled, controlling man like Apostle E.F. while having mixed feelings about her affair with the youth pastor. There is one chilling scene in which Fawcett, off-camera and in a voice-over, surveys the damage in her marriage (and beyond). She's an anti-hero...flawed, but in a manner that differs from her husband. Two flawed people in a doomed marriage, which sets up the underlying conflict that drives the story.As if that weren't enough, the late June Carter Cash (as the Apostle's mother) delivers an elegantly understated yet powerful performance. Her presence is fitting as the hymns she sings throughout add to a powerful, masterfully assembled soundtrack.Note to Robert Duvall: You financed the movie out of your own pocket, and it was worth every penny.

58630,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,0783227426,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[138, 142]","&quot;The Apostle,&quot; starring Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, Miranda Richardson, and John Beasley, is an outstanding film... beautifully written and acted, breathtaking in its simplicity and yet imbued with complex and deeply etched characters, a stunning and realistic portrayal of life inside a southern Pentecostal Christian community, and an eloquent chronicle of one man's search for redemption.The movie's premise is simple and effective.  Euliss &quot;Sonny&quot; Dewey (played by Robert Duvall) is a Pentecostal preacher who has everything: a loving wife Jessie (Farrah Fawcett) and two adoring children; a doting mother (June Carter-Cash); and a thriving ministry. He is respected and loved by his church community.But Sonny is also a womanizer, and a man who suspects his wife being involved in an adulterous relationship of her own.  Jessie is indeed having an affair with Horace, the youth minister in their church. When Sonny discovers the truth about his wife, his life unravels.  He is ousted as pastor of his church.  One day, Sonny momentarily loses control, and in a drunken rage, smashes Horace's skull with a baseball bat.Sonny flees from justice. Styling himself an itinerant preacher, he travels through rural southeastern Texas and into the bayou country of Louisiana. While he is traveling, he hears the voice of his conscience peck away at his vanity and worldly ways.The majority of this beautiful film takes place in a small town in Louisiana's bayou country. Sonny, now self-baptized as &quot;The Apostle E.F.,&quot; sets about resurrecting a small Pentecostal church which had fallen into disuse after the retirement of its pastor. With an infectious smile, eternally effervescent personality, and obvious love for the Lord, the &quot;Apostle E.F.&quot; soon sets this bayou community on its ear.  The Apostle, however, is constantly aware of his past, as his conscience reminds him of the enormity of his crime. How he deals with the issue of balancing God's love with God's justice is perhaps the central theme of this marvelous film.It took Robert Duvall fourteen years to see this project through to fruition, and his commitment shows throughout the film. His performance as &quot;The Apostle E.F.&quot; has tremendous depth and credibility. In this veteran actor's hands, the character of Sonny Dewey illuminates the screen. Other performances of note are those of John Beasley as the compassionate yet strong-willed Reverend Blackwell; and in an excellent cameo appearance, June Carter-Cash as Sonny's mother.

Aptly named Sonny, maybe a throwback to Godfather, the preacher leads a fervently religious life.  Yet, there is a history of sin.  After a passionate fit of anger Sonny takes his bible elsewhere, to find his religion all over again.Duvall does a very good job at playing the disheveled husband, and does equally well in playing Sonny's almost bi-polar self, the reverent preacher.  The problem with this film is not in the characters, but the time it takes to flesh out the plot.  After the first hour, I was surprised that the movie had not finished yet.  Now maybe this movie just does not relate to me, because Sonny preaches in a unique fashion.

Well, all I can say is I feel sorry for anyone who believed that he or she was getting a steamy, violent movie.That said, this is really a good movie.  Sure, it misses the ""great"" plateau, but it still is worth seeing if the portrayal of Pentecostal religion isn't a turn-off to you.This movie was a project of love by Duvall.  He believed in it enough to finance a large part of it himself when the studios refused to have anything to do with it.  So you have a rarity here, a movie made not to make money (though I'm sure Duvall didn't refuse the money I'm sure he made on it) but to satisfy the creative integrity of the leading actor and director.You probably know the basic story.  Sonny is a sincere, though flamboyant, preacher with feet of clay.  His flaws lead him into a situation where he commits an act of violence, and flees the law.  But his life is preaching, and he builds a small church in rural Louisiana...and so the story goes from there.  Billy Bob Thornton is excellent in his two scenes, and this was the picture that introduced him to me.  June Carter Cash, Farrah Fawcett, they are also great in this.  The entire cast was great.Different people see different levels of morality in this film.  Myself, I saw it as the story of a good man (flawed, yes...is there anyone reading this who isn't flawed?) who cracks under the pressure of losing all of importance in his life and commits an act that irrevocably changes his life.  Slowly, he works himself back up, and is redeemed.As a film, it is slow paced.  The beginning 20 minutes are basically introduction to the main character.  The final 20 minutes is basically Sonny's last sermon, but there are touches during that period of time that build up an emotional tension.Don't be in a rush to shut off this video when the credits start rolling.  There is an epilog which helps put the finishing touches to Sonny's story.All in all, a satisfying movie if the emotional Pentecostal flavor doesn't spoil it for you.",4,"Lust (?), Obsession (?), Revenge (?)...Redemption",1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,2119,"['Honest', 'above', 'parenthetical', 'question', 'marks', 'how', 'video', 'was', 'marketed', 'words', 'being', 'video', 'box', 'Well', 'can', 'say', 'feel', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'who', 'believed', 'was', 'getting', 'steamy', 'violent', 'movie.That', 'said', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Sure', 'great', 'plateau', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'portrayal', 'Pentecostal', 'religion', ""n't"", 'turn-off', 'you.This', 'movie', 'was', 'project', 'love', 'Duvall', 'believed', 'enough', 'finance', 'large', 'part', 'when', 'studios', 'refused', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'have', 'rarity', 'here', 'movie', 'made', 'not', 'make', 'money', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Duvall', 'did', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'money', ""'m"", 'sure', 'made', 'satisfy', 'creative', 'integrity', 'leading', 'actor', 'director.You', 'probably', 'know', 'basic', 'story', 'Sonny', 'sincere', 'though', 'flamboyant', 'preacher', 'feet', 'clay', 'flaws', 'lead', 'situation', 'where', 'act', 'violence', 'law', 'life', 'preaching', 'small', 'church', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'so', 'story', 'there', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'excellent', 'two', 'scenes', 'was', 'picture', 'introduced', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'great.Different', 'people', 'see', 'different', 'levels', 'morality', 'film', 'saw', 'story', 'good', 'man', 'flawed', 'yes', 'anyone', 'reading', 'who', ""n't"", 'flawed', 'who', 'pressure', 'losing', 'importance', 'life', 'act', 'irrevocably', 'life', 'Slowly', 'back', 'redeemed.As', 'film', 'slow', 'paced', 'beginning', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'basically', 'introduction', 'main', 'character', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'basically', 'Sonny', 'last', 'sermon', 'are', 'touches', 'period', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'emotional', 'tension.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'rush', 'shut', 'off', 'video', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'epilog', 'put', 'finishing', 'touches', 'Sonny', 'story.All', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'emotional', 'Pentecostal', 'flavor', ""n't"", 'spoil']",N/A

I gave up about two thirds of the way through when I was getting bored and sought out reviews here about the plot, or lack thereof, to see if they indicated that something might happen. First of all, let me say that Robert Duvall was way too old to play the lead. He is only two years younger than June Carter Cash, who was supposed to be his mother. To think that he somehow snagged Farrah Fawcett is ludicrous. He looks like hell. But beyond that, and on to the story. There is no character development beyond the Duvall character. Why does his wife want to leave him? We don't know. The way she cringes when he moves leads you to believe he has hit her in the past, but nothing is said about it. (At least not in the first two thirds of the movie when motivation is, you would think, laid out.) Why does his mother pretend she's dead on the floor? This seems to be something that happens often by the way he treats it, but again, no explanation or exploration of her character.Too me it was a pretty flat and one-dimensional movie. I thought it was very dull and boring, and I'm glad I didn't pay anything to see it - watched it on Netflix. It could have been a rich exploration of the topic, but it isn't.

58636,A3QVAKVRAH657N,0783227426,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[7, 9]","In a film that took 13 years and $5 million of his own money, Robert Duvall tells the story of The  Reverend Eulis &quot;Sonny&quot; Dewey, a charismatic Pentacostal preacher.  As the film opens, Sonny is  being brought (dragged?) to church by a black woman, perhaps a nanny.  In this ramshackle building,  amongst the predominantly black parishioners, Sonny hears the fire and brimstone sermons and is  himself moved to take up preaching.  His present life finds him the head of his own church in East  Texas; driving a luxury car with &quot;Sonny&quot; plates; living in a big house; married to a pretty blonde wife  (Farrah Fawcett); with two lovely blonde children (his &quot;beauties&quot;); a powerful man with a big ego.  But there's a worm in the apple and when the Lord wakes him in a motel one night and tells him to  check his bed at home, Sonny discovers that his wife has taken up with the church's youth minister.It is clear that the marriage has been troubled before, not least of all because Sonny is on the road so  much and has a &quot;wandering eye&quot;, but now his wife tells him she wants out.  She even refuses to pray  with him.  Then, adding insult to injury, he finds that she has taken the church from him too.  Sonny  takes to arguing with the Lord, wondering what he's supposed to do with himself now, waiting for a  sign.  But with no guidance forthcoming, Sonny, at loose ends and drinking too much, shows up at a  little league game to see his children and the youth minister unwisely confronts him.  In an explosion  of temper, but one that's been simmering, Sonny lays him out with a baseball bat.Taking it on the lam, Sonny discards all vestiges of his former life.  An old black man lets Sonny stay  with him for a few days and tells him about a minister he knows down in Louisianna, C. Charles  Blackwell.  Sonny, after much soul searching and further discussions with the Lord, rebaptizes himself  as &quot;The Apostle E. F.&quot; and heads to Bayou Boutte to meet Brother BlackwellThere Sonny takes on several menial jobs and cultivates a friendship with the appropriately distrustful  Blackwell, who has been forced by ill health to abandon his church.  Sonny, his charisma intact and  now possessed by a fierce desire to found a new church, wins Blackwell's trust (or at least a bemused  acquiesence), gains his first disciple in a young mechanic he works with; gets time on a local radio  station to speak the Word, and restores Blackwell's old church.  From humble beginnings--the first  service is attended by only a handful of people--Sonny begins to build a congregation and a  relationship with the surrounding community.  One of the locals, played by Billy Bob Thornton, takes  exception to the idea of blacks and whites worshipping together, but Sonny first beats him and then  confounds him with love (&quot;So spake the Son of God, and Satan stood A while as mute, confounded  what to say.&quot;  --John Milton).Finally, Sonny tells Blackwell who he really is and why he's there.  He knows that the law must soon  close in on him, but until they do he just wants to devote himself to the church.  The story builds--at a  stately pace, it's true--to an extended final scene in which Sonny conducts his last service with the  police waiting to arrest him, having perhaps been betrayed by the mechanic.This is a surprising movie in many ways, but chiefly for the generosity of Duvall's vision.  Producer,  writer, director, star, he obviously has something to say here and the one message that comes through  most clearly is the power of faith in the lives of Sonny and his flock.  One of the most unusual things  about the portrayal of Sonny is that there is never a single moment in the movie where it seems like he  is playing a role.  Think what you will of his surpassing ego and the undeniable control he seeks to  exert on people; he is nonetheless a man who truly believes in what he's saying and feels a genuine  calling to serve the Lord and his fellow man.  The humility with which he recognizes his own  sinfulness and asks God's guidance, the willingness with which he embraces poverty, the eagerness  with which he seeks hard work in order to fund the church, the love with which he approaches  everyone, all mark him as a good and decent man, despite his obvious sins and character flaws.You may disapprove of Sonny's more extreme character traits and impulsive actions (though the Old  Testament-style punishment he metes out seems fair where adultery is concerned) and may find his  religion unusual, but he's a truly compelling figure.  All credit is due to Duvall who has crafted one of  the most well-rounded and even-handed portraits of a man of faith in any picture that I can recall.  His  time and money were well spent.GRADE : A",5,compelling,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,4802,"['film', 'took', '13', 'years', '5', 'million', 'own', 'money', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'story', 'Reverend', 'Eulis', 'quot', 'Sonny', 'quot', 'Dewey', 'charismatic', 'Pentacostal', 'preacher', 'film', 'Sonny', 'being', 'brought', 'dragged', 'church', 'black', 'woman', 'perhaps', 'nanny', 'ramshackle', 'building', 'amongst', 'predominantly', 'black', 'parishioners', 'Sonny', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'sermons', 'moved', 'take', 'up', 'preaching', 'present', 'life', 'head', 'own', 'church', 'East', 'Texas', 'driving', 'luxury', 'car', 'quot', 'Sonny', 'quot', 'plates', 'living', 'big', 'house', 'married', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'wife', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'two', 'lovely', 'blonde', 'children', 'quot', 'beauties', 'quot', 'powerful', 'man', 'big', 'ego', 'worm', 'apple', 'when', 'Lord', 'motel', 'one', 'night', 'check', 'bed', 'home', 'Sonny', 'wife', 'taken', 'up', 'church', 'youth', 'minister.It', 'clear', 'marriage', 'been', 'troubled', 'before', 'not', 'least', 'Sonny', 'road', 'so', 'much', 'quot', 'wandering', 'eye', 'quot', 'now', 'wife', 'out', 'even', 'pray', 'Then', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'taken', 'church', 'too', 'Sonny', 'arguing', 'Lord', 'wondering', 'what', 'supposed', 'do', 'now', 'waiting', 'sign', 'guidance', 'forthcoming', 'Sonny', 'loose', 'ends', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'up', 'little', 'league', 'game', 'see', 'children', 'youth', 'minister', 'unwisely', 'explosion', 'temper', 'one', 'been', 'simmering', 'Sonny', 'out', 'baseball', 'bat.Taking', 'lam', 'Sonny', 'vestiges', 'former', 'life', 'old', 'black', 'man', 'Sonny', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'minister', 'down', 'Louisianna', 'C.', 'Charles', 'Blackwell', 'Sonny', 'much', 'soul', 'searching', 'further', 'discussions', 'Lord', 'quot', 'Apostle', 'E.', 'F.', 'quot', 'heads', 'Bayou', 'Boutte', 'meet', 'Brother', 'BlackwellThere', 'Sonny', 'several', 'menial', 'jobs', 'friendship', 'appropriately', 'distrustful', 'Blackwell', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'ill', 'health', 'abandon', 'church', 'Sonny', 'charisma', 'intact', 'now', 'possessed', 'fierce', 'desire', 'found', 'new', 'church', 'Blackwell', 'trust', 'least', 'bemused', 'acquiesence', 'gains', 'first', 'disciple', 'young', 'mechanic', 'time', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'speak', 'Word', 'Blackwell', 'old', 'church', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'first', 'service', 'attended', 'only', 'handful', 'people', 'Sonny', 'build', 'congregation', 'relationship', 'surrounding', 'community', 'One', 'locals', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'exception', 'idea', 'blacks', 'whites', 'worshipping', 'together', 'Sonny', 'first', 'then', 'love', 'quot', 'spake', 'Son', 'God', 'Satan', 'stood', 'A', 'mute', 'confounded', 'what', 'say.', 'quot', 'John', 'Milton', '.Finally', 'Sonny', 'Blackwell', 'who', 'really', 'why', 'there', 'law', 'must', 'soon', 'close', 'do', 'just', 'devote', 'church', 'story', 'builds', 'stately', 'pace', 'true', 'extended', 'final', 'scene', 'Sonny', 'last', 'service', 'police', 'waiting', 'arrest', 'having', 'perhaps', 'been', 'betrayed', 'mechanic.This', 'surprising', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'chiefly', 'generosity', 'Duvall', 'vision', 'Producer', 'writer', 'director', 'star', 'obviously', 'something', 'say', 'here', 'one', 'message', 'most', 'clearly', 'power', 'faith', 'lives', 'Sonny', 'flock', 'One', 'most', 'unusual', 'things', 'portrayal', 'Sonny', 'never', 'single', 'moment', 'movie', 'where', 'playing', 'role', 'Think', 'what', 'will', 'surpassing', 'ego', 'undeniable', 'control', 'exert', 'people', 'nonetheless', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'saying', 'genuine', 'calling', 'serve', 'Lord', 'fellow', 'man', 'humility', 'own', 'sinfulness', 'God', 'guidance', 'willingness', 'poverty', 'eagerness', 'hard', 'work', 'order', 'fund', 'church', 'love', 'everyone', 'mark', 'good', 'decent', 'man', 'obvious', 'sins', 'character', 'flaws.You', 'may', 'disapprove', 'Sonny', 'more', 'extreme', 'character', 'traits', 'impulsive', 'actions', 'Old', 'Testament-style', 'punishment', 'out', 'fair', 'where', 'adultery', 'concerned', 'may', 'find', 'religion', 'unusual', 'truly', 'compelling', 'figure', 'credit', 'due', 'Duvall', 'who', 'crafted', 'one', 'most', 'well-rounded', 'even-handed', 'portraits', 'man', 'faith', 'picture', 'can', 'recall', 'time', 'money', 'were', 'well', 'spent.GRADE']",N/A

Instead, there is more preaching.  Duvall seems so wrapped up in the performance that he is reluctant to let any plot developments interrupt the flow.

It's a beautiful film for anyone who is open to appreciating the experience of others, whether we accept their beliefs or not (I don't).  It is a genuine portrayal of genuine people.  It's not somber, it's not pious, it's alive, it's fun, it's full of hope through all, it's real.The subject, the charismatic preacher and the believers who accept him, is one that Hollywood has generally treated with some variety of contempt.  Not here.  Robert Duvall regards this as his contribution to humanity, giving back for what he has received from the film business and from the preachers and believers he has known.  It shows a thorough love for its subject, and for the people associated with it.  The gift to the viewer is that, whatever we believe, we can share that love.There is some understandable confusion in some reviews about the main character's moral and spiritual status as portrayed by Duvall.  This film doesn't moralize about its characters, but it is sympathetic to them.  There are no bad people in the film, only fallible humans.  Can a sinner love God?  Can a sinner do God's work?  Is the sinner who serves God a hypocrite?  These aren't even questions in The Apostle.  It presents the love between a sinner and God as a fact.  That the preacher does God's work is just a plain truth in the film; we aren't invited to doubt it.  The man is aware of his faults, he is aware that he has committed a terrible sin.  That doesn't make him a hypocrite; he doesn't comdemn others for what he also does, he doesn't excuse himself.  He believes he is still called to do God's work, and will do it until events make it impossible.  And then he'll still do it.The genuineness in the film comes from many years of preparation, of gathering material from real preachers, from the use of nonactors in key roles, and from Duvall's simple, light but sure-handed direction.  His commentary emphasizes at every point the focus on being real.  He mentions Horton Foote several times; he clearly learned well from his association with Foote (Tender Mercies).  The commentary also emphasizes the fact that the southern ""holiness"" churches, like the ones portrayed in the film, have long been racially integrated, something apparently doubted by some New York critics whom Duvall repeatedly invites to get outside of their ""provincial"" limits sometime to see the world.

Sonny has a great life: he loves his work, he has a beautiful family, and is loved by all in his community. Things turn sour, however, when Sonny discovers his wife is having an affair with the church youth pastor. Sonny goes into a rage, then begins a search for redemption as The Apostle.This is a great film. It is also a movie that shows Christianity in a real and positive light. Part of this is due to the stellar cast: Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton, and Miranda Richardson. Also, many of the extras were real people, non-actors who were filmed while worshipping God.Nevertheless, the majority of the film's success resides with Duvall. Besides starring, he also wrote, directed, and executive produced. He spent nearly 15 years trying to get this picture made before finally securing enough funding (largely from his own pockedt) to begin filming. Duvall's performance is phenomenal (he was robbed of an Oscar by Jack Nicholson) and his love and passion for the project are seen in the directing and writing as well.THE APOSTLE is a great film with a moving story and powerful message.

""The Industry"" tends to treat religious faith with contempt and ridicule -- Hollywood can't believe there are people who actually place their faith in anything besides fame and money.  Religious people end up being treated in film as either comically delusional or slick confidence artists.  Hollywood lives in a cultural bubble of its own making and just can't understand any other set of values.In contrast, this film really reflects the Pentacostal communities of Texas and Louisiana, and does so without looking down at the people who live there.  How refreshing.  I'd be very curious to know how this movie works for people in the UK or other countries.This is one of my favorite movies - I have seen it several times.I really admire Robert Duvall for working to make this picture a reality.

58660,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0783227426,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 1]","Robert Duvall certainly knows how to write an outstanding screenplay. ""The Apostle""'s tells us almost nothing about what's going on in the characters' minds. It's left to the actors to show us -- a chunk of acting meat any good actor would leap at. (Acting is about embodying the character, not reading the lines.) This necessarily leaves the film open for interpretation. Here's my perspective.Though Euliss ""Sonny"" Dewey might honestly feel he has a calling from God, he too-often sees things in terms of how they relate to him and his interests, not God. This is apparent in continually referring to the churches he founds as ""his"" churches. When he takes Toosie (Miranda Richardson) out for dinner, his pre-meal grace includes a self-serving thank-you to The Big Fella for ""the spiritual companionship of a good man and a good woman"". Whether Sonny intends to get her into bed isn't clear, but he obviously doesn't understand Jesus's response to the man who called him ""good Master"" -- ""Why callest thou me 'good'?""Indeed, like most self-professed ""Christians"", Sonny understands almost nothing about his religion. When Reverend Blackwell tells Sonny that he's experienced two heart attacks while preaching, the issue of why a loving God would so punish a person who was doing His will never comes up. That it makes no sense doesn't seem to cross either's mind.Sonny is as much a fake as Elmer Gantry -- he just doesn't know it. The ""Christianity"" he preaches is a lot of noise, failing to convey the practical Christianity Jesus taught and practiced. Sunny's protracted sermon at the end has been criticized as overly long, but its /empty/ length makes clear that Sonny has nothing useful to say. He's little more than a religious entertainer who knows how to please his audience.The characters talk about the Devil making them sin, and God always placing them where they need to be. This effectively denies /any/ responsibility for their behavior. Significantly, there is /no/ point in this film where Sonny explicitly or even implicitly takes responsibility for his actions. It's as if his murdering a man was part of God's Plan for his life, and thus implicitly forgiven. He is never redeemed, because there is no /need/ for redemption. When the police take him away, he asks a pointless question about why they're driving Chevys when most police departments have switched to Fords. ""Oh, well, I'm always sayin' /something/..."" Whether divinely inspired or not -- mostly the latter.""The Apostle"" /is not/ a sympathetic portrayal of pentecostal ministers. It is a brilliantly subtle attack on the cheap, theatrical religion they preach. Sonny is likable enough, and often does good -- but when push comes to shove, he breaks the rules of his religion, then makes excuses that appeal to a human sense of how things are or should be. He does not follow in Jesus's footsteps.Though mostly dead-serious, there are several comic scenes, including Sonny's mother (June Carter Cash) pretending to have a seizure. Another is Duvall dragging a geezer alky out of a bar and encouraging him to quit drinking. The last scene reminds me of the last scene of ""The Producers"". (!!!) Max and Leo are selling shares for their new production to the prisoners, and Sonny is doing much the same with his fellow criminals on his work detail -- he's got them participating in a call-and-response.Regardless of how you interpret ""The Apostle"", it's a great film, with one of the finest performances you will ever see at its center. Robert Duvall is arguably the greatest actor this country has yet produced, and unquestionably one of the greatest actors of all time. Watching him act is like watching Fred Astaire dance, or listening to Mozart's music. The LV's liner notes call him ""the consummate actor -- regarded as peerless by his peers"". It is difficult to argue this (though Marlon Brando and Ned Beatty come close).PS: The preceding was written /before/ I viewed the supplemental material on the LV.

58663,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0783227426,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""The Apostle"" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his ""calling"" and ""anointing"" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers.If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from ""The Apostle."" I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing deptictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment.Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involutary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder.""The Apostle"" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a ""man (or woman) after God's own heart"" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats?FINAL WORD: There's nothing like ""The Apostle"" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless.
