In my opinion, there's alot more going on in this movie and it's more involving than the first...and that, to me, makes it more fun to get into. I agree with Reviewer W. Shumake that audiences today are just spoiled & feel they need to be pampered with million dollar budgets in order to think a movie is good. So long as it's fun and it keeps my interest throughout the whole movie is all I care about, really.

""War of the Worlds 2"" provides a grim glimpse of the post-invasion world.  Two years have passed since the first War of the Worlds.  The humans have defeated the Martians, but the Earth's technology and industry remain destroyed.  And then the aliens return . . .The characters are believable, sympathetic, and intelligent.  The special effects are good, especially for an Asylum movie.  The background music is unobtrusive as background music should be.  The plot is farfetched (Martian invasion, what do you expect?), but it has its own logic and physics to make everything work out plausibly.Bad things:  One character has an impossibly horrid faux-Southern accent.  The audio effects are extremely loud during the battle.  The Martians are still an enigma.Good things: The DVD extra features some magic tricks performed by C. Thomas Howell.  C.
