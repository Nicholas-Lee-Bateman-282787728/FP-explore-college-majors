1538874,A2SQJPUCZNHMZE,B007VX02ES,"Geraldine Ahearn ""Author Geri Ahearn""","[5, 8]","A marriage is about to head to divorce, but the couple agree to try to make it work for the sake of their son. However, the young boy's dad continued to dive into heavy-duty party life and everything that goes with it. The terrifying story begins with intense suspense to edge-of-your-seat while biting your nails, because no-one knows what the Clown is up to as the film explodes in horror. Then be Prepared to what comes Next, perhaps in the dark of night through the woods! This spooky movie defines the true definition of Fear, and makes 'Silence Of The Lambs' look like a comedy.  Acting performance and sound effects are excellent. Highly recommended for horror lovers.

1538875,AEFTIUQHSVUFX,B007VX02ES,Joe Z,"[4, 6]","This is an excellent flick. The main character is on a slippery slope to madness - or maybe not. It's been compared to The Shining. I think this is better. So why only three stars? Because in places it just doesn't hold together. Like, why is there a scene where the couple has great, drugged-out sex followed by a scene where she accuses him of being, well, a druggie? And who IS this clown? THE clown I mean, not the main character. Is he seeking vengeance for a past insult? If he is, he's gone a bit overboard. Is he feeding a child's suppressed hatred? If so, the kid seems to be having a good time, showing no signs of past trauma. Or maybe he's just pure evil. It would have been four stars if some of these questions had been resolved. But I'll be watching this again for sure.",3,"Excellent, but ...",1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,785,"['excellent', 'flick', 'main', 'character', 'slippery', 'slope', 'madness', 'maybe', 'not', 'been', 'compared', 'Shining', 'think', 'better', 'So', 'why', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'places', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'why', 'there', 'scene', 'where', 'couple', 'great', 'drugged-out', 'sex', 'followed', 'scene', 'where', 'being', 'well', 'druggie', 'who', 'clown', 'clown', 'mean', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'past', 'insult', 'gone', 'bit', 'overboard', 'feeding', 'child', 'suppressed', 'hatred', 'so', 'kid', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'showing', 'signs', 'past', 'trauma', 'maybe', 'just', 'pure', 'evil', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'four', 'stars', 'questions', 'had', 'been', 'resolved', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'sure']",N/A
1538876,A1ULT7BKTX2PAK,B007VX02ES,Matt Polapink,"[3, 6]",I got sucked into renting this movie after reading the posted reviews.  Apparently we watched different movies.  Not a terrible movie but certainly not worthy of 5 stars.  I am being generous giving it 3 stars but I like to support horror movies.  Pretty run of the mill predictable story.  There is one scene where the lead is playing a song he wrote for his wife.  It was so horribly lip synced it was laughable.  Why not just let the actor sing in his own voice.  Know I'm being picky but that was a rough scene.  After the movie all I can say is that I like clowns even less then I did before I watched.  That is saying a lot.,3,Oh crap another creepy clown movie,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,630,"['got', 'sucked', 'renting', 'movie', 'reading', 'posted', 'reviews', 'Apparently', 'watched', 'different', 'movies', 'Not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'am', 'being', 'generous', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'like', 'support', 'horror', 'movies', 'Pretty', 'run', 'mill', 'predictable', 'story', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'lead', 'playing', 'song', 'wrote', 'wife', 'was', 'so', 'horribly', 'lip', 'synced', 'was', 'laughable', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'actor', 'sing', 'own', 'voice', 'Know', ""'m"", 'being', 'picky', 'was', 'rough', 'scene', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'like', 'clowns', 'even', 'less', 'then', 'did', 'watched', 'saying', 'lot']",N/A
