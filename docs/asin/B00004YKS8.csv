559388,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00004YKS8,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 8]","If you like Broadway, if you like Stephen Sondheim (or even if you don't), if you like behind-the-scenes looks at show business, you'll probaby like this DVD. It's a documentary of how the original cast recording of Company was put together a few days after the show opened in New York.All one Sunday and through 4 a.m. Monday the tracks were rehearsed, changed, critiqued, redone until with one exception the record was finished. The exception was Elaine Stritch's recording of the big song from the show, ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" It's a dramatic show stopper, and Stritch just couldn't nail it. All the other cast members had been dismissed, so it was just Stritch, the orchestra, and the recording and creative teams. The more takes they took, the more flaccid her performance became and more tired her voice sounded. This section alone on the DVD is high drama. (They finally recorded the orchestra track and had her come back two days later--when she did nail it, to everyone's relief.)The program takes less than an hour and there's no voice over (unless you access a fairly interesting interview made 30 years later by Stritch, Harold Prince, the show's Broadway director, and Pennebaker). You move from song to song seeing how adjustments were made, how help was given, how nuances became highly important. Interspersed are snippets of discussion by Sondheim and Prince of how the show came about.Everyone was acutely aware that they were making the permanent recording of the show's score. The stress, no matter how professional the actors were, had to have been incredible. There's Dean Jones with a fairly brittle voice who was probably chosen for the lead because of his movie name recognition. He clearly looks uncomfortable throughout. At one point the recording supervisor, Thomas Z. Shephard, says to him, ""You're very good and I don't want to spoil something that's potentially marvelous..."" Uh oh. Pamela Meyers was a young singer in her first Broadway show with a big song to perform, ""Another Hundred People."" She looks a bit like Brigitte Jones. Sondheim works with her to get a single note where it should be. She is so serious listening to him and he takes the time to be gentle with her. And there's Stritch, an actress who seems unable to turn it off. She draws the center of attention to her just enough to be noticeable. Most things tend to be dramatic with her, and her struggle with ""Ladies"" is as much self-involved as it is her aiming for excellence.I'm not one of those who thinks a great deal of Company as a show. I've seen it on Broadway and two or three times in rep. It's a musical about marriage and relationships and the inability to commit...or rather, it's a story about relationships and marriage amongst rather superficial upper-East Side New Yorkers. Those are easy targets and the point of view gets, for me, a little tiresome. But the songs are great, and the show was exciting and different when it opened.As I said, if you like Broadway musicals, Steven Sondheim, and behind-the-scenes looks, you'll probably get a kick out of this.",4,"If You Like Broadway Musicals, You'll Probably Like This",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,3079,"['like', 'Broadway', 'like', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'behind-the-scenes', 'looks', 'show', 'business', ""'ll"", 'probaby', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'how', 'original', 'cast', 'recording', 'Company', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'few', 'days', 'show', 'opened', 'New', 'York.All', 'one', 'Sunday', '4', 'a.m.', 'Monday', 'tracks', 'were', 'rehearsed', 'changed', 'critiqued', 'redone', 'one', 'exception', 'record', 'was', 'finished', 'exception', 'was', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'recording', 'big', 'song', 'show', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'dramatic', 'show', 'stopper', 'Stritch', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'nail', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'been', 'dismissed', 'was', 'just', 'Stritch', 'orchestra', 'recording', 'creative', 'teams', 'more', 'took', 'more', 'flaccid', 'performance', 'became', 'more', 'tired', 'voice', 'sounded', 'section', 'alone', 'DVD', 'high', 'drama', 'finally', 'recorded', 'orchestra', 'track', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'did', 'nail', 'everyone', 'relief', 'program', 'less', 'hour', 'voice', 'access', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'interview', 'made', '30', 'years', 'later', 'Stritch', 'Harold', 'Prince', 'show', 'Broadway', 'director', 'Pennebaker', 'move', 'song', 'song', 'seeing', 'how', 'adjustments', 'were', 'made', 'how', 'help', 'was', 'given', 'how', 'nuances', 'became', 'highly', 'important', 'Interspersed', 'are', 'snippets', 'discussion', 'Sondheim', 'Prince', 'how', 'show', 'came', 'about.Everyone', 'was', 'acutely', 'aware', 'were', 'making', 'permanent', 'recording', 'show', 'score', 'stress', 'matter', 'how', 'professional', 'actors', 'were', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'fairly', 'brittle', 'voice', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'chosen', 'lead', 'movie', 'name', 'recognition', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'point', 'recording', 'supervisor', 'Thomas', 'Z.', 'Shephard', ""'re"", 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'something', 'potentially', 'marvelous', 'Uh', 'oh', 'Pamela', 'Meyers', 'was', 'young', 'singer', 'first', 'Broadway', 'show', 'big', 'song', 'perform', 'Hundred', 'People', 'bit', 'Brigitte', 'Jones', 'Sondheim', 'get', 'single', 'note', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'serious', 'listening', 'time', 'be', 'gentle', 'Stritch', 'actress', 'who', 'unable', 'turn', 'off', 'center', 'attention', 'just', 'enough', 'be', 'noticeable', 'Most', 'things', 'tend', 'be', 'dramatic', 'struggle', 'Ladies', 'as', 'much', 'self-involved', 'aiming', 'excellence.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'great', 'deal', 'Company', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Broadway', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'rep', 'musical', 'marriage', 'relationships', 'inability', 'commit', 'rather', 'story', 'relationships', 'marriage', 'amongst', 'rather', 'superficial', 'upper-East', 'Side', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'are', 'easy', 'targets', 'point', 'view', 'little', 'tiresome', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'exciting', 'different', 'when', 'opened.As', 'said', 'like', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'Steven', 'Sondheim', 'behind-the-scenes', 'looks', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'kick']",N/A

559390,AAOT8ZNO94H0V,B00004YKS8,Dean Anderson,"[6, 6]","Company is, to say the least, an unusual show. What is it, really? Certainly a brilliant musical, by Stephen Sondheim. But it's taken a very special place in Broadway Lore, thanks in great part to the Cast Album that was recorded in front of D.A. Pennebaker's cameras.If you're an aficionado of Broadway, you already know a lot about Sondheim. So, it's fascinating to see the young composer coaching his singers and consulting with the recording engineers during this marathon session from 1971.It's a truly exciting and vibrant look at the process, shot entirely hand-held, with raw focusing and close ups on the vocalists. The performances are for the microphones, not the lenses, so you see quite a few candid moments throughout the evening, and this gives the film a heightened intensity, and even moreso because the whole thing runs just under an hour.Still, if you have played and played the cast album, it's very refreshing to see the alternate takes shown here. Dean Jones emoting on ""Being Alive"" is as incredible a performance as you'll ever view, and Elaine Stritch's ""Ladies Who Lunch"" recording is the lynchpin on which this whole film is hung.My only complaint about this DVD is the ""commentary"" track. Granted, this commentary track was done particularly well. Some statements were clearly scripted, like the ones that filmmaker Pennebaker makes at the opening. Also commenting are Hal Prince, Broadway Director extraordinaire, who has some interesting insights and Elaine, the superstar diva, just being her gabby self. They carefully drop comments in where it doesn't take away from the original interview moments in the film, and there's a minimum of rambling, which is all too typical of such tracks on other DVDs.But the fact is, this commentary track should have been a complete and separate interview section, perhaps gathering a few more of the participants, and sitting them down in a room for a chat. It would have been another chance for Pennebaker to roll more film in revisiting this alchemical moment in time.

559394,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00004YKS8,John F. Rooney,"[0, 2]","""Original Cast Album--Company"" was one of the most famous theater documentaries ever made. It gave an insightful, lacerating look at the frantic process of taping a CD in an eighteen hour session. ""Company"" the musical is an edgy view of a group of alienated, neurotic, brittle Manhattanites in a hectic, striving, stressful environment, and it's not a soothing experience to see the taping session. Don't get me wrong: it is a great show, a great album, and it was a groundbreaking show that opened up new vistas for Broadway musicals.But at this taping you don't see any fun or joy in putting together a work of art. You do see a group of highstrung, up tight, a-retentive people at their worst. Stephen Sondheim particularly, constantly smoking, pacing, shows the underside of a perfectionist. At one point he notices that a note has been changed by one of the singers; at another point he insists on exact pronunciations of his lyric. We know he's a genius, but does he think that anyone other than he would recognize these minuscule changes? I thought, what if I were working for this guy? The taping director is also a taskmaster.These are not a group of happy people. Hal Prince shows a meaner streak in this enterprise. When I heard the recording director say ""Take Ten"" at one point I cringed--to think of going take after take in such an exhausting session. It was agonizing watching Elaine Stritch struggling to get everything right with ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" Dean Jones also gave several takes of the song ""Being Alive.""In an October 23, 2010, Stephen Holden in the NY Times review of Marilyn Maye's cabaret act, says of the 82-year-old singer that she sings Jerry Herman songs and others, and he says she is ""the opposite of the kind of high-strung, insecure, narcissist diva."" These adjectives could apply to Sondheim's songs and his characters in ""Company."" Holden went on to say that Maye made ""a brief visit to the catalog of Stephen Sondheim, who, in some ways is her opposite in temperament.""The music, the songs are great and truly memorable, and the finished album is a work of art. Many of the songs are memorable. This is a very instructive and wonderful documentary.

There's no people like show people - and here they are. Fabulous, nervy, talented beyond belief. Stritch doing and re-doing &quot;Ladies Who Lunch&quot; is very good, but the moment for me was Dean Jones singing &quot;Being Alive&quot;. He sings with such heart felt emotion. It moved me to tears. This show is all about New Yorkers, and this song brought back to me the memory of so many New York friends, from that time in the 1970's who are no longer with us. This was their world, a city of strangers, and Sondheim captured it so magnificently. A masterpiece if ever there was one.",5,Memories of old New York,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,724,"['Adding', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'record', 'producing', 'record', 'Broadway', 'show', 'remarkable', 'blew', 'away', 'say', 'people', 'show', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'Fabulous', 'nervy', 'talented', 'belief', 'Stritch', 'doing', 're-doing', 'quot', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'moment', 'was', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'singing', 'quot', 'Being', 'Alive', 'quot', 'such', 'heart', 'felt', 'emotion', 'moved', 'tears', 'show', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'song', 'brought', 'back', 'memory', 'so', 'many', 'New', 'York', 'friends', 'time', '1970', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'was', 'world', 'city', 'strangers', 'Sondheim', 'captured', 'so', 'magnificently', 'masterpiece', 'ever', 'was', 'one']",N/A
559399,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B00004YKS8,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[46, 46]","What a great idea: record the cast album for Stephen Sondheim's ""Company"" live, as it were--no overdubs, no artificial mixdown.  What a great idea: get a documentary crew to record the record session.  The filmmaker caught 15-and-a-half hours of bleary-eyed cast members giving their all for a tough record producer and an even tougher composer/lyricist.  (It had to be one marathon session because it would be too expensive to assemble all those singers and musicians for multiple sessions.)  This is a great documentary that shows how hard it all is.  If you've only seen her on the incipid show ""Alice,"" you'll have no idea how talented Beth Howland is till you see her in ""Getting Married Today.""  Donna McKechnie, Susan Browning, and Pamela Myers spoof Rogers and Hart (and not the Andrew Sisters as everyone seems to think) with verve in ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy,"" which also finds Sondheim at his most clever.  Charles Kimbrough would go on to do Murphy Brown and Barbara Barrie would briefly be in Barney Miller, and both shine here as effortless, ""natural"" actors.  Star Dean Jones is perfect as the slightly dopey Bobby, even if some of his singing will make you wince. What's perhaps most remarkable is that the numbers that sound so fresh and improvisational actually took 8, 10, 15 takes.  Especially ""The Ladies Who Lunch.""  Elaine Stritch's famous song was the last number they recorded.  By the time they were ready, it was after four in the morning and everyone was exhausted.  Stritch tries, but after about eight takes it's clear she's not going to make it that night.  With everyone getting punchy, they decide to record her music track separately, bringing her back the next day to knock the song out of the park.The DVD has a commentary track, as Stritch, Hal Prince and the filmmaker reminisce about the session 30 years later.  There's also a strange feature where one of the songs not covered in the doc can be listened to over B&W; stills from the theatrical production.  This didn't do anything for me, but there's no harm in having it there, either.So this is a very good documentary.  But it could have been even better.  Two of the most complex and interesting songs, the opening number and ""Side By Side/What Would We Do Without You,"" are barely covered in the film.  I really wanted to see how they pulled off these extraordinarily complex numbers with the complete cast ""live,"" but the documentary doesn't show it.  Too bad.  A 90 minute documentary with this material would hae been so much better than a 60 minute documentary without.  It's probably true the 60 minute limit was imposed by ABC, which originally aired the documentary, but I'd be surprised if the filmmaker didn't save material that could have been added back for this DVD.Still, this is worth owning, if a little pricey for a 53 minute CD (not 58, as advertised on the case).  In some ways this musical is a classic, and in others it's incredibly (and amusingly) dated.  Both qualities just make it all the more wonderful.",4,"Great fun, but too short",1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,3031,"['What', 'great', 'idea', 'record', 'cast', 'album', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Company', 'live', 'were', 'overdubs', 'artificial', 'mixdown', 'What', 'great', 'idea', 'get', 'documentary', 'crew', 'record', 'record', 'session', 'filmmaker', 'caught', '15-and-a-half', 'hours', 'bleary-eyed', 'cast', 'members', 'giving', 'tough', 'record', 'producer', 'even', 'tougher', 'composer/lyricist', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'marathon', 'session', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'expensive', 'assemble', 'singers', 'musicians', 'multiple', 'sessions', 'great', 'documentary', 'how', 'hard', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'incipid', 'show', 'Alice', ""'ll"", 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'talented', 'Beth', 'Howland', 'till', 'see', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Today', 'Donna', 'McKechnie', 'Susan', 'Browning', 'Pamela', 'Myers', 'Rogers', 'Hart', 'not', 'Andrew', 'Sisters', 'everyone', 'think', 'verve', 'Could', 'Drive', 'Person', 'Crazy', 'also', 'Sondheim', 'most', 'clever', 'Charles', 'Kimbrough', 'would', 'go', 'do', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'Barbara', 'Barrie', 'would', 'briefly', 'be', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'shine', 'here', 'effortless', 'natural', 'actors', 'Star', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'perfect', 'slightly', 'dopey', 'Bobby', 'even', 'singing', 'will', 'make', 'wince', 'What', 'perhaps', 'most', 'remarkable', 'numbers', 'sound', 'so', 'fresh', 'improvisational', 'actually', 'took', '8', '10', '15', 'Especially', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'famous', 'song', 'was', 'last', 'number', 'recorded', 'time', 'were', 'ready', 'was', 'four', 'morning', 'everyone', 'was', 'exhausted', 'Stritch', 'tries', 'about', 'eight', 'clear', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'night', 'everyone', 'getting', 'punchy', 'decide', 'record', 'music', 'track', 'separately', 'bringing', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'knock', 'song', 'park.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'Stritch', 'Hal', 'Prince', 'filmmaker', 'reminisce', 'session', '30', 'years', 'later', 'also', 'strange', 'feature', 'where', 'one', 'songs', 'not', 'covered', 'doc', 'can', 'be', 'listened', 'B', 'W', 'stills', 'theatrical', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'harm', 'having', 'there', 'either.So', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'Two', 'most', 'complex', 'interesting', 'songs', 'opening', 'number', 'Side', 'Side/What', 'Would', 'Do', 'are', 'barely', 'covered', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'numbers', 'complete', 'cast', 'live', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'show', 'Too', 'bad', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'material', 'would', 'hae', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', '60', 'minute', 'documentary', 'probably', 'true', '60', 'minute', 'limit', 'was', 'imposed', 'ABC', 'originally', 'aired', 'documentary', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'filmmaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'save', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'back', 'DVD.Still', 'worth', 'owning', 'little', 'pricey', '53', 'minute', 'CD', 'not', '58', 'advertised', 'case', 'ways', 'musical', 'classic', 'others', 'incredibly', 'amusingly', 'dated', 'qualities', 'just', 'make', 'more', 'wonderful']",N/A
