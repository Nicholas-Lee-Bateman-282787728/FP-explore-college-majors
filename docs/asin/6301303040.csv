Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more &quot;enjoyable&quot; than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it.

Tragedy soon strikes when the boyfriend decides to threaten Cameron. Big mistake! You see, there's a demon living in Cameron's closet, and it has a tendency to be extremely hostile! Oopsy-daisy, boyfriend just took flight through the second-story window! Bye-bye moron! Unfortunately, this demon isn't satisfied w/ killing off dunder-headed interlopers. Nope, it actually wants to murder as many people as possible in its bid to escape hell and enter our world. Meanwhile, a cop and his therapist (Mel Harris) scramble to solve the series of murders while battling the demon's increasing powers. CAMERON'S CLOSET turned out to be quite an entertaining little movie. I wasn't expecting much, and was very surprised by the high fun-factor. Is there cheeez? Oh yes, but it's all part of the overall enjoyment. So, if you like demons, telekinesis, or watching shirtless jerks sailing through windows, then grab this sparkler today!...",5,Hey!

249525,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,6301303040,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 1]","""Cameron's Closet"" is a real gem among horror films.  Its screenplay was written by Gary Brandner, best-selling author who wrote ""The Howling"" and ""Walkers.""  The demon that haunts Cameron's closet was created by Carlo Rambaldi who also created the extraterrestrial monster in ""Alien.""  Great performances are given by a cast that includes Leigh McCloskey of ""Dallas"" fame and who also starred in Dario Argento's ""Inferno.""  A wonderful soundtrack is provided by Harry Manfredini who scored the original ""Friday the 13th.""  The plot is very suspenseful.Ten-year-old Cameron Lansing (Scott Curtis) has telekinetic powers.  His father, Owen (Tab Hunter), and Ben Majors (Chuck McCann) have been using him as a guinea pig in their experiments.  During one of his sessions, he unknowingly brings a powerful demon into our world.  With the help of a detective and a psychiatrist, Cameron must banish the demon before it destroys everyone around him.  A grotesque creature, gruesome deaths and a gothic, spooky atmosphere highlight this classic creepfest.Ever since watching Stephen King's ""Carrie,"" I've been fascinated with all films involving the misuse and abuse of telekinetic powers.  Other films to watch are Brian DePalma`s ""The Fury,"" David Cronenberg`s ""Scanners,"" and David Schmoeller's ""Tourist Trap.""  I only wish that Sony had released ""Cameron's Closet"" in a widescreen format.  (Full screen simply doesn't do it justice.)  Furthermore, the DVD has no extra features, not even a trailer of this film.",4,"Cameron's Demon is ""Coming Out Of The Closet""",1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,1509,"['Cameron', 'Closet', 'real', 'gem', 'horror', 'films', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Gary', 'Brandner', 'best-selling', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'Howling', 'Walkers', 'demon', 'Cameron', 'closet', 'was', 'created', 'Carlo', 'Rambaldi', 'who', 'also', 'created', 'extraterrestrial', 'monster', 'Alien', 'Great', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'cast', 'Leigh', 'McCloskey', 'Dallas', 'fame', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Inferno', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'provided', 'Harry', 'Manfredini', 'who', 'scored', 'original', 'Friday', '13th', 'plot', 'very', 'suspenseful.Ten-year-old', 'Cameron', 'Lansing', 'Scott', 'Curtis', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'father', 'Owen', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'Ben', 'Majors', 'Chuck', 'McCann', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'guinea', 'pig', 'experiments', 'one', 'sessions', 'unknowingly', 'powerful', 'demon', 'world', 'help', 'detective', 'psychiatrist', 'Cameron', 'must', 'banish', 'demon', 'everyone', 'grotesque', 'creature', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'gothic', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'highlight', 'classic', 'creepfest.Ever', 'watching', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Carrie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fascinated', 'films', 'involving', 'misuse', 'abuse', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'Other', 'films', 'watch', 'are', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 's', 'Fury', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 's', 'Scanners', 'David', 'Schmoeller', 'Tourist', 'Trap', 'only', 'wish', 'Sony', 'had', 'released', 'Cameron', 'Closet', 'widescreen', 'format', 'Full', 'screen', 'simply', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Furthermore', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'film']",N/A

Cowen,"[0, 0]","A young boy is part of an experiment to develop the powers of the mind,but some how the experiment ends up producing unexpected results that no one wants.The prosI found this to be a creepy little film about a young boy dealing with a powerful being. Some people don't find this picture scary,but I found it to be kind of creepy. I got goose bumps when a few of the people got killed. The story line was fairly interesting and doesn't really reveal totally what's going on until almost the end of the film. Good make up and effects for the time period that it came out in.The consThe special effects might have been great when the film came out,but look very dated in this day and age. It really looks bad when they use more set pieces at the end of the film. The acting won't win any awards either in this film. I liked the film,but don't see it as something that you can watch over and over. The dvd I got which is the one shown here doesn't have any extras to speak of,it would have been nice to have some directors commentary or something at least. Also some of the elements of the story line like the boy's mother's boy friend pushing the child around are really cliched and has been done to death already.",3,"Creepy little film.
