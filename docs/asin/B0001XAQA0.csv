816730,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B0001XAQA0,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[0, 0]","This movie ""Head Above Water"" (1997) is packed with top-notch actors such as Harvey Keitel and Cameron Diaz. A plus is the great aquatic scenery.You want to start figuring out what is going to happen from the beginning of the story. You may draw conclusions; however you are wrong.As the different problems arise for each of the characters, their correction attempts only cause the problems to snowball. I keep thinking of Dave Barry ""Big Trouble"" [UNABRIDGED] ISBN: 1567404596 and how Dave starts out  saying something that seems innocuous  and soon it  gets blown out of proportion and you find yourself defending some indefensible illogical stance. This film starts out with a simple problem that in the end looks ridiculous. But at the very last moment it takes care of its self (or does it?)Did I mention it is a lot of fun?",4,The wet head is dead,979430400,"01 14, 2001",2001,829,"['movie', 'Head', 'Above', 'Water', '1997', 'packed', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'such', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'plus', 'great', 'aquatic', 'scenery.You', 'want', 'start', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'beginning', 'story', 'may', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'however', 'are', 'wrong.As', 'different', 'problems', 'arise', 'characters', 'correction', 'only', 'cause', 'problems', 'snowball', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Dave', 'Barry', 'Big', 'Trouble', '[', 'UNABRIDGED', ']', 'ISBN', '1567404596', 'how', 'Dave', 'out', 'saying', 'something', 'innocuous', 'soon', 'blown', 'proportion', 'find', 'defending', 'indefensible', 'illogical', 'stance', 'film', 'out', 'simple', 'problem', 'end', 'ridiculous', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'care', 'self', 'Did', 'mention', 'lot', 'fun']",N/A

Cameron Diaz was good too, though I fail to see her ""beauty"".  To me she is very average looking, but good at being ditzy when acting.  I never liked Keitel until I saw this movie.  It was a movie like ""When Bad Things Happen"", Diaz having been in that one with Christian Slater, but this one was comedy and irony whereas ""When Bad Things Happen"" (I hope I have that title correct) was irony and serious. I will watch this one again.

816732,APB7DD3MXUTR2,B0001XAQA0,"DL Minor ""movie maven""","[0, 2]","I recall ""Head Above Water"" as an amusing farce. It wasn't/isn't really what could be called personal best work for Harvey Keitel, Cameron Diaz or any of the supporting players (Okay, okay-- Billy Zane's assured turn as Diaz's conniving ex-lover was an enjoyable hoot), but it was definitely a pleasant way to spend a quiet afternoon, when it debuted on premium cable some years back.I therefore give it four stars for those reasons and two more: Diaz is drop-dead ravishing (pun intended; sorry) as the ditzy, increasingly beleaguered Natalie, and Shawn Colvin's winning, winsome reading of ""Sail On Sailor,"" played over the opening credits, perfectly complements the gorgeous scenery and Natalie's loopy dilemmas.I've been searching without success so far for Colvin's recording of ""Sailor"", by the way.
