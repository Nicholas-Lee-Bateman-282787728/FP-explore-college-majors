Even the entrance of the chorus in the first scene was undercut with the orchestra instead of the stage.  The sound engineers must have been those 90 year-old people who felt that the sound systems of the viewer could not handle the true dynamics of the score.  This was filmed sometime between1986 and 87 and there is NO excuse for the fuzzy and dim visual appearance.  As I have sometimes said in the past, ""Why did they even bother?""  Alfredo Kraus is the only accomplished professional in the cast.  The rest of the crew were not well served by the DVD production personnel.  Maybe this is one of those knock-off transfers from a pirated VHS, which nobody now living would even bother with.  Unfortunately I held on to this embarrassment too long before watching it to return it.  A total waste of time and money.  I should know better and do more thorough research before buying any DVDs, especially of operaor any classical performances.  SOUND is important, people!

561270,A3BU6QT97HMF,B00004Z4VU,Joseph Hart,"[8, 8]","I usually (much to my grief before I started doing it) read a few reviews before spending so much money for a DVD.  Classical music is criminally overpriced, particularly when 99.99% of the country hates it!  Sigh.  So before buying Sutherland in Lucia, I read the ""reviews.""  Everyone was obsessed with her age and insisted that she'd lost her voice (and the sky is falling too, and she's too big (as compared to what) and she can't act (oh yes she can) and she's ugly (I think she's beautiful and she has a very natural warm reticent smile) all of which is just cruel and foolish and small minded when up against such a major, major talent, if singing is genius, she's got it).  I believed it and bought the MET version and thought I was happy.  Then tonight I watched the mad scene from this version (the 1986 one) on a collection of excerpts from her famous roles, and it knocked my socks off.  It was so much better, and her voice far from being worn out (poor old thing) was clear and distinct and absolutely wonderful.  Well, this version is apparently out of print.  I couldn't find it anywhere and I wanted it desperately.  Finally I found a copy through an Amazon seller and ordered it.  If the rest of the opera is as good (and I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be) as the mad scene I saw tonight (bloodier, more business, even better singing, some interacting with the chorus members are a few things that struck me, and apparently they struck the audience too, because she was required to stand up and take a bow right then and there, thus interrupting the opera and the story), if it's as good as that, I struck gold.",5,Anticipation,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,1637,"['usually', 'much', 'grief', 'started', 'doing', 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'DVD', 'Classical', 'music', 'criminally', 'overpriced', 'particularly', 'when', '99.99', '%', 'country', 'Sigh', 'buying', 'Sutherland', 'Lucia', 'read', 'reviews', 'Everyone', 'was', 'obsessed', 'age', 'insisted', ""'d"", 'lost', 'voice', 'sky', 'falling', 'too', 'too', 'big', 'compared', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'oh', 'yes', 'can', 'ugly', 'think', 'beautiful', 'very', 'natural', 'warm', 'reticent', 'smile', 'just', 'cruel', 'foolish', 'small', 'minded', 'when', 'up', 'major', 'major', 'talent', 'singing', 'genius', 'got', 'believed', 'bought', 'MET', 'version', 'thought', 'was', 'happy', 'Then', 'tonight', 'watched', 'mad', 'scene', 'version', '1986', 'one', 'collection', 'excerpts', 'famous', 'roles', 'knocked', 'socks', 'off', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'voice', 'far', 'being', 'worn', 'out', 'poor', 'old', 'thing', 'was', 'clear', 'distinct', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Well', 'version', 'apparently', 'print', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere', 'wanted', 'desperately', 'Finally', 'found', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'seller', 'ordered', 'rest', 'opera', 'as', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'mad', 'scene', 'saw', 'tonight', 'bloodier', 'more', 'business', 'even', 'better', 'singing', 'interacting', 'chorus', 'members', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'struck', 'apparently', 'struck', 'audience', 'too', 'was', 'required', 'stand', 'up', 'take', 'bow', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'thus', 'interrupting', 'opera', 'story', 'as', 'good', 'struck', 'gold']","Donizetti - Lucia di Lammermoor / Richard Bonynge, Sydney Opera House"

Since when were we supposed to believe that the actor/singer/dancer was supposed to look the part?  Who goes to the theater for realism; I go to be transported to a different dimension; a place where I can dream - Lawrence Olivier & Vivien Leigh or Rudolph Nureyev & Margot Fonteyn as Romeo & Juliet; Luisa Tetrazzini and Violetta; Leontyne Price as Cho Cho San; Sutherland as Lucia, etc.  GIVE ME A BREAK!!!  When was the last time you saw a believable Mimi or Violetta (Moffo perhaps).  I don't know where I'm going with this, but I think you get the picture.  Until I saw Sutherland with Pavarotti, I thought she was a hunchback (she was always bent down to prevent her from towering over her tenor).If you watch either the 1982 DVD from the Met or this 1986 DVD from Opera Austrailia and are not moved by the performance, you must be dead.  By the way, Sutherland's last official staged opera performance was Les Huguenot at Opera Australia in 1990.  She performed later that year at ROH Covent Garden with Horne & Pavarotti at her official retirement ceremony.  Yes she performed until 64; Lucia, I Masnedieri, Anna Bolena, Dialog of the Carmelites & Adriana Lecouvreur after age 60.  What a testament to her flawless technique.  She sang professionally for 47 years; 31 at the very pinnacle of her art.  Now feel free to argue with her success.  I recently got into a discussion with an old sparring partner over Callas & Sutherland in La Traviata and Lucia.  After the smoke cleared, I realized I really prefer Anna Moffo in both roles.

561272,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004Z4VU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","This performance of Gaetano Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" with Joan Sutherland in the title role is from a 1986 staging at Sydney's famous opera house. This makes it more than a quarter-century down the road since Sutherland's legendary debut in the role at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. So this is not ""La Stupenda"" at the height of her vocal prowess, but it is still pretty good and few opera fans are going to want to pass up an opportunity to see her do the Mad Scene again, even when the greatest bel canto soprano of her generation is at the end of her storied career.Be sure you check the audio setting on your DVD player to see which one works best for you. I started out with the Dolby Digital 2CH and was disappointed with my inability to crank the sound up sufficiently and then discovered much better results with Dolby Digital 5.1CH. So settle the issue before Lucia shows up for her rendezvous with Edgardo.""Lucia di Lammermoor"" with its libretto by Kammerano is based on Sir Walter Scott's tragic novel ""The Bride of Lammermoor."" Everybody is singing in Italian but the story is set in Eastern Scotland circa 1700. Lucia (Sutherland) and Edgardo (Richard Geager) love each other, but her brother Enrico (Malcolm Donnelly) needs to marry her off to Lord Arturo (Sergei Baiglidin) to save the Ashton house from ruin. So Enrico forges a letter to make Edgardo seem unfaithful, Lucia signs a wedding contract, Edgardo finds out, curses her for her unfaithfulness and sends Lucia off the deep end. In her bridal chamber she slays Arturo, tries to keep up with the flute player in the celebrate Mad Scene, and then drops dead. Edgardo discovers the truth and kills himself on her grave.The high point of the performance is the Sextet in Act II. That was the one part that gave me chills and you will notice from the way the audience explodes in applause as soon as it is over that they would agree with that assessment as well. Sutherland still sounds pretty good on the high notes, even if she does not hold them as long as you memory recalls from your favorite recording of ""Lucia"" (not that my ear was ever good enough to recognize the two E-flats when they come along in this one). Clifford Grant makes a nice Raimondo and while Geager's tenor voice is not on the first level he actually does a nice job of capturing the emotion of what he is singing throughout. Plus he has to do two arias after Sutherland's character has died and I have seen people leave before the final scene, so I always like to root for the poor tenor when I see ""Lucia.""Of course since Sutherland is singing ""Luica"" is conducted by Richard Bonynge with John Copley directing the principles and the large supporting cast (take note of the simple but effective tableaus he sets up for applause moments in the evening). This is not a classic performance and there is never really a taped stage performance of an opera that sounds as good as a DVD, but that is hardly news to opera buffs. Also, the lighting does not work as well for the camera as it does for the audience at the opera house, so things are very dark from start to finish, which I guess you have to expect given the number of corpses that end up on the stage by the end of this one. Overall, this is still an enjoyable enough performance taken as an opportunity to see and hear, as one person has so aptly put it here, Sutherland in autumn.",4,"Joan Sutherland doing ""Luica di Lammermoor"" at Sydney in 1986",1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,3405,"['performance', 'Gaetano', 'Donizetti', 'Lucia', 'di', 'Lammermoor', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'title', 'role', '1986', 'staging', 'Sydney', 'famous', 'opera', 'house', 'more', 'quarter-century', 'road', 'Sutherland', 'legendary', 'debut', 'role', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'not', 'La', 'Stupenda', 'height', 'vocal', 'prowess', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'few', 'opera', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'see', 'do', 'Mad', 'Scene', 'again', 'even', 'when', 'greatest', 'bel', 'canto', 'soprano', 'generation', 'end', 'storied', 'career.Be', 'sure', 'check', 'audio', 'setting', 'DVD', 'player', 'see', 'one', 'best', 'started', 'out', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2CH', 'was', 'disappointed', 'inability', 'crank', 'sound', 'up', 'sufficiently', 'then', 'discovered', 'much', 'better', 'results', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1CH', 'So', 'settle', 'issue', 'Lucia', 'up', 'rendezvous', 'Edgardo', 'Lucia', 'di', 'Lammermoor', 'libretto', 'Kammerano', 'based', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Scott', 'tragic', 'novel', 'Bride', 'Lammermoor', 'Everybody', 'singing', 'Italian', 'story', 'set', 'Eastern', 'Scotland', 'circa', '1700', 'Lucia', 'Sutherland', 'Edgardo', 'Richard', 'Geager', 'love', 'other', 'brother', 'Enrico', 'Malcolm', 'Donnelly', 'marry', 'off', 'Lord', 'Arturo', 'Sergei', 'Baiglidin', 'save', 'Ashton', 'house', 'ruin', 'So', 'Enrico', 'forges', 'letter', 'make', 'Edgardo', 'seem', 'unfaithful', 'Lucia', 'signs', 'wedding', 'contract', 'Edgardo', 'out', 'unfaithfulness', 'Lucia', 'deep', 'end', 'bridal', 'chamber', 'Arturo', 'keep', 'up', 'flute', 'player', 'celebrate', 'Mad', 'Scene', 'then', 'drops', 'dead', 'Edgardo', 'truth', 'grave.The', 'high', 'point', 'performance', 'Sextet', 'Act', 'II', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'gave', 'chills', 'will', 'notice', 'way', 'audience', 'explodes', 'applause', 'as', 'soon', 'would', 'agree', 'assessment', 'as', 'well', 'Sutherland', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'high', 'notes', 'even', 'not', 'hold', 'as', 'long', 'memory', 'recalls', 'favorite', 'recording', 'Lucia', 'not', 'ear', 'was', 'ever', 'good', 'enough', 'recognize', 'two', 'E-flats', 'when', 'come', 'along', 'one', 'Clifford', 'Grant', 'nice', 'Raimondo', 'Geager', 'tenor', 'voice', 'not', 'first', 'level', 'actually', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'emotion', 'what', 'singing', 'do', 'two', 'arias', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'died', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'leave', 'final', 'scene', 'always', 'root', 'poor', 'tenor', 'when', 'see', 'Lucia', 'course', 'Sutherland', 'singing', 'Luica', 'conducted', 'Richard', 'Bonynge', 'John', 'Copley', 'directing', 'principles', 'large', 'supporting', 'cast', 'take', 'note', 'simple', 'effective', 'tableaus', 'up', 'applause', 'moments', 'evening', 'not', 'classic', 'performance', 'never', 'really', 'taped', 'stage', 'performance', 'opera', 'as', 'good', 'DVD', 'hardly', 'news', 'opera', 'buffs', 'Also', 'lighting', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'camera', 'audience', 'opera', 'house', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'start', 'finish', 'guess', 'have', 'expect', 'given', 'number', 'corpses', 'end', 'up', 'stage', 'end', 'one', 'Overall', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'performance', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'see', 'hear', 'one', 'person', 'so', 'aptly', 'put', 'here', 'Sutherland', 'autumn']","Donizetti - Lucia di Lammermoor / Richard Bonynge, Sydney Opera House"

Unfortunately, she sounds every day of it.  She can still encompass the notes (though there are some downward transpositions in the Mad Scene) but her sound by this time had become faded, with ""gray"" patches all over the range.  Her 1982 Met Lucia, also on videotape, is somewhat brighter vocally.  Still, even that one is a far cry from the Sutherland voice in its glorioius prime.
