1692657,A1AGBTL8M08K4V,B00HW3ELGW,Al Hence,"[3, 5]","I really enjoyed the first season as a very well played ensemble production with an almost entirely female cast. It was full of interesting characters, but most importantly it felt fresh. It wasn&#8217;t like every other prison film ever made.  The diversity of characters, especially the expert portrayals by the  cast of Latinas, was refreshing and always watchable.  I'd give it four stars, five for some episodes.But in the second season the show seems to be running out of ideas and descending into staple clich&eacute;s of prison pictures, including at least three explicit beatings.  This is most vividly seen in the introduction of the Vee&#34;/Yvonne Parker character (played by Lorraine Toussaint).  If anything, Ms. Toussaint is too expert in her vivid portrayal of the prison gang leader, female division.  I was hoping the series was going away from this kind of thing and Ms. Toussaint is more than talented enough to go in another direction.  But when she shows up with her gang of enforcers, what the heck?  The sex business is also going over the top. For example, the steamy (literally- it takes place in the shower, chuckle, chuckle) but wholly gratuitous sex scene between Soso (Kimiko Glenn) and Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne) seems to have no purpose except fan service/prurient interest.  Remember those &#34;women in prison&#34; pictures whose main feature was lots of nudity?  Headed that way.Just incidentally, the season goes against two of the principle points in Ms. Kerman&#8217;s book.  Despite generations of &#8220;women in prison movies&#8221; there was no serious violence in her prison and no obvious sex, lesbian or otherwise. If the show wants to be just one more prison movie they can do it without me.",3,Not Your Mom's Prison Movie,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,1741,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'ensemble', 'production', 'almost', 'entirely', 'female', 'cast', 'was', 'full', 'interesting', 'characters', 'most', 'importantly', 'felt', 'fresh', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'other', 'prison', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'diversity', 'characters', 'especially', 'expert', 'portrayals', 'cast', 'Latinas', 'was', 'refreshing', 'always', 'watchable', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'episodes.But', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'be', 'running', 'ideas', 'descending', 'staple', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'prison', 'pictures', 'including', 'least', 'three', 'explicit', 'beatings', 'most', 'vividly', 'seen', 'introduction', 'Vee', '34', '/Yvonne', 'Parker', 'character', 'played', 'Lorraine', 'Toussaint', 'anything', 'Ms.', 'Toussaint', 'too', 'expert', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'prison', 'gang', 'leader', 'female', 'division', 'was', 'hoping', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'away', 'kind', 'thing', 'Ms.', 'Toussaint', 'more', 'talented', 'enough', 'go', 'direction', 'when', 'up', 'gang', 'enforcers', 'what', 'heck', 'sex', 'business', 'also', 'going', 'top', 'example', 'steamy', 'literally-', 'place', 'shower', 'chuckle', 'chuckle', 'wholly', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scene', 'Soso', 'Kimiko', 'Glenn', 'Nicky', 'Nichols', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'have', 'purpose', 'fan', 'service/prurient', 'interest', 'Remember', '34', 'women', 'prison', '34', 'pictures', 'main', 'feature', 'was', 'lots', 'nudity', 'Headed', 'way.Just', 'incidentally', 'season', 'two', 'principle', 'points', 'Ms.', 'Kerman', '8217', 's', 'book', 'generations', '8220', 'women', 'prison', 'movies', '8221', 'was', 'serious', 'violence', 'prison', 'obvious', 'sex', 'lesbian', 'otherwise', 'show', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'prison', 'movie', 'can', 'do']",N/A

I'm always interested in pressure cooker/intense situations and women's prison can certainly be that.  I,  with many others,  find Piper Chapman one of the less interesting characters,  but I love so many of the women and their stories and interaction.  Poor Pennsatucky, who is far crazier than Crazy Eyes,  Tastee who can't find her feet outside,  even Yoga Jane and trackstar girl - all of them are wonderful.I will say that the inmates are more nuanced than the guards/administration who are mostly far less likeable.

The series revolves around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a bisexual woman living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in a women's federal prison for transporting a suitcase full of drug money to her former girlfriend, Alex Vause (Laura Prepon who played Donna from That '70s Show.), who is an international drug smuggler. The offense occurred ten years prior to the start of the series, and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's upper middle class. While in prison, Piper is reunited with Alex, and they re-examine their relationship and deal with their fellow inmates. Piper navigates the stresses it creates in her life and with her fianc&eacute; Larry (Jason Biggs). While in prison, Piper tries to understand and find her place in the hierarchy. Sentenced to fifteen months for a crime committed ten years earlier, Piper Chapman leaves her supportive fianc&eacute; Larry for her new home: a women's prison. Her supervisor, Sam Healy sympathizes with her and tries to gently give her tips to survive. She grapples with the racial dynamics of prison life and learns some of the rules. Unfortunately, she offends Red, the powerful matriarch of the prison kitchen, who responds by serving Chapman a bloody tampon. Chapman is then shocked to discover that Alex, her former lover (who recruited her into carrying drug money) is in the same prison. Flashbacks depict the particulars of Chapman's crime, Chapman telling her family about her crime, and Larry's marriage proposal.Very funny, sarcastic but also dramatic!",5,Another Fish-Out-of-Water Story from the Creator of Weeds,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,1738,"['Jenji', 'Kohan', 'creator', 'Weeds', 'based', 'Piper', 'Kerman', 'memoir', '34', 'Orange', 'New', 'Black', 'Year', 'Women', 'Prison', '34', 'experiences', 'prison', 'series', 'Piper', 'Chapman', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'bisexual', 'woman', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'sentenced', '15', 'months', 'women', 'federal', 'prison', 'transporting', 'suitcase', 'full', 'drug', 'money', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Alex', 'Vause', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'who', 'played', 'Donna', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'who', 'international', 'drug', 'smuggler', 'offense', 'occurred', 'ten', 'years', 'prior', 'start', 'series', 'time', 'Piper', 'had', 'moved', 'quiet', 'law-abiding', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'prison', 'Piper', 'reunited', 'Alex', 're-examine', 'relationship', 'deal', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'Piper', 'stresses', 'life', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Larry', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'prison', 'Piper', 'understand', 'find', 'place', 'hierarchy', 'Sentenced', 'fifteen', 'months', 'crime', 'committed', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'Piper', 'Chapman', 'supportive', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Larry', 'new', 'home', 'women', 'prison', 'supervisor', 'Sam', 'Healy', 'tries', 'gently', 'give', 'tips', 'survive', 'racial', 'dynamics', 'prison', 'life', 'rules', 'Unfortunately', 'Red', 'powerful', 'matriarch', 'prison', 'kitchen', 'who', 'serving', 'Chapman', 'bloody', 'tampon', 'Chapman', 'then', 'shocked', 'discover', 'Alex', 'former', 'lover', 'who', 'recruited', 'carrying', 'drug', 'money', 'same', 'prison', 'Flashbacks', 'depict', 'particulars', 'Chapman', 'crime', 'Chapman', 'telling', 'family', 'crime', 'Larry', 'marriage', 'proposal.Very', 'funny', 'sarcastic', 'also', 'dramatic']",N/A

1692669,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00HW3ELGW,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 5]","I had the good fortune of hearing Kate Mulgrew speak at the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention last summer.  While she was clearly there to speak with fans about her work as the first female captain to headline her own Trek program (STAR TREK: VOYAGER), it was equally obvious that she was all too happy to talk about her experiences as part of the Netflix women&#8217;s prison dramedy, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK.  She didn&#8217;t go on and on about &#8211; though I&#8217;ve no doubt she could have &#8211; but one of the things she emphasized on several occasions was that the brilliance of the show&#8217;s writing was in choosing to focus so much time on so many &#8216;damaged&#8217; people.  (Her words, not mine.)  As I hadn&#8217;t seen the show (not a big fan of Netflix for personal reasons), my wife and I agreed that once this came out on home video we were definitely going to have to pick up a copy.I&#8217;m glad we did!I won&#8217;t belabor what others have already established clearly about ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK.  It&#8217;s a great character comedy which happens to be set inside what I believe is a minimum security prison.  (I could be wrong on that, but these inmates do seem to have more freedoms and privileges than most of what I&#8217;ve seen of OZ.)  Stories show that there is a solitary confinement available &#8220;down the hill&#8221; (at a separate location), and I would suppose the real hard-core offenders spend much of their time in that facility.  (Again, could be wrong, just stating it for clarity.)What ORANGE does uniquely well is it borrows heavily from the storytelling format last used (to great effect) on ABC TV&#8217;s LOST.  (They are entirely different shows, but they do share this thematic similarity.)  Namely, ORANGE presents a growing roster of characters whose backgrounds and kinda/sorta shrouded in a bit of natural mystery &#8211; they&#8217;re all inmates, after all, meaning they&#8217;re behind bars for doing something society has deemed inappropriate &#8211; and their separate history are revealed via some delicious &#8216;flashbacks.&#8217;  In some cases, audiences don&#8217;t quite know what Inmate A has done; however, their associated flashbacks certainly point us in on some clues.  It&#8217;s a delight watching as their history grows, and we&#8217;re allowed to watch how they behave in the present for even more tips.  I suspect &#8211; before all is said and done &#8211; we&#8217;ll know everything about them (it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re going anywhere); the real trick is to keep people interested, and I suspect this format will do the trick for quite some time.As a lead, Taylor Schilling as the unintentionally uptight &#8216;yuppie&#8217; is wonderful.  Her &#8216;Piper Chapman&#8217; is a true original with just the right amount of &#8216;clueless blonde&#8217; and &#8216;girl next door&#8217; charm that you never quite feel sorry for her, not so much as her misdirected &#8216;good intentions&#8217; make you want to occasional bonk her upside the head.  Mulgrew is particularly convincing as the Russian matron who relishes the authority she receives by running the prison kitchen, and the remainder of the cast are equally intelligent and likeable despite the fact that every one of them did something wrong in their past.My personal advice?  Not that anyone on the production staff is reading, but &#8211; if you are &#8211; then do what you can to deep-six Jason Biggs&#8217; character.  For my tastes, he serves no long-term benefit here &#8211; he vacillates far too much about what he should do with himself &#8211; and I&#8217;d rather he get crushed under an Amtrak if that meant giving viewers more screen time for the ladies in orange.  Or beige.  Or black.  Whatever.  That&#8217;s where the real stories are.  That&#8217;s where the magic lies.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  My chief problem with ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is that the writers spend far too much time trying to convince me that everyone &#8211; whether incarcerated or not &#8211; is as &#8216;damaged&#8217; as everyone else; the only difference between us and the inmates is that the inmates are the ones who got caught.

Being more of a movie guy, I find myself getting impatient when it comes to watching TV shows.  Then one day when I was sick, I saw a few of my friends raving about this show and just had to give it a curiosity try, so I did.  If you had told me beforehand that I would watch this whole season in its entirety--TWICE--I would have called you crazy.Orange is the New Black succeeds in bringing doses of comedy and intrigue to what would otherwise seem to be a female version of Oz.  Set at a correctional facility in New York state, it tells us the story of Piper Chapman, a young woman who's serving a prison sentence for what basically amounts to being an accessory in drug running with a former ex-girlfriend, Alex.  In addition to showing us her daily struggle in this prison, we also see life on the outside with Piper's fiancee, Larry, a struggling writer who's trying to make his mark in journalism while keeping it together for the sake of his and Piper's relationship, which is a lot harder than he would believe it to be.OitNB features a lot more characters, such as Red, a woman serving a lengthy prison sentence who is now in charge of the prison kitchen.  Her character happens to be one of my favorites in the series so far.  We also get to meet other interesting characters such as Miss Claudette, an actual gentle soul whom is feared by all the inmates, and &#34;Pornstache&#34; Mendez, a correctional officer who happens to be a real jerk.It's really worth watching on Netflix if you subscribe to the service, it really is.

1692674,AIO247KHD2O40,B00HW3ELGW,James N Simpson,"[1, 2]","Had never heard of this show before seeing the DVD on the shelf and picked it up and found it to be an entertaining show and look forward to the next season being released on DVD.  I liked how the actors were pretty much all unknown, (the only one I recognised was Laura Prepon, who played Donna from That 70's Show, who plays Alex in this one and looks a lot different anyway).  This haven't seen before factor gave the cast a lot more believability that they could indeed be inmates, plus the fact that the actresses covered a wide range of real world body shapes and the makeup department did a good job as well (such as Pennsatucky who appears without teeth due her former drug addicted lifestyle) gave it a more a realistic feel.  It would have been tempting for higher ratings as a lot of US made shows have done in the past, just to fill the show with hot women but I think the show works, because they didn't.The initial episodes obviously concentrate heavily on Piper, a blond surburban woman who had plans to be married before her younger days past caught up to her.  She's obviously a fish out of water and even though she's read up on prison life, in reality she puts herself off side with some of the inmates from the get go. Not helping her cause is that she gives off unwittingly, an I don't belong here like the rest of you vibe.  Her husband as you'll find out, won't help her case there either.  The season for me though became even better though when we started to learn the backstories and got to know the other characters a bit more and episode plots took up more time with them.There are some inconsistencies with the plot, one episode has the prison setting like a high security one, where all hell breaks loose due to a missing screwdriver in fear it can be used to stab a guard or other prisoner down the track, but then the rest of the time it's like a minimum security facility, where everyone can go wherever they want such as the fact that anyone can just walk into the kitchen at anytime where there's a range of knives, the woman who used to be a man character has scissors to cut hair in her cell which anyone seems to be able to walk into and things like this.  I did wonder on the former man inmate, would he really be allowed to do his time in a women's prison just because he'd had something removed?  Would a snitch really be in the same prison as the person she gave up who got sent there too?  Would a mother and daughter really be sentenced into the same facility?  These things though do add to the fun of the plot, and who knows perhaps they do indeed happen in real life prison.Orange is the New Black is an interesting title for a show considering inmates in this prison only wear orange while they're being processed during their first days.  But I guess it's more catchy than light brown is the new black.  There's also some nice extras that come with the DVD, besides episode commentary on a few, there's also a few short documentaries where the actors are interviewed (and you get to see them with teeth, speak in their own country's accent and so forth), where they talk about the show and their characters. The real life Piper is interviewed. There's also a gag reel.  All up the episodes and documentary extras take up around 12 hours so it's good value for money on that front too.",5,"A Fun Prison Set Drama, Although Should Really be Called Light Brown is the New Black Since Prisoners Only Wear Orange on Day 1",1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,3333,"['Had', 'never', 'heard', 'show', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'picked', 'up', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'season', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'liked', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'unknown', 'only', 'one', 'recognised', 'was', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'who', 'played', 'Donna', '70', 'Show', 'who', 'Alex', 'one', 'lot', 'different', 'anyway', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'factor', 'gave', 'cast', 'lot', 'more', 'believability', 'could', 'indeed', 'be', 'inmates', 'fact', 'actresses', 'covered', 'wide', 'range', 'real', 'world', 'body', 'shapes', 'makeup', 'department', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'well', 'such', 'Pennsatucky', 'who', 'teeth', 'due', 'former', 'drug', 'addicted', 'lifestyle', 'gave', 'more', 'realistic', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tempting', 'higher', 'ratings', 'lot', 'US', 'made', 'shows', 'have', 'done', 'past', 'just', 'fill', 'show', 'hot', 'women', 'think', 'show', ""didn't.The"", 'initial', 'episodes', 'obviously', 'concentrate', 'heavily', 'Piper', 'blond', 'surburban', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'plans', 'be', 'married', 'younger', 'days', 'caught', 'up', 'obviously', 'fish', 'water', 'even', 'read', 'up', 'prison', 'life', 'reality', 'off', 'side', 'inmates', 'get', 'go', 'Not', 'helping', 'cause', 'off', 'unwittingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'here', 'rest', 'vibe', 'husband', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'case', 'either', 'season', 'became', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'started', 'learn', 'backstories', 'got', 'know', 'other', 'characters', 'bit', 'more', 'episode', 'plots', 'took', 'up', 'more', 'time', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'plot', 'one', 'episode', 'prison', 'setting', 'high', 'security', 'one', 'where', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'due', 'missing', 'screwdriver', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'stab', 'guard', 'other', 'prisoner', 'track', 'then', 'rest', 'time', 'minimum', 'security', 'facility', 'where', 'everyone', 'can', 'go', 'wherever', 'want', 'such', 'fact', 'anyone', 'can', 'just', 'walk', 'kitchen', 'anytime', 'where', 'range', 'knives', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'man', 'character', 'scissors', 'cut', 'hair', 'cell', 'anyone', 'be', 'able', 'walk', 'things', 'did', 'wonder', 'former', 'man', 'inmate', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'allowed', 'do', 'time', 'women', 'prison', 'just', ""'d"", 'had', 'something', 'removed', 'Would', 'snitch', 'really', 'be', 'same', 'prison', 'person', 'gave', 'up', 'who', 'got', 'sent', 'there', 'too', 'Would', 'mother', 'daughter', 'really', 'be', 'sentenced', 'same', 'facility', 'things', 'do', 'add', 'fun', 'plot', 'who', 'perhaps', 'do', 'indeed', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'prison.Orange', 'New', 'Black', 'interesting', 'title', 'show', 'considering', 'inmates', 'prison', 'only', 'wear', 'orange', ""'re"", 'being', 'processed', 'first', 'days', 'guess', 'more', 'catchy', 'light', 'brown', 'new', 'black', 'also', 'nice', 'extras', 'come', 'DVD', 'episode', 'commentary', 'few', 'also', 'few', 'short', 'documentaries', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'interviewed', 'get', 'see', 'teeth', 'speak', 'own', 'country', 'accent', 'so', 'forth', 'where', 'talk', 'show', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'Piper', 'interviewed', 'also', 'gag', 'reel', 'episodes', 'documentary', 'extras', 'take', 'up', 'around', '12', 'hours', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'front', 'too']",N/A

1692676,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00HW3ELGW,J. Martin,"[2, 31]","I can think of two reasons to watch a TV series: I enjoy the characters (either like or dislike them, or both) and become interested in what happens to them (The Simpsons comes to mind); or something about the series arouses a more or less sexual response in me. Sports bore me to death, but I loved Friday Night Lights because so many of the guys were gorgeous. This series neither entertains me nor turns me on.I'm a gay male, and nothing about the female body or female sexuality excites me; in fact, it turns me off. So just the idea of a women's prison doesn't automatically get my juices flowing, and the abundant nudity and sex in this series leaves me cold and irritated. On top of that, every single character in this series is annoying, from the leads to the very least of the supporting roles.Piper Chapman is so obnoxious that she deserves far worse than what she gets here; I'd keep watching if I thought she'd eventually (hoping for sooner rather than later) get bumped off, but I know she won't.

Piper must leave her soon to be husband and friends and start a completely different life.

The first season was somewhat interesting, high character-driven with many plots and held my interest. However, this season is just plain stupid and insults my intelligence. Why the back and forth, on and off relationships of Piper's boyfriend and her girlfriend continue does not make any sense at all. And I'm sorry, I hardly find it believable that there are such strong personalities in the penal system who arbitrary speak out in every context and are allowed to get away with it. I also find it ludicrous about the loose subject material on each episode (where the urethra is, actual evolvement of guard-prisoner sex affair? Not likely, and the ongoing lesbian scenes are just becoming repetitive and repulsive to me). The script-writing is over-kill, these inmates come up with words and knowledge that are supposed to be witty, when you know in reality, women prisoners would not even have that vocabulary.No thanks, the first season was semi-interesting, this season just plain sucks. It has been a total waste of my time to watch it, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I happen to have inside information about correctional institutions as I have been writing to a female friend for many years, who has been incarcerated twice now. She does not tell me about jail parties they have, in-house newsletters they write and the ongoing social relationships they all have with each other. You better believe the truth of the fact is that these women are basically alone, do not trust anyone and are in fear of breaking ""any rule"" for their good time will be marked off. And most of them are hurting, feel very ashamed and I repeat very, very alone.Big boos to the producers, the writers and the cast of this once again, utterly stupid and not credible drama. It seems to me, that it is just exposure for a bunch of actors who are ""overacting"" to begin with and show off. The first season hooked me only because I know about prison environments from writing to my friend, this season dropped me off the hook and left me cold.Once more, this is Hollywood ""fluff"" and utter nonsense.

1692679,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00HW3ELGW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 15]","As Netflix became the most buzz-worthy network (or non-network) of 2013, the premiere of ""Orange is the New Black"" may not have had the build-up of ""House of Cards"" or ""Arrested Development."" But that's a good thing! With enormous hype or expectations, a show can elicit instantaneous backlash if those initial anticipations aren't met. ""Orange is the New Black"" is the latest endeavor by ""Weeds"" creator Jenji Kohan and part of its immense appeal is that you don't know exactly what to expect from the get-go. In fact, the plot is almost a bait-and-switch. You sign on for a show about a privileged white woman being put in prison. Part comedy/part drama, this is the ultimate fish-out-of-water saga as Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling playing a variation on co-creator Piper Kerman's real life story) adjusts to a world beyond her imagining. What the show becomes, however, is a true character ensemble about the women she encounters. Filled with fascinating characters and spot-on performances, ""Orange is the New Black"" is certainly one of my favorite new programs of 2013 because it serves much more in terms of story telling, emotional heft, and incisive humor than you have any reason to expect it will.The DVD/Blu-ray sets will be released in four disc editions featuring all 13 episodes of Season One. Co-creators Kohan and Kerman will both be closely involved with the Bonus Features and offer exclusive content and commentary. Included in the Special features are:4 Featurettes:New Kid on the Cell BlockMother Hen: Red Runs the CoupIt's TribalPrison RulesGag ReelAudio Commentaries with Creator/Producer Jenji Kohan, Writer/Producer Tara Herrmann and Producer Mark BurleyDigital UltraViolet copies of each episodesThe story begins with Schilling turning herself over to the prison system after a trafficking charge from many years prior catches up with her. Although she has become a model citizen with her fiance Jason Biggs, she led a more colorful life with a former flame (Laura Prepon). One of the things I admired about ""Orange is the New Black"" is that they clearly make Schilling a criminal who should be accountable for her actions and don't gloss over this fact to make her more sympathetic. As she starts life on the inside, she meets the usual hardships: unwanted advances, power struggles, finding her place in this new microcosm. Soon, however, we see that Schilling is part of a much bigger story. Every inmate she encounters has a back story as well, and as the season progresses--we get to see how those tales unfold.This is where Kohan has really succeeded. The show's screenplays are intricate and enlightening and give even peripheral characters the opportunity to shine. There are so many stand-out characters (familiar names include Kate Mulgrew, Taryn Manning, Pablo Schreiber, Natasha Lyonne), it would be impossible to highlight everyone who is spectacularly effective in these episodes. For me (and for many it seems) a particular star making turn is given by Uzo Aduba, known only as Crazy Eyes in early episodes. Not every character is likable, but the show attempts to make you understand their journey. It is both smart and empathetic and the cast is one of the strongest that I've seen in some time. I came for Schilling's story, but soon found her one of the less interesting characters!Although the show has great emotional impact and character development, I don't want to make it sound like a chore. For first and foremost, ""Orange is the New Black"" is also enormously funny. It's not a politically correct humor, to be sure, but it feels incredibly true to life. One of the season's highlights involves the various prison cabals stereotyping other racial groups prior to the election of inmate representatives. It is so offensive, so hilarious, and so true all at the same time. It might have been the single funniest scene of my TV season so far.Funny, original, insightful, and moving, ""Orange is the New Black"" is one of those shows meant to be discovered and appreciated as a true find. While Netflix's revival of ""Arrested Development"" stole the pre-release buzz, this prison dramady has become the network's sleeper hit. Season Two is on the way. Now is the time to catch up with a great adult character driven show with much heart and much humor.

The show is mainly about a privileged white female who can do no wrong that is placed into prison. She is out of place in prison because she is a privileged white female and innocent. She is trapped in an odd place around people of other ethnicities that belong there more than her because she is a privileged white female. All of the other inmates trail right behind whatever Hollywood stereotypes you want to place them in. This show is mainly the view of prison from the privileged white perspective. That is the theme that the show mainly follows.You take that and throw in some other trending topics like gay rights and throw in a lesbian relationship and some transgenders and there you go. My mind just isn't numb enough to ignore the obvious about this show and the audience it's targeted at. To anyone with even one quarter of a brain this series is offensive on many levels. Even to people that work in prisons it's offensive to how the system is actually ran. Calling this a &#34;comedy&#34; must be a play on the word &#34;ignorant&#34;. This is an ignorant show for ignorant people. In the real world prison is made up of different types of people and privileged white female would be 1 of 1,000 other women behind bars with the similar story of drug trafficking so she would fit right in. What I dislike the most about this series that it makes the statement of if you're white and privileged you don't belong behind bars even if you commit a crime.It's more so about that than a woman going to prison for the first time. This is right on par with the logic of the real Piper Kermans who this show is loosely about. Being a citizen of privileged white society does not excuse you from punishment for breaking the law. These &#34;other&#34; people belong here but you don't because you can make hand soaps and lotions. Let's skip that and get back to the drugs you smuggled and why it's a crime and where those drugs end up and the lives they destroy. Obviously this movie turns its cheek to that and so does Piper Kerman. She received an extremely light sentence due to being white and privileged for her crimes to which &#34;others&#34; not in the same boat would have spent 8-10 years in prison. After her &#34;tap&#34; on the wrists this is her story and if you'd ask me I'd rather watch turds float in a public restroom.If this show was actually about a woman accepting responsibility for her crime and coping with the time she had to do and they removed the stereotypes it almost might be worth watching.If they had the transgender, lesbian relationships in there as a part of the prison life and not as &#34;Let's throw this in your face to get the support of the gay community&#34; than I wouldn't bother bringing up the obvious.It's hard to pretend that this show isn't about a privileged white woman thrown in prison amongst minorities from broken homes and now her world is turned upside down as she has left her white privilege bubble to do 1.5years in prison.This is a comedy? For who? Reminds me of those late  mid - late 90's movies that would feature a Caucasian male that would have to join up with a group of African Americans for sake of whatever the shallow movie plot would be and the first thing they'd have him do is flip his hat backwards and start using slang. It was supposed to be funny and entertaining to see a usually upper class white male acting like a &#34;homeboy&#34;...

Bullions,"[21, 32]","When a fan loses a beloved TV show, it happens one of two ways: one, when it&#8217;s not the right time for it to end, and everything feels kind of rushed. In this way, a fan&#8217;s &#8220;breakup&#8221; with a show can feel bitter and resentful. But when a show has run past its prime, yet came back with a brilliant final season, the way Jenji Kohan&#8217;s &#8220;Weeds&#8221; did, in 2012, the fan isn&#8217;t left bitter and angry. We saw these characters, whom we&#8217;ve loved and hated throughout the years, come to a conclusion that was bittersweet, but felt right. I feel like series creator Jenji Kohan felt a void in her heart after &#8220;Weeds&#8221; ended. But like any other working person, she needed a new project.Kohan has talked about how when season seven of &#8220;Weeds&#8221; was starting, she wanted to do a &#8220;women-in-prison&#8221; season, but decided against it because it would break up the family dynamic that the show had for the previous six seasons. Season 7 of &#8220;Weeds&#8221; was probably the lowest point, creatively, of the entire series. But when the show was awarded a surprise eighth season, she didn&#8217;t let fans down.In the back of her mind, Kohan was already conceptualizing &#8220;Orange is the New Black,&#8221; a series based on the best-selling memoir by Piper Kerman. Since Jenji left me with a brilliant final season of &#8220;Weeds,&#8221; I vowed to follow whatever she wrote in the future. I expected &#8220;Orange&#8221; to more or less be Kohan&#8217;s &#8216;rebound project&#8217; from &#8220;Weeds&#8221;, if you will. I expected the feeling for this to still feel like &#8220;Weeds&#8221;, but be a little different.Jeez, was I wrong.&#8220;Orange is the New Black&#8221; is such a silly title for such a serious and affecting show. We follow Piper Chapman (a different name than the memoirist, for reasons that we&#8217;ll get to later), a WASP-y and successful Manhattanite who was a wild child in her glory days. She worked alongside her then-lesbian lover Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), who worked for an international drug cartel. Ten years later, the statute of limitations for her crime is almost over (12 years), and she&#8217;d long forgotten about the whole thing. She and her fianc&eacute; get a knock on the door one day, telling her that everyone in the cartel has gone down. She can either go to trial, or surrender to 15 months in federal prison.Each character who she meets on the inside has her own superbly written backstory. Every one of them is flawed and complicated. The show is less about Piper&#8217;s existential journey while behind bars, and more about the fascinating people, good and bad, who she meets there. There are so many fantastically written female characters in this one show, that even I was caught a little off guard.Standouts of the supporting cast include Kate Mulgrew, as the inmate who runs the kitchen, nicknamed Red. Her backstory is probably the most interesting, since she has obvious mafia connections, but it&#8217;s not completely drawn out as to how she wound up behind bars. Mulgrew is fantastic in this part, as a vicious, tough-as-nails broad who is really vulnerable and human at the same time. Also, Laura Prepon is excellent as Alex, who becomes an ally to Piper, even as she&#8217;s the reason that she wound up behind bars.Also, Natasha Lyonne, of the &#8220;American Pie&#8221; series, is superb comic relief as Nicky, who is the one character who&#8217;s automatically likable. Laverne Cox plays male-female transgender inmate Sophia, who is one of the best characters in the series. Sophia&#8217;s the subject to a lot of inhumane treatment, when she is denied medications that might slowly erase all of the work she&#8217;s done to become a woman. Even characters who seem like they&#8217;re not that pivotal to the story are. In each episode, we explore a different character&#8217;s backstory, and they&#8217;re all vastly different, and superbly fascinating.Another thing I admire about Kohan&#8217;s approach is that she&#8217;s not scared to show the ugly side of prison. Corrupt guards and sketchy prison counselors rule with an iron fist, and every inmate is in a gang &#8211; tribal stuff &#8211; the blacks, the whites, the Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, old people, teenagers, what have you. There&#8217;s a mother and a daughter, both there for different crimes. And a prison guard is carrying on an affair with an inmate, which is surprisingly one of the happiest subplots in the whole show. It&#8217;s surprising that this is really how it is in a federal prison.In one excellent episode, we explore how different life is in solitary confinement, versus minimum security prison. In SHU (short for &#8220;special housing unit&#8221;) a person is treated like an animal. They&#8217;re quite literally in a box, with a metal toilet and a cot, where they are completely cut off from other people. They&#8217;re fed a loaf of tasteless food, which has enough nutritional value to keep someone alive, but is completely disgusting. I did some research on my own about how accurate this is, and shockingly, it&#8217;s all true. SHU is very real, and it&#8217;s horrific.One reason why this show really does work is because of Taylor Schilling. In an actress whose work I&#8217;d never seen, I wasn&#8217;t expecting much. But Schilling is a dynamic actress and brings a great deal of depth to the character of Piper Chapman. She&#8217;s so unlikable at one point, and we&#8217;re rooting for her in others. I don&#8217;t really like the relationship with her fiance Larry (Jason Biggs), but Schilling never lets the viewer forget that there&#8217;s more than meets the eye. Also, there&#8217;s a reason why the character&#8217;s name is Piper Chapman, rather than the real-life Piper Kerman. These are two different stories. Chapman and Kerman are not the same woman. This allows Kohan and Schilling to create subplots and other story elements that may not have happened to the real woman. This is no docudrama.In 13 hour-long episodes, Jenji Kohan creates a vast new world and a slew of extraordinarily interesting characters. I had read the book, by Piper Kerman, before watching the series. If this had been a straight adaptation of the novel, it would have been over by episode 13. The series probably covered three months of time in its first season, so clearly this show could run for a while, even with the obvious endgame. If it continues to be this good, it should go on for as long as possible.I was very surprised at how dark &#8220;Orange&#8221; got in its later episodes. Because of this, the show only becomes more compelling, the longer it goes on. With a Netflix subscription, viewers have the option to watch each episode in a row. I tried to make &#8220;Orange&#8221; last as long as I could, because I truly enjoyed being around these characters. Each episode was more interesting than the last, and it truly ended with a bang. I can&#8217;t wait to see where it goes.",5,"""Orange"" gleefully rewrites television rules...",1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,7018,"['When', 'fan', 'beloved', 'TV', 'show', 'one', 'two', 'ways',

I read the book, and found it a telling picture of a young woman from a very good family, educated at Smith, found herself caught up in an affair with a woman and moving money around the world for a big time crook. She ended up in a woman's prison in Connecticut. Her life in those 18 months is very well documented, and it has become a televised series on Netflix.This is the perfect vehicle for this type of story. A story rich in the various shades of color, races, nationalities and all started by a young white woman. This is their storyline rising and we have been able to see the inside of their lives in prison and on the outside in the real world.Junji Kohan is the creator and writer of this series showing Piper's life and interweaving everyone else's stories therein. We have a privileged white woman being put in prison, Piper Chapman, played by Taylor Schilling. The show evolves into a character ensemble about the women prisoners. The actors except for Laura Prepon and Kate Mulgrew are all new to us, black, brown white and yellow. This is a story of every woman who has gone wrong and what occurs inside the prison walls. We also meet Piper's fianc&eacute;, Larry, played by Jason Biggs, and his life as he tries to soldier on, supporting Piper and finding his life. And, then there are the Correctional Officers, their stories and their lives. The female warden who is a witch and who may have some sorry of questionable activities on the side.I am in the middle of Year 2 of this series, and it gets better very quickly. I love this series, realistic, funny, sad and true life all the way.

I haven&#8217;t watched Weeds yet, so I was in for a surprise with Orange.One surprise was seeing Kate Mulgrew as the character, Red!  When I first saw her, she was an actor on the soap, Ryan&#8217;s Hope, who went on to play Captain Janeway on Star Trek Voyager.  She is a great actor and helps make this show stellar. The main character is played by Taylor Schilling, who gives a great performance as the nervous, forlorn, mistreated prison inmate, Piper Chapman. Immediately conspicuous for her skin-color and prissy attitudes, she is an easy target which some inmates delight in tormenting, while others are drawn to her helplessness. There are slices from all walks of life among the inmate population and the character development of each persona is excellent.  Flashbacks allow viewers to experience the behind-the-scenes disadvantages and experiences that each character has encountered.  This enables the viewer to better empathize with the ill-mannered behavior, social deviance, odd quirks, or outright meanness exhibited by the various characters. The show is a character driven series and makes for its audience to be able to identify with one or another nuance of the wide array of characters.I, for one, could do without the nudity, raunchiness, and language of this show and others like it such as Deadwood (I did not watch after 1st episode), True Blood, and Game of Thrones (I&#8217;m an avid fan despite the raunchiness). Still, I tolerate it since I have little choice and television/movies can still be masterpieces despite the crude elements. Orange, however, would be remiss if it didn&#8217;t convey the naked vulnerability, setting starkness & lack of privacy experienced by inmates. As an audience, you may be offended by this up-in-your-face display yet it lends an authenticity to the show, which the audience experiences in shock & empathy, making it all the more credible.Highly recommended!",5,A quirky drama with elements of comedy & excellent character development,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2044,"['had', 'already', 'seen', 'Netflix', '8217', 'House', 'Cards', 'didn', '8217', 'care', 'hubby', 'daughter', 'loved', 'haven', '8217', 'watched', 'Weeds', 'yet', 'was', 'surprise', 'Orange.One', 'surprise', 'was', 'seeing', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'character', 'Red', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'actor', 'soap', 'Ryan', '8217', 'Hope', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'great', 'actor', 'make', 'show', 'stellar', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'who', 'great', 'performance', 'nervous', 'forlorn', 'mistreated', 'prison', 'inmate', 'Piper', 'Chapman', 'Immediately', 'conspicuous', 'skin-color', 'prissy', 'attitudes', 'easy', 'target', 'inmates', 'delight', 'tormenting', 'others', 'are', 'drawn', 'helplessness', 'are', 'slices', 'walks', 'life', 'inmate', 'population', 'character', 'development', 'persona', 'excellent', 'Flashbacks', 'allow', 'viewers', 'experience', 'behind-the-scenes', 'disadvantages', 'experiences', 'character', 'encountered', 'viewer', 'better', 'empathize', 'ill-mannered', 'behavior', 'social', 'deviance', 'odd', 'quirks', 'outright', 'meanness', 'exhibited', 'various', 'characters', 'show', 'character', 'driven', 'series', 'audience', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'one', 'nuance', 'wide', 'array', 'characters.I', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'nudity', 'raunchiness', 'language', 'show', 'others', 'such', 'Deadwood', 'did', 'not', 'watch', '1st', 'episode', 'True', 'Blood', 'Game', 'Thrones', '8217', 'avid', 'fan', 'raunchiness', 'Still', 'tolerate', 'have', 'little', 'choice', 'television/movies', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'masterpieces', 'crude', 'elements', 'Orange', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', '8217', 'convey', 'naked', 'vulnerability', 'setting', 'starkness', 'lack', 'privacy', 'experienced', 'inmates', 'audience', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'up-in-your-face', 'display', 'yet', 'authenticity', 'show', 'audience', 'experiences', 'shock', 'empathy', 'making', 'more', 'credible.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

It's not the prison life that's unsettling. I worked in prisons for a few years. You get used to the constant unhappiness, the violence, and the general crude attitudes of everyone. What makes this show uncomfortable is that it makes you watch it through the eyes of the main character, who is completely out of place in this environment. You don't just feel sorry for her, you feel her own sorrow and discomfort.I think what really sucks you in is how real the show feels. It directly shows the mindless bureaucracy of government systems, the crudeness of prison life, and accurately portrays how an outsider would function when dropped into this world.And you feel bad for the main character for being there over a crime committed 10 years prior. She really draws you in and makes you empathize with her, so you feel immediately connected with her. That's the hook of the show.I actually don't want to watch more because it's uncomfortable to see a character you connect to be so miserable, but at the same time I can't wait to see what happens and if she's okay.Update:Since I wrote that initial review I've gotten most of the way through Season 1. The show does not disappoint as it moves forward. It keeps the viewer mentally in the prison with the characters so you feel like you are experiencing all of Chapman's (the main character) emotions and triumphs.

But WOW...the wait is over and what an awesome, funny, heart-breaking and down to earth series this is.Strong women...I love powerful women who live life with gusto...and this show has so many different characters that this was an awesome buffet for the eyes and ears. Well written and performed by all...with the men around them providing almost comic relief and making the female characters seem that much more dominant.I can't wait for the next season!!***** 5 ***** &#34;jailhouse rock stars&#34;",5,OMG!!!!

First off if you haven't seen the wire and you think this is the best then do your self a favor and appreciate the best show ever made. This is just about some dumb girl who smokes pot and decides too go to jail because she got too bored of watching half baked and not working. It got very boring quick.
