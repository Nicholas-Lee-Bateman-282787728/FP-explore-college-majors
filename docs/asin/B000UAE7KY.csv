1094060,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000UAE7KY,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[8, 10]","In Albert Camus's famous novel, `The Stranger,' the protagonist smokes a cigarette before he is executed and brusquely passes off any attempts to distract him from his last little experience of pleasure.  That scene came to my mind while watching Julia Lokler's myopic little gem, `Day Night Day Night'.  So it doesn't surprise me that, while glancing at the product description afterwards, the movie is described as an award-winning ""existential"" movie.Throughout her film, she uniquely turns up the sound in the scenes that lead to the film's confrontation and climax.  Whether bathing or eating an apple, we hear the volume turned up to a remarkable degree.  At first I naively thought that this was random.  Alternately, it either irritated me or unintentionally made me laugh, but I soon discovered the movie's genius.  Generically named, ""She"" (Luisa Williams), is trained to be a terrorist.  At the tender age of 19, she is presented merely as a child, someone who is a molded ""jihadist"" ready to die for her cause.  Sent to a motel room in New Jersey, she is prepared with every detail by her adult comrades who ready her with a bomb attached in her backpack, soon to be sent to blow up civilians in Times Square in New York City.We aren't given too much about her intentions or motivations, but it is revealed that both parents have died, and she is left like a vulnerable child.  Some of the indoctrination reminded me of the Patty Hearst controversy; even though I reserve judgment for that whole debacle.  ""She"" is certainly younger and more impressionable than Hearst possibly was, but her isolation is clearly presented.  What better way to show a potential casualty of terror than with a needy orphan?  The volume is turned up in more ways than one as we come upon a martyr candidate who draws her inspiration from a desperate hopelessness.There's one scene in the movie that I found particularly cogent.  As she walks through the streets of Time's Square, she comes across a street vendor selling toy, mechanical puppies.  She tenderly pets one of the stuffed toys, which moves across the sidewalk in programmed fashion.  I kept thinking also of a prominent news magazine portrait of a Palestinian girl who made herself a walking time bomb, waiting to destroy and maim her Israeli neighbors.`Day Night Day Night' is an unsettling movie that gets it right in sociology, psychology, and extrapolation as a plausible nightmare that could happen just about any where and at any time by someone who dates despair in an unsettling way.  Potentially unnerving and depressing, the movie has the redeeming quality of having the audience cling to all forms of hope found at one's disposal.",4,A Portrait in Hopelessness,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,2695,"['Albert', 'Camus', 'famous', 'novel', 'Stranger', 'protagonist', 'cigarette', 'executed', 'brusquely', 'passes', 'attempts', 'distract', 'last', 'little', 'experience', 'pleasure', 'scene', 'came', 'mind', 'watching', 'Julia', 'Lokler', 'myopic', 'little', 'gem', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'glancing', 'product', 'description', 'afterwards', 'movie', 'described', 'award-winning', 'existential', 'film', 'uniquely', 'up', 'sound', 'scenes', 'lead', 'film', 'confrontation', 'climax', 'bathing', 'eating', 'apple', 'hear', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', 'remarkable', 'degree', 'first', 'naively', 'thought', 'was', 'random', 'Alternately', 'either', 'irritated', 'unintentionally', 'made', 'laugh', 'soon', 'discovered', 'movie', 'genius', 'Generically', 'named', 'Luisa', 'Williams', 'trained', 'be', 'terrorist', 'tender', 'age', '19', 'presented', 'merely', 'child', 'someone', 'who', 'molded', 'jihadist', 'ready', 'die', 'cause', 'Sent', 'motel', 'room', 'New', 'Jersey', 'prepared', 'detail', 'adult', 'comrades', 'who', 'ready', 'bomb', 'attached', 'backpack', 'soon', 'be', 'sent', 'blow', 'up', 'civilians', 'Times', 'Square', 'New', 'York', 'City.We', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'too', 'much', 'intentions', 'motivations', 'revealed', 'parents', 'have', 'died', 'left', 'vulnerable', 'child', 'indoctrination', 'reminded', 'Patty', 'Hearst', 'controversy', 'even', 'reserve', 'judgment', 'whole', 'debacle', 'certainly', 'younger', 'more', 'impressionable', 'Hearst', 'possibly', 'was', 'isolation', 'clearly', 'presented', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'show', 'potential', 'casualty', 'terror', 'needy', 'orphan', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'come', 'martyr', 'candidate', 'who', 'inspiration', 'desperate', 'hopelessness.There', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'found', 'particularly', 'cogent', 'streets', 'Time', 'Square', 'street', 'vendor', 'selling', 'toy', 'mechanical', 'puppies', 'tenderly', 'pets', 'one', 'stuffed', 'toys', 'sidewalk', 'programmed', 'fashion', 'kept', 'thinking', 'also', 'prominent', 'news', 'magazine', 'portrait', 'Palestinian', 'girl', 'who', 'made', 'walking', 'time', 'bomb', 'waiting', 'destroy', 'maim', 'Israeli', 'neighbors.', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'unsettling', 'movie', 'right', 'sociology', 'psychology', 'extrapolation', 'plausible', 'nightmare', 'could', 'happen', 'just', 'where', 'time', 'someone', 'who', 'despair', 'unsettling', 'way', 'Potentially', 'unnerving', 'depressing', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'having', 'audience', 'cling', 'forms', 'hope', 'found', 'one', 'disposal']",N/A
1094061,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000UAE7KY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Day Night Day Night is NOT going to be everyone's cup of tea (for a variety of reasons).  It's understandably a sensitive issue despite 9/11 occurring 12 years ago, and the way the plot rolls along demands *all* of your attention or you WILL get bored.  This is one movie where the description is exactly what you see- a young woman with a bomb inside her backpack walks through New York City ready to detonate it at any moment.  However... things happen along the way and well, I'm not releasing anymore information and spoilers pertaining to the final 35 minutes.The first half is devoted to the young lady confidently making sure every measure she takes to assure the detonation of the bomb is a success.  She pretty much locks herself away from society and goes over the entire routine to make sure she doesn't miss a single beat.  Quite frankly, it seems disturbingly accurate and makes me nauseous.  She has to repeat certain notes to herself including birthdays and other important things, to make sure she's mentally focused.  It's pretty shocking, however if you're expecting lots of suspense you'll be sorely disappointed.  It's not a suspenseful film in that you'll see deaths and explosions around every corner, but the build-up is *extremely* intense for the potential realism (at least, realistic in that this is arguably how most of us believe such a plan would be executed).  Walking around eating all kinds of diverse foods?  Makes sense, since this is supposed to be her last meal.I can't help but get caught up in the emotions.  As a viewer and someone with compassion, you really want to stop this girl (played by Luisa Williams) from going through with it as much as humanly possible.  You wish there was a way to explain how meaningful life can be if given the opportunity to survive.  You want to know she can be loved and appreciated and setting off the bomb will only cause tremendous heartache for everyone.  This is the meaning I got out of it, anyway.  At first she seems confident and willing to go through with it without a problem, however eventually her emotions get in the way.  I really don't want to say anything more- just watch it.  Needless to say, Luisa Williams is incredible in this role.With all this said, the ending will probably be a major disappointment on many levels.  Without spoiling it, something better could have occurred.  Highly recommended.",5,"despite the ending, fantastic",1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,2396,"['Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'NOT', 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'variety', 'reasons', 'understandably', 'sensitive', 'issue', '9/11', 'occurring', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'way', 'plot', 'rolls', 'demands', '*all*', 'attention', 'WILL', 'get', 'bored', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'description', 'exactly', 'what', 'see-', 'young', 'woman', 'bomb', 'backpack', 'walks', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'ready', 'detonate', 'moment', 'However', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'releasing', 'anymore', 'information', 'spoilers', 'pertaining', 'final', '35', 'minutes.The', 'first', 'half', 'devoted', 'young', 'lady', 'confidently', 'making', 'sure', 'measure', 'assure', 'detonation', 'bomb', 'success', 'pretty', 'much', 'locks', 'away', 'society', 'entire', 'routine', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'miss', 'single', 'beat', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'disturbingly', 'accurate', 'nauseous', 'repeat', 'certain', 'notes', 'herself', 'including', 'birthdays', 'other', 'important', 'things', 'make', 'sure', 'mentally', 'focused', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'however', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'lots', 'suspense', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'deaths', 'explosions', 'corner', 'build-up', '*extremely*', 'intense', 'potential', 'realism', 'least', 'realistic', 'arguably', 'how', 'most', 'believe', 'plan', 'would', 'be', 'executed', 'Walking', 'eating', 'kinds', 'diverse', 'foods', 'Makes', 'sense', 'supposed', 'be', 'last', 'meal.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'someone', 'compassion', 'really', 'want', 'stop', 'girl', 'played', 'Luisa', 'Williams', 'going', 'as', 'much', 'humanly', 'possible', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'explain', 'how', 'meaningful', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'opportunity', 'survive', 'want', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'loved', 'appreciated', 'setting', 'off', 'bomb', 'will', 'only', 'cause', 'tremendous', 'heartache', 'everyone', 'meaning', 'got', 'anyway', 'first', 'confident', 'willing', 'go', 'problem', 'however', 'eventually', 'emotions', 'get', 'way', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'anything', 'more-', 'just', 'watch', 'Needless', 'say', 'Luisa', 'Williams', 'incredible', 'role.With', 'said', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'major', 'disappointment', 'many', 'levels', 'spoiling', 'something', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1094063,AO4A961ZKHJPL,B000UAE7KY,"Enrique Torres ""Rico""","[3, 4]","I had high hopes for this movie, considering it was a 2007 Independent Spirit Awards nominee; it didn't win and maybe I should have known then that the movie was a close but no cigar film. I was ready for something gripping, intense, edge-of-your-seat type portrayl of someone about to commit an act of terrorism. Instead I was bored with the tedium, over extended scenes where the point is made, again and again and again, I might as well throw in one more again just to emphasize the point; just in case you didn't get it. One such scene was where the fellow hooded terrorists have her repeat her new identity over and over for what seems like fifteen minutes but was probably more like five at the most. Other examples of this tedious attention to detail were the scenes when she is eating. Seriously  I do not need to see every little bite. Now let's talk about the sondtrack. Am I boring you? Sorry, I am just trying to convey some of the feel of the movie, booooooring. Oh yeah ,the soundtrack; there is none except raw sounds of Times Square and mumble jumbo hotel talk that is hard at times to understand because of the accoustics of the ""reality"" sound. The first half of the movie, while she is preparing for her mission, is a snorefest. It only livens up somewhat when she hits Times Square and you hear distant conversations, blaring horns etc. In spite of the ordeal she is involved in their is very little tension felt by the audience, well, at least not by my wife and I. The tension is created by the sound of humanity on Times Square. Maybe I missed something intellectually in this movie but I was very dissapointed. A previous reviewer staed that you will either love or hate this movie. Count me on the hated it side.I don't usually feel this way but at the end of the movie I wanted my lost 94 minutes of life back.

1094065,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000UAE7KY,P. Mann,"[13, 15]","""Day Night Day Night"" seems the sort of movie that will polarize viewers. Some will love it while others will find it unbearable. I'm in the former group. The plot, alas, has been inaccurately described here by another viewer. Unfortunately, I cannot correct the error since doing so would reveal a major spoiler. I'll cite the relevant plot points.A young woman, superbly portrayed by Luisa Williams (Chacun Son Cin&eacute;ma), arrives in an American city and is picked up by a man who takes her to a hotel. She is soon visited by three men, who prepare her to be a suicide bomber. The remainder of the film deals with the woman's quest.Describing the plot, however, is grossly insufficient. ""Day Night Day Night"" is an extremely slow movie, and that slowness is a huge part of the point. The camera lingers on the woman as she clips her toenails, washes her clothing in the hotel sink, or shaves her armpits. At other points, the filmmakers elevate certain sounds, especially the sounds of the woman's eating and of ambient conversations. It certainly would be possible to fast-forward through some of these spots without losing any sense of what happens, but to do so would be, I believe, to miss the point.That point, as I understand it, is that the woman is human. Yes, she is planning a murderous act, but she is also human. Her target, we know, is an American city, but we do not know why. As she prepares for her attack, she does the thoroughly normal things that we all do. She bathes, turns on lights in her hotel room, and performs other mundane tasks. She is, it seems, the antithesis of Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle (fromTaxi Driver). And yet she seems so calmly prepared for her mission. (Here, comparisons to Camus's Mersault inThe Strangerare apt.) It is the utter calmness (and the civility she and her trainers show) that are the point.Finally, I would be remiss were I to allow Luisa Williams's performance to pass without further comment. There are almost no characters other than the woman who have both lines and their faces on screen. That leaves Williams to carry the film. Her job is further complicated by the fact that she has very few lines for someone who is onscreen for almost every minute of the film. Those lines that she does have are banal. There's no ""Make my day"" or even ""Rosebud"" here. Nobody is going to quote lines from this movie. Nonetheless, Williams delivers an astonishingly powerful performance, expressing volumes without speaking. Her understated performance alone earns this movie a fifth star from me.",5,This is probably a love it or hate it film,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2553,"['Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'sort', 'movie', 'will', 'polarize', 'viewers', 'will', 'love', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'unbearable', ""'m"", 'former', 'group', 'plot', 'alas', 'been', 'inaccurately', 'described', 'here', 'viewer', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'correct', 'error', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'reveal', 'major', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'cite', 'relevant', 'plot', 'points.A', 'young', 'woman', 'superbly', 'portrayed', 'Luisa', 'Williams', 'Chacun', 'Son', 'Cin', 'eacute', 'ma', 'American', 'city', 'picked', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'hotel', 'soon', 'visited', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'prepare', 'be', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'remainder', 'film', 'deals', 'woman', 'quest.Describing', 'plot', 'however', 'grossly', 'insufficient', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'extremely', 'slow', 'movie', 'slowness', 'huge', 'part', 'point', 'camera', 'woman', 'toenails', 'clothing', 'hotel', 'sink', 'armpits', 'other', 'points', 'filmmakers', 'elevate', 'certain', 'sounds', 'especially', 'sounds', 'woman', 'eating', 'ambient', 'conversations', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'fast-forward', 'spots', 'losing', 'sense', 'what', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'believe', 'miss', 'point.That', 'point', 'understand', 'woman', 'human', 'Yes', 'planning', 'murderous', 'act', 'also', 'human', 'target', 'know', 'American', 'city', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'attack', 'thoroughly', 'normal', 'things', 'do', 'lights', 'hotel', 'room', 'other', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'antithesis', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'fromTaxi', 'Driver', 'yet', 'so', 'calmly', 'prepared', 'mission', 'Here', 'comparisons', 'Camus', 'Mersault', 'inThe', 'Strangerare', 'apt', 'utter', 'calmness', 'civility', 'trainers', 'show', 'are', 'point.Finally', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'were', 'allow', 'Luisa', 'Williams', 'performance', 'pass', 'further', 'comment', 'are', 'almost', 'characters', 'other', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'lines', 'screen', 'Williams', 'carry', 'film', 'job', 'further', 'complicated', 'fact', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'someone', 'who', 'onscreen', 'almost', 'minute', 'film', 'lines', 'have', 'are', 'banal', 'Make', 'day', 'even', 'Rosebud', 'here', 'Nobody', 'going', 'quote', 'lines', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'Williams', 'astonishingly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'expressing', 'volumes', 'speaking', 'understated', 'performance', 'alone', 'movie', 'fifth', 'star']",N/A
1094066,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000UAE7KY,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","****1/2When Hannah Arendt coined the expression ""the banality of evil,"" surely she must have had something like ""Day Night Day Night"" in mind.  With chilling detachment, this brilliant and terrifying film chronicles the last 48 hours in the life of a potential suicide bomber. It is a topic rife with all sorts of potential pitfalls, both political and cinematic, yet the movie succeeds as a work of art because it never resorts to sensationalism or exploitation to get its point across.Filmmaker Julia Loktey has deliberately eliminated any back story that might explain why a beautiful young girl like ""Leah"" would be willing to perform an action as inconceivable and incomprehensible as the one she has planned here.  The whys and the wherefores are really of little concern to Loktey.  Instead, she has chosen to concentrate on the almost strikingly banal, step-by-step process ""Leah"" must go through to complete the deed.  Indeed, it's amazing how, through context alone, even the most mundane of actions - brushing one's teeth, taking a bath, clipping one's toenails - can suddenly become imbued with the most terrifying significance and sense of foreboding.  It's almost as if ""Leah"" is trying to hold onto a sense of normalcy for as long as she can, savoring the minor pleasures of life that she knows she will never experience again.  In fact, in the stunning final half hour of the film, as ""Leah"" roams around the streets of New York City trying to summon up the courage to fulfill her mission, she begins to cling more and more to the simple joys of life - a mustard-covered pretzel, a candy apple - before taking that final plunge into the abyss.  What's particularly disturbing is how unfailingly sweet and polite ""Leah"" is to the people around her - be they the common pedestrians or storekeepers who could easily become her victims, or the masked men who calmly, almost apologetically, feed her instructions on what she is to do when the fateful moment arrives.  The scene in which they dress ""Leah"" up in terrorist garb and methodically ""direct"" her for a video that will be released after her death is one of the most chilling in the entire film.Luisa Williams, who is never off camera for a single moment in the film, delivers an astonishing tour-de-force performance that is guaranteed to leave the audience stunned into silence.  With very little in the way of dialogue to work with, Williams is forced to rely almost exclusively on facial expression and body language to convey a wealth of emotion.  The incongruity between the character's sweet personality and demeanor and the horrific act of violence she is about to commit throws us completely off balance and makes us call into question our own perception of the world and the way it works.Loktey employs documentary-style realism to tell her story, using her camera to record, almost as a dispassionate observer, the events as they unfold in the course of that 48-hour period.""Day Night Day Night"" contains more nerve-wracking suspense than a boatload of standard thrillers, yet it is a suspense that is honestly earned, for Loktey never stoops to implausible timing or hokey contrivance to create her effect.  This is the stuff of real life - with all its attendant unpredictability and ironies - unfolding before us.  We are forever focused on this young lady, who remains a fascinating and terrifying enigma throughout the entire hour-and-a-half that we spend with her.Stated simply, ""Day Night Day Night"" is one of the most riveting and important releases of 2007.",4,an astonishing work of art,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,3546,"['****1/2When', 'Hannah', 'Arendt', 'coined', 'expression', 'banality', 'evil', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'mind', 'chilling', 'detachment', 'brilliant', 'terrifying', 'film', 'last', '48', 'hours', 'life', 'potential', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'topic', 'rife', 'sorts', 'potential', 'pitfalls', 'political', 'cinematic', 'yet', 'movie', 'work', 'art', 'never', 'sensationalism', 'exploitation', 'get', 'point', 'across.Filmmaker', 'Julia', 'Loktey', 'deliberately', 'eliminated', 'back', 'story', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'Leah', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'perform', 'action', 'inconceivable', 'incomprehensible', 'one', 'planned', 'here', 'whys', 'wherefores', 'are', 'really', 'little', 'concern', 'Loktey', 'Instead', 'chosen', 'concentrate', 'almost', 'strikingly', 'banal', 'step-by-step', 'process', 'Leah', 'must', 'go', 'complete', 'deed', 'Indeed', 'amazing', 'how', 'context', 'alone', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'actions', 'brushing', 'one', 'teeth', 'taking', 'bath', 'clipping', 'one', 'toenails', 'can', 'suddenly', 'become', 'imbued', 'most', 'terrifying', 'significance', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'almost', 'Leah', 'trying', 'hold', 'sense', 'normalcy', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'savoring', 'minor', 'pleasures', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'experience', 'again', 'fact', 'stunning', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'Leah', 'roams', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'trying', 'summon', 'up', 'courage', 'fulfill', 'mission', 'cling', 'more', 'more', 'simple', 'joys', 'life', 'mustard-covered', 'pretzel', 'candy', 'apple', 'taking', 'final', 'plunge', 'abyss', 'What', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'how', 'unfailingly', 'sweet', 'polite', 'Leah', 'people', 'be', 'common', 'pedestrians', 'storekeepers', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'victims', 'masked', 'men', 'who', 'calmly', 'almost', 'apologetically', 'feed', 'instructions', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'fateful', 'moment', 'arrives', 'scene', 'dress', 'Leah', 'up', 'terrorist', 'garb', 'methodically', 'direct', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'death', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'entire', 'film.Luisa', 'Williams', 'who', 'never', 'off', 'camera', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'astonishing', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'guaranteed', 'leave', 'audience', 'stunned', 'silence', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'dialogue', 'work', 'Williams', 'forced', 'rely', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'facial', 'expression', 'body', 'language', 'convey', 'wealth', 'emotion', 'incongruity', 'character', 'sweet', 'personality', 'demeanor', 'horrific', 'act', 'violence', 'commit', 'throws', 'completely', 'balance', 'call', 'question', 'own', 'perception', 'world', 'way', 'documentary-style', 'realism', 'tell', 'story', 'using', 'camera', 'record', 'almost', 'dispassionate', 'observer', 'events', 'unfold', 'course', '48-hour', 'period', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'more', 'nerve-wracking', 'suspense', 'boatload', 'standard', 'thrillers', 'suspense', 'honestly', 'earned', 'Loktey', 'never', 'implausible', 'timing', 'hokey', 'contrivance', 'create', 'effect', 'stuff', 'real', 'life', 'attendant', 'unpredictability', 'ironies', 'unfolding', 'are', 'forever', 'focused', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'fascinating', 'terrifying', 'enigma', 'entire', 'hour-and-a-half', 'spend', 'her.Stated', 'simply', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'important', 'releases', '2007']",N/A
1094067,A1HK1LRON0UJ5X,B000UAE7KY,William McNeill,"[0, 0]","Though nominally a portrait of a suicide bomber, ""Day Night Day Night"" is actually a formal exercise that uses the drama inherent in terrorism to keep it from being something that might loop in the corner of an art gallery. Luisa Williams plays an unnamed timid young woman who spends the first half of the movie in a nondescript hotel room following the orders of masked handlers who blindfold her and grill her on a new identity. Their domination is eerily soft-spoken and matter-of-fact, but since Williams' character begins the movie utterly compliant it seems unnecessary. (The first third of the stylistically similar ""Upstream Color"" goes more interesting places with a similar premise.) Then she is dropped in the middle of Manhattan with a bomb, and we spend the rest of the movie watching her wander around Times Square, wondering if she'll detonate it. Because ""Day Night Day Night"" has already signaled that it is a mood piece rather than a thriller, this generates very little tension. Williams is a cipher, and she and the other terrorists are all Americans with no discernible politics or emotions, so things feel pretty safe. ""Day Night Day Night"" is ""Waiting for Godot"" with no jokes and a backpack full of nails.How much you enjoy ""Day Night Day Night"" depends on what you think of it as a formal exercise, and on that front it's not bad. The claustrophobia and near silence of the first half contrasts effectively with the noisy bustle of the second. The film is mostly just a catalog of mundane details of hotel rooms and city streets, where the theoretical imminence of death gives everything an extra kick. This is cheating, but works anyway. If nothing else the film is a thorough document of what midtown Manhattan looks and sounds like at this point in time. Along the way it raises some interesting questions of mechanics--do suicide bombers dawdle, do they go on junk food binges because why not?--and makes gestures towards being a portrait of New York street life. But aside from one sequence seemingly spliced in from a better movie in which a young guy Williams bumps into starts putting the moves on her, the crowds remain faceless, and an 11th hour attempt at psychological development for Williams' character simply doesn't make sense. As artful depictions of stasis go, ""Day Night Day Night"" is well-executed, but it doesn't aim any higher than that.",2,"Quiet, Artsy and Safe",1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,2385,"['Though', 'nominally', 'portrait', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'actually', 'formal', 'exercise', 'drama', 'inherent', 'terrorism', 'keep', 'being', 'something', 'might', 'loop', 'corner', 'art', 'gallery', 'Luisa', 'Williams', 'unnamed', 'timid', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'nondescript', 'hotel', 'room', 'following', 'orders', 'masked', 'handlers', 'who', 'blindfold', 'grill', 'new', 'identity', 'domination', 'eerily', 'soft-spoken', 'matter-of-fact', 'Williams', 'character', 'movie', 'utterly', 'compliant', 'unnecessary', 'first', 'third', 'stylistically', 'similar', 'Upstream', 'Color', 'more', 'interesting', 'places', 'similar', 'premise', 'Then', 'dropped', 'middle', 'Manhattan', 'bomb', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'watching', 'wander', 'Times', 'Square', 'wondering', ""'ll"", 'detonate', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'already', 'signaled', 'mood', 'piece', 'rather', 'thriller', 'very', 'little', 'tension', 'Williams', 'cipher', 'other', 'terrorists', 'are', 'Americans', 'discernible', 'politics', 'emotions', 'things', 'feel', 'pretty', 'safe', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'Waiting', 'Godot', 'jokes', 'backpack', 'full', 'nails.How', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'what', 'think', 'formal', 'exercise', 'not', 'bad', 'claustrophobia', 'near', 'silence', 'first', 'half', 'contrasts', 'effectively', 'noisy', 'bustle', 'second', 'film', 'mostly', 'just', 'catalog', 'mundane', 'details', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'city', 'streets', 'where', 'theoretical', 'imminence', 'death', 'everything', 'extra', 'kick', 'cheating', 'anyway', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'thorough', 'document', 'what', 'midtown', 'Manhattan', 'looks', 'like', 'point', 'time', 'way', 'interesting', 'questions', 'mechanics', 'do', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'dawdle', 'do', 'go', 'junk', 'food', 'binges', 'because', 'why', 'not', 'gestures', 'towards', 'being', 'portrait', 'New', 'York', 'street', 'life', 'aside', 'one', 'sequence', 'seemingly', 'spliced', 'better', 'movie', 'young', 'guy', 'Williams', 'starts', 'putting', 'moves', 'crowds', 'remain', 'faceless', '11th', 'hour', 'attempt', 'psychological', 'development', 'Williams', 'character', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'artful', 'depictions', 'stasis', 'go', 'Day', 'Night', 'Day', 'Night', 'well-executed', ""n't"", 'aim', 'higher']",N/A
