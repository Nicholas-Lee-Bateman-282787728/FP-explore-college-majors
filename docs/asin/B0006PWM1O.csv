It will alienate precisely those people that need to see this movie.This documentary is ironic in so far as Wilson copies Moore's earlier attempt to interview a big shot in his attempt to interview Michael Moore, traveling throughout the country trying to track him down. In the process, he interviews other, regular, people that have been skewered and manipulated in making Moore's fictional documentaries. Everyone agrees that Michael Moore is talented at filmmaking, as was Leni Reifenstahl, except that he is blatantly dishonest in his propaganda.

Some of his more outrageous quotes flash before us here and they are truly appalling. It also illustrates the depressed and incurably negative mindset of the average far leftist in our nation. Their gloomy, smug, and self-righteous outlook is all pervasive, and it is clearly one which Michael Moore also shares. The darling of the Oscars and Cannes is but a high strung emotionac whose intelligence is often cloaked by a dense emotional overlay...an overlay through which no sun can ever shine. The segment here with David Hardy was especially masterful and believable. He lays out a brilliant case for Moore having narcissistic personality disorder a case which, in my opinion, is accurate. Stylistically, it's strong as well. I particularly liked the ""Six Degrees of Conspiracy"" mock game show.

This is the inevitable question one cannot ignore after viewing, Michael Moore Hates America.  His typical fan is probably graduated from college.

871757,A1WUEAZFC6QSCT,B0006PWM1O,"D.B.K. ""dbkinstc""","[45, 109]","I find that Michael Moore in his films often pushes the envelope on fair-play and reality and I sometimes question his methods.  When I ordered this movie, I thought it might be a humorous lambasting of Moore's films pointing out any crucial mistakes he made in presenting his case.  But there was little humor in Michael Wilson's film, just attacks.  Instead of showing where Moore screwed up, it tried to use a variation of the same tactics Moore uses to unsuccessfully prove its point.  If the purpose of this film is to show that Michael Moore hates America, then it falls far short of its goal.First of all, Michael Wilson's film offers nothing to contradict any of the allegations made by Michael Moore in his films and books.  He only attacks Michael Moore, but not what he has to say.  He did try using a statistic to refute the ""Bowling for Columbine"" movie, but he only mentioned the small part of the total study that seemed to support his claim.Wilson stated that statistically, Canada (a country with strict gun laws) has twice as much crime per capita as the US.  What he fails to tell you is that most of this crime is property crime - stealing stuff.  I'm not worried about getting shot by a petty thief or hit by a stray bullet during a turf war between rival factions of vicious shoplifting gangs.If you look at the entire study, you'll see that what Mr. Wilson did not mention was that even though Canada had more overall crime than the US, the US has SIX TIMES as much VIOLENT CRIME as Canada.  You know, the kind of crime someone often commits with a GUN.So, if one researches the one ""fact"" Mr. Wilson did bring up in his film, you'll find that it only supports Michael Moore and ""Bowling for Columbine"".  He would have been better off using the ideas of ""Freakonomics"", which paint a slightly different, but very logical, picture of gun control.Even when Michael Moore annoys me, he still entertains me.  The humor in his films is obvious.  Yes, he is frequently over the top with his attacks, his often-overbearing personality, but it's still funny.  You can always detect the twinkle in his eye.  Wilson just attacks; no real humor here.Moore is like a big, friendly dog that wants to play, but knocks you down with his enthusiasm - annoying, but fun.  Wilson is more like a pit bull, going straight for the jugular with no mercy - scary and dangerous.  He tried to be funny a couple times, but fell short of the joke.  His film is just a mean-spirited attack on Michael Moore.The people Wilson interviews all obviously hate Moore for being who he is.  They remind me of all the other Michael Moore haters who write books and articles about him.  There are attacks on his weight, attacks on his often-slovenly appearance, but no real proof that most of what he says is not the truth.If you read Jamie Whyte's book ""Crimes Against Logic"" you'll understand why attacking the messenger does nothing to negate the message.  That, to me, is the problem with the many books and videos out there which attack Michael Moore's work - they attack the person not the content.I read that Moore was very careful to not screw up any of the facts in ""Fahrenheit 911"" to avoid similar criticisms as he got for ""Bowling for Columbine"".  So, while the critics don't like Moore for being fat, pushy, and annoying, they cannot refute any of the claims made by him in his movies and books.  From that I would have to conclude that even though Moore's tactics are difficult to accept, what he is trying to say must be true.If that is the case, then it is obvious that Michael Moore does not hate America.  He loves his country as much or more than anyone living here.  This becomes obvious by watching ""Fahrenheit 911"" - one of the most patriotic films I've seen recently.  He just doesn't want to see our country destroyed by the people with the guns and money, the people who are getting richer and richer while the middle class shrinks and the lower class swells.  It is those people he is attacking, not America.  People like Mr. Wilson either cannot see that or, for whatever reason, are turning a blind eye to this obvious change in our country.  We are ALL Americans, not just the rich CEOs.  We are all hoping to live the American dream.  They are trying to steal the American dream.  Michael Moore is just pointing this out.",1,I Would Have to Conclude that Michael Moore Loves America,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,4336,"['find', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'often', 'envelope', 'fair-play', 'reality', 'sometimes', 'question', 'methods', 'When', 'ordered', 'movie', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'humorous', 'lambasting', 'Moore', 'films', 'pointing', 'out', 'crucial', 'mistakes', 'made', 'presenting', 'case', 'was', 'little', 'humor', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'film', 'just', 'attacks', 'Instead', 'showing', 'where', 'Moore', 'screwed', 'up', 'tried', 'use', 'variation', 'same', 'tactics', 'Moore', 'uses', 'unsuccessfully', 'prove', 'point', 'purpose', 'film', 'show', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'America', 'then', 'far', 'short', 'goal.First', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'film', 'offers', 'nothing', 'contradict', 'allegations', 'made', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'books', 'only', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'not', 'what', 'say', 'did', 'try', 'using', 'statistic', 'refute', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'movie', 'only', 'mentioned', 'small', 'part', 'total', 'study', 'seemed', 'support', 'claim.Wilson', 'stated', 'statistically', 'Canada', 'country', 'strict', 'gun', 'laws', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'crime', 'per', 'capita', 'US', 'What', 'tell', 'most', 'crime', 'property', 'crime', 'stealing', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'not', 'worried', 'getting', 'shot', 'petty', 'thief', 'hit', 'stray', 'bullet', 'turf', 'war', 'rival', 'factions', 'vicious', 'shoplifting', 'gangs.If', 'look', 'entire', 'study', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'was', 'even', 'Canada', 'had', 'more', 'overall', 'crime', 'US', 'US', 'SIX', 'TIMES', 'as', 'much', 'VIOLENT', 'CRIME', 'Canada', 'know', 'kind', 'crime', 'someone', 'often', 'GUN.So', 'one', 'one', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'did', 'bring', 'up', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'only', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'using', 'ideas', 'Freakonomics', 'paint', 'slightly', 'different', 'very', 'logical', 'picture', 'gun', 'control.Even', 'when', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'still', 'humor', 'films', 'obvious', 'Yes', 'frequently', 'top', 'attacks', 'often-overbearing', 'personality', 'still', 'funny', 'can', 'always', 'detect', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'Wilson', 'just', 'attacks', 'real', 'humor', 'here.Moore', 'big', 'friendly', 'dog', 'play', 'down', 'enthusiasm', 'annoying', 'fun', 'Wilson', 'more', 'pit', 'bull', 'going', 'straight', 'jugular', 'mercy', 'scary', 'dangerous', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'couple', 'times', 'fell', 'short', 'joke', 'film', 'just', 'mean-spirited', 'attack', 'Michael', 'Moore.The', 'people', 'Wilson', 'obviously', 'hate', 'Moore', 'being', 'who', 'remind', 'other', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'haters', 'who', 'write', 'books', 'articles', 'are', 'attacks', 'weight', 'attacks', 'often-slovenly', 'appearance', 'real', 'proof', 'most', 'what', 'not', 'truth.If', 'read', 'Jamie', 'Whyte', 'book', 'Crimes', 'Against', 'Logic', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'attacking', 'messenger', 'nothing', 'negate', 'message', 'problem', 'many', 'books', 'out', 'there', 'attack', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'work', 'attack', 'person', 'not', 'content.I', 'read', 'Moore', 'was', 'very', 'careful', 'not', 'screw', 'up', 'facts', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'avoid', 'similar', 'criticisms', 'got', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'So', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Moore', 'being', 'fat', 'pushy', 'annoying', 'can', 'not', 'refute', 'claims', 'made', 'movies', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'conclude', 'even', 'Moore', 'tactics', 'are', 'difficult', 'accept', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'must', 'be', 'true.If', 'case', 'then', 'obvious', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'not', 'hate', 'America', 'country', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'anyone', 'living', 'here', 'obvious', 'watching', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'one', 'most', 'patriotic', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'country', 'destroyed', 'people', 'guns', 'money', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'richer', 'richer', 'middle', 'class', 'shrinks', 'lower', 'class', 'swells', 'people', 'attacking', 'not', 'America', 'People', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'reason', 'are', 'turning', 'blind', 'eye', 'obvious', 'change', 'country', 'are', 'Americans', 'not', 'just', 'rich', 'CEOs', 'are', 'hoping', 'live', 'American', 'dream', 'are', 'trying', 'steal', 'American', 'dream', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'just', 'pointing', 'out']",N/A

Hodgson,"[10, 37]","So I finally got around to watching ""Michael Moore Hates America"", the DVD that was financed by Richard Mellon Scaife, with the help of a few right-wing think tanks. Also appearing is Penn Jillette, a rabid psychiatrist, some NRA staffers, pundits, more think-tankers, and a number of pissed-off vets.While Wilson comes off as tolerant (backhandedly) with regards to Moore's techniques, when it comes to his ideas it's almost completely one-sided in that that nearly everything is a rebuttal of the man's social commentary. There's a lot of well-balanced, average centrist people that get innocently sucked into this mess, but the number of instances that hint that maybe, just maybe Moore's got a few points in his films (as opposed to everything being mere alarmist rhetoric manufactured by taking things out of context) are exceedingly few.Center-right moderates are likely to feel soothed and smug by the whole presentation, so the movie caters to them very well. By far most of the examples criticized here involve Bowling For Columbine, with only a few from ""Roger And Me"" and none from ""Fahrenheit 911"" although the movie was released. In one scene Wilson attempts to push-poll a woman who saw ""Fahrenheit"" the day before: ""How would knowing that Mr. Moore's selective editing of the facts in Fahrenheit in order to support false conclusions affect your enjoyment of the film?""On a social level, the film is a veritable ode to Republican framing, i.e.: There Is No Economic Divide, Corporations Don't Hurt Us, We Can All Be Successful If We Work Hard Enough, Criticizing the Leadership means you Hate America, etc., etc... and oh yeah, one actually guy goes on to say that we don't need Michael Moore because we already get fair perspectives on all sides from the major news media, amazingly lumping present-day Fox, CNN and pre-merger CBS-era Walter Cronkite together in the same sentence.Ultimately, the man (Michael Wilson) fails to get his interview.",2,Karl Rove Would Be Proud,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,1961,"['So', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Hates', 'America', 'DVD', 'was', 'financed', 'Richard', 'Mellon', 'Scaife', 'help', 'few', 'right-wing', 'think', 'tanks', 'Also', 'appearing', 'Penn', 'Jillette', 'rabid', 'psychiatrist', 'NRA', 'staffers', 'pundits', 'more', 'think-tankers', 'number', 'pissed-off', 'vets.While', 'Wilson', 'off', 'tolerant', 'backhandedly', 'regards', 'Moore', 'techniques', 'when', 'ideas', 'almost', 'completely', 'one-sided', 'nearly', 'everything', 'rebuttal', 'man', 'social', 'commentary', 'lot', 'well-balanced', 'average', 'centrist', 'people', 'get', 'innocently', 'sucked', 'mess', 'number', 'instances', 'hint', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'Moore', 'got', 'few', 'points', 'films', 'opposed', 'everything', 'being', 'mere', 'alarmist', 'rhetoric', 'manufactured', 'taking', 'things', 'context', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'few.Center-right', 'moderates', 'are', 'likely', 'feel', 'soothed', 'smug', 'whole', 'presentation', 'movie', 'caters', 'very', 'well', 'far', 'most', 'examples', 'criticized', 'here', 'involve', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'only', 'few', 'Roger', 'Me', 'none', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'one', 'scene', 'Wilson', 'push-poll', 'woman', 'who', 'saw', 'Fahrenheit', 'day', 'How', 'would', 'knowing', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'selective', 'editing', 'facts', 'Fahrenheit', 'order', 'support', 'false', 'conclusions', 'affect', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'social', 'level', 'film', 'veritable', 'ode', 'Republican', 'framing', 'i.e', 'Economic', 'Divide', 'Corporations', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Hurt', 'Us', 'Can', 'Be', 'Successful', 'Work', 'Hard', 'Enough', 'Criticizing', 'Leadership', 'Hate', 'America', 'etc.', 'etc', 'oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'actually', 'guy', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'already', 'get', 'fair', 'perspectives', 'sides', 'major', 'news', 'media', 'amazingly', 'lumping', 'present-day', 'Fox', 'CNN', 'pre-merger', 'CBS-era', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'together', 'same', 'sentence.Ultimately', 'man', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'get', 'interview']",N/A

True, his quest for an interview with Moore (a la Roger & Me, an irony that is lost on no one involved) is the film's central framing device; but very little time is spent on debunking the lies contained in Moore's films (that information is commonly available from dozens of sources; focusing on that would have made for a very humdrum affair). What Wilson is more interested in is:A) finding examples and experiences to counter the very negative view of America and Americans presented by Michael Moore in both his movies and his public engagements, andB) examining the goals and methods of a REAL documentarian (a classification Moore doesn't even pretend to any longer), to the point where Wilson is questioning his own tactics and motives; he looks very hard at just what point one's own ideology overrides any sort of respect for truth (introspection of a sort Michael Moore has proven UTTERLY incapable). Penn Jillette and famed documentarian Albert Maysles help Wilson examine this issue.If you're simply looking for a demonstration of just what a complete FAKE Michael Moore is, and how completely callous his disregard for facts, honesty and even other human beings truly is, there are better sources out there (the book ""Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man"" being but one).

Neocons profit from things that Moore rails against, so it is natural for them to pay a goon to attack him on film. War, sickness, homelessness are thing that bring a smile to a Neocon's face and puts money in their pocket. Like Moore points out in one of his film's: Neocons see you as ""pets or meat"" - people are food to them.What's really awful is the fact that they pick on Moore for making people look stupid, but Neocons rely on the fact that Americans are too dumb to figure out that they are being fed upon. The truth is that Americans are not all knuckle-draggers, Klansmen or psycho Neocon boot-lickers, so this film has a very limited appeal.

Except in one instance which I'll get to later.Michael Moore makes documentaries that edit and rearrange people talking to make them appear to be saying something entirely different then what they actually said. He setups situations off-camera so that he gets the result he wants on-camera which he wouldn't otherwise have gotten. He leaves out vital facts. And, when others publicly correct the facts of his movies, he and his supporters fight back with fanatical rage and legal threats.I keep hoping for a documentary that closely examines his techniques and the consequences of his duplicity. I didn't find that here.Oh, there were a few examples. But very few. Instead the bulk of this film is given over to a examination of Moore's patriotism. It's really about ""who loves America more -- Michael Moore or me (Michael Wilson)?""In the process, Wilson even makes the same mistake that Moore makes (and most reporters make). Wilson carefully selects interviewees to counter Moore's pessimism and support his own position that America is great. And, in a movie about Moore misleading people used in his movie, Wilson is less than honest at times with interviewees about his movie's purpose (albeit, the question of his honesty is taken up on-camera).I had to look closely to find the good moments in this film (besides the few expos&eacute;s). The best was the effort to get an interview with Michael Moore which duplicated Moore's earlier (faked) documentary ROGER AND ME. And, the slightly inarticulate young serviceman without hands, who still focused on specifics in a way that Michael Wilson didn't.The misguided nature of this movie suggests Wilson may be lucky he never went one-on-one with Moore. I don't think Wilson had the cleverness to tear down Moore on intellectual grounds. They're pretty much on equal footing.That was demonstrated by the one confrontation they had in a university auditorium where Moore was giving a talk. Wilson managed to be one of the questioners and he bungled his invitation to Moore for an interview by first bringing up the stupid title of this documentary.And that's where this title worked. Where it shouldn't have. Since the title is so simplistic -- so irrelevant since it diverts focus from Michael Moore's faulty proofs to a futile comparison of emotions -- and since Moore was among 7 thousand of his supporters -- Moore, if he had more brains then his detractors give him credit for, could have made a joke of it. Instead, he lost control.So, it seems the detractors are right about Michael Moore. He isn't very bright.

871767,AX6GG8U1HDSZZ,B0006PWM1O,J. M. Jaco,"[1, 2]","Michael Wilson probably failed most when he made his working title what the final title became: Michael Moore Hates America.  Documentarians need to be open to where the chips fall, and even though Wilson directly addresses the issue himself, the final product indicates that he really was out to prove his premise more than he was to create a ""fair"" documentary.That said, people should take a close look at this film anyway.  I've never liked Moore's films, especially because they're so predictably staged with ginned-up confrontations and clear bias from those who he quotes favorably, and biased cuts made to darken the image of those he quotes unfavorably.  Perhaps this is yet another example of the trend in media we've been seeing for the last thirty years in which the dearth of verifiable reporting is becoming pandemic, particularly in corporate media.  Wilson certainly underscores many of these failings of Moore's films, even though his script sometimes contradicts itself.To his credit, Wilson shows himself just as easily falling victim to the temptation of misleading an interviewee in order to get useful sound bytes from him.  Of course, he doesn't dwell on it too long in the film, but it does help the audience question the value of what ""documentaries"" have become.  The voice of a ""real"" documentarian is intended to lend authority to this film, but rarely succeeds.  Worse, though, is the inclusion of Andrew Breitbart's analyses, the value of which has become particularly negated by Breitbart's own forays into the ""dark side"" of documentaries (or is it propagande ""journalism""?) with the ginned-up ACORN ""scandal"" and the more recent Sherrod firestorm.  Hardly a credible voice thanks to these recent acts, but when this film was made, Breitbart may have wanted to live by a higher standard.  Again, people should watch the film closely to figure out what to do with this person's moral compass and comments themselves.Frankly, I don't think Michael Wilson made much of a case about Michael Moore's films as much as he did about Moore's persona.  Michael Moore is certainly easy to dislike.  But do we have to be subjected to an armchair psychiatric explanation of Moore's failings?  I thought this was the worst part of the film, as it indicated a reach for the filmmaker that was simply uncalled for.If Michael Wilson had wanted to make a movie touting the strengths of America, he has plenty included to actually make THAT movie (and these are the best parts!), but perhaps, like Moore, he may have been afraid he wouldn't get far with it.  Believing that, maybe Wilson suffers from his own negative view of America just like the target of his film apparently does.  But Wilson, more often than he seems aware of in himself, shows that he's really no different from Moore when all is said and done.  Was that his ultimate goal?Perhaps instead of copying Moore's model for filmmaking, Wilson should have looked at the work of Charles Kuralt, a staunch liberal who truly loved individual America as much as Wilson apparently does.  Perhaps then, he could have made a movie called ""Why Michael Moore Is Wrong About America"" instead of what the film came to be called.My bottom line on this is - watch the film, but keep in mind that Wilson wants to emphasize the individual strength of regular Americans while the target of this film typically aims at big fish in big corporate entities.  The false logic is that one offsets the other, when in fact, it's apples and oranges.  On the other hand, if you don't like Moore either, you'll find plenty of reasons here to add to your dislike.",3,Whither the documentary?,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,3613,"['Michael', 'Wilson', 'probably', 'failed', 'most', 'when', 'made', 'working', 'title', 'what', 'final', 'title', 'became', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Hates', 'America', 'Documentarians', 'need', 'be', 'open', 'where', 'chips', 'fall', 'even', 'Wilson', 'directly', 'issue', 'final', 'product', 'really', 'was', 'prove', 'premise', 'more', 'was', 'create', 'fair', 'said', 'people', 'should', 'take', 'close', 'look', 'film', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Moore', 'films', 'especially', ""'re"", 'so', 'predictably', 'staged', 'ginned-up', 'confrontations', 'clear', 'bias', 'who', 'favorably', 'biased', 'cuts', 'made', 'darken', 'image', 'unfavorably', 'Perhaps', 'yet', 'example', 'trend', 'media', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'dearth', 'verifiable', 'reporting', 'becoming', 'pandemic', 'particularly', 'corporate', 'media', 'Wilson', 'certainly', 'many', 'failings', 'Moore', 'films', 'even', 'script', 'sometimes', 'itself.To', 'credit', 'Wilson', 'just', 'easily', 'falling', 'victim', 'temptation', 'misleading', 'interviewee', 'order', 'get', 'useful', 'sound', 'bytes', 'course', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'help', 'audience', 'question', 'value', 'what', 'documentaries', 'have', 'become', 'voice', 'real', 'documentarian', 'intended', 'lend', 'authority', 'film', 'rarely', 'Worse', 'inclusion', 'Andrew', 'Breitbart', 'analyses', 'value', 'become', 'particularly', 'negated', 'Breitbart', 'own', 'forays', 'dark', 'side', 'documentaries', 'journalism', 'ginned-up', 'ACORN', 'scandal', 'more', 'recent', 'Sherrod', 'firestorm', 'Hardly', 'credible', 'voice', 'thanks', 'recent', 'acts', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Breitbart', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'live', 'higher', 'standard', 'Again', 'people', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'closely', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'person', 'moral', 'compass', 'comments', 'themselves.Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'made', 'much', 'case', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Moore', 'persona', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'certainly', 'easy', 'dislike', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'subjected', 'armchair', 'psychiatric', 'explanation', 'Moore', 'failings', 'thought', 'was', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'indicated', 'reach', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'simply', 'uncalled', 'for.If', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'had', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'touting', 'strengths', 'America', 'plenty', 'included', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'perhaps', 'Moore', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'far', 'Believing', 'maybe', 'Wilson', 'suffers', 'own', 'negative', 'view', 'America', 'just', 'target', 'film', 'apparently', 'Wilson', 'more', 'often', 'aware', 'really', 'different', 'Moore', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'Perhaps', 'instead', 'copying', 'Moore', 'model', 'filmmaking', 'Wilson', 'should', 'have', 'looked', 'work', 'Charles', 'Kuralt', 'staunch', 'liberal', 'who', 'truly', 'loved', 'individual', 'America', 'as', 'much', 'Wilson', 'apparently', 'Perhaps', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'called', 'Why', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Wrong', 'America', 'instead', 'what', 'film', 'came', 'be', 'called.My', 'bottom', 'line', 'watch', 'film', 'keep', 'mind', 'Wilson', 'emphasize', 'individual', 'strength', 'regular', 'Americans', 'target', 'film', 'typically', 'big', 'fish', 'big', 'corporate', 'entities', 'false', 'logic', 'one', 'other', 'when', 'fact', 'apples', 'oranges', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Moore', ""'ll"", 'find', 'plenty', 'reasons', 'here', 'add', 'dislike']",N/A

The actual film time given to proving that is only a few mintues, though the few minutes of film clips showing Moore venting his contempt for America seem to be at least a prima facie case that this is so.This story of this film is a story of contrasting world views.  On the one hand we have Michael Moore, who has become famous, wealthy, and larger than life, mostly due to Americans who flock to movie theaters to see his docupropagandamentaries, and then seems to have little but contempt for the very society that makes this possible.On the other hand, you have a non-famous, and not wealthy, but still optimistic film maker struggling against considerable odds (the odds against getting any of Michael Moore's time seem very considerable) to interview Michale Moore, but along they way meeting some very real people who struggle every day to run their own businesses and make ends meet.We also get to meet some very articulate people (including the Penn in Penn and Teller) who have some things to say about Michael Moore and how he makes his movies.

I give much credit to Michael Wilson for having the guts to stand up to Michael Moore more than half a decade ago. Wilson films in a manner that is nearly identical to Moore's documentaries - the voiceovers, the interviews, the jokes, etc.Unfortunately, this film is now very much dated. Most people know the truth about Michael Moore- that he's really a middle-class kid from Davison, MI, which is nothing like his pretend hometown of Flint. (BTW, Flint wasn't so bad in 2004- Wilson features young, educated entreprenaurs in one segment.) Most people also know that Moore attacks images of himself- wealthy, powerful white men. And most people probably know that Moore is narcissistic. And if you didn't, the segments with the psychologist will explain everything that might be wrong with Michael Moore.In the end, I wish I could have gone in a time machine back to 2004, after I'd seen Fahrenheit 9/11 twice and was thinking that maybe Moore was doing America a favor by revealing truths about the Bush administration. Then, I think I would have found Michael Moore Hates America to be much more enlightening.If you have an ueber-liberal friend whose been living in a cave for the past six years, you might want to buy this for them.

It was those moments that I thought were the most insightful in regards to the controversy over Michael Moore's films.My biggest complaint is that he needs to explain the credibility of his most heavily-relied upon interviewees. For example the ""lawyer"" who comes on trying to diagnose Moore with a Psychological disorder, and Penn Jillette, a very good magician which apparantly qualifies him to be a media critic (though I was surprisingly impressed with Jillette's comments).There are a couple gripes I have, mostly there are several instances where he either distracts or clouds the issues but a lot of that may have been done trying to mimic Moore's own techniques.All in all, I think Wilson is a good person with a fairly open mind. The quality of the movie was 3 stars, but I gave him an extra just for being a representative of what civil discourse COULD be like if it ever took hold in America.I'm still very much a Michael Moore fan, but as I've said for a long time, I'm perfectly okay not calling Moore's movies documentaries but let's not keep calling Fox News ""news,"" because  they're two signs of the same coin.

Well, I've argued for years that we Yanks are more populist than most others in the world. There ARE opportunities here where we're not beholden to a czarist aritocracy, a British royalty, a Hindu caste system. And I can appreciate that. But for every one who made it, there are many who didn't. Moore does a far better job of covering those who didn't make it, not just those who did. In that sense, Wilson is capable of little more than dry cliches.Another one, by the way, to whom Wilson talks is David Horowitz who claims--what a surprise--that Moore's audience is the ""Communist left."" Horowitz's credibility is less than zero. He's one who should be under psychiatric observation. And I don't say that about many, even about crackpots like Limbaugh or Coulter. And speaking of psychiatrists, at the beginning, one who's diagnosing Moore, says Moore has a ""Narcisstic personality disorder."" Yeah, he's real edumacated. And I can do without psychobabble anyway.Oh, and I almost forgot Penn Jilette, of Penn & Teller. You can see my review of the P&T; television series here in Amazon.com. While I often agree with what P&T; have to say, they use as sources people of zero credibility, e.g., right wing radio talk hosts and representatives from some laughably ideological front groups. So he adds nothing to the discussion, just a little more pseudo-libertarian babble. And those representing the NRA are little more than bad PR rationalizers, and everyone knows it.Wilson tries to make it look like he's being ""objective,"" but then does the same thing that Moore does--picking people and points that serve his purpose, but Moore does is SOOOO much better. Look at the box office figures. No one knows or cares what Wilson has to say, and Moore is breaking records.As to Moore's role as a documentarian, I was at the opening night of ""Sicko"" and in a discussion group with physicians and others afterwards, we agreed that Moore isn't that, but he's a polemecist. At that he's good.I've argued from the beginning that those who resent Moore do so because he has a following. I mean, Jerry Falwell came up with dozens of ""documentaries"" 100 copies of which were sold and most ended up in waste baskets. Moore has tens of millions showing up at his opening night, and house parties afterwards in which even more show up. C'mon, Wilson, take that fact and stick it where the sun don't shine.Now, onto what I'd written a long time ago...I like Moore, but don't doubt the ""bias"" of his films. Indeed, I have little doubt of some of his hypocrisy, i.e., some have suggested he's living pretty high on the hog, a contradiction to his rabid anti-corporate stance.I've always been amused at the reaction to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" because of the records it broke, but also because of the films produced as a reaction to it (as if produced by some spoiled brats with little talent but support of those with money. Hmmm....) Fahrenheit was, frankly, pretty well done. (Recall that such pseudo-documentaries were done just a few years ago by Falwell's cronies trying to make, say, Ollie North look like a patriot and saint, rather than like the felon he is!)For cryin' out loud, Moore said he was making an anti-Bush film--not hard to do anyway. Get over it!As others pointed out, this film is the reaction of a spoiled brat. I had a drink with a guy who became a friend a few months ago. When I brought up Moore in passing, that guy said, ""Oh, he just hates America."" So that's become the battle cry of those, you know, who still think Sadam was responsible for 9/11, those--like that friend--who insist that the lack of WMDs in Iraq is ultimately either untrue or inconsequential. (!) And that battle cry is as meaningless as any of their other platitudes.Indeed, my nephew, a Republican activist, commented on the points in Fahrenheit that ""took things completely out of context."" But he could specify NONE which did so.So fans of this rubbish are running on these platitudes, articles of faith rather than on anything factual. That too causes me to appreciate Michael more.But using Dinesh D'Souza as a source of information and commentary? D'Souza's degree of ideology makes anything Moore does seem quite moderate really.If you don't like Moore's films, okay, don't watch 'em. But do yourself a favor and don't pay any attention to this diatribe.",1,Makes me appreciate Michael more.,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,5316,"['Just', 'last', 'weekend', 'spent', 'one', 'evening',
