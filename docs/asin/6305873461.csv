481615,A3KNGA5WIECM5V,6305873461,"Beth Fox ""Beth A. Fox""","[12, 19]","This is one of the most thorough, comprehensive video treatments of the long Vietnam War.  The series begins with an overview of the set, which is helpful to those unfamiliar with the conflict.  The next 11 chapters cover the post-World War II French occupation and the fall of Dien Bien Phu through the 1975 fall of Saigon (i.e., 30 years, or 10,000 days).  Along the way, we see video footage from both sides of the Ho Chi Minh trail, the firepower used by both sides, the effects of the war on the American public, and the sad evacuation of Saigon. This is followed by a video giving the perspective of soldiers who fought in the war.The set includes an impressive number of interviews from important actors like US Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, Gen. William Westmoreland, South Vietnamese Presidents Thieu and Ky, North Vietnamese officials, many anti-war activists, and ordinary soldiers.  The 13 chapters (on five tapes, at least in my Discovery channel version) provide a thorough overview of the conflict. The footage is often rare and always riveting.  Richard Basehart narrates with the right amount of authority.This is probably the most balanced of the video series out there, although that may be damning it with faint praise.  The reason I deducted a star from what otherwise would be a five-star series is that like many discussions of this conflict, it is framed by the point of view that the Vietnam war was essentially a nationalistic struggle against imperialism and the North Vietnamese simply had more ""will to fight.""  In this telling, the American government and the South Vietnamese (including ARVN) seem to be in a race to the bottom as to who would give up first.What is not emphasized here is the enormous support given the North Vietnamese by the Soviets -- the only Russian we see is Kosygin, at Ho's funeral.  We are not shown the many who fled south as Ho took power; the tens of thousands who crossed over from the Viet Cong to support the South Vietnamese government; and the horror inflicted on villagers who resisted attempts to force them to work for the North Vietnamese side.  No footage is shown of the ""re-education camps,"" where hundreds of thousands were sent, nor of the ""boat people"" who fled for their lives, even though this series was made in 1980, when these events were already known.  The series does not adequately cover the difference in strategy and tactics when Westmoreland was replaced by Creighton Abrams or point out that the new strategy was actually working.  This series was tailored to support a certain point of view.Nevertheless, if balanced by books like ""A Better War,"" by Lewis Sorley, this is an indispensable addition to anyone's  collection of Vietnam War studies.",4,"Very Comprehensive, But Not Without Bias",1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,2733,"['one', 'most', 'thorough', 'comprehensive', 'video', 'treatments', 'long', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'series', 'overview', 'set', 'helpful', 'unfamiliar', 'conflict', 'next', '11', 'chapters', 'cover', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'French', 'occupation', 'fall', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', '1975', 'fall', 'Saigon', 'i.e.', '30', 'years', '10,000', 'days', 'way', 'see', 'video', 'footage', 'sides', 'Ho', 'Chi', 'Minh', 'trail', 'firepower', 'used', 'sides', 'effects', 'war', 'American', 'public', 'sad', 'evacuation', 'Saigon', 'followed', 'video', 'giving', 'perspective', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'war.The', 'set', 'impressive', 'number', 'interviews', 'important', 'actors', 'US', 'Ambassador', 'Ellsworth', 'Bunker', 'Gen.', 'William', 'Westmoreland', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'Presidents', 'Thieu', 'Ky', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'officials', 'many', 'anti-war', 'activists', 'ordinary', 'soldiers', '13', 'chapters', 'five', 'tapes', 'least', 'Discovery', 'channel', 'version', 'provide', 'thorough', 'overview', 'conflict', 'footage', 'often', 'rare', 'always', 'riveting', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'right', 'amount', 'authority.This', 'probably', 'most', 'balanced', 'video', 'series', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'damning', 'faint', 'praise', 'reason', 'deducted', 'star', 'what', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'five-star', 'series', 'many', 'discussions', 'conflict', 'framed', 'point', 'view', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'was', 'essentially', 'nationalistic', 'struggle', 'imperialism', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'simply', 'had', 'more', 'will', 'fight', 'telling', 'American', 'government', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'including', 'ARVN', 'seem', 'be', 'race', 'bottom', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'not', 'emphasized', 'here', 'enormous', 'support', 'given', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Soviets', 'only', 'Russian', 'see', 'Kosygin', 'Ho', 'funeral', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'many', 'who', 'fled', 'south', 'Ho', 'took', 'power', 'tens', 'thousands', 'who', 'crossed', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'support', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'government', 'horror', 'inflicted', 'villagers', 'who', 'resisted', 'attempts', 'force', 'work', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'side', 'footage', 'shown', 're-education', 'camps', 'where', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'were', 'sent', 'boat', 'people', 'who', 'fled', 'lives', 'even', 'series', 'was', 'made', '1980', 'when', 'events', 'were', 'already', 'known', 'series', 'not', 'adequately', 'cover', 'difference', 'strategy', 'tactics', 'when', 'Westmoreland', 'was', 'replaced', 'Creighton', 'Abrams', 'point', 'out', 'new', 'strategy', 'was', 'actually', 'working', 'series', 'was', 'tailored', 'support', 'certain', 'point', 'view.Nevertheless', 'balanced', 'books', 'A', 'Better', 'War', 'Lewis', 'Sorley', 'indispensable', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'studies']",Vietnam - The Ten Thousand Day War

I was VERY glad there was a comprehensive history of the French in Indochina, the Paris peace accords, the U.S. backing of the reneging of the agreements for free elections, the Gulf of Ton kin (1 & 2) and the landing of U.S. Marines at Dah Nang in 1965 as opposed purely to the American involvement. That's the stuff I really enjoy as that's the basis for the U.S. involvement and, this set delivered handsomely.Richard Basehart's narration is spot on. He has a voice that's engaging along with the right amount of maturity given the subject matter. The episodes are about an hour in length each which is just about right in my opinion.There are episodes devoted to the stateside sentiment towards the war including the anti-war demonstrations which tore up the USA politically as much as the war tore up US resources and personnel.The titles in the set are:1.

481619,AMPW2XLJQISVZ,6305873461,"Cory B. ""Ronnie Milsap""","[0, 0]","I remember renting several volumes from this classic series from a local video store in the 90's and wondered if it would ever be possible to own the entire series after being out of print for so long. The new DVD reissue of Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War is great news for history lovers everywhere. This was probably the first documentary I saw that captured my interest when I was young and it surely remains one of the finest documentaries ever produced on any subject. If you love American history and documentaries, this DVD set is a must-have for your collection. The entire story of America's longest, bleakest, and most unnecessary war is covered in great detail, with informative interviews from General Westmoreland and other key figures from both sides of the conflict and a wealth of raw film footage taken straight from the battlefields and elsewhere.The film explains that President Kennedy was eager to aid South Vietnam in their fight for independence from the North, but firmly believed it was THEIR war that must be fought and won ultimately by their own efforts. By early 1965, President Johnson made the decision to send American troops into battle to fight alongside South Vietnam, a fateful move that resulted in over fifty thousand American lives lost, not to mention the lives of millions of asians. By 1968, Washington was literally clueless as to how to win the war against a determined North Vietnam. Violent war protests broke out across a deeply divided America outraged over the mounting death toll of American soldiers. Realizing his handling of the war had turned much of the country against him, Johnson wisely decided to leave the presidency at the end of his term, leaving the war in the hands of President Nixon in 1969. Despite Nixon's noble efforts to win the war while gradually bringing troops home, he also expanded the war in the early 70's into Cambodia, and America's involvement in the war would last another four years as opposition and protests continued throughout the country. Finally in 1973, a peace treaty was signed and American troops were finally sent home after eight years of endless fighting in which far too many American men died for so little. In 1975, North Vietnam finally conquered the south which brought the long and bleak war to a sad end.Written by CNN correspondent Peter Arnett, the 26 episodes of Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War {spread out over four discs in this new set} cover the entire course of the war without the blinding conservative/liberal bias that saturates mainstream news media in 21st century America. I agree with others that the rich, mellow voice of Richard Basehart is highly effective and helps make this documentary the masterpiece it is. His engaging narration draws you in and hold your attention throughout. Vast, comprehensive, absorbing, and educational, this is first-rate documentary filmmaking at its best. History teachers and students need to get their hands on this series now that it is available again at a great price.",5,A must-own for history buffs and documentary lovers,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,3031,"['remember', 'renting', 'several', 'volumes', 'classic', 'series', 'local', 'video', 'store', '90', 'wondered', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'possible', 'own', 'entire', 'series', 'being', 'print', 'so', 'long', 'new', 'DVD', 'reissue', 'Vietnam', 'Ten', 'Thousand', 'Day', 'War', 'great', 'news', 'history', 'lovers', 'everywhere', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'documentary', 'saw', 'captured', 'interest', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'surely', 'one', 'finest', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'produced', 'subject', 'love', 'American', 'history', 'documentaries', 'DVD', 'set', 'must-have', 'collection', 'entire', 'story', 'America', 'longest', 'bleakest', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'war', 'covered', 'great', 'detail', 'informative', 'interviews', 'General', 'Westmoreland', 'other', 'key', 'figures', 'sides', 'conflict', 'wealth', 'raw', 'film', 'footage', 'taken', 'straight', 'battlefields', 'elsewhere.The', 'film', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'eager', 'aid', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'fight', 'independence', 'North', 'firmly', 'believed', 'was', 'THEIR', 'war', 'must', 'be', 'fought', 'won', 'ultimately', 'own', 'efforts', 'early', '1965', 'President', 'Johnson', 'made', 'decision', 'send', 'American', 'troops', 'battle', 'fight', 'alongside', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'fateful', 'move', 'resulted', 'fifty', 'thousand', 'American', 'lost', 'not', 'mention', 'lives', 'millions', 'asians', '1968', 'Washington', 'was', 'literally', 'clueless', 'how', 'win', 'war', 'determined', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'Violent', 'war', 'protests', 'broke', 'out', 'deeply', 'divided', 'America', 'outraged', 'mounting', 'death', 'toll', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Realizing', 'handling', 'war', 'had', 'turned', 'much', 'country', 'Johnson', 'wisely', 'decided', 'leave', 'presidency', 'end', 'term', 'leaving', 'war', 'hands', 'President', 'Nixon', '1969', 'Nixon', 'noble', 'efforts', 'win', 'war', 'gradually', 'bringing', 'troops', 'home', 'also', 'expanded', 'war', 'early', '70', 'Cambodia', 'America', 'involvement', 'war', 'would', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'opposition', 'protests', 'continued', 'country', 'Finally', '1973', 'peace', 'treaty', 'was', 'signed', 'American', 'troops', 'were', 'finally', 'sent', 'home', 'eight', 'years', 'endless', 'fighting', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'American', 'men', 'died', 'so', 'little', '1975', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'finally', 'conquered', 'south', 'brought', 'long', 'bleak', 'war', 'sad', 'end.Written', 'CNN', 'correspondent', 'Peter', 'Arnett', '26', 'episodes', 'Vietnam', 'Ten', 'Thousand', 'Day', 'War', 'spread', 'four', 'discs', 'new', 'set', 'cover', 'entire', 'course', 'war', 'blinding', 'conservative/liberal', 'bias', 'mainstream', 'news', 'media', '21st', 'century', 'America', 'agree', 'others', 'rich', 'mellow', 'voice', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'highly', 'effective', 'make', 'documentary', 'masterpiece', 'engaging', 'narration', 'draws', 'hold', 'attention', 'Vast', 'comprehensive', 'absorbing', 'educational', 'first-rate', 'documentary', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'History', 'teachers', 'students', 'need', 'get', 'hands', 'series', 'now', 'available', 'again', 'great', 'price']",Vietnam - The Ten Thousand Day War

481630,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6305873461,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 17]","""Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War"" is one of the essential documentary series of our time.  I know it's fashionable to be critical of this presentation through modern eyes, but this series was invaluable in developing the television landscape of its day.  Made in 1980, this presentation won the National Education Award for Best Documentary and is often cited as one of the more definitive works to attempt to explain America's twenty year commitment in Vietnam.  It has been out of print for so long, however, that it has become virtually impossible to share and/or revisit the series if you did not own the release from 2000.  As of today, sellers on this site are asking $500 (that's the lowest price) for that DVD release in a new condition.  So, I'm glad we've finally got an updated release courtesy of Time Life and Star Vista.This 26 part series was produced in Canada and was later condensed to 13 hour long episodes for its syndication broadcast in the United States in 1981.  This release is presented on four discs and represents all of the original 26 episodes of the series with a total content of close to twelve hours.DVD Presentation:  If you do own the prior release, I would not say that this is necessarily an essential upgrade.  The show has been restored from the original broadcast masters, but it certainly still shows the signs of its age.  That's to be expected, of course, but I thought I'd mention it.  The real bonus value for new owners is the inclusion of new graphics and maps to enhance the presentation.Synopsis: Written by Peter Arnett (Pulitzer Prize winner and CNN correspondent), the series attempts to depict the entire Vietnam conflict, the U.S. involvement, and the changing attitudes about the war.  Narrated by actor Richard Basehart, this looks at roughly a thirty year time span in the history of Vietnam.  The military participation inherent in the broadcast is rather impressive and some of the footage is proprietary to this documentary.  Listen, no depiction of the Vietnam War can hope to be truly comprehensive.  ""Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War"" comes as close as your likely to get, however.  As a document of Vietnam and as a example of important filmmaking, this is an easy and hearty recommendation.

IMHO. This series is really hard to find evena copied set, but if you Google it you will find sets for (...).This is one of best war documentaries ever made (I place it tied or at least close to ""The World At War""). I would seriously think of purchasing it because it's being shown in chopped up episodes full of commercials on TV now. Why do I think it's so good? It was made just 5 years after the end of the American involvement so all the major characters were still alive to be interviewed. The Vietnam War was the most filmed war ever to that time so the documentary is able to take advantage of all the film (mostly in color). Lastly, Richard Basehart's narrative voice is as distinguished as James Earl Jones. I never perceived a bias politically on the series, (I lean heavily to the right on foreign affairs), and I think although the war was a tactical loss, it helped win the cold war so it was a strategic win (the east could not provide the basic necessities of life while competing with the west's war machine output). Still, just reading now that Peter Arnett wrote this series makes me pause, but if any war deserved Peter Arnett's input I guess this one would. Maybe it's not being re-released because Arnett has ""jumped the shark"" and has been totally discredited as an objective journalist.
