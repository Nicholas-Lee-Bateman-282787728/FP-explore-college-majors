It's about 2 people who had rough childhoods and now as adults are dysfunctional and have trouble connecting with anyone. It's a movie that shows the sad realities of life, but also the wonderful possibilities.

910698,AZ4QMF43NPDUZ,B0009PVZO6,L. Lindsay,"[0, 0]","I bought this as I am a GALE HAROLD fan (if you are not already aware).  The character Gale portrays is sweet and caring but is not treated in the same manner by his parents.  He meets a girl who has as many 'self' issues as himself but somehow they get along ok. The vunerability shown in the characters made me want to protect them myself and save them from going through the situations in the movie.  This is one for the Gale fans, as there are closeup shots of his face and his interpretation of the character.  This is another movie where Gale shows what he is capable of. Sad content of movie is that it shows how parents can so easily influence their children be it good or bad. A timely reminder for us all.",5,Sweet Movie,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,715,"['bought', 'am', 'GALE', 'HAROLD', 'fan', 'are', 'not', 'already', 'aware', 'character', 'Gale', 'sweet', 'caring', 'not', 'treated', 'same', 'manner', 'parents', 'girl', 'who', 'as', 'many', 'issues', 'somehow', 'get', 'along', 'ok', 'vunerability', 'shown', 'characters', 'made', 'want', 'protect', 'save', 'going', 'situations', 'movie', 'one', 'Gale', 'fans', 'are', 'closeup', 'shots', 'face', 'interpretation', 'character', 'movie', 'where', 'Gale', 'what', 'capable', 'Sad', 'content', 'movie', 'how', 'parents', 'can', 'so', 'easily', 'influence', 'children', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'timely', 'reminder']",Particles of Truth

910701,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0009PVZO6,Roland E. Zwick,"[34, 35]","***1/2Jennifer Elster and Gale Howard give beautiful performances in ""Particles of Truth,"" a strange but compelling tale of two emotionally damaged young people who discover one another on the mean streets of bohemian Manhattan.Lilli is an aspiring artist who suffers from grave misgivings about herself both as an artist and as a person.  She finds herself unable to trust people thanks to her troubled upbringing at the hands of her dysfunctional parents.  Morrison is a sensitive and talented published author who is so obsessed with cleanliness and germs that he has made himself a virtual prisoner to his apartment and car.  In fact, he gathers material for his writing by cruising around town taking down what it is he believes the people around him are thinking.  Haltingly, tentatively, Lilli and Morrison grope towards an understanding of one another, hoping that that will lead them to a lasting relationship.The film, artfully written and directed by Elster herself, is chock full of meaningful moments that reflect on the fragmentation, paranoia and emotional dislocation of modern urban life.  It's not only Lilli and Morrison who are filled with feelings of inadequacy and intense self-loathing, but everyone else in the film as well.  These include Lilli's perpetually cheerful, intensely religious roommate (Elizabeth Van Meter, who is a dead-ringer for Shelley Duval) who uses both her disposition and her piety as a means of masking her loneliness; the roommate's boyfriend who is a crazed, borderline psychotic; Lilli's AIDS-wracked father who lies dying friendless in a dreary tenement apartment; Lilli's mother who has no emotional connection with her daughter whatsoever; Morrison's father who can't accept the humiliation of losing his job and having his son be more successful than he is; and Morrison's mother, who suffers in silence under the veneer of a devoted wife and upper class socialite.  Elster's point seems to be that everyone is dysfunctional in some way or another, and that life is all about accepting the past and embracing one's weaknesses even if that means confronting one's demons in ways that are bound to cause intense emotional pain and suffering.  By film's end, some of those characters have taken steps to achieving that goal while others continue to languish in their own personal prisons.Like many well-meaning independent features, ""Particles of Truth"" seems a little too impressed with itself at times for its own good.  Occasionally it exudes an aura of smug pretentiousness, particularly in its obsession with weirdness for weirdness' sake.  The ending also seems a trifle on the pat side, although, commendably, Elster leaves a number of loose ends hanging around to reinforce the overall truthfulness of her vision.But these are minor criticisms of a film that is, for the most part, very well acted and filled with profound insights into human nature.  With ""Particle of Truth,"" Elster proves herself a triple-threat talent who will bear serious watching.",3,odd but compelling tale of two dysfunctional souls,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,3014,"['***1/2Jennifer', 'Elster', 'Gale', 'Howard', 'give', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'Particles', 'Truth', 'strange', 'compelling', 'tale', 'two', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'discover', 'one', 'mean', 'streets', 'bohemian', 'Manhattan.Lilli', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'who', 'grave', 'misgivings', 'artist', 'person', 'unable', 'trust', 'people', 'thanks', 'troubled', 'upbringing', 'hands', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'Morrison', 'sensitive', 'talented', 'published', 'author', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'cleanliness', 'germs', 'made', 'virtual', 'prisoner', 'apartment', 'car', 'fact', 'material', 'writing', 'cruising', 'around', 'town', 'taking', 'down', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'thinking', 'Haltingly', 'tentatively', 'Lilli', 'Morrison', 'grope', 'understanding', 'one', 'hoping', 'will', 'lead', 'lasting', 'relationship.The', 'film', 'artfully', 'written', 'directed', 'Elster', 'chock', 'full', 'meaningful', 'moments', 'reflect', 'fragmentation', 'paranoia', 'emotional', 'dislocation', 'modern', 'urban', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'Lilli', 'Morrison', 'who', 'are', 'filled', 'feelings', 'inadequacy', 'intense', 'self-loathing', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'include', 'Lilli', 'perpetually', 'cheerful', 'intensely', 'religious', 'roommate', 'Elizabeth', 'Van', 'Meter', 'who', 'dead-ringer', 'Shelley', 'Duval', 'who', 'disposition', 'piety', 'means', 'masking', 'loneliness', 'roommate', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'crazed', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'Lilli', 'AIDS-wracked', 'father', 'who', 'dying', 'friendless', 'dreary', 'tenement', 'apartment', 'Lilli', 'mother', 'who', 'emotional', 'connection', 'daughter', 'whatsoever', 'Morrison', 'father', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'humiliation', 'losing', 'job', 'having', 'son', 'be', 'more', 'successful', 'Morrison', 'mother', 'who', 'silence', 'veneer', 'devoted', 'wife', 'upper', 'class', 'socialite', 'Elster', 'point', 'be', 'everyone', 'dysfunctional', 'way', 'life', 'accepting', 'past', 'embracing', 'one', 'weaknesses', 'even', 'confronting', 'one', 'demons', 'ways', 'are', 'bound', 'cause', 'intense', 'emotional', 'pain', 'suffering', 'film', 'end', 'characters', 'have', 'taken', 'steps', 'achieving', 'goal', 'others', 'continue', 'languish', 'own', 'personal', 'many', 'well-meaning', 'independent', 'features', 'Particles', 'Truth', 'little', 'too', 'impressed', 'times', 'own', 'good', 'Occasionally', 'aura', 'smug', 'pretentiousness', 'particularly', 'obsession', 'weirdness', 'weirdness', 'sake', 'ending', 'also', 'trifle', 'pat', 'side', 'commendably', 'Elster', 'number', 'loose', 'ends', 'hanging', 'around', 'reinforce', 'overall', 'truthfulness', 'vision.But', 'are', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'filled', 'profound', 'insights', 'human', 'nature', 'Particle', 'Truth', 'Elster', 'triple-threat', 'talent', 'who', 'will', 'bear', 'serious', 'watching']",Particles of Truth
