Singing kumbaya is optional. An evil chief of the Secret Service plots to have the White House taken over by his own army of racists, disgruntled military and a computer geek. They and their weapons get into the White House without a problem, take down everyone, hold hostages, and the entire American military do nothing but stand outside the White House and watch. It's unclear exactly what these invaders want, but they're killing a lot of people, making an enormous amount of noise and doing a lot of damage.

The computer geek hacks into a presidential computer, which supposedly gives access to every rocket launcher under U.S. command.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 2]","I have mixed feeling about WHITE HOUSE DOWN.As an action movie, it is extremely entertaining; a virtual &#8220;DIE HARD&#8221;IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  Interestingly, this was the second film with the same general premise to be released this year.(Indeed, many years ago, shortly after the original DIE HARD with Bruce Willis was released, I contemplated writing a screenplay with a like basis, but I tabled the idea and went on the other things.)Channing Tatum plays a decorated Afghanistan vet, now working as capitol policeman and bodyguard for the Speaker of the House of Representatives (Richard Jenkins), who goes to the White House with his young daughter (Joey King) in tow, in order to (unsuccessfully) apply for a job with the Secret Service.  Later, while he and his daughter are still there, the Capitol dome is blown up and a heavily armed paramilitary group, ostensibly led by Jason Clarke, invades the White House.  Now, with the nation&#8217;s government in chaos, it appears that Tatum is the only person who can save his daughter, the President (Jamie Foxx) and the country.Featuring a strong supporting cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods and Michael Murphy, plus a sensational production design that makes one believe that Washington, D.C. is, in fact, under attack, WHITE HOUSE DOWN shrewdly mixes elements of DIE HARD, AIR FORCE ONE and FAIL-SAFE into a viscerally pleasurable experience.  Director Roland Emmerich does his job and does it well.My problem with the picture is that the scenario as presented is quite depressing.  I know this is just a movie, but: Would it be that easy to invade and take down the White House?I don&#8217;t want to be a Spoiler, but according to this film, all it would take is one or two traitors on the inside to pull this off.Additionally, I think it was a mistake for the producers and the screenwriter to make the President and other political figures in the film mirror people actually occupying those offices today.  Even though no political parties are mentioned, a clandestine political message is being sent here, as to who are the &#8220;good guys&#8221; and who are the &#8220;bad guys&#8221;.They may have made the movie more topical, but they have also eliminated much of the &#8220;fantasy&#8221; element that is so important in this action genre.  If you want to send audiences a serious message, then you make FAIL-SAFE and play it straight.  If you want them to have fun, then you don&#8217;t make the situation so real that it deflates them.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains four &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurettes.

1654014,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B00D6MB83W,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[1, 2]","There had never been a movie about assassinating a First Lady. And then suddenly with Hillary Clinton as First lady there were several big budget Hollywood features about First Ladies in danger. Nicolas Cage was a secret Service agent, Bruce Willis was a terrorist after the President's wife, etc. It was like 1981 - the year of all the werewolf pictures.This year we have had two mega disaster movies about terrorists (or whomever) taking over the White House. Last year we had Gerard Butler as the off-payroll Secret Service agent in 'Olympus has Fallen'. This year Channing Tatum is the off-payroll super Secret Service agent.One wonders why we bother to pay the Secret Service at all. When attacked the pros die like lemmings while some volunteer who just happens to be there saves the day.The message of these films seems to be - trust the black guys - half of the white guys are traitors. Identify the muscular white hero quickly. He is bulletproof. The White House is quite easy to take over and all sorts of people and groups are interested in trying.Both films seem to motivated in reaction to the Presidency of Barack Obama. The filmmakers seem to sense that having as feckless and incompetent a President as Obama is likely to bring about revolt and civil insurrection. Of the two this one - &#34;White House Down&#34; - is more heavy handed politically. Jamie Foxx last starred in Tarantino's  &#34;Django Unchained&#34; where he established an identity as a virulently anti-white murderer. So using a rabid hate monger like Foxx is a strong signal. In the other White House under attack movie they used the more moderate Morgan Freeman and he didn't play the President himself - just a high official.Roland Emmerich goes to great lengths to exonerate Arabs and Muslims as terrorists. He  has various white militants as the villains. That doesn't make much sense but this isn't the kind of movie that is suppose to actually make sense. Emmerich works a lot of plot gimmicks to assure everyone that this fantasy will be 'politically correct'.  This part of the movie is as lame as when in the last Tom Clancy movie - The Sum of All Fears' - they changed the nuclear terrorists from Muslims to Nazis. In some of the James Bond movies they also for reasons of political correctness changed the villains from Soviets to some worldwide private enterprise terror organization.Jamie Foxx is obviously playing Obama. He is almost an SNL Obama impersonator. They let Foxx have a couple funny scenes where the humor lies in the audience's realization that he isn't just playing some generic President - he is in fact playing our current President. But Emmerich does not dare to be anything but reverential toward Obama. It would have been much funnier to have had Obama skipping government business so as to play golf or fumbling with a teleprompter.. But Emmerich or the producers are too timid for that. Foxx who in real life seems to be a racial hothead who wants to kill whites, comes across in the script as a rather boring and sanctimonious. The President in these new White House Attack movies is just a tackling dummy - a passive object who must be protected - but who is superfluous to the drama as a person.So politically this film is mess. That's not the point.

In Roland Emmerich&#8217;s world belief is meant to be suspended in order to enjoy the journey.  If you think about the destination the magic is ruined and it becomes a stinker of a movie.

There was the right balance of stuff blowing up, emotions being tugged and sprays of bullets that somehow always miss the hero.  You just can&#8217;t fire that much weaponry at one human and not have something hit him.  Except in Roland Emmerich&#8217;s world where the hero, by golly, actually is invincible against all odds.
