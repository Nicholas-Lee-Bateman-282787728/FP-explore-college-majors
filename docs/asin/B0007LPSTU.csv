882370,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0007LPSTU,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[13, 13]","When Fred Rogers passed away in 2003, I was surprised by the welling up of emotion I felt... I had, of course, watched him on TV when I was little and alwys liked him, although I intuitively knew the show was a bit babyish... Then, when ""Sesame Street"" came along, I switched my allegiance... I wanted to watch the more ""grown-up"" show...:-) but I always felt a lingering fondness for Mr. Rogers, and while an increasingly cynical popular culture made fun of his doting sweetness, I never did.Now, a parent with a child of my own, in search of non-disturbing entertainment that won't insult the intelligence of a little kid, I've come back to Mister Rogers' neighborhood, and it feels like home.  Sadly, amazingly, inexplicably, there are only three DVDs of Mister Rogers material to be found(!) and they are all from his later years, when his hair was grey and he tended to drop things a lot... But the sweetness, the sincerity, the earnest desire to make the world a better place still comes through loud and clear.  Mister Rogers is a comforting presence, and his Land of Make Believe is still as magical as ever: we were hooked.  It's a pity you can't see all the old stuff, too -- I imagine in a few years it will all be available online as downloads, but I'm sad that we will have to miss it, when the time is so right.  Oh, well.Anyway, these DVD editions are nice, although they do have their quirks.  ""A Day At The Circus"" is one of the best because it has two stand-alone episodes, one about visiting the circus and another about making music.  The footage of live animals and chats with various circus performers is nice, and as ever Mr. Rogers aims at making life easier for the littlest people: one of the messages he gives them is that it's okay to want to leave the circus if you feel you've ""had enough"", and that it's okay to say so to your parents.The other discs are wonderful, too, though a little more problematic in that they tell whole stories, but in a fractured fashion.  As longtime viewers will know, Mr. Rogers would continue plotlines from day to day, so that a story might begin on Monday but not be resolved until Friday... So for example, in one storyline two Make Believe characters get in a fight, but the resolution comes several days later.  All very well and fine, except that there are only two episodes on each disc, so we see the beginning, and get the set-up, but when the next episode comes up there are references fto all many events that happened in the interim -- the lesson is still learned, but the gap in the narrative is disconcerting, and shows a surprising lack of respect for the audience.  Nonetheless, this was a wonderful show, and if these discs are the only material available to households that do not watch ""real"" TV, they are still certainly worth watching.  Hopefully the folks at Anchor Bay (Rogers' company) will open the vaults soon, and more Make Believe magic will be available again.",5,A beautiful day in the neighborhood,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2950,"['When', 'Fred', 'Rogers', 'passed', 'away', '2003', 'was', 'surprised', 'welling', 'emotion', 'felt', 'had', 'course', 'watched', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'alwys', 'liked', 'intuitively', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'bit', 'babyish', 'Then', 'when', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'came', 'switched', 'allegiance', 'wanted', 'watch', 'more', 'grown-up', 'show', 'always', 'felt', 'lingering', 'fondness', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'increasingly', 'cynical', 'popular', 'culture', 'made', 'fun', 'doting', 'sweetness', 'never', 'did.Now', 'parent', 'child', 'own', 'search', 'non-disturbing', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'little', 'kid', ""'ve"", 'come', 'back', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'neighborhood', 'home', 'Sadly', 'amazingly', 'inexplicably', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'DVDs', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'material', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'later', 'years', 'when', 'hair', 'was', 'grey', 'tended', 'drop', 'things', 'lot', 'sweetness', 'sincerity', 'earnest', 'desire', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'still', 'loud', 'clear', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'comforting', 'presence', 'Land', 'Make', 'Believe', 'still', 'as', 'magical', 'ever', 'were', 'hooked', 'pity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'old', 'stuff', 'too', 'imagine', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'available', 'online', 'downloads', ""'m"", 'sad', 'will', 'have', 'miss', 'when', 'time', 'so', 'right', 'Oh', 'well.Anyway', 'DVD', 'editions', 'are', 'nice', 'do', 'have', 'quirks', 'Day', 'Circus', 'one', 'best', 'two', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'one', 'visiting', 'circus', 'making', 'music', 'footage', 'live', 'animals', 'chats', 'various', 'circus', 'performers', 'nice', 'ever', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'making', 'life', 'easier', 'littlest', 'people', 'one', 'messages', 'okay', 'want', 'leave', 'circus', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'okay', 'say', 'so', 'parents.The', 'other', 'discs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'too', 'little', 'more', 'problematic', 'tell', 'whole', 'stories', 'fractured', 'fashion', 'longtime', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'would', 'continue', 'plotlines', 'day', 'day', 'story', 'might', 'begin', 'Monday', 'not', 'be', 'resolved', 'Friday', 'So', 'example', 'one', 'storyline', 'two', 'Make', 'Believe', 'characters', 'get', 'fight', 'resolution', 'several', 'days', 'later', 'very', 'well', 'fine', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'disc', 'see', 'beginning', 'get', 'set-up', 'when', 'next', 'episode', 'are', 'references', 'fto', 'many', 'events', 'happened', 'interim', 'lesson', 'still', 'learned', 'gap', 'narrative', 'disconcerting', 'surprising', 'lack', 'respect', 'audience', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'wonderful', 'show', 'discs', 'are', 'only', 'material', 'available', 'households', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'real', 'TV', 'are', 'still', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'Hopefully', 'folks', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Rogers', 'company', 'will', 'open', 'vaults', 'soon', 'more', 'Make', 'Believe', 'magic', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'again']",N/A

This is one of two Mister Rogers DVD's released to date and if you have young children you will be pleased with this purchase.  This DVD is so much more than just two amazing Mister Rogers episodes on DVD.  The program booklet and DVD extras assist you in really using this DVD as a teaching tool.  Not only can it be used as a teaching tool, it can also be entertaining for your child because it includes many activities and suggested activities.  This is the first childrens DVD that I ever had that came with a recipe.  The Mister Rogers Adventures in Friendship DVD comes with a recipe for Pizza Bagels.  The recipe is in the full color booklet and on the DVD.  The activities included with the DVD are Making Paper Chains and Silly Folder Picture.  The DVD book includes Care-Giving Tips, similar to those founds on the Mister Rogers PBS website.  Another thing I really appreciated was that the book has suggested reading appropriate to the theme of the two episodes included on the DVD.  The DVD includes the episodes ""When Friends Fight,"" and ""Love.""  The DVD also includes games.  If you have a DVD Rom, it would be probably easier for a young child to play the games with the mouse or the arrows on a computer verses with the remote control for the DVD player.  These are just a few of the special features included with this release, as there are many more.  This is an excellent DVD release and it is quite clear that the DVD producers and people associated with the show put a lot of effort into making this a quality DVD release.",5,Excellent DVD Release,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,1603,"['Mister', 'Rogers', 'Adventure', 'Friendship', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'one', 'two', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'DVD', 'released', 'date', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'two', 'amazing', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'DVD', 'program', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'extras', 'assist', 'really', 'using', 'DVD', 'teaching', 'tool', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'teaching', 'tool', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'entertaining', 'child', 'many', 'activities', 'suggested', 'activities', 'first', 'DVD', 'ever', 'had', 'came', 'recipe', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'Adventures', 'Friendship', 'DVD', 'recipe', 'Pizza', 'Bagels', 'recipe', 'full', 'color', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'activities', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'Making', 'Paper', 'Chains', 'Silly', 'Folder', 'Picture', 'DVD', 'book', 'Care-Giving', 'Tips', 'similar', 'founds', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'PBS', 'website', 'thing', 'really', 'appreciated', 'was', 'book', 'suggested', 'reading', 'appropriate', 'theme', 'two', 'episodes', 'included', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'When', 'Friends', 'Fight', 'Love', 'DVD', 'also', 'games', 'have', 'DVD', 'Rom', 'would', 'be', 'probably', 'easier', 'young', 'child', 'play', 'games', 'mouse', 'arrows', 'computer', 'remote', 'control', 'DVD', 'player', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'release', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'release', 'quite', 'clear', 'DVD', 'producers', 'people', 'associated', 'show', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'making', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release']",N/A

882374,A3JM25YVLEE318,B0007LPSTU,Penny Thoughtful,"[40, 41]","This DVD contains two full episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, one from the early 1980's (when I was watching it every day) and the other from a decade later (when my father watched it for me while I was at school and reported back to me what we learned that day).In the first episode, we get to visit a restaurant, and then in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, Henrietta Pussycat and X the Owl get angry with each other while making fruit salad.In the second episode, the Neighborhood of Make-Believe comes first, which totally disoriented me since I ALWAYS remembered it the other way around--anyway, Lady Aberlin asks questions about what love is, and then in the real neighborhood we get to hear lullabyes played on a mandolin by a Ukranian guy with a mullet.I had forgotten just how serious this show is. I tend to file it away with ""happy childhood memories,"" but really, love and friendship and anger and all of that ARE serious topics for anyone, and Mister Rogers does not water down his themes just because his audience is very young.The DVD extras are pretty cool--for adults, a video of Mister Rogers accepting his lifetime achievement award, which is touching in and of itself but also includes a neat video synopsis of his life (it doesn't mention his death though). The teddy bear assembly was interesting as well. My kid is still in the womb so I will have to get back with you about the effectiveness of the kid activities and games on the DVD. :)My one disappointment was that Daniel Striped Tiger, who is totally my favorite, was not on either episode.

It includes the trolly to the Land of Make Believe and some great stories on friendship. Plus you also get a nice trolly toy.Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is probably the best show ever made for children, because he understands the educational and emotional needs of young children ages two, three, four, and five; the little ones learning to count one-two-three-four-five, tie their shoes, and just beginning to understand themselves and their worlds. That's why Mister Rogers's Neighborhood is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics - your child's doctor.Mister Rogers teaches young children to value themselves and respect others. He speaks to them directly on his show and encourages them to use their creativity. He brings them on field trips to interesting places, like a farm, bakery, barber shop, and balloon factory.He is a good person - an educator - to invite into your home and share time with your child. His message is simple.""You're special.""I like you just the way you are.""There's only one person in the whole world just like you.""Fred Rogers wrote over 150 songs, produced and wrote almost all of his shows, and staged most of his puppets himself. He collected four Emmy Awards, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Academy of Television and Arts Sciences, numerous honorary degrees, and other awards. One of his red cardigan sweaters is enshrined in the Smithsonian Institute. Despite his success, he refused opportunities to get rich off his fame and remained a humble man committed to his cause of quality entertainment for young children.He became widely recognized as a trusted authority on early childhood education, testifying before Congress and interviewed frequently. In an Associated Press Interview he said, ""We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say `It's not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem.' Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes.""Fred Rogers is one of the unsung heroes of our society, helping children to learn about themselves, learn about the world, like themselves, and respect other people.
