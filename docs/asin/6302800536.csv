Unfortunaltely, many do not know that he also had a terrific film career that spun many hits and sequals. I as one simple fan, would like send my heart out to his family for his memory. Red Skelton did stand-up comedy long into his golden years, and always got big laughs. (Frogs....Frogs...anyone?) In The Fuller Brush Man, Red plays a man in love with a beautiful girl named Ann. He jumps from job to job, but brags that he worked for the fire department for 2 whole weeks! As a street-cleaner he smashes the Commisioners car and ends up becoming bugsplat wiper-bait on his windshield. One liner after another surrounding a great mystery makes The Fuller Brush Man a video that must be on your shelf. After the carsmashing incident, Ann decides to give Red one more chance to redeem himself before entirely surrendering her love. If he fails, then she moves on to another man. This makes Red bound and determined to succeed both as, you guessed it, a fuller brush man, and the one to win the heart of his Love, Ann. Fuller Brush man was introduced to me many years ago, and was excited when I found it on Amazon! I ordered it on the spot!

336312,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6302800536,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","Wow, this movie wore me out. It was almost non-stop slapstick action....actually too much; it could have used some lulls. Still, there were tons of funny moments.Red Skeleton, in the starring role, provides most of the laughs with some corny-but-great lines and wonderful slapstick sight gags. Red, himself, must have been exhausted making this film.My favorite parts were in the beginning when he gives door-to-door selling a chance. His mentor and nemesis ""Keenan"" (Don McGuire), sets him up with the worst houses on the block and poor Red takes a verbal and physical beating, even from a little kid! It's actually painful to see such a nice guy, such an Innocent human being, get treated so poorly by everyone. He can't catch a break, including making points with his wannabe girlfriend ""Ann"" (Janet Blair).****possible spoilers****  The break comes, of course, at the end and after a lot of chaos when Red inadvertently becomes involved in a murder and has to clear his name. You know Red, somehow, is going to pull through a ton of messy situations, even though it looks bad for him at least a hundred times!This film, and ""The Fuller Brush Girl"" with Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert, have never been put on DVDs and that's a shame.

336313,A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM,6302800536,Dom Miliano,"[26, 29]","I ordered this movie because I remember seeing it and the Yellow Cab Man in the '60s on Million Dollar Movie (NYC's Channel 9, right after supper). I laughed like an idiot back then and it's just about as funny today. Here is a movie you can watch with your kids and not have to worry about sex, violence and bad language. Really, think about it, how many movies can you say that about today. I really like the fact that Red Skelton never went dirty in his humor and when you see this film, you will know why he never had to - he was a great physical comedian. And despite the age of the movie, today's kids will actually get the gags.  Unlike the Stooges, the slap stick scenes are fast paced and often done on a grand scale (there is a great chase sequence in a warehouse that is priceless). The thing about slap stick, when done right, is that once you get laughing, you're hooked. The plot is classic '40s good vs. evil and unlike a lot of movies today, good wins. And the bad guys go to jail. And Red gets the girl. And they live happily ever after. If you have kids or are a big kid yourself, do yourself a favor and order this one.
