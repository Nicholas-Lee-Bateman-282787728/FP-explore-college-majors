It is in letterbox and a barebones release.synopsis and slight SPOILER ALERT:  It tells the story of a man whose past life as a drug dealer catches up with him one day....Thursday.  An old associate of his drops by at his house and leaves a briefcase and things go all downhill from there. He struggles with these happenings because he has cleaned up and is flying straight as an architect. He then adapts to the best of his ability and gets through a very nontypical day.,5,"A day before Ice Cube came in, but not a good day!",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,587,"['Review', 'Region', '1', 'Director', 'CutThursday', 'great', 'radar', 'film', 'rare', 'film', 'hence', 'price', 'letterbox', 'barebones', 'release.synopsis', 'slight', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'story', 'man', 'past', 'life', 'drug', 'dealer', 'up', 'one', 'day', '.Thursday', 'old', 'associate', 'drops', 'house', 'briefcase', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there', 'happenings', 'cleaned', 'up', 'flying', 'straight', 'architect', 'then', 'best', 'ability', 'through', 'very', 'nontypical', 'day']",Thursday VHS

454244,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6305197784,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 2]","This film lies somewhere between Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino but it misses the mark on both.Here's the scoop. Thomas Jane, a one time L.A. drug dealer and killer, has gone straight and is now living in Texas as a devoted husband/ architect. His old bud, Aaron Eckhart, shows up with a load of heroin and needs to use Jane's car to work a deal. Jane is furious and puts the H down the garbage disposal. Needless to say, that was not a cool thing to do. All manner of mayhem ensues.Even in a wildly plotted movie such as this, the viewer needs to be able to suspend his disbelief. I just could't manage it. I didn't believe the set-up and various things that happened throughout just didn't work for me. This is a shame because there were some scenes that were outstanding and really kept me involved. I liked when Thomas Jane shed his good-guy skin and knew what he had to do to make it through this rough situation. I also liked Eckhart's character. But writer/director, Skip Woods, fell flat when trying to develop the relationship between Jane and his wife. He tried to do, in a few deft strokes, something that needed much more time. The visit by the Dr. sent to interview Jane as a possible adopting parent was also off the mark.This took place on very few sets so they spent much of the budget on the actors and camera. This was acted well and had a slick sheen to it. For me, it failed at the script level. And when you see Woods' other projects you can note the wide swing in quality. This is by no means a bad watch.

454245,A1P7R1Z7BQ5HCL,6305197784,Ian Hunter,"[1, 1]","It begins as it means to go on; confused choices, about coffee and `blowing away' the hapless, innocent sales woman and subsequent, coffee-buying policeman. The story is about an aspiring architect, who is working, increasingly, away from his violent past. What transpires is the merging of his past with his present, with more violence at the centre of things. There is the famous (or it is infamous) rape scene, where the statuesque woman does the conquering. The experience is heightened by his attempted resistance to her obvious skills; he is tied to a chair and cannot resist, except in his mind. The underlying message is that of a marriage that is moving to the mundane. She laments that he is not the person she fell in love with; her boredom is compensated by her increasingly successful career. She has no idea about his `exciting, drug-selling, murdering past'; the basic irony. There is a scene before the rape, when a doctor is interviewing Casey about the possibility of adoption; the woman starts speaking pornographically about her attempted porn' acting experience. There is more violence but sometimes, violence works; certainly so in this film. Love is determined by the final scene between career-engrossed wife and a husband working hard to make good.

It has violence, it has humor, and it has humor in the violence and violence in the humor. Made in 1998, this movie seems like it could have been made in the present day. If you like hot chicks, if you like naked hot chicks, if you like dark comedy, and if you like violence, then this movie is for you. Set in the course of an entire day (hence the title of the movie), this movie is about the life of a former drug dealer (Thomas Jane), who for the past several years has been living the unsuspecting and innocent suburban life with this wife out in Texas. Everything seems to be going well when one morning while his wife is away at work his ex-partner in crime from Los Angeles (Aaron Eckhart), comes to drop off a suitcase &#34;just for a little while&#34;. Reluctantly, Thomas Jane's character agrees to watch over the suitcase while his friend goes on a few &#34;errands&#34; for several hours. Tempted to find out what's inside the suitcase he opens it up and discovers thousands of dollars worth of cocaine. Panicked, he flushes it all down the sink. Over the course of the day Thomas has the misfortune of getting visits from some less than upstanding individuals. This is excluding of course Paulina (I think any man would love to have the &#34;misfortune&#34; of getting a visit from her), and the family psychologist who is interviewing Thomas to see if he is stable enough to adopt a kid (very funny scene!).And even if you hate violence, I would watch it just for the Paulina scene ;)All in all I think you will enjoy this movie (perhaps more-so if you're a guy).

454253,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,6305197784,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 2]","A vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster films, Thursday is an entertaining, off-putting and hilarious thrill-ride. An amazingly eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of Tarantino's dark-humored masterpiece Pulp Fiction.Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops by Casey's (Thomas Jane) house to catch up on old times. Casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall), and is now contemplating adopting a child. Nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands... a.k.a. unfinished business. Disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, Casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. That's when, one at a time, Nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapping Rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting Casey, who is about to have one unbelievable Thursday.The film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which Nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. Resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances. This opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self-aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick.The film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. This effect is much like Pulp Fiction, which is a similarly given chapters, although Thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Also like Tarantino, music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. Oddly humorous creatures, such as the Jamaican hitman pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissistic Dallas, who attempts to rape Casey, add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. When Mickey Rourke's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop Kasarov is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and Casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable.Definitely a wannabe Pulp Fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, Thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip-off. A flashback sequence that shows Casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches John Travolta's do in Pulp Fiction is easily one step too far.- Mike Massie",3,Thursday Movie Review,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3150,"['vehemently', 'cynical', 'sarcastic', 'intense', 'film', 'mocking', 'imitating', 'style', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'stylized', 'gangster', 'films', 'Thursday', 'entertaining', 'off-putting', 'hilarious', 'thrill-ride', 'amazingly', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'bizarrely', 'entertaining', 'situations', 'day-in-the-life', 'gunman', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'proves', 'be', 'worthy', 'addition', 'series', 'films', 'attempts', 'mimic', 'genius', 'Tarantino', 'dark-humored', 'masterpiece', 'Pulp', 'Fiction.Nick', 'Aaron', 'Eckhardt', 'Casey', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'house', 'catch', 'up', 'old', 'times', 'Casey', 'was', 'former', 'gunman', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'reformed', 'become', 'architect', 'married', 'successful', 'businesswoman', 'Paula', 'Marshall', 'now', 'contemplating', 'adopting', 'child', 'Nick', 'who', 'still', 'ties', 'gangster', 'underworld', 'briefcase', 'full', 'drugs', 'Casey', 'house', 'car', 'run', 'few', 'errands', 'a.k.a', 'unfinished', 'business', 'Disgusted', 'angered', 'introduction', 'drugs', 'home', 'Casey', 'down', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'when', 'one', 'time', 'Nick', 'double-crossed', 'accomplices', 'rapping', 'Rastafarian', 'drug', 'messengers', 'crooked', 'cops', 'come', 'a-knocking', 'unsuspecting', 'Casey', 'who', 'have', 'one', 'unbelievable', 'Thursday.The', 'film', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'gas', 'station', 'Nick', 'looking', 'best', 'deal', 'cup', 'coffee', 'pondering', 'size', 'cup', 'get', 'fiasco', 'out', 'cashier', 'when', 'free', 'snackie', 'cake', '50', 'bill', 'pay', 'Resulting', 'comically', 'brilliant', 'bloodshed', 'situation', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'cop', 'intervenes', 'caught', 'most', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'opening', 'segment', 'perfect', 'mood', 'rest', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'seem', 'self-aware', 'own', 'existence', 'nonsensical', 'gangster', 'flick.The', 'film', 'broken', 'segments', 'based', 'various', 'events', 'times', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'effect', 'much', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'similarly', 'given', 'chapters', 'Thursday', ""n't"", 'mess', 'chronological', 'order', 'occasional', 'flashback', 'Also', 'Tarantino', 'music', 'magnificently', 'scene', 'character', 'Oddly', 'humorous', 'creatures', 'such', 'Jamaican', 'hitman', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'phone', 'shares', 'hashish', 'Paulina', 'Porizkova', 'narcissistic', 'Dallas', 'who', 'rape', 'Casey', 'add', 'humor', 'event', 'regardless', 'how', 'horrifying', 'unnerving', 'coincidences', 'are', 'When', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'calmly', 'spine-chilling', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Kasarov', 'introduced', 'careful', 'staging', 'intricate', 'setup', 'fully', 'assembled', 'Casey', 'sticky', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'daring', 'laudable.Definitely', 'wannabe', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'plenty', 'violence', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'antagonists', 'Thursday', 'things', 'right', 'other', 'attempts', 'homage', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'just', 'far', 'enough', 'suggest', 'rip-off', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'Casey', 'shooting', 'up', 'baddies', 'sporting', 'hairstyle', 'exactly', 'John', 'Travolta', 'do', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'easily', 'one', 'step', 'too', 'far.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Thursday VHS
