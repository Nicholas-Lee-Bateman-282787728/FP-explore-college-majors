The practice tracks (complete with looping feature) are exceptionally helpful at getting the beginner playing. Even though I've moved beyond this course, I still use the practice tracks for warming up and keeping me refreshed on the chords I learned from this DVD.  I want to echo the positive comments made about Keith Wyatt.  He manages to convey a sense that ""you can do this.""  After a month or six weeks the ""Getting Started"" DVD course does start to feel limiting.  At 6 weeks I added the E-media Beginner Guitar course to my practice routine, and that has helped me to progress beyond the lessons on this DVD.  I also added the Rock Shop method by Aaron Stang and really like that too.  That being said, I still use the practice tracks on this DVD every single day.  It's well worth the modest cost.

694226,A2X4PBSVF3CGSK,B0000639G7,"SeekingTraveler ""SeekingTraveler""","[7, 7]","This review is for ""Fender Presents: Getting Started on Electric Guitar -- A Guide for Beginners."" I also bought the Fender ""Getting Started on Acoustic Guitar"" DVD. Do not bother buying both DVD courses; they are essentially the same. In fact, one half of the content is exactly the same.This course is excellent. Obviously a great deal of thought went into the production of this DVD at-home guitar course. If you just got your guitar and do not even know how to tune it, this DVD is a great place to start. In fact, it will probably be best for you to start with this DVD (for about three months) before you start taking guitar lessons from a live instructor. This course probably works best with teenagers and adults. Children will probably need help from a parent (it should not matter whether or not the parent plays guitar).This course will teach you how to tune your guitar and how to play basic open-string chords. With this knowledge, you will be able to play rhythm guitar for simple songs fairly quickly. Song chords may be found in numerous places online, as well as in guitar ""fake books"" sold here on Amazon. Being able to quickly have fun playing one's guitar helps motive one to continue learning how to play. The Fender course also teaches barre chords, notes on the sixth and fifth strings (to enable you to locate the root notes and placement of barre chords), three-string power chords (for easy rock 'n' roll), and the A minor pentatonic scale (for simple lead guitar). Additionally, there is instruction on basic electric guitar techniques, such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, vibrato, and palm muting. You could easily spend a year mastering barre chords and these guitar skills. The practice tracks are a great learning tool that helps master strumming patterns and rhythm.In short, the Fender course is an excellent resource for the new guitar player. It will not teach you how to read music, and it will not teach you any music theory, but it will teach you everything most new guitar players need to learn to play chord progressions. For example, with this course alone (and songs you get from the internet), you will be able to play rhythm guitar while you sing.""Learn and Master Guitar"" by Steve Krenz is (by far) a better and more comprehensive course. If you are serious about learning guitar (it is a 20 DVD course, so you better be serious), then try that course in addition to the Fender course. The ""Learn and Master Guitar"" course is equivalent to two years of guitar instruction (there is even a home-school version.). Another great DVD set for the new guitar player is the Rock House ""Learn Electric Guitar"" course. A good book on music theory is Hal Leonard's ""Music Theory for Guitarists"" (by Tom Kolb). If you wish to learn how to sight-read music, a good course is the Berklee ""A Modern Method for Guitar - Volume 1: Book/DVD-ROM Pack."" Most are available here on Amazon.",5,Great course for new guitar player,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2917,"['review', 'Fender', 'Presents', 'Getting', 'Started', 'Electric', 'Guitar', 'Guide', 'Beginners', 'also', 'bought', 'Fender', 'Getting', 'Started', 'Acoustic', 'Guitar', 'DVD', 'Do', 'not', 'bother', 'buying', 'DVD', 'courses', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'fact', 'one', 'half', 'content', 'exactly', 'same.This', 'course', 'excellent', 'Obviously', 'great', 'deal', 'thought', 'went', 'production', 'DVD', 'at-home', 'guitar', 'course', 'just', 'got', 'guitar', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'tune', 'DVD', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'fact', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'start', 'DVD', 'about', 'three', 'months', 'start', 'taking', 'guitar', 'lessons', 'live', 'instructor', 'course', 'probably', 'best', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'Children', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'help', 'parent', 'should', 'not', 'matter', 'not', 'parent', 'guitar', '.This', 'course', 'will', 'teach', 'how', 'tune', 'guitar', 'how', 'play', 'basic', 'open-string', 'chords', 'knowledge', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'simple', 'songs', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Song', 'chords', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'numerous', 'places', 'online', 'as', 'well', 'guitar', 'fake', 'books', 'sold', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Being', 'able', 'quickly', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'one', 'guitar', 'motive', 'one', 'continue', 'learning', 'how', 'play', 'Fender', 'course', 'also', 'barre', 'chords', 'notes', 'sixth', 'fifth', 'strings', 'enable', 'locate', 'root', 'notes', 'placement', 'barre', 'chords', 'three-string', 'power', 'chords', 'easy', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'A', 'minor', 'pentatonic', 'scale', 'simple', 'lead', 'guitar', 'Additionally', 'instruction', 'basic', 'electric', 'guitar', 'techniques', 'such', 'hammer-ons', 'pull-offs', 'slides', 'vibrato', 'palm', 'muting', 'could', 'easily', 'spend', 'year', 'mastering', 'barre', 'chords', 'guitar', 'skills', 'practice', 'tracks', 'are', 'great', 'learning', 'tool', 'master', 'strumming', 'patterns', 'rhythm.In', 'short', 'Fender', 'course', 'excellent', 'resource', 'new', 'guitar', 'player', 'will', 'not', 'teach', 'how', 'read', 'music', 'will', 'not', 'teach', 'music', 'theory', 'will', 'teach', 'everything', 'most', 'new', 'guitar', 'players', 'need', 'learn', 'play', 'chord', 'progressions', 'example', 'course', 'alone', 'songs', 'get', 'internet', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'sing', 'Learn', 'Master', 'Guitar', 'Steve', 'Krenz', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'course', 'are', 'serious', 'learning', 'guitar', '20', 'DVD', 'course', 'better', 'be', 'serious', 'then', 'try', 'course', 'addition', 'Fender', 'course', 'Learn', 'Master', 'Guitar', 'course', 'equivalent', 'two', 'years', 'guitar', 'instruction', 'even', 'home-school', 'version.', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'new', 'guitar', 'player', 'Rock', 'House', 'Learn', 'Electric', 'Guitar', 'course', 'good', 'book', 'music', 'theory', 'Hal', 'Leonard', 'Music', 'Theory', 'Guitarists', 'Tom', 'Kolb', 'wish', 'learn', 'how', 'sight-read', 'music', 'good', 'course', 'Berklee', 'A', 'Modern', 'Method', 'Guitar', 'Volume', '1', 'Book/DVD-ROM', 'Pack', 'Most', 'are', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon']",N/A
